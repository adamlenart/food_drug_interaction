Despite this prolific use, many of these products have detrimental side-effects that compromise servicemembers? health and could, by proxy, compromise a mission. This paper presents the case of a 32-year old Navy Special Operations Forces (SOF) Sailor who, prior to physical training, used a supplement containing 1,3 Dimethylamylamine (DMAA), and then developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He required intravenous calcium channel blocker administration, followed by beta blockers, for rate control. As military providers, we routinely ask our patients about their use of supplements and while the regulation of these products is beyond the scope of practice for most of us, it is our duty to become better educated about the risks and benefits of these supplements. We must educate our patients and our commands on the potential harm that these supplements may pose.", 
    "1": "The aim of the work was to study effect of bisoprolol and nebivolol therapy on the sexual function of men with AH. 20 men aged 35-55 (48 +/- 3.5) yr with grade I and II AH received either drug for 2 months. Cardiac rhythm variability (CRV) was estimated in the end of the 4-week placebo period and after 2-month monotherapy. Dopplerography of penile arteries and a questionnaire study (as described by Vasilchenko) were conducted. Both drugs significantly increased the tone of the parasympathetic component of the vegetative nervous system, improved systolic blood flow in cavernous and dorsal arteries. The questionnaire study failed to revel significant changes of the sexual function. It is concluded that biosporolol and nebivolol did not compromise the sexual function of men with AH; they improve spectral CRV characteristics and blood flow in cavernous arteries.", 
    "2": "Aqueous crude cold-water extract from the fruiting body of the culinary-medicinal oyster mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus was assessed for activity against increased intra-ocular pressure (IOP) in mice. A 0.1% dexamethasone instillation was used to raise the intra-ocular pressure in the animals above the 21-mmHg threshold limit. The extract has intrinsic anti-hypertensive properties that are dose dependent. A comparison analysis indicated that 150 mg/mL of the crude extract produced 57.69% reduction in the intra-ocular pressure, while doses of 100 mg/ mL and 200 mg/mL produced 44.78% and 70.03% IOP reduction, respectively, compared with timolol maleate with 57.69%. The results were significant at 0.05 confidence limit (p < 0.05) when compared to a placebo and therefore support its use for the treatment of increased intra-ocular pressure.",

    "7": "Clinical, hemodynamic and metabolic parameters were investigated for 42 patients with coronary heart disease, after myocardial infarct, recieved selective beta-adrenoblockers. Patients were divided in two groups. The first group (24 patients) were given methoprolol (50 mg/daily) and antiatherogenic lacto vegetarian diet, the second (18 patients)--methoprolol (50 mg/daily) and standard mixed antiatherogenic diet. After the treatment, positive changes clinical and gemodynamic parameters were observed in both groups of patients. Among the clinical symptoms, a more pronounced decrease in blood pressure in the patients on vegetarian diet and a more significant increase in their exercise tolerance. The level of total cholesterol on the serum of blood decreased by 16%, low-density lipoproteins cholesterol decreased by 18%, the atherogenic coefficient (KA) decreased by 31%, only in vegetarian group. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased in vegetarian group, by 14% and decreased in control group. Balanced antiatherogenic lacto vegetarian diet in patients with coronary heart disease prevents the hyperlipedemic effect caused by the selective beta-adrenoblockers and it is an agent for preventing its negative effect on lipid metabolism.", 
    "8": "To compare the short-term effectiveness and ocular side-effects of fixed combinations of dorzolamide/timolol (DTFC) and brimonidine/timolol (BTFC) in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Forty-two eyes of 42 patients newly diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma were assessed prospectively. One of the two eyes was chosen randomly and treated with DTFC (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01) for 4\u00a0weeks. The treatment was then stopped to allow a 4-week wash-out period. Following the wash-out period, the same eye was treated with BTFC (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01) for 4\u00a0weeks. Intraocular pressure (IOP) values were measured before and after each treatment at 0800, 1,200 and 1,600\u00a0h. Tear function test results and ocular side-effects were also recorded. The mean baseline IOP values for DTFC and BTFC were 24.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8 and 24.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4\u00a0mmHg, respectively. The mean IOP values after 4\u00a0weeks of treatment with DTFC or BTFC were 17.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9 and 16.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0mmHg, respectively. Both medications reduced IOP values significantly (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0000). The effectiveness of both medications was similar (P\u00a0=\u00a00.7363). Both combinations significantly reduced the amount of tear secretion and tear break-up time (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0000). Eye burning was more common with DTFC than with BTFC (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0182). Other adverse effects were observed at similar rates for both combinations. This study demonstrated that the IOP-reducing effects of DTFC and BTFC in patients with POAG are similar. The side-effect profile of BTFC is similar to that of DTFC. Lower occurrence of a burning sensation may improve patient compliance in the BTFC group.",

    "13": "Brain clearance of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b242) by innate immune cells is necessary for maintenance of normal brain function. Phagocytosis of soluble A\u03b242 by Alzheimer's disease (AD) macrophages is defective, recovered in all \"Type I and Type II\" AD patients by 1\u03b1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 (1,25D3) and blocked by the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) antagonist (23S)-25-dehydro-1\u03b1(OH)-vitamin D3-26,23-lactone (MK). Bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDC) is a VDR ligand and additive with 1,25D3 in promoting A\u03b242 phagocytosis by Type I, but not by Type II macrophages. Here, we define the following intracellular mechanisms regulated by 1,25D3 that are associated with recovery of phagocytosis and consistent with the selectivity of BDC: 1) 1,25D3 potentiates a 4,4-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid-sensitive chloride channel (i.e., ClC-3) currents in both Type I and II AD macrophages, but curcumin only potentiates the currents in Type I cells; 2) 1,25D3 is particularly effective in upregulating ClC-3 mRNA expression in Type II peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) while both 1,25D3 and the BDC analog, C180, upregulate VDR mRNA, repressed by A\u03b242 in Type II PBMCs; and 3) 1,25D3-induced A\u03b242 phagocytosis is attenuated by the calcium-dependent ClC-3 blocker, inositol 3,4,5,6-tetraphosphate (IP4), in both AD Types and by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 only in Type II macrophages. VDR hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled mass spectrometry and computational results show differences between the abilities of 1,25D3 and curcuminoids to stabilize VDR helices associated with the regulation of gene transcription. The structure-function results provide evidence that 1,25D3 activation of VDR-dependent genomic and nongenomic signaling, work in concert to recover dysregulated innate immune function in AD.", 
    "14": "We have recently demonstrated that the glutamate transporter activator riluzole paradoxically enhanced glutamate-induced glutamate release from cultured astrocytes. We further showed that both riluzole and the \u03b1(2)\u03b4 subunit ligand gabapentin activated descending inhibition in rats by increasing glutamate receptor signaling in the locus coeruleus and hypothesized that these drugs share common mechanisms to enhance glutamate release from astrocytes. In the present study, we examined the effects of riluzole and gabapentin on glutamate uptake and release and glutamate-induced Ca(2+) responses in primary cultures of astrocytes. Riluzole and gabapentin facilitated glutamate-induced glutamate release from astrocytes and significantly increased glutamate uptake, the latter being completely blocked by the non-selective glutamate transporter blocker DL-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartic acid (DL-TBOA). Riluzole and gabapentin also enhanced the glutamate-induced increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations. Some \u03b1(2)\u03b4 subunit ligands, pregabalin and L-isoleucine, enhanced the glutamate-induced Ca(2+) response, whereas another, 3-exo-aminobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-exo-carboxylic acid (ABHCA), did not. The enhancement of glutamate-induced intracellular Ca(2+) response by riluzole and gabapentin was blocked by the DL-TBOA and an inhibitor of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange, 2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiurea (KB-R7943). Gabapentin's enhancement of Ca(2+) increase was specific to glutamate stimulation, as it was not mimicked with stimulation by ATP. These results suggest that riluzole and gabapentin enhance Na(+)-glutamate co-transport through glutamate transporters, induce subsequent Ca(2+) influx via the reverse mode of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange, and thereby facilitate Ca(2+)-dependent glutamate release by glutamate in astrocytes. The present study also demonstrates a novel target of gabapentinoid action in astrocytes other than \u03b1(2)\u03b4 subunits in neurons.",

    "24": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is an infrequent cardiac syndrome characterized by acute onset chest pain with apical ballooning on echocardiography. It is often triggered by severe emotional or physical stress, and in contrast to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the regional wall motion abnormality returns to normal within days. Here, we describe a 62-year-old female who presented with acute onset chest pain during treatment for a liver abscess. We presumed a diagnosis of AMI because of ST segment elevation on electrocardiography and elevated cardiac enzyme levels. However, the patient's coronary arteries were normal on angiography, and apical ballooning was seen on echocardiography. A diagnosis of TTC was made, and the patient was managed with intensive cardiopulmonary support using vasopressors in our hospital's medical intensive care unit. The patient's symptoms improved, but persistent severe left ventricular dysfunction was detected on follow-up echocardiography. After 5 weeks, a new apical mural thrombus appeared, and anticoagulation therapy was started. The apical ballooning persisted 3 months later, although the patient's overall ejection fraction was slightly improved. The apical thrombus was completely resolved without any embolic event. Non-adrenergic inotropics can be recommended in TTC with shock, and clinicians should keep in mind the potential risk of thrombus formation and cardioembolism.", 
    "25": "Critical limb ischaemia (CLI) is a particularly severe manifestation of lower limb atherosclerosis posing a major threat to both limb and life of affected patients. Besides arterial revascularisation, risk-factor modification and administration of antiplatelet therapy is a major goal in the treatment of CLI patients. Key elements of cardiovascular risk management are smoking cessation and treatment of hyperlipidaemia with dietary modification or statins. Moreover, arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus should be adequately treated. In CLI patients not suitable for arterial revascularisation or subsequent to unsuccessful revascularisation, parenteral prostanoids may be considered. CLI patients undergoing surgical revascularisation should be treated with beta blockers. At present, neither gene nor stem-cell therapy can be recommended outside clinical trials. Of note, walking exercise is contraindicated in CLI patients due to the risk of worsening pre-existing or causing new ischaemic wounds. CLI patients are oftentimes medically frail and exhibit significant comorbidities. Co-existing coronary heart and carotid as well as renal artery disease should be managed according to current guidelines. Considering the above-mentioned treatment goals, interdisciplinary treatment approaches for CLI patients are warranted. Aim of the present manuscript is to discuss currently existing evidence for both the management of cardiovascular risk factors and treatment of co-existing disease and to deduct specific treatment recommendations.", 
    "26": "The mechanism of therapeutic success of propranolol for severe infantile haemangioma remains unclear. Propranolol was shown to modify matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) levels, which are associated with tumour pathogenesis. We hypothesized that urinary MMP2/9 is higher in patients with infantile haemangioma compared to healthy infants and that propranolol reduces MMP2/9 levels and thus leads to an involution of the haemangioma. In this case, MMP2/9 could be used as a marker of indicated therapy or therapeutic success. Urinary samples were taken before, 2\u00a0weeks after, and 2\u00a0months after the beginning of propranolol treatment in haemangioma patients and once in healthy controls. Activity of MMP2/9 was determined by commercially available activity kits. Urine of 22 haemangioma patients and 21 control subjects was obtained. Propranolol therapy had significant success in all patients. MMP2/9 was present in most samples, the younger the children the higher the MMP2 levels. Haemangioma patients showed lower levels of MMP2. The MMP2 levels were significantly higher after 2\u00a0weeks of propranolol than prior to therapy. There were no differences in MMP9 levels.", 
    "27": "Presence of MMP2/9 in the urine of infants <1\u00a0year can be explained by high rate of physiological tissue remodelling. Unexpectedly, MMP2 was lower in the urine of haemangioma patients and higher 2\u00a0weeks after propranolol treatment. Taking this and the diverse results in literature into account, the correlation between MMPs, proliferation, and regression of haemangiomas and propranolol remains unclear.", 
    "28": "Quantitative and qualitative high-resolution (HR) dependent and independent acquisition schemes on a QqTOF MS (with resolving power 20,000-40,000) were investigated for the analysis of pharmaceutical compounds in biological fluids. High-resolution selected reaction monitoring (HR-SRM) was found to be linear over three orders of magnitude for quantitative analysis of paracetamol in human plasma, offering a real alternative to triple quadrupole LC-SRM/MS. Metabolic stability of talinolol in microsomes was characterized by use of three different acquisition schemes: (i) information-dependent acquisition (IDA) with a TOF MS experiment as survey scan and product-ion scan as dependent scan; (ii) MS(ALL) by collecting TOF mass spectra with and without fragmentation by alternating the collision energy of the collision cell between a low (i.e., 10 eV) and high setting (i.e., 40 eV); and (iii) a novel independent acquisition mode referred to as \"sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment-ion spectra\" (SWATH) or \"global precursor ions scan mode\" (GPS) in which sequential precursor ions windows (typically 20 u) are used to collect the same spectrum precursor and fragment ions using a collision energy range. SWATH or GPS was found to be superior to IDA or MS(ALL) in combination with UHPLC for qualitative analysis but requires a rapidly acquiring mass spectrometer. Finally, the GPS concept was used for QUAL/QUAN analysis (i.e. integration of qualitative and quantitative analysis) of bosentan and its metabolites in urine over a concentration range from 5 to 2,500 ng mL(-1).",

The incubation with 2-OHE(2) induced a shift in steroidogenic pattern: the C(19) and C(18) steroids testosterone (T) and estradiol-17\u03b2 (E(2)), respectively were significantly decreased with a concomitant significant increase in the C(21) steroids progesterone (P(4)), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), 17,20\u03b2-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20\u03b2-DP), 17,20\u03b1-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20\u03b1-DP) and cortisol (F). Concomitantly, the catecholestrogen induced dose-dependently GVBD response, the first sign of meiosis resumption. The co- and pre-incubations of the ovarian pieces with 2-OHE(2), and adrenergic (phentolamine, \u03b1-blocker and propranolol, \u03b2-blocker) or estrogen (tamoxifen) receptor blockers resulted in inhibition of the stimulatory effect of the catecholestrogen on C(21) steroids and reversed the inhibition of testosterone and E(2). The \u03b1-blocker was more effective than the \u03b2-blocker. Our results suggest that 2-OHE(2) appears to employ both adrenergic (\u03b1-type) and estrogen receptor mechanisms in mediating the effects. The co- or pre-incubation of ovarian pieces with IBMX (a cAMP elevating drug), H89 (a protein kinase A inhibitor), and PD098059 (a MAP kinase kinase inhibitor) significantly inhibited the stimulatory effect of 2-OHE(2) on the C(21) steroids. The effect of chelerythrine (a protein kinase C inhibitor), on the other hand, varied with the incubation condition. In the co-incubation, the steroids showed varied effects: 17,20\u03b2-DP, testosterone and E(2) were elevated, and P(4) and 17-OHP were decreased. In the pre-incubation set up, all the steroids were inhibited except E(2). The inhibition by the blockers was higher in the pre-incubation groups. Taken together, the data suggest the involvement cAMP-protein kinase A, protein kinase C and MAP kinase pathways in the modulation of the steroidogenic activity.",

    "35": "The effects of catecholamines on longitudinal displacements and intramural shear strain of the arterial wall are unexplored. Therefore, the common carotid artery of five anaesthetized pigs was investigated using an in-house developed noninvasive ultrasonic technique. The study protocol included intravenous infusion of low-dose epinephrine (\u03b2-adrenoceptor activation), as well as intravenous boluses of norepinephrine (\u03b1-adrenoceptor activation). Further, the effects of \u03b2-blockade (metoprolol) were studied. There were significant positive correlations between pulse pressure and longitudinal displacement of the intima-media complex (r = 0.72; P < 0.001), as well as between pulse pressure and intramural shear strain (r = 0.48; P < 0.001). Following administration of norepinephrine, the longitudinal displacement of the intima-media complex and intramural shear strain profoundly increased (median 190%, range 102-296%, and median 141%, range 101-182%, respectively, compared with baseline), also when given during \u03b2-blockade (median 228%, range 133-266%, and median 158%, range 152-235%, respectively). During infusion of low-dose epinephrine, the longitudinal displacement of the intima-media complex and intramural shear strain decreased (median 88%, range 69-122%, and median 69%, range 47-117%, respectively, compared with baseline). In conclusion, the present study shows, for the first time, that the longitudinal displacement and intramural shear strain of the porcine carotid artery undergo profound changes in response to catecholamines. Increase in longitudinal displacements seems to be strongly related to \u03b1-adrenoceptor activation. Thus metoprolol is insufficient to counteract a profound increase in longitudinal displacement and intramural shear strain following a surge of norepinephrine.",

Hypertension and dyslipidemia were also paradoxically associated with better survival in our model (HR 0.74, CI 0.59-0.92; and HR 0.77, CI 0.63-0.94; respectively; both P < .05).",

    "43": "Residual silanols on C18 columns yield undesirable slow-kinetics ion-exchange interactions with positively charged basic compounds that result in asymmetrical peaks, low efficiencies and long retention times. The purity of the silica employed as supporting material, and the technique used to form the bonded phase, which varies with the brand and manufacturer, give rise to different amounts of residual silanols in the packings, and consequently, different chromatographic performance. One of the most efficient and widespread strategies to reduce or even eliminate the different performance among columns is the addition of a reagent to the mobile phase to block the silanol sites. However, the intrinsic nature of both stationary phase and additive leads to particular results. In this work, a group of basic compounds were analysed using six C18 stationary phases (Zorbax SB-C18, X-Terra MS C18, Kromasil, Lichrospher, Nucleosil, and Spherisorb) and acetonitrile-water mixtures. Two ionic liquids (ILs), 1-butyl- and 1-hexyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborates, were added to the mobile phases to evaluate their silanol suppressing potency, based on the decreased retention of the basic compounds when the silanols are blocked (described by the Horv\u00e1th equation), and the improvement in peak profile (described by the plots of the peak half-widths at diverse retention times). The suppressing potency based on the retention can be misleading when the adsorption of the IL anion is not negligible, since the anion attracts the cationic basic compounds increasing the retention. However, the accessibility of basic compounds to the silanols is prevented by both IL cation and anion, improving the peak profiles for all stationary phases. This was especially remarkable for Spherisorb, which in the absence of additive yielded by far the worst performance. 1-Hexyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate was the best additive in terms of retention and peak profile (width and asymmetry).",

Its action has been proven to reach beyond adrenergic antagonism and involves multiple biological mechanisms. The interaction between carvedilol and endogenous 'gasotransmitter' hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is unknown. The aim of the study is to assess the influence of carvedilol on the H2S tissue level in mouse brain, liver, heart and kidney. Twenty eight SJL strain female mice were administered intraperitoneal injections of 2.5 mg/kg b.w./d (group D1, n=7), 5 mg/kg b.w./d (group D2, n=7) or 10 mg/kg b.w./d of carvedilol (group D3, n=7). The control group (n=7) received physiological saline in portions of the same volume (0.2 ml). Measurements of the free tissue H2S concentrations were performed according to the modified method of Siegel. A progressive decline in H2S tissue concentration along with an increase in carvedilol dose was observed in the brain (12.5%, 13.7% and 19.6%, respectively). Only the highest carvedilol dose induced a change in H2S tissue level in the heart - an increase by 75.5%. In the liver medium and high doses of carvedilol increased the H2S level by 48.1% and 11.8%, respectively. In the kidney, group D2 showed a significant decrease of H2S tissue level (22.5%), while in the D3 group the H2S concentration increased by 12.9%. Our study has proven that carvedilol affects H2S tissue concentration in different mouse organs.",

Prolonged tachyarrhythmia or hypertension can result in significant morbidity, such as cerebrovascular events, myocardial infarction and other end-organ damage. This article reviews the clinical efficacy and tolerability of intravenous infusions of esmolol for the short-term treatment of tachyarrhythmias and the short-term control of tachycardia and hypertension, and provides an overview of the pharmacological properties of the drug. Esmolol, a cardioselective \u03b2-blocker, has been proven effective in the control of elevated haemodynamic parameters in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, hypertension and tachycardia in the perioperative setting, and acute ischaemic heart disease, as well as being associated with a reduced risk of some clinical sequelae to increased haemodynamic parameters. Esmolol is, moreover, generally well tolerated; while it is associated with an increased risk of hypotension, this is rapidly reversible. Definitive conclusions on the efficacy of esmolol are difficult to reach, as most trials investigating esmolol have limitations such as small patient populations, and few studies investigate the same parameters. Ideally, several further studies would be beneficial; however, as esmolol is a well established, older drug, these are less likely to occur. Despite this, esmolol, as a fast-acting, rapidly reversible, easily titratable \u03b2-blocker, is an established option for the short-term treatment of tachyarrhythmias and the short-term control of tachycardia and hypertension.",

Smoking is an established risk factor for this malignancy but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Previous reports have provided evidence that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) and beta adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-AR) stimulate the growth and migration of pancreatic cancer cells. However, a potential cooperation of these two receptor families in the regulation of pancreatic cancer has not been studied to date. Using two pancreatic cancer cell lines and immortalized pancreatic duct epithelia in vitro, our current data show that all three cell lines synthesized and released the catecholamine neurotransmitters noradrenaline and adrenaline upon exposure to nicotine and that this activity was regulated by \u03b13, \u03b15, and \u03b17-nAChRs. In accordance with the established function of these catecholamines as \u03b2-AR agonists, nicotine-induced cell proliferation was blocked by the \u03b2-AR antagonist propranolol. Nicotine-induced proliferation was also abolished by the \u03b17-nAChR antagonist \u03b1-bungarotoxin, whereas catecholamine production in response to nicotine was blocked by gene knockdown of the \u03b13, \u03b15, and \u03b17-nAChRs. The nicotinic agonists acetylcholine, nicotine, and its nitrosated carcinogenic derivative NNK induced the phosphorylation of CREB, ERK, Src, and AKT and these responses were inhibited by propranolol.

Two kidney-one clip (2K-1C) renovascular hypertension was induced in 24 male Wistar rats (220-250 g). After the development of hypertension, rats were divided into four groups: 2K-1C (untreated), calcium channel blocker (amlodipine-treated), angiotensin receptor blocker (losartan-treated) and peripheral vasodilator (hydralazine-treated), which were treated for 10 weeks. Rats in the 2K-1C group had all developed hypertension, a significant increase in plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Moreover MA and creatininaemia underwent a significant increase. Under treatment decreases were observed in systolic blood pressure (SBP), TNF-alpha, CRP, IL-6, BNP concentrations and creatininaemia. These results were related to the absence of MA which was significantly associated with reductions in cardiac mass and hypertrophy markers (BNP and beta-MHC gene expression) as well as renal interstitial inflammation. In conclusion, our results suggest that the reduction of MA is correlated with the decrease of the inflammatory components and seems to play an important role in protecting against cardiac hypertrophy and renal injury.", 
    "76": "Recent guidelines are consistent in acknowledging that most hypertensive patients need at least two drugs for optimal blood pressure (BP) control. Trial data are available to support the use of a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker (ie, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker), plus a diuretic, a RAS blocker plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a CCB plus a diuretic. The ACCOMPLISH trial demonstrated somewhat convincingly that an ACE inhibitor/CCB is superior to the same ACE inhibitor plus a thiazide. In the ASCOT trial, amlodipine/perindopril was superior to beta-blocker/thiazide in its effects on all major cardiovascular outcomes and new-onset diabetes. Further substudies of ASCOT provided plausible explanations for the benefits of amlodipine/perindopril strategy. In the CAFE substudy, amlodipine/perindopril was significantly more effective in the reduction of central BP as compared to atenolol/bendroflumethiazide, despite similar brachial BP reduction. More recently, analysis of long-term BP variability provided a further explanation for the reduction of cardiovascular events with amlodipine/perindopril in ASCOT. Thus, the combination of perindopril and amlodipine seems an ideal logical evidence-based pair of antihypertensive agents to select.",

Because of encouraging results reported with beta-blockers in the treatment of pediatric capillary hemangiomas, the patient was subsequently started on oral propranolol, 2 mg/kg/day, with discontinuation of steroids and tacrolimus. A rapid and impressive interval decrease in tumor size was observed, with improvement in proptosis and exposure keratopathy.

Within the tumor microenvironment, \u03b2-adrenergic receptors on tumor and stromal cells are activated by catecholamines from local sympathetic nerve fibers (norepinephrine) and circulating blood (epinephrine). Tumor-associated macrophages are emerging as key targets of \u03b2-adrenergic regulation in several cancer contexts. Sympathetic nervous system regulation of cancer cell biology and the tumor microenvironment has clarified the molecular basis for long-suspected relationships between stress and cancer progression, and now suggests a highly leveraged target for therapeutic intervention. Epidemiologic studies have linked the use of \u03b2-blockers to reduced rates of progression for several solid tumors, and preclinical pharmacologic and biomarker studies are now laying the groundwork for translation of \u03b2-blockade as a novel adjuvant to existing therapeutic strategies in clinical oncology.",

Speciality societies, most importantly, the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation, have promulgated guidelines for perioperative \u03b2-blockade, which have been revised, as the evidence has changed. While the European guidelines continue to emphasize perioperative \u03b2-blockade in high-risk patients, the American guidelines have reduced the strength and breadth of recommendations, focusing on haemodynamic titration. Future work will need to focus on identifying populations most likely to benefit or to be harmed, including pharmacogenetic analyses and distinctions between individual \u03b2-blockers.", 
    "85": "To interfere with the drug-cue memory processes of addicts such as reconsolidation by the administration of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) of norepinephrine (NE) antagonist propranolol (PRO) has become a potential therapy in the future to decrease or inhibit relapse. However, the relationship between PRO and the acquisition or retrieval of morphine-cue memory is not clear. This study examined the effects of PRO on the acquisition and retrieval of memories in morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) mice model. We found that during memory acquisition period, PRO had no effects on the expression and extinction of morphine-CPP, which suggests that the \u03b2-AR was irrelevant to the CPP memory acquisition. However, during memory retrieval period, although PRO did not affect the expression of CPP, but it delayed the occurrence of CPP extinction, which indicates that PRO has an inhibit effect on CPP memory extinction, and \u03b2-AR plays an important role in modulating the extinction of morphine-CPP. Our study further improved the relationship between drug addiction and \u03b2-AR, and proposed a new theory to help developing potential therapy to cure addiction and other neuropsychiatric disorders.", 
    "86": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a prevalent smoking-related disease for which no disease-altering therapies currently exist. As dysregulated TGF-\u03b2 signaling associates with lung pathology in patients with COPD and in animal models of lung injury induced by chronic exposure to cigarette smoke (CS), we postulated that inhibiting TGF-\u03b2 signaling would protect against CS-induced lung injury. We first confirmed that TGF-\u03b2 signaling was induced in the lungs of mice chronically exposed to CS as well as in COPD patient samples. Importantly, key pathological features of smoking-associated lung disease in patients, e.g., alveolar injury with overt emphysema and airway epithelial hyperplasia with fibrosis, accompanied CS-induced alveolar cell apoptosis caused by enhanced TGF-\u03b2 signaling in CS-exposed mice. Systemic administration of a TGF-\u03b2-specific neutralizing antibody normalized TGF-\u03b2 signaling and alveolar cell death, conferring improved lung architecture and lung mechanics in CS-exposed mice. Use of losartan, an angiotensin receptor type 1 blocker used widely in the clinic and known to antagonize TGF-\u03b2 signaling, also improved oxidative stress, inflammation, metalloprotease activation and elastin remodeling. These data support our hypothesis that inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling through angiotensin receptor blockade can attenuate CS-induced lung injury in an established murine model. More importantly, our findings provide a preclinical platform for the development of other TGF-\u03b2-targeted therapies for patients with COPD.", 
    "87": "Ophthalmic drug delivery through eye drops is inefficient because of low corneal bioavailability and short residence time in tears. Contact lenses are ideally suited for extended and targeted drug delivery to cornea, but commercial contact lenses release ophthalmic drugs for only 1-2 h. This study focuses on dispersing timolol encapsulating highly crosslinked nanoparticles in contact lenses to increase the duration of drug release from 1 to 2 h to about 2-4 weeks. The highly crosslinked particles were prepared from monomers with multivinyl functionalities such as EGDMA (ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) and PGT (propoxylated glyceryl triacylate). The nanoparticles were about 3.5 nm in size and encapsulated 48-66% of the drug depending on the composition. Drug release studies in a diffusion cell showed that the particles released the drug for a period of about 4 weeks. The drug loaded particles were dispersed in hydroxy methyl methacrylate (HEMA) gels, which are common contact lens materials. The particle loaded gels release timolol in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 2-4 weeks at therapeutic dose, which is promising for extended drug release applications. The proposed mechanism of drug transport is hydrolysis of ester bonds that link timolol to the particle matrix which form during the particle formation process. The drug release profiles can be described by a first order reaction model with a temperature dependent rate constant. The rate constant of ester hydrolysis was significantly smaller than that in previous studies on timolol esters possibly due to steric effects and the low water content of the highly crosslinked hydrophobic particles. The results of this study provide evidences that contact lenses loaded with nanoparticles could be very useful for extended delivery of ophthalmic drugs.",

In the present study, we investigated whether probenecid could exert an anti-hypertensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The noninvasive indirect tail cuff method was employed to measure blood pressure and heart rate. The administration of probenecid (50 mg/kg, ip) induced a significant systolic blood pressure (SBP) decrease, from 167 mmHg to 141 mmHg, within 120 min. In contrast, probenecid had little effect on normotensive control Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). The anti-hypertensive effects of probenecid are almost as potent as those of atenolol. In a further exploration of the anti-hypertensive mechanisms of probenecid, its effects on phenylephrine-induced blood vessel contraction were tested. Our results suggest that probenecid significantly inhibited the contractions of rat aorta. This effect was also observed with endothelium-removed rat aorta, suggesting that probenecid can directly interact with the \u03b1-adrenergic receptor. Moreover, probenecid inhibited the \u03b1-adrenergic-receptor-mediated activation of ERK I/II in MC3TC-E1 cells. Therefore, our results indicate that probenecid might alleviate high blood pressure in SHR via inhibition of the \u03b1-adrenergic receptor and ERK I/II.",

An inhibitory influence of the LSA on baroreflex activity has been reported; however, the local neurotransmitter involved in this modulation is still unclear. In the present study, we verified the involvement of local LSA adrenoceptors in modulating cardiac baroreflex activity in unanaesthetized rats. Bilateral microinjection of the selective \u03b1(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist WB4101 (10 nmol in a volume of 100 nl) into the LSA decreased baroreflex bradycardia evoked by blood pressure increases, but had no effect on reflex tachycardia evoked by blood pressure decreases. Nevertheless, bilateral administration of the selective \u03b1(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist RX821002 (10 nmol in 100 nl) increased baroreflex tachycardia without affecting reflex bradycardia. Treatment of the LSA with a cocktail containing WB4101 and RX821002 decreased baroreflex bradycardia and increased reflex tachycardia. The non-selective \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (10 nmol in 100 nl) did not affect either reflex bradycardia or tachycardia. Microinjection of noradrenaline into the LSA increased reflex bradycardia and decreased the baroreflex tachycardic response, an opposite effect compared with those observed after double blockade of \u03b1(1)- and \u03b1(2)-adrenoceptors, and this effect of noradrenaline was blocked by local LSA pretreatment with the cocktail containing WB4101 and RX821002. The present results provide advances in our understanding of the baroreflex neural circuitry. Taken together, data suggest that local LSA \u03b1(1)- and \u03b1(2)-adrenoceptors modulate baroreflex control of heart rate differently. Data indicate that LSA \u03b1(1)-adrenoceptors exert a facilitatory modulation on baroreflex bradycardia, whereas local \u03b1(2)-adrenoceptors exert an inhibitory modulation on reflex tachycardia.",

This analysis shows that change in heart rate is a major component of the cardiovascular system's ability to adjust cardiac output and a number of regulatory systems control heart rate. When heart rate responses are limited because of disease or pharmacologic reasons, changes in stroke volume must compensate, but the capacity to do so is limited by the passive filling characteristics of the ventricles.

ST2 was measured with a novel high-sensitivity immunoassay. During a median follow-up time of 33.4 months, 244 of the 891 participants in the study (mean age 70.2 years at baseline) died. In the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, both ST2 and NTproBNP significantly predicted the risk of death. The individual inclusion of ST2 and NTproBNP in the model with established mortality risk factors significantly improved the C statistic for predicting death [0.79 (0.76-0.81); P < 0.001].

The aim of this study was to determine whether cutaneous blood vessels were regulated in the caudal fin during the initial transition from water to aerial exposure, and after 10 days of aerial acclimation. Acute changes (first 3 min following emersion) in the cutaneous vessels diameter were measured in real-time on live fish using light microscopy. The data show that under control conditions, only arterioles in the caudal fin were vasoactive. During the first 20s of aerial acclimation the arterioles significantly constricted (-2.1 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcm), which was followed immediately by a relaxation (from 40 to 180 s). This vasoconstriction was eliminated with the addition of phentolamine (50 \u03bcmoll(-1)), which indicates that the vasoconstriction was mediated by \u03b1-adrenoreceptors. Longer-term changes in the cutaneous surface vasculature were determined using fluorescent immunohistochemistry and antibodies for the endothelial marker, CD31. Fish aerially acclimated for 10 days exhibited significantly higher levels of endothelial fluorescence in the caudal fin when compared to control fish in water, indicating endothelial cell production (i.e. angiogenesis). These data combined show that for every emersion episode, there is an initial \u03b1-adrenergic mediated vasoconstriction, which is most likely, a stress response. This is then followed by a long-term acclimation involving an upregulation in endothelial cell production, which would subsequently enhance blood perfusion to the cutaneous surface and potentially increase the capacity for gas exchange with the external environment.",

Specifically, we targeted the crystal structures solved in complex with carazolol (2RH1), the neutral antagonist alprenalol, the irreversible agonist FAUC50 (3PDS), and the full agonist BI-167017 (3P0G). Our results indicate that activated structures favor agonists over blockers, whereas inactive structures favor blockers over agonists. This tendency is more marked for activated than for inactive structures. Additionally, agonists tend to receive more favorable docking scores when docked at activated rather than inactive structures, while blockers do the opposite. Hence, the difference between the docking scores attained with an activated and an inactive structure is an excellent means for the classification of ligands into agonists and blockers as we determined through receiver operating characteristic curves and linear discriminant analysis. With respect to virtual screening, all structures prioritized well agonists and blockers over nonbinders. However, inactive structures worked better for blockers and activated structures worked better for agonists, respectively. Notably, the combination of individual docking experiments through receptor ensemble docking resulted in an excellent performance in the retrieval of both agonists and blockers. Finally, we demonstrated that the induced-fit docking of agonists is a viable way of modifying an inactive crystal structure and bias it toward the in silico recognition of agonists rather than blockers.", 
    "125": "The noradrenergic system plays a critical role in the 'consolidation' of emotional memory. If we are to target 'reconsolidation' in patients with anxiety disorders, the noradrenergic strengthening of fear memory should not impair the disruption of reconsolidation. In Experiment I, we addressed this issue using a differential fear conditioning procedure allowing selective reactivation of one of two fear associations. First, we strengthened fear memory by administering an \u03b1(2)-adrenergic receptor antagonist (ie, yohimbine HCl; double-blind placebo-controlled study) 30 min before acquisition (time for peak value yohimbine HCl <1 h). Next, the reconsolidation of one of the fear associations was manipulated by administering a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist (ie, propranolol HCl) 90 min before its selective reactivation (time for peak value propranolol HCl <2 h). In Experiment II, we administered propranolol HCl after reactivation of the memory to rule out a possible effect of the pharmacological manipulation on the memory retrieval itself. The excessive release of noradrenaline during memory formation not only delayed the process of extinction 48 h later, but also triggered broader fear generalization. Yet, the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker during reconsolidation selectively 'neutralized' the fear-arousing aspects of the noradrenergic-strengthened memory and undermined the generalization of fear. We observed a similar reduction in fear responding when propranolol HCl was administered after reactivation of the memory. The present findings demonstrate the involvement of noradrenergic modulation in the formation as well as generalization of human fear memory. Given that the noradrenergic strengthening of fear memory impaired extinction learning but not the disruption of reconsolidation, our findings may have implications for the treatment of anxiety disorders.",

This is a condition with low incidence and prevalence, diagnosed through imaging techniques such as Doppler echocardiogram (DE), multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Clinically, it may be asymptomatic or manifested by cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure or thromboembolism. This is a report on a 33 year old asymptomatic man who suffered a blow on his chest (commotio cordis) during a sports competition that produced a cardiac arrest. The electrocardiogram showed ventricular flutter that required electrical defibrillation. A DE obtained initially, did not show any significant abnormality, but another DE, a MSCT and a RMN obtained after discharge, certified isolated non-compacted myocardium, ruling out coronary artery disease. He received beta blocker and antiplatelet therapy and the placement of an automatic cardioverter defibrillator was considered. The pathophysiology of the association of these two infrequent and potentially lethal conditions is discussed.",

Only two of them presented dilated cardiomyopathy. There were no congenital structural defects. Amiodarone was given to all the patients, as single therapy in one, and in combination with propranolol in four. In one patient flecainide was administered together with amiodarone and propranolol, and in another patient was used combined with amiodarone. During follow- up with an average time of 12.2 months (median 9.75 months, range 1-28 months), sinus rhythm alternating with slow junctional tachycardia was successfully achieved in 3 patients; no side effects were detected. There was only one death in our study group. The combination of different antiarrhythmics (amiodarone plus propranolol, and eventually flecainide) is a valid option for rhythm control and management of JET in infants.",

    "150": "Although metoprolol is used to treat hypertension, clinical responses are variable and unpredictable. Evidence suggests that adrenergic beta1 receptor (ADRB1, designated Adrb1 in rodents) gene polymorphisms influence the level of blood pressure response to this drug therapy, but their presence can not predict the response of the individual patient. The question exists whether epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation could cause changes in the gene's expression that are a determining factor in metoprolol's efficacy. The aim of this study was to verify whether DNA methylation could change the expression of the ADRB1 gene, and epigenetic modification could explain why individuals with identical ADRB1 gene polymorphisms have different antihypertensive responses to metoprolol. H9c2 rat myocardial cells in vitro were randomly divided into 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine)-treated (0.5 to 10.0 microM) and control groups. For the in vivo experiments, 45 spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were divided into metoprolol-treated and control groups, and after a 4-week intervention myocardia were harvested. Genomic methylation-sensitive PCR was used to assess the methylation status of the Adrb1 promoter after DNA extraction from H9c2 cells and SHR myocardia. Real-time fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine levels ofAdrb1 mRNA. In H9c2 cells, the least degree of methylation was observed in the 5.0 microM decitabine treated group. Prolonged exposure of cells to 5.0 microM decitabine resulted in downregulating methylation of the Adrb1 promoter. Increased levels of Adrb1 mRNA of the 5.0 microM group demonstrated that this concentration resulted in the highest expression. Accordingly, DNA methylation resulted in the downregulation of Adrb1 transcription. In vivo, the lower level of methylation of the Adrb1 promoter from SHR myocardial samples demonstrated a better antihypertensive effect by metoprolol. The expression of Adrb1 mRNA in the effective group of SHRs was significantly upregulated. In conclusion, as shown in both H9c2 cells and SHRs, downregulated methylation of the Adrb1 promoter is likely to improve the antihypertensive efficacy of metoprolol.", 
    "151": "Although inhaled bronchodilators are commonly used in the treatment of airway disease to dilate airway smooth muscle, little is known regarding the mechanisms that regulate albuterol movement across the epithelium to reach its target, the airway smooth muscle. Because the rate of onset depends on the transepithelial transport of albuterol, to determine the mechanisms that regulate the transepithelial movement of albuterol is essential. Human bronchial epithelial cells, fully redifferentiated in culture at the air-liquid interface, were used to study the cellular uptake and total transepithelial flux of (3)H-albuterol from the apical to the basolateral surfaces. (3)H-mannitol and transepithelial electrical resistance were used to quantify changes in paracellular permeability. The majority of albuterol flux across the epithelium occurred via the paracellular route. The cellular uptake of albuterol was found to be saturable, whereas transepithelial flux was not. Cellular uptake could be inhibited by the amino acids lysine and histidine, with no effect on net transepithelial flux. Transepithelial flux was altered by maneuvers that collapsed or disrupted intercellular junctions. Acidification, usually seen in exacerbations of airway disease, decreased albuterol flux. In addition, albuterol increased its own paracellular permeability. The ability of albuterol to modulate paracellular permeability was blocked by the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor-selective antagonist ICI 118551. Albuterol mainly crosses the epithelium via the paracellular pathway, but has the ability to modulate its own permeability through changes in the leakiness of tight junctions, which is modulated through the signaling of the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor.",

The activities of CYP1A2, 2\u2009C9, 2D6 and 3A4 were measured using specific probe drugs. After pretreatment for 1\u2009week with PNS or physiological saline (control group), probe drugs caffeine (10\u2009mg/kg; CYP1A2 activity), tolbutamide (15\u2009mg/kg; CYP2C9 activity), metoprolol (20\u2009mg/kg; CYP2D6 activity) and dapsone (10\u2009mg/kg; CYP3A4 activity) were administered to rats by intraperitoneal injection. The blood was then collected at different times for ultra performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis. The data showed that PNS exhibited an induction effect on CYP1A2 by decreasing caffeine C(max) (36.3%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and AUC(0-\u221e) (22.77%, p\u2009<\u20090.05) and increasing CL/F (27.03%, p\u2009<\u20090.05) compared with those of the control group. Western blot analysis was used to detect the effect of PNS on the protein level of CYP1A2, and the results showed that PNS could upregulate the protein expression of CYP1A2. However, no significant changes in CYP2C9, 2D6 or 3A4 activities were observed. In conclusion, the results indicate that PNS could induce CYP1A2, which may affect the disposition of medicines primarily dependent on the CYP1A2 pathway.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chronic \u03b2-blockade on transient outward, sustained and inward rectifier K(+) currents (I(TO), I(KSUS) and I(K1)) in human atrial myocytes and on the expression of underlying ion channel subunits. Ion currents were recorded from human right atrial isolated myocytes using the whole-cell-patch clamp technique. Tissue mRNA and protein levels were measured using real time RT-PCR and Western blotting. Chronic \u03b2-blockade was associated with a 41% reduction in I(TO) density: 9.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 (30 myocytes, 15 patients) vs 15.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1\u00a0pA/pF (32, 14), p\u2009<\u20090.05; without affecting its voltage-, time- or rate dependence. I(K1) was reduced by 34% at -120\u00a0mV (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Neither I(KSUS), nor its increase by acute \u03b2-stimulation with isoprenaline, was affected by chronic \u03b2-blockade. Mathematical modelling suggested that the combination of I(TO)- and I(K1)-decrease could result in a 28% increase in APD(90). Chronic \u03b2-blockade did not alter mRNA or protein expression of the I(TO) pore-forming subunit, Kv4.3, or mRNA expression of the accessory subunits KChIP2, KChAP, Kv\u03b21, Kv\u03b22 or frequenin. There was no reduction in mRNA expression of Kir2.1 or TWIK to account for the reduction in I(K1). A reduction in atrial I(TO) and I(K1) associated with chronic \u03b2-blocker treatment in patients may contribute to the associated action potential prolongation, and this cannot be explained by a reduction in expression of associated ion channel subunits.",

    "163": "Euthermia is critical for mammalian homeostasis. Circuits within the preoptic hypothalamus regulate temperature, with fine control exerted via descending GABAergic inhibition of presympathetic motor neurons that control brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis and cutaneous vascular tone. The thermoregulatory role of hypothalamic excitatory neurons is less clear. Here we report peptidergic regulation of preoptic glutamatergic neurons that contributes to temperature regulation. Tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39) is a ligand for the parathyroid hormone 2 receptor (PTH2R). Both peptide and receptor are abundant in the preoptic hypothalamus. Based on PTH2R and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGlut2) immunolabeling in animals with retrograde tracer injection, PTH2R-containing glutamatergic fibers are presynaptic to neurons projecting from the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) to the dorsomedial hypothalamus. Transneuronal retrograde pathway tracing with pseudorabies virus revealed connectivity between MnPO VGlut2 and PTH2R neurons and BAT. MnPO injection of TIP39 increased body temperature by 2\u00b0C for several hours. Mice lacking TIP39 signaling, either because of PTH2R-null mutation or brain delivery of a PTH2R antagonist had impaired heat production upon cold exposure, but no change in basal temperature and no impairment in response to a hot environment. Thus, TIP39 appears to act on PTH2Rs present on MnPO glutamatergic terminals to regulate their activation of projection neurons and subsequent sympathetic BAT activation. This excitatory mechanism of heat production appears to be activated on demand, during cold exposure, and parallels the tonic inhibitory GABAergic control of body temperature.",

Cardiovascular mortality at 60 months was 12%; standardized mortality ratio was 5.9 for women and 6.8 for men. The remaining 38 patients (37% of total deaths, 30 men, age at diagnosis 70 \u00b1 10) died of noncardiovascular causes. Overall, noncardiovascular mortality at 60 months was 7.2%; mean survival time from diagnosis to death was 63 \u00b1 69 months (median 42, Q1 = 27.5, Q3 = 77.7). Average cardiovascular admission rate was 1.63 \u00b1 1.84 admissions/patient. At multivariate analysis, only previous history of myocardial infarction [hazard ratio: 3.62 (1.70-7.73)], class of ejection fraction at diagnosis [hazard ratio: 0.36 (0.32-0.60)], acute cardiac decompensation at any time [hazard ratio: 1.55 (1.32-1.84)], implanted defibrillator [hazard ratio: 0.11 (0.01-0.83)] and use of statins [hazard ratio: 0.08 (0.007-0.42)] were independently associated with cardiovascular mortality. Factors associated to higher annual cardiovascular morbidity were age at diagnosis, chronic renal failure, diabetes, cardiac decompensation at any time, female sex and diuretic therapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or angiotensin-receptor-blockers reduced annual cardiovascular morbidity.", 
    "184": "Survival in mild/moderate heart failure patients has consistently improved. Further improvements are warranted in terms of morbidity reduction.", 
    "185": "It is still controversial whether intravenous administration of \u03b2-blocker in the very acute phase of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is beneficial. Landiolol is an ultra-short-acting \u03b2-blocker that has less effect on blood pressure, but little is known about its efficacy and safety for patients with AMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).", 
    "186": "A consecutive 96 patients with AMI not manifesting cardiogenic shock were prospectively randomized to landiolol (n = 47) or a control group (n = 49). Continuous administration of landiolol (3 \u00b5g\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) for 24 h) was done just after PCI in the landiolol group, but not in the control group. Heart rate decreased by 9.4 \u00b1 1.7 beats/min after initiation of landiolol (P<0.01), but was unchanged in the control group. Left ventricular ejection fraction assessed 6 months later was greater than that at 2 weeks in the landiolol group (52.0 \u00b1 1.5 vs. 49.1 \u00b1 1.5%, P = 0.01), but remained unchanged in the control group. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume index assessed 6 months later was increased compared with that at 2 weeks in the control group (78.0 \u00b1 2.7 vs. 72.5 \u00b1 2.8 ml/m(2), P = 0.02), whereas it was unchanged in the landiolol group.", 
    "187": "Early intravenous administration of landiolol in patients with AMI undergoing PCI is safe and has the potential to improve cardiac function and inhibit cardiac remodeling in the chronic phase.", 
    "188": "We sought to investigate the effect of beta-blocker (BB) up-titration on serum levels of NT-proBNP and copeptin in patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced (HFREF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF).", 
    "189": "Serial measurements of NT-proBNP and copeptin were obtained after initiation of BB up-titration in 219 elderly patients with HFREF or HFPEF.", 
    "190": "After initial increasing trend of NT-proBNP at 6 weeks in HFREF patients, there was a subsequent decrease at 12 weeks of BB treatment up-titration (p=0.003), while no difference was found compared to baseline levels. In contrast to NT-proBNP, there was a continuous decreasing trend of copeptin in HFREF patients (at 12 weeks: p=0.026). In HFPEF patients, NT-proBNP significantly decreased (p=0.043) compared to copeptin after 12 weeks of BB up-titration.", 
    "191": "After 12 weeks of BB optimization copeptin might reflect successful up-titration faster than NT-proBNP in HFREF, while the opposite was found in patients with HFPEF."
