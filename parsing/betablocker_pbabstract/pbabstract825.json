    "0": "1. Thermal stimulation of frog skin produces a discharge in afferents in the dorsocutaneous nerve. The characteristics of this response have been examined with regard to static and dynamic sensitivity to thermal stimuli and to mechanical sensitivity. Frog cutaneous receptors respond only to cooling, with no response to warming through the same thermal range.2. The static temperature at which these receptors are maximally active is about 24 degrees C for Rana pipiens and about 27 degrees C for R. catesbiana.3. The dynamic sensitivity of frog cutaneous receptors is linearly related to both stimulus slope and magnitude. Maximum dynamic sensitivity was between -90 and -120 impulses/ degrees C.sec.4. Antidromic occlusion experiments demonstrate relative insensitivity of these receptors to tonic mechanical stimulation. At high stimulus intensities, however, larger fibres are recruited into the response; this recruitment of action potentials of larger amplitude is a linear function of both stimulus slope and magnitude.5. Spike heights are linearly related to conduction velocities in the dorsocutaneous nerve; tonic mechanoreceptors have a mean spike height of 28.4+/-0.6 muV and conduction velocities about 6-8 m/sec, whereas these temperature sensitive receptors have spike heights 15.8+/-0.4 muV and conduction velocities about 3-4 m/sec.6. Maximum dynamic sensitivity skin is increased following stimulation of the first or second sympathetic ganglion. This increase is both marked and progressive, reaching a maximal enhancement of about 150-160% control at a stimulus rate of 5 stimuli/train, each train delivered once every 5 sec.7. Static sensitivity of the cold receptors is also increased following sympathetic stimulation. This increased sensitivity is shown by both increased discharge rate within the same thermal range and by decreased temperature of maximum static sensitivity.8. Sympathetic modulation of dynamic thermal sensitivity is mimicked by epinephrine and norepinephrine in doses of 10(-6)-10(-7) g/ml. Ephedrine, another adrenergic agonist, also mimics the enhancement of cold receptors by sympathetic stimulation.9. Larger fibres are recruited to account for the increased sensitivity of thermoreceptors following sympathetic stimulation and epinephrine application.10. Propranolol and phentolamine both block the enhancement of the response by sympathetic stimulation, but propranolol blocks the response of the receptor to thermal stimulation as well. Reserpine pre-treatment blocks the effect of sympathetic stimulation on the cold response.", 
    "1": "1 Thermic oedema induced by heating rat paws at 46.5 degrees C was potentiated by local injection of adrenaline, noradrenaline or high doses of isoprenaline. The pro-inflammatory effect of sympathomimetic amines was antagonized by phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine but not by propranolol.2 The subcutaneous space of heated rat paws was perfused with Tyrode solution and the perfusate collected and assayed for bradykinin, bradykininogen, kinin-forming activity and kininase activity. When adrenaline (0.5 mug/ml) was included in the perfusion fluid, kininase activity of the perfusate was increased by 76% and free bradykinin reduced by 46%.3 Increased vascular permeability induced by injection of bradykinin or kallikrein was reduced by adrenaline or noradrenaline, but isoprenaline had no significant effect.4 Pretreatment with soya bean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) or heparin did not antagonize the pro-inflammatory effect of adrenaline or thermic oedema per se.5 Potentiation of thermic oedema similar to that induced by sympathomimetic amines was obtained by injecting paws with vasopressin prior to heating, or by applying a ligature to stop blood flow to the paw for the first 15 min of heating.6 Thermistor probes inserted beneath the paw skin showed that sympathomimetic amines increased the internal temperature of heated paws. This was significant, as small changes in temperature had a marked effect on the development of thermic oedema.7 It is suggested that sympathomimetic amines potentiate thermic oedema of rat paws heated at 46.5 degrees C by reducing blood flow to the paw, thereby causing a greater rise in paw temperature and consequently greater injury.", 
    "2": "Long-term treatment with propranolol was shown to produce a sustained suppression of the renin-aldosterone system in hypertensive patients, despite concurrent diuretic treatment. However, the antihypertensive effect of this treatment correlated poorly with its effects on plasma renin activity and urinary aldosterone excretion. When prindolol, another beta-adrenergic blocking drug, was substituted for propranolol, blood pressure control was retained, but there was a prompt rise in plasma renin activity, which was not attributable to changes in electrolyte balance. These observations suggest that the antihypertensive action of propranolol and other beta-blockers does not result from their effects on plasma renin activity.", 
    "3": "This paper deals with the influence of G forces on certain circulatory and metabolic adjustments to dynamic exercise. Leg exercise in the sitting position increases systemic mean pressure both at normal and at increased G, thus improving G tolerance. When the force of gravity is increased to three times its normal value, leg exercise produces a much more marked increment in stroke volume than in heart rate, which contrasts with the case at normal gravity. Beta-adrenergic blockade, which strongly inhibits the heart rate response to gravitational stress, but leaves the systemic mean pressure and G tolerance unaffected, exaggerates the dominance of the stroke volume increase in exercise at increased G. With leg exercise at increasing work loads at 3G, the O2 uptake tends to level off and the arterial lactates to rise at a lower load than at normal gravity, indicating that the upper limit for the O2 uptake is lowered by the G force. A progressive increase of the venous admixture in the lungs suggests that the primary limitation of the O2 transport occurs in the pulmonary gas exchange.", 
    "4": "An in vivo study of skeletal muscle paralysis induced by intravenous barium chloride has been made in curarized and non-curarized rats. The influence of potassium and calcium chlorides, propranolol, ouabain, and prior adrenalectomy on the paralysis has also been studied. Paralysis is found to be due to a direct effect on skeletal muscle, and to correlate well with the development of hypokalaemia. Possible mechanisms of action of barium are discussed, and attention is drawn to the similarity between barium poisoning and hypokalaemic familial periodic paralysis.", 
    "5": "Changes in the plasma free fatty acids of a pancreatectomized subject and in free fatty acids and insulin in 10 normal subjects in response to the in vivo infusion of epinephrine alone, epinephrine plus phentolamine, and epinephrine plus propranolol indicate that both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors are present in human adipose tissue. Under the experimental conditions used, adipose tissue appeared to be more responsive to epinephrine than did the cardiovascular system."
