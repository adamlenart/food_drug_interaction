Although the rhythmic properties of NAT and melatonin are similar in pineal gland and retina, great differences in the light perception and transmission mechanisms exist. We have analyzed the effects of adrenergic and dopaminergic agents on greenfrog (Rana perezi) eyecup culture, in order to identify the receptors involved in the regulation of retinal melatonin synthesis. A D2-like receptor is directly involved in the regulation of NAT activity and melatonin release in R. perezi retina. Quinpirole mimics the effect of light, reducing the darkness-stimulated NAT activity and melatonin release, while sulpiride antagonized these actions. Neither D1-agonist (SKF 38393) nor D1-antagonist (SCH 23390) had effect on NAT activity. However, a significant inhibition of darkness-evoked melatonin release was produced by SKF 38393 after 6 hours of culture. The beta- and antagonist1-agonists showed a clear inhibition. However, a direct effect of beta, alpha1 and D1-agonists on photoreceptors is unproven, being more probable that the adrenergic actions imply a non-photoreceptor retinal cell. In conclusion, eyecup culture of Rana perezi revealed a dopaminergic control of melatonin synthesis and a possible modulation of dopaminergic tone by adrenergic receptors. Melatonin release is a more sensitive parameter than NAT activity to the action of neuroactive agents, suggesting that melatonin synthesis can be regulated by more than one enzymatic step in Rana perezi.", 
    "1": "This prospective study was done to compare the control of heart rate and haemodynamics during coronary artery revascularisation without cardiopulmonary bypass using either esmolol or diltiazem. Sixty adult patients with one or two vessel coronary artery disease, were randomly divided into 2 equal groups. Group A received a 500 micrograms/kg loading dose of esmolol followed by a 100 micrograms/kg/h infusion, for control of heart rate during surgical anastomosis of the coronary vessel. While Group B received 0.15 mg/kg diltiazem as a loading dose followed by a 5 mg/h infusion for heart rate control, during the anastomosis. It was seen that heart rate control was better in Group A, 51.4 (+/- 1.3) beats/min, than in Group B, 69.6 (+/- 3.9) beats/min but the decrease in heart rate was significant in both the groups at peak effect compared to respective predrug values. Group A patients had unchanged systemic resistance and pulmonary artery wedge pressure but mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance were significantly raised. Group B patients had decreased systemic resistance, mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary artery wedge pressure, and reduced right ventricular stroke work index. We concluded that although esmolol provided dramatically slower heart rates, during surgery, the resulting elevations in mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance would require caution if used in patients with underlying right ventricular dysfunction from ischaemia or infarction. Diltiazem by virtue of its effects on systemic vascular resistance, cardiac output, and lowering of mean arterial pressure may be a better choice in hypertensive patients.",

Forty-seven normotensive subjects were similarly evaluated as control subjects.", 
    "5": "The FBF during reactive hyperemia in the 296 hypertensive patients was significantly less than that in age-matched normotensive subjects. The increase in FBF after administration of sublingual NTG was similar in both groups. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures and forearm vascular resistance were greater in the untreated group than in the four treated groups and did not differ with respect to the antihypertensive agent used. The maximal FBF response from reactive hyperemia was significantly greater in the ACE inhibitor-treated group than in the group treated with calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, diuretic agents, or nothing (40.5 +/- 5.2 vs. 32.9 +/- 5.8, 34.0 +/- 5.6, 32.1 +/- 5.9, and 31.9 +/- 5.8 ml/min per 100 ml tissue, p < 0.05, respectively). Reactive hyperemia was similar in the calcium antagonist, beta-blocker, diuretic and untreated groups, and changes in FBF after sublingual NTG administration were similar in all groups. The infusion of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, abolished the enhancement of reactive hyperemia in hypertensive patients treated with ACE inhibitors.",

Action potentials were measured in isolated left ventricular posterior papillary muscles and compared with action potentials from a sham operated group without infarction. After infarction, the action potential amplitude was reduced and this phenomenon was partially reversed by metoprolol- and ramipril-treatment. Prolonged repolarisation after infarction compared to sham operated animals was additionally delayed after metoprolol treatment. Thus, metoprolol extends the refractory period, which may counteract tachyarrhythmia.", 
    "8": "A recent study indicates that elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) enhances the release of calcein, an anionic fluorescent dye, from isolated exocrine acinar cells, so cytoplasmic calcein is useful for monitoring the secretion of organic anions. In this study, we investigated the effect of cAMP on the calcein release evoked by elevation of [Ca(2+)](i). Isoproterenol, forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) did not induce the release of calcein from isolated parotid acinar cells, but they potentiated the carbachol-induced release of calcein. Although cytoplasmic calcein is released through an increase in [Ca(2+)](i), isoproterenol potentiated the carbachol-induced release of calcein without affecting the increase in [Ca(2+)](i) evoked by a high concentration of carbachol (10(-6) M). Charybdotoxin, a K(+) channel blocker, inhibited both the carbachol-induced release and the potentiation by isoproterenol. However, the calcein permeation pathways mediating the carbachol-induced release and the isoproterenol-potentiated release exhibited distinct sensitivities to anion channel blockers. Our results indicate that the calcein release induced by carbachol is potentiated through an increase in intracellular levels of cAMP. Although both the Ca(2+)-activated release and the cAMP-potentiated release may be coupled to Ca(2+)-activated K(+) efflux, increases in both [Ca(2+)](i) and [cAMP](i) may activate the calcein conduction pathway which is not activated by an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) alone.",

In acidic medium, the release rate was much slower, however, the drug was released quickly at pH 7.4. Tacrine showed unexpected release profiles, probably due to ionic interaction with polymer matrix and the shell structure and the highest release rate was obtained at pH 2.0. The prepared microspheres had a sponge-like inner structure with or without central hollow core and the surface was dense with no apparent pores.", 
    "10": "1. The relative contributions of the rapid and slow components of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr and IKs, respectively) to dog cardiac action potential configuration were compared in ventricular myocytes and in multicellular right ventricular papillary muscle and Purkinje fibre preparations. Whole-cell patch-clamp techniques, conventional microelectrode and in vivo ECG measurements were made at 37C. 2. Action potential duration (APD) was minimally increased (less than 7%) by chromanol 293B (10 microM) and L-735,821 (100 nM), selective blockers of IKs, over a range of pacing cycle lengths (300-5000 ms) in both dog right ventricular papillary muscles and Purkinje fibre strands. D-Sotalol (30 microM) and E-4031 (1 microM), selective blockers of IKr, in the same preparations markedly (20-80%) lengthened APD in a reverse frequency-dependent manner. 3. In vivo ECG recordings in intact anaesthetized dogs indicated no significant chromanol 293B (1 mg kg-1 i.v.) effect on the QTc interval (332.9 +/- 16.1 ms before versus 330.5 +/- 11.2 ms, n = 6, after chromanol 293B), while D-sotalol (1 mg kg-1 i.v.) significantly increased the QTc interval (323.9 +/- 7.3 ms before versus 346.5 +/- 6.4 ms, n = 5, after D-sotalol, P < 0.05). 4. The current density estimated during the normal ventricular muscle action potential (i.e. after a 200 ms square pulse to +30 mV or during a 250 ms long 'action potential-like' test pulse) indicates that substantially more current is conducted through IKr channels than through IKs channels. However, if the duration of the square test pulse or the 'action potential-like' test pulse was lengthened to 500 ms the relative contribution of IKs significantly increased. 5. When APD was pharmacologically prolonged in papillary muscle (1 microM E-4031 and 1 microg ml-1 veratrine), 100 nM L-735,821 and 10 microM chromanol 293B lengthened repolarization substantially by 14.4 +/- 3.4 and 18. 0 +/- 3.4% (n = 8), respectively. 6. We conclude that in this study IKs plays little role in normal dog ventricular muscle and Purkinje fibre action potential repolarization and that IKr is the major source of outward current responsible for initiation of final action potential repolarization. Thus, when APD is abnormally increased, the role of IKs in final repolarization increases to provide an important safety mechanism that reduces arrhythmia risk.",

Isolated fractions of propranolol.HCl were positively identified by mass spectrometry, Beilstein flame test, melting point, and chemical analysis to be HCI enantiomers of propranolol-HCl salts exhibited characteristic mass spectra peaks at 36 and 38 mass-to-charge ratio in the expected 3:1 isotopic ratio for the solute that were absent in the mass spectra for the free-base forms.

    "12": "To determine if alterations in arterial pressure influenced fetal heart rate variability (HRV), experiments were carried out in chronically catheterized fetal sheep aged 128-138 d. Arterial pressure was raised or lowered by intravenous infusion of phenylephrine or sodium nitroprusside, and the effects on heart rate (HR) and HRV were measured (HRV, as the coefficient of variation (CV) in mean pulse interval or by power spectral analysis). Experiments were carried out before and during beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol or before and during cardiac vagal blockade with atropine. There were positive relationships between mean arterial pressure and HRV (slope = 0.074+/-0.001, r = 0.81+/-0.06, p<0.001, measured as the CV of pulse interval) and between mean arterial pressure and power spectral density (slope = 4+/-0.5, r = 0.89+/-0.02, p<0.001) in the frequency range 0.04-0.08 Hz. Beta-adrenoceptor blockade had no effect on these relationships, but they were abolished by cardiac vagal blockade. The sigmoid relationship between fetal HR and mean arterial pressure, i.e. the cardiac baroreflex, was affected, however, by blockade of cardiac sympathetics and abolished by blockade of cardiac vagal activity. Thus, fetal HRV was affected by alterations in arterial pressure, and these effects depended on the integrity of the cardiac vagus, not on alterations in cardiac sympathetic activity. Therefore, although baroreflex control of fetal HR depends on the integrity of both sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent pathways, baroreceptor-induced changes in HRV depend only on the cardiac vagus.", 
    "13": "The influences of the calmodulin antagonist chlorpromazine (CPZ), and calcium channel blocker nimodipine (NIMO) and their combination on cadmium (Cd) poisoning of mice were studied. A series of biochemical parameters including urinary enzyme activities, blood and urine Cd levels, metallothionein (MT) contents in liver and kidney, hepatic ultrastructure and Ca(2+)-Mg2+ ATPase activity in erythrocyte membrane were determined. Animal models for Cd poisoning were established by peritoneal injection of 1/5 LD50 CdCl2. The experimental groups were protected by administration of CPZ, NIMO and CPZ and NIMO in combination 1 h before the injection of CdCl2. Five days later, samples were collected for analysis. The data showed that CPZ could protect kidney tissue against Cd-induced damage, as the urinary gamma-glutamyl-traspeptidase (gamma-GT) and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activities were reduced significantly. There was neither evidence of the protective effect of NIMO on kidney tissue nor an indication of a synergistic effect of CPZ and NIMO. Both CPZ and NIMO showed a considerable protective effect against the decrease in Ca(2+)-Mg2+ ATPase activity, and a synergistic action was observed. Cd content in blood was reduced significantly by CPZ or the combination of CPZ and NIMO, but elevated by NIMO. Both CPZ and NIMO considerably increased MT contents in livers and kidneys and ameliorated damaged to the hepatic ultrastructures caused by Cd. The results indicated that these inhibitors could protect mice against the toxic effects of Cd in liver and kidney tissues, while CPZ was more efficient than NIMO. The combination of CPZ and NIMO exerted a synergistic action. The protective action of these two drugs might be relevant to the function of MT.", 
    "14": "Treated hypertensive subjects may remain five times more likely to die of cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases than normotensive subjects with equivalent resting blood pressure (BP) levels. Research evidence suggests that exercise BP is a better predictor of end-organ damage and mortality than resting BP, and data from our centre show that a significant proportion of treated hypertensives have uncontrolled BP during a 5-min Dundee Step Test. The prognostic usefulness of exercise BP has yet to be translated into clinical practice because of the lack of a suitable technique. The Dundee Step Test is being evaluated in the ASCOT (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcome Trial) study, a 5-year follow-up multicentre, multinational trial comparing the effect of newer (amlodipine and perindopril) and older (bendroflumethiazide and atenolol) antihypertensive agents stratified according to cholesterol levels on cardiac outcome. If the value of the Dundee Step Test is proven, then it may be adopted into routine clinical practice for the assessment of exercise BP. This may result in the improved management of hypertension with a subsequent reduction in morbidity and mortality.

Hypothesized mechanisms include normalization of beta-receptor function and myocardial protection from the effects of catecholamines, possibly by the institution of bradycardia. We hypothesized that beta-blockade-induced bradycardia was an important mechanism by which these agents were effective for correction of LV dysfunction.", 
    "20": "In 2 groups of dogs with mitral regurgitation and LV dysfunction, beta-blockers were instituted. In 1 group that received beta-blockers and pacing (group beta+P), a pacemaker prevented the natural bradycardia that beta-blockers cause. In both groups, substantial LV dysfunction developed. Before beta-blockade, the end-systolic stiffness constant decreased from 3. 5+/-0.1 to 2.7+/-0.2 (P<0.01) at 3 months in group beta+P. A similar reduction occurred in the group that eventually received only beta-blockers (group betaB). In group betaB, end-systolic stiffness improved after 3 months of beta-blockade from 2.9+/-0.2 to 3.5+/-0.4 and was not different from baseline. However, in group beta+P, end-systolic stiffness failed to improve (2.7+/-0.2) after 3 months of mitral regurgitation, and was 2.9+/-0.2 at the end of the studies. The contractile function of cardiocytes isolated from the ventricles at the end of the studies confirmed these in vivo estimates of contractility.",

Ninety-six rats were divided into two groups of 48. One group (CLP group) was treated with cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) and the other (sham group) was treated with laparotomy. The left hemidiaphragm was removed at 16 h after the operation. We assessed the diaphragmatic contractility by twitch characteristics and force-frequency curves in vitro. Diaphragm fatigue was induced by rhythmically stimulating strips to contract at 60/ min (20 Hz, 0.33-s trains, 1 train/s) over a 4-min period. Force-frequency curves were determined before and after fatigue. Isoproterenol (10(-9), 10(-8), and 10(-7) M), a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, was cumulatively administered to the organ bath. Isoproterenol significantly increased diaphragmatic contractility. There were no significant changes in diaphragmatic contractility in the sham group. Isoproterenol (10(-7) M) significantly accelerated diaphragmatic recovery of fatigue and increased cAMP levels both in the sham group and the CLP group. Propranolol (10(-7) M), a general beta-adrenoceptor blocker, completely abolished the positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol (10(-7) M) and increased cAMP levels in the CLP group. Dibutyryl cAMP (10(-3) M), a derivative of cyclic AMP, mimicked the effects of isoproterenol in the CLP group. These results suggest that isoproterenol increases diaphragmatic contractility and accelerates diaphragmatic recovery of fatigue in septic peritonitis by activating the adenylate cyclase system.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of treatment with a peripherally acting adrenergic blocking drug labetalol on the cardiovascular and subjective response to repeated deliveries of smoked cocaine. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 cocaine users were treated with a single 100 or 200 mg dose of labetalol, or placebo in each of three experimental sessions. Starting 2 h after the medication treatment, subjects received three doses of 0.4 mg/kg smoked cocaine, 30 min apart. Labetalol treatment significantly attenuated the cocaine-induced increases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure. This effect of labetalol on the cardiovascular response did not decrease with repeated cocaine deliveries. The subjective response to smoked cocaine deliveries was not affected by labetalol treatment. These results suggest that labetalol effectively attenuates the systolic blood pressure and heart rate increases induced by repeated doses of smoked cocaine, but does not alter subjective effects.",

Information on the effect of these drugs in the normal primate model is limited. The purpose of this study was first to determine the arrhythmogenic properties of cromakalim in the baboon and second to determine whether N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) has any effect on the induced arrhythmia. Adult (2-4 years old) baboons (Papio ursinus) were anesthetized with a continuous i.v. infusion of ketamine (100 mg/ ml), diazepam (5 mg/ml), and saline (ratio 2:2:50) at a rate of 40-60 ml/h. Sympathetic responses were inhibited by administration of propranolol (1 mg/kg) before the start of the experiments. Cromakalim (30 microg/kg) was administered before and after L-NAME (7.5 mg/kg), and the parameters were monitored for 15 min after each intervention. A Millar double-tipped microcatheter was used to record left ventricular and aortic pressures. Lead II of the ECG was monitored. During a 15-min period after administration of cromakalim, 22.3 +/- 6.0 abnormal ventricular complexes were recorded. L-NAME administration significantly reduced these abnormal complexes to 4.5 +/- 2 (paired t test, p < or = 0.05). We therefore conclude that cromakalim has arrhythmogenic properties in the baboon and that these can be attenuated by L-NAME.",

    "34": "Trypsin is widely expressed in various non-pancreatic tissues at low levels and overexpressed in some types of human cancers. In the present study, we found that trypsin stimulates integrin-dependent adhesion and growth of MKN-1 human gastric carcinoma cells. MKN-1 cells expressed both proteinase-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) and PAR-2, which are activated by thrombin and trypsin, respectively. Both trypsin and the PAR-2 ligand SLIGKV promoted integrin alpha(5)beta(1)-mediated adhesion of MKN-1 cells to fibronectin, and less effectively integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated cell adhesion to vitronectin, but not that to type IV collagen or laminin-1 at all. Thrombin and the PAR-1 ligand SFLLRN promoted the cell adhesion to vitronectin more strongly than trypsin or the PAR-2 ligand, but not the cell adhesion to fibronectin at all. The cell adhesion-stimulating effect of the PAR-2 ligand was significantly reduced by the pre-treatment of cells with trypsin, indicating that the effect of trypsin is mediated by PAR-2 activation. The trypsin-stimulated cell adhesion to vitronectin, but not to fibronectin, was effectively inhibited by the G(i) protein blocker pertussis toxin, and both cell adhesions were completely inhibited by the Src kinase inhibitor herbimycin A. Furthermore, trypsin and the PAR-2 ligand stimulated growth of MKN-1 cells more strongly than thrombin or the PAR-1 ligand. These results show that trypsin regulates cellular adhesion and proliferation by inducing PAR-2/G protein signalings, and that the integrin alpha(5)beta(1)- and integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-dependent cell adhesions are regulated by different PAR/G protein signalings.",

This was accompanied by marked attenuation of beta(1)-AR-mediated positive inotropic response in isolated perfused hearts in vitro (P<0.02) and in conscious SHRs monitored by telemetry in vivo (P<0.02). Furthermore, the blood pressure of SHRs was reduced for 20 days, with a 38 mm Hg maximum drop. Heart rate was not significantly decreased. Quantitative autoradiography was performed to assess beta(1)-AS-ODN effects on the CNS, which demonstrated no changes in beta(1)-ARs in brain, in contrast to a significant reduction in heart and kidney (P<0.05). For comparison with beta-blockers, the effects of atenolol on cardiovascular hemodynamics were examined, which lowered blood pressure for only 10 hours and elicited appreciable bradycardia in SHRs.",

HP-based granules were produced under carefully controlled conditions and compacted into matrix tablets having equivalent tablet thickness. Quantification of pore structure using mercury porosimetry showed that the tablets had substantially different pore volumes and pore size distributions. Dissolution studies demonstrated that release of a water-soluble model compound, benzamide, from swollen matrices was affected neither by total porosity nor median pore diameter of the initial dry matrix. To extend the concept of porosity-independent release further, HP-based formulations containing either diclofenac sodium or propranolol HCl were contained within hard gelatin capsules in the form of uncompacted granules. This produced a dosage form with a high intraparticulate porosity in the dry state. Equivalent weights of the same formulations were also compacted into tablets. The in vitro release profiles from matrix tablets compacted from any of the formulations did not differ significantly from release profiles obtained when the same materials were contained uncompacted in hard gelatin capsules.",

Saliva secretion was induced by the partial muscarinic receptor agonist pilocarpine (0.03-3 mg/kg) with or without pretreatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (2.5 mg/kg), or the full muscarinic receptor agonist methacholine (0.16-16 mg/min), and measured during 5 min per drug dose before and 1, 3, 6 and 10 days after irradiation. The maximal secretory response induced by pilocarpine plus propranolol was increased compared to that with pilocarpine alone but did not reach the level of methacholine-induced secretion, which was about five times higher. One day after irradiation a decrease in maximal pilocarpine-induced secretion was observed (-22%) using the same dose of pilocarpine that induces 50% of the maximal response (ED(50)), in both the absence and presence of propranolol, indicating that the receptor-drug interaction was not affected by the radiation at this time. The secretory response to methacholine 1 day after irradiation, however, was normal. At day 3 after irradiation, the maximal methacholine-induced secretion was also affected, whereas pilocarpine (+/-propranolol)-induced maximal secretion decreased further. At day 6 after irradiation, maximal secretory responses had declined to approximately 50% regardless of the agonist used, whereas ED(50) values were still unaffected. No net acinar cell loss was observed within the first 10 days after irradiation, and this therefore could not account for the loss in function. The results indicate that radiation does not affect cell number or receptor-drug interaction, but rather signal transduction, which eventually leads to the impaired response. We hypothesize that the early radiation effect, within 3 days, may be membrane damage affecting the receptor-G-protein signaltransfer. Later critical damage, however, is probably of a different nature and may be located in the second-messenger signal transduction pathway downstream from the G protein, not necessarily involving cellular membranes.", 
    "43": "Electrical field stimulation (EFS) caused contraction of isolated tail arteries of rats. The EFS-induced contraction showed frequency-dependence and was entirely abolished by the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (1 x 10(-7) M). The EFS-induced (at 20 Hz) contraction was reduced by about 60% in the presence of phentolamine (1 x 10(-6) M). Therefore, later experiments were carried out in the presence of phentolamine. Pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS) (1 x 10(-8)-1 x 10(-6) M) and basilen blue E-3G (3 x 10(-5)-5 x 10(-5) M), P2-receptor antagonists, significantly inhibited the contraction evoked by EFS. In addition, PPADS significantly inhibited the contractions induced by ATP (1 x 10(-4) M) and a selective P2x-receptor agonist, alpha,beta-methylene ATP (1 x 10(-6) M). In contrast, basilen blue E-3G did not inhibit alpha,beta-methylene ATP-induced contraction. The ecto-ATPase activator apyrase (5 and 10 U/ml) significantly reduced the EFS-induced contractions. These findings suggest that endogenous ATP released by EFS causes contractions of rat tail artery via both the P2x-receptors and P2y-receptors.", 
    "44": "There has been recent debate regarding the labile nature of stonefish venoms and the pharmacology of their breakdown products. The present study examined the cardiovascular and neuromuscular effects of lyophilised venom, and conducted a preliminary investigation of freshly milked venom. Lyophilised venom (20 microg/ml) caused endothelium-dependent relaxation in rat aortae that was abolished by atropine (0.1 microM). In contrast, an endothelium-independent contractile response occurred in porcine coronary arteries. However, in the presence of atropine (10 nM), this became a relaxation response which was attenuated by the B2 antagonist FR-173657 (0.1 microM) or by a combination of idazoxan (1 microM) and propranolol (1 microM). In rat isolated atria, lyophilised venom (4 microg/ml) caused a biphasic inotropic response consisting of an initial decrease, and then increase, in force which were attenuated by atropine (0.5 microM) and propranolol (5 microM), respectively. The increase in force produced by venom was unaffected by reserpine pre-treatment suggesting a direct action at adrenoceptors. In the anaesthetised rat, lyophilised venom (1-300 microg/kg, i.v.), caused a dose-dependent depressor response, with a subsequent pressor response at higher concentrations (30-300 microg/kg, i.v.). In the presence of atropine (1 mg/kg, i.v.), the depressor response to venom was abolished, a transient pressor response unmasked and the secondary pressor response augmented. In the additional presence of prazosin (50 microg/kg, i.v.), the transient pressor response was abolished and the secondary pressor response attenuated. Lyophilised venom had no significant effect on nerve-evoked (10 microg/ml) or directly-evoked (100 microg/ml) twitches of the chick biventer cervicis muscle preparation. Milked venom (1 microl/ml) caused a biphasic response (i.e., an initial relaxation followed by contraction) in rat aortae, a contraction in porcine coronary arteries, complete cessation of rat isolated atrial activity and markedly inhibited both nerve-evoked and directly-evoked twitches of the chick biventer cervicis muscle preparation. In the anaesthetised rat, milked venom (15 microl/kg, i.v.) caused immediate cardiovascular collapse. It appears that the cardiovascular effects of stonefish venom are mediated by a dose-dependent action at muscarinic receptors and adrenoceptors.",

The mechanisms of A beta toxicity are not clear but likely involve free radicals and apoptosis. Much interest is currently aiming at developing effective approaches to block A beta toxicity in order to slow down disease progression. In that context, we are particularly interested in studying the role of insulin-like growth factors, particularly IGF-I and purported free radical scavengers including a Gingko biloba extract (EGb761) as blocker of A beta toxicity in a simple in vitro model of hippocampal primary cultures. We observed that both IGF-I and EGb761 are unique in that they are able not only to protect but even to rescue neurons against A beta toxicity. These results are summarized here and possible mechanisms of action are discussed to explain the protective properties of these two classes of agents.",

    "57": "Cessation of drug use in chronic opiate abusers produces a severe withdrawal syndrome that is highly aversive, and avoidance of withdrawal or associated stimuli is a major factor contributing to opiate abuse. Increased noradrenaline in the brain has long been implicated in opiate withdrawal, but it has not been clear which noradrenergic systems are involved. Here we show that microinjection of beta-noradrenergic-receptor antagonists, or of an alpha2-receptor agonist, into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in rats markedly attenuates opiate-withdrawal-induced conditioned place aversion. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that numerous BNST-projecting cells in the A1 and A2 noradrenergic cell groups of the caudal medulla were activated during withdrawal. Lesion of these ascending medullary projections also greatly reduced opiate-withdrawal-induced place aversion, whereas lesion of locus coeruleus noradrenergic projections had no effect on opiate-withdrawal behaviour. We conclude that noradrenergic inputs to the BNST from the caudal medulla are critically involved in the aversiveness of opiate withdrawal.", 
    "58": "The number and intensity of stimuli that set basic cycle length in cardiac electrophysiological studies can influence the electrical properties assessed by extrastimuli. The relative contribution of drive (S1) and test (S2) stimulus intensity in defining myocardial excitability and vulnerability has not been reported. The purpose of this investigation was to assess this interaction and to determine whether atrial and ventricular findings differed. The effects of S1 and S2 intensity on atrial and ventricular stimulus-intensity-refractory-period curves were determined in open-chest dogs: comparisons were made between curves with S1 intensity varied between diastolic threshold (DT) and 10 mA and S2 intensity maintained at DT and those with S1 intensity maintained at DT and S2 intensity varied between DT and 10 mA. S1-S1 was held constant and S1-S2 varied. The effects of different stimulation sites, cycle length, number of stimulations, and neural blockade were assessed. S1 intensity amplification shifted atrial stimulus-intensity-refractory period curves in the direction of increased excitability and vulnerability; the changes were more pronounced than those obtained by modulating S2 intensity. The changes produced by increasing S1 intensity were evident at different cycle lengths and were enhanced by an increased number of stimulations, but were not evident when S1 and S2 were delivered at different atrial sites. Although beta-blockade attenuated the effects of increasing S1 intensity somewhat, the addition of cholinergic blockade virtually abolished it. Ventricular refractoriness was also changed by modulation of S1 intensity, but the changes were less striking. In the atrium, modulation of S1 intensity has greater effects of stimulus-intensity-refractory-period relations than modulation of S2 intensity; in the ventricule, the converse is true.", 
    "59": "In the past 2 years, significant advances have been made in class III antiarrhythmic drug therapy. In patients with ventricular arrhythmias and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), antiarrhythmic agents are increasingly being used as adjunct therapy to decrease the frequency of ICD discharges. Sotalol was recently shown to be effective in reducing tachyarrhythmias in patients with ICDs. Intravenous amiodarone is being used for the acute treatment of unstable ventricular arrhythmia and is being investigated for the treatment of acute out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Class III agents are increasingly being used for prophylaxis in patients who have atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and data point to an important role for these agents in reducing supraventricular tachyarrhythmias after cardiac surgery. Future studies will need to directly compare these agents with pure anti-adrenergic maneuvers in postoperative patients. In addition to terminating atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, ibutilide significantly reduces human atrial defibrillation thresholds and increases the percentage of patients who can be cardioverted from atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve dofetilide for clinical use soon, and it is currently reviewing azimilide (which seems to be devoid of frequency-dependent effects on repolarization) for prophylaxis against atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Dronedarone, tedisamal, and trecetilide are now under active study intended to determine their usefulness in patients with cardiac arrhythmias. Experimental studies are ongoing to identify pharmacologic agents that will selectively prolong repolarization in the atria without exerting electrophysiologic effects in the ventricles.", 
    "60": "We have previously reported that intramuscular injection of serotonin (5-HT) into the masseter muscle elicits pain and allodynia/hyperalgesia in healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist granisetron or 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist propranolol can reduce 5-HT induced pain and allodynia/hyperalgesia in the masseter muscle. Twenty-four healthy individuals (12 males and 12 females) without pain from the masseter muscle region participated. They were examined clinically including tenderness to digital palpation (TDP) and pressure pain threshold (PPT) of the masseter muscle. 5-HT in combination with granisetron or propranolol was randomly injected on one side in a double-blind manner. 5-HT in combination with saline was used on the contralateral side. After the injections the pain intensity and PPT were recorded 10 times during 30min. After the last recording the TDP was assessed again. The injections were repeated with the other antagonist within 1 week. All three combinations of substances elicited pain after injection, which lasted for 5-8min. 5-HT induced significantly more pain than granisetron+5-HT and propranolol+5-HT. The TDP increased significantly after injection of all combinations of substances, but there was no significant difference between them. The PPT decreased significantly after injection of 5-HT and increased significantly after injection of granisetron+5-HT, while it did not change significantly after injection of propranolol+5-HT. The difference between 5-HT and granisetron+5-HT was significant. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that injection of granisetron and propranolol into the human masseter muscle reduces pain induced by local administration of 5-HT, but that the effect of granisetron is stronger than that of propranolol. In addition, granisetron totally abolishes allodynia/hyperalgesia.",

The purpose of this study was to examine whether zatebradine is effective against ischemia and reperfusion-induced arrhythmias in dogs compared to propranolol. Arrhythmia was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by reperfusion. Ischemia-induced biphasic arrhythmias were suppressed in both zatebradine and propranolol groups. During ischemia, fatal ventricular fibrillation occurred in four dogs in the control group, 0 in the zatebradine group, and two dogs in the propranolol group. Of the 31 dogs subjected to reperfusion, mortality rates in the zatebradine, propranolol, and control groups were 56%, 75%, and 86%, respectively, and there were no significant differences. In the heart beating 10 beats/min faster than the predrug heart rate by atrial pacing, both zatebradine and propranolol attenuated ischemia-induced arrhythmias but did not affect reperfusion arrhythmias. Our results suggest that I(f) and/or beta-adrenoceptors rather than the bradycardiac action might be related to the antiarrhythmic effects during ischemia, but that they do not play a role in the generation of the reperfusion-induced ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "62": "Angiotensin (Ang) II acts as a mitogen in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) via the activation of multiple signaling cascades, including phospholipase C, tyrosine kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. However, increasing evidence supports signal-activated phospholipases A(2) and D (PLD) as additional mechanisms. Stimulation of PLD results in phosphatidic acid (PA) formation, and PA has been linked to cell growth. However, the direct involvement of PA or its metabolite diacylglycerol (DAG) in Ang II-induced growth is unclear. PLD activity was measured in cultured rat VSMC prelabeled with [(3)H]oleic acid, while the incorporation of [(3)H]thymidine was used to monitor growth. We have previously reported the Ang II-dependent, AT(1)-coupled stimulation of PLD and growth in VSMC. Here, we show that Ang II (100 nM) and exogenous PLD (0.1-100 units/mL; Streptomyces chromofuscus) stimulated thymidine incorporation (43-208% above control). PA (100 nM-1 microM) also increased thymidine incorporation to 135% of control. Propranolol (100 nM-10 microM), which inhibits PA phosphohydrolase, blocked the growth stimulated by Ang II, PLD, or PA by as much as 95%, an effect not shared by other beta-adrenergic antagonists. Propranolol also increased the production of PA in the presence of Ang II by 320% and reduced DAG and arachidonic acid (AA) accumulation. The DAG lipase inhibitor RHC-80267 (1-10 microM) increased Ang II-induced DAG production, while attenuating thymidine incorporation and release of AA. Thus, it appears that activation of PLD, formation of PA, conversion of PA to DAG, and metabolism of DAG comprise an important signaling cascade in Ang II-induced growth of VSMC.", 
    "63": "There are several reports on the oxidation of external NADH by an exogenous NADH dehydrogenase in the outer leaflet of the inner membrane of rat heart mitochondria. Until now, however, little was known about its physiological role in cellular metabolism. The present work shows that carvedilol (\u00bf1-[carbazolyl-(4)-oxy]-3-[2-methoxyphenoxyethyl)amino]-pro - panol-(2)\u00bf) is a specific inhibitor of an exogenous NADH dehydrogenase in rat heart mitochondria. Carvedilol does not affect oxygen consumption linked to the oxidation of succinate and internal NADH. It is also demonstrated that the inhibition of exogenous NADH dehydrogenase by carvedilol is accompanied by the inhibition of alkalinization of the external medium. In contrast to the addition of glutamate/malate or succinate, exogenous NADH does not generate a membrane potential in rat heart mitochondria, as observed with a TPP(+) electrode. It is also demonstrated that the oxygen consumption linked to NADH oxidation is not due to permeabilized mitochondria, but to actual oxidase activity in the inner membrane. The enzyme has a K(m) for NADH of 13 microM. Carvedilol is a noncompetitive inhibitor of this external NADH dehydrogenase with a K(i) of 15 microM. Carvedilol is the first inhibitor described to this organospecific enzyme. Since this enzyme was demonstrated to play a key role in the cardiotoxicity of anticancer drugs of the anthracycline family (e.g., adriamycin), we may suggest that the administration of carvedilol to tumor patients treated with adriamycin might be of great help in the prevention of the cardioselective toxicity of this antibiotic.",

In this work, perineural recording technique was employed to study the effects of beta-AgTx on sodium, potassium and calcium currents of mouse motor nerve terminals. The results showed that beta-AgTx selectively inhibited Ca2+-dependent (I(K,Ca)) and fast (I(K,f) K+ currents, but did not affect slow K+ current (I(K,s)), sodium and calcium currents. However there are other components in A. blomhoffii brevicaudus venom which inhibit perineural sodium current. The present data have provided additional evidence that the site of action of beta-AgTx is different from that of beta-bungarotoxin.", 
    "65": "To elucidate a putative role of beta-adrenoceptors in the modulation of intrathymic T-cell maturation, the expression of major differentiational antigens (CD4/CD8 and TCR alphabeta) on the thymocytes from both immature (aged 21 day at the beginning of the treatment) and adult (aged 75 days at the beginning of treatment) male rats subjected to a 15-day-long propranolol treatment (0.40 mg/100 g/day, s.c.) was analyzed by two- and one-color flow cytometry, respectively. Rats of matched age injected with saline served as controls. The propranolol treatment in immature but not adult rats caused a significant reduction in both the relative thymus weight and total thymocyte yield. In addition, a significant increase in the percentage of CD4+ 8+ double-positive cells, with a proportional decrease in the relative proportion of CD4+ 8- single positive cells, was found in immature rats. In contrast, a slight but significant decrease in the percentage of CD4+ 8+ cells with a parallel increase in the relative proportion of CD4+ 8- cells was found in adult rats. In both groups of rats, the percentage of TCR alphabeta(total) thymocytes was increased: in immature rats this was due to an increase in the percentage of TCR alphabeta(low) thymocytes, while in the adult rats it reflected a rise in the relative proportion of TCR alphabeta(high) cells. In conclusion, the study revealed that propranolol treatment in both immature and adult rats alters the relative proportion of CD4+ 8+ and CD4+ 8- thymocytes, but in opposite fashion, and the data suggest that this treatment affects distinct fractions within the population of CD4+ 8+ thymocytes with respect to expression of TCR alphabeta. The results also indicate that, regardless of rat sexual maturity, the development of thymocytes towards CD4- 8+ T-cells is relatively insensitive to long-lasting beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "66": "This prospective, multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety and efficacy of brinzolamide 1% ophthalmic suspension (Azopt) when used adjunctively with open-label timolol maleate 0.5% (Timoptic). One-hundred-thirty-two patients requiring an adjunctive therapy to timolol 0.5% for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive brinzolamide or placebo three times daily (t.i.d.) in addition to timolol 0.5% twice daily (b.i.d.) for 3 months. Qualifying intraocular pressure (IOP) on timolol 0.5% b.i.d. was 24-36 mm Hg in at least one eye at 8:00 A.M. and 21-36 mm Hg at 10:00 A.M., with no greater than a 5-mm Hg difference between eyes, during two eligibility visits separated by at least 7 days. Treatments were compared using a repeated-measures analysis of variance. Adjunctive therapy with brinzolamide resulted in clinically and statistically significant reductions in IOP from the timolol baseline at all visits. IOP changes from a diurnal baseline ranged from -3.3 mm Hg to -4.1 mm Hg for brinzolamide (N = 53) compared with -0.9 mm Hg to -2.5 mm Hg for placebo (N = 55). Abnormal taste (7.7%) and transient blurred vision (6.2%) were the most frequently reported adverse events. No clinically significant differences in the incidence or severity of ocular signs, visual acuity, cup/disk ratio, or parameters studied on dilated fundus examination were observed between treatment groups. Brinzolamide 1% t.i.d., used adjunctively with timolol 0.5% b.i.d., is safe and well tolerated, and produces clinically and statistically significant additional IOP reductions.", 
    "67": "Sympathetic activation leading to increased levels of blood catecholamines, and stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary inter-renal axis leading to increased cortisol, are difficult to avoid when handling animals. Yet, in research on effects of acute stress, elicitation of such responses must be minimized in the control groups. The work examines means to achieve a minimally disturbed state in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Level of arousal was determined by adrenaline and cortisol concentrations in plasma, and by the spleen:somatic index. Fish were prepared for bleeding by rapid capture and concussion, by infusion of anesthetic into the undisturbed home tank, by confinement in black boxes, or by being fed alpha- and beta-receptor antagonists. Even when done quickly, netting and concussion yielded fish with ca. 200-pmol adrenaline/ml plasma. Cortisol was elevated (to > 10 ng/ml) within 30 s of stress initiation. Surreptitious infusion of anesthetic (2-phenoxyethanol, PE) into tanks yielded fish with lower adrenaline levels (means 19.34 and 19.58 pmols/ml in home tank and black boxes, respectively). Among fish given phentolamine and propranolol, spleen:somatic indices and plasma adrenaline were higher than in diet controls, whether undisturbed or stressed, indicative of successful receptor blockade. Since careful infusion of 2-PE yielded the lowest adrenaline levels, and requires no special apparatus, it is the method of choice for obtaining minimally stressed fish.", 
    "68": "Myocardial ischemia is the metabolic consequence of an inadequate blood supply to the myocardium. How does the myocardium survive a severe insult? Ischemia, perhaps acting through hypoxia, is able to induce a series of cellular signals that lead to protective genetic reprogramming. Metabolic self-protection includes the new ischemic syndromes: stunning, hibernation and preconditioning. In every case it should be considered that ischemia is basically a metabolic problem, usually caused by coronary artery disease, stemming from lack of oxygen and blood flow. In principle, besides revascularization, metabolic therapy should be considered. In the past, metabolic therapies for effort angina have often been ignored. A current hypothesis is that the ischemic myocardium benefits from a switch from fatty acid to glucose metabolism. Two examples are (1) the hemodynamically neutral antianginal agent, trimetazidine, and (2) intravenous glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK). In acute myocardial infarction, GIK is undergoing a resurgence of interest due to the promising results of the large recent Argentinian trial. GIK acts in several ways, including the beneficial effects of insulin itself upon reperfusion, promotion of glycolysis, and inhibition of circulating fatty acids and hence of fatty acid oxidation. Metabolic therapy acting to protect the ischemic cell deserves more attention.", 
    "69": "Systemic adverse effects of timolol ophthalmic solution given at usual therapeutic doses have been well characterized. Timolol is partially metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6. Cimetidine inhibits the activity of cytochrome P450, including CYP2D6, leading to reduced systemic clearance of concomitant drugs. Coadministration of cimetidine has been speculated to affect the pharmacological effects of timolol ophthalmic solution, resulting in increased blood concentration. To evaluate whether administration of cimetidine with timolol ophthalmic solution increased the degree of beta-blockade, 12 healthy Japanese male volunteers ages 19 to 26 received cimetidine (400 mg), on oral placebo, timolol maleate 0.5% (0.05 mL to each eye), or placebo eye drops in a randomized, double-blind, Latin-square design. The oral drug alone was given for 3 days, and on the 4th day, eye drops were applied after oral drug administration. At baseline and 1, 3, and 6 hours after eye drop administration, blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were measured before and after exercise. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at rest. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess subjective bodily feelings in exercise tolerance after every physical exercise. The exercise HR, exercise systolic blood pressure (SBP), and resting SBP were reduced following timolol with and without cimetidine compared with the placebo (p < 0.01, respectively). Administration of cimetidine with timolol ophthalmic solution resulted in additional reductions of the resting HR and IOP. VAS detected a significant reduction in exercise tolerance from timolol ophthalmic solution (p < .05). In conclusion, administration of cimetidine with timolol ophthalmic solution increased the degree of beta-blockade.",

Electrophysiological and microscopic controls were performed to characterize the cell cultures.", 
    "72": "For compounds undergoing passive intestinal absorption permeabilities were generally higher in co-cultures than in Caco-2 monolayers, yielding highest values in pure HT29-MTX monolayers. This difference was most obvious for compounds transported via the paracellular pathway, where HT29-MTX cells may be up to 30 times more permeable than Caco-2 cells, whereas for lipophilic and highly permeable compounds, the difference in permeability values was less obvious. For drugs undergoing intestinal secretion mediated by P-glycoprotein, co-cultivation of Caco-2 cells with HT29-MTX cells led to increased apical to basolateral permeability which was decreased in the opposite direction, consistent with the fact that HT29-MTX cells do not express P-glycoprotein. When a carrier-mediated absorption mechanism is involved, the permeabilities observed were lower than the values reported for human small intestine and co-cultivation of HT29-MTX cells with Caco-2 cells resulted in even lower values as compared to the plain Caco-2 cultures.", 
    "73": "Co-cultures of HT29-MTX and Caco-2 cells offer the opportunity of modifying the permeability barrier of the cell monolayers both with respect to paracellular resistance and secretory transport via P-gp. Thus, in special cases, they allow more flexibility in adapting the in vitro system to the in vivo situation as compared to the monocultures. Another advantage is the obvious robustness of the method with respect to the reproducibility of the results.

After a 2- to 4-week run-in period on timolol, 0.5% twice daily, the patients were randomised to treatment with either latanoprost, 0. 005% once daily, or the combination of timolol, 0.5% twice daily, and dorzolamide, 2% twice daily. The mean diurnal IOP after 3 months of treatment was compared with baseline.", 
    "76": "Switching from timolol to latanoprost reduced mean diurnal IOP by 4.5+/-0.2 mmHg (mean+/-SEM, ANCOVA; 20%), and adding dorzolamide to timolol reduced mean diurnal by 4.4+/-0.2 mmHg (mean+/-SEM, ANCOVA; 20%). No serious side effects were observed with either treatment.",

    "78": "We report the case of a 47-year-old woman with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome who developed autonomic instability and hypertension and subsequently developed a subarachnoid haemorrhage. This was manifested clinically by a seizure which began focally and became generalised. Computer tomography demonstrated a localised haemorrhage in the left central sulcus. Control of the hypertension was achieved with intravenous labetolol. Autonomic instability and hypertension are frequently reported in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Subarachnoid haemorrhage is an uncommon but serious complication.", 
    "79": "Adenine nucleotides play an important role in the control of membrane potential by acting on ATP-sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channels and, in turn, modulating the open probability of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in pancreatic islet beta-cells. Here, we provide evidence that guanine nucleotides (GNs) also may be involved in the modulation of these events in vivo. GNs were depleted by treatment of HIT-T15 cells with mycophenolic acid (MPA). Resting membrane potential was more depolarized in cells treated for 3 and 6 hr with MPA than in control cells, and this effect was inhibited by diazoxide. After 6 hr of exposure to MPA, basal cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) were elevated by 20%. Increments in [Ca2+]i induced by submaximal concentrations of K+ (10-15 mM) or bombesin were enhanced by > 50%. Opening K(ATP) channels with diazoxide lowered basal [Ca2+]i in MPA-treated cells to normal and abrogated the enhanced [Ca2+]i responses. However, an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker only abolished the enhanced [Ca2+]i response to stimuli and had no effect on the elevated basal [Ca2+]i, in contrast to EGTA, which obliterated both, implying that the latter was due to Ca2+ influx via non-L-type Ca2+ channels. These effects on ion fluxes were attributable specifically to GN depletion, since guanosine, which restores GTP content and the GTP/GDP ratio, but not adenosine, prevented all MPA-induced ion changes; furthermore, the latter were mimicked by mizoribine (a structurally dissimilar GTP synthesis inhibitor). It is concluded that, in addition to adenine nucleotides, GNs might contribute to the modulation of K(ATP) channels in intact beta-cells. In addition, GN depletion appeared to be able to reduce stimulated insulin secretion by a mechanism largely independent of the changes of ion fluxes observed above.",

    "82": "Included were 30 trials for pregnancy hypertension, and four others for perinatal outcomes only. For mild chronic hypertension treated throughout pregnancy (n=2 trials), oral beta-blockers (compared with no therapy) were associated with an inconsistent increase in small for gestational age (SGA) infants (OR 2.46 [1.02, 5.92]). For mild-moderate 'late-onset' pregnancy hypertension (i.e. either chronic treated only late in pregnancy, or pregnancy-induced) (n=8 trials), oral beta-blockers (compared with no therapy) were associated with a decrease in severe hypertension (OR 0.27 [0.16, 0.451), borderline decrease in development of proteinuria (OR 0.69 [0.48, 1.02]), decrease in RDS (OR 0.33 [0.13, 0.85]), but a borderline increase in SGA infants (OR 1.47 [0.96, 2.26]). Beta-blockers were equivalent to other agents (n=15 trials). For severe 'late-onset' pregnancy hypertension (n=5 trials), i.v. labetalol produced less maternal hypotension (OR 0.13 [0.03, 0.71]) and fewer cesareans (OR 0.23 [0.13, 0.63]) than i.v. hydralazine/diazoxide.",

    "85": "30 microliters of latanoprost (0.005%) was instilled once daily and timolol (0.5%) twice daily into one eye, and physiological saline as a control into the other eye of 8 cynomolgus monkeys for 6 days. Blood velocity through the retinal veins was measured using a KOWA Laser Speckle Blood Flow Meter. The ONH tissue blood velocity normalized blur (NBONH) was measured using a Laser Speckle Tissue Circulation analyzer. Retinal blood flow, NBONH, intraocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure, and pulse rate were measured before the first instillation, 4 hours after the first instillation on the 2nd experimental day, and 4 hours after the last instillation.", 
    "86": "After the first instillation on the 2nd experimental day, the retinal blood flow was decreased to below the baseline, but 6-day instillation caused no significant change from the baseline. Six-day instillation increased the NBONH in the treated eyes by 10% from the baseline and by 7% from that in the fellow control eye. After 6-day instillation, the IOP was lowered by 7.8 +/- 2.7 (mean +/- standard deviation) mmHg and 3.6 +/- 4.3 mmHg in the treated and control eyes, respectively.",

    "90": "This study consisted of three series of experiments with eight groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 132). Series 1 comprised groups 1-4, where group 1 = sham (0.9% NaCl, subcutaneous (s.c.) injection); group 2 = ACTH (0.5 mg/kg per day, s.c.); group 3 = atenolol + sham; group 4 = atenolol + ACTH treatments. Series 2 comprised groups 5 and 6, where group 5 = minoxidil + sham and group 6 = minoxidil + ACTH treatments. Series 3 comprised groups 7 and 8, where group 7 = ramipril + sham and group 8 = ramipril + ACTH treatments. Systolic blood pressure, water and food intakes, urine volume, and body weight were measured every second day. After 10 days of treatment, mean arterial blood pressure was measured by intra-arterial cannulation, and cardiac output (CO), and renal, mesenteric and hindquarter blood flows (RBF, MBF and HBF) determined using transonic small animal flowmeters.", 
    "91": "ACTH treatment increased blood pressure (P < 0.001) with a rise in CO (P < 0.01) and renal vascular resistance (RVR, P < 0.05), but did not affect total peripheral resistance (TPR). Atenolol blocked the rise in CO without affecting the rise in blood pressure produced by ACTH treatment Minoxidil lowered TPR, but did not prevent the rise in blood pressure or renal vascular resistance. Ramipril blunted the rise in RVR and blood pressure without significantly affecting TPR.", 
    "92": "Neither preventing rise in CO nor lowering TPR altered the ACTH-induced rise in blood pressure in the rat However, both the hypertension and rise in RVR were prevented by ramipril. These data suggest that increase in RVR may play a role in the pathogenesis of ACTH-induced hypertension in the rat.", 
    "93": "Recent data indicate that bradykinin participates in the regulation of neonatal glomerular function and also acts as a growth regulator during renal development. The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of bradykinin in the maturation of renal function. Bradykinin beta2-receptors of newborn rabbits were inhibited for 4 days by Hoe 140. The animals were treated with 300 microg/kg s.c. Hoe 140 (group Hoe, n = 8) or 0.9% NaCl (group control, n = 8) twice daily. Clearance studies were performed in anesthetized rabbits at the age of 8-9 days. Bradykinin receptor blockade did not impair kidney growth, as demonstrated by similar kidney weights in the two groups, nor did it influence blood pressure. Renal blood flow was higher, while renal vascular resistance and filtration fraction were lower in Hoe 140-treated rabbits. No difference in glomerular filtration rate was observed. The unexpectedly higher renal perfusion observed in group Hoe cannot be explained by the blockade of the known vasodilator and trophic effect of bradykinin. Our results indicate that in intact kallikrein-kinin system is necessary for the normal functional development of the kidney.", 
    "94": "The in vivo effect of 48-h glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone 3,3', 5-triiodine-L-thyronine (T(3)) pretreatment on alveolar epithelial fluid transport was studied in adult rats. An isosmolar 5% albumin solution was instilled, and alveolar fluid clearance was studied for 1 h. Compared with controls, dexamethasone pretreatment increased alveolar fluid clearance by 80%. T(3) pretreatment stimulated alveolar fluid clearance by 65%, and dexamethasone and T(3) had additive effects (132%). Propranolol did not inhibit alveolar fluid clearance in either group, indicating that stimulation was not secondary to endogenous beta-adrenergic stimulation. With the use of bromodeoxyuridine in vivo labeling, there was no evidence of cell proliferation. Alveolar fluid clearance was partially inhibited by amiloride in all groups. Fractional amiloride inhibition was greater in dexamethasone- and dexamethasone-plus-T(3)-pretreated rats than in control animals, but less in T(3)-pretreated rats. In summary, pretreatment with dexamethasone, T(3), or both in combination upregulate in vivo alveolar fluid clearance similarly to short-term beta-adrenergic stimulation. The effects are mediated partly by increased amiloride-sensitive Na(+) transport, because the stimulated alveolar fluid clearance was more amiloride sensitive than in control rats. These observations may have clinical relevance because glucocorticoid therapy is commonly used with acute lung injury.", 
    "95": "R,S-sotalol, a ss-blocker drug with class III antiarrhythmic properties, is prescribed to patients with ventricular, atrial and supraventricular arrhythmias. A simple and sensitive method based on HPLC-fluorescence is described for the quantification of R,S-sotalol racemate in 500 microl of plasma. R,S-sotalol and its internal standard (atenolol) were eluted after 5.9 and 8.5 min, respectively, from a 4-micron C18 reverse-phase column using a mobile phase consisting of 80 mM KH2PO4, pH 4.6, and acetonitrile (95:5, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with detection at lambdaex = 235 nm and lambdaem = 310 nm, respectively. This method, validated on the basis of R,S-sotalol measurements in spiked blank plasma, presented 20 ng/ml sensitivity, 20-10,000 ng/ml linearity, and 2.9 and 4.8% intra- and interassay precision, respectively. Plasma sotalol concentrations were determined by applying this method to investigate five high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation admitted to the Emergency Service of the Medical School Hospital, who received sotalol, 160 mg po, as loading dose. Blood samples were collected from a peripheral vein at zero, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4. 0, 6.0, 8.0, 12.0 and 24.0 h after drug administration. A two-compartment open model was applied. Data obtained, expressed as mean, were: C MAX = 1230 ng/ml, T MAX = 1.8 h, AUC T = 10645 ng h-1 ml-1, Kab = 1.23 h-1, alpha = 0.95 h-1, ss = 0.09 h-1, t((1/2))ss = 7.8 h, ClT/F = 3.94 ml min-1 kg-1, and Vd/F = 2.53 l/kg. A good systemic availability and a fast absorption were obtained. Drug distribution was reduced to the same extent in terms of total body clearance when patients and healthy volunteers were compared, and consequently elimination half-life remained unchanged. Thus, the method described in the present study is useful for therapeutic drug monitoring purposes, pharmacokinetic investigation and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic sotalol studies in patients with tachyarrhythmias.",

All eyedrops were applied in the right eye for 60 days. A clinical follow-up with slitlamp examination and break-up time evaluation was performed for 2 months. At the end of the experimentation, the animals were sacrificed and their eyes enucleated for histological analyses of the conjunctiva and cornea. There was no significant difference in the clinical examination between each group, except for the break-up time evaluation between Timoptol and Timabak at each concentration which was better with the unpreserved timolol. Histological results showed a significant difference in the corneal stroma edema between preserved and unpreserved timolol. This study confirms that using unpreserved timolol may be beneficial for the long-term treatment of glaucomatous patients as it increases tear film stability and decreases epithelial permeability and stromal aggression of the cornea.", 
    "97": "It is clearly established that beta-blockers decrease the risk of a first variceal bleeding in cirrhosis. We have recently shown that the addition of isosorbide mononitrate to nadolol decreases the rate of variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and varices, compared with nadolol alone, after a median follow-up of 30 months. It is not established if the long-term treatment with the combination continues to be beneficial. Therefore, we assessed the long-term effect of this combination on first variceal bleeding, complications, and death. One hundred forty-six cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices included in a previously published multicenter, randomized study comparing nadolol (40-160 mg/d) with the combination nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate (10-20 mg 3 times per day) were followed up for up to 7 years (median follow-up, 55 months). The primary end-point was variceal bleeding of any severity. Twenty-four patients (16 in the nadolol group, and 8 in the combination group) experienced variceal bleeding (log rank test, P =.02). Cumulative risk of bleeding was 29% and 12%, respectively (95% CI for the difference, 1%-23%). Two and 4 patients, respectively, had bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy (log rank test, P =.20). Thirty and 25 patients, respectively, died during follow-up (log rank test, P =.13). Twelve and 10 patients, respectively, had de novo occurrence of ascites during follow-up (log rank test, P =.29). In conclusion, nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate is significantly more effective than nadolol alone in the long-term use. Side effects are few, and no deleterious effects on ascites occurrence or on survival occur after long-term use of this combination.",

After a 21 day run in period on timolol 0.5% twice daily, patients were randomised either to latanoprost 0.005% once daily or to a fixed combination of timolol-pilocarpine twice daily. Changes in mean diurnal IOP from the baseline to the 6 week visit were determined with an analysis of covariance.", 
    "100": "Mean diurnal IOP was statistically significantly decreased from baseline in both groups (p<0.001). Switching to latanoprost treatment reduced mean diurnal IOP by 5.4 (SEM 0.3) mm Hg (ANCOVA -22%) and switching to timolol-pilocarpine treatment reduced mean diurnal IOP by 4.9 (0.4) mm Hg (-20%). Blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, decreased twilight vision, and headache were statistically significantly more frequent in the timolol-pilocarpine group.", 
    "101": "Latanoprost monotherapy was at least as effective as fixed combination timolol-pilocarpine twice daily treatment in reducing mean diurnal IOP in patients not adequately controlled on topical beta adrenergic antagonists. Latanoprost was better tolerated than timolol-pilocarpine regarding side effects. These results indicate that a switch to latanoprost monotherapy can be attempted before combination therapy is initiated.", 
    "102": "The efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of bisoprolol were investigated following oral administration once daily for 12 weeks in hyperreninemic patients with dialysis-refractory hypertension. Mean blood pressure rapidly fell from 132 to 112 mmHg in the 5.0-mg/day (n = 6) and from 142 to 128 mmHg in the 2.5-mg/day patients (n = 5), which were accompanied by a fall in plasma renin activity. On nondialysis days, Cmax and T1/2 were significantly higher in patients than in healthy control subjects. However, Cmax in the 2.5-mg/day patients was almost equal to that in healthy control subjects receiving 5.0 mg/day of bisoprolol. Plasma bisoprolol was dialyzable. During the course of the study, dialysis hypotension and bradycardia occurred in two patients receiving 5.0 mg/day of bisoprolol. In conclusion, a daily dose of 2.5 mg bisoprolol seems to be an adequate and relatively effective dose in our patients with dialysis-refractory hypertension.", 
    "103": "The ventricular proarrhythmic actions of five class III antiarrhythmic agents were compared in the Carlsson rabbit model. In adrenergically stimulated anesthetized rabbits, azimilide, clofilium, dofetilide, sematilide, and d,l-sotalol caused premature ventricular contractions and nonsustained and sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (NSVT and SVT) at pharmacologically equivalent intravenous doses that increased QTc intervals 20% (ED20). There were no significant differences between agents in the percentage of rabbits with serious arrhyhthmias at the ED20 doses of 5.2, 0.033, 0.015, 0.66, and 2.8 mg/kg i.v., respectively. Proarrhythmia was dose-dependent. Linear regression analysis of arrhythmia score versus log dose estimated the NSVT doses as 6.2, 0.055, 0.0089, 1.5, and 5.7, respectively. Analysis of arrhythmia states during a 10-min window after infusion when QTc prolongation was 20% showed that the compounds differed significantly in the proportion of time treated rabbits spent in SVT and combined NSVT and SVT. Rabbits treated with azimilide spent significantly less time in SVT and combined NSVT and SVT, followed in order of increasing time by d,l-sotalol, sematilide, clofilium, and dofetilide.", 
    "104": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication of cardiac operations that leads to increased risk for thromboembolism and excessive health care resource utilization. Advanced age, previous AF, and valvular heart operations are the most consistently identified risk factors for this arrhythmia. Dispersion of repolarization leading to reentry is believed to be the mechanism of postoperative AF, but many questions regarding the pathophysiology of AF remain unanswered. Treatment is aimed at controlling heart rate, preventing thromboembolic events, and conversion to sinus rhythm. Multiple investigations have examined methods of preventing postoperative AF, but the only firm conclusions that can be drawn is to avoid beta-blocker withdrawal after operation and to consider beta-blocker therapy for other patients who may tolerate these drugs. Preliminary investigations showing sotalol and amiodarone to be effective in preventing postoperative AF are encouraging, but early data have been limited to selective patient populations and have not adequately evaluated safety. Newer class III antiarrhythmic drugs under development may have a role in the treatment of postoperative AF, but the risk of drug-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia must be considered. Nonpharmacologic interventions under consideration for the treatment of AF in the nonsurgical setting, such as automatic atrial cardioversion devices and multisite atrial pacing, may eventually have a role for selected cardiac surgical patients.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of controlled-release metoprolol (metoprolol CR) on clinical status, on left ventricular (LV) volumes and function, and on neurohumoral activation in a large number of patients with CHF of mixed causes.", 
    "110": "Four hundred twenty-six patients with symptomatic CHF were randomized to receive metoprolol CR or placebo for 24 weeks. Metoprolol CR did not affect 6-minute walk distance, New York Heart Association functional class, or quality of life.

LV ejection fraction was unchanged (-0.05% or -0.005) in the placebo group but increased by 2. 4% in the metoprolol CR-treated patients (P=0.001). Patients receiving metoprolol CR had a greater decrease in angiotensin II (P=0.036) and renin (P=0.032) levels but an increase in N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide levels (P<0. 01). There were fewer deaths in the group receiving beta-blockers (3. 4% versus 8.1%), and there was a similar number of patients experiencing the composite outcomes of death or any hospitalization.",

    "112": "Heart failure (HF) is a progressive process and the objective of treatment should be to prevent progression. Treatment should begin at the stage of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), not only to reduce mortality but also to preserve exercise capacity and quality of life. To prevent clinical progression in patients with asymptomatic LVD or HF, left ventricular remodelling and dilatation must be prevented. The SOLVD prevention trial-the only clinical trial on the prevention of HF-showed that ACE inhibition significantly reduced the development of HF, but did not significantly reduce mortality. Plasma norepinephrine is elevated in patients with asymptomatic LVD, is further elevated in patients with overt HF, and is correlated with increased mortality. Inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system by administration of beta-blocking agents is therefore a logical treatment for patients with HF or asymptomatic LVD. Clinical trials have shown that beta-blocking agents increase left ventricular ejection fraction and reduce left ventricular dimensions in patients with HF, indicating regression of left ventricular remodelling. Almost all the patients in these studies were receiving an ACE inhibitor as part of their background medication, therefore the relative efficacy of beta-blocking agents and ACE inhibitors in the regression of remodelling is not known. CARMEN, a double-blind, randomised, parallel group study of carvedilol versus enalapril versus carvedilol + enalapril in 450 patients with mild HF, will provide this information.", 
    "113": "Patients with hypertension are at increased risk of developing heart failure (HF), but the mechanisms by which hypertension leads to HF have not been clarified [although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is clearly a predictor of an increased risk of HF]. Similarly, although antihypertensive therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of HF in hypertensive patients, it is not known how this benefit is produced and, currently, there is no clear evidence that any class of antihypertensive agent is more effective than any other in this respect. On theoretical grounds, beta-blockers would be expected to be ideal agents for the prevention of HF in hypertensive patients. In addition to control of blood pressure and regression of LVH, they have clear benefits on morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction (MI), which probably plays a major role in the development of HF in hypertensive patients, and on the prognosis of HF itself. A reduction in long-term mortality after MI has been demonstrated only for non-selective beta-blockers. Carvedilol, a non-selective beta-blocker which also has other ancillary properties including alpha-1-receptor blockade and antioxidant effects and a favourable metabolic profile, may be an appropriate choice for the prevention of HF in hypertensive patients. This is reinforced by the salutary benefits of carvedilol for the reduction in the morbidity and mortality of HF itself.", 
    "114": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for the development of heart failure. Mechanisms which maintain normal function in the short term in the pressure overloaded heart have longer term deleterious effects. These include left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and chronic activation of the adrenergic and renin-angiotensin systems. beta-Blocking agents are capable of blocking the adrenergic system and, to some extent, the renin-angiotensin system. They are therefore attractive in treating hypertension, both for preventing the development of abnormalities and for reversing established LV dysfunction and hypertrophy. Trials in heart failure have shown that these agents prevent progressive myocardial dysfunction, prevent and reverse remodelling and improve intrinsic systolic function. Non-selective beta-blocking agents appear to offer greater anti-adrenergic effects than selective ones. However, more research is needed, including direct comparisons of different agents.", 
    "115": "The most difficult diagnosis in medicine is the diagnosis of hypertension. Since this label encompasses many maladies both known (secondary hypertension), and the unknown, the office recording of blood pressure alone will not suffice to warrant treatment with drugs right away. There are more than 6 major guidelines in the world about the rules of the game of drug therapy in hypertension. The present preoccupation with newer drugs as first line antihypertensive drugs would ruin any economy, if the exchequer is to foot the bill. The stress in drug treatment has been the step-care mode of drug therapy where one starts with one drug in small doses, building the dose gradually, adding the next drug to get cumulative power to lower the pressure. Since the early seventies, the need to step-down therapy is being stressed wherein the doctor starts cutting down the drugs and the dosage, once he achieves the desired blood pressure levels. Diuretics and beta-blockers should be the first choice when drugs are indicated, unless there are positive indications for other drugs, or the first line drugs are contra-indicated. Routine treatment with drugs is recommended by the American JNC for people with sustained blood pressure above 140/90 mm Hg, but the British recommendations put the cut off at the pressure level of 160/100 mm Hg. Indian patients respond to very small doses in the beginning. The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) study failed to demonstrate a significant difference between the 3 randomised target blood pressure groups for the majority of cardiovascular events, although it did prove the theoretical hypothesis, that more vigorous treatment could certainly bring down the measured blood pressure to greater extent in 90% of patients I Greater importance will be given in the future for the non-pharmacological approaches, as well as to baseline blood pressure values, at which drug treatment should be started.", 
    "116": "Hypertension (HT) is a common disease in elderly. It has different pathophysiologic, clinical and therapeutic implications in this age group. Due to loss of arterial wall elasticity with age, major vessels including aorta become stiff and less distensible. As age advances, these stiff vessels also lose beta adrenergic responsiveness with unchanged alpha adrenergic responsiveness. These together raise peripheral vascular resistance and aortic impedance which needs a powerful systolic ejection of left ventricle to maintain cardiac output. Result is rise in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and increase in left ventricular (LV) mass with compromised cardiac output and renal blood flow. Participation of renin-angiotensin system and kidney in HT pathogenesis in elderly are minimum. Diagnosis of HT in elderly is made if SBP > 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 90 mm Hg or is taking antihypertensive medications. Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) means SBP > 140 mm Hg with DBP < 90 mm Hg. Measurement of blood pressure (BP) is problematic, mainly due to pseudo HT, postural hypotension and white-coat HT. HT in absence of end organ changes suggest pseudo HT. Postural hypotension must be detected and treated. Systolodiastolic HT, carried over from middle age is the commonest type of HT in elderly. ISH is also common (10%). Atherosclerotic renovascular disease can cause secondary HT. Therapy is always needed in HT in elderly. Chance of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) are quite high amongst elderly hypertensives. SBP is more dangerous than DBP. Benefits of therapy are more when compared to young. HT should be treated if SBP > 160 mm Hg and/or DBP > 90 mm Hg. ISH needs therapy if SBP > 160 mm Hg. The benefits of therapy becomes less after 80 years. Treatment goal should be to keep BP below 140/90 mm Hg. Therapy should be gradual and stepwise. Na-restriction should be modest. Diuretics (e.g., thiazide 25 mg/day) are the drug of choice unless contra-indicated. Beta blockers are inferior agents compared to diuretics unless angina or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is present. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are drug of choice only if congestive cardiac failure (CCF) and/or diabetes is present or other drugs are contra-indicated. Calcium entry blockers (CEB) are new but very good alternative to diuretics in elderly. Due to abnormal physiology, pharmacokinetics and drug interactions, side-effects are very common in elderly. They should be detected early and treated.", 
    "117": "To establish the functional coupling of beta adrenoceptor (beta AR) subtypes of beta 1AR and beta 2AR to L-type calcium current (ICaL), we investigated the non-selective agonist isoproterenol (ISO), and the relatively selective beta 2AR agonists zinterol (ZIN) and salbutamol (SAL) on ICaL in isolated canine ventricular myocytes in the presence and absence of CGP 20712A (CGP) and atenolol (AT), selective beta 1AR antagonists, and ICI 118,551 (ICI) a selective beta 2AR antagonist. Peak ICaL was determined using \"patch type\" microelectrodes and whole cell voltage clamp. ISO (0.5 microM) increased ICaL maximally 3.5 +/- 0.67 fold. ZIN (10.0 microM) and SAL (10.0 microM) increased ICaL maximally 1.5 +/- 0.2 (n = 5) fold and 1.4 +/- 0.1 (n = 5) fold, respectively. These effects were fully inhibited by CGP (0.3 microM) and AT (1.0 microM), inhibitors of beta 1AR but not by ICI (0.1 microM) a beta 2AR inhibitor. ZIN at relatively lower concentrations (< or = 0.1 microM) did not increase ICaL. CGP (0.3 microM) but not AT and ICI inhibited ICaL in the absence of beta AR agonists. CGP inhibition of ICaL was absent in the presence of forskolin (FK, 1.0 microM) that increases cAMP levels and ICaL by directly stimulating the adenylate cyclase. These indicate that none of the antagonists affect ICaL through an action downstream of beta AR.",

    "119": "Fumonisins are mycotoxins produced primarily by Fusarium verticillioides, a fungus that commonly contaminates corn. Fumonisin ingestion increases plasma and tissue sphingosine and sphinganine concentrations and causes porcine pulmonary edema, which has been attributed to acute left-sided heart failure or increased vascular permeability. We investigated the effect of short-term ingestion of fumonisin B1-containing culture material on cardiac function in pigs. Treated male pigs (n = 7) received fumonisin-containing culture material which was mixed into the grower diet at 20 mg fumonisin B1/kg body weight each day, while control pigs (n = 7) were fed only the grower diet on the same schedule as the treated pigs. Pigs were anesthetized after 3 days of receiving either diet and instrumented to accurately characterize the cardiovascular effects of fumonisin ingestion. Fumonisin-treated pigs had lower cardiac outputs and heart rates than control pigs. Fumonisin-treated pigs also had a marked reduction in cardiac contractility, as indicated by decreased values for end-systolic elastance (the gold standard in vivo measure of cardiac contractility), V(0) (the intercept value for the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship), and mechanical efficiency. These data indicate that in pigs, short-term ingestion of fumonisin B1-containing culture material produces negative inotropic and chronotropic effects and decreases mechanical efficiency of the left ventricle. Theses cardiovascular effects are consistent with fumonisin-induced, sphingosine-mediated l-type Ca(2+) channel blockade and suggest that pulmonary edema in pigs fed fumonisin is primarily due to acute left-sided heart failure instead of increased vascular permeability.", 
    "120": "To understand more fully the nature of events leading to asthmatic death, we conducted a confidential enquiry prospectively throughout 1994-96 among the surviving relatives and respective general practitioners of subjects whose deaths could be attributed to asthma, whether wholly or partly. We also reviewed relevant hospital records and autopsy reports, and we submitted all the gathered information to an enquiry panel for evaluation. The subjects were identified from death certificates issued in five districts of the Northern Health Region of England (population 1 million) on which asthma was recorded as the primary cause of death. The enquiry panel agreed that asthma had been a critical factor in causing death in only 33 of the 79 certified cases for which there were sufficient data. The level of concordance was substantially greater for subjects aged < 65 years (76%) than for those who were older (17%). In 16 of the 33 cases asthma alone appeared to be responsible for death, but in 17 cases a wide variety of additional, co-morbid, disorders appeared to have contributed. They included, during the 24 h preceding death, gastric aspiration, septicaemia, a single dose of a beta-blocker, the abuse of organic solvents or illicit drugs and possibly, an inadvertent exposure to horse allergen. More chronic causes of co-morbidity included ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), thoracic cage deformity and alcohol abuse. There were possible errors of judgement in two cases by the supervising physician (6%) and in three cases by the patient (9%). Poor compliance and psychosocial disruption probably exerted an additional adverse influence in nine cases (27%). We conclude: (1) that asthma death certification in subjects aged 65 years or more is very unreliable, (2) that for approximately half of the deaths in which asthma exerted a critical role there were critical co-morbid disorders and (3) that errors of judgement, poor compliance, or psychosocial disruption are likely to have exerted an additional adverse influence in an important minority of cases.", 
    "121": "Intracellular recordings were made from myenteric neurones of the guinea-pig descending colon. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and related pancreatic polypeptides were applied by superfusion and the effects upon the amplitude of fast excitatory synaptic potentials (ESPs) and the ratio of paired fast ESPs evoked by stimulation of internodal fibre tracts were noted. NPY produced a concentration-dependent inhibition in fast ESP amplitude in the majority of neurones (17/21) with a calculated IC50 value of 7 nM; in some neurones this inhibition was mediated via the local release of noradrenaline. Peptide YY (PYY) (eight out of 11 neurones; IC50 = 1 nM), NPY(3-36) (three out of three neurones) and [Leu31, Pro34]NPY (four out of five neurones) also decreased the amplitude of fast ESPs. The effects of two or more pancreatic polypeptides or analogues on fast synaptic transmission were compared directly in six neurones; the apparent relative potency of agonists suggested the involvement of Y2-receptors and at least one other Y-receptor type. In the absence of any direct postsynaptic effects of pancreatic polypeptides on the active or passive properties of myenteric neurones, or on their sensitivity to ionophoretically applied acetylcholine, inhibition of fast ganglionic transmission was presumed to be presynaptic in origin. It is concluded that, in addition to their previously described depressant actions on neuro-effector transmission to colonic smooth muscle, pancreatic polypeptides can exert powerful inhibitory effects on myenteric neurones of the descending colon.", 
    "122": "BmKTX is a toxin recently purified from the venom of Buthus Martensi, which belongs to the kaliotoxin family. We have determined its solution structure by use of conventional two-dimensional NMR techniques followed by distance-geometry and energy minimization. The calculated structure is composed of a short alpha-helix (residues 14 to 20) connected by a tight turn to a two-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet (sequences 25-27 and 32-34). The beta-turn connecting these strands belongs to type I. The N-terminal segment (sequence 1 to 8) runs parallel to the beta-sheet although it cannot be considered as a third strand. Comparison of the conformation of BmKTX and toxins of the kaliotoxin family clearly demonstrates that they are highly related. Therefore, analysis of the residues belonging to the interacting surface of those toxins allows us to propose a functional map of BmKTX slightly different from the one of KTX and AgTX2, which may explain the variations in affinities of these toxins towards the Kv1.3 channels.",

Demographics, CHD risk factors, medications, anthropometrics, and lipid levels were compared among women with low, normal, and high HDL-C by NCEP criteria with and without stratification by use of lipid-lowering medications. Independent correlates of high HDL-C were determined by logistic regression analysis. HDL-C > or =60 mg/dL was present in 20% of participants. Women with high HDL-C were older, better educated, had fewer CHD risk factors, lower triglyceride levels and total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio, and were more likely to report past estrogen and current calcium antagonist, niacin, and statin use. beta-Blocker, diuretic, and fibrate use was less common. Older age, alcohol consumption, niacin, and calcium antagonist use and prior estrogen use were independently associated with high HDL-C, whereas waist-to-hip ratio, smoking, triglyceride level, and beta-blocker and fibrate use were inversely associated (all P <.05).",

We examined the influence of treatment on the occurrence of deaths, permanent treatment withdrawals, and nonlethal cardiovascular events by using the technique of event history analysis, which takes into account competitive risks between events. Compared with placebo, bisoprolol reduced mortality rates in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < or =20% (relative risk [RR] 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27 to 0.88; P =.02). In patients whose baseline heart rate was in the upper tertile of distribution, permanent treatment withdrawals were less frequent in patients randomly assigned to bisoprolol than in patients randomly assigned to placebo (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.88; P =.02). Bisoprolol reduced the incidence of nonlethal cardiac events in patients in whom heart failure was present for at least 4 years (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.71; P <.01). Event history analysis revealed that among patients who died under treatment after having at least 1 nonlethal cardiovascular event, 20 patients were treated with placebo but only 7 patients were treated with bisoprolol (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.98; P <.05).",

    "129": "The aim of this study was to examine the involvement of multiple 5-HT receptors in passive avoidance (PA) with a focus on 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors. Because increases in 5-HT transmission result in concomitant multiple 5-HT receptor activation, the effects of the 5-HT releasing compound p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) were compared with those of the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT in the rat. In addition, some results with the nonselective 5-HT2C/2B/1B receptor agonist mCPP are presented. When injected before PA training, 8-OH-DPAT, mCPP, and PCA produced a dose-related impairment of the 24-hour retention. The crucial involvement of the postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the action of 8-OH-DPAT was confirmed. Thus, the 5-HT1A receptor antagonists WAY 100635 and (-)-pindolol blocked the PA deficit by 8-OH-DPAT. The impairment of PA caused by PCA was attenuated by WAY 100635 and (-)-pindolol, suggesting an involvement of the 5-HT1A receptor. In contrast, the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors were of negligible importance in the 24-hour retention deficit induced by PCA. However, the ability of the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist Ro 60-0491 to block the inhibitory effects of mCPP indicated an important regulatory role of the 5-HT2C receptor in PA. The nonselective 5-HT receptor antagonist methiothepin attenuated the PA deficit by PCA but lacked activity versus 8-OH-DPAT. These data provide evidence for the hypothesis that, in addition to the 5-HT1A receptor, other 5-HT receptor subtypes are involved in the inhibitory actions of PCA. Importantly, changes in dopamine transmission seemed not to contribute to the PA impairment by PCA. The behavioral alterations caused by the drug treatments at the time of PA training could not be related to the subsequent retention performance. In conclusion, multiple 5-HT receptors are involved in PA with roles that probably differ at various stages of information processing. These findings also suggest that there probably exists a functional distinction between 5-HT receptor subtypes in different types of aversive learning.", 
    "130": "Targeted cardiac overexpression of the alpha-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein G(q) in transgenic mice evokes hypertrophy and depressed stimulation of cardiac inotropy and chronotropy by beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) agonists in vivo, which is a hallmark of many forms of experimental and human heart failure. The molecular basis of this betaAR dysfunction was explored in transgenic mice overexpressing G(alphaq) approximately 5-fold over background. Isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities in myocardial membranes were significantly depressed in G(alphaq) mice compared with nontransgenic controls (19.7 +/- 2.6 versus 43.7 +/- 5. 6 pmol/min/mg) without a decrease in betaAR expression levels. Functional coupling of both betaAR subtypes was impaired. Similarly, in whole-cell patch-clamp studies, betaAR stimulation of L-type Ca(2+) channel currents was depressed approximately 75% in the G(alphaq) mice. Cardiac betaAR from these mice showed decreased formation of the active high-affinity conformation (R(H) = 29% versus 62% for nontransgenic littermates), confirming a receptor-G(s)-coupling defect. Of the three candidate kinases that might impose this uncoupling by receptor phosphorylation (protein kinase A, betaAR kinase, protein kinase C), only protein kinase C activity was elevated in G(alphaq) mouse hearts. Type V adenylyl cyclase was decreased approximately 45% in these mice, consistent with decreased basal, NaF, and forskolin-stimulated enzyme activities. Although cellular G(s) levels were unaltered, G(i2) and G(i3) were increased in G(alphaq) mice. Pertussis toxin treatment of isolated G(alphaq) myocytes resulted in an improvement in betaAR, but not that of forskolin or NaF, stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. Thus three distinct mechanisms contribute to impaired betaAR function by in vivo G(q) signaling cross-talk in myocytes. Because many elements of hypertrophy and/or failure in cellular and animal models can be initiated by increased G(alphaq) signaling, the current work may be broadly applicable to interfaces whereby modification of heart failure might be considered.", 
    "131": "CGP 12177 is a beta-adrenergic receptor (AR) ligand that has been used to characterize the beta3-AR and the putative beta4-AR. The ability of CGP 12177 to activate beta1-AR when overexpressed in vitro and the presence of beta1-AR in tissues expressing putative beta4-AR prompted us to investigate the actions of CGP 12177 at recombinant and natively-expressed beta-AR. CGP 12177 potently activated recombinant rat and human beta1-AR expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. This activation, like that of putative beta4-AR, was resistant to blockade by selective and nonselective beta-AR antagonists. Brown fat has been proposed to contain beta4-AR, as evidenced by the presence of CGP 12177-mediated thermogenesis in mice lacking beta3-AR. Therefore, the identity of the receptors mediating CGP 12177 responses in brown fat was examined using wild-type mice and mice lacking beta1-AR or beta3-AR. In wild-type mice, CGP 12177 activated adenylyl cyclase via high- and low-affinity sites. The high-affinity site, but not the low-affinity site, was blocked by CGP 20712 with potency indicating an interaction with beta1-AR. Moreover, the high-affinity site was absent in mice lacking beta1-AR. In contrast, the low-affinity, CGP 20712-resistant activation by CGP 12177 was absent in mice lacking beta3-AR. Rather, activation occurred exclusively through the high-affinity, CGP 20712-sensitive site. These data indicate that the actions of CGP 12177 in brown fat that have been attributed to novel beta-AR (i.e., beta4-AR) are mediated via an atypical interaction with beta1-AR.",

We tested the premise that nicardipine (NIC) and esmolol (ESM) in combination (COMB) would oppose both. Adult surgical patients received pretreatment (randomized) with IV bolus NIC 30 microg/kg (n = 31), ESM 1.0 mg/kg (n = 34), or COMB (one-half dose each, n = 32). Peak BP and HR after LTI were compared with controls (CONT; n = 35) with no pretreatment. Anesthetic induction was standardized: IV thiopental (5-7 mg/kg), fentanyl (1-2 microg/kg), and succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg). Systolic (S), diastolic (D), and mean (M) BP and HR awake before pretreatment (baseline) were similar in all test groups. No patient was treated for hypotension, bradycardia, or tachycardia after pretreatment or anesthetic induction. Peak HR after LTI was increased versus baseline in CONT and all test groups, but did not differ from CONT among the test groups. Peak SBP and DBP increased versus baseline in CONT, and with ESM and NIC, but not COMB. Peak SBP, DBP, and MBP were increased with ESM versus COMB, and peak DBP with ESM versus NIC. Compared with no pretreatment before the IV induction of general anesthesia, the peak increase in BP after LTI is best blunted by the combination of nicardipine and ESM, compared with either drug alone.

To induce RWMA, we infused esmolol (9 mg) into the left anterior descending coronary artery in eight anesthetized open-chest canine preparations. Global and regional stroke volumes and end-systolic pressure-volume relationships (LV conductance catheter) and pressure-length relationships (sonomicrometer crystals) were measured in dysfunctional (apical) and normal (basilar) LV regions at baseline, during esmolol infusion, and after treatment with a systemic dobutamine infusion (4 microg. kg(-1). min(-1)) and combined dobutamine-esmolol. Esmolol induced apical dyskinesis, as evidenced by reduced effective apical stroke volumes and stroke work, a parallel right-shift of the apical regional, global end-systolic pressure-volume relationships, and increased regional and global LV volumes (P < 0.05). However, global and regional elastances remained unchanged. Dobutamine increased global and apical regional elastances, but did not increase regional volumes. During the infusion of combined esmolol-dobutamine, apical elastance and volumes increased compared with baseline (P < 0.05), but apical regional stroke work decreased. Thus, esmolol-induced RWMA were associated with cardiac dilation but not with decreased regional or global elastances.",

We describe a model for quantifying RWMA by referencing regional amplitude and phase angle changes to global LV systole in eight anesthetized, open-chest dogs. Regional and total LV volumes (conductance catheter), regional shortening (epicardial piezoelectric crystals), and LV pressure were measured before, during, and after transient esmolol-induced apical RWMA. Regional phase angle (alpha) was defined as the relative distance, measured in degrees, that regional minimal volume differs from global end-systole. We compared maximal stroke volume (SV) with effective SV (that portion of regional SV contributing to total LV SV). Regional effective SV was also calculated from our model as the product of cosine alpha and regional maximal SV. Esmolol delayed apical end-systolic alpha (14.3 degrees +/- 11.4 degrees versus 35.7 degrees +/- 8.0 degrees baseline versus esmolol, P < 0.05) and decreased apical effective SV (2.4 +/- 0.3 versus 1.7 +/- 0.3 mL, P < 0.05), while apical maximal SV and total LV SV were not altered. Piezoelectric crystal dimension changes mirrored regional SV changes. We conclude that effective SV and phase angle analysis are more sensitive measures of regional myocardial dysfunction when RWMA exist than are measures of maximal regional SV.",

    "139": "Chronic mild unpredictable stress, which reduces rewarded behaviour in rats, is becoming increasingly popular as an animal model of depression. The effect of chronic mild stress (applied to animals housed five per cage for 15 days) on forced swimming and open field behaviour, and on beta-adrenoceptor binding was studied in naive rats and after the denervation of the locus coeruleus projections by DSP-4 (50 mg kg(-1)) treatment. In the forced swimming test, chronic mild stress reduced the immobility time on the second day of testing in both vehicle- and DSP-4-treated rats, indicating rather an antidepressant-like effect. This antidepressant-like effect of chronic mild stress in the forced swimming test was not present in individually housed rats which suggests that this paradigm is sensitive to housing conditions. Stress had no clear effect on the open field locomotion in naive animals (but caused a reduction in defecations), but completely blocked the DSP-4-induced decrease in the exploratory activity. As measured by 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding, DSP-4 treatment increased the beta-adrenoceptor affinity in the frontal cortex and the number of binding sites in the hippocampus and in the cerebral cortex (total-frontal cortex). Stress had no effect on the beta-adrenoceptor binding in the frontal cortex and cerebral cortex, but prevented the increase in affinity caused by DSP-4 treatment in the frontal cortex. In the hippocampus, chronic mild stress and DSP-4 treatment increased the number of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites. Neither chronic mild stress nor DSP-4 treatment had any effect on CCK(B) receptor binding in the cerebral cortex and striatum. These results show that chronic mild stress applied to group-housed rats can prevent the development of certain behavioural and biochemical changes caused by the denervation of the locus coeruleus projection areas.",

Therefore, we analyzed a prospective population-based cohort of 937 subjects who underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) on two occasions separated by 4.5 years. In cross-sectional analysis, NEFA measures were correlated with systolic and diastolic BP, both at baseline and at follow-up study. In longitudinal analysis, baseline systolic and diastolic BP predicted changes in fasting NEFA levels (both P < .01). However, baseline NEFA levels did not predict change in BR In multivariate analysis, the relationship between baseline BP and change in fasting NEFA was independent of age and sex. Obesity and its interaction with BP did not explain this association. Absolute changes in NEFA concentrations were greater among subjects who were hypertensive at baseline compared with the normotensive individuals. This change was greater in subjects treated with diuretics compared with those treated with beta-adrenergic antagonists (P < .01), an observation that provides support for a role of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity in explaining the relationship between BP and NEFA concentration.",

In contrast, Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants deficient in sialylated (Lec2) or galactosylated (Lec8) glycoconjugates showed an increase in toxin sensitivity compared with wild-type cells.

We now report that OT infused intravenously into conscious rats at 125 ng x kg(-1) x h(-1), a dose selected to mimic plasma OT levels during hypotension or hypovolemia, increased plasma renin concentration and plasma renin activity by twofold. This effect was prevented by systemic pretreatment with an OT receptor antagonist [[1-(3-mercaptopropionic acid)-2-O-ethyl-D-Tyr-Thr(4)-Orn(8)]-OT]. The OT antagonist did not block renin secretion induced by systemic injection of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol, indicating that the OT antagonist does not interfere nonselectively with renin release. Pretreatment of rats with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist nadolol also prevented OT-induced renin secretion. Similarly, nadolol injected during infusion of OT markedly reduced the elevated plasma renin levels. These observations raise the possibility that pituitary OT secretion during hypotension or hypovolemia in rats may serve to support blood pressure by enhancing activation of the renin-angiotensin system via a beta-adrenergic receptor-dependent mechanism."
