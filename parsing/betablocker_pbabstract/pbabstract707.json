    "0": "The effects of a wide range of Prostacyclin (PGI2) concentrations on the Isometric Developed Tension (IDT) of isolated left auricles driven at different frequencies (0.8, 1.6 or 3.3 Hz) were explored. A comparison of the positive inotropism of PGI2, norepinephrine (NE), tyramine and phenylephrine (Phenyl) indicated that PGI2, NE and tyramine enhanced peak tension significantly less at slow (0.8 and 1.6 Hz) than at higher rates (3.3 Hz); whereas Phenyl augmented equally the IDT at all of these three driving frequencies. The positive inotropism evoked by PGI2 was inhibited by (-)-propranolol and also by a treatment with 6-OHDA. Cocaine, normetanephrine and U-0521, augmented the positive inotropic influence of PGI2 on atria paced at a slow rate (0.8 Hz) but not at a faster one (3.3 Hz). These results suggest that the action of PGI2 on atrial contractions is apparently indirect and mediated by the release of tissue catecholamines. In addition the effect of PGI2 and NE at slow and fast rates appears associated with a different relative relevance of the processes which terminate the action of added sympathomimetic agonists, namely, neuronal or extraneuronal uptake as well as metabolization via COMT. These mechanisms seen to be more prominent at slower driving frequencies and could explain the diminished effect of PGI2 and NE on slowly paced atria.", 
    "1": "The effect of propranolol on plasma dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity and triiodothyronine was investigated in twelve subjects with Graves' disease. Plasma DBH activity, serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine were determined beforehand and electrocardiograms were recorded on the same days as the blood samples were taken. Propranolol administration was associated with clinical amelioration in blood pressure and ECG. There was a positive and significant correlation between changes in DBH activity and triiodothyronine caused by propranolol. These data offer evidence that there may be an interaction between plasma DBH activity and triiodothyronine during propranolol administration in hyperthyroidism.", 
    "2": "The phosphatidylcholine (PC) content (mg/g dry lung weight; mean +/- S.E.) of lung washes of 1 to 3-day-old rabbits was significantly greater 30 min after the injection of the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine (0.2 mg/kg; 50.5 +/- 2.9 mg/g; 2 P < 0.01) or epinephrine (50 micrograms/kg; 78.0 +/- 14.8 mg/g; 2 P < 0.001) than saline (25.7 +/- 1.9 mg/g). Injection of atropine (2 mg/kg), dl-propranolol (1 mg/kg) but not d-propranolol (1 mg/kg) at 40 min or adrenalectomy at 45 min before killing abolished the increase produced by oxotremorine (2 P < 0.001). Also, dl-propranolol antagonized the increase produced by epinephrine. Palmitic and myristic acids were the major fatty acids in the lung wash PC of control and oxotremorine-treated rabbits. The residual lung tissue PC content following atropine (2 mg/kg; 104.4 +/- 18.5 mg/g) was significantly greater (2 P < 0.05) than following saline (72.6 +/- 6.0 mg/g) but not different (2 P > 0.05) in other treatment groups. The total lung content of PC was 55% greater (2 P < 0.001) than controls 30 min after epinephrine (50 micrograms/kg). The surface activity of lung washes (mg/g dry lung weight; mean +/- S.E.), assayed on a surface tension balance using dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine as standard, was significantly greater (2 P < 0.05) 30 min following injection of oxotremorine (0.2 mg/kg; 73.8 +/- 9.9 mg/g) or epinephrine (50 micrograms/kg; 72.2 +/- 10.2 mg/g) than saline (42.8 +/- 2.0 mg/g). Ten-min infusions of oxotremorine (0.34 micrograms/ml) into isolated, ventilated, perfused neonatal rabbit lung preparations failed to alter the PC content of the subsequent wash, but this was significantly (2 P < 0.05) raised from 3.7 (+/- 0.8) to 4.8 (+/- 0.8) mg/g dry lung wt by a 10 min infusion of epinephrine (3.4 micrograms/ml).", 
    "3": "The effects of timolol on the aqueous humor (AH) formation and AH outflow in cat eyes were simultaneously studied with a continuous infusion method under constant intraocular pressure. The rate of AH formation was reduced 28%, 56%, and 71%, respectively, by 0.005%, 0.025%, and 0.15% of timolol solution infused intracamerally. There was no significant change of AH outflow after the administration of timolol. It was noted that the pupil was dilated by 0.025% and 0.15% timolol solutions. To determine the action mechanism of timolol to inhibit AH formation, experiments of carbonate dehydratase inhibition were performed with various concentrations of timolol. No appreciable enzyme inhibition was noted with timolol at concentrations up to 0.5%. It is thus concluded that the action mechanism of timolol to inhibit AH formation differs from that of carbonate dehydratase inhibitors.", 
    "4": "Melting points measured with the capillary method were 150.5 degree C, 150.5 degree C and 224.0 degree C for hydrochlorides of (+)-bupranolol, (-)-bupranolol and (+/-)-bupranolol, respectively. The large difference in melting points of 73.5 degree C prompted us to determine possible contaminations of (+)-bupranolol with traces of (-)-bupranolol using differential scanning calorimetry. We detected as little as 0.001% (-)-bupranolol in a standard mixture of (+)-bupranolol and (-)-bupranolol. A batch of (+)-bupranolol not measurably contaminated with (-)-bupranolol (optically purity greater than 99.999%) was used in pharmacological and biochemical assays. The affinities of (-)-bupranolol and (+)-bupranolol were determined functionally by the blockade of isoprenaline stimulation of spontaneously beating rat right atria and electrically driven kitten papillary muscles; and directly by inhibition of binding of 3H-(-)-propranolol to kitten ventricle membrane particles. In all 3 systems the enantiomeric (-)/(+) affinity ratio was 50--120 for bupranolol. These experiments prove that (+)-bupranolol itself binds to the beta-adrenoceptors of mammalian myocardium.", 
    "5": "The effect of hydralazine in the alteration of blood sugar, tissue glycogen and blood cAMP levels in rats were investigated. Hydralazine was found to increase blood sugar level in intact rats when administered i.p. On the other hand, this hyperglycemia was partially blocked either by the treatment of intact rats with propranolol, beta-adrenergic blocker, or by adrenalectomy. Hydralazine treatment increased blood cAMP level, leading to the hyperglycemia, because pretreatment with phentolamine partially blocked the hydralazine-induced hyperglycemia.", 
    "6": "1 (-)-Adrenaline sensitivity in 1 to 20 day-old rat heart tissue was investigated as rate, force and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) production responses together with sensitivity to (+/-)-propranolol blockade.2 Resting performances were measured and responsiveness to (-)-adrenaline then determined as ED(50) values and maximal responses together with sensitivity to propranolol (pA(2) values).3 Resting force, corrected for sample size, did not change with age, whereas resting atrial rate doubled between 1 and 20 days.4 ED(50) concentrations in atria were constant with age, but decreased in ventricles. Cocaine (10(-5) M) and other drugs did not consistently affect ED(50) values.5 Maximal responses were not age-dependent in right atria, but increased in left atria. In 2 to 5 day-old hearts there was no inotropic response to adrenaline and the very small maximal response in ventricles rose 5 to 7 fold by 20 days.6 Propranolol sensitivity increased slightly (2 to 4 times) with age in all tissue from a pA(2) value of 7.5 at 2 days to 8.2 at 20 days.7 Control cyclic AMP was higher in 2 day than in 20 day-old tissue and in atria than ventricular strips or hearts. In 2 and 20 day-old atria, hearts and ventricles, force increases with different adrenaline concentrations correlated linearly with the log of the increase in cyclic AMP. Such a correlation was not seen in 2 day hearts and ventricles for cyclic AMP rose without corresponding force increases.8 Results suggest slight maturational changes in atrial beta-receptors. In 1 to 5 day-old ventricles, normal ED(50) concentrations and good cyclic AMP response in the presence of a much reduced force response may indicate receptor-response transduction inefficiency, assuming a beta(1)-receptor occupation and cyclic AMP production response mechanism for inotropism with adrenaline.", 
    "7": "1 The ability of amines, having alpha- or alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulating activity, to restore excitability and contractility in heart preparations partially depolarized by potassium, was investigated in guinea-pig ventricular muscle in order to elucidate the mechanism of the positive inotropic effect mediated via alpha-adrenoceptors. 2 In preparations in which fast sodium channels were inactivated by K+-rich medium (22 mM) slow electrical responses as well as contractions were consistently induced by high concentrations of phenylephrine (10(-4) to 3 X 10(-4) M) and synephrine (3 X 10(-4) M). 3 The restorative effective effects of both phenylephrine and synephrine were unaffected by phentolamine (10(-5) M) but were readily abolished by practolol (10(-5) M) or sotalol (10(-5) M). 4 Methoxamine induced a dose-dependent positive inotropic effect in ventricular strips paced at 0.5 Hz in normal Tyrode solution; the maximum increase in contractile tension was obtained with methoxamine 10(-4) M. However, at the same concentration, the amine did not induce slow electrical responses in potassium-depolarized preparations. 5 It is concluded that the induction of slow responses by phenylephrine and synephrine is due to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation, and that the increase in cardiac contractility caused by alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation does not involve an increase in slow inward calcium current.", 
    "8": "An azide derivative of the beta-adrenergic antagonist acebutolol has been synthesized and its effect examined on the isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing); EC 4.6.1.1] activity of rat reticulocytes. It behaved as an effective competitive antagonist (Kd = 2 X 10(-7) M) prior to photolysis. However, when the reticulocyte preparation pretreated with acebutolol azide was photolyzed, a noncompetitive inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase was obtained. Photolysis of the azide derivative in buffer alone did not convert it to a product of higher affnity. Labeling of the beta-adrenergic receptor appeared to be irreversible; multiple washings could not reverse the inhibition produced during photolysis with the label whereas washing would completely reverse the antagonism produced by the same concentration of label prior to photolysis. The effect appears to be specific for the beta-adrenergic receptor because the inhibition could be blocked stereoselectively by propranolol and there was no inhibition of fluoride- or GMP-P(NH)P-stimulated adenylate cyclase. furthermore, no effect was observed on the glucagon-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase of liver membranes, whereas the catecholamine response in the same membranes was inhibited.", 
    "9": "1 beta-Adrenoceptor blockade, plasma labetalol concentrations and anti-hypertensive actions were investigated at 2 hourly intervals during the interdose period of chronic oral therapy in six hypertensive patients. 2 beta-adrenoceptor blockade varied during the inter-dose period and was maximal 2 and 4 h after the oral dose (P < 0.05). 3 Systolic pressure rose during the interdose period (P < 0.05). A significant correlation was found between the degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade and the change in systolic pressure at 2 h after the oral dose. 4 Efficacy of labetalol as a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist and anti-hypertensive drug was assessed 2 h after an oral dose during chronic eight hourly dosage in sixteen hypertensive patients. Pharmacokinetics of labetalol were studied in the same patients. 5 Peak plasma labetalol concentration occurred 2 h after the oral dose and subsequently the plasma concentration declined monoexponentially. 6 The steady state concentration (CSS) of labetalol was correlated significantly with the daily oral dose in mg kg-1, the mid point labetalol concentration (Cmax+Cmin) divided by 2 and the isoprenaline dose ratio-1 at 2 h after the oral dose. 7 No correlation was found between the antihypertensive effect and the CSS ng ml-1 labetalol or between the isoprenaline dose ratio-1 and the CSS labetalol ng ml-1.", 
    "10": "Cholinergic influence on atrioventricular (AV) junctional rhythm via its intervention in the intracardiac autonomic nerves was investigated in the canine, blood-perfused AV node preparation. Large amounts of acetylcholine (ACh) injected into the anterior septal artery (ASA) caused a rapid increase in the rate of automaticity superimposed on a slow increase. Nicotine given in the ASA caused to a rapid increased superimposed on a slow increase. Large amounts of ACh injected into the posterior septal artery (PSA) caused a slow increase, which was superimposed by a rapid icrease in the presence of l-hyoscyamine. The rapid and slow increases were abolished by dl-propranolol given in the PSA and ASA, respectively. Both types of increases were suppressed by tetrodotoxin (TTX). Nicotine given in the PSA caused a decrease superimposed by a rapid increase, both of which were abolished by TTX. These reslts indicate that cholinergic excitatory intervention induces AV junctional tachycardia via norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve endings, distributing widely from the proximal to distal portion of the AV junctional area.", 
    "11": "Recent observations suggest that PA increases during acute metabolic acidosis. The pathophysiological mechanism(s) involved remains undefined. In the present study, anesthetized mongrel dogs were infused with lactic acid (10 mEq/kg body weight) for 3 hr. During acidosis there was no change in plasma potassium concentration, a tendency for an incrase in PRA, and significant increases in PC (as a marker for ACTH secretion) and PA. Other dogs were infused with lactic acid after prior treatment with dexamethasone and propranolol or with dexamethasone alone. Under these conditions, the development of acidosis was not associated with changes in PC, plasma potassium, PRA, or PA, suggesting that the stimulatory effect of acidosis on PA is not a direct one but is mediated by concomitant increases in ACTH and/or PRA.", 
    "12": "To investigate the biochemical and cellular basis for the rise in polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) count during epinephrine administration, PMN from subjects receiving epinephrine were studied for their capacity to adhere to nylon wool fibers and endothelial cell monolayers. After administration of epinephrine, the PMN count increased by 80% at 5 min, and isolated PMN adherence to nylon fibers fell from a base line of 44+/-2-18+/-3%. In contrast, when subjects were infused with the beta-antagonist propanolol before receiving epinephrine, the PMN count failed to rise and PMN adherence was normal. Exposure of PMN endothelial cell monolayers to 0.1 muM epinephrine led to diminished PMN adherence that could be blocked by 10 muM propanolol but not by 10 muM phentolamine. Sera obtained from subjects 5 min after receiving epinephrine or from supernates derived from endothelial cell monolayers exposed to 90 nM epinephrine inhibited PMN adherence to nylon fibers. Addition of anticyclic AMP antisera but not anticyclic guanosine monophosphate antisera to the postepinephrine sera or to the postepinephrine supernate derived from the endothelial cell monolayers abolished their inhibitory effect of PMN adherence to nylon fibers. In contrast, direct exposure of PMN to epinephrine failed to affect their adherent properties. Because it has been previously shown that endothelial cells contain beta-receptors and respond to catecholamines by raising their intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP, and that PMN adherence is attenuated by cyclic AMP, it would appear that diminished PMN adherence after epinephrine administration is mediated through endothelial cell beta-receptor activity, which in turn impairs PMN margination in vivo and could account for the rise in circulating PMN.", 
    "13": "The contribution by different autonomic receptors to the amylase secretion from the parotid gland of the anaesthetized rabbit was studied as the response to various parasympathomimetic and sympathomimetic drugs. Amylase secretion by infusions of pilocarpine and parasympathetic nerve stimulation was low, but regularly higher in response to pilocarpine than to parasympathetic nerve stimulation. These effects were reduced to the same level by beta-adrenoceptor block indicating the presence and for pilocarpine also the release of catecholamines, probably from the adrenals. Isoprenaline injections produced a high amylase secretion, that was blocked by atenolol, indicating that predominantly beta 1-adrenoceptors were activated. Phenylephrine was without amylase secretory effects. By accepting isoprenaline maximum as maximum for sympathetically produced amylase secretion, a theoretical frequency-response relationship for amylase secretion by sympathetic nerve stimulation could be calculated: ED50 was 0.9 Hz. The results indicate that under experimental conditions in vivo there are certain differences between the rat and the rabbit parotid glands in the autonomic control not only of fluid, but particularly of amylase secretion.", 
    "14": "Regional myocardial function was measured with miniature ultrasonic crystals before, during, and after 10 min of coronary occlusion in anaesthetised open-chest dogs. In normal myocardium, intracoronary isoprenaline (0.1 micrograms . min-1) increased contraction velocity during the first third of systole (early systolic velocity) from 13.8 +/- 2.5 to 19.4 +/- 3.9 mm . s-1 . cm-1, (P < 0.01), and blood flow (microspheres) from 0.55 +/- 0.04 to 0.80 +/- 0.12 cm3 . min-1 . g-1 (P < 0.05); lactate extraction was unchanged. Coronary occlusion induced dyskinesia with a fall in early systolic velocity to -10.0 +/- 2.4 mm . s . -1 . cm-1 (P < 0.01). Abrupt reperfusion after 10 min of ischaemia permitted recovery towards normal, but regional function then deteriorated over 15 min. After a second infusion of isoprenaline, early systolic velocity increased from 0.8 +/- 2.2 to 14.2 +/- 2.5 mm . s-1 . cm-1 (P < 0.01), blood flow 0.44 +/- 0.03 to 0.73 +/- 0.14 cm3 . min-1 . g-1 (P < 0.01) and oxygen consumption 50 +/- 5 to 58 +/- 5 mm3 . min-1 . g-1 (P < 0.05). Lactate extraction was unchanged. In a further series of experiments, administration of nitroglycerin and methoxamine accelerated recovery from dyskinesia induced by coronary occlusion, but did not modify late deterioration during reperfusion. Similarly, neither propranolol nor hypertonic mannitol were found to modify reperfusion damage. Four agents which affect calcium ion movement were studied. Verapamil and isoprenaline, drugs which respectively diminish and enhance calcium slow current, had no effect on reperfusion damage. By contrast, ruthenium red, a non-specific calcium inhibitor reduced deterioration and calcium ionophore (A23187; Lilly) increased it. muDepressed function in reperfused myocardium is not the result of residual ischaemia per se, gut is consistent with calcium overload during the period of reperfusion.", 
    "15": "1 The isolated spontaneously beating atria of the rat, diltiazem (0.01 to 0.1 microM) shifted the atrial rate concentration-response curves to isoprenaline to the right in a non-parallel manner and depressed their maxima. Under the same experimental conditions, (+/-)-propranolol (0.03 to 0.1 microM) behaved as a competitive beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. 2 Whereas (+/-)-propranolol (IC50 = 12 nM) and isoprenaline (IC50 = 0.9 microM) inhibited (-)-[3H]-dihydroalprenolol binding to rat brain membrane preparations, diltiazem failed to do so in concentrations up to 10 microM. 3 Diltiazem but not (+/-)-propranolol, antagonized the positive chronotropic responses to calcium in spontaneously beating rat atria. 4 It is proposed that diltiazem inhibited the tachycardia induced by isoprenaline through an effect on calcium which may be an essential modulator of the sequence of events linking the beta-adrenoceptor activation and heart rate response.", 
    "16": "1 The cardiovascular responses to baclofen were investigated in anaesthetized rats. 2 Low doses of baclofen (less than 5 X 10(-8) mol), given intravenously, produced a transient fall in blood pressure and heart rate. Higher doses (greater than 5 X 10(-7) mol) produced a marked and prolonged increase in blood pressure accompanied by a rise in heart rate and cutaneous arterial dilatation. 3 The pressor and heart rate responses exhibited tachyphylaxis, and were abolished by hexamethonium, cervical cord section, reserpine-treatment and by a combination of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. 4 It is concluded that the increases in blood pressure and heart rate produced by high doses of baclofen are of central sympathetic origin.", 
    "17": "Normal controls and schizophrenic patients on propranolol as sole drug or combined with neuroleptics showed superior active and passive avoidance learning to schizophrenic patients who were medicated with conventional neuroleptics only. Active avoidance involved responding quickly, passive avoidance withholding a response to avoid an unpleasant noise and reacting to the appropriate stimulus. This may reflect an improvement brought about by propranolol in the limbic regulation of stimulus and response processes.", 
    "18": "The effect of propranolol at a dose level of 1,280-1,920 mg per day was studied with a double-blind crossover design in twelve chronic schizophrenics with persistent psychotic symptoms despite maintenance treatment with a depot neuroleptic. By use of a psychiatric rating scale (CPRS), an improvement was seen during the two week period of propranolol compared to placebo treatment in six patients, whereas three patients were unchanged and three deteriorated. The effect on total symptom scores for the whole group was significantly better after propranolol. The data indicate that propranolol in high doses has an antipsychotic effect in some schizophrenic patients when receiving neuroleptics.", 
    "19": "Fifteen patients with congestive cardiomyopathy who had improved conspicuously on chronic administration of a beta-blocker were studied after withdrawal of the drug. In six patients there was a pronounced deterioration of their clinical condition, and in all of the remaining patients there was a significant decrease in ejection fraction, and signs of compromised diastolic function with pathological apex curves and an increase in third heart sound. All these changes were reversed within a few weeks to a few months after readministration of beta-blocking drugs. This study supports the idea that an aetiological factor in congestive cardiomyopathy may be a pathological response to sympathetic stimulation which could be partly controlled by administration of beta-blocking drugs.", 
    "20": "Twenty-eight patients with heart failure caused by congestive cardiomyopathy, which had been diagnosed according to the criteria of Goodwin and Oakley, were treated with beta-blocking agents for six to 62 months, except for four patients who died within two months. Repeated non-invasive investigations were performed before and during treatment as well as exercise tests and chest x-rays. The echocardiographic and pulse curve findings indicated an improvement in systolic and diastolic myocardial function. The ejection fraction increased from 0.32 +/- 0.02 to 0.42 +/- 0.04, and the third heart sound amplitude and rapid filling wave were significantly reduced. The functional classification improved in 15 patients while in 12 patients it remained unchanged and in one it deteriorated. During follow-up, 10 patients died, most of them suddenly. The mortality was lower than expected in this severely ill group of patients. The beneficial effect of chronic beta-blockade in patients with congestive cardiomyopathy suggests that catecholamines are involved in the pathogenesis of congestive cardiomyopathy, and that patients with congestive cardiomyopathy may have inappropriate sympathetic cardiac stimulation which can be reduced by chronic beta-blockade. It is suggested that beta-receptor blockade should be added to conventional treatment with digitalis and diuretics in all patients with severe myocardial failure caused by congestive cardiomyopathy.", 
    "21": "The antiarrhythmic activity of four different beta-adrenergic blockers was assessed in the mouse chloroform arrhythmia model. ED50 values and 95% confidence intervals established by i.p. administration of drug were: propranolol (22.8, 10.9--67.0 mg/kg), sotalol (38.0, 15.9--58.5 mg/kg) and practolol (167, 111--235 mg/kg). Butoxamine provided some protection against the arrhythmia within a narrow dose range (53 to 79 mg/kg).", 
    "22": "The ability of hydrochlorothiazide or a long-acting beta adrenergic blocker, nadolol, to reduce the blood pressure was compared in 55 patients with mild to moderately severe essential hypertension. A randomized crossover study design was employed, with 43 patients completing both legs of the study. The mean sitting diastolic blood pressures after one month of therapy were reduced by 13.6 and 14.9 mmHg with hydrochlorothiazide and nadolol, respectively. After hydrochlorothiazide therapy, the diastolic blood pressure was 90 mmHg or lower in 51 percent of the patients, and after nadolol, in 56 percent of the same patients. The results suggest that diuretics and beta adrenergic blockers are equally effective in lowering the blood pressure. Nadolol's long duration of beta adrenoreceptor blockade justifies a simplified, once daily dosage schedule.", 
    "23": "Heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) of Escherichia coli increased guanylate cyclase activity in homogenates of rat and rabbit intestinal mucosa and stimulated intestinal fluid secretion in suckling mice. The ST effect on guanylate cyclase was dose-dependent, occurred without a time lag, and was confined to the particulate fraction. ST activation of guanylate cyclase was tissue-specific; ST did not alter activity of soluble or particulate rat liver, lung, heart, kidney, or cerebral cortex enzyme. The ST activity on guanylate cyclase and secretion was methanol-soluble and alkali-labile, and its effects were not altered by phentolamine, propranolol, or atropine. Monosialoganglioside did not reduce ST-induced secretion. However, indomethacin and butylated hydroxyanisole decreased the ST effect on both guanylate cyclase and secretion. Fluid secretion with ST sppears to result from specific activation of particulate intestinal guanylate cyclase. While adrenergic and cholinergic events are probably not involved in this process, the effects of ST may be mediated through prostaglandin synthesis or oxidative mechnanisms.", 
    "24": "The blood presure abilities of the beta receptor antagonist acebutolol and the fixed diuretic combination of hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride hydrochloride to reduce exercise-induced increases in blood presure durng and after standardized ergometric work were compared in a within-patient study of patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. Both drugs results in a significant (p < 0.01) and almost identical reduction in blood pressure at rest. However, blood pressure during exercise was significantly lower (p < 0.001) with 500 mg of acebutolol than with 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 5 mg of amiloride. This differential effect of the drugs might be of clinical importance because hypertensive patients are particularly endangered by disproportionately high increases in blood pressure during physical activity that is equal to the applied ergometric work loads. From these findings it is concluded that (1) beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents are the drugs of first choice in the treatment of mild to moderate arterial hypertension, and (2) diuretic drugs potentiate the antihypertensive effect of beta blocking agents.", 
    "25": "The withdrawal syndrome following abrupt discontinuation of antihypertensive medication may consist of symptoms of sympathetic overactivity alone or in association with a rapid increase in blood pressure. The phenomenon may occur after discontinuation of any of a variety of drugs. Although the exact incidence of the syndrome is not known, it appears to be rare, at least in patients receiving standard doses of antihypertensive medications. The best treatment is prevention. However, if the syndrome does occur, reinstitution of the previously discontinued medication usually is successful in controlling the withdrawal events.", 
    "26": "Continuous, oral administration of propranolol at doses which reduced the heart-rate by 25% produced a sustained decrease in portal venous pressure in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension. This effect of propranolol might be useful in preventing recurrent bleeding due to ruptured oesophageal varices in patients with portal hypertension.", 
    "27": "The high affinity binding sites for 3H-imipramine (3H-IMI) and 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) in the rat cerebral cortex were studied after 2,4 48 and 72 h of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep deprivation. Both the Kd and Bmax values for 3H-IMI and 3H-DHA binding remained unaffected after 24 or 48 h of REM sleep deprivation. After 72 or REM sleep deprivation there was a significant reduction in the Bmax for 3H-IMI and 3H-DHA binding with a concomitant increase in the apparent affinities. The reduction in high affinity 3H-IMI and 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding sites observed 72 h after REM sleep deprivation could be related to the antidepressant effects of REM sleep deprivation in man.", 
    "28": "The effects of 'peripheral' serotonin (5-HT) antagonists on the facilitation of facial motoneuron excitation by 5-HT were investigated in the present study. Microiontophoretic application (5--10 aA) or intravenous administration of methysergide (0.5--1.0 mg/kg), cyproheptadine (0.5--1.0 mg/kg), cinanserin (0.5--1.0 mg/kg), or metergoline (50--100 micrograms/kg) antagonized the facilitating effect of 5-HT but not that of norepinephrine (NE) on facial motoneurons. Blockade developed within 1--2 min of the intravenous administration of methysergide, cyproheptadine and cinanserin and continued up to 30 min. The antagonism produced by intravenous metergoline took 8--15 min to develop and lasted for at least 6 h. Chronic administration of metergoline resulted in supersensitivity to 5-HT and NE in the facial nucleus. The putative 5-HT antagonists chlorpromazine, propranolol, and methiothepin failed to block the facilitating effect of 5-HT; however, methiothepin did block NE. The results are discussed in relation to a two-component model of the 5-HT mediated motor syndrome consisting of : (1) patterned excitatory inputs to motor nuclei; (2) 5-HT facilitation of these excitatory inputs. The 'peripheral' 5-HT antagonists appear to directly block the latter component.", 
    "29": "In the isolated guinea-pig atrium, pretreated with a high concentration of isoprenaline (8 x 10(-7) M), beta-blockers produced a marked negative inotropic effect in a concentration which by itself was too low to have a direct depressing action. No negative inotropic effect was caused by isoprenaline when beta-blockers were applied first. The depressing action of beta-blockers was unaffected by phentolamine or atropine. During the depression, the electrical parameters of the action potential were not significantly different from those of the control, though the contractions were much smaller than control ones. The negative inotropic effect of beta-blockers was weaker in excess Ca (7.5--10 mM). The observations indicate that isoprenaline possesses a dual action but that the negative inotropic effect is usually masked by the positive inotropic effect and that beta-blockers, by quickly abolishing the positive inotropic effect, reveal the underlying negative inotropic effect.", 
    "30": "When infused into the third ventricle of the brain of the conscious cat, the phosphodiesterase inhibitors, papaverine and aminophylline, increased blood pressure and heart rate whilst the phosphodiesterase stimulator, imidazole-4'-acetic acid, decreased blood pressure. Administered intravenously, these compounds caused the opposite effects indicating that the responses after third-ventricular administration were centrally mediated. Infused of dibutyryl cyclic 3',5'-AMP into the third ventricle increased blood pressure and heart rate, whereas dibutyryl cyclic 3',5'-GMP had little effect and antagonised and pressor response to dibutyryl cyclic 3',5'-AMP. ATP, 5'-AMP and adenosine induced similar changes to dibutyryl cyclic 3',5'-AMP, although the pressor responses to these compounds were of different onset and/or duration. When administered into the third ventricle both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents reduced the pressor response caused caused by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, papaverine, given by the same route. These results demonstrate a central effect of adenosine and adenosine nucleotides to raise blood pressure. The possibility of a specific role for cyclic 3',5'-AMP in the central control of blood pressure is discussed.", 
    "31": "Although rest has largely been abandoned for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, there are strong theoretical arguments for using rest for restriction of myocardial ischaemic injury during the few hours after the onset when infarct size can be influenced by treatment. Rest (reduction of myocardial oxygen uptake) can be achieved (1) by reducing heart rate, (2) by reduction of contractility, (3) by reducing myocardial wall tension. All of these objectives are achieved by beta adrenoceptor blockade. Beta blockers have been shown to restrict infarct size experimentally and clinically. Their efficacy in reducing mortality and morbidity now needs to be assessed by large-scale clinical trial using intravenous beta blockers given within an hour or two of the onset of threatened or developing myocardial infarction.", 
    "32": "We have already reported on a radioreceptor assay for catecholamines utilizing the microsome fraction of bovine myocardium as a catecholamine (CA) receptor and 3H-norepinephrine as a labelled CA. In order to increase the sensitivity of the radioreceptor assay, we used 4-(2-iodoethyl) pyrocatechol (125I-CA) as a ligand instead of 3H-norepinephrine and performed a radioreceptor assay for CA. The following results were obtained: 1) 125I-CA was able to bind alpha-receptors prepared from bovine myocardium. 2) The optimal amount of the microsomal fraction was 250 micrograms/tube, when 125I-CA of 50,000 c.p.m. was used. The appropriate conditions for incubation were 90 minutes at 20 degrees C in a pH 7.0 sucrose solution. 3) By this method utilizing 125I-CA, norepinephrine was detectable in a range from 500 pg to 10 ng/tube. 4) Various compounds with a catechol nucleus showed cross-reaction in this radioreceptor assay system. 5) Whereas beta-adrenergic blocking agents did not inhibit the binding of 125I-CA, phentolamine, a short acting type of alpha-adrenergic blocking agents, was effective in inhibiting the binding. However, dibenamine and phenoxybenzamine, long acting types of alpha-adrenergic blocking agents, increased the binding of 125I-CA to the microsomal fraction. 6) Utilizing this phenomenon, norepinephrine was detectable in the range from 100 pg to 5 ng/tube.", 
    "33": "To determine whether cigarette smoking interferes with the medical management of angina pectoris, 10 patients with angina pectoris who smoked at least 10 cigarettes a day were studied before, during, and after a standardised maximal exercise test. This was done at the end of four randomly allocated one-week treatment periods during which the patients took glyceryl trinitrate while not smoking, took glyceryl trinitrate while smoking, took glycerly trinitrate and propranolol (380 mg/day) while not smoking, and took glyceryl trinitrate and propranolol while smoking. Carboxyhaemoglobin was measured to ensure compliance. Smoking was associated with a significantly higher heart rate, blood pressure, number of positions with ST-segment depression, and total ST-segment depression after exercise than non-smoking (p < 0.01) whether or not the patients were taking propranolol. These results suggest that smoking aggravates the simple haemodynamic variables used to assess myocardial oxygen requirements and the exercise-induced precordial electrocardiographic signs of myocardial ischaemia. These effects were still evident after treatment with propranolol and represent a hindrance to the effective medical treatment of angina pectoris.", 
    "34": "Wise utilization of antiarrhythmic drugs depends on a profound knowledge of their intracellular effects; however, due to widely varying individual response to such drugs, long clinical experience and a certain degree of empiricism are usually necessary. In view of the negatively inotropic effect of the majority of the antiarrhythmic drugs and the potential danger of their association, it seems advisable to recommend that benign arrhythmias should not be treated. Finally, a thorough understanding of the mechanism of complex arrhythmias is essential in selecting the appropriate medical treatment.", 
    "35": "In a double-blind clinical trial the antianginal effects of nifedipine (30 and 60 mg/day) and propranolol 240 and 480 mg/day) and a combination of both drugs were compared with those of placebo in 16 patients with severe exertional angina pectoris. Response to treatment was assessed by the objective criteria of 16-point precordial exercise mapping and 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and subjectively by analysis of patients' daily diaries of episodes of angina and consumption of glyceryl trintrate. The incidence of pain and consumption of glyceryl trinitrate were significantly decreased by each drug compared with placebo, and the combination produced a further significant improvement. Objectively the total area and amount of ST depression on the precordial exercise map and the total number of episodes of ST depression detected on ambulatory monitoring confirmed the efficacy of each treatment regimen; the combination was significantly better than either drug alone (p <0.005). The objective methods permitted greater separation of treatment efficacy and showed reliably that the combination of propranolol and nifedipine was significantly better than either drug alone. Thus this combination is a safe and effective form of treatment for angina.", 
    "36": "An outline of the management of hypertension in pregnancy from experience gained at the King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban, is described. The drugs commonly used in this condition are discussed and the recent literature is reviewed.", 
    "37": "Exercise tests were performed in 521 post-infarction patients to consider the acute effect of 5 mg pindolol orally. The main results are: In patients with an initial heart rate(HR) of more than 68 beats/min the HR at rest was reduced. This reduction was more pronounced the higher the initial HR. With HR below 68 beats/min there was a slight increase due to the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of pindolol. In exercise testing the decrease in HR also correlated positively with the initial values. During the first test run (i. e. without pindolol) angina pectoris was observed in 88 patients. 70% of these patients showed an improvement or total disappearance of angina when pretreated with pindolol. Without medication, 66 patients showed ventricular extrasystoles which diminished or disappeared in 40 after pindolol.", 
    "38": "A number of cardiology problems connected with altitude are discussed. Dietetic and pharmacological measures of service to heart patients in high mountain environments are suggested. It is concluded that the more serious patients (belonging to the IVth and Vth N.Y.H.A. functional classes), those suffering from myocardial infarction in the acute phase or from serious pulmonary hypertension, should not go higher than 1.000-1.500 metres above sea level. All other patients (with angina, hypertension, non-serious aortic and mitral arteriosclerotic cardiopathy) can go as far as 3.000 metres without inconvenience, providing the outlined dietetic and pharmacological measures are respected.", 
    "39": "Male patients, born between 1900 and 1925, have been entered in a study to ascertain the effect of therapy on the lifespan of people with different levels of blood pressure. Patients were divided into three groups--those with diastolic blood pressure below 12.6 kPa (95 mmHg), those with diastolic blood pressure between 12.6 kPa and 14.5 kPa (95 mmHg and 109 mmHg), and those with diastolic blood pressure higher than 14.6 kPa (110 mmHg). Patients in the first group were not treated, and all patients in the last group were treated. Patients in the middle group were subdivided into four subgroups, one of which received no treatment. Those in the second subgroup were placed on a reduced salt intake diet; those in the third subgroup were given a thiazide diuretic followed by alpha-methyldopa; and patients in the fourth subgroup were given a beta-blocking drug followed by a thiazide diuretic. The mortality rates in all groups, except one, were similar, and similar to that predicted for a normal population. The patients who were treated with thiazide diuretic regimen had a higher mortality rate which was due to a greater number of fatal myocardial infarcts and sudden deaths. These occurred in the first 2 1/2 years of therapy, and the cause of this is unknown. In this study, therapy did not produce an improvement in the lifespan of elderly males with hypertension.", 
    "40": "Twenty-five cases of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the young were investigated for autonomic dysfunction by simple electrophysiological tests to assess the integrity of the cardiovascular reflexes. The mean age of the group at the onset of symptomatic diabetes mellitus ws 27 +/- 0,7 years, and that at the time of investigation for autonomic dysfunction ws 34 +/- 1,3 years. Nine patients had clinical evidence of peripheral neuropathy, while only 3 of the 25 had symptoms of autonomic neuropathy. Fourteen patients showed an abnormality during one or more tests for autonomic function, and of this group 9 had unequivocal evidence of autonomic neuropathy. Only 3 patients displayed both sympathetic and parasympathetic impairment of autonomic function, being the only patients exhibiting symptoms of autonomic impairment. The remaining patients with autonomic dysfunction showed only parasympathetic dysfunction. This study demonstrates that subclinical autonomic neuropathy is not an uncommon occurrence in cases of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the young and emphasizes the need for a greater awareness of this complication.", 
    "41": "Some agonists act indirectly in the sense that they cause the release of a second substance that brings about the response finally observed. An antagonist which competitively inhibits the action of the intermediate substance will also reduce the response to the indirectly acting agonist, provided that the receptors are freely accessible. A simple mass-law model for indirect antagonism of this kind is presented, and its predictions are compared with the results obtained in an experimental study of the influence of propranolol and sotalol on the inotropic response of isolated rat atria to tyramine. While there is reasonable qualitative agreement, the fit is not exact and reasons for this are discussed.", 
    "42": "The interaction between clonidine, propranolol and sotalol was investigated using conscious normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rabbits as well as conscious normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats. Clonidine (20 micrograms/kg) administration into the marginal ear vein of rabbits produced persistent hypotension and bradycardia. In propranolol (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.)-pretreated animals, clonidine-induced hypotension was prevented. In rats, daily oral or subcutaneous clonidine as well as propranolol produced hypotension and bradycardia. Significant antagonism of the observed hypotensive effects resulted when clonidine was given to propranolol-pretreated animals or when propranolol was added to the treatment regimen of animals being maintained on clonidine. No antagonism between sotalol and clonidine was demonstrable. In view of the known central site of action of clonidine, and the failure of sotalol to antagonize clonidine-induced hypotension it would appear that the central nervous system is a possible site of the observed drug interaction.", 
    "43": "Adrenergic receptors were first classified into two calsses--alpha and beta--on the basis of the relative pharmacological potencies of agonist compounds, and this classification has been supported by subsequent studies. In some tissues, such as the heart and liver, they exert similar physiological responses, and in other tissues, such as the uterus and vasculature, they have opposing roles. The occurrence of both classes of receptor in the same tissue lewwds to the problem of what determines whether the overall response observed is alpha-type or beta-type, as adrenaline and noradrenaline bind to both receptor classes. Furthermore, direct binding studies have demonstrated that the two receptor classes are distinct and separate entities. We show here that stimulation of alpha-receptors in renal membranes causes a specific decrease in the affinity of the agonist compound isoprenaline for beta-receptors in the same membranes. This demonstrates that interactions occur between renal alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. Such interactions may modulate the response of the kidney to sympathetic stimulation.", 
    "44": "The effects of propranolol (DL-propranolol) and D-propranolol on thyroid hormone metabolism were studied in six euthyroid volunteers receiving L-thyroxine (T4) and six hypothyroid patients receiving T4 replacement. D-propranolol as well as propranolol decreased L-triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations and the ratio of T3 to T4 in the euthyroid subjects, and D-propranolol decreased these variables in the subjects with hypothyroidism (propranolol was not given to this group). It is concluded from this study and from parallel invitro investigations that the effect of propranolol on the conversion of T4 to T3 is unrelated to its beta-adrenergic blocking activity, and that at low therapeutic doses propranolol may exert appreciable \"membrane-stabilising\" effects in vivo.", 
    "45": "In 23 hypertensive men, aged 47-55, propranolol reduced serum high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 13% reduced the ratio of HDL to low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)+very-low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol by 15%, increased total triglycerides by 24%, and increased serum uric acid by 10%. Prazosin reduced total serum cholesterol by 9%, LDL+VLDL cholesterol by 10%, and total triglycerides by 16%. These changes are statistically highly significant. On combined treatment with propranolol and prazosin HDL cholesterol was still significantly reduced but changes in other blood lipids were small and insignificant. Uric acid remained elevated. When decisions about long-term therapy are made, such metabolic effects might be of special importance.", 
    "46": "In 20 patients with coronary heart disease and typical changes in the exercise ECG (evidence of myocardial hypoxia), which disappeared completely on second ergometry after isosorbid dinitrate, the effect of a single dose of 400 mg acebutolol (Prent) was tested on exercise. Ergometrically induced cardiac work was significantly reduced in all patients, compared with leg exercise (little change in lower, more marked change in the higher ranges of exercise) so that repeat ergometry at the same ergometric level of exercise produced neither signs of hypoxia nor angina. There were no significant changes after a placebo.", 
    "47": "Minoxidil is a potent, long-acting, orally effective vasodilator that recently became available for general use in the United States. It is given with a diuretic and a beta-blocking drug to treat severe hypertension that cannot be controlled by conventional therapy. Fluid retention and hypertrichosis are the most common adverse reactions.", 
    "48": "We present two patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to cold and exercise-induced asthma. Neither patient had a prior history of asthma, and both had recently been placed on therapy with propranolol for treatment of hypertension. We discuss the postulated mechanism of bronchospasm in these patients. In addition, we urge aggressive searching for any change in respiratory symptoms in patients receiving propranolol.", 
    "49": "The authors report on seven patients with narrow-angle glaucoma treated for up to six months with Timolol eye drops. Prior to treatment with Timolol the patient's eyes had remained unregulated despite miotics therapy, or it had been impossible to continue with miotics due to subjective intolerance. Timolol eye drops achieved a significant lowering of pressure in all seven patients and satisfactory pressure stabilization was achieved either with Timolol eye drops alone or in combination with pilocarpine or Carbachol eye drops. In one patient who had unregulated glaucoma and who was on Carbachol/acetazolamide therapy, satisfactory stabilization was achieved by additional application of Timolol."
