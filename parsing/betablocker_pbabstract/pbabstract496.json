    "0": "The effects of selective alpha 1-adrenergic blockade with doxazosin on regional myocardial tissue blood flow was studied in anaesthetized cats with acute coronary artery occlusion. Reflex tachycardia was prevented by selective beta 1-adrenergic blockade with atenolol and coronary perfusion pressure was kept constant by partial stenosis of the descending aorta. Administration of atenolol reduced cardiac mechanical work-load by its negative inotropic and chronotropic effects, and reduced myocardial tissue blood flow in normally perfused myocardium. This reduction was most pronounced in the endocardial half-layer of the myocardium adjacent to the ischaemic region. Administration of doxazosin in this situation clearly reduced peak systolic and coronary perfusion pressure. But when coronary perfusion pressure was raised to pre-administration values, measurements of regional blood flow revealed no changes either in ischaemic or non-ischaemic myocardium. Also, there was no sign of redistribution of blood flow between endocardial and epicardial tissue in any area. This study, therefore, indicates that alpha 1-adrenoceptors play a minor role in the regulation of coronary blood flow in normal myocardium as well as ischaemic myocardium.", 
    "1": "The safety and efficacy of orally administered celiprolol, a new beta 1-selective adrenergic blocking drug with peripheral beta 2-agonist properties, were assessed in 91 patients with mild to moderate systemic hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure [BP] 95 to 114 mm Hg without medication) using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, titration-to-effect study design. All patients received placebo for 4 weeks and were then randomized to receive placebo (n = 46) or once-daily celiprolol (n = 45), which was titrated every 2 weeks (200, 400, 600 mg/day) over a 6-week period to achieve a reduction in supine diastolic BP to less than or equal to 90 mm Hg. Plasma lipids and lipoproteins were also assessed at baseline, during placebo and after randomization to active therapy in a subgroup of patients. Compared with placebo, celiprolol reduced supine and standing BP (reduction of supine BP -0.4/-2.1 mm Hg with placebo, -5.7/-6.4 with celiprolol, p less than 0.05; reduction of standing BP -1.7/-1.0 with placebo, -7.2/-4.9 with celiprolol, p less than 0.05). Supine heart rate was reduced by 6.8 beats/min with celiprolol compared with 2.0 beats/min with placebo (p less than 0.05). No differences were seen when the effects of placebo and celiprolol on plasma lipoproteins were compared. Celiprolol is a safe, effective and well tolerated once-daily antihypertensive drug and has no detrimental effects on plasma lipids.", 
    "2": "Coronary reperfusion in myocardial infarction improves infarct zone motion, but its effect on the global ejection fraction has been less consistent. The directional movement of the ejection fraction is determined by the opposing influences of improved infarct zone motion and diminishing hyperkinesia in the noninfarct zone. Noninfarct zone hyperkinesia has been attributed to catecholamine stimulation, the Frank-Starling mechanism or intraventricular interactions that unload noninfarcted segments. To investigate the influence of catecholamine stimulation, 9 men presenting with a first myocardial infarction (mean age 53 +/- 13 years) were studied. Coronary reperfusion was accomplished less than 4 hours after the onset of myocardial infarction. Radionuclide ventriculography was then performed before and immediately after the intravenous administration of 15 mg of metoprolol. End-diastolic volume did not change, but end-systolic volume increased 28% after metoprolol (p = 0.041). The ejection fraction decreased from 55 +/- 13% before metoprolol to 45 +/- 14% after its administration (p = 0.002). There was no effect of intravenous metoprolol on infarct zone motion, whereas motion in the noninfarcted segment decreased (p = 0.002). The patients underwent repeat ventriculography after receiving metoprolol, 100 mg orally twice a day for 9 days. Infarct zone motion improved (p less than 0.002) and the ejection fraction increased to 55 +/- 12% (p less than 0.02). Normal zone motion did not change. Thus, compensatory hyperkinesia is at least in part caused by catecholamine stimulation. Conclusions regarding the effects of reperfusion on global ventricular performance can be influenced by the timing of ejection fraction determinations relative to metoprolol therapy.", 
    "3": "The present report compares the effects of isoproterenol (ISO), norepinephrine (NE), and phenylephrine (PH) on the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and reservoir volume (RV) during cardiopulmonary (CPB) in 16 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who were treated preoperatively with oral nifedipine (10 to 40 mg, three times a day) and propranolol (40 to 60 mg, three times a day). The changes of RV and MAP were used as indices of the changes in venous capacitance and arterial resistance, respectively, produced by the adrenergic agonists. ISO, a beta-adrenergic agonist, decreased both MAP and RV. NE, which activates both alpha 1- and alpha 2- adrenoceptors, increased both MAP and RV, while PH, a selective alpha 1-adrenergic agonist, increased only MAP with no significant change in RV. The changes are qualitatively similar to those previously achieved in patients undergoing valve replacement who did not receive any blocker preoperatively. However, the decrease of MAP by ISO and its increase by NE were significantly less in the CABG group. It is concluded that preoperative preparation of patients undergoing CABG with beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers can modify the effect of ISO and NE on the peripheral resistance, but they have no significant effect on the action of PH at the doses selected in this study.", 
    "4": "The last ten years have been a period of extensive research and development of new agents for the treatment of cardiac rhythm abnormalities. Several new subclass Ic agents have been developed, and more recently the class III agents have become the focus of attention. These new agents are all remarkable for their potency and potential for producing side effects. While none of these agents offers the perfect cure for the treatment or prevention of cardiac arrhythmias, they all offer advantages and options that are valuable for clinical management of patients.", 
    "5": "The effects of oral sotalol were compared with 1000 and 1500 mg of procainamide in 23 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia. The predictive value of an induction study after procainamide was assessed. The mean age of the study group was 62 +/- 12 years, and the mean ejection fraction was 32 +/- 16%. The cycle length (CL) of the induced tachycardia, the coupling interval (CI) of the first extrastimulus (in ms), and the number of noninducible (NI) patients are given in the table below. (table; see text) One patient developed torsades during the loading period of sotalol and is included in the number requiring cardioversion (DC). Important proarrhythmic effects (spontaneous occurrence of tachycardia) were seen twice after procainamide. Induction suppression by procainamide predicted success with sotalol (p = 0.0013).", 
    "6": "Ventricular tachycardia seems to be less often inducible after oral sotalol than after procainamide. The success of procainamide during programmed electrical stimulation predicts the same for sotalol. If ventricular tachycardia remains inducible after oral sotalol, it is faster than after procainamide but slower than the baseline tachycardia. Both drugs slightly prolong refractoriness.", 
    "7": "In a randomized, double-blind crossover trial, indapamide (IND) 2.5 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg + amiloride 2.5 mg (HCTZ + A) were found to be equally effective in reducing blood pressure (BP) in 13 patients with moderate to severe hypertension already receiving chronic treatment with a beta blocker and a vasodilatator (supine BP during run-in: 169/103 +/- 21/5 mmHg; on IND: 149/91 +/- 21/14 mmHg; on HCTZ + A 144/88 +/- 23/5 mmHg). Both drugs induced insignificant reductions in body weight, and no change in plasma volume was seen. Serum potassium was significantly reduced on both regimens--the values recorded on IND being significantly lower than those seen on HCTZ + A. Values below 3.0 mmol/l were found in two patients receiving IND, but no subjective side effects were reported. Hyperuricemia occurred with the same frequency on both regimens. It is concluded that IND, just like the thiazide diuretics, is useful as the third drug in patients needing triple drug therapy to control BP, but metabolic adverse effects are not avoided by the choice of this drug.", 
    "8": "Myocardial hypoxia, induced by arrest of the artificial ventilation of anaesthetized open-chest rats, was utilized in order to study some aspects of the regulation of myocardial glycogen metabolism. Atenolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, and verapamil, an inhibitor of sarcolemmal calcium transfer, were used to determine the respective role of adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and calcium in the activation of the enzymes of glycogen phosphorolysis and synthesis. Glycogen degradation is reduced by atenolol treatment, as a consequence of a reduced activation of glycogen phosphorylase. Verapamil treatment has no significant effect, neither on the enzyme activation nor on the glycogen utilization. The activation of glycogen synthase, expressed by the conversion of the enzyme from the D to the I form, which results from the decrease in glycogen stores during hypoxia, is lowered under the effect of both drugs. However, in the beta-blocker treatment case, this effect results from a lower glycogen depletion while this effect is more specific in hearts from rats treated with verapamil. Under the effect of verapamil, the reduction of synthase activation, for a similar depletion of glycogen stores, was confirmed by experiments using isolated rat hearts submitted to ischaemia. These results show that: 1. the glycogenolysis in the hypoxic myocardium in situ is mainly controlled by a cAMP-dependent enzyme conversion or by metabolic allosteric effectors; 2. the activation of myocardial glycogen synthase, which is essentially correlated to the reduction of glycogen stores, is also calcium-dependent and most probably totally cAMP-independent.", 
    "9": "Beta-adrenoceptor blocking (BAB) drugs perturb the membranes of isolated rat mast cells. Membrane fluidisation was temperature dependent and was determined by the liposolubility of the BAB drugs. The secretory index, evaluated as the ratio between histamine liberation and degranulation, correlated with the membrane order parameter of the mast cell membranes. The rank order of potency for mast cell activation and membrane fluidisation was: exaprolol greater than propranolol greater than metipranolol greater than atenolol.", 
    "10": "The beta-adrenoceptor blocking (BAB) drugs exaprolol (EXA), metipranolol (MET) and propranolol (PRO) inhibited histamine liberation and degranulation from isolated rat mast cells stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187. MET was the most and EXA the least active. Atenolol (ATE) had no effect. Inhibition by BAB drugs of secretion induced with A23187 was not accompanied by any change in 45Ca uptake. On the other hand, EXA, MET and PRO significantly decreased 45Ca uptake by mast cells stimulated with 48/80. The effect of BAB drugs on inhibition of A23187-induced secretion from isolated mast cells was dependent on the lipid solubility of the studied drugs.", 
    "11": "1. The effect of propranolol on the clenbuterol-induced protein anabolism in innervated and denervated soleus and plantaris muscles of the rat was studied. 2. The response to the beta-agonist, clenbuterol, in both innervated and denervated muscles, was not significantly inhibited by the beta-antagonist, propranolol. 3. The results provide further evidence to suggest that the action of clenbuterol on skeletal muscle protein accretion may not be directly mediated by beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "12": "beta-adrenergic blocking agents have undesirable effects believed to be mediated through the central nervous system (CNS). If these effects are due to direct CNS action, less lipid soluble agents ought to have fewer effects. Accordingly, several formal psychological tests of items such as mood, motivation, and anxiety were used in a double-blinded crossover study in 17 hypertensive subjects taking equipotent beta blocking agents with high (propranolol) and low (atenolol) lipid solubility. Patients had less negative effects (p less than 0.05) on 12 of 21 items evaluated with atenolol compared to propranolol while peripheral beta blockade [beta 1, exercise heart rate (HR), and blood pressure (BP)] was equivalent. These results suggest that the mental changes which accompany beta blockade therapy are mediated directly in the CNS and that less soluble drugs can be expected to have fewer CNS effects.", 
    "13": "The antiischemic efficacy of the beta 1-selective blocker Bisoprolol at a dose of 10 mg daily was examined in an open pilot study during steady state. ST-segment analysis was obtained during a 14-day treatment period by means of Holter monitoring in 13 patients with documented stable coronary heart disease (CHD) and an average age of 61 years. beta-Blockade produced a 30% reduction in the frequency of ischemic episodes. There were statistically significant reductions in the mean duration of the ischemic episodes from 19 to 12 min, in the sum of ST-segment deviations in all episodes from 1.35 to 1.0 mV, and in the mean number of ischemic episodes per day from 7 to 5. The intensity of the ischemic episodes (mV x s) was reduced by two-thirds. The circadian distribution of ischemic episodes was linked to the circadian rhythm of heart rate (HR), and the antiischemic effect paralleled the negative chronotropic effect of beta-blockade. beta-Blockade had a greater effect on HR during the day (-20 beats/min) than during the night (-10 beats/min). A possible secondary antiarrhythmic effect was the 80% decrease in ventricular extrasystoles.", 
    "14": "In conscious freely moving rats, administration of 0.65 to 32.5-nmol doses of substance P (SP) into the intrathecal (i.th.) space at the T8-T10 level of the spinal cord increased both mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) in a dose-related manner. Concomitant with these cardiovascular effects, behavioral responses were observed. Injection of the peptide produced agitation of the rat for approximately 1 min as well as intermittent reciprocal hindlimb scratching which lasted for 3-6 min. The cardiovascular responses elicited by SP (6.5 nmol) were not blocked by systemic pretreatment with morphine (3-6 mg/kg), and the effect of SP on HR was potentiated by an i.th. dose of morphine (10 micrograms) given prior to the injection of SP. A systemic dose of phentolamine (1 mg/kg) blocked the pressor response and a depressor effect appeared, whereas propranolol (1 mg/kg) blocked the HR response. Although catecholamines mediate the spinal action of SP on MAP and HR, bilateral adrenalectomy of the rat 48 h prior to experimentation failed to affect the cardiovascular responses to SP. After transection of the spinal cord at the C3-C4 level, the hindlimb scratching behavior and the pressor response to SP were unaffected but the peak HR response was significantly reduced. These results demonstrate that the rise in MAP and HR evoked by SP is not secondary to perception of a noxious stimulus by the rat and that adrenal medullary catecholamines are not essential for these cardiovascular effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "15": "The pharmacologic properties of carvedilol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with vasodilating activity, were investigated in isolated canine coronary artery ring preparations. Carvedilol competitively antagonized the relaxations caused by isoproterenol in 40 mM K+-depolarized preparations and its pA, value was 9.70 +/- 0.08. At concentrations greater than or equal to 3 x 10(-6) M, carvedilol significantly inhibited the contractile response to high [K+]o. Compared with the inhibitory effect on the KCl-induced contraction, the drug was less effective in suppressing the contraction induced by prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha). In addition, carvedilol (10(-7) to 3 x 10(-5) M) suppressed the contraction produced by Bay K 8644, a Ca2+ channel agonist. The concentration-response curve for Bay K 8644 was shifted downward by carvedilol in a concentration-dependent manner. The drug also produced a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the 4-aminopyridine-induced rhythmic contractions in a similar fashion to the Ca2+ channel antagonists. Carvedilol was ineffective in suppressing the contractions induced by PGF2 alpha in Ca2+-free solution and by A-23187. The results suggest that carvedilol exerts a vasodilating action possibly by inhibiting Ca2+ influx through potential-operated Ca2+ channels, although the concentrations required for producing the vasodilation are much higher than that for the beta-adrenoceptor antagonism in canine coronary artery.", 
    "16": "We examined regulation of histamine release from canine hepatic and fundic mucosal mast cells in short-term culture. We found that beta- but not alpha-adrenergic agonists markedly inhibited concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated histamine release. Inhibition by epinephrine was reversed by the beta-antagonist propranolol, but not by the alpha-adrenergic antagonists phentolamine or yohimbine. The beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 115881 reversed the effects of epinephrine, whereas the beta 1-antagonists practolol and betaxolol had little effect. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), but not its analogue enprostil, inhibited ConA-stimulated histamine release. This difference may relate to the ability of PGE2, but not enprostil, to stimulate adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production. Forskolin, cAMP analogues, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine also effectively inhibited ConA-stimulated histamine release. Neither adrenergic agonists nor PGE2 inhibited histamine release stimulated by the combination of phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate plus the calcium ionophore A23187. These data suggest that inhibition was mediated via cAMP-dependent mechanisms and was exerted on primary cell activation, rather than on postreceptor activating events.", 
    "17": "Loss of membrane-bound beta-receptors in the myocardium of spontaneously hypertensive rats has been explained on the basis of enhanced agonist-induced desensitization. However, in both cardiac myocytes and cell-free preparations, isoproterenol and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase are less effective in desensitizing beta-receptors from hypertensive compared to normotensive animals. Reconstitution of cardiac membrances from hypertensive rats with cytosol from normotensive controls restores the ability of isoproterenol and protein kinase A to desensitize beta-receptors. Impaired desensitization in spontaneously hypertensive rats is, therefore, not due to intrinsic defects of the beta-receptor but, rather, to absence of regulatory cytosolic factor(s).", 
    "18": "Affinity-labeled beta-adrenergic receptor from turkey erythrocyte membranes was specifically cleaved near cysteine residues after S-cyanylation. Analysis of the labeled polypeptide fragments suggests that iodocyanopindolol diazirine reacted with an amino acid residue which is located in the non-glycosylated region containing the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains of the receptor. However, the possibility cannot be excluded that a second residue, located between the third and fifth transmembrane domains, was also labeled. Since treatment with either hydroxylamine or triethylamine resulted in removal of the affinity label from the protein, the present study suggests that aspartic or glutamic acid residues are present in the adrenergic-binding site which is located in the above-mentioned domains. The procedure for specific chemical cleavage of the affinity-labeled adrenergic receptor should also be useful for future structural and comparative studies of other adrenergic receptors.", 
    "19": "The antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of the 5HT2-receptor antagonist ketanserin was investigated in 188 patients aged 41 to 82 years with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Ketanserin was given as monotherapy (n = 107) as well as in combination with either the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride (n = 42) or the betablocker atenolol (n = 39) for 12 weeks. Compared to placebo, ketanserin lowered systolic blood pressure by 11 +/- 16 (SD), 9 +/- 13 and 9 +/- 11 mm Hg (p less than 0.01 for all) and diastolic blood pressure by 9 +/- 10, 10 +/- 9 and 7 +/- 9 mm Hg (p less than 0.001 for all), in the three treatment groups; body weight, serum sodium, potassium, uric acid, cholesterol and triglycerides remained unchanged. The incidence of withdrawals due to unwanted effects was 4% on ketanserin monotherapy, and 12% and 10% on the diuretic/ketanserin and the betablocker/ketanserin combination respectively. Well-being during ketanserin therapy was improved in the older patients in particular; sleep disturbances, daytime fatigue and overall weakness decreased. Ketanserin was well tolerated in combination with the diuretic, whereas in combination with the betablocker the occurrence of dry mouth and stuffy nose was slightly higher. - Ketanserin proved to be an effective antihypertensive drug comparable to other blood pressure lowering agents. It can be combined advantageously with a potassium sparing diuretic or a betablocker. The greater efficacy and tolerability in patients greater than or equal to 60 years qualify ketanserin primarily as an antihypertensive agent for older patients.", 
    "20": "A simple and sensitive stereoselective high-performance liquid chromatographic assay for the quantitation of propranolol enantiomers in serum is described. The method involves conversion of the propranolol enantiomers to diastereomeric urea derivatives by reaction with the clinical reagent (+)-phenylethylisocyanate, followed by chromatographic separation of the diastereomeric products. Conditions of the derivatization reaction were optimized to achieve rapid and quantitative yield with either of the enantiomers. Baseline resolution of the diastereomers was achieved on a reversed phase C8 column with an isocratic mobile phase. Fluorescence detection afforded an absolute on-column detection limit of 100 pg. The assay has been applied to pharmacokinetic studies in humans and small laboratory animals.", 
    "21": "An improved screening method for beta-blockers in urine is proposed, involving enzymatic hydrolysis, solid-phase extraction and capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Several extraction methods for beta-blockers, such as conventional liquid-liquid and solid-phase extraction procedures, have been evaluated for at least eight beta-blockers. Additionally, the gas chromatographic properties and mass fragmentation of the trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetyl, trifluoroacetyl and cyclic n-butylboronate derivatives of beta-blockers have been compared and evaluated with respect to their efficiency for screening urine. The resulting screening method proved to be a specific and sensitive procedure, enabling these analytes to be detected and identified up to 48 h after the administration of a dosage, usually encountered in doping cases.", 
    "22": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterized by a nondilated, hypertrophied left ventricle in the absence of any overt cause. A possible role of adrenergic innervation or of cellular calcium regulation is suggested by the presence of hyperdynamic left ventricular function and by the clinical and symptomatic improvement seen in patients treated with beta-receptor antagonists or calcium antagonists. Therefore, we measured the density of calcium-antagonist receptors and beta-adrenoceptors in the atrial myocardium of 16 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 19 patients with various other cardiac disorders. For comparison, we also measured the number of voltage-sensitive sodium channels. Calcium-antagonist binding sites, measured as the amount of dihydropyridine bound to atrial tissue, were increased by 33 percent in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (mean [+/- SD], 397 +/- 104 fmol per milligram of protein in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as compared with 299 +/- 108 in patients with other cardiac disorders; P less than 0.01). The densities of saxitoxin-binding sites on voltage-sensitive sodium channels and beta-adrenoceptors were the same in the two groups, although the density of beta-adrenoceptors was higher in atrial samples from patients receiving beta-receptor antagonists (165 +/- 86 fmol per milligram of protein [patients receiving beta-blockers] vs. 85 +/- 60 [patients not receiving beta-blockers]; P less than 0.04). The increase in the number of calcium-antagonist receptors in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy suggests that abnormal calcium fluxes through voltage-sensitive calcium channels may play a pathophysiologic part in the disease.", 
    "23": "Membrane conductance changes evoked in isolated guinea-pig or rabbit hepatocytes by hormonal stimulation were studied with the whole-cell patch clamp technique. In Cl-containing solutions, noradrenaline (NA), ATP or angiotensin II (AII) evoked an increase of conductance to both K (GK) and Cl (GCl) ions. Activation of GK occurred after a delay of several seconds and was sustained in the presence of hormone. Activation of GCl was transient, lasting several seconds, and arose either at the same time or shortly after the increase in GK. Conductances showed an initial rapid rise and slow oscillatory changes during maintained hormone application. The NA-induced current reversed at -19 mV in Cl solutions, between the equilibrium potentials for chloride (ECl = 0 mV) and potassium ions (EK = -85 mV), and at -75 mV, near EK, in Cl-free solution. In both conditions whole-cell current-voltage curves were linear in the range -100 mV to +40 mV. The conductance increase produced by NA to Cl- ions was about 50 nS, that to K+ ions was 6 nS. The potassium conductance increase was abolished by the polypeptide toxin apamin (50 nM). An increase in membrane current noise was associated with NA-evoked outward K+ current and blocked by apamin. Spectral analysis gave estimates of the elementary K channel conductance of 1.7 pS. Power spectra were fitted by two Lorentzian components, with average half-power frequencies of 2 and 190 Hz. These results are discussed in relation to the single-channel properties and indicate that the open probability of K channels during the NA response is high. In Cl solutions, with apamin to block the K conductance, no increase in current noise was detected during the large Cl conductance evoked by NA. This suggests either that Cl channels are of very low unitary conductance (less than 1 pS) or that Cl transport is due to a membrane carrier. The complex time-course of hormonally evoked conductances is not due to the properties of ion conductances per se but probably to underlying changes of intracellular second-messenger concentration.", 
    "24": "Yohimbine hydrochloride, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, was administered (3.3 mg/kg i.v.) to anesthetized normal dogs provided with a T-shaped catheter inserted in the pancreaticoduodenal vein. The effects on blood glucose levels and pancreatic hormones were investigated. We show that yohimbine induced an immediate and pronounced stimulatory effect on insulin secretion accompanied by a clear decrease in blood glucose levels. Yohimbine also stimulated the pancreatic secretion of somatostatin and glucagon. However, the secretion kinetics were not the same for the three hormones: the stimulation was rapid and immediate for insulin and somatostatin, whereas it was progressive for glucagon. All these stimulatory effects were suppressed by propranolol, thus implicating beta-adrenergic mechanisms. Bilateral cervical vagotomy markedly reduced the immediate effect of yohimbine on insulin secretion, suggesting that a central neural pathway was implicated. In contrast, the progressive elevation in glucagon secretion was not decreased by vagotomy. Our results suggest that yohimbine stimulates, at least in part, insulin secretion by blocking central alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "25": "The GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor has been solubilized from membrane preparations of bovine cerebral cortex and has been reconstituted, in a functionally active form, into phospholipid vesicles. In preliminary experiments, the receptor was labeled with the photoactive benzodiazepine [3H]flunitrazepam prior to solubilization. A peptide of apparent molecular weight 53,500 was specifically labeled by this method, and this was used as a marker for the receptor during the reconstitution procedures. The labeled protein was solubilized with approximately 40% efficiency by 1% beta-octyl glucoside. Reconstitution was achieved by mixing the solubilized proteins with a 4:1 mixture of soybean asolectin and bovine brain phospholipids, followed by chromatography on Sephadex G-50-80 to remove detergent. The incorporation of the GABAA receptor into membrane vesicles has been verified by sucrose gradient centrifugation in which the [3H]-flunitrazepam-labeled peptide comigrated with [14C]phosphatidylcholine used as a lipid marker. Vesicles prepared without labeled markers retained the ability to bind both [3H]flunitrazepam and the GABA analogue [3H]muscimol. Furthermore, the binding parameters were very similar to those measured using native membrane preparations. A novel fluorescence technique has been used to measure chloride transport mediated by the GABAA receptor in reconstituted vesicles. Chloride influx was rapidly stimulated in the presence of micromolar concentrations of muscimol and was blocked by preincubation of the membranes with muscimol (desensitization). Flux was also blocked by pretreatment with the competitive GABAA receptor blocker bicuculline or with the noncompetitive GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin.", 
    "26": "Fasting blood samples were obtained from 290 patients who were undergoing elective coronary-artery graft procedures, and cholesterol, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were measured. The 1983 National Heart Foundation of Australia's Risk Factor Prevalence Study was used as a source of age- and sex-matched \"control\" data. Of these patients, 80% had cholesterol levels of greater than 5.5 mmol/L; in 55% of patients, the level exceeded 6.5 mmol/L. Only 4% of patients who received a graft showed hypertriglyceridaemia alone (triglyceride level, greater than 2 mmol/L). Combined hyperlipidaemia (cholesterol level, greater than 5.5 mmol/L and triglyceride level, greater than 2.0 mmol/L) was present in 52% of subjects. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels exceeded 3.5 mmol/L in 69% of men and in 71% of women. In terms of five 10-year age intervals, mean plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels were elevated significantly in patients who had undergone a coronary-artery grafting procedure compared with those of subjects in the National Heart Foundation study. The mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were markedly-lower compared with those of the subjects in the National Heart Foundation study. Of those patients whose plasma cholesterol levels were less than 5.5 mmol/L, 97% of patients had high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels that were less than the mean level for subjects in the National Heart Foundation study. Thus, a very-high proportion of patients who underwent coronary-artery bypass surgery had lipid abnormalities which required intervention postoperatively.", 
    "27": "To investigate the significance of hyperventilation-induced ST segment depression, 329 consecutive patients with angina and documented coronary artery disease who underwent hyperventilation and exercise tests during pharmacologic washout were studied. The hyperventilation test induced ST segment depression in 79 patients. In 36 of these 79 patients, the electrocardiographic changes occurred early during overbreathing (Group I), whereas in 26 they occurred late during recovery (Group II). Seventeen patients developed ST segment depression both during over-breathing and during recovery (Group III). Group I patients had a higher frequency of history of angina during exercise, multivessel disease and lower tolerance to exercise as compared with patients in Group II. In Group I, the rate-pressure product at the time to onset of ST depression during overbreathing was similar to that during exercise (152 +/- 24 versus 148 +/- 42; p = NS), whereas in Group II the rate-pressure product at the time to onset of ST depression during recovery was comparable with that under control conditions (104 +/- 30 versus 98 +/- 27; p = NS) and far less than that required to produce ischemia during exercise (104 +/- 30 versus 201 +/- 56; p less than 0.0011). In nine Group III patients, the acute administration of propranolol prevented the early hyperventilation-induced ST segment depression, whereas nifedipine abolished the delayed hyperventilation-induced ST segment depression. These findings suggest that early hyperventilation-induced ST segment depression is due to increased oxygen demand in patients with poor coronary reserve and may be prevented by beta-adrenergic blockers, which are useful for lowering oxygen consumption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "The effects of propranolol and cimetidine on inhibition by cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol hydrochloride) of gastric carcinogenesis induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and on gastric acid secretion, serum gastrin level, and labelling index of the gastric mucosa were investigated in inbred Wistar rats. Rats received alternate-day injections of cysteamine (25 mg/kg body weight) with or without propranolol (dl-propranolol hydrochloride) (2 mg/kg bw) or cimetidine (50 mg/kg bw) in depot form after 25 weeks of oral treatment with MNNG. Prolonged administration of cysteamine significantly reduced the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the glandular stomach. A combination of cysteamine and propranolol significantly accelerated the inhibitory effect of cysteamine on gastric carcinogenesis. However, with concomitant administration of cysteamine and cimetidine, the incidence of adenocarcinoma was slightly but not significantly increased as compared to that after treatment with cysteamine alone. Administration of cysteamine caused a significant increase in gastric acid secretion and serum gastrin level, and a significant decrease in the labelling index of the antral mucosa. A combination of cysteamine and propranolol significantly increased gastric acid secretion by cysteamine alone and significantly decreased the labelling index of the antral mucosa. With this treatment, the serum gastrin level was significantly higher than the basal level, but the stimulated serum gastrin level was significantly lower than observed that after administration of cysteamine alone. In contrast, concomitant administration of cysteamine and cimetidine caused a significant decrease in gastric acid secretion and significant increase in the serum gastrin level as compared to the levels seen after treatment with cysteamine alone, but had no influence on the labelling index of the antral mucosa. These findings indicate that hypersecretion of acid, but not hypergastrinemia associated with hyposecretion of acid or achlorhydria, exerts a protective effect against gastric carcinogenesis, and that this effect may be related to its activity in decreasing proliferation of the antral mucosa.", 
    "29": "The possibility of discontinuing--compared to reducing--antihypertensive drug treatment was investigated in 606 male hypertensive patients with entry diastolic blood pressure (BP) in the range of 90 to 114 mm Hg. Diastolic BP was controlled at less than 90 mm Hg with 1 of 4 regimens: low dose hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), 25 mg twice daily; high dose HCTZ, 50 mg twice daily; or high dose HCTZ plus a low or high dose of a step II drug (propranolol, clonidine or reserpine). After 6 months of treatment that controlled BP, dosages were reduced in two-thirds of the patients. In those patients receiving low dose HCTZ and randomized to dose reduction, antihypertensive drugs were completely discontinued. Although approximately half of these patients remained normotensive for the first 6 months, a significantly greater proportion had elevation of BP compared to the control group, which continued to receive treatment (p less than 0.0001). In the high dose HCTZ drug group, the proportion of patients remaining normotensive did not differ among those stepped down to low dose HCTZ and the fully treated control group. While not achieving significance the trend was similar with the step II regimens. Although some patients remained normotensive after discontinuation of step II drugs, a greater proportion returned to elevated BP than when step II dosage was unchanged. Therefore, while stopping therapy may be effective in some patients, a decreased dosage is significantly more effective as a method for maintaining an antihypertensive effect. Decreasing drug dosages offers the dual benefit of minimizing side effects and reducing drug costs.", 
    "30": "Human parathyroid hormone (PTH) has been expressed in Escherichia coli as a cro-beta-galactosidase-hPTH fusion protein under temperature-sensitive control of the lambda phage PR promoter. The lacZ gene has been truncated to a different extent revealing an optimal length of the prokaryotic peptide portion between 199 and 407 amino acid residues. Up to 250 mg of pure fusion protein have been obtained from 1-liter E. coli culture by stepwise solubilization with urea. The linkage between the prokaryotic and the eukaryotic protein moiety consists of an Asp-Pro peptide bond and therefore is easily cleavable by acid treatment. A simple procedure for the purification of the hormone is described. The resulting recombinant hormone reacts with anti-PTH antibodies and stimulates renal adenylate cyclase identically to bovine or human PTH.", 
    "31": "The effectiveness of an intermittent regimen of transdermal nitroglycerin in chronic stable angina was evaluated in 206 patients using serial treadmill testing. After a placebo stabilization phase, patients were randomized to 4 weeks of double-blind treatment with transdermal nitroglycerin, 10 or 20 cm2 (equivalent to 5 or 10 mg/24 h) (Group A); transdermal nitroglycerin, 30 or 40 cm2 (equivalent to 15 or 20 mg/24 h) (Group B), or placebo. Patches were applied at 8:00 AM and removed at 8:00 PM each day throughout the study. Treadmill testing was performed 0, 4, 8 and 12 h after patch application at baseline (day 0) and on days 1, 15 and 29. After short-term application of the transdermal patches, treadmill walking time was greater for patients in both Group A and Group B than for the placebo group at all time points tested; differences from placebo were statistically significant at 12 h for Group A and at 4, 8 and 12 h for Group B. After 2 and 4 weeks of long-term therapy, treadmill walking time was again greater for Group B than for the placebo group at all postapplication time points; differences from placebo reached statistical significance at 4 h (2 weeks) and 8 h (2 and 4 weeks). The improvement in the treadmill walking time seen over the short-term in Group A was largely lost after 4 weeks of long-term therapy. Potentially important differences in the patient characteristics of the two active treatment groups, particularly the greater use of a beta-adrenergic blocker among patients in Group A, may have contributed to these observed differences in treatment effect. An unexpected finding was the ability of the placebo group to exercise longer than either active treatment group just before patch application during long-term therapy; nonetheless, absolute responsiveness to transdermal nitroglycerin after patch application remained virtually unchanged in both active treatment groups during the 4 week treatment period. Intermittent transdermal nitroglycerin therapy was well tolerated in the vast majority of patients; nine patients experienced an increase in nonexertional angina during the patch-off periods but completed the study uneventfully.", 
    "32": "We examined the effect of nicorandil and nipradilol on the ischemic myocardium in the isolated perfused rat heart. The heart was perfused by the working heart technique with an afterload pressure of 60 mm Hg and with a left atrial filling pressure of 9 mm Hg. Ischemia was induced for 20 min by lowering the afterload pressure. The afterload pressure was raised to 60 mm Hg again during reperfusion. Ischemia decreased the pressure-rate product, coronary flow, adenosine triphosphate level and creatine phosphate level, and increased the lactate level. Reperfusion could not restore the pressure-rate product nor the adenosine triphosphate level completely. Nicorandil (5 x 10(-5) and 1.5 x 10(-4) M) or nipradilol (10(-5), 5 x 10(-5) and 1.5 x 10(-4) M) was introduced 5 min before ischemia. Nipradilol preserved the levels of adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate after 20 min of ischemia and increased the extent of recovery of the pressure-rate product during reperfusion, whereas nicorandil did not. Nipradilol, but not nicorandil, can protect the myocardium against ischemic damage.", 
    "33": "The 5-HT agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP; 1-16 mg/kg i.p. or s.c.), trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP; 2-16 mg/kg i.p.) and quipazine (2.5-20 mg/kg i.p.) increased purposeless chewing behaviour in rats. However, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 0.025-4 mg/kg s.c.) and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeODMT; 0.25-8 mg/kg s.c.) were without effect on chewing behaviour. Chewing behaviour induced by m-CPP (6 mg/kg s.c.) was antagonised by pretreatment with the 5-HT antagonists methiothepin and mianserin, but not by ketanserin or spiperone, or ICS 205-930. m-CPP (6 mg/kg s.c.)-induced chewing behaviour was also antagonised by pretreatment with (-)-propranolol (20 mg/kg). Pretreatment with the anticholinergic drugs benzhexol (2.5 mg/kg), and scopolamine (1 mg/kg) antagonised m-CPP (6 mg/kg s.c.)-induced chewing behaviour, but methylscopolamine (1 mg/kg) had no effect. These data support the role of 5-HT receptors in the mediation of purposeless chewing behaviour and suggest an interaction between brain 5-HT and acetylcholine systems.", 
    "34": "Dopamine increases renal blood flow and dilates isolated afferent and efferent arterioles preconstricted with norepinephrine via dopamine 1 (DA1) receptors. DA1-receptor stimulation also results in dopamine-induced elevation of adenosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) in dog and rat renal arteries. The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of dopamine on cAMP accumulation in isolated canine superficial cortical afferent arterioles. The effect of Sch 23390, a specific DA1-receptor antagonist, on dopamine-stimulated cAMP accumulation was also examined. Forskolin (10(-5) M), a potent stimulator of adenylate cyclase, produced a greater than 11-fold increase in cAMP production compared with control. Dopamine produced a dose-dependent increase in cAMP accumulation in afferent arterioles at concentrations of 10(-4) M and 10(-6) M, Sch 23390 (2 x 10(-4) M) abolished dopamine (10(-4) M)-stimulated cAMP accumulation in afferent arterioles. The dopamine-induced increase in arteriolar cAMP accumulation was unaffected by propranolol (10(-4) M). Our results suggest that dopamine increases cAMP production in afferent arterioles via the DA1 receptor. Increased cAMP production may be responsible for dopamine-induced vasodilation in the afferent arteriole.", 
    "35": "We treated 3262 patients with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) within four hours of the onset of chest pain thought to be caused by myocardial infarction. Of these patients, 1636 were then randomly assigned to treatment according to an invasive strategy consisting of coronary arteriography 18 to 48 hours after the administration of rt-PA, followed by prophylactic percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) if arteriography demonstrated suitable anatomy; 1626 patients were randomly assigned to treatment according to a conservative strategy, as part of which arteriography and PTCA were to be performed only in patients with spontaneous or exercise-induced ischemia. In the group assigned to the invasive strategy, PTCA was attempted in 928 of the 1636 patients (56.7 percent); the procedure was anatomically successful in 93.3 percent. In the group assigned to the conservative strategy, 216 patients (13.3 percent) underwent clinically indicated PTCA within 14 days of the onset of symptoms. Reinfarction or death within 42 days, the primary end point, occurred in 10.9 percent of the group assigned to the invasive strategy and in 9.7 percent of those assigned to the conservative strategy (P not significant). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the ejection fraction at rest or during exercise, either at hospital discharge or six weeks after randomization. Eleven of 582 patients (1.9 percent) who received 150 mg of rt-PA and 15 of 2952 patients (0.5 percent) who received 100 mg of rt-PA had intracranial hemorrhage. A subgroup of 1390 patients who were eligible for short-term intravenous beta-blockade were randomly assigned to receive 15 mg of intravenous metoprolol immediately, followed by oral metoprolol, or oral metoprolol begun on day 6. The ejection fraction and the incidence of death in the two groups were similar during the hospital period. Total mortality within the first 6 days and at 42 days was also similar. However, in the group that received intravenous metoprolol, 16 patients had nonfatal reinfarctions and 107 patients had recurrent ischemic episodes by six days after entry into the study, as compared with 31 and 147 patients, respectively, among those randomly assigned to deferred oral beta-blockade (P = 0.02 and P = 0.005, respectively); the latter comparison was considered statistically significant according to the study criteria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "36": "To determine whether the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of beta-blockade differ among racial groups, we gave 10 men of Chinese descent and 10 American white men 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg of propranolol every eight hours; the dosages were given in random order, and each dose was given for one day. The degree of beta-blockade was measured as the reduction in the heart rate and blood pressure in the supine and upright positions and during treadmill exercise testing. The Chinese subjects had at least a twofold greater sensitivity to the beta-blocking effects of propranolol than the white subjects, as indicated by the mean (+/- SEM) plasma concentrations producing a 20 percent reduction in the heart rate in both the supine position (197 +/- 31 vs. 536 +/- 58 nmol per liter; P less than 0.05) and the upright position (131 +/- 27 vs. 343 +/- 39 nmol per liter; P less than 0.05) and after exercise testing (96 +/- 12 vs. 185 +/- 23 nmol per liter; P less than 0.05). In addition, the Chinese subjects had much greater sensitivity to the hypotensive effects of propranolol, as shown by the concentrations that reduced blood pressure by 10 percent in the supine position (73 +/- 5 vs. 748 +/- 7 nmol per liter; P less than 0.01) and in the upright position (89 +/- 5 vs. 401 +/- 6 nmol per liter; P less than 0.01). No difference in beta-receptor density or affinity of lymphocytes was found between the groups. The Chinese group had a 45 percent higher free fraction of propranolol in plasma, which may have contributed to the increased drug effect but cannot explain it entirely. This group metabolized propranolol more rapidly than the white group, which resulted in a 76 percent higher clearance of an oral dose (3740 +/- 737 vs. 2125 +/- 214 ml per minute; P less than 0.05) because of increased metabolism through multiple metabolic pathways. We conclude that Chinese men have greater sensitivity than white men to the effects of propranolol on heart rate and blood pressure. Decreased protein binding may be responsible in part, but most of the effect remains to be explained.", 
    "37": "Polyamines are important for protein synthesis and tissue growth. In rat salivary glands, the activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the enzyme catalysing the formation of putrescine, and the content of putrescine, spermidine, spermine and N1-acetylspermidine were assayed after parasympathetic or sympathetic nerve stimulation in the presence of various autonomic receptor blockers. Increases in ODC activity occurred on activation of non-adrenergic and non-cholinergic receptors in response to parasympathetic nerve stimulation and on activation of alpha(alpha 1)- as well as of beta(beta 1)-adrenoceptors in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation. Moreover, in parotid glands, a beta(beta 1)-adrenoceptor-mediated inverse pathway for putrescine formation seemed to exist: from spermidine via N1-acetylspermidine.", 
    "38": "The effect of long-term propranolol administration on esophageal varices, portocollateral shunting, portal pressure, hepatosplanchnic hemodynamics, and liver function was studied in a pig model with experimentally induced prehepatic portal hypertension and esophageal varices. Five pigs were treated with 160 mg propranolol daily from week 5 to week 24 after portal-vein banding, and five pigs served as nontreated controls. Administration of propranolol caused an initial, significant reduction (20%) of portal venous pressure, followed by a gradual increase to levels not different from control pressures. In contrast, a marked reduction of the caliber of the coronary vein and size of the esophageal varices was noticed. Twenty weeks of propranolol treatment did not change liver blood flow or liver function. We conclude that the size of the varices rather than portal venous pressure depicts the effect of propranolol treatment and suggest that the beneficial effect of propranolol on variceal bleeding can be explained by a reduction in the wall tension of the varices, initiated and maintained by a diminution of splanchnic blood flow.", 
    "39": "Heart rate, stroke volume, and intra-arterial blood pressure were monitored continuously in each of four monkeys, 18 consecutive h/day for several weeks. The mean heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and total peripheral resistance were calculated for each minute and reduced to hourly means. After base-line data were collected for approximately 20 days, observation was continued for equal periods of time under conditions of alpha-sympathetic blockade, beta-sympathetic blockade, and double sympathetic blockade. This was achieved by intra-arterial infusion of prazosin, atenolol, or a combination of both in concentration sufficient for at least 75% reduction of response to injection of agonists. The results confirmed previous findings of a diurnal pattern characterized by a fall in cardiac output and a rise in total peripheral resistance throughout the night. This pattern was not eliminated by selective blockade, of alpha- or beta-sympathetic receptors or by double sympathetic blockade; in fact, it was exacerbated by sympathetic blockade, indicating that the sympathetic nervous system attenuates these events. Because these findings indicate that blood volume redistribution is probably not the mechanism mediating the observed effects, we have hypothesized that a diurnal loss in plasma volume may mediate the fall in cardiac output and that the rise in total peripheral resistance reflects a homeostatic regulation of arterial pressure.", 
    "40": "The effect of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol on the increase in resting metabolic rate (RMR) induced by overfeeding was examined to determine whether increased beta-adrenergic activity contributes to this response. Six male subjects who were overfed with carbohydrate (1,600 excess kcal/day) for 10 days without drug treatment (control group) had increases (compared with values after 10 days of weight maintenance) in RMR after 6 days [0.24 +/- 0.06 kcal/min (22%)] and 10 days of overfeeding [0.17 +/- 0.03 kcal/min (15%)]. Eight male subjects were given a weight-maintenance diet for 10 days with oral propranolol treatment (40-60 mg every 6 h) over the last 7 days of this period. Five of these subjects were then overfed for 10 days, and three remained on the weight-maintenance diet; propranolol treatment continued until the end of the study. Propranolol significantly reduced RMR (mean 9%) before the onset of overfeeding but did not prevent increases in RMR after 6 days [0.18 +/- 0.05 kcal/min (16%)] and 10 days of overfeeding [0.17 +/- 0.03 kcal/min (15%)]. In the subjects who remained on the weight-maintenance diet throughout the study, there was no reversal of propranolol's initial reduction of RMR that would have falsely elevated the overfeeding effect. These data provide further evidence that the increase in RMR induced by overfeeding in humans is not mediated by increased beta-adrenergic activity.", 
    "41": "d-Propranolol eliminates the increased adenine nucleoside release from hypoperfused hearts [R. D. Wangler, D. F. DeWitt, and H. V. Sparks, Am. J. Physiol. 247 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 16): H330-H336, 1984]. To determine whether d-propranolol reduces adenosine formation or adenosine release into the vascular compartment, we measured myocardial tissue adenosine (TADO). Decreased formation would lower TADO, whereas decreased release would elevate TADO. Reduction of perfusion pressure by 50% reduced coronary flow (CF), venous oxygen tension (PVO2), and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) by approximately 40, 25, and 35%, respectively. Total adenosine and inosine released during 30 min of hypoperfusion increased 10- and 5-fold, respectively. Also, TADO increased from 2.68 +/- 0.37 to 5.17 +/- 0.67 nmol/g (P less than 0.05). In the presence of d-propranolol, the same reduction in perfusion pressure caused a similar decrease in CF and MVO2. d-Propranolol eliminated the release of adenosine and inosine associated with hypoperfusion. TADO after 30 min of hypoperfusion plus d-propranolol was not significantly increased (3.27 +/- 0.40 nmol/g) and was significantly less than hypoperfused hearts. When severe hypoperfusion was created by reducing perfusion pressure 75%, adenosine release still did not increase if d-propranolol was present. When adenosine release was plotted as a function of oxygen supply-consumption, they were related in a hyperbolic fashion. Despite the severity of hypoperfusion, in the presence of d-propranolol the supply-to-consumption ratio was similar to that of the control perfusion group (no drug). We conclude that d-propranolol blocks nucleoside formation during hypoperfusion by reducing oxygen demand such that a reduction of oxygen supply no longer stimulates adenosine formation.", 
    "42": "Topical application of bradykinin or capsaicin to abdominal visceral organs produces adrenergically mediated, reflex increases in mean arterial pressure and cardiac work. To determine the effects on coronary blood flow, the left main coronary artery of anesthetized cats was perfused at constant pressure with a servo-controlled pump. Cardiovascular parameters were measured during reflex stimulation before and after beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol. Before propranolol, reflex activation led to increases in the double product and myocardial oxygen consumption, usually accompanied by increases in coronary blood flow. However, in 32% of the observations, decreases in flow were observed. During beta-adrenoceptor blockade, reflex stimulation produced increases in cardiac work, whereas the increases in coronary blood flow were attenuated. Marked decreases in average coronary blood flow were observed more frequently (42%). In the presence of propranolol, contrary to the unblocked state, increases in oxygen consumption were achieved by increased oxygen extraction. Subsequent alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with phentolamine abolished all reflex changes. These data indicate that during stimulation of abdominal visceral chemoreceptors, the major coronary response is vasodilation, but in a sizable fraction of cases, abdominal visceral reflexes can produce sympathetically mediated coronary vasoconstriction.", 
    "43": "The complex architecture of the mammalian lung has hindered measurements of permeability of and transport by the intact alveolar epithelium. We compared properties of fetal rat alveolar buds and tracheas in submersion culture by microelectrode and micropuncture techniques. Both alveolar buds and tracheas form cysts that accumulate liquid for up to 3 wk in culture. The transepithelial electric potential difference (PD) of alveolar buds and tracheas (lumen negative, 1.2-3.5 and 8-21 mV, respectively) was abolished by metabolic inhibitors or ouabain in the bath. Despite the difference in PDs, both epithelial regions, after 1 or 2 wk in culture, exhibited the following. 1) Cl- activities and concentrations in luminal liquid were 13 and 34% higher than the bathing medium; Na+ and K+ concentrations were not different. 2) Bumetanide inhibited PD by 70%, whereas terbutaline increased PD by 45%. 3) Amiloride injected into the cyst lumen induced a 20% decrease in the PD of 1-wk explants but did not affect 2-wk preparations. Replacement of bath Na+ by choline decreased the PD of tracheas by 85% but did not change alveolar PD in the presence or absence of bumetanide. The pattern of cyst liquid composition and PD responses to drugs suggests that fetal rat alveolar and tracheal epithelia secrete Cl-, which drives volume flow.", 
    "44": "Concentrative transfer of amino acids from mother to fetus is affected by transport across both microvillous (maternal-facing) and basal (fetal-facing) plasma membranes of the human placental syncytiotrophoblast. Isolated basal plasma membrane vesicles were used to elucidate transport systems for neutral amino acids across this membrane. The concentration dependence and inhibition of zero-trans-alanine uptake were studied and four pathways for alanine uptake were defined as follows: 1) a sodium-dependent system shared by methylaminoisobutyric acid, which has the characteristics of an A system; 2) a sodium-dependent system resistant to inhibition by methylaminoisobutyric acid, which has the characteristics of an ASC system; 3) a sodium-independent system which may resemble an L system; 4) nonsaturable uptake. The microvillous membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast possesses systems similar to 1 and 3, but system 2 is unique to the basal plasma membrane. Active and passive transport of amino acids across both microvillous and basal plasma membranes may contribute to trophoblast amino acid uptake and nutrition and to the transfer of amino acids to the fetus.", 
    "45": "Since it has been suggested that propranolol could lead to hepatic encephalopathy, we undertook a study to assess the effects of propranolol on cerebral blood flow and cerebral functions. Sixteen patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and large esophageal varices and without major hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh score less than 14) or previous hepatic encephalopathy were randomized to receive either propranolol or placebo. The following measurements were performed before and 15 min after single intravenous administration of 15 mg propranolol or placebo and again 1 week after chronic oral administration of propranolol 160 mg per day or placebo: cerebral blood flow by the xenon-133 inhalation technique, quantitative electroencephalogram, psychometric test (number connection test), arterial ammonia, pH and pCO2, resting and exercise heart rates (after single administration, electroencephalogram, number connection test and biochemical measurements were not performed). Cerebral blood flow was not significantly modified by treatment (propranolol group: 80 +/- 23 vs. 76 +/- 11 and 83 +/- 9; placebo group: 73 +/- 10 vs. 75 +/- 11 and 81 +/- 18 ml per 100 gm per min, respectively, before and after single and repeated administration). Likewise, neither of the two treatments significantly altered number connection test, quantitative electroencephalogram index, arterial ammonia, pH and pCO2. We conclude that, in this population of cirrhotic patients, propranolol did not alter cerebral blood flow or neuropsychological functions. As a consequence, hemodynamic alterations cannot be considered as causes of possible cerebral side effects of propranolol in cirrhotic patients without severe hepatic dysfunction and previous hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "46": "Automaticity of SN and A-V junctional tissue was studied in 40 dogs in which a stable junctional rhythm was obtained following thermal ablation of the SN and sulcus terminalis. Atrial overdrive pacing studies were performed both before and after chemical denervation of the heart. Control sinus cycle and junctional CL were 438 +/- 13 ms and 751 +/- 23 ms, respectively. Chemical denervation resulted in significant prolongation of both junctional CL and maximal corrected junctional recovery time; junctional rate was down to 46 percent of the sinus rate observed before suppression of SN activity. Neither sinus CL nor maximal corrected SN recovery time changed significantly after administration of drugs. The basal autonomic nervous system has a relatively greater influence on the junctional pacemaker than on the normal SN in the dog and, when SN was suppressed, chemical denervation prolonged the junctional CL by 23 percent and junctional recovery time by 63 percent.", 
    "47": "The influence of three diets (olestra, triglyceride oil, and water) on the bioavailability of a single dose of propranolol, diazepam, norethindrone, and ethinyl estradiol was evaluated. For each drug the diets were randomly administered in a crossover fashion; a period of at least 14 days separated each of the drug studies. Blood samples were obtained before and after the oral administration of test drug and diet. Specific timing of blood samples varied for the respective drugs. AUCs were determined by the trapezoidal method. There were no statistical differences observed in the absorption of the various drugs evaluated in this study when administered with olestra, triglyceride oil, or water, except that the time to peak concentration of diazepam was significantly longer with the triglyceride oil than with olestra or water.", 
    "48": "Antitachycardia devices need more accurate means to identify arrhythmias. Previous studies have found that sinus rhythm can be distinguished from a variety of tachyarrhythmias by algorithms that are based on time-domain and frequency-domain analysis of intracardiac electrograms. Amplitude distribution analysis (time-domain) and power density spectral analysis (frequency-domain) are two of the techniques that have seemed to hold promise. However, previous studies have not evaluated whether lead maturation or drugs such as lidocaine, propranolol, verapamil, or isoproterenol can interfere with the ability of these algorithms to distinguish among cardiac rhythms. In the present study, five dogs had permanent atrial pacing leads placed. On a series of days, recordings were made from the atrial leads during sinus rhythm and induced sustained atrial fibrillation, both before and after administration of cardioactive drugs. For up to 1 month after implantation, progressive lead maturation did not prevent differentiation of atrial fibrillation from sinus rhythm by either amplitude distribution analysis or power density spectral analysis. However, the difference between the power density spectra of sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation became progressively less with time. Isoproterenol, lidocaine, verapamil, and propranolol had no consistent effects on amplitude distribution analysis of atrial electrograms during sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation. However, there were marked effects of drugs on amplitude distribution characteristics in individual dogs. Propranolol and lidocaine produced consistent changes in power density spectra during sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation, respectively; both drugs reduced the ability of power density spectral analysis to differentiate sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "The efficacy, safety, and electrophysiologic effects of intravenous and oral d-sotalol, an investigational class III antiarrhythmic agent, are not yet well characterized. We evaluated the electrophysiologic, antiarrhythmic, and hemodynamic effects of d-sotalol infusion (1.5 to 2.75 mg/kg) and of chronic oral therapy (200 to 400 mg bid) in 10 patients with chronic, paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias refractory to 5 +/- 2 standard agents. Four patients had paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), four had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, two had atrial flutter, and one had nonparoxysmal reciprocating junctional tachycardia (NPRJT). PSVT was inducible or spontaneously present in 4 of 4 before d-sotalol. After intravenous d-sotalol PSVT was noninducible in three patients and slowed by 40% in one. Atrial fibrillation was inducible or spontaneously present in 4 of 4 before therapy. After intravenous d-sotalol, one became noninducible, and three achieved rate-slowing (the mean falling from 69 to 61 bpm). In one patient, atrial flutter became noninducible; in another, d-sotalol slowed the rate of atrial flutter by 28%. D-sotalol restored sinus rhythm in the patient with NPRJT. Intravenous d-sotalol increased the sinus cycle length; the QTc, PR, and AH intervals; and the AV nodal functional refractory period, the AV nodal effective refractory period; and the right ventricular effective refractory period significantly. The atrial effective refractory period, sinoatrial conduction time, and corrected sinus recovery time tended to increase, but did not reach statistical significance. The QRS, PA, and HV intervals did not change. Mean BP fell 13.4 +/- 9.2% after intravenous d-sotalol, but no adverse symptoms developed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "51": "Changes in sinus node rate were measured as an estimate of reflex control of cardiac autonomic tone during 32 episodes of stable ventricular tachycardia (without loss of consciousness) and 21 episodes of unstable ventricular tachycardia (loss of consciousness requiring electrical cardioversion) in 32 patients without retrograde ventriculoatrial conduction. Sinus node rate was measured before induction of ventricular tachycardia (at 5 s intervals during tachycardia) and 5 s after termination of ventricular tachycardia. It increased from 85 +/- 12 beats/min to a maximum of 109 +/- 25 beats/min during stable ventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.001) and from 82 +/- 15 beats/min to a maximum of 105 +/- 34 beats/min during unstable ventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.001). During unstable ventricular tachycardia, the increase in sinus rate was more abrupt and was followed by a sharp decrease beginning before termination of the tachycardia and resulting in a slower rate after termination (56 +/- 15 beats/min) than before tachycardia (p less than 0.001). Stable ventricular tachycardia resulted in a continuous increase of sinus node rate, which remained higher after termination (102 +/- 15 beats/min) than before tachycardia (p less than 0.001). Autonomic mechanisms responsible for changes in sinus rate were evaluated by reinducing the ventricular tachycardia after beta-adrenergic blockade by propranolol in 10 patients.

The authors found a fourfold differentiation of glucose consumption between particular placentas. In the experiment these values differed from 2.63 mumol/g/h to 10.27 mumol/g/h.", 
    "53": "Ninety-seven patients with recent or active variceal bleeding were randomly assigned to oral propranolol, endoscopic sclerotherapy plus oral propranolol, or transhepatic sclerotherapy plus oral propranolol. The effects of treatment on the number of units transfused, rebleeding of any magnitude, major rebleeding, and death were assessed in these patients, 82% of whom were alcoholic and 81% Child's Class C. After a minimum follow-up interval of 2 yr (range, 27-65 mo), major rebleeding rates were 65% for propranolol alone, 45% for endoscopic sclerotherapy plus propranolol, and 60% for transhepatic sclerotherapy plus propranolol. The corresponding death rates were 81% for propranolol alone, 55% for endoscopic sclerotherapy plus propranolol, and 66% for transhepatic sclerotherapy plus propranolol (p = 0.03). Thirty-three patients (34%) never received propranolol; 8 due to medical contraindications and 25 because they died or bled enough to meet the definition of treatment failure within 3 or 4 days of randomizations (no significant differences among treatment groups). Patients assigned to propranolol alone bled sooner, bled more units, and had a higher mortality rate than patients treated by endoscopic sclerotherapy plus propranolol. Patients treated with transhepatic sclerotherapy plus propranolol had intermediate results. Propranolol alone is inadequate treatment for esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with advanced liver disease.", 
    "54": "210 patients with mild-moderate high blood pressure have been studied. These patients were followed up for 4-6 weeks. Fifty patients were treated with 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide + 5 mg amiloride daily; 40 with 160 mg oxprenolol daily; 22 with 30-40 mg nifedipine daily; 38 with 240 mg verapamil daily and 60 with 50-100 mg captopril daily. We have observed: 1. All treatments have similar antihypertensive effectiveness. 2. Decrement in blood pressure was correlated with initial blood pressure in all treatments, directly. 3. This effectiveness was correlated positively with age in treatment with both diuretics and calcium-antagonists, and an inverse correlation with both beta-blockers and captopril. 4. It had no correlation between age and initial blood pressure in diuretic or beta-blocker treated groups. So diuretics shall be suggested in elderly patients and beta-blockers in younger patients. 5. The greater effectiveness of calcium-antagonists in the elderly should be explained because these patients have a higher initial blood pressure. 6. In this work there is an inverse correlation between age and initial blood pressure in the captopril-treated group; it should explain the greater effectiveness in younger persons. 7. Nothing opposes the use of calcium-antagonists or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor in all age groups.", 
    "55": "The pharmacological effects of guinea pig vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were studied in isolated perfused guinea pig hearts. Bolus injections of VIP produced a dose-dependent tachycardia that was not affected by atenolol. A decrease in amplitude of ventricular contractions occurred in response to all doses of VIP. This response was preceded by a small increase in amplitude in 3 of 6 hearts at the highest dose. VIP produced a decrease in perfusion pressure which was prominent after coronary tone was elevated with [Arg8]-vasopressin. The present findings support speculation that VIP may have a role in the regulation of heart rate and coronary blood flow.", 
    "56": "A study of the central hemodynamics in the course of treatment with anaprilin of 137 hypertensive patients with different clinico-pathogenetic variants and types of blood circulation indicates that the hemodynamic basis of hypotensive effect of the drug in patients with the hyperdynamic type is a reduction of the cardiac output and normalization of the changed general peripheral vascular resistance (GPVR) while patients with the hypodynamic type showed a distinct GPVR reduction and an increase of the cardiac output values. A hypotensive effect of anaprilin was noted in 82.5%.", 
    "57": "The hemodynamic effects of anaprilin at various hours of the day in patients with essential hypertension depends on the initial type of central hemodynamics. The negative inotropic effect of anaprilin in the hyperkinetic type is revealed with high frequency at all hours of the day, in the eukinetic type at 10 p. m. and in the hypokinetic type at 5 p. m. In the initial hyperkinetic type of hemodynamics the hypotensive effect of anaprilin is pronounced at midday and 10 p.m., in the eukinetic type at 7 a. m., midday and 5 p. m. and in the hypokinetic type at 7 a. m.", 
    "58": "Determination of the slow isoenzymes of carbon esterases (SICE) in the urine by the disc-electrophoresis techniques was used as a marker of kidney impairment in 90 patients with II stage essential hypertension. In obsidan and visken treatment the frequency of SICE detection in the urine has increased from 30-50 to 70-100 per cent; the effective renal blood flow was reduced and specific peripheral resistance was increased and leg blood flow deteriorated. Subsequent administration of trental. phentolamine and corinfar alleviated the unfavourable effect of beta-adrenoblockers, enhanced renal blood flow, decreased the frequency of SICE detection to the initial level and improved the results of treatment.", 
    "59": "Examination included 70 patients with diabetes mellitus in combination with arterial hypertension of different origin (II stage essential hypertension and symptomatic renal arterial hypertension). Crystepin (2-3 tablets per 24 h) in combination with beta-adrenoblocker obsidan (40-80 mg/24 h) was used for treatment. Basic hemodynamic parameters and the state of the renin-aldosterone system were determined. The hemodynamic hypotensive effects in these patients due to the influence of the above therapy are uniform and depend on the form of attendant arterial hypertension. The hypotensive effect of crystepin used in combination with obsidan was more pronounced in patients with diabetes and II stage essential hypertension than that in those with diabetes and renal hypertension. The concentration of aldosterone and renin activity of blood plasma in patients with diabetes and arterial hypertension during treatment with crystepin and obsidan had no regular connection with the hemodynamic parameters.", 
    "60": "Amiodarone and propranolol have been known to inhibit the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) but their direct effect on the thyroid gland is not understood. We therefore investigated the action of the two drugs on the functional properties of human thyroid follicles embedded in collagen gel. Amiodarone and propranolol induced a dose-dependent reduction or blocking of the follicular production of cyclic AMP (cAMP), thyroglobulin (Tg) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) under 200 microU/ml medium. Small drug doses and the drug solvents did not affect the follicular secretion. The inhibiting effect of amiodarone and propranolol on follicular production of cAMP, Tg and FT3 appears to result from several factors: (1) inhibition of thyroid 5'-deiodinase; (2) amiodarone high iodine content; (3) a quinidine-like effect of propranolol involving a membrane-stabilizing mechanism.", 
    "61": "Hemodynamic (blood pressure and heart rate) responses of conscious drug-naive rats were studied following intravenous (i.v.) infusion of sterile saline, morphine sulphate, and then naloxone hydrochloride, as well as of other groups previously injected with morphine sulphate. Those groups chronically given morphine sulphate received twice daily injections of morphine sulphate (5 mg/kg, s.c. per injection) for 3 or 6 days before testing with the i.v. infusion of morphine sulphate. Drugs were infused (135 microL/min) through an indwelling femoral venous catheter via a Harvard infusion pump, and blood pressure was recorded from the abdominal aorta via a femoral arterial catheter. Other pretreatment studies were done to determine the receptor mechanisms mediating the blood pressure responses of drug-naive and chronic morphine-treated rats, whereby equimolar doses (0.32 mumol) of specific receptor antagonists were given as a bolus i.v. injection 5 min after saline but before subsequent infusion with morphine sulphate. Intravenous infusion of morphine sulphate (7.5 mg/kg total over 15 min) to drug-native rats caused a transient but precipitous fall in mean arterial pressure and mean heart rate with an associated rise in mean pulse pressure; these effects were blocked in other groups pretreated with atropine. Interestingly, however, rats chronically injected with morphine sulphate for 3 days previously evoked a transient pressor response when subsequently infused i.v. with morphine sulphate, actions that were blocked in other groups when pretreated i.v. with 0.32 mumol of phentolamine, yohimbine, prazosin, or guanethidine. A greater and persistent pressor response occurred following morphine infusion to groups of rats previously injected over 6 days with morphine sulphate, which was associated with tachycardia during the later stages of the 15-min morphine sulphate infusion period. The prolonged pressor and tachycardic responses of this 6-day chronically injected group were completely blocked in another group pretreated i.v. with both phentolamine and propranolol (0.32 mumol). The results suggest that morphine sulphate infusion to conscious, drug-naive rats evokes classical hypotensive effects due to decreases in mean heart rate caused by activation of parasympathetic vagal activity. With 3 or 6 days of chronic morphine sulphate administration beforehand, subsequent i.v. infusion of morphine sulphate evoked pressor actions felt to be caused by a progressive activation of the sympathetic nervous system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "62": "60 patients with mild arterial hypertension are studied, divided into three groups according to their heart rate (HR): 20 with heart rate below 70 b.p.m.; 20 with heart rate between 70 and 80 b.p.m., and 20 with heart rate above 80 b.p.m. In every group, 10 patients were treated with atenolol and the other 10 patients with chlorthalidone. The cases of bad tolerance or bad response to any of these drugs were included in the other subgroup, so that a total number of 71 responses to drugs were studied. It has been found that the hypertension in patients having HR above 80 b.p.m. has a better response to atenolol. On the other hand, in patients having HR below 70 b.p.m. the response is better to chlorthalidone. In those patients with HR between 71 and 79 a similar response to both drugs is observed, nevertheless the decrease of the diastolic pressure is significantly bigger with atenolol. We arrive at the conclusion that when the HR is above 70 b.p.m. and especially above 80 b.p.m., better results are obtained using atenolol than chlorthalidone.",

Pindolol significantly increased both high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), while very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) was significantly decreased. Apo A-II levels were increased significantly and the apo B/apo A-I ratio, which is one of the atherogenic indexes, was decreased significantly after pindolol therapy. Total cholesterol, HDL subfraction cholesterols, the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, triglycerides, apo A-I, apo B, apo C-II, apo C-III, and apo E did not change significantly.", 
    "64": "On the basis of clinical and audiological examinations of 102 tuberculosis patients who were on a combined treatment which included aminoglycoside antibiotics (streptomycin and canamycin), neurosensory disorders of the hearing function were detected in 75% of them. A clinical trial of obsidan, a beta-blocking agent, was performed in which it was used as a protective drug against ototoxic antibiotics given to 112 patients. Its combined application with antibiotics of the aminoglycoside series decreased their toxic effect from 75.6% to 21.4%.", 
    "65": "Quality of life (QL) was assessed in relation to drug therapy in 539 patients who were still alive five years after myocardial infarction (MI), and the interaction between drug therapy and QL was investigated. The patients originally participated in a double-blind trial that evaluated the effect of early administration of the beta blocker metoprolol. A cardiac follow-up questionnaire (CFQ) and the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) were answered by 82%. In the CFQ, sel-fassessed cardiac symptoms, medication (diuretics, digitalis, antiarrhythmics, long-acting nitrates, beta blockers, psychoactive drugs), smoking habits, and work status were described. NHP described QL within the sections of mobility, energy, pain, sleep, emotional reactions, and social isolation. The independent relation between morbidity, drugs, and QL was analyzed multivariately. Apart from symptoms of angina pectoris and dyspnoea, anxiety resulted in impaired QL. A relation between diuretics and decreased QL was found, but no indications of adverse effects of the beta blocker metoprolol.", 
    "66": "Long Evans rats were given atenolol doses ranging from 0.27 to 5.4 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection Animals were dosed once every 2 hr for a total of five doses. Atenolol concentrations 1 hr after the last dose were measured from simultaneously obtained plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples CSF concentrations of atenolol were not proportional to plasma concentrations. The ratio of CSF/plasma concentrations was higher (0.33) at lower plasma atenolol levels (less than 100 ng/ml) than at the higher atenolol plasma levels (0.05) (P less than 0.001). The relationship between plasma and cerebrospinal fluid atenolol concentrations was best described by the sum of a Michaelis-Menten and linear function. Animals were also given atenolol doses and then subjected to global cerebral ischemia. The relationship of atenolol concentrations from plasma and CSF in these animals was linear, with a constant partition ratio of 0.02. Together these data show that atenolol partitioning between plasma and CSF is nonlinear and possibly an energy-dependent process.", 
    "67": "Ten male Sprague-Dawley rats received 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesions of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle and 10 others underwent control operations. The lesion depleted levels of noradrenaline in the hippocampus to 2% of those in the controls. All rats were then trained for 16 sessions to lever-press in a Skinner box on a variable interval 18 sec schedule of food-reinforcement, then for 42 days on a successive discrimination between periods of variable interval (VI 18 sec) food-reinforcement and periods of extinction. This report describes the effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 5 mg/kg) and propranolol (5 and 10 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally in both groups on modified ABBA designs after this training. Both drugs increased the response rates in extinction periods. The effect of propranolol was similar at each dose and smaller than that of CDP. Although CDP and propranolol (5 mg/kg) increased variable interval response rates also, this could not account for the effect on extinction response rates. Responding did not differ between the lesioned and control animals and the effects of drugs were similar in each group. It is unlikely that CDP or propranolol release nonrewarded responding by disrupting transmission in the dorsal noradrenergic bundle.", 
    "68": "Reduced bioavailability (F) due to hepatic first-pass extraction of an oral dose (D) is a well-known pharmacokinetic phenomenon. An integrated solution for Michaelis-Menten kinetics of the first-pass effect is derived from the maximal metabolic rate (Vm), volume of distribution (Vd), first order absorption rate constant (ka), Michaelis constant (Km), and liver blood flow (Q). F = 1 - VmVd/kaD ln (1 + kaD/QKm) This equation for single dosage can also be extended to steady state kinetics after multiple dosing in which the amount of a drug present in the hepatic circulation is considered. According to the literature, the bioavailability of a single 80 mg oral dose of propranolol (F = 0.22) increases after multiple doses Fss = 0.36). Based on the first pass equations for single dosage and multiple dosing, the maximal metabolic rate (Vm = 0.043 mg l-1 h-1) corresponding to 310 mg per day and the Michaelis constant (Km = 0.10 mg/l) were calculated for propranolol. Incorporation of nonlinear plasma protein binding in this concept may explain the lack of threshold phenomenon for a single dose of less than 40 mg propranolol. Zero order absorption kinetics could explain why cumulation kinetics seem linear even at an excessive dosage of 960 mg propranolol per day. From these derivations it may be concluded that multiple dosing, increase in plasma protein binding, high absorption rate, and increased portal venous blood flow will increase bioavailability, whereas slow release formulations, fractional drug dosage, and saturable absorption kinetics will decrease bioavailability of first-pass drugs like propranolol.", 
    "69": "Beta-blockers are among the most widely used antihypertensive drugs. They differ from each other in regard to several factors such as: beta-agonist activity, beta 1-selectivity and solubility. Aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of obesity on the kinetics and the antihypertensive effect of two Beta-blockers with different solubility such as: the water-soluble, atenolol and the liposoluble, metoprolol. The study was carried out according to an open randomized cross-over design. Eight obese hypertensive patients, after a two week washout period, were randomly allocated to a four week treatment. After a two week intermediate washout period, each patient switched to the other treatment for an additional four week period. On the first and the last day of each treatment the subjects were hospitalized to collect blood samples for the assay of the two drugs and to measure cardiovascular parameters. Obesity does not exert any effect on the kinetics of the water-soluble beta-blocker, atenolol, while markedly interferes with that of the liposoluble, without any apparent influence on its anti-hypertensive effect. These findings extend to obese hypertensives the concept that the plasma concentrations of beta-blocking agents are not reliable predictors of their therapeutic effect.", 
    "70": "Cardiovascular response to 2 min of isometric handgrip exercise at 50% of maximum voluntary contraction was studied echocardiographically in 10 essential hypertensives, before and during treatment with atenolol for a mean of 2 months. The patients responded with increases in heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, cardiac output and calculated triple product, no changes in stroke volume and total peripheral resistance, and decreases in ejection fraction, mean velocity of circumferential shortening and mean diastolic posterior wall velocity of the left ventricle before treatment. Chronic atenolol therapy attenuated the increases in heart rate, blood pressure and triple product, and the decreases in ejection fraction, mean velocity of circumferential shortening and mean diastolic posterior wall velocity of the left ventricle but resulted in a marked increase in total peripheral resistance. The pressure response and triple product rise in response to isometric handgrip exercise were also decreased. This suggests an obvious advantage to hypertensive patients who may, therefore, be protected from the risk of cardiovascular complications following isometric exercise.", 
    "71": "1. The effects of several drugs, including antagonists of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and antisera to VIP or peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI), on relaxation responses of guinea-pig isolated trachea to electrical field stimulation (EFS) have been examined. 2. beta-Adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol only partially blocked the inhibitory response to EFS, but had no effect in tissues from animals pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine or reserpine. 3. Neither adenosine deaminase, in the presence of dipyridamole, nor the potent adenosine antagonist NPC205 (1,3-n-dipropyl-8-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-xanthine) had any effect on the inhibitory response to EFS. 4. The VIP antagonists, [Ac-Tyr1, D-Phe2]-GRF(1-29)-NH2 and [4-Cl-D-Phe6, Leu17]-VIP had no effect on the inhibitory response to EFS. Moreover, they were without effect on responses to exogenous VIP or PHI. 5. Overnight incubation with VIP antisera markedly reduced the inhibitory response to EFS. PHI antisera had a similar, but smaller effect. 6. In the presence of a concentration of VIP that is maximal for its relaxant effect, inhibitory responses to electrical stimulation were greatly inhibited. 7. Naloxone and reactive blue 2 each had no effect on inhibitory responses indicating that endogenous opioids and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) respectively are not involved. 8. The results suggest that VIP and PHI, but not adenosine, contribute to non-adrenergic, noncholinergic inhibitory nerve responses of guinea-pig trachea. Moreover, the surprising lack of effect of both VIP antagonists on these responses, and in particular, on responses to exogenous VIP, suggests that the receptors mediating VIP-induced tracheal relaxation are different from those that mediate pancreatic secretion.", 
    "72": "The effect of propranolol (0.6 mg/kg b.w.) on the functional state of the central and vegetative nervous system was studied in 60 apparently healthy of different age by means of electroencephalography and spectral analysis of the cardiac rhythm. In the young subjects propranolol produced inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, while in the elderly and very elderly subjects it was predominantly an activating one. The elderly versus young subjects showed a more marked impairment of the sympathetic effects on the cardiac rhythm due to propranolol administration. It was a characteristic feature of propranolol action to display a disaccord between its effects on the central nervous system and vegetative control of the cardiac rhythm in the very elderly people.", 
    "73": "In experiments with Ehrlich ascites tumor cells with the use of a specific thiol blocker, 6,6'-dithiodinicotinic acid, it was shown that thiols of a cell plasmic membrane are necessary for the radioprotective effect of mercaptoethylamine to be realized.", 
    "74": "The objective of this investigation was to characterize the effects of acetaldehyde (ACA) on sinus node automaticity (SNA). Guinea pig sinoatrial preparations superfused with Tyrode's solution at 37 degrees C were used. Intracellular microelectrodes were used to monitor SN rate (SNR). Acetaldehyde 3 X 10(-5) M had no effect on SNR, while 3 X 10(-3) M had a positive chronotropic action. The increase in SNR was associated with an increase in the slope of the slow diastolic depolarization (SDD) of subsidiary pacemaker fibers, with no change in the maximum diastolic potential (MDP). Acetaldehyde 3 X 10(-2) M exerted a biphasic effect: the SNR was enhanced and then depressed. Propranolol blocked the positive component of this chronotropic action. The negative component was not modified by propranolol, phentolamine, or atropine. It is concluded that ACA exerts both positive and negative chronotropic actions on the guinea pig sinus node. The positive component of this biphasic effect is mediated through a beta-adrenergic mechanism and it is associated with an increase in the SDD. The negative component is not due to alpha- or beta-adrenergic or muscarinic stimulation.", 
    "75": "The effects of oral sotalol were compared with the findings obtained in the baseline study of a group of 26 consecutive patients with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation and inducible ventricular tachycardia. The mean age was 62 years and the mean ejection fraction 33%. The number of non-inducible patients after sotalol administration (mean dose of 251 +/- 81 mg day-1) was 13 out of 21 (62%). The cycle length of the induced tachycardia changed from 293 +/- 32 to 303 +/- 41 ms (non-significant (NS]. The coupling interval of the first extrastimulus did not lengthen for the subgroup with persistent inducibility. The number of patients requiring defibrillation during the induction study did not decrease on (2/8) or off drugs (6/22). After the first administration of oral sotalol, two patients developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or torsade de pointes and one suffered from left ventricular failure. Long-term treatment with sotalol was given to 15 non-inducible patients, and two inducible patients, combined with an AICD or a pacemaker. Over a mean follow-up period of 13 months, three recurrences were observed in these 17 patients, including the patient with the AICD. This represents an efficacy of 82% for patients chronically treated with a low dose of oral sotalol.", 
    "76": "The isovolumic index has been proposed as a noninvasive index of left ventricular function which, unlike the traditional systolic time index, incorporates the period of isovolumic relaxation. The responses of the isovolumic index and the systolic time index to three cardioactive drugs (isoproterenol, propranolol and verapamil) were assessed by measurements of ejection time (ET), isovolumic contraction time (IVC) and isovolumic relaxation time (IVR) in 23 dogs instrumented with high fidelity micromanometers and ultrasonic crystals. Isoproterenol infusions resulted in improvements in both the isovolumic and systolic time indices as a result of significant shortening of ET, IVC and IVR. Propranolol infusions caused significant and parallel increases of IVC (P less than 0.01) and ET (P less than 0.05) but failed to cause prolongation of either the systolic time index, defined as (IVC/ET) or deterioration of regional function. A higher propranolol dose caused significant increases in ET, IVC (P less than 0.001) and IVR (P less than 0.05), yet neither the systolic time index or the isovolumic index (IVC + IVR/ET) were prolonged, and regional function remained normal. Verapamil infusion caused an upward, nonsignificant trend in the isovolumic index and no change in the systolic time index. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated a similar load dependency of both indices and a higher inverse correlation of the isovolumic index with fractional shortening. The systolic time index showed a higher dependency on peak positive dP/dt whereas only the isovolumic index showed dependency on the isovolumic relaxation time constant. When altered loading conditions are accounted for, the isovolumic index shows directional changes that reflect changes in peak positive dP/dt, the isovolumic relaxation time constant and regional shortening.", 
    "77": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of some alpha and beta sympathomimetic and sympatholytic drugs on respiratory impedance in healthy conscious calves. Ten Friesian calves were investigated in this study. The forced oscillation technique was used to measure the resistance (Rrs) and the reactance (Xrs) of the respiratory system at frequencies ranging from 4 to 26 Hz. Isoprenaline (1 microgram/kg i.v.), propranolol (3 micrograms/kg i.v.), noradrenaline (2 micrograms/kg i.v.), xylazine (20 micrograms/kg i.v.) and yohimbine (0.25 mg/kg i.v.) were were administered. Isoprenaline induced a significant decrease of Rrs. An increase of Rrs after administration of propranolol was observed but without any change of the frequency dependence of Rrs. A small increase in the resonant frequency was also recorded. A decrease of Rrs was recorded after yohimbine injection. Noradrenaline and xylazine administration increased the resistances and the resonant frequency and induced a negative frequency dependence of Rrs. These results suggest that (1) the major effects of beta adrenergic drugs are on the central airways, (2) the alpha adrenergic system may play a role on the regulation of bronchomotor tone in calves, (3) the effects of alpha adrenergic drugs are on both central and peripheral airways and (4) the forced oscillation technique allows the differentiation of calibre changes occurring in small and large airways.", 
    "78": "Casual blood pressure (BP) and ambulatory BP (mean 24-h BP) were determined in 23 untreated patients with essential hypertension and in 11 normotensive healthy control subjects. Mean 24-h BP was significantly lower than casual BP in patients with essential hypertension, but not in control subjects. This was demonstrated in the patients who did not work during the ambulatory BP monitoring and in the patients with newly recognized hypertension, whereas no differences were revealed either in the patients who went to work or had a known duration of hypertension longer than 6 months. The size of the difference between casual BP and mean 24-h BP was unaffected by antihypertensive therapy with metoprolol and also individually reproducible. An accordance between casual and ambulatory BP measurements in evaluation of the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment was found in 75% of the patients. Casual BP and mean 24-h BP were weakly correlated both before and during antihypertensive treatment. It is concluded that the higher casual BP than ambulatory BP in essential hypertension may be a specific characteristic of the disease. Both work and known duration of hypertension longer than 6 months eliminate the difference between casual ambulatory BP in essential hypertension. Ambulatory BP monitoring seems to be superior to casual BP measurements in the evaluation of antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "79": "Twenty-three elderly hypertensive patients, who remained hypertensive despite treatment with 2.5 mg bendrofluazide once daily, were randomised to receive, in addition to the diuretic, placebo, or a low-dose (80 mg) or a high-dose (160 mg) of long-acting propranolol once daily in a double-blind crossover study. Each randomised treatment period was of four weeks' duration. Blood pressure was assessed in the supine and standing positions, as well as after an individualised exercise test. Evaluations were carried out at least 24 hours after the last dose of medication. Sitting blood pressure fell from 196.2 +/- 21.3/107.2 +/- 11.3 mmHg to 193.1 +/- 17.5/106.0 +/- 15.9 mmHg for bendrofluazide alone, 193.2 +/- 24.76/97.3 +/- 11.9 mmHg for bendrofluazide plus long-acting propranolol (80 mg) and 187.2 +/- 19.6/102.1 +/- 11.2 mmHg for bendrofluazide plus long-acting propranolol (160 mg). The three randomised treatments yielded standing pressures of 191.3 +/- 20.5/106.2 +/- 13.5 mmHg, 192.4 +/- 29.0/99.6 +/- 12.6 mmHg and 192.4 +/- 28.0/106.0 +/- 8.6 mmHg for bendrofluazide alone, and bendrofluazide plus low- and high-dose, long-acting propranolol respectively, compared with the pretreatment standing blood pressure of 193.4 +/- 18.4/108.4 +/- 14.8 mmHg. There appeared to be no significant effect of any treatment on systolic blood pressures in either sitting or standing positions. No statistically significant differences between the three randomised treatments with regard to post-exercise diastolic pressure were observed, except for a small but significantly greater reduction during treatment with the low-dose, long-acting propranolol compared with the high-dose, long-acting propranolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "80": "The antihypertensive effects of nisoldipine, a calcium channel blocker, and atenolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, were compared in patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension. Both drugs produced significant reductions in blood pressure from the 8th week through the end of the 12-week treatment period. The hear rate decreased significantly in the atenolol group but not in the nisoldipine group. Following oral administration of 50 mg of captopril, the rise in plasma renin activity was significantly smaller in both treatment groups than in normotensive controls. The magnitude of the pressor response during a hand-grip test tended to be smaller in both groups of patients than in the controls, with no significant difference between the treated groups. Although the plasma catecholamine concentration rose significantly in the control and nisoldipine groups, there were no significant intergroup differences in these parameters. The hemoglobin, GOT, creatinine, total cholesterol and serum sodium and potassium concentrations all decreased significantly in the nisoldipine group, although the values remained within normal limits. These results indicate that both nisoldipine and atenolol significantly suppress both plasma renin activity and the pressor response to stress leading to reduction of blood pressure.", 
    "81": "The mechanism involved in the genesis of the rat paw oedema caused by intraplantar (IPL) injection of Bothrops jararaca venom (BJV) has been investigated. IPL injection of BJV (1 to 30 micrograms/paw) caused a dose- and time-related oedematogenic effect. Oedema was maximal within 1 h after BJV injection, was partially reduced at 6 h and disappeared completely within 24 h. No systemic effect was observed. Previous heating of BJV at 100 degrees C for 3 to 30 min caused a significant inhibition (25%) of its oedematogenic activity. Daily IPL injections of BJV (10 micrograms/paw) for 4 days attenuated BJV-induced oedema (26%), but did not influence oedema-induced by PAF-acether, serotonin (5-HT) and histamine (His), indicating the absence of cross desensitization. In the paw desensitized by daily IPL injections of PAF-acether, BJV induced a full oedematogenic response also indicating absence of cross desensitization. Different groups of drugs including alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists (prazosin and yohimbine), inhibitors of both cyclo- and lipo-oxygenase (indomethacin, nordihydroguaiaretic acid), inhibitors of phospholipase A2 (dexamethasone and mepacrine) caused marked inhibition of BJV-induced rat paw oedema, whereas antagonists of 5-HT, PAF-acether and H1-histamine receptors were less effective. Pre-treatment with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, a Ca2+ channel blocker and a H2-histamine antagonist failed to affect BJV-induced oedema. Pre-treatment of the animals with captopril did not interfere with BJV-induce oedema, suggesting that kinins are not insolved in the genesis of oedema. Association of BJV with 5-HT and PAF did not potentiate the BJV-induced oedema.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "82": "A study of comparative antianginal efficiency of metoprolol (betaloc) and propranolol (anaprilin) in 30 patients with angina of effort, receiving single doses and courses of the treatment, demonstrated similar efficiency of the two drugs in 63.3% of the patients. In 30%, antianginal effect of metoprolol was superior to that of propranolol. Prognosis of treatment efficiency on the basis of an acute pharmacologic test was possible in 93.3% of cases with metoprolol, and in 83.3% with propranolol. The results of the acute pharmacological test help to substantiate its dose and schedule of administration.", 
    "83": "The present paper reports a double-blind, cross-over, randomized study in which 31 patients (62 eyes) suffering from open-angle glaucoma were included. These patients were treated for one year with 0.5% levobunolol and 0.5% timolol ophthalmic solutions and followed up. Tonographic examinations of outflow facility showed a statistically significant increase following topical applications of 0.5% levobunolol, while there was little change with 0.5% timolol. The difference in the effect of outflow facility due to instillations of 0.5% levobunolol and 0.5% timolol can be explained by the different pharmacokinetic profiles of the two beta-blocker solutions in topical ocular application.", 
    "84": "The effect on the intraocular pressure of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma of a combination of timolol 0.5% with epinephrine 0.5% plus guanethidine 3% was studied and compared with the effects of timolol alone, of epinephrine 0.5% plus guanethidine 3%, and of other glaucoma drugs. The combination of timolol 0.5% with epinephrine 0.5% plus guanethidine 3% had a stronger effect on intraocular pressure (reduction 10.9 +/- 1.1 mm Hg) than epinephrine 0.5% plus guanethidine 3% (7.6 +/- 0.9 mm Hg) or timolol alone (5.8 +/- 1.1 mm Hg) or other glaucoma drugs. However, when the three substances are administered in combination therapy may show an addition of both pressure-lowering and side effects.", 
    "85": "Hypertensive diabetic patients are particularly prone to renal function impairment. A total of nine out-patients with diabetes and hypertension were, therefore, entered into this single-blind uncontrolled study on the effects of 50 mg/day atenolol on reducing blood pressure and preserving normal kidney functioning. Treatment and evaluations were continued for 12 months. Serum beta 2-microglobulin concentration was used as the index for measuring renal impairment. Atenolol significantly reduced heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and serum beta 2-microglobulin concentrations compared with baseline. Plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin levels were unchanged, and blood urea nitrogen levels were increased slightly (non-significant). Serum creatinine showed a tendency (non-significant) to reflect the changes in beta 2-microglobulin concentration. Ways in which atenolol may act to improve kidney functioning are suggested. It is concluded that atenolol is a favourable choice for the treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients with normally functioning kidneys since, even in long-term use, normal renal functioning is preserved.", 
    "86": "1. The effects of peptidase enzymes on non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) inhibitory responses of guinea-pig trachea to electrical field stimulation (EFS), and on relaxations induced by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI) have been examined. 2. alpha-Chymotrypsin reduced both the magnitude and, particularly, the duration of the inhibitory response to EFS, whereas papain reduced only the magnitude. Aprotinin, a peptidase inhibitor prevented the effects of alpha-chymotrypsin but was without effect on papain. 3. alpha-Chymotrypsin and papain both abolished relaxant responses to exogenous VIP and PHI. The action of alpha-chymotrypsin was prevented by aprotinin, whereas that of papain was not affected. 4. The peptidases were without effect on concentration-response curves to methacholine or to isoprenaline. It was also observed that, in the absence of the peptidases, aprotinin had no effect on inhibitory responses either to EFS or to exogenous VIP and PHI. 5. It is suggested that neuropeptides, possibly VIP and PHI, released during EFS of guinea-pig trachea, partly mediate NANC relaxations, and that their action may be inhibited by peptidases. However, the lack of effect of aprotinin alone, on responses to EFS, suggests that, if endogenous peptidases are important in terminating the action of neuropeptides, they are resistant to the effect of this particular peptidase inhibitor. It is further suggested that neurogenic relaxation of guinea-pig trachea is also partly mediated by a substance, possibly non-peptide, other than VIP or PHI.", 
    "87": "With a view to examine the effect of chirality and the cause of batch-to-batch variation in the mutagenicity of penbutolol, penbutolol enantiomers - isopenbutolol [R(+)-enantiomer] and penbutolol [S(-)-enantiomer] - and two batches of Betapressin were tested employing the Ames Salmonella tester strain TA98. The mutagenic activity of R(+)-enantiomer was found to be similar to that of a batch of penbutolol with a high content of this optical isomer. The pharmaceutical form of penbutolol, Betapressin, exhibited either less or equal mutagenic effectiveness to the S(-)-enantiomer. In the presence of the S9 mix, the mutagenicity of R(+)-enantiomer was only slightly affected in the low dose range of 40 to 160 micrograms/plate. A metabolite of penbutolol, (RS) l\"-dehydropenbutolol, did not cause an increase in the number of revertants/plate."
