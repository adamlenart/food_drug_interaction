In hypertensive patients, despite these marked differences in plasma cyclic AMP levels, similar blood pressure control was achieved with these three beta blockers.", 
    "1": "This paper describes the influence of persistent infections of C-6 rat glioma cells by paramyxoviruses [virus of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and canine distemper (CDV)] on the cellular beta-adrenergic membrane receptors. The number and binding properties of the beta-adrenergic receptors of the paramyxovirus-infected cells were measured by 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding studies and compared with those of the uninfected C-6 cells. In the case of SSPE virus neither changes in number nor binding properties of beta-adrenergic receptors could be observed, whereas in the case of CDV persistence the number of beta-adrenergic receptors was reduced to about 50%, without an apparent influence on the binding constant for the ligand to the receptors.", 
    "2": "Lithium (Li) has been reported to inhibit numerous adenylate cyclases, but often these reports used clinically toxic concentrations of Li and their relevance to a theory of Li action was questionable. The present report demonstrated Li inhibition beginning at 2 mM of the norepinephrine (NE)-induced cyclic AMP accumulation in a resuspended P2 pellet containing intact synaptosomes and in slices from rat cortex. The inhibition is demonstrable with isoproterenol as well and in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. In cortical slices removed from rats treated for 21 days with therapeutically equivalent Li serum levels, NE-induced cyclic AMP accumulation is inhibited by over 70%. After cessation of 21 or 42 days of Li treatment, an enhancement of cyclic AMP accumulation to NE is not demonstrable. Rubidium and cesium do not inhibit NE-induced cyclic AMP accumulation. These ions cause an increase in basal cyclic AMP accumulation in the absence of NE, as does Li to a lesser degree. The effect of Li to inhibit NE-induced cyclic AMP accumulation is therefore specific to the Li ion, occurs at therapeutically equivalent concentrations, continues after chronic treatment and does not cause a compensatory supersensivity in the manner of the NE-receptor blocking drugs.", 
    "3": "Three different preparations of relaxin elevated cAMP levels in isometrically suspended uterine strips obtained from estrogen-primed female rats in the presence of phosphodiesterase inhibitors. The effect was time and dose dependent, with maximal response at 20 min and 1 microgram/ml, respectively. No changes in cGMP levels were observed. No significant response was observed in ileum, vas deferens, epididymis, or testicular capsule. In the absence of phosphodiesterase inhibitors, relaxin markedly suppressed spontaneous contractile activity at doses of 0.36 and 0.96 microgram/ml but did not elevate cAMP in this dose range. While the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol suppressed both the relaxant action and cAMP stimulation promoted by isoproterenol, it did not interfere with the effect of relaxin on these same parameters. Relaxin is therefore capable of relaxing uterine muscle and elevating cAMP by mechanisms which probably do not require beta-adrenergic mediation. It is not clear at present whether the effects of relaxin on cAMP levels and contractile activity are causally related.", 
    "4": "The cardiovascular effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were studied in mechanically ventilated, vagotomized, Beta-blocked, anesthetized dogs. To compensate for the effect of PEEP on decreasing systemic venous return, acute plasma volume expansion was accomplished returning stroke volume and cardiac output to control values. Left and right ventricular filling pressures (LVFP and RVFP) and aortic pressure were measured relative to pressure (transmural pressure). Ventricular performance was assessed by comparing the transmural ventricular filling pressures at similar stroke volumes. Studies were performed on individual dogs with increasing LVFP produced by Beta-blockade, volume expansion, and obstruction of the descending thoracic aorta. Utilizing these methods we observed that for a given cardiac output, transmural LVFP was higher on PEEP compared to a control state with both normal and elevated control LVFP. On the right side, for a given cardiac output, RVFP was elevated only when the control LVFP was elevated. Our results suggest a nonneuronal adverse effect of PEEP on both left and right ventricular performance. This effect is probably due to mechanical heart-lung interaction since left ventricular (LV) dp/dt showed no change.", 
    "5": "Adrenaline inhibits the acetylcholine-evoked histamine release from isolated purified rat mast cells, in a dose-dependent fashion. The inhibitory effect of adrenaline is reversed by preincubating the cells with a beta-blocker, aprenolol, but not by preincubating them with an alpha-blocker, phentolamine. These results were confirmed by observations using an electron microscope and they suggest that adrenaline inhibits the cholinergic histamine release from rat mast cells acting upoon beta-receptors.", 
    "6": "The beta-adrenergic antagonist, alprenolol, was attached in an irreversible manner to macromolecular dextran via side arms that differed in length. The ability of these macromolecules to bind to the beta-adrenergic receptor of frog erythrocytes and to catecholamine-binding antibodies raised against partially purified receptors was studied. Compared to the parent drug the potency of binding of macromolecular alprenolol to the receptor decreased about 1/10, 1/600, and 1/8000 when the length of the arm separating alprenolol from the dextran moiety was 13, 8, and 4 atoms, respectively. In contrast, the binding potencies of the parent drug and of all its macromolecular derivatives for the antibody were within the same order of magnitude. Thus, conversion of a drug to a macromolecular form may not only sustain its binding activity but may also lead in a higher selectivity. The macromolecular derivatives described here may be suitable probes for investigation of the location and of the molecular properties of the binding sites for beta-adrenergic drugs.", 
    "7": "The relationship between the membrane stabilizing action of beta-adrenoceptor blockers and their physico-chemical properties was investigated. Their depressing effects on the action potential amplitude of isolated Rana sciatic nerve were examined. The orde of their depressing potencies was propranolol (PROP) greater than dichloroisoproterenol (DCI) greater than alprenolol (ALP) greater than methoxamine (MEX) greater than practolol (PRAC) = sotalol (SOTA). The order of the negative chronotropic potency on the isolated rabbit atrial rate was PROP greater than ALP greater than DCI greater than MEX greater than PRAC greater than SOTA. The order of beta-blocking activity in isolated guinea-pig tracheal chain or in isolated rabbit atrial rate was ALP greater than PROP greater than SOTA greater than DCI greater than MEX greater than PRAC or PROP greater than ALP greater than PRAC greater than DCI greater than SOTA greater than MEX respectively. A high correlation was observed between membrane stabilizing actions (depressing effect on sciatic nerve action potential and negative chronotropic effect on atrial rate) and physico-chemical properties (the apparent partition coefficient and pKb). No relation was observed between beta-blocking effect on tracheal chain or right atrial rate and physico-chemical properties. It is suggested that the active sites for beta-blocking action and membrane stabilizing action might be different.", 
    "8": "The subcutaneous administration of chlorpromazine (CPZ) caused a dose response increase in plasma glucose and cyclic AMP levels in fed male mice. Hexamethonium abolished the elevation of both plasma glucose and cyclic AMP. Propranolol did not inhibit the elevation of plasma glucose but inhibited the increase of plasma cyclic AMP. In contrast, phentolamine and yohimbine completely suppressed the elevation of plasma glucose but not that of plasma cyclic AMP. These results indicate that the hyperglycemia due to CPZ was mediated through the stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptor and on the contrary CPZ increased plasma cyclic AMP through the stimulation of beta-adrenoceptor and that the increase in plasma glucose induced by CPZ was independent of the activation of adenylate cyclase and the increased plasma cyclic AMP. In addition, in contrast to phentolamine and yohimbine, phenoxybenzamine was ineffective to prevent the hyperglycemia induced by CPZ. Moreover, a higher dose of dihydroergotamine was required to inhibit the hyperglycemia.", 
    "9": "This study was designed to evaluate the effects of alterations of beta-receptor activity on intercoronary collateral blood flow after acute coronary artery occlusion in the awake dog. Blood flow following acute circumflex coronary occlusion was measured during: 1) control conditions; 2) selective beta1-blockade with practolol; 3) combined beta1 and beta2 blockade with propranolol; and 4) selective beta2 stimulation. Neither practolol nor propranolol significantly altered the volume or distribution of blood flow into the normally perfused or ischaemicmyocardial areas, while beta2 stimulation increased blood flow to the normally perfused myocardium from 1.13 +/- 0.12 to 1.28 +/- 1.10 cm3 .min-1 .g-1 (P <0.05). This increase in flow, which was directed preferentially to the subepicardium, was mediated by a significant decrease in coronary vascular resistance. In contrast to the effect on normally perfused myocardiu, beta2 stimulation resulted in a 47 +/- 12% decrease in collateral flow into the central ischaemic zone (P <0.05), which was mediated by a combination of decreased arterial pressure and increased collateral vascular resistance during beta2-agonist administration. Thus, although beta2 stimulation produced a modest increase in blood flow to normally perfused myocardium, in the setting of acute myocardial ischaemia, beta2 stimulation resulted in a significant decrease in intercoronary collateral flow.", 
    "10": "Hemispheric and regional cerebral blood flow were measured in 448 patients before and after application of various drugs. Of the tested substances, only a few affected hCBF: ephedrine-xanthines decreased hCBF, and midodrine, proxazole, vincamine, hexobendine, extract of ginkgo biloba, dextran, dextran-sorbitol, carboanhydrase inhibitor, and ouabain incresaed hCBF. In the rCBF maps different reaction patterns of regional flow were observed which were statistically tested by regression analysis. Homogeneous responses were seen as diffuse increases or decreases of rCBF. Heterogeneous responses occurred when perfusion of pathologic and normal areas reacted differently. An increase in rCBF in well-perfused areas with a shunt of blood from poorly supplied areas (intracerebral steal) was observed only with central vasodilators during the first days after an attack. Inverse cerebral steal phenomena with improvement of perfusion in the focus and decrease of flow in the surrounding brain may be elicited by different mechanisms. The effectiveness of drugs on cerebral circulation can be tested by measuring rCBF, but their therapeutic value for the treatment of patients with cerebrovascular disease must be shown in controlled clinical trials.", 
    "11": "The authors summarize findings in a clinical trial of the betablockers Timolol and Metoprolol, as well as the effectiveness of various concentration of the combination preparation Guanethidine-Adrenaline. In the trial Timolol proved to be the almost ideal drug for glaucoma therapy. However, as a pressure-lowering agent the guanethidine-epinephrine combination is more effective. Metroprolol, which is a pure beta 1-blocker, is probably preferable to Timolol in asthmatic patients.", 
    "12": "Effects of a new beta 2-adrenoceptive agonist, BD 40A on gastric acid secretion and gastrointestinal motility were studied in comparison with those of isoproterenol, hexoprenaline and cimetidine. BD 40A (0.3 and 1 microgram/kg i.v.) inhibited dose-dependently gastric acid secretion produced by continuous i.v. infusion of tetragastrin (8 microgram/kg-hr), whereas acid secretion in response to histamine infusion (160 microgram/kg-hr) was resistant to the inhibitory action of BD 40A in pentobarbital anesthetized dogs with gastric pouches. Cimetidine (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) blocked acid secretion induced by either tetragastrin or histamine. When intraduodenally administered to pylorus-ligated rats in a dose of 1 mg/kg, BD 40A and hexoprenaline produced a reduction in acid output. Both drugs (1 microgram/kg i.v.) decreased the amplitude of gastric, duodenal and ileal motility measured by the balloon method in anesthetized dogs. The inhibitory effects of BD 40A on acid secretion induced by tetragastrin and on spontaneous motility of the gastrointestinal tract were antagonized by 1 mg/kg of propranolol. These pharmacological properties of BD 40A were qualitatively similar to those of isoproterenol and may be ascribable to the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the gastrointestinal tissue.", 
    "13": "The cardiac stimulant actions of nine beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents were examined in kitten papillary muscles and in isolated atria of kittens and guinea pigs to determine to what extent these drugs behaved as classical partial agonists. In many ways the agents do appear to comprise a spectrum of partial agonists with widely differing efficacies. However, in one respect the actions of some of the beta-blockers did not fit into the classical mold. Several beta-blockers were found to exert stimulant effects only in concentrations appreciably higher than those required for substantial beta-adrenoceptor blockade. These observations suggest that more than one type of beta-adrenoceptor may be involved in the production of sympathomimetic effects on cardiac muscle.", 
    "14": "The pattern of antagonism between isoproterenol and various beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents was explored in spontaneously beating right atria and in driven left atrial strips from kittens and guinea pigs. The onset of beta-adrenoceptor blockade is usually very slow in such preparations; incubation periods of up to an hour may be required for equilibrium conditions. The speed of onset of the blocking action is directly related to the concentration of the antagonist, and therefore, for a given degree of blockade, inversely related to its potency. beta-Adrenoceptor blocking agents were found to interact with isoproterenol in a manner consistent with a simple competitive antagonism provided that (1) the antagonist had little intrinsic stimulant action on the preparation under study, (2) the concentrations of antagonist used had no direct depressant action on the preparation, (3) precautions were taken to assure that the pattern of antagonism was not distorted by loss of agonist into tissue sinks, and (4) dose-response curves were normalized for changes in the baseline frequency or force in successive curves. Corrections for desensitization were necessary only in inotropic dose-response curves. Estimates of the equilibrium dissociation constants (KB) derived from the antagonism of the chronotropic and inotropic effects of isoproterenol were determined for fifteen beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents of widely differing potency. In no case was there a substantial difference between the inotropic and chronotropic values. Published estimates of binding constants for beta-blockers determined on cardiac membrane particles are more variable than those determined on intact tissues, and tend to be slightly (adenylyl cyclase measurements) or considerably (radioligand binding studies) lower than the values obtained in intact tissues. These differences raise the possibility that the properties of the beta-adrenoceptor may sometimes be altered during the isolation and partial purification of membrane fragments.", 
    "15": "The chronotropic and inotropic effects of fourteen beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents were studied in vitro on preparations of isolated heart muscle from kittens and guinea pigs. Most of the agents exert negative inotropic and chronotropic effects that increase rapidly with concentration above 10(-6) M. Exceptions are the closely related compounds practolol and atenolol, which have minimal depressant effects in concentrations as high as 2 X 10(-3) M. Dose-response relations for the depressant effects are similar for pacemaker frequency and for tension development in atrial and papillary muscle. The cardiodepressant effects of beta-blockers are non-stereospecific and are apparently unrelated to the actions of the drugs at beta-adrenoceptors. Many beta-blockers exert positive inotropic and chronotropic effects at concentrations lower than those that depress. The stimulant effects are slow in onset and do not fade. In most instances these effects are blocked by propranolol and may therefore be considered to be mediated throught beta-adrenoceptors; (-)-enantiomers are more potent than (+)-enantiomers as adrenoceptor stimulants. Adrenoceptor-mediated inotropic effects are usually more pronounced in atrial than in ventricular muscle. Certain beta-blockers, notably INPEA and sotalol, exert positive inotropic effects that are not blocked by propranolol or phenyoxybenzamine. The effects are very slow in onset and offset, and are accompanied by the development of contractions with a late tonic component which coincides with a greatly prolonged action potential. Unlike the adrenoceptor-mediated effect, the non-sympathomimetic inotropic effect is more pronounced in ventricular than in atrial muscle, and is not stereospecific. Pindolol also causes the development of a late tonic component, but the accompanying positive inotropic effect is overcome by the simultaneous development of the depressant action of the drug.", 
    "16": "Five clinically healthy, male volunteers were each given an intravenous dose of 1.19 mg of 2-methyl-14C-mepindolol sulphate, followed one week later by an oral dose of 20 mg. In addition, the effect of mepindolol sulphate was studied in 3 male test subjects after repeated oral administration for 8 days with a daily dose of 2 x 2.5 mg using the heart rate behaviour model during submaximum ergometer exercise. Synchronously with pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetic data were also obtained after multiple dosing.", 
    "17": "Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) can be induced by some drugs used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The reported frequency with which these antibodies are detected in patients varies widely. This variation results from a number of factors. The sensitivity of the ANA assay is influenced by the selection of substrates, the concentration of antisera and characteristics of the detection systems such as ultraviolet microscopes or electrophoretic apparatus. The incidence of ANA also varies with age and sex of the patient, being more common in older people and in females. Identification of a drug suspected of producing ANA demands a careful evaluation of the data with precisely standardised laboratory procedures and comparison of data with appropriate control groups of untreated and treated patients. Cardiovascular drugs associated with increased ANA incidence can be considered in two categories: A) A few drugs induce ANA in most patients if therapy is continued for long enough at high enough dosage. Many of these patients develop systemic lupus erythematosus like-syndromes. This group includes procainamide, hydrallazine at high doses and practolol. B) A further group of drugs produces ANA in 20 to 30% of patients, few if any, of whom develop SLE. Methyldopa and acebutolol are clearly in this category, while there is some evidence that labetolol, guanethidine and hydrallazine at low doses may also be implicated. Some very preliminary evidence suggests those patients on the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs atenolol, metoprolol and exprenolol exhibit a mildly increased incidence of ANA, but there is no evidence to suggest associated SLE. Only patients who develop ANA while on treatment with category A drugs require careful monitoring for SLE.", 
    "18": "1 We have studied the binding properties of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist [3H]-dihydroalprenolol ([3H]-DHA) on a membrane preparation of the non-fusing muscle cells BC3H1. 2 [3H]-DHA appears to bind to two classes of sites. The first site has a high affinity (KD = 0.53 nM) and a low capcity (Bmax = 58 fmol/mg of protein). The second site has a low affinity (KD = 110 nM) and a high capacity (Bmax = 1100 fmol/mg of protein). 3 The pharmacological properties of the high affinity low capacity site correspond to the known properties of the beta 2-adrenoceptors since the agonists inhibit [3H]-DHA binding following the series isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than phenylephrine and the antagonists following the series alprenolol congruent to propranolol greater than butoxamine greater than practolol greater than phentolamine. 4 The binding properties of the beta-adrenoceptors were correlated with the effect of beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on 86Rb efflux rate from BC3H1 Cells. 5 There is very good correlation between the dissociation constants obtained by inhibition of [3H]-DHA binding by the antagonists alprenolol and propranolol, and the inhibition constants calculated from their antagonism of the 86Rb efflux rate stimulation by adrenaline. The ratio of the dissociation constants obtained by inhibition of [3H]-DHA binding by agonists and their EC50, calculated from 86Rb efflux curves, is higher than 1. This high KD/EC50 ratio indicates a high coupling efficiency between receptor occupancy by agonists and the biological effect measured.", 
    "19": "1 PA2 values for beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were obtained on isolated preparations of guinea-pig trachea (intrinsic tone) and atria (rate), with isoprenaline, noradrenaline (beta 1-selective) and fenoterol (beta 2-selective) as agonists. Uptake mechanisms and alpha-adrenoceptors were inhibited. The antagonists studied were (+/-)-threo-alpha-methylpropranolol. (+/-)-1(4-benzimidazoloxy)-3-isopropylamino-2-propanol (4-BIP) and (+/-)-1-(5-benzimidazoloxy)-3-isopropylamino-2-propanol (5-BIP). 2 4-BIP was a potent beta-adrenoceptor antagonist but it was not selective for trachea (pA2 on trachea 7.88 and on atria 7.73, fenoterol as agonist). 5-BIP was less than one tenth as active as 4-BIP and was therefore not studied in detail. 3 alpha-Methylpropranolol was potent and it was also selective for trachea (pA2 on trachea 8.24 and on atria 7.56, fenoterol as agonist). This selectivity was not seen with isoprenaline as agonist. In tracheal preparations contracted by carbachol the slope of the Schild plot for alpha-methylpropranolol was less than 1.0 (isoprenaline as agonist). 4 alpha-Methylpropranolol, although not highly selective for beta 2-adrenoceptors, is considerably more potent than the alternative beta 2-selective antagonists available at present. Therefore, it may be useful in studies designed to classify beta-adrenoceptor subtypes in tissues.", 
    "20": "1 The beta-adrenoceptor stimulant effects of RO363 and (--)-isoprenaline have been compared in a variety of isolated tissue preparations. 2 RO363 is approximately half as potent as (--)-isoprenaline in tissues where actions are due to beta1-receptor activation (guinea-pig atrial and ileal preparations and ventricular strips from the rabbit, rat and guinea-pig. 3 In uterine and lung strip preparations from the guinea-pig, where responses are due to beta2-receptor stimulation. RO363 is 100 to 350 times less active than (--)-isoprenaline and has a low intrinsic activity. 4 In spontaneously contracted tracheal preparations from the guinea-pig, RO363 is a full agonist and is approximately half as potent as (--)-isoprenaline. These effects of RO363 are due to the activation of a population of beta1-receptors in the tissue since RO363 and (--)-isoprenaline have the same relative potencies in trachea, cardiac and ileal preparations. In addition the Kb values for practolol are similar in all these preparations when RO363 is used as the agonist. 5 The results show that RO363 is a potent and highly selective beta1-receptor agonist.", 
    "21": "1 The beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs atenolol, metoprolol, practolol, propranolol, timolol and oxrenolol (as racemates) were administered acutely at three dose levels (0.01, 0.03 and 0.1 mmol/kg i.p. or s.c.) to spontaneously hypertensive rats with intact adrenal glands (SH-rats) and following unilateral adrenalectomy and contralateral adrenal-demedullation (SHAD-rats). Changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate were determined via an indwelling aortic catheter, with the animals placed in a quiet environment. 2 All drugs significantly lowered the blood pressure of SHAD-rats, and these responses were not always associated with changes in basal heart rate. 3 With the exception of metoprolol and atenolol, the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs were less effective as anti-hypertensives in SH- than in SHAD-rats. Notably, timolol and oxprenolol lowered the blood pressure of SH-rats at low doses only, whereas propranolol evoked a pressor response in this model. 4 Whilst (+)-propranolol lowered the blood pressure of SHAD-rats only at a dose which caused myocardial depression, the anti-hypertensive response to (--)-propranolol did not parallel changes in heart rate and was preceded by a pressor response. 5 The results imply that adrenal catecholamine release contributes towards masking the anti-hypertensive effects of some beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in SH-rats.", 
    "22": "Timolol is a new beta blocker with cardioselective properties. A single blind controlled study was performed to assess the efficacy of timolol maleate in doses of 10 to 30 mg per day in 20 patients affected by stable angina pectoris. The patients received a placebo for a baseline period of 2 weeks, followed by 12 weeks of timolol. The number of anginal attacks dropped from 14.9 attacks per week in the baseline period to a minimum of 4.6 attacks per week in the sixth week of treatment (P less than 0.01). The number of tablets of nitroglycerin taken per week was reduced from 6.5 during the baseline period to 2.3 in the sixth week of treatment. Resting heart rate decreased from a baseline mean value of 72 beats per minute to 51.7 and 53.7 per minute at weeks 6 and 12 respectively (P less than 0.01). Blood pressure both at rest and during exercise was significantly reduced. The mean work index measured during bicycle ergometry was 127 units before treatment; it increased by 29.4 units and 36.1 units during week 6 and week 12 respectively (P less than 0.05). There was a marked symptomatic improvement in 50% of the patients. Mild fatigue was a common side effect but it disappeared following reduction of dose. We concluded that timolol maleate significantly reduces the number of anginal attacks and increases the work capacity of patients affected by stable angina pectoris",

    "26": "This study is a descriptive report of the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in a large, prospectively designed follow-up study of postcoronary patients. Six-hour Holter recordings were obtained on 954 postinfarction patients prior to hospital discharge and at 4 (n = 837), 8 (n = 762), 12 (n = 713), and 24 (n = 487) months post-discharge. Ventricular ectopic beats (VEB) were quantitated by frequency and patterns at each recording, and antiarrhythmic medication usage was recorded. The proportion of patients wtih each VEB frequency (any, less than 9.9/hour, 10 - 19.9/hour, greater than or equal to 20/hour) increased progressively during the 24-month follow-up, with the most significant increase in the interval between baseline and the four-month follow-up recording. Significant (p less than 0.01) associations were found between VEB frequency greater than or equal to 20/hour and almost all VEB patterns for each follow-up; no significant associations were found between VEB prematurity (RR'/QT less than or equal to 1.00) and any of the VEB patterns. Among the survivors, the utilization of diuretics and beta blockers increased (p less than 0.01) and antiarrhythmic agents declined (p less than 0.01) between predischarge and all subsequent follow-up visits. The significance of these findings is discussed.", 
    "27": "The effect of the beta-blocking drug acebutolol on the severity of cardiac arrhythmias and the incidence of exercise-induced arrhythmias was studied in 15 patients with chronic coronary artery disease using ambulatory Holter monitoring and bicycle ergometry. We found a significantly lower grading of arrhythmias both on long-term ECGs and during and after exercise. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of VPBs during and after exercise (18.15 +/- 7.7 on placebo vs. 3.46 +/- 1.7 on acebutolol). It is concluded that acebutolol favorably influences the incidence and severity of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with chronic coronary artery disease.", 
    "28": "beta-Adrenergic receptors in mononuclear leukocyte preparations were assessed with (-)[(3)H]-dihydroalprenolol binding studies during the infusion of adrenergic agonists into normal human subjects. During the infusion of isoproterenol into seven subjects, mean (+/-SE) (-)[(3)H]dihydroalprenolol binding increased from 25+/-3 fmol/mg protein to 47+/-8 fmol/mg protein (P < 0.02) at 0.5 h and 40+/-3 fmol/mg protein (P < 0.01) at 1 h and decreased to 12+/-1 fmol/mg protein (P < 0.01) at 4-6 h. During the infusion of epinephrine into three subjects, mean (-)[(3)H]dihydroalprenolol binding increased from 32+/-3 to 63+/-3 fmol/mg protein (P < 0.01) at 0.5-1 h. By Scatchard plot analysis, these changes were attributable to changes in the number of available binding sites rather than changes in binding affinity. The observed changes in the number of (-)[(3)H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites were not paralleled by changes in total mononuclear cell counts or in T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte, and monocyte distributions. Thus, we conclude that adrenergic agonists modulate the number of available beta-adrenergic receptors on circulating mononuclear cells in a biphasic manner, with an early increment and a late decrement, in man. Further, the finding that the increase in pulse rate in response to a \"pulse\" infusion of isoproterenol was significantly greater after 0.5-1 h of agonist infusion suggests that the observed early agonist-induced increment in beta-adrenergic receptor number on circulating cells is paralleled by increments in extra-vascular beta-adrenergic receptor sensitivity.", 
    "29": "In a double blind designed treatment trial with three randomized groups of patients the effect of a fixed betablocker diuretic combination (Torrat, Boehringer Mannheim GmbH) was compared with the effect of the single components. 66 patients with essential and renal hypertension stage I and II according to the WHO definition were evaluated. 27 patients were treated with 1 tablet, 32 with 2 X 1 tablet, and 7 patients with 3 X 1 tablet daily. Besides of the blood pressure lowering effect over an observation period of 10 weeks the influence on pulse rate, potassium, blood sugar and uric acid were investigated. It could be shown that the blood pressure lowering effect was highest under the combination-drug. The treatment with the single components showed a less pronounced influence on the blood pressure, thus hinting at an additive effect of the 2 components metipranolol and butizide when given together. The combination exerts few side effects and does not influence the investigated parameters of metabolism over a longer period of time.", 
    "30": "Labetalol, a blocker of alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors, was tried on 45 patients with severe (29 cases) or mild to moderate (16 cases) hypertension. After an initial period of dosage adjustment and a 2 months treatment in effective doses, there was a significant fall in supine blood pressure from mean values of 207/132 to 170/106 mmHg. In 23 patients hypertension was controlled by labetalol alone in doses of 400 and 1800 mg per day. True failures were rare (16%). Digestive disorders and postural hypotension were the most frequently encountered side-effects; they obliged to discontinue treatment in 4 cases, but were compatible with it in 11 cases. In 22 patients the fall in BP was accompanied by a significant (p less than 0,001) decrease in plasma renin activity from 123 to 44 ng/l/min supine and from 144 to 83 ng/l/min standing. Studies of the renal function showed no changes during oral therapy. Following intravenous injection of 50 mg labetalol to 20 subjects, inulin and PAH clearances remained unaltered, and there was a significant, though transient (1 hour), decrease in chloride, sodium and phosphorus excretion. Effective in lowering blood pressure be used and well tolerated by the kidneys, labetalol can safely be used for the treatment of severe hypertension with organic renal involvement.", 
    "31": "The value of beta-blockade for suspected acute myocardial infarction was assessed by determining the six-week and one-year mortality rates in patients started on propranolol, atenolol, or placebo immediately on entry to a coronary care unit. A total of 388 patients entered this double-blind, randomised study, and when analysed on the basis of the initial, intention-to-treat categories there was no significant difference between the three groups in respect of the mortality rate at one year. There was, however, a high withdrawal rate from the trial; the reasons for this illustrate problems of physician compliance and interpretation of data, which are common to all early-entry trials of haemodynamically active agents in acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "32": "Studies of rat skeletal glycogen metabolism carried out in a perfused hindlimb system indicated that epinephrine activates phosphorylase via the cascade of phosphorylation reactions classically linked to the beta-adrenergic receptor/adenylate cyclase system. The beta blocker propranolol completely blocked the effects of epinephrine on cAMP, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylase, and glucose-6-P, whereas the alpha blocker phentolamine was totally ineffective. Omission of glucose from the perfusion medium did not modify the effects of epinephrine. Glycogen synthase activity in control perfused and nonperfused muscle was largely glucose-6-P-dependent (-glucose-6-P/+glucose-6-P activity ratios of 0.1 and 0.2, respectively). Epinephrine perfusion caused a small decrease in the enzyme's activity ratio (0.1 to 0.05) and a large increase in its Ka for glucose-6-P (0.3 to 1.5 mM). This increase in glucose-6-P dependency correlated in time with protein kinase activation and was totally blocked by propranolol and unaffected by phentolamine. Comparison of the kinetics of glycogen synthase in extracts of control and epinephrine-perfused muscle with the kinetics of purified rat skeletal muscle glycogen synthase a phosphorylated to various degrees by cAMP-dependent protein kinase indicated that the enzyme was already substantially phosphorylated in control muscle and that epinephrine treatment caused further phosphorylation of synthase, presumably via cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These data provide a basis for speculation about in vivo regulation of the enzyme.", 
    "33": "The injection of haloperidol, a dopamine receptor blocker, was followed by a large increase of plasma ACTH and beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta-EI) in the rat. This effect was prevented when the rats were previously treated with corticosteroids. These results suggest that catecholamines inhibit ACTH and beta-endorphin secretion in the rat.", 
    "34": "Autoantibodies to beta 2-adrenergic receptors have been identified in the serum of one patient with allergic rhinitis (\"hay fever\") and two patients with asthma. The antibodies precipitate solubilized dog lung beta receptors in an indirect immunoprecipitation assay and inhibit the specific binding of iodine-125-labeled iodohydroxybenzylpindolol to membrane-associated receptors from dog lung, calf lung, and human placenta. Ligand binding to canine heart beta 1 receptors is not affected by the antibodies.", 
    "35": "Adrenergic stimulation of the cyclic AMP system of the prostate gland of the rat has been investigated. The observed order of potency for adrenergic agonists in stimulating prostatic adenylate cyclase activity was isoproterenol greater than epinephrine approximately or equal to salbutamol greater than norepinephrine, indicating properties characteristic of beta-2-adrenergic receptor-sensitive adenylate cyclase systems. Dopamine stimulation of the enzyme was exclusively inhibited by a dopamine antagonist, haloperidol, suggesting the presence of dopamine-sensitive receptor in the prostate gland. An initial incubation of the gland with isoproterenol or dopamine resulted in a decrease in maximal enzyme activation by catecholamine, either isoproterenol or dopamine, with no change in hormone affinity. The findings that refractoriness of beta-adrenergic and dopaminergic receptor-adenylate cyclase systems was induced by both receptor-agonists suggest an interaction of an agonist-induced desensitization with another receptor or receptor-enzyme complex in the prostate gland.", 
    "36": "The effect of repetitive stimulation of the locus coeruleus (LC) on the discharge rate of spontaneously active neurons of the visual, rostral and cingulate cortex was investigated in untreated and catecholamine-depleted rats under chloral hydrate anesthesia. In untreated animals, the inhibitory transsynaptic effects predominated over the excitatory ones. In catecholamine-depleted rats, the percentage of inhibited cells was significantly reducted in all areas. The vast majority of spontaneously active neurons in all cortical regions was depressed by microiontophoretically applied noradrenaline (NA). A few cells were resistant to NA; no excitatory effects were noticed on any cell. The transsynaptically mediated depression of the discharge rate of cells in all three cortical areas was reversibly antagonized by the iontophoretically administered beta-receptor blocking drug practolol. On the contrary the a-receptor blocking drugs piperoxane and WB4101 were ineffective in this respect. Thus, we tentatively conclude from these data that the NA-elicited depression of cells in the cortex is mediated by a receptor of the beta-type. Repetitive stimulation of the reticular formation elicited a desynchronizing effect on the EEG of chloral hydrate anaesthetized rats. LC stimulation, in contrast, hardly produced any modification of the EEG as judged by visual examination of the recordings.", 
    "37": "Stimultaion of cyclic AMP formation by epinephrine and norepinephrine has been studied in discrete areas of rat brain that include the epinephrine-containing brain stem nuclei C-1 and C-2. In the C-1 area, epinephrine-stimulated cyclic AMP formation was partially reversed by 100 microM phentolamine and by 10--100 microM propranolol or alprenolol and hence appeared to involve activation of a mixture of both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors as has been reported for other rat brain areas such as the cerebral cortex. However, in the C-2-area, the epinephrine and norepinephrine stimulated cyclic AMP formation involved the activation of a single receptor type which was alpha-like in character. Stimulation of cyclic AMP formation by epinephrine in the C-2 area was antagonized by nanomolar concentrations of both phentolamine and yohimbine. The epinephrine-stimulated formation of cyclic AMP in the C-2 but not in the C-1 area was augmented in a strains of rats which exhibit spontaneous genetic hypertension (SHR) vs. Wistar-Kyoto controls. It is suggested that the enhanced epinephrine-stimulated cyclic AMP formation in the C-2 area of SHR rats could be a physiological compensatory response to some other hypertension-causing lesion which, for example, results in chronically reduced epinephrine release or in ruduced availability of epinephrine at its postsynaptic receptor thereby leading to receptor supersensitivity. Supporting this possibility was the finding that treatment of SHRs and control animals and reserpine resulted in enhancement of epinephrine-stimulated cyclic AMP formation in the C-2 area of control rats, essentially obliterating the difference between control and SHR. The findings are also interepreted as supporting the involvement of epinephrine neurons in central vaso-depressor mechanisms.", 
    "38": "To determine the influence of the autonomic nervous system on the circulation of normal and growth-retarded fetal lambs we measured the responses of heart rate and arterial blood pressure to parasympathetic (atropine 0.2 mg/kg) and beta-adrenergic (propranolol 1.0 mg/kg) blockade in the last quarter of gestation. The heart rate response to parasympathetic blockade increased with gestational age in both normal and growth-retarded fetuses but in the growth-retarded fetuses there was a significantly greater response to parasympathetic blockade than in control fetuses from 121 days' gestation to term. The heart rate response to beta-adrenergic blockade did not change with gestational age in normal fetuses. From 131 days' gestation to term the heart rate response to beta-adrenergic blockade in growth-retarded fetuses was significantly higher than in normal fetuses. The systemic arterial blood pressure responses to parasympathetic or beta-adrenergic blockade were similar in growth-retarded and normal fetuses. These results indicate an increased parasympathetic and beta-adrenergic influence on the heart of fetuses whose growth has been retarded. It may also suggest a more generalized increase in parasympathetic and sympathetic tone affecting other organs and systems in the growth-retarded fetal lambs.", 
    "39": "Minoxidil is an extremely potent hypotensive drug. Good control of refractory hypertension can be achieved without major side effects by using small to moderate doses in combination with other drugs. In particular, minoxidil and labetalol are effective when they are used with frusemide.", 
    "40": "The effect of acebutolol (Sectral) was compared with that of placebo in 30 patients with mild to moderate hypertension who were receiving a thiazide diuretic. Ten patients did not complete the study. In the remaining 20 patients, acebutolol (mean dose, 910 +/- 408 mg/day) produced significantly greater reduction both in supine and in erect systolic and diastolic blood pressure over 16 weeks than placebo plus chlorothiazide P less than 0.005). Pulse rate also fell significantly. Four patients did not have a consistent reduction in blood pressure. Acebutolol was found to be an effective hypotensive agent with relatively few side effects.", 
    "41": "The efficacy of labetalol, an alpha and beta adrenoceptor blocking drug, has been compared with that of placebo, of propranolol alone, of hydrallazine alone, and of hydrallazine plus propranolol in combination in a randomized double-blind, fixed-dose crossover trial. Labetalol (300 mg twice a day) was equally effective with propranolol (80 mg twice a day), and more effective than hydrallazine (50 mg twice a day) alone. The effect of labetalol was comparable with that of hydrallazine plus propranolol when the patient was standing, but less potent with the patient in the supine position. Side effects were few.", 
    "42": "Various forms of cytochrome P-450 exist. A substrate may bind to these forms completely or partially. In addition, during the interaction of two substrates, several cytochrome P-450 forms may also be involved, either partially or completely. Now a method is described which allows the estimation of the spectral dissociation constants for the binding of two compounds to cytochrome P-450 subforms common to both. The method is illustrated by the competitive interaction of d,l-hexobarbital and d,l-propranolol with cytochrome P-450 which show only a partial overlap for type I binding sites using rat hepatic microsomes. Different subforms of cytochrome P-450 may be characterized by means of crossover studies with several type I compounds using this method.", 
    "43": "The association B blocking agent-lithium salt is used for the therapy of some severe hyperthyroidism with cardiotoxicosis. Separately, both drugs depress intracardiac conduction. However by recording the potentials of the His bundle in anesthetized dogs, a potential cardiotoxicity of this association is unlikely since sinusal automaticity alone is importantly slowed. But, these results need further confirmation in man.", 
    "44": "The disposition of [14C]pranolium chloride, a dimethyl quaternary derivative of propranolol, has been studied in rats, mice and hamsters after oral parenteral dosage. 2. Elimination of 14C occurred largely via the kidneys after parenteral dosage, but biliary excretion was significant. Pranolium chloride was excreted unchanged and as a conjugate, and was also metabolized to 1-naphthol which was conjugated. 3. The radiolabel was localized in the liver, kidneys, heart, lungs and gastro-intestinal tract of the rat, but did not pass the placental or blood-brain barriers to any appreciable extent. Unchanged pranolium chloride was localized in rat cardiac tissue for at least 6 h after i.v. dosage. 4. Pranolium chloride was poorly and variably absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract of animals. Peak plasma levels occurred between 10 min and 1 h. The absorption of the pranolium cation was marginally increased after prolonged fasting, but was not affected by the presence of alternative anions.", 
    "45": "A case of acute dissecting aneurysm of the aorta in a seriously hypertensive woman was treated for 9 days with continuously infused labetalol hydrochloride, initially at 1 mg/min and later at 125 mg/min. Continuous, invasive monitoring of arterial pressure showed values to be within present safety limits, even though the treatment was first supplemented with furosemide and then with clonidine. The use of labetalol in hypertension emergencies offers and alternative to the employment of dangerous drugs that have a transient effect, or are even unadvisable for treatments lasting longer than two days.", 
    "46": "Efferent nerve activity was recorded from nerve filaments dissected from the adrenal nerves in the rabbit before and after deafferentation of baroreceptors. Suppression of efferent activity of the adrenal nerve was observed following an injection of DL-epinephrine into the carotid artery. This suppression of adrenal nerve activity preceded the hypertension induced by epinephrine. An injection of lidocaine into the carotid artery caused a temporary suspension of the inhibitory effect of epinephrine. Adrenergic blocking agents also inhibited the suppressive effect of epinephrine. An injection of arterial blood collected during electrical stimulation of the splanchnic nerve reduced adrenal nerve activity. The present results suggest that catecholamines released from the adrenal medulla reflexly inhibit adrenal nerve activity through epinephrine-sensitive structure in the brain.", 
    "47": "To assess the acute and chronic effects of propranolol on left ventricular wall motion, simultaneous, echo-, apex-, and phonocardiograms were recorded in 10 normal subjects and in 16 patients with ischaemic heart disease, nine with co-ordinate (group A) and seven with incoordinate (group B) contraction in the control site. Records were made after 0.1 mg/kg intravenous or oral therapeutic dose for one week. In all, propranolol caused small reductions in heart rate and peak VCF. In normal subjects, intravenous and oral propranolol caused rate-related increases in the intervals Q to A2, Q to minimum dimension, and Q to mitral valve opening. The effects were different in patients with ischaemic heart disease. In group A, inward wall movement ceased 80 ms early, and this was not attributable to a change in heart rate. Diastolic events were unaltered. In group B, minimum dimension already occurred early. Propranolol did not alter systolic events further, but increased delay in mitral valve opening, 'O' point, prolonged isovolumic relaxation, reduced peak rate of dimension increase, and aggravated incoordinate relaxation. It is concluded that the effects of propranolol in patients with ischaemic heart disease are modified in a manner that cannot be predicted from observations made in normal subjects. It also appears that complex drug effects can be assessed in man from the measurement of time intervals derived from multiple non-invasive techniques.", 
    "48": "The value of exercise testing in detecting myocardial ischaemia resulting from coronary atheroma remains controversial. In order to increase the reliability of exercise testing, all its components (asymptomatic, haemodynamic, and electrocardiographic) have been scrutinised. In this study, concerned only with the electrocardiographic response to exercise, the incorporation of beta-blockade into the standard exercise procedure has improved specificity and predictive value without affecting sensitivity. Fifty patients with anginal pain and 50 asymptomatic subjects with an abnormal electrocardiogram were investigated by exercise testing before and after beta-blockade (oxprenolol). All subjects had coronary arteriograms and left ventriculograms, and the results of exercise testing were related to the presence or absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Possible causes of false positive exercise tests were eliminated by echocardiography. Though beta-blockade was unreliable in distinguishing ischaemic from non-ischaemic resting electrocardiograms, it eliminated all the false positive electrocardiographic responses to exercise in both groups and did not abolish any of the true positive electrocardiographic responses. Thus, specificity and predictive value were improved without reduction in sensitivity. This technique may not necessarily be applicable to other groups of patients or to a random population, but the results of this study suggest it will be a useful additional routine procedure in the investigation of coronary heart disease.", 
    "49": "A death attributed to quinidine-propranolol intoxication is described. Toxicological analysis of the tissues utilized thin layer (TLC) and gas-liquid (GLC) chromatography, ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Tissue levels for both drugs, along with their chemical ionization mass spectra, are presented.", 
    "50": "A woman patient suffering from long-term pulmonary asthma was treated with steroids and developed a secondary glaucoma. After the first application of one drop of Timololmaleat 0,25% in the lower conjunctival sac of each eye a significant increase in bronchospasm was registered. The cause and consequences of this side-effect are discussed. Timolol is contraindicated for patients with pulmonary disease as long as a negative effect on the pulmonary system is not ruled out by pulmonary tests.", 
    "51": "Fifty-eight glaucoma patients (105 eyes) of an ophthalmological practice were treated with Timolol eyedrops (0.1%-0.5% once or twice daily) over a long-term period. In group 1 - without pre-treatment (12 patients) pressure was lowered by 34%. In group II, glaucoma patients who were insufficiently stabilized by conservative treatment. Timolol was added to the glaucoma medication and thus a further pressure decrease of 27% was achieved. Group III comprised 24 glaucoma patients who, although their intraocular pressure was satisfactorily controlled, had problems with their medication. After having been switched to Timolol alone they presented a further decrease in IOP of 22%. Group IV comprised those patients resistant to Timolol therapy (six patients; 10%) who showed no further reduction in IOP--neither with Timolol alone nor in combination with other glaucoma medication. Advantages and slight disadvantages of Timolol therapy were discussed. Timolol is the only local glaucoma medication without ascertainable side-effects and thus represents a gain for the therapeutic spectrum of the practitioner.", 
    "52": "There were studied 31 patients 20 of them sanes and 11 with sustained systemic arterial hypertension to whom it was administered propranolol and sotalol in different periods. By means of phonomechanocardiographic study it was observed that the contractile heart function didn't present alterations in the sane patients, with the administration of the two drugs. Sotalol produced significative changes with depression of contractility in hypertense patients, even though there were no alterations of the \"pump\" function. It is probably on account that hypertensive cardiopathy per se has a minor functional myocardiac reserve and the negative inotropic effect is made evident with greater clearness. The fall of the elevation velocity of radial pulse (EVRP) in the two groups, suggests the increase of vascular resistances by the peripheric beta blockade.", 
    "53": "On the isolated tracheal smooth muscle, L-ascorbic acid alone induced a dose-related relaxation. When L-ascorbic acid was added in a standard concentration of 10(-5) g/ml to increasing concentrations of PGE2, an increase of relaxation was evident. The opposite effect was observed when PGF2 alpha was added in presence of L-ascorbic acid: a depression of tracheal smooth muscle contraction occurred. L-ascorbic acid increased the relaxing effect of isoprenaline on the tracheal smooth muscle. The relaxation effect of L-ascorbic acid was abolished by propranolol. These data support the hypothesis, that the effect of L-ascorbic acid may be related to stimulation of beta adrenergic receptors."
