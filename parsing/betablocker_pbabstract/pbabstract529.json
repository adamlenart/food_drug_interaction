    "0": "Beta blockers are often considered to be less effective for blood pressure control in elderly patients with essential hypertension than calcium antagonists. We therefore compared the efficacy and tolerability of the new beta blocker bisoprolol with those of nifedipine. Fifty-nine patients over 60 years of age with essential hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure, DBP: 95-115 mmHg) took part in a randomized double-blind study. After 14 days on placebo the patients received either 10 mg bisoprolol o.d. or 20 mg nifedipine SR b.i.d. for 4 weeks. The doses were doubled in patients whose DBP remained greater than 90 mmHg, for a further 4 week period. Blood pressure was measured about 24 hours after bisoprolol and about 12 hours after nifedipine administration. Fifty-six patients were available for efficacy analysis. After 4 weeks there was a distinct decrease of SBP and DBP in both groups (bisoprolol: -22 +/- 16; -15 +/- 9 mmHg; nifedipine: -24 +/- 17; -17 +/- 7 mmHg) with no significant difference between the treatments. DBP was normalized in 22/28 (79%) patients on bisoprolol and in 24/28 (86%) patients on nifedipine (bisoprolol vs nifedipine: NS). There were 7/29 bisoprolol and 14/30 nifedipine patients who experienced at least one side-effect. Overall the tolerability of bisoprolol was considered to be better than that of nifedipine (P = 0.043). In conclusion, bisoprolol 10-20 mg o.d. proved to be as equally effective as nifedipine SR 20-40 mg b.i.d. for the treatment of essential hypertension in the elderly.", 
    "1": "Three hundred and fifteen patients were randomly allocated to treatment for six months with bisoprolol 5 or 10 mg day-1 or atenolol, 50 mg day-1, in a double-blind, double-dummy parallel group, international multicentre study. Two hundred and ninety-two (175 men and 117 women) were eligible for statistical follow-up. Their mean age was 52.6 years (range 28-70). All patients had a supine diastolic blood pressure of 95-120 mmHg on two occasions during the four weeks of placebo treatment. Twenty-four patients ended the study prematurely and a further 19 had their regimes changed because of an insufficient effect. The reasons for drop-out were similar in the three treatment groups. Thus, 249 patients continued to receive the treatment they were allocated to, with 80, 83 and 86 patients in the three respective groups. The sex and age distributions and the number of previously treated hypertensives were similar in the three groups. At the end of placebo treatment the supine blood pressures in the three groups (bisoprolol 5 or 10 mg day-1 or atenolol 50 mg day-1, respectively) were 163.9/102.5, 157.4/101.8 and 160.0/102.2 mmHg, respectively. The systolic blood pressure was higher (P less than 0.05) in the group receiving bisoprolol 5 mg day-1 than in the 10 mg day-1 group. After 26 weeks of treatment the supine blood pressures in the three groups were 150.6/90.8, 142.0/89.1 and 148.6/91.7 mmHg, respectively. The largest estimated difference in blood pressure reduction was 4.6/2.3 mmHg between the group receiving bisoprolol 10 mg day-1 and the group receiving atenolol 50 mg day-1. A reduction in mean blood pressure of greater than or equal to 10 mmHg was noted in 66% of the patients in the bisoprolol group (10 mg day-1), in the other groups 66 and 59%, n.s. Bisoprolol is effective, well-tolerated and safe in the treatment of hypertension. A daily dose of 5 mg seems recommendable for the majority of hypertensive patients and seems equipotent with 50 mg day-1 of atenolol in the present study.", 
    "2": "In order to verify the anti-ischaemic effect of a new beta-blocking agent, bisoprolol, a double blind parallel groups trial was carried out in comparison with verapamil. 26 patients with a history of spontaneous and/or effort angina were studied. After a two-week treatment with placebo, they were randomized in two groups. One group was treated for 4 weeks with bisoprolol 10 mg o.d. and for the following 4 weeks with bisoprolol 20 mg o.d. The other group received verapamil 80 mg t.i.d. for the first 4 weeks and 120 mg t.i.d. for the remaining 4 weeks. Throughout the study isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg b.i.d. was administered and sublingual nitroglycerin was allowed when necessary. 21 patients completed the study. Both bisoprolol and verapamil significantly reduced the number of angina episodes and nitroglycerin tablets consumption, as well as ischaemic episodes recorded on Holter ECG. The total number and severity of ectopic ventricular beats were reduced too. On multistage treadmill exercise test, both drugs increased effort time and time to ST depression = 1 mm, and reduced ST depression and double-product. The effect of bisoprolol on double product was greater than that of verapamil because of the better control of heart rate. The relationship ST/double product suggested that beta-blockers act essentially through the reduction of myocardial oxygen consumption and verapamil possibly with an additive effect on coronary circulation. Radionuclide ventriculography showed no deterioration of rest ventricular function with both drugs. In conclusion, bisoprolol and verapamil showed a satisfactory anti-ischaemic effect, with good tolerability.", 
    "3": "The efficacy and safety of the new cardioselective beta-blocker bisoprolol 5 mg and 10 mg once daily in the treatment of angina pectoris was compared with atenolol 100 mg once daily. 19 patients with coronary artery disease and angina of effort completed a randomised, three-way crossover study which consisted of six-week treatment periods preceeded by a two-week placebo washout. Treadmill exercise stress tests were carried out approximately 24 hours after each dose, at the end of the placebo period and after 2 and 6 weeks of each active treatment period. Patients recorded their angina attack rate and GTN consumption on diary cards. Number of anginal attacks, GTN consumption, resting and exercise systolic blood pressure, heart rate and double product were reduced, and both exercise duration and time to 1 mm ST-segment depression during exercise were increased to a similar extent by all three treatment regimens (P less than 0.01, paired t test). The only differences between the treatments were that the reductions in heart rate, double product and exercise blood pressure tended to be smaller after 6 weeks of bisoprolol 5 mg. Generally, there was no significant difference between the improvements measured at week 2 of each phase and at week 6 (P greater than 0.05, analysis of variance). All three dosage regimens were well tolerated. The data indicate that there is no difference between the safety and efficacy of bisoprolol 10 mg and atenolol 100 mg once daily in the treatment of angina pectoris. In addition, the 10 mg dose of bisoprolol would seem to have only a small advantage over the lower 5 mg once daily dose.", 
    "4": "In a 4-week randomized, double-blind study, 87 patients with essential hypertension received either 10 mg bisoprolol (B) or 100 mg metoprolol (M) once daily (o.d.). The effects of the beta blockers on systolic blood pressure, heart rate and rate-pressure product during exercise, 24 h (E2) and 3 h (E3) after administration (p.a.) were compared with the values obtained in the baseline exercise test (E1). 24 hours p.a. the effects of B were significantly stronger than of M (E1-E2: B vs M; P less than 0.01) whereas 3 h p.a. no significant differences were detectable between B and M. The residual effects 24 h p.a. in relation to the effects 3 h p.a. (E1-E2/E1-E3) were significantly greater with B (86-93%) than with M (53-66%). In contrast to the findings with 100 mg M o.d., 10 mg bisoprolol o.d. guarantees a persistent reduction in exercise blood pressure and heart rate throughout the entire dosage interval of 24 h.", 
    "5": "The long-term efficacy of isradipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with marked vascular selectivity, was evaluated in 17 patients with essential hypertension. All had a supine diastolic blood pressure of greater than 95 mmHg with 10 mg pindolol once daily. After a short-term, double-blind, dose-finding, crossover comparison with addition of isradipine or placebo twice daily, they continued on pindolol and their optimal dose of isradipine in a single-blind, long-term follow-up study. Eighteen patients were recruited but one male patient discontinued treatment after 2 weeks due to ankle oedema and will not be accounted for in the overall evaluation. There were 11 males and six females with a mean age of 56 +/- 10 years. In the short-term study on the optimal dose of isradipine (5.1 mg twice daily) blood pressure was lowered by 24/18 mmHg (P less than 0.001). No change in heart rate was seen despite the substantial drop in blood pressure. In the long-term study the patients were seen for a mean follow-up time of 12.5 months (range 4-17 months). After the longest follow-up time mean arterial pressure was 107.0 +/- 7.4 compared with 120.1 +/- 8.2 mmHg after placebo baseline [delta = 13 mmHg (11%), P less than 0.001, n = 17]. The heart rate was unchanged (delta = 0.2 beats/min, 95% confidence limits -3, +3), and so was ankle circumference (delta = 0.12 cm, 95% confidence interval, -1, +1). On the other hand, mean weight was reduced by 2 kg from 90 kg (P less than 0.05, n = 17).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "We studied a total of 88 previously untreated hypertensives in order to determine the long-term effect of antihypertensive therapy on echocardiographically confirmed left ventricular hypertrophy. The drugs tested were the beta-blocker metoprolol (200 mg/day; 26 patients; mean age 43.9 years; follow-up 32 months), the calcium antagonist gallopamil (100-150 mg/day; 26 patients; mean age 49.7 years; follow-up 23 months) and a combination of 50 mg atenolol and 20 mg nifedipine (36 patients; mean age 44.2 years; follow-up 18 months). Despite similar reductions in resting blood pressure, each of the three therapeutical regimens had a different effect on the left ventricular mass index after 1 year of treatment: gallopamil reduced the index by 13.2% (170 +/- 49 to 148 +/- 41 g/m2, P less than 0.001), metoprolol by 21.9% (150 +/- 27 to 117 +/- 27 g/m2, P less than 0.001) and atenolol + nifedipine by 30.8% (148 +/- 33 to 103 +/- 21 g/m2, P less than 0.001). Similar results were obtained for interventricular septal (9.9, 15.4 and 20.7%, respectively) and posterior wall thicknesses (10.4, 16.7 and 24.1%, respectively). During the follow-up there was a further significant reduction in ventricular hypertrophy under all three treatments, but no significant changes in ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions or in fractional shortening.", 
    "7": "The effects of changes in left ventricular mass following beta-adrenergic blockade therapy (sotalol) on left ventricular filling indices were examined in 16 patients with essential hypertension aged 46 +/- 8.3 years (mean +/- s.d.). The peak atrial to peak early diastolic velocity (A:E) ratio and the peak filling rate (PFR = peak early diastolic velocity X mitral annulus area) were measured by the use of pulsed Doppler left ventricular inflow time-velocity plots following placebo and after 8-12 weeks of sotalol monotherapy (160 mg/day). Compared with normal controls of similar age, our patients had a larger left ventricular mass and impaired left ventricular filling indices. Following sotalol, mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased by 14%, the heart rate by 15% and left ventricular mass by 11%, while diastolic filling improved (A:E 17% and PFR 21%). Six patients had a decrease in left ventricular mass of greater than 15% (group A); other patients (group B) showed a smaller reduction. In spite of comparable changes in MAP and heart rate in groups A and B, the patients in group A showed a smaller degree of improvement in the A:E ratio. It is concluded that sotalol can induce regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and improve left ventricular filling in hypertensive patients, and it seems that improvement in diastolic filling is related to a reduction in afterload rather than to a decrease in left ventricular mass.", 
    "8": "The effects of beta-adrenergic blockade and hyperthyroidism on cardiac myocyte structure was examined. Isolated myocytes were prepared from controls and rats treated for 10 weeks with desiccated thyroid hormone (T), propranolol, and desiccated thyroid hormone plus propranolol (TP). Cells were collected from the right and left ventricle. Cell volume was measured with a Coulter Channelyzer system. Cell length was measured directly using a phase microscope. Myocyte cross-sectional area was calculated from cell volume/length. In addition, hearts from animals in each group were perfusion-fixed and myocyte volume percent was determined morphometrically from tissue sections. The number of right and left ventricular myocytes was calculated using data from isolated cells and whole-sectioned tissue. Propranolol normalized heart rate in hyperthyroid rats. Heart weight to body weight ratios were elevated to a similar extent in both T and TP groups. Compared with controls, myocyte volume was increased (p less than 0.01) in each region of T and TP. Right ventricles had a greater degree of myocyte hypertrophy than left ventricles in both rat groups treated with thyroid hormones. Cell length was increased (p less than 0.01) in T and TP. Most of the myocyte hypertrophy, however, was due to an increase in cross-sectional area. Although volume was unchanged with propranolol treatment alone, myocytes from each region had an increase in length (p less than 0.01) and a reduction in cross-sectional area (N.S.). Myocyte number was slightly reduced in each treatment group, but changes were not statistically significant. In conclusion, thyroid hormones stimulate myocyte hypertrophy by increasing both length and cross-sectional area. Propranolol modifies myocyte dimensions in both euthyroid and hyperthyroid rats, but does not prevent thyroid hormone induced cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "9": "The effects of graded lower body negative pressure (-10 and -40 mm Hg) on vascular resistance and plasma vasopressin, norepinephrine, and renin activity were assessed in seven hypertensive subjects with left ventricular hypertrophy and seven sex-matched and age-matched normotensive subjects. In both groups increasing levels of lower body negative pressure induced a progressive decrease in right atrial pressure and an increase in vascular resistance. In normal subjects plasma vasopressin, norepinephrine, and renin activity were progressively raised, whereas only the higher level of stimulation increased plasma renin activity, norepinephrine, and vasopressin in hypertensive subjects. Propranolol induced a significant increase in plasma vasopressin in normal subjects (from 1.3 +/- 0.1 to 2.0 +/- 0.1 pg/ml; p less than 0.05) but not in hypertensive subjects. In this latter condition -10 mm Hg lower body negative pressure failed to increase plasma vasopressin, norepinephrine, and renin activity in normal subjects. Propranolol abolished the change in plasma renin activity in both groups, reduced the increase in vascular resistance induced by -40 mm Hg lower body negative pressure in normotensive subjects, but did not modify the rise in vasopressin elicited by this stimulus in normal subjects or the humoral and hemodynamic reflex responses evoked in hypertensive subjects. These results suggest that cardiopulmonary receptors are involved in the control of vasopressin release in normal subjects, whereas in hypertensive subjects with left ventricular hypertrophy, this control is altered because of an impaired function of cardiopulmonary receptors.", 
    "10": "In the clinical management of heart disease, calcium channel blockers are generally prescribed in combination with one or more anti-angina, antiarrhythmic, or antihypertensive agents. Two different mechanisms are involved in drug interactions: pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic. In the former, the disposition of one drug is altered by the action of another, causing an increase or decrease in its absorption or its modified distribution, metabolism, or excretion. In pharmacodynamic interactions, the physiologic effects of one drug interfere either directly or indirectly with those of another, for instance, by alterations in fluid or electrolyte balance. This effect may be antagonistic or additive. The present work outlines the possible adverse interactions between the three main calcium antagonists and other therapeutic agents, including digoxin, beta blockers and antiarrhythmic, anesthetic, antihypertensive, antiasthmatic, and antidiabetic drugs and contrast media. Knowledge of these effects is of major clinical importance in the treatment of cardiac patients.", 
    "11": "We studied the acute effects of intravenous nifedipine on hemodynamics and left ventricular function of CAD patients without previous treatment (group 1) and of 10 CAD patients receiving acebutolol (9 mg/kg daily) and who had been shown to be adequately beta blocked (reduction in heart rate by 25%) (group 2). Intravenous nifedipine (15 micrograms/kg) significantly reduced systemic peripheral resistances in both groups: this was associated with decreased systolic blood pressure and increased left ventricular cardiac output with a slight nonsignificant increase of ejection fraction. There was a significant increase in heart rate in both groups, the chronotropic response to nifedipine being attenuated in patients receiving acebutolol. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure did not change in the first group, but it was significantly decreased in the second group, with a concomitant increase of end-diastolic left ventricular volume, suggesting an amelioration of diastolic compliance. The effect of nifedipine on intrinsic myocardial contractility was quite different, depending on the presence of beta adrenergic blockade. When given to patients of group 1, nifedipine significantly increased dP/dtmax, Vcemax, and Vmaxd. The same indices, however, were significantly depressed when nifedipine was given to the patients of group 2 receiving acebutolol. This study shows that intravenous nifedipine can be usefully administered to patients with coronary artery disease who have been on adequate beta-blocking doses of acebutolol with relative safety. Under these conditions nifedipine increases cardiac output in association with arterial dilation, despite evidence for a negative inotropic effect. These data also suggest that such an intrinsic negative inotropic effect would normally be masked by compensatory sympathetic activity.", 
    "12": "Data have been reviewed and presented which suggest that substances from two different chemical groups, congeners of alinidine and falipamil, respectively, can be described as representatives of a novel and distinct pharmacological class: specific bradycardic agents (SBAs). They are characterized by a slowing of the sinus rate within physiological limits as the prominent cardiovascular effect. Involvement of alpha-adrenoceptors, beta-adrenoceptors and cholinergic receptors as mediators of the bradycardic effects have been excluded. Experiments in isolated atrial preparations suggested that drugs of the same type as alinidine or as falipamil have a similar mode of rate lowering action which is different from that of Ca-channel blockers: low external Ca2+ increased and low Na+ as well as high K+ decreased the bradycardic effect of SBA; verapamil behaved in the opposite way. Combination of different SBAs did not result in excessive additive rate-lowering effects; in contrast, addition of verapamil to maximally acting concentrations of SBAs resulted in a further significant reduction in rate. SBAs were much more potent in reducing spontaneous sinus rate than in reducing BaCl2 induced automaticity, whereas Ca-channel blockers behaved in the opposite way. Differences in the cardiovascular profile against other drugs with rate lowering effects have been pointed out: beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents more markedly decrease contractility and Ca-channel blocking agents more markedly decrease contractility, slow down AV conduction and have vasorelaxing properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "At the time of hospital admission the distinction between reversible ischaemia (angina) and myocardial damage (infarction) is often difficult. Thus it would be advantageous when a similar therapeutic approach could be used in both conditions. Alinidine was given intravenously (10-40 mg) to 24 patients with unstable angina. Heart rate decreased as well as systolic and mean arterial pressure, while stroke volume remained constant. One patient developed heart failure due to an overdose of alinidine (80 mg) in combination with a beta blocker. Furthermore, alinidine was administered in 32 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 23 of these suffered from heart failure. Similar haemodynamic effects were observed while a rise of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure occurred in two patients only. Alinidine appears to be a safe drug for reduction of heart rate in patients with unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction. Further studies to verify the clinical benefit of such a treatment are required.", 
    "14": "Etintidine HCl is a potent H2-blocker. The effect of clinical doses of etintidine on the disposition of a single oral dose of propranolol was investigated in 12 normal subjects. This was a double-blind, two-way crossover study. Each subject received etintidine (400 mg) or placebo twice a day with meals for 4 days on two occasions (separated by 4 days). On each occasion, the subjects were fasted overnight on Day 3 and were given an oral dose of Inderal (40 mg propranolol hydrochloride) 30 min following the administration of the morning dose of etintidine or placebo on Day 4. Blood samples were collected prior to and up to 24 hr following the administration of propranolol. The plasma samples were analyzed for propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol by HPLC. Comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters of propranolol between etintidine and the placebo groups indicates that etintidine significantly increased the AUC0-infinity values (573.5 vs. 146.4 ng.hr/ml, p = 0.0001) and prolonged the elimination half-life (4.61 vs. 2.33 hr) of propranolol. Statistical evaluation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of 4-hydroxypropranolol indicates that etintidine also increased the AUC0-24 values (43.8 vs. 16.4 ng.hr/ml, p = 0.0028) and prolonged the elimination half-life (4.87 vs. 1.97 hr) of 4-hydroxypropranolol. The data suggest that etintidine, like cimetidine, impaired the elimination of propranolol. Etintidine also protracted the elimination of 4-hydroxypropranolol, an active metabolite of propranolol.", 
    "15": "Beta blocker monotherapy is often considered to be inadequate in essential hypertension. It was the aim of this study to compare the antihypertensive activity of the new betablocker bisoprolol with the diuretic combination: hydrochlorothiazide plus amiloride. Forty hypertensive patients (DBP 95-120 mmHg) were enrolled in the study, of which 34 were evaluable for efficacy. The patients were, under double-blind conditions, randomly allocated to receive 10 mg bisoprolol (B) or 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide plus 5 mg amiloride (HA) as single daily doses for 30 days. Patients whose DBP had been normalized (less than or equal to 90 mmHg) after 30 days (D 30) continued the monotherapy for another 30 days. Patients whose DBP remained over 90 mmHg were, under single-blind conditions, kept on their initial treatment but received in addition the alternative drug for another 30 days (D 60). Blood pressure measurements were performed 24 hours after drug intake. The two groups comprising 17 patients each were comparable with regard to the patients' characteristics and baseline blood pressure values. After 30 days of treatment supine SBP, DBP and HR were significantly more reduced with B than with HA. The mean reduction of DBP was 16.8 +/- 8.0 mmHg with B and 8.4 +/- 6.4 mmHg with HA (P less than 0.002). After 30 days of monotherapy, blood pressure was within the normal range in 15/17 (88.2%) patients treated with B but in only 4/17 (23.5%) patients treated with HA (B vs HA: P less than 0.001). In the B group, there was a further slight decrease in SBP, DBP and HR during the second 30 day period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs can be characterised by their pharmacokinetic properties. One of the most important factors appears to be lipid solubility. Lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as propranolol, oxprenolol and metoprolol, are cleared by the liver and undergo hepatic 'first-pass' metabolism. This results in low bioavailability, substantial interpatient variability in 'steady-state' plasma drug concentrations, rapid elimination half-lives and the possibility of drug interactions with other drugs such as pentobarbitone and cimetidine which affect hepatic enzymes. In addition, lipid soluble drugs are distributed widely within the body and penetrate the brain easily and rapidly. This may result in centrally mediated adverse effects such as vivid dreams. In contrast, the more water-soluble beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, such as atenolol, sotalol and nadolol, are cleared by the kidney unchanged. They show less interpatient variation in plasma levels, have longer elimination half-lives and do not interact with drugs affecting hepatic enzymes. They penetrate the central nervous system less easily and cause less central side-effect. Between these two extremes, there are several drugs like betaxolol, bisoprolol and pindolol, which are cleared partly by the liver and partly by the kidney. Their clearance is only altered by severe renal or hepatic disease, and they do not appear to interact with enzyme inducers or inhibitors.", 
    "17": "Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, arterial blood flow and vascular resistance in the arm and in the leg were investigated in 9 healthy volunteers (22-40 years) after oral dosing with bisoprolol 10 mg, propranolol 40 mg, and placebo in a randomized double-blind cross-over study. Arterial blood flow and vascular resistance were determined in brachial and femoral arteries with unimpeded circulation, after exclusion of the hand or foot by placing a tourniquet on the wrist or ankle, and during post-ischaemic hyperaemia. Distal arterial occlusion allows one to isolate a predominantly muscular circulation in the forearm or, to a lesser extent, in the leg. Both active drugs induced a significant fall in heart rate and systolic blood pressure versus placebo with no significant difference between the drugs. Brachial and femoral flow rates were reduced by both drugs probably due to a fall in cardiac output, but the two beta blockers produced different effects on vascular resistance: propranolol significantly increased brachial vascular resistance compared with placebo and bisoprolol, both during unimpeded circulation and during occlusion of the hand by a wrist tourniquet. Bisoprolol had no influence on brachial vascular resistance. Both drugs induced small increases in femoral vascular resistance. The different action on local vascular resistance in the brachial artery territory could be interpreted as the expression of the high beta 1 selectivity of bisoprolol leaving the vascular beta 2 receptors unopposed, whereas non-selective propranolol acts on both beta-adrenoceptor subtypes.", 
    "18": "The aim of this study was the electrophysiological evaluation of bisoprolol, a new highly cardioselective beta blocker, void of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and without significant membrane stabilizing action. 10 patients (4 males and 6 females, mean age 67.5 years) with cardiac arrhythmias or syncopes of undetermined origin underwent His bundle recording with incremental as well as programmed atrial and ventricular pacing in an electrophysiological study. Electrophysiological parameters were measured at basal conditions and at 15 and 30 minutes after the infusion of bisoprolol 5 mg (for patient 1 to 5) and 10 mg (for patient 6 to 10). All electrophysiological parameters were within normal range at basal evaluation. Bisoprolol prolongs significantly sinus cycle length, corrected sinus node recovery time, AH interval, cycle length inducing AV-node block, effective and functional refractory periods of the AV-node. All these parameters remained within normal limits and were modified to about the same extent by 5 and 10 mg of the drug. No drug-related changes of QT interval were observed. Bisoprolol have been confirmed to have strictly beta-blocking properties.", 
    "19": "The cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist bisoprolol (4-1024 micrograms kg-1) caused in anaesthetized open-chest pigs a dose-dependent decrease in cardiac output, which was primarily due to a negative chronotropic action as heart rate decreased more than stroke volume. The decrease in stroke volume apparently resulted from a negative inotropic action of the drug, reflected by a decrease in max LV dP/dt in animals both with and without atrial pacing. A mild increase in systemic vascular resistance prevented serious hypotension. Pulmonary artery pressure was not affected, as pulmonary vascular resistance increased although the increase was statistically significant only with the highest concentration. The dose-related decreases in left ventricular blood flow were equally distributed over all myocardial layers and were the consequence of the reduced metabolic needs of the myocardium. Cerebral blood flow was well preserved but the changes in blood flow to some other organs and tissues (kidneys, stomach and skeletal muscle) paralleled that in cardiac output. The systemic haemodynamic effects of bisoprolol (16-1024 micrograms kg-1; i.v.) in conscious pigs resembled closely those observed in anaesthetised animals and were similar to those exerted by propanolol (25-300 micrograms kg-1; i.v.) in the same preparation. The effectiveness of bisoprolol and propranolol in antagonizing isoprenaline-induced changes in heart rate and max LV dP/dt were, however, markedly different. While propranolol inhibited both parameters to the same extent, bisoprolol was more effective in inhibiting max LV dP/dt than heart rate responses in conscious animals, probably due to beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity.", 
    "20": "Recently, bisoprolol has been investigated regarding its effects on exercise tolerance and the duration of action in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) following single oral administration. It appears, however, that the extent of effects of 5 mg bisoprolol is not fully established yet. Therefore, the effects of 5 and 10 mg bisoprolol and the duration of action were assessed in 12 patients (10 male, 2 female; mean age 60.2 years) with stable angina pectoris due to CHD after repeated administration. Patients were given 5 or 10 mg bisoprolol once daily for 2 weeks according to a double-blind, randomized cross-over design. At entry one exercise tolerance test (ETT) served as baseline measurement and following each treatment period ETTs were performed before (24-hour value) and 3 hours after tablet intake. Exercise capacity (in W X min) was calculated until the onset of angina, 0.1 mV ST-segment depression and at peak exercise. Compared to baseline all workload values during active therapy were significantly improved (P less than or equal to 0.05) except for the workload till onset of angina with bisoprolol 5 mg at 24 hours. The effects at 3 hours were significantly stronger than those after 24 hours for both dosages. Significantly stronger effects were observed 3 hours as well as 24 hours after intake during treatment with 10 mg compared to 5 mg: at peak exercise on heart rate (P less than or equal to 0.05) and exercise capacity (P less than or equal to 0.01), at identical workload on heart rate (P less than or equal to 0.01) and rate-pressure product (P less than or equal to 0.01). It was found that bisoprolol 5 mg once daily leads to therapeutic effects with a clearly maintained duration of action over 24 hours, but further increase of peak exercise capacity may be achieved with 10 mg.", 
    "21": "In a double blind, placebo controlled study, propranolol (240 mg), atenolol (200 mg) or bisoprolol (100 mg) were administered as a single oral dose to groups of 6 healthy male volunteers. Exercise tachycardia was monitored for 84 hours after administration of the drugs to monitor beta blockade in vivo. Plasma samples drawn in parallel with these effects were used to detect beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptor occupancy in two subtype selective in vitro receptor binding assays. Reduction of exercise tachycardia parallels beta 1-adrenoceptor occupancy. Furthermore, at comparable beta 1-adrenoceptor occupancy, less beta 2-adrenoceptor occupancy was observed after bisoprolol than after atenolol. The latter finding is in agreement with the two-fold higher beta 1/beta 2-selectivity ratio of bisoprolol (75-fold) versus atenolol (35-fold). It is concluded, that beta blockade observed via the reduction of exercise tachycardia can be delineated from the in vitro occupancy of beta 1-adrenoceptors by an antagonist present in plasma samples.", 
    "22": "The pharmacokinetic profile of an oral single dose of the new cardioselective beta-blocking agent, bisoprolol, was studied in patients with moderate and severe liver disease (Pugh group B and C, respectively) and normal subjects. In patients with liver disease a significant increase in the drug elimination half-life, mean residence time, area under the curve, and time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) was observed with a significant reduction in the oral clearance compared with the control population. There was significant positive correlation between the Pugh Score (an objective measurement of hepatic dysfunction) and the volume of distribution. The drug was well tolerated although a rise in blood urea and creatinine of over 50% was observed in 4 of 9 patients with severe liver disease. In conclusion, the delayed absorption in these patients results in lower plasma concentrations and indicates that dose adjustment is not necessary but it is recommended that the upper limit for the daily dose should be set at 10 mg; this also applies under chronic dosing of bisoprolol.", 
    "23": "The pharmacokinetics of the beta-blocking agents presently available render some subject to accumulation in renal or hepatic failure. Bisoprolol is one of the beta blockers possessing balanced clearance (both renal and hepatic clearance) which prevents such accumulation even in the case of complete failure of kidneys or liver. The single dose pharmacokinetics of bisoprolol were studied in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment and in healthy controls. Correlations were demonstrated between creatinine clearance and elimination half-life, mean residence time, area under the curve, total clearance and maximum concentration in those with renal dysfunction. The elimination half-life increased by a factor of 1.96 in those with severe renal dysfunction. Because of its balanced clearance, it is unlikely that accumulation of bisoprolol would occur beyond a factor of 2 on dosing to a steady state. The 48 hour plasma levels in the patients on dialysis were similar to those of the patients with severe renal dysfunction. This suggest that accumulation is unlikely, even in end stage renal failure. Bisoprolol may be used safely in patients with renal dysfunction. No adjustment of dose is necessary for those with mild to moderate dysfunction, but in severe or end stage renal failure the dose should not exceed 10 mg once daily.", 
    "24": "Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs reduce mortality by about 20% when used to treat patients in the first 1-3 years after a myocardial infarction. There is suggestive evidence of benefit, averaging about 14% reduction in mortality, when they are used acutely in the coronary crisis. The benefits of beta blockade in primary prevention in patients under treatment for hypertension are less clearly established. Two studies have suggested a benefit but only in non-smoking men, a third study has not confirmed the hypothesis. More evidence is needed. As there is little evidence of comparable benefit with other types of drug, e.g. calcium slow-channel inhibitors, it is reasonable to use beta-blocking drugs in male hypertensives (who should be encouraged to stop smoking in any case), unless there are specific contra-indications.", 
    "25": "Bisoprolol is a new highly beta 1-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug; it is devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic effects. Its haemodynamic effects are those expected from beta 1-blockade, heart rate is reduced at rest and on exercise, cardiac output falls and peripherial resistance is increased. Consequent on the beta 1-selectivity there is much greater inhibition of exercise tachycardia compared to inhibition of isoprenaline-induced falls of diastolic blood pressure, in contrast to propranolol. Studies in asthmatics confirm the selectivity of bisoprolol. Bisoprolol has similar solubility in water and organic solvents and predictably therefore about half is excreted by the kidneys unchanged, half metabolized by the liver. Estimates of half-life average about 10-12 h, this is in accord with the therapeutic efficacy of once daily administration. Therapeutic studies have demonstrated the efficacy of bisoprolol in angina pectoris, arrhythmias and hypertension. Comparative studies against atenolol and verapamil in angina suggest similar efficacy. In hypertension a similar antihypertensive effect to nifedipine has been found, while a significantly greater lowering of blood pressure was seen than that obtained with a diuretic. Some studies have also suggested more consistent antihypertensive effect from bisoprolol than atenolol 24 h after administration. This may have been a dosage phenomenon or reflects the longer plasma elimination half-life of bisoprolol, and requires confirmation. Bisoprolol has a favourable side-effect profile.", 
    "26": "A pilot study was performed in hypertensive patients (a) to investigate the duration of blood pressure reduction produced by the new beta blocker bisoprolol (10 mg o.d.) after cessation of a 4 week treatment using non-invasive 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements, (b) to study the effects of the drug on large arteries using non-invasive brachio-radial pulse wave velocity and aortic abdominal diameter measurements 3 hours after the last dose of a 4 week treatment. In comparison with the results obtained before treatment a significant reduction of blood pressure and heart rate was observed up to the 40th hour after treatment was terminated. The finding may be relevant for further evaluation of withdrawal phenomena produced by beta-blocking agents. The antihypertensive effect of bisoprolol was associated with significant decreases in brachio-radial pulse wave velocity (from 10.4 +/- 0.4 to 8.6 +/- 0.4 m s-1) and in aortic abdominal diameter (from 18.2 +/- 1.0 to 17.5 +/- 1.3 mm) indicating an increase in arterial distensibility. Further studies are needed to substantiate these observations and to reveal their mechanisms of action.", 
    "27": "20 patients with confirmed diagnoses of arterial hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were studied. Groups of 10 patients each were treated with propranolol 2 X 40 mg p.o. or betaxolol (Kerlone) 20 mg p.o., respectively. Pulmonary function, blood pressure and heart rate were assessed before and at 2, 4 and 6 h after administration of the first tablet on day 1 of the study. The same parameters were recorded 2 h after ingestion of the morning dose on each of the following days. Both drugs caused comparable significant decreases in blood pressure and heart rate on the 1st day of treatment. Propranolol was associated with a documented increase in the degree of bronchial obstruction.", 
    "28": "1. The effects of continuous stimulation of the peripheral end of the ascending cervical sympathetic nerve were compared with those of intermittent stimulation, so arranged as to deliver the same total number of impulses, in cats under chloralose anaesthesia. 2. Continuous stimulation caused a flow of saliva at 5-10 Hz, but not at 2 Hz. In contrast, the same total number of impulses delivered intermittently in bursts elicited a prompt secretion at a frequency as low as 20 Hz for 1 s at 10 s intervals (corresponding to 2 Hz continuously) and a significantly higher rate of secretion at 50 Hz in bursts than that obtained in response to 5 Hz continuously. 3. Continuous stimulation also caused a rise in submandibular vascular resistance (s.v.r.), which persisted throughout the period of stimulation, and was followed immediately thereafter by an intense but transient fall in s.v.r. During stimulation in 1 s bursts, each burst was followed first by a brief rise in s.v.r. and shortly after by a fall. The balance between these two components varied widely between individual animals but often led to an overall fall in s.v.r. during stimulation i.e. complete reversal of the mean vascular effect. A further fall in s.v.r. was then recorded when the stimulus was discontinued. 4. Propranolol (1.0 mg/kg) reduced but failed to abolish the secretory response. It also altered the balance between the two phases of the vascular response slightly in favour of a rise in s.v.r. during stimulation, without apparently affecting the size of the after-dilatation. 5. Pre-treatment with dihydroergotamine (1.0 mg/kg) invariably blocked secretion and revealed a small vasodilator response during sympathetic stimulation with either pattern of stimulation; it also blocked the after-dilatation. 6. Following combined pre-treatment with propranolol and dihydroergotamine, to produce total adrenergic blockade, there was a small residual vasoconstrictor component which amounted to an increase in mean s.v.r. of about 20% during stimulation at 10 Hz continuously. This may have been due to release of neuropeptide Y (NPY). 7. Small but significantly greater amounts of NPY were released into the effluent blood during stimulation of the ascending cervical sympathetic nerve at 70 Hz in bursts than during continuous stimulation. No significant release of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin, bombesin, substance P or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was observed during stimulation at any frequency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The effectiveness of drugs or cardioplegic agents in preserving myocardial metabolism during and immediately after ischaemia can be tested on various models. The results obtained in different experiments and the metabolic studies conducted in patients treated with cardiotropic drugs illustrate the value of this method in cardiovascular pharmacology.", 
    "30": "The Swedish trial in old patients with hypertension (STOP-Hypertension) is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind study of beta-blockers/diuretics versus placebo in old hypertensives. Primary end-points are stroke and myocardial infarction (fatal and non-fatal) as well as other cardiovascular mortality. To evaluate the logistics of STOP-Hypertension, a pilot study was carried out. All patients aged 70-84 years in 31 centres were consecutively registered in a log-book. Altogether 4668 patients were screened: 41.5% had previously been treated for hypertension and 13.5% had blood pressures greater than or equal to 180/105 mmHg. Thus, 55% were 'hypertensive'. In all, 465 patients (18% of the 'hypertensive' patients) started a 3-month washout period (previously treated, n = 396) or a 4-week run-in period (previously untreated, n = 69) period. The most frequent reasons for not starting the run-in/washout were other indications for treatment with beta-blockers/diuretics (13%), unwillingness to participate (8%) or isolated systolic hypertension (4%). The pilot study was evaluated after 1 year: 89 patients (1.9%) had been randomized, 66 patients (1.4%) were still in the run-in/washout period and the majority of the remaining patients were not randomized because they had not reached the inclusion blood pressure (greater than or equal to 180 mmHg systolic and/or greater than or equal to 105 mmHg diastolic) following withdrawal of their antihypertensive medication. During the run-in/washout period there were few serious clinical events: one case of myocardial infarction, three patients had strokes (two fatal), 10 developed congestive heart failure, three tachyarrhythmia and two pneumonia (one fatal).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "The properties of beta-adrenergic receptors were studied in normal and in flow restricted regions of the dog heart. Purified cardiac membrane preparations and papillary muscle preparations were isolated from control and ischemic areas and tested a) following chronic beta-receptor blockade with metipranolol or exaprolol, and b) after acute regional myocardial ischemia. A significant reduction in the sensitivity of the heart muscle preparations from compromised heart for isoprenaline resulting in a reduced affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors to exaprolol was observed. Quantitative ligand binding data showed higher numbers of (3H) dihydroalprenolol/(3H) DHA/binding sites in the membrane fraction obtained from compromised compared to control myocardium. The ratio of intra- to extracellular beta-adrenergic receptors decreased from 1.35 to 0.55 in the membrane fractions obtained from the compromised hearts. Pretreatment of experimental animals with metipranolol or propranolol attenuated the observed increase in the total number of beta-adrenergic receptor sites in myocardial membrane fractions from ischemic hearts. These data suggest preferential distribution of beta-adrenergic binding sites from intracellular to membrane fractions in flow restricted regions of the dog heart after coronary occlusion.", 
    "32": "In a placebo-controlled study the hemodynamic effects of single doses of oxprenolol, metoprolol, prenalterol, phentolamine, nifedipine, nitroglycerin, angiotensin II and frusemide have been investigated in 9 healthy volunteers by means of the combined measurement of heart rate, blood pressure, pre-ejection period (systolic time intervals) and stroke volume (impedance cardiography) in the supine and tilted positions (70 degrees). Each cardiovascular agent exhibited its characteristic pharmacodynamic profile, which allowed a clear-cut discrimination. The effects of oxprenolol and metoprolol, however, could not be distinguished by this procedure. The pre-ejection period, although not a very specific parameter, proved to be most sensitive to the pharmacological interventions, whereas stroke volume was less often influenced. It is concluded that the proposed selection of non-invasive parameters is a very suitable and simple means for early cardiovascular drug testing in man.", 
    "33": "The effect of inflammation, induced in rats by injection of turpentine oil, on drug disposition has been evaluated in rat isolated perfused livers. The drugs studied were a low extraction drug, antipyrine, and two high extraction drugs, lignocaine and propranolol. Turpentine significantly increased the half-life of antipyrine and of propranolol, but not that of lignocaine. Proadifen (SKF 525A) significantly increased the half-life of all three drugs. Turpentine decreased the clearance of antipyrine significantly by about 50% and that of propranolol non-significantly by about 20%, but did not affect the clearance of lignocaine. Proadifen significantly decreased the clearance of all three drugs, but this was most pronounced for antipyrine. In both turpentine- and proadifen-treated rats a significant increase in volume of distribution of propranolol was observed. The results show that, as with proadifen, turpentine-induced inflammation affects the hepatic clearance of antipyrine in the rat isolated perfused liver. With both high extraction drugs, the effect of inflammation on their clearance was low or absent, in contrast to the effect of proadifen. This suggests that a possible effect of inflammation on intrinsic clearance is not large enough to influence the hepatic clearance of the high extraction drugs.", 
    "34": "The stereoselective binding of six pairs of basic, one pair of acidic drug enantiomers, and one pair of diastereomers for human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was investigated by means of competition experiments against [3H]propranolol- or [14C]nicardipine-labelled binding sites using equilibrium dialysis to separate free from bound marker ligand. The affinity constants (Ka) for association of [3H]propranolol and [14C]nicardipine with alpha 1-AGP were 1.2 +/- 0.6 X 10(5) M-1 and 3.4 +/- 1.4 X 10(5) M-1, respectively, and control binding amounted to 57 +/- 7 and 91 +/- 2%, respectively. The following selectivity factors, calculated as the ratio of the higher over the lower enantiomer concentrations displacing 15% of control radiomarker binding (IC15-value), were obtained against propranolol and nicardipine: (-)/(+) propranolol: 1.9 and 1.7.; (+)-/(-)-disopyramide: 2.8 and 1.4; (+)-/(-)-verapamil: 1.6 and 1.9; (+)-(S)-/(-)-(R)-202-791, a dihydropyridine derivative: 2.6 and 2.0; (-)-/(+)-asocainol: 1.7 and 3.0; (+)-/(-)-tilidine: 1.1 and approximately equal to 2; (-)-(S)-/(+)-(R)- warfarin: 1.6 and 2.4; (+/-)-cis/(+/-)-trans-trans-tilidine: 1.7 and 1.8. When the calculation of radioligand-free fractions is also taken into account, it is apparent that only the tilidine isomers show no selectivity at propranolol-marked, and the disopyramide isomers at nicardipine-marked alpha 1-AGP-binding sites, in all other cases, a weak selectivity is detectable, which is, however, far below the values obtained for most neurotransmitter receptors. It is concluded that the single drug binding site of alpha 1-AGP is only slightly stereoselective and that the stereoselective binding of the drugs investigated is probably of no clinical consequence.", 
    "35": "Plasma propranolol concentrations after i.v. and i.a. 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg kg-1 doses of the drug given intravenously or intra-arterially have been compared in 7-week-old male Wistar rats. The areas under the curves after i.a. dosing were almost twice those after i.v. dosing at any dose, despite the elimination half-lives being the same. The difference in total body clearance after i.a. dosing from that after i.v. dosing indicated a significant contribution by pulmonary clearance, which ranged from about 20 to 30 mL min-1 kg-1, to the overall first-pass elimination after the i.v. administration. The pulmonary extraction ratio was approximately 0.4 to 0.5 at the i.v. doses used. Mean pulmonary transit time was estimated to be about 1 to 2 min. There was no dose-dependence in the pulmonary first-pass elimination kinetics of propranolol.", 
    "36": "Structural vascular changes in the precapillary arterioles are a cardinal feature of established hypertension, and have been described in several vascular beds. In brief, the wall:lumen ratio becomes increased due to hypertrophy of the vascular smooth muscle cells. This results in a reduction of the inner radius in the precapillary vessels, which causes a structurally based vascular hyperreactivity and accentuates the increase in systemic vascular resistance, another hallmark of established hypertension. Much interest has been devoted to the possibility of obtaining a regression of these structural vascular changes. Previously, the emphasis was on obtaining a fall in blood pressure, but more recently additional factors have also been considered, in particular the so-called trophic factors. In this context the calcium antagonists of the dihydropyridine type appear to be of particular interest, since these are markedly effective in lowering elevated arterial pressure, while at the same time they do not cause reflex-mediated elevations of trophic factors during long-term treatment. Few clinical data are yet available to show whether calcium antagonists can cause a regression of structural vascular changes, but some recent animal work suggests that they are clearly useful in this respect.", 
    "37": "This paper reviews published data concerning the effects of antihypertensive drugs on the development of atherosclerosis in experimental animal models with hyperlipoproteinaemia. Emphasis is placed on the influence of calcium channel antagonists on this process, and the potential mechanisms responsible for the effect. In addition, studies of the action of beta-receptor antagonists on atherogenesis are also summarized. The results indicate that several antihypertensive drugs may inhibit or retard experimentally-induced atherogenesis, even in normotensive animals, although the mechanisms for the effects remain poorly understood.", 
    "38": "The combination of one of the dihydropyridine class of calcium channel antagonists with a beta-adrenoceptor blocker has particular therapeutic advantages in the management of hypertension. The beta-blocker reduces the effects of the dihydropyridine-induced reflex increases in sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system activity, while the dihydropyridine reduces the peripheral effects of beta-blockade. Numerous studies have documented additional antihypertensive effects when these two classes of agents are used as combination therapy in hypertension. This therapeutic combination is well tolerated and produces minimal alterations in clinical laboratory tests. Initial concerns that the combination may impair atrioventricular conduction and left ventricular function have not been substantiated in widespread clinical trials.", 
    "39": "Beta-blocking agents are among the most frequently prescribed medications. To investigate the factors that influence their use we analysed the practices of 25 medical residents who provided longitudinal care in the out-patient clinics of a teaching hospital. A computer-based audit identified the 349 patients treated with one of four beta-blocking agents during a 4-month period. The most frequently prescribed was atenolol (48%), followed by metoprolol (28%), propranolol (20%), and nadolol (4%). Ease of use and compliance and continuation of a beta-blocker prescribed by a previous physician emerged as the most influential factors. In contrast, cost of drugs, manufacturers' promotions and advertisements had no significant influence on beta-blocker selection.",

Of the 157,771 patients admitted to these units, 16,358 met the BHAT criteria for a myocardial infarction, and 23% of those eligible were ultimately randomized.

    "42": "1. The antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of twice-daily treatment with the 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonist ketanserin were examined in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 7 weeks duration in 56 hypertensive patients. Twenty were untreated, 20 were already taking bendrofluazide 5 mg daily, and 16 were already taking atenolol 100 mg daily. Randomisation was stratified to compare ketanserin with placebo as monotherapy (n = 20), when added to bendrofluazide (n = 20), and when added to atenolol (n = 16). 2. The antihypertensive effect of ketanserin in all patients completing the study (mean daily dose 71 mg) was 10/6 mm Hg supine (P less than 0.01/P less than 0.01) and 6/6 mm Hg standing (NS/P less than 0.01) when blood pressure was measured 2 h after the morning dose. Responses were similar in patients taking ketanserin as monotherapy, in addition to bendrofluazide, and in addition to atenolol, with reductions in mean arterial pressure of 4.6, 7.4 and 8.9 mm Hg respectively. 3. Ketanserin had no antihypertensive effect when measured 14 h after the last dose. The rise in blood pressure between 2 and 14 h after dosing was 11/4 mm Hg supine (P less than 0.01/NS) and 8/5 mm Hg standing (P less than 0.05/P less than 0.05). 4. The antihypertensive response to ketanserin was positively related to initial blood pressure and, independent of this, to age. It was not related to plasma concentrations of ketanserin or ketanserinol. 5.

    "43": "Bevantolol is a new, cardioselective beta-receptor antagonist that undergoes extensive hepatic biotransformation. To evaluate changes in the disposition of bevantolol produced by liver disease, a single 200-mg oral dose of bevantolol was administered in ten patients who had hepatic cirrhosis and to ten age-matched controls. Cirrhotic patients had a greater plasma bevantolol half-life (6.9 +/- 4.0 hr, mean +/- SD) then did patients with normal liver function (2.8 +/- 1.1 hr, P less than .01), and they also had a longer duration of significant bevantolol-induced heart rate slowing (for 12 hours after oral dose in cirrhotics versus three hours for controls). On the other hand, the peak concentration after the oral dose and the magnitude of bradycardiac effect were similar for both groups. Plasma bevantolol half-life was more variable in cirrhotic patients than in controls. Some of this variability among cirrhotics was attributable to age, which was a significant determinant of bevantolol half-life in the cirrhotic (but not in the control) patient sample. These results indicate that hepatic cirrhosis alters the disposition of bevantolol and suggest that modifications in bevantolol dose should be considered when using this drug to treat patients with liver disease.", 
    "44": "It is well known that distinct antihypertensive drugs have a different impact on compliance and on quality of life of patients. Therefore, we must ask under what conditions a refusal of antihypertensive medication can be justified and what its consequences are with regard to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. An aspect of this latter question is answered by a prospective study on cardiovascular risks in a cohort of 416 middle-aged male blue-collar workers followed over three years: In the subgroup of 94 workers with mild or manifest hypertension few aspects of quality of life only were improved in the untreated (54%) as compared to the treated (46%) hypertensives. On the other hand, longterm cardiovascular risk was considerable: every third worker with untreated mild hypertension (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg; n = 30) exhibited signs of early left ventricular hypertrophy, as assessed by one- and two-dimensional echocardiography. The most impressive difference was found with regard to the diameter of left atrium (T = 3.02; p less than .01). The second part of the paper presents first results of a test-statistical evaluation: a German version of a well known measurement approach to quality of life in the United States is applied in 50 hypertensives and 56 normotensives. Internal consistency, stability and discriminant power of the questionnaire were very satisfying. Hypertensives compared to normotensives and treated hypertensives compared to untreated hypertensives showed significant differences on several subscales (esp. \"general wellbeing\", \"vitality\"). Results indicate that this measurement approach can be reliably used in further studies.", 
    "45": "Anti-hypertensive drugs, including diuretics and beta-blocking drugs, belong to a group of therapeutics used by about a fourth of the Danish population. As with cytostatics, antibiotics, and topical remedies, they rather frequently cause adverse drug reactions (ADR) in the skin. No exact statistical information is available concerning the extent of such side effects. The information obtained by Danish National Board of Health's Committee on Adverse Drug Reactions shows that 10-60% of ADR from diuretics, beta-blocking agents, and anti-hypertensive drugs are dermatological. The skin symptoms are not unique for any specific drug. But certain symptoms occur more frequently than others. Thiazides can give vasculitis, a phototoxic/-allergic eruption, erythema multiforme, or eczema. The combination of amiloride (5 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) carries the highest number of recorded ADR; 59% of these are in the skin. Half of the skin ADR are phototoxic eczema. Furosemide may give eczema, purpura, a bullous eruption, or Steven-Johnson's syndrome in rare cases. Methyldopa can induce eczematous eruptions on hands and feet, a lichenoid eruption, a lupus erythematosus-like eruption, or purpura. Hydralazine may give lupus erythematosus-like eruptions, eczema, or urticaria. Non-specific beta-blocking drugs can induce a morbilliform rash and may aggravate psoriasis. Captopril may induce pruritus in up to 15% of the patients and skin eruptions in 2%. The most serious dermatological side effect, exfoliative dermatitis, is very rarely seen following the use of anti-hypertensive drugs or diuretics.", 
    "46": "Failure of the myocardial pump and poor adjustment of the cardiac output to the oxygen needs of the body, cause sympathetic reflexes (tachycardia and muscular, cutaneous, splanchnic and renal vasoconstriction) which concur to increase arterial blood pressure and cardiac output. This sympathetic hyperstimulation during the evolution of cardiac insufficiency results in many myocardial consequences: increase of the post-charge and cardiac work, depletion of the stock of neuromediator (nor-epinephrine) in the nerve endings of the myocardial sympathetic fibers and decrease of the number of beta-adrenergic receptors of the myocardial cell membranes. It is well known, now, that the \"down-regulation\" of beta-receptors involves, at least for a short time, a process of internalization of the receptors when subjected to intense stimulation by agonists receptors. A cell enzyme, the \"beta-adrenergic receptor kinase\" (BARK) causes a phosphorylation of certain sites of the proteins of the beta-receptor when stimulated by agonists. The receptor is then internalized in the cell and fails to be stimulated. It will become functional again and accessible under the membrane under the effect of another enzyme, a phosphatase. These pharmacological findings have led cardiologists to propose a beta-blocking treatment in severe forms (stage IV) of cardiac insufficiency. Biopsies of the myocardium in patients awaiting a heart transplant, have shown recently that under beta-blockers, the number of beta-functional receptors increased and this was interpreted as a response of myocardial cells to the blocking of remaining receptors (equivalent to an up-regulation phenomenon). This mechanism has been advocated to explain the excellent results of the treatment in some patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "47": "In order to study the role of opioid- and betareceptors on exercise-induced catecholamine responses, the effects of acute intravenous administration of 1 and 4 mg naloxone and of the non-selective betablocker timolol 2 mg of on circulating concentrations of adrenalin, noradrenaline and dopamine during exercise to exhaustion were examined in eight normal, healthy young men, using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design. During maximal exercise, adrenalin levels increased from 71 +/- 17 to 821 +/- 235 pg/ml (p less than 0.05), noradrenaline from 355 +/- 58 to 4235 +/- 1031 pg/ml (p less than 0.05), and dopamine from 72 +/- 20 to 178 +/- 44 pg/ml (p less than 0.05). Naloxone did not influence basal or exercise-induced noradrenaline responses. Timolol clearly augmented peak adrenalin concentration at maximal exercise capacity (1543 +/- 510 pg/ml, p less than 0.05). Basal noradrenaline level was increased (546 +/- 86 pg/ml, p less than 0.05), while exercise-induced noradrenaline level was reduced (2954 +/- 594 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) in proportion to the reduction in maximal exercise capacity during timolol treatment. Neither naloxone nor timolol affected dopamine levels. No additive effect was seen with the combination of naloxone and timolol. It is concluded that the opioid peptides are probably not involved in noradrenaline and dopamine responses, whereas betablockers change the catecholamine response to short-term maximal exercise.", 
    "48": "Levobunolol is a potent non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent used for the topical treatment of increased intraocular pressure in patients with chronic open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In comparative studies of up to 2 years' duration levobunolol 0.5 to 1% reduced intraocular pressures by about 30% and adequately controlled intraocular hypertension in 50 to 85% of those treated. These results were significantly superior to those produced by placebo and comparable to the responses achieved with ocular timolol in double-blind controlled trials. Levobunolol has been well tolerated, producing only minor changes in objective and subjective ophthalmic and systemic parameters. Adverse reactions resulted in approximately 5% of patients withdrawing from treatment with levobunolol which was equivalent to that observed with timolol. Thus, ocular levobunolol is a well-tolerated and effective therapy for the management of raised intraocular pressure, and is a suitable alternative to ocular timolol in patients with chronic open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.", 
    "49": "1 The down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors has been postulated as a biochemical marker of antidepressant efficacy. Here we demonstrate that chronic treatment with desipramine down-regulates beta 1-adrenoceptors in rat cerebral cortex and that beta-adrenoceptor subtypes can be independently regulated by treatment with different beta-adrenoceptor agonists. 2 Desipramine, (+/-)-clenbuterol, prenalterol, corwin (20 mg kg-1 daily) and corwin (10 mg kg-1 daily) were administered to male, Sprague-Dawley rats, over eight days, by means of osmotic Alzet pumps placed subcutaneously and removed 24 h before analysis. Control rats received vehicle only. The beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor populations were measured in cerebral cortex by a modified (-)-[125I]-pindolol receptor binding assay. 3 The conventional antidepressant, desipramine, preferentially down-regulated beta 1-adrenoceptors whereas the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist (+/-)-clenbuterol preferentially down-regulated beta 2-adrenoceptors. The beta 1-selective partial agonist, prenalterol, up-regulated beta 1-adrenoceptors perhaps acting more as an antagonist than as an agonist. Finally, neither dose of corwin had any significant effect on beta-adrenoceptor number.", 
    "50": "1 The effects of intraperitoneal administration of antagonists to morphine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), noradrenaline and dopamine have been studied on the antinociceptive effects of electrical stimulation of the anterior pretectal nucleus (APtN) of the rat. 2 A 15 s period of 35 microA sine wave stimulation of APtN significantly increased the latency of the tail flick reflex to noxious heat for periods up to 1 h. 3 Naloxone (0.25-1.0 mg kg-1) attenuated the effects of APtN stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. In rats made tolerant to morphine by daily administration of morphine, the antinociceptive effects of APtN stimulation were significantly reduced. 4 The 5-HT receptor antagonists methysergide (5 mg kg-1) and ketanserin (1 mg kg-1), the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol (1 mg kg-1) and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (1 mg kg-1) had little effect on the antinociceptive effects of stimulating the APtN. 5 alpha-Adrenoceptor antagonists caused a dose-dependent antagonism of the response. The order of potency was; idazoxan greater than prazosin greater than phenoxybenzamine, the respective ED50 for each drug being 0.08: 0.45: 1.5 mg kg-1. 6 It is concluded that antagonism at opioid receptors and alpha-adrenoceptors but not beta-adrenoceptors, dopamine or 5-HT receptors reduces the antinociceptive effects of APtN stimulation. This differs from the reported effects of these antagonists on the antinociception caused by stimulating other sites in the brain.", 
    "51": "The effects of both alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic blocking agents on the vascular perfusion of tumors were studied with the ultimate goal of improving diagnosis and therapy of solid tumors with the use of monoclonal antibody (MAb) conjugates. With the use of a subcutaneously growing murine thymoma, it was demonstrated that nonselective and cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agents were capable of increasing threefold tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-liver perfusion of 125I-labeled MAbs. Subsequently, these beta-adrenergic blocking agents were found to increase the antitumor efficacy of idarubicin (Ida)-MAb conjugates. Conjugate-treated mice that also received beta-adrenergic blocking agents had a smaller mean tumor size and a greater number of regressions than mice receiving Ida-MAb conjugate alone. By contrast, prazosin HCl, an alpha 1-adrenergic blocking agent, and Cyclospasmol, a peripheral vasodilator, did not enhance the tumor perfusion and antitumor efficacy of 125I- or Ida-conjugated MAbs, and no vasoactive agent enhanced the antitumor effect of Ida when used alone. By their selective action on normal blood vessels, vasoactive drugs can change the tumor-to-normal tissue perfusion ratio, thereby enhancing the access of drug-MAb conjugates to tumors and increasing the effectiveness of tumor therapy with the use of drug-MAb conjugates.", 
    "52": "Maximal exercise capacity was measured in 20 nondiabetic patients with end-stage renal disease before and soon after successful renal transplantation. Maximal oxygen consumption increased significantly in all patients posttransplant. Increases in maximal heart rate and heart rates at 70% of maximal levels were also observed. The changes in maximal oxygen consumption were not significantly correlated with changes in hematocrit. The removal of uremia may result in improved functioning of one or more of the systems involved in oxygen transport and utilization that determine exercise capacity.", 
    "53": "Stretching of the atrial wall is a known stimulant for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion. Little is known about other factors that may influence ANP secretion. We examined the effects of the neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system on ANP secretion from isolated rat left atria. Superfusion with 10 muM norepinephrine produced a biphasic rise in ANP secretion with a peak response 2.5-fold above baseline secretion. To determine whether the response to norepinephrine primarily reflected alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation, atria were superfused with 0.1 muM isoproterenol or 10 muM phenylephrine and 1 muM propranolol. ANP secretion in response to isoproterenol was biphasic, similar to the response to norepinephrine. Phenylephrine evoked a monophasic ANP secretory response, which was delayed in onset relative to that of isoproterenol or norepinephrine. Superfusion with 10 muM methacholine alone had no effect on ANP secretion, but rapidly attenuated norepinephrine-stimulated secretion by 67%. From these observations we conclude: (a) Both alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists directly and distinctively stimulate ANP secretion; (b) Norepinephrine stimulates ANP secretion by both alpha- and beta-adrenergic mechanisms, however the secretory response pattern of norepinephrine reflects a predominence of beta-adrenergic activity; (c) Under basal conditions, methacholine does not influence ANP secretion; and (d) Methacholine inhibits norepinephrine-stimulated ANP secretion. Thus, in vivo, activation of the sympathetic nervous system may enhance ANP secretion, whereas a rise in parasympathetic tone may lower ANP secretion.", 
    "54": "Systemic hypertension is a common clinical problem in the elderly. There is emerging evidence to suggest that with careful utilization of antihypertensive drugs, blood pressure can be lowered in the elderly population. Whether isolated systolic hypertension should be treated aggressively remains an unanswered question despite the evidence that systolic hypertension can cause certain cardiovascular complications. An elderly patient with hypertension and concomitant coronary artery disease merits proper blood pressure control with appropriate drugs to prevent progression of coronary disease. The therapeutic objective is not only to lower the blood pressure but to accomplish this goal with drugs which are likely to have a favorable effect on coronary artery disease. Changing trends in the drug therapy of hypertension indicate that calcium antagonists and beta-blocking drugs offer a therapeutic advantage in elderly hypertensive patients with coronary artery diseases.", 
    "55": "(-)125I-Iodocyanopindolol (125ICYP) binding to intact and ultrasonically treated human mononuclear cells (MNC) was studied. Specific binding of 125ICYP defined as the difference in binding in the presence and absence of 2 microM (+/-)-propranolol displayed in intact cells a dissociation constant (Kd) of 11.8 +/- 2.7 pM and a beta-adrenoceptor number (Rt) of 2371 +/- 154 sites/cell. This specific binding, however, still had a complex character. In broken cells a homogeneous class of binding sites with a Kd-value of 6.7 +/- 1.0 pM and a Rt-value of 883 +/- 89 sites/cell was found. When in intact cells nonspecific binding was determined with CGP-12177, a hydrophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, a homogeneous class of binding sites was found with a Kd of 7.0 +/- 0.3 pM and a Rt of 1645 +/- 95 sites/cell. Inhibition curves with (+)-, (-)-, (+/-)-propranolol, timolol and CGP-12177, obtained with ultrasonically treated cells were monophasic. In intact cells propranolol and timolol not only displaced 125ICYP from its specific sites, but in an almost monophasic way also from nonspecific binding sites. CGP-12177, however, showed a clear plateau. It is concluded that in broken MNC a loss of binding sites may occur, whereas in intact cells additional binding interferes with the correct determination of specific 125ICYP binding. The latter can be reduced to a minimum by using hydrophylic ligands such as CGP-12177 to measure nonspecific binding.", 
    "56": "The effects of a newly synthesized compound, 2-[(5-chloro-2-methoxyphenyl)azo]-1H-imidazole (M6434) on alpha-adrenergic receptors were investigated by using the atria of normal and hypothyroid rats, rat vasa deferentia and canine arteries. M6434 showed a positive inotropic effect on rat left atria, which was suppressed by phentolamine but not by propranolol and reserpine. M6434 also showed a positive chronotropic effect on rat right atria. These positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of M6434 were enhanced in propylthiouracil-induced hypothyroid rats. M6434 caused contraction of rat vas deferens and increased its spontaneous movement. These effects on vas deferens were suppressed by phentolamine. M6434 induced contraction of canine arteries. The pD2 values for vasoconstrictive effects of M6434 on the aorta, pulmonary artery, renal artery and femoral artery were about equal to those of phenylephrine, and the intrinsic activity of M6434 was somewhat lower than that of phenylephrine. These results suggest that M6434 is an adrenergic alpha-agonist which is about as potent as phenylephrine and that M6434 has neither a beta-stimulating activity nor a catecholamine-releasing one.", 
    "57": "To determine the nature of the resultant effect on blood pressure when angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are combined with other hypotensive agents in the treatment of uncomplicated essential hypertension, two randomized, double-blind, crossover trials were conducted. In each trial there were four treatment phases, each 4 weeks in duration, comprising a 2 X 2 factorial experiment. Twenty-one patients completed the first study in which the effects of enalapril (10 mg twice daily) were compared with hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg twice daily), with the two drugs in combination and with placebo. All blood pressure parameters were reduced in the three active treatment phases compared with placebo (P less than 0.001). Enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide were equally effective and in combination their hypotensive effects were fully additive. Sixteen patients completed the second study which compared the effects of enalapril (20 mg daily), atenolol (50 mg daily), the two drugs in combination and placebo. All blood pressure parameters were again reduced in all phases compared with placebo (P less than 0.001). Enalapril and atenolol were also equally effective, but in combination their hypotensive effects were less than fully additive, with attenuation of the potential additive response by 30-50%. These results indicate that a diuretic-ACE inhibitor combination can be expected to have a greater hypotensive effect than a beta-blocker-ACE inhibitor combination. Both hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol increased plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations (P less than 0.01), suggesting that ANP could contribute to the hypotensive effects of these two drug classes.", 
    "58": "Groups of male rats were injected phentolamine, prazosin or yohimbine and infused with saline or adrenaline for 4 h under pentobarbital anesthesia. Blood samples were taken at 30 min intervals during the infusion, the isovolemia being maintained by replacing the blood volume with the blood obtained from normal donor animals. Plasma glucose and insulin levels were estimated. In saline infused animals a severalfold increase in plasma insulin levels was found after pretreatment with phentolamine, while such increase after prazosin or yohimbine was much less, though significant. In adrenaline infused animals the increased insulinemia after phentolamine pretreatment was still more remarkable than in those infused saline. After prazosin treatment, however, no changes in insulinemia were found during adrenaline infusion, while yohimbine pretreatment resulted in a significant insulin increase in similarly infused rats. It is concluded that alpha 2-receptors apparently play a major role in mediating inhibitory effects of adrenaline on insulin secretion. However, even some participation of alpha 1-receptors in the complex regulation of insulin secretion in vivo cannot be excluded, since the effect of phentolamine pretreatment on either basal or adrenaline induced insulinemia was higher than that of yohimbine, though a higher molar dose of the latter was used. In addition, no changes in insulinemia were found during the infusion of adrenaline only which may be explained by a prevailing effect of inhibitory alpha-adrenoceptor tone over a stimulatory beta-adrenoceptor tone under the conditions of unblocked adrenoceptors.", 
    "59": "beta-Endorphin was infused bilaterally into the medial preoptic area-anterior hypothalamic continuum at doses of 5, 10 and 40 pmol each side. The highest dose selectively abolished mounting, intromitting and ejaculating in sexually experienced male rats paired with an oestrous female. Males infused with 40 pmol beta-endorphin still followed the female, investigated her anogenital region and other parts of her body, but made abortive attempts to mount. A dose of 5 pmol beta-endorphin had no effect, but 10 pmol proved partially effective. The same males, in other tests, were allowed to ingest a highly preferred, sweet, non-calorific solution (acesulfame-K) in the absence of a female. beta-Endorphin infusions (up to 40 pmol) into the same area of the hypothalamus had no effect on this behaviour. Control males allowed simultaneous access both to an oestrous female and to the sweet solution copulated normally but reduced their ingestive behaviour, despite there being sufficient time during tests for both to occur. beta-Endorphin (40 pmol) infused into the preoptic area-anterior hypothalamic continuum under these conditions suppressed sexual interaction, but ingestion of acesulfame-K increased to values observed when the female was absent. beta-Endorphin infused into neighbouring areas of the brain had different behavioural effects. Sexual behaviour was not inhibited, and ingestion of acesulfame-K was unaltered, when beta-endorphin was infused either into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis or the rostral ventromedial hypothalamus. However, infusions of cholecystokinin-8 into the ventromedial hypothalamus suppressed acesulfame-K ingestion in most animals, showing that the cannulae were placed in an area regulating ingestive behaviour. The inhibition of sexual behaviour after preoptic area-anterior hypothalamic continuum infusions of beta-endorphin was prevented by either pretreating rats with 1 mg/kg naloxone intraperitoneally, or by infusing a putative delta opiate receptor blocker (0.5 pmols ICI 174864) into the preoptic area-anterior hypothalamic continuum 5 min prior to beta-endorphin treatment. ICI 174864 administered alone significantly increased mount rate and reduced the post-ejaculatory refractory period in copulating males. These experiments suggest that there is both neurochemical and neuroanatomical specificity relating beta-endorphin to sexual behaviour in the male rat.", 
    "60": "Beta-Adrenergic receptors from basal membranes of human placenta were purified from digitonin extracts by sequential rounds of affinity chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography and steric-exclusion h.p.l.c. Basal membranes display both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors, in the ratio 65:35. Affinity chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography on heptylamine-Sepharose and ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel removed most of the contaminating proteins, and final purification of the receptor to apparent homogeneity was achieved by steric-exclusion h.p.l.c. The purified receptors showed Mr 67000 on SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Specific binding of radioligand to the purified beta-adrenergic receptors displayed stereoselectivity, and the agonist competition profiles demonstrated the presence of both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors. By using the subtype-selective ligands CGP-20712A (beta 1-selective) and ICI-118,551 (beta 2-selective), the purified Mr-67000 species was shown to be composed of equivalent amounts of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Affinity chromatography on Sepharose-alprenolol and sequential elution with 1 microM-CGP-20712A followed by 100 microM(-)-alprenolol permitted beta 1-adrenergic receptors to be resolved from the mixture of beta 1-/beta 2-adrenergic receptors. The pharmacologically distinct human beta 1 and beta 2-adrenergic receptors are shown to be structurally very similar peptides.", 
    "61": "We studied beta-adrenergic receptor binding, using 125I-cyanopindolol as the ligand, in the leukocyte membranes of depressed patients, schizophrenic patients, and normal control subjects during a drug-free period. We also determined plasma cortisol levels and dexamethasone suppression in these subjects. The maximum number of beta-adrenergic receptor sites (Bmax) was significantly lower in depressed patients than in normal control subjects. Nonsuppressors on the dexamethasone suppression test tended to have a decreased Bmax in comparison to suppressors. There was no significant difference in the Kd between any of the groups. These results indicate that decreased beta-adrenergic receptor responsiveness in the leukocytes of depressed patients is probably due to a decrease in the number of beta-adrenergic receptor sites.", 
    "62": "Experimental and clinical evidence indicates that cardiac hypertrophy in systemic hypertension may not simply result from the mechanical stress of increased afterload. Several lines of evidence suggest that sympathetic nervous influence stimulates cardiac growth. A previous study indicated that sympathetic tone may be important in the two-kidney, one-clip model of renovascular hypertension. Hence, we investigated the role of cardiac beta-receptors by testing the effects of the cardioselective beta-receptor blocker, atenolol, on regression and prevention of ventricular hypertrophy in this model. Renal hypertensive rats were assigned to a 'prevention' and a 'reversal' protocol, receiving the drug before or after the development of hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. Untreated control animals developed severe hypertension (205 +/- 9 mmHg) and marked cardiac hypertrophy (heart weight/body weight ratio: 3.86 +/- 0.23 mg/g) when compared to sham-operated controls (129 +/- 1 mmHg and 2.38 +/- 0.06 mg/g, respectively). Atenolol (440 mg/kg per day) failed to prevent or reverse hypertension (213 +/- 5 and 194 +/- 11 mmHg) or cardiac hypertrophy (4.10 +/- 0.39 and 3.51 +/- 0.25 mg/g, respectively). Effective beta-blockade was verified by significantly lower heart rates in treated animals (382 +/- 10 and 368 +/- 9 beats/min, respectively) than untreated controls (486 +/- 28 beats/min; P less than 0.01). Similarly, plasma renin activity returned to baseline in atenolol-treated animals. Cardiac catecholamines were markedly decreased in hypertrophied hearts (significant only for norepinephrine) and remained unaffected by atenolol treatment. However, both the prevention and reversal protocol strikingly reduced mortality in hypertensive animals (0 and 14%, respectively, versus 57%; P less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Output of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from guinea pig ileal strips was detected by radioimmunoassay and the effect of adenosine and adenosine nucleotides on PGE2 output investigated in vitro. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and alpha, beta-methylene ATP, as well as adenosine, stimulate the output of PGE2 in a concentration dependent-manner. Potency of these compounds is in the order of alpha, beta-methylene ATP greater than ATP greater than adenosine. The effect of ATP was totally blocked by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. Actions of these adenylyl compounds were attenuated by apamin, an antagonist of postjunctional P2-purinoceptor-mediated activity. Effectiveness of these compounds was not modified by 8-phenyltheophylline, a P1-purinoceptor antagonist, and it was not obtained in the isolated synaptosomal preparations. In addition, effects of adenosine and adenosine nucleotides were augmented only slightly by dipyridamole, a blocker of adenosine uptake. These findings suggest that the formation of PGE2 is stimulated in muscle cells, through the postjunctional P2-purinoceptor, taking an active role in the purinergic neurotransmission of guinea pig gut.", 
    "64": "Dopamine (DA) i.v. infused in a low dose (0.1 microgram/kg/min) in healthy women during sustained hypotonic polyuria, produced different renal functional effects as variations in extracellular fluid volume occurred. (1) In hydro-saline retention (n = 23), induced by desoxycorticosterone acetate treatment, DA produced typical vasodilator and hydro-natriuretic effects (Goldberg, 1972). (2) In hydro-saline depletion (n = 19), induced by diuretic treatment and low dietary sodium intake, DA lost its vasodilator and natriuretic efficacy, manifesting, on the other hand, renal sodium conserving effects mainly dependent on the increase in distal sodium reabsorption and a trend towards afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. (3) Treatment with prazosin (n = 9) or propranolol (n = 9) in hydro-saline depletion, was efficacious in partly restoring the typical vasodilator and natriuretic effects of DA. Thus, in hydro-saline depletion, DA produced sympathomimetic effects which were sufficiently intense to outweigh those due to activation of specific DA renal receptors.", 
    "65": "The intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, 1 micrograms) and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha, 10 micrograms) produced prolonged pressor and tachycardiac responses in chloralose-anaesthetised cats. Phenoxybenzamine-pretreatment completely prevented the pressor response without altering the tachycardiac response, whereas propranolol intervention completely inhibited the tachycardiac response and also attenuated the pressor response. The pretreatment with pentolinium completely antagonised both the pressor and tachycardiac responses to i.c.v. PGE2 and PGF2 alpha. The results suggest that the centrally administered PGE2 and PGF2 alpha augment sympathetic outflow to the heart and vascular system and thereby cause excitatory cardiovascular responses in anaesthetised cats.", 
    "66": "1 Transmural electrical stimulation (10 Hz, 40 V, 1 ms for 60s) increased total catecholamine secretion from perfused cat adrenal glands; this response was enhanced by neostigmine and inhibited by mecamylamine, suggesting that release of acetylcholine from splanchnic nerve terminals was stimulating nicotinic receptors and enhancing catecholamine secretion. 2 Isoprenaline, (-)-propranolol and (+)-propranolol (10(-7)-10(-5)M) inhibited the electrically-evoked secretory response by 40-70%; similar reductions were obtained with clonidine and yohimbine. Neither, (+)-propranolol nor (-)-propranolol inhibited K-evoked secretion from cat adrenals; in contrast, nimodipine potently inhibited it (IC50 = 24 nM). 3 Either, racemic propranolol or the (+)- or (-)-isomers (1-10 microM) equally inhibited [3H]-noradrenaline release evoked by nicotine or acetylcholine from cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells; clonidine (10 microM) inhibited secretion by 50% and yohimbine or isoprenaline did not affect it. 4 The results indicate that adrenomedullary catecholamine release evoked by splanchnic nerve stimulation is not modulated by alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors and suggest that propranolol may inhibit secretion by blocking ion fluxes through the acetylcholine receptor ionophore. Clonidine may inhibit secretion by this same mechanism, and/or by interfering with some intracellular event in the secretory mechanism.", 
    "67": "The influence of acidosis on the inotropic effect of isoproterenol was studied in the isolated arterially perfused heart of the newborn rabbits. Baseline mechanical function during acidosis (pH 6.8) was not different from control (pH 7.4). However, the inotropic effect of isoproterenol was significantly suppressed in the acidotic muscles. The increment of myocardial adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) content during isoproterenol infusion was also reduced in acidosis. Inotropic effects of Ca and dibutyryl cAMP in the acidotic muscles were not significantly different from those in the control muscles. beta-Receptor number and affinity in the respiratory acidotic muscle was similar to those in the control muscle. Effects of pH on myocardial beta-receptor and adenylate cyclase activity were further determined in the membrane fraction by changing the pH of the reaction medium from 7.4 (control) to 6.8 or 6.0. beta-Receptor numbers were significantly decreased at pH 6.0 but not at pH 6.8. Adenylate cyclase activity was depressed at pH 6.8 and 6.0. These data suggest that the inotropic effect of isoproterenol is diminished in the acidotic muscle. This may be due to the decreased activation of cAMP production, which in turn most likely results from depressed adenylate cyclase activity.", 
    "68": "The ability of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) to affect plasma glucose levels and insulin release was assessed in rats bearing chronic jugular catheters. The i.v. administration of 8-OH-DPAT (150 micrograms/kg) rapidly promoted a transient hyperglycemia. Despite high glucose levels, insulinemia remained constant. Dose-response curves revealed that maximal hyperglycemia was associated with hypoinsulinemia. Increased glycemia, which was also found to be induced by other 5-HT direct and indirect agonists, lasted longer in food-deprived rats. Evidence for a strong inhibitory effect of 8-OH-DPAT on insulin release was reported in rats submitted to i.v. glucose tolerance tests. Pretreatments with the dopaminergic blocker haloperidol, the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin or the 5-HT2 blocker ketanserin were ineffective. In contrast, the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan and the unspecific 5-HT antagonist methiotepin prevented the hyperglycemic and the hypoinsulinemic effects of 8-OH-DPAT. Blockade of these changes by (-)-propranolol (a 5-HT1 blocker), but not by (+)-propranolol, indicated that 5-HT1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors mediated 8-OH-DPAT-induced hyperglycemia. Reserpine pretreatment did not prevent the effects of 8-OH-DPAT. Central injection of 8-OH-DPAT induced hyperglycemia, the amplitude of which was equivalent to that measured after i.v. administration. Selective degeneration of serotonergic nerve cells by 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine did not prevent 8-OH-DPAT-induced alterations, thus rendering a key role for presynaptic mechanisms unlikely.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "The aim of the study was to investigate beta adrenoceptor modulation of norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves in rat isolated kidney. After preincubation with [3H]norepinephrine, the renal nerves were stimulated at 1 Hz. The stimulation induced (S-I) outflow of radioactivity was taken as an index of norepinephrine release. Isoproterenol (0.1 microM) enhanced the S-I outflow of radioactivity. This effect was abolished by the beta-2 adrenoceptor blocking drug ICI 118551 (0.1 microM) but unaltered by the beta-1 adrenoceptor blocking drug atenolol (0.3 microM). In the presence of a high concentration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (5 microM), isoproterenol failed to enhance the S-I outflow of radioactivity. However, a lower concentration of captopril (0.1 microM), which totally abolished the facilitatory effect of angiotensin I (0.1 microM) on the S-I outflow of radioactivity, failed to alter the facilitatory effect of isoproterenol. Angiotensin II (0.03 microM) enhanced markedly the S-I outflow of radioactivity and in the presence of the angiotensin II receptor blocking drug saralasin (0.1 microM) this facilitatory effect was reduced markedly. Saralasin did not alter the facilitatory effect of isoproterenol. These results suggest that stimulation of prejunctional beta-2 adrenoceptors on renal sympathetic nerve endings enhances norepinephrine release. This effect is independent of local angiotensin II production and does not involve activation of prejunctional angiotensin II receptors within the rat kidney. However, the inhibitory effect of a high concentration of captopril (5.0 microM) on beta-2 adrenoceptor-mediated facilitation of norepinephrine release remains to be clarified.", 
    "70": "The binding of monoiodinated cyanopindolol (ICYP) to membranes from canine and rat aortas, mesenteric arteries and mesenteric nerves has been studied. Binding of ICYP was shown by differential centrifugation and sucrose gradient purification as well as digitonin treatment to be directly related to the content of arterial muscle plasma membrane assessed by marker enzymes. The Kd values obtained were all in the range of 10 to 30 pM but maximum binding site (Bmax) values varied depending upon the extent of contamination by nonplasmalemmal membranes. The more purified plasma membrane fractions have Bmax many times higher than those reported in the literature. Although purified membrane fractions all had ICYP binding characterized by a single binding site with similar Kd values, binding to some crude fractions was complex. In addition, plasma membranes for mesenteric nerves, removed carefully by dissection in our study, were shown to contain ICYP binding sites with a similar Kd and Bmax values to those in arterial muscle membrane. Using arterial muscle purified membranes after removal of nerves by dissection, Bmax values from mesenteric arteries were demonstrated to be much larger than those from aorta in both species. Although the necessity of purifying the membranes depends on the objectives of a given experiment, our result strongly suggest that measurement of changes in receptor densities requires an analytical approach which provides plasma membrane-enriched fractions derived from a single cell type and purified to a known and comparable degree, especially when changes in density related to experimental or disease processes are being investigated.", 
    "71": "Afterhyperpolarizations and outward tail currents of rat dorsal raphe neurons were measured by intracellular recording and single-electrode voltage clamping in the brain slice preparation. The alpha 1-agonist phenylephrine, and (in the presence of propranolol) norepinephrine, elicited an increase in the duration, but not of the initial amplitude, of afterhyperpolarizations and associated outward tail currents which followed depolarizing pulses. These effects were antagonized by prazosin, indicating that they were mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptors. The outward tail currents were sensitive to apamin, a blocker of certain Ca2+-activated K+ currents. A prolongation of afterhyperpolarizations would offset the major excitatory alpha 1 effects, which were associated with suppression of resting K+ currents and of the A-current. Since polyphosphoinositide metabolites have been reported to be second messengers for Ca2+-dependent receptor actions, we compared their effects with those of alpha 1-receptor stimulation on these cells. Intracellular ejection of the putative second messenger myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate from the recording electrode transiently mimicked the actions of alpha 1-agonists on the afterhyperpolarization. Superfusion with 1 mM LiCl, simulating therapeutic levels of lithium, had no effect on the rate of recovery from inositol trisphosphate ejection. Superfusion with water-soluble phorbol esters (which mimic actions of another phosphoinositide metabolite, 1,2-diacylglycerol) suppressed rather than mimicked the activation of raphe cell firing by phenylephrine; this occurred with a rank-order potency consistent with activation of protein kinase C and was associated with suppression of a slow inward current and of the outward tail current. Our results suggest that phosphoinositide turnover is more likely to mediate modulatory or negative-feedback effects of alpha 1-adrenoceptors than to mediate the major excitatory effects.", 
    "72": "It has been previously shown that beta-adrenergic agonists stimulate growth hormone (GH) release from perifused rat anterior pituitary cell aggregates cultured in serum-free defined medium for 5-6 days. The present data show that the natural beta-agonist epinephrine (EPI) stimulates GH release through an additional alpha-adrenergic mechanism. The involvement of this mechanism was suggested by the following findings. The intrinsic activity of EPI, at concentrations greater than 10 nM, was significantly higher than that of isoproterenol (ISO) in stimulating GH release. Phenylephrine (PHE), a specific agonist of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, provoked a significant rise of GH release. The effect was concentration dependent between 100 nM and 10 microM. The stimulatory effect of EPI and PHE was lowered, respectively blocked, by low concentrations of the potent alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin. The EPI-induced GH release could be totally blocked only by administration of both alpha- and beta-receptor antagonists. Under the same conditions and using concentrations up to 1 microM, the alpha 2-agonist clonidine had no or only a slight stimulatory effect; dopamine had no effect. Administration of both PHE and ISO resulted in a more than additive stimulation of GH release. The effectiveness of PHE but not clonidine, together with the high potency of the alpha 1-blocker prazosin suggest that the alpha-adrenergic receptor is predominantly of the alpha 1-subtype. When tested on days 1, 3, 6 and 8 in culture, both alpha- and beta-adrenergic responses appeared to be higher in the presence of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone compared to the responses in the absence of dexamethasone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "73": "The time course and concentration-effect relationship of terbutaline-induced hypokalemia was studied, using computer-aided pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling. Subsequently we investigated the efficacy of oxprenolol in antagonizing such hypokalemia, together with the pharmacokinetic interaction between both drugs. Six healthy subjects were given a 0.5 mg subcutaneous dose of terbutaline on two occasions: 1 hour after oral administration of a placebo and 1 hour after 80 mg oxprenolol orally. In the 7-hour period after terbutaline administration, plasma samples were taken for determination of plasma potassium levels and drug concentrations. The sigmoid Emax model offered a good description of the relation between terbutaline concentrations and potassium effects. Oxprenolol caused decreases of 65% and 56% of terbutaline volume of distribution and clearance, respectively, and an increase of 130% of its AUC. In spite of higher terbutaline concentrations after oxprenolol pretreatment, the hypokalemia was almost completely antagonized by the beta 2-blocking action.", 
    "74": "The effects of halothane on beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist interaction were studied using the membranes of human lymphocytes as a model. Membrane preparations of lymphocytes were obtained from blood samples withdrawn from seven healthy young volunteers. Beta-receptor studies were performed using (-)125I iodocyanopindolol (125ICP) binding. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of (-)isoproterenol. Beta-receptor density (Bmax) and the dissociation constant (KD) for 125ICP were determined from saturation curves. Beta-receptor affinity for agonists evaluated by the IC50 (the concentration of isoproterenol required to inhibit 50% of specific 125ICP binding) and the dissociation constant (KL) for isoproterenol was established from competition curves. The effect of halothane 1%, in an air oxygen mixture (oxygen fraction: 0.3) administered by tonometry during ligand membrane incubation, on beta-adrenergic receptor, was compared to that of control experiments not exposed to halothane. Halothane produced a moderate but significant decrease of Bmax (-10%) and a significant increase in non-specific binding (+30%), while KD, IC50, and KL were unchanged. The authors conclude that halothane, in vitro, decreases beta-adrenergic receptor density. This effect could be mediated by an alteration of the receptor in the membrane due to action of halothane on the lipid phase of the membrane.", 
    "75": "In primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells, protein kinase C (PKC) translocation and activation can be triggered by the stimulation of excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter receptors. Glutamate evokes a dose-related translocation of 4-beta-[3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ([3H]-P(BtO)2) binding sites from the cytosol to the neuronal membrane and stimulates the incorporation of 32P into a number of membrane proteins, particularly protein bands in the range of 80, 50, and 40 kDa. The glutamate-evoked PKC translocation is Mg2+ sensitive, is prevented by 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate and phencyclidine, is not inhibited by nitrendipine (a voltage-dependent Ca2+-channel blocker) but is abolished by the removal of Ca2+ from the incubation medium, suggesting that glutamate-mediated Ca2+ influx is operative in the redistribution of PKC. Exposure of granule cells to the gangliosides trisialosylgangliotetraglycosylceramide (GT1b) or monosialosylgangliotetraglycosylceramide (GM1) inhibits the translocation and activation of PKC evoked by glutamate. These glycosphingolipids fail to interfere with glutamate binding to its high-affinity recognition site or with the [3H]P(BtO)2 binding, nor do they affect the Ca2+ influx. These gangliosides may prevent PKC translocation by interfering with the PKC binding to the neuronal membrane phosphatidylserine.", 
    "76": "Intraventricular injection of neuropeptide Y (NPY) stimulates LH release in estradiol benzoate- and progesterone-primed (EBP) ovariectomized rats. Because adrenergic neurotransmitters, norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E), show intraneuronal coexistence with NPY in certain brain regions of the rat and there are similarities in the effects of NPY and NE/E on LH release, we investigated the possible interaction of NPY and adrenergic receptor systems in the stimulation of LH release in EBP-treated ovariectomized rats. The experiments were designed to determine whether NPY exerted its effects via adrenergic receptors and whether combined administrations of NPY and NE can act synergistically or in an additive manner to enhance the LH release response. Permanent stainless steel cannulae were placed in the third ventricle of the brain, and the rats were ovariectomized. Two weeks after surgery, rats were injected with EB (30 micrograms/rat) and P (15 mg/rat). Two days later, the effects of either vehicle alone (control) or various adrenergic and dopaminergic receptor antagonists and an opiate receptor agonist on stimulation of LH release by NPY were assessed. Intraventricular injection of 0.47 nmol NPY increased plasma LH levels at 10, 20, and 30 min in control rats. The NPY-induced LH response was not blocked by pretreatment with any of the following drugs: the alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist phenoxybenzamine, the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin, beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol, the dopamine receptor antagonist pimozide, or the opiate receptor agonist morphine. All of these drugs affect LH release in other circumstances. On the other hand, the alpha 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist yohimbine significantly attenuated the NPY-induced LH increments. In the second study dealing with the possible synergistic or additive interactions between NPY and NE, we observed that when doses of NPY and NE that separately were only minimally effective in stimulating LH release were administered together, the amounts of LH secreted were greater than the sum of the individual responses. However, when NE and NPY were given together in doses that alone had either no stimulatory or maximal stimulatory effects, there were no additive or synergistic effects on LH release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "77": "Previous studies have suggested that thyroid hormones influence the number of membrane-bound cardiac adrenoceptors, but their effect on the intracellular distribution of adrenoceptors has not been examined. A plasma cell membrane and a vesicular fraction devoid of membrane markers were prepared from hearts of euthyroid and hyperthyroid rats and were used to compare beta- and alpha-adrenoceptors. During daily injection of l-thyroxine, cardiac hypertrophy developed within 4 days and remained unchanged thereafter. The number of membrane-bound beta-receptors increased progressively and plateaued within 2 weeks of thyroxine administration. Vesicular beta-receptors, on the other hand, increased more gradually and to a lesser extent so that after 2 weeks of l-thyroxine injection, they constituted a smaller proportion of the total beta-receptor population compared to normal rats. In contrast, the number of cardiac alpha 1-adrenoceptors declined rapidly to about 80% of that in euthyroid animals and did not change further for the duration of the study. Membrane-bound and vesicular alpha 1-adrenoceptors were affected to the same extent in hyperthyroidism. During regression of cardiac hypertrophy following cessation of thyroxine administration, alpha 1-adrenoceptors rose rapidly (within 2 days) to normal values while beta-receptors declined more gradually to normal levels within 2 weeks. In hypothyroid rats, there was a significant decline in the density of both alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors, with a shift away from the vesicular fraction. These results indicate that both the total numbers of cardiac adrenoceptors and their distribution between the plasma membrane and vesicular fraction are influenced by the thyroid status.", 
    "78": "We examined the chronotropic and sympathoadrenal responses to a strenuous exercise in eight normal subjects receiving placebo and carteolol, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker. Plasma catecholamines were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). Mean plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) concentrations attained at 0.5 and 2 min after exercise were significantly (p less than 0.001-0.05) greater in the carteolol trial than in the placebo trial and approached concentrations fairly similar to preexercise baseline values by 15 min after cessation of exercise in the two trials. The postexercise plasma NE and E concentration-chronotropic response relationships were shifted to the right in the carteolol as compared with the placebo phase. The maximal postexercise NE concentrations measured during the placebo trial correlated significantly with beta-adrenoceptor blockade (p less than 0.05, r = 0.74), whereas the relationship between E concentrations and beta-adrenoceptor blockade did not reach significant level in this small group of study subjects. The results suggest that beta-adrenoceptor blockade increases plasma concentrations of both NE and E during an earlier postexercise period and may cause a greater reflex sympathetic activation as compared with the adrenal response. However, the mechanism(s) remains unclear. Whether the exercise-induced NE rather than E would participate more predominantly in the chronotropic response to beta-adrenoceptor blockade requires further studies.", 
    "79": "The effect of ketanserin and propranolol on the serum total cholesterol (TC), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) cholesterol was studied in hypertensive patients treated for 3 months. During ketanserin administration, LDL-C decreased, whereas HDL-C and the HDL-C/LDL-C ratio increased and no significant effect in serum total cholesterol occurred. During propranolol administration, no significant effect was observed on serum total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C, but the ratio of HDL-C/LDL-C increased. Intergroup comparison showed a greater increase in HDL-C (p less than 0.05) and in the HDL-C/LDL-C ratio (p less than 0.01) in the ketanserin group as compared with the propranolol group.", 
    "80": "This study describes the effects of beta-receptor blockade on systemic hemodynamics and regional blood flows during acute ischemic heart failure in dogs. Depression of left ventricular (LV) function was induced by embolization of the left main coronary artery and was evidenced by a significant increase in LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and decrease in LV dP/dtmax and in cardiac output. Measurements of femoral, renal, mesenteric, and carotid blood flows showed a redistribution of cardiac output during failure. Femoral blood flow decreased to a greater extent than did cardiac output, carotid blood flow decreased in proportion to cardiac output, whereas mesenteric and renal blood flows were moderately reduced in relation to the decrease in cardiac output. Administration of 0.125 mg of propranolol intravenously (i.v.) significantly decreased the performance of the failing left ventricle. Reductions in cardiac output were accompanied by reductions in the peripheral circulations. The decrease in flow was evenly distributed in the femoral, mesenteric, and carotid vascular beds, while there was a relative preservation of renal blood flow. When the dose of propranolol was increased to 0.5 mg/kg, there were no further significant hemodynamic alterations.", 
    "81": "1. Voltage-clamp recordings were made from cultured AtT-20 pituitary cells using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Cells were perfused internally with Cs+ to block K+ currents and bathed externally with either 1 microM tetrodotoxin or with tetraethylammonium (TEA) as a Na+ substitute to block voltage-activated Na+ currents. 2. Depolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of -80 mV to potentials positive to -30 mV evoked two currents: a fast inward current that activated between -30 and +70 mV and a slowly activating current (designated \"slow step current\") that was inward between -30 and near 0 mV (the Cl- equilibrium potential) and outward positive to about 0 mV. Repolarization to -80 mV revealed a slowly decaying, inward tail current, whose magnitude with respect to step potential closely matched the current-voltage relationship of the voltage-activated Ca2+ current. 3. Activation of the fast inward current, slow step current, and tail current, was prevented by extracellular application of Cd2+ or removal of extracellular Ca2+. Replacement of extracellular Ca2+ with Ba2+ potentiated the fast inward current but blocked the slow step and tail currents. Intracellular perfusion with greater than 1 mM of the Ca2+ chelators ethyleneglycol-bis(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) or [1,2-bis(2)aminophenoxy]ethane N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) prevented activation of the slow step and tail currents, but not the fast inward current. 4. The reversal potential of the slow inward current was sensitive to changes in the Cl- equilibrium potential but not to substitution of TEA for Na+. The slow step current, but not the fast inward current, was partially blocked by the Cl- channel blocker, 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid. 5. These data indicate that both the slow inward tail current and the slowly activating, reversible step current were a Ca2+-dependent Cl- current, similar to that described in other neuronal and nonneuronal cell types. The fast inward current was a voltage-activated Ca2+ current, described previously in these and other cells. 6. In the absence of intracellular EGTA, the tail current decayed with complex kinetics, its time course apparently dependent on the magnitude of the voltage-activated Ca2+ current. In the presence of 200 microM intracellular EGTA, the tail current decayed significantly faster and often decayed exponentially."
