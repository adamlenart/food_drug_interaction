    "0": "A randomized double-blind trial comparing the alpha-adrenergic blocker doxazosin and the beta-adrenergic blocker atenolol was completed by 131 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Blood pressure and fasting blood lipids were determined at baseline and 4, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment. At entry, plasma lipids and lipoproteins were similar in those patients randomized to doxazosin or atenolol. After 24 weeks of treatment with atenolol, there were significant (P < .05) decreases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and increases in triglycerides and very-low-density triglycerides (VLDL-T). In contrast, doxazosin was associated with significant (P < .05) increases in HDL-C and decreases in triglycerides and VLDL-T. There were no significant differences in HDL apolipoprotein (apo) A-I or low-density lipoprotein apoB between the drugs, but atenolol decreased the ratio of HDL-C to apoA-I, and doxazosin increased this ratio, differences that were statistically significant (P < .002). Neither apoA-I nor apoB concentration at baseline nor apoE phenotype was predictive of the lipid responses during antihypertensive treatment with either drug. Thus, there are significant favorable changes in HDL-C, total triglycerides, and VLDL-T between patients with mild to moderate hypertension and normal plasma lipids when treated with the alpha-blocker doxazosin compared with the beta-blocker atenolol. Plasma lipid or apo concentrations were not predictive of their lipid response during antihypertensive therapy with either of these agents.", 
    "1": "Liver microcirculation in cirrhosis is characterized by development of intrahepatic shunts and capillarization of sinusoids secondary to cell necrosis and deposition of new collagen, resulting in both decreased drug elimination and increased vascular resistance with portal hypertension. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of increased portal blood flow on hepatic microcirculation and drug elimination in 13 perfused livers from cirrhotic rats.", 
    "2": "Intrahepatic resistance was assessed under basal conditions (21.2 +/- 0.3 mL/min) and 1 hour after doubling the flow (41.6 +/- 1.0 mL/min). A multiple indicator dilution technique was used at both flow rates to measure sinusoidal volume, albumin and sucrose extravascular volumes, and cellular water volume. Hepatic elimination of labeled taurocholate and propranolol was also measured, and the recovery of 15-microns microspheres was used to evaluate large intrahepatic shunts.", 
    "3": "After doubling the flow, intrahepatic resistance decreased by 31%. Sinusoidal and extravascular volume increased significantly without a change in microsphere recovery. However, there was a marked increase in taurocholate and propranolol elimination by cirrhotic livers. Moreover, during high flow, significant correlations were found between changes in albumin extravascular volume and taurocholate and propranolol elimination.", 
    "4": "Increased portal blood flow in cirrhotic rats induces a decrease in intrahepatic resistance without changes in intrahepatic shunting and improves drug elimination by the liver without deleterious effects on hepatocyte viability.", 
    "5": "Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), such as imipramine, are well-accepted for the treatment of urinary incontinence and enuresis, but their mechanism of action remains undefined due to their multiple pharmacological actions. To explore only the contribution imparted by sympathomimetic effects on the urethra by norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibition, two selective NE reuptake inhibitors (nisoxetine and tomoxetine) that possess no antimuscarinic or serotonergic properties were examined for their effects on sympathetic hypogastric nerve (HgN) evoked urethral contractions in chloralose anesthetized cats. Under control conditions, HgN stimulation produced a biphasic response composed of a consistent initial contraction that was prazosin- (alpha adrenergic antagonist) sensitive, followed by a more variable relaxation that was propranolol- (beta adrenergic antagonist) sensitive. Unexpectedly, nisoxetine (0.03 to 1.0 mg./kg. intravenously, n = 6) and tomoxetine (0.3 to 3 mg./kg. intravenously, n = 3) produced decreases (about 50% to 60% of control) in HgN-evoked contractions. These inhibitory effects of the reuptake inhibitors were reversed by propranolol. In cats that were pretreated with propranolol, nisoxetine produced a significant increase in HgN-evoked contractions. In conclusion, these results indicate that inhibition of NE reuptake into the sympathetic nerve terminal produces a relative increase in the activation of beta adrenergic receptors compared with alpha adrenergic receptors in the urethra. This increased beta receptor stimulation might be due to a greater diffusion of NE away from the neuro-effector junction to extrajunctional sites following blockade of junctional reuptake. These findings should highlight the importance of urethral beta adrenergic receptors, which is not well-recognized in the literature.", 
    "6": "To investigate the effect of glucose (Glc) infusion on endurance performance after beta-adrenoceptor blockade, eight healthy male volunteers performed four endurance cycle ergometer tests at 67% of maximal work load after 80 mg of propranolol (Pr) or placebo (Pl) were administered orally in combination with a continuous infusion of Glc (0.5 g/min) or saline (Sal). The order of the tests was randomized. Endurance times were 53 +/- 6 (SE), 64 +/- 7, 26 +/- 5, and 31 +/- 6 min after Pl+Sal, Pl+Glc, Pr+Sal, and Pr+Glc, respectively (P < 0.001). Glc infusion increased endurance after Pl (P < 0.05) but not after Pr. Glc infusion resulted in significantly higher plasma Glc concentrations during exercise compared with Sal infusion (P < 0.001). Glc infusion had no effect on cardiorespiratory or other metabolic variables. Plasma ammonia concentration was increased during the Pr tests (P < 0.001) but reached similar values at exhaustion in all tests and was not affected by Glc infusion. The maintenance of plasma Glc concentration during endurance exercise at or above preexercise levels did not improve the reduction of endurance performance after Pr, indicating that the availability of blood Glc is not a limiting factor in this process.", 
    "7": "Brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels increase during hypoxia, which may modulate the ventilatory response to hypoxia. To test the possibility that the depressed neonatal ventilatory response to hypoxia may be related to increased central nervous system GABA activity, 26 sedated spontaneously breathing newborn piglets (age 5 +/- 1 day, wt 1.7 +/- 0.4 kg) were studied. Minute ventilation (VE), oxygen consumption, heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and arterial blood gases were measured in room air and after 1, 5, and 10 min of hypoxia (inspired O2 fraction 0.10) before drug intervention. Immediately after these measurements, an infusion of saline or the GABA alpha-receptor blocker (bicuculline, 0.3 mg/kg iv) or beta-receptor blocker (CGP-35348, 100-300 mg/kg iv) was administered while animals were hypoxic. All measurements were repeated at 1, 5, and 10 min after initiation of the drug infusion. Basal VE was similar among groups. During hypoxia, VE increased significantly in the animals that received either a GABA alpha- or beta-receptor blocker but not in those receiving saline. Changes in arterial Po2, oxygen consumption, heart rate, and arterial blood pressure were similar among groups before and after saline or GABA antagonist infusion. These results suggest that the decrease in ventilation during the biphasic ventilatory response to hypoxia in the neonatal piglet is in part mediated through the depressant effect of GABA on the central nervous system.", 
    "8": "According to the literature, approximately half of all patients diagnosed with reflex sympathetic dystrophy respond to nonoperative treatment. Because no long-term studies exist, however, the relapse rate and outcome of this condition are not known. In this paper, a historical review and a brief discussion of the theories of pathogenesis of the disease are presented. The results of treatment, as documented in the literature, are also presented. This paper also reports on 10 patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy who were treated nonoperatively and for whom a follow-up of at least 1 year was documented. The patient population and short-term results are consistent with those found in the literature. Nine of the 10 patients were contacted for long-term follow-up at an average of more than 5 years after diagnosis. A significant number of patients experienced worsening of symptoms (56%) and reported that their condition negatively affected their activities of daily living (78%). Of those who were employed prior to diagnosis, 67% reported a job change or unemployment directly related to the disease. Therefore, the long-term results of nonoperative treatment are not as encouraging as is indicated in the literature.", 
    "9": "Mechanisms involved in the development of atherosclerosis are reviewed. Based primarily on experimental studies, the following key steps are suggested; (1) endothelial injury; (2) platelet and leukocyte adhesion; (3) smooth muscle proliferation; (4) lipid deposition; (5) arterial tissue hypoxia. Beta-blockers may interfere with (1), (2), (4) and (5), and have been shown to inhibit experimental atherosclerosis, even if given after the disease has been established. Calcium channel and ACE inhibitors interfere with (2), and have been shown to inhibit experimental atherosclerosis if given throughout the experimental period. It is unclear whether the association between hypertension and atherosclerosis is causal. Therefore, antihypertensive agents should be selected according to their potential to interfere with the atherosclerotic process. The primary choice would then be beta-blockers, combined with calcium channel or ACE inhibitors if the patient is considered to be at risk of developing new lesions.", 
    "10": "This review addresses the vascular effects of beta-blockers in patients with normal peripheral circulation, with hypertension or with peripheral arterial disease. Despite conflicting data from many uncontrolled and relatively small studies some general conclusions can be drawn. In the absence of peripheral vascular disease there is no good evidence of any adverse effects of beta-blocker treatment on peripheral circulation. Nevertheless, it may be useful to change from non-selective to beta-1 selective beta-blockers or to beta-blockers with ISA when patients complain of cold extremities. In hypertensive patients, beta-blocker therapy may similarly cause cold extremities, especially with non-selective beta-blockade. Successful long-term antihypertensive treatment, as with beta-blockers, may restore normal vascular architecture. In patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease, beta-blockers are not generally contraindicated although they should be administered with extreme caution when disease is severe. In less severe forms of occlusive disease, beta-blockers have little effect on peripheral circulation and may even improve flow to the diseased area by an inverse steal effect.", 
    "11": "The use of beta-blocking agents in patients with heart failure is still controversial. An activated sympatho-adrenal system in heart failure may support blood pressure and cardiac index, on the other hand, it increases cardiac load and myocardial oxygen consumption, reduces myocardial oxygen supply and may contribute to the high incidence of arrhythmias and sudden death. Today there is a certain awareness about the important role of the sympatho-adrenal system in CHF. Short-term studies failed to demonstrate a benefit of beta-blockers while long-term studies have proved major haemodynamic benefit and functional improvement in most patients. The haemodynamic benefit consists of a reduction of heart rate and left ventricular filling pressure and an improvement in exercise capacity. The mechanism of these actions of beta-blockers, with the exception of lowering heart rate, remains unclear. Energy metabolism of the failing heart, which is considered to be deficient, may beneficially be influenced by chronic beta-blocker treatment. Effects of beta-blockers on prognosis in patients with heart failure are also still controversial. Most recent trials (MDC Trial, CIBIS Trial) were inconclusive concerning mortality. Aetiology of heart failure may be important; however, observations on secondary prevention post-myocardial infarction also contradict heart failure studies. Thus, further efforts are urgently needed to define the mechanism of action of beta-blockers in patients with cardiac failure and to identify more clearly patients who benefit from this type of therapy.", 
    "12": "This prospective study was done to compare the efficacy of timolol and acetazolamide in lowering the intraocular pressure (IOP) secondary to the use of sodium hyaluronate (Healon) in cataract surgery. Fifty patients undergoing extracapsular cataract extraction and implantation of a posterior chamber lens were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: no viscoelastic (10 patients), Healon with 0.5% timolol drops postoperatively (12 patients), Healon with acetazolamide postoperatively (16 patients), or Healon only (12 patients). The IOP was measured during the first 24 hours after surgery. Sodium hyaluronate caused a marked increase in IOP in the early (6 to 12 hours) postoperative period. Timolol proved to be more effective than acetazolamide in controlling this pressure increase.", 
    "13": "The influence of pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) on characteristics of beta-adrenoceptor bindings was examined in myocardial ventricular membranes prepared from rabbits which received an intravenous injection of PTX (10 micrograms/kg) or its vehicle. The density and affinity of beta-adrenoceptors assessed by (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol were not significantly altered by PTX pretreatment. However, a fraction of agonist binding sites with high affinity significantly increased in PTX-pretreated myocardial membranes. In the presence of 100 microM 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate, all agonist binding sites were converted to low-affinity sites in both control and PTX-pretreated membranes. The results suggest that Gi might regulate negatively coupling of beta-adrenoceptors to Gs.", 
    "14": "The clinical efficacy of antidepressants that block serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) reuptake may be restrained by indirect activation of autoreceptors. In vivo microdialysis in rat hippocampus was used to assess the release-inhibitory properties of the 5-HT reuptake inhibitors citalopram and paroxetine. When reuptake was first blocked by infusing citalopram into the hippocampus, systemic administration of citalopram or paroxetine resulted in a 50-70% decrease in hippocampal 5-HT overflow. This presumably reflected the inhibition of 5-HT release subsequent to reuptake blockade in the raphe nuclei and, in turn, activation of somatodendritic autoreceptors. In support, pretreatment with (+/-)-pindolol or (+)-WAY100135 ((+)-N-tert-butyl-3-(4-(2- methoxyphenyl)piperazine-1-yl)-2-phenylpropanamide dihydrochloride), to block 5-HT1A autoreceptors, abolished the decrease in 5-HT produced by systemic injection of the uptake blockers.", 
    "15": "The effects of tilisolol on ischemic myocardial energy and carbohydrate metabolism were examined, and compared with those of propranolol. Ischemia was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery for 3 or 30 min in anesthetized open-chest dogs, 5 min after saline, tilisolol (0.2 mg.kg-1, i.v.), or propranolol (1 mg.kg-1, i.v.) injection. During ischemia, the myocardial energy stores were depleted, and the levels of glycolytic intermediates were altered, associated with ST segment elevation and TQ segment depression of the epicardial electrocardiogram. Tilisolol prevented the myocardial energy depletion and alterations of carbohydrate metabolism caused by 3 min of ischemia, to the same extent as did propranolol. Even 30 min after ischemia, the prevention of these ischemic changes was sustained by tilisolol, but not by propranolol. Tilisolol briefly reduced the ST segment elevation and TQ segment depression induced by ischemia. These results suggest that the protective effects of tilisolol on the ischemic myocardium are more potent and long-lasting than those of propranolol.", 
    "16": "The frequency of silent infarction is an important issue because it is a marker of vascular disease. We studied the occurrence of silent infarction in a sample of patients from the Dutch TIA trial, in which patients were randomized between 30 and 283 mg of aspirin. A total of 91 patients with TIA or non-disabling ischemic stroke and who did not suffer a stroke during a period of one to four years (mean 32 months) underwent CT scanning both on entry and at the end of the study. A cardiac source of embolism was an exclusion criterion for the trial. We found only one patient with a possibly silent infarction; in four patients a previously detected symptomatic infarct on CT was no longer visible. The rarity of silent infarction in this study may have several explanations; (1) the relatively short period of follow-up, (2) the selection of patients (no cardiac source of embolism), (3) the clinical monitoring at four monthly intervals aimed at detection of focal ischemia, (4) the use of aspirin. Given these circumstances, silent infarction is an infrequent problem.", 
    "17": "Hemodynamic theories of atherogenesis suggest that flow disturbances (departures from laminar flow including high and low shear) and increases in heart rate may be important in the initiation, progression, and complications of atherosclerosis such as dissection and embolism. It is therefore desirable to evaluate the effects of antihypertensive drugs on the occurrence of such flow disturbances. Effects of metoprolol, nifedipine, and captopril were studied, by quantitative spectral analysis, in 20 patients with carotid stenosis to evaluate 3 indices of disturbed flow: peak velocity, spectral broadening index and window index (WI). Heart rate (HR), and the product of WI by HR, were improved (reduced) significantly by metoprolol (p < 0.05), and worsened by nifedipine (p < 0.05), but most of the effect was due to effects on heart rate. These findings suggest that most of the benefit of antihypertensive drugs on flow disturbances can be identified by counting heart rate. Further developments will require improved methods for quantitation of flow disturbances.", 
    "18": "Staurosporine (STAR) is one of the most potent inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC). It is known that in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), the phorbol ester-induced generation of superoxide anion (respiratory burst) is effectively inhibited by STAR in a dose-dependent manner, whereas superoxide generation induced by chemoattractants, e.g. n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) or PAF, is regulated biphasically by STAR. We compared the effects of STAR and K252a on FMLP-induced superoxide production from PMNs and examined the effects of propranolol, a inhibitor of phosphatidic acid (PA) phosphohydrolase, on the potentiation of the production by STAR. We also examined the effects of some derivatives of STAR and K252a on the production and the alteration of the effects induced by propranolol pretreatment. When PMNs were stimulated with FMLP, STAR potentiated superoxide production by 240.5 +/- 30.9% at a low concentration (100 nmol/l). Propranolol pretreatment specifically inhibited the potentiation. When phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) was used as a stimulant, STAR inhibited superoxide production dose-dependently and did not enhance the production. K252a inhibited PMA or FMLP-induced superoxide production dose-dependently and did not enhance FMLP-induced superoxide production. STAR derivatives showed potentiation of FMLP-induced superoxide production similar to that of STAR at concentrations ranging from 10-100 nmol/l, and propranolol (200 mumol/l) effectively inhibited it. K252a derivative NA332 did not show any potentiative effect on the production. PMA-induced superoxide production was inhibited by all compounds dose-dependently.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "1. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relative beta 1/beta 2 antagonist selectivity of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker nadolol, in lower than conventional clinical doses. 2. Eight normal volunteers received single oral doses of either placebo (PL), nadolol 5 mg (N5), 20 mg (N20) or 80 mg (N80) in a single-blind, randomised crossover design. beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonism was assessed by attenuation of exercise tachycardia, and beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade by effects on salbutamol-induced chronotropic, hypokalaemic and finger tremor responses. The relative percentage attenuation of beta 2 and beta 1-mediated responses was calculated and expressed as beta 2:beta 1 selectivity ratios. 3. Nadolol produced dose-related reductions in exercise tachycardia in keeping with increasing beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade; mean % reduction (95% CI) compared with placebo: N5 10.7 (6.6 to 14.8), N20 21.4 (17.3 to 25.4), N80 38.9 (34.8 to 42.9). However, even the lowest dose of nadolol (5 mg) produced almost complete blunting of beta 2-mediated effects and significantly increase exercise hyperkalaemia; peak exercise hyperkalaemia (mmol l-1) (means and 95% CI): PL 4.88 (4.68 to 5.07), N5 5.36 (5.17 to 5.55), N20 5.48 (5.28 to 5.67), N80 5.42 (5.22 to 5.61). beta 2:beta 1 selectivity ratios significantly increased as the dose of nadolol was reduced. 4. These data suggest that whereas in the clinical dose range nadolol behaves as a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, as the dose is reduced this drug demonstrates an increasing degree of selectivity for the beta 2-adrenoceptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "The following review article describes pathophysiological aspects of portal hypertension in its first part, especially the topographic variety of the vascular collateral system creating the danger of variceal bleeding. The second part discusses different forms of therapy including pharmaco- and sclerotherapy as well as operative and interventional procedures. Beta-blocker-therapy preferentially serves for the primary and secondary prevention of variceal bleeding. Sclerotherapy appears as the dominant therapeutic tool for the management of acute variceal bleeding. New chances of therapy include variceal banding and the implantation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt (TIPSS). Operative procedure loose their significance more and more by the wide-spread use of sclerotherapy and the chance of a definite therapy of portal hypertension (liver transplantation) and the use of nonoperative interventional procedure (TIPSS or TIPS) which are still under clinical investigation.", 
    "21": "We determined in anesthetised rabbits the net rate of liquid absorption (NRLA) from Ringer or 1% albumin-Ringer hydrothoraces with the beta-blocker propranolol (or nadolol) or the beta-agonist terbutaline. The beta-blocker reduced NRLA by 38% in 2 ml Ringer hydrothoraces, and did not change it in 2 ml albumin-Ringer hydrothoraces; hence, with beta-blocker NRLA became similar in both kinds of hydrothorax (0.31 +/- 0.02 ml/h). Terbutaline decreased NRLA by 25% in 2 ml Ringer hydrothoraces, and increased it by 29% in 2 ml albumin-Ringer hydrothoraces; hence, with terbutaline NRLA became similar in both kinds of hydrothorax (0.40 +/- 0.02 ml/h), and 25% higher than with beta-blocker. Because beta-adrenoreceptor activity inhibits lymphatic smooth muscles and may increase Na+ transport in epithelia, these results suggest that: (1) pleural mesothelium is provided with beta-receptors, which increase Na+ transport and seem activated by protein dilution, (2) beta-receptors of the pleural lymphatics are essentially silent with and without protein dilution, (3) the lymphatic drainage produced by smooth muscle activity is smaller than the increase in solute-coupled liquid absorption caused by mesothelium beta-receptors.", 
    "22": "Clinical decision-making in cardiology requires accurate estimates of the efficacy of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Defined as the quantitative integration of results from different studies on the same scientific question, meta-analyses are well-suited to summarize the evidence on the efficacy of clinical interventions. Meta-analyses aim at obtaining combined estimates of effect using all relevant information in a systematic fashion, complementing narrative reviews and expert committee reports. In this paper, the advantages and limitations of meta-analyses and their usefulness in clinical decision making in cardiology are illustrated using three recent examples in the literature--i.e., use of beta-blockers in secondary prevention of ischemic heart disease, intravenous streptokinase in acute myocardial infarction and fish intake in primary prevention of cardiovascular mortality. The steps to follow when conducting a meta-analysis are also discussed. Finally, a list of the most important meta-analyses in cardiology published to date is included for easy reference.", 
    "23": "We studied the action of beta-adrenergic agonists on Japanese quail erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (CA) in vitro. Earlier we had reported that epinephrine increased CA activity by 14%; the present study focused on an attempt to increase the size of this response. Washed erythrocytes from reserpine-treated (1 mg/kg daily i.m. for 3 days) and control birds were incubated for 40 min in the presence of isoproterenol 10(-6) mol/l. The activity of CA expressed as Wilbur-Anderson units/mg hemoglobin was increased by as much as 42% in reserpine-treated birds over the control depending on the conditions. Addition of 10(-5) mol/l of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol inhibited the isoproterenol-induced effect in nonreserpinized birds. We conclude that pretreatment with reserpine, which was accompanied by a fall in plasma catecholamine levels, particularly epinephrine levels, enhanced the activation of CA by isoproterenol.", 
    "24": "An antagonist, 21-009, with high affinity for 5-HT1B receptors and some for beta-adrenergic receptors, induces amnesia in the domestic chick when given centrally before training, using a one-trial passive avoidance task. Nonspecific behavioral effects, or effects upon performance at test, almost certainly do not cause the observed amnesia. The 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin and the 5-HT3 antagonist ICS 205-930, did not have any effects when given before training at the same dose as that at which 21-009 was effective. The unusual pattern of action of 21-009 (sensitivity only at, or around the time of learning, combined with very delayed memory loss) resembles that of certain beta-antagonists, but not others. The results are discussed in terms of both direct action on 5-HT systems involved in memory formation and possible interactions between 5-HT and beta-adrenergic systems.", 
    "25": "The present study was aimed at determining the relative potency of various beta-blocking drugs as agonists or antagonists at 5-HT1B receptors. The behavioral model used (increase in escape attempts of isolated mice) has been previously shown to be exclusively responsive to 5-HT1B agonists such as 1-3-(trifluoromethyl) phenylpiperazine (TFMPP). Beta-blocking drugs acted in three different ways: they were either inactive, or acted as agonists or as antagonists at 5-HT1B receptors. The specific beta-blocking drugs: atenolol and betaxolol (beta-1) and ICI 118,551 (beta-2) were inactive by themselves and in interaction with TFMPP. The mixed beta-1 beta-2 blocking drug 1-penbutolol, (but not d-penbutolol), inactive alone, behaved as an antagonist: it impaired in a dose-dependent way the effect of TFMPP. (+/-)Pindolol and (-)pindolol was inactive. None of the (-), (+), or (+/-)pindolol was able to impair TFMPP effect. The increase in escape attempts induced by (+/-)pindolol was antagonized with 1-penbutolol or after a specific desensitization. Cyanopindolol and S-tertatolol (but not R-tertatolol) acted as agonists. SDZ 21009 was inactive as agonist or antagonist. It may be concluded that all beta-blocking drugs are not equivalent regarding their effect at 5-HT1B receptors. L-penbutolol was the only drug acting as an antagonist.", 
    "26": "We tested the hypothesis that celiprolol, a beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist with the ancillary property of beta-2-mediated vasodilation, would increase blood flow to active muscles during exercise and result in less impairment of exercise performance compared with the beta-1 antagonist atenolol. After an initial 3-wk washout phase, 11 untrained hypertensive men participated in a 6-wk crossover study of the two drugs. Each treatment phase was followed by a 3-wk placebo phase. Resting forearm and calf vascular resistance measured by venous occlusion plethysmography and submaximal and maximal bicycle ergometry exercise responses were evaluated at the end of each treatment and placebo phase. Celiprolol significantly decreased resting forearm and calf vascular resistance whereas atenolol had no significant effect. Neither beta-blocker significantly affected submaximal exercise oxygen uptake, rate of perceived exertion, minute ventilation, or respiratory exchange ratio. Both beta-blockers significantly and similarly decreased peak oxygen uptake; celiprolol 23.9 +/- 1.7, atenolol 24.9 +/- 1.7, placebo 27.3 +/- 1.3 ml.kg-1.min-1. Our findings suggest that during exercise while on beta-blockade, other factors such as sympathetic vasoconstriction or local metabolic vasodilation may override beta-2-mediated vasodilation. Thus, the addition of beta-2 agonism to beta-1 antagonism decreases resting vascular resistance but offers no advantage over conventional beta-1 blockade therapy during exercise.", 
    "27": "Dose proportionality of racemic bisoprolol and the stereoselectivity of its enantiomers were studied after single oral dosing of 5 to 40 mg of bisoprolol hemifumarate in eight healthy male volunteers in an open-label, randomized, four-way cross-over trial. There were dose-proportional increases in mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) values for the racemate and the individual enantiomers. No statistically significant differences were detected between the mean half life (t 1/2), Cmax, and time to reach Cmax (tmax) of the R- and S-isomers at each of the four dose levels studied. These findings support dose proportionality and absence of stereoselective pharmacokinetics for bisoprolol in the dose range studied.", 
    "28": "The cardiovascular actions of racemic atenolol (RSATN) have been well characterized in humans, but the actions of S(-)-atenolol (SATN) when administered alone are unknown. In this study, responses of heart rate (HR) and Doppler-derived aortic blood flow profiles to upright treadmill exercise were compared after oral administration of 50 mg SATN and 100 mg RSATN in eight healthy, adult, male volunteers. After a single-blind, placebo run-in period, subjects were randomly allocated in a double-blind, crossover fashion to receive SATN and RSATN. Each study period was separated by a 7-day washout period. Multiple submaximal exercise tests were performed and data were collected over the 24 hours after each treatment. Both SATN and RSATN significantly (P < .05) blunted peak exercise HR by 38 +/- 3 and 37 +/- 3 beats/min, respectively. Aortic blood flow acceleration measured during peak exercise decreased after SATN and RSATN, by 13 +/- 4 and 13 +/- 3 m/sec2, respectively (P < .05). No difference in hemodynamic effect was observed between treatments. Pharmacodynamic parameters derived from plasma S(-)-atenolol concentration-effect (HR) curves after SATN, RSATN, and total atenolol plasma concentrations after RSATN did not differ significantly. Predicted maximum reductions in heart rate (Emax) and EC50 for S(-)-atenolol after SATN were 39.6 +/- 5.8 beats/min and 38.4 +/- 40.9 ng/ml versus 34.5 +/- 8 beats/min and 25.9 +/- 29.9 ng/ml for RSATN, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "Since the late 1970s, topical beta-adrenergic blockers have been the drugs of choice in treating ocular hypertension and associated glaucoma. The currently available drugs are timolol, betaxolol, levobunolol, metipranolol, and carteolol. All reduce intraocular pressure by decreasing the production of aqueous humor. Although these drugs are applied locally in the eye, they may enter the general circulation and reach concentrations high enough to cause systemic effects, including alterations in heart rate and rhythm, bronchoconstriction, dyslipidemia, and central nervous system abnormalities. Interactions with other drugs may also occur. Ocular beta- blockers differ in beta 1-selectivity (betaxolol is beta 1-selective, whereas the other drugs are nonselective) and in intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) or partial agonist properties (only carteolol possesses ISA). These differences give betaxolol and carteolol potential advantages in minimizing certain side effects. The advantage of betaxolol vis-\u00e0-vis systemic side effects is more clearly established than that of carteolol. Further systematic study is needed to determine what advantages, if any, are conferred by the presence of ISA.", 
    "30": "Brain macrophages (BM), a subpopulation of microglia, have the ability to kill neurons by producing reactive oxygen intermediates. Cocultures of neurons and macrophages derived from the cerebral cortex of rat embryos were used to look for regulation of BM neurotoxicity. Isoproterenol (10(-7) M), a beta-adrenergic agonist, induced a significant inhibition of BM neurotoxicity and this effect was abolished in the presence of propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist. BM neurotoxicity was also reduced in the presence of prostaglandin E2 (10(-8), 10(-6) M), a metabolite derived from arachidonic acid. These results suggest endogenous mechanisms of neuroprotection operating either during development or following lesions.", 
    "31": "Specific binding of the hydrophilic radioligand [3H]CGP-12177 to cell surface (functional) beta-adrenoreceptors was quantified in ventricular micropunches (2 mm diameter, 350 microns thickness) from seawater-acclimated rainbow trout held at 7-9 degrees. Binding was stereospecific, saturable, of high affinity, and displaceable by appropriate agonists and antagonists. Phentolamine failed to displace [3H]CGP at concentrations up to 10(-4) M, indicating an absence of [3H]CGP binding to alpha-adrenergic receptors. Trout ventricular beta-adrenoreceptors are exclusively of the beta 2 type. This conclusion is based on (1) the IC50 value for the beta 2-antagonist ICI 118551 (2.9 x 10(-6) M); (2) the inability of the beta 1-antagonist atenolol to displace [3H]CGP from beta-adrenoreceptors; and (3) the order of agonist-binding affinity (isoproterenol > epinephrine > norepinephrine). The Bmax and Kd values for [3H]CGP binding to myocardial tissue were approximately 0.04 fmol micrograms protein-1 and 0.25 nM, respectively. The Bmax value indicates that the density of cell surface (functional) beta-adreno-receptors in the ventricle was 12,000 sites per cell or 3.38 sites per microns 2 of sarcolemma. The Kd and Bmax values for [3H]CGP binding to ventricular beta-adrenoreceptors were unaffected by the in vivo administration of five bolus catecholamine injections (4.0 micrograms kg-1 epinephrine, 2.0 micrograms kg-1 norepinephrine). This suggests that stress-induced increases in plasma catecholamines are unlikely to cause the down-regulation of heart beta-adrenoreceptors in fish. The method described here represents a simple but powerful technique for the quantification and characterization of adrenergic receptors in the fish heart.", 
    "32": "Despite the introduction of new mechanical techniques for revascularization, pharmacologic therapy continues to be the mainstay of antianginal therapy. The conventional antianginal medications, which include nitrates, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers, act to correct the imbalance between myocardial supply and demand by increasing coronary blood flow, reducing myocardial oxygen requirements, or both. All three are appropriate for the management of angina caused by a fixed coronary obstruction, but nitrates and calcium channel blockers, which not only reduce demand but also increase supply, are preferred in cases of angina believed to involve a significant increase in vasomotor tone. Because of the different yet complementary mechanisms of action of the three classes of anti-ischemic drugs, use of these agents in combination is a rational approach to the treatment of angina unresponsive to monotherapy. Such combinations have been shown to enhance the therapeutic response achieved with single-agent therapy. In addition, the pharmacologic action of one of the components of the combination regimen may serve to offset side effects typically associated with the other.",

When they were given intravenously to anesthetized rats, some of them exhibited both hypotensive and beta-blocking activities. Their structure-activity relationships for hypotensive and beta-blocking activities are discussed. Compound 11c had the best profile and was selected for further study.", 
    "34": "Fenfluramine (0.1-10 mg/kg, i.p.) induced penile erection in naive rats with a bell-shaped dose response curve. The response to fenfluramine (1 mg/kg) was antagonized by scopolamine (0.032-1 mg/kg) but not by methyl-scopolamine (0.032-1 mg/kg) pre-treatment. The septo-hippocampal cholinergic deafferentations by medial septum lesion or fimbria-fornix transection also attenuated the penile erection induced by fenfluramine, whereas dopaminergic blockade by sulpiride (3.2-100 mg/kg) had hardly any effect. Pindolol (0.1-3.2 mg/kg), a 5-HT1 antagonist, and ICS205-930, a 5-HT3 antagonist, but not ketanserin, a 5-HT2 antagonist, inhibited the penile erection induced by fenfluramine. Depletion of 5-HT not only by systemic injections of p-chlorophenylalanine (150 mg/kg i.p. at 72, 48 and 24 h before the test) but also by the injections of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), a serotonergic neurotoxin, into the median- and dorsal-raphe nuclei significantly attenuated the fenfluramine-induced penile erections. Neurochemical analyses revealed that the raphe-lesion significantly reduced the contents of serotonin (5-HT) and its major metabolite, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) but not choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activities in all the cortical and subcortical regions examined. The results suggest that fenfluramine facilitates the expression of penile erection in rats through an activation of the septo-hippocampal cholinergic pathway as a consequence of excitation of the raphe-hippocampal serotonergic pathway in which 5-HT1 and/or 5-HT3 receptors appear to play a regulatory role.", 
    "35": "1. The effects of isoprenaline, a forskolin derivative NKH-477, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (db cyclic AMP) on the membrane potential, conductance and cell volume of the dog non-pigmented ciliary epithelium (NPE) were investigated by intracellular potential recording, nystatin-perforated patch clamp technique and videomicroscopic cytometry. 2. The resting membrane potential of NPE was about -70 mV in physiological saline and was depolarized by isoprenaline in a dose-dependent manner with an ED50 of about 3 nM. This depolarization was competitively antagonized by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, timolol (pA2 = ca. 9) and almost completely blocked by the Cl transport blocker, DIDS. 3. In single dissociated NPE cells, 10 microM isoprenaline induced an inward current and caused a concomitant decrease in cell volume. The reversal potential measurement indicated that this inward current was carried mainly by Cl ion. DIDS (10 microM) abolished both the current and cell volume decrease. 4. NKH-477 (10 microM) or db cyclic AMP (1 mM) also induced an inward current together with a cell volume decrease, the properties of which were similar to those caused by isoprenaline. 5. These results suggest that beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in NPE leads to an increased rate of aqueous humour production by increasing Cl- efflux via an elevation of cyclic AMP and this effect is efficiently blocked by timolol.", 
    "36": "Sotalol is a beta-adrenergic blocking drug with the additional property of lengthening the cardiac action potential. These electrophysiologic properties render the drug attractive for use in the prevention of postoperative supraventricular arrhythmias (SVA), and previous studies have suggested that it was indeed effective. The hemodynamic response to sotalol and its safety early after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery were therefore studied. Forty-two patients undergoing CABG were randomly assigned either to receive sotalol to prevent postoperative SVA (25 patients) or to serve as controls (17 patients). Sotalol was started 6 hours after surgery if patients had a cardiac index > 2.8 L/min/m2 with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure < 15 mmHg, and if they had no contraindications to the use of beta-blockers. The drug was given as a loading infusion of 1 mg/kg over 2 hours, followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.15 mg/kg/h for 24 hours. Three hours later, patients received the first oral dose of 80 mg to be repeated every 8 or 12 hours. Adverse effects necessitating discontinuation of the drug (bradycardia < 50 beats/min, systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, or cardiac index < 2.2 L/min/m2) occurred in six patients (24%) and were mainly related to the loading infusion. The hemodynamic data for patients who completed the study were characterized by a significant fall of the cardiac index caused by a lower heart rate without significant change of the stroke volume index. The incidence of supraventricular arrhythmias was not significantly different in the two groups (3/19 in the sotalol group, 5/17 in the control group).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "This is a retrospective review of 185 short children who were tested for growth hormone (GH) secretion using the L-dopa-propranolol provocative test. One hundred and thirty-three children were deemed to have passed the screening test when a GH concentration of greater than 15 miu/L was elicited after stimulation. Fifty-two failed the screening test, of which 33 were diagnosed as having growth hormone deficiency (GHD) when they had inadequate growth hormone response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. The other 19 were low-responders since they showed adequate GH response to insulin tolerance test (ITT). The low-responder rate to L-dopa-propranolol provocative test among short children who are not GH deficient was 12.5%. The low cost of L-dopa and propranolol, the simplicity and safety of the test, and the acceptable rate of low-responders make the test an effective screening test for GHD.", 
    "38": "Carvedilol is a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking vasodilator drug that may be a promising new agent in the management of cardiovascular disease. The rationale for the development of agents of this type is that the alpha-blocking component may overcome the direct vasoconstrictor consequence of beta 2-blockade, whilst the beta-blocker component may inhibit the reflex tachycardia that occurs following alpha-blockade. In clinical trials published to date, carvedilol has been demonstrated to be effective as an antihypertensive agent as monotherapy and also as additional therapy in those patients whose blood pressure cannot be controlled on other standard agents. It is also effective in the management of angina. Carvedilol has beneficial haemodynamic effects in patients with congestive heart failure. beta-Blocker vasodilator drugs of this type may be particularly useful in this condition as the vasodilator component of the drug may overcome the initial negative inotropy of the beta-blocker. In addition, carvedilol possess potentially useful pharmacological actions. In particular, the drug has antimitogenic and free radical scavenging effects that may make it a useful therapy in the long term management of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Its metabolic profile is also favourable, presumably on the basis of its alpha-blocking properties. Thus, beta 2-mediated adverse effects on peripheral vascular tone, glycaemic control and lipid status appear to be offset by the alpha-blocking property of the drug. Carvedilol thus far appears to be well tolerated, with postural dizziness the major adverse effect, especially in the elderly. As with nonselective beta-blockers, carvedilol is contraindicated in patients with asthma.", 
    "39": "The mechanism of adverse imipramine-induced reactions (jitteriness, convulsions) was investigated by precipitating such reactions in rats with three injections (IP) of imipramine (5-40 mg/kg) at 24, 5, and 1 h before testing, and comparing their occurrence with comparable treatments using specific noradrenergic and serotonergic reuptake inhibitors [nortriptyline (10 or 30 mg/kg, IP), citalopram (0.5-5.0 mg/kg, IP)]. This initial study indicated that these reactions were mediated by imipramine's noradrenergic effects. Subsequent combinations of imipramine and an alpha 2 agonist (clonidine, 5 mg/kg) and antagonist (yohimbine, 2 mg/kg), and a beta-adrenergic antagonist (propranolol, 2 or 5 mg/kg) (all administered IP 0.5 h after the last injection of imipramine) suggested imipramine's adverse effects were mediated by alpha 2 receptors. The possible involvement of the locus ceruleus in these effects was considered.", 
    "40": "In these studies, clenbuterol, a beta 2-adrenergic agonist, was injected into male rats and the intake of a three-choice macronutrient diet was measured. The intakes of fat and protein were selectively inhibited by clenbuterol in both overnight-fasted and freely fed rats. There was no effect of clenbuterol on carbohydrate intake. Prior administration of nadolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, which does not easily pass the blood-brain barrier, completely antagonized the anorectic effect of clenbuterol. However, section of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve did not abolish the nadolol effect. These results suggest that the anorectic effect of clenbuterol is mediated by peripheral beta 2-adrenergic receptors rather than central beta 2-adrenoceptors, and is not related to information transmitted from the liver via the vagus nerve.", 
    "41": "In a companion study [Blaak, E.E., M.A. van Baak, G.J. Kemerink, M.T.W. Pakbiers, G.A.K. Heidendal, and W.H.M. Saris. Am. J. Physiol. 267 (Endocrinol. Metab. 30): E306-E315, 1994.], we found that during infusion of the nonselective beta-agonist isoprenaline (Iso), obese males had a lowered Iso-induced rise in arterial glycerol and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and a lowered muscle NEFA oxidation. The present study was intended to investigate whether a period of weight reduction would alter this impaired fat utilization in obese males. Before and after a 5-wk diet intervention (very low calorie diet) whole body energy expenditure was determined during rest and during intravenous infusion of increasing doses of Iso. In addition, forearm muscle metabolism was investigated with Iso infusion with and without simultaneous infusion of the beta 1-blocker atenolol (AT) by measuring skeletal muscle blood flow and arteriovenous concentration differences of various metabolites across muscle. The Iso-induced whole body thermogenesis tended to increase as a result of weight loss when this response was related to the plasma Iso concentration (P = 0.09), whereas both before and after diet there were no changes in the respiratory exchange ratio during Iso infusion. The increases in arterial NEFA and glycerol concentrations as a result of Iso infusion were not significantly different before and after weight reduction. In addition, muscle NEFA uptake did not change as a result of Iso or Iso plus AT infusion both before and after diet, whereas muscle glucose uptake and lactate release tended to be more pronounced after weight reduction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "42": "The effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation on whole body energy expenditure and forearm skeletal muscle metabolism was investigated in lean and obese men. Whole body energy expenditure was determined during rest and during intravenous infusion of increasing doses of the nonselective beta-agonist isoprenaline (Iso). Forearm skeletal muscle metabolism was investigated with Iso infusion with and without simultaneous infusion of the beta 1-blocker atenolol (AT) by measuring skeletal muscle blood flow (SMBF) and arteriovenous concentration differences of various metabolites. The changes in SMBF were estimated from forearm total (venous occlusion plethysmography), skin (laser doppler), and fat tissue blood flow (133Xe washout). The increase in whole body energy expenditure with Iso was similar in lean and obese subjects. With Iso, the rise in arterial or arterialized glycerol and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) was lower in obese than lean subjects, which may reflect a lower beta-adrenergically mediated lipolysis in obesity. During infusion of increasing doses of Iso, the respiratory exchange ratio decreased significantly in lean subjects but not in the obese subjects, which indicates a more pronounced increase in fat oxidation in lean subjects. This is confirmed by the data on skeletal muscle metabolism, where NEFA uptake was increased in lean subjects, whereas the obese subjects showed a tendency toward an increased glucose uptake and a significantly increased lactate release. With Iso plus AT (mainly beta 2-adrenergic stimulation), both groups showed an increased skeletal muscle lactate release. In conclusion, although the thermogenic response to Iso was similar in lean and obese subjects, the utilization of fat seems to be impaired in obesity.", 
    "43": "The interrelationships between dose, drug and metabolite levels in the brain, cortex and blood and the magnitude of cortical beta adrenergic receptor downregulation were studied in rats after chronic i.p. administration of desipramine and its demethylated metabolite, desmethyldesipramine. Desipramine and desmethyldesipramine were distributed extensively into the brain and cortex with mean tissue to blood concentration ratios of approximately 10 to 1 and 14 to 1, respectively. Increasing doses of desipramine and desmethyldesipramine resulted in greater than linear increases in the corresponding steady-state trough concentrations of these drugs in brain, cortex and blood. Both drugs caused dose-dependent decreases in cortical beta adrenergic receptor density. The higher doses of desipramine and the highest dose of desmethyldesipramine used in this study caused maximal downregulation of beta adrenergic receptors. No changes were observed in the Kd of cortical beta adrenergic receptors after the administration of the two drugs. The ED50 for desipramine was determined to be 5.10 mg/kg, whereas the ED50 for desmethyldesipramine was 7.71 mg/kg. Nonlinear least-squares fitting of cortical concentration-effect data to the pharmacodynamic Emax model equation after the separate administration of desipramine and desmethyldesipramine generated Emax estimates for desipramine and desmethyldesipramine of approximately 36 and 29%, respectively, and EC50 estimates of 365 and 467 ng/g, respectively. Desmethyldesipramine is capable of maximally downregulating cortical beta adrenergic receptors and could account, in part, for the effect observed after desipramine administration.", 
    "44": "Five patients with one- or two-vessel disease had one to three bypass grafts using the Hemopump cardiac assist system instead of cardiopulmonary bypass to decompress the heart and as circulatory support. In addition, the short-acting beta-blocker esmolol was given as a bolus and stepwise titrated to make the heart flaccid and facilitate operation. All patients had a 24F Hemopump placed into the left ventricle. The patients were given 7,500 U of heparin. Average time on Hemopump support was 56 minutes. All patients went through the procedure uneventfully. Thirty minutes after pump removal all patients were back to baseline hemodynamic values. None of the patients needed blood transfusion. No postoperative renal impairment was seen. This method has great potential and could avoid the drawbacks associated with cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest. Careful evaluation in randomized studies is the next step.", 
    "45": "Twelve pigs undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting had the Hemopump to decompress the heart and as circulatory support. The pigs also were given a short-acting beta-blocker, esmolol, to make the heart flaccid. Extracorporeal circulation was not used. During Hemopump support, a bolus dose of 0.5 to 5 mg/kg of esmolol was given before incremental titration steps from 100 to 600 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 over 15 to 20 minutes. The internal thoracic artery was sutured to the distal part of the left anterior descending artery. The Hemopump was withdrawn to the aorta after a weaning period of 20 to 30 minutes. Seven of 12 pigs went through the whole procedure and the Hemopump was weaned off without complications. Five animals died due to right ventricular failure in association with esmolol administration. There was a big interindividual difference in esmolol dose-response curves in the surviving animals. No significant differences in the hemodynamic variables were observed during the experiment. The Hemopump in combination with a short-acting beta-blocker could be an alternate way of performing coronary artery bypass grafting in selected patients.", 
    "46": "The role of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) in parasympathetic coronary vasodilation following carotid chemoreflex activation induced by nicotine in conscious dogs and stimulation of the vagus nerve in anesthetized dogs was studied. Injection of nicotine (11 +/- 4 micrograms) into the carotid artery increased coronary blood flow (CBF) by 126 +/- 16% from 28 +/- 3 ml/min and reduced late diastolic coronary resistance (LDCR) by 43 +/- 4% from 3.58 +/- 0.52 mmHg.ml-1.min, accompanied by a significant increase in mean arterial pressure and a decrease in heart rate (all P < 0.01). Pacing and propranolol did not change the coronary vascular response to chemoreflex activation. There were still increases in CBF by 113 +/- 17% from 29 +/- 3 ml/min and decreases in LDCR by 41 +/- 5% from 3.13 +/- 0.52 mmHg.ml-1.min (all P < 0.01). After infusion of N omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) (30 mg/kg), the increase in CBF following chemoreflex activation was only 23 +/- 3% from 37 +/- 3 ml/min, and the fall in LDCR was 19 +/- 3% from 3.09 +/- 0.51 mmHg.ml-1.min. Stimulation of the vagus nerve showed a relationship between stimulation frequency and coronary vasodilation that was significantly inhibited by L-NNA. Thus EDRF plays an important role in mediating parasympathetic coronary vasodilation during chemoreflex activation and perhaps during many reflexes that cause vagal cholinergic vasodilation in the heart.", 
    "47": "Adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) or beta-adrenergic stimulation has been shown to increase actomyosin adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) activity in cardiac muscle. Because the major catecholamine transmitters have both alpha- and beta-adrenergic activity, the possibility of a role for alpha-adrenergic stimulation in the regulation of ATPase activity has been investigated. Histochemical measurement of actomyosin ATPase activity in quickly frozen rat hearts has been used as the assay of enzymatic function of the contractile proteins. The dose-response curve of ATPase activity to cAMP shows an increase in ATPase activity at a threshold concentration of 0.01 microM, a peak effect at 0.5-1.0 microM, and a decline beyond 1.5 microM to a level below control at 10 microM cAMP. Kinetic studies varying ATP concentration from 0.5 to 10 mM indicated the existence of multiple forms of actomyosin ATPase activity in the absence of cAMP and only one form with a higher maximum velocity in the presence of 1 microM cAMP. Apparently cAMP raises the enzymatic activity of the individual actomyosin molecule rather than increasing the number of active molecules. The addition of an alpha-adrenergic blocker had no significant effect in the absence of added cAMP, but in the presence of the cyclic nucleotide, 1 microM prazosin always produced a negative effect on ATPase activity. Over the entire range of 0.01-10 microM, cAMP lowered ATPase activity when the alpha-adrenergic antagonist was present. The integrity of the cAMP regulatory system was sensitive to the tissue oxygen tension at the time the heart was quickly frozen. At certain oxygen tension, the stimulatory component of the cAMP regulation was observed without any inhibitory component, suggesting that there are two relatively independent parts of the regulatory mechanism, an inhibitory and a stimulatory. In the presence of gamma-labeled [32P]ATP, 32P was incorporated into several proteins, including the inhibitory subunit of troponin (TNI), C protein, and the regulatory light chain of myosin. cAMP (1 microM) caused an increase in 32P labeling of TNI and C protein. The addition of prazosin with cAMP caused a decrease in the overall level of phosphorylation with specific dephosphorylation of C protein and TNI, the former to a degree similar to the decrease in actomyosin ATPase activity, the latter to a greater degree. These results indicate that alpha-adrenergic activity modulates the balance between kinase and phosphatase activity in the presence of cAMP, probably by inhibiting phosphatase activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "48": "Esmolol is an ultra-short-acting beta-blocker that is widely used to lower blood pressure in acute settings intraoperatively and in patients with hypertension. Other beta-blockers have not been used in this way because of the belief that beta-blockers do not acutely lower blood pressure. The purpose of this study was to determine if esmolol has a hypotensive effect that is greater than other beta-blockers at similar degrees of beta-blockade. Esmolol, metoprolol, and propranolol were administered intravenously at three doses chosen to produce comparable degrees of beta-blockade. In spite of achieving comparable beta-blockade, esmolol produced a greater reduction in blood pressure than the other beta-blockers, implying that the hypotensive effect of esmolol cannot be accounted for simply by beta-blockade. There was no evidence to support a direct vasodilatory action of esmolol, and esmolol did not lower plasma norepinephrine concentrations.", 
    "49": "We evaluated the effects of potential factors in autoregulatory escape from norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction in rat anterior mesenteric artery. We determined mesenteric artery blood flow velocity with a pulsed Doppler, sonic flowmeter, and systemic arterial blood pressure with a transducer. A 4-min norepinephrine infusion (0.125-1.0 x 10(-8) M/min) intravenously evoked a dose-dependent, initial vasoconstriction that was followed by rapid escape of blood flow toward or above the control value during sustained norepinephrine administration. Neonatal capsaicin treatment enhanced vasoconstrictor responses to norepinephrine but failed to affect escape parameters. Propranolol decreased norepinephrine-induced escape dose dependently. Adenosine deaminase attenuated escape, and the combination of this enzyme plus propranolol nearly abolished escape from norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction. Methylene blue also diminished autoregulatory escape. These findings suggest that norepinephrine-induced autoregulatory escape involves simultaneous beta-adrenoceptor, purinergic, and endothelial mediation. Norepinephrine-evoked mesenteric vasoconstriction appears to involve predominantly alpha 2-adrenoceptors and is modulated by peptidergic sensory nerves and adenosine.",

    "59": "Six female patients aged 23 to 38 years with IST and 10 age- and sex-matched control subjects were assessed with the following autonomic function tests: (1) sympathovagal balance to the sinus node assessed by calculating the LF/HF (low frequency/high frequency) ratio using power spectral analysis both in the supine position and after 10 minutes of head-up tilt to 60 degrees, (2) cardiovagal reflex assessed by cold face test (CFT), (3) beta-adrenergic sensitivity as determined by calculating isoproterenol dose-response curves and isoproterenol chronotropic dose 25 (CD25), and (4) intrinsic heart rate (IHR) assessed after autonomic blockade with atropine 0.04 mg/kg and propranolol 0.2 mg/kg administered as an intravenous bolus. No significant differences in the LF/HF ratio both in the supine position (2.8 +/- 0.3 versus 2.6 +/- 0.4) and during upright tilt (8.7 +/- 1.3 versus 8.5 +/- 0.5) were observed between control subjects and IST patients.

    "61": "Sudden cardiac death usually occurs secondary to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Even under ideal circumstances only 20% of patients who have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survive to hospital discharge. Therefore, aggressive treatment and screening of high-risk patients are mandatory to improve survival rates. Risk stratification of high-risk patients, such as the post-myocardial infarction (MI) population, has been of limited value. Between 70% and 85% of \"high-risk\" post-MI patients, as defined by these screening tests, will not have a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia over several years of follow-up. The use of beta-blockers and possibly amiodarone may have some benefit in reducing mortality in high-risk patients after an MI. Several ongoing trials are studying the use of serial drug testing, amiodarone, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in reducing the incidence of sudden cardiac death in patients with potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Although implantable cardioverter-defibrillators appear to be superior to antiarrhythmic drugs in reducing sudden cardiac death, total mortality may not be altered. In sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias, sotalol and amiodarone appear to be superior to other drugs in preventing arrhythmia recurrence. Ongoing trials, such as the Antiarrhythmic Drug versus Implantable Device (AVID) trial may define the best strategy in these high-risk patients.",

[125I]Iodocyanopindolol binding to beta 1-adrenergic receptors was found to increase significantly in the caudate-putamen and the somatosensory areas of the frontal cortex after both citalopram and fluoxetine treatments. Imipramine treatment elicited a marked decrease in beta 1 binding in the outer laminae of the cingulate cortex, as well as in the motor and somatosensory areas of the frontal cortex. In a separate experiment, rats were treated with saline, citalopram (2.5, 10 and 20 mg kg-1) or fluoxetine (2.5, 10 and 20 mg kg-1) SC once daily for 14 days.

During phase 1, patients were screened and placed on maintenance atenolol therapy at 50 or 100 mg/day, while phase 2 consisted of right-sided catheterization and randomization of patients to either amlodipine (10 mg i.v.) or diltiazem (10 mg i.v.). Following treatment with amlodipine, no significant alteration in markers of electrophysiological activity was observed. Treatment with diltiazem resulted in a significant lengthening of sinus cycle length (SCL, p < 0.04), AH interval (p < 0.02), and Wenckebach CL (WCL, p < 0.001), and a trend towards an increase in sinus node recovery time (SNRT, p = 0.057). No effects were observed with regard to HV interval and corrected SNRT. The results of this study indicate that 10 mg intravenous amlodipine has no significant electrophysiological action on sinus or AV node function in patients receiving beta-blocker therapy with atenolol, suggesting that amlodipine can be added to beta-blockers to treat patients with myocardial ischemia and/or hypertension without any significant increase in the risk of bradyarrhythmias.", 
    "65": "Nitroglycerin (NTG) ointment is used for the prophylaxis against angina pectoris, but there are no data to support its effectiveness during long-term therapy. Continuous, once-daily application of isosorbide dinitrate cream produces tolerance with complete loss of efficacy within 1 week. Nitroglycerin patches are very popular and continuous once-daily application is still claimed by some investigators to provide 24 hour antiischemic and antianginal efficacy. This claim is based on data from postmarketing studies in a very large number of patients and placebo-controlled studies in smaller groups of patients from Italy, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Germany. In contrast, studies from the United States, Canada, England, and some centers in Germany have failed to show superiority of patches over placebo during continuous therapy. This controversy was addressed by the NTG cooperative study group, in which a total of 562 patients who were responders to sublingual nitroglycerin were studied. Patients received either placebo or NTG patches delivering low (15-30 mg/24 hr), moderate (45-60 mg/24 hr), or large (75 and 105 mg/24 hr) amounts of NTG. Four hours after the initial application, NTG patches increased exercise duration compared to placebo, but this beneficial effect had disappeared by 24 hours. Furthermore, after 8 weeks of continuous therapy, none of the NTG patches were superior to placebo, whether patients were or were not taking concomitant beta-blockers. Therefore, current opinion is that continuous therapy with NTG patches produces pharmacologic tolerance and is ineffective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Efficacy was determined based on daytime intraocular pressure curve and safety by examining visual fields, visual acuity, optic discs, by determining blood pressure and pulse rate, and by performing Schirmer and fluorescein tests. A total of 89 patients were enrolled, and 71 completed the 10-week treatment period. This study showed that the two combinations of 0.5% timolol maleate and 2% pilocarpine HCl compared in this study were equally effective in reducing intraocular pressure. The decrease in mean daily intraocular pressure from 0 to 10 weeks was 7.48 mmHg for Fotil, and 6.31 for Timpilo. The mean decrease in mean daily intraocular pressure was 29.3% for Fotil, and 26.0% for Timpilo. No significant differences were found between the groups. Adverse event were reported by 70 out of 89 patients by the end of 2 weeks, but were severe enough only in 11 for the treatment to be discontinued. In all others, adverse events were of transient nature and considered mild. In general, adverse events were similar in both study groups. However, burning was more common in patients on Fotil, and blurring of vision and light sensitivity were more common in patients on Timpilo. In patients with no contraindication to beta-blockers, these drugs appeared to be safe.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "In order to find out to which extent high-pass resolution perimetry would detect any changes in patients treated for glaucoma, resolution perimetry results were evaluated from 56 glaucoma patients and 15 untreated ocular hypertensive patients followed for 2 to 3 years. Fifty-nine of the 71 examined patients showed lower resolution thresholds, i.e. increased sensitivity, after 2 years, compared to initial values. The threshold decrease was significantly larger in the treated glaucoma patients (median 1.22 dB) than in the untreated ocular hypertensive patients (0.48 dB). The threshold decrease in the untreated ocular hypertensive group corresponds to the previously described learning effect. In 35 of the 56 treated glaucoma patients the thresholds improved more than 0.84 dB, the upper confidence limit in the untreated group, which may indicate a beneficial effect of antiglaucoma therapy in these patients. The threshold change was unrelated to initial resolution threshold and cannot be explained by a 'sorting' effect. The observations in the current study using resolution perimetry indicate that improved visual function can be demonstrated in many patients treated for early glaucoma, at least during the first 2 years of treatment.",

Desmethylimipramine shortened the circadian period (tau) by 0.1 hour. In contrast, clorgyline lengthened tau by 0.1 hour and delayed light-synchronized wheel-running rhythms by 1.4 hour. Phenelzine, fluoxetine, clonidine, and propranolol did not significantly alter light-entrained phase or free-running period over a range of doses. Other rhythm parameters were also unaffected by antidepressant or depressogenic drugs. These data suggest that mood-altering drugs do not consistently influence circadian rhythms in the hamster.",

Specific binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) to guinea pig left ventricular and lung membranes was saturable, and Scatchard and Hill analyses suggested that 3H-DHA bound to both membranes with a single population of binding sites with no binding site cooperativity. Addition of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (GppNHp, 30 microM) led to a rightward shift of the 3H-DHA binding displacement curves of T-0509 and Col in both membranes, and the degree of shift was similar to that of full agonists such as isoproterenol (Iso), adrenaline (Adr) and noradrenaline (NA). Both T-0509 and Col were thus considered to be full agonists at both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, respectively, unlike denopamine and procaterol. T-0509 and Col showed considerably high affinity for both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, and T-0509, like denopamine, was as selective for the beta 1-subtype as NA (4.5-fold compared with Iso as a non-selective agonist), whereas Col was more selective for the beta 2-subtype than Adr (4.5-fold compared with Iso).",

Esophageal varices also were found. Examination of the renal biopsy specimen revealed mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with IgA deposits. Propranolol was administered orally to reduce portal hypertension, resulting in a progressive decrease in urinary microalbumin excretion. This case suggests that portal hypertension is involved in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy in liver cirrhosis.",

Patients were randomized to receive either cilazapril 2.5-5 mg or atenolol 25-100 mg per day per day. Blood pressure before treatment was 147/99 and 148/99 mmHg in both groups respectively. At 1 year of treatment blood pressure was 132/86 and 131/85 mmHg in both groups of patients respectively. Treatment for one year with cilazapril resulted in a reduction in the media/lumen ratio of resistance arteries (150-400 microns lumen diameter) dissected from subcutaneous gluteal biopsies from 7.5 +/- 0.3% before treatment to 6.3 +/- 0.2% 1 year later (p < 0.05), still slightly but significantly larger (p < 0.05) than the media/lumen ratio of resistance arteries of normotensive controls (5.1 +/- 0.3%). In arteries from patients treated with atenolol there was no significant change with treatment (8.0 +/- 0.6% before and 8.1 +/- 0.5% after 1 year of treatment). Active wall tension responses to endothelin-1 were blunted in hypertensive patients and normalized in the cilazapril-treated patients, but were unchanged in those taking atenolol. Relaxation in response to acetylcholine of norepinephrine pre-contracted arteries was still significantly reduced after one year (< 0.05) in comparison to those of normotensive patients in the patients treated with atenolol, whereas they were not in those who had received cilazapril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "1. During heat exposure, rats secrete large amounts of saliva. Salivation started when body temperature exceeded 39 degrees C and was reduced by kininogen deficiency or by HOE 140, a bradykinin antagonist. This secretory response was associated with a partial depletion of glandular kallikrein from the submaxillary glands. The depletion was abolished by simultaneous treatment of the animals with an alpha- and a beta-adrenergic antagonist. During heat exposure, plasma levels of kininogens were reduced. 2. Pilocarpine and substance P induced a similar flow of saliva in normal and kininogen-deficient rats and released low amounts of kallikrein from salivary glands. Phenylephrine and isoproterenol induced a larger flow of saliva in normal rats than in kininogen-deficient rats. Both agents released large amounts of kallikrein in saliva but isoproterenol was only active at large doses. 3. During heat exposure, the blood content of submaxillary glands in normal as well as in kininogen-deficient rats increased as a function of the ambient temperature. This increase was suppressed by atropine and NG-nitro-L-arginine, a NO-synthase inhibitor, but was not modified by HOE 140. Simultaneously, a swelling of the glands and of the surrounding soft tissues occurred in normal but not in kininogen-deficient rats. Kallikrein was present in the edema fluid. 4. The kallikrein-kinin system would thus participate in heat-induced salivary secretion and kinins may be a factor responsible for electrolyte and water exchanges in the glands.", 
    "73": "Cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes have been utilized as a model for the study of the effect of variations in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ on the activity of phospholipase C, a key enzyme in agonist-stimulated signal transduction through the phosphoinositide pathway. Cells prelabelled with [3H]inositol were exposed to various agents in an attempt to modulate the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration and the formation of [3H]inositolphosphates (15-30 min) in the presence of Li+ was taken as a measure of phospholipase C activity. Not the basal but the endothelin-1 (10(-8) M) induced [3H]inositolphosphate production (15 min) was stimulated 1.54- and 1.43-fold by A23187 (10 microM external Ca2+) and 50 mM K+ (1.3 mM external Ca2+) treatment of cells, respectively. The phenylephrine (10(-4) M) induced response was also stimulated (1.35-fold) by A23187, however it was 43% inhibited by high K+. Ouabain (10 microM) treatment of cells did not affect either basal or agonist stimulated phosphoinositide turnover. On the other hand, total removal of external free Ca2+ by addition of 50 microM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) (N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid strongly inhibited (75%) the endothelin-1 induced but not the basal phospholipase C activity. Endothelin-1 binding to its receptor was shown not to be inhibited by the absence of external Ca2+ while resynthesis of [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was not rate-limiting under this condition. The lack of external Ca2+ eventually resulted in total standstill of the ET-1 induced PtdIns turnover after 30 min. Although not always as predicted, effects on basal and agonist-activated phospholipase C were observed too when cells were treated with low Ca2+ medium, Ca2+ entry blocker nifedipine (1 microM) or Ca(2+)-channel agonist Bay K8644 (1 microM) but most of these effects were only seen after 90 min incubation. Fluorometric (fura-2) measurements showed that total removal of external free Ca2+ for a short period decreased, while short exposure to high K+ increased cytoplasmic free Ca2+ but neither Ca2+ free buffer or nifedipine nor Bay K8644 had any effect. Furthermore, in saponin-permeabilized cardiomyocytes we could demonstrate that basal as well as GTP gamma S (30 microM) stimulated phospholipase C activity was strongly activated by free Ca2+ in the concentration range of 0.1-10 microM. We conclude that in the intact cardiomyocyte the signalling pathway through phospholipase C/phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, stimulated by agonist-receptor interaction that activates GTP-binding proteins as does GTP gamma S, is likely be a Ca2+ dependent process.",

This is defined as ventricular fibrillation occurring in the absence of detectable underlying heart disease or metabolic or electrolyte disturbance. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resulting from idiopathic ventricular fibrillation is uncommon. Records of all patients who underwent electrophysiological testing between June 1979 and June 1992 were reviewed. Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to idiopathic ventricular fibrillation were identified. Follow-up information was obtained by telephone interview in June 1992. Of 194 patients who underwent electrophysiological study after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest not associated with acute myocardial infarction, only six (4 male and 2 female) had idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. It was induced in only two patients by programmed ventricular stimulation. No sustained ventricular arrhythmias were induced in the remaining four patients. Four patients received implantable cardioverter defibrillators, one was treated with a beta-adrenergic blocker, and one received no treatment. All patients were alive at a mean follow-up of 50 months. Two of the four patients without inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmias had events during follow-up. Of the two patients with inducible ventricular fibrillation, one experienced a cardiac arrest and documented ventricular fibrillation at 41 months after the index event and the other had had no recurrence at 15-month follow-up.

We wished to define whether the cardiac changes of hyperthyroidism are attenuated by treatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol. Rats were treated with triiodothyronine (T3) [1 mg/kg/day subcutaneously (s.c.) for 14 days] together with oral atenolol (100 mg/day on days 8-14); physiological parameters, inotropic and chronotropic responses in isolated cardiac tissues to compounds that increase intracellular cyclic AMP, and ventricular beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors were measured. Administration of T3 produced marked hyperthyroidism, leading to increased metabolism, cardiac hypertrophy, tachycardia, hypertension, marked decrease in or loss of positive inotropic responses to calcium chloride, norepinephrine (NE), forskolin, and theophylline and increased ventricular beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor density. Atenolol treatment of hyperthyroid rats attenuated the increases in heart rate (HR), rectal temperature, and O2 consumption but did not alter cardiac hypertrophy, hypertension, decreased positive inotropic responses or increased beta-adrenoceptor density.

With 4 mM [K+]e, all four agents elicited significant, concentration-dependent ERP increases in the frequency range of 1-3 Hz, and all four agents displayed reverse frequency-dependent activity. Reverse frequency-dependent profiles also were demonstrable in 10 mM [K+]e at the higher test agent concentrations; dofetilide (10 and 30 nM), D-sotalol (100 microM), E-4031 (100 and 300 nM) and MK-499 (100 and 300 nM). All four agents displayed diminished ERP increases in increased versus normal [K+]e. Among individual test agents, however, there were differences in magnitudes of diminution of ERP increases observed in increased [K+]e: The activities of D-sotalol and MK-499 were better maintained in increased [K+]e than were those of dofetilide and E-4031. As a result of this differential sensitivity increased [K+]e, significant ERP increases were not demonstrable for dofetilide and E-4031 in simultaneous conditions of increased [K+]e and rapid pacing, whereas significant activities were maintained with D-sotalol and MK-499 in increased [K+]e throughout the 1-3 Hz range of pacing frequencies. However, the inherent tendency of myocardial refractoriness to increase in increased [K+]e, particularly at faster pacing frequencies, played a dominant role in determining the relationship between increased versus normal [K+]e posttreatment ERP in all Class III treatment groups. This frequency-dependent increment in refractoriness in increased [K+]e reflected in baseline ERP determined in 10 versus 4 mM [K+]e, respectively, at frequencies of 1 Hz (163 +/- 3 vs. 157 +/- 2 ms, p = 0.06), 2 Hz (146 +/- 3 vs. 134 +/- 2 ms, p < 0.01), and 3 Hz (134 +/- 2 vs. 112 +/- 2 ms, p < 0.01) tended to offset as well as minimize differences among the IKr blockers in diminution of activity observed in increased [K+]e.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "79": "Pulmonary hypertension in congestive heart failure causes medial hypertrophy in pulmonary vessels and thickening of the endothelial basement membrane. In this study, the functional consequences of such pulmonary vascular adaptations were evaluated. Heart failure was induced in dogs by rapid ventricular pacing (240 beats per minute) for 28 days, at which time left ventricular shortening fraction was decreased by 57% compared with that at baseline. Lung lobes from paced (n = 56) and control dogs (n = 68) were isolated and perfused with autologous blood. Total, arterial (Ra), and venous (Rv) vascular resistances were significantly increased and vascular capacitance decreased in lobes from paced animals compared with controls. Increments in Ra and Rv after intra-arterial boluses of norepinephrine were measured before and after sequential addition of the alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptor antagonists prazosin (16 mumol/L) and yohimbine (0.1 mumol/L) in the presence or absence of propranolol (5 mumol/L). Norepinephrine (1 to 40 micrograms) had little effect on Ra in the absence of propranolol, a pattern that persisted in control lobes after propranolol. However, when lobes from paced animals were pretreated with propranolol, norepinephrine increased Ra, Rv was increased after norepinephrine in control lobes, an effect that was enhanced in the paced group. In both groups, the increment in Rv was greater after propranolol. Irrespective of propranolol pretreatment, prazosin significantly attenuated, if not abolished, the response to norepinephrine. The enhancement in venous vascular reactivity in lobes from paced animals remained when venous pressure was elevated to 20 cm H2O. In control lobes under conditions of elevated tone or when endothelium-dependent relaxing factor was blocked, responses to norepinephrine did not mimic those observed in the paced group. Microvascular permeability, as measured by the capillary filtration coefficient, was not altered in the paced group. We conclude that the pulmonary adaptations to 4 weeks of rapid ventricular pacing include functional changes in pulmonary hemodynamics and vascular reactivity but not in microvascular permeability.",

It was hypothesized that differential innervation of the atria and ventricles by sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers may produce differential effects on heart rate and QT interval variabilities. Holter recordings of 12 male patients (age 63 +/- 7 years) with stable angina were analyzed before and after 3 weeks of nadolol therapy. The QT intervals were individually normalized by an exponential formula to study the circadian variation of QTc. Power spectra of RR and uncorrected QT intervals were obtained by fast-Fourier analysis from 256 consecutive sinus beats during the day at maximal heart rate and during the night at minimal heart rate. Frequency-specific variability was determined from areas under the spectral plots. Both heart rate and QTc exhibited significant circadian patterns (p < 0.01) in opposite phase with each other. Mean heart rate was significantly reduced with nadolol (81 +/- 12 vs 67 +/- 12 beats/min, p < 0.001), with greater reduction during daytime.

    "84": "The influence of beta-adrenoceptor ligands and a beta-adrenoceptor-derived peptide was studied on stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in membrane preparations of turkey erythrocytes. In the absence of receptor ligands, the hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogs, guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate and guanosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imino]triphosphate, caused a slow, time-dependent increase in adenylyl cyclase activity, which was accelerated and potentiated by the additional presence of the agonist, isoproterenol. In contrast, the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, propranolol and pindolol, almost completely prevented stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by the GTP analogs alone, i.e. in the absence of an agonist, in a concentration-dependent and stereo-selective manner. This antagonist action was mimicked by a peptide corresponding to the second cytoplasmic loop of the turkey erythrocyte beta-adrenoceptor. On the other hand, GTP analog-preactivated cyclase activity and enzyme stimulation by fluoride and forskolin were not or only slightly reduced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. The data presented suggest that in turkey erythrocyte membranes agonist-free beta-adrenoceptors can cause significant Gs protein and subsequent adenylyl cyclase activation, and that this unoccupied receptor action can be blocked by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, thus exhibiting by themselves a negative intrinsic activity.", 
    "85": "beta-Adrenergic blocking agents are used for the treatment of angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, anxiety attacks, thyrotoxicosis, migraine and glaucoma. Owing to their sedative effect, they are also used as doping agents in sport. All beta-blockers have an alkanol amine side chain terminating in a secondary amino group in their structure. The pKa values vary from 9.2 to 9.8. Because some beta-blockers are hydrophilic and some lipophilic, simultaneous determination is difficult. In this work, a method based on micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MECC) was developed for the separation and determination of beta-blockers in serum. The phosphate buffer 0.08 M (pH 6.7) solution contained 15 mM N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromide. Nine parent beta-blockers could be separated in a single run and the concentrations determined by internal standard (ephedrine) method. The simple clean-up procedure consisted of enzyme hydrolysis (Helix pomatia), protein precipitation, and filtration through 0.5-microns PTFE membranes.

    "86": "Epitope tagging and immunocytochemical techniques were used to examine the agonist-regulated internalization of human beta 2-adrenergic receptors in 293 cells. In the absence of agonist, receptors tagged with monoclonal antibody remain in the plasma membrane for > 1 h. In the presence of agonist, tagged receptors are endocytosed within 10 min. Endocytosed receptors are located in endosomes and can be recycled to the plasma membrane. In the prolonged presence of agonist, receptor endocytosis continues even after maximum sequestration of surface receptors (measured by radioligand binding to intact cells) has occurred. The process of receptor endocytosis requires cellular ATP and is temperature-dependent. At 4 degrees C, no agonist-induced redistribution of receptors located in the plasma membrane is observed. At 16 degrees C, agonist causes receptors to cluster in and around coated invaginations of the plasma membrane, but receptor endocytosis does not occur. Agonist treatment of cells at 16 degrees C, but not 4 degrees C, predisposes receptors to agonist-independent endocytosis upon warming to 37 degrees C. These studies suggest that: 1) beta 2-adrenergic receptors reside stably in the plasma membrane of untreated cells, while they continuously cycle between the plasma membrane and endosomes in the presence of agonist; 2) agonist regulates an early step in the endocytosis mechanism, which is associated with the redistribution of adrenergic receptors between distinct microdomains of the plasma membrane; and 3) later steps in the endocytosis mechanism do not require agonist and may utilize the same endocytic machinery that mediates the endocytosis of constitutively recycling receptors.",

A hydrochlorothiazide dosage of 6.25 mg/d produced significantly less hypokalemia and less of an increase in uric acid levels than a dosage of 25 mg/d. The low-dose combination of bisoprolol, 2.5 mg/d, and hydrochlorothiazide, 6.25 mg/d, reduced diastolic blood pressure to lower than 90 mm Hg in 61% of patients and demonstrated a safety profile that compared favorably with that of placebo.", 
    "90": "The utility of factorial design trials to characterize dose-response relationships and to test the potential interactions between various antihypertensive agents has been demonstrated. The combination of low dosages of bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide may be a rational alternative to conventional stepped-care therapy for the initial treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "91": "The effect of co-administration of MAO inhibitors together with a low dose of the neurotoxic amphetamine p-chloroamphetamine (pCA) on neurotoxicity was examined. Neurotoxicity was assessed by measuring decreases in the binding of [3H]cyanoimipramine to serotonin uptake sites using quantitative autoradiography. By itself, a low dose of pCA (2 mg/kg) did not produce any alterations in radioligand binding, measured 7 days after drug administration. However, co-administration of the MAO-B selective inhibitor deprenyl (1 mg/kg) or the non-selective inhibitor pargyline (50 mg/kg) produced significant decreases in radioligand binding. Measurements of the effects of these drugs on body temperature ruled out the possibility that deprenyl and pargyline were increasing neurotoxicity by producing a drug-induced hyperthermia. In contrast to the effects of deprenyl and pargyline, co-administration of the MAO-A selective inhibitor clorgyline (1 mg/kg) did not alter binding. By themselves none of the MAO inhibitors produced neurotoxic effects. There are a number of possible explanations for these results. Administration of deprenyl or pargyline, together with pCA, itself a MAO-A inhibitor, will lead to inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. This will likely lead to an enhanced release of dopamine and serotonin compared with the release following administration of pCA alone or pCA together with clorgyline. Elevation of the extracellular levels of either or both of these monoamines could lead to enhanced neurotoxicity. Whatever the mechanism involved, our results show that the co-administration of a type-B MAOI enhances the neurotoxic effects of pCA on serotonin neurons.", 
    "92": "Sotalol is a novel antiarrhythmic agent combining beta-adrenergic-antagonist actions with the ability to increase cardiac repolarization and refractoriness. The drug's electrophysiologic and clinical profile is different from that of conventional beta-receptor antagonists. As compared with other antiarrhythmic agents, sotalol prevents recurrences of arrhythmia in a higher proportion of patients, particularly among those presenting with ventricular tachycardia and aborted sudden cardiac death. The net hemodynamic effect of sotalol is the result of a balance between the depressant effects due to beta-receptor blockade and an action that tends to increase contractility. Although initially marketed in the United States for treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, sotalol also has demonstrated efficacy in many patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. As with all drugs that prolong the QT interval, the syndrome of torsade de pointes is a serious potential adverse effect.", 
    "93": "The beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties of vaninolol ((+/-)4-[4'-(2-hydroxy-3-tert-butyl-aminopropoxy)-3'-methoxyphenyl]- 3-buten-2-one), derived from vanillin, were first investigated under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Vaninolol (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 mg/kg, i.v.), as well as propranolol, produced a dose-dependent bradycardia response and a sustained pressor action in urethane-anesthetized normotensive rats. Vaninolol inhibited the tachycardia effects induced by (-)isoproterenol, but had no blocking effect on the arterial pressor responses induced by phenylephrine. These findings suggested that vaninolol possessed beta-adrenergic blocking activity, but was without alpha-adrenergic blocking activity. In isolated guinea-pig tissues, vaninolol antagonized (-)isoproterenol-induced positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of the atria and tracheal relaxation responses in a concentration-dependent manner. The parallel shift to the right of the concentration-response curve of (-)isoproterenol suggested that vaninolol was a beta-adrenoceptor competitive antagonist. The effect of vaninolol was more potent on the atria than on tracheal tissues, indicating it had some beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity. On the other hand, the order of the hydrophilicity was atenolol > vaninolol > propranolol. In addition, vaninolol had a mild direct cardiac depression at high concentrations and was without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). Furthermore, binding characteristics of vaninolol and other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were evaluated in [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to guinea-pig ventricular membranes. The order of potency of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in competing for the binding sites was (-)propranolol > vaninolol > or = atenolol. In conclusion, vaninolol was found to be a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with relatively low lipophilicity in comparison with propranolol, devoid of ISA, and had a mild myocardial depressant effect.", 
    "94": "In the marine mollusc, Hermissenda crassicornis, Type B photoreceptors exhibit an IPSP to both presynaptic hair cell stimulation and microapplication of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to the terminal branches. It was found that both the endogenous IPSP and the response to exogenously applied GABA were mediated to a large part by an outward current which reversed at approximately -80 mV. Additionally, these hyperpolarizing responses were found to mask a smaller depolarization that was mediated by the reduction of a basal outward current. Both the IPSP and the hyperpolarizing response to GABA, as well as the sublimated depolarizing response to GABA, were attenuated by the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) and displayed a strong sensitivity to [K+]o, while showing no sensitivity to [Cl-]o or the Cl- channel blocker picrotoxin. Moreover, iontophoretic injections of stable guanine analogues, GTP[gamma S] and GDP[beta S], into B photoreceptors eliminated both the IPSP and the GABA-induced hyperpolarization, while cholinergically mediated, interphotoreceptor interactions were unaffected. These results suggest that the endogenous receptor is at least partially homologous to the mammalian GABAB class receptor. Consistent with this classification, microapplication of selective GABAB receptor agonist baclofen onto the terminal region of the B photoreceptor resulted in a hyperpolarizing response that was qualitatively similar to that of GABA, although the GABAA agonist muscimol was also active, but less so than either GABA or baclofen. Attempts to block the endogenous IPSP or GABA-induced hyperpolarization by bath application of the GABAA receptor subtype antagonist bicuculline was ineffective and the GABAB receptor subtype antagonist saclofen was only weakly effective. These data demonstrate that the presynaptic hair cell's influence on postsynaptic B photoreceptors is in many respects similar to GABAB mediated responses in the mammalian CNS. This receptor is in some respects unique, however, in terms of its cross-sensitivity to both GABAA and GABAB agonists, its weak sensitivity to saclofen, and its apparent anomalous modulation of multiple K+ conductances.", 
    "95": "The efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs for terminating sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) has been disappointing. Lignocaine is the traditional drug but it is not very effective. Sotalol, one of the most effective drugs in suppressing spontaneous or induced VT, should theoretically be useful in this setting. We have compared lignocaine with sotalol for the acute termination of spontaneous sustained VT not causing cardiac arrest in 33 patients (26 males, 7 females, aged 21-90) whose underlying heart disease was old myocardial infarction (28), acute myocardial infarction (2), dilated cardiomyopathy (1), or idiopathic cardiomyopathy (2). Left-ventricular ejection fraction was 35% (range 18-76%). Patients were randomly allocated in a double-blind fashion to lignocaine 100 mg (n = 17) or sotalol 100 mg (n = 16) given intravenously over 5 min. Those with persistent VT 15 min after onset of administration of the first drug were crossed over to the other drug. Sotalol was significantly more effective than lignocaine whether analysed on an intention-to-treat basis (69% vs 18%; 95% confidence interval for absolute difference of 51% 22-80%, p = 0.003) or by analysis limited to the 31 patients with subsequent electrophysiologically proven VT (69% vs 20%). 1 patient in each group required cardioversion after the first drug. Tachycardia persisted in 14 patients in the lignocaine group and 4 in the sotalol group after 15 min. Tachycardia ceased in 7 (50%) patients who crossed over to sotalol, and in 1 patient who crossed over to lignocaine. There was 1 death in each group after the first drug and 1 death after both drugs. We conclude that sotalol was superior to lignocaine for the acute termination of sustained VT. The incidence of adverse effects was similar for the two drugs.", 
    "96": "The effects of electrical stimulation of the peripheral cut ends of the ascending cervical sympathetic trunk on vasomotor, particularly vasodilator, response were studied in relation to salivary secretion in the cat submandibular gland. The vasodilator and salivary responses were compared by stimulating the peripheral cut ends of the sympathetic nerve at various intensities (1-8 V), durations (5-60 s) and frequencies (1-100 Hz) using a 2 ms pulse duration. Electrical stimulation of the cervical sympathetic nerves caused vasoconstriction followed by vasodilatation and salivation. There were certain differences in the maximal responses of vasodilatation and salivation during sympathetic stimulation. For example, optimal frequencies for vasodilatation and salivation were 10 Hz and 20 Hz, respectively. Time-dependent increases in vasodilatation and salivary secretion were seen for periods of up to 30 s and 60 s, respectively. The volume of salivation was not necessarily correlated with the magnitude of vasodilator response. Prior treatment with an alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent phentolamine largely reduced vasoconstriction (P < 0.01) and almost completely abolished salivary secretion (P < 0.01), but had only a slight inhibitory effect on vasodilatation (0.1 < P < 0.05). Propranolol (a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent) pretreatment significantly decreased vasodilatation (P < 0.05) but had no statistically significant effect on vasoconstriction or salivation. Scopolamine (a muscarinic cholinoceptor blocking agent) had no effect on the responses followed by sympathetic nerve stimulation but abolished the vagal mediated reflex salivation, indicating that the salivation, but not vasodilatation, elicited by activation of the afferent fibers of the vagus nerve is mediated via parasympathetic muscarinic fibers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "97": "The existence of subjective symptoms arising from high blood pressure (BP) remains controversial. Few studies have been performed which compare symptoms of hypertensives and normotensives. The results of these studies are inconsistent. The present study investigates the intensities and prevalences of symptoms of hypertensives and normotensives and the relationship between symptoms and BP for both groups. During a 30-day period, 45 patients with primary hypertension and 45 normotensive controls documented BPs and intensities of 13 symptoms daily as well as mood and life satisfaction weekly. Starting on day 3 hypertensives received beta-blocker therapy (bopindolol, 1 mg/day). The BP values of the hypertensives normalized during the study, while the BPs of the normotensives did not change. At the beginning, hypertensives showed higher prevalences and intensities of the symptoms and poorer mood and life satisfaction. After normalization of BP, hypertensives attained scores similar to those of normotensives in all measured categories. Calculating within-S correlations between symptom intensities and systolic BPs, 70% of the hypertensives, but only 27% of the normotensives, showed at least one significant correlation. The differences observed between untreated hypertensives and the normotensive control group with respect to the prevalence and intensity of symptoms provide convincing evidence that untreated hypertensives are by no means symptom-free. The within-S correlations of the present study documented well the close relationship between symptoms and actual BP for a percentage of hypertensives."
