    "0": "Recent studies have suggested that secretin, like glucose, stimulates a rapid insulin response from a small storage pool. In order to evaluate the mechanism of the secretin-stimulated insulin response, small (15 U) rapidly administered intravenous injections (pulses) of secretin were given before, during, and after a 20 hr 300 mg/min glucose infusion. Contrary to previous studies demonstrating that the acute insulin response to a small (5 g) pulse of glucose given 45 min after the start of the glucose infusion was significantly diminished compared to the response to the preinfusion pulse, the acute insulin response (2-5 min Deltaimmuno-reactive insulin muU/ml) to 15-U secretin pulses exhibited a greater than twofold increase (before: 31.1+/-15.4; during: 71.2+/-40.4, muU/ml, mean +/-SD, P < 0.02). The increased response to secretin was also found after 20 hr of continuous glucose infusion, but was not observed 1 hr after cessation of the infusion when plasma glucose levels returned to control values. Thus, this increased response to secretin was glucose dependent. Four 150-U secretin pulses given at 30 min intervals elicited progressively and significantly diminished acute insulin responses with each succeeding pulse, consistent with depletion of the small storage pool. Similar to the observation that the magnitude of the insulin response to secretin was glucose dependent, the glucose-stimulated output appeared to be secretin dependent. Thus the acute insulin response to 5 g glucose was increased after secretin pretreatment (presecretin: 34.9+/-14.8; postsecretin: 50.5+/-22.5 muU/ml. P < 0.02) which suggests that secretin may either enlarge the storage pool stimulated by glucose or increase its sensitivity. The effect of epinephrine and propranolol on acute insulin responses to secretin and glucose was also different. 15-U secretin pulses were unaffected by infusions of either epinephrine (pre: 31.6+/-17.9; during: 27.8+/-16.6 muU/ml) or propranolol (pre: 12.8+/-8.4; during: 10.7+/-5.5 muU/ml). The results of these studies indicate that although both glucose and secretin stimulate a rapid insulin response, these responses are easily differentiated. The data suggest that glucose and secretin stimulate functionally separate storage pools of insulin, but that the acute response to either stimulus is partly determined by exposure to the other.", 
    "1": "1. AH 5158 differs from conventional adrenoceptor blocking drugs in producing competitive blockade of both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors.2. AH 5158 is 5-18 times less potent than propranolol in blocking beta-adrenoceptors. It resembles propranolol in its non-selective blockade of beta(1)-cardiac and beta(2)-vascular and tracheal adrenoceptors and in its lack of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.3. AH 5158 is 2-7 times less potent than phentolamine in blocking alpha-adrenoceptors. AH 5158 itself is more active on beta- than alpha-adrenoceptors.4. Blockade of noradrenaline vasopressor responses by AH 5158 in anaesthetized dogs was dose-dependent up to 1 mg/kg but no further blockade was obtained with larger doses of AH 5158. ;Self-limiting' blockade was not observed in dogs pretreated with cocaine, or in untreated dogs if the vasopressor agent was oxymetazoline instead of noradrenaline. A possible cause of ;self-limiting' blockade is discussed.5. In doses higher than those required for either alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor blockade, AH 5158 produced effects on cardiac muscle that are attributable to membrane-stabilizing activity. This was manifested as a negative inotropic action in spinal dogs and in guinea-pig left atrial strips, as a negative chronotropic action in syrosingopine pre-treated dogs, and as an increase in the effective refractory period of guinea-pig left atrial strips. AH 5158 was 3-11 times less potent than propranolol in these tests.6. In open chest dogs AH 5158 resembled propranolol in reducing cardiac output, rate and contractility, effects which are attributable to beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The drug differed from propranolol in decreasing rather than increasing total peripheral resistance and in causing larger decreases in arterial blood pressure at equipotent beta-adrenoceptor blocking doses. These differences are attributable to the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking actions of AH 5158.7. In anaesthetized dogs, intravenously administered AH 5158 antagonized both catecholamine and ouabain-induced arrhythmias. Orally administered AH 5158 lowered systolic arterial pressure in conscious renal hypertensive dogs.8. These results show AH 5158 to possess a novel profile of activity. Possible uses of the drug in cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension, angina pectoris and cardiac arrhythmias are discussed.", 
    "2": "Studies were performed in healthy volunteers to determine the effects of catecholamines and adrenergic-blocking agents on plasma and urinary levels of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP). Plasma cyclic AMP rose in response to infusions of the beta-adrenergic agent, isoproterenol, or in response to infusions of either epinephrine or norepinephrine alone or in combination with the alpha-adrenergic-blocking agent, phentolamine. Although urinary cyclic AMP also rose, the percentage increase was less than that observed in the plasma. These treatments caused no increase in plasma cyclic GMP. Plasma cyclic GMP rose in response to infusions of alpha-adrenergic agents, viz., epinephrine or norepinephrine infused together with the beta-blocking agent, propranolol. These treatments caused no increase in plasma cyclic AMP. These observations are consistent with the current concept that the actions of beta-adrenergic agents are mediated by increases in cyclic AMP formation in target tissues. Such a mediating role has not been established for cyclic GMP, but the data suggest the possibility that cyclic GMP metabolism is responsive either to alpha-adrenergic stimulation or to parasympathetic stimulation which occurs as a reflexive consequence of the pressor effect of alpha-adrenergic agents.", 
    "3": "Activity of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.5) in rat pineal organ is rapidly and markedly elevated in vivo after administration of beta-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-L-alanine (L-DOPA), norepinephrine, epinephrine, isoproterenol, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or theophylline. Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptophan has no effect on the increase in activity of this enzyme. Inhibitors of protein synthesis or propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent completely inhibit(s) the increase in activity of serotonin N-acetyltransferase induced by drugs, indicating that new enzyme molecules are formed via stimulation of beta-receptors of pineal cells and adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. When rat pineal organ is denervated by ganglionectomy, beta-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-L-alanine induces much more serotonin N-acetyltransferase than in the innervated gland. This superinduction by denervation appears to be due to changes of the postsynaptic site, probably the beta-adrenergic receptor on the pineal cell.", 
    "4": "The anxiety-reducing effects of minor tranquilizers in the rat conflict test were mimicked by serotonin antagonists and by p-chlorophenylalanine, an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis; the depressant effects of the minor tranquilizers were mimicked by norepinephrine antagonists. Intraventricular injections of serotonin led to a suppression of behavior, and also antagonized the anxiety-reducing action of benzodiazeprines. Intraventricular injections of norepinephrine led to a release of punished behavior from suppression, and also antagonized the depressant action of benzodiazepines. The anxiety-reducing activity, and the decrease in serotonin turnover induced by benzodiazepines, were maintained over repeated doses, whereas depressant activity, and the decrease induced in norepinephrine turnover, both rapidly underwent tolerance. Tranquilizers may exert their anxiety-reducing effects by a reduction of serotonin activity in a behaviorally suppressive punishment system, and they may exert their depressant effects by a reduction of norepinephrine activity in a behaviorally facilitatory reward system.", 
    "5": "Of 74 patients seen within 30 minutes of the onset of acute myocardial infarction 68 (92%) had signs of autonomic imbalance. Excessive vagal activity was evident in 41 (55%) and there was sympathetic overactivity in 27 (36%). The high incidence of sudden death in the acute phase of a coronary attack probably results from the electrical imbalance caused by autonomic disturbance. This disturbance must therefore be taken into account in any prophylactic regimen against the lethal early ventricular dysrhythmias.", 
    "6": "No unequivocal central effects were found with either +/--propranolol (120 mg) or +/--sotalol (240 mg) in acute dosage in normal subjects. Subjective feelings of drowsiness and muzziness were found with sotalol and both sotalol and propranolol caused subjects to feel more troubled. These changes were not accompanied by physiological or behavioural evidence of sedation. Adequate beta-adrenoceptor blockade was achieved as measured by a significant fall in pulse-rate on both active drugs but no other significant peripheral physiological changes occurred.", 
    "7": "1. The relative activities of a large number of sympathomimetic amines were estimated on the beta-adrenoceptors of the guinea-pig tracheal chain preparation. Concentrations which produced half-maximal responses were measured for each drug and the maximum responses were also noted and expressed as a percentage of that produced by isoprenaline.2. The relative activities of the amines generally decrease with loss of hydroxyl groups from the structure, and amines with less than two hydroxyl groups produce little or no observable response.3. The affinity constants of the partial agonists and antagonists were measured. The hydroxyl group on the beta carbon atom of the side chain, N-alkyl groups and an alpha carbon methyl group increase affinity, whereas the p-phenolic group decreases affinity. The m-phenolic group does not seem to affect affinity.4. By comparing the effects of groups on affinity with their effects on activity, it was deduced that N-alkyl groups, m- and p-phenolic groups and probably also the beta carbon hydroxyl group increase efficacy. Alpha carbon methylation appears to reduce efficacy.", 
    "8": "1. Uteri were removed from rats 0.5 h to 8 days after parturition and were suspended in Locke solution at 37 degrees C.2. The agonists isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline and phenylephrine produced an inhibition of the post-partum rat uterus.3. In the presence of propranolol, the agonists noradrenaline, adrenaline, and phenylephrine had an excitatory effect on the post-partum rat uterus. This excitatory effect was blocked by phenoxybenzamine indicating that it is mediated through alpha-adrenoceptors.4. These excitatory alpha-adrenoceptors could be demonstrated for 5-6 days after parturition. By the 7th-8th days their existence was no longer apparent.5. Excitatory alpha-adrenoceptors were also demonstrated in the late pregnant rat uterus.", 
    "9": "1. The influence of feeding 2 levels of sotalol on the incidence of beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN)-induced aortic ruptures of immature turkeys was determined.2. Four of 22 turkeys fed 0.12% sotalol and 0.07% BAPN died of aortic ruptures, but 6 of 21 turkeys fed only BAPN died of the syndrome.3. Blood pressure, heart rate, aortic tensile strength, and aortic structure as seen by light- and electron-microscope were similar in turkeys fed BAPN alone or both BAPN and 0.12% sotalol concurrently.4. In a second experiment, 13 of 24 turkeys fed 0.7% BAPN alone died of aortic ruptures, but only 2 of 24 turkeys fed BAPN and 0.2% sotalol concurrently died of the disease.5. Aortic tensile strength was lower, heart rate was faster, alterations of aortic elastic fibres as seen by light- and electron-microscope were more severe, and aortic salt soluble collagen with a higher amino acid content was increased in turkeys fed only BAPN, as compared to turkeys fed both BAPN and 0.2% sotalol."
