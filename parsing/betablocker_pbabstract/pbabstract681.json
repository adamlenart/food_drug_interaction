    "0": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of anesthesia, body position, and blood volume expansion on baroreflex control of heart rate. Five male rhesus monkeys (7.0-10.5 kg) were given bolus injection of 4.0 micrograms/kg phenylephrine during each of the following situations: awake sitting, anesthetized (AN) (10 mg/kg ketamine-HCl) sitting, AN recumbent, AN 90 degrees head down tilt, and AN 50% blood volume expansion with normal saline. beta-Receptor blockade was also performed on each treatment after anesthesia. Four additional animals were similarly treated after 20% blood volume expansion. R-R interval was plotted against systolic aortic pressure, and the slope was determined by linear regression. Baroreflex slope was significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced by 90 degrees head down tilt and 50% volume expansion both before and after beta-receptor blockade. A similar trend was seen after 20% volume expansion. These data are consistent with the thesis that baroreflex control of heart rate is reduced by central blood volume shifts.", 
    "1": "Continuous intra-arterial blood pressure recordings have been performed in 37 untreated ambulatory hypertensive subjects, who were investigated on an outpatient basis. Hourly data analysis demonstrated a circadian variation of both blood pressure and heart rate which were highest during the morning and fell during the late afternoon to reach a nadir during sleep. Prior to waking there was an increase in blood pressure, but not heart rate; however both blood pressure and heart rate increased briskly shortly after waking. Chronic therapy with oxprenolol (in 10 patients) reduced daytime blood pressure, but had little effect during the night-time or early morning.", 
    "2": "Comparisons between tonography results confirm an almost identical action of timolol and diamox: With both, the intraocular pressure and the minute volume of aqueous flow are significantly reduced, while the resistance to the aqueous outflow remains unchanged. In a consecutive tonometric study it was proved that timolol, when fully developed, inhibits the pressure-lowering effect of diamox (500 mg i.v.) when applied two hours before the latter. Thus the action of timolol is not additive but rather substitutive to the action of diamox. Its maximal pressure-lowering effect corresponds to the half of the aqueous outflow-pressure gradient.", 
    "3": "The effects of low concentrations of ethanol on transmembrane potentials of guinea pig ventricular muscle were analyzed. Papillary muscles were superfused with Tyrode solution in vitro at 30 degree C while driven at 60 min-1. Transmembrane potentials were recorded by means of intracellular microelectrodes before, during and after a 15 min exposure to ethanol. Ethanol 2,5 mg/100 ml (0.55mM) did not affect transmembrane potentials. Ethanol 5 mg/100 ml enhanced the amplitude of the action potential (AAP) without affecting the membrane resting potential (MRP) and the maximum velocity of the upstroke (dV/dt). Ethanol 40 mg/100 ml also enhanced AAP without modifying MRP and dV/dt. Verapamil and propranolol blocked the augmenting effect of ethanol on AAP. Ethanol 40 mg/100 ml also enhanced the amplitude of responses restored by norepinephrine in fibers depolarized by high [K]0 to a level of resting potential at which the fast component of the upstroke was abolished. The enhancement of AAP was accompanied by a shift of the plateau to more positive values, but the duration of the action potential measured at 50% of repolarization was not affected. The results indicate that ethanol in low concentrations augments, through a catechol-mediated effect, the slow component of the upstroke of ventricular action potentials.", 
    "4": "1 Cardiovascular responses to intravenous prizidilol hydrochloride (SK&F 92657) 0.86 mg/kg were studied in eight supine resting healthy volunteers. Five subjects were slow and the remaining three were fast acetylators of sulphamethazine. Compared with pre-infusion values, mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced, while mean resting pulse rate was significantly increased at 30 min after the start of the twenty minute infusion. 2 During the 6 h study period the lowest mean +/- s.e. mean systolic blood pressure (108.8 +/- 1.7) was recorded 30 min after the start of the infusion. This represented a mean reduction of 5.2 mmHg. Reductions in mean diastolic blood pressure were greater and of longer duration, the lowest mean value (44.8 +/- 2.0 mmHg) being recorded 3.5 h after the start of the infusion and representing a reduction of 18.5 mmHg from the pre-dosing value. At 6 h after the start of the infusion mean diastolic blood pressure was still significantly reduced (by 15.3 mmHg). 3 The maximum mean +/- s.e. mean resting pulse rate (79.3 +/- 4.4 beats/min) occurred 3 h after the start of the infusion, an increase of 23.0 beats/min over the pre-infusion value. At the end of the study the pulse rate was still significantly raised (by 17.7 beats/min). 4 The left ventricular ejection fraction, evaluated in five subjects, 45 min after the start of the infusion, was not altered by prizidilol hydrochloride, but the left ventricular area decreased significantly. 5 Intravenous prizidilol hydrochloride decreases resting blood pressure and left ventricular area, increases pulse rate and has virtually no effect on left ventricular ejection fraction.", 
    "5": "1 The pharmacological effects and plasma levels of diacetolol, the major human metabolite of acebutolol, were measured in a double-blind, balanced study in which five healthy men received single oral doses of diacetolol 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg, or placebo, at weekly intervals. 2 Resting and exercise heart rate (HR), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), resting and exercise peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and plasma concentrations of diacetolol were determined at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h after each treatment. 3 Diacetolol caused a slight dose-related reduction in resting HR and a substantial dose-related reduction in exercise HR. AT the same time it was found that diacetolol had no significant effects on FEV1 and resting and exercise PEFR. 4 Mean highest observed plasma concentrations (ng/ml) of diacetolol were 177 at a mean of 4.4 h after the 100 mg dose, 243 at 4.0 h after the 200 mg dose, 807 at 5.2 h after the 400 mg dose, and 1,306 at 4.4 h after the 800 mg dose. 5 Using the mean data, there was a strong correlation (r = 0.90) between % reduction in exercise HR and the logarithm of the plasma concentration of diacetolol. 6 Diacetolol exhibits marked cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity in man which is still evident 24 h after the administration of the higher doses of the drug. No adverse effects on pulmonary function could be detected.", 
    "6": "1 This study aimed (1) to measure the whole blood to plasma (WB:P) and red blood cell to plasma (RBC:P) concentration ratios of propranolol in healthy volunteers and two types of patients, and (2) to compare the concentration ratios of the lipophilic drug propranolol with moderately lipophilic pindolol and hydrophilic atenolol. 2 There was no significant difference between the WB:P and RBC:P ratios of propranolol concentration in healthy volunteers and neurological patients compared with hypertensive patients. The mean +/- s.d. WB:P ratios of propranolol concentration in the three groups were 0.74 +/- 0.03, 0.71 +/- 0.05, and 0.76 +/- 0.08 respectively. The mean RBC:P ratios were 0.39 +/- 0.08, 0.36 +/- 0.11, and 0.47 +/- 0.15 respectively. WB:P and RBC:P concentration ratios of propranolol were linearly correlated with the free fraction of drug in plasma. Propranolol was 90% bound in plasma. 3 The mean WB:P and RBC:P ratios of pindolol in seven volunteers were 0.69 +/- 0.08 and 0.37 +/- 0.14 respectively. Pindolol was 71.4 +/- 8.6% bound to plasma proteins. The concentration of pindolol in the RBC was linearly correlated with that unbound in plasma. 4 In four healthy volunteers, the mean WB:P concentration ratio of atenolol was 1.07 +/- 0.25 and the mean RBC:P ratio was 1.15 +/- 0.55. 5 The similarity of the RBC:free plasma drug concentration ratios for all three drugs suggests that the use of organic solvent partition coefficients for the prediction of in vivo distribution may be unreliable.", 
    "7": "1 We have observed the effects of intravenous prenalterol (1 mg and 2 mg) on ventricular performance, assessed by radionuclide ventriculography, in nine patients with ischaemic heart disease with varying degrees of impairment of ventricular performance. In seven of these patients the effects of prenalterol were compared with those of isoprenaline infused at 1 microgram/min. 2 Prenalterol caused no significant increase in heart rate, but systolic blood pressure increased by 26% (P less than 0.002). In contrast, isoprenaline caused heart rate to increase by 22% (P less than 0.02) and diastolic blood pressure to fall by 9% (P less than 0.01). 3 Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) increased with both drugs, but the increase was greater with isoprenaline, as was the fall in the ratio mean ejection time: left ventricular ejection time, which is an index of improved ventricular performance. 4 Because of the increased heart rate and stroke volume produced by isoprenaline, cardiac output increased 45% above control values (P less than 0.001), but the increase in cardiac output after prenalterol did not reach statistical significance. 5 In three patients with very poor ventricular function (LVEF less than 0.30) prenalterol had little effect on ejection fraction, and caused increased regional ventricular dyskinesia. 6 The increase in systolic blood pressure, and therefore cardiac afterload brought about by prenalterol may limit ventricular response. The response might be enhanced by the addition of vasodilator therapy.", 
    "8": "When morphine is instilled directly into the ventromedial hypothalamus of rats there is a latent period followed by a prolonged bout of feeding. This enhanced activity may be mediated by the release of norepinephrine; for morphine-induced feeding was depressed by the alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker phentolamine. Several neurotransmitter agonists and antagonists failed to duplicate this action: propranolol, serotonin, methysergide, apomorphine and haloperidol were ineffective in modifying ingestion elicited after morphine. Unlike apomorphine, dopamine augmented morphine's feeding effect. This difference may exist because dopamine acts as a precursor for norepinephrine formation in local ventromedial hypothalamic neurons.", 
    "9": "Schild regressions in isolated tissues are powerful tools for receptor classification only if they yield equillibrium dissociation constants of antagonists which can, in turn, occur only when measurements are made under equillbrium conditions. Regressions with slopes different from unity of nonlinear regressions indicate noncompliance to equillbrium. This paper describes a condition whereby Schild regressions apparently comply with criteria which signify equillbrium conditions but in fact are regressions obtained at nonequilibrium steady states yielding significant underestimations of the potency of the antagonist. Specifically, if agonist uptake processes in isolated tissues are inhibited by uptake inhibitors with receptor blocking properties, the experimental data and a theoretical model suggest that the resulting Schild regression will be linear, have a slope of unity and be shifted to the right of the true Schild regression, thereby significantly underestimating antagonist potency. Experiments with the effects of neuronal uptake inhibition (with desmethylimipramine and amitriptylene) on the phentolamine-inhibition of norepinephrine responses in rat anococcygeus muscle and the effects of metanephrine on the propranolol-inhibition of isoproterenol relaxation of guinea-pig trachea provided data to compare to a theoretical model. The data and the model help define the selectivity of the uptake inhibitor fo uptake over receptors needed to achieve steady states approaching true equilibrium, a condition required for satisfactory estimation of antagonist potency.", 
    "10": "In a double-blind, cross-over trial, 37 hypertensive patients were treated in random order, after a 4-week run-in period, with 100 mg atenolol in a single daily dose, or 250 mg methyldopa three times daily (or 500 mg three times daily in case of poor response). Both therapeutic regimens significantly reduced blood pressure (13/13 mmHg for atenolol and 17/10 mmHg for methyldopa) in an erect position. The higher dose of methyldopa gave a further significant reduction only for the systolic standing blood pressure. No statistical difference was found between the antihypertensive activity of the two drugs, but atenolol reduced heart rate more than did methyldopa. Side effects occurred more frequently during methyldopa administration and most often during the first days of treatment. During exercise (treadmill test) the two drugs induced the same antihypertensive response, but atenolol provoked a greater reduction of exercise tachycardia. Whereas total oxygen consumption was not affected by the two drugs, atenolol induced a much greater reduction of the myocardial oxygen consumption evaluated by the product of the systolic blood pressure X heart rate. These findings show that atenolol at the 100-mg daily dose is as effective as the full dosage of methyldopa and in addition shows better tolerance, a simpler therapeutic scheme, and less incidence of side effects.", 
    "11": "Six healthy subjects were treated with 100 mg atenolol. After a therapy-free interval of 4 wk the same subjects received the same dose of atenolol with furosemide, 40 mg, with calcium (as the lactate gluconate and carbonate), 500 mg, or with aluminum hydroxide, 5.6 gm. Atenolol alone and in combination was administered first as a single oral dose; a long-term 6-day treatment began 48 hr later. Addition of furosemide did not influence atenolol kinetics, but aluminum hydroxide led to an insignificant reduction (P greater than 0.05) of mean peak plasma levels of about 20% and of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC -infinity) from 5818 to 4353 ng ml-1 hr (P greater than 0.05). Calcium altered atenolol kinetics distinctly mean peak plasma levels of atenolol fell 51% (P less than 0.001), AUC0-infinity fell from 5818 to 3935 ng ml-1 hr (P less than 0.01) and elimination half-life (t1/2) increased to a mean of 11.0 hr (compared to 6.2 hr with atenolol alone). The prolongation of t1/2 induced by calcium coadministration led to atenolol cumulation during the long-term dosage. Twelve hours after atenolol, 100 mg, and calcium, 500 mg, exercise tachycardia was lower than with atenolol alone (P less than 0.001). During the 4-wk treatment in six hypertensive patients, blood pressure values of those on atenolol alone were not different from those on the combination therapies (P greater than 0.05).", 
    "12": "Electrophysiologic study, isoproterenol infusion, and serial treadmill exercise tests before and after administration of propranolol, verapamil, lidocaine, and procainamide were done in three patients with exercise-triggered ventricular tachycardia. In all three patients, organic heart diseases were absent. Ventricular tachycardia was reproducibly provoked with exercise and with isoproterenol infusion. Propranolol (tested in three patients) and lidocaine (tested in two patients) effectively prevented exercise provocation of tachycardia. Verapamil terminated tachycardia in all three patient and successfully prevented exercise provocation of tachycardia in only two patients. Procainamide was ineffective in one patient and was partially effective in two patients. In the latter two patients, ventricular ectopies, couplets, and short salvos remained provocable with exercise. Electrical stimulations with incremental ventricular pacing and ventricular extrastimulus testing failed to induce tachycardia in all three patients. These findings strongly suggest that repetitive rhythmic activities related to the catecholamine-sensitive afterdepolarizations are probably responsible for the exercise-triggered ventricular tachycardia.", 
    "13": "We report the first two documented cases of the deliberate metoprolol overdose occurring in the United States, one of which eventually proved fatal. The potentially lethal cardiotoxic effects of this drug are illustrated and correlated with the blood and tissue levels of metoprolol. We emphasize the often sudden and rapid clinical deterioration which excessive ingestion of this drug may produce, and the need for close, careful supervision and monitoring of these patients.", 
    "14": "Forty patients completed a double-blind parallel group study comparing furosemide (FUR) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) when added to a stable dose of beta blocker in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. Both diuretics caused a significant additional fall in blood pressure (BP) when added to propranolol, and there were no differences in the mean BP achieved. However, a higher proportion of patients achieved satisfactory control (BP less than 160/95 mm Hg) on FUR than on HCT and, in addition, there was a more marked dose-response effect with FUR. This study showed that FUR is at least as effective as HCT in the treatment of hypertension when added to propranolol, and appears to possess certain advantages in comparison to the thiazide.", 
    "15": "The acute haemodynamic effects of prenalterol, a selective adrenergic beta-I-receptor agonist were studied in eight patients with coronary heart disease. Prenalterol was administered intravenously in four increasing doses to a cumulative dose of 5.6 mg. Fifteen minutes after the last dose of prenalterol two doses of the selective adrenergic beta-I-receptor antagonist metoprolol were administered intravenously to a cumulative dose of 17-5 mg. Ten minutes after each dose cardiac output, heart rate, arterial blood pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, systolic time intervals and forearm blood flow were determined. Haemodynamic effects of prenalterol: cardiac index and heart rate increased maximally by 38% and 39% respectively. Stroke index was increased by 6-9% after the first and second dose. Mean blood pressure was increased by 9.8 mmHg. Total peripheral resistance index was reduced by 19%. The mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased by 3.8 mmHg and pulmonary resistance index was reduced by 48%. Systolic time intervals were all reduced significantly after the second dose, which reflected the positive inotropic effects of prenalterol. Forearm blood flow increased by 29% and forearm vascular resistance was decreased by 20%. Haemodynamic effects of metoprolol: the haemodynamic changes induced by prenalterol were stepwise counteracted by metoprolol. After the second dose all the haemodynamic variables had returned to the control levels. It is concluded that prenalterol possesses a considerable positive inotropic as well as positive chronotropic effect on the myocardium. Both the chronotropic and inotropic effect of prenalterol was counteracted by metoprolol.", 
    "16": "Verapamil improves exercise capacity in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), but its mechanism of action are unknown. We examined the effects of oral verapamil (320-480 mg/day) on resting left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function in patients with HCM. High-temporal-resolution time-activity curves from gated technetium-99m radionuclide angiograms were analyzed before and after verapamil therapy in 40 patients, of whom 16 were also studied during propranolol therapy (80-960 mg/day). All but one patient had normal or supranormal systolic function, but 70% had evidence of diastolic dysfunction, defined as peak LV filling rate (PFR) less than 2.5 end-diastolic volumes (EDV)/sec or time to PFR greater than 80 msec. Verapamil did not change LV ejection fraction, peak ejection rate or ejection time, but did increase PFR (control 3.3 +/- 1.0 EDV/sec, verapamil 4.1 +/- 1.1 EDV/sec; p less than 0.001) and reduce time to PFR (control 187 +/- 56 msec, verapamil, 159 +/- 34 msec; p less than 0.001). Only 30% of patients had evidence of diastolic dysfunction during verapamil. In contrast, propranolol did not change LV ejection fraction, PFR or time to PFR, but did prolong ejection time and reduce peak ejection rate. Thus, LV diastolic filling is abnormal in a high percentage of patients with HCM, and verapamil normalizes or improves these abnormalities without altering systolic function. This mechanism may contribute to the clinical improvement of many HCM patients during verapamil therapy.", 
    "17": "Because of the potential benefits froma noninvasive technique in assessing cardiac output, we compared cardiac output estimates from left ventricular echocardiograms with results obtained simultaneously by a standard technique, dye dilution in 10 healthy normal volunteers. During rest, cardiac outputs by echocardiographic and dye dilution techniques were reproducible and not significantly different. Increases in cardiac output produced by intravenous infusion of isoproterenol (15 ng/kg/min for 4 min) were accurately estimated by echocardiography in subjects whose stroke volume increased less than 40%, but were significantly underestimated when stroke volume increased more than 40%. Decreased cardiac output produced by intravenous propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) was comparable by both methods. Although echocardiography accurately estimated mean cardiac output for the group it over- or underestimated cardiac output in individual subjects. We propose that echocardiography can reliably estimate cardiac output in groups at rest and when stroke volume changes less than 40%.", 
    "18": "The pyloric pressure response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was studied. Studies were performed in 102 experiments on 38 normal subjects. During insulin-induced hypoglycemia, pyloric pressure increased from 5.5 +/- 1.2 to 10.8 +/- 1.1 mmHg (P less than 0.02). This increase in pyloric pressure ws not due to a direct effect of insulin, duodenal acidification, or the release of corticosteroids or growth hormone. Glucagon doses of 2 and 5 micrograms . kg-1 . h-1 increased pyloric pressure from 4.7 +/- 1.1 to 6.7 +/- 0.5 mmHg (P less than 0.05) and from 4.7 +/- 1.1 to 8.5 +/- 1.1 mmHg (P less than 0.02), respectively. Pyloric pressures were increased to 10.8 +/- 0.9 (P less than 0.01) and 13.0 +/- 1.4 mmHg (P less than 0.01) at 0.1 and 0.2 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1 of epinephrine, respectively. Neither cholinergic blockade nor alpha-adrenergic blockade significantly affected the pyloric pressure response to insulin hypoglycemia. beta-Adrenergic blockade abolished the pyloric pressure responses to both insulin hypoglycemia and epinephrine. Neither beta- nor alpha-adrenergic stimulation altered the basal pyloric pressure. In contrast, the combination of isoproterenol and phenylephrine increased the pyloric pressure significantly from 4.2 +/- 0.8 to 12.0 +/- 1.7 mmHg ( P less than 0.01). These observations suggest that insulin hypoglycemia increases pyloric pressure by an adrenergic mechanism that requires stimulation of both alpha- and beta-receptors.", 
    "19": "The prophylactic effect of the 5-HT uptake inhibitor femoxetine was compared with propranolol (Frekven R) in a double-blind crossover trial of 6 months duration. Forty-nine patients commenced the trial. Twelve patients withdrew because of drug failure or failure to attend checkups (6), side effects (4) or other non-drug related causes (2). In the 37 patients who completed the trial there was no significant difference between propranolol 160 mg and femoxetine 400 mg with respect to the number of headache days or the number of migraine attacks during the last 2 months of each treatment, Propranolol, however, was superior to femoxetine when the headache index was used (P less than 0.05). The study has shown that partial depletion of thrombocyte 5-HT by a 5-HT uptake inhibitor does not lead to a marked improvement in all patients contrary to what might be expected from the 5-HT hypothesis of migraine. Nevertheless, due to the infrequent subjective side effects associated with femoxetine treatment it may be a valuable prophylactic drug to a subgroup of migraine patients.", 
    "20": "Urinary prostaglandin (PGE2) and plasma renin activity (PRA) were determined in 3 groups of hypertensive patients before and following 5 days of treatment with different antihypertensive drugs. In all 3 groups studied a substantial decrease of blood pressure was noted following treatment. However, whereas administration of chlorthalidone and hydralazine initiated a significant rise of PGE2 and PRA excretion, treatment with propranolol was associated with a decrease of these two parameters. In view of these findings it seems therefore as if renal production of PGE2 (at least with regard to propranolol, a beta-blocking agent), is not related to the hypotensive effect of the drug.", 
    "21": "In 142 test persons the insulin hypoglycaemia test as well as the glucagon propranolol test were performed under the interrogation of a hyposomatotropism. The combination of these tests proved as suitable for the answers to this inquiry. The insulin hypoglycaemia test led in 29%, the propranolol glucagon test only in 6% to the false indication of a hyposomatotropism. Thus the propranolol glucagon test has the higher diagnostic certainty. Insulin hypoglycaemia test and propranolol glucagon test seem to have a different effect.", 
    "22": "The use of propranolol to control heart rate (HR), systolic pressure, and rate-pressure product (RPP) during laryngoscopy and sternotomy was studied in 21 patients, New York Heart Association functional Classes 1 and 2, scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. All patients were anesthetized in an identical fashion, but the treatment group (N = 13) received propranolol, 0.5 to 1 mg IV, 4 minutes before laryngoscopy and again, in most cases, before skin incision. Patients not given propranolol (N = 8) showed a clinically and statistically significant increase in HR and RPP, whereas HR and RPP remained essentially unchanged from the preanesthetic period in patients given propranolol.", 
    "23": "The antianginal effects of two active drugs, nifedipine and propranolol, alone in combination, were compared with those of placebo in a double-blind clinical trial that included 16 patients with chronic stable angina triggered by exertion. A low dose and a high dose of the active drugs were used (nifedipine, 30 and 60 mg/day; propranolol, 240 and 280 mg/day). Precordial exercise mapping and continuous electrocardiographic recordings were used to assess objective response to therapy, and the patients were asked to keep a diary of episodes of chest pain and consumption of nitroglycerin tablets for subjective appraisal. Both frequency of chest pain and nitroglycerin consumption were significantly reduced by each of the active drugs when compared with placebo, and the combination of nifedipine and propranolol added significantly to the effectiveness. Reductions in area of ischemia and number of episodes of ST segment depression on 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring corroborated the efficacy of each active treatment with respect to placebo. Nearly 60 percent of all episodes of ST segment depression were painless and responded to the active treatment in the same manner as did the episodes associated with chest pain. Side effects were mild and all treatments were well tolerated. The objective methods used allowed for clear-cut differentiation of treatment effects with the various regimens. Although the two drugs alone were significantly more effective than placebo, their combination provided an even greater improvement (p less than 0.005), and therefore it appears to be a safe and effective form of treatment for chronic stable angina.", 
    "24": "The realization that bias in patient selection may influence the results of clinical studies has helped to establish the randomized controlled clinical trial in medical research. However, bias can be equally important at other stages of a trial, especially at the time of analysis. Withdrawing patients from consideration in the analysis because of ineligibility on account of study entry criteria, lack of compliance to the protocol, or data of poor quality may be a source of systematic error. Examples to illustrate the possible consequences are taken from trials in the cardiovascular field. We recommended that reported study results should include outcome data from all subjects randomized in the group to which they were originally assigned.", 
    "25": "The effects of pharmacological alteration of the monoamine systems were investigated in a canine model of narcolepsy. Cataplexy was quantified in eight severely affected dogs by means of the food-elicited cataplexy test. The specific norepinephrine (NE) uptake blocker nisoxetine, and (to a much lesser extent) the specific serotonin (5-HT) uptake blocker fluoxetine, significantly suppressed cataplexy, as did the tricyclic antidepressants protriptyline, amitriptyline, and chlorimipramine. Thus, experimental cataplexy is suppressed more by inhibition of the uptake of NE than of 5-HT. Methylphenidate, the alpha-adrenoreceptor blocker clonidine, and the dopamine receptor blocker pimozide also suppressed cataplexy in dogs. The beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol, the fatty acid gamma-hydroxybutyrate, and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors clorgyline and pargyline had little or no effect. With one exception (pimozide), all the drugs that suppressed cataplexy are known to be potent suppressors of REM sleep. The suppression of cataplexy induced by nisoxetine or protriptyline was reversed by the anticholinesterase physostigmine, further supporting a postulated aminergic-cholinergic interaction in the mechanisms for cataplexy.", 
    "26": "Personality traits and pretreatment symptoms of 69 hypertensive patients were documented with self-administered questionnaires. Thirteen patients (19%) dropped out during 12 months of treatment. Five of these were lost from follow up and eight failed to tolerate their allotted medication. In this series treatment failure did not seem dependent on the type of drug used, but was linked with a high suspiciousness level and a high pretreatment symptom score. Both measures varied independently of one another and a select group of 10 patients who scored highly on both, had a failure rate of 60%. Our results suggest that hypertensives with an increased predisposition to drug treatment failure can be identified at the pretreatment stage. Recognition of such individuals should assist in their routine clinical management and in the design of antihypertensive drug trials.", 
    "27": "A patient with Graves' disease who experienced various allergic reactions to both PTU and MMI is reported. She developed fever, skin rash, lymphadenopathy, liver damage and moderate leukopenia during PTU administration. Furthermore, she developed an MMI-induced lupus-like syndrome characterized by generalized lymphadenopathy, migrating, polyarthritis and myalgia, and results of tests for anti-DNA antibody and anti-nuclear antibody, and LE were positive. All these abnormalities reverted to normal upon discontinuation of medication after subtotal thyroidectomy.", 
    "28": "The diuretic response to stimulation of left atrial receptors by distending small balloons located at the pulmonary vein--left atrial junctions and in the left atrial appendage was studied in anaesthetized dogs in which bretylium tosylate, atenolol and atropine had been administered to effect blockade of renal nerves and to prevent increases in heart rate resulting from stimulation of atrial receptors. In these dogs, distension of the balloons was not associated with significant changes in heart rate, left atrial pressure or arterial blood pressure, and resulted in increases in urine flow, decreases in urinary sodium concentration and no significant changes in urinary sodium excretion. It is concluded that the humoral mechanism is responsible for the diuresis in response to stimulation of atrial receptors and has no significant effect on the response of natriuresis known to involve a decrease in the activity in the renal nerves and haemodynamic changes associated with stimulation of atrial receptors.", 
    "29": "In 20 infarct patients, whose age varies from 43 to 78 years (m 59.6), continuous hemodynamic measurements were made to determine the cardiovascular effects of propranolol without and during a simultaneous infusion treatment with nitroglycerin. In cases of compensated ventricular function and pulmonary wedged pressures of 15 mm Hg or less (N = 10), a mean intravenous propranolol dose of 6.1 +/- 1.3 mg led to a significant reduction of the LVSWI and a simultaneous increase of the PCP by 31% of the control value (P less than or equal to 0.005). A simultaneously performed infusion treatment with nitroglycerin at a mean dose of 3.0 +/- 1.6 mg/h resulted in totally cutting off the propranolol-induced PCP increase, whereas a decrease of the heart rate and the LVSWI due to a beta-receptor-blockade remained completely unchanged. In the case of pre-existing congestion insufficiency of the left ventricle (N = 10) and of a pulmonary wedged pressure of above 15 mm Hg, the administration of a mean dose of propranolol of 5.8 +/- 1.1 mg for protection of the myocardium resulted in a partly disquieting decrease of the volume of cardiac output (P less than or equal to 0.005) which was 28% of the control value for the CI an 12% for the SVI. Correspondingly the left ventricular stroke work decreased to 18%. Nitroglycerin has a reducing influence on these changes, but not down to the initial level. In cases of sufficient ventricular function, propranolol has a favorable influence on the myocardial O2-metabolism via its depressor effect on heart rate and contractility. By means of nitroglycerin, an increase of the pulmonary wedged pressure occurring under this condition can be inhibited. However, in the case of a pre-existing congestion insufficiency, propranolol can lead to a partly disquieting depression of the circulation, which, apart from the hemodynamic risks, makes a rather unfavorable influence on the myocardial O2-metabolism seem likely.", 
    "30": "The responses to oral propranolol (80 mg) and placebo were compared in normal subjects during three studies on a cycle ergometer (progressive exercise and two 5-min constant work rate studies at 50 and 70% maximum). Heart rate (HR), ventilation (VE), CO2 output (VCO2) and O2 uptake (VO2) were measured in each study and metabolites in venous blood in the 70% study. Propranolol reduced HR in all studies and endurance time during progressive exercise. During constant-work-rate exercise the changes with propranolol depended on time and work rate. At 50% max, VO2, VCO2, and VE were reduced in early exercise but were similar by min 5. At 70% max, VO2 and VCO2 were again lower initially with propranolol but then rose more rapidly. By min 5 VE was greater with propranolol, coinciding with a rapidly rising venous lactate. We interpret the initial reduction in VO2 and VCO2 to reduced cardiac output and muscle perfusion with propranolol. The resulting increase in anaerobic metabolism during heavy exercise would explain the increased VE at min 5. The metabolic data are compatible with glycogen being the predominant muscle fuel.", 
    "31": "The irreversible binding of [14C]practolol metabolites to mammalian liver microsomes was studied in vitro. Binding occurred by covalent linkage to amino acids of microsomal proteins. The binding reaction was dependent on oxygen, NADPH, reaction time, microsomal protein content and substrate concentration and was inhibited by carbon monoxide, glutathione and albumin. Albumin inhibition resulted in the binding of reactive metabolite(s) to this serum protein. Hamster (Syrian) liver microsomes had the highest rate of binding and 3-hydroxypractolol formation and marmoset the lowest. The reduced binding of [acetyl-14C]practolol compared to [phenyl-14C]practolol to hamster liver microsomes, but not rat, indicated that metabolites with and without the acetyl grouping were bound in this species. The binding of [14C]desacetylpractolol to hamster liver microsomes was greater than the binding of practolol. Sodium fluoride caused both an increase and a decrease of practolol binding to microsomes from pooled hamster livers, whereas there was a consistent increases in binding to microsomes from individual hamster livers. The collective data indicate that electrophilic metabolites of practolol, possibly N-hydroxylation of the acetyl-amino grouping are formed by the microsomal cytochrome P-450-dependent drug metabolizing enzyme system. These metabolites can react irreversibly with tissue and serum proteins which could be sufficiently altered to be recognized as antigens.", 
    "32": "Nadolol, a new nonselective beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic blocking agent, has a plasma half-life of 17 to 23 hours. We studied 37 volunteers with stable angina pectoris who had five or more episodes of pain per week and who also had a 1 mm or greater ST segment depression 80 msec past the J point during a Bruce protocol treadmill test. An eight-week placebo controlled run-in period preceded double-blind randomization to nadolol administered once per day (17 patients) or identical appearing placebo for four weeks (20 patients), after which an exercise test was done. Diaries for pain episodes and nitroglycerin consumption were kept. Exercise tests were performed 24 hours after the last nadolol or placebo dose. Episodes of pain per week were reduced 59.8 percent after nadolol and 28.2 percent after placebo (P less than .01). Nitroglycerin consumption after nadolol was reduced 66.8 percent while after placebo it was reduced 36.2 percent (P less than .05). Resting and peak heart rates and peak rate-pressure products showed typical reductions due to beta-blockade 24 hours after nadolol compared with stability of these during placebo, all P less than .001. Exercise time after nadolol increased 42.2 percent, which was more than the 14.5 percent increase after placebo (P less than .05). Exercise work after nadolol increased 64.7 percent, greater than the 22 percent increase after placebo (P less than .05). Mean ST segment depression at end of exercise was little changed before and after treatment in both groups, reflecting consistency of effort. Improvement in symptoms and work capacity associated with nadolol significantly exceeded the placebo group responses. Unlike other available agents of this class, a single daily dose of nadolol produced therapeutically effective 24-hour beta-blockade in patients with disabling angina pectoris.", 
    "33": "Hemodynamic effects of combined nitroglycerin and propranolol administration were investigated in patients with acute myocardial infarction. After nitroglycerin infusion decreased the mean arterial pressure by 20 mm Hg for one hour, nitroglycerin was continued, and patients were given 0.033 mg/kg of propranolol every five minutes for a total dose of 0.1 mg/kg, or until there was a decrease in heart rate to less than 60 beats/min, an increase in left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) to greater than 15 mm Hg, or a decrease in systolic arterial pressure to less than 85 mm Hg. Seven of eight patients with initial LVFP less than or equal to 15 mm Hg and three of seven with initial LVFP greater than 15 mm Hg received 0.1 mg/kg of propranolol. Propranolol significantly decreased heart rate. Although pressure time/minute decreased significantly, the magnitude of its decrease was small, suggesting only a minimal effect on myocardial oxygen demands. The LVFP increased after giving propranolol but remained less than the control value. Simultaneous administration of nitroglycerin likely prevented further increases, since LVFP increased after cessation of nitroglycerin infusion, and three patients subsequently had pulmonary edema. Propranolol administration resulted in a significant increase in peripheral vascular resistance and a decrease in cardiac output.", 
    "34": "This study was performed in order to elucidate the mechanism behind the decreased responsiveness to beta-adrenergic stimulation occurring in uterine muscle after prolonged treatment with isoprenaline. Pretreatment of rats with isoprenaline, 20 nmol/kg, three times daily during four days, significantly decreased the myometrial relaxing effect of the beta-agonist. There was also a significant decrease of the beta-receptor binding capacity of the myometrial membranes measured by the (--)-(3H) DHA binding technique. In the animals pretreated with isoprenaline no significant increase of the adenylate cyclase activity could be observed after isoprenaline stimulation in vitro. The uterine cAMP level was diminished in the desensitized rats. The phosphodiesterase activity was increased. Thus both decreased production and increased degradation contribute to the lower level of uterine cAMP content. The activity of cAMP dependent protein kinase was also depressed. In this work, where low concentrations of isoprenaline have been administered in vivo, several biochemical parameters have been shown to contribute to the beta-adrenergic desensitization in myometrial tissue.", 
    "35": "Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is the intracellular mediator of beta-adrenergic stimulation in most tissues. Stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors increases renin release much more at low than at control arterial perfusion pressure. If beta-adrenergic stimulation is mediated by cAMP, this nucleotide should also potentiate renin release at low perfusion pressure. In anaesthetized, propranolol treated dogs, the dibutyryl derivative of cAMP (DB-cAMP), which penetrates cell membranes more readily than cAMP, increased renin release significantly during renal arterial constriction at a perfusion pressure below the range of autoregulation, but no significant effect was observed at control blood pressure. A dose-response relationship could be demonstrated in propranolol treated dogs by administering DB-cAMP at 10, 100 and 1000 micrograms/min at low but not at control blood pressure. Since sodium excretion increased, stimulation of a macula densa mechanism is unlikely, whereas arteriolar dilation, caused by autoregulation at low blood pressure, may condition the juxtaglomerular apparatus for renin release. Infusion of cAMP had no effect on renin release either at control or low blood pressure, whereas 5'AMP exerted a marked inhibitory effect at low blood pressure. We conclude that infusion of DB-cAMP rather than cAMP stimulates renin release at low but not at control blood pressure and that this effect is not mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors; cAMP may be an intracellular mediator of renin release.", 
    "36": "The effects of two different cholecystokinin variants, CCK-39 and the carboxyl-terminal octa-peptide CCK-8, on basal and stimulated insulin secretion were studied in the mouse. It was found that both peptides had a dose-dependent stimulating action on insulin secretion with a maximal response of similar magnitude at a dose level of about 5 nmol/kg body weight. This dose induced an increase of plasma concentrations of immunoreactive insulin of about 100 microU/ml. The calculated half-maximal dose was 2.12 nmol/kg for CCK-39 and 3.18 nmol/kg for CCK-8. The insulin-secretory response to CCK-39 and CCK-8 in the absence of other secretagogues was partially abolished by pretreatment with the cholinergic blocker methylatropine as well as with the beta-adrenoceptor blocker L-propranolol. Thus, this great insulin-secretory response to the two peptides seemed to be dependent on intact muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptors. CCK-39 or CCK-8 administered in a threshold dose prior to half-maximal doses of D-glucose, the cholinergic agonist carbachol, or the beta-adrenergic agonist L-isopropylnoradrenaline (L-IPNA), respectively, displayed different influences on insulin release. CCK-39 potentiated glucose- as well as carbachol-induced insulin secretion, whereas it did not influence L-IPNA-induced insulin release. An equimolar dose of CCK-8, on the contrary, had no apparent effect on either glucose-, carbachol-, or L-IPNA-induced insulin release. This observation indicates that stimulated insulin release is influenced by amino acid sequences other than those of the C-terminal octapeptide in CCK-39 and that the response of the stimulated insulin-secreting cells to CCK-39 is dependent on the nature of the secretagogue.", 
    "37": "Electroconvulsive shock (ECS) administered once daily for up to 14 days decreases beta-adrenergic receptor binding in the cortex and hippocampus in a time-dependent manner. The decrease in binding in the cortex lasts at least 1 week after the last shock. In the striatum, hypothalamus, or cerebellum, 14 days of ECS did not produce significant changes in beta-adrenergic receptor binding. The brain regional pattern of beta-adrenergic receptor changes suggests that repeated ECS affects beta 1-adrenergic receptors in brain regions that receive a noradrenergic innervation activated by ECS. The effects of ECS on neurotransmitter receptor binding appear to be highly selective. Of five receptors in the cortex and three receptors in the hippocampus measured, only beta-adrenergic receptor binding is decreased. Chronic footshock stress does not alter beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites in the cortex, indicating that the effects of ECS are not due to stress alone. The effects of ECS on reserpine-induced alterations in beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites were also examined. Ten days of ECS following chronic reserpine injections reverses the increased binding of beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "38": "1 Effects of (--)-, (+/-)-, and (+)-propranolol, atenolol, guanethidine, bretylium and tetracaine were studied on relaxation responses of rabbit ileum and contractile responses of rabbit pulmonary artery and guinea-pig vas deferens to electrical nerve stimulation (2 to 50 Hz). 2 In the ileum, inhibition by tetracaine 3.3 x 10(-6) M occurred at high frequencies of stimulation, while bretylium 1.2 x 10(-4) M and guanethidine 2 x 10(-5) M inhibited responses at all frequencies, the latter producing greater inhibition at low frequencies. 3 (+/-)-Propranolol 10(-5) M produced a tetracaine-type inhibition after 1 h and a bretylium-pattern after 2 h in the ilea and pulmonary arteries and a transition from bretylium- to guanethidine-pattern in the vas deferens, while atenolol 2 x 10(-5) to 10(-4) M produced guanethidine-type inhibition in all preparations. 4 (--)-, (+/-)-, and (+)-Propranolol 3 x 10(-6) to 3.3 x 10(-5) M were equipotent in the vas deferens and ileum. However, inhibition by (--)-propranolol 3.3 x 10(-5) M persisted in the ileum, while that by the (+)-isomer was partially restored by washing. 5 (--)- or (+)-Propranolol 3.3 x 10(-5) M or atenolol 2 x 10(-5) M did not inhibit relaxation of the ileum after the bath temperature was maintained at 4 degrees C for 2 h during drug application. 6 In conclusion, propranolol and atenolol both have gradually developing guanethidine-like adrenergic neurone blocking actions.", 
    "39": "Chronic ACTH treatment (3 IU/kg daily for 8 days) caused an increase in wet weight of the interscapular brown adipose tissue (ISBAT) in the rat without affecting the enzyme activities of the cardiac or skeletal muscles or of ISBAT. On the other hand, chronic beta-blockade (alprenolol 10 mg/kg daily for 8 days) induced elevated activities in the oxidative enzymes of the ISBAT but not of the muscle tissues measured. Combined ACTH and alprenolol treatment also increased significantly the citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase activities and protein concentration, but decreased the weight of ISBAT to normal. The results suggest that, although a direct antagonism between the beta-blockers and ACTH has not been demonstrated, beta-blockers can abolish the ACTH-induced weight gain of the ISBAT.", 
    "40": "A retrospective study of 63 obese patients seen in a hospital outpatient nutrition clinic was reported. The majority suffered from one or more other medical problems. The relationship of amount of and rate of weight loss to various factors was examined. The multivariate analysis revealed that either the amount or rate of weight loss was greater in the patients who were more overweight initially, white, male, young, single, older at age of onset of obesity, visited the clinic for a longer period of time but less frequently. Conversely, the amount or rate of weight loss was less in those patients receiving conjugated estrogens, oral contraceptives, propranolol, thioridazine HCl, and those who were receiving behavior modification as treatment.", 
    "41": "Lithium chloride administration to rats for 5 weeks caused a significant decrease in dark-induced activity of rat pineal N-acetyltransferase (E.C.2.3.1.5.). This effect is not observed after 3 days or 3 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, chronic lithium treatment suppressed the amplitude and may have delayed the peak of the diurnal cycle of N-acetyltransferase activity. In vitro, various concentrations of lithium chloride (2, 4 and 10 microM) did not affect N-acetyltransferase activity. Beta adrenergic receptor binding studies with [3H]dihydroalprenolol indicated a decrease in number of pineal beta adrenergic receptors in rats treated chronically with lithium. These results are consistent with a lithium-induced subsensitivity of pineal beta adrenergic receptors and may explain the effect of lithium on pineal-mediated cyclic behaviors.", 
    "42": "Continuously regenerating stratified squamous epithelia form an interesting model for examining mechanisms controlling the balance between rates of cell formation and cell maturation and death. In vitro assays of rates of glycolysis and amino acid incorporation of epidermal sheets free from dermal contamination were used to examine rates of metabolism in both normal and hyperplastic epidermis after treatment with various adrenergic agonists and cAMP. Epinephrine and isoproterenol over the concentration range of 1 x 10(-9) to 1 x 10(-5) M depressed the rates of glycolysis and amino acid incorporation in normal epidermis. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP produced a 73 to 78% depression in metabolic activity and its action was enhanced by the addition of theophylline. The alpha adrenergic agonist norepinephrine produced similar reductions. When epidermal samples were treated with hexadecane to induce a mild hyperplasia, depressant effects of isoproterenol and epinephrine were lost, but dibutyryl cyclic AMP and norepinephrine still reduced metabolic activity. The results suggest that adrenergic agents and their putative second messenger cAMP cause reductions in epidermal metabolic activity, an effect similar to their effects on cell proliferation, and that increased rates of proliferation are associated with loss of beta adrenergic responsiveness of the epidermis.", 
    "43": "A systematic study of the effect of neurotoxic agents upon neurotransmitter binding to specific receptors requires the simultaneous assay of several closely related ligand-receptor interactions. Conditions are presented which allow the determination of dopaminergic, alpha-noradrenergic and beta-noradrenergic receptor sites within the same brain areas without major overlap of selectivity. As a result, regional distribution of catecholaminergic receptor sites and some characteristics of such binding are described.", 
    "44": "A comparative assessment of efficacy of the drugs in a group of patients with frequent ventricular extrasystoles has shown that ethmozine and mexitil are effective in most of cases. In certain patients deterioration of the rhythm after all these drugs (ethmozine, mexitil, quinidine, obsidan) has been recorded.", 
    "45": "This study was performed (1) to assess the value of postextrasystolic T wave alterations in identification of patients with cardiac disease and (2) to determine if their frequency depends on length of compensatory pause. In 52 patients a pacing catheter was placed in the right ventricular (RV) apex, and premature beats were programmed to occur 30 msec beyond RV refractory period. Postextrasystolic T wave alterations occurred in 32 patients, 13 with an 19 without coronary artery disease (CAD) (NS). Such alterations were also not related to presence of abnormal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (less than 0.55) or end-diastolic pressure (greater than 12 mm Hg). In 33 patients, premature beats were also introduced 330 msec beyond the RV refractory period to compare effects of long and short compensatory pauses on frequency of postextrasystolic T wave alterations. When the pause was near maximal, 18 patients had alterations in 60 ECG leads; when it was shorter, seven patients had alterations in 10 leads (p less than 0.001). Thus, judging from provoked postextrasystolic T wave alterations, such spontaneous changes appear neither sensitive nor specific in the identification of patients with cardiac disease. The frequency of postextrasystolic T wave changes depends on the length of the compensatory pause.", 
    "46": "Clinical studies were performed with groups of patients with ischaemic heart disease, patients with hyperthyroidism, and normal subjects, to investigate the possibility of a beta blocker withdrawal syndrome, by measurments of heart rate under conditions of increased sympathetic drive provided by standing with vasodilatation or by Valsalva's manoeuvre. A rebound increase in heart rate to levels significantly higher than the control heart rate off treatment was observed 2-5 days after stopping one or more weeks' treatment with dl-propranolol (160 mg/day), atenolol (200 mg/day), acebutolol (400 mg/day) or oxprenolol (160 mg/day).", 
    "47": "The oral acute toxicity of 3 beta-adrenoceptor stimulants, 2 beta-adrenoceptor blockers, and 2 anti-gastric ulcer drugs was studied in 8-week old, SD-JCL rats and ICR-JCL mice, fasted overnight for 17-20 hours. The results were compared with those from rats and mice allowed to feed normally. The order of the fed:fasted ratio of LD50 values in rats was pirenzepin less than propantheline less than pindolol less than salbutamol less than orciprenaline less than fenoterol less than bunitrolol, and was in the range 1.3-4.7. The increased toxicity in fasted animals was considered to be related to acceleration in gastric emptying and intestinal absorption, but not to a general change in the condition of the test system or a decrease in the detoxification ability of the liver because after intraperitoneal administration acute toxicity was similar in fed and fasted rats.", 
    "48": "MK-212 (1 x 10(-7)M -- 1 x 10(-5)M) produced dose-dependent contractions of guinea pig ileum, taenia coil and rat fundus strip. The responses to MK-212 in all three preparations were blocked competitively by cyproheptadine (1 x 10(-8)M) a 5-HT receptor antagonist. Mepyramine (1 x 10(-8)M)-H1 receptor antagonist also inhibited competitively the responses of guinea pig ileum and taenia coli to MK-212. However, it failed to block significantly the responses of rat fundus strip to MK-212. Metiamide (1 x 10(-6)M), propranolol (1 x 10(-6)M) or atropine (1 x 10(-6)M) did not produce any significant effects on MK-212 induced contractile responses of guinea pig ileum, taenia coli and rat fundus strip. Our findings suggest that MK-212 produces both 5-HT as well as histamine like effects on the guinea-pig ileum, taenia coli and rat fundus strip.", 
    "49": "The study was made with the help of a chemitrode placed in various areas of the hypothalamus by the stereotaxic technique, for electrical and chemical stimulation (noradrenaline or isoprenaline) before and after microinjection of respective blockers (phenoxybenzamine or practalol). The results indicated the presence of both alpha and beta-adrenoreceptors in the anterior and dorsomedial hypothalamus producing a depressor response, and, the presence of alpha adrenoreceptors in the posterior and lateral hypothalamus producing a pressor response.", 
    "50": "In propranolol-pretreated dogs (2 mg . kg -1) the immediate cardiovascular effects of sufentanil (0.01 mg . kg -1) or morphine (4 mg . kg -1) were compared. Besides a 40% decrease in cardiac index (CI), sufentanil and morphine initiated quite different hemodynamic changes. Sufentanil did not significantly change mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP) and mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP), while the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) increased by 50%. After morphine, MAP declined significantly by about 65%, and significant decreases in MPAP (14%) and PCWP (33%) were also observed. Propranolol reduced heart rate by 16%, and morphine caused no further reduction in HR. A significant decrease of about 30% was seen in HR after sufentanil. Sufentanil significantly raised systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) by 15%, whereas morphine decreased it by 32%. Pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) was unchanged after sufentanil, but significantly increased after morphine. Right ventricular stroke work index (RVSWI) was unaffected by both analgesics, and morphine decreased left ventricular work index (LVSWI) significantly by 80%. Oxygen transport index declined significantly after both analgesics. Sufentanil reduced oxygen consumption by 20%, while morphine left this parameter unaffected. We conclude that the administration of high-dose sufentanil leads to a stable circulation, even when a total beta-blockade exists.", 
    "51": "A series of gamma-methyl- (5) and alpha-methyl(aryloxy)propanolamines (6) were synthesized and evaluated for beta-adrenergic blocking action. The binding constant (KD) was determined for compounds 5a-j on cultured C6-2B astrocytoma cells. Compounds 5a-j and 6a-e were evaluated for beta 1-antagonist action on guinea pig atria and beta 2-antagonist action on guinea pig tracheal strips. Several gamma-methyl(aryloxy)propanolamines showed affinity for beta receptors and a possible preference for beta 2 receptors.", 
    "52": "Mouse cerebral cortex slices will synthesize [3H]glycogen in vitro. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) stimulates the enzymatic breakdown of this [3H]glycogen. The concentration giving 50% of maximum effectiveness (EC50) is 26 nM. Under the same experimental conditions norepinephrine also induces a concentration-dependent [3H]glycogen hydrolysis with an EC50 of 500 nM. The effect of VIP is not mediated by the release of norepinephrine because it is not blocked by the noradrenergic antagonist d-1-propranolol and is still present in mice in which an 85% depletion of norepinephrine was induced by intracisternal 6-hydroxydopamine injections. Other cortical putative neurotransmitters such as gamma-aminobutyric acid, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, somatostatin, and acetylcholine (tested with the agonist carbamylcholine) do not induce a breakdown of [3H]glycogen. This glycogenolytic effect of VIP and norepinephrine, presumed to be mediated by cyclic AMP formation, should result, at the cellular level, in an increased glucose availability for the generation of phosphate-bound energy. Given the narrow radial pattern of arborization of the intracortical VIP neuron and the tangential intracortical trajectory of the noradrenergic fibers, these two systems may function in a complementary fashion: VIP regulating energy metabolism locally, within individual columnar modules, and norepinephrine exerting a more global effect that spans adjacent columns.", 
    "53": "In anesthetized cats, a carotid sinus nerve was stimulated electrically. After this stimulation the time course of the afterdischarge in the phrenic nerve activity was studied in the control situation, during infusion of isoprenalin and after administration of metoprolol. The time courses were identical in all situations. It is concluded that in spite of the fact that the beta-adrenergic drugs change the steady state phrenic activity, the afterdischarge is unchanged and therefore probably mediated by a separate mechanism. A comparison is made with analogous findings in patients with a hyperventilation syndrome.", 
    "54": "In vitro experiments were carried out on strips of the dog saphenous vein to characterize beta-adrenoceptors mediating relaxation. Four beta-adrenoceptor agonists, isoproterenol, salbutamol, procaterol and alpha-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylaminomethyl)-3,4-dihydroxybenzylalcohol hydrochloride (T-1583), all produced concentration-dependent relaxation of venous strips contracted by 10(-6) M methoxamine. These four drugs behaved as full agonists. In producing venous relaxation, procaterol was about 2.5 times more potent, and salbutamol and T-1583 were 7 and 98 times less potent than isoproterenol, on a molar basis. The concentration-relaxation response curves to the four agonists were shifted in a parallel way to the right by (t-butyl-amino-3-ol-2-propyl)oximino-9 fluorene hydrochloride (IPS 339), a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, and by practolol. However, pA2-values for IPS 339 against the four agonists were all nearly 11.0, whereas those for practolol were all nearly 5.7. We conclude that beta-adrenoceptors in the dog saphenous vein mediating relaxation are predominantly on the beta 2 type.", 
    "55": "In the course of cholestatic liver injury after propafenonhydrochloride medication, a high increase of the glutamatedehydrogenase up to the twenty fold of the normal range was followed by a marked raise of SGOT and SGPT. Cholestatic enzymes like gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase reached their maxima a week later. Within two weeks the hepatic cell enzymes and within four weeks the cholestatic enzymes have returned spontaneously to normal.", 
    "56": "1 Some cardiovascular pharmacology of prizidilol hydrochloride, a new antihypertensive compound with precapillary vasodilator and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist activity, in man is described. 2 To investigate further the pharmacological profile of this drug the effects of a single oral dose of 400 mg prizidilol hydrochloride were compared with propranolol 40 mg in combination with either 25 mg or 50 mg of hydralazine for up to 6 h after dosing, in a placebo controlled in eight healthy subjects. 3 Prizidolol hydrochloride significantly reduced supine and standing diastolic blood pressure and was more effective than propranolol combined with either dose of hydralazine in this respect. 4 Supine heart rate was significantly increased after prizidilol hydrochloride, but was not significantly changed after propranolol combined with either dose of hydralazine. The reasons for the increase in supine heart rate after prizidolol are discussed. 5 beta-adrenoceptor antagonism was assessed in terms of inhibition of exercise induced increases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure. At the doses used, prizidolol hydrochloride was less effective than propranolol and hydralazine combined, particularly during the first 3 h after dosing.", 
    "57": "1 Single and multiple oral dose studies of the penetration into CSF of three beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were performed in groups of patients needing lumbar puncture as part of their neurological investigation. Propranolol, pindolol and atenolol were chosen because of their differing physico-chemical properties. 2 The CSF concentration of propranolol (lipid-soluble) and pindolol (moderately lipid-soluble) was proportional to the free plasma concentration and was similar to, although generally lower than, that theoretically predicted. 3 The CSF concentrations of the poorly lipid-soluble atenolol were similar in different patients and were independent of plasma concentration. This may be due to the slow rate of diffusion of atenolol into CSF preventing the predicted concentrations being achieved.", 
    "58": "The beta-adrenergic antagonists sotalol, nadolol and timolol (which act at both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors) induce amnesia in the domestic chick when given systemically after a one trial passive avoidance task. State dependent learning and effects on performance at test (e.g. interference with recall) almost certainly do not cause the observed amnesia. All three effective beta-antagonists induce amnesia only when injected within a limited period after training, suggesting effects on memory formation. Sotalol differs markedly from nadolol and timolol in: (a) showing a sharp and markedly earlier loss of effectiveness as administration is moved to progressively later times after training (25-30 min rather than 40-50 min), (b) producing when given after training a delayed and gradual loss of retention rather an immediate and rapid loss. These differences seem not to reflect a lesser effectiveness of sotalol, nor a greater delay in the onset of its action, but instead qualitative differences in effects on memory formation.", 
    "59": "Previous reports of cardiac beta to alpha adrenoceptor interconversion secondary to hypothyroidism left open the alternative possibility of a functional influence by hypothyroidism on the inotropic and chronotropic effects of adrenergic amines through a different mechanism. To test this possibility, the effects of hypothyroidism (thyroidectomy) were compared with those of acute carbachol pretreatment on the responses of isolated rat atria to the selective beta and alpha adrenoceptor agonists isoproterenol and methoxamine. Both hypothyroidism and acute carbachol pretreatment (3 X 10(-7) -10(-6) M): 1) reduced basal right atrial rates and left atrial tensions; 2) caused an apparent decrease in the inotropic and chronotropic potencies of isoproterenol; 3) reduced the degree of antagonism by propranolol of the responses to isoproterenol; 4) increased the maximum inotropic response of left atria to methoxamine; and 5) converted a lack of response to a positive chronotropic response of right atria to methoxamine. Equivalent reductions of basal rates by hypothermia, or of basal tensions by lowered calcium ion concentrations, did not affect the responses to isoproterenol or methoxamine. The results suggest that both carbachol pretreatment and hypothyroidism functionally antagonize the responses to isoproterenol and enhance the responses to methoxamine by means other than adrenoceptor interconversion.", 
    "60": "In the psychiatric literature, panic attacks have been considered as part of the clinical manifestations of anxiety neurosis, agoraphobia, functional cardiovascular disturbances, and the phobic depersonalization syndrome. Even though recurrent spontaneous panic attacks are described in these entities, the importance ascribed to them has been minor one. Therefore, panic attacks are poorly understood from a psycho-physio pathological point of view. In the past years, new trends in the nosology of psychiatric disorders have grouped the recurrent spontaneous panic attacks under the heading \"panic disorder and agoraphobia with panic attacks.\" In this view, we present the results of the controlled pharmacological trials on patients complaining of panic attacks. Some relationships between panic attacks, panic disorder, and agoraphobia are discussed.", 
    "61": "Pharmacokinetics of instilled drugs in the human eye is reviewed. The behavior of drugs in the conjunctival cul-de-sac is discussed, and the loss rates with various vehicles are estimated. Kinetics of intraocular drug penetration follows the same pattern in human and rabbit eyes. From results of rabbit experiments, various pharmacokinetic coefficients are computed, including the permeability of the corneal epithelium. Also, with use of published data in human aqueous, the corneal permeability, apparent absorption, and elimination rate constants are calculated for some drugs in the human eye. From the anesthetic response of the cornea the apparent elimination rate constants of the surface anesthetics are obtained. The pupil response is converted to a response parameter proportional to the biophase drug concentration. The time course of its changes conforms with the kinetics of intraocular drug penetration, and the apparent absorption and elimination rate constants are computed for various drugs. The latter constant becomes smaller with increased ocular pigmentation. Use of the relative bioavailability concept permits comparison of drug absorption efficiency among various vehicles. Pharmacokinetic coefficients are also obtained for the cycloplegic responses. The intraocular pressure response is analyzed, and it is suggested that the reduction ratio in the outflow pressure, outflow resistance, and the aqueous formation rate be used for dose-response studies. The rate of effect disappearance is defined and is given for three beta-adrenergic blocking agents.", 
    "62": "Patient compliance can be improved by reducing the complexity of drug dosage and by better labeling, packaging and informational exchange. Single bedtime doses not only increase compliance but also decrease side effects. The once-a-day regimen can reduce drug automatism and thus decrease acute confusional states, especially in the elderly.", 
    "63": "The effects of equipotent beta 1-receptor-blocking doses of propranolol, metoprolol and sotalol on distal coronary pressure, stenosis resistance and regional myocardial blood flow (endo/epi) were studied in anesthetized dogs with a severe noncircumferential stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery. No significant differences between the three beta blockers were observed for overall hemodynamics and regional myocardial blood flow. After drug treatment, subendocardial blood flow (0.47 +/- 0.05 to 0.78 +/- 0.05 ml/min/g) and endo/epi (0.67 +/-0.04 to 1.18 +/- 0.04) increased significantly (p less than 0.05) in the ischemic region. These changes were associated with a marked increase in distal coronary perfusion pressure and a decrease in heart rate. Resistance across the stenosis decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) after beta-receptor blockade (3.2 +/- 0.3 to 1.4 +/- 0.2 units). Atrial pacing to control heart rate only partially attenuated these changes. These results suggest that a favorable redistribution of ischemic blood flow after beta blockade is the result of an increase in distal diastolic pressure-time index and an autoregulation-induced increase in distal bed vascular resistance due to a decrease in myocardial oxygen demand associated with beta blockade. The latter effect also resulted in a decrease in the dynamic severity of a proximal coronary stenosis."
