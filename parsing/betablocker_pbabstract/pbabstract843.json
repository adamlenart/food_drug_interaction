    "0": "Isoproterenol (ISO), a drug which causes an increased strength of myocardial contraction when administered to animals in mug/kg doses, causes myocardial necrosis when given mg/kg doses. Previous studies suggested that necrosis might be due to flooding of the heart muscle cells by calcium. To determine if this is true, and to distinguish between flooding due to release of Ca from sequestered intramyocardial compartments and increased influx from the blood, we have measured total myocardial calcium ([Ca](m)) after ISO administration. The concentration of myocardial calcium, measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy after dry ashing, increased within 10 minutes of the intraperitoneal injection of ISO in rats. After 10 minutes the [Ca](m) remained constant at its new level for at least 50 minutes if the dose of ISO was 10(2) mug/kg or less but continued to rise at a slower rate than noted during the first 10 minutes if the ISO dose was 10(3) mug/kg or more. As measured 1 hour after ISO administration, the increase in [Ca](m), was proportional to the dose, up to 10(2) mug/kg. At higher doses there was no further increase until the dose exceeded 2 x 10(3) mug ISO/kg. Since the amount of necrosis is proportional to dose from about 10(2) to 10(5) mug/kg, while the changes in [Ca](m) are not proportional to dose over this entire range, it is concluded that ISO-induced myocardial necrosis is not mediated exclusively by flooding of heart muscle with plasma-derived calcium, although this is undoubtedly an important factor. This conclusion was further supported by experiments showing that propranolol, at doses which completely suppressed the increase in [Ca](m) due to ISO, did not completely prevent necrosis.", 
    "1": "1. The effects of intravenous infusions of adrenaline, isoprenaline and noradrenaline on human sweating were assessed by continuous measurement of total body weight loss in normal subjects.2. All three catecholamines increased the rate of weight loss but isoprenaline was effective in a much smaller dosage than either adrenaline or noradrenaline.3. beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol reduced the response.4. The response was not abolished by collecting expired air in a Douglas bag suggesting that it was not due to an increase in respiratory water loss.5. The response was not abolished by atropine infusions suggesting that it was not mediated through cholinergic sudomotor nerves.6. It is concluded that intravenous infusions of catecholamines may elicit a small, non-cholinergically mediated sweat response in man.", 
    "2": "1. Changes in regional blood flow and cardiodynamics were measured in anaesthetized paralysed cats during electrical stimulation of the rostral fastigial nucleus.2. Fastigial stimulation results in a graded, highly reproducible and stereotyped cardiovascular response characterized by (a) increased systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures without changes in central venous or occluded vein pressure, (b) decreased blood flow and increased vascular resistance in the axillary, renal, femoral and mesenteric arteries, increased flow without any change in vascular resistance in the common carotid artery, and increase in total peripheral resistance, (c) a small increase in heart rate and myocardial contractile force, decrease in calculated stroke volume, and no change in the cardiac output.3. Changes in regional arterial flow were abolished by transection of sympathetic nerves or blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors by systemic administration of phentolamine.4. Changes in heart rate and myocardial contractility were abolished by stellate ganglionectomy or blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors by propranolol.5. No changes in pupillary diameter or retraction of the nictitating membrane were seen during fastigial stimulation with stimuli producing substantial changes in blood pressure.6. The fastigial pressor response represents a highly reproducible, stereotyped, graded, and differentiated pattern of activation of sympathetic preganglionic neurones.7. The pattern of cardiovascular effects of fastigial stimulation simulates the compensatory (orthostatic) reflex response to maintenance of an upright posture.8. Fastigial stimulation appears to excite the neural network subserving orthostatic reflexes.", 
    "3": "The left ventricular response to severe exercise was studied by telemetering direct measurements of left ventricular diameter (D) and pressure (P) and aortic blood flow from healthy dogs running at speeds up to 30 mph in the field. Severe exercise increased cardiac output from 101 to 478 ml/kg per min, heart rate from 95 to 297 beats/min, stroke volume from 31 to 44 ml, left ventricular isolength (iso) systolic pressure from 120 to 186 mm Hg, left ventricular end diastolic pressure from 6 to 18 mm Hg, and left ventricular end diastolic diameter from 58.9 to 60.1 mm, while end systolic diameter decreased from 53.0 to 52.2 mm. Two indices of myocardial contractility, (dP/dt)/P increased from 37 to 92 sec(-1), while dD/dt, the velocity of myocardial fiber shortening at isolength, rose from 54 to 119 mm/sec. All of these changes were statistically significant. When, in resting dogs, heart rate was first raised to exercise levels by electrical stimulation, severe exercise subsequently increased left ventricular end diastolic diameter more profoundly, from 55.7 to 59.7 mm, while end systolic diameter remained constant and the increases in left ventricular pressure, (dP/dt)/P and velocity(iso) were roughly comparable to those occurring during exercise in spontaneous rhythm. After propranolol, 1.0 mg/kg, severe exercise resulted in significantly smaller increases in cardiac output (from 82 to 240 ml/kg), in heart rate (from 87 to 186 beats/min), in left ventricular pressure(iso) (from 122 to 150 mm Hg), in (dP/dt)/P (from 32 to 44 sec(-1)), in velocity(iso) (from 47 to 59 mm/sec), and in slightly greater increases in end diastolic diameter, from 59.8 to 62.0 mm and pressure from 8 to 22 mm Hg, while end systolic diameter did not change significantly.Thus, the left ventricle responds to severe exercise with near maximal increases in heart rate and contractility, while significant increases in end diastolic diameter (Frank-Starling mechanism) and stroke volume occur as well. When heart rate was held constant severe exercise produced similar increases in contractility but end systolic size failed to diminish and the increases in end diastolic size were greater. Beta adrenergic receptor blockade interfered with the chronotropic and particularly the inotropic response to severe exercise and while the participation of the Frank-Starling mechanism was somewhat greater, the latter was not sufficient to increase cardiac output normally.", 
    "4": "1. Membrane current and mechanical activity were recorded from short segments of frog atrial muscle strips using a double sucrose gap voltage clamp arrangement. Experiments were performed at 4-7 degrees C. Two types of contraction were observed dependent upon the duration of the clamp.2. Short-lasting depolarizations caused a flow of Ca inward current, I(Ca), and development of a phasic contraction. Time to peak tension approximated 400 msec. Both I(Ca) and contraction, as functions of membrane potential, had a threshold of about - 40 mV and were maximal at inside positive potentials in normal Ringer fluid. Peak tension decreased at strong depolarizations.3. The minimum time of depolarization required for initiation of a phasic contraction was 40-70 msec. The time necessary for full activation of contraction was 200-300 msec and comparable to the period of time covered by the flow of I(Ca).4. There was no marked change in peak tension upon repetitive depolarization to the same membrane potential.5. Restoration of (phasic) contractility after a preceding contraction was strongly dependent on the level of membrane potential between conditioning and test pulse. Restoration was half complete at potentials around - 45 mV.6. Long-lasting depolarizations generated tonic (sustained) contractions superimposed on the phasic (transient) ones. Threshold potential for initiation of tonic contractions was usually positive to the threshold of phasic contractions. The time taken to attain the final level of tension ranged between 0.7 and 3 sec. Plateau tension, as a function of membrane potential, increased with increasing depolarization and reached a flat maximum at about + 50 mV in normal Ringer fluid.7. At membrane potentials near zero level, plateau tension developed by the tonic mechanism was about twice peak tension due to phasic contraction.8. Removal of Ca ions from the external medium resulted in an almost complete abolition of phasic contraction within 1-2 min and a gradual decrease of tonic contraction during the first 10 min. Application of a ;Ca inhibitor' to normal Ringer fluid caused a strong reduction of both I(Ca) and phasic contraction without affecting tonic contractions.9. It is concluded that phasic contractions are directly activated by the flow of I(Ca). Generation of tonic contractions may be attributed to a Ca transfer mechanism different from I(Ca) or a release of Ca from intracellular stores.", 
    "5": "1. Using field stimulation with short trains of pulses (< 10 per train), the post-ganglionic motor transmission in the mammalian vas deferens has been further analysed pharmacologically.2. In preparations taken from guinea-pigs, rats and rabbits the effects of the indirectly sympathomimetic drugs, tyramine and cocaine, could be explained entirely on the basis of the actions of released, endogenous noradrenaline.3. Tyramine produced a contraction in vasa taken from normal rats but not from normal guinea-pigs. The tyramine contraction was due to release of endogenous noradrenaline because it was not seen in preparations taken from reserpinized rats and because it was abolished in normal vasa by phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine, thus denying the supposed inaccessibility, to alpha-blockers, of the motor alpha-adrenoceptors activated by endogenous noradrenaline.4. Phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine failed to block post-ganglionic motor transmission in rat and in guinea-pig vasa.5. Tyramine strongly inhibited motor transmission in vasa taken from normal but not from reserpinized guinea-pigs.6. Tyramine produced inhibition of motor transmission in phenoxybenzamine-treated preparations taken from normal but not from reserpinized rats.7. Cocaine inhibited motor transmission in guinea-pig and in rat vasa. This effect was not due to a local anaesthetic or to a smooth-muscle depressant action because it did not occur in preparations taken from reserpinized animals.8. The inhibitory effect of tyramine or cocaine was not abolished by beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol.9. Whereas reserpinization abolished the tyramine- and cocaine-inhibitions, it did not affect the inhibitory actions of noradrenaline or of PGE(2).10. Indomethacin and sodium meclofenamate, which suppress prostaglandin synthesis, did not affect the twitch-inhibiting actions of noradrenaline, tyramine or cocaine.11. These results provide further support for the conclusion that post-ganglionic motor transmission to the vas deferens is non-adrenergic in these species and assign to endogenously released noradrenaline an inhibitory role upon motor transmission."
