    "0": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent complication following cardiac surgery. It occurs mostly between the second and fourth postoperative days and often recurs within 30 days after surgery. While postoperative AF has been well analyzed, post-discharge recurrences of AF have not been clearly described even if they are reported as a frequent cause of re-hospitalization.", 
    "1": "We followed up 185 patients for 10 +/- 5 months with the aim of characterizing the post-discharge recurrences of AF. All patients had recently undergone cardiac surgery complicated by AF and were in sinus rhythm at the time of admission to our Center. We also compared the efficacy of the main prophylactic regimens adopted in the referral Centers (amiodarone, beta-blockers, amiodarone plus beta-blockers) during the first postoperative month.", 
    "2": "In the first postoperative month AF recurred after discharge in 60 patients. The event rate was not different in patients treated with amiodarone and controls (47 vs 50%, p = NS), while it was significantly lower in patients taking beta-blockers either alone or associated with amiodarone (10 and 9% respectively, p = 0.002). At the end of follow up (10 +/- 5 months), AF persisted in 3 out of 176 study patients (1.7%).", 
    "3": "In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, post-discharge recurrences of AF are frequent during the first postoperative month and have a clinical relevance. Beta-blockers (not amiodarone) seem to be an effective prophylactic measure. The phenomenon tends to vanish in the long term, and a chronic prophylaxis is not justified.", 
    "4": "Ectopic atrial tachycardia (EAT) is an unusual and potentially risky arrhythmia that can result in left ventricular dysfunction if not properly managed. In adults, EAT is mainly caused by diseased atrial myocardium and responds poorly to antiarrhythmic drugs. The characteristics of EAT in children might be different from those in adults because of their immature myocardium and the different electrophysiologic characteristics of their conduction tissue. We examined the natural history and treatment of EAT in children.", 
    "5": "From June 1990 through June 1999, 24 children (8 girls and 16 boys; median age 4 mo [1 d-10 yr]) were admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of EAT. Fifteen had healthy hearts, six had congenital heart disease, one had myocarditis, one had bronchopulmonary dysplasia with severe pulmonary hypertension, and one had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Thirteen patients presented with congestive heart failure. Only four patients had symptoms of prodromal airway infection. The maximum atrial rate was 244 +/- 66 beats per minute. Atrioventricular block was documented at least once during tachycardia in 10 patients. Warm-up or cool-down phenomenon was seen at the initiation or termination of tachycardia in thirteen patients. Primary pharmacologic treatment was attempted in all patients. EAT was initially controlled in all patients using digoxin plus propranolol (18 patients), propranolol only (4), or digoxin plus procainamide (2). EAT was controlled using medication in 22 patients. Fifteen patients had sinus rhythm but did not receive medication for 39 +/- 25 months. Two patients died of uncontrolled arrhythmia, and two of underlying disease. Recurrence was seen within 3 months after initial therapy in five patients. Surgery was performed to correct the underlying heart disease in three patients with frequently recurring EAT, all of whom remained tachycardia-free after surgery, without pharmacologic treatment. The spontaneous remission rate was 75% (18/24).", 
    "6": "EAT in children without underlying heart disease can be effectively treated using antiarrhythmic drugs. Spontaneous resolution of EAT after medication in children was frequent (75%) in this series. The results of this study suggest that a step-wise approach using digoxin, a beta-blocker, and a class I antiarrhythmic drug may be the most effective treatment for EAT.", 
    "7": "The basic cause of angina pectoris is imbalance between the metabolic needs of the myocardium and the capacity of the coronary circulation to deliver sufficient oxygenated blood to satisfy these needs.", 
    "8": "The study was undertaken to evaluate whether the effect of combined amlodipine and atenolol therapy on patients with stable angina pectoris and with ST-depression during exercise testing and 48-h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring is superior to that of either agent given alone.", 
    "9": "Patients with stable angina pectoris and ST depression during exercise and ambulatory monitoring were randomized to receive amlodipine (n = 116) or atenolol (n = 116), or both (n = 119). All patients were also treated with short- and long-acting nitrates. The design was a double-blind, randomized, triple-arm parallel group study with 10 weeks of administration of the test medication.", 
    "10": "In terms of time to onset of ST depression > 1 mm, time to onset of angina, total exercise time, maximum achieved workload, and peak intensity of angina, amlodipine and atenolol alone were as effective as their combination. During ambulatory monitoring, atenolol was more effective than amlodipine regarding total time and number of ST-depression episodes, and as effective as the combined drugs.", 
    "11": "For individual patients with stable angina pectoris, combination of a beta blocker with a calcium antagonist is not necessarily more effective than either drug given alone.", 
    "12": "The objective of this review is to discuss recent experimental and clinical data concerning the effectiveness of antihypertensive drugs in preventing or delaying renal changes caused by diabetes mellitus and hypertension and to examine possible future developments. A brief description of the mechanisms involved in the development of renal failure in diabetes and hypertension is included. Evidence is presented to show that in addition to renoprotection offered by reduction in arterial pressure, some antihypertensive agents may give more nephroprotection. This added renoprotective potential of antihypertensive agents, which are either already in use or are being developed, is discussed. The nephroprotective action of conventional antihypertensive drugs, such as beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is briefly reviewed. It is noted that several studies indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be more effective in preventing or retarding renal failure than other conventional drugs. The renoprotective potential of newly developed agents, such as angiotensin II Type 1 receptor antagonists, vasopeptidase inhibitors and endothelin receptor antagonists is also examined. Emphasis is placed on a possible superior renoprotective effect of combination therapy over monotherapy.", 
    "13": "Sudden cardiac death is characterised by the unexpected death of a patient who has been clinically stable. It is frequently due to the development of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. With appropriate treatment, patients can be appropriately resuscitated. Clinically, it is essential to develop treatment strategies to prevent such an episode, as most patients do not survive out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. beta-Blockers are an effective pharmacological therapy in patients following myocardial infarction and in those with congestive heart failure. They may also be effective in other types of heart disease. Anti-arrhythmic agents are not useful as prophylactic drug therapy for reducing mortality in patients at risk for sudden cardiac death. Amiodarone is a notable exception, which may have some benefit, particularly in some subgroups. The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator has emerged as the most effective therapy for preventing sudden cardiac death in high-risk patients. Further work is required to enhance the characterisation of high-risk patients. Genetic analyses in patients with cardiovascular disorders may also identify new approaches to the prevention of sudden cardiac death.", 
    "14": "D-Sotalol is the dextro-rotatory isomer of sotalol and a class III anti-arrhythmic. D-Sotalol prolongs cardiac repolarisation by inhibiting the fast component of the delayed outward rectifying potassium channel. In animal studies, D-sotalol has been shown to be more effective in prolonging atrial, rather than ventricular, action potentials, suggesting that D-sotalol may be more effective against supra-ventricular than ventricular arrhythmias. Furthermore, in animal studies, D-sotalol induces after-depolarisations, which are predictors of pro-arrhythmic activity. D-Sotalol shows little or no reverse use dependence in animal and humans and has slow offset kinetics. This suggests that, in addition to being a preventative treatment for arrhythmias, D-sotalol may be effective at the start or during arrhythmia. As D-sotalol does not block the slow component of the delayed outward rectifying potassium channel, which is activated by the sympathetic nervous system, D-sotalol will not protect against sympathetic hyperactivity. D-Sotalol also has no effect on the K(ATP) channel, which is activated in ischaemia to shorten the action potential. Thus D-sotalol is less effective in ischaemia. Anti-arrhythmic activity with D-sotalol has been demonstrated in dog models of ventricular tachycardia and sudden death. Arrhythmias with D-sotalol have been demonstrated in an ischaemic guinea-pig ventricle model in the absence of action potentials. D-Sotalol is a weak beta-adrenoceptor antagonist and may also be a positive inotrope. In humans, D-sotalol has 100% systemic oral bioavailability, a terminal half-life of 7.2 h and is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine. Preliminary, mainly hospital-based, clinical trials showed that D-sotalol was effective in a variety of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. However, a large clinical trial of D-sotalol as a preventative treatment for arrhythmias and sudden death after myocardial infarction, the SWORD trial, was terminated early because of increased mortality with D-sotalol. The group at greatest risk was those with a remote myocardial infarction and relatively good left ventricular function, the group that showed the lowest mortality when untreated. It is assumed that excessive prolongation of the action potential leading to pro-arrhythmia with D-sotalol, underlies the increased risk of death. However, there is little objective evidence in the SWORD trial to support this. Obviously D-sotalol should not be used in humans with a remote myocardial infarction and relatively good left ventricular function. D-Sotalol could still be considered for short-term hospital use in resistant arrhythmias and for longer-term use to prevent atrial fibrillation in those with remote myocardial infarction and poor left ventricular function.", 
    "15": "beta-Blockers have emerged as an important therapy in patients with symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Early studies demonstrated that beta-blocker therapy improved left ventricular function, reduced neurohumoral activity and reduced heart failure symptoms in these patients. While none of these small studies demonstrated a significant benefit in terms of overall survival, several meta-analyses suggested that beta-blocker therapy could, in fact, reduce mortality in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and mild to moderate heart failure symptoms (New York Heart Association class II or III). Three large, recently completed, trials have confirmed the benefit of beta-blockade in these patients. This report reviews some of the initial clinical studies of beta-blockade in heart failure, examines the findings of the three large multicentre trials and other relevant research. Finally, ongoing trials designed to assess the relative efficacy of different beta-blockers and evaluate the utility of beta-blockade in specific subsets of patients with heart failure are discussed.", 
    "16": "The health burden of asthma is increasing globally at an alarming rate, providing a strong impetus for the development of new therapeutics. Currently available inhaled bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory drugs are effective in most asthmatics, but this palliative therapy requires long-term daily administration. Despite considerable efforts by the pharmaceutical industry, it has been difficult to develop novel therapeutic agents; the leukotriene antagonists and synthesis inhibitors being the only new class of asthma treatments to have been licensed in the last 30 years. It is clearly important to understand more about the underlying mechanisms of asthma and about how current drugs work before rational improvements in therapy can be expected. There are numerous therapies in clinical development that combat the inflammation found in asthma, specifically targeting eosinophils, IgE, adhesion molecules, cytokines and chemokines, inflammatory mediators and cell signalling. In particular, there is the obvious need for new therapy for severe asthma that is poorly controlled by high doses of corticosteroids, as well as agents to counter acute emergency asthma. A long-term goal is to develop disease-modifying immunotherapy, that could be introduced in childhood to alter the natural history of asthma. Thanks to the extensive efforts of the pharmaceutical industry, in the near future we can expect the introduction of a range of novel therapies for asthma.", 
    "17": "The prognosis of women with congestive heart failure (CHF) is better than that for men, but the mechanisms underlying the female survival advantage are not well understood. CHF is characterized by profound abnormalities in cardiac autonomic control that contribute to progressive circulatory failure and influence survival.", 
    "18": "Time- and frequency-domain heart rate variability (HRV) indexes were obtained from 24-hour Holter recordings and compared to assess the role of gender in 131 men and 68 women with CHF (mean age 60 +/- 13.6 years, range 21 to 87; New York Heart Association Functional Class III [66%] and IV [34%]). Gender-related differences in HRV were observed only in the subset of patients with nonischemic heart failure (55 men and 39 women). Among the time-domain indexes, the SD of the RR intervals (76 +/- 5.3 msec vs 55.3 +/- 3.2 msec, P < 0.0001) and indexes denoting parasympathetic modulation, the percentage of RR intervals with >50 msec variation (4.0% +/- 1.0% vs 6.5% +/- 1.3%, P = 0.02), and the square root of mean squared differences of successive RR intervals (19.1 +/- 3.3 vs 28.4 +/- 3.8, P = 0.004) were higher in women. Among the frequency-domain indexes, the total power (7.5 +/- 0.13 ln-msec2 vs 8.3 +/- 0.14 ln-msec2, P = 0.0002), the ultralow-frequency power (7.2 +/- 0.11 ln-msec2 vs 8.0 +/- 0.14 In-msec2, P < 0.0001), the low-frequency power (3.8 +/- 0.25 ln-msec2 vs 4.8 +/- 0.28 ln-msec2, P = 0.006), and the high-frequency power (3.8 +/- 0.24 ln-msec2, vs 4.6 +/- 0.26 ln-msec2, P = 0.003) were greater in women than in men.",

    "20": "Heart failure remains a major and increasing cause of mortality and morbidity, even when the best available treatments are used. One of its key causes is neuroendocrine activation via the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Neuroendocrine blockers of the sympathetic nervous system (beta-blockers) and of the RAS (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 [AT1] receptor blockers) therefore have an important potential therapeutic role in heart failure. The promising results from clinical trials with beta-blockers suggest that these drugs will become an established part of the future management of patients with mild to moderate symptomatic heart failure. Blockade of the RAS with ACE inhibitors has also been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. Blockade of the AT1-receptor, with agents such as candesartan, produces more specific and, theoretically, more complete blockade of the major negative cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II than is possible using ACE inhibitors, whilst maintaining placebo-like tolerability. Furthermore, AT1-receptor blockade leads to increased stimulation of the angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor, which, according to experimental data, may have favourable cardiovascular effects. Following encouraging results from two pilot studies, a major new international study programme - CHARM (Candesartan in Heart failure - Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity) - has been initiated to define the clinical benefits of candesartan cilexetil in a wide variety of patients with symptomatic heart failure. CHARM is the first study to accept all relevant heart failure patients who may benefit from RAS blockade, irrespective of their left ventricular function or tolerance of ACE inhibitors. The 6500 patients to be recruited will be divided among three integrated outcome studies. Two of these studies will examine the effect of candesartan cilexetil versus placebo in patients with an ejection fraction of 40% or less who are tolerant or intolerant of ACE inhibitors. The third study arm will examine the benefits of candesartan cilexetil in a previously seldom studied group: those with symptomatic heart failure, but with preserved left-ventricular systolic function. Recruitment of patients into the study has started.", 
    "21": "The cardiovascular profile of verapamil was assessed in the halothane-anesthetized canine model and compared with that of propranolol. Verapamil was infused at the rates of 1, 3 and 10 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) (n=6), whereas propranolol was administered at a fixed rate of 10 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) (n=6). Each infusion was performed over 30 min, and the parameters were assessed for 20-30 min after the start of each infusion. Verapamil in a dose of 10 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) significantly suppressed atrio-ventricular (AV) node conduction and slightly decreased the mean blood pressure, but no significant change was detected in the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, maximum upstroke velocity of the left ventricular pressure, sinus automaticity, double product, cardiac output, intraventricular conduction, and ventricular repolarization phase and refractoriness. Propranolol suppressed AV node conduction to an extent similar to that of verapamil, but it also inhibited intraventricular conduction, sinus automaticity and ventricular contraction, increased the ventricular refractoriness, and decreased the double product and cardiac output, without any significant change in the other variables measured. These results suggest that verapamil can selectively affect the AV node, and that the greater part of the suppressive action of propranolol on the multiple cardiovascular performance is through a beta-blocking action and direct membrane effect, although the halothane inhalation itself might have modified each of the drug's effects. The abbreviation of the relative refractory period of the ventricle by propranolol may show its potential utility for re-entry type ventricular tachycardia.", 
    "22": "Beta-adrenoreceptors agonist isadrine as shown by measurement of hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (AN) summary electrical activity and by morphometry of its neurons and testis does not result in significant acceleration of maturation in maturing (4-6 week old) male japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica). Anapryline-induced blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors leads to small inhibiting of the reproductive complex. This findings confirm our previous works, according to which brain beta-adrenergic system does not play leading role in regulation of maturation in birds. The direct correlation between morphometrical and electrophysiological features of AN neurosecretory cells was demonstrated as well.", 
    "23": "Cardiac dysfunction in heart failure is widely recognized as a progressive process, regardless of the clinical signs and symptoms. An increase in cardiac sympathetic drive is one of the earliest neurohormonal responses occurring in patients with heart failure and may be one of the major causes of the progressive remodeling leading to the decline in myocardial function, and responsible for the poor prognosis of patients with heart failure. Therefore, recent data provided by several appropriately designed clinical trials clearly indicate the benefits of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, combined with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and digoxin in chronic heart failure class II to IV due to systolic ventricular dysfunction. The benefits are related to symptoms, functional capacity, remodeling, and improvement in left ventricular function, reduction in cardiovascular hospitalization, a decrease in the overall and sudden cardiac death rate, and are similar in patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy, independent of age, gender, or functional class. In this review we describe the cardiovascular effects of the increase in sympathetic drive, the pharmacological properties of the beta-blockers most evaluated in heart failure therapy (metoprolol, bisoprolol, and carvedilol), the major clinical trials related to these agents in heart failure, the recommendations for their appropriate use in clinical practice, the precautions to be adopted, and how to handle the more common adverse reactions.", 
    "24": "To evaluate the behavior of blood pressure during exercise in patients with hypertension controlled by frontline antihypertension drugs.", 
    "25": "From 979ergometric tests we retrospectively selected 49 hypertensive patients (19 males). The age was 53+/-12 years old and normal range rest arterial pressure (< or = 140/90 mmHg) all on pharmacological monotherapy. There were 12 on beta blockers; 14 on calcium antagonists, 13 on diuretics and 10 on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Abnormal exercise behavior of blood pressure was diagnosed if anyone of the following criteria was detected: peak systolic pressure above 220 mmHg, raising of systolic pressure > or = 10 mmHg/MET; or increase of diastolic pressure greater than 15 mmHg.", 
    "26": "Physiologic response of arterial blood pressure occurred in 50% of patients on beta blockers, the best one (p<0.05), in 36% and 31% on calcium antagonists and on diuretics, respectively, and in 20% on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, the later the least one (p<0.05).", 
    "27": "Beta-blockers were more effective than calcium antagonists, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in controlling blood pressure during exercise, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors the least effective drugs.", 
    "28": "The majority of patients who present with ventricular tachycardia have underlying structural heart disease. However, there has been increasing appreciation of the existence of multiple forms of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia with distinct features and unique mechanisms. The most common form of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia originates from the right ventricular outflow tract, is characterized by sensitivity to adenosine, and appears to be due to cyclic AMP-mediated triggered activity. Other forms of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia include intrafascicular left ventricular tachycardia, due to reentry, which is sensitive to verapamil, and automatic, propranolol-sensitive ventricular tachycardia.", 
    "29": "Life-long therapy is necessary for patients with symptomatic long QT syndrome to prevent arrhythmic death. The merits and limitations of the different therapeutic modalities are discussed. beta-blockers remain the mainstay of therapy, but this medication may not be sufficient for cardiac arrest survivors and for those with the LQT3 genotype. \"Genotype-specific\" therapy, like potassium-channel openers for patients with inadequate potassium outflow (LQT1 and LQT2 genotypes) or sodium-channel blockers for patients with excessive sodium inflow (LQT3), significantly shortens the QT interval, but the effects of these drugs on arrhythmia prevention is less well established. Cardiac pacemakers may be especially beneficial for patients with LQT2 or LQT3 and for those with pause-dependent torsade de pointes. More important is to recognize that device programming for preventing tachyarrhythmias in patients with long QT differs from the standard pacemaker programming. Finally, implantable defibrillators with dual-chamber pacing capability are indicated for patients at high risk for arrhythmic death, including all cardiac arrest survivors.", 
    "30": "Although beta-adrenergic blockers can significantly reduce mortality after a myocardial infarction, these agents are prescribed to only a minority of patients. Underutilization of beta blockers may be attributed, in part, to fear of adverse effects, especially in the elderly and in patients with concomitant disorders such as diabetes or heart failure. However, studies have shown that such patients are precisely the ones who derive the greatest benefit from beta blockade. Advancing age or the presence of potentially complicating disease states is usually not a justification for withholding beta-blocker therapy. With use of cardioselective agents and through careful dosing and monitoring, the benefits of beta blockers after myocardial infarction far outweigh the potential risks in most patients.", 
    "31": "Emergence from general anaesthesia and extubation are often accompanied by significant surges in heart rate and blood pressure. To document these changes and the efficacy of low-dose beta-blocker infusions in ameliorating these rises, we undertook a descriptive dose-ranging study comparing the use of esmolol to placebo in patients emerging from neuro-anaesthesia.", 
    "32": "Thirty-six patients undergoing intracranial surgery were randomised to receive saline, esmolol 100 micrograms/kg/min or 200 micrograms/kg/min infusions. The number of patients developing severe hypertension or tachycardia in each group was compared using Fisher's exact test.", 
    "33": "Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) increased in all 3 groups during emergence and peaked at extubation. The proportion of patients with severe tachycardia or hypertension was reduced from 92% in the placebo group to 40% (P = 0.02) and 8% (P = 0.001) in the low and intermediate dose esmolol groups, respectively. Results were better in the intermediate dose group but the difference was not statistically significant. Two patients from the esmolol infusion groups required supplemental medication for bradycardia.", 
    "34": "Severe hypertension or tachycardia occurs in 92% of patients during extubation following neuro-anaesthesia and warrants the consideration of routine prophylaxis. Prophylactic esmolol infusion for the control of haemodynamic disturbances during extubation is feasible and safe. A modest level of obtundation is evident at 100 micrograms/kg/min but a rate of 200 micrograms/kg/min may prove to be more effective.", 
    "35": "Heart failure is characterized by contractile dysfunction of the myocardium and elevated sympathetic activity. We tested the hypothesis that chronic alpha-adrenergic (alpha-ADR) stimulation modifies the molecular and contractile phenotype of cardiac myocytes.", 
    "36": "Adult rat ventricular myocytes in culture were exposed to alpha-ADR stimulation (norepinephrine + propranolol) for 48 hours. alpha-ADR stimulation decreased the mRNAs for sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase and Ca(2+) release channel by 56% and 52%, respectively, and increased mRNA and protein for the Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger by 70% and 39%, respectively. After washout of the alpha-ADR agonist, simultaneous measurement of [Ca(2+)](i) transients with fura 2 and myocyte shortening by video edge-detection showed that [Ca(2+)](i) amplitude and myocyte shortening were decreased in alpha-ADR-treated myocytes, and the time to peak and time from peak to 80% decline of both [Ca(2+)](i) and myocyte shortening were increased. The concentration-response curve for myocyte shortening by the Na(+) channel activator veratridine was shifted leftward in alpha-ADR-stimulated myocytes (EC(50), 21.6+/-4.6 versus 105.8+/-10.5 nmol/L, P:<0.001).", 
    "37": "Chronic alpha-ADR stimulation of cardiac myocytes causes decreases in the expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase and the Ca(2+) release channel that are associated with decreases in [Ca(2+)](i) and contractility. alpha-ADR stimulation simultaneously increases Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger expression, thereby increasing sensitivity to intracellular Na(+).", 
    "38": "Bradykinin stimulates dose-dependent tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) release from human endothelium. Although bradykinin is known to cause vasodilation through B(2) receptor-dependent effects on NO, prostacyclin, and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor production, the mechanism(s) underlying tPA release is unknown.", 
    "39": "We measured the effects of intra-arterial bradykinin (100, 200, and 400 ng/min), acetylcholine (15, 30, and 60 microg/min), and nitroprusside (0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 microg/min) on forearm vasodilation and tPA release in healthy volunteers in the presence and absence of (1) the B(2) receptor antagonist HOE 140 (100 microg/kg IV), (2) the NO synthase inhibitor L-N:(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 4 micromol/min intra-arterially), and (3) the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (50 mg PO TID). B(2) receptor antagonism attenuated vasodilator (P:=0.004) and tPA (P:=0.043) responses to bradykinin, without attenuating the vasodilator response to nitroprusside (P:=0.36). L-NMMA decreased basal forearm blood flow (from 2.35+/-0.31 to 1. 73+/-0.22 mL/min per 100 mL, P:=0.01) and blunted the vasodilator response to acetylcholine (P:=0.013) and bradykinin (P:=0.07, P:=0. 038 for forearm vascular resistance) but not that to nitroprusside (P:=0.47). However, there was no effect of L-NMMA on basal (P:=0.7) or bradykinin-stimulated tPA release (P:=0.45). Indomethacin decreased urinary excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite 2, 3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F(1alpha) (P:=0.04). The vasodilator response to endothelium-dependent (P:=0.019 for bradykinin) and endothelium-independent (P:=0.019) vasodilators was enhanced during indomethacin administration. In contrast, there was no effect of indomethacin alone (P:=0.99) or indomethacin plus L-NMMA (P:=0.36) on bradykinin-stimulated tPA release.", 
    "40": "These data indicate that bradykinin stimulates tPA release from human endothelium through a B(2) receptor-dependent, NO synthase-independent, and cyclooxygenase-independent pathway. Bradykinin-stimulated tPA release may represent a marker for the endothelial effects of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor.", 
    "41": "Arrhythmias are common after surgery, particularly after cardiac surgery. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia encountered postoperatively, although ventricular arrhythmias and conduction disturbances can also occur. Older age is the most consistent predictor of postoperative atrial arrhythmias. beta-adrenergic blockers, amiodarone, and sotalol are the most effective at preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation. Sustained ventricular arrhythmias in the recovery period after cardiac surgery warrant aggressive therapy, usually with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in the absence of reversible causes. Postoperative, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in the setting of left ventricular dysfunction and ischemic coronary disease also usually warrants risk stratification and possible treatment, often with electrophysiologic testing and implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, if sustained ventricular arrhythmias are induced. Transient bradyarrhythmias may be managed with temporary pacing wires placed at surgery, but significant and persistent atrioventricular block or sinus node dysfunction can occur and indicate a need for permanent pacing.", 
    "42": "Transient glucose deprivation of the heart [GLU (-)] confers a preconditioning-like protection against subsequent ischemic/reperfusion (I/R). The mechanisms involved remain unclear. We hypothesized that GLU (-) would induce the classic ischemic preconditioning activated signaling cascade. Potential metabolic consequences and putative cell signaling events induced by transient glucose deprivation were evaluated as candidate mediators of this cardioprotection. Isolated glucose-perfused rat hearts were subjected to 30 min global ischemia followed by 30 min reperfusion (index I/R). Cardiac contractile recovery following I/R was used as the functional end-point in these studies. Metabolic preconditioning was stimulated by 15 min GLU (-) followed by 10 min glucose repletion prior to the index I/R. The potential metabolic consequences of GLU (-) were evaluated by using excess octanoate (11 mM OCT Hi) or 11 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) in place of GLU (-) and by combining GLU (-) with fuels known to inhibit glycolysis supply (20 mM pyruvate or 1 mM octanoate, OCT Lo). The roles of alpha-adrenoceptors, beta-adrenoceptors, adenosine receptors, protein kinase C (PKC) and mitochondrial K(ATP) channels were investigated using inhibitors prazosin (10 microM), propranolol (10 microM), 8-(p-sulfophenyl) theophylline, (SPT 100 microM), chelerythrine (CHEL 10 microM) and 5-hydroxydecanoate (5 HD 100 microM) respectively. GLU (-) increased mechanical recovery (59.8 +/- 4.0 vs. 32.3 +/- 4.7%; p < 0.01). Protection was abolished by pyruvate 26.6 +/- 3.1; SPT 36.6 +/- 3.0; CHEL 35 +/- 4.8 or 5 HD 23.8 +/- 3.3%. In a separate set of experiments, the specificity of SPT in this model was tested by preconditioning with adenosine (100 microM) (34.7 +/- 4 vs. control 16.8 +/- 1.3%, p = 0.01) and blocking this protection with the same dose of SPT (16.3 +/- 1 .5%) used in the GLU (-) studies. Protection was unaltered by prazosin (50.2 +/- 3.3%), propranolol (55.5 +/- 4.0%), or OCT Lo (50.2 +/- 2.5%). Protection was not mimicked by OCT Hi (35.6 +/- 3.8%) or 2-DG (34 +/- 4.3%). Transient glucose deprivation does not seem to achieve preconditioning-like cardioprotection by decreased glycolysis. Rather, the signal system may involve enhanced adenosine release, PKC, and activation of the mitochondrial K(ATP) channel.",

Estimated survival (95% confidence interval [CI]) at 30 days was only 78.4% (range 74.4% to 81.9%) for women compared with 88.0% (range 86.1% to 89.7%) for men. Women were older and more often white, but their excess risk (hazard ratio 2.09; 95% CI, 1.59-2.75) persisted after adjustment for age, racial group, and diabetes (hazard ratio 1.52; 95% CI, 1.15-2.01). Additional adjustment for emergency thrombolytic and aspirin therapy caused a further small reduction in the excess risk for women (hazard ratio 1.46; 95% CI, 1. 09-1.98), but with adjustment for aspirin and beta-blockers prescribed at discharge, the excess risk attributable to being female disappeared as the hazard ratio fell to 0.75 (95% CI, 0.31-1. 84). Estimated 30-day survival free of reinfarction and unstable angina was also lower for women than for men (75% [range 71% to 79%] vs 86% [range 84% to 88%]); again, the excess risk for women persisted despite adjustment for age and racial group before disappearing as treatment variables were introduced into the model.

Cell number was measured by use of a Coulter Counter. Activation of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) was measured by Western blotting and subsequent use of a phospho-specific antibody. Activation of the p42- and the p44-mitogen activated protein kinase (p42/p44(MAPK)) was assessed by detection of phosphorylation shifts and by incorporation of 32P-labelled phosphate into myelin basic protein.",

In contrast, NE alone had no effect on the growth of serum-deprived cells. EGF and PDGF-AA did not replace serum as the basic mitogen. After addition of NE to proliferating cells under serum conditions, there was a rapid, time-dependent significant activation of the p42/p44(MAPK) and of CREB for up to 60 and 120 min, respectively. In both cases, the maximum of activation was reached after 5 min. Application of FO (0.1-20 microM) caused a strong activation of CREB, while no increase in the phosphorylation of the p42/p44(MAPK) was detected. Treatment with 20 microM FO led to an identical increase in cell number as application of NE. Specific blockade of PKA with RpcAMPS prevented the activation of CREB and also the comitogenic effect of FO as well as of NE. The alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blocker carvedilol (10 microM) normalized all NE-induced effects. Prazosin and yohimbine, inhibitors of alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptor activation, respectively, did not influence the NE-evoked increase in cell number. In contrast, the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol (1 microM) completely suppressed the comitogenic effect of NE.

The spontaneous activities were depressed by beta-adrenoceptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, adenosine and acetylcholine. High frequency (>8 Hz) irregular rhythms occurred spontaneously or were induced by cardioactive agents or electrical stimuli.

In the present study, we investigated the fate of those receptors that are retained intracellularly. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the disappearance of the receptor precursor form (M(r) 45,000) and of two smaller species (M(r) 42,000 and 39,000) is inhibited by the proteasome blocker, lactacystin. The treatment also promoted accumulation of the mature receptor form (M(r) 55,000), indicating that the ER quality control actively routes a significant proportion of rescuable receptors for proteasome degradation. In addition, degradation intermediates that included full-length deglycosylated (M(r) 39,000) and ubiquitinated forms of the receptor were found to accumulate in the cytosol upon inhibition of proteasome function. Finally, coimmunoprecipitation experiments with the beta-subunit of the Sec61 translocon complex revealed that the receptor precursor and its deglycosylated degradation intermediates interact with the translocon. Taken together, these results support a model in which misfolded or incompletely folded receptors are transported to the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane via the Sec61 translocon, deglycosylated and conjugated with ubiquitin prior to degradation by the cytoplasmic 26 S proteasomes.",

    "66": "We hypothesized that endothelin (ET) release during exercise may be triggered by alpha-adrenergic-receptor activation and thereby influence coronary hemodynamics and O(2) metabolism in dogs. Exercise resulted in coronary blood flow increases (to 1.88+/-0.26 from 1.10+/- 0.12 ml x min(-1) x g(-1)) and in a fall (P<0.01) in coronary sinus O(2) saturation (17.4+/-1.5 to 9.6+/-0.7 vol%), whereas myocardial O(2) consumption (MVO(2)) increased (109+/-13% from 145+/-16 microl O(2) min(-1) x g(-1)). Tezosentan, a dual ET(A)/ET(B)-receptor blocker, slightly reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) and increased heart rate throughout exercise. The relationship between coronary sinus O(2) saturation and MVO(2) was shifted upward (P<0.05) after tezosentan administration; i.e., as MVO(2) increased during exercise, coronary sinus O(2) saturation was disproportionately higher after ET-receptor blockade. After propranolol, tezosentan resulted in significant decreases (P<0.05) in left ventricular pressure, the first derivative of left ventricular pressure over time, and MAP during exercise. As MVO(2) increased during exercise, coronary sinus O(2) saturation levels after tezosentan became superimposable over those observed before ET-receptor blockade. Thus dual blockade of ET(A)/ET(B) receptors alters coronary hemodynamics and O(2) metabolism during exercise, but ET activity failed to increase beyond baseline levels.", 
    "67": "The hypothesis that exercise-induced coronary vasodilation is a result of sympathetic activation of coronary smooth muscle beta-adrenoceptors was tested. Ten dogs were chronically instrumented with a flow transducer on the circumflex coronary artery and catheters in the aorta and coronary sinus. During treadmill exercise, coronary venous oxygen tension decreased with increasing myocardial oxygen consumption, indicating an imperfect match between myocardial blood flow and oxygen consumption. This match was improved after alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with phentolamine but was significantly worse than control after alpha + beta-adrenoceptor blockade with phentolamine plus propranolol. The response after alpha-adrenoceptor blockade included local metabolic vasodilation plus a beta-adrenoceptor vasodilator component, whereas the response after alpha + beta-adrenoceptor blockade contained only the local metabolic vasodilator component. The large difference in coronary venous oxygen tensions during exercise between alpha-adrenoceptor blockade and alpha + beta-adrenoceptor blockade indicates that there is significant feedforward beta-adrenoceptor coronary vasodilation in exercising dogs. Coronary venous and estimated myocardial interstitial adenosine concentrations did not increase during exercise before or after alpha + beta-adrenoceptor blockade, indicating that adenosine levels did not increase to compensate for the loss of feedforward beta-adrenoceptor-mediated coronary vasodilation. These results indicate a meaningful role for feedforward beta-receptor-mediated sympathetic coronary vasodilation during exercise.", 
    "68": "According to the two state receptor model, the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)-AR) isomerizes between an inactive state and a constitutively active state, which couples to the stimulatory G-protein in the absence of agonist. In bovine tracheal smooth muscle (BTSM), we investigated the effect of short and long term beta(2)-AR activation by fenoterol on constitutive receptor activity. Preincubation of the BTSM strips for 5 min, 30 min and 18 h with 10 microM fenoterol, followed by extensive washout (3 h, 37 degrees C), caused a rapid and time-dependent inhibition of KCl-induced contraction, reaching 68+/-10, 51+/-6 and 46+/-4% of control, respectively, at 40 mM KCl (P:<0.05 all). At all time points, the EC(50) values to KCl were significantly reduced as well. Preincubation of BTSM with 0.1, 1.0 and 10 microM fenoterol during 18 h caused a concentration-dependent decrease of the 40 mM KCl response to 70+/-5, 47+/-12 and 43+/-9% of control, respectively (P:<0.05 all). The reduced KCl contractions were reversed in the presence of 1 microM timolol. Moreover, the sensitivity to KCl in the presence of timolol was enhanced after fenoterol incubation. Inverse agonism was also found for other beta-blockers, with a rank order of efficacy of pindolol >/=timolol=propranolol>alprenolol>/=sotalol>labetalol. At 25 mM KCl-induced tone, the contraction induced by cumulative timolol administration was competitively antagonized by the less efficacious inverse agonist labetalol, indicating that the fenoterol-induced effects cannot be explained by residual beta-agonist binding. In conclusion, fenoterol treatment of BTSM causes a time- and concentration-dependent development of constitutive beta(2)-AR activity, which can be reversed by various inverse agonists. The beta-agonist-induced changes could represent a novel regulation mechanism of beta(2)-AR activity.", 
    "69": "The nature of the sustained norepinephrine-induced depolarization in brown fat cells was examined by patch-clamp techniques. Norepinephrine (NE) stimulation led to a whole cell current response consisting of two phases: a first inward current, lasting for only 1 min, and a sustained inward current, lasting as long as the adrenergic stimulation was maintained. The nature of the sustained current was here investigated. It could be induced by the alpha(1)-agonist cirazoline but not by the beta(3)-agonist CGP-12177A. Reduction of extracellular Cl(-) concentration had no effect, but omission of extracellular Ca(2+) or Na(+) totally eliminated it. When unstimulated cells were studied in the cell-attached mode, some activity of approximately 30 pS nonselective cation channels was observed. NE perfusion led to a 10-fold increase in their open probability (from approximately 0.002 to approximately 0.017), which persisted as long as the perfusion was maintained. The activation was much stronger with the alpha(1)-agonist phenylephrine than with the beta(3)-agonist CGP-12177A, and with the Ca(2+) ionophore A-23187 than with the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin. We conclude that the sustained inward current was due to activation of approximately 30 pS nonselective cation channels via alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors and that the effect may be mediated via an increase in intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration.",

    "86": "Heart failure is an increasingly common and costly chronic disorder, with a rising prevalence of at least 2% in populations over the age of 45 years, mortality rates that are as poor as common solid cancers, and very high health care utilisation costs. Despite increased evidence supporting a range of effective interventions, predominantly therapeutic, there remain significant degrees of physician underperformance in terms of heart failure diagnosis and management. Until the early 1990s, the management of heart failure was largely confined to the symptomatic relief of patients with well established heart failure in fluid overload. The introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors provided the first treatments that beneficially altered the prognosis of patients with the most common expression of heart failure, namely established systolic dysfunction, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. Evidence has now extended these benefits to delaying progression of heart failure and reducing hospitalisation. Much of our understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure stems from these studies. More recent data has clarified the limited role of digoxin, the important benefits of beta-blockade and aldosterone blockers as adjuvants to ACE inhibition, and the emerging evidence on angiotensin II antagonists. There are, in contrast to these positive findings, reliable data from Europe and North America revealing significant underperformance of primary care and hospital physicians in heart failure diagnosis and management, with evidence of underuse and underdosing of evidence-based therapies. Limited qualitative data suggest the reasons for this underperformance are complex and relate to lack of access to objective testing of ventricular function and exaggerated concerns over treatment risks and side-effects. Heart failure represents a complex cluster of aetiologies and risks that are not easy to correctly identify, even in specialist settings. Since there is now powerful evidence on how heart failure can be modified and improved, explicit guidance is needed for which suspected patients should be referred, for confirmation of diagnosis and advice on appropriate treatment regimes, and for which patients can be handled mainly within primary care but with enhanced access to objective non-invasive tests to improve diagnostic reliability and to stratify patients to evidence-based therapies. Current evidence suggests that in North America and Europe today primary care physicians do underperform in their management of patients with heart failure, often owing to factors outside of their immediate control.", 
    "87": "Atenolol (CAS 29122-68-7) and chlortalidone (CAS 77-36-1) are marketed associated in a 4:1 strength ratio (100/25 and 50/12.5 mg) for the treatment of hypertension. According to EU guidelines, the bioequivalence of one dosage strength can also cover additional strengths when the pharmacokinetics of a given drug is linearly related with the dose. The kinetics of atenolol is linearly correlated with the dose and chlortalidone has linear kinetics with doses < or = 100 mg. Thus this trial carried out on the 100/25 mg strength also covers the 50/12.5 mg strength. The trial was carried out on 18 healthy volunteers (9 males and 9 females) according to a single dose, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence study design with washout. Timed atenolol plasma concentrations and chlortalidone blood concentrations were used to assess primary pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, tmax and AUC extrapolated to infinity by a non-compartmental model. The bioavailability of the two formulations was compared through the 90% confidence intervals (C.I.) of Cmax and AUC in accordance with operating guidelines. C.I. of chlortalidone were fully comprised in the 0.80-1.25 range. In the case of atenolol, which displayed a higher data dispersion, C.I. were comprised in the enlarged 0.70-1.43 range. Time to peak, tmax, did not show any statistically significant difference between the test and reference product with respect to both analytes. Pharmacodynamic measurements of the decrease in systolic blood pressure led to fully overlapping results with test and reference. The authors conclude that the test formulation should be considered bioequivalent with the reference with chlortalidone and in the borderline of bioequivalence with atenolol. As no safety problems were involved and pharmacodynamics led to overlapping results as between test and reference, the bioequivalence conclusion could be extended also to atenolol.", 
    "88": "The ability of pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker/5-hydroxytryptamine(1A/1B) antagonist, to enhance the clinical antidepressant response to selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors is generally attributed to a blocking of the feedback that inhibits the serotoninergic neuronal activity mediated by somatodendritic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A) autoreceptors. The current study examined the ability of pindolol to enhance the analgesic effect of tramadol, an atypical centrally-acting analgesic agent with relatively weak opioid receptor affinity and which, like some antidepressants, is able to inhibit the re-uptake of 5-HT in the raphe nuclei. Racemic pindolol (2 mg/kg, s.c.), rendered analgesic a non-effective acute dose of tramadol (10-40 mg/kg, i.p.) in two nociceptive tests: a hot plate test in mice and a plantar test in rats. Moreover, (+/-)8-OH-DPAT (0.125-1 mg/kg, s.c.), a selective 5-HT(1A) agonist, reduces the analgesic effect of tramadol in the same tests.

Using cloned human and rhesus beta1-, beta2- and beta3-adrenoceptors, expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, L-750355 was shown to be a potent, albeit partial, agonist for the human (EC(50)=10 nM; % maximal receptor activation=49%) and rhesus (EC(50)=28 nM; % maximal receptor activation=34%) beta3-adrenoceptors. Furthermore, L-750355 stimulates lipolysis in rhesus adipocytes in vitro. L-750355 is a weak partial agonist (EC(50)=3.2 microM; % maximal receptor activation=33% ) for the human beta1-adrenoceptor but exhibits no agonist activity for rhesus beta1- or beta2-adrenoceptors of either human or rhesus origin. Administration of L-750355 to anesthetized rhesus monkeys, as a series of rising dose intravenous infusions, evokes dose-dependent glycerolemia and tachycardia with no change in mean arterial blood pressure or plasma potassium. The dose-response curve for L-750355-induced glycerolemia lies to the left of that for tachycardia. Propranolol, at a dose (0.3 mg/kg, i.v. ) that attenuates isoproterenol-induced changes in heart rate and glycerolemia, abolished L-750355-induced tachycardia but had no effect on L-750355-induced glycerolemia.", 
    "90": "The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of intravenous cocaine administration on cerebellar Purkinje cell firing. Extracellular neuron activity was recorded and cells were locally excited with spaced microiontophoretic pulses of glutamate. Glutamate-evoked and spontaneous discharges were compared before and immediately following cocaine administration. Cocaine injections (1. 0 and 0.25 mg/kg, i.v.) induced a reversible suppression of both spontaneous activity and glutamate-evoked excitation. Procaine was ineffective in producing similar actions. Cocaine only inhibited glutamate-induced excitation in animals pre-treated with reserpine (5 mg/kg, i.p.). Propranolol injections (10 mg/kg, i.p.) were ineffective in blocking cocaine-induced inhibitions. Yohimbine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) pre-treatment abolished cocaine-induced suppressions of either spontaneous or glutamate-evoked excitation. Therefore, cocaine administration decreases Purkinje cell spontaneous and glutamate-evoked discharges by a mechanism involving alpha(2)-adrenoceptor activation. It is suggested that by changing the normal function of the cerebellum cocaine can produce drug-related alterations in overt behavior and cognition.", 
    "91": "Sudden cardiac death occurs in the United States with an incidence of more than 300,000 persons per year. The underlying cause of death is commonly considered to be due to primary or secondary arrhythmias. In young persons in whom no structural heart disease can be identified, the long QT syndromes (LQTS) are commonly considered as likely causes. Multiple genes causing LQTS have been identified thus far, all of which encode cardiac ion channels. These include two potassium channel alpha subunits (KVLQT1 and HERG), two potassium channel beta subunits (minK and MiRP1), and one sodium channel gene (SCN5A). The purpose of this review is to describe the current understanding of the molecular genetics of LQTS and the resultant phenotypes, particularly in young patients.", 
    "92": "The role of antiarrhythmic drugs in the management of children with arrhythmias has changed due to the rapid development of radiofrequency ablation. Moreover, the release of new drugs and a better insight into the electrophysiologic mechanisms of arrhythmias have changed former patterns of drug management. However, because of lack of controlled trials, arrhythmia management in pediatrics is still mainly based on clinical studies and individual experience. Within these limitations, I attempt to give practical recommendations for the management of the different arrhythmias seen in children based on the latest developments in this area.", 
    "93": "In the prevention of variceal rebleeding, it is already established that hemodynamic response to drug treatment (decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] to 12 mm Hg or by >20%) is predictive of clinical effectiveness. In primary prophylaxis very few clinical data are available. We assessed the role of the hemodynamic response to beta-blockers or beta-blockers plus nitrates in predicting clinical efficacy of prophylaxis. A total of 49 cirrhotic patients with varices at risk of bleeding, without prior variceal bleeding, were investigated by hepatic vein catheterization before and after 1 to 3 months of chronic treatment with nadolol or nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate, and were followed during treatment for up to 5 years. A total of 30 patients (61%) were good hemodynamic responders, and among them in 12 (24%) HVPG was </=12 mm Hg during treatment. During treatment 9 patients had variceal bleeding: 7 were poor responders and 2 were good responders. The probability of bleeding at 3 years of follow-up was significantly higher in poor responders (41%) than in good responders (7%; P =.0008). No patient reaching an HVPG of 12 mm Hg or less during treatment had variceal bleeding during follow-up. Cox's regression analysis showed that poor hemodynamic response was the main factor predicting bleeding (beta = 1.91; SE(beta) = 0.80; P =.01). During follow-up 11 patients died of hepatic causes. Survival was related to Child-Pugh class and to initial value of HVPG, according to Cox's analysis. In conclusion, the assessment of hemodynamic response to drugs in terms of HVPG is the best predictor of efficacy of prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in patients treated with beta-blockers or beta-blockers plus nitrates.",

We undertook this study to determine the frequency of, and risk factors for, perioperative complications in patients undergoing resection of pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients during 1983-1996 who underwent surgical resection of catecholamine-secreting pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. Preoperative risk factors, adverse intraoperative events, and complications occurring in the 30 days after operation were recorded. Blood pressures were collected from manual records. The ranked sum test and Fisher's exact test were used for analyses. Adverse perioperative events or complications occurred in 45 of 143 patients (31.5%; exact 95% confidence interval, 24.0% to 39.8%). Of these 45 patients, 41 experienced one or more adverse intraoperative events. The most common adverse event was sustained hypertension (36 patients). There were no perioperative deaths, myocardial infarctions, or cerebrovascular events. Preoperative factors univariately associated with adverse perioperative events included larger tumor size (P: = 0.007), prolonged duration of anesthesia (P: = 0.015), and increased levels of preoperative urinary catecholamines and catecholamine metabolites: vanillylmandelic acid (P: = 0.019), metanephrines (P: = 0.004), norepinephrine (P: = 0. 014), and epinephrine (P: = 0.004). Despite premedication of most patients with phenoxybenzamine and a beta-adrenergic blocker, varying degrees of intraoperative hemodynamic lability occurred.", 
    "99": "Few patients who had pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma resection experienced significant perioperative morbidity and none died in the largest retrospective study on this topic to date.

    "100": "1. The aim of the present investigation was to analyse whether three prototype allosteric modulators of ligand binding to muscarinic receptors, i.e. alcuronium, gallamine, and the alkane-bis-ammonium compound W84 (hexane-1,6-bis[dimethyl-3'-phthalimidopropylammonium bromide]), may have allosteric effects on radioligand-binding characteristics at other G-protein-coupled receptors, such as cerebral A1 adenosine receptors (Gi-coupled), cardiac left ventricular alpha1-adrenoceptors (Gq), and beta-adrenoceptors (Gs). 2. The modulators were applied at concentrations known to be high with regard to the allosteric delay of the dissociation of the antagonist [3H]-N-methylscopolamine (NMS) from muscarinic M2-receptors: 30 micromol l(-1) W84, 30 micromol l(-1) alcuronium, 1000 micromol l(-1) gallamine. As radioligands, we used the adenosine A1-receptor ligand [3H]-cyclopentyl-dipropylxanthine (CPX), the alpha1-adrenoceptor ligand [3H]-prazosin (PRAZ), and the beta-adrenoceptor ligand (-)-[125I]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP). Allosteric actions on ligand dissociation and the equilibrium binding were measured in the membrane fractions of rat whole forebrain (CPX) and of rat cardiac left ventricle (PRAZ, ICYP, NMS), respectively. 3. CPX and PRAZ showed a monophasic dissociation with half-lives of 5.88+/-0.15 and 12.27+/-0.46 min, respectively. In the case of CPX, neither the binding at equilibrium nor the dissociation characteristics were influenced by the allosteric agents. With PRAZ, the binding at equilibrium remained almost unaltered in the presence of W84, whereas it was reduced to 36+/-2% of the control value with alcuronium and to 42+/-2% with gallamine. The dissociation of PRAZ was not affected by W84, whereas it was moderately accelerated by alcuronium and gallamine. In the case of ICYP, the binding at equilibrium was not affected by the allosteric modulators. The dissociation of ICYP was slow, and after 3 h, more than 50% of the radioligand was still bound, so that a reliable half-life could not be calculated. ICYP dissociation was not affected by W84. In the presence of alcuronium and gallamine, the dissociation curve of ICYP revealed an initial drop from the starting level, followed by the major phase of dissociation being parallel to the control curve. 4. In summary, the allosteric action of the applied agents is not a common feature of G-protein-coupled receptors and appears to be specific for muscarinic receptors.", 
    "101": "1. Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as propranolol, can provoke severe bronchoconstriction only in asthmatic subjects. Recently, we developed a guinea-pig model of propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction (PIB) and the purpose of this study was to investigate the role of alpha-adrenergic nerve pathways in this reaction. 2. Phentolamine administered after an antigen challenge did not inhibit PIB; however, its administration before the antigen challenge significantly inhibited the antigen-induced bronchoconstriction and also bronchoconstriction induced by methacholine inhalation. 3. We conclude that the alpha-adrenergic nerve system is not involved in the development of PIB following allergic reaction in our guinea-pig model.", 
    "102": "Treatment of experimental animals subjected to 90 days physical training programme plus repeated doses of salbutamol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, administered under two different regimes: therapeutic (16 microg/kg body weight, twice a day) and doping (3 mg/kg body weight, twice a day), caused a marked increase in size of skeletal (soleus, gastrocnemius and plantaris) leg muscles. Adrenergic involvement of salbutamol-linked hypertrophy was demonstrated by co-administration of the non-specific beta-adrenergic antagonist D,L-propranolol (10 mg/kg body weight twice a day). The salbutamol-induced muscle hypertrophy was associated with an early increase in creatine phosphokinase (CK) and its myocardial isozyme (CKmb), without significant changes in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (AAT) and aspartate aminotransferase (DAT). The induction of muscle-injury biomarkers was completely abolished by co-administration of propranolol, thus suggesting the adrenergic involvement of these alterations.", 
    "103": "The beta3-selective adrenergic receptor ligand BRL 37344 (BRL) was used to differentiate the presence and functional role of beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) subtypes in pig tissues. BRL did not stimulate adenylyl cyclase in membrane preparations or increase lipolysis from pig adipocytes. In contrast to some species, BRL appears to be a poor agonist for the pig betaAR and is not a useful betaAR ligand. Based on displacement of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding, BRL exhibited a 100-fold selectivity for pig betaAR subtypes in adipose and skeletal muscle membranes. The high affinity site was proposed to be the beta2AR. When used as an antagonist, BRL blockade of the high affinity site did not interfere with isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis but did inhibit adenylyl cyclase activation. Results indicate that the high affinity betaAR (betaAR) is not linked to lipolysis, possibly due to intracellular compartmentalization. Therefore, betaAR subtypes may have function-specific effects.", 
    "104": "The objective of the submitted work was to assess by the method of spectral analysis of the heart rate how the use of bisoprolol will affect the autonomous modulation of the heart rate in hyperthyroid patients and what are the time relations of this effect.", 
    "105": "In the investigation 10 female patients with thyreotoxicosis caused by Graves-Basedow's disease were included. Their average age was 38 years and along with a thyrostatic drug bisoprolol was administered. Spectral analysis of the heart rate was made before the onset of treatment, after a week and after six weeks with the patients in an upright and recumbent position. The activity of the sympathicus was evaluated from the ratio of low and high frequencies.", 
    "106": "Already during the first week a significant decline of the heart rate was observed. During the first week of treatment a decline of the activity of the sympathicus in a recumbent position occurred associated with milder palpitations or their complete disappearance. The decline in an upright position occurred after the first week of treatment. From the trend of other parameters of cardiac variability, the differences of some reached statistical significance, it may be concluded that the activity of the parasympathicus, formerly inhibited, was restored.", 
    "107": "Based on the results it may be stated that bisoprolol is a suitable supplementary drug in the early treatment of thyrotoxicosis because by reducing the hyperadrenergic state it improves the quality of life of these patients.", 
    "108": "The long-term action of elevated catecholamine concentrations on the heart muscle causes a number of adverse effects from apoptosis to malignant arrhythmia or terminal failure of the cardiac pump. Recently completed mortality studies with beta-blockers (BB) in chronic heart failure CIBIS II and MERIT HF confirmed the conclusions of pilot studies with carvedilol that in stabilized chronic heart failure BB reduces the mortality rate as well as the need of hospital admission on account of deteriorating heart failure. Proper selection of patients for administration of BB is necessary, assessment of absolute and relative contraindications. It is also necessary to define the initiation and increase of dosage and the target dose of the beta-blocker. The sooner treatment with beta-blockers is started, the greater the foreseen benefit for the patient.", 
    "109": "In humans, bradykinin contributes to the acute renin response after ACE inhibition. To further explore the role of endogenous bradykinin in human renin regulation, we determined the effect of HOE 140, a specific bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist, on the renin response to 0.5 mg/kg i.v. furosemide in a randomized, single blind, crossover design study of 10 healthy, salt-replete volunteers. HOE 140 did not affect basal plasma renin activity, aldosterone, mean arterial pressure, or heart rate. Furosemide administration increased plasma renin activity from 1.0 +/- 0.2 to 4.5 +/- 1.2 ng of angiotensin I/ml/h and there was no effect of HOE 140 (from 1.1 +/- 0.2 to 3.9 +/- 0.8 ng of angiotensin I/ml/h). Similarly, there was no effect of HOE 140 on the diuretic response to furosemide. Mean arterial pressure increased in response to furosemide after HOE 140 (82 +/- 2 to 94 +/- 2 mm Hg), but not after vehicle (81 +/- 3 to 85 +/- 2 mm Hg), whereas heart rate was unchanged. In conclusion, activation of the B(2) receptor by endogenous bradykinin does not contribute to the renin response to acute furosemide treatment in humans. However, bradykinin may contribute to blood pressure regulation under conditions in which the renin-angiotensin system is stimulated.", 
    "110": "We used transgenic (TG) mice overexpressing mutant alpha-tropomyosin [alpha-Tm(Asp175Asn)], linked to familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC), to test the hypothesis that this mutation impairs cardiac function by altering the sensitivity of myofilaments to Ca(2+). Left ventricular (LV) pressure was measured in anesthetized nontransgenic (NTG) and TG mice. In control conditions, LV relaxation was 6,970 +/- 297 mmHg/s in NTG and 5,624 +/- 392 mmHg/s in TG mice (P < 0.05). During beta-adrenergic stimulation, the rate of relaxation increased to 8,411 +/- 323 mmHg/s in NTG and to 6,080 +/- 413 mmHg/s in TG mice (P < 0.05). We measured the pCa-force relationship (pCa = -log [Ca(2+)]) in skinned fiber bundles from LV papillary muscles of NTG and TG hearts. In control conditions, the Ca(2+) concentration producing 50% maximal force (pCa(50)) was 5.77 +/- 0.02 in NTG and 5.84 +/- 0.01 in TG myofilament bundles (P < 0.05). After protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation, the pCa(50) was 5.71 +/- 0.01 in NTG and 5.77 +/- 0. 02 in TG myofilament bundles (P < 0.05). Our results indicate that mutant alpha-Tm(Asp175Asn) increases myofilament Ca(2+)-sensitivity, which results in decreased relaxation rate and blunted response to beta-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "111": "Stress and stress related hormones such as glucocorticoids inhibit lactation in cows. In the present study we propose a novel mechanism connecting stress with plasminogen-plasmin system (PPS) (an enzymatic mechanism in milk, which leads to the breakdown of the major milk protein casein). We show that stress activates the PPS leading to an increase in plasmin activity, and that a distinct plasmin-induced beta-casein breakdown product (fraction 1-28) is a potent blocker of potassium channels in mammary epithelia apical membranes. The reduction in milk production due to dehydration stress or glucocorticoid (dexamethsone) was correlated with the activities of plasmin and channel blocking activity in the milk of the tested cows. The notion that the axis Stress-PPS-beta-casein fraction 1-28 is responsible for the reduction in milk yield is supported by the results of experiments showing that injecting solution composed of casein digest enriched with beta-casein fraction 1-28 to the udder lumen leads to a transient reduction in milk production. Furthermore, injecting a pure beta-casein fraction 1-28 to the udder lumen of goat's lead also to a transient reduction in milk production with kinetics that was similar to the kinetics observed in cows.", 
    "112": "In recent years attempts intensified to identify and treat patients with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death caused by malignant ventricular arrhythmias. An elevated dispersion value of the QT interval of surface ECG suggests non-homogeneous repolarization and thus the presence of an arrhythmogenic substrate. In patients with ischaemic heart disease and confirmed malignant arrhythmias after onset of antiarrhythmic therapy changes in the dispersion of the QT interval occur, depending on the antiarrhythmic agent used and the effectiveness of treatment. In the authors group of 40 patients the value of dispersion of the QT interval declined significantly after introduction of effective antiarrhythmic treatment in patients treated with amiodarone and beta-blocker. It may thus be stated that the value of the QT interval dispersion of surface ECG can be used not only as a non-invasive \"marker\" of sudden cardiac death but also as an auxiliary indicator of effectiveness of antiarrhythmic therapy.", 
    "113": "Chronic heart failure is an increasing cause of hospital admission in the Netherlands and Belgium. Despite numerous medical treatment modalities, the mortality remains high. Recent placebo-controlled randomized studies suggest that the addition of beta-blockers in stabilized, optimally pretreated patients with chronic heart failure using angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diuretics and digitalis, is accompanied by an additional absolute decrease in mortality by about 5% and a relative decrease in mortality by about 35%. Also the number hospitalization frequency decreases. Initially, the beneficial effects of beta-blockers on symptoms are only minor or absent. During the initiation period some clinical deterioration may occur which has to be treated accordingly; these patients are, however, difficult to identify. Initiation has to be done using low doses and should be restricted to stabilized, optimally treated patients. Doses should only be increased every 2 to 4 weeks until target doses are reached. These findings must not be extrapolated automatically to all cases of heart failure, since patients in the trials may differ considerably from those encountered in general practice.", 
    "114": "Regulation of genes involved in fatty acid (FA) utilization in heart and liver of weanling rats was investigated in response to variations in dietary lipid content and to changes in intracellular FA homeostasis induced by etomoxir, a blocker of FA import into mitochondria. Northern-blot analyses were performed using cDNA probes specific for FA transport protein, a cell membrane FA transporter; long-chain- and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, which catalyze the first step of mitochondrial FA beta-oxidation; and acyl-CoA oxidase, a peroxisomal FA beta-oxidation marker. High-fat feeding from postnatal d 21 to 28 resulted in a coordinate increase (58 to 136%) in mRNA abundance of all genes in heart. In liver, diet-induced changes in mitochondrial and peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzyme mRNAs (from 52 to 79%) occurred with no change in FA transport protein gene expression. In both tissues, the increases in mRNA levels went together with parallel increases in enzyme activity. Changes in FA homeostasis resulting from etomoxir administration led to a marked stimulation (76 to 180%) in cardiac expression of all genes together with parallel increases in enzyme activities. In the liver, in contrast, etomoxir stimulated the expression of acyl-CoA oxidase gene only. Feeding rats a low-fat diet containing 0.5% clofibrate, a ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, resulted in similar inductions of beta-oxidation enzyme genes in both tissues, whereas up-regulation of FA transport protein gene was restricted to heart. Altogether, these data suggest that changes in FA homeostasis in immature organs resulting either from high-fat diet or beta-oxidation blockade can efficiently be transduced to the level of gene expression, resulting in tissue-specific adaptations in various FA-using enzymes and proteins.", 
    "115": "The mechanism for the beneficial effect of beta-blocker therapy in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is unclear, but it may relate to an energy-sparing effect that results in improved cardiac efficiency. C-11 acetate kinetics, measured using positron-emission tomography (PET), are a proven noninvasive marker of oxidative metabolism and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO(2)). This approach can be used to measure the work-metabolic index, which is a noninvasive estimate of cardiac efficiency.", 
    "116": "The aim of this study was to determine the effect of metoprolol on oxidative metabolism and the work-metabolic index in patients with LV dysfunction. Forty patients (29 with ischemic and 11 with nonischemic heart disease; LV ejection fraction <40%) were randomized to receive metoprolol or placebo in a treatment protocol of titration plus 3 months of stable therapy. Seven patients were not included in analysis because of withdrawal from the study, incomplete follow-up, or nonanalyzable PET data. The rate of oxidative metabolism (k) was measured using C-11-acetate PET, and stoke volume index (SVI) was measured using echocardiography. The work-metabolic index was calculated as follows: (systolic blood pressure x SVI x heart rate)/k. No significant change in oxidative metabolism occurred with placebo (k=0.061+/-0.022 to 0.054+/-0.012 per minute). Metoprolol reduced oxidative metabolism (k=0.062+/-0. 024 to 0.045+/-0.015 per minute; P:=0.002). The work-metabolic index did not change with placebo (from 5.29+/-2.46 x 10(6) to 5.14+/-2. 06 x 10(6) mm Hg. mL/m(2)), but it increased with metoprolol (from 5. 31+/-2.15 x 10(6) to 7.08+/-2.36 x 10(6) mm Hg. mL/m(2); P:<0.001).",

    "118": "To develop molecules capable of directly probing the catechol binding region of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR), novel benzophenone- and fluorenone-based beta(2)AR antagonists were prepared as potential photoaffinity probes. While the benzophenone-containing ligands bound with relatively modest affinity, one of the fluorenone-based compounds, 4-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropoxy)-7-amino-6-iodofluorenone+ ++ (iodoaminoflisopolol, IAmF), showed very high affinity for the beta(2)AR, inhibiting [(125)I]ICYP binding with an apparent K(i) of approximately 1 x 10(-)(9) M. In comparison to the benzophenone ligands, the fluorenone ligands have one additional carbon-carbon bond that creates a planar unsaturated ring system and leads to a large increase in receptor binding affinity. Unlike previous beta(2)AR photoaffinity ligands, an attractive and unique feature of the fluorenone derivative IAmF is that the large planar unsaturated ring (believed to correspond to the catechol end of other beta(2)AR ligands) serves as both the binding pharmacophore and the photoreaction center for this molecule. With this potential for directly probing the catechol binding region of the beta(2)AR, we synthesized and tested IAmF in carrier-free radioiodinated form ([(125)I]IAmF). When photoreduction was conducted at 350 nm for 20 min, [(125)I]IAmF was able to produce cross-linked products in both triethylamine and methanol, with a reactivity pattern similar to that found in benzophenone photochemistry. As a final test of suitability as a photoaffinity label, specific labeling of the beta(2)AR in membranes (protectable by 10 microM alprenolol) was demonstrated. [(125)I]IAmF represents a new class of beta(2)AR photoaffinity labels that can directly probe the catechol-analogous antagonist pharmacophore binding site in the beta(2)AR ligand binding pocket.", 
    "119": "This study aimed to assess the relevance of specific potassium channels, such as inwardly or outwardly rectifying and calcium-regulated potassium channels, to the control of renin secretion. For this purpose we examined the effects of the K+ channel blockers 4-aminopyridine (1 mmol/l), barium (100 micromol/l), tetraethylammonium (2 mmol/l) and apamin (200 nmol/l) on basal renin secretion, on renin secretion stimulated by isoproterenol (10 nmol/l) and on the inhibition of renin secretion by angiotensin II (100-300 pmol/l) in the isolated rat kidney perfused at constant pressure. Whilst all four K+ channel blockers increased renal vascular resistance, only 4-aminopyridine and barium attenuated isoproterenol-stimulated renin secretion in an additive fashion and augmented the inhibitory effect of angiotensin II. These effects of K+ channel blockers were not changed by the L-type calcium channel blocker amlodipine (5 pmol/l), indicating that their effects on renin secretion are not due to voltage-operated calcium influx. Our data, moreover, suggest that potassium efflux from renal juxtaglomerular cells is not important for the inhibitory action of angiotensin II on renin secretion. As a consequence it appears that the membrane potential of renal juxtaglomerular cells per se is relevant to renin secretion such that membrane depolarization inhibits the exocytosis of renin whilst hyperpolarization favors renin secretion. By their activity, potassium channels can contribute to membrane hyperpolarization and thus facilitate renin secretion.", 
    "120": "[1] We have previously shown that the beta-adrenergic/5-HT1 receptor partial agonist (-)-pindolol (2.0-32.0 micromol kg(-1)) enhances the increase in forward locomotion in rats produced by the 5-HT2 receptor agonist DOI (0.7 micromol kg(-1)) via net activation of post-synaptic 5-HT2 receptors. [2] It was found that neither the 5-HT1A receptor agonist and partial agonist, (+/-) 8-OH-DPAT (0.2-2.4 micromol kg(-1)) and (S)-(-)-UH-301, respectively, nor the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (0.09-1.5 micromol kg(-1)), substituted for (-)-pindolol in this in vivo behavioral model. [3] This also applies to the 5-HT1B receptor agonist and antagonist anpirtoline (0.3-4.0 micromol kg(-1)) and isamoltane (1.0-64.0 micromol kg(-1)), respectively. Neither of these compounds mimicked (-)-pindolol in its interactions with DOI. [4] The (-)-pindolol/DOI-induced increase in forward locomotion could be antagonized by the beta1 adrenoceptor antagonist betaxolol (24 micromol kg(-1)). [5] It is suggested that the intrinsic efficacy of (-)-pindolol at beta-adrenoceptors is an important aspect of its in vivo pharmacodynamic profile.",

This coincided with an increase in ticlopidine use from 3.6% in 1994 to 62.1% in 1997 (P < .001) and in abciximab use from 2.7% in 1995 to 63.2% in 1997 (P < .001). An increase in beta-blocker (58.3% to 75.3%; P < .001), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (0.9% to 40.0%; P < .001), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase use (1.9% to 40.5%; P < .001) as well as a decrease in calcium channel antagonist (34.3% to 8.4%; P < .001) use occurred on discharge. From 1991 through 1997, there was a significant decrease in the 30-day mortality rate (10.1% to 5.2%; P = .05). The 1-year mortality rate also decreased (13.4% in 1991 to 10.4% in 1997) (P = .09).

Data from the National Center for Health Statistics' National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys for 1980, 1985, 1990, and 1995 were used. From 1980 to 1995, there was no significant trend in the percentage of hypertension visits that did not mention any antihypertensive drug (20% to 27%). Further analyses focused on those hypertension visits in which at least 1 antihypertensive drug was used. Across the years, antihypertensive drug visits mentioning calcium channel blockers or ACE inhibitors significantly increased; those noting diuretics significantly decreased. However, in 1995, antihypertensive drug visits that included a diuretic and/or a beta-adrenergic blocker equalled 53%; these are the antihypertensive drug classes preferred by the JNC V. Physician antihypertensive drug prescribing was generally consistent with the basic antihypertensive drug guidelines of the JNC reports.", 
    "126": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and endothelin system may both play a role in the pathogenesis of progressive renal injury. The aims of the present study were 3-fold: first, to explore the possible benefits of dual blockade of the RAS with an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin type 1(AT1) receptor antagonist; second, to examine the relative efficacy of endothelin A receptor antagonism (ETA-RA) compared with combined endothelin A/B receptor antagonism (ETA/B-RA); and third, to assess whether interruption of both RAS and endothelin system had any advantages over single-system blockade. Subtotally nephrectomized rats were studied as a model of progressive renal injury and randomly assigned to one of the following treatments for 12 weeks: perindopril (ACE inhibitor), irbesartan (AT1 receptor antagonist), BMS193884 (ETA-RA), bosentan (ETA/B-RA), and a combination of irbesartan with either perindopril or BMS193884. Treatment with irbesartan or perindopril was associated with an improved glomerular filtration rate and reductions in blood pressure, urinary protein excretion, glomerulosclerosis, and tubular injury in association with reduced gene expression of transforming growth factor-beta(1) and matrix protein type IV collagen. The combination of irbesartan with perindopril was associated with further reductions in blood pressure and urinary protein excretion. No beneficial effects of either BMS193884 or bosentan were noted. Furthermore, the addition of BMS193884 to irbesartan did not confer any additional benefits. These findings suggest that the RAS but not the endothelin system is a major mediator of progressive renal injury after renal mass reduction and that the combination of an AT1 receptor antagonist with an ACE inhibitor may have advantages over the single agent of RAS blocker treatment.",

Efficacy was determined through measurement of intraocular pressure; safety and tolerability were measured using reports of adverse events, a quality of life survey (Glaucoma Disability Index), heart rate, and blood pressure. Patients with an inadequate response in intraocular pressure after 1 month or those who experienced significant adverse events in the first month were switched to the alternative study arm and remained taking the alternative medication for a total of 4 months or left the study. The main outcome measure was clinical success, as determined by evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of drug treatment, and was achieved when the investigator recommended that the patient continue the treatment after completion of the study.",

    "131": "Skeletal muscle hypertrophy is promoted in vivo by administration of beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) agonists. Chicken skeletal muscle cells were treated with 1 microM isoproterenol, a strong betaAR agonist, between days 7 and 10 in culture. betaAR population increased by approximately 40% during this treatment; however, the ability of the cells to synthesize cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) was diminished by twofold. Neither the basal concentration of cAMP nor the quantity of myosin heavy chain (MHC) was affected by the 3-d exposure to isoproterenol. To understand further the relationship between intracellular cAMP levels, betaAR population, and muscle protein accumulation, intracellular cAMP levels were artificially elevated by treatment with 0-10 betaM forskolin for 3 d. The basal concentration of cAMP in forskolin-treated cells increased up to sevenfold in a dose-dependent manner. Increasing concentrations of forskolin also led to an increase in betaAR population, with a maximum increase of approximately 40-60% at 10 microM forskolin. A maximum increase of 40-50% in the quantity of MHC was observed at 0.2 microM forskolin, but higher concentrations of forskolin reduced the quantity of MHC back to control levels. At 0.2 microM forskolin, intracellular levels of cAMP were higher by approximately 35%, and the betaAR population was higher by approximately 30%. Neither the number of muscle nuclei fused into myotubes nor the percentage of nuclei in myotubes was affected by forskolin at any of the concentrations studied.", 
    "132": "This study seeks to confirm the progressive changes in cardiac output and heart rate previously reported with 8 h exposures to constant hypoxia, and to examine the role of sympathetic mechanisms in generating these changes. Responses of ten subjects to four 8 h protocols were compared: (1) air breathing with placebo; (2) isocapnic hypoxia (end-tidal PO2 = 50 mm Hg) with placebo; (3) isocapnic hypoxia with beta-blockade; and (4) air breathing with beta -blockade. Regular measurements of heart rate and cardiac output (using ultrasonography and N2O rebreathing techniques) were made with subjects seated in the upright position. The sensitivity of heart rate to rapid variations in hypoxia (GHR) and heart rate in the absence of hypoxia were measured at times 0, 4 and 8 h. No significant progressive effect of hypoxia on cardiac output was detected. There was a gradual rise in heart rate with hypoxia of 11+/-2 beats min(-1) in the placebo protocol and of 10+/-2 beats min(-1) in the beta-blockade protocol over 8 h, compared to the air breathing protocols. The rise in heart rate was progressive (P<0.001) and accompanied by progressive increases in both GHR (P<0.001) and heart rate measured in the absence of hypoxia (P<0.05). No significant effect of beta-blockade was detected on any of these progressive changes. We conclude that sympathetic mechanisms that act via beta -receptors play little role in the progressive changes in heart rate observed over 8 h of moderate hypoxia.",

Mouse strains characterized include C57BL/SJL, FVB/N, mdr 1a/1b (-/-), ob/ob and ACCA. 2. Human CYP probe substrates used for characterization of mouse CYP activities included bufuralol, testosterone, dextromethorphan, phenacetin, diclofenac and S-mephenytoin. Activities were compared with those obtained in human liver microsomes and in human recombinant enzyme preparations. All transgenic mouse strains showed similar apparent K(m) with bufuralol, testosterone and dextromethorphan which compared favourably with those observed in human liver microsomes. 3. K(m) for phenacetin O-deethylase and S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation were more variable across strains and in some cases demonstrated biphasic kinetics. Phenacetin O-deethylase activity was low in all mouse strains except FVB/N and mdr 1a/1b (-/-). Diclofenac 4-hydroxylation did not occur to any significant extent in the five strains of mouse evaluated here. 4. The findings suggest the validity of using five of the probes for transgenic mouse hepatic CYP characterization and gross comparison with data generated with human CYP.", 
    "138": "The mechanism underlying acute changes in secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) remains to be determined. In this experiment, sIgA and cardiovascular activity were monitored at rest and while participants performed a mental arithmetic task, cold pressor, and submaximal cycle exercise following placebo or 1 mg of the alpha-adrenergic blocker, doxazosin. Under placebo, the tasks produced patterns of cardiovascular activity indicative of combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic, alpha-adrenergic, and beta-adrenergic activation, respectively. Doxazosin was associated with reduced blood pressure during cold pressor, but not during arithmetic or exercise. Mental arithmetic elicited increases in sIgA concentration and exercise produced increases in both sIgA concentration and secretion rate; these changes were unaffected by alpha blockade. In contrast, the cold pressor was associated with decreases in both sIgA concentration and secretion rate, which were blocked by doxazosin. These data suggest that acute decreases, but not increases, in sIgA are mediated by alpha-adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "139": "Alginic acid was evaluated as a potential vehicle in ophthalmic solutions for prolonging the therapeutic effect of carteolol. This anionic vehicle was expected to slow down drug elimination by the lacrimal flow, both by undergoing in-situ gel formation and by interacting with the mucus. In vitro studies indicated that carteolol is released slowly from alginic acid formulations, suggesting an ionic interaction. The adhesive behavior of alginic acid solution was better than that of another polymer, hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC). Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements of rabbit eyes treated with a 1% carteolol formulation with or without alginic acid showed that this polymer significantly extended the duration of the pressure-reducing effect of carteolol to 8 h. The increased ocular bioavailability of 1% carteolol in the presence of alginic acid led to an equivalent concentration in the target tissue although administration was only once a day compared with twice a day for 1% carteolol alone. The overall results of this study indicate that the alginic-acid vehicle is an excellent drug carrier, well tolerated, and could be used for the development of a long-acting ophthalmic formulation of carteolol.",

These data show that injection of 5-methylurapidil into the LH prior to ANG II into the SFO increased the water and sodium intake induced by the injection of ANG II. The present data also show that atenolol (a beta(1)-adrenergic antagonist), ICI-118,551, cyclazosin, or efaroxan injected into the LH reduced in a dose-dependent manner the water and sodium intake to angiotensinergic activation of SFO. Thus, the alpha(1)- and beta-adrenoceptors of the LH are possibly involved with central mechanisms dependent on ANG II and SFO that control water and sodium intake.",

There are insufficient data for any conclusions about the effect on perinatal mortality or preterm delivery. Beta-blockers seem to be associated with an increase in small for gestational age infants (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.01-1.79). Maternal hospital admission may be decreased, neonatal bradycardia increased and respiratory distress syndrome decreased, but these outcomes are only reported in a very small proportion of trials. Eleven trials (787 women) compared beta-blockers with methyldopa. Beta-blockers appear to be no more effective and probably equally as safe (from maternal and perinatal perspectives) as methyldopa. Single small trials have compared beta-blockers with hydralazine and with nicardipine. It is unusual for women to change drugs due to side effects.", 
    "147": "The improvement in control of maternal blood pressure with use of beta-blockers would be worthwhile only if it were reflected in other more substantive benefits for the mother and/or baby, and none have yet been clearly demonstrated. The effect of beta-blockers on perinatal outcome is uncertain, given that the worrying trend to an increase in small for gestational age infants is partly dependent on one small outlying trial. Large, randomised controlled trials are needed to determine whether antihypertensive therapy in general (rather than beta-blocker therapy specifically) results in benefits that outweigh the risks for treatment of mild-moderate pregnancy hypertension. If so, then it would be appropriate to look at which antihypertensive is best. Beta-blockers would remain a candidate class of agents.",

In this study, we have pharmacologically characterized the beta 2AR and determined the impact of glucocorticoids on beta 2AR gene transcription in SPOC1 cells, a continuous cell line derived from the tracheal epithelium of rats. [125I]Cyanoiodopindolol assays demonstrated that binding to SPOC1 cell membranes was saturable (Bmax = 62.6 +/- 6 fmol/mg protein) and of high affinity (Kd = 6.3 +/- 0.8 pM). From competition experiments, the rank order of potency of agonists (isoproterenol > epinephrine > norepinephrine) and the high affinity (Ki = 0.37 +/- 0.05 nM) of the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 suggested the predominance of the beta 2AR subtype. Two isoforms of the alpha subunit of Gs (45 and 52 kDa) were identified by Western blot analysis. Isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP levels increased in a dose-dependent manner, confirming that SPOC1 cell beta 2ARs are functionally coupled to adenylyl cyclase. The effect of glucocorticoids on beta 2AR expression was assessed in radioligand and transient transfection assays. Dexamethasone treatment of SPOC1 cells increased both beta 2AR protein and beta 2AR-luciferase fusion gene expression 1.6- to 3.1-fold, with the greatest increase demonstrated in cells cultured at low density compared to cells grown at high density.",

All these systemic side effects were significantly more frequent in patients older than 60 years (p<0.05). They did not seem to be influenced by an intercurrent illness or a systemic concurrent treatment with drugs potentially acting with the noradrenergic transmission (monoamine oxydase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, mianserine, alpha-sympatholytics.). Brimonidine was interrupted in 82 patients (64.1%) secondary to a systemic intolerance in 21 patients, an allergic blepharo-conjunctivitis in 12 patients, and a non optimal IOP reduction in 42 patients. Considering the all patients and treatments, IOP dropped from 20.5 +/- 3.6mmHg to 19.8 +/- 4.6mmHg at the last examination (p<0.05).

    "160": "beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists significantly reduce the incidence of sudden cardiac death in patients with contractile dysfunction. Contractile dysfunction is associated with a decline in beta(1)-adrenoceptors, no change in the number of beta(2)-adrenoceptors, and an increased responsiveness to beta(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation. Selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor blockade prevents ventricular fibrillation in a canine model of sudden cardiac death. Cardiac beta(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation increases L-type Ca(2+) currents, but unlike beta(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation, it fails to elicit phospholamban phosphorylation. Restoration of resting diastolic [Ca(2+)] following beta(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated increases in Ca(2+) influx is more dependent on Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange, which generates an arrhythmogenic transient inward current that can trigger ventricular fibrillation.", 
    "161": "The 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) transporter (5-HTT) is important in terminating serotonergic neurotransmission and is a primary target for many psychotherapeutic drugs. Study of the regulation of 5-HTT activity is therefore important in understanding the control of serotonergic neurotransmission. Using high-speed chronoamperometry, we have demonstrated that local application of 5-HT(1B) antagonists into the CA3 region of the hippocampus prolongs the clearance of 5-HT from extracellular fluid (ECF). In the present study, we demonstrate that the 5-HT(1B) antagonist cyanopindolol does not produce this effect by increasing release of endogenous 5-HT or by directly binding to the 5-HTT. Dose-response studies showed that the potency of cyanopindolol to inhibit clearance of 5-HT was equivalent to that of the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine. Local application of the 5-HT(1A) antagonist WAY 100635 did not alter 5-HT clearance, suggesting that the effect of cyanopindolol to prolong clearance is not via a mechanism involving 5-HT(1A) receptors. Finally, the effect of low doses of cyanopindolol and fluvoxamine to inhibit clearance of 5-HT from ECF was additive. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of terminal 5-HT(1B) autoreceptors increases 5-HTT activity.", 
    "162": "The molecular mechanisms associated with thyroid hormone (TH)-induced maturation of astrocytes have been studied using primary cultures. We have previously demonstrated that unlike normal astrocyte cultures, hypothyroid cultures fail to differentiate from flat polygonal cells with epithelioid morphology into mature process-bearing cells with stellate morphology. Addition of TH to the hypothyroid cells reverses the effect, and astrocytes transform into stellate cells. The beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) agonist isoproterenol (ISP) has a similar effect, whereas simultaneous addition of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol blocks the differentiation induced by TH or ISP. Addition of TH or ISP to hypothyroid cultures is also associated with a decrease in the level of filamentous cytoskeletal (F(i)) actin and an increase in the level of actin mRNA. Although addition of propranolol inhibited the decline in the level of F(i) actin in the TH- or ISP-supplemented cells as well as the induction of actin mRNA by TH, it partially inhibited the ISP-induced actin mRNA in these cultures. The hormone-induced maturation appears to be selectively regulated through the beta(2)-AR. The overall results indicate that the beta-adrenergic system plays an obligatory role in promoting TH-induced differentiation and maturation of astrocytes and in regulating the hormone-induced expression of actin and its intracellular organization in a way conducive to the morphological differentiation of the cells.",

Major imbalances in baseline blood pressure between treatment and control groups have made the interpretation of these results difficult. Intravenous calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and oral CCBs significantly lowered late blood pressure as compared to controls.

Thus, besides its beta-2-adrenoceptor antagonist properties, ICI 118.551 presented other pharmacological actions.", 
    "171": "In albino rats, infarctoid myocardial lesions were produced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of isoproterenol (75 mg/kg, during 3 days). In other groups, the descending anterior left coronary artery was ligated. In both experimental settings, the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of (+/-) propranolol (100-200-300 microg/animal/day, during 7 days) or (+/-) verapamil (40-80-160 microg/animal/day, during 7 days) afforded a significant protection (with the exception of the lowest dose) on the investigated parameters: arrhythmias, ischemic zone (in coronary ligated rats), lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase activity of the serum, focal necrosis (in isoproterenol treated rats). This protective activity is lower than that afforded by i.p. administered (+/-) propranolol (5 mg/kg, during seven days) or (+/-) verapamil (5 mg/kg, during seven days). From these data it may be concluded that (+/-) propranolol and (+/-) verapamil have a protective action on the experimental myocardial ischemia and necrosis in rats, not only when the drugs come in direct contact with the heart, but also acting upon the central nervous system.", 
    "172": "In experiment on anesthetized dogs and cats in was shown that the new water-soluble copolymer initiated depressive reaction characteristic for beta-adrenomimetics. This effect was levelled with the help of non-selective adrenoblockator--propranololum. In experiment on dogs the preliminary treatment with propranololum decreased the therapeutic antiradiation efficiency of the copolymer from 68.4 to 8.3%.", 
    "173": "Despite abundant evidence that systemic administration of adrenergic drugs and hormones can produce retrograde memory enhancement, the literature contains no clear demonstration that postlearning systemic administration of adrenergic antagonists produces retrograde amnesia. Here we demonstrate retrograde amnesia for a stressful learning task (a spatial water maze) with systemic administration of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (5 mg/kg). The amnesic effect of the drug depended on the degree of learning in the subjects: Propranolol caused a robust retrograde amnesia in \"good learners,\" but did not significantly affect memory in \"poor learners.\" The findings provide critical additional support for the hypothesis that postlearning adrenergic activation modulates memory consolidation processes after emotionally stressful events and help explain previous failures to detect memory impairment after systemic administration of adrenergic blocking drugs.", 
    "174": "Metoprolol, a relatively selective beta1-blocker, is devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and possesses weak membrane stabilising activity. The drug has an established role in the management of essential hypertension and angina pectoris, and more recently, in patients with chronic heart failure. The effects of metoprolol controlled-release/extended-release (CR/XL) in patients with stable, predominantly mild to moderate (NYHA functional class II to III) chronic heart failure have been evaluated in the large Metoprolol CR/XL Randomised Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) trial and the much smaller Randomized Evaluation of Strategies for Left Ventricular Dysfunction (RESOLVD) pilot study. Treatment with metoprolol CR/XL was initiated at a low dosage of 12.5 to 25 mg once daily and gradually increased at 2-weekly intervals until the target dosage (200 mg once daily) or maximal tolerated dosage had been attained in patients receiving standard therapy for heart failure. At 12 months, metoprolol CR/XL was associated with a 34% reduction in relative risk of all-cause mortality in patients with chronic heart failure due to ischaemic or dilated cardiomyopathy in the MERIT-HF trial. The incidence of sudden death and death due to progressive heart failure were both significantly decreased with metoprolol CR/XL. Similarly, a trend towards decreased mortality in the metoprolol CR/XL group compared with placebo was observed in the RESOLVD trial. Data from small numbers of patients with severe (NYHA functional class IV) heart failure indicate that metoprolol CR/XL is effective in this subset of patients. However, no firm conclusions can yet be drawn. Improvement from baseline values in NYHA functional class, exercise capacity and some measures of quality of life with metoprolol CR/XL or immediate-release metoprolol were significantly greater than those with placebo. The drug is well tolerated when treatment is initiated in low dosages and gradually increased at intervals of 1 to 2 weeks.", 
    "175": "Metoprolol CR/XL effectively decreases mortality and improves clinical status in patients with stable mild to moderate (NYHA functional class II or III) chronic heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and the drug is effective in patients with ischaemic or dilated cardiomyopathy. Although limited data indicate that metoprolol CR/XL is effective in patients with severe (NYHA functional class IV) chronic heart failure, more data are needed to confirm these findings. Treatment with metoprolol CR/XL significantly reduced the incidence of sudden death and death due to progressive heart failure."
