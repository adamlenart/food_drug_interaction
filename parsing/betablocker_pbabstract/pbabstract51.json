    "0": "Neuromodulators released during and after a fearful experience promote the consolidation of long-term memory for that experience. Because overconsolidation may contribute to the recurrent and intrusive memories of post-traumatic stress disorder, neuromodulatory receptors provide a potential pharmacological target for prevention. Stimulation of muscarinic receptors promotes memory consolidation in several conditioning paradigms, an effect primarily associated with the M1 receptor (M1R). However, neither inhibiting nor genetically disrupting M1R impairs the consolidation of cued fear memory. Using the M1R agonist cevimeline and antagonist telenzepine, as well as M1R knock-out mice, we show here that M1R, along with \u03b22-adrenergic (\u03b22AR) and D5-dopaminergic (D5R) receptors, regulates the consolidation of cued fear memory by redundantly activating phospholipase C (PLC) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). We also demonstrate that fear memory consolidation in the BLA is mediated in part by neuromodulatory inhibition of the M-current, which is conducted by KCNQ channels and is known to be inhibited by muscarinic receptors. Manipulating the M-current by administering the KCNQ channel blocker XE991 or the KCNQ channel opener retigabine reverses the effects on consolidation caused by manipulating \u03b22AR, D5R, M1R, and PLC. Finally, we show that cAMP and protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) signaling relevant to this stage of consolidation is upstream of these neuromodulators and PLC, suggesting an important presynaptic role for cAMP/PKA in consolidation. These results support the idea that neuromodulatory regulation of ion channel activity and neuronal excitability is a critical mechanism for promoting consolidation well after acquisition has occurred.",

    "6": "Current pharmacological models for determining affinity and kinetics of drugs for membrane receptors assume the interacting molecules are homogeneously distributed in the bulk aqueous phase. The phospholipid membrane can, however, provide a second compartment into which drugs can partition, particularly lipophilic/basic compounds. In this study we measured the phospholipid affinity and receptor binding kinetics of several clinically relevant \u03b22-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists and demonstrated that the degree of phospholipid interaction directly affects the observed kinetic association rate (k on) and dissociation constant (Kd), but not the dissociation rate (k off) from the target, by concentrating drug in the local environment around the receptor. When the local drug concentration was accounted for, the k on was comparable across the cohort and the corrected Kd was directly related to the k off. In conclusion, we propose a new approach to determining the pharmacology of drugs for membrane targets that accounts for differences in local drug concentration brought about by direct affinity for phospholipids, establishing \"micro-pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships\" for drugs.", 
    "7": "Autonomic control of heart rate is mediated by cardioinhibitory parasympathetic cholinergic neurons located in the brainstem and stimulatory sympathetic noradrenergic neurons. During embryonic development the survival and cholinergic phenotype of brainstem autonomic neurons is promoted by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We now provide evidence that BDNF regulates heart rate by a mechanism involving increased brainstem cardioinhibitory parasympathetic activity. Mice with a BDNF haploinsufficiency exhibit elevated resting heart rate, and infusion of BDNF intracerebroventricularly reduces heart rate in both wild-type and BDNF+/- mice. The atropine-induced elevation of heart rate is diminished in BDNF+/- mice and is restored by BDNF infusion, whereas the atenolol-induced decrease in heart rate is unaffected by BDNF levels, suggesting that BDNF signaling enhances parasympathetic tone which is diminished with BDNF haploinsufficiency. Whole-cell recordings from pre-motor cholinergic cardioinhibitory vagal neurons in the nucleus ambiguus indicate that BDNF haploinsufficiency reduces cardioinhibitory vagal neuron activity by increased inhibitory GABAergic and diminished excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission to these neurons. Our findings reveal a previously unknown role for BDNF in the control of heart rate by a mechanism involving increased activation of brainstem cholinergic parasympathetic neurons.",

    "11": "Successes in the field of respiratory medicines are largely limited to three main target classes: \u03b22 -adrenergic receptor agonists, muscarinic antagonists and corticosteroids. A significant factor in attrition during the development of respiratory medicines is the induction of foamy macrophage responses, particularly, in rats. The term foamy macrophage describes a vacuolated cytoplasmic appearance, seen by light microscopy, which is ultrastructurally characterized by the presence of lysosomal lamellar bodies, neutral lipid droplets or drug particles. We propose a simple classification, based light-heartedly on the theme 'the good, the bad and the ugly', which allows important distinctions to be made between phenotypes, aetiologies and adversity. Foamy macrophages induced in rat lungs by exposure to inhaled \u03b22 -agonists, antimuscarinics and corticosteroids are simple aggregates of uniform cells without other associated pathologies. In contrast, macrophage reactions induced by some other inhaled drug classes are more complex, associated with neutrophilic or lymphocytic infiltrations with/without damage to the adjacent alveolar walls. Foamy macrophage responses induced by inhaled drugs may be ascribed to either phagocytosis of poorly soluble drug particles, or to pharmacology. Both corticosteroids and \u03b22 -agonists increase surfactant synthesis whereas muscarinic antagonists may decrease surfactant breakdown, due to inhibition of phospholipase C, both of which lead to phagocytosis of excess surfactant. Simple foamy macrophage responses are considered non-adverse, whereas ones that are more complex are designated as adverse. The development of foamy macrophage responses has led to confusion in interpretation and we hope this review helps clarify what is in fact a relatively simple, predictable, easily interpretable, commonly induced change.",

Persistent elevation of insulin demand increases \u03b2-cell number through self-replication or differentiation (neogenesis) as part of a compensatory response. However, it is not well understood how a persistent increase in insulin demand is detected. We have previously demonstrated that a persistent increase in insulin demand by overnutrition induces compensatory \u03b2-cell differentiation in zebrafish. Here, we use a series of pharmacological and genetic analyses to show that prolonged stimulation of existing \u03b2-cells is necessary and sufficient for this compensatory response. In the absence of feeding, tonic, but not intermittent, pharmacological activation of \u03b2-cell secretion was sufficient to induce \u03b2-cell differentiation. Conversely, drugs that block \u03b2-cell secretion, including an ATP-sensitive potassium (K ATP) channel agonist and an L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, suppressed overnutrition-induced \u03b2-cell differentiation. Genetic experiments specifically targeting \u03b2-cells confirm existing \u03b2-cells as the overnutrition sensor. First, inducible expression of a constitutively active K ATP channel in \u03b2-cells suppressed the overnutrition effect. Second, inducible expression of a dominant-negative K ATP mutant induced \u03b2-cell differentiation independent of nutrients. Third, sensitizing \u03b2-cell metabolism by transgenic expression of a hyperactive glucokinase potentiated differentiation. Finally, ablation of the existing \u03b2-cells abolished the differentiation response. Taken together, these data establish that overnutrition induces \u03b2-cell differentiation in larval zebrafish through prolonged activation of \u03b2-cells. These findings demonstrate an essential role for existing \u03b2-cells in sensing overnutrition and compensating for their own insufficiency by recruiting additional \u03b2-cells.",

A crossover clinical study was performed in 10 healthy volunteers to assess the effect of single-dose and repeated quercetin intake on the pharmacokinetics of talinolol, a substrate of intestinal P-glycoprotein. Unexpectedly, mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-48h) and maximal plasma concentration (cmax) were slightly decreased following concomitant and short-term quercetin administration (3186.0 versus 2468.3 and 2527.7 ng h/ml, p>0.05; 309.7 versus 212.0 and 280.6 ng/ml, p>0.05). Individual analysis revealed that talinolol AUC0-48h was lowered by 23.9% up to 60.6% in 5 subjects and cmax was decreased by 29.2% up to 78.7% in 7 subjects after quercetin co-administration. These effects were less pronounced following repeated quercetin intake. Overlapping modification of efflux and uptake transport involving carrier proteins of the OATP superfamily as well as site-dependent interaction are possible explanations for these observations. In conclusion, clinically relevant quercetin-drug interaction cannot be ruled out.",

A 3(2) full factorial design was employed to optimize the tablets, where content of polymer blend (X1) and ratio of xanthan gum-to-guar gum (X2) were considered as independent variables. The effects of independent variables on dependent variables, i.e. floating time, diffusion exponent, and time to release 50% of atenolol were evaluated. The in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters of the optimized formulation were compared with the marketed sustained release formulation of atenolol (Aten(\u00ae)). The optimized formulation containing 20% (w/w) of polymer blend and 50:50 ratio of xanthan gum-to-guar gum was able to float more than 12h and showed the desired sustained drug release from the tablets. In vivo retention studies in rabbit stomach showed the gastric residence of tablet up to 6h. The in vivo study of optimized tablets illustrated significant improvement in the oral bioavailability of atenolol in rabbits. It can be concluded that floating matrix tablet of atenolol prepared by using xanthan gum and guar gum has potential for sustained release of the drug as well as improved oral bioavailability through enhanced gastric residence time of formulation in stomach.",

    "45": "Gastrointestinal dysmotility is one of the nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Gastroparesis and upregulated \u03b2-adrenoceptors (\u03b2-ARs) have been reported in rats with bilateral microinjection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the substantia nigra, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. The aim of the current study is to investigate the role of \u03b2-ARs in gastroparesis in 6-OHDA rats. Gastric motility was studied through strain gauge measurement. Immunofluorescence, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were performed to examine the expression of \u03b2-ARs. Norepinephrine (NE) inhibited gastric motility in a dose-dependent fashion in both control and 6-OHDA rats, but much stronger adrenergic reactivity was observed in the 6-OHDA rats. The inhibition of gastric motility by NE in both control and 6-OHDA rats was not affected by tetrodotoxin, a neural sodium channel blocker. Blocking \u03b21-AR or \u03b22-AR did not affect the inhibition of strip contraction by NE in control rats, but \u03b21-AR blockage obviously enhanced the half maximal inhibitory concentration value of NE in 6-OHDA rats. Selective inhibition of \u03b23-AR blocked the effect of NE significantly in both control and 6-OHDA rats. The protein expression of \u03b21-AR, but not \u03b22-AR and \u03b23-AR in gastric muscularis externa was increased significantly in 6-OHDA rats. In conclusion, \u03b23-AR involves the regulation of gastric motility in control rats, whereas the upregulation of \u03b21-AR is responsible for enhanced NE reactivity in 6-OHDA rats and therefore is involved in the formation of gastroparesis. The effect of both \u03b21-AR and \u03b23-AR on gastric motility is independent of the enteric nervous system.",

    "49": "Synaptic plasticity comprises a cellular mechanism through which the hippocampus most likely enables memory formation. Neuromodulation, related to arousal, is a key aspect in information storage. The activation of locus coeruleus (LC) neurons by novel experience leads to noradrenaline release in the hippocampus at the level of the dentate gyrus (DG). We explored whether synaptic plasticity in the DG is influenced by activation of the LC via electrical stimulation. Coupling of test-pulses that evoked stable basal synaptic transmission in the DG with stimulation of the LC induced \u03b2-adrenoreceptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD) at perforant path-DG synapses in adult rats. Furthermore, persistent LTD (>24 h) induced by perforant path stimulation also required activation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors: Whereas a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist (propranolol) prevented, an agonist (isoproterenol) strengthened the persistence of LTD for over 24 h. These findings support the hypothesis that persistent LTD in the DG is modulated by \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, LC activation potently facilitates DG LTD. This suggests in turn that synaptic plasticity in the DG is tightly regulated by activity in the noradrenergic system. This may reflect the role of the LC in selecting salient information for subsequent synaptic processing in the hippocampus.",

The goals of rate control, prevention of heart failure and alleviation of atrial fibrillation related symptoms, normally can be achieved by pharmacological agents slowing the conduction in the AV node (e. g. \u03b2-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin). For patients remaining symptomatic despite sufficient rate control adding a rhythm control strategy may be considered. The currently available antiarrhythmic drugs (e. g. flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, dronedarone, amiodarone) are characterized by a rather low efficacy in maintaining sinus rhythm and various possibly life threatening side effects.

Tail artery pulse amplitude fell acutely when the intruder rat was introduced, possibly contributing to the increases in body and brain temperature. Prior blockade of \u03b23 adrenoceptors (SR59230A 10 mg/kg ip) significantly reduced the amplitude of each temperature increase. Intruder-evoked increases in BAT temperature were similar in resident rats maintained at 11\u00b0C for 3 days.

The most pronounced effect was characteristic of beta-adrenoblockers atenolol, propranolol, and carvedilol. The lower activity was demonstrated by other adrenoblockers that had no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, as well as captopril. However, positive effect of these drugs on rat survival occurred regardless of their action on the sympathoadrenal system. The ACE inhibitors, particularly hydrophilic lysinopril, to the lesser degree than beta-adrenoblockers, prevented death of animals at the period of the CHF decompensation. The combined use of ACE inhibitors with beta-adrenoblockers, especially with carvedilol, promoted the maximally expressed decrease of the sympathoadrenal activity and an increase of the rat survival, including that at the CHF decompensation.",

    "125": "This work aims to elucidate the mechanism by which N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) enhances the skin permeation of a compound by combining experimental data with molecular dynamic (MD) simulations.

No significant alterations in the stratum corneum structure were found after the in vitro treatment of human epidermis with NMP dispersed in mineral oil or water by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) analyses. MD simulations revealed the formation of a complex by H-bonds and the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions between the NMP's amido group and the drug's aromatic systems. The size of the depicted NMP/PR clusters was in line with the hydrodynamic radius derived by dynamic light scattering analyses (\u223c 2.00 nm). Conversely, no interaction, and consequently cluster formation, between NMP and HC occurred. These results suggest that NMP is effective in enhancing the drug permeation through human epidermis by a cotransport mechanism when NMP/drug interaction occurs.",

We address the concern that a traumatized witness may be less effective in a prosecution emerging from the traumatic event after memory dampening treatment. We analyze this issue in relation to sexual assault, where the suggestion that corroborating evidence may remedy any memory defects is less likely to be helpful. We also consider the clinical ethical question about a physician's obligation to discuss potential legal consequences of memory dampening treatment. We conclude that this latter question reflects a general problem related to novel medical treatments where the broader socio-legal consequences may be poorly understood, and suggest that issues of this sort could usefully be addressed through the promulgation of practice guidelines.",

    "132": "According to memory reconsolidation theory, when long-term memory is reactivated by relevant clues, the memory traces become labile, which can be altered by pharmacological manipulations. Accumulating evidence reveals that memory related to drug abuse can be erased by disrupting reconsolidation process. We used an animal model that could simultaneously measure conditioned hyperactivity and locomotor sensitization induced by morphine. \u03b2-Adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol or saline were administered following conditioned stimuli (CS) or a small dose of morphine reactivation. The results showed that the conditioned hyperactivity could be disrupted by propranolol treatment following CS reactivation. However, the expression of locomotor sensitization could not be disrupted by propranolol administration following CS or morphine reactivation. Furthermore, morphine injection and propranolol intervention enhanced the locomotor sensitization effect. These data suggest that blocking the reconsolidation process can disrupt the conditioned hyperactivity induced by environmental cues associated with morphine treatment, but not morphine-induced locomotor sensitization.",

This pattern of cardiovascular defects appears to be expressed along a spectrum of severity in many heritable connective tissue disorders and raises suspicion of a relationship between the normal development of connective tissues and the cardiovascular system. Given the evidence of increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) signaling in MFS and LDS, this signaling pathway may represent the common link in this relationship. To further explore this hypothetical link, this chapter will review the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, heritable connective tissue syndromes related to TGF-\u03b2 receptor (TGFBR) mutations, and discuss the pathogenic contribution of TGF-\u03b2 to these syndromes with a primary focus on the cardiovascular system.",

The genetic cause is heterogeneous and includes mutations in genes encoding for components of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) signalling pathway: TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3 and TGFB2. Despite the loss of function nature of these mutations, the patient-derived aortic tissues show evidence of increased (rather than decreased) TGF\u03b2 signalling. These insights offer new options for therapeutic interventions.",

Medical, surgical and basic research advances over the last two decades have had a major positive impact on the clinical management of MFS patients. Life expectancy has increased significantly, more discriminating diagnostic criteria have been developed, a number of new clinical entities have been recognized, and exciting opportunities for drug-based therapy have emerged. Despite such a remarkable progress, MFS diagnosis remains difficult and aortic disease progression is very heterogeneous and clinical outcome is unpredictable. Ongoing research efforts are therefore exploiting animal models of MFS to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, genetic, epigenetic and environmental modifiers and druggable biological targets.", 
    "136": "KCNQ (Kv7 family) potassium (K(+)) channels were recently found in airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) from rodent and human bronchioles. In the present study, we evaluated expression of KCNQ channels and their role in constriction/relaxation of rat airways. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed expression of KCNQ4 > KCNQ5 > KCNQ1 > KCNQ2 > KCNQ3, and patch-clamp electrophysiology detected KCNQ currents in rat ASMCs. In precision-cut lung slices, the KCNQ channel activator retigabine induced a concentration-dependent relaxation of small bronchioles preconstricted with methacholine (MeCh; EC50 = 3.6 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM). Bronchoconstriction was also attenuated in the presence of two other structurally unrelated KCNQ channel activators: zinc pyrithione (ZnPyr; 1 \u03bcM; 22 \u00b1 7%) and 2,5-dimethylcelecoxib (10 \u03bcM; 24 \u00b1 8%). The same three KCNQ channel activators increased KCNQ currents in ASMCs by two- to threefold. The bronchorelaxant effects of retigabine and ZnPyr were prevented by inclusion of the KCNQ channel blocker XE991. A long-acting \u03b22-adrenergic receptor agonist, formoterol (10 nM), did not increase KCNQ current amplitude in ASMCs, but formoterol (1-1,000 nM) did induce a time- and concentration-dependent relaxation of rat airways, with a notable desensitization during a 30-min treatment or with repetitive treatments. Coadministration of retigabine (10 \u03bcM) with formoterol produced a greater peak and sustained reduction of MeCh-induced bronchoconstriction and reduced the apparent desensitization observed with formoterol alone. Our findings support a role for KCNQ K(+) channels in the regulation of airway diameter. A combination of a \u03b22-adrenergic receptor agonist with a KCNQ channel activator may improve bronchodilator therapy.", 
    "137": "Forehead cooling activates the sympathetic nervous system and can trigger angina pectoris in susceptible individuals. However, the effect of forehead cooling on coronary blood flow velocity (CBV) is not well understood. In this human experiment, we tested the hypotheses that forehead cooling reduces CBV (i.e., coronary vasoconstriction) and that this vasoconstrictor effect would be enhanced under systemic \u03b2-adrenergic blockade. A total of 30 healthy subjects (age range, 23-79 years) underwent Doppler echocardiography evaluation of CBV in response to 60 s of forehead cooling (1\u00b0C ice bag on forehead). A subset of subjects (n = 10) also underwent the procedures after an intravenous infusion of propranolol. Rate pressure product (RPP) was used as an index of myocardial oxygen demand. Consistent with our first hypothesis, forehead cooling reduced CBV from 19.5 \u00b1 0.7 to 17.5 \u00b1 0.8 cm/s (P < 0.001), whereas mean arterial pressure increased by 11 \u00b1 2 mmHg (P < 0.001). Consistent with our second hypothesis, forehead cooling reduced CBV under propranolol despite a significant rise in RPP. The current studies indicate that forehead cooling elicits a sympathetically mediated pressor response and a reduction in CBV, and this effect is augmented under \u03b2-blockade. The results are consistent with sympathetic activation of \u03b2-receptor coronary vasodilation in humans, as has been demonstrated in animals.",

We have recently developed live-cell imaging-based, high-throughput screening methods capable of identifying factors that modulate pancreatic \u03b2-cell death, with the hope of finding drugs that can intervene in this process. In the present study, we used a high-content screen and the Prestwick Chemical Library of small molecules to identify drugs that block cell death resulting from exposure to a cocktail of cytotoxic cytokines (25 ng/mL TNF-\u03b1, 10 ng/mL IL-1\u03b2, and 10 ng/mL IFN-\u03b3). Data analysis with self-organizing maps revealed that 19 drugs had profiles similar to that of the no cytokine condition, indicating protection. Carbamazepine, an antiepileptic Na(+) channel inhibitor, was particularly interesting because Na(+) channels are not generally considered targets for antiapoptotic therapy in diabetes and because the function of these channels in \u03b2-cells has not been well studied. We analyzed the expression and characteristics of Na(+) currents in mature \u03b2-cells from MIP-GFP mice. We confirmed the dose-dependent protective effects of carbamazepine and another use-dependent Na(+) channel blocker in cytokine-treated mouse islet cells. Carbamazepine down-regulated the proapoptotic and endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling induced by cytokines. Together, these studies point to Na(+) channels as a novel therapeutic target in diabetes.",

In the current study we determined the effects of acute stroke on hepatic insulin signaling, TNF-\u03b1 expression, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the activities of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), inhibitor \u03baB kinase \u03b2 (IKK-\u03b2), and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathways. Rats with cerebral ischemia developed higher blood glucose, and insulin levels, and insulin resistance index, as well as hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme expression compared with the sham-treated group. The hepatic TNF-\u03b1 mRNA and protein levels were elevated in stroke rats in association with increased ER stress, phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and IKK-\u03b2 proteins, I\u03baB/NF-\u03baB signaling, and phosphorylation of insulin receptor-1 (IRS-1) at serine residue. The basal and insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and AKT proteins was reduced. In addition, acute stroke increased circulating catecholamines in association with hepatic adrenergic signaling activation. After administration of a nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker (propranolol) before induction of cerebral ischemic injury, hepatic adrenergic transduction, TNF-\u03b1 expression, ER stress, and the activation of the JNK1/2, IKK-\u03b2, and NF-\u03baB pathways, and serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 were all attenuated. In contrast, the phosphorylated IRS-1 at tyrosine site and AKT levels were partially restored with improved poststroke hyperglycemia and insulin resistance index. These results suggest that acute ischemic stroke can activate proinflammatory pathways in the liver by the catecholamines and is associated with the development of hepatic insulin resistance.",

The results showed that these 'emerging contaminants' were completely degraded, when the removal rate of organic matter reached 30.6% and 49.1% for ozonation and Fe2+/ozonation, respectively. Likewise, the aromaticity removal rates were 63.4% and 77.9% for ozonation and Fe2+/ozonation, respectively. The experimental design showed that pH was the variable which had the greatest effect on the Fe2+/ozonation. The kinetic constants of atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol degradation by direct ozonation complied with pseudo-first-order conditions, while Fe2+/ozonation was suited to a biphasic degradation model. The k obs tended to rise when the pH increases; propranolol showed high k obs, which can be attributed to the naphthalene group (an electron-rich moiety). The identification of degradation products was carried out in aqueous solution using HPLC-MS2, followed by a suggestion of degradation pathways by means of ozonation. The degradation products proved to be dependent on the initial pH, and followed pathways that are based on direct ozonolysis and free radicals.",

Functional concerns included ulceration (29.5%), periocular location with potential for visual interference (28.6%), airway interference (4.8%), PHACES syndrome (3.8%), auditory interference (0.95%) and visceral location with congestive heart failure (0.95%). The median age at beta-blocker initiation was 3.3 months; median duration of therapy was 10.6 months; and median maximal treatment dose was 1.5 mg/kg/day for propranolol and 1.6 mg/kg/day for atenolol. Ninety-nine patients (94.3%) responded to therapy with size reduction, colour changes, softened texture and/or healing of ulceration. Rebound growth requiring an additional course of therapy was observed in 23 patients. Side effects from beta-blockers included cool extremities (26.7%), irritability (17.1%), lower gastrointestinal upset (14.3%), emesis (11.4%), hypotension (10.5%), poor feeding (7.6%), lethargy (4.8%), bronchospasm (0.95%) and rash (0.95%). Side effects did not result in complete discontinuation of beta-blocker treatment in any case; however, they prompted a switch to a different beta-blocker preparation in some cases.

Major constituents were 1,8-cineol and delta-3-carene, which constituting 50% of the oil. In the isolated rabbit jejunum preparation Pa.Oil caused inhibition of spontaneous and high K+ (80 mM)-induced contractions, with respective EC50 values of 0.13 (0.08-0.20; n = 4) and 0.90 mg/mL (0.50-1.60; n = 5), thus showing that spasmolytic activity is mediated possibly through calcium channel blockade (CCB). The CCB activity was confirmed when pre-treatment of the tissue with Pa.Oil (0.03-0.1 mg/mL) caused a rightward shift in the Ca++ concentration-response curves, similar to that caused by verapamil, a standard calcium channel blocker. These data indicate that the essential oil of P. abrotanoides possesses spasmolytic activity mediated possibly through inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels, which may explain its medicinal use in colic and possibly diarrhea.",

In viral myocarditis, Parvovirus B19 was the most common identified agent, in concurrence with the increasing incidence documented recently. Inherited metabolic diseases were responsible for 11.5% of dilated cardiomyopathy cases compared with the 4-6% described in the literature, which reinforces the importance of considering this aetiology in differential diagnosis of paediatric dilated cardiomyopathy.

    "178": "Numerous risk factors for perioperative stroke have been identified and many are modifiable. Surgical patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease should be evaluated by a neurologist. Cardiac and cerebrovascular testing is critical in identifying patients at high risk for perioperative stroke. The identification and treatment of carotid disease in the context of upcoming surgery has been a source of controversy. Routine carotid revascularization performed with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery for incidentally discovered carotid stenosis is not recommended. Prior to aortic manipulation during CABG, epiaortic ultrasound should be performed to identify aortic atheromatous plaques. If possible, preoperative aspirin, beta blocker, statin, and angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy should be continued in the perioperative period. Patients who are prescribed anticoagulation at high risk of thromboembolism should receive bridging anticoagulation during the perioperative period. The identification and prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is central to stroke prevention. CABG patients should be initiated on beta blockade +/- amiodarone to prevent postoperative AF. Many practitioners have been traditionally nihilistic towards acute perioperative stroke treatment. Given the narrow therapeutic window of treatment options, candidacy is dependent on timely recognition. Intravenous and endovascular thrombolysis/therapies are viable options in selected patients under the guidance and expertise of a neurologist. This article will present the epidemiology of perioperative stroke, the pathophysiology, risk assessment and stratification for common surgeries. The article will additionally focus on treatment options including modifiable risk factor reduction and the perioperative management of medications.",

Ten healthy volunteers received a single oral dose of 30\u2009mg nadolol with green tea or water after repeated consumption of green tea (700\u2009ml/day) or water for 14 days. Catechin concentrations in green tea and plasma were determined. Green tea markedly decreased the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-48)) of nadolol by 85.3% and 85.0%, respectively (P < 0.01), without altering renal clearance of nadolol. The effects of nadolol on systolic blood pressure were significantly reduced by green tea. [(3)H]-Nadolol uptake assays in human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing the organic anion-transporting polypeptides OATP1A2 and OATP2B1 revealed that nadolol is a substrate of OATP1A2 (Michaelis constant (K(m)) = 84.3 \u03bcmol/l) but not of OATP2B1. Moreover, green tea significantly inhibited OATP1A2-mediated nadolol uptake (half-maximal inhibitory concentration, IC(50) = 1.36%). These results suggest that green tea reduces plasma concentrations of nadolol possibly in part by inhibition of OATP1A2-mediated uptake of nadolol in the intestine.", 
    "180": "Diabetes can disrupt endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis which leads to ER stress. ER stress-induced renal apoptosis seems to be involved in the development of diabetic nephropathy. The present study was designed to investigate the contribution of reduced ER stress to the beneficial effects of an angiotensin receptor blocker. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was induced by streptozotocin injections to hypertensive mRen2-transgenic rats. After 2weeks animals were treated with 0.7mg/kg/day irbesartan. Blood glucose, blood pressure and protein excretion were assessed. Expression of ER stress markers was measured by real-time PCR. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect markers of ER stress, renal damage and infiltrating cells. Glomerulosclerosis and apoptosis were evaluated. Diabetic mRen2-transgenic rats developed renal injury with proteinuria, tubulointerstitial cell proliferation as well as glomerulosclerosis and podocyte injury. Moreover, an increase in inflammation, podocyte ER stress and apoptosis was detected. Irbesartan somewhat lowered blood pressure and reduced proteinuria, tubulointerstitial cell proliferation and glomerulosclerosis. Podocyte damage was ameliorated but markers of ER stress (calnexin, grp78) and apoptosis were not reduced by irbesartan. On the other hand, inflammatory cell infiltration in the tubulointerstitium and the glomerulus was significantly attenuated. We conclude that irbesartan reduced renal damage even in a very low dose. The beneficial effects of low dose irbesartan were paralleled by a reduction of blood pressure and inflammation but not by a reduction of ER stress and apoptosis. Thus, sustained endoplasmic reticulum stress in the kidney does not necessarily lead to increased inflammation and tubulointerstitial or glomerular injury.", 
    "181": "Venules of the bladder suburothelium develop spontaneous phasic constrictions that may play a critical role in maintaining venular drainage of tissue metabolites. We aimed to investigate neurohumoral regulation of the spontaneous venular constrictions (SVCs). Changes in venular diameter of the rat bladder suburothelium were monitored using a video tracking system, whilst the effects of electrical field stimulation (EFS) and bath-applied bioactive substances were investigated. The innervation of the suburothelial microvasculature was examined by immunohistochemistry. EFS (10Hz for 30s) induced an increase in the frequency of SVCs that was prevented by phentolamine (1\u03bcM). In phentolamine-pretreated venules, EFS suppressed SVCs with a venular dilatation in a manner attenuated by propranolol (1\u03bcM) or l-nitro arginine (LNA, 10\u03bcM). BRL37344 (1\u03bcM), a \u03b23 adrenoceptor agonist, dilated venules and reduced the frequency of SVCs in an LNA-sensitive manner. ACh (1-10\u03bcM) increased the frequency of SVCs. ATP (1\u03bcM) transiently constricted venules and then caused LNA-sensitive cessation of SVCs associated with a dilatation. Substance P (100nM) caused a venular constriction, whilst calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP, 100nM) caused a dilatation of venules and suppression of SVCs that were not inhibited by LNA. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated sympathetic as well as substance P- and CGRP-containing nerves running along the venules. Spontaneous constrictions of suburothelial venules are accelerated by sympathetic \u03b1-adrenergic stimulation, but suppressed upon \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. In addition, suburothelial venular constrictions appear to be modulated by several bioactive substances that could be released from urothelium or suburothelial sensory nerves.", 
    "182": "Recent studies support the role of cysteine oxidation in actin cytoskeleton reorganization during cell adhesion. The aim of this study was to explain whether protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is responsible for the thiol-disulfide rearrangement in the \u03b2-actin molecule of adhering cells. First, we showed that PDI forms a disulfide-bonded complex with \u03b2-actin with a molecular mass of 110 kDa. Specific interaction of both proteins was demonstrated by a solid phase binding assay, surface plasmon resonance analysis, and immunoprecipitation experiments. Second, using confocal microscopy, we found that both proteins colocalized when spreading MEG-01 cells on fibronectin. Colocalization of PDI and \u03b2-actin could be abolished by the membrane-permeable sulfhydryl blocker, N-ethylmaleimide, by the RGD peptide, and by anti-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 antibodies. Consequently, down-regulation of PDI expression by antisense oligonucleotides impaired the spreading of cells and initiated reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Third, because of transfection experiments followed by immunoprecipitation and confocal analysis, we provided evidence that PDI binds to the \u03b2-actin Cys(374) thiol. Formation of the \u03b2-actin-PDI complex was mediated by integrin-dependent signaling in response to the adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix. Our data suggest that PDI is released from subcellular compartments to the cytosol and translocated toward the periphery of the cell, where it forms a disulfide bond with \u03b2-actin when MEG-01 cells adhere via the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin to fibronectin. Thus, PDI appears to regulate cytoskeletal reorganization by the thiol-disulfide exchange in \u03b2-actin via a redox-dependent mechanism.",

    "187": "Multiple cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoforms play divergent roles in cardiac homeostasis but the molecular basis for their non-redundant function remains poorly understood. Here, we report a novel role for the PDE4B isoform in \u03b2-adrenergic (\u03b2AR) signaling in the heart. Genetic ablation of PDE4B disrupted \u03b2AR-induced cAMP transients, as measured by FRET sensors, at the sarcolemma but not in the bulk cytosol of cardiomyocytes. This effect was further restricted to a subsarcolemmal compartment because PDE4B regulates \u03b21AR-, but not \u03b22AR- or PGE2-induced responses. The spatially restricted function of PDE4B was confirmed by its selective effects on PKA-mediated phosphorylation patterns. PDE4B limited the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of key players in excitation-contraction coupling that reside in the sarcolemmal compartment, including L-type Ca(2+) channels and ryanodine receptors, but not phosphorylation of distal cytosolic proteins. \u03b21AR- but not \u03b22AR-ligation induced PKA-dependent activation of PDE4B and interruption of this negative feedback with PKA inhibitors increased sarcolemmal cAMP. Thus, PDE4B mediates a crucial PKA-dependent feedback that controls \u03b21AR-dependent cAMP signals in a restricted subsarcolemmal domain. Disruption of this feedback augments local cAMP/PKA signals, leading to an increased intracellular Ca(2+) level and contraction rate.", 
    "188": "Although intense exercise may induce temporary immune depression, it is unclear whether exercise stimulates tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) production in response to flagella protein flagellin (FG), which binds to toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) and induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Male C3H/HeN mice were administered FG (1mg/kg, i.v.) after exhaustive exercise (EX), and the plasma TNF-\u03b1 concentrations were examined. The production of TNF-\u03b1 and the TLR5 expression in both RAW264 and Caco2 cells were measured under FG conditions in vitro. Although the plasma TNF-\u03b1 concentrations were observed to significantly increase in both the EX and non-EX (N-EX) mice (p<0.01, respectively) following FG injection, the TNF-\u03b1 levels in the EX mice were significantly higher than those observed in the N-EX mice (p<0.01). Epinephrine (Ep) treatment accelerated the FG-induced TNF-\u03b1 production and TLR5 expression on the Caco2, but not RAW264 cells. Interestingly, a high Ep-induced TLR5 expression was observed on the Caco2 cell surface, which was inhibited by an inhibitor of phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3K), Ly294002, as well as a \u03b2-adrenergic blocker, propranolol. In addition, the EX-induced TNF-\u03b1 production observed in response to FG was also attenuated by pretreatment with propranolol. Our findings suggest that exhaustive exercise upregulates the production of TNF-\u03b1 in response to FG via a high expression of TLR5 on the intestinal cell surface following the stimulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors with exercise.",

Hyponatremia in the setting of preeclampsia is an indicator of severity, and requires the understanding of the etiologic mechanisms to initiate an appropriate treatment. Indeed the often-considered fluid restriction is rarely a treatment option for pregnant women. Hypocalcemia is a complication that must be monitored when a treatment with high doses of intravenous magnesium sulphate is introduced. In this context, hypocalcemia must be sought, with the exclusion of other etiologies as vitamin\u00a0D deficiency, hypoparathyroidism or renal and extrarenal loss of calcium. A replacement therapy, intravenous or oral according to circumstances, should be considered in case of severe or symptomatic hypocalcemia.",

    "191": "Myocardial flow reserve, i.e. ratio of stress and rest flow, has been commonly used to detect CAD with many imaging modalities. However, it is not known whether absolute stress flow alone is sufficient for detection of significant CAD.", 
    "192": "We enrolled 104 patients with moderate (30-70%) pre-test likelihood of CAD without previous myocardial infarction. MBF was measured by positron emission tomography and O-15-water at rest and during the adenosine stress in the regions of the left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary artery. All the patients underwent invasive coronary angiography including the measurement of fractional flow reserve when appropriate.", 
    "193": "Quantified myocardial flow reserve (optimal cut-off value 2.5) detected significant coronary stenosis with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 81, 87, 66 and 94%, respectively. When compared with flow reserve, absolute MBF at stress (optimal cut-off value of 2.4 mL/min/g) was more accurate in detecting significant coronary stenosis [area under the curve (AUC) 0.94 vs. 0.90, P = 0.02] with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 95% (P = 0.03 vs. flow reserve), 90, 73, and 98%, respectively. An absolute increase of MBF from rest to stress by <1.5 mL/g/min had also similar accuracy in detecting CAD (AUC: 0.95). The results were comparable in patients who did and did not receive i.v. beta-blockers prior imaging.", 
    "194": "Absolute stress perfusion alone was superior to perfusion reserve in the detection of haemodynamically significant CAD and allows shorter imaging protocols with smaller radiation dose.",

    "197": "This retrospective cohort study examined critically ill adult surgical patients experiencing POAF with rapid ventricular response. Inclusion in the metoprolol or diltiazem treatment group was determined by the initial rate control agent chosen by the prescriber.

Newly diagnosed was defined as having no history of glaucoma diagnosis, antiglaucoma medication use, or glaucoma surgery, including laser treatment, during at least 6 months prior to enrollment. Discontinuation of glaucoma medication was defined as no record of an antiglaucoma medication prescription or monthly claims for medical expenses for 6 months or longer. Patients who met the following criteria were eliminated from the analysis: those who changed insurance systems, those without records in the Japan Health Insurance Society database, or those whose glaucoma diagnosis was retracted.",

Key features include loss of GFR (reaching stage V CKD) during intensified antihypertensive drug therapy including agents that block the renin-angiotensin system and failure to appreciate the extent to which moderate renal artery stenosis was affecting his better kidney. Interpretation of duplex ultrasound studies was complicated by a discrepancy between near-normal peak systolic velocities and markedly abnormal segmental arterial waveforms. It was essential to recognize that both kidneys were abnormal and focus on recovery of perfusion to the better of these kidneys. Successful revascularization of one kidney allowed major improvement in GFR and BP control.",

The proportion of medical records with available information on smoking did not differ between the surveys, whereas the proportion of medical records with available information on blood pressure and total cholesterol was lower in patients hospitalised in 2010-2011. The prescription rate of \u03b2-blockers at discharge decreased from 90% to 84% (p < 0.05), whereas the prescription rates at discharge of other drug classes did not change significantly. The proportion of patients with high blood pressure (\u2265 140/90 mm Hg) one year after hospitalisation decreased in 2011-2012 compared to 2006-2007 (from 48% to 35%, p < 0.05), whereas the proportion of subjects with high LDL cholesterol, high fasting glucose, and obesity did not change significantly.

All these drugs are being currently used in the treatment of Hypertension & various disease conditions of the heart either alone or in combination. Cilnidipine is a new antihypertensive drug distinguished from other L-type Ca(2+) channel blockers or even other antihypertensives, which will be useful for selection of antihypertensive drugs according to the pathophysiological condition of a patient.", 
    "211": "The PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway plays prominent roles in malignant transformation, prevention of apoptosis, drug resistance, and metastasis. One molecule regulated by this pathway is GSK-3\u03b2. GSK-3\u03b2 is phosphorylated by Akt on S9, which leads to its inactivation; however, GSK-3\u03b2 also can regulate the activity of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway by phosphorylating molecules such as PTEN, TSC2, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1. To further elucidate the roles of GSK-3\u03b2 in chemotherapeutic drug and hormonal resistance of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we transfected MCF-7 breast cancer cells with wild-type (WT), kinase-dead (KD), and constitutively activated (A9) forms of GSK-3\u03b2. MCF-7/GSK-3\u03b2(KD) cells were more resistant to doxorubicin and tamoxifen compared with either MCF-7/GSK-3\u03b2(WT) or MCF-7/GSK-3\u03b2(A9) cells. In the presence and absence of doxorubicin, the MCF-7/GSK-3\u03b2(KD) cells formed more colonies in soft agar compared with MCF-7/GSK-3\u03b2(WT) or MCF-7/GSK-3\u03b2(A9) cells. In contrast, MCF-7/GSK-3\u03b2(KD) cells displayed an elevated sensitivity to the mTORC1 blocker rapamycin compared with MCF-7/GSK-3\u03b2(WT) or MCF-7/GSK-3\u03b2(A9) cells, while no differences between the 3 cell types were observed upon treatment with a MEK inhibitor by itself. However, resistance to doxorubicin and tamoxifen were alleviated in MCF-7/GSK-3\u03b2(KD) cells upon co-treatment with an MEK inhibitor, indicating regulation of this resistance by the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Treatment of MCF-7 and MCF-7/GSK-3\u03b2(WT) cells with doxorubicin eliminated the detection of S9-phosphorylated GSK-3\u03b2, while total GSK-3\u03b2 was still detected. In contrast, S9-phosphorylated GSK-3\u03b2 was still detected in MCF-7/GSK-3\u03b2(KD) and MCF-7/GSK-3\u03b2(A9) cells, indicating that one of the effects of doxorubicin on MCF-7 cells was suppression of S9-phosphorylated GSK-3\u03b2, which could result in increased GSK-3\u03b2 activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that introduction of GSK-3\u03b2(KD) into MCF-7 breast cancer cells promotes resistance to doxorubicin and tamoxifen, but sensitizes the cells to mTORC1 blockade by rapamycin. Therefore GSK-3\u03b2 is a key regulatory molecule in sensitivity of breast cancer cells to chemo-, hormonal, and targeted therapy.",

Selective \u03b2-blockers, centrally acting agents, renin-angiotensin system-acting agents, diuretics, and specific medications, methyldopa and atenolol, were not associated with hypospadias. Nonselective \u03b2-blockers (adjusted OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.47-7.05) were associated with hypospadias; however, P values adjusted for multiple testing were not statistically significant. We confirmed prior findings for associations between hypospadias and untreated hypertension (adjusted OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.76-2.48) and late initiation of treatment (adjusted OR 3.98, 95% CI 2.41-6.55). The increased risks would translate to severe hypospadias prevalences of 11.5, 17.7, and 21.9 per 10,000 births for women with untreated hypertension, nonselective \u03b2-blocker use, and late initiation of treatment, respectively.",

    "218": "Sympathetic nervous system has an important role in resistant hypertension. Heart rate (HR) is a marker of sympathetic activity, but its association with resistant hypertension has not been assessed. We aimed to evaluate differences in HR values and variability between resistant and controlled patients and between true and white-coat resistant hypertensives (RHs). We compared office and ambulatory HR, nocturnal dip and s.d. in 14,627 RHs versus 11,951 controlled patients (on \u2a7d 3 drugs) and in 8730 true (24 h blood pressure (BP) \u2a7e 130 and/or 80 mm Hg) versus 4825 white-coat (24-h BP < 130/80 mm Hg) RHs. After adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, diabetes status and beta blocker use, HR values and variability were significantly elevated in resistant versus controlled patients and in true versus white-coat RHs. In logistic regression models, after adjustment for confounders, office HR (odds ratio for each increase in tertile: 1.337; 95% confidence interval: 1.287-1.388; P < 0.001), nocturnal dip (0.958; 0.918-0.999; P = 0.035) and night time s.d. (1.115; 1.057-1.177; P = 0.013) were all significantly associated with the presence of resistant hypertension. Moreover, night time HR (1.160; 1.065-1.265; P < 0.001), nocturnal dip (0.876; 0.830-0.925; P < 0.001) and 24-h s.d. (1.148; 1.092-1.207; P < 0.001) were all significantly associated with true resistant hypertension. In conclusion, both increased HR and variability are associated with resistant hypertension and with true resistance. These suggest the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system in the development of resistance to antihypertensive treatment.",
