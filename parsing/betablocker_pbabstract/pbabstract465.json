Measurements were made using a non-invasive finger device when the subjects were not smoking (1 h, control) and during an hour in which the subjects were asked to smoke four cigarettes, one every 15 min. The first cigarette smoked produced a marked increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressures and the heart rate. The peak blood pressure and heart rate values observed for the first cigarette did not change when the remaining three cigarettes were smoked, indicating that the responses were neither attenuated nor increased by repeated smoking. However, after each cigarette, the pre-smoking values did not return to baseline, but were successively greater for the second, third and fourth cigarettes, indicating that blood pressure and the heart rate undergo a persistent increase during smoking. Compared with the hour-long non-smoking period, mean values over the smoking period were 18.8%, 14.0% and 29.7% higher for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and the heart rate, respectively. Cigarette smoking also increased the blood pressure and heart rate standard deviations around the mean, thereby increasing the variability. The effects of atenolol and doxazosin on the blood pressure and heart rate responses to smoking were investigated in two placebo-controlled, single-blind, randomly allocated, crossover studies. Compared with placebo, atenolol (50-100 mg given once a day for 4 days) significantly attenuated the smoking-induced increase in the heart rate but not the increase in systolic or diastolic blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "The acute effects of selective alpha 1 inhibition with doxazosin (0.5-0.7 mg intravenously) and beta 1-blockade with atenolol (0.1 mg/kg body weight, intravenously) on smoking-induced peripheral vasoconstriction were investigated in 24 hypertensive habitual smokers. Forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography and skin blood flow was estimated by thermography and laser doppler flowmetry. After the patients had smoked two cigarettes, plasma adrenaline elevations were similar under basal conditions and after drug administration; plasma noradrenaline remained unchanged. The smoking-induced increase in the heart rate was attenuated by atenolol compared with basal values. The smoking-induced increase in systolic blood pressure was more marked after atenolol and doxazosin (P less than 0.05) than before the drug administration. The smoking-induced increase in diastolic blood pressure was enhanced by atenolol (P less than 0.05) but unchanged by doxazosin. Smoking increased forearm vascular resistance under basal conditions (P less than 0.05) and after atenolol (P less than 0.01) but not after doxazosin. Similarly, skin temperature was significantly reduced by smoking under basal conditions and after the administration of atenolol (P less than 0.001) but not doxazosin. The smoking-induced reduction in skin blood flow was attenuated by doxazosin compared with atenolol (P less than 0.05). Thus, smoking-induced muscular and cutaneous vasoconstriction was inhibited by doxazosin as opposed to atenolol in hypertensive habitual smokers. This may reflect unmasked beta-adrenoceptor mediated vasodilation in addition to attenuated alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction.", 
    "2": "The distribution of neuropeptide Y in the brain includes extensive coexistence within adrenaline- and noradrenaline-containing neurons and many of its actions are often associated with adrenergic systems. Since neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity is particularly intense in the preoptic area, one of the principal sites for thermoregulation, we have tested the effects of neuropeptide Y on core temperature in normothermic rats, and rats rendered hypothermic by systemic treatment with adrenergic antagonists. In the normothermic rat, intracerebroventricular administration of 1 microgram of neuropeptide Y did not have a significant effect on core temperature. Intraperitoneal treatment with the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, or the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, caused an immediate and significant hypothermia; the intracerebroventricular administration of 1 microgram of neuropeptide Y, 10 minutes after these drugs, strongly potentiated their hypothermic effect. Although intraperitoneal treatment with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan, had no hypothermic effect per se, the intracerebroventricular administration of NPY 10 minutes after this antagonist led to a significant decrease in core temperature.", 
    "3": "1. The effects of tulobuterol (Abbott 54173) on the contractile force developed by electrically stimulated strips of gravid (gestation 36-40 weeks) human uterine muscle were compared with those of isoprenaline and adrenalin. 2. Isoprenaline produced inhibition of electrically evoked contractions of myometrium from 12 of 17 women at concentrations at or below 1 mumol/L (range 0.001-1 mumol/L). It enhanced contractions at concentrations of 10-50 mumol/L. In tissues from the remaining five women isoprenaline produced neither inhibitory nor excitatory effects. Adrenalin (0.1-50 mumol/L) was found to enhance contractile force in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 = 0.30 mumol/L). 3. In the presence of metoprolol (0.3 mumol/L), a selective antagonist at beta 1-adrenoceptors, the isoprenaline concentration-response relationship was shifted to the left, indicating that beta 1-adrenoceptors are present and that they mediate excitation in the human uterus. 4. In contrast tulobuterol (in neither the presence nor absence of metoprolol), in the same concentration range as isoprenaline and adrenalin, (0.001-50 mumol/L) was found to have no effect on the electrically evoked contraction of gravid human uterine muscle strips.", 
    "4": "The alpha, beta-adrenergic blocking, antihypertensive and vasodilating properties of N-1518 were compared with those of labetalol. N-1518 blocked alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors competitively as indicated by parallel rightward displacement of the dose-response curve of each agonist in isolated organs and in anesthetized dogs. As judged by pA2 values and DR10 values, N-1518 was as potent as labetalol in blocking alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. The beta 1/alpha 1 ratio of N-1518 was 8.3 for pA2 values in isolated organs and 13.6 for DR10 values in anesthetized dogs, respectively. N-1518 inhibited dose-dependently the pressor response to intravenous administration of noradrenaline, but labetalol did not depress the response to noradrenaline in anesthetized dogs. N-1518 is composed of four optical isomers. The SR-isomer was the most potent in blocking beta-receptors, and the RR-isomer was the most potent in blocking alpha-receptors. N-1518 has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity in reserpinized rats and has no local anesthetic activity in guinea pigs. Single oral administration of N-1518 produced a fall in blood pressure in conscious SHR and renal hypertensive dogs without causing tachycardia. Intra-arterially administered N-1518 in the dog hindlimb resulted in vasodilation as indicated by the increase in blood flow. The magnitude of the responses was approximately 3 times more potent than that of labetalol.", 
    "5": "Several recent studies have shown that the 5-HT1A agonist indorenate possesses antianxiety properties. In the present study we report on other behavioural actions of this drug. Indorenate (31.6 mg/kg) induced flat body posture, forepaw treading and hind limb abduction, behavioural characteristics of the serotonin syndrome. After indorenate injection these same behaviours were observed in animals pretreated with p-chlorophenylalanine (400 mg/kg X 3 days), suggesting that the action of this compound is not mediated via serotonin release. The beta-5-HT1 blockers, (-) pindolol (2 mg/kg) or (-) alprenolol (5 mg/kg), did not prevent the actions of indorenate on the serotonin syndrome. Indorenate (10 mg/kg) stimulated the masculine sexual behaviour by reducing the number of intromissions preceding ejaculation. Higher doses (17.8 mg/kg) cause a complete inhibition of sexual behaviour. (-) Pindolol (2 mg/kg) or (-) alprenolol (5 mg/kg) did not antagonize the facilitatory actions of indorenate on male sexual behaviour. A high dose of indorenate (31.6 mg/kg) resulted in an impairment of the motor coordination as tested in a treadmill apparatus. These data reveal that indorenate possesses, in addition to its antianxiety effects, other behavioural characteristics that, however, appear at higher dose levels.", 
    "6": "Patient 1 received carteolol and captopril for hypertension. Three days after a slow-release diltiazem preparation (300 mg) had been introduced, he developed cardiogenic shock and sinus bradycardia (heart rate: 30/mn) with acidosis and severe hyperkaliemia. He was successfully treated by temporary pacing and dobutamine. Patient 2 had received sotalol and captopril for several years. Twelve hours after slow release diltiazem had been added, he was found in cardiogenic shock and extreme bradycardia with wide QRS, acidosis and hyperkaliemia. He died one hour later despite intensive emergency treatment. Concomitant use of beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers has been reported in patients suffering of severe coronary heart disease. However, several adverse reactions similar to our cases have been described. Slow-release diltiazem should be avoided in hypertensive patients taking beta-blockers.", 
    "7": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomly allocated study, the 24-h efficacy of a single morning dose of 10 mg of the beta-blocker bisoprolol (n = 17) versus 20 mg of the calcium channel antagonist nitrendipine (n = 19) was assessed using two different methods of blood pressure determination: (1) casual blood pressure determinations in the morning before the dose; and (2) ambulatory day-time (6 a.m. to 6 p.m.) and night-time (6 p.m. to 6 a.m.) blood pressure monitoring using a non-invasive automatic device (Spacelabs 90202). After 4 weeks both agents induced significant blood pressure reductions compared to the placebo period as assessed by both casual and ambulatory day-time readings, without significant differences in the blood pressure reductions induced by the two drugs (P less than 0.05). Ambulatory night-time values, however, showed a significant blood pressure reduction only for bisoprolol (from 138 +/- 16/84 +/- 12 to 129 +/- 15/77 +/- 11 mmHg); nitrendipine did not induce any significant systolic or diastolic blood pressure changes during this period (140 +/- 11/87 +/- 10 to 136 +/- 13/86 +/- 10 mmHg). Individual response rates were 47% for nitrendipine and 71% for bisoprolol. The incidence of side effects was comparable under both drugs. Our results indicate that bisoprolol was more effective over 24 h than nitrendipine. We also conclude that the value of casual blood pressure readings for the evaluation of therapeutic agents given once a day seems to be limited in comparison to 24-h ambulatory monitoring.", 
    "8": "We investigated hemodynamic changes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and valve replacement. The former had been medicated with beta-blocking agent until the morning of operative day. On the other hand, the latter received no medication. We measured systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, and rate pressure product (RPP) at the following five points; before induction of anesthesia, immediately before intubation, immediately after intubation, one minute after skin incision and one minute after sternotomy. In both groups, SAP and DAP decreased significantly after induction; heart rate did not change during our study; and RPP decreased significantly after skin incision. There were no significant differences between the group with beta-blocking agent and the group without it. These results suggest that beta-blocking agents exert no influence in our study, and sufentanil-oxygen anesthesia produce hemodynamic stability for open heart surgery.",

    "10": "Moderate exercise increased platelet aggregability of 12 middle-aged men with stable angina pectoris: the mean ADP threshold fell from 4.58 +/- 0.63 to 3.18 +/- 0.41 microM, P less than 0.01. Exercise did not, however, alter platelet aggregability in 12 healthy matched controls. Physical effort approximately doubled the plasma levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline in patients as well as in controls. Under the same conditions the cAMP content of platelets fell in the angina group from 20.86 +/- 1.86 to 17.78 +/- 1.71 pmol 10(-9) platelets, P less than 0.01, while there was no change in control levels. The fall of cAMP could account for the observed increase in platelet aggregability. We speculate that the increased aggregability of platelets in the exercising anginal subjects represents an imbalance between prostacyclin release and haemodynamic changes. The beta 1-selective blocker metoprolol, in usual therapeutic dosages, prevented the observed platelet changes probably by minimizing the haemodynamic disturbances and stimulating release of prostacyclin.",

The arrhythmogenic efficacy (in %) was: ADR 97; NA 91; PE 90; IP 82; Tb 50; and Sb 0. Propranolol and phentolamine were both effective in reducing the arrhythmogenic effects of ADR and PE.

Similarly, antagonism at both sites is necessary in order to abolish arrhythmias induced by sympathomimetic amines completely.", 
    "16": "Nebivolol is a novel B-1-adrenoceptor-blocking drug with an unusual hemodynamic profile unlike classical B-blockers. In dogs and in healthy volunteers it decreases blood pressure and heart rate but improves left ventricular function. The authors studied 10 male patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure (ejection fraction mean = 46%). A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed into the pulmonary artery, and the mean blood pressure, the heart rate, the pulmonary artery pressure, the pulmonary wedge pressure, the right atrial pressure, the cardiac output, and the stroke volume were measured at rest and on exertion before and after seven days' treatment with oral nebivolol (5 mg/day). While the blood pressure and the heart rate decreased significantly, the pulmonary artery and wedge pressures, as well as the right atrial pressure and the cardiac output, did not change during treatment. The stroke volume increased significantly. The maintained cardiac output cannot be explained by any changes in preload or afterload; instead a positive inotropic mechanism must be assumed. Unlike other B-blockers it seems to be possible to treat patients with heart failure with nebivolol without causing the hemodynamic situation to deteriorate.", 
    "17": "The toxicological evaluation of residues of veterinary drugs in foods of animal origin, which is done within the framework of the Netherlands Veterinary Drugs Act, is based on an EEC guide line in which, in addition to the clinical and analytical criteria, the requirements regarding the pharmacological and toxicological evaluation are laid down. In principle, this evaluation is based on classical toxicological criteria. As veterinary drugs have a specific pharmacological action, it is essential that these pharmacological effects should be in included in the toxicological evaluation in view of an adequate protection of public health. The selected starting point is that a pharmacological effect desired in a target animal is regarded as an undesirable effect in consumers. In this presentation, two examples are referred to, viz. the b\u00e8ta agonist clenbuterol and the b\u00e8ta-blocking agent carazolol; the approach is compared with a 'classical' toxicological evaluation. This shows that the acceptable daily intake in human individuals (ADI), based on pharmacological criteria is lower by a factor of approximately 50 than is the ADI on the basis of 'classical' toxicological criteria. This clearly illustrates the value of this approach in protecting the health of consumers.", 
    "18": "To learn whether patients taking beta-blocker (BB) drugs were at increased risk of having systemic reactions (SRs) from allergen immunotherapy, we prospectively studied 56,105 injection visits in 3178 patients during a 1-year interval. A total of 166 SRs occurred in 144 patients (4.5% of all patients) or 3.0 SRs occurred per 1000 injection visits. Sixty-eight patients were taking BB drugs throughout the year, and only one patient had an SR. By chance, 3.08 patients were expected to have had SRs. We conclude that BB drugs did not increase the frequency of SRs in the patients studied who were receiving immunotherapy (p greater than 0.95). Patients taking BB drugs may still be at increased risk, however, from more severe SRs or their SRs may be more refractory to therapy.", 
    "19": "The present study was designed to elucidate a possible involvement of membrane-stabilizing action of beta blocking agents in posthypoxic recovery of cardiac contractile function and myocardial metabolism. Propranolol and acebutolol, which possess a membrane-stabilizing action, and atenolol and metoprolol, which lack this action, were used in the isolated, perfused rabbit heart. The membrane-stabilizing effects of these agents were assessed on the basis of the effects on the maximal driving frequency of the left atria. Reoxygenation of hearts for 45 min following 20-min hypoxia resulted in little recovery of cardiac contractile force, sustained rise in resting tension, insufficient recovery of myocardial high-energy phosphates, accumulation of the tissue calcium and sodium and marked release of creatine kinase and ATP metabolites from the hearts. Treatment of hypoxic hearts with either 100 microM propranolol, 200 microM acebutolol, 200 microM atenolol or 100 microM metoprolol was commenced when the contractile force declined to 30% of the initial level and terminated at 20-min hypoxia. Treatment with either propranolol or acebutolol produced a significant posthypoxic recovery of cardiac contractile force, resting tension and myocardial high-energy phosphates, and a profound suppression of the tissue calcium and sodium accumulation and the loss of ATP metabolites from perfused hearts. In contrast, neither atenolol nor metoprolol affected these changes induced by the hypoxic insult and the following reoxygenation. The results suggest that membrane-stabilizing action of beta blocking agents plays an important role in the protection against posthypoxic cardiac contractile dysfunction and metabolic disturbances.", 
    "20": "Because of the absence of a generally accepted definition of unstable angina, the clinical context of drug trials for this condition has varied from trial to trial. Early- versus late-entry trials must be distinguished, and the possibility of a modification of effect caused by the nature of drug therapy already given when the patient became unstable or by concomitant treatment in addition to experimental treatment must be taken into account. These factors cannot be overlooked when the results from a limited number of reported trials are pooled together. The largest early-entry trial with a beta-blocker and a calcium antagonist was the Holland Interuniversity Nifedipine/metoprolol Trial (HINT), which enrolled patients with suspected unstable angina diagnosed at coronary care unit admission. HINT results showed that unstable angina cannot be reliably differentiated from evolving myocardial infarction (MI) in this particular context and that there are few early MIs that could have been prevented. In patients who were not already taking a beta-blocker, metoprolol reduced the incidence of acute MI or recurrent ischemia, and there was no benefit of nifedipine. On the other hand, the addition of nifedipine was effective in patients whose conditions became unstable despite maintenance treatment with a beta-blocker. Thus, previous beta-blockade modified the effect of the calcium antagonist studied. Based on evidence from HINT and other trials, it is concluded that beta-blockers should be used as the first-line treatment in patients with unstable angina and that a calcium antagonist should be added when patients remain unstable despite beta-blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "Thirteen patients with chronic stable effort angina underwent continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic and intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring during normal unrestricted daily activity. Each patient underwent two studies, the first while on no treatment and the second while on beta-blocker therapy. During the control period, we recorded 182 episodes of transient ST-segment depression, of which only 30 were associated with angina, and 43 (24%) were apparently caused by increased myocardial oxygen demand. Although the majority of ischemic events (139) were not preceded by an increase in either heart rate or systolic arterial pressure, most occurred during the daytime when the levels of the rate-pressure product were higher. Throughout the day, beta-blockade significantly decreased the levels of heart rate and blood pressure and reduced the number of ischemic attacks by 56%, particularly if such attacks were not caused by increased myocardial demand. The diurnal distribution of ischemic events was not significantly affected by beta-blockade, and again, the majority were observed during the day, in coincidence with high resting levels of rate-pressure product. Whatever the behavior of heart rate and blood pressure before ischemia, ST-segment depression was invariably associated with a parallel increase in these parameters, highly suggestive of cardiac sympathetic nerve activation. We conclude that: 1) The majority of ischemic events that occurred in patients with stable angina during normal daily activity were apparently not precipitated by an excessive increase in myocardial oxygen demand but rather by transient impairment of regional myocardial perfusion. 2) The observation that most ischemic events occur when the levels of sympathetic nerve activity are high suggests that the sympathetic nervous system may play a key pathophysiological role in this syndrome, as cardiac sympathetic nerve activation can both increase metabolic demand and impair myocardial perfusion. 3) beta-Blockers significantly reduced episodes of transient myocardial ischemia in these patients, primarily by reducing cardiac metabolic requirements. The possibility that sympathetically mediated coronary vasoconstriction may also be affected by these drugs needs further investigation.", 
    "22": "High plasma cholesterol concentration is an important coronary heart disease risk factor, particularly in subjects less than 50 years old. Cholesterol is transported mainly by low (LDLs) and high (HDLs) density lipoproteins. High plasma levels of HDL and its apolipoprotein (A-I) are associated with low coronary heart disease risk, and the reverse is true for LDL and its apolipoprotein (B). Plasma levels of very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) are probably not an independent risk factor, and the situation for plasma triglycerides is unclear. beta-Blockers have no significant effects on plasma concentrations of either total or LDL cholesterol, but HDL plasma concentration is reduced by about 10%, particularly by nonselective beta-blockers. Plasma triglyceride and VLDL concentrations are both raised by beta-blockade. Despite these plasma lipid changes, beta-blockers, by decreasing myocardial oxygen requirements, exhibit marked anti-ischemic properties. beta-Blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity effect a 30% decrease in death from myocardial infarction (MI) in the years after an acute MI. Primary prevention of MI by beta-blockade in hypertensive persons has been well debated and probably exists (although to a lesser extent than secondary prevention) in men, particularly for nonsmokers (for nonselective beta-blockers), and despite any plasma lipid changes. beta-Blockade can inhibit the preatheromatous and atheromatous changes induced by catecholamines in the coronary arteries of animals. beta-blockers may also reduce or slow the following processes: 1) endothelial permeability to lipoproteins; 2) acylcholesterol acyltransferase activity within the arterial wall, thereby preventing cholesterol esterification and deposition in foam cells; 3) LDL precipitation with arterial wall proteoglycans; 4) calcium influx into atheromatous areas; 5) preatheromatous increased endothelial turnover; 6) heart rate; 7) blood velocity and flow disturbances; 8) atheromatous plaque rupture and consequent coronary thrombosis; and 9) platelet activity. Thus, beta-blockers may inhibit atheromatous plaque formation and reduce the likelihood of plaque beta-blockers may inhibit atheromatous plaque formation and reduce the likelihood of plaque rupture, clot formation, and coronary thrombosis.", 
    "23": "Acute severe myocardial ischemia and evolving myocardial infarction cause neural stimulation, increased levels of circulating catecholamines, and release of catecholamines from storage depots in the left ventricle, with consequent exposure of injured myocardial cells to relatively high concentrations of catecholamines during the transitional period in which myocyte injury becomes progressively more severe. beta-Adrenergic receptor numbers may be increased in the ischemic myocardium within 15-35 minutes of coronary artery occlusion and are associated with intact or enhanced coupling with the adenylate cyclase enzyme and elevated levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP); their stimulation may mediate ventricular fibrillation. The administration of beta-adrenergic blockers before or within the first few minutes after coronary artery occlusion prevents or attenuates the development of ventricular fibrillation. beta-Receptor numbers are increased in the ischemic myocardium at 60 minutes of coronary artery occlusion but are uncoupled from the adenylate cyclase enzyme at the level of the G protein and/or catalytic unit. However, with reperfusion after 60 minutes of coronary artery occlusion, the increase in ischemic-region beta-adrenergic receptor numbers persists, and adenylate cyclase responsiveness to beta-receptor stimulation is restored. If a catecholamine is administered, increases in cyclic AMP and activated phosphorylase occur in ischemic-reperfused myocardium. These data indicate that beta-adrenergic mechanisms may play an important role in arrhythmogenesis and may contribute to myocyte injury during severe and intense myocardial ischemia and evolving myocardial infarction.", 
    "24": "In recent years, several large randomized trials have clarified the role of various interventions in acute myocardial infarction. There is clear evidence that thrombolytic therapy, aspirin, and beta-blockers reduce mortality. Both aspirin and beta-blockers also reduce reinfarction and stroke. Of the thrombolytic agents, comparative trials have established that tissue plasminogen activator and streptokinase have similar effects on mortality, morbidity, and left ventricular function. There appears to be an increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage with tissue plasminogen activator. The benefits of heparin in conjunction with aspirin and a thrombolytic agent are unclear and, at best, are likely to be modest. Heparin increases the risk of hemorrhagic complications twofold. Although trials of vasodilators conducted before the widespread use of thrombolytic therapy and aspirin have been promising, newer trials are needed to evaluate their effects among patients receiving these agents. The aggregate of all trials of the routine use of calcium antagonists or antiarrhythmic agents indicates that these agents do not improve survival.", 
    "25": "Because beta-adrenergic blockade has as one of its many effects altered electrophysiological abnormalities after dogs with left ventricular hypertrophy have been subjected to coronary occlusion, we tested the hypothesis that metoprolol (200-400 mg/day) would reduce mortality rates in dogs with one-kidney, one clip left ventricular hypertrophy while a similar reduction in arterial pressure with enalapril (20-40 mg/day) would not. Dogs with left ventricular hypertrophy were given metoprolol or enalapril for 5-7 days before a 3-hour coronary occlusion. Infarct size and risk area were measured with triphenyltetrazolium chloride stain and barium angiography, respectively. For control (n = 15), left ventricular hypertrophy (n = 17), left ventricular hypertrophy plus metoprolol (n = 12), and left ventricular hypertrophy plus enalapril (n = 15) groups, mean arterial pressure, ratio of infarct size to risk area, and dogs experiencing sudden death were 110 +/- 4, 142 +/- 4, 121 +/- 7, and 120 +/- 3 mm Hg; 44 +/- 5%, 65 +/- 5%, 44 +/- 7%, and 30 +/- 4%; and 27%, 65%, 17%, and 53%, respectively. Thus, the excessive increase in early mortality occurring when dogs with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy undergo coronary occlusion is interrupted with beta-blockade, possibly via electrophysiological effects rather than by changes in arterial pressure or infarct size.", 
    "26": "Supraventricular tachydysrhythmias are a commonly encountered clinical problem after cardiothoracic surgery. Current choices for acute drug therapy of these dysrhythmias include intravenous verapamil as well as esmolol, but no data yet exist comparing the relative negative dromotropic (atrioventricular [A-V] nodal blocking) and negative inotropic effects of these agents. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of esmolol with those of verapamil on systemic hemodynamics, coronary blood flow, and cardiac contractility at doses that produce a similar ventricular response rate in an animal model of a supraventricular tachydysrhythmia. Rapid electrical stimulation (800 impulses/min) of the left atrium in 14 dogs resulted in a rapid and irregularly irregular ventricular rhythm. Esmolol or verapamil were administered by bolus and then infusion to incrementally slow the average ventricular rate. Regional myocardial contractility was measured using the end-systolic pressure-length relationship (Ees). At drug doses that produced similar decreases in ventricular rate, esmolol produced a greater decrease in contractility (Ees: 284 +/- 46 to 40 +/- 22 mmHg/mm, LV dp/dt: 2,400 +/- 450 to 1,360 +/- 450 mmHg/sec) compared with that following verapamil (Ees: 297 +/- 57 to 116 +/- 25 mmHg/mm, LV dp/dt: 2,040 +/- 580 to 1,950 +/- 520 mmHg/sec). This was accompanied by a modest decrease in cardiac output in the esmolol group (2,800 +/- 940 to 2,290 +/- 730 ml/min) compared with an unchanged cardiac output as ventricular rate slowed in verapamil-treated animals. Stroke volume increased significantly in the verapamil-treated animals (10.9 +/- 4.0 to 18.5 +/- 4.6 ml), but remained unchanged following esmolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "The authors studied the optimal epinephrine content of an epidural test dose, and determined criteria to identify intravascular injections in subjects with or without beta-adrenergic blockade. Nine healthy nonpregnant subjects 25-36 years of age were given intravenous infusions of saline or esmolol in random order. During each infusion, they received a series of five injections (3 ml each) of either saline, 1% lidocaine or 1% lidocaine containing 5, 10, or 15 micrograms of epinephrine. Thirty minutes after completing these two infusions, propranolol was administered as a bolus injection, and the series of five injections repeated. All injections were double blind and randomized. During saline infusion, all injections containing epinephrine significantly increased heart rate (HR) by an average of 31-38 beats/min when compared with that following plain lidocaine (P less than 0.05), and increased systolic blood pressure by an average of 17-26 mmHg (P less than 0.05 for the 15-micrograms dose only). During esmolol infusion, epinephrine injections increased HR by an average of 23-31 beats/min (P less than 0.05), and increased systolic blood pressure by an average of 18-30 mmHg (P less than 0.05 for 10 and 15 micrograms). After propranolol injection, epinephrine injections caused a decrease in HR by an average of 21-28 beats/min (P less than 0.05), whereas systolic blood pressure increased by an average of 22-35 mmHg (P less than 0.05 for 10 and 15 micrograms only). Without beta-adrenergic blockade, an increase in HR greater than or equal to 20 beats/min was 100% sensitive and specific for intravascular injection of 10 or 15 micrograms of epinephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "The sympathetic hyperactivity of congestive heart failure (CHF) may worsen cardiovascular function by down-regulation of myocardial beta-receptors. For this reason, beta blockade is proposed to be useful in CHF. Bucindolol is a new beta blocker that has intrinsic nonadrenergically-mediated vasodilation and may be valuable in treatment of CHF. To test this, 19 patients with CHF were randomized in a double-blind protocol to 3 months of treatment with bucindolol (n = 12) or placebo (n = 7). Significant improvement was seen in the bucindolol group using invasive and noninvasive tests; treadmill time increased from 445 to 530 seconds (p = 0.04), Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire score improved from 61 to 40 (p = 0.0001), cardiac output increased from 4.0 to 4.7 (p = 0.02), and systemic vascular resistance decreased from 1,888 to 1,481 (p = 0.04). Also, peak exercise heart rate and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased significantly with treatment. There were no changes in the placebo group. We conclude that bucindolol may be an effective treatment for CHF when administered chronically and that its nonadrenergic vasodilation may be an important feature.", 
    "29": "The binding properties of an hydrophilic beta-adrenergic receptor radioligand, (-)[3H](4-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-benzimidazolo-2-one ); ([3H]CGP-12177), were investigated in rat skeletal muscle cells in culture. The binding of [3H]CGP-12177 at 25 degrees was saturable, reversible and of high affinity (Kd = 1.3 +/- 0.3 nM). The maximal number of [3H]CGP-12177 binding sites was 30.6 +/- 3.2 fmol/dish (34 +/- 3.5 fmol/mg protein). beta-Adrenergic agonists and antagonists inhibited [3H]CGP-12177 binding. The competing ligand inhibition binding is a typical one for beta 2-adrenoceptors. The increase in beta-adrenoceptors was independent of cell fusion. Amiodarone (10(-5) M) decreased the beta-adrenoceptor number in skeletal muscle cells differentiated in vitro by 48%, while the affinity for [3H]CGP-12177 was not affected.", 
    "30": "In myocardial ischemia beta-blockers reduce myocardial oxygen demand, improve flow toward ischemic regions, and have mild antiplatelet and antiarrhythmic effects. These agents are effective in chronic stable angina and unstable angina. In chronic myocardial ischemia, the beta-blockers timolol, metoprolol, atenolol, and propranolol have cardioprotective effects, reducing overall mortality and the incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction. Calcium channel blockers, which reduce myocardial oxygen demand and improve oxygen supply, are effective in the treatment of chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina, and unstable angina. Although calcium channel blockers generally have no effect or adverse effects when used as primary therapy for acute myocardial infarction, diltiazem (when used concomitantly with nitrates or beta-blockers) has been shown to reduce the incidence of reinfarction in patients after non-Q wave myocardial infarction.", 
    "31": "Circadian rhythms have long been recognized to occur in many biologic phenomena, including secretion of hormones and activities of the autonomic nervous system. More recently, circadian rhythms have also been noted to occur in the incidences of certain cardiac and cerebrovascular events, including transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, and stroke. The pathophysiology and the mechanisms underlying these variations are the focus of much investigation. The effects of different drug treatments on these circadian rhythms are also being studied. This information should enable better treatment strategies to be planned for patients who have either silent or symptomatic episodes of transient myocardial ischemia and potentially to prevent the occurrence of sudden, catastrophic cardiac events.", 
    "32": "Peak aortic blood flow acceleration and velocity measured by Doppler echocardiography have been documented to be accurate descriptors of left ventricular systolic function. Both acceleration and velocity are reduced in the presence of beta-blockade at rest and during exercise. Whether and to what extent the simultaneous alterations in heart rate (HR) due to beta-blockade affect these parameters has received little study. In order to determine the influence of alterations in HR on Doppler measurements of velocity and acceleration, 10 healthy men were studied during upright exercise under control conditions, following propranolol administration, and following propranolol plus transesophageal atrial pacing. In addition, we assessed the response of stroke volume (measured as flow velocity integral) during beta-blocked and control exercise. Propranolol significantly reduced acceleration and velocity during all stages of exercise compared with control values (p less than 0.05). Increasing the HR during exercise via pacing had no effect on acceleration or velocity compared with propranolol administration alone, thus demonstrating that during upright exercise, changes in acceleration and velocity are independent of alterations in HR. At low levels of exercise, propranolol significantly reduced flow velocity integral (FVI) compared with control (-1.14 cm, p less than 0.05.). At high levels of exertion, however, FVI exceeded values obtained during control conditions (1.2 cm at stage 4). Pacing during beta-blockade reduced FVI at high levels of exercise but had no effect at lower levels. Our results suggest that during low levels of exercise stroke volume is increased as a consequence of both increased contractility and augmented left ventricular filling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "The relation of treatment adherence to mortality after a myocardial infarction was investigated among 2175 participants in the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial, which had data for measures of treatment adherence, clinical severity, and the psychological and social features that may influence post-infarction mortality. Overall, patients who did not adhere well to treatment regimen (ie, who took less than or equal to 75% of prescribed medication) were 2.6 times more likely than good adherers to die within a year of follow-up (95% confidence interval, 1.2, 5.6). Poor adherers had an increased risk of death whether they were on propranolol (OR = 3.1) or placebo (OR = 2.5). Furthermore, this increased risk of death for poor adherers was not accounted for by measures of the severity of myocardial infarction, sociodemographic features (eg, race, marital status, education), smoking, or psychological characteristics (high life-stress or social isolation).", 
    "34": "Twenty-three children and young persons with a congenital long QT syndrome were identified; the median age at the time of referral was 10 years (range 4 days to 19 years) and 14 patients (61%) had a family history of the syndrome. Among the 19 patients with symptoms, the initial symptom was syncope in 13 (69%), aborted sudden death in 5 (26%) and near drowning in 1 (5%). There were three deaths during a combined follow-up period of 67 patient-years (average annual mortality rate 4.5%). Patients who did not respond to therapy with a beta-adrenergic blocker and those who died were significantly younger than the remaining patients at the time of diagnosis (p less than or equal to 0.05 for both). Analysis of 44 treadmill exercise tests performed by 16 patients revealed significant prolongation of the median corrected QT (QTc) interval in response to exercise, with maximal prolongation present after 2 min of recovery (median QTc interval 0.52 s versus a baseline value of 0.47 s, p less than 0.001). Characteristic changes in T wave configuration were noted in 8 of 15 patients on at least one occasion during ambulatory Holter electrocardiographic monitoring, including T wave alternation in two patients, both of whom died shortly afterward. It is suggested that the congenital long QT syndrome is associated with a significant mortality rate in childhood despite the use of conventional therapy in symptomatic patients. Ambulatory Holter monitoring and treadmill exercise testing may be helpful, both in confirming the diagnosis of a long QT syndrome and in monitoring the adequacy of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "The impact of photoperiodic manipulations and testosterone treatments on the adipocyte alpha 2-adrenergic (alpha 2-AR), beta-adrenergic (beta-AR), and A1-adenosine (A1-R) responsiveness, was explored in male Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Moreover, binding studies were performed with appropriate alpha 2-AR, beta-AR, and A1-R radioligands to study receptor changes. Animals were kept for 12 weeks in long day photoperiod (LD: 16 h light (L)-8 h dark (D)), in short day photoperiod (SD: 6L-18D), or in short photoperiod with testosterone treatments (1 mg/animal/day sc) 10 days before sacrifice (SD+T). The antilipolytic effect of the full alpha 2-AR agonist UK14304 and the specific binding of the alpha 2-AR radioligands [3H] RX821002 (antagonist) and [3H]UK14304 were significantly reduced in SD hamsters compared with LD hamsters. The alpha 2-site number and alpha 2-AR responsiveness were completely restored in SD+T hamsters. Whatever the experimental conditions the adipocyte beta-AR receptivity (lipolytic response of isoproterenol and [125I]cyanopindolol binding), and the A1-R receptivity (antilipolytic response initiated by (-)phenylisopropyladenosine and [3H]dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine and [3H]phenylisopropyladenosine binding) remained unchanged. Moreover, the kidney and brain alpha 2-AR densities identified with [3H]RX821002 were not significantly different in LD, SD or SD+T hamsters. These results were obtained without any modification of animal weight, white adipose tissue weight, or white fat cell size. We conclude that, in the Syrian hamster, the expression of the adipocyte alpha 2-AR is under the control of the photoperiod by a testosterone-dependent mechanism probably mediated through the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, without any alteration of the animal fat stores.", 
    "36": "The effect of baclofen, a GABAB-agonist, was studied on both forced swimming-induced immobility and isoprenaline-induced enhancement of forced swimming-induced immobility in mice. (+/-) Baclofen (0.5 and 1 mg/kg), and (-) baclofen (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg) attenuated forced swimming-induced immobility. The effect of baclofen was not reversed by bicuculline, a GABAA-antagonist. Baclofen also reduced isoprenaline-induced enhancement of forced swimming-induced immobility. On concomitant administration of a subeffective dose of baclofen with a subeffective dose of propranolol, desipramine and amitriptyline, a potentiating effect was observed. These results are corroborative of our previous finding that GABAergic agents, particularly GABAB-receptors, play a role in the modulation of despair behavior in mice and in the action of antidepressant drugs. Baclofen (5 mg/kg) did not produce any significant effect on forced swimming-induced immobility, but reduced significantly the locomotor activity of the animals. Lower doses (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) of baclofen, which reduced the forced swimming-induced immobility, did not affect the locomotor activity. At higher and lower tissue concentrations of the drug, involvement of different receptor populations is suggested.", 
    "37": "Amphetamine-induced stereotyped behaviour of rats is a nonsteady oscillatory process. After combination of acute amphetamine and beta-adrenoblocker propranolol a lowering of amplitude and limitation of rhythmicity of stereotype were observed. But chronic propranolol intensified the stereotypy without usual increase of the number of short-period (2-3/min) fluctuations in the time course of the process. It is suggested that potentiation of behavioural disturbances by propranolol may be the result of blockade of pineal beta-adrenergic receptors and weakening of brain adaptive mechanisms function.", 
    "38": "Adrenergic response to noradrenaline and specific agonists of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors phenylephrine and isopropylnoradrenaline, as well as the effect of the alpha-adrenoceptors blockers on the functional state of beta-adrenoceptors and vice versa, were studied in the rat isolated portal vein. Functional interaction between alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors was manifested in a change of alpha-receptors when beta-receptors were blocked, and a change of reaction of beta-receptors when the alpha ones were blocked. The blockade of specific receptors seems to evoke conformational changes of cell membrane, thus modulating the affinity to the agonist of the receptors of the other type.", 
    "39": "The study was undertaken to examine 20 healthy subjects and 20 patients with Stages I and II hypertensive disease (all being males) under psycho-emotional stress (PES). In terms of relationships between blood pressure values, heart rate, and serum myoglobin (Mb) levels, it was concluded that PES caused various degrees of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoreceptor activation. Exposing the same patients treated with obsidan to PES revealed more pronounced values and responsiveness of diastolic pressure in a subgroup of patients showing simultaneously a dramatic decrease in Mb levels, which is indicative of alpha-adrenoreceptor activation after beta 2-receptor blockade. It was proposed to apply an index of decreased Mb levels during obsidan therapy as a measure of beta 2-adrenoreceptor blockade.", 
    "40": "Through this study we proved that the inhibitory effect ketotifen has on antigen-specific histamine release (ASHR) does not have any relation with beta-adrenergic system stimulation. However, it increases the inhibitory effect of histamine release caused by isoproterenol. Therefore, although ketotifen does not directly stimulate beta-adrenergic receptors to inhibit mediator secretion, its action correlates with the response produced through the stimulation of these receptors.", 
    "41": "Norepinephrine (NE) and phenylephrine (Phe) were employed to study the ionic requirements for alpha adrenoceptor activation in the teleost Poecilia reticulata melanophores. As expected the beta adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol, increased the sensitivity of the preparation to NE (5.8 times), and was therefore employed in all the experimental procedures. Neither cocaine (a neuronal uptake blocker) nor dexamethasone (an extraneuronal uptake blocker) enhanced the sensitivity of the preparation to NE, suggesting that these inactivating mechanisms would not play a role in P. reticulata pigmentary system. However, in the absence of calcium, the dose-response curve (DRC) to NE was displaced to the left about 3.5 times, whereas the DRC to Phe was not affected. These results indicate that a neuronal uptake is active, but was not demonstrated by the classical pharmacological tools, probably due to an assymmetric display of the nervous endings. The DRC to NE was rightward displaced (14.1 times) in the presence of the calcium channel blocker Verapamil, whereas the DRC to Phe was not affected. These data suggest that P. reticulata melanophores possess a mixed population of alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenoceptors, the activation of the latter eliciting an extracellular calcium influx. In sodium-free saline, the DRC to NE was rightward shifted (6.6 times) and the response to Phe was impaired in such a way that the maximal response was not achieved. The DRC to both NE and Phe were rightward displaced (7.9 and 2.7 times respectively) in the presence of the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) 10(-7)M.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "43": "1. Forskolin, a naturally occurring diterpene that activates adenylate cyclase, HL706, a water-soluble derivative of forskolin (6 beta-[(piperidino)acetoxy]-7-desacetylforskolin) that is less potent than forskolin in activating adenylate cyclase, and 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, an analogue that does not activate adenylate cyclase, were examined for effects on the nicotinic receptor-mediated 22Na+ flux, a high potassium-induced 45Ca2+ flux through L-type calcium channels, and a high potassium-induced 86Rb+ efflux through a calcium-dependent potassium channels in PC12 cells. 2. Forskolin and analogues at 30 microM completely blocked carbamylcholine-elicited flux of 22Na+ through the nicotinic receptor-gated channel. 1,9-Dideoxyforskolin had an IC50 value of 1.6 microM with forskolin and HL706 being two- to three fold less potent. 3. Forskolin and its analogues appear to be noncompetitive blockers of the neuronal nicotinic receptor-channel complex in PC12 cells, but unlike many noncompetitive blockers, did not markedly enhance desensitization. Instead, forskolin, but not HL706 or 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, slightly antagonized the desensitization evoked by high concentrations of carbamylcholine. N-Ethylcarboxamidoadenosine, an adenosine analogue that elevates cyclic AMP and 8-bromo-cyclic AMP had no effect on desensitization. 4. Forskolin, HL706, and 1,9-dideoxyforskolin in the presence of carbamylcholine inhibited the binding of a noncompetitive blocker, [3H]perhydrohistrionicotoxin, to the muscle-type nicotinic receptor-channel complex in Torpedo electroplax membranes with IC50 values of 20 microM. Forskolin had no effect on [3H]perhydrohistrionicotoxin binding in the absence of carbamylcholine, while HL706 and 1,9-dideoxyforskolin still inhibited binding in the absence of carbamylcholine. 5. Forskolin, but not HL706 or 1,9-dideoxyforskolin had a slight inhibitory effect on the binding of [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin to acetylcholine recognition sites in Torpedo membranes. 1,9-Dideoxyforskolin at 30 microM, but not forskolin or HL706, markedly inhibited depolarization-evoked 45Ca+ flux and 86Rb+ efflux in PC12 cells, suggesting that 1,9-dideoxyforskolin has nonspecific inhibitory effects on a variety of ion channels.", 
    "44": "The electromechanical effects of UK-68,798 (UK), a novel class III antiarrhythmic drug, were studied in guinea pig and rat papillary muscles (PMs) and atria in vitro using conventional microelectrode technique. UK (10(-8)-10(-6) M) prolonged the action potential duration (APD) by 21-58% and effective refractory period in parallel, without affecting the resting potential or maximum rate of depolarization in guinea pig PM stimulated at 1 Hz. UK increased the contractile force without prolonging the time to peak force or relaxation. In comparison, 5 x 10(-5) M d-sotalol was needed to induce the same electrophysiological effects as 10(-8) M UK. UK prolonged the APD significantly less at 2 Hz than at 1 and 0.5 Hz. Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) developed in 2 of 11 preparations after 10(-6) M at 0.5 Hz. No reversal of drug effect was seen after up to 2 h washout. UK (10(-9)-10(-5) M) reduced the spontaneous heart rate and prolonged the sinus node recovery time of guinea pig right atria. No effects on rat PM or atria, even after 10(-5) M, indicate a selective action of UK on the delayed rectifying outward potassium current, Ik. These results indicate a potent and selective, rate-dependent class III antiarrhythmic action of UK-68,798 linked with positive inotropy. Increased APD, bradycardia, and induction of EADs, however, represent a potential arrhythmogenic combination.", 
    "45": "MDL 11,939 (alpha-phenyl-1-[2-phenylethyl]-4-piperidine-methanol) is a new class III antiarrhythmic agent that was evaluated for antiarrhythmic activity in anesthetized dogs. Intravenous (i.v.) administration of MDL 11,939 (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) increased left ventricular effective refractory periods. Q-T interval, and Q-Tc in a dose-related way. The effects of MDL 11,939 on ventricular refractoriness were similar to those observed with administration of identical doses of d-sotalol, with the exception that those produced by MDL 11,939 lasted longer. Intraduodenal administration of 10 mg/kg MDL 11,939 also increased left ventricular effective refractory period (LV ERP). The increase in left ventricular refractoriness produced by MDL 11,939 occurred without a significant increase in QRS duration. MDL 11,939 (10 mg/kg i.v.) also protected against induction of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) induced with programmed electrical stimulation (PES) in anesthetized dogs with chronic 4- to 7-day myocardial infarctions. In comparison, antiarrhythmic effects of bretylium (10 mg/kg i.v.) against PES-induced ventricular arrhythmias were dependent on additional administration of propranolol (0.1 mg/kg i.v.), whereas propranolol alone (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) was ineffective. The results observed with MDL 11,939 are consistent with its in vitro class III antiarrhythmic action and suggest utility for this agent in treatment of VT and VF.", 
    "46": "The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist pindolol [10-1,000 micrograms/kg subcutaneously (s.c.)] caused dose-related decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and increased heart rate (HR) in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The lowest dose of pindolol (10 micrograms/kg) decreased MAP by 25 mm Hg (-16%) without affecting plasma norepinephrine (NE) or plasma renin concentration (PRC). However, higher doses of pindolol elicited dose-related increases in plasma NE concentration and PRC. Plasma epinephrine concentration was not altered by pindolol. The selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (3 mg/kg, s.c.) prevented the tachycardia but not the increase in PRC caused by 100 micrograms/kg pindolol. Treatment with ICI 118,551 completely eliminated the 45% increase in plasma NE elicited by 100 micrograms/kg of pindolol even though the decrease in MAP caused by this dose of pindolol was the same in the presence (-33 mm Hg) and absence (-34 mm Hg) of beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade. These results indicate that the vasodepressor action of pindolol in SHR does not result from an agonistic effect at postjunctional beta 2-adrenoceptors in the vasculature. In addition, the increases in plasma NE concentration produced by pindolol result from stimulation of beta 2-adrenoceptors. These beta 2-adrenoceptors may be located prejunctionally on sympathetic neurons.", 
    "47": "To characterize the beta-adrenergic receptors on guinea pig gastric smooth muscle cells, we examined the effects of beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists on biological activity, cellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), and radioligand binding. Adrenergic agonists, isoproterenol (ISO), epinephrine (EPI), and norepinephrine (NE), inhibited carbachol-stimulated contraction of muscle cells, with relative potencies (IC50S) of ISO (0.1 microM) greater than EPI (1.4 microM) greater than NE (11 microM). Each agonist increased cellular cAMP, with relative potencies (IC50S) of ISO (0.5 microM) greater than EPI (6.3 microM) greater than NE (56 microM). Binding of the nonselective beta-antagonist 125I-pindolol was temperature-dependent, saturable, reversible, and specific. 125I-pindolol binding was inhibited by the three agonists, with relative potencies (IC50S) of ISO (0.9 microM) greater than EPI (9.6 microM) greater than NE (112 microM). Pindolol inhibited binding of 125I-pindolol with an IC50 of 100 nM. The IC50 for inhibition of binding of 125I-pindolol by the relatively beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 was 70 nM and for the relatively beta 1-selective antagonist betaxolol was 1,000 nM. Computer analysis of the dose-inhibition curves for binding of 125I-pindolol for the antagonists indicated that gastric smooth muscle cells possess exclusively beta 2-adrenergic receptors of two classes, one class with a high affinity for ICI 118,551 (Kd = 50 nM) and the other with a low affinity for ICI 118,551 (Kd = 30 microM). Our results indicate that beta-adrenergic agonists interact with beta 2-adrenergic receptors on gastric smooth muscle cells to increase cellular cAMP and inhibit muscle contraction.", 
    "48": "Previous determinations of variability in frequency of ventricular arrhythmias have been based on repeated recordings obtained in the absence of therapy. We evaluate variability during \"effective\" treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs. Variability in the percent suppression of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) was determined in 55 patients with chronic arrhythmias who underwent multiple ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings during evaluation of chronic therapy with antiarrhythmic drugs initially determined to be effective, which was defined as 70% or more reduction in total PVC frequency or 90% or more reduction in repetitive forms. During chronic therapy, total PVCs were suppressed by 92%, averaged after a logarithmic transformation step, and repetitive beats were suppressed by 88%. Variability in suppression was substantial. The one-sided 95% confidence intervals required a fall in suppression of total PVCs to 40% or less to exceed limits of spontaneous variability and of repetitive PVCs to 66% or less. Suppression declined at least once during therapy to less than 60% for total PVCs in 24 of 55 patients (44%) and to less than 80% for repetitive PVCs in 13 of 33 patients (39%); nine patients (16%) showed increases in PVC frequency at least once to levels above pretreatment baseline. Seven subgroups were analyzed for their effects on variability and loss of suppression: age, gender, disease etiology, cardiac function, baseline PVC frequency, use of beta-blockers, and class of antiarrhythmic drug. Differences in confidence bounds and loss of suppression were found to be determined in a complex way by subgroup differences in variability and in initial levels of PVC suppression. Variability was greater for patient subgroups with greater PVC frequency, beta-blocker therapy, and non-coronary artery disease. However, clinical loss of suppression was more common only in more elderly patients and those with worse cardiac function. In summary, substantial variability in arrhythmia frequency occurs during effective antiarrhythmic therapy, and the 95% confidence limits of spontaneous variability are broad and determined in a complex way. Careful consideration should be given before concluding on the basis of a single Holter test that changes (increases) in arrhythmia frequency, especially in certain subgroups, are caused by treatment failure.", 
    "49": "Magnesium is abundant in the mammalian body and the second most abundant cation in cells. Because the concentration of intracellular free Mg2+ is relatively high (0.2-1 mM), Mg2+ is unlikely to act as a second messenger, like Ca2+, by rapidly changing its cytosolic concentration. But changes in Mg2+ do have profound effects on cellular metabolism, structure and bioenergetics. Key enzymes or metabolic pathways, mitochondrial ion transport, Ca2+ channel activities in the plasma membrane and intracellular organelles, ATP-requiring reactions, and structural properties of cells and nucleic acids are modified by changes in Mg2+ concentration. Yet, although some information is available from giant cells and bacteria, little is known about the regulation of intracellular Mg2+ in mammalian cells. Here we report a new transport mechanism for Mg2+ across the sarcolemma of cardiac cells in both intact hearts and dissociated myocytes. We show that noradrenaline, through beta-adrenergic stimulation and increase of cyclic AMP, stimulates a large efflux of Mg2+ from cardiac cells. This transport is of major dimensions and can move up to 20% of total cellular Mg2+ within a few minutes.",

The relaxation induced by diazepam was not counteracted by the central antagonist Ro 15-1788 (10 microM), and the relaxant effects of Ro 5-4864 and of diazepam were not prevented by either the GABAA antagonist bicuculline (10 microM) or the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (1 microM). The mechanism underlying the relaxant effects of benzodiazepines on K(+)-contracted uterine rings is still under study.", 
    "51": "For decades, atrial fibrillation was treated exclusively with digoxin. The introduction of Ca-antagonists and beta-blockers has, however, produced valuable alternatives as ventricular function can now be controlled both at rest and during exercise whereas, with digoxin, ventricular function could only be controlled at rest. This review deals with the etiology and electrophysiology of atrial fibrillation together with the effects of Ca-antagonists and beta-blockers on conduction and control of the heart rate during exercise. Documentation of the effects of the different drugs, separately and combined, in the treatment of atrial fibrillation during rest and exercise is presented. It is concluded that alteration in the therapeutic strategy appears reasonable in favour of a combination of digoxin and also Ca-antagonists/beta-blocker.", 
    "52": "The relationship between Na/K/2Cl cotransport activation in duck erythrocytes and binding of the diuretic [3H]bumetanide to isolated membranes from stimulated cells has been assessed. Cotransport was activated by either cAMP-dependent (norepinephrine) or -independent (fluoride, hypertonicity) pathways. Membranes isolated from unstimulated cells possessed no specific bumetanide binding. In the presence of norepinephrine, cotransport and saturable binding rose in parallel, reaching a maximum after 5-7 min. In membranes from maximally stimulated cells the K1/2 and Bmax for bumetanide binding were 100 nM and 1.7 pmol/mg protein, respectively. The diuretic binding properties of these membranes were characteristic of interactions of ligands with the Na/K/2Cl cotransporter: specific binding required the presence of all three cotransported ions (Na, K, and Cl), and the rank order of potency for diuretic competition with bumetanide for binding sites was benzmetanide greater than bumetanide greater than furosemide. The appearance of specific bumetanide binding was also seen in membranes from erythrocytes activated by non-cAMP-dependent stimuli, with an excellent temporal correlation between cotransport activation and diuretic binding. On removal of all stimuli both cotransport and bumetanide binding declined in parallel. Duck erythrocytes treated with norepinephrine in a solution containing 15 mM K+ swell to a new stable cell volume after 60 min, during which time cotransport becomes inoperative. Bumetanide binding to both whole cells and isolated membranes paralleled the decline in cotransport activity. It is concluded that bumetanide binding to isolated membranes faithfully reflects the state of activation of the Na/K/2Cl cotransporter in intact cells under a variety of conditions.", 
    "53": "Metoprolol is a lipophilic, cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent commercially available as a racemic compound. A normal phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed to directly determine individual enantiomeric concentrations of metoprolol in human serum. Separation of the enantiomers was accomplished by a cellulose-tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) chiral stationary phase. Metoprolol enantiomers were detected by means of fluorescence with excitation and emission wavelengths of 275 and 315 nm, respectively. Standard curves were linear over the concentration range 12.5-400 ng/ml for each enantiomer. Within-day coefficient of variation was less than 15% at all concentrations and the between-day coefficient of variation ranged from 4.1 to 11.2%. The limit of detection was determined to be 5 ng/ml for each enantiomer and the stereoselective resolution (alpha) of R- and S-metoprolol was 3.08. The assay was employed to determine enantiomeric serum concentrations of metoprolol in healthy male volunteers.", 
    "54": "The effects of endothelin-1 (human, porcine) on contractions induced by transmural nerve stimulation, exogenous ATP or noradrenaline, and on the release of [3H]noradrenaline were studied in guinea pig and rat vas deferens. Endothelin enhanced nerve-induced contractile responses, increased basal muscle tone and increased the contractile response to exogenous ATP in both guinea pig and rat vas deferens. Endothelin did not affect the contractile responses to exogenous noradrenaline. The calcium channel blocker felodipine antagonized the stimulating effects of endothelin in the rat vas deferens, whereas blockade of lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways by a combination of BW 755C and indomethacin was without effect. In rat vas deferens preparations preincubated with [3H]noradrenaline, endothelin inhibited the 3H overflow induced by transmural stimulation, although the contractile responses were enhanced by endothelin. Pretreatment with forskolin or felodipine did not abolish the endothelin inhibition of radiotracer overflow. In conclusion, endothelin can modulate adrenergic and purinergic neuroeffector transmission in both guinea pig and rat vas deferens via inhibitory prejunctional and stimulant postjunctional mechanisms. The stimulant postjunctional effect seemed to predominate in our experiments.", 
    "55": "The addition of norepinephrine to perfused rat livers and to collagenase isolated hepatocytes induced a marked and dose-dependent magnesium efflux. The addition of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, but not alpha-antagonists, completely blocked the Mg2+ efflux. The Mg2+ efflux could also be induced by forskolin and by permeable cAMP analogues. By contrast, the addition of carbachol or vasopressin induced a Mg2+ influx into isolated hepatocytes. These results indicate that a significant Mg2+ efflux from liver cells can be induced through the beta-adrenergic receptors and that it is mediated through the cytosolic cAMP levels.", 
    "56": "In a prospective study the authors investigated 30 pregnant women (mean age 27 +/- 5.5 years) with prolapse of the mitral valve confirmed on echocardiography, without significant mitral regurgitation, in order to assess whether mitral valve prolapse is a risk factor for the development of complications during gestation and childbirth. As control served a group of 30 healthy pregnant women of corresponding age and number of previous pregnancies, incidence of complications during pregnancy, the type of delivery, sex, length, weight and maturity of the neonates. In women with mitral valve prolapse the authors recorded a significantly higher incidence of subjective complaints such as palpitations associated in 7 of 8 cases with sinus tachycardia 110-140/min. at rest and with vasovagal syncopes. The palpitations were always favourably influenced by beta-blocker therapy or by calcium antagonists. Mitral valve prolapse without haemodynamically significant mitral regurgitation during pregnancy is not a significant risk factor for the development of complications.", 
    "57": "We have examined the effects of alloxan on the binding of [3H]prazosin and [125I]monoiodocyanopindolol (ICYP) to plasma-membrane-enriched microsomes isolated from dog aortas and dog mesenteric arteries respectively. Preincubation of the vascular smooth muscle membranes with alloxan reduced the number of binding sites of the alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the affinity of the radioligands for the adrenoceptors was not affected by alloxan. Streptozotocin, which is also a diabetogenic agent like alloxan, had no effect on the radioligand binding to these adrenoceptors under similar experimental conditions. The inhibitory effects of alloxan on binding to beta-adrenoceptors were found to be highly pH-dependent. These results indicate that alloxan exerts adverse effects on cell membrane adrenoceptors in addition to those on the ion-transport function of vascular smooth muscle cell [Kwan (1988) Biochem. J. 254, 293-296], and also suggest that the primary site of action of alloxan is the plasma membrane.", 
    "58": "The efficacy of the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine alone and in combination with the beta blocking agent acebutolol or hydrochlorothiazide was tested in 34 patients with moderate essential hypertension. After a wash out period of three to four weeks, all patients received placebo for two weeks, thereafter 20 mg of nitrendipine per day for four weeks. When diastolic blood pressure remained above 95 mmHg with nitrendipine, acebutolol (200 mg/d) or the thiazide (25 mg/d) was added in a randomised double-blind fashion. With nitrendipine alone, blood pressure could be normalized in nine patients with a drop in pressure from 168/108 to 152/89 mmHg. The other patients showed a fall in blood pressure from 164/110 to 152/102 mmHg. In these patients, the addition of acebutolol or thiazide was followed by a further fall in blood pressure which was similar with both drugs. With acebutolol blood pressure decreased from 154/102 to 146/94 mmHg and with the thiazide from 152/102 to 147/95 mmHg, respectively. Minor and mostly transient side effects were predominantly seen during therapy with nitrendipine alone. The fall in diastolic but not systolic blood pressure with nitrendipine was correlated with age. The blood pressure lowering effect of nitrendipine was independent of plasma renin activity and intracellular electrolyte concentrations. In the therapy of moderate hypertension, nitrendipine given in combination with a betablocker or a thiazide diuretic is effective and well tolerated.", 
    "59": "In 352 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, a multicenter double-masked, parallel-group clinical study compared the effects on intraocular pressure and ocular comfort of 0.5% betaxolol ophthalmic solution, a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, with 0.25% betaxolol suspension. With twice-daily dosages, baseline intraocular pressure was significantly reduced (P = .0005), with no significant difference between the two groups, at Week 2 and at Months 1, 2, and 3. Further, the prevalence of ocular discomfort upon topical instillation was significantly lower for 0.25% betaxolol suspension than for 0.5% betaxolol solution (P = .0005).",

Results showed antihypertensive efficacy and systemic tolerability of ketanserin to be equal to that of metoprolol and better cardiac tolerance for ketanserin.", 
    "61": "The three-dimensional structure of charybdotoxin, a high-affinity peptide blocker of several potassium ion channels, was determined by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2-D NMR) spectroscopy. Unambiguous NMR assignments of backbone and side chain hydrogens were made for all 37 amino acids. The structure was determined by distance geometry and refined by nuclear Overhauser and exchange spectroscopy back calculation. The peptide is built on a foundation of three antiparallel beta strands to which other parts of the sequence are attached by three disulfide bridges. The overall shape is roughly ellipsoidal, with axes of approximately 2.5 and 1.5 nanometers. Nine of the ten charged groups are located on one side of the ellipsoid, with seven of the eight positive residues lying in a stripe 2.5 nanometers in length. The other side displays three hydrophobic residues projecting prominently into aqueous solution. The structure rationalizes several mechanistic features of charybdotoxin block of the high-conductance Ca2(+)-activated K+ channel.", 
    "62": "The combination of thromboxane synthase inhibition with thromboxane receptor antagonism has been shown to result in a strong inhibition of platelet aggregation and a prolongation of the bleeding time (Gresele et al., J. Clin Invest 1987; 80: 1435-45). Ridogrel is a single molecule that efficiently achieves both inhibitions in human volunteers. The present study was performed in patients with obstructive peripheral arterial disease and elevated plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels. Patients were treated with either 2 x 300 mg ridogrel or 2 x 300 mg placebo per day for 2 1/2 days, according to a double blind randomised parallel design. Plasma beta-thromboglobulin decreased significantly throughout active treatment starting within 2 h after administration; serum and urinary immunoreactive TxB2 levels and urinary 11-dehydro-TxB2 excretion were significantly lower and serum PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels significantly higher with ridogrel; no changes were observed in the placebo-treated group. In conclusion this study demonstrates a reduction of platelet activation in vivo by ridogrel.", 
    "63": "Questionnaires about therapy in unstable angina pectoris were sent to 63 Danish medical departments and were answered by 52 departments (82.5%). Nitroglycerin is commonly used but only in half of the departments is Nitroglycerin administered intravenously. Calcium-receptor-blockers are used in more departments (65%) than beta-receptor-blockers (35%) (p less than 0.05). Five departments use thrombolytic therapy along local guidelines. All recommend aspirin as prophylaxis against thrombosis and 63% recommend the therapy to be continued for life. An exercise test is always performed during hospital stay in 1/3 of the departments while the rest of the departments often wait till after the patient has been discharged. The estimate of frequency of coronary angiography varied considerably: from less than 5% to 100%. The frequency of coronary angiography was stated to be higher in Copenhagen and Aarhus (median 50%, interval 10-100%) than in the rest of the country (median 15%, interval less than 5-75%) (p less than 0.01).", 
    "64": "A latent, gene-linked alteration of hippocampal network excitability in tg/tg mutant mice was unmasked in vitro by convulsant-activated synchronous neuronal discharges. Exposure to elevated extracellular potassium ions or 4-aminopyridine, but not picrotoxin, revealed an abnormally prolonged network discharge duration in the mutant CA3 pyramidal cell region. In both phenotypes, noradrenaline, and a selective beta-noradrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, reversibly accelerated the frequency of the discharges. These findings identify an intrinsic alteration in the excitability of an isolated neuronal network in a model of inherited generalized spike-wave epilepsy, and further implicate noradrenergic mechanisms in the temporal modulation of hippocampal synchronization and epileptogenesis.", 
    "65": "Noninvasive 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed in 17 normotensive and 19 preeclamptic pregnant women. The normotensive women showed a significant nightly decline in their systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In contrast, the preeclamptic women demonstrated either an attenuated circadian rhythm or no circadian rhythm at all. This result was even more pronounced in patients with severe hypertension, some of whom had a nocturnal increase in blood pressure in spite of being treated with antihypertensive drugs in an evening dose. The lack of nocturnal blood pressure decrease was also found 24 hours post partum. In summary, these results suggest that preeclamptic women are endangered by hypertensive emergencies mostly during the night. Therefore blood pressure controls should be extended into the night, and antihypertensive drugs should also be given in a sufficient evening dose.", 
    "66": "We studied the effect of (E)-3-[p-(1H-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)phenyl]-2-propenoic acid hydrochloride monohydrate (OKY-046.HCl), a specific thromboxane (TX) A2 synthetase inhibitor, on airway hyperresponsiveness of guinea pigs. OKY-046.HCl (30-100 mg/kg, intraduodenally (i.d.) or orally (p.o.)) suppressed dose dependently the airway hyperresponsiveness to acetylcholine (ACh) induced by formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), platelet activating factor (PAF) and repetitive antigen. OKY-046.HCl (100 mg/kg) also inhibited the increase in TXB2 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) induced by FMLP, PAF and antigen. Aspirin 10 or 30 mg/kg i.d. or p.o.) suppressed the airway hyperresponsiveness induced by FMLP and PAF but not by antigen. Azelastine (10 mg/kg i.d.) was ineffective on PAF- and antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. TXA2 mimetic drugs caused airway hyperresponsiveness that was not inhibited by OKY-046.HCl (30 mg/kg i.v.). Furthermore, OKY-046.HCl showed no effect on propranolol- and physostigmine-induced airway hyperresponsiveness which did not accompany TXB2 generation in BALF. The number of eosinophils in BALF increased after FMLP exposure, an effect which was not inhibited by OKY-046.HCl. These results suggest that OKY-046.HCl inhibits airway hyperresponsiveness by suppressing TXA2 generation. We suggest that OKY-046.HCl will be a new antiasthmatic drug.", 
    "67": "Quipazine (0.5-2 mg/kg i.v.) produced transient hypotension and bradycardia followed by sustained hypertension and variable effects on heart rate in anaesthetized rats. The hypotension, bradycardia and sympatho-inhibitory effects of quipazine were attenuated by bivagotomy. In bivagotomized rats, the hypertension produced by quipazine was not modified by hexamethonium or prazosin but was abolished by ritanserin (1 mg/kg i.v.). In ritanserin-treated rats, section of the carotid sinus nerves and vagus nerves or ICS 205.930 (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) abolished the hypotensive, bradycardic and sympatho-inhibitory effects of quipazine; the action of quipazine was not reproducible in these rats. Quipazine also inhibited the Bezold-Jarish reflex elicited by 5-HT (20 micrograms/kg i.v.). In ICS 205.930-treated rats, the hypertension evoked by quipazine was associated with a reduction in splanchnic nerve activity due to stimulation of baroreceptors. The renin-angiotensin system is not involved in the hypertensive response. The increase in heart rate produced by quipazine in bivagotomized rats was reduced by ritanserin and tertatolol (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) and abolished by a combination of both drugs. We conclude that the bradycardic and sympatho-inhibitory effects of quipazine result from activation of 5-HT3 receptors located in the cardiopulmonary area and of carotid body chemoreceptors. The hypertension and tachycardia are mediated by vascular and myocardial 5-HT2 receptors. No evidence was obtained for a central sympatho-excitatory effect.", 
    "68": "The effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (dl-nebivolol, atenolol and propranolol) and of 1-nebivolol on cardiodynamics and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation were studied in the isolated working rabbit heart subjected to normothermic global ischemia, followed, in some cases, by reperfusion. The hearts were pretreated with the different drugs (0.32 mg/l) 30 min before the start of ischemia, dl-Nebivolol and propranolol provided protection for both cardiodynamic and mitochondrial functions, as did l-nebivolol, which lacks beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties, while atenolol failed to protect mechanical activity and cardiac mitochondria against the effects of ischemia and post-ischemic reperfusion. Catecholamine depletion with reserpine did not have a beneficial effect on the recovery of cardiodynamic and mitochondrial function during post-ischemic reperfusion. It is concluded that the beneficial effects of beta-blockers on the ischemic and reperfused myocardium can not be explained by a specific beta-blocking action alone.", 
    "69": "Respiratory alkalosis decreases the phosphaturic response to parathyroid hormone (PTH). beta-adrenoreceptor blockade by propranolol infusion restores the phosphaturic effect of PTH in respiratory alkalotic rats; however, the nephron site of these changes in phosphate reabsorption by propranolol is not known. The present study was performed to localize the nephron segment(s) involved in the restoration of the phosphaturic effect of PTH by propranolol infusion in respiratory alkalotic rats. PTH infusion increased the fractional delivery of phosphate (FDPi) to the late proximal tubule to similar levels in the propranolol and vehicle-infused respiratory alkalotic rats (FDPi 46.6 +/- 4.4% and 48.6 +/- 4.2%, respectively). In contrast, PTH only increased FDPi to the early distal tubules (to 17.1 +/- 0.9%) in the absence of propranolol compared to FDPi 41.9 +/- 2.5% in the presence of propranolol in respiratory alkalotic animals. We conclude that the restoration of the phosphaturic effect of PTH in respiratory alkalotic rats by propranolol infusion is due primarily to decreased reabsorption of phosphate by the straight segment of the proximal tubule.", 
    "70": "The hemodynamic effects of labetalol and sodium nitroprusside were compared in 19 subjects who became hypertensive at the conclusion of elective carotid endarterectomy. Following randomization and standard anesthetic protocol, treatment was administered when blood pressure exceeded 160 mmHg systolic or 90 mmHg diastolic at the conclusion of surgery. Group 1 subjects (n = 9) received 0.25 mg/kg labetalol in divided doses, followed by repeat doses of 0.50 mg/kg until blood pressure was less than 160/90 mmHg or until they had received 300 mg total dose. Group 2 subjects (n = 10) were started on a nitroprusside infusion at 0.5 micrograms/kg/min, titrated to achieve blood pressure less than 160/90 mmHg, or up to a rate of 6.0 micrograms/kg/min. Data were collected at 15-minute intervals for 12 hours. Analysis with repeated measures analysis of covariance (p less than 0.05) found no significant differences between groups in any measured parameter. A significant time effect was found for both groups. The results suggest that labetalol is an effective alternative to nitroprusside for the management of postoperative hypertension in this patient population. For the majority of such patients, labetalol may be the drug of choice for postendarterectomy hemodynamic control.", 
    "71": "Prostaglandin F2 alpha-isopropylester (PGF2 alpha-IE) (0.5 microgram) or placebo was added twice daily for 1 week to one eye in each of 30 patients with open angle glaucoma not adequately controlled with timolol treatment. Compared with placebo, PGF2 alpha-IE reduced the intraocular pressure of these timolol-treated eyes significantly. The absolute difference in mean change between PGF2 alpha-IE and placebo groups was 4.5 mm Hg with a 95% confidence interval of 3.1 to 6.6 mm Hg, corresponding to a mean reduction of initial intraocular pressure of 17.4% in eyes treated with PGF2 alpha-IE. Conjunctival or episcleral hyperemia was seen in all eyes treated with PGF2 alpha-IE for up to 4 hours but not in eyes treated with timolol and placebo, and aqueous flare was not observed in any eye. Thirteen of 15 patients treated with PGF2 alpha-IE, compared with only 3 of 15 who received placebo, reported mild to moderate subjective discomfort in the treated eye in the form of a foreign-body sensation that lasted for up to 2 hours. These results demonstrate that PGF2 alpha-IE, in a dose that has previously been shown to reduce intraocular pressure in normotensive volunteers or in patients with glaucoma who are taking no other medications, also significantly reduces the intraocular pressure of patients with glaucoma whose pressures are not adequately controlled on a twice-daily regimen of timolol.", 
    "72": "Patients with cirrhosis may show ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) inequality in the absence of any intrinsic heart or lung disease. However, the high cardiac output of cirrhosis generally prevents or minimizes the appearance of a severe degree of arterial hypoxemia. Propranolol has been used to reduce cardiac output and portal pressure in these patients. We wondered whether it might alter arterial oxygenation and reduce O2 transport to tissues. We studied eight patients (three women) 54 +/- 3 (SEM) yr of age before and after intravenous propranolol (0.1 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/h). Cardiac output (QT) fell from 7.8 +/- 0.7 to 6.0 +/- 0.7 L/min (p less than 0.05), and portal pressure was reduced (22 +/- 2 to 19 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). Arterial PO2 did not change (88 +/- 4 to 89 +/- 5 mm Hg) because the fall in mixed venous PO2 (43 +/- 1 to 40 +/- 1 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) that followed the lower QT was counterbalanced by a lower intrapulmonary shunt (multiple inert gas technique) (4 +/- 2 to 2 +/- 1%, p less than 0.05) and a shift of the VA/Q distributions toward a higher VA/Q ratio. Paralleling the fall in QT, oxygen transport to tissues (QO2) was reduced (19 +/- 2 to 14 +/- 1 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.01). However, O2 uptake (VO2) remained constant (3.4 +/- 0.2 to 3.6 +/- 0.2 ml/min/kg) because O2 extraction by the tissues increased appropriately (22 +/- 2 to 28 +/- 1%, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "73": "One hundred twenty-six patients with mild to moderate hypertension responsive to beta-adrenergic blocking agents--alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs--entered this open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of metoprolol OROS (metoprolol fumarate). Metoprolol OROS was given once daily for 14 weeks in doses ranging from 100 to 600 mg. Satisfactory blood pressure control was achieved by 85% of the patients at doses between 100 and 400 mg. Mean diastolic blood pressure was maintained at or below 90 mm Hg. Adverse reactions were experienced by 29% of the patients; most of these reactions were mild or moderate, and none was unexpected for treatment with a beta-blocker. Only three patients withdrew because of adverse reactions. The results of this study indicate that metoprolol OROS given once daily is safe and well tolerated.", 
    "74": "Four double-blind, Latin-square studies were conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic bioavailability of metoprolol OROS (oral osmotic) and the conventional tablet (CT) of metoprolol. Metoprolol OROS (7/95 mg or 14/190 mg) was administered once daily in doses equivalent to 100 mg of metoprolol CT given once, twice, thrice, and four times a day. In all four studies, lower peak plasma concentrations and longer times to peak were observed after metoprolol OROS than after metoprolol CT, indicating a controlled-release profile for metoprolol OROS. beta-Adrenergic blockade, as measured by reductions in exercise heart rate, was lower after metoprolol OROS than after metoprolol CT, but metoprolol OROS provided a smoother and more sustained beta-blockade. All four doses of metoprolol OROS at steady state produced relative pharmacodynamic bioavailability that ranged from 87% to 104% of that produced by equivalent doses of metoprolol CT.", 
    "75": "Renal function is known to sometimes have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of drugs or drug metabolites, which are eliminated in appreciable amounts by the kidneys. For this reason, we conducted a study to compare the plasma concentration profiles of metoprolol and its metabolite, alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (OH-metoprolol), in healthy volunteers and in renally impaired patients. Following a single oral dose of a 14/190 metoprolol OROS (oral osmotic) tablet, plasma metoprolol profiles were shown to be similar for both subject groups. However, in renally impaired patients, renal clearance of OH-metoprolol was reduced and mean plasma levels of OH-metoprolol were increased approximately two- to threefold in comparison with healthy volunteers. The accumulation of OH-metoprolol in plasma, however, is unlikely to contribute to the beta-blocking effect of metoprolol, since OH-metoprolol possesses only one tenth the activity of its parent compound.", 
    "76": "The effect of four weeks of treatment with beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP, 500 micrograms twice daily) on the bronchial responsiveness to propranolol was examined in 16 patients with mild asthma in a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study. Propranolol was inhaled in doubling concentrations and the results were expressed as the cumulative dose producing a 20 percent fall in FEV1 (PC20). After four weeks of treatment with BDP, the mean FEV1 increased from 82.0 percent predicted to 88.1 percent predicted. The difference was significant (p less than 0.001). Treatment with BDP did not significantly change the responsiveness to propranolol, the geometric mean PC20 being 3.17 mg/ml before and 3.64 mg/ml after BDP treatment. The recovery of FEV1 was faster after 60 minutes of BDP treatment in comparison with placebo treatment (beyond 90 minutes). This study suggests that BDP treatment is unable to reduce bronchial responsiveness to propranolol but can accelerate the recovery of bronchoconstriction induced by propranolol in asthmatic patients.", 
    "77": "The Food and Drug Administration has received 11 reports of cases (three fatal) in the United States in which hepatocellular damage was associated with labetalol. The temporal circumstances strongly implicate labetalol; the conditions of nine patients improved after cessation of labetalol therapy, and one patient had a recurrence after therapy was restarted. Follow-up with each reporting physician failed to provide historic or laboratory evidence for other viral, toxic, or drug-induced causes of hepatocellular damage, and the case series did not show the demographic and historic risk factors that would be expected if non-A, non-B hepatitis were the cause. Reports of microscopic liver examinations were available in the 5 cases in which they were done. The reported histologic changes were consistent with hepatocellular necrosis in four instances and chronic active hepatitis in one. The clinical presentation of the cases was most compatible with the mechanism of metabolic idiosyncracy, but other pathogenetic explanations could not be entirely excluded.", 
    "78": "Sixty patients with recurrent inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia were prospectively treated with nadolol (40 or 80 mg/day). Old myocardial infarction was present in 43 patients and dilated cardiomyopathy in 12. In group I (n = 36), nadolol was given alone, whereas in group II (n = 24), previously ineffective treatment with amiodarone was continued in combination with nadolol. Left ventricular ejection fraction was higher in patients in group I (0.40 +/- 0.12) than in group II (0.30 +/- 0.10, p less than 0.01) patients. Electrophysiologic study was repeated after short-term treatment with nadolol, which was continued regardless of the results of this test, according to the scheme of the parallel approach. Recurrence of spontaneous tachycardia or sudden death occurred in 21 patients after 10 +/- 9.2 months; sustained tachycardia was inducible in 19 on nadolol therapy. The remaining 39 patients (of whom 21 had inducible tachycardia while taking the drug) have had no recurrence of tachycardia after 27.8 +/- 9.3 months of follow-up study. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of a positive and negative test were 90.5%, 46%, 47.5% and 90%, respectively. The results differ between group I and group II patients, the latter having a high percent of false positive responses. This difference is even more obvious with respect to left ventricular ejection fraction: the predictive value of a positive test was 86% when ejection fraction was greater than 0.40 and 39% when it was less than 0.40.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "79": "Three cases of apparently drug-induced Grinspan's syndrome involving the triad of oral lichen planus, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension are reported. Because drug therapy for diabetes mellitus and hypertension is capable of producing lichenoid reactions of the oral mucosa, the question arises as to whether Grinspan's syndrome is an iatrogenically induced syndrome.", 
    "80": "A retrospective analysis was made from the charts of 53 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension to determine the effects of pindolol (PIN) monotherapy, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) added to PIN monotherapy, and PIN added to HCTZ monotherapy on serum lipids and blood pressure. PIN monotherapy (Group I, n = 24) resulted in a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic pressure of 12.0 and 9.0 mmHg at three months and 14.0 and 11.0 mmHg at 12 months, respectively. Serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein cholesterol fractions remained unchanged. The addition of 25 mg of HCTZ to PIN (Group II, n = 7) resulted in a significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic pressure of 21.0 and 11.0 mmHg at three months and 24.0 and 11.0 mmHg at 12 months, respectively. No change in serum lipids was noted. Adding PIN to 25 mg HCTZ (Group III, n = 22) resulted in a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic pressure of 18.0 and 9.0 mmHg at three months and 20.0 and 10.0 mmHg at 12 months, respectively, with no change in serum lipids noted. These data indicate that long-term administration of PIN, a drug possessing intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, alone or added to a low dose of a thiazide diuretic does not adversely affect serum lipids. The addition of a small dose of a thiazide diuretic to PIN has no long-term effect on plasma lipids.", 
    "81": "The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of propranolol administered either by i.v. infusion or by prolonged oral administration (4 days) during the first 3 weeks following burns. The resting metabolic rate (RMR) of 10 non-infected fasting burned patients (TBSA: 28 per cent, range 18-37 per cent) was determined four times consecutively by indirect calorimetry (open circuit hood system) following: (1) i.v. physiological saline; (2) i.v. propranolol infusion (2 micrograms/kg/min following a bolus of 80 micrograms/kg); (3) oral propranolol (40 mg q.i.d. during 4 +/- 1 days); and (4) in control patients. All patients showed large increases in both RMR (144 +/- 2 per cent of reference values) and in urinary catecholamine excretion (three to four times as compared to control values). The infusion of propranolol induced a significant decrease in RMR to 135 +/- 2 per cent and oral propranolol to 129 +/- 3 per cent of reference values. A decrease in lipid oxidation but no change in carbohydrate and protein oxidation were observed during propranolol administration. It is concluded that the decrease in RMR induced by propranolol was not influenced by the route of administration. The magnitude of the decrease in energy expenditure suggests that beta-adrenergic hyperactivity represents only one of the mediators of the hypermetabolic response to burn injury.", 
    "82": "The normal once-a-day frequency of suckling in the rabbit was increased on day 31 (late lactation) by the addition of two extra sucklings (8 and 16 hr after) the daily suckling. In confirmation of previous data, two additional sucklings significantly decreased milk yield acutely on day 31 in comparison with the average 4-day milk yield before and after day 31. The decrease in milk secretion after the two additional sucklings was prevented by a single injection of 3 mg prolactin (given 24 hr before the two extra sucklings) and/or by injections of the beta-adrenergic-blocking drug, propranolol (100 micrograms/kg b. wt. given 30 min before each additional suckling). Since prolactin secretion is decreased in these species and the mammary gland is less responsive to the hormone during late lactation, the present results suggest that in addition to these factors, suckling-induced activation of sympathetic influences may contribute to the decline in milk production at this stage of lactation. Taken together, these results suggest that suckling may regulate lactation in the rabbit through antagonistic mechanisms at different stages of lactation.", 
    "83": "After a 7-day washout period, 16 subjects suffering from unipolar depression were randomly assigned to either desipramine (DMI) or DMI plus propranolol treatment for 21 days. Both groups showed a significant improvement in their scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) after 21 days of drug treatment. However, there was no significant difference in the improvement in HRSD scores between the two groups. The results of this pilot study support the need to reevaluate the popular belief that propranolol induces or worsens depression.", 
    "84": "The abilities of the new calcium antagonist anipamil as well as the beta-blocker atenolol to reduce the amount of K+ released into the extracellular space during the first minutes of acute coronary artery occlusion were investigated in anaesthetized pigs. [K+]e was continuously measured epicardially with ion selective electrodes. Immediately after starting an occlusion [K+]e rose steeply from normal plasma levels of 3.5 mmol/l to values about three times as high at the end of the 6-min occlusion. This was reproducible in a second and third occlusion in the untreated control group. In the treatment groups either anipamil (0.5; 1.0 mg/kg) or atenolol (0.3 mg/kg) were injected intravenously 10 min before the second occlusion. Anipamil inhibited K+ loss into the extracellular space dose relatedly and significantly throughout the 6-min occlusion period, whereas atenolol showed no protection. The cardioprotective effect of anipamil was also demonstrated in a third occlusion 60 min post application. This different profile cannot be explained by differences in the ability of the two drugs to lower myocardial oxygen consumption; indeed this was only achieved after atenolol. It is concluded that anipamil exerted a direct protective effect on the cardiac myocyte level during ischaemia.", 
    "85": "The prejunctional inhibitory effects of a series of 5-HT1 receptor agonists were examined against the isometric contraction of epididymal portions of rat vas deferens evoked by single stimulus pulses in the presence of nifedipine (10 mumol/l). The 5-HT1A ligand flesinoxan produced inhibition of contractions which was not inhibited by cyanopindolol or yohimbine. However, the prejunctional inhibitory concentration response curve for the 5-HT1 agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) was biphasic in tissues from 1.5 month old animals but monophasic in tissues from 24 months animals. Cyanopindolol (1 mumol/l) antagonised the inhibitory effects of 5-CT in tissues from 1.5 and 3 month animals but not in tissues from 8 or 24 months animals. Inhibitory actions of 5-CT were not prevented by pretreating animals with pertussis toxin (6 micrograms/kg i.v.), a dose which abolished the negative inotropic response to acetylcholine in rat left atria. It is concluded that the nerve terminals of vas deferens from 1.5 month old animals contain both 5-HT1B and other as yet unclassified 5-HT1 receptors, but that this 5-HT1B-mediated response is lost in maturation and ageing.", 
    "86": "The action of dopamine (DA, 10 micrograms/kg/min) on pentagastrin (16 micrograms/kg/hr) stimulated gastric acid secretion was studied by use of Ghosh-Schild's rats. DA suppressed pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion 44.6 percent compared with the level before administration. This decrease in acid was inhibited by pretreatment with beta 1 and beta 1 + beta 2 blockers and pretreatment with DA1 + DA2 and DA1 antagonists. The gastric acid secretion with DA1 agonist decreased 36.4 percent from the level at the time of pentagastrin administration. This decrease was inhibited by pretreatment with beta 1 blocker, but suppression of gastric acid secretion by beta 1 + beta 2 stimulator was not inhibited by pretreatment with DA1 antagonist. These results suggest that DA stimulated beta 1 adrenalin receptor via DA1 receptor and thereby suppresses pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion.", 
    "87": "The ratio between ocular and systemic drug concentrations describes the relative safety of ophthalmic dosage forms of the same drug in terms of its systemic side effects. In this study, we evaluated the effects of epinephrine pretreatment and solution pH on the aqueous humor:plasma and iris-ciliary body:plasma ratios of peak timolol concentrations after ocular application of timolol. Timolol eyedrops (5 mg/mL, 25 microL) were applied ocularly in pigmented rabbits. Raising pH of the eyedrops from 6.2 to 7.5 did not affect the ratio between ocular and systemic peak drug concentrations, since both ocular and systemic concentrations of timolol were increased. Administration of epinephrine (20 mg/mL, 50 microL) 5 min prior to timolol eyedrop administration reduced the peak timolol concentrations in plasma 65-80%. Epinephrine did not affect the ocular concentrations of timolol. The decreased peak concentrations in plasma were due to the conjunctival and nasal vasoconstricting effects of epinephrine and to the subsequent slower absorption of timolol. Our study demonstrates that compared with currently available eyedrops (pH 6.9), the ocular:systemic concentration ratio of ophthalmic timolol can be improved four- to sixfold in rabbits by combining epinephrine-induced conjunctival and nasal vasoconstriction and improved ocular absorption from pH 7.5 eyedrops.", 
    "88": "A multicenter, parallel, double-blind, 181-patient study compared the safety and antihypertensive efficacy of immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (ER) hydralazine. After 2 to 4 weeks on diuretic, patients were maintained on diuretic and randomized to a hydralazine treatment regimen: IR thrice daily, ER twice daily, or ER once daily. Daily doses of hydralazine were 75, 150, or 300 mg. Although designed as a titration study, important dose-response data were available for analysis with nonlinear mixed effect modeling (NONMEM). Sitting diastolic blood pressure (BP) was selected as the response variable. Several factors were tested for importance, including body weight, time (week) effects, concomitant beta-blocker (BB) therapy, acetylator class, and treatment regimen. All factors were important (p less than 0.05) except treatment regimen (p greater than 0.30). The maximum antihypertensive response (Emax) to hydralazine was 9.4 mm Hg. The daily dose that elicited 50% of the maximum response (D50) was 0.87 mg/kg for slow acetylators and 1.68 mg/kg for fast acetylators. BP fell 0.52 mm Hg per week independent of other effects, and concomitant BB therapy induced a drop of 6.6 mm Hg in addition to hydralazine, diuretic and week effects. NONMEM's use assisted in evaluations and provided information not obtainable through traditional means.", 
    "89": "The combined effect of the residual propranolol, which was administrated up to the coronary revasculization, and verapamil, anti-supraventricular tachycardia drug, on the left ventricular contractility was evaluated with left ventricular end-systolic pressure-diameter relationship. Methods; Eighteen sheep were instrumented with ultrasonic crystals on the anterior and posterior wall, endocardium and epicardium. A pressure transducer was placed in the left ventricle. Propranolol (0.15 mg/kg) (n = 6) or verapamil (0.15 mg/kg) (n = 6) or both drugs (n = 6) were administrated intravenously, and cardiac function was evaluated. Results; In combined group, end-systolic pressure-diameter ratio (Emax) was significantly decreased (2.95 +/- 0.24 mmHg/mm) as compared to the control group (7.95 +/- 0.83), propranolol group (6.27 +/- 0.78), and verapamil group (4.54 +/- 0.77). Conclusion; Co-existence of propranolol and verapamil significantly decreased cardiac contractility. Therefore verapamil should be administrated carefully in the presence of residual propranolol, and the co-existence of both drugs must be limited.", 
    "90": "We studied the efficacy of amiodarone (800, 600, 400 and 200 mg orally daily during weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively) plus propylthiouracil (PTU, 100 mg orally every 8 h) in comparison to PTU alone in the early treatment (28 days) of Graves' disease patients. Circulating T3 and T4 decreased earlier and more markedly in the amiodarone plus PTU-treated group. An initial rise of circulating rT3 above the base-line value followed by a gradual decline was observed in the former group while only a decline below the base-line values was observed in the latter group. The resting pulse rate decreased and body weight increased significantly in the amiodarone plus PTU-treated group. In the PTU-treated group, significant weight gain was observed later in the course of treatment while no significant reduction in pulse rate was observed. No major side-effects of amiodarone were observed during the course of treatment. This study suggested that the combination of amiodarone and PTU was more efficacious than PTU alone in reducing circulating T3, T4 and clinical hyperthyroidism early in the course of treatment of patients with Graves' disease. This regimen has an additional potential advantage because of the antiarrhythmic property of amiodarone, especially in situations when a beta-blocker is contraindicated.", 
    "91": "The effect of a blood pressure reduction by 10 mg extended release felodipine once daily on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) as well as the possible diabetogenic effect of felodipine was studied. A 2 X 12 week placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study was performed in 12 hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients without nephropathy on concomitant treatment with beta-blocker and/or a diuretic agent. Metabolic control as estimated by fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c and fasting plasma C-peptide was unaltered after felodipine. Blood pressure was significantly reduced by felodipine: systolic 166 +/- 26 mm Hg (placebo) v 153 +/- 26 mm Hg (felodipine) (P less than .05) and diastolic 95 +/- 7 mm Hg v 90 +/- 8 mm Hg (P less than .05). Heart rate was unchanged. There was no correlation between blood pressure and UAE, but the relative change in UAE expressed as UAE placebo/UAE felodipine was significantly correlated to the fall in systolic blood pressure (r = 0.64, P = .03) and mean blood pressure (r = 0.66, P = .02). Since microalbuminuria predicts proteinuria and reduced survival, early antihypertensive treatment may be beneficial in NIDDM as it is in IDDM. Long-term consequences on kidney function and mortality remains, however, to be elucidated.", 
    "92": "The effect of diazepam, haloperidol, MK-801, and propranolol in antagonizing behavioral symptoms induced by lethal doses of cocaine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine were studied in a rat model. Animals were first pretreated IP with potential antagonists, diazepam (2, 5, and 10 mg/kg), haloperidol (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg), propranolol (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg), MK-801 (0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 mg/kg), and then were challenged IP with cocaine (70 mg/kg) (LD85), d-amphetamine (75 mg/kg) (LD100), and methamphetamine (100 mg/kg) (LD90). Diazepam, at all doses, provided significant protection against cocaine- (p less than or equal to 0.01) and methamphetamine- (p less than or equal to 0.05) induced seizures and produced a dose-dependent effect against amphetamine-induced seizures. MK-801, at all doses, reduced seizures in all groups (p less than or equal to 0.01). Propranolol altered the incidence of methamphetamine-induced seizures. Significant protection against cocaine-induced death was afforded by diazepam (p less than or equal to 0.01) and propranolol (p less than or equal to 0.05). Significant protection against amphetamine-induced death was provided by haloperidol (all doses, p less than or equal to 0.1), MK-801 (all doses, p less than or equal to 0.1), and propranolol (10 and 20 mg/kg, p less than or equal to 0.1). No agent reduced the incidence of methamphetamine- (50 or 100 mg/kg) induced death. The failure of d-amphetamine antagonists to protect against methamphetamine-induced toxicity and death suggest that different mechanisms of toxicity may exist between these drugs.", 
    "93": "In the presence of prazosin and propranolol, electrical transmural stimulation of isolated dog mesenteric artery produced a sympathetic purinergic contraction, which was followed by a relaxation in PGF2 alpha-contracted arteries. Such purinergic responses were mimicked by brief exposure to alpha, beta-methylene ATP (alpha, beta-Me ATP) and were completely inhibited after desensitization of P2x-purinergic receptors. However, exogenous ATP predominantly evoked a relaxation in PGF2 alpha-contracted artery. These results suggest that the sympathetic purinergic response may be caused by a P2x-purinergic receptor-selective mechanism or substance, rather than ATP."
