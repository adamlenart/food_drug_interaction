    "0": "The effect of tyramine infusion or exercise on catecholamine concentration and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity in plasma of normal volunteers has been studied. Whereas the increase in plasma catecholamine concentrations by tyramine infusion was not changed 90 min after oral application of a single dose of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (penbutolol, practolol, I.C.I. 66082), the increase in blood pressure was diminished. However, the increase in plasma catecholamine, concentration, i.e. the adrenergic response to exercise was significantly enhanced during beta-adrenoceptor blockade. On the other hand, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity was not further increased during beta-adrenoceptor blockade. - The non-specific membrane activity of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs wass assessed by the degree of inhibition of serotonin uptake by human platelets in vitro. Their order of potency, according to IC 50 values estimated from the dose response curves was: propranolol less than penbutolol less than practolol less than I.C.I. 66082. The inhibitory activity of these drugs in vivo was also studied by measuring serotonin uptake by platelets isolated 90 min after oral administration. Due to the high dose only propranolol showed a marked membrane activity.", 
    "1": "Studies in 55 patients with benign essential hypertension showed that the beta-blockers bufuralol (22 patients) and propranolol (33 patients) at a dose ratio of 1:4, possess comparable antihypertensive efficacy despite different properties regarding intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Beta-blocker-monotherapy normalized blood pressure ( less than 140/90 mm Hg) in one fourth of the patients. Body weight and plasma and blood volumes remained unchanged during beta-blockade of four to six weeks duration, the mean plasma potassium was slightly increased. The inhibition of plasma renin activity (PRA) was more pronounced with propranolol (-69%) than with bufuralol (-47%). Wirth both beta-blockers decreases in blood pressure correlated inversely with pre-treatment PRA (p less than 0.05). Propranolol-induced changes in blood pressure correlated also with associated changes in PRA (p less than 0.005); in contrast, no such relationship was observed with bufuralol. The blood pressure effects of bufuralol, however, correlated significantly with changes in urinary noradrenaline excretion (r=0.41; p less than 0.05). Patient sub-groups with low, normal or high pre-treatment PRA in the average showed a comparable pattern of pre-treatment noradrenaline excretion and patients with normal renin levels exreted more adrenaline than those with low renin levels (p less than 0.001). These data are consistent with the concept that in untreated essential hypertension PRA may be an index of adrenergic activiity, the latter representing an important determinant of blood pressure response to beta-blockade. The blood pressure lowering effects of bufuralol in benign essential hypertension seem to be independent of renin and may be related, at least partly, to diminished free peripheral noradrenaline levels.", 
    "2": "In the isolated rat uterus, mescaline induces contractions that are notably antagonized by catecholamines, by beta-adrenergic stimulants and certain beta-adrenergic blocking agents as well as by chlorpromazine, amitriptyline and methysergide.", 
    "3": "The effects of timolol (10 mg thrice daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg/day) have been compared in a double-blind factorial trial in 20 patients with essential hypertension. There were four randomised test phases of 8 weeks each during which patients received timolol alone, hydrochlorothiazide alone, timolol plus hydrochlorothiazide, and no treatment (placebo). Blood-pressure was measured weekly, alternately at the outpatient clinic and at the patient's home. Supine mean arterial pressure fell from 119 mm Hg in the placebo phase to 110 mm Hg in the hydrochlorothiazide phase, 106 mm Hg in the timolol phase, and 101 mm Hg in the combined timolol plus hydrochlorothiazide phase. Factorial analysis revealed that these effects of the two drugs were additive without any potentiation or antagonism. Mean plasma-renin activity (P.R.A.) was 5-02 ng/ml/3 h in the placebo phase falling to 1-79 in the timolol phase and rising to 9-54 in the diuretic phase, but remaining unchanged in the combined treatment phase (5-40 ng/ml/3 h). The data suggest that the hypotensive action of timolol is not dependent on the concomitant fall in P.R.A. The methods described provide a valuable tool for quantitating the effects of a given drug, and hence a valid basis for objective comparison.", 
    "4": "A kinetic analysis of the synergistic activation of turkey erythrocyte adenylate cyclase by 1-catecholamines and guanylyl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) is described. We have found that the role of the catecholamine hormone is to facilitate the activation of the enzyme by the guanyl nucleotide according to the following mechanism: R-E+G=R-EG R-EG+H=HR-EG leads to HR-E''G where R is the receptor, E the enzyme, G the guanyl nucleotide effector, and H the hormone. The binding steps are fast and reversible but the conversion of the inactive enzyme E to its active stable form (E'') occurs with a rate constant of k=0.7 min-1. This step is essentially irreversible in the presence of high Gpp(NH)p concentrations. In the absence of beta-agonist (1-catecholamine) and at low free Mg2+ concentrations, the activation of the enzyme is insignificant. At high Mg2+ concentration the conversion of E to E'' occurs slowly in the absence of hormone, probably by another pathway. Thus, the presence of a guanyl nucleotide at the allosteric site is obligatory but not sufficient to induce the conversion of the inactive enzyme to its active form. The process of enzyme activation requires both Gpp(NH)p and hormone and under these conditions is essentially irreversible. The permanently active enzyme is stable in the absence of hormone and Gpp(NH)p and its high catalytic activity is stable for many hours. However, hormone and ATP induce a conversion of the high activity to the low activity form. Thus, it seems that both the process of enzyme activation by Gpp(NH)p and its reversal are hormone dependent. Both processes are blocked by the beta-blocker propranolol.", 
    "5": "Guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), GTP, and other purine nucleotides selectively decrease the binding affinity of the beta-adrenergic receptors of frog erythrocyte membranes for beta-adrenergic agonists but not antagonists. Shifts in binding affinity were assessed by determining the ability of unlabeled ligands to compete with (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol for the membrane-bound receptors. The magnitude of the\"right\" shift in the binding displacement curve for any of 13 ligands tested was directly related to the intrinsic activity (maximal stimulatory capacity) of that agent for stimulation of the frog erythrocyte membrane adenylate cyclase. Thus, Gpp(NH)p-induced shifts in binding affinity were greatest for full agonists such as isoproterenol, intermediate for partial agonists such as soterenol, and no shifts were observed for antagonists such as propranolol. Shifts in binding affinity were observed only in preparations where agonist binding to the receptors leads to \"coupling\" of the receptors with adenylate cyclase. In solubilized preparations where the beta-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase are functionally \"uncoupled\", Gpp(NH)p did not cause right shifts in agonist receptor binding displacement curves. In particulate preparations the Km of Gpp(NH)p for stimulation of adenylate cyclase was identical with that for its effect on beta-adrenergic agonist binding affinity, 1 to 2 muM. Moreover, the ability of several other nucleotides to cause shifts in receptor binding affinity directly paralleled their previously determined affinities for the nucleotide regulatory sites on adenylate cyclase. Gpp(NH)p also shifted agonist dose-response curves for stimulation of adenylate cyclase, but to the left. As with the effects on the receptor binding curves, the effects of Gpp(NH)p on the \"apparent affinities\" of agonists for enzyme stimulation were directly related to their intrinsic activities. Gpp(NH)p also markedly increased the intrinsic activity of partial agonists. These results appear to indicate that conformational alterations in adenylate cyclase caused by occupation of nucleotide regulatory sites by Gpp(NH)p are capable of inducing alterations in the beta-adrenergic receptors. These receptor alterations are induced only when the receptors are \"coupled\" to the enzyme by virtue of agonist binding. The nucleotide-altered conformation of the beta-adrenergic receptors is characterized by decreased binding affinity for agonist but increased functional efficacy in stimulating the enzyme.", 
    "6": "Midcollicular decerebrate cats, with their cerebellum removes, were tested with controlled acceleratory motion in order to identify neurons in the medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) and lateral vestibular nucleus (LVN) which responded to a motion stimulus. Five-barredled micropipettes were used to record single neuron activity and to apply norepinephrine (NE), d-amphetamine and acetylcholine (ACh). These agents were studied on spontaneously firing cells which responded to a motion stimulus and others which were in the MVN were inhibited by NE and d-amphetamine but were unaffected by iontophoresis of the alpha-adrenergic blocking agent phentolamine or the beta-antagonists, MJ-1999 or propranolol. In the LVN a majority of the cells tested were excited by NE and d-amphetamine. NE excitation in the LVN was antagonized by phentolamine but not by MJ-1999 or propranolo. Cats pretreated with reserpine to deplete brain catechlamines showed typical responses to NE BUT IONTOPHORESIS OF D-AMPHETAMINE WAS WITHOUT EFFECT. Unlike the differential sensitivity observed for NE, ACh excited most cells in both the MVN and LVN. NE and ACh produced similar responsed on vestibular neurons modulated by motion and those not responsive to motion. These observations suggest that NE-containing terminals are in close proximity to the vestibular neurons which were tested and further implicate both NE and ACh as neurotransmitters in afferent pathways to the vestibular nuclei.", 
    "7": "A double-blind crossover evaluation of the antihypertensive effect of metoprolol v. placebo was carried out in a series of twenty-three patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension who were receiving chlorthalidone (25 mg daily) as their basic treatment. An individually titrated metoprolol dosage (75-300 mg) was used. The double-blind crossover study consisted of two 3-month periods during which the patients received either metoprolol or placebo in addition to chlorthalidone. Metoprolol, as compared with placebo, produced a statistically significant reduction of blood pressure, both in supine and standing positions. Normotension was achieved during metoprolol-chlorthalidone treatment in twenty-two of the twenty-three patients, but during placebo-chlorthalidone treatment in only twelve of the twenty-three patients. During the double-blind crossover study mild side-effects occurred during metoprolol-chlorthalidone treatment in fourteen patients during first month, in twelve patients during second month and seven patients during third month. During placebo-chlorthalidone treatment side effects occurred in seven, six and seven patients, respectively. In conclusion, metoprolol caused a significant fall in blood pressure when given to patients already receiving chlorthalidone. Metoprolol in combination with chlorthalidone appears to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for mild and moderate hypertension in those patients not responding to chlorthalidone alone.", 
    "8": "Some central and peripheral effects of orally administered propranolol (60 mg), diazepam (5 mg) and placebo were compared in normal subjects. The central effects measured were changes in magnitude of the contingent negative variation (CNV) and subjective anxiety ratings; the peripheral effects were changes in heart rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin response and hand steadiness. After diazepam there was a decrease in CNV magnitude and in the level of subjective anxiety; there was a slight fall in blood pressure but little change in heart rate. After propranolol, on the other hand, there was no significant change in CNV magnitude or anxiety rating, but a significant fall in heart rate and systolic blood pressure. It is concluded that, at the dosage used, propranolol, unlike diazepam, does not affect the central mechanisms determining CNV magnitude or subjective anxiety. The relationship of this finding to the use of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers in clinical anxiety states is discussed.", 
    "9": "Abnormal lymphocyte function has been frequently reported in patients with connective tissue diseases but its significance has been uncertain. Sequential studies of lymphocyte function were carried out in patients receiving the beta-adrenergic blocking drug practolol (Eraldin) both before and during the development of autoimmune complications. No evidence was obtained that abnormal lymphocyte function presaged the onset of autoimmunity, and when these tests did show deficient responses these could be correlated with disease activity in general.", 
    "10": "A single daily dose antihypertensive therapy with a new slow-release (SR) form of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent oxprenolol was as effective as a standard tid beta-blocker regimen in maintaining therapeutic effects over 24 hours. The good overall response rate (target larger than or equal to mmHg diastolic) of 67% was achieved in eight of the 11 high renin patients and 16 out of the 20 normal renin ones; the five low renin patients, who were also older, proved to be non-responsive. In terms of age, 83% of the patients aged under 40 years showed a reduction in diastolic pressure to larger than or equal to 95 mmHg, this percentage being significantly better than the 50% response rate in the 40--56-year-olds. In nine of the 12 beta-blocker non-responders the diastolic blood pressure was reduced to larger than 95 mmHg by adding a diuretic, and in four of the nine, all of them low renin patients, this effect persisted in response to diuretics alone. Oxprenolol SR suppresses renin acutely (59%) and chronically (62%), and it blunts the renin stimulatory effects of diuretics.", 
    "11": "1 Seventeen men, aged 45-57 yr, with essential hypertension showed obvious and, in the standing position, dose-related reductions in blood pressure during treatment with oral labetalol with weekly dose increments. 2 Pulse rate changes were not related to dose but reduced compared with pre-treatment values. 3 No postural hypotension was recorded indicating lack of a dominant alpha-adrenoreceptor-blocking component. 4 There was a small increase in mean fasting blood glucose levels during labetalol treatment but no alteration in insulin activity or response to an oral glucose tolerance test.", 
    "12": "1. The effect of various agents injected into the cerebral ventricles of the mouse, upon the tremor and hypothermia produced by oxotremorine (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) was studied. 2. Acetylcholine (0.1-10 mug) produced a dose-dependent potentiation of oxotremorine tremor in contrast to the multiphasic effect it had on the accompanying hypothermia. Both tremor and hypothermia were antagonised by very small doses (0.1-10 ng) of atropine. 3. Dopamine and apomorphine (0.1-10 mug) had no significant effect on oxotremorine tremor. A dose-dependent potentiation of hypothermia was, however, observed. 4. Noradrenaline (0.1-10 mug), phentolamine and propranolol (0.1-10 mug) produced no significant effect on tremor and inconsistent results were obtained on hypothermia. 5. Neither tremor nor hypothermia were affected by 5-hydroxytryptamine (1-20 mug). 6. Oxotremorine tremor appears to be due solely to the activation of cholinergic pathways, whereas the production of hypothermia is brought about via a system involving both cholinergic and dopaminergic components. 5-Hydroxytryptamine is not involved.", 
    "13": "We investigated the effects of the beta adrenergic blocker, propranolol, and the alpha adrenergic blocker, phenoxybenzamine, on sleep patterns in the rat by means of multiple 8-hr and 24-hr polygraphic recordings. Propranolol had no clear effect on time spent in waking, synchronized sleep or desynchronized sleep. Phenoxybenzamine at a dose of 40 mg/kg produced a significant increase in desynchronized sleep time and in the number of desynchronized sleep periods. This is consistent with the view that there may be a mechanism inhibiting the onset of desynchronized sleep periods which involves norepinephrine acting at alpha adrenergic receptors in the brain.", 
    "14": "1 The circulatory effects of labetalol 25 mg intravenously in six patients during 1% halothane anaesthesia were studied. 2Labetalol caused a marked decrease in arterial pressure and a consistent but modest (20%) decrease in cardiac output. Heart rate was slowed and stroke volume did not change significantly. Central venous pressure increased and peripheral resistance decreased. 3 Increasing the halothane concentration of 3% led to marked myocardial depression as evidenced by reduced cardiac output and increased central venous pressure with increasing arterial hypotension. 4 Labetalol may be a suitable drug for controlling induced hypotension under general anaesthesia, although high concentrations of halothane should be used with care.", 
    "15": "1 Labetalol has been used as medical treatment in five patients with phaeochromocytoma. 2 In four of the five patients, blood pressure was satisfactorily controlled, and symptoms and signs were relieved. 3 Labetalol also provided satisfactory cover across surgery for the removal of tumours in two cases. 4 In one instance, it was not possible to give sufficient labetalol orally to suppress the attacks of phaeochromocytoma. This patient was not effectively controlled at operation with a combination of propranolol and phenoxybenzamine. 5 Intravenous labetalol rapidly lowered blood pressure and relieved symptoms in a patient experienced hypertensive crisis after clonidine withdrawal. 6 Labetalol is a useful addition to the medical treatment of phaeochromocytoma.", 
    "16": "1 The acute anti-hypertensive effect of intravenously administered labetalol, a combined alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist, has been assessed in a pilot study involving 17 hypertensive patients. 2 In 11 patients with mild to moderately severe hypertension, there was a decrease in mean arterial pressure (24 mmHg) after a single intravenous dose of 50 mg labetalol. The peak response occurred approximately 4 min after administration of the drug. 3 In six patients with severe hypertension, there was a reduction in mean arterial pressure of 19 mmHg, but this was achieved after a further 50-mg dose administered 30 min after the initial injection. 4 In neither group was there any clinically significant decrease in heart rate, and drug-related side-effects were insignificant. 5 Labetalol reduced the blood pressure when administered intravenously and thus merits further investigation as a treatment for acute hypertensive crises.", 
    "17": "1 Fourteen patients whose lying diastolic blood pressure was persistently 110 mmHg or greater were given labetalol 0.5--1 mg/kg intravenously. 2 The maximum hypotensive effect developed between 20 and 40 min, and on average lasted 3 h. The lying systolic mean blood pressure fell by 30 mmHg and the lying diastolic blood pressure by 17 mmHg (P less than 0.001). 3 This acute hypotensive effect was associated with a significant reduction in the peripheral resistance (P less than 0.02). The hypotension was not associated with significant secondary changes in the stroke volume or pulse rate. 4 The above 14 patients plus 1 additional subject received labetalol orally at a daily dose ranging from 150-2400 mg. The mean lying systolic blood pressure fell by 22 mmHg (P less than0.01) and the mean lying diastolic blood pressure by 26 mmHg (P less than 0.001). The standing values were similar and postural hypotension at this dose did not develop. There was no significant change in the pulse rate. 5 Renal function was monitored by estimates of plasma creatinine and creatinine clearance. Some patients were followed for 2 yr and others for a few months. With the long-term patients, there was no significant reduction in either measurement although in a few patients a slight reduction in creatinine clearance was observed.", 
    "18": "1 Hypertension in West Indians and Africans is common and has an unacceptably high mortality in the younger patients. 2 Fifty-three patients received labetalol (a combined alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist) as part of an open evaluation of its anti-hypertensive effect. Ten non-caucasian patients were included. 3 Significant reductions in systolic and diastolic pressures were obtained in the caucasian patients, the African and West Indian patients remaining refractory to therapy.", 
    "19": "1 The efficacy of labetalol in lowering blood pressure has been assessed in a group of 16 patients with severe hypertension whose blood pressure was inadequately controlled (supine diastolic blood pressure greater than 110 mmHg on two consecutive occasions) on existing therapy or in whom severe side-effects necessitated a change in therapy. 2 All patients had an original pretreatment supine diastolic blood pressure of greater than 120 mmHg and most had evidence of target organ damage. Patients were hospitalized for the purposes of changeover of therapy, labetalol being added to the existing regime which was reduced stepwise and eventually withdrawn. 3 Treatment with labetalol resulted in satisfactory blood pressure control in 10 of 16 patients in this study but high doses were required, the mean daily dose being 3,091 mg (range 1,200-8,000). 4 Treatment with discontinued in 6 patients on account of postural hypotension (3), failure to control supine diastolic blood pressure (2) and retention of urine (1). Long-term treatment was relatively free from side-effects. 5 From preliminary studies in animals it is suggested that an action within the central nervous system may contribute to the hypotensive effect of labetalol.", 
    "20": "1 The toxicity of labetalol has been studied in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs, and reproductive studies have been carried out in rats and rabbits. Nothing was observed in any of these species to suggest that patients taking labetalol might be exposed to any toxic hazard. 2 During the reproductive studies 14C-labetalol was used to study placental transfer. Radioactivity was present in the uveal tract of the foetal eye. 3 Radioactive labetalol but not its metabolites was bound to the melanin pigment of the eye. This binding was reversible. It was not possible to saturate the melanin of the cat and dog eye even with prolonged dosing with labetalol. 4 Chloroquine, given orally at doses of 1.5-6 mg/kg/d for 4-7 weeks, produced changes in the cat retina. When oral doses of 20 mg labetalol/d were given to cats for 7 months, no oculotoxic effects were observed. 5 Detailed ophthalmological and histological examinations were carried out on the rats, rabbits, cats and dogs used in these studies. No changes indicative of oculotoxicity were observed. In the reproductive studies no effects were observed in the developing rat or rabbit eye, which could be consequent on the placental transfer of labetalol or its metabolites.", 
    "21": "1 The disposition and metabolism of labetalol and either 14C- or 3H-labetalol has been studied in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and man. 2 Radiolabelled labetalol was administered orally at doses of 100 mg/kg to the mouse, up to 50 mg/kg to the rat and rabbit, 20 mg/kg to the dog and 200 mg to man. From measurements of the total plasma radioactivity it was shown that labetalol was well absorbed by all the species. When the measurements of plasma radioactivity and labetalol concentrations were compared, it was found labetaol had been extensively metabolized by the first-pass effect in rat, rabbit and man. Metabolism by this route occurred to a lesser extent in the dog. 3 Radiochemical analysis of the tissues from rats, rabbits and dogs showed that the highest concentrations of radioactivity were found in the lung, liver and kidney. Very little radioactivity was present in the brain. Over 99% of the radioactivity was cleared from the tissues by 7 d. When doses of up to 200 mg 14C-labetalol/kg were given to pregnant rats and 50 mg 14C-labetalol/kg to pregnant rabbits, autoradiographic and radiochemical analysis of the full-term foetuses showed that only small amounts of radioactivity were present in the foetus. 4 The mouse excreted 72%, the rate 48%, the rabbit 61%, the dog 66% and man 60% of the oral dose of radioactivity in the urine. Analysis of themouse and rat faeces showed that the remainder of the dose of radioactivity was excreted in the faeces. 5 Radiochemical analysis of the urine and faeces collected from rats and dogs after an intravenous dose of 1 mg 14C- and 3H-labetalol/kg showed that excretion of radioactivity occurred via both the kidney and bile. 6 An intravenous dose of 1 mg 3H-labetalol/kg to dog and 1 mg 'cold' labetalol/kg to man was not as extensively metabolized as a similar oral dose. 7 The percentage of the dose excreted in the urine as unchanged drug was 2% in the rabbit, 11% in the rat, 19% in the dog and up to 5% in man. The O-phenyl glucuronide was the major metabolite present in the mouse, rat, and rabbit urine. Dog and man also formed this metabolite, but to a lesser extent. A second glucuronide was the major metabolite present in dog urine. This was probably formed through conjugation of glucuronic acid was the secondary alcohol group of labetalol. The major metabolite present in human urine was an unidentified conjugate of labetalol. Minor metabolites of labetalol present in rat, rabbit and dog urine were hydroxylabetalol and its glucuronyl conjugate.", 
    "22": "Seventeen patients with hypertropic obstructive cardiomyopathy, were studied using non-invasive techniques before and after the intravenous injection of 5 mg propranolol. The folloeing were analysed: left ventricular ejection time index, derived from the carotid pulse and heart rate; the isovolumic relaxation time, derived from the apex cardiogram and phonocardiogram; the diastolic closure rate of the mirtal valve; and the left ventricular diameters, systolic and diastolic, both measured by echocardiography. Propranolol produced shortening of the isovolumic relaxation time, increase in both the diastolic closure rate of the mitral valve and left ventricular systolic and left ventricular diastolic diameters. These results show that propranolol increases the rate of filling and the volume of the left ventricle, indicating that an improvement in distensibility is produced by beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "23": "The response of the rabbit utero-ovarian ligament to catecholamines has been studied in vitro, with contractile activity being recorded isometrically from whole rabbit ligaments obtained under various hormonal conditions. Both the catecholamines norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EPI) produced dose-dependent (10(-2) mug/ml threshold; 10(2) mug/ml maximum) tetanic contractions of rabbit ligament. There was no difference (P less than 0.05) between estrous and ovulatory ligaments either in terms of the dose-response curves or maximal force of contraction. Both agonists were 100% antagonized by the alpha-blockers, phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine. The beta-agonist, isoproterenol, had little effect on ligament tonus but did inhibit spontaneous activity and attenuated the response to both NE and EPI. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, slightly (less than 10%) potentiated the stimulatory effects of NE and EPI. It is concluded that the utero-ovarian ligament of the rabbit contains predominately alpha-stimulatory and possibly weak beta-inhibitory receptors analogous to receptors in ovarian and oviductal smooth muscles.", 
    "24": "Intraventricular infusion of small doses of isoprenaline (ISO) in conscious non-hydrated goats produced a significant diuretic response, as well as a decrease in the excretion rate of Na+, K+ and Cl- in the urine; these effects were dose-dependent. An increase in free water clearance was observed as well. Pretreatment with propranolol, injected into the 3rd ventricle, completely abolished the ISO-induced diuretic effects, whereas phentolamine was ineffective. The data suggest that hypothalamic beta-adrenoreceptors are concerned with an inhibition of vasopressin release, inducing a diuretic response.", 
    "25": "The effect of intraseptal injection of carbachol and nicotine on urinary output of Na+ and K+ in untreated rats as well as in animals pretreated with locally injected atropine, hexamethonium, dibenamine and propranolol was studied in order to evaluate the relative role played by central muscarinic and nicotinic receptors in the regulation of salt and water renal excretion. The injection of 30-250 nmol of nicotine into the medial septal area caused a dose-dependent increase in Na+ and K+ urinary output whereas urine volume was little affected. The effect of 30 nmol of nicotine was blocked by pretreatment with 100 nmol of hexamethonium. In addition, pretreatment with 5 nmol of either hexamethonium or atropine partially antagonized the natriuretic and kaliuretic effect of 1 nmol of carbachol. Also the alpha-blocking agent, dibenamine (150 nmol) antagonized, while the beta-blocker, propranolol (100 nmol) significantly enhanced the effect of carbachol. Propranolol (100 nmol) alone caused a small, but significant increase in Na+ and K+ renal excretion. These results indicate that stimulation of both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors in the septal area, as caused by carbachol, elicits increased disposition of Na+ and K+ by the kidneys. Also, part of the effects of carbachol appear to be mediated by the release of endogenous catecholamines, acting on central alpha receptors to increase Na+ and K+ urinary excretion. On the other hand, simultaneous activation of beta-receptors by the released amines would partially inhibit this effect.", 
    "26": "The possible role of the adrenergic nervous system in the intoxicant effects of ethanol was examined in studies of the interaction or propranolol and phentolamine with ethanol. Propranolol teneded to increase the effect of lower doses of ethanol in a dose-dependent manner. However, the effect of higher doses of ethanol (over 2.0 g/kg) tended to be diminished by low doses of propranolol, whereas higher doses of propranolol were ineffective or actually increased the ethanol effect. Phentolamine tended to decrease the effect of the lower ethanol doses. These findings are inconsistent with any simple adrenergic mechanism in the mediation of the intoxicant effect of ethanol.", 
    "27": "Static lung compliance and airway resistance were measured in 30 experiments on 6 healthy subjects after intravenous injection of a bolus of histamine (4 mug per kg of body weight). Analysis of the pooled results showed a significant decrease in static lung compliance (maximal mean decrease,--16 per cent occurring 20 sec after injection). There was no significant change in functional residual capacity or vital capacity after injection of the histamine. Administration of propranolol (a beta-adrenergic blocking agent) did not significantly enhance the responses to histamine. The results suggested that humans, like other species, can constrict peripheral airways sufficiently to produce alterations in the static elastic properties of the lungs.", 
    "28": "The task of this study was to examine the feasibility of applying echocardiography in determining alterations of left ventricular performance during administration of vasoactive drugs. Patients suffering from congestive heart failure were treated with Digitalis, other patients with normal hearts were subjected to infusion therapy of Isoproterenol, Propranolol, Verapamil and Calcium chloride. A new concept for interpretation of function curves relating the velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (VCF) and time was introduced to establish the inotropic, bathmotropic and chronotropic effects of vasoactive drugs to the myocardium. It can be concluded that echocardiography is a feasible tool in determining changes of left ventricular dynamics during administration of vasoactive drugs, in indicating the individual dosage of a vasoactive drug in each patient and the follow-up the course of the therapeutic success.", 
    "29": "Dual effects of aspirin were demonstrated in guinea-pig lungs: (a) aspirin (3.3 mg/kg i.v.) antagonized bronchoconstriction induced by slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A); (b) aspirin produced bronchoconstriction when injected in the presence of propranolol into guinea-pigs in vivo at 330 mg/kg, or into guinea-pig isolated lungs in vitro as a 4% solution (40 mg/ml). 2 The severity of bronchoconstriction following administration of aspirin was directly related to the degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade and to the age of the guinea-pigs. Aspirin-induced bronchoconstriction was prevented in vivo and in vitro by atropine and it could be reversed in vivo by atropine. Aspirin-induced bronchoconstriction was not inhibited by vagotomy or phenoxybenzamine. 3 These data suggest that the mechanism involved in aspirin-induced bronchoconstriction may be local cholinergic stimulation and that reduced beta-adrenergic drive may be a predisposing factor.", 
    "30": "The influence of brain norepinephrine on cerebral metabolism and blood flow was examined because exogenous norepinephrine, administered in a way that the blood-brain barrier is bypassed, has been shown to effect pronounced changes in the cerebral circulation. Reserpine (40 mug/kg, by intracarotid infusion) was administered in order to release brain norepinephrine in five anesthetized baboons. Reserpine significantly increased cerebral oxygen consumption (23%) and cerebral blood flow (50%). This response lasted for approximately 60 min. In a further five animals, effects of central beta-adrenoreceptor blockade were studied. Pro pranolol (12 mug/kg-min) produced an immediate, significant reduction in both cerebral oxygen consumption (40%) and cerebral glucose uptake (39%). Cerebral blood flow was reduced minimally. However, the responsiveness of the cerebral circulation to induced hypercapnia was severely attenuated from a gradient of 3.22 before, to 1,11 after, administration. These experiments suggest that central norepinephrine can influence the cerebral circulation primarily through noradrenergic effects on brain metabolism.", 
    "31": "To determine the interrelationships between ejecting and isovolumic force-length relations and the extent to which the left ventricle will shorten, data obtained in 27 isolated, servo-regulated hearts were examined. For each heart a series of contractions, variably loaded (delta L) were derived for a thickwalled sphere and normalized by the cross-sectional area of muscle and length at zero end-diastolic pressure. It was found that within the physiological range examined total and active force were essentially a linear function of initial L with respective increments or reductions in slope produced by positive or negative shifts in contractile state. The force-L relations obtained isovolumically and at end ejection were virtually identical. For a given ejection pressure, end-systolic L was constant, despite variations in filling and therefore independent of initial L and deltaL; moreover, the L to which the ventricle shortened was determined by the course of the systolic force L-relation. Thus, irrespective of loading, delta L occurs within the confines of the contractile state-dependent isovolumic force-L relation and where the latter is equivalent to the end-systolic force-length relation.", 
    "32": "A perfusion method was designed in order to investigate that effects of stimulation of the splanchnic and lumbar colonic nerves on the ileocecal sphincter (ICS) of the cat. Splanchnic and lumbar colonic nerve stimulation at physiological frequencies, i.e., below 10-12 impulses/s, elicited a contraction of the sphincter concomitant with an inhibition of the motility of the adjacent parts of the small and large intestines. It is concluded that the splanchinc and lumbar colonic nerves contract the ICS by a direct effect on the sphincter and not via a contraction of the intestine surrounding the sphincter. Guanethidine and phenoxybenzamine but not propranolol blocked the contraction of the ICS. It is suggested that the splanchnic and lumbar colonic nerves control the sphincter via an alpha-adrenergic mechanism. Inhibitory fibers within the splanchnic or lumbar colonic nerves to the ICS were not found. The excitatory in the ICS elicited by adrenaline, nor-adrenaline, or phyenylephrine infusion was completely blocked by phenoxybenzamine. Propranolol did not block the effect on ICS of these drugs. On the contrary, an augmented response could be shown, indicating unmasking of an excitatory alpha-receptor response by blockade of inhibitory beta-receptors. Further support for these inhibitory beta-receptors was provided by the finding that isoprenaline had a relaxing effect on the sphincteric muscle, an effect that was blocked by propranolol. In order to block the inhibitory effect on the small and large intestine elicited by splanchnic and lumbar colonic nerve stimulation, both phenoxybenzamine and propranolol had to be administered.", 
    "33": "Insulin resistance and the ability of insulin to inhibit hepatic glucose production and to increas efficiency of glucose uptake were determined in 24 nonobese individuals: eight subjects with normal oral glucose tolerance, eight patients with chemical diabetes, and eight nonketotic patients with fasting hyperglycemia (greater than 150 mg. per cent). Insulin resistance was estimated by measuring the steady-state plasma glucose response to a continuous infusion of insulin, glucose, epinephrine, and propranolol. This approach permits us to inhibit levels of exogenous insulin, and use the height of the steady-state plasma glucose response as a direct estimate of insulin resistance. The ability of insulin to inhibit hepatic glucose production and to increase efficiency of glucose uptake was calculated from the results of two studies in which a continuous infusion of 3H-2-glucose was used to measure glucose turnover rate. The first study was performed after an overnight fast, under conditions of basal insulin levels, while the second was conducted during the infusion of insulin, glucose, epinephrine, and propranolol. Hepatic glucose production is equal to glucose turnover rate during the basal study and is equal to glucose turnover rate minus the infusion rate of cold glucose during the second study. Glucose uptake in both studies is equal to glucose turnover rate minus urinary glucose loss, and the efficiency of glucose uptake is calculated by dividing glucose uptake by the plasma glucose pool size. The mean (+/- S.E.) steady-state plasma glucose response was 113 +/- 9 mg. per cent in normal subjects, 205 +/- 14 mg. per cent in chemical diabetics, and 346 +/- 30 mg. per cent in patients with fasting hyperglycemia. Thus, insulin resistance exists in monoketotic diabetes, and the greater the degree of glucose intolerance, the greater the insulin resistance. The resistance to the insulin infusion in patients with chemical diabetes seemed to be mainly a function of the inability of insulin to increase efficiency of glucose uptake, since insulin did retain its ability to inhibit glucose production (although not to normal levels). In contrast, the infusion of insulin neither inhibited hepatic glucose production nor increased efficienty of glucose uptake in patients with fasting hyperglycemia. Thus, the insulin resistance that exists in patients with nonketotic diabetes cannot be considered to be a global phenomenon. Significant differences exist in the responsiveness of various tissues to the two general aspects of insulin's action on glucose homeostasis, and these differences provide a physiologic basis for the variations in degree of over-all insulin resistance that are present in the three groups of subjects.", 
    "34": "The vascular response to intraluminally and extraluminally administered catecholamines mixed in combination with local anaesthetics has been studied using the isolated perfused rabbit ear artery as the model system. Potentiation of the vascular response to extraluminal adrenaline was observed when prilocaine, lignocaine or cocaine were combined in low concentrations with the vasoconstrictor. No potentiation of the vascular response to extraluminally administered noradrenaline could be demonstrated in the presence of prilocaine or lignocaine. Further, no potentiation to either catecholamine was found if the artery had been denervated or the drugs were applied intraluminally. Possible mechanisms for the potentiation of extraluminally applied adrenaline are discussed.", 
    "35": "Injection of frogs with beta-adrenergic catecholamines produced a selective desensitization (loss of responsiveness) of the erythrocyte membrane adenylate cylase to subsequent stimulation in vitro by isoproterenol. Basal, prostaglandin E1- and fluoride-sensitive enzyme activities were unaffected. A 77% (p less than 0.001) decline in isoproterenol-responsive enzyme activity in the cells from the treated animals was observed with no change in the Km for isoproterenol stimulation of the enzyme (concentration causing 1/2 maximal enzyme activation). The decrease in catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase was accompanied by a parallel 68% (p less than 0.001) fall in the apparent number of beta-adrenergic receptors in the erythrocyte membranes, assessed by (-) (3H)alprenolol binding studies. There was no change in the affinity of the receptor binding sites. The catecholamine-induced desensitization and fall in the beta-adrenergic receptor number were both concentration and time-dependent and displayed beta-adrenergic specificity. Isoproterenol was more potent in desensitizing cells and in lowering the receptor number than was norepinephrine. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, but not the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine, blocked the desensitizing effects of isoproterenol. Propranolol itself, however, did not cause desensitization. Cells became resensitized to the stimulatory effects of catecholamines, in association with a return in beta-receptor number, when propranolol was injected into previously desensitized animals. The changes in receptor number in membranes from desensitized and resensitized animals were also reflected in soluble receptor preparations. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not affect either desensitization, resensitization, or the changes in receptor number which accompanied the changes in adenylate cyclase sensitivity to catecholamines. These findings suggest that the chronic occupancy of beta-adrenergic receptors by beta-adrenergic agonists (but not antagonists) decreases the number of functional beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites and, hence, lowers the responsiveness of adenylate cylase to catecholamine stimulation. The lack of effort of cycloheximide on these regulatory effects suggests that \"inactivation\" and subsequent \"reactivation\" of the receptors, rather than changes in receptor turnover, are involved.", 
    "36": "Patient-controlled rapid atrial pacing was used to manage 12 cases of recurrent supraventricular tachycardia refractory to drug therapy. The pacing system consists of an implanted receiver-lead system and an external patient-activated transmitter. In each case, brief periods (5 to 20 seconds) of rapid atrial pacing were effective in terminating the supraventricular tachycardia and resulted in a return to normal sinus rhythm. In three patients, occasional transient episodes of atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation preceded a spontaneous return to normal sinus rhythm. The pacing system was removed in one patient 13 months postoperatively because of persistent pericarditis; one patient died of an unrelated cerebral hemorrhage 13 months postoperatively. Successful management of supraventricular tachycardia has been maintained in the 10 remaining patients for 15 to 36 months (average 26.4). In more than 6,000 patient applications of rapid atrial pacing, there has been only one failure to convert the tachycardia. Successful application of permanent rapid atrial pacing requires (1) prescreening of patients with temporary external rapid atrial pacing to verify susceptibility to conversion of supraventricular tachycardia and absence of anomalous conduction pathways that may permit conduction of rapid pacing rates to the ventricles, and (2) assessment of the patient's ability to use the transmitter properly.", 
    "37": "The nurse has assumed more responsibility for patients with hypertension, not only in their education, but also in their follow-up. In this study the physician was aware of each patient's progress through conference with the nurse clinician. In addition, the nurse clinician consulted the physician about any problems or questions that arose. The nurse also served an educational role by informing patients about their disease and the side effects of the medications being used in their therapy. Since the physician was aware of the progress of these patients, his time was freed for other purposes. The nurse clinician's role in the management of hypertension was beneficial not only to the patient, but also to the physician.", 
    "38": "Acute coronary artery syndromes, including unstable angina and myocardial infarction, have been desribed after the abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents. One possible mechanism is a hyperinotropic state resulting from a rebound hypersensitivity to endogenous catecholamines. Propranolol hydrochloride was administered to 21 healthy subjects for 15 days. Systolic time intervals and 24-hour urinary excretion of vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) were measured serially before, during, and after administration. Serial serum propranolol levels were measured during and after administration. Inhibition of exercise-induced tachycardia by propranolol was established before and during drug administration.", 
    "39": "The present investigation was designed to determine the effect of propranolol on regional myocardial blood flow and oxygen consumption (MVO2) in the isolated supported dog heart preparation perfused at a constant coronary blood flow. The transmural distribution of blood flow, determined by the radioactive microsphere technique, was expressed as the epicardial/endocardial blood flow ratio (epi/endo). Propranolol (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) produced a significant decrease in heart rate and myocardial contractile force and an increase in coronary artery perfusion pressure due to an increase in coronary vascular resistance. These hemodynamic changes were accompanied by significant decreases in epi/endo (increased endocardial perfusion) and MVO2. Reduction of perfusion pressure to control by a decrease in total coronary blood flow produced no further change in epi/endo or MVO2. However, increasing heart rate to control increased epi/endo to predrug levels. Contractile force and MVO2 remained reduced below control. Norepinephrine infusion (1 mug/min intracoronary) produced a significant increase in heart rate and contractile force and decrease in perfusion pressure. These changes were accompanied by an increase in epi/endo and MVO2. Propranolol (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) abolished the response to norepinephrine. Propranolol may produce beneficial effects in angina pectoris by a decrease in epi/endo (via a reduction in heart rate) and MVO2 and by beta adrenergic blockade of the deleterious effects of catecholamines.", 
    "40": "The effects of phenoxybenzamine HCl and propranolol HCl, 2 mg/kg, on tissue oxygen tension (PO2), perfusion and small vessel blood content of the cerebral cortex and biceps brachii muscle of anesthetized rats were determined. Perfusion and PO2 were measured polarographically and small vessel blood content was measured with 59Fe-siderophilin-labeled blood. Under control conditions PO2, perfusion and small vessel blood content averaged 15.1 mm Hg., 15.6 ml/min/100 g and 0.91 ml/100 g in brain and 15.6 mm Hg, 13.1 ml/min/100 g and 1.63 ml/100 g in muscle. After phenoxybenzamine adminstration, there was a significant increase in muscle perfusion (17.4%) and decrease in cortical PO2 (9.2%). No other factors changed significantly. Propranolol caused no significant changes in any of the above factors. Arteriolar resistance in skeletal muscle decreased after phenoxybenzamine. Small vessel blood content measurements (an estimate of open capillary density) indicate no effects on precapillary sphincters with either agent. Since some changes in metabolism were indicated with these agents, regional oxygen consumption was calculated from this data.", 
    "41": "The effects of plasma drug binding on the relationship between propranolol concentration and the antagonism of isoproterenol tachycardia have been investigated in 8 normal subjects and 8 hypertensive patients. During chronic intravenous infusion of propranolol giving a narrow range of total plasma concentrations (22.5 to 50 ng/ml), there was, at best, a poor correlation with effects. On the other hand, there was excellent correlation between efficacy and free drug concentration, which fitted the predictions of the receptor theory of competitive antagonism. The true affinity constant for the binding of propranolol to its receptor can be calculated in terms of free drug concentration (KAfree) and was found to vary 2-fold compared to the affinity constant in terms of total plasma concentration (KAtotal) which varied 4-fold, the greater variation being due to plasma binding differences. Compared to normal subjects, KAfree and KAtotal were smaller in hypertensive subjects, implying lesser sensitivity to the drug, and plasma propranolol binding was greater. There was no difference in KAfree between high- and low-renin essential hypertensives, but KAtotal was smaller in the high-renin group due to increased plasma binding which did not reach statistical significance. It is concluded that the effect of propranolol on heart rate is a predictable function of free drug concentration in man and that the contribution of individual variation in receptor sensitivity to differences in oral dosage requirement is minor compared to that of variations in bioavailability.", 
    "42": "The time course and mechanism of vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation (VF) a 10-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and following its release were studied in 48 dogs. VF threshold was determined by inducing a sequence of three extrasystoles (sequential R/T pulsing). Within 1 minute of occlusion, the fibrillation current decreased to the level required for eliciting a propagated diastolic response. This state of enhanced vulnerability lasted for approximately 6 minutes, after which the VF threshold returned to preocclusion values. The vulnerability changes upon reperfusion, by comparison, occurred within seconds of release and persisted only transiently. Three minutes of occlusion was the minimal time which resulted in a reduction in VF threshold after release. Alpha and beta-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine and propranolol, respectively, prevented the decrease in VF threshold during occlusion but were without effect upon threshold changes during coronary artery release. Lidocaine failed to alter the pattern of vulnerability. It is concluded that adrenergic mechanisms play a key role in the increased susceptibility to VF associated with acute myocardial ischemia, whereas the changes in VF threshold following reperfusion may be due to washout products of cellular ischemia. These findings support the view that protection against VF during coronary artery occlusion and release may require different antiarrhythmic measures.", 
    "43": "The role of sodium concentration, of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, and of a microtubular inhibtor (vincristine) on renin release was studied in rat kidney slices in vitro. Renin release was an active, linear, and temperature-dependent process. Kidneys from young rats released much more renin than those from adults. Lowering sodium concentration inhibited renin release by one-half, even when osmolality was kept constant. Isoproterenol (10(-8) to 10(-5) M) stimulated renin release significantly in a partially dose-related manner. dl-propranolol inhibited this stimulation. Significant (P less than 0.05) inhibition of renin release was induced by l-epinephrine or l-norepinephrine (10(-5) M). In the presence of an alpha-receptor blocking drug, phenoxybenzamine (10(-5) M), inhibition no longer occurred with epinephrine and stimulation was observed with l-norepinephrine. Vincristine (10(-5) M) did not affect renin release when slices from the kidneys of normal rats or adrenalectomized, sodium-depleted rats were incubated, but significantly inhibited (P less than 0.01) release that had been stimulated in vitro by isoproterenol. These results suggest to us that there may be (1) a direct or indirect (mediated through the macula densa) effect of sodium on juxtaglomerular cells, (2) an inhibitory role for alpha-adrenergic receptors on renin release, in addition to the stimulatory role of beta-receptors, (3) possible participation of microtubules in isoproterenol-stimulated renin release, and (4) an alternative mode of secretion of renin under stimulation by adrenalectomy and salt depletion.", 
    "44": "Angiotensin II (A II) and analogues were tested for their ability to restore electrical and mechanical activity to cardiac muscle preparations in which the fast Na+ channels had been inactivated by partial depolarization (22-27 mM K+) or by tetrodotoxin (TTX). The partially depolarized or TTX-blocked preparations were chosen because under these conditions electrical and mechanical responses are primarily Ca2+ -dependent. In depolarized rabbit right atria, A II restored spontaneous mechanical and electrical activity (measured by both intracellular and extracellular recording techniques). The frequency of action potential discharge was concentration-dependent; the threshold concentration of A II was 10(-10) M, the ED50 was 8 X 10(-9) M, and the maximum effect was observed at 5 X 10(-8) M. In contrast, depolarized guinea pig atria were insensitive to A II, Sar1-angiotensin II, and des-Asp1-angiotensin II, even at concentrations as high as 10(-5) M. Rabbit papillary muscle (TTX-blocked), embryonic (18-day) chick heart (partially depolarized) and chick heart reaggregates (TTX-blocked) responded similarly to rabbit atria in that A II (9.6 X 10(-7) M) restored both electrical and mechanical activity. We found that in these preparations the action of A II was unaffected by propranolol (5.0 X 10(-6) M to 5.0 X 10(-5) M) but was blocked by Mn2+ (10(-3) M), D-600 (1 X 10(-7) g/ml) and the specific A II antagonists Sar1-Ala8-angiotensin II (P-113) (5.0 X 10(-5) M) and Sar1-Ile8-angiotensin II (5.28 X 10(-5) M). We conclude that the positive inotropic effect of A II on the myocardium is due to its ability to increase transmembrane ion movements in or through the cell membrane. The ability of Mn2+ and D-600 to block this effect suggests that this ion movement is via the so-called \"slow channels.\"", 
    "45": "Spontaneous mechanical activity can be produced in depolarized frog ventricle by bathing the tissue in a solution with low Na, Iow Ca, and high K+. The contractions can be inhibited by depleting the tissue of Ca first, but they are relatively insensitive to changes in either extracellular [Ca++] or [Ca++]/[Na+]2. They are terminated very rapidly by raising [Na+] to 40 mM. Local anesthetics enhance the spontaneous activity in proportion to the concentration of their free base form. These contractions occur relatively rhythmically for several hours. Since the preparation is multicellular, this suggests a mechanism for intercellular communication without change in membrane potential.", 
    "46": "Plasma renin activity (PRA), supine, erect and post-frusemide (1 mg/kg IV) was studied in 51 patients with previously untreated essential hypertension and their age- and sex-matched normotensive controls. Supine PRA, and the rise in PRA in response to the erect posture and frusemide, were significantly less in hypertensives compared to controls. When the hypertensives were arbitrarily divided into lower, mid, and upper subgroups according to supine PRA, the renin responsiveness was similar in each subgroup but significantly less in hypertensives compared to controls, subdivided in the same way. This does not support the existence of a separate \"low renin\" subgroup. The low supine PRA and reduced response to stimulation appears to be a feature of patients with essential hypertension. Thirty-nine of these hypertensives entered a double-blind cross-over drug trial of oxprenolol, methyldopa and spironolactone. All three drugs were equally effective in lowering the systolic and diastolic blood pressures in all three renin subgroups. Spironolactone caused a greater fall in systolic pressure in the lower renin group than in the other groups. Oxprenolol was the best tolerated drug, with only 5% of patients withdrawing due to side-effects compared to 13% on spironolacone and 29% on methyldopa.", 
    "47": "1 The actions of labetalol 1.0-2.0 mg/kg intravenously on blood pressure, heart rate, plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone concentrations have been studied in 20 recumbent hypertensive patients. 2 In all subjects there was a reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures within 5 min of completion of injection. 3 Severe hypotension was not seen but three patients who had a marked fall in blood pressure experienced side-effects. Postural hypotension was common at the end of the study. 4 Labetalol caused significant reduction in heart rate. 5 Labetalol induced significant lowering of plasma angiotensin II and in plasma aldosterone concentrations, which were most obvious when these were increased initially; overall there was a close correlation between concurrent measurements of angiotensin II and aldosterone concentrations. 6 In five patients a comparison was made against propranolol 10 mg intravenously. Labetalol was more effective in lowering blood pressure but less effective in reducing pulse rate of plasma angiotensin II concentration.", 
    "48": "1 The interaction of phentolamine with the beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking drug, oxprenolol, was studied in a controlled trial. 2 The combination was generally well tolerated. 3 Oxprenolol alone produced modest but significant reductions in supine, standing and post-exercise blood pressures. Small reductions were observed only with sustained phentolamine administration. 4 The combined effect of the two drugs seemed to be addictive only at the lower level of oxyprenolol dosage. 5 Labetalol produced significantly greater reductions in supine and standing blood pressure than combined oxprenolol-phentolamine. At a daily dose of 400 mg, postural hypotension was not observed, although transient symptoms were frequent.", 
    "49": "1 Labetalol, a new hypotensive drug combining alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist properties, has been compared with propranolol in the treatment of severe hypertension (blood pressure 190/115-249/139 mmHg) in a double-blind trial lasting 14 weeks. Additional diuretic therapy was given to both groups of patients. 2 Both drugs caused an effective reduction in blood pressure, bbut labetalol caused a greater fall in pressure in the standing position and after exercise. Two groups of nine patients have each completed the trial so far. Group average pressures for the last 3 weeks of treatment were: for labetalol 137/87 supine, 121/84 standing, and 117/78 mmHg after exercise; and for propranolol, 138/87 supine, 132/93 standing, and 133/94 mmHg after exercise. 3 Group average heart rates were lower in all three positions for those patients treated with propranolol compared with labetalol. 4 The average final dose ratio for labetalol: propranolol was 1.44:1 (w/w). 5 Labetalol initially induced a number of side-effects, predominantly related to alpha-adrenoreceptor blockade, which disappeared by the end of the trial. 6 Labetalol, in conjunction with diuretic therapy, was at least as effective as propranolol in lowering blood pressure in patients with severe hypertension.", 
    "50": "1 The effect of labetalol has been assessed in an open clinical trial in 19 patients with sub-optimal control of blood pressure on other therapy, and in a placebo-controlled cross-over study. Most patients were taking a diuretic before the trial and they continued to do so during the trial. 2 In the open trial, labetalol successfully lowered blood pressure in most of the patients. Average daily dose was about 600 mg. The placebo-controlled trial confrimed the anti-hypertensive effect. 3 A clear postural hypotensive effect was seen. A few patients noted postural faintness as a side-effect, especially in a hot environment; but it was not troublesome. 4 There were few other side-effects. One patient experienced an increase in serum glumatic--oxalic transaminase (SGOT) and another an increasing anti-nuclear factor titre, but it is not yet certain that these were due to labetalol.", 
    "51": "1 A new anti-hypertensive agent (labetalol) with alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking properties has been assessed in 30 patients in a general practice. 2 Significant reduction in blood pressure and pulse rate occurred at a dose of 400 mg/d. A further significant reduction in blood pressure but not of pulse rate occurred at a dose of 800 mg/d. 3 After 4 weeks' treatment on the higher dose the mean fall in systolic and diastolic pressures compared with the pre-trial pressures was 36 and 24 mmHg, respectively. Side-effects were generally mild.", 
    "52": "1 The haemodynamic effects of labetalol have been studied in 11 hypertensive patients after 1 month of oral administration at a fixed dose of 800 mg/d. 2 Heart rate blood pressure and cardiac output were measured at rest and at two levels of exercise. 3 Labetalol significantly reduced heart rate and blood pressure at rest and after exercise but cardiac output remained unchanged. 4 The results suggest that labetalol is an effective anti-hypertensive agent acting by competitive adrenoreceptor blockade.", 
    "53": "Toxin from the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus was used to release norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve endings in the perfused rat pancrease. Addition of toxin, 10 mug./ml., to perfusate containing 0.3 mg./ml. glucose caused a large increase in release of norepinephrine and glucagon. Glucagon secretion was suppressed by perfusate containing 3.0 mg./ml. glucose but still responded to stimulation with scorpion toxin. Atropine, 10 muM, had no effect on either norepinephrine or glucagon release in response to scorpion toxin. The release of glucagon was blocked by 100 muM propranolol, 10 muM phentolamine, or 30 muM phenoxybenzamine. Somatostatin, 55nM, did not affect the release of norepinephrine by scorpion toxin but totally inhibited the glucagon response. These results suggest that pharmacologic stimulation of the adrenergic nerve endings in the rat pancreas can elicit a rapid release of glucagon. This response can be prevented by appropriate concentrations of either alpha or beta adrenergic blocking agents or somatostatin.", 
    "54": "The antihypertensive effects of the beta blockers oxprenolol and propranolol were compared in a randomized double-blind study of patients with standing diastolic pressures (SDP) exceeding 99 mm Hg when receiving hydrochlorothiazide alone. After 3 wk of hydrochlorthiazide with placebo, the latter was replaced with oxprenolol (n= 12) or propranolol (n = 14), 20 mg three times daily. Beta blocker was increased subsequently to 40 and 80 mg three times daily if SDP exceeded 89 mm Hg. Nine oxprenolol and 7 propranolol subjects were hospitalized for 24-hr monitoring. With oxprenolol, standing pressure declined from 135 +/- 2 (SE)/104 +/- 1 MM Hg to 128 +/- 3/90 +/- 2. SDP declined to under 91 mm Hg in 7 of 12 subjects, and to from 91 to 95 in 3 subjects. With propranolol, findings were 138 +/- 3/106 +/- 2 to 123 +/- 3/89 +/- 3; in 7 of 12 to less than 91 mm Hg and from 91 to 95 in 4 subjects. Decrements in supine and SDP were slightly (4 mm Hg) greater for propranolol than for oxprenolol. Both drugs gave similar 24-hr blood pressure control. We conclude that oxprenolol and propranolol used to supplement hydrochlorothiazide provide comparable reductions in blood pressure and smooth control over a 24-hr period in most patients with hypertension.", 
    "55": "The effects of various concentrations of biogenic amines on the formation of adenosine-3', 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and their interactions with other thyroid stimulators were investigated in human thyroid slices from normal and Graves' disease. Most of biogenic amines were found to have the stimulatory effects to some extent. Among the biogenic amines tested, histamine was the most potent thyroid stimulator, norepinephrine and serotonin, the intermediate in terms of cyclic AMP formation. The effect of histamine was almost as potent as TSH in thyroid slices from Graves' disease. This stimulatory effect of histamine was blocked by metiamide, a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, but not by chlorpheniramine, a histamine H1-receptor antagonist. The effect of norepinephrine was completely inhibitied by propranolol, but not by phentolamine. Polyphloretin phosphate did not inhibit norepinephrine- or histamine-induced cyclic AMP formation, while it significantly depressed cyclic AMP formation induced by prostaglandin E2. The maximal effect of histamine was additive to that of TSH. It is suggested that biogenic amines, histamine and norepinephrine, in particular, have the thyroid receptors different from that of TSH or prostaglandin E2 and could play an important role in thyroid physiology.", 
    "56": "Functional significance of alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors for the mechanism of catecholamines effect on sodium reabsorption and oxygen tension in the rat kidney, was studied. Adrenaline inhibited sodium excretion decreasing its filtration in glomeruli and stimulating its reabsorption in tubules. The oxygen tension in these conditions did not change in the renal cortex while oxygenation of the external cortical layer was significantly increased. The blocking agent for alpha-adrenoreceptors phentolamin abolished the inhibiting effect of adrenaline on the glomerular filtration and somewhat decreased the degree of oxygen tension growth in the external cortical layer, leaving the tubular effect unaltered. The blocking agent for beta-adrenoreceptors inderal did not affect the inhibitory action of adrenaline on the glomerular filtration but completely prevented its activating effect on the tubular reabsorption of sodium and on oxygenation of the external cortical layer. A conclusion was drawn that catecholamines stimulation of sodium reabsorption in the rat kidney follows excitation of beta-adrenoreceptors. The increase in oxygen tension in the external cortical layer under effect of catecholamines is supposed to improve energetic supply of the sodium active transport in the ascending portion of the Henle loops.", 
    "57": "Calcium chloride injected into isolated perfused rat hearts produced a positive inotropic effect and increased the levels of phosphorylase a (EC 2.4.1.1). The increase in enzyme activity lagged behind the inotropic effect. Pretreatment of animals with thyroid hormone enhanced the ability of noradrenaline to activate phosphorylase but did not affect the inotropic or phosphorylase activating effect of calcium. Thyroid hormone pretreatment did enhance the chronotropic effect of calcium. Calcium did not affect the cardiac levels of cyclic AMP. It is concluded that calcium can activate phosphorylase by a mechanism other than cyclic AMP and that the enhancement of adrenergic amine-induced phosphorylase activation by thyroid hormone is not a calcium mediated event.", 
    "58": "The sensitivity of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, and the antilipolytic actions of prostaglandin E1 or insulin on adipose tissue of obese diabetic and non-diabetic subjects have been studied. Accumulation of cyclic AMP in adipose tissue and release of glycerol in response to several catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline and isoprenaline) in the presence or absence of an alpha-adrenergic blocker (phentolamine) have been used to assess catecholamine receptor sensitivity. No differences in beta-receptor activity were observed between diabetics and non-diabetics, either on glycerol release or accumulation of cyclic AMP; alpha-receptor activity was also similar, except for significantly less accumulation of cyclic AMP in diabetic tissue incubated with noradrenaline and phentolamine (p less than 0.01). The antilipolytic action of prostaglandin E1 (at concentrations of 30 fM to 30 pM) on lipolysis (stimulated submaximally with isoprenaline, 10(-7) M) was similar in diabetic and control groups. The antilipolytic action of insulin (from 10(-10) to 10(-6) M) on lipolysis was also similar between the groups. It is concluded that neither disorders of the catecholamine receptor nor of the antiliolytic actions of prostaglandin E1 or insulin are responsible for the abnormalities of fatty acid metabolism in adult diabetes.", 
    "59": "Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation and cation transport were measured in duck erythrocytes after stimulation by norepinephrine (NE) or shrinkage induced by exposure to hypertonic media (S). Previously both NE and S were shown to initiate a similar transport process in this cell. NE elicited a rapid rise in cellular cAMP and 42K influx. Both effects were eliminated by propranolol. At concentrations of NE below 3 X 10(-8) M (the concentration at which 42K influx saturates), there was good correlation between the magnitude of the permeability change and the increment in cAMP. In contrast, medium hypertonicity, at a level which stimulated K influx to the same extent as a near-maximal norepinephrine response, did not alter cAMP content. The data are discussed in terms of a model in which S and NE activate a final common transport pathway by different mechanisms, which in the case of S does not involve cAMP.", 
    "60": "Control of the levels of cAMP in the early phase after addition of catecholamines and the effect of insulin is discussed under consideration of own findings from experiments with isolated fat cells of the rat. Data on the kinetics of cAMP are interpreted in the light of results from several groups of a rapid activation of phosphodiesterase activity along with the adenylate cyclase system. Comparison of energy metabolism of fat cells with the formation of cAMP under conditions of near-maximal activation of the adenylate cyclase system by isoproterenol shows that about half of the cellular ATP turnover is used for information transfer. Insulin reduces cAMP concentrations in the presence of isoproterenol within one min of incubation when added either together with or after the catecholamine. Experiments with propranolol and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, methyl isobutylxanthine suggest an effect of insulin on formation and breakdown of cAMP.", 
    "61": "Carbachol increased amylase release and K+ efflux from rat parotid tissue slices. The amount of amylase released was small compared to that released by isoproterenol. The effect of carbachol on amylase release and K+ efflux was a direct effect. This conclusion was based on the finding that the stimulatory effects of carbachol were blocked only by atropine and not by propanolol or phentolamine. In addition to the above effects, carbachol also caused a rapid increase in the parotid guanosine-3', 5' cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) levels without a discernable effect on adenosine-3',5' cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels. The increase in cGMP level caused by carbachol was blocked by atropine and not by phentolamine. The stimulatory effect of carbachol on amylase release was not additive with that of isoproterenol or dibutyryl cAMP. Although carbachol had no effect on basal cAMP levels it did inhibit increases in cAMP caused by isoproterenol. Similarly isoproterenol inhibited increased in parotid cGMP levels caused by carbachol. Unlike the apparent nonadditivity between the effects of isoproterenol and carbachol on amylase release and cAMP and cGMP accumulation, the effects on K+ efflux were additive. The possibility of a role for cGMP in mediating the effects of cholinergic agonists on K+ efflux was lessened by our observations that 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine enhanced the effect of limiting concentrations of carbachol on cGMP accumulation while not enhancing the effects of carbachol on K+ efflux.", 
    "62": "The case is described of a man aged 61, who developed a psoriasiform skin reaction to pindololum after taking 5 mg b.i.d. for seven days. The dermatitis reappeared after resumption of the drug on two occasions. The histology showed a lichenoid eruption."
