Distinct from the other tumors, glioblastoma is a highly invasive brain tumor; invasion causes high recurrence and mortality. Characterization of hCG\u03b2 signaling is to determine therapeutic targets to inhibit invasion and lower recurrence. Through both a stable cell line over-expressing hCG\u03b2 and hCG\u03b2 standards, we tested hCG\u03b2 signaling, migration and invasion in human glioblastoma U87MG cells. ELISA showed that hCG\u03b2 secreted into culture medium at an amount of 237.8 \u00b1 7.8 ng/10(7) cells in hCG\u03b2 transfected stable cells after the cells were grown for 24 h. Through Western blot and Gelatin zymography, we found that hCG\u03b2 standards phosphorylated ERK1/2 and upregulated MMP-2 expression in dose- and time-dependent manners. Meanwhile, overexpressed hCG\u03b2 phosphorylated ERK1/2, and upregulated MMP-2 expression and activity, whereas ERK1/2 blocker PD98059 (25 \u03bcM) significantly decreased both ERK1/2 and MMP-2 expression and activity. In addition, in the same conditions as the signaling test, hCG\u03b2 promoted cell migration and invasion, whereas the PD98059 diminished these effects. These findings demonstrated that hCG\u03b2 phosphorylated ERK1/2 upregulating MMP-2 expression and activity leading to cell migration and invasion, suggesting that hCG\u03b2, ERK1/2 and MMP-2 are the potential targets to inhibit glioblastoma invasion.",

    "8": "Although clinical guidelines recommend long-term \u03b2-blocker (BB) therapy to decrease mortality after acute myocardial infarction, these recommendations are based predominantly on evidence from before the reperfusion and thrombolytic eras. To investigate the effects of BB therapy for patients with acute myocardial infarctions on mortality in the percutaneous coronary intervention era, a total of 5,628 consecutive patients who were admitted <24 hours after the onset of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, treated with emergent percutaneous coronary intervention, and discharged alive were studied. During a median follow-up period of 1,430 days, mortality rates did not differ between patients with and without BB therapy (5.2% vs 6.2%, p\u00a0= 0.786). Multivariate analysis revealed that BB treatment was not associated with a reduced risk for mortality (hazard ratio 0.935, 95% confidence interval 0.711 to 1.230, p\u00a0= 0.534). The results of propensity score matching also indicated that the mortality rates did not differ between the 2 groups. However, subgroup analyses among matched populations revealed that BB treatment was associated with a significantly lower mortality risk for high-risk patients, who were defined as those with Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk scores \u2265121 (hazard ratio 0.596, 95% confidence interval 0.416 to 0.854, p\u00a0= 0.005) or those administered diuretics (hazard ratio 0.602, 95% confidence interval 0.398 to 0.910, p\u00a0= 0.016), but not for lower risk patients. In conclusion, BB treatment was associated with reduced long-term mortality in patients after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction at higher risk, but not in those at lower risk. Although randomized controlled studies are warranted to confirm these results, the implementation of BB therapy for discharged patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction may need to be assessed on the basis of individual mortality risk in the percutaneous coronary intervention era.", 
    "9": "Cardiac events occur in 1% to 5% of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Myocardial ischemia and nonfatal myocardial infarction constitute the most significant risk factors for mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, in patients with coronary artery disease. Perioperative b- blockade has been reported to reduce the risk of perioperative cardiac complications. Seven multicentre randomized trials have evaluated the impact of perioperative b-blocker administration on incidence of cardiovascular events.The Study of Perioperative Ischemia Research Group, the DECREASE and the BBSA trials focused on high risk patients for perioperative complications. The POBBLE, MaVS, and DIPOM trials did not target at patients with specific clinical risk factors, except DIPOM that included patients with diabetes. Finally, the POISE trial randomized patients with a wide variety of risk factors for perioperative cardiac complications. Interestingly, five meta-analyses reported a significant reduction in patients receiving b-blockers, with respect to perioperative myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction. In conclusion, consistent evidence demonstrated a reduction in cardiac mortality and myocardial infarction by perioperative b-blockade in patients with clinical risk factors, undergoing high-risk non-cardiac surgery. However, patients with extensive preoperative ischemia were at high risk of perioperative cardiac complications, despite b-blocker therapy. Conversely, perioperative b-blocker therapy did not reduce the incidence of cardiac complications in patients without clinical risk factors. While, the safety and effectiveness of perioperative b-blockers in intermediate-risk patients, still remain a debatable issue.", 
    "10": "Many medications have been developed for one purpose but then are found to have other clinical activities. There is tremendous interest in whether non-cancer medications may potentially have effects on breast cancer survival. In this review article, we have presented and evaluated the evidence for several commonly used over-the-counter and prescription medications - including aspirin (and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, digoxin, and metformin - that have been evaluated among breast cancer survivors in prospective studies. Substantial scientific evidence supports the hypothesis that some of these common and relatively safe drugs may reduce breast cancer mortality among those with the disease by an amount that rivals the mortality reduction gained by currently used therapies. In particular, the evidence is strongest for aspirin (approximately 50% reduction), statins (approximately 25% reduction), and metformin (approximately 50% reduction). As these drugs are generic and inexpensive, there is little incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to fund the randomized trials that would show their effectiveness definitively. We advocate that confirmation of these findings in randomized trials be considered a high research priority, as the potential impact on human lives saved could be immense.", 
    "11": "Sexual dysfunction is a frequent adverse effect during antihypertensive therapy. However, the mechanisms responsible for these effects are not well understood. The renin-angiotensin system has been identified in testis where it may play a role in testicular function and be involved in the detrimental effects of antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, our objective was to compare the influence of captopril and propranolol on plasma testosterone levels and on hydrolyzing angiotensin's enzymes (angiotensinases) in the testis of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and in control animals. Twenty-four adult male SHRs were used in this study; eight were treated with captopril in drinking water, 8 with propranolol, and 8 were controls. At the end of the 4 weeks treatment period, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was recorded, blood samples were collected, and the right testis was dissected after perfusion of the rat with saline. The soluble (Sol) and membrane-bound (MB) fractions were obtained after solubilization and ultracentrifugation. Fluorometric measurement of Sol and MB angiotensinase activities were performed using arylamide derivatives as substrates. Testosterone was measured by enzyme immunoassay. SBP decreased after captopril but did not change with propranolol treatment. Whereas captopril did not affect angiotensinase activities, highly significant reductions in Sol and MB angiotensinase activities, particularly glutamyl- and aspartyl-aminopeptidases, were observed after treatment with propranolol. Plasma testosterone decreased in captopril treated rats but propranolol had a greater effect. The present results support a general functional depression of the RAS cascade in the testis of propranolol-treated SHR, which may influence the sexual function of these animals.",

Both patients were using a topical fixed combination of brimonidine 0.2 %-timolol 0.5 % for open angle glaucoma. Bilateral granulomatous uveitis and conjunctivitis were diagnosed after 16 months of treatment with a fixed combination of brimonidine-timolol in both cases. Granulomatous inflammation resolved with the cessation of antiglaucomatous drugs and topical corticosteroid treatment. When the inflammation had resolved completely, both patients were rechallenged with topical brimonidine in one eye only to determine causality. Conjunctival hyperemia is a common side effect of glaucoma medications and is sometimes overlooked. Hyperemia may be associated with other signs such as iritis and keratic precipitates or conjunctival inflammation. In such cases, granulomatous inflammation may be considered in the differential diagnosis. The fixed-combination of brimonidine-timolol may cause this clinical picture.",

    "21": "Aldosterone is synthesized in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex under primary regulation by the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin II (A-II) acts through the angiotensin types 1 and 2 receptors (AT1R and AT2R). A-II is metabolized in different tissues by various enzymes to generate two heptapeptides A-III and angiotensin 1-7, which can then be catabolized into smaller peptides. A-II was more potent than A-III in stimulating aldosterone secretion in the adrenocortical cell line HAC15, and A-II, but not A-III, stimulated cortisol secretion. A-II stimulated mRNA expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, CYP11B1, and CYP11B2, whereas A-III stimulated 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, CYP11B1, and CYP11B2 but decreased the expression of CYP17A1 required for cortisol synthesis. The stimulation of aldosterone secretion by A-II and A-III was blocked by the AT1R receptor blocker, losartan, but not by an AT2R blocker. A-II was rapidly metabolized by the HAC15 cells to mainly to angiotensin 1-7, but not to A-III, and disappeared from the supernatant within 6 h. A-III was metabolized rapidly and disappeared within 1 h. In conclusion, A-II was not converted to A-III in the HAC15 cell and is the more potent stimulator of aldosterone secretion and cortisol of the two. A-III stimulated aldosterone secretion but not cortisol secretion.", 
    "22": "This study was designed to investigate the involvement of \u03b2-adrenoceptors of the dorsal hippocampus (DH) in ethanol-induced state-dependent retrieval. We used a step-down type of inhibitory avoidance (IA) task to assess retrieval in male NMRI mice. Bilateral guide cannulae were implanted in the DH. The results showed that in the animals with pre-training injections of ethanol (1g/kg, i.p.) and pre-test saline treatment memory retrieval was impaired. Pre-test injections of ethanol (0.5 and 1g/kg, i.p.) also impaired memory retrieval in the animals that received saline before training. Ethanol (1g/kg, i.p.), when injected in both time points of pre-training and pre-test, induced state-dependent retrieval. The results also revealed that intra-DH infusions of a \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol (0, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.01 and 0.02 \u03bcg/mouse) by itself had no significant effect, however, along with an ineffective dose of ethanol (0.25 g/kg) significantly improved memory retrieval. On the other hand, pre-test intra-DH infusions of different doses of a non-selective \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (0, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 \u03bcg/mouse) by itself had no effect on memory retrieval. But, pre-test intra-DH infusions of the same doses of propranolol (0, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 \u03bcg/mouse) disrupted ethanol-induced state-dependent retrieval. Interestingly, intra-DH infusions of propranolol (0.05, 0.75 and 0.1 \u03bcg/mouse) inhibited the improving effect of salbutamol on state-dependent retrieval. In conclusion, the results support the existence of a functional involvement of \u03b2-adrenoceptors in the DH in ethanol-induced state-dependent retrieval.", 
    "23": "\u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor is a potential target for uterine relaxant drugs for the treatment of preterm labor. Mouse is an ideal experimental model for preterm labor. However, there is limited information on the molecular and functional characteristics of \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptors in mouse uterus. Therefore, the current study was undertaken to characterize the \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptors in late pregnant mouse uterus by molecular and functional experiments and to compare their expression and function with the \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors. Using RT-PCR, we demonstrated the presence of \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor mRNA in the mouse uterus. Accordingly, selective \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor agonist SAR150640 (ethyl-4-{trans-4-[((2S)-2-hydroxy-3-{4-hydroxy-3[(methylsulfonyl)amino]-phenoxy}propyl)amino]cyclohexyl}benzoate hydrochloride) caused concentration-dependent relaxation of the isolated tissue. SR59230A (1 \u03bcM), a selective antagonist of \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptors, antagonized the relaxant response to SAR150640. Using real-time PCR we found that in comparison to \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor mRNA, \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor mRNA is predominantly expressed in the late pregnant mouse uterus. We then assessed the comparative efficiency of different \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonists, such as SAR150640, salbutamol and isoprenaline to relax the tissue. SAR150640 (pD(2) 6.64\u00b10.21, E(max) 104.9\u00b17.95), salbutamol (pD(2) 8.57\u00b10.062, E(max) 103.1\u00b13.22) and isoprenaline (pD(2) 9.48\u00b10.084, E(max) 102.9\u00b15.18) caused concentration-dependent inhibition of uterine rhythmic contractions. While the maximal relaxation to these agonists was comparable, the order of potency was isoprenaline>salbutamol>SAR. These results suggest that \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor mRNA is present in the pregnant mouse uterus and is functionally active. The predominance of \u03b2(2)- over \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor expression may explain variable potency amongst the \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonists.", 
    "24": "We previously demonstrated the critical role of noradrenergic transmission within the ventral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (vBNST) in pain-induced aversion. We showed that activation of \u03b2-adrenoceptors in this brain region by intra-vBNST injection of isoproterenol, a \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonist, produced aversive responses. In the present study, we examined the effects of a \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonist injected into the vBNST on food intake and anxiety-like behaviors in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Bilateral intra-vBNST injection of isoproterenol (3 and 10\u00a0nmol/side) caused a dose-dependent decrease in food intake; this suppressive effect was reversed by co-administration of timolol, a \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist. Dose-dependent (10 and 30\u00a0nmol/side) induction of anxiety-like behaviors by isoproterenol was observed in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test, which was also reversed by co-administration of timolol. Off-site control injections of isoproterenol into the lateral ventricle did not show any significant effect in the food consumption and EPM tests. These results suggest that the vBNST is one of the neuroanatomical substrates which may be involved in the close relationship between negative affective states and reduction of food intake, and that noradrenergic transmission within this brain region plays a critical role in inducing anxiety-like behaviors and reduced food intake.", 
    "25": "An elderly person died of uncontrolled bradycardia in a hospital. The doctor had prescribed 1.35 mg of bisoprolol fumarate orally, but a nurse mistakenly gave the patient 10 mg of the drug 9 hours prior to her death. Bisoprolol was detected in her blood by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry at a concentration of 176 ng/mL. Even if the patient had chronic heart failure, this concentration is double the expected value. This patient was found to have a mutation within cytochrome P2D6, with thymidine substituted for cytosine at position 100 and cytosine for guanine at position 4180, causing proline to serine and threonine to serine amino acid substitutions. This mutation in the intermediate metabolizer allele reportedly reduces enzyme activity by half. However, in addition to the type of cytochrome P450 allelic variant, the amount of enzyme product influences metabolism of this drug. In this case, the high blood concentration of bisoprolol was only partly attributable to an error in prescription; its concentration was inexplicably high.",

Educed facts conduce representation extension by matching the optimal therapy of ischemic heart disease. With the help of SPECT-scanning were educed myocardial blood flow, areas of maximal hypoperfusion and its influence on time pattern and redistribution of myocardial blood flow in patients receiving disease-modifying agents and statins. Some regularities of change of myocardial blood flow depending on applied group of drugs and peculiarities of influence of myocardial perfusion in certain time interval were revealed. Criteria with prognostic significance in prospective individual effectiveness of anti-ischemic drugs were pointed out. New approach, based on choice of anti-ischemic therapy depending on extent of influence on myocardial perfusion and also individual clinical and functional traits of patients, was applied.",

Precipitants for Raynaud's phenomenon of the nipple are known to be cold temperatures, caffeine, and emotional stress. Nipple pain is quoted as the most common cause of cessation of breastfeeding. It is important that lactation consultants and other health care professionals are aware of Raynaud's phenomenon of the nipple and the treatment options available. This is a case of a 37-year-old woman, Gravida 2, Para 1, who was first seen in the antenatal clinic at 34 weeks gestation. A diagnosis of Raynaud's phenomenon of the nipple was made after she began taking labetalol for pregnancy-induced hypertension. The phenomenon had occurred in both of her previous pregnancies on commencing labetalol and resolved postnatally on cessation of the drug. We aim to raise awareness of both the condition itself and the potential role of labetalol in the development of Raynaud's phenomenon of the nipple.",

For this study, 1,122 men aged 70-97 years had baseline and follow-up measures of total hip BMD measured with dual X-ray absorptiometry. Data about mobility, muscle strength, balance, medication use, cognition, medical history and lifestyle factors were collected using questionnaires and clinical assessments. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was also measured. Multivariate linear regression models were used to assess relationships between baseline predictors and change in BMD.",

Annual BMD loss accelerated with increasing age, from 0.4 % in men aged between 70 and 75 years, to 1.2 % in men aged 85+ years. In multivariate regression models, predictors of faster BMD loss were anti-androgen, thiazolidinedione and loop-diuretic medications, kidney disease, poor dynamic balance, larger hip bone area, older age and lower serum 25(OH)D. Factors associated with attenuated bone loss were walking for exercise and use of beta-blocker medications. Change in BMD was not associated with baseline BMD, smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, frailty, or osteoarthritis.",

To assess the pharmacokinetics of selective substrates of human cytochrome P450s in Microminipigs, caffeine (human P450 1A2), warfarin (P450 2C9), omeprazole (P450 2C19), metoprolol (P450 2D6), and midazolam (P450 3A) were administered in combination, intravenously (0.20 mg kg(-1))( )or orally (1.0 mg kg(-1)). Plasma samples obtained, up to 24 hr after dosing, from four male and four female Microminipigs were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to estimate typical pharmacokinetic parameters for each analyte. Bioavailabilities were approximately 80% for caffeine and warfarin, but less than 10% for omeprazole, metoprolol, and midazolam. No significant differences were noted, for the five probes, in area under the plasma concentration-time curve and peak plasma concentration values obtained from male and female Microminipigs. Clearance of caffeine, warfarin, omeprazole or midazolam in vivo, mediated mainly by cytochrome P450s 1A, 2C or 3A in Microminipigs, was similar to data reported for human. However, metoprolol metabolism, mediated by P450 2D enzymes in Microminipigs, was faster than reported for in vivo human kinetic parameters and in vitro in a human liver microsomal system. The results of this study suggest that the Microminipig is a suitable animal model for use in biological experiments for comparisons of pharmacokinetics of drugs in humans. The five-probes in combination used in this study demonstrate the disposition of typical P450 drugs in Microminipigs in vivo, with the aim of use in non-clinical pharmacological/toxicological studies.",

In addition, telmisartan has a partial agonistic effect on peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3). Recently, the effects of telmisartan on spatial memory or the inflammatory response were monitored in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, to date, no studies have investigated the ameliorative effects of telmisartan on impaired spatial memory and the inflammatory response in an AD animal model incorporating additional cerebrovascular disease factors. In this study, we examined the effect of telmisartan on spatial memory impairment and the inflammatory response in a rat model of AD incorporating additional cerebrovascular disease factors. Rats were subjected to cerebral ischemia and an intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric or aggregated amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2). Oral administration of telmisartan (0.3, 1, 3\u2009mg/kg/d) seven days after ischemia and A\u03b2 treatment resulted in better performance in the eight arm radial maze task in a dose-dependent manner. Telmisartan also reduced tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 mRNA expression in the hippocampal region of rats with impaired spatial memory. These effects of telmisartan were antagonized by GW9662, an antagonist of PPAR\u03b3. These results suggest that telmisartan has ameliorative effects on the impairment of spatial memory in a rat model of AD incorporating additional cerebrovascular disease factors via its anti-inflammatory effect.",

Overexpression of bestrophin-1 demonstrated Ca(2+)-dependent Cl(-) channel function, whereas the RPE in bestrophin-1 knockout or mutant bestrophin-1 knock-in mice showed no change in Cl(-) conductance. To account for these apparently mutually exclusive findings, we investigated the function of endogenously expressed bestrophin-1 in a short-time RPE cell culture system by means of immunocytochemistry, Ca(2+) imaging, and siRNA knockdown. Immunocytochemical quantification of bestrophin-1 localization demonstrated 2.5 times higher co-localization with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+)-sensor protein, Stim-1, than with the membrane protein \u03b2-catenin, implicating it in store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE). Ca(2+) release from ER stores under extracellular Ca(2+)-free conditions using thapsigargin (1 \u03bcM) to inhibit endoplasmic Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) followed by re-adjustment of extracellular Ca(2+) to physiological levels activated SOCE, which was insensitive to the blocker of numerous transient receptor potential channels and voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels SKF96563 (1 \u03bcM). SOCE was augmented at 5 \u03bcM and inhibited at 75 \u03bcM by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate which indicates the involvement Orai-1 channels. In confirmation, SOCE was decreased by siRNA knockdown of Orai-1 expression. SOCE amplitude was strongly reduced by siRNA knockdown of bestrophin-1 expression, which was due to neither changes in Stim-1/Orai-1 expression nor Stim-1/bestrophin-1 interaction. The amount of Ca(2+) released by SERCA inhibition was reduced after siRNA knockdown of bestrophin-1, but not of Orai-1. In conclusion we found that a proportion of bestrophin-1 is functionally localized to ER Ca(2+) stores where it influences the amount of Ca(2+) and therefore Ca(2+) signals which result from activation of Orai-1 via Stim-1.",

    "65": "In 12 female rabbits, CHF was induced by 4 weeks of rapid ventricular pacing leading to a decrease in ejection fraction. Twelve rabbits underwent sham operation. Isolated hearts were Langendorff perfused and demonstrated a significant QT prolongation after induction of heart failure. Ranolazine caused a concentration-dependent (10 and 30 \u03bcmol/L) increase of action potential duration (APD(90)) in sham-operated and failing hearts. Eight endo- and epicardial monophasic action potentials revealed a nonsignificant increase in spatial and temporal dispersion of repolarization. The increase in APD(90) was accompanied by a greater increase in refractory period, resulting in a significant increase in postrepolarization refractoriness in sham-operated (+29 ms and\u00a0+55 ms; P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and failing (+22 ms and\u00a0+30 ms; P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) hearts. In control conditions, programmed ventricular stimulation and a burst pacing protocol led to ventricular fibrillation (VF) in 5 of the 12 sham-operated (6 episodes) and in 7 of the 12 failing (18 episodes) hearts. In the presence of ranolazine, VF was inducible in only 2 of 12 failing hearts (5 episodes).

    "67": "Longstanding experimental evidence supports the role of renal venous hypertension in causing kidney dysfunction and \"congestive renal failure.\" A focus has been heart failure, in which the cardiorenal syndrome may partly be due to high venous pressure, rather than traditional mechanisms involving low cardiac output. Analogous diseases are intra-abdominal hypertension and renal vein thrombosis. Proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms include reduced transglomerular pressure, elevated renal interstitial pressure, myogenic and neural reflexes, baroreceptor stimulation, activation of sympathetic nervous and renin angiotensin aldosterone systems, and enhanced proinflammatory pathways. Most clinical trials have addressed the underlying condition rather than venous hypertension per se. Interpreting the effects of therapeutic interventions on renal venous congestion are therefore problematic because of such confounders as changes in left ventricular function, cardiac output, and blood pressure. Nevertheless, there is preliminary evidence from small studies of intense medical therapy or extracorporeal ultrafiltration for heart failure that there can be changes to central venous pressure that correlate inversely with renal function, independently from the cardiac index. Larger more rigorous trials are needed to definitively establish under what circumstances conventional pharmacologic or ultrafiltration goals might best be directed toward central venous pressures rather than left ventricular or cardiac output parameters.",

The primary end point was all-cause mortality, and the secondary end points were readmissions from HF and follow up EFs at 1, 3, and 5 years. HF etiology (ischemic or nonischemic) was a significant effect modifier, and separate analysis was performed for these subcohorts. Compared with those on carvedilol, patients on metoprolol succinate were less likely to experience mortality in the ischemic HF cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43-0.66) but were more likely to die in the nonischemic HF cohort (aHR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10-1.28).

    "75": "Endurance training is accompanied by important adaptations in both cardiovascular and autonomic nervous systems. Previous works have shown that the main component of gap junctions in the ventricular myocardium (connexin 43 (Cx43) can be regulated by adrenergic stimulus. On the other hand, training raises vagal and decreases sympathetic tone, while augmenting myocardial sensitivity to sympathetic stimulation during exercise. We therefore evaluated the regulation of Cx43 expression by sympathetic tone during exercise in trained and sedentary mice. Training induced an increase in the protein level of Cx43 by 45-70% under resting conditions. The expression of Cx43 was inhibited in trained but not in untrained mice in response to a 60 min exercise bout. Normal basal expression was restored after 60 min of resting. Cx43 reached a minimum that was not different from basal expression in untrained mice. In accordance, electrocardiography and action potential analysis did not reveal major electrophysiological implications for the drop in Cx43 abundance in trained-exercise mice. We prevented Cx43 inhibition using propranolol, and observed increased basal mRNA levels of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors without significant changes in the ratio \u03b21 to \u03b22. In conclusion, we showed that Cx43 expression is transiently inhibited by \u03b2-adrenergic stimulus in trained mice during acute exercise.", 
    "76": "We have developed a cylindrical insert that can be inserted in the fornix for extended release of glaucoma drug timolol. The insert is prepared by incorporating timolol-loaded nanoparticles into a poly hydroxyl ethyl methacrylate (p-HEMA) matrix. A 1-mm diameter, 7.5-mm long insert with 25% (w/w) particles can release timolol for about 10 days at an average rate of about 15 \u03bcg/day, which may be therapeutically effective. The increase in particle fraction increases drug loading, but also increases the release duration. The net effect of increasing the particle fraction is a significant increase in release duration, but a decrease in daily drug release rates, in the first few weeks. The release duration increases to about 1 and 3 months on increasing the particle fraction to 50% and 75%, respectively. The average daily release rates in the first 3 weeks are 15, 9, and 3 \u03bcg/day for the inserts with 50%, 75%, and 100% (w/w) particles, respectively. The mechanism of release is hydrolysis of the ester bond that links timolol to the propoxylated glyceryl triacrylate matrix, and thus the release profiles fit a first order reaction model. The water content of the inserts decreases from 31% to almost zero on increasing the particle loading from 25% to 100%. The rate constant for the hydrolysis decreases with an increase in particle loading in the insert most likely due to the reduction in the water content. The inserts can be packaged in wet conditions and stored in a refrigerator, but the inserts will exhibit a burst release caused by release of the drug from the particles into the p-HEMA matrix during the shelf life. Also, the magnitude of drug release after the initial burst is reduced due to the storage. The burst effect could potentially be avoided by packaging the inserts in a dry state, with hydration before insertion.",

    "81": "Mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone) is a \u03b2-ketoamphetamine stimulant drug of abuse with close structural and mechanistic similarities to methamphetamine. One of the most powerful actions associated with mephedrone is the ability to stimulate dopamine (DA) release and block its re-uptake through its interaction with the dopamine transporter (DAT). Although mephedrone does not cause toxicity to DA nerve endings, its ability to serve as a DAT blocker could provide protection against methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity like other DAT inhibitors. To test this possibility, mice were treated with mephedrone (10, 20, or 40 mg/kg) prior to each injection of a neurotoxic regimen of methamphetamine (four injections of 2.5 or 5.0 mg/kg at 2 h intervals). The integrity of DA nerve endings of the striatum was assessed through measures of DA, DAT, and tyrosine hydroxylase levels. The moderate to severe DA toxicity associated with the different doses of methamphetamine was not prevented by any dose of mephedrone but was, in fact, significantly enhanced. The hyperthermia caused by combined treatment with mephedrone and methamphetamine was the same as seen after either drug alone. Mephedrone also enhanced the neurotoxic effects of amphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine on DA nerve endings. In contrast, nomifensine protected against methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. As mephedrone increases methamphetamine neurotoxicity, the present results suggest that it interacts with the DAT in a manner unlike that of other typical DAT inhibitors. The relatively innocuous effects of mephedrone alone on DA nerve endings mask a potentially dangerous interaction with drugs that are often co-abused with it, leading to heightened neurotoxicity.",

Pharmacokinetic study was performed by analyzing drug concentration in plasma by a developed and validated LC-MS/MS method following oral administration of MET and TEL at 2.5 mg/kg and 2.0 mg/kg dose, respectively, both individually and in combination. Antihypertensive activity of MET and TEL in above dose and manner was evaluated on artificially induced hypertension on laboratory animals.

Pharmacokinetic data revealed the probable absence of any pharmacokinetic interaction when co-administered. Improved blood pressure lowering effect was observed by combination therapy. Moreover, toxic effects obtained at high dose level of each treatment groups were transient and reversible and no evidence of additive toxic effects were observed due to concomitant administration. So, this combination can primarily be stated as safe which will be confirmed after clinical interaction studies in humans.",

The Tityus stigmurus scorpion is widely distributed in Northeastern Brazil and known to cause severe human envenomations, inducing pain, hypoesthesia, edema, erythema, paresthesia, headaches and vomiting. Most potassium channel blocking peptides that have been purified from scorpion venoms contain 30-40 amino acids with three or four disulfide bridges. These peptides belong to \u03b1-KTx subfamily. On the other hand, the \u03b2-KTx subfamily is poorly characterized, though it is very representative in some scorpion venoms. A transcriptomic approach of T.stigmurus scorpions developed by our group revealed the repertoire of possible molecules present in the venom, including many toxins of the \u03b2-KTx subfamily. One of the ESTs found, named TSTI0003C has a cDNA sequence of 538 bp codifying a mature protein with 47 amino acid residues, corresponding to 5299 Da. This \u03b2-KTx peptide is a new member of the BmTXK\u03b2-related toxins, and was here named TstKMK. The three-dimensional structure of this potassium channel toxin of the T. stigmurus scorpion was obtained by computational modeling and refined by molecular dynamic simulations.

    "89": "The non-depolarizing muscle relaxant vecuronium inhibits contraction by competitive inhibition of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors (AchRs), which decreases the number of quanta released per impulse in response to 50 Hz stimulation. The specific role of calcium influx through L-type calcium channels is the promotion of endocytosis and vesicle recycling during high-frequency stimulation. Vecuronium also induces four pulse tetanic fade, a proxy measure of decreased quanta release. We examined whether vecuronium suppresses neuromuscular transmission during high-frequency stimulation by inhibiting presynaptic L-type calcium channels.", 
    "90": "Fifty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five treatment groups: unstimulated control group, \u03b1-bungarotoxin (BTX) group, nifedipine group, vecuronium group, and nifedipine plus vecuronium group. Rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm neuromuscular juctions were stimulated at 50 Hz and field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded. Expression levels of the presynaptic Ca(2+)-binding, protein synaptotagmin 1, and the presynaptic plasma membrane protein, syntaxin 1, were measured by Western blots.", 
    "91": "The fEPSPs evoked by 50 Hz stimulus trains were decreased by vecuronium, nifedipine, and by vecuronium plus nifedipine. Nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, reduced the expression of synaptogamin and syntaxin and blocked the suppressive effect of vecuronium, suggesting that both agents inhibit presynaptic L-type calcium channels.", 
    "92": "Vecuronium which blocked L-type calcium channels may suppress activity of the \u03b1(3)\u03b2(2) nAChR subunit, which exists in the presynaptic membrane and enhances quantal release. This \u03b1(3)\u03b2(2) nAChR-mediated positive feedback effect may be facilitated by L-type Ca(2+) channel activity under high-frequency stimulation. Vecuronium may disrupt this positive feedback cycle, leading to suppression of fEPSPs. Vercuronium may reduce neuromuscular transmission through presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms.", 
    "93": "Migraine is a prevalent and disabling neurologic disorder. The aims of migraine management are lifting the burden of migraine and improvement of quality of life (QOL) of the sufferers. Chronification of episodic migraine would introduce refractory chronic migraine or medication overuse headache. The prevention of chronification of migraine is one of the major roles of prophylactic medication. There are some classes of prophylactic drugs against migraine headache. The calcium blocker (lomeridine, verapamil), anti-epileptic drugs (valproate), beta-blockers (propranorol), and anti-depressant (amytriptyline) have high quality evidence in migraine prophylaxis. Migraine has varied cormorbid disorders, such as hypertension, cardiac diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, psychiatric disorders, epilepsy, and allergic disorders. Upon choosing preventive drug, neurologists should consider the comorbid disorders. Recent studies revealed possible association of migraine and cerebrovascular diseases, especially in migraine with aura and in young women. Not only headache expert but every neurologist should have broad knowledge concerning migraine management.",

Over a mean follow-up of 2.7 years, 5121 (17.8%) patients died and 15,055 (52.3%) experienced CV death or hospitalization. PAD was an independent predictor of all individual and composite CV outcomes examined (including heart failure), with the exception of stroke. In patients with PAD (compared to those without PAD), the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was 1.25 (95% CI 1.15-1.37; p<0.001) and the HR for CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke or heart failure hospitalization was 1.24 (1.16-1.33; p<0.001).",

    "99": "Chronic exposure to glucocorticoids might result not only in insulin resistance or cognitive deficits, but it is also considered as a risk factor for pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease. Propranolol is a \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist commonly used in the treatment of hypertension or acute anxiety. The effects of propranolol (5\u00a0mg/kg) have been tested in a model of chronic corticosterone administration (100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, 4\u00a0wk) in drinking water. Corticosterone administration led to cognitive impairment in the novel object recognition test that was reversed by propranolol. Increased levels of A\u03b2 in the hippocampus of corticosterone-treated mice were counteracted by propranolol treatment, purportedly through an increased IDE expression. Chronic corticosterone treatment induced responses characteristic of insulin resistance, as increased peripheral insulin levels, decreased activation of the insulin receptor (pIR) and decreased associated intracellular pathways (pAkt). These effects might be related to a decreased c-Jun N terminal kinase 1 expression. Again, propranolol was able to counteract all corticosterone-induced effects. One of the main kinases involved in tau phosphorylation, glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2), which is inactivated by phosphorylation by pAkt, was found to be decreased after corticosterone and increased after propranolol treatment. Concomitant changes in pTau expression were found. Overall, these data further strengthen the potential of propranolol as a therapeutic agent for pathologies associated with the interaction glucocorticoids-insulin resistance and the development of relevant cellular processes for Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "100": "Mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis is the most common nephritis worldwide. We examined the effects of low- and high-dose telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, in rats with progressive anti-Thy1.1 mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis in a clinically relevant situation of established renal damage. Uninephrectomized nephritic rats were randomized on day 28 to remain untreated (control treatment; CT), or to receive low- (0.1 mg/kg/day, LT) or high-dose telmisartan (10 mg/kg/day, HT), hydrochlorothiazide + hydralazine (8 + 32 mg/kg/day, HCT + H), or atenolol (100 mg/kg/day, AT). CT and LT rats were hypertensive, whereas HT, HCT + H and AT treatment normalized blood pressures. On day 131, despite similar blood lowering effects, only HT, but not AT or HCT + H, prevented loss of renal function and reduced proteinuria compared to CT. Only HT potently ameliorated glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial damage, cortical matrix deposition, podocyte damage and macrophage infiltration. HT reduced cortical expression of platelet derived growth factor receptor-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 as well as transforming growth factor-\u03b21. LT exhibited minor but significant efficacy even in the absence of antihypertensive effects. Transcript array analyses revealed a four-fold down-regulation of renal cortical chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 6 (CCR6) mRNA by HT, which was confirmed at the protein level. Silencing of CCR6 did not alter podocyte function in vitro, thus indicating a predominant role in the tubulo-interstitium. In human kidney biopsies, CCR6 mRNA and mRNA of its ligand chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 was up-regulated in patients with progressive IgA nephropathy compared to stable disease. Thus, delayed treatment with high-dose telmisartan exerted a pronounced benefit in progressive mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, which extended beyond that of equivalent blood pressure lowering. We identified down-regulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptors and CCR6 as potential mediators of telmisartan-related renoprotection. CCR6 may also regulate the renal outcome in human mesangioprolfierative glomerulonephritis.", 
    "101": "Antihypertensive therapy is aimed at improving vascular and cardiac health, as well as lowering blood pressure (BP). The benefit of such drugs in untreated patients with borderline BP has not been demonstrated. Subjects with BPs \u2265130\u2009mm\u2009Hg systolic or \u226585\u2009mm\u2009Hg diastolic and at least one additional risk factor were randomly assigned to treatment with carvedilol, lisinopril, their combination or placebo. Cardiovascular health was assessed by a disease score (DS), which combines the following tests of cardiovascular function and structure: resting BP, large- and small-artery elasticity (SAE), BP response to exercise, retinal vasculature analysis, electrocardiogram, carotid intima-medial thickness, left ventricular mass, microalbuminuria and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide. DS was assessed at baseline, after 3 and 9 months of therapy and 1 month after discontinuation of therapy. All active treatment groups displayed a sustained reduction in BP during 9 months of treatment, with the greatest reduction in the cardvedilol+lisinopril group. DS and SAE improved in all the treatment groups but the changes were of borderline significance and exhibited no evidence for progressive improvement from 3 months (functional) to 9 months (structural). All changes were reversed within 1 month after discontinuation of therapy. We conclude that 9 months of treatment with carvedilol, lisinopril or their combination produce a sustained and well-tolerated functional improvement but not a structural improvement, perhaps because of a lack of the nitric oxide-enhancing effects of other agents that inhibit structural changes in the vasculature.", 
    "102": "Recent studies suggest that antimuscarinics might suppress bladder afferent activity by blocking muscarinic receptors in the urothelium, myofibroblasts and detrusor, thereby improving overactive bladder symptoms. \u03b2(3)-Adrenoceptors are predominantly expressed in the human bladder and mediate relaxation of detrusor muscle. \u03b2(3)-Adrenoceptor agonists increase bladder capacity and prolong micturition interval. It is assumed that \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor agonists could exert an inhibitory effect on bladder afferent through \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptors in the urothelium and detrusor, which eventually improve the symptom of urgency. Mirabegron is a potent and selective \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor agonist. A Japanese phase 3 study showed that mirabegron has excellent efficacy and safety for treating overactive bladder. \u03b1(1)-Adrenoceptor antagonists (\u03b1(1)-blockers) have become a mainstay of male lower urinary tract symptoms treatment. The \u03b1(1)(A) subtype is known to mediate functional obstruction as a result of benign prostatic enlargement. Recent studies have suggested that \u03b1(1)(A)-adrenoceptors are additionally involved in the generation of storage symptoms. The \u03b1(1)(D) subtype is thought to play a role in the facilitation of voiding reflex; that is; storage symptoms. \u03b1(1)-Blockers often fail to alleviate overactive bladder symptoms. In this context, combination therapy with \u03b1(1)-blockers and antimuscarinics has been recommended. Treatment with 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor for 1 year improves urinary symptoms and flow rate by reducing prostatic volume in men with benign prostatic enlargement. A pooled analysis showed that the long-term (2 or 4 years) treatment with 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor reduced the rate of progression to acute urinary retention and surgery. Combination therapy with 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor and \u03b1(1)-blocker was shown to provide a rapid improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms, and reduce the relative risk of acute urinary retention and benign prostatic hyperplasia-related surgery. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors might target a nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway in the prostate, urethra and bladder. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (sildenafil or tadalafil) were shown to provide clinically relevant improvements in both male lower urinary tract symptoms and erectile dysfunction.",

We have learned that she was prescribed metoprolol at another medical center to treat new onset hypertension. On her physical examination there were no associated lesions on the body. All other physical findings, as well as blood chemistry, urine analysis, and complete blood count, were found to be normal. After her consultation with the dermatology department, palmar psoriasis due to metoprolol therapy was diagnosed. The personal and family history of the patient yielded no history for psoriasis. Metoprolol therapy was withdrawn and topical treatment with corticosteroid was recommended. The patient has returned to the clinic subsequently, with no recurrence of the lesions. Psoriazis is one of the rare side effects of beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "106": "Coherence between the bioelectric activity of sensorimotor cortex and contralateral muscles can be observed around 20 Hz. By contrast, physiological tremor has a dominant frequency around 10 Hz. Although tremor has multiple sources, it is partly central in origin, reflecting a component of motoneuron discharge at this frequency. The motoneuron response to ~20 Hz descending input could be altered by non-linear interactions with ~10 Hz motoneuron firing. We investigated this further in eight healthy human subjects by testing the effects of the beta-adrenergic agents propranolol (non-selective \u03b2-antagonist) and salbutamol (\u03b2(2)-agonist), which are known to alter the size of physiological tremor. Corticomuscular coherence was assessed during an auxotonic precision grip task; tremor was quantified using accelerometry during index finger extension. Experiments with propranolol used a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. A single oral dose of propranolol (40 mg) significantly increased beta band (15.3-32.2 Hz) corticomuscular coherence compared with placebo, but reduced tremor in the 6.2-11.9 Hz range. Salbutamol (2.5 mg) was administered by inhalation. Whilst salbutamol significantly increased tremor amplitude as expected, it did not change corticomuscular coherence. The opposite direction of the effects of propranolol on corticomuscular coherence and tremor, and the fact that salbutamol enhances tremor but does not affect coherence, implies that the magnitude of corticomuscular coherence is little influenced by non-linear interactions with 10 Hz oscillations in motoneurons or the periphery. Instead, we suggest that propranolol and salbutamol may affect both tremor and corticomuscular coherence partly via a central site of action.", 
    "107": "In secretory granules and vesicles, membrane transporters have been predicted to permeate water molecules, ions and/or small solutes to swell the granules and promote membrane fusion. We have previously demonstrated that aquaporin-6 (AQP6), a water channel protein, which permeates anions, is localized in rat parotid secretory granules (Matsuki-Fukushima et al., Cell Tissue Res 332:73-80, 2008). Because the localization of AQP6 in other organs is restricted to cytosolic vesicles, the native function or functions of AQP6 in vivo has not been well determined. To characterize the channel property in granule membranes, the solute permeation-induced lysis of purified secretory granules is a useful marker. To analyze the role of AQP6 in secretory granule membranes, we used Hg\u00b2\u207a, which is known to activate AQP6, and investigated the characteristics of solute permeability in rat parotid secretory granule lysis induced by Hg\u00b2\u207a (Hg lysis). The kinetics of osmotic secretory granule lysis in an iso-osmotic KCl solution was monitored by the decay of optical density at 540 nm using a spectrophotometer. Osmotic secretory granule lysis was markedly facilitated in the presence of 0.5-2.0 \u03bcM Hg\u00b2\u207a, concentrations that activate AQP6. The Hg lysis was completely blocked by \u03b2-mercaptoethanol which disrupts Hg\u00b2\u207a-binding, or by removal of chloride ions from the reaction medium. An anion channel blocker, DIDS, which does not affect AQP6, discriminated between DIDS-insensitive and sensitive components in Hg lysis. These results suggest that Hg lysis is required for anion permeability through the protein transporter. Hg lysis depended on anion conductance with a sequence of NO(3) (-) > Br\u207b > I\u207b > Cl\u207b and was facilitated by acidic pH. The anion selectivity for NO(3) (-) and the acidic pH sensitivity were similar to the channel properties of AQP6. Taken together, it is likely that AQP6 permeates halide group anions as a Hg\u00b2\u207a-sensitive anion channel in rat parotid secretory granules.",

Glucocorticoids influence catecholamine metabolism and adrenoceptor expression in many cell types. We hypothesized that adrenal hormones affect the production of tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and NO by macrophages by altering the modulatory influence of catecholamines. To prove the hypothesis, peritoneal exudate macrophages from propranolol-treated non-operated and adrenalectomized rats and from corticosterone-supplemented adrenalectomized rats were examined for lipopolysaccharide-stimulated NO and TNF-\u03b1 production in vitro and for expression of \u03b22-adrenoceptors and major catecholamine-metabolizing enzymes. Glucocorticoid deprivation increased NO production by macrophages, whereas 4 days of propranolol treatment was ineffective in this respect. However, propranolol treatment, via \u03b22-adrenoceptor blockade, increased production of TNF-\u03b1 by macrophages in both non-operated and adrenalectomized rats (showing dramatically enhanced TNF-\u03b1 production due to a lack of circulating glucocorticoids) for the same value. The expression of \u03b22-adrenoceptor was increased in peritoneal macrophages that were freshly isolated from non-operated, propranolol-treated and adrenalectomized rats (due to adrenal catecholamine deficiency). Propranolol did not affect macrophage \u03b22-adrenoceptor expression in adrenalectomized rats. Given that propranolol increased the density of macrophage tyrosine hydroxylase expression only in non-operated rats and affected the mRNA expression of monoamine oxidase-A in neither non-operated nor adrenalectomized animals, a significant influence of propranolol on peritoneal exudate cell noradrenaline content was found only in non-operated rats. A lack of circulating adrenal hormones also affected noradrenaline metabolism and content in peritoneal exudate cells including macrophages. Collectively, despite differences in the abundance of macrophage catecholamine-\u03b22-adrenoceptor system components and in the TNF-\u03b1 response to lipopolysaccharide between adrenalectomized and non-operated rats, propranolol increased TNF-\u03b1 production by the same amount in macrophages from these two groups of animals.",

Polyclonal antibodies (Abs) for ATL were generated, and a highly specific microplate immunochemical assay, that is, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), for its detection was developed. The ATL ELISA exhibited I50 and limit of detection (I20) values of 0.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.048 and 0.032\u2009\u00b1\u20090.016\u2009ng/ml, respectively, and the Abs did not cross-react with any of the tested beta-blocker drugs. Furthermore, a human \u03b21AR (h-\u03b21AR) was stably expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9). The receptor was employed to develop a competitive-binding assay that monitored binding of ATL in the presence of isoproteranol by quantification of secondary messenger, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), levels in the transfected cells. The assay showed that the recombinant h-\u03b21AR was functional, could bind the agonistic ligand isoproterenol as well as the antagonist ATL, as indicated by a dose-dependent elevation of cAMP in the presence of isoproteranol, and decrease after ATL addition. The highly efficient and sensitive ELISA and the receptor assay represent two methods suitable for efficient and cost-effective large-scale, high-throughput monitoring of ATL in environmental, agricultural, and biological samples.",

Interestingly, the deletion of both \u03b21- and \u03b22-ARs abolished sex difference of \u03b2-MHC expression, as mRNA levels in the LVs of knockout males were increased and reached values comparable to those of knockout females. Moreover, the \u03b21-AR antagonist metoprolol induced about a threefold increase in \u03b2-MHC expression in adult male mice. The capability of gender to regulate \u03b2-MHC expression was also evaluated in the presence of hemodynamic overload. Thoracic aortic coarctation (TAC) produced cardiac hypertrophy along with a 12-fold increase in \u03b2-MHC and a 50% decrease in \u03b21-AR expression in males but not in females, thus abolishing the gender difference observed in sham animals for such genes. By contrast, TAC did not change \u03b22-AR expression. In conclusion, our results show that the expression of \u03b2-MHC and \u03b21-AR in the LVs undergo gender-related and correlated changes under both physiological and pathological conditions and suggest a role of \u03b21-AR-mediated signaling.", 
    "132": "Prostaglandin analogues and adrenergic drugs are used to reduce the intraocular pressure in glaucoma, which may partly be due to an effect on the tone of the intraocular arteries supplying the ciliary body. The aim of the present study was to investigate the interaction between prostaglandins and autonomic nervous activity induced by electrical stimulation of the tone in these ciliary vessels. The intraocular part of porcine ciliary arteries were isolated and mounted in a microvascular myograph for isometric tension recordings, and the effect of prostaglandin E(2) on electrically induced contractions was studied in the presence of selective EP receptor antagonists. PGE(2) induced concentration-dependent inhibition of electrically induced contractions of intraocular ciliary arteries which depended on the presence of the vascular endothelium. The effect of PGE(2) was blocked by an EP(4) receptor antagonist but not by an EP(1) receptor antagonist. The neurogenic contractions were partially inhibited by an \u03b1(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist and totally inhibited by a NPY(1) receptor antagonist. The effect of these antagonists was similar when contraction was induced by noradrenaline and NPY. Neurogenic contractions in intraocular porcine arteries are mediated by \u03b1(2)-adrenoceptors and NPY(1) receptors and can be inhibited by PGE(2) acting on prejunctional EP(4) receptors. This contributes to a further understanding of the role of the autonomic nervous system and prostaglandins for regulating blood flow to the anterior segment of the eye.", 
    "133": "The solubility vs. pH profiles of five ionizable drugs of different nature (a monoprotic acid, a monoprotic base, a diprotic base and two amphoteric compounds showing a zwitterionic species each one) have been determined through two different methodologies: the classical shake-flask (S-F) and the potentiometric Cheqsol methods using in both instances the appropriate Henderson-Hasselbalch (H-H) or derived relationships. The results obtained independently from both approaches are consistent. A critical revision about the influence of the electrolyte used as buffering agent in the S-F method on the obtained solubility values is also performed. Thus, some deviations of the experimental points with respect the H-H profiles can be attributed to specific interactions between the buffering electrolyte and the drug due to the hydrotrophic character of citric and lactic acids. In other cases, the observed deviations are independent of the buffers used since they are caused by the formation of new species such as drug aggregates (cefadroxil) or the precipitation of a salt from a cationic species of the analyzed compound (quetiapine).",

Islets were isolated from adult male Wistar rats after collagenase digestion. Static incubation was used to determine effects of DEX or MED on insulin secretion and ionic-channel currents of \u03b2-cells. Results indicate that both drugs dose-dependently inhibit insulin secretion, DEX more potently than MED. The inhibitory effects were attenuated by addition of yohimbine or by pretreatment of rats with pertussis toxin (PTX). 10 nM DEX decreased the current amplitude of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, but this did not occur when the N-type Ca2+ channel blocker \u03c9-conotoxin was added. In the presence of tetraethylammonium, a classical voltage-gated K+ channel (Kv channel) blocker, the magnitude of inhibition of insulin secretion by MED was reduced. However, when tolbutamide, a specific blocker of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP channel), was present, the magnitude of MED inhibition of insulin secretion was not influenced, suggesting that Kv-channel activity alteration, but not that of KATP channels, is involved in MED-associated insulin secretory inhibition. The Kv-channel currents were increased during 1 nM MED exposure at membrane potentials ranging from -30 mV to -10 mV, where action potentials were generated in response to glucose stimulation. These results indicate that DEX and MED inhibit insulin secretion through an \u03b12-adrenoceptor and PTX-sensitive GTP-binding protein pathway that eventually involves Kv channel activation and Ca2+ channel inhibition.", 
    "180": "Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) are non-malignant, largely cutaneous vascular tumors affecting approximately 5-10% of children to varying degrees. During the first year of life, these tumors are strongly proliferative, reaching an average size ranging from 2 to 20 cm. These lesions subsequently stabilize, undergo a spontaneous slow involution and are fully regressed by 5 to 10 years of age. Systemic treatment of infants with the non-selective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker, propranolol, has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in reducing the size and appearance of IHs. However, the mechanism by which this occurs is largely unknown. In this study, we sought to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of \u03b2 blocker treatment in IHs. Our data reveal that propranolol treatment of IH endothelial cells, as well as a panel of normal primary endothelial cells, blocks endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and formation of the actin cytoskeleton coincident with alterations in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), p38 and cofilin signaling. Moreover, propranolol induces major alterations in the protein levels of key cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, and modulates global gene expression patterns with a particular affect on genes involved in lipid/sterol metabolism, cell cycle regulation, angiogenesis and ubiquitination. Interestingly, the effects of propranolol were endothelial cell-type independent, affecting the properties of IH endothelial cells at similar levels to that observed in neonatal dermal microvascular and coronary artery endothelial cells. This data suggests that while propranolol markedly inhibits hemangioma and normal endothelial cell function, its lack of endothelial cell specificity hints that the efficacy of this drug in the treatment of IHs may be more complex than simply blockage of endothelial function as previously believed.",

Growing evidence shows that Ucn1 increases the endothelial permeability in inflammatory conditions; however, the detailed mechanisms are not clear. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms of increased endothelial permeability by Ucn1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Pretreatment of HUVECs with Ucn1 increased the endothelial cell permeability, which was augmented by LPS synergistically. Significant downregulation of VE-cadherin expression was also observed. Moreover, Ucn1 increased phosphorylation of protein kinase D (PKD) and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) in a time- and CRHR(2) -dependent manner. Inhibition of PKD and HSP27 drastically attenuated Ucn1-induced downregulation of VE-cadherin expression. Further investigations demonstrated that Ucn1 phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin at Ser552 to disrupt the cadherin-catenin complex and hence promote the disassociation of \u03b2-catenin and VE-cadherin. Disassociation of \u03b2-catenin and VE-cadherin resulted in decreased VE-cadherin expression while on the contrary \u03b2-catenin was increased, which may due to the inactivation of GSK-3\u03b2. Increased \u03b2-catenin translocated into the nucleus and subsequently bound to TCF/LEF site, contributing to the elevated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The above effects of Ucn1 were completely reversed by CRHR(2) receptor blocker, antisauvagine-30. Taken together, our data suggest that Ucn1 increase LPS-induced endothelial permeability by disrupting the VE-cadherin-\u03b2-catenin complex via activation of CRHR(2) and PKD-HSP27 signaling pathway.",

Among patients with STEMIs, increases were noted in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (6.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.7 to 7.2), antiplatelet agents other than aspirin (5.0%, 95% CI 4.0% to 6.0%), lipid-lowering medications (4.5%, 95% CI 3.1% to 5.8%), \u03b2 blockers (2.7%, 95% CI 2.4% to 3.0%), aspirin (1.2%, 95% CI 1.0% to 1.3%), and heparin (0.8%, 95% CI 0.4% to 1.3%). Among patients with NSTEMIs, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (5.5%, 95% CI 5.0% to 6.1%), antiplatelet agents other than aspirin (3.7%, 95% CI 2.7% to 4.7%), lipid-lowering medications (3.0%, 95% CI% 1.9 to 4.1%), \u03b2 blockers (4.2%, 95% CI 3.9% to 4.4%), aspirin (1.9%, 95% CI 1.6% to 2.1%), and heparin (1.7%, 95% CI 1.3% to 2.1%) increased. Among patients with STEMIs, decreases in the use of thrombolytic agents (-7.2%, 95% CI -7.9% to -6.6%) and coronary artery bypass grafting (-2.4%, 95% CI -3.6% to -1.2%) were observed. Similar increases in percutaneous coronary intervention and decreases in the use of thrombolytic agents and coronary artery bypass grafting were noted among all patients. In conclusion, trends of increasing use of evidence-based therapies were found for patients with STEMIs and those with NSTEMIs over the past 22 years.", 
    "184": "Intravenous (IV) beta-blockade is currently a Class IIa recommendation in early management of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) without obvious contraindications.", 
    "185": "We searched the PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Register for Controlled Clinical Trials for randomized clinical trials from 1965 through December, 2011, comparing intravenous beta-blockers administered within 12 hours of presentation of ACS with standard medical therapy and/or placebo. The primary outcome assessed was the risk of short-term (in-hospital mortality-with maximum follow up duration of 90 days) all-cause mortality in the intervention group versus the comparator group. The secondary outcomes assessed were ventricular tachyarrhythmias, myocardial reinfarction, cardiogenic shock, and stroke. Pooled treatment effects were estimated using relative risk with Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio, using a random-effects model.", 
    "186": "Sixteen studies enrolling 73,396 participants met the inclusion \u2044 exclusion criteria. In- hospital mortality was reduced 8% with intravenous beta-blockers, RR=0.92 (95% CI, 0.86-1.00; p=0.04) when compared with controls. Moreover, intravenous beta-blockade reduced the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (RR=0.61; 95 % CI 0.47-0.79; p=0.0003) and myocardial reinfarction (RR=0.73, 95 % CI 0.59-0.91; p=0.004) without increase in the risk of cardiogenic shock, (RR=1.02; 95% CI 0.77-1.35; p=0.91) or stroke (RR=0.58; 95 % CI 0.17-1.98; p=0.38).", 
    "187": "Intravenous beta-blockers early in the course of appropriate patients with ACS appears to be associated with significant reduction in the risk of short-term cardiovascular outcomes, including a reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality.", 
    "188": "Lysosomal degradation of ubiquitinated \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2(2)ARs) serves as a major mechanism of long-term desensitization in response to prolonged agonist stimulation. Surprisingly, the \u03b2AR antagonist carvedilol also induced ubiquitination and lysosomal trafficking of both endogenously expressed \u03b2(2)ARs in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and overexpressed Flag-\u03b2(2)ARs in HEK-293 cells. Carvedilol prevented \u03b2(2)AR recycling, blocked recruitment of Nedd4 E3 ligase, and promoted the dissociation of the deubiquitinases USP20 and USP33. Using proteomics approaches (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry), we identified that the E3 ligase MARCH2 interacted with carvedilol-bound \u03b2(2)AR. The association of MARCH2 with internalized \u03b2(2)ARs was stabilized by carvedilol and did not involve \u03b2-arrestin. Small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of MARCH2 ablated carvedilol-induced ubiquitination, endocytosis, and degradation of endogenous \u03b2(2)ARs in VSMCs. These findings strongly suggest that specific ligands recruit distinct E3 ligase machineries to activated cell surface receptors and direct their intracellular itinerary. In response to \u03b2 blocker therapy with carvedilol, MARCH2 E3 ligase activity regulates cell surface \u03b2(2)AR expression and, consequently, its signaling.", 
    "189": "It has been uncertain whether patients with acute heart failure syndromes (AHFSs) benefit from a lower heart rate (HR) itself or from treatment for heart failure (HF) that reduces sympathetic tone with consequent HR reduction (HRR). The present study investigated the influence of HRR during hospitalization on the prognosis of AHFS patients.", 
    "190": "In 421 AHFS patients, we analyzed the relationship between HRR during hospitalization and the prognosis after discharge. During a mean follow-up period of 1.9 years, 76 and 55 patients died or were re-hospitalized for HF, respectively. Although HR at discharge did not influence cardiac events (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.00 [95% CI; 0.99-1.02], p=0.22), the extent of HRR was a predictor of cardiac events (HR: 0.89 [0.84-0.96], p<0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the cardiac event rate of the HRR-positive group (\u2265 27 bpm reduction of HR from 114 \u00b1 24 at admission to 65 \u00b1 11 bpm at discharge) was significantly lower than that of the HRR-negative group (\u2264 26 bpm (=median value) reduction of HR from 74 \u00b1 14 to 71 \u00b1 14 bpm). In the HRR-positive group, the cardiac event rate was significantly lower in patients receiving beta-blockers. Furthermore, the extent of HR change was an important predictor of cardiac events among other markers, compared with the change in systolic blood pressure or B-type natriuretic peptide.", 
    "191": "The HR itself at discharge was not associated with the prognosis, but the extent of HRR achieved by treatment of HF with beta-blockers was a strong predictor for the clinical outcome in AHFS patients.", 
    "192": "Nebivolol is a novel beta1-selective beta-blocker with vasodilator properties mediated through activation of the l-arginine-nitric oxide pathway. There is no published report of coronary artery spasm associated with nebivolol. We describe a 64-year-old female patient who developed unstable angina secondary to nebivolol-induced vasospastic angina which was also visible during coronary angiography."
