If myocardial ischaemia exists, an antianginal treatment will be prescribed. In case of heart failure, the association of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and diuretics is required. A beta-blocker, especially at low dose, should be discussed according to the symptoms. When ischaemic cardiomyopathy is asymptomatic, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is also likely to benefit the patient. Coronary revascularization may be indicated according to the importance of both residual ischaemia and resistance to medical therapy.", 
    "1": "Stable angina is usually due to coronary atherosclerosis and complicated by myocardial lesions responsible for ischaemic myocardiopathy. Tobacco suppression, aspirin and cholesterol lowering drugs especially statins are the best way to slow coronary atherosclerosis progression. beta-blockers, physical conditioning are the two main medical means to suppress anginal symptoms. Converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers are useful to slow the progression rate of ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Revascularisation procedures are combined with medical treatment and help treating symptoms and preventing myocardial lesions.", 
    "2": "Adequate treatment of unstable angina, initiated soon enough in the setting of a coronary care unit, avoids evolution towards myocardial infarction in more than 90% of the patients. Treatment consists of a combination of anti-thrombotic and anti-ischemic therapies. Oral beta-adrenergic blockers and intravenous nitrates represent the usual anti-ischemic treatment; calcium antagonists will be prescribed as an adjunct therapy if the response is insufficient or if a vasospastic mechanism is suspected. Anti-thrombotic treatment usually consists of a combination of low dose aspirin and intravenous heparin. Twelve hours are usually sufficient to titrate this medical regimen and to assess its efficacy; if myocardial ischaemia persists or recurs despite this therapy, urgent coronary angiography and subsequent revascularization are warranted. Usually ischaemia is adequately controlled by medical therapy, elective coronary angiography is nevertheless useful to screen high risk patients (left main and severe three-vessel disease) needing coronary artery bypass graft. In most cases however revascularization, by surgery or angioplasty, will be considered only if ischaemia at rest or induced by exercise, recurs despite optimal medical treatment.", 
    "3": "Milk yield and milking time were measured on one occasion for several daughters (n = 6-44) from 16 bulls at morning milkings. Blood from the bulls was collected, and platelets and mononuclear leucocytes were isolated. The alpha 2-adrenoceptors on platelet membranes were identified by binding of [3H]rauwolscine, whereas for the determination of beta 2-adrenoceptors on intact mononuclear leucocytes, [3H]CGP-12177 was used. It was found that mean milk flow rate was highly correlated (P < 0.001) with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor densities on blood platelets. No correlation was found with the beta 2-adrenoceptors on mononuclear leucocytes. It is concluded that estimation of the alpha 2-adrenoceptors on blood platelets from bulls could eventually be used to investigate milking characteristics of cows, and might be useful in the future as a marker in genetic studies.", 
    "4": "From the five broad classes of antihypertensive drugs that have been in use long enough for adequate clinical experience to be obtained, the most recent report of the Joint National Committee on Hypertension recommends drugs from two older classes--the diuretics and the beta-adrenergic blockers--as first-line treatment. This article argues that newer drugs and in particular the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be equally or more appropriate as first choice. Physicians should choose on the basis of a drug's pharmacologic properties and the patient's clinical profile, rather than according to a generic set of rules. Considering that the goals of modern antihypertensive therapy are not only lowering of blood pressure to prevent complications, but also long-term cardioprotection without adverse effects on the quality of life, some newer drugs might even prove more cost-effective in the long run.", 
    "5": "To further elucidate the renal effects of NEP inhibition, we employed NEP inhibitor UK 73967 (UK), with or without a kinin receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (Hoe), in Sprague-Dawley normotensive rats and DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. In Sprague-Dawley rats: 1) injected UK significantly decreased NEP, and increased kinins, urine volume (UV) and urinary sodium excretion (UNaV), while none of the variables changed with vehicle treatment; 2) no difference was found in plasma ANP between the vehicle and UK groups; and 3) Hoe canceled the increases of UV and UNaV caused by UK. In DOCA-salt rats: 1) infused UK significantly decreased NEP, and increased UV and UNaV, while UV and UNaV were slightly decreased, and NEP did not change with vehicle treatment; 2) plasma ANP was significantly higher in UK group than in the vehicle group; and 3) Hoe could not abolish the increase of UV and UNaV induced by UK. These data indicate that the contributions of renal kinins and plasma ANP to the diuretic and natriuretic mechanisms of NEP inhibition may differ between Sprague-Dawley normotensive rats and DOCA-salt hypertensive rats.", 
    "6": "To further investigate the mechanisms of renal effects of neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) inhibition, we employed a specific NEP inhibitor, UK 73967 (UK), with or without a specific kinin receptor antagonist, Hoe 140 (Hoe), or nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), in Sprague-Dawley rats, and evaluated the urinary NEP, kinins, cGMP and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). None of the variables changed with vehicle injection. After injection of UK, NEP decreased significantly and urinary kinins, cGMP, urine volume (UV) and urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) increased significantly. Injected Hoe canceled the increase in UV and UNaV induced by UK. Plasma ANP did not show any difference between vehicle and UK groups. With a pretreatment of L-NMMA, injected UK decreased NEP and increased kinins, while urinary cGMP, UV and UNaV did not increase. In conclusion, augmented kinins may play an important role in the renal water-sodium metabolism by NEP inhibition, and NO may contribute to the kinins' action on this mechanism, while ANP may not contribute to it, at least in normotensive rats. Moreover, changes in urinary cGMP do not reflect the changes in plasma ANP, but rather, those in NO under this condition.", 
    "7": "To elucidate the role of norepinephrine (NE) in the hyperplasia of brown adipose tissue (BAT), we investigated the effects of NE on the expression of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) in rat brown adipocyte primary culture and on capillary growth in an in vitro angiogenesis model in which microvascular fragments and brown adipocyte precursor cells isolated from rat BAT were grown in coculture. NE significantly increased the number of brown adipocyte precursor cells. The NE effect on cell proliferation was greatly inhibited by anti-FGF-2-specific antibody. Likewise,NE considerably increased the levels of FGF-2 mRNA and the antigen in brown adipocyte primary culture. The ability of NE to stimulate the expression of FGF-2 mRNA was blocked by actinomycin D or was inhibited partly by propranolol. Moreover, NE considerably increased the in vitro capillary growth and the level of FGF-2 antigen in the coculture. These results suggest that NE is a crucial factor to mediate FGF-2 production, in part via the beta-adrenergic receptor, in rat brown adipocytes and to stimulate the cell proliferation and capillary growth in BAT by an autocrine/paracrine mechanism.", 
    "8": "This study examines the acute effects of two differing beta adrenergic blocking agents (metoprolol and a third generation vasodilating beta blocker) on plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), brain (ventricular) natriuretic factor (BNF), and haemodynamic variables in patients with heart failure.",

    "10": "20 patients with impaired left ventricular systolic function [ejection fraction 32 (SEM 2.3)%] were randomised in a double blind manner to receive either oral metoprolol 6.25 mg twice daily or celiprolol 25 mg daily. Haemodynamic variables were evaluated by Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter over 24 hours. ANF and BNF concentrations were measured at baseline, 5 h, and 24 h by radioimmunoassay.", 
    "11": "At baseline ANF and BNF concentrations were considerably raised compared to the normal range. Treatment with metoprolol caused ANF to rise further to 147% of the basal level at 5 h (P = 0.017) and 112% at 24 h (P = 0.029). This was associated with a small but non-significant rise in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance were unchanged at 24 h. In contrast, after celiprolol ANF fell to 90% of basal levels at 5 h and to 74% of basal level at 24 h (P = 0.019), associated with a small but non-significant fall in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [-3.3 (2.7) mm Hg] and systemic vascular resistance, and rise in cardiac output from 3.2 (0.2) to 4.0 (0.4) l/min (P = 0.04). BNF concentrations rose to 112% of baseline at 5 h (P = 0.09) after metoprolol but fell slightly, to 91% of baseline values, after celiprolol (NS).", 
    "12": "Metoprolol, even in very low doses (6.25 mg), produced a rise in ANF and BNF, although minimal haemodynamic changes were detected. In contrast, a vasodilating beta blocker was associated with a significant fall in ANF and BNF and a small rise in cardiac output. This study confirms both the advantages of vasodilating beta blockers over metoprolol for initial treatment of heart failure and the usefulness of ANF and BNF measurements for the assessment of drug effects in heart failure compared to traditional haemodynamic measurements.", 
    "13": "In 53 patients with stable angina pectoris 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (Holter) and bicycle ergometry were used before and six months after a coronary bypass. The examination before operation was made while anti-ischaemic medication was administered, the examination after revascularization was done without medication. The patients were divided into group A (31 patients where complete revascularization of the myocardium was made) and group B (22 patients with incomplete revascularization) and the results were compared during medication and after aortocoronary bypass. In patients of group A revascularization prolonged significantly the load period during ergometry, as compared with medication (from 7.2 +/- 2.2 min. to 9.1 +/- 2.4 min., p < 0.01), the depression of the ST segment in lead V5 was reduced (from 1.3 +/- 0.8 mm to 0.8 +/- 1.0 mm, p < 0.05) and the number of painful episodes during Holter monitoring (from 1 +/- 1 to 0, p < 0.01). In patients of group B none these parameters improved. Medicamentous treatment eliminated ischaemia during a load in 16% of patients in group A, while revascularization did so in 61% (p < 0.01). In patients of group B the success rate of medication was 9%, in revascularization 14% (p = n.s.). During Holter monitoring after revascularization no episodes of ST depressions associated with anginous pain were recorded, although the mean number of silent episodes of ST depressions per 24 hours was 6 +/- 8 in patients of group B and 1 +/- 2 in patients of group A. In patients with stable angina pectoris complete revascularization is significantly more effective than anti-ischaemic medication as regards tolerance of loads and suppression of myocardial ischaemia. Silent myocardial ischaemia is frequent after aortocoronary bypasses and its possible occurrence should be taken into account, in particular in patients with incomplete revascularization.", 
    "14": "Before heart rate variability (HRV) can be used to investigate the effects of drugs or other clinical interventions in chronic stable angina, it is important to establish the stability and reproducibility of HRV indices over time. HRV analysis was performed on two consecutive 24-hour ambulatory ECG recordings in 19 patients with chronic stable angina. Time-domain analysis included average heart rate, variance, SDNN, SDANN5, ASDNN5 and PNN50. The power spectral analysis was computed using fast Fourier transformation for the total power (0.003 and 0.40 Hz), low frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz), and high frequency (0.15-0.40 Hz) bands. No statistically significant differences in the time or frequency domains were found between the two ambulatory ECG recordings. HRV indices in the time and frequency domains are consistent and reproducible in patients with chronic stable angina. Thus, cardiac autonomic tone can be evaluated using HRV analyses, and any significant changes that occur after medical therapy or other clinical interventions can be ascribed to the intervention rather than the lability of cardiac autonomic tone.", 
    "15": "1. We have previously reported the relative mRNA and protein level of the long and short splice variants of Gs alpha (Gs alpha L and Gs alpha S) in human atrium. We have now measured the relative proportions of the serine+ and serine- variants of Gs alpha L and Gs alpha S in human atrium, and assessed, indirectly, whether their differential expression may (i) regulate Gs alpha phosphorylation, and (ii) be regulated by atrial cyclic AMP levels. 2. The serine+ and serine- variants of Gs alpha L and Gs alpha S were estimated by single nucleotide primer extension in 36 right atrial strips of which half were from beta-adrenoceptor-blocked patients. The ratio of serine+ to serine- variants was 0.06 +/- 0.12 for Gs alpha L, compared with 8.04 +/- 12.16 for Gs alpha S (P < 0.001). 3. Isoelectric points of Gs alpha and Gs alpha S in the atria of four beta-adrenoceptor-blocked and four non-beta-adrenoceptor-blocked patients were estimated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Two-dimensional gel analysis gave a consistent pattern with several spots for both Gs alpha L and Gs alpha S; however, the isoelectric points of Gs alpha S were more acid (5.18 +/- 0.24) than those of Gs alpha L (5.87 +/- 0.17, P < 0.001). 4. No significant difference in either the serine variants or isoelectric point value was observed between beta-adrenoceptor-blocked and non-beta-adrenoceptor-blocked patients. 5. In conclusion, all four Gs alpha variants were expressed in human atrium, but Gs alpha L is almost entirely of the serine- form. Gs alpha S has a more acidic isoelectric point than Gs alpha L, indicating a possible post-translational modification. The lack of difference in our results between beta-adrenoceptor-blocked and non-beta-adrenoceptor-blocked patients suggests indirectly that cyclic AMP is an unlikely candidate for regulating splicing or post-translational modification of Gs alpha in vivo.",

Both normal and high serum IGF-I levels have been reported, as well as a decrease in IGF-I bioactivity. We have evaluated the GH response to GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) in hyperthyroid patients and the effects of hyperthyroidism on serum IGF-I levels. The possible relations between nutritional status, thyroid hormones and IGF-I levels were also investigated. We also studied the influence of long-term beta-adrenoceptor blockade on the GH response to GHRH in these patients.",

Eight hyperthyroid patients and 8 control subjects received 50 micrograms GHRH i.v. Seven hyperthyroid patients were reevaluated after beta-adrenoceptor blockade. IGF-I and albumin levels were measured initially in all hyperthyroid patients and control subjects.

IGF-I levels were significantly reduced in hyperthyroid patients compared to controls (131 +/- 10 vs 201 +/- 16 micrograms/l, respectively; P < 0.01). Ideal body weight, serum albumin levels and the lean body mass were also reduced in hyperthyroid patients. After beta-adrenoceptor blockade there were no changes in the blunted GH response to GHRH in hyperthyroid patients.",

    "22": "Functional N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists including competitive antagonists, glycine partial agonists, and use-dependent channel blockers exhibit antidepressant-like actions in preclinical models. The present study examined the effects of eliprodil (SL-82.0715), an NMDA antagonist acting at polyamine sites, in behavioral and neurochemical tests predictive of antidepressant activity. In mice, eliprodil produced a dose-dependent reduction in immobility in the forced swim test, but was inactive in the tail suspension test. Chronic treatment with eliprodil produced both a significant downregulation of beta-adrenoceptors and a reduction in the potency of glycine to inhibit [3H]5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid binding to strychnine-insensitive glycine receptors in neocortical membranes. In toto, these data indicate that like other NMDA antagonists, eliprodil possesses antidepressant-like actions in preclinical tests predictive of clinical efficacy.", 
    "23": "We have previously reported that propranolol adversely affects sexual behavior in male rats. To elucidate whether the effects of propranolol might involve decrements in ability, we examined two components of sexual function ex copula--ejaculatory reflex capacity and erectile reflexes. In the first study, we examined the effects of various doses of (+/-)-propranolol (1.25-10 mg/kg) administered subcutaneously. Marked inhibition was observed, evidenced by increases in the latency to ex copula ejaculation and to initial erection and decrements in the number of seminal emissions and in the number of erectile reflexes. Analyses of dose-response relationships indicated that the degree of inhibition increased with increasing dose. In the second study, we evaluated the stereo-selectivity of the responses. Both (+)- and (-)-propranolol (1.25 mg/kg) significantly inhibited ejaculatory reflex potential, and although (+)- and (-)-propranolol significantly inhibited erectile reflexes, (-)-propranolol had a greater effect. The data are interpreted to indicate that a) propranolol-induced sexual dysfunction involves both motivational and ability aspects; and b) propranolol-induced inhibition of genital reflexes may be due, at least in part, to mechanisms other than beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "24": "We retrospectively analyzed the effects of long-term topical antiglaucoma therapy on the results of trabeculotomy. We studied 83 eyes with 76 primary open angle glaucoma and 7 eyes with capsular glaucoma, each of which had undergone trabeculotomy alone and none of which had a history of laser trabeculoplasty or glaucoma surgery. The outcome of trabeculotomy was assessed after a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Using a life-table method, there was no significant difference in the outcome of trabeculotomy between groups divided by duration and type of preoperative topical therapy. There was not statistically significant difference in the intraocular pressure reduction between the groups of long or short duration of topical therapy. We concluded that the duration and type of topical antiglaucoma medications had no significant effect on the outcome of trabeculotomy.",

Gallopamil, a metoxylic derivative of verapamil, has many of its properties and so, caution is recommended when given to patients with depressed left ventricular function. Clinical studies about this effect are scarce, and we have assessed it in patients with coronary heart disease and diminished left ventricular function.",

In the other patient, the thickness decreased from 2.4 and 0.9 cm preoperatively to 0.8 and 0.7 cm, respectively, postoperatively. Left atrial diameter decreased from 5.4 to 4.7 cm in 1 patient, 3.5 to 2.6 cm in the other.",

Epinephrine prolonged 90% monophasic action potential duration from 348 +/- 48 (mean +/- SD) to 381 +/- 49 ms (22 sites, p < 0.0005) and increased the dispersion of action potential duration (difference between the longest and shortest action potential duration) from 36 +/- 20 to 64 +/- 34 ms (p < 0.005). Verapamil eliminated (two sites) or reduced (four sites) early afterdepolarizations and abolished ventricular premature complexes in two of the three patients as well as suppressing torsade de pointes.

    "50": "To determine whether chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition produces functional changes in the aorta normotensive rats, four groups of rats were studied in parallel for 6 weeks. Group 1 orally received ramipril and beta 2-kinin antagonist HOE140 500 micrograms/kg per day s.c. by injection for the remaining 2 weeks; group 3, hydralazine 100 mg/kg per day PO for 6 weeks; group 4 (control), subcutaneous injections of saline solution during the last 2 of 6 weeks. In aorta isolated from group 1 the relaxations induced by bradykinin, acetylcholine, and histamine were significantly potentiated compared with those of group 4. In group 3, despite a decrease in systolic blood pressure similar to that induced by ramipril treatment, the responses to these three endothelium-dependent vasodilators were not different from those of group 4. In group 2, bradykinin-induced relaxations were completely abolished whereas acetylcholine-induced and histamine-induced relaxations were to those of group 4. The inhibitory effect of the endothelium on serotonin-induced contractions was significantly increased in preparations of group 1 compared with those of groups 2 through 4. Indirect measurements of nitric oxide formation such as contractions evoked by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) and aortic cGMP content were also significantly enhanced in preparations from group 1 compared with those of groups 2 through 4. Moreover, because the relaxations to nitroglycerin and nitroprusside were similar in groups 1, 2, and 4 an alteration of the guanylate cyclase activity by ramipril treatment is quite unlikely. Thus long-term treatment with ramipril potentiates the endothelium-dependent responses in the rat aorta by enhancing nitric oxide availability.", 
    "51": "Circulating antibodies from human and murine chagasic sera are able to interact with myocardium, activating neurotransmitter receptors. Here, we studied the effects of a monoclonal antibody (MAb CAK20.12), which recognizes a 150 kilodalton antigen of Trypanosoma cruzi and reacts with normal human and murine striated muscles and with cardiac tissue. The MAb CAK20.12 binds to purified cardiac membranes and interferes with the binding of beta-adrenergic receptor radioligand ([125I]CYP) and muscarinic cholinergic receptor (mAChR) radioligand ([3H]QNB) in a noncompetitive way. As a consequence of this interaction, beta-adrenergic receptor and mAChR were activated, leading to increased intracellular levels of cyclic AMP as a result of beta-adrenergic receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase triggering. When its sympathetic action was abrogated, it also induced an mAChR-mediated increase in cyclic GMP. Furthermore, cardiac physiology was modified by MAb CAK20.12, as it was able to increase cardiac contractility through beta-adrenoceptor activation and to decrease atrial frequency as a result of mAChR activation. The fact that this MAb modulates and modifies the mechanical and biochemical activity of normal murine heart established an important basis for future research and understanding of how the host's humoral immune response acts on the course and development of the chronic chagasic myocardiopathy.", 
    "52": "Because of advances in reperfusion therapy and improved outcomes through the use of treatment adjuncts, the morbidity and mortality from AMI have been significantly reduced in the past decade. Reperfusion therapy is now the standard of care for all patients who meet eligibility criteria. Equally important in the treatment of AMI, however, are the many treatment adjuncts that are universally available (Table 1). Aspirin and beta-blockers should be used in all patients without contraindications. Heparin, in turn, has a clear role in many but not all patients. Finally, the best application of magnesium has yet to be determined.", 
    "53": "Epinephrine and other beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) agonists are often administered during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a time when acid-base abnormalities and arrhythmias also commonly occur. We tested whether beta 2AR binding is influenced by pH or the antiarrhythmic drug lidocaine, and whether pH might influence the interaction of lidocaine with beta 2ARs. With institutional review board approval and informed consent, 32 venous blood samples were obtained from volunteers. Lymphocytes (which bear beta 2ARs similar to those found in heart) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. Specific binding of the beta AR ligand 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) was determined with lidocaine concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-2) mol/L (n = 18 experiments), and with and without lidocaine (n = 10 experiments), 100 mumol/L, and with and without QX314 (a permanently charged lidocaine derivative), 1 mmol/L (n = 4 experiments). Data are presented as percent of control-specific binding measured at a pH of 7.4. Statistical analysis consisted of Spearman's rank-test. 3H-DHA-specific binding increased (p < .001) with pH. Thus, alkaline conditions favored binding of 3H-DHA to the receptor. Lidocaine inhibited 3H-DHA binding to beta 2ARs in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentration that inhibited specific binding of 3H-DHA by 50% was 3.1 x 10(-4) mol/L (95% confidence limits, 1.3 x 10(-4) to 7.5 x 10(-4) mol/L). Lidocaine potency at inhibiting beta 2AR binding also increased with increasing pH; thus, there was limited benefit (in terms of increasing binding to beta 2ARs) to increasing pH when lidocaine was present. QX314, despite being present in a 10-fold greater concentration than lidocaine, had no effect on 3H-DHA binding at any tested pH. The affinity of beta 2 ARs for both 3H-DHA and lidocaine increased with pH. Thus, the response to beta 2AR agonists (when no lidocaine is present) might be expected to be greater with normal or alkalotic pH than under acidotic conditions, supporting the correction of metabolic acidosis to achieve optimal effects from beta 2AR agonists during resuscitation.", 
    "54": "Endothelium-derived relaxing factors have been described as important intermediates in beta-adrenergic vasodilation of resistance coronary vessels, but their involvement at the level of large epicardial coronary arteries remains controversial. Therefore, we examined the role of vascular endothelium in the beta-adrenergic-mediated vasodilation of large epicardial coronary arteries in conscious dogs.", 
    "55": "Nine dogs were instrumented for measurement of left circumflex coronary artery diameter (CD) by sonomicrometry and coronary blood flow velocity (CBFv) with a Doppler technique in response to graded doses of isoproterenol (0.001 to 0.1 microgram/kg IV bolus). Under control conditions, isoproterenol induced dose-dependent increases in CD and CBFv. When CBFv was kept constant at its baseline value by inflation of a cuff occluder, isoproterenol still induced dose-dependent increases in CD, but the latter were of lesser magnitude than those observed under normal CBFv conditions (110 +/- 20 versus 170 +/- 30 microns, respectively, ie, a reduction of 33% of the dilatory response at 0.1 microgram/kg, P < .01). In the same dogs, the coronary endothelium was then mechanically removed at the site of CD measurement by a balloon angioplasty technique. After this procedure, the dose-dependent increases in CD induced by isoproterenol under either normal or controlled CBFv conditions were overimposable, and their magnitude was similar to that of the increases observed in the presence of an intact endothelium when CBFv was kept constant. After beta 1-adrenergic receptor blockade by atenolol (1 mg/kg), isoproterenol-induced increases in CD were abolished either when CBFv was kept constant or after endothelium removal.", 
    "56": "In conscious dogs, the direct stimulating effect of isoproterenol on beta 1-adrenergic receptors is endothelium-independent at the level of large coronary arteries. The endothelium reinforces the dilatory response to isoproterenol through an indirect, flow-dependent mechanism.",

To investigate whether other atrial Gs protein-coupled receptors also become hyperresponsive after chronic treatment with beta-blockers, we investigated 5-HT4 receptors in tissues and myocytes, which mediate serotonin-evoked increases of both contractile force and cAMP levels.", 
    "58": "Isolated right atrial strips from patients who had been chronically treated or not treated with a beta-blocker were set up to contract. In tissues from beta-blocker-treated patients (n = 27), the maximum inotropic response to serotonin was 56 +/- 3% (mean +/- SEM) of the effect elicited by (-)-isoproterenol (200 mumol/L) compared with a response of 19 +/- 6% in tissues from non-beta-blocker-treated patients (n = 13) (P < .001). The responsiveness of the tissues to Ca2+ was unchanged by chronic beta-blocker treatment. Serotonin (1 and 10 mumol/L) increased tissue cAMP levels, the increase with 10 mumol/L being significantly greater (P < .05) in tissues from beta-blocker-treated (n = 9) than in non-beta-blocker-treated (n = 7) patients. In paced atrial myocytes, serotonin caused concentration-dependent increases in contraction. Myocytes obtained from atria of beta-blocker-treated patients were more sensitive (P < .01) to the effects of serotonin (-log EC50, 7.9 +/- 0.2 mol/L; n = 12) than myocytes obtained from non-beta-blocker-treated patients (-log EC50, 7.3 +/- 0.2 mol/L, n = 12). Chronic beta-blocker treatment had no effect on forskolin-evoked myocyte responses. Carbachol (1 mumol/L) suppressed the effects of both serotonin (n = 6) and (-)-isoproterenol (n = 6) in the same atrial myocyte.", 
    "59": "Chronic treatment of patients with beta-blockers causes atrial 5-HT4 receptor inotropic hyperresponsiveness and enhanced serotonin-evoked increases in cAMP levels. This may be due to modified cross talk between 5-HT4 receptors, beta-adrenergic receptors, and muscarinic receptors.",

    "64": "Extracellular Mg2+ homeostasis was studied in vivo in the anesthetized rat. Animals were infused with isoproterenol (ISO) for 10 minutes, and serum Mg2+ was measured after the infusion and then 10 and 20 minutes later. A dose-dependent increase in circulating Mg2+ was observed in animals infused with ISO at a rate of 0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 or higher. The time course of the effect demonstrated that circulating Mg2+ continued to increase 20 minutes after the end of the ISO infusion. A predicted maximal increase in serum Mg2+ concentration of 19.3% was derived with a predicted EC50 of 0.08 microgram.kg-1.min-1. The maximal percent increase corresponded to a net increase of 6.7 mumol/300 g body wt. Because infusion of ISO resulted in changes in hemodynamic parameters, most notably a drop in blood pressure, a group of animals was infused with nitroprusside to mimic the hypotensive response via a nonadrenergic mechanism. Under these conditions, there was a transient increase in circulating Mg2+ that was largely inhibited by propranolol, indicating that hypotension per se was not responsible for the mobilization of Mg2+. Infusion of salbutamol, but not prenalterol, also induced an increase in circulating Mg2+. Pretreatment with butoxamine, ICI-118551, or propranolol prevented the ISO-induced increase in serum Mg2+. Pretreatment with atenolol minimally affected the ISO-induced changes in circulating Mg2+. Pretreatment with CGP-20271A actually enhanced the ISO-induced increase in circulating Mg2+. This evidence demonstrates the existence of a pool of Mg2+ that is mobilized into the circulation in response to selective beta 2-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "65": "Previous studies have suggested that trout cardiac performance is highly dependent on coronary blood flow during periods of increased activity or hypoxia. To examine the relationship between coronary perfusion and cardiac performance in swimming trout, cardiac output (Q), coronary blood flow (qcor), and dorsal aortic blood pressure were measured in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during normoxia and hypoxia (PO2 approximately 9 kPa). In normoxic trout, stepwise changes in cardiovascular variables were observed as the swimming speed was incrementally increased from 0.15 body lengths (bl)/s to 1.0 bl/s. At 1.0 bl/s, qcor and cardiac power output had both increased by approximately 110%, and coronary artery resistance (Rcor) had decreased by 40%. During hypoxia, resting qcor was 35% higher, and Rcor was 20% lower, compared with normoxic values. In hypoxic swimming trout, the maximum changes in qcor (155% increase) and Rcor (50% decrease) were recorded at 0.75 bl/s. In contrast, cardiac power output and Q increased by an additional 40 and 20%, respectively, as swimming speed was increased from 0.75 to 1.0 bl/s. The results indicate that 1) increases in qcor parallel changes in cardiac power output; 2) during hypoxia there are compensatory increases in cardiac performance and coronary perfusion; and 3) the scope for increasing qcor in swimming trout is approximately 150%. In addition, results from preliminary experiments suggest that beta-adrenergic, but not cholinergic, mechanisms are involved in the regulation of coronary blood flow during exercise.", 
    "66": "The relative role of parasympathetic, sympathetic, and ventilatory influences in the genesis of blood pressure and R-R interval variability is controversial. In 13 freely behaving WKY rats instrumented with venous and arterial catheters and chest electrodes, mean arterial pressure (MAP, mmHg), R-R interval (ms), and respiratory fluctuations were monitored for 90 min in the control condition and after intravenous atropine (0.75 mg/kg) and/or propranolol (1 mg/kg). Spectral power (pw) in the 0.25- to 0.75-Hz (midfrequency, MF) and the 0.75- to 3.0-Hz (high-frequency, HF, respiratory-synchronous) bands was computed in sequences of 400 heartbeats by use of a combined autoregressive analysis. Atropine reduced but did not abolish HF R-R interval pw (from 1.73 +/- 0.50 to 0.39 +/- 0.27 ms2, P < 0.01) and halved HF MAP pw (from 0.41 +/- 0.30 to 0.21 +/- 0.12 mmHg2, P < 0.05), whereas propranolol did not affect HF pw of the R-R interval or MAP. Propranolol also failed to significantly modify MF R-R interval pw (from 0.48 +/- 0.44 to 0.40 +/- 0.34 ms2, P = NS) or MF MAP pw (from 0.54 +/- 0.39 to 0.42 +/- 0.20 mmHg2, P = NS), whereas atropine virtually abolished MF R-R interval pw (from 0.48 +/- 0.44 to 0.01 +/- 0.01 ms2, P < 0.01) and also significantly reduced MF MAP pw (from 0.54 +/- 0.39 to 0.33 +/- 0.24 mmHg2, P < 0.01).

    "67": "Acute elevations in circulating angiotensin II (ANG II) are known to increase circulating norepinephrine (NE) levels. However, the time course of catecholamine release relative to chronic ANG II infusion is not known. Furthermore, it is unknown if this ANG II-induced catecholamine release is ANG II type 1 (AT1) receptor mediated or whether the increase in serum catecholamines is responsible for the myocyte and coronary vascular damage seen within the first 3 days of chronic ANG II infusion. Therefore, we examined the influence of chronic ANG II stimulation on serum catecholamine levels with and without AT1 blockade and the effect of beta-blockade on ANG II-induced myocyte and coronary vascular damage. The results indicate that NE release is AT1 mediated, but NE is not significantly elevated until day 4 of ANG II infusion after which it remains elevated. beta-Blockade prevented most ANG II-related myocyte necrosis and coronary vascular damage. Therefore, myocyte and coronary vascular damage do not appear to be related to increased serum NE levels, but instead may be due to the release of neural catecholamines within the heart.",

    "72": "Isolated rat hindlimbs were perfused at 37 degrees C and constant physiological pressure (80 +/- 0.5 mmHg) while the flow rate that was allowed to freely self-adjust was monitored. Under these conditions, evidence was obtained for both alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation of oxygen consumption (VO2) in contrast to constant-flow perfusion, which has only convincingly shown alpha-adrenergic stimulation of VO2 in response to adrenergic agents. Addition of norepinephrine (NE; 1-33 nM) led to an increase in VO2 with a maximum of 29% above the basal value at 3.3 nM, even though the flow rate decreased. Phenylephrine (3.3-33 nM) and vasopressin (10-100 pM) also showed similar, but lesser in magnitude, vasoconstriction-associated stimulatory effects on VO2. Prazosin (an alpha 1-antagonist) completely reversed the NE-mediated decrease in flow rate and significantly blocked the increased VO2. In contrast, isoproterenol (10-1,000 nM) increased both flow rate (30%) and VO2 (32%). The isoproterenol-stimulated VO2 was not blocked by the beta 1-, beta 2-antagonist propranolol (10 microM), although the increased flow was reversed. In the presence of propranolol (1 or 10 microM), BRL-35135A (a beta 3-agonist) also stimulated VO2 (18%) without significant change in flow rate. These results lend further support to the role of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor in muscle VO2. In addition there is evidence for the presence of a functional beta 3-adrenoceptor as an additional subtype responsible for NE-mediated thermogenesis in the rat hindlimb.", 
    "73": "The ability to apply controlled forces to the cell membrane may enable elucidation of the mechanisms and pathways involved in signal transduction in response to applied physical stimuli. We have developed a magnetic particle-electromagnet model that allows the application of controlled forces to the plasma membrane of substrate-attached fibroblasts. The system allows applied forces to be controlled by the magnitude of the magnetic field and by the surface area of cell membrane covered with collagen-coated ferric beads. Analysis by single-cell ratio fluorimetry of fura 2-loaded cells demonstrated large calcium transients (50-300 nM) in response to the magnetic force applications. Experiments using either the stretch-activated channel blocker gadolinium chloride or ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid to eliminate external calcium ions, or addition of extracellular manganese ions, indicated that there was a calcium influx through putative stretch-activated channels. The probability of a calcium influx in single cells was increased by higher surface bead loading and the degree of cell spreading. Depolymerization of actin filaments by cytochalasin D increased the amplitude of calcium response twofold. The regulation of calcium flux by filamentous actin content and by cell spreading indicates a possible modulatory role for the cytoskeleton in channel sensitivity. Magnetic force application to beads on single cells provides a controlled model to study mechanisms and heterogeneity in physical force stimulation of cation-permeable channels.", 
    "74": "Neural control of free and forced diving bradycardia and peripheral resistance was studied in the muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) by means of acute pharmacological blockade with the muscarinic blocker atropine, the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine and the beta-adrenergic blockers nadolol and propranolol. Saline injection was used as a control. Heart rate in control animals increased before voluntary dives and dropped markedly as soon as the animals submerged. Heart rate started increasing towards the end of voluntary dives and reached pre-dive values within the first 5 s of recovery. Pre-dive and post-dive tachycardia were reduced in beta-blocked animals, emphasizing the role of the sympathetic system during the preparatory and recovery periods of voluntary dives. Diving bradycardia and the acceleration in heart rate before surfacing were abolished by atropine and unaffected by nadolol, demonstrating the importance of vagal efferent activity during diving. The results after blockade with nadolol suggest that there is an accentuated antagonism between the two branches of the autonomic nervous system during diving, so that parasympathetic influences on the heart predominate. Propranolol-treated muskrats had a higher diving heart rate than saline- and nadolol-treated animals, which may be due to a sedative effect caused by propranolol crossing the blood-brain barrier, a blockade of central catecholaminergic pathways or a peripheral neural effect, due to the anaesthetic properties of propranolol. Phentolamine did not affect diving bradycardia, indicating that diving bradycardia occurs independently of peripheral vasoconstriction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "The inhibitory effects of catecholamines on rat myometrium mediated by beta-adrenoceptors are modulated by ovarian steroids. Previously reported findings of radioligand binding studies on myometrial membranes have demonstrated changes in the numbers of beta-adrenergic binding sites following ovarian steroid treatment. However, these changes were not accompanied by parallel functional changes. In the present study, we have investigated possible mechanisms of heterologous beta-adrenoceptor regulation by ovarian steroids. Binding studies were performed on myometrial membrane and cytosolic preparations from rats which had been ovariectomized and subsequently received no hormonal treatment or had been treated with oestradiol, progesterone or combined oestradiol and progesterone. The beta-adrenergic antagonist [125I]iodocyanopindolol and the unlabelled competing agonist, isoprenaline, were used in the present studies. Hormonal treatment had no effect on the concentration of beta-adrenergic binding sites in the myometrium (i.e. the number of membrane-bound and cytosolic binding sites per mg protein). However, significant changes were found in the total number of binding sites; these were associated with the hormone-induced tissue hypertrophy. In myometrium from ovariectomized-alone rats, approximately 50% of beta-adrenergic binding sites were present in the cytosolic fraction. Oestradiol treatment, either on its own or in combination with progesterone, resulted in the translocation of binding sites to the cell membrane. However, in the absence of progesterone only 33% of the membrane-bound binding sites bound the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoprenaline, with a high affinity, suggesting that the majority of these membrane-bound binding sites represented non-functional beta-adrenoceptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "80": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. Unlike reentrant supraventricular tachycardia and malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias, for which highly effective and safe nonpharmacologic therapies are available, the treatment of AF remains controversial and often problematic. Whereas electrical cardioversion restores sinus rhythm in most patients with AF, the maintenance of sinus rhythm often requires membrane-active antiarrhythmic drugs that may increase mortality by inducing ventricular proarrhythmia. The control of ventricular response rate, often associated with oral anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic complications, is an alternative strategy in AF management. The relative efficacy and risks of these strategies and their respective role in different patient subgroups remain to be established. This article focuses on newer developments in the management of AF, including prospects for improved methods to maintain sinus rhythm, newer approaches to rate control, controversies regarding the use of oral anticoagulation, and novel nonpharmacologic therapies. These newer developments may lead over the next 10 years to a revolution in the management of AF as profound as that produced over the last 10 years by nonpharmacologic therapy of other arrhythmias.", 
    "81": "Glucagon receptors (GRs) and beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) stimulate adenylate cyclase (AC) via Gs. The present study was performed to determine whether different cAMP-generating receptors share the same pool of Gs. In hepatocytes and liver plasma membranes from partially hepatectomized male rats, glucagon was more potent in stimulating AC than beta-adrenergic agonists, but the effects of glucagon and beta agonists on AC activity were not additive. This suggests that GRs and beta-ARs share the same pathway. Glucagon lowered the affinity of beta agonists for beta-ARs in the presence of GTP gamma S, whereas beta agonists had no effect on glucagon binding to GRs regardless of the presence or the absence of GTP gamma S. Therefore, the pool of Gs coupled to GRs appears to include that coupled to beta-ARs. The alpha subunit of Gs (Gs alpha) exists in small (Gs alpha-S) and large (Gs alpha-L) forms. Recently, with a new method that uses tryptic digestion, the G protein coupled to beta-ARs was identified as Gs-L in partially hepatectomized male rat livers because beta-adrenergic agonists promoted trypsinization of Gs alpha-L but not of Gs alpha-S. By contrast, the present study showed that glucagon enhanced the sensitivity of the two Gs alpha isoforms to trypsin in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that GRs are coupled to both Gs alpha-S and Gs alpha-L. In conclusion, GRs share a common Gs-L with beta-ARs but are also coupled to another Gs, Gs-S, in partially hepatectomized male rat livers.", 
    "82": "A randomized study was performed on 70 patients undergoing elective coronary bypass grafting to examine whether the combined infusion of the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (10 micrograms/kg per hour) and the beta 1-blocker metopropol (12 micrograms/kg per hour, n = 34) reduces the prevalence of perioperative myocardial ischemia and arrhythmias. The control group received nifedipine alone (n = 36). In both groups the infusion was started from the onset of extracorporal circulation and maintained over a period of 24 hours. Repeated 12-lead electrocardiographic and 3-channel Holter monitor recordings for 48 hours were used to define perioperative myocardial ischemia (transient ischemic event, myocardial infarction) and arrhythmias (sinus tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, atrial flutter/fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia). Hemodynamic parameters were repeatedly assessed for 24 hours and serum enzyme levels (creatine kinase, MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase) for up to 36 hours after the operation. The two groups did not differ significantly with respect to preoperative anamnestic and surgical data. No signs of perioperative myocardial infarction were detected in either group. However, a significantly lower incidence of transient ischemic episodes was observed in the nifedipine-metoprolol group than in the nifedipine group (3% vs 11%; p < 0.05). In addition, there was a tendency toward lower creatine kinase MB levels and peak values of creatine kinase and creatine kinase MB in the nifedipine-metoprolol group. With regard to perioperative arrhythmias, there was a significantly lower incidence of sinus tachycardia and atrial flutter/fibrillation in the nifedipine-metoprolol group (9% and 6%) than in the nifedipine group (33% and 27%, p < 0.05). In addition, postoperative heart rate was lower in the nifedipine-metoprolol group starting from the sixth hour after release of the aortic crossclamp (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). No other hemodynamic parameters showed significant differences between the two groups and all returned to preoperative levels within 24 hours. In conclusion, perioperative application of nifedipine and metoprolol in patients undergoing elective coronary bypass grafting reduces the prevalence of perioperative myocardial ischemia and arrhythmias without significant negative inotropic effects. The combined infusion of the two drugs appears superior to nifedipine alone in preventing perioperative myocardial ischemia and reducing reperfusion-induced arrhythmias.", 
    "83": "The axonal membranes from dog mesenteric nerves were isolated and characterized. They had a high density of [3H]saxitoxin, [3H]rauwolscine and [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding sites, but low densities of [125I] omega-conotoxin (GVIA) and [3H]prazosin binding sites. The microsomal membranes had one of the higher densities of [3H]rauwolscine binding sites in centrifugation fractions. These sites were characterized by saturation, kinetic and competition studies. In competition with oxymetazoline, WB 4101, prazosin, ARC-239, SK&F 104078 and SK&F 104856, these rauwolscine binding sites were alpha 2A-like. Chloroethylclonidine pretreatment did not affect the ability of SK&F 104078 or SK&F 104856 to compete with rauwolscine binding sites on axonal membranes. Bmax values were unchanged by chloroethylclonidine under conditions that also failed to reduce Bmax values of rauwolscine binding to membranes from human platelets. These receptors appear to be alpha 2A adrenoceptors and may represent sites of prejunctional control of neurotransmitter release in the dog. This membrane preparation may be useful in biochemical studies of prejunctional neural receptors.",

    "90": "(+)-Bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation, a commonly used marker of hepatic CYP2D6 activity, was investigated in human and rhesus monkey intestinal microsomes and compared with that in hepatic microsomes. The cumene hydroperoxide (CuOOH)-mediated metabolism of (+)-bufuralol suggested that at least two enzymes were responsible for bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation in both human and monkey intestinal microsomes. In contrast, the kinetics of the CuOOH-mediated metabolism in human and monkey livers were monophasic. The Km values for the higher affinity component of the intestinal enzyme(s) of both species were similar to, while the corresponding Vmax values were much lower than, those obtained with the livers. Bufuralol metabolism mediated by NADPH exhibited biphasic kinetics and was less efficient than that observed in the presence of CuOOH in both human and monkey intestines, in agreement with the observations in the livers. Inhibition of bufuralol hydroxylase activity in the intestine and liver preparations from the same species by known CYP2D6 inhibitors/substrates was qualitatively similar. Quinidine was the most potent inhibitor of (+)-bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation in all tissues studied. Western immunoblots using anti-CYP2D6 peptide antibody revealed a protein band in human and monkey intestinal microsomes of the same molecular weight as that observed in the liver preparations. The intestinal CYP2D protein content appeared to be much less than that of liver, and correlated with the (+)-bufuralol hydroxylase activity. Immunoinhibition studies indicated significant (up to 50%) inhibition of the CuOOH-mediated (+)-bufuralol metabolism in human and monkey intestines only by anti-CYP2D6, and not by anti-CYP2A6, or anti-CYP2E1. Inhibition of the bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase activity by anti-rat CYP3A1 was only slight (20%) in human, but marked (60-65%) in monkey intestinal microsomes. The hepatic metabolism of (+)-bufuralol in humans and monkeys was only inhibited (75%) by anti-CYP2D6, but not by anti-CYP3A1. Overall, the results suggest that (1) tissue and species differences exist in the catalysis of (+)-bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation, and (2) CYP2D6-related enzymes are partially or primarily responsible for the bufuralol hydroxylase activity in human and monkey intestines or monkey liver.", 
    "91": "In patients with variceal bleeding as a complication of hepatic cirrhosis, propranolol therapy reduces the risk of recurrent variceal haemorrhage. However, the relation between portal pressure response to pharmacological treatment and clinical events has not been well defined. This relation was prospectively investigated in 69 cirrhotic patients receiving continued propranolol therapy after an episode of variceal bleeding. Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was measured before and at 3 months of continued drug therapy. At 3 months HVPG had fallen by 20% or more in 25 patients. During follow-up of 28 (SD 17) months rebleeding occurred in 2 of these 25 patients compared with 23 of 44 who had lesser reductions in HVPG. Cumulative probability of rebleeding at 1, 2, and 3 years was 4%, 9%, and 9% in patients with a decrease in HVPG > or = 20%, and 28%, 39%, and 66% in patients with a decrease in HVPG < 20% (p < 0.001, log-rank test). On multivariate analysis, a decrease in HVPG > or = 20% was the only independent predictor of rebleeding (relative risk 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.41. Of the 8 patients in whom the HVPG fell to 12 mm Hg or less, none rebled. This study suggests that measurement of the HVPG response to pharmacotherapy will provide useful prognostic information on the long-term risk of variceal rebleeding.", 
    "92": "We compared the phagocytosis of immune complexes (IC) and iC3b-opsonized derivatives (iC3b-IC) by human neutrophils. The phagocytosis of iC3b-IC via Fc gamma R and CR3 was much greater than that of IC via Fc gamma R alone. Adding ethanol to the cells decreased iC3b-IC phagocytosis to that of IC, which was not affected by these reagents, suggesting that the enhanced phagocytosis is attributable to CR3-mediated phospholipase D activation. The IC phagocytosis was inhibited more effectively by anti-Fc gamma IIIB, whereas the iC3b-IC phagocytosis was partly inhibited only by anti-Fc gamma RII. The main Fc gamma R might differ in IC and iC3b-IC phagocytosis.", 
    "93": "We investigated whether analysis of heart rate (HR) variability may be used to predict the efficacy of drug treatment of myocardial ischemia. In a double-blind, crossover study, 28 patients with stable angina pectoris, proven coronary artery disease, and myocardial ischemia during Holter monitoring received metoprolol controlled-release 200 mg once daily and diltiazem 60 mg 4 times daily. After a placebo run-in phase and after each treatment period, 72-hour Holter recordings were obtained for HR variability and ST-segment analysis. At baseline, the total duration of myocardial ischemia was 11.4 +/- 13.9 minutes (mean +/- SD per 24 hours), and the total number of episodes was 2.2 +/- 2.3. Metoprolol significantly reduced the total duration of ischemia by -8.7 minutes (95% CI -14.5 to -2.8) and the total number of episodes by -1.9 (-2.9 to -0.8) in patients with a low SD of normal-to-normal intervals at baseline (SDNN), using the median value of 50 ms as a cut-off value. In contrast, significant treatment effects were not observed in patients with a high SDNN at baseline. Similar results were obtained using baseline total power or low-frequency power, but not when using baseline heart rate. Diltiazem reduced the total duration of ischemia by -4.9 minutes (-9.7 to -0.1), but not the number of episodes. Moreover, in contrast to metoprolol, efficacy of diltiazem was not related to baseline HR variability. In conclusion, patients with reduced HR variability at baseline responded to treatment with metoprolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "100": "The author summarises the various origins of hand tremor. Physiologic tremor can be demonstrated in any individual. This tremor is normally recordable at a stable frequency of 8-10 Hz, though this can be influenced by age, the amplitude can vary substantially. Physiological tremor is believed to have its origin in the mechanical properties of the extremities, and the firing properties of motoneurones. Essential tremor is an inherited autosomally dominant phenomenon, and is characterised by action and postural tremor. It is progressive with age. The use of low doses of theophylline in the treatment of essential tremor is emphasised, in view of the low incidence of side effects. A hypothesis is also presented to account for essential tremor in terms of an imbalance in the activity of excitatory and inhibitory amino acid system. Parkinsonian tremor may begin as postural or resting tremor on one side, and it is reduced by active movement of the affected extremity. The prognosis of Parkinson's disease presenting with tremor is better when presenting with hypokinesia. The increasing use of non-specific drugs in the treatment of Parkinsonism, and the use of thalamic high frequency stimulation are indicated.", 
    "101": "A procedure for the concurrent determination of the (+)- and (-)-enantiomers of sotalol in plasma using high-performance liquid chromatography of diastereomeric derivatives is described. Sotalol is extracted from a 0.5-ml aliquot of plasma at pH 9.3 using ethyl acetate. Atenolol is used as the internal standard. The ethyl acetate is removed under vacuum, and the residue derivatized with R-(-)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethyl isocyanate (NEIC, 0.005% in chloroform) in the presence of trace quantities of carbonate buffer. The chloroform is removed, the residue reconstituted in mobile phase (acetonitrile-water, 39:61, v/v), and an aliquot injected into the HPLC column. A C18 trapping column is used to retain excess derivatizing reagent. While the derivatives are separated on a C18 analytical column with the isocratic mobile phase mentioned above at 1.5 ml/min, the column-switching allows back-flushing of the trapping column to prepare for the next injection. The derivatives were detected using a fluorescence detector with excitation wavelength 280 nm and emission wavelength 320 nm. The method was fully validated, and shown to have excellent linearity, specificity, sensitivity, accuracy and precision. It has been applied to the determination of (+)- and (-)-sotalol in plasma from twelve subjects dosed with racemic sotalol.",

Spectral analysis of beat-to-beat fluctuations of the R-R interval (RRI), systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure in the 0.01-5-Hz range was carried out under control conditions and following a bleeding of 30% of total blood volume, with and without i.v. injection of atropine (2 mg/kg), prazosin (2 mg/kg), propranolol (5 mg/kg) or captopril (7 mg/kg). The bradycardic stage was characterized by: (i) an increase of the three oscillatory components exhibited by RRI variability which appears driven by vagal activity and buffered by beta-adrenergic activity, while the increase of the slower LF (0.01-0.2 Hz) oscillations seems driven by the slow alpha-adrenergic control; (ii) a decrease of SBP and DBP oscillations and absence of SBP-RRI correlation in the MF band (0.2-0.6 Hz) possibly related to a decrease in the sympathetic drive of SBP-MF and DBP-MF oscillations and in RRI baroreflex control; (iii) an increase in LF oscillations of SBP and even more of DBP that seems driven by the slow alpha-and beta-adrenergic control and buffered by the R-A control, responses possibly related to an increase of LF oscillations of peripheral resistance; (iv) the persistence of high SBP-RRI correlation in the LF band and in the respiratory band (1-3 Hz); the former seem to reflect the existence of a slow baroreflex control mediated by beta-adrenergic activity, the latter appears to be caused by feedforward mechanical effects of RRI changes on SBP.", 
    "103": "Ersentilide is a benzamide derivative that has been found effective in several intact animal models of arrhythmia. Cellular studies have indicated it blocks the delayed rectifier, IK, and is a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist. We used standard electrophysiologic techniques to study ersentilide's actions on canine Purkinje fiber and atrial and ventricular myocardium. Ersentilide had no effect on maximum diastolic potential, action potential amplitude or Vmax of any of those tissues. Neither did it affect normal Purkinje fiber automaticity. Ersentilide prolonged action potential duration and effective refractory period, and prolonged the duration of Ca(2+)-dependent 'slow response' action potentials. It also suppressed abnormal automaticity in Ba2+ superfused fibers and attenuated isoproterenol-induced automaticity. Although ersentilide increased the magnitude of digitalis-induced delayed afterdepolarizations it neither increased nor suppressed the incidence of digitalis-induced arrhythmias in intact dogs. Because it selectively prolongs action potential duration and refractoriness and induces beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade, ersentilide warrants further consideration as an antiarrhythmic agent.", 
    "104": "The present study examined the role of monoaminergic systems in mediating the c-fos response to stress in the mouse brain. Mice were pretreated with various monoamine receptor antagonists prior to immobilization stress and were assayed for c-fos immunohistochemically throughout the brain. It was found that the alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, prazosin significantly reduced the response in 10/12 telencephalic, 2/6 diencephalic and 4/5 brainstem regions and that the beta-1 adrenergic antagonist, betaxolol reduced it in 6/12 telencephalic, 1/6 diencephalic and 015 brainstem regions. The effects of these drugs were not due to nonspecific depressions of neuronal activity as several brain regions with high fos responses were unaffected. Nor were they due to sedation as the drugs did not affect rotorod performance. Neither the brta-2 adrenergic blocker, ICI118,551, the D1/D2 receptor blocker, fluphenazine, the 5HT1A antagonist, WAY 100135, nor the 5HT2 antagonist, ketanserin, produced a clear pattern of effects on the response. It is concluded that of the monoaminergic systems, the noradrenergic is the one most involved in the central fos response to immobilization stress in the mouse brain and that the response is mediated by a mixture of alpha-1 and beta-1 receptors.",

The drugs were instilled twice daily for 5 days. Changes in intraocular pressure (IOP), pupil size, and heart rate were recorded on days 1, 3, and 5 at 0, 2, 5, and 8 hours, starting at 8:30 AM. In clinically normal dogs, 4 and 6% topically administered timolol did not cause consistent reductions in IOP; however, with addition of 2% pilocarpine, IOP was consistently lower. In the Beagles with glaucoma, 4 and 6% timolol and, to a greater extent, 4 and 6% timolol combined with 2% pilocarpine lowered IOP. The combinations lowered IOP and reduced pupil size consistently. In all test groups, either 4 or 6% topically applied timolol caused approximately 10% decrease in mean heart rate.", 
    "106": "The distribution of the racemic and the enantiomeric content of (+/-)-metoprolol was compared after ingestion of a massive fatal overdose of the racemic drug. Postmortem concentrations of the racemate in different tissues were assayed by gas chromatography after derivatization with trifluoroacetic acid anhydride. The distribution of the R- and S-enantiomers of metoprolol was analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Metoprolol was extracted from postmortem specimens and derivatized with the chiral reagent 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate. The concentrations of active S(-)-isomer in blood, liver, and stomach contents were 33 mg/L, 224 mg/kg, and 56 mg/61 g, respectively. The concentrations of inactive R(-)-enantiomer in blood, liver, and stomach contents were 33 mg/L, 222 mg/kg, and 55 mg/61 g, respectively. These results indicate that half the total postmortem tissue concentration of metoprolol is the R-enantiomer, which is devoid of any beta-blocker activity.", 
    "107": "The main reason for treating arterial hypertension is obviously to reduce hypertension-induced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Numerous studies have demonstrated a preventive effect against stroke when elevated blood pressure has been lowered by pharmacological intervention. A preventive effect of such therapy has also been shown with regard to coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the issue here is much less clear, perhaps because diuretics have been the main therapy in the majority of the large intervention trials. There are reasons to believe that newer therapy, e.g., the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, would be more effective in preventing CHD in hypertensive patients. Some of this evidence will be reviewed in this paper.", 
    "108": "Two hundred and ninety four pairs of Swedish twins reared apart and twins reared together were used to evaluate the importance of genetic and environmental influences on lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels. Lp(a) levels ranged from <10 mg/l to 926 mg/l with 7.9% of the sample having undetectable Lp(a) levels (i.e. <10 mg/l). A substantial genetic component in Lp(a) variation was indicated by a heritability estimate of approximately 90%. No difference in heritability was found across age groups. Quantitative genetic analyses also suggest correlated environmental effects most likely composed of maternal, neonatal and postnatal environmental influences. However, these effects did not reach statistical significance, partly due to a lack of power. Results from analyses of co-twin differences in Lp(a) levels for monozygotic twins indicate that sex hormone use may be of importance for Lp(a) variation in women. There was no evidence of potential influences of alcohol consumption, beta-blocker and diuretic administration on Lp(a) levels in either men or women.",

The relationship of permeability of the aqueous boundary layer and hydrodynamic stirring was elucidated from transmonolayer fluxes of testosterone. Adrenergic receptor antagonists including propranolol (PPL), alprenolol (APL), pindolol (PDL), and atenolol (ATL) represented the model series of structurally similar weak bases with pKa values between 8.8 and 9.65. Although intrinsically lipophilic, their apparent log PC (n-octanol/water) at pH 7.4 and 6.5 ranged from -2.6 to 1.3. Effective permeability coefficients (Pe) correlated with log PC at both pH 7.4 and 6.5 showing a single sigmoidal-like curve: PPL > APL > PDL > or = ATL. The Pe approached a minimum plateau value established by the protonated ATL for the paracellular route (pore radius of 12 A) by molecular size-restricted diffusion within a negative electrostatic field of force. The Pe of the weak bases was delineated into component permeability coefficients of the aqueous boundary layer and porous filter support, the intrinsic permeabilities of charged and uncharged species for the transcellular and paracellular routes, and the extent to which the routes were utilized at each pH. This study emphasized a generally applicable approach to quantitatively analyze passive transport data on weak organic electrolytes and neutral molecules generated using cell culture monolayers.", 
    "110": "In order to further examine the mechanism of the increase in the plasma propranolol concentration versus time curve (AUC) caused by ingestion of propranolol with food, we administered R, S-propranolol tablets (0.5 mg kg-1) orally to healthy human volunteers and dogs in the presence and absence of sensory exposure to food without ingestion (teasing). Six healthy human volunteers were fasted on one occasion and on the other they were presented with an appetising meal, without eating it (teasing protocol). There was a strong trend to a greater propranolol AUC in the teasing protocol (139 +/- 54 mg mL-1 h-1 fasting, 178 +/- 105 mg mL-1 h-1 teasing; p = 0.1), and time of peak concentration (tmax) was significantly prolonged (80 +/- 22 min and 120 +/- 32 min, respectively; p < 0.03). Further studies were carried out in dogs who received R-propranolol (2 mg kg-1) as an oral solution by gavage tube on four different occasions: fasting, following intragastric administration of a high-value liquid meal, following teasing with food in the animal house at normal feeding time (high-intensity teasing). There were no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between the fasting and intragastric food protocols. Low-intensity teasing resulted in significantly lower AUC and peak concentrations (Cmax) compared with fasting (p < 0.05), confirming food effect patterns known to occur in dogs. High-intensity teasing resulted in significantly greater AUC and Cmax compared with fasting (p < 0.05), reproducing in dogs the increase in propranolol AUC known to occur with food ingestion in humans. These findings suggest that the mechanism of the 'food effect' may involve physiological responses to the sight and smell of food additional to mechanisms activated by ingestion.",

Increases of mean blood pressure and heart rate to noradrenaline (0.1-10 micrograms kg-1) and to electrical stimulation (0.5 msec, supramax V, 0.25-5 Hz) of the entire sympathetic outflow were measured in non-adrenalectomized (acute and chronic) and adrenalectomized (chronic) pithed rats. 3. Acute beta-adrenoceptor antagonist administration was without effect on mean blood pressure and heart rate increases to noradrenaline and electrical stimulation. 4. Chronic administration with oxprenolol significantly diminished the stimulation-induced increases of mean blood pressure and heart rate in non-adrenalectomized pithed rats. 5. Increases in heart rate, elicited by stimulation of the entire sympathetic outflow in non-adrenalectomized but not in adrenalectomized pithed rats, were decreased by metoprolol treatment. Both treatments were without effect on noradrenaline responses. 6. These results indicate that chronic beta-adrenoceptor antagonist treatment is associated with a reduction in the cardiovascular responses to sympathetic nerve-stimulation. However, this mechanism only operates when adrenomedullary adrenaline is present to facilitate the noradrenaline release through activation of presynaptic beta 2-adrenoceptors.",

The aim of this work was to compare digoxin and atenolol on functional class, resting and exercise heart rate and exercise capacity in patients with atrial fibrillation. Thirteen subjects with this condition, normal echocardiographic left ventricular function and size, a resting heart rate less than 80 beats/min and with no contraindication for beta blocker or digoxin use were studied. Patients were randomly assigned to receive initially digoxin 0.25 mg o.d. or atenolol 100 mg o.d. in a double blind fashion. The doses were adjusted to obtain a heart rate between 60 and 80 beats/min at the end of the first week of treatment. After two weeks of treatment, outcomes were assessed, patients were left without treatment for one week and crossed over to the other drug after that. Resting heart rates achieved with digoxin and atenolol were similar (67 +/- 11 and 65 +/- 23 beats/min respectively). However, maximal exercise heart rates and maximal exercise time were higher during digoxin treatment (166 +/- 23 vs 135 +/- 27 beats/min and 9.95 +/- 1.68 vs 8.5 +/- 2 min respectively). NYHA functional class deteriorated in three patients receiving atenolol. We conclude that atenolol achieves a better control of heart rate during exercise but also reduces maximal exercise capacity.",

All patients heart rate and blood pressure were sensitive to the first dose 1.25 mg bisoprolol and when the dose was titrated to 2.5 mg, it was effective and led to a smooth course during a 10-hour period of observation. After treatment, the patients heart function, including fractional shortening, ejection fraction and exercise ability increased significantly and both the severity and the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias decreased significantly. The response of heart rate to exercise and isoproterenol infusion tended to be normal lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptor density was increased. It is shown that bisoprolol is a promising beta-blocking agent in treating congestive heart failure. The mechanisms of its effects may be related to depression of excessive sympathetic activity, decrease of heart rate and up-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "115": "The purpose of this study was to determine the importance of inhibition of beta-adrenergic function in thiopentone-induced myocardial depression. Using an isolated, electrically stimulated rat left atria model, contractile dose-response curves to thiopentone (200 microM, 400 microM, 600 microM, 800 microM) were shifted to the right in preparations treated with 10(-3)M dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) compared with atria stimulated with 10(-6) M dibutyryl cyclic isoprenaline, demonstrating that inhibition of beta-adrenergic mechanisms by thiopentone is physiologically important. Depression by thiopentone was similar in atria treated with 10(-5) M forskolin compared with preparations stimulated with 10(-6) M isoprenaline, indicating that thiopentone does not block beta-adrenergic receptors. It is concluded that thiopentone depresses myocardial function by several mechanisms, one of which involves inhibition of the adenyl cyclase cascade. The adenyl cyclase enzyme is a likely site where thiopentone inhibits the system; however, other components of the cascade may also be involved.",

Five patients (14%) did not tolerate the drug; 30 were chronically treated with metoprolol (mean dosage 127 +/- mg/die). No differences in baseline characteristics were observed between tolerant and not tolerant patients, except for the E-deceleration time (103 +/- 42 ms vs 84 +/- 17 ms; p<0.05).

A decrease in the inflammation was shown in a series of the experiments with the dermonecrotic test using mono- and mixed cultures of Staphylococcus aureuo, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli at the background of the animal treatment with anapriline and heparin. The effect of mezatone and dicinone was the opposite one. The drugs had different effects on the host response to the introduction of microorganisms of various species as mono- and mixed cultures. The experiments on a group of animals with wound infection not subjected to the preliminary alteration of the tissues demonstrated that the treatment with gentamicin and anapriline combinations was more efficient than the gentamicin monotherapy. The use of anapriline improved the antibiotic pharmacokinetics, had a favourable effect on the wound reparation, promoted a decrease in the count of viable microbes in the wound secretion and increased the antibiotic concentration gradient.", 
    "121": "To clarify the beta-1 selectivity of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents (beta-blocking agents) after typical oral doses, the relationships between the effects on exercise heart rate or FEV1 and beta-1 or beta-2 receptor occupancies (phi 1, phi 2) of seven beta-blocking agents, acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol, oxprenolol, timolol, propranolol, and pindolol were analyzed retrospectively. Nonlinear relationships between the pharmacologic effect and phi 1 and between the pulmonary adverse effect and phi 2 were obtained. Based on these findings, a new index of cardiovascular selectivity is proposed, given by the ratio of beta-1 receptor occupancy to beta-2 receptor occupancy (phi 1/phi 2). Using this new index, there was a little difference in beta-1 selectivity between acebutolol and pindolol (3.1:1.0), in contrast to a marked difference in beta-1 selectivity (320:1) as a conventional index between these two drugs. This finding indicates that even beta-1 selective drugs must be administered carefully to patients with pulmonary disease. Furthermore, the relationship between the pharmacologic or pulmonary effects and phi 1 or phi 2 has been analyzed quantitatively with a ternary complex model and used to develop rational dosage regimens for beta-1 selective beta-blocking agents, such as atenolol, to obtain the desired pharmacologic effects with minimum adverse pulmonary effects.", 
    "122": "In vitro studies were conducted to identify the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) forms involved in the oxidative metabolism of [14C]zileuton (ABT-077) and its N-dehydroxylated metabolite, [14C]Abbott-66193, by human liver microsomes. The two compounds were metabolized by parallel pathways to form the corresponding ring-hydroxylated and diastereomer sulfoxide metabolites. Results suggested that whereas the metabolism of zileuton and Abbott-66193 were mediated by the same CYP forms, the CYP forms responsible for hydroxylation (CYP1A2 and CYP2C9/10) were distinct from those involved in sulfoxidation (CYP3A > CYP2C9/10). Sulfoxidation (zileuton, Km = 0.82 +/- 0.40 mM, Vmax = 39.1 +/- 21.8 pmol/min/mg; Abbott-66193, Km = 0.23 +/- 0.06 mM, Vmax = 507 +/- 215 pmol/min/mg; mean +/- SD, N=3) was highly correlated with the CYP3A-specific erythromycin N-demethylase activity (r=0794-0.856; p<0.01, N=11) in human microsomes and was inhibited (32-67%) by ketoconazole and troleandomycin. In addition, purified recombinant human CYP3A4/rat NADPH-P450 reductase fusion protein catalyzed only the sulfoxidation of zileuton and Abbott-66193; no hydroxylated metabolites were detected. On the other hand, hydroxylation of the two compounds (zileuton, Km = 0.34 +/- 0.25 mM, Vmax = 17.8 +/- 5.58 pmol/min/mg; Abbott-66193,Km = 0.39 +/- 0.14 mM, Vmax = 1061 +/- 220 pmol/min/mg) was significantly correlated with 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (CYP1A2; r=0.652-0.762; p<0.01, N=11) and tolbutamide methyl hydroxylase (CYP2C9/10; r=0.863-0.935; p<0.01, N=10) activity in human liver microsome, and was inhibited (26-51%) by well-known CYP1A2 inhibitors (furafylline and alpha-naphthoflavone). Furthermore, microsomes from human B-lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP1A2 catalyzed only the hydroxylation of zileuton and Abbott-66193; sulfoxide were not formed. Abbott-66193 was a better substrate for CYP2C9/10, when compared with zileuton: 1) the effect of sulfaphenazole on hydroxylation in human liver microsomes was more pronounced for Abbott-66193 than zileuton (56% vs. 9% inhibition); and 2) the rate of Abbott-66193 hydroxylation by purified CYP2C9 was almost 30-fold greater than that of zilueton.", 
    "123": "1. The present study addresses the possibility of the existence of different kinin B2 receptor subtypes in the guinea-pig by evaluating the affinity of peptide and nonpeptide receptor antagonists. For this purpose, jugular vein rings, ileum segments, lung parenchymal and trachea strips were set up in organ baths for isometric tension measurements. The experiments were conducted in the presence o indomethacin (3 microM), atropine (10 microM) and captopril (10 microM). 2. BK contracted jugular vein (JV), ileum (GPI), parenchyma (LP) and trachea (GPT) with an EC50 of 13.2 +/- 1.4 nM (n=27), 11.2 +/- 2.1 (n=26), 23.6 +/- 6.3 (n=26), and 33.0 +/- 6.5 (n=27), respectively. Thiorphan, a neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.34.11) inhibitor and MERGETPA (DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid), a carboxypeptidase inhibitor, had no effect on the BK-induced contractions of JV, GPI and LP. In the GPT, thiorpan potentiated the contractile response to BK and was thus added in the corresponding experiments. 3. The peptide B2 receptor antagonist, Hoe 140 and the nonpeptide compound, WIN 64338, behaved as noncompetitive antagonists against contractile responses to cumulative BK in the four tissues although Hoe 140 appeared as a competitive inhibitor in the GPT only. IN order to compare the inhibitory potency of these compounds between tissues, pKB values were determined. Mean values of pKB for Hoe 140 were 8.05 +/- 0.07, 8.43 +/- 0.11, 8.13 +/- 0.18, and 8.52 +/- 0. 25 in the JV, GPI, GPT and LP, respectively. WIN 64338 gave mean pKB values of 6.89 +/- 0.10, 7.57 +/- 0.12, 7.36 +/- 0.12 adn 7.51 +/- 0.28 in the JV, GPI, LP and GPT, respectively. 4. D-Arg [Hyp3, D-Phe7, Leu8]BK and D-Arg[Hyp3, D-Phe7]BK (NPC 567) inhibited in a competitive fashion the concentration-response curves to BK. Values of pA2for each compound were not significantly different in the four tissues and were between 5.81 and 6.31 for D-Arg [Hyp3, D-Phe7, Leu8]BK and between 5.55 and 5.65 for NPC 567.", 
    "124": "1. The effect of mastoparan on phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis was examined in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells. Mastoparan (3-30 microM) caused an accumulation of diacylglycerol (DG) and phosphatidic acd (PA) accompanied by choline release in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. 2. In the presence of 2% n-butanol, mastoparan (3-100 microM) induced phosphatidylbutanol (PBut) accumulation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, suggesting that mastoparan activates phospholipase D (PLD). Propranolol (30-300 microM), a phosphatidate phosphohydrolase inhibitor, inhibited DG accumulation induced by mastoparan, supporting this idea. 3. Depletion of extracellular free calcium ion did not alter the effect of mastoparan on PLD activity. 4. A protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, calphostin C (1 microM), did not inhibit mastoparan-induce PLD activation but the ability of mastoparan to stimulate phospholipase D activity was decreased in the PKC down regulated cells. 5. PLD activity stimulated by mastoparan was not prevented by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin (PT) or C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase. Furthermore, guanine nucleotides did not affect PLD activity stimulation by mastoparan in membrane preparations. 6. Mastoparan stimulated PLD in several cell lines such as RBL-2H3, RBL-1, HL-60, P388, endothelial cells, as well as 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells. 7. These results suggest that mastoparan induces phosphatidylcholine (PC) hydrolysis by activation of PLD, not by activation of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC); mastoparan-induced PLD activation is not mediated by G proteins.", 
    "125": "1. The effects of SR 33589 and amiodarone on the cardiac beta-adrenoceptor were studied in vitro and after chronic treatment by means of [125I]-(-)-iodocyanopindolol ([125I]-(-)-CYP) binding and measurement of adenylate cyclase activity. 2. Binding of [125I]-(-)-CYP was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by SR 33589 (IC50=1.8 +/- 0.4 microM, nH=0.93 +/- 0.06) and amiodarone (IC50=8.7 +/- 2.0 microM, nH=9.2 +/- 0.03). Saturation binding experiments indicated a non-competitive interaction such that SR 33589 (1 and 3 microM) and amiodarone (5 and 10 microM) reduced the Bmax of [125I]-(-)-CYP binding without any effect on the KD. Kinetic studies showed that the rate of association of [125I]-(-)-CYP was unchanged while the rate of dissociation was increased both in the presence of SR 33589 (10 microM) and amiodarone (30 microM).3. Under the same conditions, the receptor stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent, but non-competitive manner, by SR 33589 (isoprenaline-, glucagon- and secretin-stimulated enzyme inhibited 50% at 6.8 +/- 0.6 microM, 31 +/- 10 microM and 12 +/- 3 microM, respectively) while the basal, GTP- and GPP(NH)p-stimulated enzyme was inhibited by 5-10% and the NaF and forskolin-stimulated enzyme by 50% at 500 microM. Amiodarone exhibited a similar pattern of inhibition. 4. After chronic oral treatment (50, 100, 150 mg kg(-1) per day, 14 days), both SR 33589 and amiodarone produced a dose-dependent decrease in Bmax without any effect on KD as determined from [125I]-(-)-CYP saturation experiments and a decrease of the isoprenaline- and glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity without any effect on basal enzyme activity or activity when stimulated by agents acting directly on regulatory catalytic units. 5. Unlike amiodarone, SR 33589 does not contain iodine substituents. Plasma levels of T3, T4, and rT3 were changed after SR 33589 treatment except a decrease in T4 level at the highest dose whilst the T4 T3 ratio and the level of rT3 were dose-dependently increased by amiodarone treatment. 6. In vitro, SR 33589 and amiodarone were characterized as non-competitive beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Chronic treatment led to a down-regulation of the beta-adrenoceptor; the down-regulation cannot be attributed to an indirect effect mediated by the thyroid hormones. To reconcile these opposing observations, we propose that SR 33589 and amiodarone interact with the beta-adrenoceptor at a site close to the intracellular loops which are involved in the coupling with Gs and contain the phosphorylable sites.", 
    "126": "We investigated the effects of cocaine and corticosterone on the noradrenaline-induced relaxation of rat oesophageal smooth muscle in the absence and presence of the selective beta2-antagonist, ICI 111,551. It was found that the concentration-response curve (CRC) of noradrenaline was not shifted by ICI 118,551 at 1 microM, whereas a clear shift to the right was observed at 100 microM of the antagonist. In the presence of corticosterone (10 microM), CRC's were clearly shifted to the left; with cocaine (10 microM) additionally present, a further leftward shift was observed, indicating the involvement of both neuronal and extraneuronal uptake sites. It was concluded that the relaxation of rat oesophageal muscularis mucosae by noradrenaline is solely mediated by beta3-adrenoceptors which are sympathetically innervated.", 
    "127": "To study the possible transport routes which may lead to the presence of a drug in saliva, the concentration-time curves of the separate enantiomers of propranolol were measured in human saliva and plasma after oral administration of 10 mg of propranolol hydrochloride. Saliva samples were taken with the Salivette device. Plasma and saliva concentrations of the enantiomers of propranolol were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. The transport of propranolol from plasma to the salivary gland appears to be not stereospecific and not saturable. Therefore, there is no indication that the transport of propranolol to the salivary gland is active. The concentrations of both enantiomers of propranolol in saliva, however, were higher than those of both enantiomers in venous plasma. In the past this phenomenon was interpreted as an indication of active transport, but it could be explained by the fact that salivary concentration more closely reflects the central compartment than that of peripheral venous blood.", 
    "128": "A 1H NMR spectroscopic method with chiral shift chelate is presented for the determination of the optical purity of timolol maleate. Optimum experimental conditions were established by studying the interactions of solvents (CCl4, CDCl3), substrate concentration, and the type and concentration of chiral lanthanide chelate (Pr(hfc)3, Eu(hfc)3). Larger induced shift (delta delta) and enantiomeric shift difference (delta delta delta) values, and more detailed spectral differences were obtained with Pr(hfc)3 than with Eu(hfc)3. By monitoring the spectral changes of the resonance signals for the enantiomeric -C(CH3)3 protons, suitable conditions for quantitative determinations were found when 0.1 molar equivalents of Pr(hfc)3 were complexed with 0.074 M of substrate. Enantiomeric compositions were calculated from the relative intensities of the enantiomeric -C(CH3)3 proton resonances. Based on the analysis of six synthetic enantiomeric mixtures, the mean +/- SD recovery of (R)-(+)-timolol by the proposed method was 99.5 +/- 1.17% of the amount added.", 
    "129": "The solid phase extraction (SPE) and elution of [14C]-propranolol from aqueous buffer has been studied for a range of phenyl-bonded SPE materials. Differences were noted in the recovery of the analyte using methanol-water eluents depending upon the manufacturer and whether or not phase had been endcapped. Efficient recoveries of [14C]-propranolol were only achieved when triethylamine was added to the eluting solvent as a competing base. Solid state cross polarisation/magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) NMR spectroscopy was used to characterise the phases further, which revealed differences in endcapping between materials as well as differences in the type and extent of cross-linking.", 
    "130": "An assist device was developed which is able to support the pumping function of the heart by direct application of pressure to the left ventricle. The goal of this animal study in pigs was to determine whether it is possible to maintain sufficient blood circulation with the aid of the new system when the heart is fibrillating or its capacity has been greatly reduced. Following sternotomy complete invasive monitoring was installed. The intrathoracic implantable mechanical multi-chamber pump system (IMPS) was placed around the left ventricle. By means of the beta-blocker carazolol, systolic left-ventricular pressure (LVPsys), cardiac output, heart rate, and left-ventricular dp/dtmax (LVdp/dtmax) were gradually lowered and the pump system was tested intermittently. Then the heart was fibrillated and the system was tested again. When cardiac output, LVdp/dtmax, and systolic blood pressure were reduced by approximately 50% IMPS was able to increase LVPsys by 83% (IMPS) on: 96 +/- 9 mmHg vs. IMPS off: 63 +/- 6 mmHg), and the blood pressure in the carotid artery by 86% (IMPS on: 95/40 +/-15 mmHg vs. IMPS off: 69/38 +/- 9 mmHg). The mean cardiac output was 64% (IMPS on: 4.3 L/min vs. IMPS off: 3.9L/min); in most cases a great variability could be observed depending on the preload, the heart rate, and the mode of pressure application. When the heart was fibrillating, IMPS was able to maintain adequate circulatory conditions with LVPsys = 88%, blood pressure in the carotid artery = 85%, and LVdp/dtmax = 57% of the control values measured before fibrillation and beta-blockade. The system presented here is able to support the impaired left ventricle and to replace its pumping function. The advantages of the system are its efficiency and the lack of contact of the circulating blood with foreign surfaces. Whether the system is suited for bridging and recovery support shall be clarified in further studies.", 
    "131": "The inhibitory effects of nonoxynol-9, DL- and D-propranolol upon human sperm motility were determined in vitro. All three compounds were capable of causing complete cessation of sperm movement. However, greater efficacy was achieved using combinations of nonoxynol-9 and propranolol, suggesting a complementary interaction between these compounds. Investigations of the mechanism of action of propranolol revealed that an influx of calcium accompanied the loss of motility. However, since incubation in the absence of calcium enhanced the spermicidal effects of this compound, it was concluded that this calcium influx did not constitute the primary means by which motility was disrupted. Low doses of propranolol, which did not affect motility, were found to inhibit the capacity of human spermatozoa for sperm-oocyte fusion.", 
    "132": "The inhibitory effects of nonoxynol-9, DL-, and D-propranolol upon human sperm motility were determined in vitro. Semen samples were obtained from a panel of over 50 donors exhibiting normal semen profiles. At the higher concentration of 500 mcM, DL-propranolol caused a significant (p 0.01) suppression of motility within 15 minutes of addition. At a dose of 50 mcg/ml, nonoxynol-9 caused a significant (p 0.01) reduction of motility within 30 minutes of addition. At a concentration of 500 mcg/ml, nonoxynol-9 completely abolished all sperm movement within 1 minute of addition. In contrast, D-propranolol at a concentration of 5 mcM caused a significant (p 0.01) reduction in percentage motility over an incubation period of 120 minutes. A similar response profile to that expressed in the presence of 5 mcM D-propranolol was found for 50 mcM of this compound. In view of the apparent complementary effects between DL-propranolol and nonoxynol-9 in the suppression of sperm movement, a study was undertaken of the interaction between nonoxynol-9 and D-propranolol in the disruption of sperm motility. When added at a concentration of 300 mcg/ml, nonoxynol-9 had a slight, insignificant suppressive effect on seminal sperm motility within 20 seconds of drug addition. D-propranolol at a dose of 850 mcM significantly (p 0.01) inhibited sperm movement within 20 seconds, although approximately 20% of cells were still motile after this time. However, when both drugs were added together at these concentrations, motility was reduced almost to zero within this short incubation period. To investigate the mechanism of action of DL-propranolol, intracellular calcium levels were analyzed using the fluorescent probe Quin-2. The suppression of motility caused by a concentration of 500 mcM of this compound was associated with a concomitant increase in the free calcium content of these spermatozoa. At a dose of 100 mcM, this reagent significantly (p 0.05) inhibited the ability to penetrate hamster oocytes, while having no significant inhibitory effect on sperm motility.", 
    "133": "The effects of the venom of the Sahara sand viper (Cerastes vipera) were studied on isolated chick biventer cervicis, isolated rat atria and vas deferens preparations, and on the electrocardiogram of anaesthetized rats. Effects on 3H-noradrenaline uptake were studied using rat brain synaptosomes. At 50 micrograms/ml and 100 micrograms/ml, the venom caused a transient increase in rate and force of contractions of the rat atria followed by an irreversible depression. These effects were not prevented by atenolol, atropine or a combination of the two. In the presence of 25 microM lignocaine, the effects of venom on rat atria were reversible by washing. At 100 micrograms/ml, the venom transiently increased responses of vas deferens preparations to indirect stimulation, but had little effect on responses to noradrenaline, KCl, and ATP. In the presence of an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist (prazosin) or a P2-purinergic receptor antagonist (suramin), the venom still significantly increased twitch height and responses to noradrenaline but not to KCl or ATP. The effect of the venom did not change after exposure to a combination of prazosin, suramin and tetrodotoxin. The venom (100 micrograms/ml) significantly decreased twitches to indirect and direct stimulation in chick biventer cervicis preparations. Responses to exogenously applied acetylcholine, carbachol and KCl were also decreased. Venom blocked the synaptosomal uptake of 3H-noradrenaline (IC50 = 5 micrograms/ml), and caused severe bradycardia in vivo. Some of the direct effects on muscle preparations are possibly due to the venom's phospholipase A2 activity.", 
    "134": "The effects of the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist flesinoxan on neuroendocrine function, temperature, and behavior were assessed in male healthy volunteers using a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. Flesinoxan (7 and 14 micrograms/kg), administered intravenously in 11 healthy volunteers, elicited a dose-related decrease in body temperature and increases in growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and prolactin plasma levels. In a second independent study, 12 healthy volunteers were pretreated sequentially, at one-week intervals, with either the 5-HT1A antagonist pindolol (30 mg, PO), the nonselective 5-HT1/2 antagonist methysergide (4 mg, PO), or placebo, prior to being administered flesinoxan (1 mg, IV). The growth hormone response to flesinoxan was blocked by pindolol but not by methysergide, whereas the prolactin response was blocked by methysergide but not by pindolol. The ACTH and cortisol responses to flesinoxan were potentiated by methysergide. The flesinoxan-induced hypothermia was attenuated by both methysergide and pindolol, although the latter effects did not reach statistical significance. The present results suggest that the growth hormone response and the hypothermic response to the intravenous infusion of flesinoxan may serve as a valid index of 5-HT1A receptor function in humans."
