The tremors could not be controlled with antiparkinsonian agents. Metoprolol may prove to be an effective alternative in managing such side effects as tremors. The possible mechanisms of action are discussed.", 
    "1": "The effect beta blockers (BB) may have on the sensitivity of the thallium treadmill test (Th-TMT) is controversial. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that BB decrease the sensitivity of the Th-TMT. Two hundred three patients over a two-year period were identified who satisfied the following criteria. All had symptom-limited upright treadmill exercise tests with stress and redistribution thallium imaging, as well as coronary angiography within two months of the Th-TMT. Of 58 patients with CAD not on BB, 52 had an abnormal Th-TMT scan (sensitivity 90 percent). In comparison, the sensitivity of the Th-TMT scan in the 88 patients with CAD receiving BB was 76 percent (p less than 0.05). We conclude that BB may significantly decrease the sensitivity of the Th-TMT. Physicians should fully appreciate the higher false negative rate (24 vs 10 percent) for patients on BB and consider cautious withdrawal prior to diagnostic studies.", 
    "2": "The alpha-adrenergic agonists phenylephrine and methoxamine, at concentrations that have little effect on pineal N-acetyltransferase activity, markedly enhance stimulation of this enzyme by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). This augmentation can be blocked by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonists phenoxybenzamine and prazosin and, at 10 but not 1 microM, by the alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine. The time course for VIP stimulation is not altered by concomitant alpha-adrenergic stimulation. Augmented activity does not require concomitant alpha-adrenergic stimulation, but alpha-adrenergic agonists must be present for augmentation to be maintained. Phorbol 12,13-diacetate or -dibutyrate but not 4 alpha-phorbol can substitute for phenylephrine, a finding suggesting that protein kinase C is involved in the augmentation. These results are, in general, analogous to alpha-adrenergic magnification of N-acetyltransferase induction by beta-adrenergic agonists.", 
    "3": "Rats dehydrated for up to 8 days were given propranolol hydrochloride into the left brain ventricle in a daily dose of 10 micrograms. In euhydrated rats the single dose of propranolol diminished significantly the vasopressin content in neurohypophysis. In animals dehydrated for two days, the depletion of the neurohypophysial vasopressin storage was less marked under conditions of treatment with propranolol. At the fourth and eighth day of deprivation of water, propranolol did not modify the decrease of neurohypophysial vasopressin due to stimulation of osmodetectors.", 
    "4": "1. The effect of the opioid peptides [Met5]enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 (MEAP) and [Met5]enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 (MEAGL) were compared with those of [Leu5]enkephalin and [D-Ala2,Met5]enkephalinamide (DAME) on cholinergic neurotransmission in the rabbit isolated atria. 2. Rabbit isolated atria had a resting rate of 190 beats/min. In the presence of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (0.3 mumol/l), atria responded to electrical field stimulation with a cholinergically mediated negative chronotropic response. The opioid peptides had no effect on the resting rate, but inhibited the negative chronotropic response to field stimulation. The IC50 values for inhibiting the cholinergic responses were 1.4 mumol/l for [Leu5]enkephalin (LE), 1.4 mumol/l for MEAP, 1.3 mumol/l for MEAGL and 0.2 mumol/l for DAME. Responses of a similar magnitude to exogenous acetylcholine were unaffected. 3. Thus, MEAP, MEAGL and LE had similar potencies but DAME was about seven times more potent in inhibiting cholinergic neurotransmission in the rabbit isolated atria. The site of inhibition appears to be prejunctional.", 
    "5": "The insulin effect, evaluated with the euglycaemic clamp technique, was studied before and after hypoglycaemia in 7 patients with Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes. Following an initial 2 h clamp (clamp I) hypoglycaemia was induced and 2 h later a second clamp (clamp II), identical to the former, was performed. Each subject was studied twice; during infusion with saline (placebo) or propranolol. Glucose production and disposal were studied with the 3(3H)glucose technique. During placebo infusion, hypoglycaemia elicited an insulin resistance leading to approx. 50% reduction in the steady state glucose infusion rate during clamp II as compared to clamp I (clamp I 2.58 +/- 0.32, clamp II 1.26 +/- 0.08 mg . kg-1 . min-1, p less than 0.02). The insulin resistance was prevented by infusing propranolol (clamp I 2.29 +/- 0.29, clamp II 2.85 +/- 0.56 mg . kg-1 . min-1). The posthypoglycaemic insulin resistance was due to a less pronounced insulin effect on both glucose production (clamp I 0.29 +/- 0.21, clamp II 0.86 +/- 0.19 mg . kg-1 . min-1, p less than 0.05) and glucose utilisation (clamp I 2.84 +/- 0.26, clamp II 2.13 +/- 0.23 mg . kg-1 . min-1, p less than 0.05). The insulin resistance on both glucose production and utilisation was prevented by propranolol. Thus, the present study demonstrates that hypoglycaemia elicits a prolonged insulin resistance which is due to a less pronounced effect of insulin to both inhibit splanchnic glucose production and to stimulate peripheral glucose utilisation. The insulin resistance is due to beta-adrenergic stimulation and can be prevented by propranolol.", 
    "6": "In the guinea-pig intraperitoneal administration of the Gram-negative bacterium Haemophilus influenzae induces a decrease of beta-adrenoceptor number and results in impairment of beta-adrenoceptor function in the peripheral and central airways, respectively. In the present study, the time-course of these events was studied and compared with changes in catecholamines in plasma, in organs involved in immunoregulation (spleen, thymus), and in the heart and the lung. The number of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites in peripheral lung tissue and beta-adrenoceptor function in isolated tracheal spirals were significantly decreased 3 and 4 days after administration of H. influenzae (24-33%). No significant changes were observed at day 1 and day 8. The effects on tracheal beta-adrenergic receptor function were characterized by a decrease of maximal relaxation only, whereas EC50-values were not affected. These data are indicative of an effect on the functional coupling of the receptors to the biochemical events leading to smooth muscle relaxation. No changes were observed in catecholamine concentrations in the lung, heart, and the thymus after H. influenzae-treatment. Plasma noradrenaline, though, was significantly increased at day 1 after H. influenzae. At day 8 plasma noradrenaline had returned to control levels. Interestingly, the effect on spleen noradrenaline was opposite to the effect seen in plasma. A significant decrease in spleen noradrenaline was observed after H. influenzae at days 1, 3, and 8, with a maximum of 42% at day 1. It is suggested that the decrease in spleen noradrenaline may have a causal relationship with the changes in lung beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "7": "Effects of phenylephrine on contraction and Ca-action potentials were investigated to clarify whether the alpha-adrenergic mechanism may play a role in chick ventricles. Phenylephrine increased the contractile force of the ventricles isolated from both embryonic and hatched chicks, while methoxamine did not affect their contractility. Developmental changes in the sensitivity to phenylephrine, i.e., increase with age from late embryonic to early neonatal stages, were quite similar to those to a beta-agonist, isoproterenol. The positive inotropism of phenylephrine was antagonized by phentolamine and sotalol, but not antagonized by prazosin or yohimbine. Isobutylmethylxanthine augmented the effect of phenylephrine. Maximum upstroke velocity of Ca-action potentials recorded in partially depolarized ventricles were enhanced by phenylephrine, and the enhancement was eliminated by sotalol but not by phentolamine. The results suggested that the beta-adrenergic action of phenylephrine may be involved in part of its positive inotropic effect, which is mediated by increased Ca-influx through sarcolemma. Another mechanism may also participate in the effects of phenylephrine, but may not necessarily be classified as an \"alpha-adrenergic effect\".", 
    "8": "The cerebral cortex of unstressed (handling-habituated) rats has a higher number of low affinity GABA receptors than stressed (naive) rats. Foot shock stress delivered to unstressed rats decreases the density of cortical low affinity GABA receptors to the level found in the naive animals. The effect of stress on GABA receptors is mimicked by anxiogenic beta-carbolines, both after in vitro addition (10(-6) M) to cortical membrane preparations or after the in vivo administration (20 mg/kg IP) to unstressed rats. Vice versa, benzodiazepines or anxiolytic beta-carbolines (ZK 93423, 10(-5) M) added to membranes from naive rats increase GABA binding to the level of unstressed rats and remove the decrease in the density of GABA receptors elicited by anxiogenic beta-carbolines. Rats chronically treated with the anxiogenic beta-carboline, FG 7142 (15 mg/kg IP twice a day for 10 consecutive days) have an enhanced sensitivity to punishment at 5 and 15 days after the last treatment. The behavioural effect is paralleled by a marked decrease in the total number of cortical low affinity GABA receptors. Both biochemical and behavioural effects elicited by chronic FG 7142 are prevented by the concurrent administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788. These results suggest that (a) anxiolytic beta-carbolines, like benzodiazepines, increase the GABAergic transmission, (b) acute and chronic anxiogenic beta-carboline administration, like stress, decreases GABAergic transmission. Since all these effects are antagonized by the benzodiazepine receptor blocker Ro15-1788, it is tempting to speculate that stress releases an endogenous ligand for benzodiazepine recognition sites.", 
    "9": "The distribution of specific binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol([3H]DHA) in sucrose gradients (0.2-1.75 M), containing homogenates of the cortex of rat brain, centrifuged to equilibrium (110,000 g/16 hr), was examined in controls and after treatment with antidepressant drugs. There were no significant changes in the specific binding of [3H]DHA after acute administration of desipramine (DMI, 50 mg/kg) or clorgyline (20 mg/kg), either in terms of the number of receptors or distribution in the sucrose gradient. There was a significant decrease (29%) in the number of beta-adrenoceptors after the chronic regimen with DMI, but again no apparent alteration in the density of the receptor-containing membranes, both samples having a maximum distribution at approximately 1.1 M sucrose. Non-specific binding was maximal at 0.65 M sucrose. Electron microscopy showed that the non-specific binding was largely to myelin and the fraction containing most specific binding was composed of membrane fragments. The activity of Na+ K+ ATPase had a single broad peak (maximum at 1.1 M sucrose). Thus, at the times studied, in vivo desensitisation/internalisation of cortical beta-adrenoceptors did not apparently occur following large acute doses of antidepressant drugs and furthermore the down-regulation which followed the chronic regimen with DMI did not involve migration of receptors into \"light density fractions\" which are reported to be present after acute exposure to agonists in vitro.", 
    "10": "The effects of beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulation on the peripheral circulation in 10 dogs were evaluated. All studies were done during ganglion blockade with hexamethonium. Venous capacitance was assessed by measuring mean circulatory filling pressure, venous compliance and unstressed vascular volume. Beta-2 stimulation was achieved with terbutaline (27 micrograms/min) after beta-1 blockade with metoprolol (0.75 mg/kg). At a dose of terbutaline that decreased mean aortic pressure from 80.4 +/- 3.5 to 58.9 +/- 1.9 mm Hg (P less than .01), there was no change in cardiac index (155.8 +/- 10.5 vs. 161.1 +/- 9.1 ml/kg/min) despite an increase in heart rate from 118.6 +/- 5.2 to 132.6 +/- 5.0 beats/min. Right atrial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and dP/dt did not change. Systemic vascular resistance decreased from 0.52 +/- 0.02 to 0.39 +/- 0.03 mm Hg . min . kg . ml (P less than .01). Arterial compliance increased from 0.067 +/- 0.003 to 0.088 +/- 0.007 ml/mm Hg/kg and the volume of blood shifted out of the larger arteries was 1.8 +/- 0.4 ml/kg. Mean circulatory filling pressure did not change but venous compliance decreased from 1.90 +/- 0.04 to 1.47 +/- 0.06 ml/mm Hg/kg and unstressed vascular volume increased from -14.5 +/- 0.5 to -8.4 +/- 0.5 ml/kg. Central blood volume increased from 22.8 +/- 1.1 to 27.4 +/- 2.2 ml/kg. There was an increase in total blood volume from 81.1 +/- 2.7 to 90.5 +/- 3.7 ml/kg. To determine the extent to which changes in the spleen were responsible for these observations, five dogs were studied 2 weeks after splenectomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "In the search of the most accurate animal model for studies on fat cell adrenoceptor regulation, the characterization of dog fat cell beta and alpha-2 adrenoceptor properties was carried out using selected radioligands and biological measurements of fat cell function. Moreover, the distribution of dog fat cell adrenoceptors and the functional consequences were explored in fat deposits from different anatomical locations (perirenal, omental and s.c. adipose tissue). Beta and alpha-2 adrenoceptors involved in the control of the lipolytic activity of dog fat cells exhibit pharmacological characteristics which are very similar to those defined in human adipocytes. However, in contrast with the results obtained in human adipocytes, there is a preponderance of beta over alpha-2 adrenergic binding sites, whatever the location of the fat deposits, in the dog. The higher values of the ratio beta-sites over alpha-2-sites were found in perirenal adipocytes whereas the lowest values of this ratio were found in s.c. deposits. A close positive relationship exist between alpha-2 adrenoceptor number, alpha-2 adrenergic responsiveness and fat cell volume. To conclude, beta and alpha-2 adrenoceptors exhibit similar pharmacological properties in dog and human fat cells. Variations according to the anatomical location of the fat deposits exist in both species. However, as opposed to human fat cells, it is evident that the balance between beta and alpha-2 adrenergic responsiveness is predominantly under the control of beta adrenoceptors in dog fat cells.", 
    "12": "Past work in the isolated perfused cat lung has shown that acute hypoxia (H) changes the response to norepinephrine (NE) from vasoconstriction to vasodilation but has no effect on the response to serotonin (S). These results could be related to the increase in pulmonary arterial pressure or vascular resistance during the hypoxic pressor response or a direct effect of H. We addressed this question, in the same preparation, by comparing responses to NE under four conditions in each experimental animal (n = 12): 1) NE infused during normoxia; 2) NE infused after vascular resistance (Rpv) was increased with serotonin; 3) NE infused after Rpv was increased by H; 4) NE infused after lobar pressure was raised by an increase in flow (P/F). PO2 values during H were varied (27-56 Torr). S and H produced a 137 +/- 35 and 43 +/- 8% delta Rpv increase in lobar vascular resistance, respectively. P/F increased lobar pressure 91 +/- 10%. Only NE infusion during H demonstrated significant differences in lobar pressure and Rpv compared with control normoxic periods. There was no correlation between responses to NE during S, H, and P/F and degree to which each stimulus increased Rpv or lobar pressure (r = 0.003, 0.28, 0.24). A significant relationship between response to NE during H vs. PO2 during H was observed (r = 0.78; P less than 0.001). In a subset of animals, we repeated the infusion of NE during H and P/F post-beta-blockade. The decrease in vascular response to NE during H and the correlation of PO2 with NE response were abolished (n = 7).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "Thermoregulation and cardiovascular drift were studied under conditions of prolonged exercise in a warm environment (dry bulb temperature 31.7 +/- 0.3 degrees C, rh 44.7 +/- 4.7%) during beta-adrenergic blockade. Fourteen subjects performed 90-min rides on a cycle ergometer at a work rate equivalent to 40% of their control maximal O2 uptake under each of three treatments provided in a randomized double-blind manner: atenolol (100 mg/day), propranolol (160 mg/day), and a placebo. Exercise during the propranolol trial resulted in significantly higher forearm vascular resistance values and significantly lower forearm blood flows (FBF) compared with the placebo trial. However, the significantly lower FBF during propranolol did not significantly alter the rectal temperature (Tre) response to prolonged exercise. In addition, both beta-blockers produced lower FBF for any given Tre, suggesting that beta-adrenergic blockade affects FBF through nonthermal factors. The slight differences in Tre, despite the large differences in FBF between the various treatments, are apparently the result of an enhanced sweat loss and a lower mean skin temperature during exercise with beta-blockade. The uncoupling of FBF and sweat loss provides evidence of independent regulation. The reduction in FBF at any given Tre was concomitant to lower blood pressure values during beta-blockade and suggests that baroreflexes provide significant input to the control of skin blood flow when both pressure and temperature maintenance are simultaneously challenged.", 
    "14": "Autonomic neural tone modulates arrhythmias and could affect the efficacy of an implantable defibrillator if defibrillation threshold is also altered by changes in neural activity. We determined the effects of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on the energy requirement for defibrillation using a sequential-pulse technique in anesthetized pigs. The doses for each drug were selected based on the results of dose-response curves. The mean defibrillation threshold was 10.2 +/- 0.65 J (mean +/- SE) in control and 10.0 +/- 0.84, 9.4 +/- 0.87 and 8.9 +/- 0.89 J during phenylephrine infusions of 0.7, 1.35, and 2.0-4.0 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 [n = 8, P = not significant (NS)]. Phenylephrine at all infusion rates increased the ventricular fibrillation threshold, indicating that effects on the ventricular fibrillation threshold may occur independent of changes in defibrillation threshold. No significant change was observed in the defibrillation threshold before and after administration of isoproterenol (6.5 +/- 0.72 and 6.7 +/- 0.93 J, n = 8, P = NS). Similarly, no change in defibrillation thresholds was observed after 1.5-2.0 mg/kg phentolamine (8.5 +/- 0.85 and 7.9 +/- 0.93 J, n = 8, P = NS) or 3.0-6.0 mg/kg atenolol (10.0 +/- 1.7 and 10.3 +/- 2.6 J, n = 8, P = NS). However, when defibrillation threshold was determined using a single-pulse method, isoproterenol infusion produced a significant decrease (17.3 +/- 1.5 vs. 14.6 +/- 1.9 J, n = 7, P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "15": "The effect of age on catecholamine regulation of hepatic glycogenolysis and on hepatic adenylate cyclase was studied in male rats up to 24 mo of age. Epinephrine and norepinephrine stimulated glycogenolysis in isolated hepatocytes at all age groups studied. Isoproterenol, however, stimulated glycogenolysis only at 24 mo. In isolated liver membranes, usual activators of adenylate cyclase increased the activity of the enzyme considerably more in membranes from 24-mo-old rats than in membranes from either 3- or 21-mo-old rats. The Mn2+-dependent activity of the cyclase was increased by 2.9-fold in 3-mo-old animals and approximately 5.7-fold in 24-mo-old rats, indicating a substantial age-dependent increase in the intrinsic activity of the catalytic unit. The density of the beta-adrenergic receptor, as measured by the binding of [125I]-iodocyanopindolol to plasma membranes, was 5-8 fmol/mg protein in rats aged 3-12 mo but increased to 19 fmol/mg protein in 24-mo-old rats. Computer-aided analysis of isoproterenol competition of the binding indicated a small age-dependent increase (from 30% at 3 mo to 43% at 24 mo) in the proportion of beta-receptors in the high-affinity state. These observations suggest that beta-receptor-mediated hepatic glycogenolysis in the aged rat is predicated upon increases in the density of beta-receptors as well as increased intrinsic activity of the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase.", 
    "16": "In guinea pig ventricular myocytes, the effect of histamine on the slow Ca2+ current (ICa) was studied and the following results were obtained: (1) Superfusion of cells with histamine resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of the amplitude of ICa. The threshold concentration of histamine was 10(-8) M, half maximal increase occurred at 3 X 10(-7) M and maximal enhancement (about 3-4-fold) at 5 X 10(-6) M. (2) The histamine effect was greatly reduced by the H2 antagonist cimetidine (10(-5) M) but only slightly by the H1 antagonist diphenhydramine (10(-5) M). (3) Effects of isoprenaline (ISP) and histamine at maximal effective concentrations on ICa were not additive, suggesting that both agents use the same intracellular pathway. Intracellular infusion of a blocker of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, Rp-cAMPS (10(-4) M), prevented the histamine effect. (4) The involvement of GTP-dependent transducer proteins was studied by cell dialysis with several GTP derivatives. Intracellular application of the stable GDP-analogue, GDP-beta-S, reduced the histamine effect on ICa, whereas the stable GTP analogue, GTP-gamma-S, mimicked the histamine effect.", 
    "17": "This report describes a patient with pseudo-type II second-degree AV block due to an intermittent parasystolic focus located in the left bundle branch. A paradoxical increase in the fascicular rate was seen following intravenous propranolol, and fascicular extrasystoles were suppressed after intravenous isoproterenol treatment. All propagated fascicular extrasystoles were conducted to the ventricle with incomplete or complete right bundle branch block and a decrease in the H'-V interval compared to the H-V interval during sinus rhythm. Treatment with oral quinidine abolished fascicular extrasystoles without worsening of AV conduction.", 
    "18": "It has been claimed that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists produce clinical improvement and increase longevity in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated heart is critically dependent upon adrenergic support to maintain forward output. Acute withdrawal of such support, even with small doses of beta-blockers, may worsen myocardial function sufficiently to limit their widespread use. Pindolol (P), a potent beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, possesses high intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Administration of P to patients with dilated cardiomyopathy may protect against the effects of high circulating catecholamines and at the same time partially maintain intrinsic left ventricular function. We examined the acute hemodynamic effects of P (2.5 mg orally) in seven patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (average ejection fraction, 23%) and resting tachycardia (average, 111 beats/min). As compared to baseline values, P produced a highly significant fall in heart rate (rest, 19%, p less than 0.001; exercise, 24%, p less than 0.01), cardiac output (rest, 20%, p less than 0.01; exercise, 25%, p less than 0.001), and systemic arterial pressure (exercise only, 13%, p less than 0.05). Calculated systemic vascular resistance increased significantly at rest (17%, p less than 0.05). Pulmonary artery pressures did not change. Compared to normal subjects, baseline norepinephrine levels were markedly elevated in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy at rest and during exercise. Pindolol produced a further significant increase in norepinephrine levels. Two of seven patients became appreciably short of breath after P. Despite its substantial intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, pindolol, like other beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists, produces significant hemodynamic impairment in patients with congestive cardiomyopathy. An exaggerated norepinephrine response after the drug may, by increasing peripheral vascular resistance, lead to further deterioration in left ventricular performance.", 
    "19": "Dietary lipid supplements high in either saturated fatty acids derived from sheep perirenal fat or polyunsaturated fatty acids (65% linoleic acid) derived from sunflower seed oil were fed to marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) for 20 months. The effect of these long-term dietary lipid supplements on myocardial contractile function and their influence on responses to isoprenaline and external calcium concentration were examined using isolated papillary muscles and atria. Isoprenaline potency was increased by the sheep fat-supplemented diet, which induced significant three- to eightfold leftward parallel shifts of isoprenaline dose-response curves for papillary muscle and left atrial inotropy and right atrial chronotropy. The antagonist potency of propranolol was not influenced by diet. The incidence of isoprenaline-induced spontaneous tachyarrhythmias in electrically driven papillary muscles and left atria was reduced by the sunflower seed oil-supplemented diet and increased by the sheep fat diet, as were the spontaneous beat rate and calcium-dependent automaticity of right atria. These results show that dietary lipids can significantly modify stimulus-response coupling and alter the susceptibility to arrhythmogenesis in the heart of the nonhuman primate, and indicate that nutritional interventions may modify responses to cardioactive drugs as well as influence the development of cardiac disease.", 
    "20": "The influence of the slow channel calcium entry blocker, nifedipine, and the slow channel calcium entry promoter, BAY-K 8644, on receptor-mediated hemodynamic responses was studied in chronically instrumented, conscious dogs. Following ganglionic, cholinergic, and beta-adrenergic blockade, equipressor doses of phenylephrine (0.6 microgram/kg iv), a selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, and B-HT 933 (20 micrograms/kg iv), a selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, as well as a nonadrenergic vasoconstrictor, vasopressin (0.003 IU/kg) were administered before and after infusions of nifedipine or BAY-K 8644 (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1). In doses producing minimal or no haemodynamic effects, nifedipine caused dose-related attenuation from control of phenylephrine- (from 26 +/- 3 to 8 +/- 1 mmHg), B-HT 933- (from 30 +/- 2 to 5 +/- 2 mmHg), and vasopressin- (24 +/- 1 to 2 +/- 2 mmHg) mediated changes in mean arterial pressure. In contrast, BAY-K 8644 produced dose-related potentiation from control of the same pressor responses (phenylephrine, 24 +/- 2 to 41 +/- 3 mmHg; B-HT 933, 28 +/- 3 to 46 +/- 2 mmHg; vasopressin, 25 +/- 3 to 45 +/- 5 mmHg). In addition, BAY-K 8644 produced a marked increase in the duration of the pressor response produced by all three agonists. Thus, in conscious dogs, alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and vasopressin-mediated pressor responses are strongly modulated by transmembrane calcium flux and can be influenced by dihydropyridine slow channel calcium agonists and antagonists.", 
    "21": "A randomized, double-blind, crossover study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of ethmozine, propranolol and a combination of ethmozine and propranolol for treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. Twenty-six patients received propranolol, 40 mg, or matching placebo 3 times daily, alone or in combination with ethmozine, 600 to 900 mg/day in 3 equally divided doses, for 1-week periods separated by matching placebo. As determined by 48-hour weekly Holter monitoring, the mean reduction in ventricular premature complex (VPC) frequency was significantly greater with ethmozine (86%) and with ethmozine plus propranolol (90%) than with propranolol (41%) (p less than 0.05). Seventy-five percent of patients had more than a 70% reduction in VPCs with ethmozine plus propranolol, although 70% of patients had an equal degree of suppression with ethmozine alone. Only 2 patients (10%) had the same degree of VPC suppression with propranolol. The results were similar for reductions in pairs of VPCs and VT runs. Two patients discontinued propranolol because of adverse effects, but no patient discontinued ethmozine or combination therapy. Adverse effects were not more frequent with combination therapy. Ventricular function as assessed by echocardiography during drug dosing showed no significant changes from placebo. Ethmozine alone or in combination with propranolol was effective in suppressing VPCs for as long as 1 year in patients who responded. It is concluded that ethmozine alone or in combination with propranolol is well tolerated. Propranolol does not appear to enhance the efficacy of ethmozine.", 
    "22": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial of intravenous nadolol in the treatment of sustained supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 29 patients (20 men, 9 women) were studied. Mean age was 55 years and all patients were required to have well-documented SVT with a ventricular rate greater than or equal to 120/min that was sustained for at least 30 minutes. Patients received sequential doses of 0.01, 0.02 and 0.04 mg/kg of nadolol or placebo at 10 minute intervals. The maximum total dosage of nadolol was 10 mg. Measurements taken during 10 minute monitoring periods after each administration included heart rate, ventricular rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. A positive response was defined as a greater than or equal to 20% decrease in heart rate, heart rate less than or equal to 100 beats/min or conversion to normal sinus rhythm. Eleven (79%) of patients given nadolol and 3 (20%) of placebo-treated patients demonstrated a positive response. Of the 11 responders to nadolol, 9 patients responded after the first dose, one after the second dose and one after the third dose. Significant (p less than 0.001) mean reductions in heart rate and ventricular rate were observed with nadolol, but not with placebo. Five (36%) of the patients given nadolol and only 2 (14%) of the patients who received placebo were converted to normal sinus rhythm. Adverse effects were limited to 1 episode of asymptomatic hypotension and 1 episode of wheezing with nadolol and 1 episode of asymptomatic hypotension with placebo. Nadolol is effective in controlling ventricular response in patients with sustained SVT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "To investigate the efficacy of nadolol in the prevention of supraventricular arrhythmias after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, 148 patients undergoing elective CABG were randomized in double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion to receive either nadolol or placebo. The test medication was started on the first postoperative morning and maintained as a single daily dose for 6 weeks. Aside from routine daily clinical evaluation and postoperative electrocardiographic monitoring, patients underwent 24-hour Holter recording once preoperatively and 3 times postoperatively. Seven patients were excluded from the evaluation of efficacy analysis because of insufficient postoperative data. There were no significant differences between the patients receiving nadolol (n = 67) and those receiving placebo (n = 74) with respect to age, preoperative heart rate, previous medications (including beta blockers), incidence of previous myocardial infarction, frequency of preoperative ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, concomitant valvular heart disease, mean cardiopulmonary bypass time, mean aortic cross-clamp time, use of blood and crystalloid cardioplegia, mean number of bypass grafts placed, postoperative use of inotropic agents and catecholamines and incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction. Analysis of postoperative Holter recordings showed that the heart rate was consistently and significantly higher in the placebo group throughout the period of the study (p less than 0.001). The average number of premature atrial contractions was significantly smaller in the nadolol group (p less than 0.05), and nadolol patients had fewer ventricular premature complexes, couplets and non-sustained ventricular tachycardias during the first week postoperatively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "In some patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, treatment with digitalis alone may fail to produce a satisfactory decrease in heart rate at rest or during exercise or emotional stress. Findings of a few clinical studies suggest that beta blockade in combination with digitalis therapy may be of benefit in these patients. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 8-week study of 32 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, the effects of digoxin therapy alone were compared with a combination of digoxin and nadolol. Criteria for entry into the study included ventricular rate at rest greater than or equal to 80/min or greater than or equal to 120/min with exercise, and serum digoxin levels within the therapeutic range. After digoxin dose titration to produce therapeutic levels, digoxin dosage remained constant throughout the balance of the study. After a 2-week, single-blind placebo lead-in period, patients were randomized to receive either digoxin plus placebo or a combination of digoxin and nadolol. The dose of nadolol/placebo was titrated from 20 to 120 mg daily as tolerated. Twenty-four hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) recordings, symptom-limited exercise treadmill tests and serum digoxin and nadolol levels were obtained at the end of the single and double-blind treatment periods. Comparing endpoint with baseline, results from Holter recordings showed that patients treated with a combination of digoxin and nadolol had significant (p less than 0.001) decreases in 24 hour average (78 +/- 4 to 63 +/- 3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

There were 53 men and 11 women ranging in age from 19 to 75 years (mean 53.9). The severity of arrhythmias varied from frequent ventricular premature beats to nonsustained and sustained ventricular tachycardias. Using serial treadmill exercise tests, patients underwent dose titration for 1 month and were followed up for 3 to 6 months. Depending on drug tolerance and response to treadmill exercise testing, the single daily required dose of oral nadolol ranged from 20 to 240 mg (average 66). Twenty-three (36%) of the patients experienced a total of 30 adverse effects of nadolol therapy; however, only 9 (14%) patients had to be withdrawn from the study. The adverse effects observed were those commonly associated with beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and all were dose-dependent and reversible. At the last patient visit, the severity of exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias was significantly decreased compared with pretreatment in 36 (75%) of 48 evaluable patients. Eighteen (38%) of the patients demonstrated total suppression of arrhythmias. This was accompanied by significant increases from pretreatment in both the mean duration of symptom-limited exercise (+1.02 +/- 0.41 minutes, p less than 0.05) and the mean time of exercise required for arrhythmia induction (+1.80 +/- 0.66 minutes, p less than 0.01), a significant decrease from pretreatment in the mean peak exercise double-product (-4,775, p less than 0.001) and a decrease in the incidence of exercise-induced ST-segment depression (-33%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "The efficacy and safety of nadolol and atenolol, 2 new long-acting beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, were evaluated in patients with recurrent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Intravenous and oral drug therapy was administered to patients with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia and atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia. Efficacy was judged on a short-term basis by programmed electrical stimulation and on a long-term basis by clinical parameters and serial ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings during long-term follow-up. In addition, the usefulness of programmed electrical stimulation to predict long-term efficacy was evaluated. Intravenous nadolol prevented induction of SVT in 6 of 8 (75%) patients with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, and oral nadolol prevented induction of SVT in 5 of 6 (83%) responders to intravenous nadolol. No episodes of sustained SVT recurred in these 5 patients during follow-up. Intravenous nadolol also prevented induction of SVT in 2 of 17 (11%) patients with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. Both patients remained non-inducible during treatment with oral nadolol, and neither experienced recurrence of SVT during follow-up. Intravenous atenolol prevented induction of SVT in 5 of 6 (83%) patients with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia. Oral atenolol prevented induction of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia in 4 of 5 (80%) patients responding to intravenous atenolol, and none of these 4 patients experienced a clinical recurrence. Intravenous atenolol prevented induction of SVT in 1 of 4 (25%) patients with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. Oral atenolol prevented induction of SVT in this patient and the arrhythmia has not recurred during follow-up. During follow-up (1 to 37 months), drug tolerance and compliance have been excellent with a low incidence of adverse reactions (11%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "Two types of arrhythmias are associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: those in which the accessory pathway is a required part of the reentrant circuit, e.g., orthodromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, and those that conduct over the accessory pathway but do not require its activation for maintenance of tachycardia, e.g., atrial flutter/fibrillation. Increased sympathetic tone shortens the refractoriness of atrial and ventricular tissue; however, conduction in the atrium and ventricle is not considered the limiting factor for maintenance of atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia or conduction over the accessory pathway in atrial arrhythmias. Intravenous beta-adrenergic blockers given to patients in the resting state have a minimal to moderate effect in depressing atrioventricular nodal conduction, but have little or no effect on accessory pathway refractoriness or conduction in most patients. In patients presenting with atrioventricular reentry, intravenous administration of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs often is not effective to terminate tachycardia. However, long-term oral therapy with these agents may be beneficial, especially in patients in whom enhanced sympathetic tone is responsible for the initiation or maintenance of tachycardia.", 
    "28": "beta-adrenergic blocking agents are efficacious in the treatment of patients with a variety of supraventricular tachycardias, based directly on their capacity to counter the effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation on sinus and atrioventricular nodal tissue. Specifically, beta blockers depress sinus node automaticity and inhibit atrioventricular nodal function by prolonging refractoriness and slowing conduction. Supraventricular arrhythmias that depend on these structures either for perpetuation or for conduction to the ventricles are predictably sensitive to beta blockade. These arrhythmias include sinus tachycardia, sinoatrial reentrant, atrioventricular nodal reentrant (dual pathway) and atrioventricular reciprocating (concealed bypass tract) tachycardias, as well as atrial flutter and fibrillation. beta blockers may also be used, in selected patients, to inhibit catecholamine-facilitated accessory pathway function by prolonging refractoriness. beta blockers offer particular clinical advantages, including an acceptable side-effect profile, titratable effect, varied pharmacology and reasonable concordance between efficacy of parenteral and oral dosage forms. The key element in the most effective use of these drugs appears to be an accurate arrhythmia diagnosis that allows for the most appropriate application of a reliable treatment form.", 
    "29": "Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents are effective antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with ventricular arrhythmias. However, these agents exert little or no measurable electrophysiologic effect on normal Purkinje and ventricular muscle fibers when administered acutely. They prevent catecholamine-induced increases in Purkinje fiber automaticity and may interfere with catecholamine-dependent slow responses. beta-adrenergic blocking drugs also prevent the decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold induced by catecholamines. In the acutely ischemic ventricle, some beta blockers selectively depress conduction within the ischemic zone. The long-term administration of some beta blockers has, in contrast to their short-term effects, been shown to prolong action potential duration and effective refractory period in the ventricle. Which of these observed electrophysiologic effects, either alone or in combination, contributes to the ventricular antiarrhythmic effects of beta-blocking drugs in man is at present unknown.", 
    "30": "Classification of ventricular arrhythmias into those that are benign, potentially lethal and lethal is based on their associated risk for producing sudden cardiac death. This classification system is useful in defining indications for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias and predicting differential rates of antiarrhythmic drug efficacy and toxicity. Whether the reduction of potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias will prevent sudden cardiac death remains to be determined. The class II antiarrhythmic agents--the beta-adrenergic blocking drugs--have been shown to reduce sudden cardiac death in postmyocardial infarction patients, but the precise mechanism of their effect has not been defined. beta blockers are efficacious in approximately 50% of patients with benign or potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. This response is comparable to that seen with the class IA agent disopyramide or the class IB agents tocainide and mexiletine. beta blockers have favorable side-effect profiles including a low incidence of proarrhythmia and a lack of organ toxicity such as hepatitis, pulmonary fibrosis or agranulocytosis, which are concerns with class I and class III antiarrhythmic drugs. The proper dosage of the beta blocker is critical in limiting adverse effects. In a study of 23 patients with benign or potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias, 11 (48%) of the patients responded to nadolol with a reduction of greater than 75% in arrhythmia frequency, and several patients responded at nadolol dosages as low as 10 mg daily. Thus, it is plausible to consider beta blockers as first-choice antiarrhythmic therapy, even in patients with left ventricular dysfunction when sympathetic tone is not required to maintain cardiac compensation.", 
    "31": "The hemodynamic and antiarrhythmic interactions between nadolol and a commonly used class I antiarrhythmic agent, quinidine or procainamide, were evaluated in 18 patients with ventricular arrhythmias in a double-blind, parallel study. Patients qualified for entry into the study if their ventricular arrhythmias remained poorly controlled (greater than or equal to 10 ventricular premature complexes/hr) with the class I agent alone and they had a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 30%. Patients received their usual therapeutic doses of quinidine or procainamide throughout the study, which consisted of 3 treatment periods; a 2-week placebo treatment period, a 2-week open-label oral nadolol dose titration period, during which the dosages of nadolol were gradually increased from 40 mg daily to a maximum tolerated dose up to 120 mg daily, and a 4-week randomized, parallel comparison period during which patients were treated with either a class I agent alone or a combination of a class I agent and nadolol. Left ventricular ejection fractions by radionuclide ventriculography and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) recordings were obtained at the end of each treatment period. A positive treatment response was defined as greater than or equal to 75% reduction in ventricular premature complex frequency. During the dose titration phase, combination therapy with nadolol (mean dose 94 mg daily) and class I agents produced a mean decrease in ventricular premature complexes of 79% (p less than 0.01), and a mean decrease in ventricular couplets of 95% (p less than 0.01). A positive response was observed in 57% of patients treated with nadolol plus a class I agent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "We previously described the production of four monoclonal antibodies to the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist alprenolol. One of these antibodies, 5B7 (IgG2a, kappa), was used to raise anti-idiotypic antisera in rabbits. In contrast to the expected results, one of the anti-idiotypic antisera (R9) promotes [125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding to antibody 5B7. In the presence of R9, the dissociation constant decreases 100-fold from 20 to 0.3 nM. This increase in binding affinity of antibody 5B7 for ICYP is not observed in the presence of preimmune, rabbit anti-mouse or anti-idiotypic antisera generated to a monoclonal antibody of a different specificity. Furthermore, R9 in the absence of 5B7 does not bind ICYP. The F(ab) fragments of 5B7 and R9 behaved in a similar manner, and the soluble complex responsible for the high-affinity interaction with ICYP can be identified by gel filtration chromatography. The elution position of the complex is consistent with a 5B7 F(ab)-R9 F(ab) dimer, indicating that polyvalency is not responsible for the enhanced ligand binding. Kinetic analysis of ICYP-5B7 binding revealed that the rate of ICYP dissociation from 5B7 in the presence of R9 is approximately 100 times slower than in the absence of R9 [k-1(+R9) = 0.025 min-1 vs. k-1(-R9) = 2.04 min-1], consistent with the 100-fold change in binding affinity of 5B7 for ICYP. The available data best fit a model in which an anti-idiotypic antibody binds at or near the binding site of the idiotype participating in the formation of a hybrid ligand binding site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "The enzyme ATP citrate-lyase of the fatty acid synthesis pathway is phosphorylated in vitro and in isolated cells. However, no effect of phosphorylation on the enzyme activity has been detected. It is demonstrated that the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol or insulin both promote an immobilization of ATP citrate-lyase, detected in digitonin-permeabilized adipocytes. This effect was reproduced by the cyclic AMP analog cyclic 8-bromo-AMP. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol blocked, but failed to reverse, the isoproterenol-directed effect. Propranolol also failed to reverse the isoproterenol-induced increased phosphorylation of ATP citrate-lyase specifically. In response to increasing concentrations of isoproterenol, an increased extent of phosphorylation of ATP citrate-lyase was paralleled by an increased immobilization of the enzyme. It is suggested that the state of phosphorylation of ATP citrate-lyase in adipocytes controls the localization in the cell.", 
    "34": "The possible role of dopamine in the light-induced suppression of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in retinas of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) was investigated using an in vitro eye cup preparation. The nocturnal increase of retinal NAT activity was significantly inhibited by either light exposure or exogenous dopamine. Spiperone, a dopamine receptor blocker, antagonized this inhibitory effect of light on NAT activity, but had no effect in darkness. The effect of spiperone required the presence of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitors, 3-isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), papaverine, or Ro 20-1724. Under the conditions employed in this study, neither spiperone nor the phosphodiesterase inhibitors significantly affected NAT activity when added alone. This observation suggests a synergistic interaction between the dopaminergic antagonists and the phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Other dopamine receptor blockers, including haloperidol, cis-flupenthixol, clozapine and metoclopramide, increased NAT activity of light-exposed retinas incubated in the presence of IBMX. SCH 23390, a D1-selective dopamine receptor antagonist, did not increase NAT activity, nor did the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists tested. The effect of spiperone and IBMX on NAT activity was blocked by apomorphine and by the D2-dopamine receptor agonist LY 171555, but not by the D1-receptor agonist SKF 38393-A. The concentration of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was higher in light-exposed retinas than in dark-adapted retinas, suggesting that light exposure increases dopamine metabolism in Xenopus retina. The results presented in this paper suggest that dopamine, released in response to light exposure and acting on D2-dopamine receptors, is partially responsible for the light-induced suppression of the nocturnal increase in retinal NAT activity.", 
    "35": "Intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (L-DOPS) (50 and 250 micrograms/rat) raised in a dose-related manner both plasma prolactin (PRL) and CSF norepinephrine (NE) in urethane-anesthetized male rats. Intravenous (iv) injection of larger doses of L-DOPS (5 and 10 mg/100 g BW) slightly but significantly increased plasma PRL and CSF NE. L-DOPS injection (50 micrograms/rat, icv or 5 mg/100 g BW, iv) also raised plasma PRL in conscious rats. There was a good correlation (r = 0.74) between CSF NE and peak plasma PRL in the anesthetized animals. Propranolol (100 micrograms/100 g BW, iv) inhibited plasma PRL responses to L-DOPS (50 micrograms/rat, icv) and NE injection (1 microgram/rat, icv) raised plasma PRL in anesthetized animals. These findings indicate that L-DOPS stimulates PRL secretion via central noradrenergic mechanisms in the rat.", 
    "36": "Although (-)-125I-iodopindolol (IPIN) can be used to label beta-adrenergic receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) in vivo, use of this ligand for receptor imaging studies in humans may be limited due to its relatively poor penetration into the CNS. A series of derivatives related to pindolol was therefore studied in an effort to determine the factors that might influence the penetration and interaction of these compounds with central beta-adrenergic receptors in vivo. Evaluation of the ability of these derivatives to displace the binding of IPIN in the brain upon systemic administration provides an assessment of whether the derivatives penetrate and interact with central beta-adrenergic receptors in vivo. Multiple regression analyses showed that the most important factor which influences the ability of the pindolol derivatives to penetrate into the brain and interact with beta-adrenergic receptors in vivo is the affinity of the derivatives for binding to beta-adrenergic receptors in vitro. Both lipophilicity and the molecular weights of the derivatives are important secondary factors which influence their in vivo potency.",

    "39": "The characteristics of the increased calcium (Ca) influx observed in metabolically depleted red blood cells (RBCs) of hypertensive patients were investigated. Twenty-four normotensives, 16 untreated essential hypertensives, and 10 essential hypertensives under sufficient blood pressure control by 50-100 mg/day atenolol were studied. Free intracellular concentrations of Ca, sodium (Na), and potassium (K) were assessed using ion-selective electrodes in freeze-thawed RBCs, which were metabolically depleted by 30 mM desoxy-glucose at 37 degrees C for 48 h. In the treated hypertensives values for Ca and K at 24 and 48 h were not different from values for the normotensives, whereas elevated Ca was found in RBCs of untreated hypertensives. Na in treated hypertensives was significantly increased at 0 and 48 h, thus, being similar to values for untreated hypertensives. Additionally, RBCs of six normals were stressed in a glass/teflon potter. Before metabolic depletion electrolytes were not affected by this procedure, while Ca at 24 and 48 h of metabolic depletion increased to significantly higher values for the hypertensive patients as compared to the controls. These results suggest that the altered Ca metabolism in the RBCs of hypertensives may reflect a secondary phenomenon due to the mechanical damage to RBCs by the elevated blood pressure.", 
    "40": "1. The effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonist administration on skeletal muscle contractile performance and bioenergetics in vivo have been investigated during unilateral sciatic nerve stimulation in the rat. 2. Two muscle stimulation protocols have been used: supramaximal stimulation at 4 Hz, or incremental supramaximal stimulation at 1, 2 and 4 Hz. Changes in high-energy phosphate concentrations were followed using 31P-n.m.r., and gastrocnemius muscle twitch characteristics were monitored continuously. 3. Under all conditions investigated, DL-propranolol administration (2.5 mg/kg body wt.) caused a significant decrease in cyclic AMP concentrations in resting and stimulated gastrocnemius muscle, prevented an increase in heart rate upon muscle stimulation, but did not affect plasma glucose, fatty acid or lactate concentrations in comparison with values obtained in control experiments. 4. Administration of DL-propranolol 5 min or 35 min before unilateral stimulation of 4 Hz had no effect on changes in muscle phosphocreatine, ATP or Pi concentrations, intracellular pH or contractile performance. 5. In contrast, animals receiving DL-propranolol 5 min before unilateral stimulation of 1, 2 and 4 Hz showed a significant deterioration in gastrocnemius muscle tension development during 2 and 4 Hz stimulation compared with control animals. Concurrent with this change in contractile performance was a higher muscle concentration of phosphocreatine, a lower concentration of Pi and no significant change in intramuscular pH compared with control experiments. 6. The changes in muscle performance and bioenergetics observed during the incremental stimulation protocol were not observed when D-propranolol was administered and could be completely circumvented by a short period of muscle stimulation of 4 Hz prior to initiation of the incremental stimulation protocol. 7. Mechanisms are discussed which may account for the failure of gastrocnemius muscle to generate the expected force during the incremental stimulation protocol in the presence of beta-blockade.", 
    "41": "The transmembrane regulation of cGMP accumulation, which is poorly understood, was studied using isolated rat pinealocytes. It was found for the first time that VIP stimulates cGMP accumulation several-fold. This stimulation was amplified by phenylephrine acting via alpha 1-adrenoceptors, resulting in a greater than 100-fold increase in cGMP accumulation. These results raise the possibility that cGMP accumulation in other tissues might be regulated by VIP, and that the stimulating effects of VIP might be markedly amplified by catecholamine transmitters in these tissues. It is also possible that other pairs of receptors might control large changes in cGMP in the central nervous system through parallel mechanisms.", 
    "42": "Changes in serum creatinine concentration and proteinuria over a period of 12 months were analysed retrospectively in hypertensives in renal failure, 39 treated with conversion-enzyme inhibitors and 41 treated with other antihypertensives. The occasionally recorded blood pressures were comparable in the two groups. Median serum creatinine levels in the patients treated with conversion-enzyme inhibitors rose from 2.33 mg/100 ml (range 1.5-5.5) after one month acutely by 0.4 mg/100 ml and then remained essentially constant. In nine patients the level was higher by greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/100 ml after 12 months than at the beginning of treatment. Proteinuria did not show any identifiable changes. On the other hand, in those patients treated with other antihypertensives, median serum creatinine concentration rose gradually over 12 months from 2.4 mg/100 ml (range 1.5-6.0) to 3.45 mg/100 ml (1.5-12.9). In 18 patients the serum creatinine level rose by less than or equal to 0.5 mg/100 ml. Five patients developed side effects to conversion-enzyme inhibitors, but none required discontinuation of treatment. It is concluded that the use of conversion-enzyme inhibitors in patients with renal failure is effective and largely safe. It apparently causes less of a rise in serum creatinine than other antihypertensives.", 
    "43": "Increases in metabolic rate and core temperature are common responses to severe injury. We have investigated the hypothesis that these responses are due to increases in substrate cycling. A substrate cycle exists when opposing, nonequilibrium reactions catalyzed by different enzymes are operating simultaneously. At least one of the reactions must involve the hydrolysis of ATP. Thus, a substrate cycle both liberates heat and increases energy expenditure, yet there is not net conversion of substrate to product. In studies in volunteers (n = 18) and in patients with severe burns who were in a hypermetabolic state (n = 18), we used stable-isotope tracers to quantify substrate cycling in the pathways of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis and a cycle involving the simultaneous breakdown and synthesis of stored triglyceride (triglyceride-fatty acid cycle). The total rates of triglyceride-fatty acid and glycolytic-gluconeogenic cycling were elevated in the patients by 450 and 250 percent, respectively (P less than 0.01). An infusion of propranolol in the patients greatly reduced triglyceride-fatty acid cycling but did not affect gluconeogenic-glycolytic cycling. We conclude that increased substrate cycling contributes to the increased thermogenesis and energy expenditure following severe burns and that the increased triglyceride-fatty acid cycling is due to beta-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "44": "The effects of congestive heart failure on the physiological and biochemical functions of the cardiac beta-adrenoceptor-coupled adenylate cyclase system were studied in dogs with right heart failure produced by progressive pulmonary artery constriction and tricuspid avulsion. The cardiac inotropic response to dobutamine was attenuated in congestive heart failure, as determined by the right and left ventricular dP/dt responses. Adrenergic beta-receptor density, measured by [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding, was reduced in membrane fractions of the failing right ventricle, but not in the left ventricle. The functional activity of the adenylate cyclase system was studied in vitro by measuring the net cyclic AMP production following additions of isoproterenol, 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), forskolin, or manganese chloride, which act either directly on the beta-adrenergic receptors or on one of the post-receptor components of the adenylate cyclase system. Congestive heart failure reduced the net production of cyclic AMP by isoproterenol, Gpp(NH)p, and forskolin in both the right and left ventricles, but did not alter the effect of manganese chloride. Thus, beta-receptor down-regulation is chamber-specific, occurring only in the hemodynamically stressed right ventricle. In contrast, the post-receptor defect of the adenylate cyclase system occurred in both ventricles of the heart failure dogs. This decreased activation of adenylate cyclase by beta-agonists may be responsible, at least in part, for the diminished cardiac inotropic response to catecholamines in congestive heart failure.", 
    "45": "The distribution of beta-adrenoceptors in slide-mounted dog kidney sections was determined using the radioligand (-)-[125I]cyanopindolol ((-)-[125I]CYP) and autoradiography. Using conditions designed to prevent (-)-[125I]CYP binding to non-beta-adrenoceptor sites, biochemical studies revealed that (-)-[125I]CYP binding equilibrated within 150 min (K1 = 3.2 X 10(8) M-1 min-1), was saturable (KD = 30.72 +/- 2.96 pM; Bmax = 0.57 +/- 0.03 fmol/section, n = 4) and stereoselective with respect to the stereoisomers of propranolol and pindolol. Delineation of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes with the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist betaxolol and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 demonstrated that the proportions of beta 1-: beta 2-adrenoceptors was between 1:6 and 1:11. Autoradiographic studies showed that beta 1-adrenoceptors were localized on the juxtaglomerular apparatus and glomeruli, while beta 2-adrenoceptors were localized on medullary rays.

    "46": "This investigation examined some of the barrier properties of the conjunctival, scleral, and corneal membranes. The diffusion of nadolol, timolol, propranolol, penbutolol, sucrose, and inulin was measured across the isolated corneal and scleral membranes of the rabbit using a two-chamber glass diffusion cell. Drug absorption across the cornea and the conjunctiva was studied in vivo by measuring precorneal drug clearance. The drug samples were analyzed either by HPLC or liquid scintillation counting (LSC). For all the compounds tested, the scleral permeability was significantly higher than the respective corneal permeability. The permeability coefficients of the beta-blockers varied in the following manner: propranolol > penbutolol > timolol > nadolol for the cornea, and penbutolol > propranolol > timolol > nadolol for the sclera. The cornea offered substantially more resistance to inulin, a polar, macromolecular substance, than did the conjunctiva. However, the cornea and conjunctiva offered comparable resistance to the smaller and less polar drug timolol. This information may serve as a basis for optimizing the intraocular delivery of drugs that are poorly absorbed across the cornea due to their physicochemical properties.", 
    "47": "The resting metabolic rates (VO2) of rats fed chow (CH) or a \"cafeteria\" (CAF) diet of highly palatable human foods were measured at thermoneutrality (28 degrees C) before and shortly after two-thirds hepatectomy or sham operation, and again after administration of propranolol (5 mg/kg). CAF rats initially had a 17% and 1.2 mL/min higher mean resting VO2 than CH rats, a difference usually considered to represent the diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) that CAF rats develop during overconsumption of the diet. Sham operation did not significantly affect resting VO2 in either diet group. Two-thirds hepatectomy decreased VO2 by about 1.0 mL/min more (125% more) in CAF rats than in CH rats, from which it may be estimated that the CAF rats initially had a liver VO2 about 1.6 mL/min higher than that of the CH rats, a difference more than sufficient to fully account for their apparent DIT. Propranolol did not significantly affect the VO2 of CH rats. It reduced the VO2 of sham-operated CAF rats by 0.94 +/- 0.08 mL/min (12%), but had a significantly smaller effect (delta VO2 = -0.50 +/- 0.05 mL/min) in partially hepatectomized CAF rats. This difference suggests that about 70% of the propranolol-inhibitable fraction of the elevated VO2 of the CAF rats, presumably a measure of sympathetically mediated DIT, resided in the liver. This study thus points to the liver as the major (70-100%) effector of the DIT of CAF rats.",

Injections made into the ventrolateral medulla in the region of nucleus paragigantocellularis lateralis (p.g.l.) produced a rise in blood pressure accompanied by either an increase or decrease in heart rate according to the precise site of the injection. The tachycardia was blocked by propranolol (0.15-0.5 mg kg-1 I.V.) whilst bradycardia was abolished by vagotomy or atropine (0.2-1.5 mg kg-1 I.V.). 3. Recordings were made of blood flow to the hind-limb, renal and mesenteric vascular beds in order to study the haemodynamic changes separately in each region. 4. Vasoconstriction was seen in the renal and mesenteric beds and either vasodilatation or vasoconstriction could be evoked in hind-limb muscle. The vasodilatation in hind-limb muscle was resistant to atropine but significantly reduced by propranolol (0.15-1.5 mg kg-1 I.V.) and therefore was probably mediated mainly by circulating adrenaline. 5. The relative contribution by each vascular bed to the rise in peripheral resistance produced by micro-injection of DLH at any one site varied according to the site of the injection and there was a degree of topographical organization within p.g.l. The neuronal pools which elicit tachycardia, renal vasoconstriction and hind-limb dilatation were located at the rostral end of the nucleus whilst those which produced vasoconstriction in the hind-limb muscle and mesenteric vascular beds were represented further caudally.", 
    "49": "Trapidil and some selected derivatives of trapidil were investigated in ouabain induced arrhythmia in guinea-pigs and in aconitine induced arrhythmia in rats. In both models trapidil exerted a marked antiarrhythmic effect. Investigations on ouabain induced arrhythmia showed that three derivatives were more effective than trapidil concerning the threshold for premature ventricular beats and flutter. One derivative only was able to decrease the sensitivity for fibrillation in the same order of magnitude as trapidil. On aconitine induced arrhythmia all derivatives of trapidil were less effective in elevating the threshold of arrhythmia than trapidil itself, but three derivatives showed antiarrhythmic properties.", 
    "50": "Fifteen patients (14 males and 1 female) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ranging from 22 to 67 years of age (mean: 45.5 years) were treated with oral nifedipine and propranolol for 6 to 24 (mean: 18) months. Twelve of the patients had been pretreated with a mean oral dose of 560 mg verapamil for 60 to 93 (mean 78.5) months, showing slight subjective and objective improvement. Treatment with nifedipine and propranolol was terminated in five cases, due to deterioration or side effects after 6 and 12 months, respectively. During combined therapy, two patients reported improvement, whereas in five cases there was no change and eight patients reported deterioration. There was no change in the Sokolow index. The radiologically determined heart volume increased in 10 out of 15 patients and in the total group from 887 +/- 214 to 938 +/- 248 ml/1.73 m2. Echocardiographic measurements showed a significant increase in left atrial diameter from 40.0 +/- 9 to 44.0 +/- 11 mm, whereas ventricular wall thickness remained unchanged. Thus, high-dose verapamil therapy seems superior to nifedipine-propranolol therapy in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", 
    "51": "The aim of the present study was to monitor the efficacy of treatment, morbidity and mortality over a 10-year period in 939 moderate to severe hypertensive patients. All patients were treated in the same hypertension clinic with the beta 1-selective agent atenolol, administered either alone or more usually with a diuretic with or without a vasodilator or other agents. Survival rates were compared with predicted survival rates, had the hypertension not been treated, and also with those of a local reference population matched for age and sex. After a mean follow-up time of 6.1 years, mean blood pressure (BP) was significantly lowered from 183/109 to 145/87 mmHg. Biochemical disturbance was minimal. There were 79 withdrawals from treatment, of whom 37 were lost to follow-up. There were 91 deaths on intention to treat. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) on treatment, and not initial BP, was a powerful predictor of mortality. Patients of all age groups with well-controlled SBP were less likely to die, particularly from myocardial infarction, than those with less well controlled SBP (P less than 0.001). However, due to possible J-curve relationships between treated BP and outcome, lowering SBP below 140-150 mmHg in the elderly, and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) below about 85 mmHg, may not be beneficial. Total mortality and mortality due to myocardial infarction was about 60% [corrected], of predicted level, had a high BP not been treated, being similar to that in a local reference control population (age- and sex-matched). The death rate from stroke was reduced to about 50% of that predicted. Patients who died showed a mean fall in mean serum triglyceride concentration in contrast to the mean increase that occurred in survivors. It is concluded that patients with moderate to severe hypertension who obtain a high level of general health care and optimal control of BP for up to 10 years, experience a significant decrease in total mortality rate and death from myocardial infarction and stroke.", 
    "52": "The effects of propranolol (10 mg/kg) on systolic blood pressure (SBP), resting and exercising heart rates (HR), and body weight (BW) were examined in 11-week swim-trained spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. In both species, SBP was significantly reduced by either propranolol or training, but the reduction was greater with propranolol than with training. However, when propranolol was administered to rats during training, their independent beneficial effects on SBP were annulled. HR was modified slightly by propranolol and training, but they both decreased BW. The mechanism of propranolol action on BW is not clear. Maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 Max), relative heart weight (RHW), and absolute heart weight (AHW) were measured after 11 weeks of training. In both SHR and WKY rats, VO2 Max was elevated by exercise training; moreover, VO2 Max was greatest among those receiving propranolol while training. However, the combined effects of propranolol and training produced a significant reduction of AHW in SHR. The RHW was increased by training, but it was decreased by propranolol. SHR rats were more sensitive to the effects of training and propranolol than WKY rats. In humans, several observations have been reported on the attenuation of certain exercise-induced cardiovascular and metabolic changes by beta-adrenergic blocking agents. Our results obtained with rats confirm some of those observations. It would seem that the hypertensive strain of rats could serve as a model for the study of attenuation mechanisms by beta-adrenergic blockers.", 
    "53": "Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded in conscious, freely behaving rats through a catheter in the tail artery during administration of nitroprusside or phenylephrine through a catheter in the jugular vein. The sympathetic and parasympathetic components were distinguished by treating the rats with atenolol or methyl-atropine. Reflex bradycardia induced by all doses of phenylephrine was almost totally blocked blocked following methyl-atropine treatment. Reflex tachycardia induced by small to moderate doses of nitroprusside was attenuated to an equal extent following atropine or atenolol treatment. A similar experimental schedule was followed with a separate group of rats to determine the effects of pentobarbital and urethane anesthesia on the baroreceptor reflex. Both pentobarbital and urethane equally attenuated the tachycardia response to a decrease in blood pressure. However, pentobarbital anesthesia resulted in a greater attenuation of the bradycardia response to an increase in blood pressure than did urethane anesthesia. These data support the conclusion that the parasympathetic nervous system is primarily responsible for baroreceptor reflex-induced bradycardia in conscious rats. The sympathetic and parasympathetic systems contribute equally to control baroreceptor reflex-induced tachycardia except in extreme acute hypotension when the tachycardia is predominantly due to the activation of sympathetic nerves. The findings of the second experiment indicate that pentobarbital and urethane affect sympathetic systems differently.", 
    "54": "In contrast to beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, calcium channel blockers do not appear to affect exercise tolerance in hypertensive subjects. A possible explanation is a difference in the metabolic effects of both types of drugs. Therefore, the effects of 4-week treatment periods with verapamil and propranolol on metabolic parameters during an endurance bicycle ergometer test were studied in eight patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Patients exercised at a work load which increased the heart rate to 150 bts/min during placebo. A single-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over design was used. The dose of propranolol and verapamil was adjusted to lower standing diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg. Average daily doses were 155 +/- 21 mg propranolol and 390 +/- 44 mg verapamil. Exercise heart rate was reduced during propranolol and verapamil (P less than 0.01), but the reduction was more pronounced during propranolol than during verapamil (P less than 0.05). Minute ventilation and oxygen consumption were unchanged during propranolol and verapamil. The respiratory exchange ratio tended to increase during propranolol. Plasma glucose and lactate concentrations were unchanged during propranolol and verapamil. In contrast, plasma glycerol and nonesterified fatty acids were reduced during propranolol (P less than 0.05), but unchanged during verapamil. Plasma potassium levels were increased during propranolol (P less than 0.05). Despite the important direct and indirect role of calcium ions in the regulation of many metabolic processes, no effect of verapamil on metabolic parameters during submaximal exercise was found. In contrast, propranolol had an effect on fat and potassium metabolism during exercise.", 
    "55": "Prolonged treatment with two chemically distinct beta-stimulants, Salbutamol and Terbutaline, resulted in mesovarian leiomyomas in Sprague-Dawley rats. Development of these tumors induced by Salbutamol was prevented by concurrent administration of the beta-blocker Propranolol. Mesovarian leiomyomas induced by Salbutomol did not show any regression or progression during a 44-week postdosing recovery period. This report also gives the first recorded incidence of spontaneous mesovarian leiomyomas in the rat.", 
    "56": "1 In mouse isolated atria previously incubated with [3H]-noradrenaline, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (3-270 microM) produced a concentration-dependent increase in the fractional stimulation-induced outflow of radioactivity. 8-Bromo-cyclic GMP induced a lesser increase in the stimulation-induced outflow. 2 The phosphodiesterase inhibitors: M&B 22948 (90 microM); ICI 63197 (30 and 90 microM) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (90 microM) increased the fractional stimulation-induced outflow. Together these results indicate that cyclic AMP may have a modulatory effect on noradrenaline release. 3 The inhibition of the stimulation-induced outflow produced by clonidine (0.03 microM) and its facilitation produced by phentolamine (1 microM) were unaltered in the presence of 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (90 microM). However, in the presence of 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (270 microM), the facilitatory effect of phentolamine was enhanced, but the inhibitory effect of clonidine (0.03 microM) was unaltered. In the presence of ICI 63197 (30 microM) the inhibitory effect of clonidine (0.03 microM) was unaltered, but the facilitatory effect of phentolamine (1 microM) was slightly enhanced. 4 Isoprenaline (0.003-0.1 microM) enhanced the fractional stimulation-induced outflow, an effect blocked by propranolol (0.1 microM). In the presence of 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (90 microM), the facilitatory effect of isoprenaline (0.01 microM) was blocked. In the presence of ICI 63197 (30 microM) the facilitatory effect of isoprenaline (0.003 microM) was potentiated. 5 These results suggest that whereas beta-adrenoceptor-mediated enhancement of noradrenaline release is linked to the stimulation of adenylate cyclase and enhanced formation of cyclic AMP, alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of noradrenaline release is not linked to inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity.", 
    "57": "1 Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) were recorded in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2 Infusion of metoprolol (4 mumol kg-1 h-1) or propranolol (1.5 mumol kg-1 h-1) reduced HR and significantly increased RSNA. 3 Administration of metoprolol caused a sustained decrease of MAP starting in the third hour of infusion. In contrast, administration of propranolol induced a biphasic response in MAP. It is suggested that the increase of RSNA after both beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs is due to a decrease in arterial baroreceptor activity.", 
    "58": "The effect of timolol maleate, a nonspecific beta-blocking agent, on anterior-segment oxygenation was studied using oxygen-sensitive microelectrodes inserted into the mid-anterior chamber of 13 cat eyes. The anterior-chamber oxygen tension was monitored continuously for two hours following the topical application of three drops of timolol 0.5%. Although a small, but significant, decline in oxygen tension of 19% was observed over the initial 90 minutes (P less than or equal to .05), the overall 10% decrease at the end of two hours was not considered either clinically or statistically significant when compared with a group of controls. Timolol, since it does not contribute significantly to hypoxia, may therefore be a more prudent choice for lowering intraocular pressure in disorders where hypoxia is believed to play an important role, such as in neovascular glaucoma and sickle-cell hyphema.", 
    "59": "The pathogenetic mechanism of isorhythmic AV dissociation (ID)--the often so-called nodal rhythm--developing during anesthesia is unclear. It has been proposed that stimulation of the AV node is caused by elevated sympathetic tone and a simultaneous blockade of the sinus node. In our prospective, randomized study the effect of the beta-blocking agent pindolol in converting ID into normal sinus rhythm has been investigated. Methods. Fourty patients (27 men, 13 women) aged 17 to 81 years, ASA class I and II, who developed ID during an elective surgical procedure were divided into four equal, randomized groups. The biometric data, type of operation, and anesthesia technique were comparable: induction of anesthesia with thiopental, intubation, and continuation with N2O/O2 combined with halothane or enflurane. The patients in group A formed the control group. The other patients received pindolol in a dose of 0.5 (group B), 1.0 (group C), and 2.0 (group D) micrograms/kg over a period of 30 s intravenously. The frequency of restoration of sinus rhythm during a testing period of 15 min in the pindolol-treated patients was compared with the frequency of the spontaneous converting rate in the control group. Results. A spontaneous return to sinus rhythm occurred in 2 of 10 (20%) patients of the control group, whereas with pindolol the restoration of sinus rhythm was effected in 25 of 30 (83.3%) patients during the observation period of 15 min (p less than 0.001). The dose of 2.0 micrograms/kg pindolol (group D) was most effective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "60": "The effects of a chronic three times a day treatment over a 5 to 6 week period of rabbit eyes with 1 of 5 topically applied glaucoma drugs on ocular blood flow was determined using a radioactive microsphere technique. The drugs employed were timolol (0.5%), pilocarpine (4%), epinephrine (2%), norepinephrine (2%), and ecothiophate iodide 0.125%). The results showed that epinephrine statistically decreased blood flow to the iris and ciliary processes while not to the posterior uveal tissues or optic nerve head. Pilocarpine also showed this same trend, while the differences were not statistically significant. Other drugs were without effect on regional ocular blood flow.", 
    "61": "The effect on anal tone of electrical stimulation of the presacral (hypogastric) sympathetic nerves has been studied in eight patients during abdominal rectopexy or restorative proctocolectomy. A sharp fall in anal pressure occurred in seven patients (mean fall 59 cmH2O; range 35-80 cmH2O). In one patient given a beta- and alpha-sympathetic blocking drug (labetalol 200 mg) intra-operatively, the anal pressure decreased by 15 cmH2O. These observations show that stimulation of the presacral sympathetic nerves causes relaxation of the internal anal sphincter and implies that these nerves may induce relaxation of the sphincter in vivo. The pathway of the recto-anal reflex has been studied intra-operatively in three patients undergoing rectal excision. The recto-anal reflex is present after presacral nerve blockade and after full mobilization of the rectum, but is abolished by circumferential rectal myotomy. The reflex has a local intramural pathway. This observation validates the assumption that absence of this reflex is a feature of aganglionosis, as in Hirschsprung's disease.", 
    "62": "Neuropsychiatric side effects have been reported with various systemic betablockers. Data submitted to the National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects appear to indicate similar adverse reactions secondary to topical ophthalmic timolol. One hundred sixty-three of 369 central nervous system cases (44%) reported depression, psychosis, confusion, and hallucinations following topical ophthalmic timolol administration. The psychiatric community should be aware that sudden changes in mental status or onset of common psychiatric conditions, such as depression, may be due to topical ocular timolol. Withdrawal of the drug usually results in disappearance of these effects in 1 to 7 days.", 
    "63": "The functional border zone is nonischemic myocardium that exhibits reduced function adjacent to an ischemic area. To determine if the functional border zone can be modified by pharmacologic interventions that alter contractility, we infused isoproterenol (0.04-0.10 micrograms/kg/min) or administered propranolol (2 mg/kg) during circumflex coronary occlusion in nine anesthetized, open-chest dogs. We measured systolic wall thickening on both sides of the perfusion boundary, which was delineated with myocardial blood flow (microsphere) maps constructed from small tissue samples. By fitting sigmoid curves to the composite systolic wall thickening data after coronary occlusion, we modeled the distribution of functional impairment across the perfusion boundary. Defined as the distance from the perfusion boundary to 97.5% of the nonischemic asymptote of the sigmoid fits, the functional border zone was 31 degrees of circumference after coronary occlusion alone. Isoproterenol increased +dP/dt by 58% and augmented nonischemic systolic wall thickening without changing the lateral extent of the functional border zone (32 degrees). Propranolol reduced +dP/dt by 24% and depressed nonischemic systolic wall thickening, but the size of the functional border zone remained limited to 28 degrees. Within the functional border zone, wall thickening was significantly but only moderately reduced (-28%) compared with thickening in nonischemic myocardium more than 10 mm away from the perfusion boundary. The ratio of nonischemic border zone to central nonischemic area wall thickening remained the same with each intervention. We conclude that the dimensions of the functional border zone are fixed early after coronary occlusion and that inotropic interventions do not modify the extent or relative severity of nonischemic regional dysfunction.", 
    "64": "1 The steady-state plasma concentrations of metoprolol and propafenone were determined in patients being treated with one of these drugs alone and during combined treatment with both drugs. In addition, single dose studies with metoprolol, propafenone and the combination of both drugs were performed in healthy volunteers to determine the pharmacokinetics and the time course of beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity. 2 In four patients being treated with metoprolol first and subsequently with propafenone in addition steady-state levels of metoprolol increased two to five fold with simultaneous treatment with propafenone. 3 In four patients being treated with the drug combination first and thereafter with propafenone alone no changes in the steady-state levels of propafenone were observed between both treatment periods. 4 Adverse effects of the drug combination were observed in two patients (one patient experienced severe nightmares and the other left ventricular failure). 5 When single oral doses of metoprolol (50 mg) and propafenone (150 mg) and the combination of both were administered to healthy subjects, an approximately two-fold decrease of the oral clearance of metoprolol was seen when propafenone was given in addition. No conclusive changes in the pharmacokinetics of propafenone could be detected in the presence of metoprolol. 6 Duration of beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity of a single dose of metoprolol in healthy volunteers as measured by reduction of exercise-induced tachycardia increased when propafenone was given in addition. 7 The dose of metoprolol should be reduced when propafenone is given in addition.", 
    "65": "Adaptation to exercise was investigated in 14 men aged 34-69 years (mean 51) with stable exertional angina caused by occlusive coronary artery disease. All underwent exercise electrocardiography to symptom limitation according to the Bruce protocol (first effort), and exercise to the onset of angina (warm up) followed by four minutes' rest, followed by exercise to symptom limitation (second effort). This protocol was repeated after sequential treatment for one month each with nifedipine 10 mg three times a day and with timolol 10 mg twice a day. Warm up significantly increased walking time to the onset of angina by 34.5% and to maximal exercise by 29.5%. The heart rate and rate-pressure product were significantly higher on second effort both at the onset of angina (by 7.0% and 11.1% respectively) and at maximal exercise (by 10.5% and 15.4% respectively). ST segment displacement was not significantly different after warm up. The effect of warm up on walking time to the onset of angina was markedly reduced after treatment with nifedipine but little influenced by timolol. Mean (SE) walking time after warm up on no treatment was 10.1 (0.7) min; after treatment with nifedipine it was 10.0 (0.6) min and after treatment with timolol it was 9.7 (0.4) min. These data demonstrate a substantial improvement in exercise performance after warm up and are consistent with the hypothesis that submaximal exercise in angina pectoris facilitates myocardial oxygen uptake by coronary vasodilatation.", 
    "66": "The intrinsic myocardial adaptation to chronic beta-blockade was explored in normal male Wistar rats. Propranolol was administered by subcutaneous infusion using osmotic minipumps for 3-4 wk (P group). Heart rate fell by approximately 100 beats/min. A second group of animals was similarly treated but had their pumps removed several days before study (P-R group). Heart rate rose, but remained below base line. Study of isolated ventricular papillary muscle from P, P-R, and age-matched controls (C group) revealed prolonged contraction duration in P and P-R groups, but no change in shortening velocity. A greater shortening of time to peak tension and time to one-half relaxation in response to norepinephrine was demonstrated in P and P-R groups. Acute in vivo or in vitro administration of propranolol had no effect on base-line mechanical performance. No changes in the Ca2+, actin-activated Mg2+ myosin adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity, or myosin isoenzyme distribution were found. Free thyroxine levels were decreased in P but not P-R groups. These findings indicate that chronic propranolol therapy in normal rats slows contraction and relaxation without altering contractility. The greater shortening of contraction duration in response to norepinephrine is partly offset by the prolongation of the base-line contraction.", 
    "67": "The cessation of pacing from the sinus node region is followed by a transient sinus tachycardia or postpacing tachycardia (PPT). We sought to characterize autonomic involvement in PPT. We used alpha-chloralose-anesthetized dogs and recorded electrocardiograms, blood pressure, and electrograms from the sinus node, right atrium, right ventricle, and His bundle. Both vagi and both stellate ganglia were transected. PPT developed immediately after either linear or stepped heart rate changes. PPT followed pacing from the rostral but not the caudal region of the sulcus terminalis. Independent manipulation of absolute level of heart rate (+33, +66, and +100 beats/min above control) and duration of atrial pacing (10, 20, and 30 s) revealed that PPT is dependent predominantly on the duration of pacing and less on level of heart rate. During pacing in the control state, a 1:1 atrial capture was maintained. After atropine administration (0.2 mg/kg iv), PPT increased significantly in magnitude, time to peak PPT was shortened significantly, and loss of 1:1 atrial capture during pacing was evident at pacing rates of from 10 to 60 beats above control. In contrast, propranolol significantly attenuated PPT. We conclude that acetylcholine, released during pacing from the sinus node region, suppresses inherent sinus node acceleration induced by the concurrent release of intramural catecholamines. During pacing, acetylcholine release is essential for the maintenance of 1:1 atrial capture and significantly modulates both the latency and magnitude of PPT.", 
    "68": "A study was performed to compare isosorbide dinitrate and nifedipine as adjunctive therapy in 14 patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina pectoris taking maximal beta-blocking drugs. Drug titration phases ensured maximal therapy of propranolol, isosorbide or nifedipine. The combination of nifedipine and propranolol was more effective than the combination of isosorbide and propranolol in reducing angina and increasing exercise capacity (323 vs 416 seconds, p less than 0.005) during exercise treadmill testing. Nifedipine produced a greater reduction in systolic blood pressure at submaximal exercise than isosorbide. Global and regional ejection fraction at rest and exercise was assessed with radionuclide ventriculography. The substitution of nifedipine for isosorbide depressed the global ejection fraction at rest (0.61 to 0.56 p less than 0.05) and produced a slight improvement in exercise ejection fraction (0.47 to 0.51, difference not significant). The decrease in ejection fraction from rest to exercise was 0.14 to 0.04 with nifedipine (p less than 0.005). The benefit of nifedipine compared with isosorbide occurred in regions with marked exercise-induced ischemia. In patients treated with maximal beta-blocking therapy, nifedipine is an effective alternative to isosorbide as a combination agent with propranolol. The salutary effects of nifedipine included afterload reduction with exercise and possible improvements in coronary blood supply.", 
    "69": "Oxygen utilization, arterial and venous blood gas levels, hemodynamic values and exercise tolerance were compared before and after administration of propranolol and verapamil in 10 patients with stable angina pectoris. During exercise, propranolol decreased cardiac output (CO) by 22%; O2 extraction was increased and O2 consumption (VO2) did not change. With verapamil treatment, CO modestly increased (7%), O2 extraction decreased and VO2 did not change. In contrast to O2 utilization, the drugs produced opposite changes in mixed venous and arterial blood gas levels. Propranolol decreased mixed venous pH, increased CO2 tension and decreased the pH of arterial blood. Verapamil increased venous pH and decreased CO2 tension; pH of arterial blood did not change. The drugs yielded similar levels of antianginal efficacy, but patients exercised longer during verapamil therapy and were less fatigued. The hemodynamic and metabolic differences suggest that muscle perfusion during exercise influences the onset of fatigue and may help determine the choice of therapy.", 
    "70": "Sympathetic hyperactivity has been implicated as an etiologic factor in postoperative ileus. The effects of methoxamine (alpha-agonist) and isoproterenol (beta-agonist) on colon contractions and blood flow were studied in nine monkeys. Phentolamine (alpha-antagonist) and propranolol (beta-antagonist) were used to block the effects of the appropriate agonist. Methoxamine caused a dose-related inhibition of colon contractions and a decrease in inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) blood flow. Isoproterenol caused a dose-related inhibition of colon contractions and an increase in IMA blood flow. The contractile and blood flow effects of methoxamine were blocked by phentolamine and those of isoproterenol by propranolol. Mechanical reduction of IMA blood flow by an amount equivalent to that observed with the highest dose of methoxamine caused no change in contractions in the segment of colon supplied by the IMA. Both alpha- and beta-agonists inhibit colon contractions and have the expected effects on IMA blood flow. The contractile and blood flow responses of the agonists can be blocked by appropriate antagonists. The blood flow changes are not responsible for the contractile changes. These results indicate that sympathetic hyperactivity may play a role in postoperative ileus.", 
    "71": "States of low cardiac output frequently complicate the postoperative course of patients undergoing repair of cyanotic congenital heart lesions. The relative contribution of chronic cyanosis alone to the postoperative deterioration in left ventricular function remains unknown. To study the effects of chronic cyanosis on left ventricular function, nine dogs underwent inferior vena cava-to-left atrial anastomosis, a model that minimizes abnormal left ventricular hemodynamic loads. After at least 6 months of chronic cyanosis (mean arterial pO2 of 44 mm Hg and mean hematocrit of 61%), the dogs were instrumented with ultrasonic dimension transducers and micromanometers for collection of left ventricular pressure-dimension data. Studies were performed 7 to 10 days after recovery from instrumentation while the dogs were awake and alert. Nine normal dogs were also instrumented and served as controls. Pressure and dimension data were collected during transient vena cava occlusions before and after the combined administration of propranolol and atropine to produce autonomic blockade. Contractile function as measured by dP/dt, ejection fraction, and the stroke work-end diastolic length relationship was decreased by autonomic blockade to a similar extent in both normal and cyanotic dogs. After autonomic blockade, normal dogs were able to maintain stroke volume and cardiac index by utilization of Frank-Starling reserves (increased left ventricular end diastolic volume). In contrast, dogs with cyanosis were unable to maintain stroke volume and cardiac index or to increase left ventricular end diastolic volume after autonomic blockade. Dogs with cyanosis had reduced ventricular diastolic compliance, and they more fully used Frank-Starling reserves to maintain normal stroke volume and cardiac index in the control state when compared with normal dogs. The diminished preload reserves of the cyanotic dogs limited systolic performance (stroke volume and cardiac index) only at reduced levels of contractility produced by autonomic blockade.", 
    "72": "We describe an elderly patient with multiple risk factors for congestive heart failure (CHF) who developed severe hypertension. Treatment with 20 mg hydralazine and 0.2 mg propranolol intravenously resulted in acute pulmonary edema. We conclude that beta-blocking agents may precipitate acute heart failure in patients with compensated CHF.", 
    "73": "This is an assay for labetalol in plasma by \"high-performance\" liquid chromatography, with 5-(2-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]) salicylamide hemihydrate as the internal standard. Plasma samples (500 microL) are extracted with acetonitrile, evaporated under nitrogen, reconstituted in the mobile phase, and injected onto a PRP-1 (Hamilton) column packed with particles of poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) copolymer. Fluorescence, enhanced by post-column introduction of NH4OH, was measured in the effluent (excitation wavelength 340 nm, emission wavelength 418 nm). Retention times for labetalol and the internal standard were 1.99 and 3.32 min, respectively. Inter- and intraday CVs for high and low concentrations of the drug were less than 7.5%. The assay standard curve is linear from 1 to 250 micrograms/L. Some commonly co-administered drugs were tested and did not interfere.", 
    "74": "In this study, the rates of lipid mobilization and of lipolysis have been quantified in severely burned children. In all 12 patients studied, the basal rates were determined. In seven patients, the lipolytic responsiveness to an infusion of epinephrine (0.015 micrograms/kg/min) was tested, and in the other five patients, the response to beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol, 1 mg/kg) was tested. The rate of appearance (Ra) of free fatty acids (FFA) was quantified by means of the infusion of 1-13C-palmitate to determine the rate of lipid mobilization, and Ra glycerol was determined using d5-glycerol to assess the rate of lipolysis more directly. In five patients, body composition was determined after recovery by means of H2(18)O dilution. The basal rate of lipolysis was higher than normal in the burned children. In four of the seven patients infused with epinephrine, there was a pronounced increase in Ra glycerol. In all patients given beta-blockade, Ra glycerol decreased greatly. Changes in Ra FFA corresponded with the changes in Ra glycerol in each case. Total body fat was very low (approximately 2% body weight), reflecting the surgical removal of fat in the process of burn wound excision. From these data it is concluded that lipolytic responsiveness to catecholamines in severely burned children is variable, but not absent, despite chronically elevated levels of catecholamines. The total extent of lipolysis may be limited by the available fat mass in children treated with fascial excision. In such patients, the limitation in the ability to mobilize an adequate amount of FFA to fully meet energy requirements provides an important rationale for the clinical practice of providing nutritional support in hourly boluses, as opposed to infrequent meals, since any period of even a few hours in which nutrients are not being absorbed will result in an energy substrate deficiency and consequent increase in amino acid oxidation.", 
    "75": "The present study determined the effect of halothane on arterial and venous propranolol concentrations during a continuous intravenous infusion of propranolol. Arterial and venous concentrations of propranolol remained constant during the experiment in the group of dogs anesthetized only with pentobarbital. However, there was a rapid increase in arterial propranolol concentration from 88 +/- 10 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM) prior to halothane to 116 +/- 12 ng/ml (P less than 0.05) and 130 +/- 7 ng/ml (P less than 0.05) 60 and 120 min, respectively, after starting halothane anesthesia (2.0 MAC 1.74%). The increase in venous propranolol concentration lagged substantially behind that of the arterial concentration, so that, 60 min after starting halothane, the arterial to venous (A/V) concentration ratio increased from 1.13 +/- 0.05 to a maximum of 1.48 +/- 0.08. In contrast to the changes following halothane, no significant change in the A/V ratio occurred following fentanyl. Both halothane and fentanyl administration produced a small but significant increase in the free fraction of propranolol (P less than 0.05). The results from this study emphasize the importance of the choice of sampling sites in pharmacokinetic experiments, as well as excluding subtle pharmacokinetic changes during anesthesia before ascribing changes in drug effect to changes in sensitivity to the drug.", 
    "76": "The effects of midazolam on atrial rate and contractile force in the isolated canine atrium perfused with donor blood were investigated. When midazolam in a dose range of 100-1000 micrograms was injected directly into the sinus node artery of the isolated atrium, biphasic (negative followed by positive) chronotropic and triphasic (positive, negative followed by positive) inotropic effects were induced. After propranolol or imipramine, the positive chronotropic and the secondary positive inotropic effects were significantly suppressed, but the initial positive inotropic effect was not affected. Tetrodotoxin, atropine, or R05-4864, a selective ligand for peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites, did not modify midazolam-induced effects. When midazolam in a dose of 0.1-1 mg/kg was administered intravenously to the donor dog, monophasic negative chronotropic and inotropic effects in the isolated atrium were observed but were not as prominent. We conclude that midazolam has direct cardiac inhibitory properties including catecholamine release due to a tyramine-like action.", 
    "77": "The effects of acutely increased right ventricular afterload induced by mechanical constriction of the main pulmonary artery or with alveolar hypoxia on function of the left ventricle were assessed in six and nine lambs, respectively (aged 1 to 3 days). Mechanical constriction of the main pulmonary artery in newborn lambs compromised left ventricular function with significant decreases in systemic blood flow and the peak first derivative of left ventricular pressure when considered simultaneously and as single variables. In contrast, alveolar hypoxia augmented left ventricular function with significant increases in systemic blood flow and the peak first derivative of left ventricular pressure when considered simultaneously or as single variables. Interaction appears to exist between the right and left ventricles during the newborn period. The mechanically increased afterload may have compromised left ventricular function by altering its end-diastolic size, inotropic state, or both. On the other hand, the augmented left ventricular function in the presence of hypoxia may have been due to an increase in inotropic background. The clinical implications in some infants with pulmonary hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction are raised.", 
    "78": "Sotalol was given for extended therapy to 22 of 29 patients with frequent (greater than or equal to 30/hour) complex premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) who had participated in a short-term study of sotalol vs placebo. Open-label sotalol was given in individually titrated divided doses of 160 to 800 mg/day (median 323, mean 386 mg/day). Response was assessed at approximately 1, 6, and 12 months or until patient discontinuation. The period of sotalol therapy averaged 9 months (range, 0.2 to 22.7). At about 1 month, 13 (59%) of 22 patients showed effective control of arrhythmia. The median percentage change in total PVCs for individual patients at 1 month was -70% and for repetitive PVCs it was -95%. At about 6 months, 10 (45%) of the 22 patients continued to be successfully treated; at about 12 months, seven patients continued on sotalol, six (27%) successfully treated according to Holter criteria. Reasons for discontinuation included lack of efficacy in nine, adverse effects in four (fatigue in three, bradycardia with sinus pauses in one), and miscellaneous reasons in two. ECG PR and especially QTc intervals increased significantly during therapy (p less than 0.02, p less than 0.01, respectively). In summary, sotalol is a moderately effective antiarrhythmic agent in patients with complex PVCs, but during long-term therapy a rather high dropout rate was observed because of arrhythmia recurrence or adverse effects."
