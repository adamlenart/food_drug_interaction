    "3": "Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction benefit from prompt reperfusion therapy. Adjunctive antianginal, antiplatelet, antithrombotic, beta blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and statin agents minimize ongoing cardiac ischemia, prevent thrombus propagation, and reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.", 
    "4": "Activation of delta-opioid receptors (DOR) is neuroprotective against hypoxic/ischemic injury in the cortex, which is at least partially related to its action against hypoxic/ischemic disruption of ionic homeostasis that triggers neuronal injury. Na(+) influx through TTX-sensitive voltage-gated Na(+) channels may be a main mechanism for hypoxia-induced disruption of K(+) homeostasis, with DOR activation attenuating the disruption of ionic homeostasis by targeting voltage-gated Na(+) channels. In the present study we examined the role of DOR in the regulation of Na(+) influx in anoxia and simulated ischemia (oxygen-glucose deprivation) as well as the effect of DOR activation on the Na(+) influx induced by a Na(+) channel opener without anoxic/ischemic stress and explored a potential PKC mechanism underlying the DOR action. We directly measured extracellular Na(+) activity in mouse cortical slices with Na(+) selective electrodes and found that (1) anoxia-induced Na(+) influx occurred mainly through TTX-sensitive Na(+) channels; (2) DOR activation inhibited the anoxia/ischemia-induced Na(+) influx; (3) veratridine, a Na(+) channel opener, enhanced the anoxia-induced Na(+) influx; this could be attenuated by DOR activation; (4) DOR activation did not reduce the anoxia-induced Na(+) influx in the presence of chelerythrine, a broad-spectrum PKC blocker; and (5) DOR effects were blocked by PKC\u03b2II peptide inhibitor, and PKC\u03b8 pseudosubstrate inhibitor, respectively. We conclude that DOR activation inhibits anoxia-induced Na(+) influx through Na(+) channels via PKC (especially PKC\u03b2II and PKC\u03b8 isoforms) dependent mechanisms in the cortex.",

We investigated whether intracoronary followed by intravenous administration of the short-acting \u03b2-blocker landiolol prevents myocardial injury in the face of elective PCI.", 
    "6": "Patients undergoing elective PCI (n=70) were randomly assigned to the landiolol (n=35) or control (n=35) group. Landiolol or saline was administered into target vessels through a balloon catheter for 1min before and after first balloon inflation followed by continuous intravenous administration for 6h after PCI. The incidence of myocardial injury defined by cardiac troponin-I (cTnI) >/=0.05 ng/ml was 79% of the patients in the control group compared to 56% in the landiolol group (p=0.04). The cTnI level at 24h after PCI tended to be lower in the landiolol group (0.57 \u00b1 1.14 versus 1.27 \u00b1 2.48 ng/ml; p=0.07), while the CK-MB level was not significantly different between the landiolol and control groups. The incidence of peri-procedural myocardial infarction defined by cTnI >/=0.12 ng/ml was significantly (p=0.02) lower in the landiolol group (41%) compared to the control group (70%). There was no incidence of coronary spasm, hypotension, bradycardia or heart failure during and after PCI in the two groups.",

We describe the case of a 43-year-old man with portal cavernomatosis who underwent surgery to insert a splenorenal shunt, which was not placed due to the absence of signs of portal hypertension. On postoperative day 20, the patient developed abdominal distension and mild dyspnea and was diagnosed with chylous ascites, which was related to the surgery. The patient was initially treated with diet and diuretics, with no clinical response, and consequently octreotide therapy was started. Four days later, the ascites was almost resolved and an ultrasound scan at 4 months showed its complete disappearance. This article demonstrates the effectiveness of octreotide in the treatment of postsurgical chylous ascites.", 
    "9": "Heart failure still maintains a high mortality. Biomarkers reflecting different pathophysiological pathways are under evaluation to better stratify the mortality risk. The objective was to assess high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) in combination with N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) for risk stratification in a real-life cohort of ambulatory heart failure patients.", 
    "10": "We analyzed 876 consecutive patients (median age 70.3 years, median left ventricular ejection fraction 34%) treated at a heart failure unit. A combination of biomarkers reflecting myocyte injury (hs-cTnT) and myocardial stretch (NT-proBNP) was used in addition to an assessment based on established mortality risk factors (age, sex, left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association functional class, diabetes, estimated glomerular filtration rate, ischemic etiology, sodium, hemoglobin, \u03b2-blocker treatment, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker treatment).", 
    "11": "During a median follow-up of 41.4 months, 311 patients died. In the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP were independent prognosticators (P = .003 each). The combined elevation of both biomarkers above cut-off values significantly increased the risk of death (HR 7.42 [95% CI, 5.23-10.54], P < .001). When hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP were individually included in a model with established mortality risk factors, measurements of performance significantly improved. Results obtained for hs-cTnT compared with NT-proBNP were superior according to comprehensive discrimination, calibration, and reclassification analysis (net reclassification indices of 7.7% and 1.5%, respectively).",

    "13": "The pancreatic beta cell is unique in its response to nutrient by increased fuel oxidation. Recent studies have demonstrated that oxygen consumption rate (OCR) may be a valuable predictor of islet quality and long term nutrient responsiveness. To date, high-throughput and user-friendly assays for islet respiration are lacking. The aim of this study was to develop such an assay and to examine bioenergetic efficiency of rodent and human islets.", 
    "14": "The XF24 respirometer platform was adapted to islets by the development of a 24-well plate specifically designed to confine islets. The islet plate generated data with low inter-well variability and enabled stable measurement of oxygen consumption for hours. The F1F0 ATP synthase blocker oligomycin was used to assess uncoupling while rotenone together with myxothiazol/antimycin was used to measure the level of non-mitochondrial respiration. The use of oligomycin in islets was validated by reversing its effect in the presence of the uncoupler FCCP. Respiratory leak averaged to 59% and 49% of basal OCR in islets from C57Bl6/J and FVB/N mice, respectively. In comparison, respiratory leak of INS-1 cells and C2C12 myotubes was measured to 38% and 23% respectively. Islets from a cohort of human donors showed a respiratory leak of 38%, significantly lower than mouse islets.", 
    "15": "The assay for islet respiration presented here provides a novel tool that can be used to study islet mitochondrial function in a relatively high-throughput manner.

    "16": "The involuntary dual control systems of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the bladder of awake spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were investigated through simultaneous registrations of intravesical and intraabdominal pressures to observe detrusor overactivity (DO) objectively as a core symptom of an overactive bladder. SHRs (n = 6) showed the features of overactive bladder syndrome during urodynamic study, especially DO during the filling phase. After injection of the nonselective sympathetic blocking agent labetalol, DO disappeared in 3 of 6 SHRs (50%). DO frequency decreased from 0.98 \u00b1 0.22 min(-1) to 0.28 \u00b1 0.19 min(-1) (p < 0.01), and DO pressure decreased from 3.82 \u00b1 0.57 cm H(2)O to 1.90 \u00b1 0.86 cm H(2)O (p < 0.05). This suggests that the DO originating from the overactive parasympathetic nervous system is attenuated by the nonselective blocking of the sympathetic nervous system. The detailed mechanism behind this result is still not known, but parasympathetic overactivity seems to require overactive sympathetic nervous system activity in a kind of balance between these two systems. These findings are consistent with recent clinical findings suggesting that patients with idiopathic overactive bladder may have ANS dysfunction, particularly a sympathetic dysfunction. The search for newer and better drugs than the current anticholinergic drugs as the mainstay for overactive bladder will be fueled by our research on these sympathetic mechanisms. Further studies of this principle are required.",

    "18": "A middle aged woman, previously healthy with the exception of mild seasonal asthma was presented with signs of acute hepatitis. The further investigation showed acute hepatitis E virus infection associated with autoimmune thyroiditis. Treatment was started with propranolol and carbimazol whereupon hepatitis and hyperthyroidism resolved. The authors think that the observed association of acute hepatitis E virus infection and autoimmune thyroiditis suggests a role of hepatitis E virus as putative trigger of autoimmune thyroiditis. The alternative possibility of thyroid dysfunction due to pre-existing autoantibodies cannot be completely excluded but seems to be unlikely given the very mild course of seasonal asthma in this patient.", 
    "19": "To characterize the microbead-induced ocular hypertension (OHT) mouse model and investigate its potential use for preclinical screening and evaluation of ocular hypotensive agents, we tested the model's responses to major antiglaucoma drugs.", 
    "20": "Adult C57BL/6J mice were induced to develop OHT unilaterally by intracameral injection of microbeads. The effects of the most commonly used ocular hypotensive drugs, including timolol, brimonidine, brinzolamide, pilocarpine, and latanoprost, on IOP and glaucomatous neural damage were evaluated. Degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerve axons were quantitatively assessed using immunofluorescence labeling and histochemistry. Thickness of the ganglion cell complex (GCC) was also assessed with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).", 
    "21": "A microbead-induced OHT model promptly responded to drugs, such as timolol, brimonidine, and brinzolamide, that lower IOP through suppressing aqueous humor production and showed improved RGC and axon survival as compared to vehicle controls. Accordingly, SD-OCT detected significantly less reduction of GCC thickness in mice treated with all three aqueous production suppressants as compared to the vehicle contol-treated group. In contrast, drugs that increase aqueous outflow, such as pilocarpine and latanoprost, failed to decrease IOP in the microbead-induced OHT mice.", 
    "22": "Microbead-induced OHT mice carry dysfunctional aqueous outflow facility and therefore offer a unique model that allows selective screening of aqueous production suppressant antiglaucoma drugs or for studying the mechanisms regulating aqueous humor production. Our data set the stage for using GCC thickness assessed by SD-OCT as an imaging biomarker for noninvasive tracking of neuronal benefits of glaucoma therapy in this model.", 
    "23": "\u03b2-Adrenergic blocking agents (or \u03b2-blockers) have been widely used for the treatment of hypertension for the past 50 years, and continue to be recommended as a mainstay of therapy in many national guidelines. They have also been used in a variety of cardiovascular conditions commonly complicating hypertension, including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction (MI), acute and chronic heart failure, as well as conditions like essential tremor and migraine. Moreover, they have played a primary role in controlling blood pressure in patients with these specific comorbidities and in reducing cardiovascular risk with regard to the composite outcome of death, stroke, and MI among patients younger than 60 years of age. However, in patients 60 years of age or older, \u03b2-blockers were not associated with significantly lower rates of MI, heart failure or death, and demonstrated higher rates of stroke compared with other first-line therapies. Consequently, the Canadian Hypertension Education Program recommends the use of \u03b2-blockers as first-line therapy in hypertensive patients younger than 60 years of age but not for those age 60 and older, with the exception of patients with concomitant \u03b2-blocker-requiring cardiac diseases. Several reports suggest that the lack of consistent outcome data may relate to the use of traditional \u03b2-blockers such as atenolol and their ability only to reduce cardiac output, without beneficial effect on peripheral vascular resistance. The present report will describe the clinically relevant mechanisms of action of \u03b2-blockers, their pharmacological differences, their metabolic effects, and their usefulness in patients with hypertension.",

After a four week run-in period off treatment, 180 patients have to be randomized to once daily bisoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide 5/6.25 mg (R) or amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg (E). To attain blood pressure <140/<90 mmHg during six months, the doses of bisoprolol and amlodipine should be increased to 10 mg/day with the possible addition of up to 2 g/day \u03b1-methyldopa.", 
    "26": "At the time of writing of this progress report, of 206 patients enrolled in the run-in period, 140 had been randomized. At randomization, the R and E groups were similar (P \u2265 0.11) with respect to mean age (50.7 years), body mass index (28.2 kg/m(2)), blood pressure (153.9/91.5 mmHg) and the proportions of women (53.6%) and treatment na\u00efve patients (72.7%). After randomization, in the R and E groups combined, blood pressure dropped by 18.2/10.1 mmHg, 19.4/11.2 mmHg, 22.4/12.2 mmHg and 25.8/15.2 mmHg at weeks two (n = 122), four (n = 109), eight (n = 57), and 12 (n = 49), respectively. The control rate was >65% already at two weeks. At 12 weeks, 12 patients (24.5%) had progressed to the higher dose of R or E and/or had \u03b1-methyldopa added. Cohort analyses of 49 patients up to 12 weeks were confirmatory. Only two patients dropped out of the study.",

    "28": "While awaiting rescue from a disabled submarine (DISSUB), survivors will likely endure an atmosphere of rising CO2 which will eventually be lethal. Previously, it was determined that low-dose propranolol reduces resting metabolic carbon dioxide production and therefore may increase survival time in this scenario. The actions and decisions survivors would carry out in a DISSUB situation would require an unaltered cognition state. Therefore, we wanted to determine if low-dose propranolol impairs cognitive function. Eight healthy males completed a counterbalanced, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover study in which each subject received propranolol (40 mg twice daily) or placebo (lactose pill twice daily) over a 72-hour period. The alternate condition was separated by a minimum 96-hour washout period. Subjects performed a series of 6 tasks from the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) battery and answered a self-report sleepiness scale each morning and afternoon. Subjects exhibited increased accuracy in one of the ANAM tasks while on propranolol compared to placebo, but showed no difference between treatments on the other 5 tasks and sleepiness scale. These results suggest that 40 mg of propranolol taken twice daily does not significantly impair cognitive function and may be a viable option for use in a DISSUB scenario.",

The human breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and BT20 (estrogen receptor-positive and -negative; ATCC; cell density: 5\u00d710(5) cells/ml) were used. Both cell lines were cultured under sterile conditions in incubators at 37\u00b0C, with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO(2). The influences of the drugs were determined through cytotoxicity and proliferation assays and performance of a hydrogen peroxide assay. Morphological observations (light microscopy) and metabolic investigations (pH value, glucose) were also performed.", 
    "31": "The application of the beta-blocker propranolol resulted in highly cytotoxic effects (>90%) in both cell lines. In contrast, bisoprolol did not have any effects, neither in cytotoxicity tests nor in cell proliferation assays. The anti-diabetic metformin had a higher cytotoxic influence on the BT20 than did on the MCF7 cell line. The cell proliferation of BT20 was significantly inhibited after the addition of 2.5 mg/ml metformin and of 2.5 mg/ml glitazone. The application of glitazone also resulted in an increase of hydrogen peroxide and a decrease of the pH value.",

    "33": "Stress can trigger the relapse of drug use in recovering cocaine addicts and reinstatement in rodent models through mechanisms that may involve norepinephrine release and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor activation. The present study examined the role of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor subtypes in the stressor-induced reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-induced (15 mg/kg i.p.) conditioned place preference in mice. Forced swim (6 min at 22\u00b0C) stress or activation of central noradrenergic neurotransmission by administration of the selective \u03b1(2) adrenergic receptor antagonist 2-[(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-1H-isoindole (BRL-44,408) (10 mg/kg i.p.) induced reinstatement in wild-type, but not \u03b2- adrenergic receptor-deficient Adrb1/Adrb2 double-knockout, mice. In contrast, cocaine administration (15 mg/kg i.p.) resulted in reinstatement in both wild-type and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor knockout mice. Stress-induced reinstatement probably involved \u03b2(2) adrenergic receptors. The \u03b2(2) adrenergic receptor antagonist -(isopropylamino)-1-[(7-methyl-4-indanyl)oxy]butan-2-ol (ICI-118,551) (1 or 2 mg/kg i.p.) blocked reinstatement by forced swim or BRL-44,408, whereas administration of the nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (2 or 4 mg/kg i.p.) or the \u03b2(2) adrenergic receptor-selective agonist clenbuterol (2 or 4 mg/kg i.p.) induced reinstatement. Forced swim-induced, but not BRL-44,408-induced, reinstatement was also blocked by a high (20 mg/kg) but not low (10 mg/kg) dose of the \u03b2(1) adrenergic receptor antagonist betaxolol, and isoproterenol-induced reinstatement was blocked by pretreatment with either ICI-118,551 or betaxolol, suggesting a potential cooperative role for \u03b2(1) and \u03b2(2) adrenergic receptors in stress-induced reinstatement. Overall, these findings suggest that targeting \u03b2-adrenergic receptors may represent a promising pharmacotherapeutic strategy for preventing drug relapse, particularly in cocaine addicts whose drug use is stress related.", 
    "34": "The fruit extracts of Citrus aurantium (bitter orange) are traditionally used as weight-loss products and as appetite supressants. An important fruit component is p-synephrine, which is structurally similar to the adrenergic agents. Weight-loss and adrenergic actions are always related to metabolic changes and this work was designed to investigate a possible action of the C. aurantium extract on liver metabolism. The isolated perfused rat liver was used to measure catabolic and anabolic pathways, including oxygen uptake and perfusion pressure. The C. aurantium extract and p-synephrine increased glycogenolysis, glycolysis, oxygen uptake and perfusion pressure. These changes were partly sensitive to \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists. p-Synephrine (200 \u03bcM) produced an increase in glucose output that was only 15% smaller than the increment caused by the extract containing 196 \u03bcM p-synephrine. At low concentrations the C. aurantium extract tended to increase gluconeogenesis, but at high concentrations it was inhibitory, opposite to what happened with p-synephrine. The action of the C. aurantium extract on liver metabolism is similar to the well known actions of adrenergic agents and can be partly attributed to its content in p-synephrine. Many of these actions are catabolic and compatible with the weight-loss effects usually attributed to C. aurantium.",

Urological symptoms were ascertained in a 2-hour, in person interview. Urinary incontinence was defined as urine leakage occurring weekly or more often during the last year. Medications used in the last month were considered current use. Associations of 20+ medications and prevalent urinary incontinence were examined using multivariate logistic regression (ORs and 95% CIs) with adjustments for known urinary incontinence risk factors.", 
    "37": "The prevalence of urinary incontinence in the analysis sample was 9.0% in women and 4.6% in men. For women the prevalence was highest among users of certain antihistamines (28.4%) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (22.9%). For men the prevalence was highest among angiotensin II receptor blocker (22.2%) and loop diuretic (19.1%) users. After final multivariate adjustment there were significant positive associations for certain antihistamines, beta receptor agonists, angiotensin II receptor blockers and estrogens with urinary incontinence in women (all ORs greater than 1.7), and a borderline significant association for anticonvulsants (OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.00, 3.07). Among men only anticonvulsants were associated with urinary incontinence after final adjustments (OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.24, 5.03), although angiotensin II receptor blockers showed an adjusted association of borderline significance (OR 2.21; 95% CI 0.96, 5.10).",

    "41": "In 60.2% (n = 71) of the patients, any serum phosphorous level at admission and at the third day or seventh day after admission to pediatric intensive care unit was in hypophosphatemic range. Sepsis was present in 22.9% (n = 27) of the children studied and was associated with hypophosphatemia (P = .02). Hypophosphatemia was also associated with use of furosemide (P = .04), use of steroid (P = .04), use of \u03b2(2) agonist (P = .026), and use of an H(2) blocker (P = .004). There was a significant association between hypophosphatemia and the rate to attain target caloric requirements by enteral route (P = .007). The median time to attain target caloric requirements by enteral route was 2.9 \u00b1 1.9 (0.2-10) days in the normophosphatemic group and 4.4 \u00b1 2.8 (0.3-12) days in the hypophosphatemic group. In the multiple regression model, solely the rate to attain the target caloric requirements by enteral route demonstrated independent association with hypophosphatemia (P = .006; \u03b2 = .27; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.09). Significant association was found between hypophosphatemia and the duration of mechanical ventilation and between hypophosphatemia and pediatric intensive care unit length of stay (P = .02 and P = .001, respectively).", 
    "42": "Critically ill pediatric patients are prone to hypophosphatemia, especially if they cannot be fed early by enteral route. Hypophosphatemia is associated with an increased duration of mechanical ventilation and increased length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit, suggesting that active repletion might improve these parameters.", 
    "43": "The purpose of this review is to present the preclinical, epidemiological and clinical data relevant to the association between \u03b2-blockers and breast cancer progression. Preclinical studies have shown that \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) signalling can inhibit multiple cellular processes involved in breast cancer progression and metastasis, including extracellular matrix invasion, expression of inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines, angiogenesis and tumour immune responses. This has led to the hypothesis that the commonly prescribed class of \u03b2-AR antagonist drugs (\u03b2-blockers) may favourably impact cancer progression. A number of recent pharmacoepidemiological studies have examined the association between \u03b2-blocker exposure and breast cancer progression. The results from these studies have suggested a potential role for targeting the \u03b2-AR pathway in breast cancer patients. Larger observational studies are, however, required to confirm these results. Questions regarding the type of \u03b2-blocker, predictive biomarkers or tumour characteristics, appropriate treatment paradigms and, most importantly, efficacy must also be answered in randomized clinical studies before \u03b2-blockers can be considered a therapeutic option for patients with breast cancer.", 
    "44": "Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling (EC coupling) links the electrical excitation of the cell membrane to the mechanical contractile machinery of the heart. Calcium channels are major players of EC coupling and are regulated by voltage and Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM). CaM binds to the IQ motif located in the C terminus of the Ca(v)1.2 channel and induces Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation (CDI) and facilitation (CDF). Mutation of Ile to Glu (Ile1624Glu) in the IQ motif abolished regulation of the channel by CDI and CDF. Here, we addressed the physiological consequences of such a mutation in the heart. Murine hearts expressing the Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) mutation were generated in adult heterozygous mice through inactivation of the floxed WT Ca(v)1.2(L2) allele by tamoxifen-induced cardiac-specific activation of the MerCreMer Cre recombinase. Within 10 days after the first tamoxifen injection these mice developed dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) accompanied by apoptosis of cardiac myocytes (CM) and fibrosis. In Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) hearts, the activity of phospho-CaM kinase II and phospho-MAPK was increased. CMs expressed reduced levels of Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) channel protein and I(Ca). The Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) channel showed \"CDI\" kinetics. Despite a lower sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) content, cellular contractility and global Ca(2+) transients remained unchanged because the EC coupling gain was up-regulated by an increased neuroendocrine activity. Treatment of mice with metoprolol and captopril reduced DCM in Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) hearts at day 10. We conclude that mutation of the IQ motif to IE leads to dilated cardiomyopathy and death.", 
    "45": "Amygdala activity mediates the acquisition and consolidation of emotional experiences; we have recently shown that post-acquisition reactivation of this structure is necessary for the long-term storage of conditioned taste aversion (CTA). However, the specific neurotransmitters involved in such reactivation are not known. The aim of the present study was to investigate extracellular changes of glutamate, norepinephrine, and dopamine within the rat amygdala using in vivo microdialysis during the acquisition and 1-h post-acquisition of CTA paradigm. Microdialysis monitoring showed a significant norepinephrine increase related to novel taste exposure and a glutamate increase after gastric malaise induction by i.p. LiCl administration. Interestingly, we found a spontaneous concomitant increase of glutamate and norepinephrine, but not dopamine, 45 min after conditioning, suggesting the presence of aversive learning-dependent post-acquisition signals in the amygdala. These signals seem to be involved in CTA consolidation process, since post-trial blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate or \u03b2-adrenergic receptors impaired long- but not short-term memory. These data suggest that CTA long-term storage involves post-acquisition release of glutamate and norepinephrine in the amygdala.",

    "49": "A total of 456 patients with a discharge diagnosis of acute MI were identified and included in the study, of which 386 had non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI) and 70 had ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI). Compared with patients with NSTEMI, patients who had STEMI were more often prescribed aspirin (66% vs 43%; P = 0.004), \u03b2-blockers (61% vs 46%; P = 0.018), and thrombolytic therapy (9% vs 0.3%; P = 0.0001). In the multivariable analysis, aspirin use was associated with a 23% decreased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.60-0.98, P = 0.033) and \u03b2-blocker use was associated with a 36% decreased risk of death (HR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.51-0.81, P = 0.0002). Statins (HR: 0.82, P = 0.18) and catheter-based revascularization (HR: 0.57, P = 0.09) did not have an impact on the risk of death. Compared with patients with limited cancer, advanced cancer patients were twice as likely to die (HR: 2.12, 95 CI: 1.47-3.04, P < 0.0001). Previous chemotherapy (P = 0.005) and chest radiotherapy (P = 0.017) were associated with increased 1-year mortality, whereas hyperlipidemia (P = 0.018) was protective.",

    "52": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of aquaporin-1 (AQP-1) and aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) in the renal tubule of rats fed with a high-salt diet and its modulation by the AT1 receptor blocker losartan.", 
    "53": "The experiments were performed in four groups of rats fed for 3 weeks with the following diets: regular rat chow (NS); high-salt (8% NaCl) chow (HS), NS plus losartan (NS-L) and HS plus losartan (HS-L). Losartan (40 mg x kg(-1)) was administered in the drinking water. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and renal function were evaluated. The intrarenal levels of angiotensin II (Ang II), TGF-\u03b2(1), \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), AQP-1 and AQP-2 were determined by immunohistochemistry. AQP-1 and AQP-2 protein levels were measured by western blot analysis.", 
    "54": "A high-sodium diet downregulated AQP-1 and AQP-2 expression levels in the proximal tubule and collecting duct, respectively. The high-sodium diet also induced Ang II, TGF-\u03b2(1) and \u03b1-SMA overexpression and decreased eNOS expression in the renal cortex and medulla. Losartan increased the diuresis and natriuresis, favoring urinary sodium concentration. Additionally, losartan prevented the profibrogenic response, decreasing Ang II, TGF-\u03b2(1) and \u03b1-SMA levels and normalizing AQP-2 expression in the HS-L group. AQP-1 expression was upregulated by losartan in both the NS-L and HS-L groups.", 
    "55": "These results show that increased intrarenal Ang II in rats fed with a high-salt diet downregulates renal AQP-1 and AQP-2 expressions. In addition, although losartan increased diuresis and natriuresis, it prevented the downregulation of aquaporins, favoring urinary sodium concentration.",

Patients with significant organ disease or complications, women of childbearing age refusing reliable contraceptive method, patients with known contraindications (like symptomatic bradycardia, significant atrioventricular blockade, sick sinus syndrome) and patients with known hypersensitivity reactions to bisoprolol and unwilling patients were excluded. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was percentage of patients achieving blood pressure (BP) \u2264140/90 mm\u2002Hg at the end of 12 weeks, while multiple secondary outcome measures were assessed.",

There was significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (-25.29; SD: 13.22 mm\u2002Hg), diastolic blood pressure (-14.14; SD: 7.67 mm\u2002Hg) and heart rate (-12/min; SD: 6.15) compared with baseline (all p values <0.05). The median dose of bisoprolol and average period required for the response were 5 mg/day and 33 days, respectively. Bisoprolol was found to be well tolerated in the patients up to 10 mg/day. A total of 1.9% patients showed adverse events, which were mild to moderate in severity without any severe adverse event. None required treatment withdrawal.",

    "62": "The aim of this study was to identify the relative impact of adrenergic and cholinergic activity on atrial fibrillation (AF) inducibility and blood pressure (BP) in a model for obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with sympathovagal disbalance, AF, and postapneic BP rises. Renal denervation (RDN) reduces renal efferent and possibly also afferent sympathetic activity and BP in resistant hypertension. The effects of RDN compared with \u03b2-blockade by atenolol on atrial electrophysiological changes, AF inducibility, and BP during obstructive events and on shortening of atrial effective refractory period (AERP) induced by high-frequency stimulation of ganglionated plexi were investigated in 20 anesthetized pigs. Tracheal occlusion with applied negative tracheal pressure (NTP; at -80 mbar) induced pronounced AERP shortening and increased AF inducibility in all of the pigs. RDN but not atenolol reduced NTP-induced AF-inducibility (20% versus 100% at baseline; P=0.0001) and attenuated NTP-induced AERP shortening more than atenolol (27\u00b15 versus 43\u00b13 ms after atenolol; P=0.0272). Administration of atropine after RDN or atenolol completely inhibited NTP-induced AERP shortening. AERP shortening induced by high-frequency stimulation of ganglionated plexi was not influenced by RDN, suggesting that changes in sensitivity of ganglionated plexi do not play a role in the antiarrhythmic effect of RDN. Postapneic BP rise was inhibited by RDN and not modified by atenolol. We showed that vagally mediated NTP-induced AERP shortening is modulated by RDN or atenolol, which emphasizes the importance of autonomic disbalance in obstructive sleep apnea-associated AF. Renal denervation displays antiarrhythmic effects by reducing NTP-induced AERP shortening and inhibits postapneic BP rises associated with obstructive events.", 
    "63": "Recently, it has been postulated that long-term use of beta blockers might decrease the risk of certain types of cancer because of weakening of norepinephrine signaling. Previous studies on colorectal cancer (CRC) yielded inconsistent results, but lacked information on covariates. Thus, the authors investigated the association of beta blocker use and CRC risk in a large population-based case-control study (DACHS study).", 
    "64": "Between 2003 and 2007, information on beta blocker use and potential confounders was collected by personal interviews for 1762 CRC cases and 1708 control individuals from Germany. The association of CRC risk and beta blocker use and subclasses of beta blockers was estimated by multiple logistic regression. In addition, site- and stage-specific analyses were performed.", 
    "65": "After adjustment for covariates, no association was observed with beta blocker use (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-1.29) or with duration of beta blocker use. Also, the analysis by subclasses of beta blockers (cardioselectivity) and active ingredients (metoprolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, and atenolol) or by CRC subsite showed no associations. In stage-specific analyses, long-term beta blocker use (6+ years) was associated with a significantly higher risk of stage IV CRC (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.25-3.27).", 
    "66": "Our adjusted results do not support the hypothesis that beta blocker use is associated with decreased risk of CRC. In contrast, we found a positive association of long-term beta blocker use and risk of stage IV CRC. The latter result should be further evaluated in future studies.",

There are now multiple lines of evidence demonstrating that the \u03b2-adrenoceptor ( \u03b2-AR) signaling plays an important role in the progression and metastasis of cancer and may become a novel target for cancer therapy. Little information exists regarding the status of \u03b2-ARs and their postreceptor intracellular signaling cascade in the development of human HCC. This study was conducted to detect the expression signal transduction of the \u03b2-ARs in liver membranes obtained from patients with HCC and elucidate their possible implication on HCC development.", 
    "68": "The \u03b2-AR density and subtype distribution were determined by receptor binding studies. Protein levels of the \u03b2(2)-AR and G(s)(\u03b1) protein were determined by Western blot analysis. The receptor coupling efficiency and biochemical activities of the adenylate cyclase(AC) was also determined.", 
    "69": "In HCC liver membranes, the \u03b2(2)-AR density was higher than the density in the nonadjacent nontumor liver membranes. The \u03b2(2)-AR protein expression was 1.5-fold increased as compared with nonmalignant controls, and positively correlated with the receptor density. The G s protein expression as well as the receptor, AC and G protein-stimulated activation of the cAMP formation was reduced in HCC.", 
    "70": "The \u03b2(2)-AR was upregulated in human HCC. Despite this upregulation of the receptor,there was an altered postreceptor signal transduction in HCC liver. The mechanisms responsible for this change in the growth of HCC and the nature of this alteration remain unclear.", 
    "71": "Although selective beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists are known to provide neuroprotective effects after brain ischemia, dose-response relationships of their neuroprotective effects have not been examined. The present study was conducted to evaluate whether the degree of brain protection against transient forebrain ischemia would be influenced by different doses of selective beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists, esmolol and landiolol, in rats. Adult male S.D. rats received intravenous infusion of saline 0.5 ml/h, esmolol 20, 200, 2,000 \u03bcg/kg/min, or landiolol 5, 50, 500 \u03bcg/kg/min. Infusion was initiated 30 min prior to ischemia and continued for 24h. Ten-minute forebrain ischemia was induced by hemorrhagic hypotension and occlusion of the bilateral carotid arteries. Neurological and histological examinations were performed. Neurological deficit scores at 1, 4 and 7 days were lower, and the number of intact neurons in CA1 hippocampal region was larger in the rats treated with esmolol and landiolol after ischemia, compared with saline-treated rats (P<0.05), whereas no difference was found among different doses of esmolol and landiolol. These results suggested that selective beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists improved neurological and histological outcomes following forebrain ischemia in rats, irrespective of their doses.", 
    "72": "Press-coated sustained release tablets offer a valuable, cheap and easy manufacture alternative to the highly expensive, multi-step manufacture and filling of coated beads. In this study, propranolol HCl press-coated tablets were prepared using hydroxylpropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) as tablet coating material together with carbopol 971P and compressol as release modifiers. The prepared formulations were optimized for zero-order release using artificial neural network program (INForm, Intelligensys Ltd, North Yorkshire, UK). Typical zero-order release kinetics with extended release profile for more than 12 h was obtained. The most important variables considered by the program in optimizing formulations were type and proportion of polymer mixture in the coat layer and distribution ratio of drug between core and coat. The key elements found were; incorporation of 31-38 % of the drug in the coat, fixing the amount of polymer in coat to be not less than 50 % of coat layer. Optimum zero-order release kinetics (linear regression r2 = 0.997 and Peppas model n value > 0.80) were obtained when 2.5-10 % carbopol and 25-42.5% compressol were incorporated into the 50 % HPMC coat layer.", 
    "73": "Beta-blockers are underutilised in heart failure because clinicians may be unsure whether all beta-blockers are useful, how therapy should be initiated and whether beta-blockers are contraindicated in some patients. Bisoprolol, carvedilol and metoprolol succinate have been clearly proven to reduce mortality and hospitalisation in patients with Class II to IV heart failure; limited evidence also support short-acting metoprolol tartrate and nebivolol. Initiating dose should be very low (1.25 mg bisoprolol, 3.125 mg carvedilol, 12.5 mg metoprolol succinate) and increased gradually over weeks. Treatment benefit appears proportional to magnitude of heart rate reduction and thus target dose should be the maximum tolerated for adequate bradycardia. Even in decompensated heart failure or those with coexisting bronchospasm, beta-blockers are not contraindicated although the dose may have to be reduced or withheld temporarily. The consistent trial data should reassure clinicians and encourage them to confidently initiate beta blockers in patients with systolic heart failure.", 
    "74": "Autonomic nervous system activity is essential for regulation of ventricular repolarization (VR) and plays an important role in several arrhythmogenic conditions. This study in 31 healthy adult subjects (16 men, 15 women) evaluated the VR response to pharmacologically modulated autonomic nervous system activity applying vectorcardiography (VCG) analysis. During continuous VCG recording, 0.01-0.1 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) isoprenaline (Iso) was infused at an increasing flow rate until three targeted heart rates (HR) were reached. After Iso washout, one intravenous bolus of 0.04 mg/kg atropine was given followed by an intravenous bolus of 0.2 mg/kg propranolol. A 5-min steady-state VCG recording was analyzed for each of the seven phases (including baseline 1 and 2). Furthermore, during the first 4 min following atropine, six periods of 10-s VCG were selected for subanalysis to evaluate the time course of change. The analysis included QRS, QT, and T-peak to T-end intervals, measures of the QRS and T vectors and their relation, as well as T-loop morphology parameters. By increasing HR, Iso infusion decreased HR dependent parameters reflecting total heterogeneity of VR (T area) and action potential morphology (ventricular gradient). In contrast, Iso prolonged QT HR corrected according to Bazett and increased the T-peak to T-end-to-QT ratio to levels observed in arrhythmogenic conditions. HR acceleration after atropine was accompanied by a transient paradoxical QT prolongation and delayed HR adaptation of T area and ventricular gradient. In addition to the expected HR adaptation, the VR response to \u03b2-adrenoceptor stimulation with Iso and to muscarinic receptor blockade with atropine thus included alterations previously observed in congenital and acquired long QT syndromes, demonstrating substantial overlap between physiological and pathophysiological electrophysiology.",

Using the Morris water maze to assess spatial memory, we found that escape latency and swimming path length to the platform were significantly shorter in the landiolol-treated rats, compared with the saline-treated rats at 4 and 11 days after ischaemia (P<0.05). The mean (SD) infarct area was 19.1 (8.0)% in the striatum and 18.6 (10.0)% in the hippocampus of the landiolol-treated rats, and 16.8 (14.0)% and 16.8 (15.0)% in the striatum and hippocampus, respectively, of esmolol-treated rats.

Baseline was defined as the time when the subjects were started on latanoprost monotherapy. Examination periods were defined as 1, 2, and 3 months the switch to TTFC therapy, and 1-2 months after the switch back to latanoprost monotherapy. The parameters examined were intraocular pressure (IOP), conjunctival hyperemia, and corneal erosion, as well as blood pressure and heart rate. A survey was conducted 1 and 3 months after the switch to TTFC therapy with a focus on each subject's impressions.", 
    "81": "Among the 70 enrolled subjects, the 58 (29 men, 29 women) who completed the protocol were analyzed. The IOP before and at 1, 2, and 3 months after the switch to TTFC therapy was measured and again after the switch back to latanoprost monotherapy. The results indicated that TTFC therapy significantly reduced the IOP (P < 0.001) and significantly decreased the heart rate, but it did not significantly change either the systolic or diastolic blood pressure. TTFC therapy also did not significantly change either the conjunctival hyperemia or corneal erosion. In the questionnaire, the patients indicated that their impression was that there was no significant difference between the two ophthalmic solutions.",

Available data indicates that sexual dysfunction is more frequent in treated than in untreated patients, generating the hypothesis that antihypertensive therapy might be associated with sexual dysfunction. Several lines of evidence suggest that differences between antihypertensive drugs exist regarding their effects on sexual function. Older antihypertensive drugs (diuretics, beta blockers) exert detrimental effects on erectile function whereas newer drugs (nebivolol, angiotensin receptor blockers) have neutral or even beneficial effects. Phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 inhibitors are effective in hypertensive patients and can be safely administered even when multidrug regimes are used. Precautions need to be taken with alpha blockers or patients with uncontrolled high-risk hypertension, while co-administration with nitrates is contraindicated.",

Analysis was performed using cell viability, migration, and tubulogenesis assays, as well as quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Western blots and ELISA assays were used to assess protein expression.", 
    "91": "Treatment with propranolol led to a dose dependent cytotoxic effect in hemangioma endothelial cells with decreased cell viability, migration, and tubulogenesis. This cytotoxic effect was VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) dependent, as demonstrated by decreased VEGF, VEGF-R1, and VEGF-R2 production. Decreased signaling through the VEGF pathway resulted in downregulation of PI3/Akt and p38/MAPK activity. Decreased VEGF activity was mediated through the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 pathway but not through NF-\u03ba\u03b2 signaling.", 
    "92": "Collectively, these data suggest that propranolol exerts its suppressive effects on hemangiomas through the HIF-1\u03b1-VEGF-A angiogenesis axis, with effects mediated through the PI3/Akt and p38/MAPK pathways. These findings provide a plausible mechanism of action of propranolol on regression of infantile hemangiomas.", 
    "93": "When stressed, toadfish become ureotelic and excrete almost all of their nitrogenous waste in 1-3 daily pulses of urea-N across the gills. Intravascular injections of 5-hydroxytyptamine (5-HT; serotonin) and analogues also elicit marked excretory pulses of urea-N from toadfish in vivo, suggesting that 5-HT release is the proximate trigger for spontaneous pulses. However it is unclear whether 5-HT is acting on the gills directly or elsewhere to cause the effect indirectly. A perfused whole gill preparation which maintained normal pressure relationships and stable vascular resistance was employed to address this question. Bolus injections into the ventral aortic perfusate of either 5-HT (1, 10 \u03bcmol kg(-1)) or the specific 5-HT(2) receptor agonist \u03b1-methyl 5-HT (1, 10 \u03bcmol kg(-1)) elicited rapid urea-N pulses from perfused toadfish gills. The effective doses, the post-injection delays (5.5 \u00b1 1.3 min, range=2-22), the percent occurrences (57-85%), and the magnitude of the induced urea-N pulses (615.4 \u00b1 131.3 \u03bcmol-N kg(-1), range 66.0-2634.0), were all similar to those previously reported when these agents were injected in vivo. Bolus injections of 5-HT and \u03b1-methyl 5-HT also elicited a biphasic response in ventral aortic pressure, reflecting an initial rapid short-lived vasodilation and a subsequent longer-lasting vasoconstriction. These events were similar to those which have been recorded to occur at a greater frequency during spontaneous urea-N pulsing in vivo. Neither the urea-N pulsing nor the cardiovascular responses to 5-HT were inhibited by the 5-HT(2A) receptor subtype blocker, ketanserin (pre-injection with 10 \u03bcmol kg(-1) plus 33 \u03bcmol L(-1) in the perfusate). Overall, these results provide strong support for the idea that the proximate stimulus for natural urea pulsing in vivo is 5-HT mobilization, acting directly in the gills.", 
    "94": "The \u03b2(1)-adrenoceptor (\u03b2(1)AR) is the site of action of beta blockers used in the treatment of cardiac-related illnesses. Two beta blockers, carvedilol and bucindolol, show distinctive activities compared to other beta blockers and have been proposed as treatments tailored to the Arg/Gly389(8.56) polymorphism of the human \u03b2(1)AR. Both carvedilol and bucindolol are classified as biased agonists, because they stimulate G protein-independent signaling, while acting as either inverse or partial agonists of the G protein pathway. We have determined the crystal structures of a thermostabilized avian \u03b2(1)AR mutant bound to bucindolol and to carvedilol at 3.2 and 2.3 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. In comparison to other beta blockers, bucindolol and carvedilol interact with additional residues, in extracellular loop 2 and transmembrane helix 7, which may promote G protein-independent signaling. The structures also suggest that there may be a structural explanation for the pharmacological differences arising from the Arg/Gly389(8.56) polymorphism.",

    "117": "Ventricular arrhythmia (VA) in structurally normal hearts can be broadly considered under non-life-threatening monomorphic and life-threatening polymorphic rhythms. Monomorphic VA is classified on the basis of site of origin in the heart, and the most common areas are the ventricular outflow tracts and left ventricular fascicles. The morphology of the QRS complexes on electrocardiogram is an excellent tool to identify the site of origin of the rhythm. Although these arrhythmias are common and generally carry an excellent prognosis, rare sudden death events have been reported. Very frequent ventricular ectopy may also result in a cardiomyopathy in a minority of patients. Suppression of VA may be achieved using calcium-channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, and class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs. Radiofrequency ablation has emerged as an excellent option to eliminate these arrhythmias, although certain foci including aortic cusps and epicardium may be technically challenging. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is rare and generally occurs in patients with genetic ion channel disorders including long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, and short QT syndrome. Unlike monomorphic VT, these arrhythmic syndromes are associated with sudden death. While the cardiac gross morphology is normal, suggesting a structurally normal heart, abnormalities exist at the molecular level and predispose them to arrhythmias. Another fascinating area, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation and early repolarization syndrome, are undergoing research for a genetic basis.",

The methods are based on charge transfer complexation reaction of ATN as n-electron donor with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ), 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (picric acid; PA) as pi-acceptors to give highly colored radical anion species. The colored products were quantified spectrophotometrically at 590 nm with DDQ (method A) and at 420 nm with both DNP (method B) and PA (method C). Under the optimized experimental conditions, Beer's law is obeyed over the concentration ranges of 3-48, 2-24 and 1.5-18 \u03bcg/mL ATN for method A, method B and method C, respectively. The molar absorptivity, Sandell sensitivity, limits of detection and quantification are also reported. The effects of reaction medium, reaction time and reagent concentration on the sensitivity and stability of the complexes formed have been examined. The proposed methods were successfully applied to the determination of ATN in pure form and commercial tablets with good accuracy and precision. Statistical comparison of the results was performed using Student's t-test and F-ratio at 95% confidence level and the results showed no significant difference between the reference and proposed methods with regard to accuracy and precision. Further, the accuracy and reliability of the methods were confirmed by recovery studies via standard addition technique.",

Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome (JLNS) is an uncommon form of LQTS, having autosomal recessive transmission, and is associated with congenital deafness. We report a case of JLNS in a child who presented to us with refractory epilepsy. The cardiac cause of seizures was suspected as the child was hypotensive and pulseless during the episode of seizures. The child was diagnosed as JLNS based on Schwartz diagnostic criteria for LQTS and congenital sensorineural deafness. The child responded well to \u03b2-blocker therapy. Antiepileptic drugs were stopped. The screening of family members with ECG revealed a QT interval more than required for diagnosis of LQTS but they were asymptomatic. All asymptomatic family members were also put on metoprolol. All of them showed great improvement with the reduction of the QT interval on ECG. The patient was doing well on immediate follow-up.",

The aim of the present study was to examine any possible protective effects of levosimendan in an in vivo pig model of renal I/R injury. In 40 anesthetized pigs (eight groups of five pigs each), I/R was induced by clamping-reopening the left renal artery. During ischemia, in three groups of pigs, levosimendan and the multiorgan preservation solution Custodiol, alone or in combination with levosimendan, were infused in the renal artery. In two other groups of animals, levosimendan in combination with Custodiol was administered after the intrarenal nitric-oxide (NO) synthase blocker N(\u03c9)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K(+) channel (K(ATP) channel) inhibitor 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD). In the other animals, saline, L-NAME, or 5-HD were administered alone. Throughout the experiments, urinary N-acetyl-\u03b2-glucosaminidase (NAG) release was measured, and renal function was assessed. Moreover, renal biopsy samples were taken for the detection of apoptosis and tissue peroxidation. In pigs treated with levosimendan or the combination of levosimendan and Custodiol, NAG, peroxidation, and apoptotic markers were lower than in animals treated with Custodiol alone. In addition, renal function was better preserved, and cell survival and antioxidant systems were more activated. All beneficial effects were prevented by L-NAME and 5-HD. In conclusion, levosimendan alone or in combination with Custodiol exerted better protection against renal I/R injuries than Custodiol alone through antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and prosurvival actions depending on mitochondrial K(ATP) channels and NO-related mechanisms.",

Male SH and WKY rats were treated with vehicle or nebivolol 0.3, 3, or 10 mg kg(-1) (i.v.) and effects on blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and blood pressure variability (BPV) were recorded. Plasma pharmacokinetics of d- and l-nebivolol was studied by traditional blood sampling. Short-term and beat-to-beat BPV was assessed by standard deviation and spectral analysis of BP recording, respectively. Nebivolol showed enantioselective pharmacokinetics in both experimental groups; clearance of l-nebivolol was significantly greater than d-enantiomer. Clearance of nebivolol was significantly reduced in SHR with regards to WKY animals. Hypotensive response to nebivolol 3 and 10 mg kg(-1) was significantly enhanced in SHR compared with normotensive animals. Spectral analysis of beat-to-beat BPV showed a greater reduction in low frequency BPV in SHR than in WKY rats. Nebivolol 3 and 10 mg kg(-1) significantly reduced ratio low frequency/high frequency BPV only in SHR. Short-term BPV was markedly reduced by nebivolol 0.3, 3, and 10 mg kg(-1) in WKY and SHR. In conclusion, the hypertensive stage in SHR modifies nebivolol pharmacokinetic properties and enhances its hypotensive response due to a greater attenuation in vascular sympathetic activity and enhancement of endothelial-derived NO activity. Nebivolol markedly attenuates short-term BPV in both experimental groups providing beneficial cardiovascular effects by both controlling high blood pressure and its short-term variability.",

    "183": "The serotonin 5-HT(4) receptor (5-HT(4)R) is coded by a complex gene that produces four mRNA splice variants in mice (5-HT(4(a))R, 5-HT(4(b))R, 5-HT(4(e))R, 5-HT(4(f))R). This receptor has highly dynamic expression in brain development and its splice variants differ in their developmental trajectories. Since 5-HT(4)Rs are important in forebrain function (including forebrain control of serotonergic activity in the brainstem), we investigated the susceptibility of 5-HT(4)R expression in the mouse embryonic telencephalon to prenatal maternal stress and altered serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) levels. Because the gene coding the adrenergic \u03b2(2) receptor (\u03b2(2)AR) is embedded in the 5-HT(4)R gene, we also investigated whether 5-HT(4)R mRNA levels were modulated by selective \u03b2(2)AR agents. Timed-pregnant C57BL/6 mice were treated beginning at embryonic day (E) 14 and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to assess the mRNA levels of all 5-HT(4)R splice variants and \u03b2(2)AR in the embryonic telencephalon at E17. Maternal prenatal stress and 5-HT depletion with pCPA, a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, reduced the levels of the 5-HT(4(b))R splice variant. Terbutaline (a selective \u03b2(2)AR agonist) and ICI 118,551 (a selective \u03b2(2)AR antagonist) had no effect on \u03b2(2)AR and 5-HT(4)R mRNA levels. These results show that prenatal stress and reduced 5-HT levels can alter 5-HT(4)R expression in the developing forebrain and that some 5-HT(4)R splice variants may be more susceptible than others.",

For example, there are conflicting data about the cardiovascular risks of bronchodilators in HF patients who may experience worse outcomes with inhaled beta-2 agonists via arrhythmogenesis, ischemia, and/or attenuation of beta-blocker benefits. In contrast, the long-acting anticholinergic class of bronchodilators has a more reassuring safety profile. Anticholinergic bronchodilators may be the preferred first-line agents for COPD patients with comorbid HF, yet data supporting these recommendations are limited. Therapeutic trials in COPD patients have generally excluded patients with significant HF and vice-versa.

Incessant VT may develop due to defibrillator-induced storming-a condition where implantable cardioverter-defibrillator discharges result in a hyperadrenergic state, provoking further VT and defibrillator discharge. We describe the case of a 14-year-old boy with CPVT caused by a calsequestrin-2 mutation, who presented with defibrillator-induced storming refractory to \u03b2-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, amiodarone, and dronedarone. Flecainide and \u03b2-blocker use suppressed incessant VT and defibrillator-induced storming.", 
    "213": "A new high-performance liquid chromatographic method is described for the determination of bisoprolol in human plasma. The proposed method was based on the derivatization of bisoprolol with 4-chloro-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole in borate buffer at pH 9.5 to yield a fluorescent product. Chromatographic separation of bisoprolol was achieved by using isocratic elution at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min on a C18 reversed-phase column (Inertsil, 4 \u03bcm, 150 4.6 mm) at 40\u00b0C. The mobile phase used for the analysis was methanol-water (70:30, % v/v). Fluorescence detector was used at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 458 and 525 nm, respectively. The method was validated for linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, precision, accuracy, recovery and system suitability. The assay was linear over the concentration range of 10-2000 ng/mL. This method was applied in pharmacokinetic studies of bisoprolol preparations in healthy volunteers.", 
    "214": "Clinical studies have established the role of cigarette smoking as a risk factor in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We have shown that nicotine promotes mesangial cell proliferation and hypertrophy via nonneuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The \u03b17-nAChR is one of the most important subunits of the nAChRs. These studies were designed to test the hypothesis that nicotine worsens renal injury in rats with 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx) and that the \u03b17-nAChR subunit is required for these effects. We studied five different groups: Sham, 5/6Nx, 5/6Nx + nicotine (Nic; 100 \u03bcg/ml dry wt), 5/6Nx + Nic + \u03b17-nAChR blocker methyllicaconitine (MLA; 3 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1) sq), and Sham + Nic. Blood pressure was measured by the tail-cuff method, and urine was collected for proteinuria. After 12 wk, the rats were euthanized and kidneys were collected. We observed expression of the \u03b17-nAChR in the proximal and distal tubules. The administration of nicotine induced a small increase in blood pressure and resulted in cotinine levels similar to those found in the plasma of smokers. In 5/6Nx rats, the administration of nicotine significantly increased urinary protein excretion (onefold), worsened the glomerular injury score and increased fibronectin (\u223c 50%), NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4; \u223c100%), and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 expression (\u223c200%). The administration of nicotine to sham rats increased total proteinuria but not albuminuria, suggesting direct effects on tubular protein reabsorption. These effects were prevented by MLA, demonstrating a critical role for the \u03b17-nAChR as a mediator of the effects of nicotine in the progression of CKD.", 
    "215": "We performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the pharmacological profile of ritobegron and its effects on the bladder in rats. \u03b2(3)-AR selectivity was assessed using CHO cells expressing various subtypes of the human \u03b2-adrenoceptor (AR). Effects on isolated organs were evaluated using the organ-bath method. Effects on intravesical pressure, heart rate, and mean blood pressure were evaluated in urethane-anesthetized rats. Ritobegron increased cAMP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner in CHO cells expressing any one of three human \u03b2-AR, its selectivity for \u03b2(3)-AR being 301-fold and 32-fold higher versus \u03b2(1)-AR and \u03b2(2)-AR, respectively. Ritobegron decreased the resting tension of the isolated bladder in a concentration-dependent manner (EC(50), 7.7 \u00d7 10(-8) mol/L; maximal relaxation, 97.0 %), and the \u03b2(3)-AR antagonist SR58894A produced a parallel rightward-shift of this concentration-response curve without altering the maximal response [pK(B) value, 6.43]. Ritobegron concentration-dependently increased atrial rate and decreased myometrial contractions in vitro, and its selectivity for the bladder was 2,078-fold higher versus the atria and 14-fold higher versus the uterus. In vivo, ritobegron induced a dose-dependent decrease in intravesical pressure (ED(50) 0.4 mg/kg), without affecting heart rate and only slightly lowering mean blood pressure. Thus, ritobegron displayed potent and selective \u03b2(3)-AR agonistic activity toward transfected human \u03b2-AR and exhibited a high selectivity for the bladder versus other organs in rats. Moreover, it decreased intravesical pressure with minimal effects on the cardiovascular system in anesthetized rats. These results suggest that ritobegron shows promise as a potential agent for the treatment of overactive bladder.",

    "217": "A decision analysis model was built. Surgical (NPDS) arm of the decision tree was observational (consecutive retrospective case series) and maximum medical treatment arm was hypothetical. Maximum medical therapy was considered a three-drug regimen (association of a fixed combination of timolol/dorzolamide [FCTD] and a prostaglandin analogue [bimatoprost, latanoprost or travoprost]). Cost-effectiveness ratio was defined as direct cost (US dollars) for each percentage of intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction. Horizon was 5 years and perspective is from the public health care service in Brazil (SUS). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated.",

NPDS demonstrated a better cost-effectiveness ratio, compared to maximum medical therapy. The ICER was negative for all medical treatment options; therefore NPDS was dominant.",

    "220": "The \u03b2-blocker propranolol, originally designed for cardiological indications (angina, cardiac arrhythmias and high blood pressure), is nowadays, considered the most efficient drug for the treatment in infantile haemangiomas (IH), a vascular tumour that affects 5-10% of all infants. However, its potential therapeutic benefits in other vascular anomalies remain to be explored. In the present work we have assessed the impact of propranolol in endothelial cell cultures to test if this drug could be used in the vascular disease hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This rare disease is the result of abnormal angiogenesis with epistaxis, mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal telangiectases, as well as arteriovenous malformations in several organs, as clinical manifestations. Mutations in Endoglin (ENG) and ACVLR1 (ALK1) genes, lead to HHT1 and HHT2, respectively. Endoglin and ALK1 are involved in the TGF-\u03b21 signalling pathway and play a critical role for the proper development of the blood vessels. As HHT is due to a deregulation of key angiogenic factors, inhibitors of angiogenesis have been used to normalise the nasal vasculature eliminating epistaxis derived from telangiectases. Thus, the antiangiogenic properties of propranolol were tested in endothelial cells. The drug was able to decrease cellular migration and tube formation, concomitantly with reduced RNA and protein levels of ENG and ALK1. Moreover, the drug showed apoptotic effects which could explain cell death in IH. Interestingly, propranolol showed some profibrinolytic activity, decreasing PAI-1 levels. These results suggest that local administration of propranolol in the nose mucosa to control epistaxis might be a potential therapeutic approach in HHT.", 
    "221": "We still do not know whether the successful treatment of the comorbid diseases associated with COPD, mainly cardiovascular disease, also positively influences the course of the lung disease because so far there are few definite data documenting that treatment of COPD comorbidities will reduce morbidity and mortality rates in these patients. Observational studies suggest that COPD patients treated with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, and \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockers may have improved survival and reduced hospitalisation from exacerbations. Progress in basic and translational research has led to a better understanding of pharmacological mechanisms that may explain the effects of these drugs on COPD and some small clinical trial activity is beginning to generate promising results.", 
    "222": "The use of blood spot collection cards was investigated as a means of obtaining small volume samples for the quantification of therapeutic drugs for assessing medication adherence. A liquid chromatography-high resolution TOF mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) method, based on the measurement at the accurate mass to charge ratio of the target analyte, was used to ensure specificity for atenolol in the dried blood spot (DBS) samples. A working method was developed and validated. For the preparation of DBS samples whole blood spiked with analyte was used to produce 30 \u03bcl blood spots on specimen collection cards. A 5mm disc was cut from the dried blood spot and extracted using methanol:water (60:40, v/v) containing the internal standard, atenolol-d(7). Extracts were vortexed, sonicated and then centrifuged. Gradient chromatographic elution was achieved using an Ascentis Express C18 100mm\u00d72.1mm column and a mobile phase flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and the column oven temperature at 30 \u00b0C. MS detection was carried out in electrospray positive ion mode for target ions at accurate mass m/z 267.1703 for atenolol and 274.2143 for the IS. Drug extraction efficiency from spiked blood spots was demonstrated to be 96\u00b15% and the drug was stable in DBS for at least 10 weeks. The developed LC-HRMS method was linear within the tested calibration range of 25-1500 ng/ml and validation showed the accuracy (relative error) and precision (coefficient of variation) values were within the pre-defined limits of \u2264 5% at all concentrations with a limit of quantification of 25 ng/ml. Factors with potential to affect drug quantification measurements such as the matrix effects, volume of blood applied onto the collection card and effect of different sampling cards were investigated. The developed LC-HRMS method was applied to blood spots on sampling card taken from adult healthy volunteers previously administered a 50mg atenolol tablet and a DBS concentration-time profile was obtained for atenolol. Requiring only a micro volume (30 \u03bcl) blood sample for analysis, the developed DBS based assay has the potential to assess patient adherence to atenolol.", 
    "223": "Accumulated amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) is a well-known cause of neuronal apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease and exerts its action partly by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. Previous studies have suggested a neuroprotective role for mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel openers against A\u03b2 damages, but the molecular details were unclear. Recent evidence indicates that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress also plays an important role in the process of cell apoptosis. It remains to be determined whether KATP channel openers mediate their potential neuroprotective role by inhibiting ER stress pathways. The mRNA and protein expression levels of caspase-12, an ER-specific caspase, were observed. Here we showed that in response to the treatment with A\u03b2\u2082\u2085\u208b\u2083\u2085 (10 \u03bcM) for 24 h the mRNA and protein expression levels of caspase-12 were significantly upregulated; however, this change could be partly reversed by pretreatment with diazoxide (1 mM) for 1 h. This effect was negated by 5-hydroxydecanoate, a selective mitochondrial KATP channel blocker. Our results indicate that the cytoprotective efficacy of diazoxide under A\u03b2\u2082\u2085\u208b\u2083\u2085-induced insults is mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of ER stress. Demonstration of the neuroprotective action of diazoxide provides additional insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of A\u03b2\u2082\u2085\u208b\u2083\u2085 toxicity and defines possible molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.", 
    "224": "MALDI-TOF MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry) imaging is used to characterize novel lipid implants allowing for controlled drug delivery. Importantly, this innovative technique provides crucial information on the inner structure of the implants before and after exposure to the release medium and does not require the addition of marker substances. Implants were prepared by extrusion at room temperature. Thus, in contrast to hot-melt extruded systems, the risks of drug inactivation and solid state transformations of the lipid matrix former are reduced. Hydrogenated/hardened soybean oil and glyceryl tristearate were studied as lipids and propranolol hydrochloride and theophylline as drugs, exhibiting significantly different solubility in water. The implants were also characterized by optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, water uptake and lipid erosion studies, mathematical modeling as well as in vitro drug release measurements. Importantly, broad spectra of drug release patterns with release periods ranging from a few days up to several months could easily be provided when varying the initial drug content and type of lipid, irrespective of the type of drug. The diameter of the implants can be as small as 1mm, facilitating injection. MALDI-TOF MS imaging revealed homogeneous macroscopic drug distributions within the systems, but steep drug concentration gradients in radial and axial direction at the lower micrometer level, indicating drug- and lipid-rich domains. As the implants do not significantly swell, local irritation upon administration due to mechanical stress can be expected to be limited. Good agreement between experimentally measured and theoretically calculated drug release kinetics revealed that diffusional mass transport plays a major role for the control of drug release from this type of advanced drug delivery systems.",
