Both cell types express the Ca(2+)-dependent alpha-PKC and the Ca(2+)-independent epsilon- and delta-PKC isoforms. The atypical zeta-PKC isoform is also expressed in neonatal, but only weakly in adult cells. Stimulation of the alpha 1-adrenergic or purinergic receptor with phenylephrine or ATP, respectively, increases membrane-associated immunoreactivity of both epsilon- and delta-PKC in neonatal and adult cells; endothelin and carbachol are also effective in adult cells. In contrast, none of the agonists leads to increases in membrane-associated alpha-PKC in cardiomyocytes. PKC zeta is also unaffected by receptor stimulation. The phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate causes redistribution and subsequently down-regulation of alpha-, epsilon-, and delta- but not zeta-PKC. The three isoforms are down-regulated at distinctively different rates, with alpha-PKC being the most rapid and epsilon-PKC the slowest. We used selective down-regulation of alpha-, epsilon-, and delta-PKC to investigate the role of these isoforms in PKC phosphorylation-dependent events in neonatal myocytes. Our findings suggest that epsilon-PKC is responsible for the phenylephrine-induced phosphorylation of MARCKS, an endogenous PKC-specific substrate. In contrast, agonist-induced c-fos expression is unlikely to be mediated by epsilon-PKC since the response is rapidly down-regulated and apparently Ca(2+)-dependent. Our finding that the PKC isoforms are differentially responsive to neurohormones suggests that they play distinct and specific roles in cardiac function.", 
    "1": "Although effective treatments for hyperthyroidism are available, none is perfect. Particularly with respect to Graves' disease, what is needed is a therapy directed at modulating the disease process itself rather than merely reducing the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones in the hope that the underlying Graves' disease will remit. Greater understanding of the pathogenesis of Graves' disease, resulting from cloning of the thyrotropin receptor and better knowledge of the interactions between these receptors or other thyroid antigens and the immune system, may lead to such treatment. Broad-spectrum immunosuppression, with all its side effects, is not the answer; more focused therapies to inhibit the immune response to specific thyroid antigens may represent the treatment of the future. Meanwhile, radioiodine therapy is the most effective and convenient method of achieving long-term control of hyperthyroidism, although at the cost of hypothyroidism in many patients.", 
    "2": "We compared the effects of pilocarpine 4% alone, timolol 0.5% alone, and a combination of timolol 0.5% and pilocarpine 4% in the treatment of glaucoma. We treated 43 patients with glaucoma using each drug and then with the combination of drugs for four weeks each. Only patients with a morning intraocular pressure of at least 24 mm Hg without treatment were included. The patients were examined, after one and four weeks of treatment with pilocarpine, timolol, or combined timolol 0.5% and pilocarpine 4%, before the morning dose and at two and five hours after it. At the end of the study, the mean reduction in intraocular pressure from baseline was 9.2 +/- 5.1 mm Hg (28.5% +/- 12.7%) with combined timolol 0.5% and pilocarpine 4%, 5.6 +/- 3.6 mm Hg (17.6% +/- 9.7%) with pilocarpine, and 7.5 +/- 5.0 mm Hg (21.2% +/- 12.6%) with timolol. Intraocular pressure was consistently lower with the combination treatment than with timolol or pilocarpine alone. We believe that this combined solution of timolol-pilocarpine is a valuable contribution to the treatment of open-angle glaucoma.", 
    "3": "A 2-year-old Collie-type dog with lethargy, tachycardia, tachypnea, and muscle tremors was examined 10 hours after the dog had bitten into an inhalation canister containing the beta 2-adrenergic agonist, terbutaline sulfate. Electrocardiographic findings (ventricular premature contractions and paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia) were consistent with excessive adrenergic activity resulting from terbutaline toxicosis. Serum terbutaline concentration was similar to that reported in human beings with terbutaline toxicosis. The dog did not respond to initial treatment with fluids and lidocaine administered IV, but rapid resolution of signs and conversion to normal sinus rhythm was achieved after IV infusion of propranolol.", 
    "4": "We studied long-term variability of QT-dispersion in three patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Maron III) and ventricular fibrillation. Late potentials were absent on signal-averaged electrocardiogram. ST-segment depression was recorded in all three patients at Holter monitoring, and in two during exercise stress testing, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was present in only one patient. The maximal correct QT-interval and corrected QT-dispersion (QTcd) were measured retrospectively, both off-drug and under treatment with amiodarone and beta-blocker (two patients), or sotalol alone (one patient). Ten age- and sex-matched normal subjects, and 13 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients without ventricular arrhythmias formed the control groups. QTcd-values in the control groups never exceeded 80 ms and mean values of 30.1 +/- 10.1 ms and 44.1 +/- 7.9 ms respectively, were found. During long-term follow-up, QTcd increased progressively in two of the three patients with ventricular fibrillation, and at the time of the event all showed a value > 100 ms. Sotalol, but not the amiodarone reduced QTcd. QTcd seems to be a powerful predictor of ventricular electrical instability in the absence of other specific markers, and a promising guide for effective pharmacological therapy.", 
    "5": "A significant concentration-dependent difference was found between beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs in their ability to inhibit A23187-induced isolated platelet aggregation. In the absence of extracellular calcium ions the following rank order of potency to inhibit calcium ionophore stimulated platelet aggregation was shown: propranolol > bevantolol > alprenolol > metipranolol > oxprenolol > atenolol > pindolol > metoprolol approximately sotalol approximately practolol. The interruption of induced aggregation, as well as inhibition of aggregation, in the absence of extracellular calcium ions indicated interference of inhibitory beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs with intramembrane or intraplatelet calcium pools activated with A23187. This suggestion was supported by the reversal of the inhibitory effect of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs in the presence of extracellular calcium ions. The effect was dose dependent and occurred within 30 sec after calcium administration. The results indicated that inhibitory beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, possessing a cationic amphiphilic structure, suppressed calcium mobilization in A23187-stimulated platelets, most probably after entering platelets. This explains why lipophilic drugs are more effective than hydrophilic ones in calcium ionophore A23187-stimulated platelets.", 
    "6": "The risk of infarction and sudden death is considerable in patients with silent ischemia, whether it occurs alone or is interspersed with episodes of angina. The ischemic activity can be modified or even abolished, most effectively with beta-blocker and nitrate therapy. But it is not yet clear whether treatment improves outcome, although the limited available data suggest that it does.", 
    "7": "A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study tested peak and trough efficacy of immediate-release nisoldipine (20 mg twice daily) added to existent beta-adrenergic blocking therapy. Patients were randomized with a history of chronic stable angina, while receiving a stable regimen of a beta-blocking agent, with exercise test-induced angina in association with 1 mm horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression and exercise test reproducibility of +/- 15%. Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (48-hour) was performed at 3 of 5 centers (44 patients). Efficacy was achieved in 53 patients (26 taking immediate-release nisoldipine/placebo in sequence and 27 taking placebo/immediate-release nisoldipine in sequence). Total exercise time increased compared with placebo at peak, but only a trend was seen at trough. Time to 1 mm ST-segment depression at peak and trough and ambulatory electrocardiographic parameters were also improved. Adverse effects were mild. This trial confirms that immediate-release nisoldipine when added to existent beta-blocker therapy is an active antianginal and anti-ischemic agent, but that the immediate-release formulation loses its antianginal effect at the end of its dosing interval (9 to 14 hours). This drug is therefore being examined in a new extended-release formulation (Coat-Core).", 
    "8": "Rats immersed in a modified version of the forced swim test in which they are unable to touch the bottom of the cylinder with their feet while keeping their noses above water, initially paddle vigorously but eventually become relatively immobile. In the present study, we show that chronic treatment with imipramine and alprazolam increases rather than decreases the immobility response of rats in this test, whereas chronic treatment with propranolol is less effective. The results of this study indicate that the interpretation of the immobility response as 'behavioral despair', which is based on the response to the antidepressant drugs such as imipramine, needs to be reevaluated.", 
    "9": "In rats kept at an ambient temperature of 22 degrees C, centrally and peripherally administered sauvagine induces a dose-dependent hypothermia. To clarify the regulatory mechanisms and to ascertain which neurotransmitter systems mediate sauvagine-induced hypothermia, we administered sauvagine intracerebroventricularly and subcutaneously in rats pretreated with antagonists of muscarinic receptors (atropine), opiate receptors (naloxone), alpha-adrenoceptors (phentolamine, yohimbine and prazosin), beta-adrenoceptors (propranolol) and dopamine receptors (haloperidol and spiperone). Systemic pretreatment of rats with atropine, naloxone, prazosin and propranolol left sauvagine-induced hypothermia unaltered. Pretreatment with phentolamine (4 mg/kg, s.c.), a non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, and yohimbine (3 mg/kg, s.c.), a selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, enhanced the hypothermic action of sauvagine. Pretreatment with haloperidol (2 mg/kg, s.c.), a non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist, and spiperone (80 micrograms/kg, s.c.), a selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, significantly reduced the temperature fall induced by centrally (4 micrograms/rat) and peripherally (20 micrograms/kg) administered sauvagine. Thus, sauvagine-induced hypothermia appears not to be mediated by interactions with cholinergic, endogenous opiate or noradrenergic systems, but rather D2 dopaminergic pathways alone are involved in the inhibitory effect of sauvagine on body temperature in the rat.", 
    "10": "The intracellular pH (pHi) indicator 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein and microfluorimetry were used to characterize several ion transport mechanisms in rat parotid striated ducts. The recovery of ductal pHi from an acute acid load was Na+ dependent and inhibited by the amiloride analogue ethylisopropylamiloride with 50% inhibitory concentration 4.7 +/- 0.8 microM, indicating the presence of a Na(+)-H+ exchanger of the amiloride-insensitive type. The rate of this recovery was stimulated approximately 20% in ducts pretreated with the muscarinic agonist carbachol (10(-5) M) and inhibited approximately 20% in ducts pretreated with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10(-6) M). Upon removal of extracellular K+, ductal pHi rapidly decreased (0.19 +/- 0.02 pH units/min), consistent with a coupling between K+ and H+ (or OH-) fluxes in this tissue. In HCO(3-)-containing medium, the acidification due to K+ removal was blunted, arguing against ductal K(+)-HCO3- cotransport. However, the effect of K+ removal was inhibited by the K+ channel blocker Ba2+ (1 mM) and by the H+ channel blocker Zn2+ (25 microM), consistent with the involvement of electrically coupled K+ and H+ channels. The effect of K+ removal was unaffected by pretreatment of ducts with isoproterenol (10(-6) M) but markedly inhibited (approximately 50%) by pretreatment with carbachol (10(-5) M). No evidence for a significant component of Cl(-)-HCO3- exchange was found in striated ducts. The properties of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger and K(+)-H+ exchange mechanism identified here are consistent with their involvement in ductal salt reabsorption and secretion.", 
    "11": "Acute bleeding from esophageal varices is a medical emergency. It requires a structured therapeutic strategy adapted to local resources. The primary goal is to stop bleeding, preferably by endoscopic sclerotherapy or ligation. If endoscopic intervention is not possible as a first-line treatment, balloon tamponade or vasoactive drugs (terlipressin or octreotid) are therapeutic options to be followed as soon as possible by sclerotherapy or ligation. After successful hemostasis, the next goal is to prevent rebleeding. This is achieved primarily by eradicating sclerotherapy or ligation. In special situations, long-term therapy with a non-cardioselective beta receptor blocker is an alternative. The combined approach using sclerotherapy or ligation plus beta receptor blocker offers no significant advantage. Primary prophylaxis of bleeding from esophageal varices by long-term beta receptor blocker therapy is advised in patients with medium-sized or large varices. Apart from strategies aimed at the therapy or prophylaxis of bleeding from esophageal varices, measures to prevent or treat chronic liver diseases should be implemented in order to reduce the development of liver cirrhosis as the leading cause of esophageal varices.", 
    "12": "A new beta-blocker, bisoprolol, was compared to atenolol for antihypertensive efficacy and ability to cause regression of left ventricular mass. Twenty-eight patients were randomized into this 8-week, double-blind, dose-escalating trial. Echocardiography was performed in 18 of these patients at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy to determine left ventricular (LV) mass indices. Both drugs caused a reduction in blood pressure, although bisoprolol caused a significantly greater reduction than did atenolol in diastolic pressure (p < 0.05) and a trend toward a greater reduction in systolic pressure (p < 0.096) as measured by cuff. Comparisons showed a significantly greater reduction in mean LV mass indices with bisoprolol than with atenolol (p < 0.05). A new beta-blocker, bisoprolol, was compared to atenolol for antihypertensive efficacy and ability to cause regression of left ventricular mass. Twenty-eight patients were randomized into this 8-week, double-blind, dose-escalating trial. Echocardiography was performed in 18 of these patients (bisoprolol treated = 8, atenolol treated = 10) at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy to determine left ventricular (LV) mass indices. Both drugs caused a reduction in blood pressure, although bisoprolol caused a significantly greater reduction than did atenolol in diastolic pressure (p < 0.05) and a trend toward a greater reduction in systolic pressure (p < 0.096) as measured by cuff (bisoprolol means: 152.6 plus minus 9.7/102.8 plus minus 2.8 to 134.0 plus minus 10.0/84.4 plus minus 5.6 mm Hg; atenolol means: 158.4 plus minus 13.8/101.4 plus minus 3.5 to 148.0 plus minus 21.4/91.4 plus minus 5.9 mm Hg). Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring results suggested bisoprolol had longer effectiveness at lowering systolic pressure than did atenol. Comparisons showed a significantly greater reduction in mean LV mass indices with bisoprolol (from 110.0 plus minus 212.3 to 101.8 plus minus 22.0 g m(minus sign2)) than with atenolol (116.9 plus minus 25.5 to 121.7 plus minus 22.2 g m(minus sign2)) (p < 0.05). Bisoprolol was safe and efficacious in blood pressure control and significantly better than atenolol in reducing LV mass.", 
    "13": "Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring was used as a measure of drug efficacy and criterion for inclusion of 29 patients with primary hypertension in a double-blind crossover comparison of the novel cardioselective beta-blocker nebivolol (2.5--10 mg) with lisinopril (10--40 mg) once daily. After 8 weeks of therapy, both regimens reduced clinic BP to a similar and significant extent. Similar and significant reductions in systolic and diastolic ABP in every one of the 24-h periods were observed with both treatments. Moreover, the percentages of \"BP loads\" were lowered similarly from 64% to 31% and 30% with nebivolol and lisinopril, respectively. Furthermore, a comparable trough:peak ratio of 70% was obtained with both therapies. These data demonstrate that both once daily nebivolol and lisinopril given as monotherapies in patients with ambulatory hypertension provide adequate and similar clinic and ambulatory BP control. In addition, our findings indicate that ABP monitoring may improve the clinical evaluation of new antihypertensive agents.", 
    "14": "Previous studies have reported the resting tremor (RT) of Parkinson's disease to occur at frequencies between 3-7 Hz and to be characterised by an alternating pattern of electromyographic (EMG) bursting activity between opposing muscles. A postural tremor (PT), of higher frequency (> 6 Hz) and with a synchronous pattern of EMG activity, has also been previously described in Parkinson's disease. We investigated the electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of both the RT and PT of 11 patients with Parkinson's disease and 10 patients with essential tremor in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of L-Dopa/benserazide and propranolol. Tremor amplitude and frequency were assessed via bidirectional accelerometry, and the pattern of activation of the antagonist muscles of the forearm was determined with use of surface EMG. In the Parkinson's disease group studied, the frequency, EMG pattern of bursts, and response to L-Dopa were similar for the two tremors (median improvement of RT by 70% and PT by 61%). Despite some overlap between the Parkinson's disease and essential tremor groups in the electrophysiology of the tremor, there was no such dramatic pharmacological response in the latter group. These results suggest that the RT and PT of Parkinson's disease share a common pathophysiology and are distinct from essential tremor.", 
    "15": "Felodipine, a vascular selective antihypertensive calcium antagonist, was compared with hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, with respect to glucose tolerance. An open crossover study was performed comprising 16 non-diabetic hypertensive women (age range 59-75 years). The women continued to take a beta-blocker as a basal therapy. Each treatment period lasted three months. The blood pressure was similar irrespective of treatment. Blood glucose values were not significantly different during the oral glucose tolerance test. Serum insulin levels after glucose administration were lower when the patients were treated with felodipine than when taking hydrochlorothiazide. A possible explanation for this observation may be an increased insulin release as a consequence of treatment with a diuretic in order to maintain normal blood glucose levels during the glucose tolerance test. Felodipine appears preferable to hydrochlorothiazide as an addition to a beta blocker in hypertensive patients from a glucose metabolism point of view.", 
    "16": "Recent clinical trials have suggested that therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in asymptomatic patients with reduced left ventricular (LV) function can significantly reduce the incidence of congestive heart failure compared with patients receiving placebo. In the present study, we examined the effects of long-term monotherapy with enalapril, metoprolol, and digoxin on the progression of LV systolic dysfunction and LV chamber enlargement in dogs with reduced LV ejection fraction (EF).", 
    "17": "LV dysfunction was produced in 28 dogs by multiple sequential intracoronary microembolizations. Embolizations were discontinued when LVEF was 30% to 40%. Three weeks after the last embolization, dogs were randomized to 3 months of oral therapy with enalapril (10 mg twice daily, n = 7), metoprolol (25 mg twice daily, n = 7), digoxin (0.25 mg once daily, n = 7), or no treatment (control, n = 7). As expected, in untreated dogs, LVEF decreased (36 +/- 1% versus 26 +/- 1%, P < .001) and LV end-systolic volume (ESV) and end-diastolic volume (EDV) increased during the 3-month follow-up period (39 +/- 4 versus 57 +/- 6 mL, P < .001, and 61 +/- 6 versus 78 +/- 8 mL, P < .002, respectively). In dogs treated with enalapril or metoprolol, LVEF remained unchanged or increased after therapy compared with before therapy (35 +/- 1% versus 38 +/- 3% and 35 +/- 1% versus 40 +/- 3%, respectively, P < .05), whereas ESV and EDV remained essentially unchanged. In dogs treated with digoxin, EF remained unchanged but ESV and EDV increased significantly.", 
    "18": "In dogs with reduced LVEF, long-term therapy with enalapril or metoprolol prevents the progression of LV systolic dysfunction and LV chamber dilation. Therapy with digoxin maintains LV systolic function but does not prevent progressive LV enlargement.", 
    "19": "Systemic and portal hemodynamic parameters were evaluated in eight cirrhotic patients in basal conditions and after food intake and placebo. Following seven days of oral propranolol administration, hemodynamic parameters were reevaluated in the fasting and postprandial states under similar conditions. Cardiac output and portal blood flow were measured by Doppler technique. Intraobserver variability of repeated measurements was less than 10%. Food intake caused a significant increase of portal blood flow (+28%, P < 0.05). No significant changes were observed in the other hemodynamic parameters studied. Propranolol at doses achieving effective beta blockade (84 +/- 14 mg/day) (mean +/- SD) reduced portal blood flow (-24%, P < 0.05). Food intake caused a significant increase in portal blood flow (+35%, P < 0.05) in propranolol treated patients. However, in absolute values, postprandial portal blood flow during propranolol treatment was significantly lower (986 +/- 402 ml/min) than that obtained after the initial food intake (1214 +/- 537 ml/min, P < 0.05). Placebo administration had no significant hemodynamic effects in either group. This study demonstrates that chronic propranolol administration could protect from portal hemodynamic changes following food intake. Doppler technique is a reliable technique to evaluate changes on portal and systemic hemodynamic parameters during a short period of time in patients with cirrhosis.", 
    "20": "The signal transduction pathways through which growth factors regulate vascular cell growth are not fully understood. Recent studies suggest that metabolites of the lipoxygenase pathway may be involved in vascular cell growth. We have measured the effect of the lipoxygenase pathway inhibitors nordihydroguiaretic acid (NDGA), 5,6-dehydroarachidonic acid, and baicalein on bovine capillary endothelial cell (EC) and aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) growth in the presence or the absence of growth factors. NDGA totally suppressed serum-stimulated EC and SMC growth as well as growth factor-stimulated proliferation over a 9-day time course. Removal of the inhibitor revealed that the inhibitory effect of NDGA was reversible and not due to cytotoxicity. The morphology of NDGA-treated EC was changed in a reversible manner from the characteristic polygonal to spindle shape. The 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor 5,6-dehydroarachidonic acid had no effect on vascular cell proliferation, but inhibition of 12-lipoxygenase with baicalein blocked both EC and SMC cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, in the presence and the absence of growth factors. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase pathway, had no effect on EC and SMC proliferation. Quinacrine and oleyloxyethylphosphorycholine inhibition of the phospholipase A2-catalyzed release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids blocked growth factor- and serum-stimulated proliferation of EC and SMC. These results suggested that arachidonic acid metabolites are critical intermediaries in the regulation of vascular cell growth.", 
    "21": "This study tested whether a new serotonin (5-HT1B) agonist, 3-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridyl)-5-propoxy-pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyridine (CP-93,129), could be used to study the potential role of 5-HT1B receptors in the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin, and renin. CP-93,129 has a high affinity for 5-HT1B receptors but low affinity for other 5-HT receptor subtypes. In addition, CP-93,129 does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of ACTH, prolactin, and renin is known to be increased after activation of 5-HT receptors. ICV injections of CP-93,129 (100 micrograms/kg) increased the plasma concentrations of ACTH, prolactin, and renin. CP-93,129 also increased blood pressure and reduced heart rate. To determine whether these effects of CP-93,129 are centrally mediated, we compared them with IP injection of the same dose of CP-93,129. IP-injected CP-93,129 did not alter blood pressure or heart rate and did not elevate plasma prolactin and renin concentrations. To determine whether 5-HT1B receptors mediate the central effects of CP-93,129, rats were pretreated with the 5-HT antagonists l-propranolol or metergoline prior to ICV injections of doses of CP-93,129 (0-100 micrograms/kg). The 5-HT1A/1B/2A/2C antagonist metergoline (0.5 mg/kg, IP) failed to inhibit the CP-93,129-induced elevation of ACTH, prolactin, or renin concentrations. In contrast, the 5-HT1A/1B/beta antagonist l-propranolol (20 micrograms/kg, ICV) inhibited the renin but not the ACTH or prolactin responses to ICV CP-93,129.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "22": "1. The influence of sodium chloride (NaCl)-enrichment of the diet (6% of the dry weight) and that of a novel sodium-reduced, potassium-, magnesium-, and L-lysine-enriched salt alternative on the cardiovascular effects of the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking drug, metoprolol, was studied in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. 2. Increased dietary sodium chloride intake produced a marked rise in blood pressure and induced left ventricular and renal hypertrophy. By contrast, the salt alternative did not increase blood pressure and caused remarkably less cardiac and renal hypertrophy than did sodium chloride. 3. Metoprolol treatment at a daily dose of 250 mg kg-1 lowered blood pressure and decreased left ventricular hypertrophy index during the control diet. Sodium chloride-enrichment blocked the antihypertensive effect of metoprolol, while a partial protective effect on left ventricular and renal hypertrophy persisted. In the presence of the salt alternative-enrichment both at the level of 6% and 10.5% (corresponding to a NaCl level of 6%), metoprolol was fully able to exert its beneficial cardiovascular and renal effects. 4. Both salt supplementations, irrespective of metoprolol treatment, induced a 3 to 4 fold increase in the urinary excretion of calcium. There was a linear correlation between the urinary excretions of sodium and calcium. The urinary excretion of magnesium rose by 90% and that of potassium by 110% in the salt alternative group. 6. Our findings suggest that replacement of common salt by a potassium-, and magnesium-enriched salt alternative in the diet produces beneficial cardiovascular effects and improves the antihypertensive efficacy of metoprolol in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. Increased intake of potassium and/or magnesium and L-lysine from the salt alternative is involved in the beneficial effects of the salt alternative. The NaCl-induced myocardial and renal hypertrophies appear to be partially mediated by Beta-adrenoceptor activation.", 
    "23": "Atrial fibrillation following coronary artery surgery is common, especially in elderly patients but despite numerous studies its pathophysiological basis is still incompletely understood. It is usually benign and self-limiting, but may be associated with haemodynamic compromise, prolonged hospitalization and embolic stroke. No risk factors (apart from age and preoperative beta-blocker withdrawal) have been shown to be associated with its occurrence. Conventional treatment is usually effective but no prophylactic regime has been identified. Until such a regime is found the incidence of atrial fibrillation following myocardial revascularization may only be reduced by continuing treatment in patients on beta-blockers in the preoperative period and re-establishing this therapy after surgery.", 
    "24": "The antioxidant activity of SB209995, a metabolite of carvedilol in human, was studied and compared with its parent compound, carvedilol. SB209995 or carvedilol inhibited iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation assessed as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance generated in brain homogenate with IC50s of 0.30 and 8.1 mumol/l, respectively. The oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by macrophages or that initiated by Cu2+ ions was inhibited by SB209995 with IC50s of 59 nmol/l and 1.7 mumol/l, respectively. Under the same conditions, the IC50s of carvedilol were 3.8 and 17.1 mumol/l, respectively. Furthermore, SB209995 protected cultured endothelial cells against hydroxyl radical (OH.) or superoxide (O2-)-mediated lipid peroxidation and cytotoxicity, assessed as lactate dehydrogenase release and cell death. The results indicate that SB209995 is a more potent antioxidant than carvedilol and may contribute to the therapeutic effects of carvedilol.", 
    "25": "Five cases of exercise induced pure vasodepressor syncope in patients without significant structural heart disease are reported. Hypotension and symptoms of syncope or pre-syncope were induced by treadmill exercise testing and in each case limited exercise performance. Evidence of inappropriate peripheral vasodilation, probably as a consequence of ventricular mechanoreceptor stimulation, was shown in all five patients. Head up tilt testing resulted in hypotension in four patients and isoprenaline infusion in the supine position resulted in hypotension in the fifth. These patients had a new condition of exercise induced neurally mediated (vasodepressor) syncope without appreciable structural cardiac abnormalities.", 
    "26": "We studied cardiovascular and catecholamine responses for 3 days in three groups of patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. The night before surgery and again 2 h before induction of anaesthesia, patients received the ACE inhibitor, ramipril, the beta 1 blocker, metoprolol, or placebo. In the actively treated groups, mean diastolic pressure was reduced during surgery and increases in heart rate and arterial pressure after surgical incision were attenuated. During operation, stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) were significantly higher in the ramipril group. In contrast, beta 1, adrenergic block caused no significant changes in SV or CO. The concentration of noradrenaline in plasma and urine indicated that ACE inhibition caused attenuated release of noradrenaline. The results support the concept that angiotensin II facilitates release of noradrenaline from sympathetic nerves and that ACE inhibition inhibits this release.", 
    "27": "The contribution of receptor-operated Ca2+ channels (ROCs), voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (VOCs), and intracellular Ca2+ release to contractions induced by a range of stimuli in the guinea pig isolated trachea has been evaluated. In the presence of physiological Ca2+ (1.3 x 10(-3) M), tissue pretreatment with ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) (4 x 10(-3) M for 5 min) markedly inhibited (> 90%) the contractile responses to a range of agonists. Therefore, under physiological Ca2+ concentration, Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores appeared to make little contribution to maximum contractions. Nifedipine (10(-7) M) or verapamil (10(-5) M) abolished KCl-induced contractions but produced variable inhibition of contractions induced by other agonists. The ROC (and VOC) blocker, SK&F 96365 (10(-5)-10(-4) M), inhibited both KCl-induced contractions and the nifedipine-insensitive component of contractions induced by acetylcholine (ACh), U46619, or leukotriene D4 [half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values 1.7-3.8 x 10(-5) M]. Ni2+, which has ROC- and VOC-blocking actions, also abolished nifedipine-insensitive contractions induced by ACh. When Ca2+ was replaced with Ba2+, the contraction induced by ACh was blocked by nifedipine. Also, under these conditions, ACh did not increase the KCl maximum contraction. These data are consistent with there being distinct ROC and VOC influx pathways in guinea pig trachea and with ROCs playing a significant role in smooth muscle contraction.", 
    "28": "The present study characterized the pharmacological mechanisms and regional selectivity of the regulation of serotonin (5-HT) release by 5-HT1A autoreceptors. 5-HT release was measured simultaneously in the striatum and ventral hippocampus by using in vivo microdialysis in rats maintained under chloral hydrate anesthesia. Systemic administration of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) produced complete reductions of 5-HT release. The effects of systemic 8-OH-DPAT on 5-HT release were blocked completely by systemic administration of the 5-HT/beta adrenergic receptor antagonist, (-)-propranolol, but not by the beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist betaxolol or the beta-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI-118,551. Local administration of 8-OH-DPAT into the striatum or hippocampus through the microdialysis probe did not alter 5-HT release. Local administration of 8-OH-DPAT into the dorsal raphe nucleus reduced 5-HT release in the striatum, but not in the hippocampus. Conversely, administration of 8-OH-DPAT into the median raphe nucleus reduced 5-HT release in the hippocampus, but not in the striatum. The effects of systemic 8-OH-DPAT on striatal 5-HT release were selectively blocked by concurrent administration of (-)-propranolol into the dorsal raphe nucleus, whereas effects of systemic 8-OH-DPAT on hippocampal 5-HT release were selectively blocked by concurrent administration of (-)-propranolol into the median raphe nucleus. The present study suggests that somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors regulate the release of 5-HT in a regionally dependent manner.", 
    "29": "The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions after 7 days of oral treatment with nisoldipine (10 mg twice daily) and propranolol (80 mg twice daily) were investigated in a partially randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of 12 healthy volunteers.", 
    "30": "At the end of each treatment period, pharmacokinetic parameters were measured, along with blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac function, systemic hemodynamics, plasma catecholamines, forearm blood flow, and apparent hepatic blood flow (estimated by the clearance of indocyanine green dye).", 
    "31": "After 7 days of treatment with nisoldipine and propranolol, neither drug altered the other's bioavailability or elimination parameters, and propranolol did not change the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of nisoldipine's metabolite, N-9425. Nisoldipine alone increased apparent hepatic blood flow and forearm blood flow compared with the other treatment groups but, with the addition of propranolol, both of these parameters were similar to those in the placebo group. Changes in the other hemodynamic parameters were consistent with the known effects of these drugs, and no differences in plasma catecholamine levels were detected.", 
    "32": "In contrast to the findings with single-dose treatment, administration of the combination of nisoldipine and propranolol for 7 days is not associated with any measurable kinetic interactions, although significant hemodynamic interactions do occur.", 
    "33": "Although it is well recognized that beta-blockers can induce bronchoconstriction only in patients with asthma, mechanisms of the bronchoconstriction are not well known. We hypothesize that bronchoconstriction induced by beta-blockers may result from inflammatory mediators released by allergic reactions. In this study, we developed a guinea pig model for propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction (PIB) after antigen inhalation and investigated the effect of specific thromboxane (TXA2) receptor antagonists, S-1452 and ONO NT-126, on PIB in passively sensitized and artificially ventilated guinea pigs to determine whether TXA2 is involved in PIB. Propranolol caused bronchoconstriction with 10 mg/ml of propranolol was inhaled 20 min after antigen challenge. On the other hand, propranolol did not produce bronchoconstriction after antigen provocation in nonsensitized guinea pigs or after saline provocation in sensitized animals. Pretreatment of the animals with S-1452 in doses of 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg and ONO NT-126 in doses of 1.0 and 10 micrograms/kg injected intravenously 15 min after antigen challenge as well as before antigen challenge reduced PIB in a dose-dependent manner. Bronchoconstriction caused by methacholine did not induce PIB. These results suggest that TXA2 has an important role in the pathophysiology of the PIB that develops after the allergic bronchoconstriction.", 
    "34": "Because of the different physiological impact that stereoisomers may have, it is often vital to separate these forms from one another. Because of their structural similarity, the separation is usually difficult to achieve and zones may elute very close to each other. This is a particular problem in capillary electrophoresis, where the repeatability of absolute migration times is fairly poor, mainly due to the irreproducibility of the electroosmotic flow. The separation is usually repeatable, however, and when the disturbing effects are eliminated by using a migration index system incorporating two marker compounds the identification of the enantiomers becomes extremely good. Relative standard deviation (RSD) values less than 0.1% for the migration index of each enantiomer were obtained in both intra-day and day-to-day (6 days) studies. The best separation was achieved with the electrolyte solution made of 40 mM borate, 32 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 12 mM beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), and 6 mM alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD) at pH 9.3.", 
    "35": "1. When carteolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, was administered to KK-Ay/Ta Jc1 mice that are obese and develop spontaneously non-insulin dependent diabetes, their increase in bodyweight was arrested from the age of 16 weeks. Since their intake of food and water was not influenced by carteolol treatment, compared with the control KK-Ay/Ta Jc1 mice, abolition of the weight gain might be attributed to increased energy metabolism. 2. Non-fasting serum glucose levels in carteolol-treated mice at the age of 17 weeks were within normal range (118 +/- 4 vs 186 +/- 12 mg/dL). An intraperitoneal glucose-tolerance test revealed that the carteolol treatment markedly restored glucose metabolism; fasting plasma glucose (88 +/- 6 mg/dL) was within normal range, and immunoreactive insulin (IRI; 5.8 +/- 0.8 vs 33.3 +/- 10.5 ng/mL) and plasma glucose levels at 60 min post glucose (361 +/- 44 vs 541 +/- 32 mg/dL) were significantly lower in carteolol-treated mice than those in the control group at the age of 20 weeks. 3. From these findings, carteolol is considered to have little effect on the growth of mice but to correct the obesity that develops after age 16 weeks, when their growth terminates. In addition, the normalization of blood glucose and marked decrease in IRI levels suggests that carteolol improves glucose tolerance by increasing the insulin sensitivity. 4. Since brown adipose tissue (BAT) is closely associated with thermogenesis and energy consumption, we tested whether carteolol may affect BAT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "Non-parturient sheep, hormonally primed and presented with newborn lambs are, at best, indifferent to them and if approached by the lamb may show violent rejection. However, non-gestant ewes primed with oestrogen and progesterone, but given vaginocervical stimulation, do show a rapid onset in maternal behaviour. This stimulation is ineffective in promoting maternal behaviour with epidural anaesthesia. Vaginocervical stimulation increases the release of oxytocin into cerebrospinal fluid and in-vivo microdialysis has revealed high levels of oxytocin release in limbic brain areas known to be important for maternal behaviour. Oxytocin, when given intraventricularly, produces the full complement of acceptance and suckling behaviour in non-gestant ewes. Although ineffective when given alone, opioids potentiate the release of oxytocin in the limbic brain and increase the intensity of maternal responding, while the opioid receptor blocker, naltrexone, prevents both maternal induction and oxytocin release. This neural basis for maternally motivated behaviour may be equally relevant to human behaviour, although the mechanisms available for addressing these peptidergic systems have clear differences.", 
    "37": "In a controlled clinical trial on histamine release in anaesthesia, it was suspected that the antihypertensive fixed-dose combination drug Betathiazid masked clinical signs of histamine release. By structure analysis of its constituents (propranolol, triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide), hydrochlorothiazide was considered to be most likely an H1-antagonist. An aqueous solution of the whole drug tablet (2 x 10(-4) M propranolol, 2.9 x 10(-5) M triamterene, 1.7 x 10(-5) M hydrochlorothiazide) and of the individual substances (1 microM each) was tested in the classical H1-receptor assay using the guinea pig ileum. Betathiazid in total suppressed the contraction to histamine (78% inhibition), but not to carbachol. Propranolol and triamterene had depressive effects (14% and 38% inhibition), but hydrochlorothiazide potentiated the contractions to histamine (75% potentiation). In all cases, the type of antagonism was not competitive. Although different mechanisms may account for the modulatory effects of Betathiazid, they have to be considered in the interpretation of clinical studies, especially for relating mediator concentrations with clinical signs.", 
    "38": "The antispasmogenic and spasmolytic effects of the calcium entry blocker verapamil were examined on histamine-induced guinea pig tracheal contraction in vitro in comparison with the beta 2-adrenergic agonist salbutamol. The effects of verapamil were found to be about 1000 times weaker than those of salbutamol. The antispasmogenic IC50 for verapamil was 1.99 x 10(-4) M compared to 7.94 x 10(-8) M for salbutamol. The spasmolytic EC50 for verapamil was 3.37 x 10(-5) M and for salbutamol was 1.95 x 10(-8) M. The combined application of verapamil and salbutamol resulted in additive antispasmogenic and spasmolytic effects.", 
    "39": "The prophylactic effect of tolfenamic acid and propranolol was studied in a randomized double-blind cross-over trial of 76 patients with migraine with or without aura. After a 4-week run-in period patients were randomly allocated to treatment with either tolfenamic acid 100 mg three times daily or propranolol 40 mg three times daily for 12 weeks. After a placebo wash-out period of 4 weeks the patients got the alternative drug for 12 weeks; 56 patients completed the study. Both drugs significantly reduced migraine attacks as judged from the reduction in the efficacy parameters (migraine hours, migraine days, and migraine intensity) in the treatment periods compared with the run-in period. No statistical significant difference in any efficacy parameter was found between the two drugs (level 2 alpha = 0.05, alpha = 0.10). The adverse effects showed no statistical difference in frequency between the 2 treatments. Twenty patients discontinued the study: 12 patients on propranolol and 8 patients on tolfenamic acid. Side effects were the cause of premature discontinuation of study medicine in 9 patients during propranolol treatment (dizziness, fatigue, and fall in blood pressure) and in 5 patients during tolfenamic acid treatment (gastrointestinal symptoms).",

No isotope effects were observed following simultaneous oral administration of tertatolol and [2H9]tertatolol. 3. After intravenous administration of the pseudoracemate or of each enantiomer separately, (+)-tertatolol showed a lower total clearance and volume of distribution, compared to the (-) enantiomer. 4. After oral administration of the pseudoracemate or of each enantiomer separately, no substantial difference in bioavailability were observed between the enantiomers.", 
    "41": "The aim of this study was to characterize the acute effect of euglycemic (glucose 5.2 +/- 0.6 mmol/l) hyperinsulinemia (mean 118 +/- 32 mU/l) on fibrinolytic variables, free fatty acids (FFA) and counterregulatory hormones. In addition, the effect of chronic treatment with metformin, an oral antidiabetic agent which enhances insulin action, and metoprolol CR, a relatively beta 1-selective adrenergic antagonist, was also evaluated. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study including 18 non-obese men, aged 53 +/- 6 years, was performed. The investigations were performed after each treatment period of 6 weeks in both the postabsorptive state and during a euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp. Compared to the postabsorptive state, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) activity and antigen, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen and FFA decreased (p < 0.001) after 120 min of euglycemic hyperinsulinemia. In addition, t-PA activity increased (p < 0.01) while blood levels of lipoprotein (a), catecholamines and cortisol remained unchanged. Growth hormone increased during the clamps and this was most pronounced after treatment with metoprolol CR. When the effect of treatment was compared, postabsorptive levels of C-peptide, FFA and t-PA antigen were lower after metformin than after the placebo period (p < 0.05). t-PA antigen also remained lower during the clamp after metformin treatment. No significant effects of metformin or metoprolol CR were seen on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake during the clamps or on postabsorptive levels of counterregulatory hormones, PAI-1 or Lp(a).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "42": "The aim of the study was to further explore the prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor-mediated control mechanism of noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerves in response to preganglionic nerve stimulation (PNS) and local nerve stimulation of the portal vein, respectively, in the pithed rat. Baseline values as well as the increments of mean arterial blood pressure (delta-BP), heart rate (delta-HR) and plasma noradrenaline levels (delta-NA) in response to four PNS episodes (0.8 Hz, 3 ms, 75 V for 45 s at 20 min intervals), respectively, were evaluated. Fenoterol administration (0.25 mg/kg, i.v.) reduced significantly the basal blood pressure but did not alter delta-BP in response to PNS. Basal heart rate markedly increased after fenoterol without any further change in heart rate induced by PNS. The beta 1-selective antagonist CGP 20712A attenuated delta-BP in response to PNS and prevented the fenoterol-induced increase in basal heart rate. The beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 per se did not change the blood pressure and heart rate values, but antagonized the fenoterol-induced decrease in basal blood pressure. Fenoterol enhanced plasma delta-NA in response to PNS by 105% in comparison to the corresponding control value. This effect of fenoterol could be blocked by pretreatment with ICI 118,551 but not with CGP 20712A (a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist) which per se did not significantly change plasma delta-NA. Repeated local stimulation of the portal vein (S1-S3, 2 Hz, 3 ms, 10 mA, for 120 s at 30 min intervals) increased portal plasma noradrenaline without changing mean blood pressure and heart rate in pithed rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "The effects of garlic (Allium sativum L., Liliaceae) dialysate were studied on arrhythmias induced in anaesthetized dogs and on isolated left rat atria. Garlic dialysate suppressed premature ventricular contractions (PVC) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) in ouabain-intoxicated dogs as well as the ectopic rhythms induced by isoprenaline (10(-6) M) and aconitine (10(-8) M) on electrically driven left rat atria. The effective refractory period (ERP) and the sinus node recovery time (SNRT) of isolated rat atria were prolonged in a dose-dependent manner by the administration of this extract. Garlic dialysate decreased the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of isoprenaline in a concentration-dependent manner. These last effects were increased by propranolol. The results suggest that garlic dialysate has a significant antiarrhythmic effect in both ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "44": "Adrenergic regulation of prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis was investigated in 1-14C-arachidonic acid-prelabeled cultured rabbit gastric epithelial cells (RGECs). RGECs expressed adrenergic alpha 1- and beta-receptors and muscarinic receptors. Norepinephrine facilitated the synthesis of PGs I2 (determined as the stable metabolite 6-keto PGF1 alpha) and E2 and hydroxyfatty acids, while epinephrine facilitated the synthesis of PGI2 and hydroxyfatty acids, but not PGE2. However, isoproterenol did not affect PG biosynthesis. The effects of norepinephrine and epinephrine on PG biosynthesis were markedly suppressed by the non-selective alpha-blocker phentolamine and/or the selective alpha 1-blocker prazosin. In combination with epinephrine, the selective alpha 2-blocker yohimbine or the beta-blocker propranolol facilitated PGE2 synthesis. Acetylcholine did not affect PG biosynthesis. These results indicate that norepinephrine and epinephrine act on PG biosynthesis as adrenergic agonists in these cultured RGECs and that an alpha 1-receptor couples PGI2 and PGE2 synthesis.",

Isoprenaline was infused intra-arterially to stimulate beta-adrenoceptors, terbutaline to stimulate beta 2-adrenoceptors, propranolol to block beta-adrenoceptors, metoprolol to block beta 1-adrenoceptors, isoprenaline combined with metoprolol to stimulate beta 2-adrenoceptors, epinephrine to stimulate alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, yohimbine to block alpha 2-adrenoceptors and sodium nitroprusside to increase forearm blood flow directly.", 
    "47": "No systemic hemodynamic effects or changes in arterial plasma norepinephrine level were noted during the intra-arterial infusions. Metoprolol and propranolol decreased norepinephrine spillover and its rate of appearance in the forearm without affecting forearm blood flow. Isoprenaline and sodium nitroprusside increased and epinephrine decreased forearm norepinephrine spillover. Terbutaline increased forearm norepinephrine spillover and its rate of appearance in the forearm. Terbutaline increased the forearm rate of appearance and spillover of norepinephrine more than did sodium nitroprusside or isoprenaline at the same level of forearm blood flow. Infusion of isoprenaline failed to increase norepinephrine spillover or its forearm appearance rate more than would be expected from the increase in forearm blood flow. Administration of epinephrine increased spillover and forearm appearance rate of norepinephrine during intra-arterial infusion of yohimbine.",

    "49": "To evaluate the effects of multiple beta-adrenergic stimulations on pulmonary surfactant phospholipids, perfused lungs from beta-adrenergic primed and non-primed rats were challenged with the beta-agonist terbutaline in vitro. Cell-free lung lavage, lavagable alveolar cells and lung tissue were analysed for phospholipid content and incorporation of precursors. In lung lavage, terbutaline in vitro doubled the incorporation of 14C-choline and 3H-palmitate into total phosphatidylcholine (PC) and of 3H-palmitate into phosphatidylglycerol (PG). beta-adrenergic priming in vivo prior to terbutaline in vitro lowered the increase of precursor incorporation. For lavagable cells, terbutaline in vitro increased the incorporation of 3H-palmitate into PC. Priming in vivo reduced this effect and diminished the specific 3H-choline incorporation into lavagable cell PC below control level. For lung tissue, priming increased the amounts of PC and disaturated PC (DSPC) whereas terbutaline in vitro decreased DSPC in both primed and non-primed lungs. Terbutaline in vitro slightly increased the incorporation of 14C-choline and 3H-palmitate into PC and DSPC in non-primed but not in primed lungs. beta-adrenergic blockade by ICI 118.551 prevented all effects but generally increased 3H-palmitate incorporation into the phospholipids and, in lavagable cells, the amount of PC. We conclude that long-term beta-adrenergic treatment may alter the metabolism of pulmonary surfactant phospholipids by increasing tissue PC and DSPC and by decreasing the secretion of newly-synthesized PC.", 
    "50": "In heart failure, both the sympathetic nervous system and the renin angiotensin system play important pathophysiological roles, and the two systems may interact with each other, e.g., angiotensin II facilitating noradrenaline release. An abnormality in beta-adrenoceptor density (i.e., a decrease) occurs in clinical and pacing-induced heart failure. This observation together with the therapeutic effectiveness of converting-enzyme inhibitors in the management of patients with heart failure led to the current investigation. The aim was to explore the impact of chronic enalapril treatment on the status of myocardial beta-adrenoceptors in dogs paced (250 beats.min-1) to end-stage heart failure. Placebo or enalapril treatment (5 mg b.i.d.) commenced 1 week after the onset of ventricular pacing and continued until end-stage heart failure was reached. Myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density and affinity were assessed by radioligand binding with [125I]iodocyanopindolol. Left ventricular angiotensin II formation and noradrenaline concentration were measured. In addition, plasma renin activity and plasma noradrenaline levels were determined. The results showed that there was a significant increase in beta-adrenoceptor density following enalapril treatment compared with placebo in the heart-failure group. Enalapril did not change the beta-adrenoceptor density in the control animals. However, in both heart failure and control animals, enalapril caused an unexpected increase in Kd. Furthermore, in heart failure, enalapril caused a significant increase in myocardial angiotensin II formation. We conclude that enalapril prevents or reverses the myocardial beta-adrenoceptor abnormality seen in heart failure and promotes angiotensin II formation.", 
    "51": "Recent studies have shown that bradykinin decreases the incidence of ischaemic arrhythmias in dogs and may also mediate the antiarrhythmic effects of preconditioning in this species. We investigated the effects of exogenously administered bradykinin on the severity of ischemic arrhythmias and the role of endogenously released bradykinin, acting on B2-receptors, in preconditioning in anaesthetized rats.",

In protocol 2, rats were pretreated with the B2-receptor antagonist HOE 140 (40 and 400 micrograms/kg intravenous bolus) 10 min before coronary artery occlusion. In protocol 3, rats were preconditioned by a 3 min coronary occlusion followed by 10 min of reperfusion before a sustained 30 min occlusion. Saline or HOE 140 was given 10 min before the preconditioning protocol. In all groups, the number and severity of ventricular arrhythmias were determined during the 30 min coronary occlusion.",

The two higher doses of bradykinin (1 and 10 micrograms kg/min) caused a reduction in blood pressure soon after infusion began, although this was not maintained for the duration of the experiment. In protocol 2, HOE 140, in doses that produced a sustained antagonism to the depressor response to bradykinin, had no effect on either arrhythmia count or the incidence of ventricular fibrillation in rats subjected to a single 30 min coronary occlusion. In protocol 3, a 3 min preconditioning occlusion in saline-treated rats reduced arrhythmia counts from 1046 +/- 196 in non-preconditioned rats to 76 +/- 44 in preconditioned rats, and reduced the incidences of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation from 100 to 50% and from 75 to 7%, respectively. Neither dose of HOE 140 tested reversed these antiarrhythmic effects of preconditioning.", 
    "54": "These results suggest that bradykinin is not protective against ischaemic arrhythmias in rats in vivo, whether given exogenously or released endogenously.

    "55": "The oxidative metabolism of bunitrolol, an adrenergic beta-receptor antagonist was examined in human liver microsomes fortified with an NADPH-generating system. The microsomal fractions (n = 11) showed bunitrolol 4-hydroxylase activities, which correlated well with CYP2D6 contents (correlation coefficient, r = 0.854), debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase (r = 0.953) and imipramine 2-hydroxylase (r = 0.976) activities. On the other hand, the bunitrolol 4-hydroxylase activity showed relatively poor correlations with CYP3A4 content (r = 0.552) and testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylase activity (r = 0.668). The bunitrolol 4-hydroxylase activity was significantly inhibited by quinidine, a selective inhibitor for CYP2D6. Polyclonal antibodies raised against rat liver microsomal cytochrome P450BTL, which is thought to belong to the CYP2D subfamily, effectively inhibited bunitrolol 4-hydroxylation. In contrast, polyclonal antibodies raised against human liver microsomal CYP3A4 did not show any inhibitory effect on the activity. These results suggest that CYP2D6 is involved in the bunitrolol 4-hydroxylase activity in human liver microsomes.", 
    "56": "We evaluated several potential endogenous mediators of post norepinephrine induced hyperemia in the mesenteric circulation. Hyperemia was elicited in the anesthetized rat anterior mesenteric artery after cessation of intravenous norepinephrine infusion at 0.125 to 1.0 x 10(-8) M/min x 4 min. Arterial blood pressure was measured with a transducer, and the velocity of arterial blood flow was determined with pulsed Doppler velocimetry. Conductance at the height of mesenteric hyperemia, the post norepinephrine hyperemia volume, and the autoregulatory escape volume were calculated from recorded measurements. The higher doses of norepinephrine increased both the hyperemia volume and peak conductance in both control and capsaicin pretreated rats. Hyperemic parameters were significantly diminished by pretreatment with either yohimbine, propranolol, adenosine deaminase, or methylene blue. Combining adenosine deaminase with propranolol further reduced peak conductance and the hyperemia volume compared with enzyme pretreatment alone. The magnitude of hyperemia was related to the escape volume but not to the extent of norepinephrine induced vasoconstriction. We conclude that post norepinephrine induced hyperemia in the rat mesenteric circulation is modulated by alpha 2 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor activation, adenosine release, and endothelial factors.",

Fifty-three patients (28 men and 25 women) with mild-to-moderate hypertension, aged 20-64 years, were studied. After a 1-month placebo run-in period, patients were randomly assigned to receive either nifedipine (40 mg daily) or celiprolol (200 mg daily), each time using a double-dummy technique. After 6 weeks, dosages of each drug could be doubled. After 6 weeks, there were no differences in plasma lipids between the two treatment groups. However, the changes after 12 weeks of treatment were different (p < 0.05) between the groups, leading to lower levels of plasma esterified cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and apoprotein AI, AII, and B in the celiprolol group. Plasma lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activity (LCAT) was not modified. The present study showed that celiprolol was at least equivalent to nifedipine in terms of secondary effects on plasma lipids and lipoprotein.",

Thirty minutes after occlusion, blood flow to the three layers of the area at risk rose to 2-3 times control values in both groups; a significant increase above control values also occurred in the circumflex territory. After 90 minutes reperfusion, blood flow to both territories was similar in both groups but was comparable to the control; however, in necrotic tissue of the subendocardial layer of both groups, flow fell below control values (p < 0.05). End-systolic volume rose from 21.2 +/- 7.4 ml to 36.1 +/- 11.5 ml (p < 0.05), end-diastolic volume remained constant (46.0 +/- 13.8 vs. 47.9 +/- 12.1 ml; p > 0.05), and ejection fraction fell from 53.9 +/- 8.3% to 25.8 +/- 10.2% (p < 0.05) at the end of the experiment in the metoprolol group.

Fractional shortening of the chords analyzed was similar in both groups during the control period; it fell significantly at the end of the experiment in three chords of the metoprolol group and in five chords of the placebo group. The apical chord in the placebo, but not in the metoprolol, dogs was dyskinetic: fractional shortening was -0.86 +/- 9.7 versus 7.5 +/- 13.5% (p > 0.05). The area at risk was 41.6 +/- 10.6 cm2 in metoprolol- and 40.5 +/- 7.2 cm2 in placebo-treated dogs (p > 0.05); the infarct size, expressed as a percentage of the area at risk, was 29.0 +/- 22.5% and 45.3 +/- 23.6% (p = 0.02), respectively.",

    "62": "The present study examined the effects of morphine, DAMGO, DPDPE and U-50, 488H on auricular rate on isolated right atria of the rat. All the opioid agonists tested induced a decrease of auricular rate. The maximal effect obtained with U-50,488H (75 +/- 8.3%) was significantly (p < 0.001) higher than that obtained with morphine (12 +/- 2.7%), DAMGO (8 +/- 0.6%) or DPDPE (11 +/- 1.8%). The inhibitory effects of U-50,488H were not antagonized by the presence of naloxone (10(-7) or 5 x 10(-7) M) or MR-2266 (10(-7) or 5 x 10 (-7) M). Moreover, U-50,488H did not change the auricular chronotropism in the presence of atropine (5 x 10(-7) M). In this case the maximal inhibitory effect was 79 +/- 6.7%, similar to that obtained with the kappa-agonist alone (75 +/- 8.3%). Propranolol (10(-8) or 5 x 10(-8) M) modified the inhibitory effect of U-50,488H. The maximal effect obtained by the kappa-agonist in presence of propranolol was 100 +/- 0 significantly (p < 0.01) higher than that obtained with U-50,488H alone. These results demonstrated that the depressant action of U-50,488H was not blocked in the presence of opioid receptor antagonists and probably does not involve opioid receptors. Furthermore, propranolol caused a dose-dependent potentiation of the effects of the kappa-agonist supporting the conclusion that it is not mediated by opioid receptors.", 
    "63": "Carbachol was injected into the hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of conscious, unrestrained Long Evans rats, chronically instrumented with intravascular catheters and pulsed Doppler probes to assess changes in regional haemodynamics. Bilateral microinjections of carbachol (1 ng-1 microgram) produced increases in blood pressure, bradycardias and vasoconstrictions in renal, superior mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds. In the presence of phentolamine, the bradycardic and hindquarters vasoconstrictor responses to carbachol were unchanged while the pressor response was smaller due to a reduction in the renal and the superior mesenteric vasoconstriction. In the presence of propranolol, the bradycardic response was reduced, but the pressor and renal vasoconstrictor responses were potentiated, whereas the superior mesenteric and hindquarter vasoconstrictions were not changed significantly. In the presence of phentolamine and propranolol, the heart rate and pressor responses, as well as the renal vasoconstriction, were unchanged, whereas the superior mesenteric vasoconstriction was reduced and the hindquarters vasoconstriction was potentiated. Together these results are consistent with an involvement of the sympathoadrenal system in the pressor response to carbachol injected into the PVN of untreated animals. They indicate that alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction in the superior mesenteric vascular bed is a particularly important component in that regard. In the presence of the vasopressin antagonist, d(CH2)5(Tyr(Et))DAVP, alone or in combination with phentolamine and propranolol, the pressor response to carbachol was substantially reduced, while the renal and superior mesenteric vasoconstrictor effects were completely abolished; the bradycardia was not significantly affected by this treatment. These results indicate an important involvement of vasopressin in the cardiovascular responses to carbachol injected into the PVN of untreated animals. Moreover, in the presence of the vasopressin antagonist the hindquarters vascular bed showed a vasodilatation following PVN injection of carbachol; this effect was reversed to a vasoconstriction following combined i.v. pretreatment with the vasopressin antagonist, phentolamine and propranolol and hence was possibly due to circulating adrenaline acting on vasodilator beta 2-adrenoceptors. However, there was a residual hindquarters vasoconstriction raising the possibility that non-adrenergic, non-vasopressinergic vasoconstrictor mechanisms were influencing that vascular bed.", 
    "64": "The in vitro adsorption of metoprolol, pindolol, salbutamol, furosemide and clonidine onto activated charcoal was determined. The affinity of the drugs for charcoal decreased with increasing hydrophilicity. Also the rate of adsorption of clonidine onto four charcoal preparations having different particle sizes was studied. The equilibrium was reached rapidly with the charcoal having the smallest particle size, and the adsorption rate decreased as the particle size of the charcoal increased. The desorption of drugs from charcoal was investigated in the Sartorius dissolution apparatus at constant initial drug:charcoal ratio. The desorption had a two-step kinetics. The quantity of the initial rapid release, indicating the development of equilibrium, agreed with the adsorption data determined under the same conditions, except for salbutamol and furosemide at pH 7. The same was true for the Langmuir isotherms determined for adsorption and desorption. The following release step was slow and there were only minor differences between the release rates of the different drugs. The desorption rate (time to reach equilibrium) from the different charcoals was studied using a batch technique. An increase in the particle size of charcoal had, however, only limited sustaining effect on desorption. Although the affinity of the drugs for charcoal was in good agreement with their hydrophobicity, their desorption behavior was not necessarily proportional to their hydrophilicity. The in vitro release of the drugs from charcoal was retarded and was not significantly affected by the charcoal particle size.", 
    "65": "The effect of repetitive oral administration of propranolol (100 mg kg-1 day-1, 5 days) on the kinetics of liver microsomal propranolol metabolism was investigated in the rat. Vmax values of the high-affinity phase for biphasic kinetics of propranolol 4- and 5-hydroxylase activities were decreased by propranolol pretreatment, while those of the low-affinity phase were unchanged. The Vmax value of monophasic 7-hydroxylase activity was also decreased. On the other hand, the Vmax value of N-desisopropylase activity in the propranolol-treated rats was increased more than 2-fold compared with non-treated (control) rats, resulting in a change from monophasic in control rats to biphasic kinetics in propranolol-treated rats. These findings indicate that repetitive administration of propranolol selectively impairs a CYP2D isozyme that is involved in the high-affinity phases for propranolol ring-hydroxylations.", 
    "66": "The effect of topically active 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CyD) eye-drop formulations containing solutions of acetazolamide, ethoxyzolamide or timolol on the intra-ocular pressure (IOP) was investigated in normotensive conscious rabbits. Both acetazolamide and ethoxyzolamide were active but their IOP-lowering effect was less than that of timolol. The IOP-lowering effects of acetazolamide and ethoxyzolamide and that of timolol appeared to be to some extent additive. Combination of acetazolamide and timolol or ethoxyzolamide and timolol in one HP-beta-CyD formulation resulted in a significant increase in the duration of activity compared with HP-beta-CyD formulations containing only acetazolamide, ethoxyzolamide or timolol. Also, it was possible to increase the IOP-lowering effect of acetazolamide by formulating the drug as a suspension in an aqueous HP-beta-CyD vehicle.", 
    "67": "1. Optimal parameters for electrical field stimulation (EFS) of catfish pyloric and middle intestinal segments were determined (15 Hz, 60 V) from a range of frequencies (5-45 Hz) and voltages (40-120 V) using a modified Magnus' method. Contractile responses were produced by EFS which were reproducible and showed no significant difference between the tissues. 2. The contractile cholinergic responses of the tissues to carbachol and acetylcholine (ACh) were blocked by atropine on an equimolar concentration, whereas, these responses were enhanced in the presence of neostigmine, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. 3. Adrenergic responses were examined with noradrenaline (NA). NA produced contraction of the segments only, at a concentration of 10(-4) M. Among the various adrenoceptors, beta-adrenoceptor stimulation produced a weak relaxation whereas, both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation produced contractions, of which alpha 2-induced contraction was of greater magnitude. The beta, alpha 1 and alpha 2 responses were blocked by their respective blocking agents propranolol, prazosin and yohimbine. 4. The autonomic components of the response to EFS were determined by using selected cholinergic and adrenergic antagonists separately or collectively. Cholinergic blockade with atropine did not produce a significant blockade of the EFS-induced response. Similarly, blockade of beta-adrenoceptors with propranolol did not modulate the contractile response to EFS to any significant level. Blockade by prazosin or yohimbine did not significantly change the contractile response to EFS. After a complete blockade of the adrenergic and cholinergic divisions, the intestinal segments still showed a contractile response to EFS which was not significantly different from the control response. This indicated the presence of a non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) response. 5. Tetrodotoxin, at 10(-6) M, significantly blocked the EFS-induced NANC response suggesting a neurogenic origin for the response. 6. The present study indicated that the EFS-induced response of the catfish intestinal segments is predominantly NANC-e in nature suggesting an important role for it in the regulation of intestinal motility.", 
    "68": "1. To clarify possible regional and muscle layer differences in adrenergic innervation of swine myometrium, functional, biochemical and histochemical experiments were performed on longitudinal (LM) and circular (CM) muscle isolated from non-pregnant uteri of 84 gilts. 2. Transmural stimulation (TMS) in the presence of propranolol evoked tetrodotoxin-sensitive contractions in a frequency-dependent manner (2-20 Hz) in LM and CM. The cornual LM contractions were attenuated by phentolamine (1 microM) and by guanethidine (10 microM) though unaffected by atropine (1 microM). Contractions in cervical LM were diminished by atropine but not by phentolamine, and the corpus LM contractions were reduced incrementally by atropine and phentolamine when added sequentially. In CM, the TMS-induced contractions were abolished by tetrodotoxin and atropine in all three regions. 3. In response to noradrenaline (NA) and acetylcholine (ACh), LM contractile intensity was the most potent in cornua, slightly weaker in the corpus and weakest in the cervix. CM was insensitive to NA, and contractile responses elicited by ACh indicated no regional variation. 4. NA content, significantly greater in LM than in CM, was most highly concentrated in cornual LM. Nerves exhibiting glyoxylic acid-induced histofluorescence occurred in both LM and CM, though more abundantly in LM and with notable density in the cornual LM. Cholinesterase activity, distributed evenly throughout the three myometrial regions studied, was more intense in LM than in CM. 5. These results show that, in swine myometrium, innervation in cornual LM is predominantly noradrenergic, cervical LM is mostly cholinergic, and throughout the myometrium the CM layers are principally cholinergic.", 
    "69": "Alveolar and lung liquid clearances were studied over 1, 4, and 6 h in intact anesthetized ventilated rats by instillation of 5% albumin solution with 1.5 microCi of 125I-labeled albumin (3 ml/kg into 1 lung or 6 ml/kg into both lungs). Alveolar protein clearance as measured by residual 125I-albumin in the lung over 6 h was similar to the slow rates measured in other species. Alveolar liquid clearance was estimated by the concentration of albumin in the air spaces. After 1 h, this concentration was 7.8 +/- 0.7 g/dl, which was significantly greater than the initial protein concentration of 5.3 +/- 0.2 g/dl (P < 0.05). Amiloride (10(-3) M) inhibited 45% of the basal alveolar liquid clearance, and ouabain (10(-3) M), instilled and intravenously infused (0.004 mg), inhibited 30% of the clearance. beta-Adrenergic agonist instillation increased alveolar liquid clearance to the fastest 1-h rate (48 +/- 3% of instilled volume) that we observed in any intact species. The removal of the instilled fluid from the lung (expressed as lung liquid clearance; 0.96 +/- 0.3 ml/h) was twice as fast as the rate of alveolar and lung liquid clearance reported in the isolated or in situ rat lung models. The rate of alveolar and lung liquid clearance in these intact rats was significantly faster than those in prior studies in dogs and sheep and was similar to the rates in rabbits.", 
    "70": "We tested the hypothesis that respiration would be stimulated after vasopressin (AVP) V1 receptor blockade because of disinhibition and activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Intravenous infusion of angiotensin II (ANG II) stimulates respiration, presumably centrally, via circumventricular organs. In the present study, the AVP V1 receptor antagonist [1-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid),2-(O-methyl)tyrosine]-Arg8-AVP (PMP; 10 micrograms/kg i.v.) was administered to six awake resting dogs. Measurements were made 30 min prior, and 60 min subsequent, to injection of PMP (protocol 1). In three other protocols, the ANG II blocker saralasin (0.5 microgram.kg-1.min-1 i.v.) was infused starting 20 min before PMP (protocol 2) and 30 min after PMP (protocol 4) and saline was infused (0.2 ml/min) over 90 min as a control (protocol 3). After PMP in protocol 1, alveolar ventilation increased and arterial PCO2 decreased (approximately 3 Torr). ANG II receptor blockade prevented (protocol 2) and reversed (protocol 4) respiratory stimulation by PMP. Despite ventilatory stimulation, plasma renin activity and ANG II were not increased after PMP relative to control (protocol 3). We conclude that AVP acts at V1 receptors to inhibit formation of brain ANG II. Brain ANG II must modulate respiratory control via a circumventricular organ, because systemically administered saralasin, which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, blocked stimulation of respiration.", 
    "71": "The effects of beta-blockade on skeletal muscle excitability and fatiguability during exercise were examined. Ten healthy males (mean age 21.9 +/- 1.1 yr) performed a 4-min fatigue protocol consisting of intermittent isometric voluntary contractions of the knee extensors in one leg. Subjects performed the exercise after treatment with placebo, 100 mg metoprolol, or an equipotent dose of propranolol (60 mg, n = 1; 80 mg, n = 8; 100 mg, n = 1) twice a day for 76 h before testing according to a randomized double-blind design. The evoked twitch torque, maximal voluntary torque, and maximal M-wave amplitude were unaffected by the beta-blockade treatments before fatigue. During the placebo trial, there were significant reductions in the evoked and voluntary torques (77 +/- 15 and 55 +/- 11%, respectively) after the fatigue protocol; however, both the voluntary electromyogram and evoked M waves were well maintained throughout fatigue. The beta-blockade treatments had no significant effect on torque or electromyogram activity over the course of the exercise. Thus, despite evidence for an impairment of dynamic exercise performance with beta 1- and beta 1,2-blockade, there appears to be no effect of these agents on muscle excitability and fatiguability during isometric muscle activity.", 
    "72": "One of the functions of glial receptors is to regulate synthesis and release of a variety of neuropeptides and growth factor peptides, which in turn act on neurons or other glia. Because of the potential importance of these interactions in injured brain, we have examined the role of two different receptors in the regulation of astrocyte neuropeptide synthesis. Stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors on type 1 astrocytes resulted in increased mRNA and protein for the proenkephalin (PE) and somatostatin genes. This receptor also increased expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The potential role of opiate receptors was examined in several ways. Treatment of newborn rats for 7 days with the opiate antagonist naltrexone, prior to preparation of astrocytes, had no effect on PE mRNA or met-enkephalin content but resulted in a significant increase in NGF content. However, treatment of astrocytes in culture with met-enkephalin, morphine, or naltrexone had no effect on any of these parameters. No opiate binding could be detected, using either etorphine or bremazocine, to membranes of astrocytes prepared from cortex, cerebellum, striatum, or hippocampus of 1-day, 7-day, or 14-day postnatal rats. Thus we conclude that type 1 astrocytes do not express opiate receptors and that the in vivo effects of naltrexone are mediated indirectly via some other cell type/receptor.", 
    "73": "The progression of diabetic nephropathy can be positively influenced by maintaining a low blood pressure level. This has been shown in studies with conventional antihypertensive treatment as well as with ACE inhibitors. Whether the latter group of drugs is more effective remains to be proven and was the aim of our study. In a prospective randomized study we compared the effects of ACE inhibition and beta-blockade on retarding progression of renal function in IDDM patients with an early stage of overt diabetic nephropathy. Twenty-nine patients were studied for 2 years, 15 were randomized for treatment with captopril and 14 for atenolol. Every 6 weeks blood pressure and urinary albumin and total protein excretion were measured. GFR was measured every 6 months as 51Cr-EDTA clearance. Baseline values for blood pressure, renal function and albuminuria were identical in the two groups. The effect of both drugs on blood pressure was not significantly different. In the captopril-treated patients MAP before and after 2 years was 110 +/- 3 (SEM) and 100 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively and in the atenolol-treated patients 105 +/- 2 vs 101 +/- 2 mm Hg. Both drugs reduced albuminuria and total proteinuria to the same extent. With captopril albuminuria decreased from 1549 (989-2399) to 851 (537-1380) mg/24 h and proteinuria from 2.5 (1.6-3.8) to 1.2 (0.8-1.8) g/24 h. With atenolol albuminuria decreased from 933 (603-1445) to 676 (437-1047) mg/24 h and proteinuria from 1.5 (1.0-2.4) to 0.9 (0.6-1.5) g/24 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "79": "1. The effect of induced water absorption on the intestinal permeability of antipyrine, atenolol and enalaprilat in the proximal jejunum was studied in eight healthy subjects with a regional intestinal perfusion technique. 2. The mean (+/- s.d.) net water flux changed from a secretory status of 1.2 +/- 1.2 ml h-1 cm-1 to an absorptive status of -3.7 +/- 3.5 ml h-1 cm-1 (P < 0.0025) on the introduction of a hypo-osmolar glucose-containing electrolyte solution. 3. The mean permeability values for the three drugs in the eight subjects were unchanged despite the increase in net water absorption (5.7 +/- 3.0 to 7.0 +/- 3.6 x 10(-4) cm s-1 for antipyrine, 0.1 +/- 0.2 to 0.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(-4) cm s-1 for atenolol and 0.3 +/- 0.3 to 0.1 +/- 0.2 x 10(-4) cm s-1 for enalaprilat). One subject showed a large change in the permeability for antipyrine and atenolol in parallel with a large increase in water absorption, but enalaprilat was unaffected. 4. The luminal recovery of PEG 4000 was similar before (100 +/- 4%) and during (101 +/- 7%) induction of water absorption, which indicates that the barrier function of the intestine appears to be maintained during glucose-stimulated fluid absorption in man. 5.

    "80": "We compared the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with quinapril to those of selective beta-blockade with atenolol and calcium channel blockade with verapamil in 10 hypertensive subjects in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study. All antihypertensive agents reduced baseline mean arterial pressure equally and did not modify forearm vascular resistance compared to placebo. In response to sustained handgrip exercise, both quinapril and verapamil, but not atenolol, attenuated the pressor response. However, verapamil was associated with an exaggerated increase in forearm vascular resistance during handgrip, whereas quinapril did not alter this response compared to placebo. It is concluded that quinapril and verapamil reduce the pressor response during isometric exercise by quantitatively different effects on the vasoconstrictor response in, as well as outside of, skeletal muscles.", 
    "81": "Numerous factors may influence an individual patient's response to antihypertensive therapy. The physician should select therapy that is more likely to effectively control the patient's blood pressure. In addition to age and race, specific properties of the drugs plus the method of administration can influence response. Most antihypertensives can be given once or twice daily without the need for sustained-release dosage forms. The appropriate selection of regular-release products can significantly reduce the cost of therapy and improve adherence to the regimen. Because most antihypertensives exist as isomers of two compounds, response to a given agent can be influenced by the type of product (eg, sustained-release) or the method of administration. When these variables are considered for individual patients, it is more likely that a given drug will be effective.",

Ten patients were receiving beta-blockade at the time of both tests. Triple-, double- and single-vessel disease was present in eight, seven and five patients, respectively. Exercise produced a large increase in double product (8970 +/- 288 to 20,-984 +/- 690 mm Hg min-1) while adenosine produced no significant change (8440 +/- 280 to 9086 +/- 600 mm Hg min-1). Each of the three gated planar images (anterior 40 degrees and 70 degrees left anterior oblique) was divided into five equal segments. Exercise produced 44/90, 44/95 and 45/95 abnormal segments in the anterior, 40 degrees and 70 degrees views while adenosine produced 53/100, 44/100 and 52/100 abnormal segments for the same views.

In the presence of both prazosin (1 microM) and propranolol (1 microM) only small dextral shifts of the concentration-response curves to agonists were observed and an order of potency of BRL 37344 (2.5) > isoprenaline (1.0) > noradrenaline (0.2) > adrenaline (0.1) was obtained. 4. In the presence of prazosin (1 microM) and propranolol (1 microM), cyanopindolol (0.1-10 microM) produced a concentration-dependent rightward shift of the concentration-response curve to adrenaline with a Schild slope not significantly different from unity and a mean pA2 value of 7.01. 5. The resistance of relaxant responses to propranolol, the relatively high potency of BRL 37344 compared to catecholamines and the competitive antagonism of relaxant responses to adrenaline by cyanopindolol suggest that beta-adrenoceptors in rat small intestine are mainly atypical in nature.", 
    "84": "1. Patients with airway infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa have impaired mucociliary clearance. Pyocyanin is a phenazine pigment produced by P. aeruginosa which is present in the sputum of colonized patients, slows human ciliary beat frequency (CBF) in vitro and slows mucociliary transport in vivo in the guinea-pig. 2. We have investigated the effect of salmeterol, a long-acting beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, on pyocyanin-induced slowing of human CBF in vitro. Salmeterol (2 x 10(-7) M) was found to reduce pyocycanin (20 micrograms ml-1)-induced slowing of CBF by 53% and the fall in intracellular adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) by 26% and ATP by 29%. 3. Another beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline (2 x 10(-7) M), also inhibited pyocyanin-induced slowing of CBF by 39%. 4. The effects of salmeterol (30 min preincubation) persisted after washing the cells. 5. Propranolol (10(-7) M) and the beta 2-specific antagonist, ICI 118551 (10(-6) M) blocked the protective effects of salmeterol completely, but atenolol (10(-6) M) was less effective. These results suggested that the effects of salmeterol on pyocyanin-induced effects were mediated primarily via the stimulation of beta 2-adrenoceptors. 6. Pyocyanin-induced ciliary slowing is associated with a substantial fall in intracellular cyclic AMP and ATP. Salmeterol reversed the effects of pyocyanin on cyclic AMP and ATP. 7. Mucociliary clearance is an important defence mechanism of the airways against bacterial infection. Salmeterol may benefit patients colonized by P. aeruginosa, not only by its bronchodilator action, but also by protecting epithelial cells from pyocyanin-induced slowing of CBF.", 
    "85": "1. Coronary vascular responses to bilateral carotid occlusion (BCO) and the intravenous infusion of tyramine (Tyr, 20 micrograms kg-1 min-1) and noradrenaline (NA, 0.5 microgram kg-1 min-1) were examined after bilateral vagotomy and antagonism of beta-adrenoceptors. BCO, Tyr and NA decreased large coronary artery diameter and increased mean coronary resistance and systemic arterial pressure without affecting heart rate. 2. Inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthase with NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 5 and 15 mg kg-1) significantly increased mean arterial pressure and decreased heart rate and large coronary artery diameter. Mean coronary resistance was unaffected by either dose of L-NNA. L-NNA significantly reduced depressor and coronary vasodilator responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (ACh, 10 micrograms kg-1, i.v.). Systemic and coronary vasodilator responses to sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 5 micrograms kg-1) were unaffected by L-NNA with the exception that the dilatation of the large coronary artery was significantly enhanced by the higher dose. 3. L-NNA significantly enhanced constriction of the large coronary arteries caused by BCO, Tyr and NA but did not affect the increases in mean coronary resistance or systemic arterial pressure. 4. Inhibition of NO synthesis enhances adrenergic constriction of large coronary arteries caused by both neuronally released and exogenous noradrenaline. In contrast, L-NNA did not affect adrenergic constriction of coronary or systemic resistance vessels. Endothelium-derived NO may play an important role in the modulation of noradrenergic vasoconstriction in coronary conductance arteries.", 
    "86": "Based on selected patient populations, several randomized trials have shown beta blockers to decrease mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Beta blockers, mainly metoprolol, were prescribed for 66% of all survivors at discharge. They were more frequently prescribed for younger patients and for those with a previous history of AMI and hypertension, but less frequently for those with a history of congestive heart failure and diabetes mellitus. Patients for whom beta blockers were not prescribed haa a 1-year mortality of 27% versus 11% for the rest (p < 0.001). Independent predictors of 1-year mortality after discharge were age (p < 0.001), history of hypertension (p < 0.001), prescription of beta blockers at discharge (p < 0.001), congestive heart failure during hospitalization (p < 0.001), and a history of AMI (p < 0.01). P values were corrected for baseline differences. Beta blockers were not prescribed at discharge for one-third of survivors after AMI. This group had a very high mortality during the first year. When simultaneously considering various risk indicators for death, prescription of beta blockers at discharge was associated with an increased rate of survival.", 
    "87": "To compare the hemodynamic, antiischemic, metabolic, and neurohumoral effects of intravenous esmolol (beta 1 blocking agent) and gallopamil (verapamil-like calcium channel blocker), 14 patients with angiographically proven CAD and reproducible ST segment depression were studied at rest and during exercise under control conditions and after an intravenous bolus injection of esmolol (0.5 mg/kg/1 min, followed by an infusion with 0.2 mg/kg/min) or gallopamil (0.025 mg/kg/3 min). In contrast to gallopamil, esmolol significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (175.7 vs. 160 mm Hg) and heart rate (107.4 vs. 96.9 min-1) during exercise as well as cardiac output (11.57 vs. 9.38 l/min) and significantly enhanced systemic vascular resistance both at rest (1241 vs. 1479 dynes.s.cm-5) and during exercise (805 vs. 947 dynes.s.cm-5). On the other hand, exercise filling pressures and lactate levels (3.66 vs. 3.05 mmol/l) were significantly reduced by gallopamil only. Thus, the significant improvement of exercise tolerance by both esmolol and gallopamil is based on different mechanisms of action: esmolol improves myocardial ischemia by appreciably reducing myocardial oxygen consumption, whereas gallopamil primarily improves oxygen supply and ventricular performance. Plasma catecholamines, atrial natriuretic factor, and aldosterone levels as well as plasma renin activity were identically influenced by esmolol and gallopamil, respectively. A reflex activation of the sympathetic system did not occur.", 
    "88": "Forty patients scheduled to undergo elective myocardial revascularization were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate any influence of esmolol on the incidence of myocardial ischemia. Calibrated recordings of ECG leads II and V5 were continuously monitored with the QMED Monitor One TC (Qmed Inc, Clark, NJ) from the time of arrival in the operating room holding area through the induction of anesthesia, using a high-dose opioid technique, and until the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. One group received a bolus of esmolol, 1.0 mg/kg, followed by a continuous infusion of 100 micrograms/kg/min. The other group received a bolus and infusion of saline placebo of equal volume. The incidence of myocardial ischemia was not significantly different between the groups on arrival in the holding area, or at any study point. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and the number of patients developing myocardial ischemia during the course of the study also did not differ significantly between the groups. There were significant decreases in heart rate and mean arterial pressure compared with the awake baseline values in both groups during multiple study points. It is concluded that esmolol was ineffective at treating preexisting or new-onset myocardial ischemia at this dosage in this clinical setting.",

    "94": "The purpose of this study was to determine if intrapericardial infusion of hexamethonium, propranolol, or atropine affected extracardiac receptors in anesthetized dogs. Intrapericardial hexamethonium (> or = 25 mg) decreased renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) in a dose-dependent fashion. After 250 mg, RSNA began to decrease in 65 +/- 7 s. Whereas vagal stimulation caused a muscarinic receptor-mediated increase in tracheal smooth muscle tone (as indicated by a 9.6 +/- 1.1 mmHg increase in endotracheal cuff pressure), the increase in cuff pressure (1.8 +/- 0.4 mmHg) was attenuated after intrapericardial tropine (4 mg). When the ansa and vagus were stimulated simultaneously, beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated smooth muscle relaxation opposed the muscarinic receptor-mediated constriction resulting in an increase in cuff pressure of only 3.6 +/- 0.9 mmHg. After intrapericardial propranolol (8 mg), simultaneous ansa and vagal stimulation caused a 7.0 +/- 1.6 mmHg increase in cuff pressure, demonstrating that intrapericardial propranolol blocked beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated relaxation of tracheal smooth muscle. These results show that hexamethonium, atropine, and propranolol infused intrapericardially have extracardiac effects.", 
    "95": "Plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentration ([NE]) gradient across the heart was measured under electrical stimulation of the left stellate ganglion (LSG; 4 Hz, 4 V, 2 ms pulse width, 1 min) in control (Ctrl) and in adrenalectomized (Adrx) dogs, without and with a 10-min epinephrine (Epi) infusion (92 ng.kg-1.min-1), which partly restored myocardial Epi stores in Adrx dogs (2.9 +/- 0.7 ng/g vs. 6.4 +/- 0.7 ng/g in Ctrl dogs) and slightly increased tissue Epi stores in Ctrl dogs (10.5 +/- 1.3 pg/g). Compared with Ctrl dogs (1,069 +/- 172 pg/ml), the [NE] gradient across the heart under stimulation of the LSG was not modified 1 wk after bilateral adrenalectomy (1,190 +/- 122 pg/ml) or after Epi infusion in Ctrl (1,134 +/- 276 pg/ml) and Adrx (1,259 +/- 279 pg/ml) dogs. The beta 2-antagonist ICI-118,551 significantly reduced the stimulation-induced [NE] gradient across the heart in Ctrl dogs (621 +/- 190 and 603 +/- 86 pg/ml without and with a 10-min Epi infusion, respectively) but not in Adrx dogs deprived of tissue Epi (1,345 +/- 345 pg/ml). Partial repletion of myocardial Epi stores in Adrx dogs restored the effect of ICI-118,551 on the stimulation-induced [NE] gradient (776 +/- 121 pg/ml). These results provide direct support of the hypothesis that tissue Epi, which originates from the adrenal medulla and which is released locally along with NE, is the endogenous agonist for presynaptic beta 2-receptors and potentiates NE release.", 
    "96": "To investigate developmental changes in the cellular electrophysiological effects of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation on canine Purkinje fibers (PF), we studied the effects of isoproterenol, a nonselective beta-agonist, and salbutamol, a preponderantly beta 2-agonist, alone or in presence of the selective beta 1-antagonist CGP-20712A or the beta 2-antagonist ICI-118551. Standard microelectrode techniques were used to study adult and neonatal (< 11 days) PF paced at a cycle length of 1 s or allowed to beat spontaneously. In paced adult PF, isoproterenol significantly increased the maximum diastolic potential and significantly decreased action potential duration at 60 and 90% of full repolarization (APD60 and APD90) in a concentration-dependent fashion. These effects were not observed in neonatal PF, which instead manifested a significant increase in phase 2 amplitude and APD30 that was not observed in adult PF. All these effects occurred as well with salbutamol but were less pronounced and required higher agonist concentrations. Isoproterenol decreased the automatic cycle length of adult fibers from 4,079 +/- 796 ms during control to 2,190 +/- 229 ms at 10(-5) M (P < 0.05) and from 1,535 +/- 105 to 1,249 +/- 90 ms in neonatal PF (P < 0.05). In both adults and neonates, > 90% of this effect was reached at a concentration of 10(-8) M. Salbutamol had the same effect but required higher concentrations. In both adults and neonates, the beta 2-antagonist ICI-118551 did not modify any of the effects of isoproterenol and salbutamol, whereas the beta 1-antagonist CGP-20712A significantly antagonized them. In conclusion, 1) the effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation on transmembrane potentials of canine PF change during development, both qualitatively (in paced PF) and quantitatively (in automatic PF) and 2) the responses seen are attributable to the activation of beta 1- and not beta 2-adrenoceptors.",

    "98": "Bufuralol hydroxylation activities of liver microsomal cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes were studied in the rat; the reaction has been used widely in determining levels of liver microsomal P450 2D6, which shows debrisoquine-type genetic polymorphism in humans. Liver microsomes catalyzed the conversion of bufuralol to 1'-hydroxybufuralol and a structurally unidentified metabolite (termed here as M-1) in the presence of an NADPH-generating system and molecular oxygen. Bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation activities catalyzed by the liver microsomes were not increased in rats treated with several P450 inducers, whereas beta-naphthoflavone treatment (and to a lesser extent that of isosafrole) caused a significant induction of M-1 formation. The major role of P450 1A1/2 in M-1 formation was confirmed by catalytic inhibition with anti-P450 antibodies and alpha-naphthoflavone in liver microsomes of beta-naphthoflavone-treated rats, and by reconstitution experiments containing P450 1A1 and 1A2. Among nine forms of purified rat P450 enzymes studied in the reconstituted system, P450 2C11 displayed the highest activities for bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation, followed by P450 1A1 and P450 2D1. A female-specific form of P450 2C12 did not catalyze bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation. In liver microsomes of male rats, however, P450 2D1 was the dominant enzyme because only anti-P450 2D1 antibodies, and not anti-P450 2C11 and anti-P450 1A1, inhibited the bufuralol hydroxylation activities, and a specific P450 2D1 inhibitor, quinine, caused a dramatic decrease in the hydroxylation activities. The major contribution of P450 2D1 in the bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation activities was also supported by a kinetic analysis of the reconstituted system; P450 2D1 enzyme had a very low Km value (8.4 microM) as compared with those of P450 2C11 (Km = 83 microM) and P450 1A1 (Km = 230 microM). Thus, the present results suggested that different P450 enzymes are involved in the hydroxylation of bufuralol in rat liver microsomes, and the kinetic analysis, as well as immunoinhibition and chemical inhibition experiments, may be of great importance for determining the major roles of P450 enzymes in drug hydroxylation reactions.", 
    "99": "We dynamically evaluated the effects of beta-blockade on the sensitivity of arterial baroreflex control of heart rate in 10 mild or moderate essential hypertensive patients in whom blood pressure was recorded intra-arterially for 24 hours in ambulatory conditions. Twenty-four-hour baroreflex sensitivity was assessed by both (1) a time-domain approach based on the calculation of the slope of the regression line between linearly related progressive increases in systolic blood pressure and pulse interval (+PI/+SBP sequences) and decreases in systolic blood pressure and pulse interval (-PI/-SBP sequences) and (2) a frequency-domain approach, ie, the ratio between the spectral powers of pulse interval and systolic blood pressure around 0.1 Hz (alpha coefficient). Data were obtained before and after 1 month of administration of either acebutolol (n = 5) or labetalol (n = 5). Before treatment, the 24-hour average slopes of the +PI/+SBP and -PI/-SBP sequences were 4.36 +/- 0.32 and 4.05 +/- 0.27 ms/mm Hg, respectively, while the alpha coefficient was 7.78 +/- 0.7 ms/mm Hg. After beta-blockade, these values were increased by 25.3 +/- 6.8%, 25.0 +/- 8.0%, and 32.1 +/- 9.3%, respectively (P < .01 for all values). Thus, beta-blockers potentiate baroreflex sensitivity in daily life. Time-domain and frequency-domain methods yielded superimposable results in dynamically evaluating 24-hour baroreflex sensitivity and its changes after beta-blockade.",

Multivariate analysis of the entire patient sample revealed age of 75 years or older (154 percent) and age 70 to 74 years (141 percent) to be associated with the highest relative risk of death in hospital. The increased relative risk associated with previous AMI was 45 percent.

Successful treatment of acute exacerbations begins with appropriate assessment and intervention. Supplemental oxygen is appropriate for all patients with hypoxemia, and mechanical ventilation should be considered in those with clouded consciousness, profound acidosis, or severe hypoxemia. Inhaled beta 2 agonists are the first line of therapy in acute exacerbations. Anticholinergics, methylxanthines, and corticosteroids may also be useful. Alternative therapies (eg, magnesium, glucagon, calcium channel blockers, clonidine, helium) are receiving increased attention and are undergoing investigation.", 
    "107": "The mechanism by which beta blockade improves left ventricular dysfunction in various cardiomyopathies has been ascribed to improved contractile function of the myocardium or to improved beta-adrenergic responsiveness. In this study we tested two hypotheses: (a) that chronic beta blockade would improve the left ventricular dysfunction which develops in mitral regurgitation, and (b) that an important mechanism of this effect would be improved innate contractile function of the myocardium. Two groups of six dogs with chronic severe mitral regurgitation were studied. After 3 mo both groups had developed similar and significant left ventricular dysfunction. One group was then gradually beta-blocked while the second group continued to be observed without further intervention. In the group that remained unblocked, contractile function remained depressed. However, in the group that received chronic beta blockade, contractile function improved substantially. The contractility of cardiocytes isolated from the unblocked hearts and then studied in the absence of beta receptor stimulation was extremely depressed. However, contractility of cardiocytes isolated from the beta-blocked ventricles was virtually normal. Consistent with these data, myofibrillar density was much higher, 55 +/- 4% in the beta-blocked group vs. 39 +/- 2% (P < 0.01) in the unblocked group; thus, there were more contractile elements to generate force in the beta-blocked group. We conclude that chronic beta blockade improves left ventricular function in chronic experimental mitral regurgitation. This improvement was associated with an improvement in the innate contractile function of isolated cardiocytes, which in turn is associated with an increase in the number of contractile elements.", 
    "108": "It is unknown whether beta adrenergic stress has adverse hepatic hemodynamic effects. Therefore, the authors studied the hemodynamic effects of beta adrenergic stimulation and subsequent blockade in 10 patients with cirrhosis (6 Childs A, 3 Childs B, and 1 Childs C) with known or suspected portal hypertension. Free and wedged hepatic vein pressures, hepatic venous pressure gradient, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and azygos vein blood flow were measured at rest and after isoproterenol infusion (mean dose = 7.3 micrograms/min: target heart rate = 150% to 200% of resting heart rate). Esmolol, an ultra-short-acting beta blocker, was then infused (dose titrated to return heart rate to baseline), and all measurements were repeated. Based on the results, the authors conclude that beta adrenergic stress provoked by isoproterenol infusion significantly increases azygos vein blood flow and hepatic venous pressure gradient. Beta blockade with esmolol reduces azygos vein blood flow and hepatic venous pressure gradient significantly below baseline.", 
    "109": "Not all patients with neurocardiogenic syncope respond to beta-blockers. To determine whether differences in heart rate response to head-up tilt test with and without isoproterenol may predict drug efficacy, we evaluated 32 consecutive patients with a history of syncope, who were treated with beta-blockers after a positive tilt test. During the tilt test 21 patients (group A) with a baseline heart rate of 72 +/- 15 beats/min had tachycardia (mean 131 +/- 15) during tilt, before syncope, whereas 11 patients (group B) with a baseline heart rate of 68 +/- 13 beats/min did not (mean 86 +/- 13; p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between groups with regard to demographic and clinical characteristics or mean heart rate and mean arterial pressure in the supine position and during syncope. However, the proportion of patients requiring isoproterenol for provocation of syncope was significantly higher in group A compared with group B (15 of 21 vs 1 of 11; p < 0.001). All patients were treated with beta-blockers (propranolol or metoprolol). During a follow-up period of 18 +/- 6 months only one patient in group A had syncope and a positive tilt test compared with six patients in group B (9% vs 54%; p < 0.01). Development of tachycardia was a better predictor of drug efficacy than an isoproterenol-induced positive tilt test. The six nonresponders from group B were subsequently treated with disopyramide. During a mean follow-up period of 9 +/- 3 months, only one patient had syncope and another had a positive response to tilt test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Gugulipid significantly reduced (P < .01) peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under curve (AUC 0-8 hrs) of both the drugs in normal volunteers. Such interaction in patients receiving propanolol or diltiazem with gugulipid may lead to diminished efficacy or nonresponsiveness due to significant reduction in bioavailability.", 
    "111": "The prevention of sudden cardiac death remains one of the greatest challenges in the field of cardiovascular medicine today. Despite the difficulty in predicting which individuals are going to die suddenly, much knowledge has accumulated in recent years in regard to independent risk factors for SCD and moreover, different pharmacological interventions have been evaluated for the prevention of sudden coronary death. Currently, the beta-blockers are the only pharmacological agents that have been shown to reduce sudden cardiac deaths in clinical trials. The reduction in sudden death may involve several mechanisms that include antiatherosclerotic effects, antithrombotic effects, cardiac anti-ischemic effects and antifibrillatory effects.", 
    "112": "We investigated the role of the vasoconstrictors endothelin-1 (ET-1) and thromboxane in renal protection by the beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist, bisoprolol, in Dahl salt-sensitive rats (Dahl S) and salt-resistant rats (Dahl R). Six-week bisoprolol treatment (20 mg/kg chow) reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 14% in Dahl S rats fed a high-salt (4% NaCl) diet. This BP reduction was accompanied by a decrease in aortic wall thickness. ET-1 and thromboxane released from renal cortex was significantly decreased by 17 and 30% with bisoprolol, respectively. Other prostaglandin synthesis was unaffected. Renal function such as proteinuria, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) excretion, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not influenced by bisoprolol. Morphologic investigation showed that bisoprolol significantly improved glomerular sclerosis by 29% and attenuated arterial damage by 71%, although tubular injury was not affected. The more severe the glomerulosclerotic lesions, the greater the generation of thromboxane and ET. The arterial lesions were positively correlated to thromboxane generation. These data indicate that long-term bisoprolol treatment reduces vasoconstrictive ET-1 and thromboxane generation and that these alterations may be partly responsible for the amelioration of glomerular and arterial injury in Dahl S rats.", 
    "113": "beta-Receptor blockers may exert a spectrum of metabolic and humoral effects, which might differ depending on the specific adrenoreceptor characteristics of the individual agents. We investigated the influence of celiprolol, a beta 1-blocker with beta 2-agonistic and, possibly, additional weak alpha-receptor antagonistic properties, on insulin sensitivity (SI), glucose homeostasis, and lipid profile in 20 young, healthy, normotensive individuals. SI, fasting plasma glucose and insulin, serum total triglycerides (TG), lipoprotein cholesterol (C) fractions, lipoprotein a [Lp(a)], and plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) levels were determined before and after acute glucose loading under placebo conditions and after 3 weeks of celiprolol administration. The participants were instructed to follow a 3-day standard diet (2,500 kcal/day, 45% carbohydrates, 40% fat, and 15% protein) and an overnight fast before measurements were recorded. As compared with control values, SI, fasting plasma glucose and insulin, the areas under the glucose and insulin curves, the k value of glucose disappearance after glucose load, and serum cholesterol fractions, TG, and Lp(a) were unchanged during celiprolol administration. However, celiprolol significantly reduced plasma ANF levels (p < 0.02). The latter increased in response to acute hyperglycemia/hyperinsulinemia with placebo (p < 0.05) but not with celiprolol. Although diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased slightly during the first and second week of celiprolol administration, BP and heart rate (HR) did not differ significantly after 3 weeks on celiprolol treatment as compared with placebo conditions. Our findings demonstrate that in healthy lean humans beta-receptor modulation with celiprolol is neutral with regard to SI and lipoprotein metabolism. Moreover, glucose loading stimulates whereas celiprolol decreases plasma ANF levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "114": "We have analyzed the biophysical and pharmacological properties of five cloned K+ (Kv) channels (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, Kv1.5, and Kv3.1) stably expressed in mammalian cell lines. Kv1.1 is biophysically similar to a K+ channel in C6 glioma cells and astrocytes, Kv1.3 and Kv3.1 have electrophysiological properties identical to those of the types n and l K+ channels in T cells, respectively, and Kv1.5 closely resembles a rapidly activating delayed rectifier in the heart. Each of these native channels may be formed from the homomultimeric association of the corresponding Kv subunits, and pharmacological compounds that selectively modulate them may be useful for the treatment of neurological, immune, and cardiac disorders. The cell lines described in this report could be used to identify such drugs and we have therefore embarked on a pharmacological characterization of the five cloned channels. The compounds tested in this study include 4-aminopyridine, capsaicin, charybdotoxin, cromakalim, dendrotoxin, diltiazem, D-sotalol, flecainide, kaliotoxin, mast cell degranulating peptide, nifedipine, noxiustoxin, resiniferatoxin, and tetraethylammonium.", 
    "115": "Disulfiram, an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor, induces a flushing reaction upon the ingestion of ethanol, exerting aversion against alcohol that has been used in the treatment of alcoholism. This unpleasant response has been associated with an accumulation of acetaldehyde, and more recently, with an increase in vascular prostacyclin (PGI2) production. To evaluate the possibility of evoking the flushing reaction with drugs less toxic than disulfiram, we studied the effects of propranolol and dipyridamole on ALDH and PGI2. Acetaldehyde oxidation rate was assessed by gas chromatography in mitochondria from rats treated with these drugs for seven days. Prostacyclin generation was determined in rat aortic rings incubated in Krebs-Ringer with these drugs separately and associated to acetaldehyde, and measured by radioimmunoassay of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. Propranolol inhibited acetaldehyde oxidation rate whereas dipyridamole did not. Furthermore, propranolol increased blood acetaldehyde levels without affecting ethanol elimination rate. Both drugs stimulated prostacyclin synthesis but only dipyridamole enhanced the stimulatory effect of acetaldehyde on vascular prostacyclin production. These results strongly suggest the possibility of producing a deterrent effect on the consumption of alcohol by using propranolol or dipyridamole. In contrast to disulfiram, these drugs could potentially induce the flushing reaction in humans in the presence of low acetaldehyde concentrations; this new therapeutic approach might have an important clinical and toxicological relevance.", 
    "116": "Effects of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) partial inverse agonist FG 7142 (FG) on basal and reactive cardiovascular measures were examined in freely moving rats. FG (8 mg/kg) modestly increased basal heart period, but had no effects on basal blood pressure. More notably, however, FG augmented the cardioacceleratory response to an auditory stimulus relative to vehicle controls. Selective blockade of sympathetic (atenolol, 1 mg/kg) or parasympathetic (scopolamine methylnitrate, 0.1 mg/kg) effects on the heart under control conditions revealed that the stimulus-evoked cardiac response originated from a concurrent (reciprocal) sympathetic activation and vagal withdrawal. Following FG pretreatment, both atenolol and scopolamine blocked the cardioacceleratory response to the auditory stimulus. Thus, although FG minimally increased basal heart period, FG significantly enhanced a reactive cardioacceleration. More importantly, these results demonstrate that the cardiovascular effects of BZR inverse agonists are more fully characterized by an assessment of both tonic and reactive cardiovascular responses.", 
    "117": "Global annual mortality in hospitalized patients with symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is just under 5%. Several treatments have been proposed for this severe disease in order to improve diastolic function and reduce the intraventricular obstacle. The aim is to improve symptomatology and prognosis. The mainstay of treatment is drug therapy. The negative inotrope and bradytrope action of beta-blockers given at medium doses of 160 to 320 mg/day (propranolol) helps decrease the incidence of dyspnoea chest pain and the frequency of syncopes in 30 to 70% of the patients. Higher doses up to 1 g per day may be helpful in certain patients, but with the risk of sudden death. Calcium channel inhibitors at a dose of 360 mg/day for verapamil give very favourable results in patients managed medically and sometimes in those undergoing surgery. Amiodarone is essentially used as an antiarrhythmic drug in obstructive syndromes complicated by severe ventricular arrhythmias. Wider use is limited due to cardiac and extracardiac side effects. Other drugs including disopyramide, diuretics, digitalics and antivitamin K agents also have a role to play. The aim of surgery is to alleviate the intraventricular obstacle, correct mitral regurgitation and increase left ventricular compliance. There has been much controversy over the most adapted approach, but the most commonly used technique is currently septal myectomy which reduces the intraventricular gradient by 80 to 90%. Simple mitral valve replacement gives similar improvement in cardiac haemodynamics but exposes the patient to the complications inherent with mitral prostheses. Dual chamber sequential pacing has also been proven to be an effective means of treating hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, reducing the risk of sudden death as well as symptomatology in selected patients. Apical pre-stimulation using a short atrio-ventricular delay and the paradoxical septal movement induced by right ventricular stimulation decreases the sub-aortic obstruction and thus improves left ventricular performance. This method must be confirmed by mid- and long term results. We are in agreement with the Mayo Clinic recommendations that surgical myectomy remains the preferred treatment for most patients with severe hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy who are unresponsive to medical treatment.", 
    "118": "Although it is well known that the mammalian amygdala comprises a heterogeneous complex of cytoarchitectonically and histochemically distinct nuclei, the association of these nuclei with different monoamine systems has not been described in detail. We therefore investigated the pattern of receptors for monoamines in the amygdala of the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri). Binding sites for the alpha 2-adrenoceptor ligand (3H)rauwolscine, the alpha 1-adrenoceptor ligand (3H)prazosin, the beta-adrenoceptor ligand (125I)iodocyanopindolol, and the serotonin1A-receptor ligand (3H)8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin were visualized by in vitro autoradiography, and anatomically localized by comparing the autoradiograms to Nissl- and acetylcholinesterase-stained sections. To characterize binding of the radioligands pharmacologically, displacement experiments with different specific competitors were performed. Whereas the highest number of alpha 2-adrenergic binding sites was detected in the medial and the central nucleus as well as in the intercalated nuclei, the majority of serotonin1A binding sites was found in the magnocellular basal nucleus and the accessory basal nucleus, demonstrating a clear difference in the anatomy of the alpha 2-adrenergic and the serotonin1A receptor systems. In contrast, the pattern of alpha 1-adrenoceptor binding partially overlaps with that of both former receptor types. While the number of alpha-adrenergic and serotonin1A binding sites is relatively high in the tree shrew amygdala, there is a low number of beta-adrenergic binding sites in most nuclei. However, in the cortical nuclei, moderate to high numbers of binding sites for all radioligands are present. Therefore, according to our data on the tree shrew amygdala, which is anatomically similar to the amygdala of cats and primates, alpha 2-adrenoceptors cover primarily the medial part of the amygdaloid formation and serotonin1A-receptors predominantly occupy the basal nuclei, whereas alpha 1-adrenoceptors are present in both parts of the formation."
