    "0": "Effects of acute and chronic arterial hypertension on self-stimulation operant behaviour were studied in cats and rats. Small doses of noradrenaline facilitated the self-stimulation, whereas high doses depressed or stopped it. The depressive effect was accompanied by an obvious increase in the blood pressure. Chronic neurogenic hypertension can be induced by means of overloading the higher nervous system. A marked suppression of self-stimulation behaviour was found in chronic hypertensive rats. Decrease of the arterial pressure induced with an anti-hypertensive drug (catapresan) resulted in a temporary recovery of self-stimulation reaction. Baroafferent mechanisms of inhibition of positive emotional structures of the hypothalamus are discussed.", 
    "1": "Serum protein binding of penbutolol, a non-cardioselective beta-blocker agent of basic nature, has been studied in healthy subjects and in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. The percentage of free penbutolol in serum containing 200 ng/ml was markedly increased in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, when compared with the group of healthy volunteers (8.17 +/- 1.13% in patients vs 3.41 +/- 0.19 in control). No significant differences in the levels of serum alpha-acid-glycoprotein (the major protein implicated in the serum binding of penbutolol) were detected. Differences in the overall affinity constant for the binding were apparent between both groups (nKa = 5.28 X 10(5) M-1 in patients vs 12.03 X 10(5) M-1 in healthy volunteers). These results suggest a qualitative change in alpha-acid-glycoprotein molecule, from hepatic patients, but further studies are needed to clarify this point.", 
    "2": "Young male Sprague-Dawley rats were induced to overeat (approximately 45%) by provision of a \"cafeteria\" (CAF) diet of palatable human foods. Normophagic rats fed a commercial chow or a semisynthetic diet served as controls. The CAF rats exhibited (a) the reduced food efficiency and the propranolol-inhibitable elevation in resting metabolic rate (resting VO2) that are indicative of a facultative diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) by which excess energy gain is resisted, and (b) certain changes in brown adipose tissue (BAT) that are among those taken as evidence for BAT as the effector of DIT, e.g., increased protein content and increased mitochondrial binding of GDP. To assess directly and quantitatively the contribution by BAT to the elevation in VO2 (apparent DIT) of the CAF rats, BAT O2 consumption was determined (Fick principle) from measurements of tissue blood flow (microsphere method) and the arteriovenous difference in blood O2 across interscapular BAT (IBAT). To obtain the measurements, the animals were fitted under halothane anesthesia with vascular cannulas for intraventricular injection of microspheres and sampling of arterial blood and the venous effluent of IBAT. After recovery from anesthesia and rewarming to normal body temperature the animals were placed singly in a temperature-controlled metabolic chamber and the measurements, which also included determination of resting VO2, were made 1.5-2 h later about 11:30 h. As determined from measurements made at 28 degrees C (thermoneutrality) mean values of resting VO2 for the cannulated rats were unchanged from those of intact (unoperated) CAF or control rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "A patient with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with exertional near syncope is reported. Intra-right ventricular obstruction was demonstrated by hemodynamic studies during inspiration and the Valsalva maneuver with systemic hypotension. Improvement occurred following the administration of propranolol. It was suggested that syncope might be precipitated by hemodynamic changes such as a high output state and a depressed cardiac volume in relation to intra-right ventricular obstruction in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", 
    "4": "The effect of KW-3049, (+/-)-(R*)-2,6-dimethyl-4-(m-nitrophenyl)-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarb oxylic acid (R*)-1-benzyl-3-piperidinyl ester, methyl ester hydrochloride on myocardial infarction in rats was examined, in comparison with some other drugs. Extension of myocardial infarction was assessed by separately determining the tissue creatine kinase (CK) activity of left ventricular free wall (LVFW) and that of interventricular septum. Loss of CK activity was limited to LVFW until 6 h after the ligation of the left main coronary artery, while 24 h after the ligation, it extended to the septum. Therefore, the effects of drugs were examined mainly in rats following 6 h of coronary artery ligation. Pretreatments with KW-3049 at 1 and 3 mg/kg (p.o.), given 1 h before coronary artery ligation, significantly reduced the loss of CK activity of LVFW by 45.3 and 39.7%, respectively. Also, posttreatment with KW-3049 at 30 micrograms/kg (i.p.), given 10 min after the ligation, significantly reduced the loss of CK activity by 30.6%. On the other hand, nifedipine (3, 10 mg/kg, p.o.), propranolol (100 mg/kg, p.o.), OKY-1581 (100 mg/kg, p.o.) and BM 13.177 (100 mg/kg, p.o.), each of which was given 1 h before coronary ligation, did not significantly reduce the loss of CK activity. Coronary artery ligation for 6 h significantly decreased the myocardial contents of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine phosphate (CP). Pretreatments with KW-3049 at 1 and 3 mg/kg (p.o.) reduced the decrease in ATP and CP. These results suggest that KW-3049 possesses a superior cardioprotective effect in comparison with the other drugs examined. The possible implications for the protection by KW-3049 are discussed.", 
    "5": "Cardiotonic activity of a new, non-catecholamine and non-glycoside positive inotropic agent, 5-methyl-6-(4-pyridyl)-2H-1,4-thiazin-3(4H)-one hydrochloride (ZSY-27), was investigated in isolated guinea pig left atria, cat right ventricular papillary muscle and cross-circulated excised dog papillary muscle preparations, and in anesthetized open-chest dogs. In electrically driven guinea pig left atria and cat papillary muscle preparations, ZSY-27 (3 x 10(-6)-10(-4) M) increased the developed tension in a concentration-related manner. The positive inotropic effect of ZSY-27 was not blocked by propranolol (3 x 10(-8) M) in the guinea pig atria, but was significantly inhibited by carbachol (5 x 10(-6) M) in cat papillary muscle preparations. The positive inotropic effect of ZSY-27 was comparable to that of milrinone in guinea pig atria. ZSY-27 (0.01-3 mg) increased dose-dependently the developed tension in cross-circulated excised dog papillary muscle preparations as well. In anesthetized dogs, ZSY-27 (0.03-1 mg/kg, i.v.) produced a dose-dependent increase in left ventricular contractile force and a decrease in blood pressure, while the increase in heart rate was relatively small. The pharmacological profile of ZSY-27 in anesthetized dogs was similar to that of milrinone. These results suggest that ZSY-27 is potent cardiotonic agent with vasodilator activity and its effect may be partially due to an increase in the intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate level.", 
    "6": "The effect of voltaren on the electrical and contractile activity of smooth muscle cells of the rabbit portal vein and the bovine cerebral arteries was studied by sucrose gap method. Voltaren was found to rarefy (10(-6)-10-10(-3)mol/l) or to suppress (10(-4)-10(-3)mol/l) spontaneous electrical and contractile activity and to relax the portal vein muscle strips. At concentrations of 5.10(-6)-5.10(-3) mol/l voltaren caused a dose-dependent relaxation of the cerebral arterial muscle strips. The relaxation of the smooth muscles of the blood vessels induced by voltaren is suggested to be due to inhibition of calcium ions influx into muscle cells through different types of calcium channels.", 
    "7": "The efficacy of diltiazem in comparison with metoprolol in chronic stable angina was assessed in 33 male patients during a 15-week blind cross-over study. After an initial two-week run-in period, baseline measurements were made. Subsequently, the patients entered a blind cross-over study consisting of two six-week treatment periods with diltiazem 240 mg (60 mg q.i.d.) or metoprolol 200 mg (100 mg b.i.d.). Dose adjustment to either 360 mg diltiazem (120 t.i.d.) or 400 mg metoprolol (200 b.i.d.) was allowed two weeks after the start of treatment. There was a one-week washout period between the two treatment periods. Compared to baseline values both drugs reduced the number of anginal attacks (diltiazem - 55%, P = 0.02; metoprolol - 73%, P = 0.01) and showed improvement of the measured exercise variables (exercise duration: diltiazem + 16%, P less than 0.001; metoprolol + 4%, P = NS; time to angina: diltiazem + 21%, P = 0.02, metoprolol + 14%, P = NS; maximal ST-depression: diltiazem + 13%, P = NS, metoprolol + 33%, P = 0.002). No significant change in LVEF was noticed. Both drugs reduced the mean heart rate on Holter tape (diltiazem - 11%, P = 0.006; metoprolol - 14%, P = 0.004). No effects on conduction were noticed. Although at the borderline of significance, diltiazem increased the total exercise duration as compared to metoprolol (16 vs. 4%, P = 0.05). It is concluded that diltiazem improves exercise tolerance in patients with stable angina pectoris and appears to be a safe and effective alternative to the beta-blocking agent metoprolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "A new cost-effective method for determining the amount of total propranolol (free and protein-bound) in plasma samples and the amount of the drug in tablets and injection solutions has been developed. The method is based on cation-exchange chromatography at pH 8.5 on an inexpensive column of agar, the native sulfate (and carboxylic) groups of which interact with the positively charged propranolol (this interaction is reinforced by the 'aromatic adsorption' characteristic of the agar matrix). The method can be used for quantitative analyses at both low (1 x 10(-2) mg/L) and high (5 x 10(3) mg/L) concentrations of the drug. For analyses of plasma and tablets--but not for injection solutions--extraction of the propranolol is required. The extraction time was 6 min. On a 6(ID) mm x 9 mm agar column the run time was less than 10 min.", 
    "9": "18 patients with severe congestion of the urinary tract in pregnancy were treated by implantation of ureteral catheters for intermittend exoneration. Before and during the infusion of 2 micrograms/min Fenoterol the basal tone, the frequency and amplitude of the contractions of the renal pelvis were measured after retrograde filling with increasing volumes. 45 min after the i.v. application of 10 mg Metoprolol the measurements were repeated under the same conditions. During the infusion of Fenoterol there was a significant decrease of the frequency and amplitude of the contractions of the renal pelvis. Whereas at low retrograde filling volumes the basal tone in the renal pelvis decreased, at higher filling volumes - because of the concomittant deteriation of the urine transport capacity - an increase of the basal tone could be found. The relaxant effects of the beta-stimulation on the upper urinary tract could be diminished by the application of the beta-1-blocker Metoprolol; a complete compensation however was not possible.", 
    "10": "The effect of chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine (60 mg/kg, 5 days prior to the experiment) on coronary blood flow and the percentage of perfused myocardial arterioles and capillaries was investigated in anesthetized open-chest rabbits and compared to a control group. In half of the animals, coronary flow was determined using radioactive microspheres. The others were given fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran to mark the perfused microvessels. Alkaline phosphatase stain was employed to locate the total microvasculature. A group of control and sympathectomized rabbits were administered 2 mg/kg of propranolol. Myocardial norepinephrine content was significantly decreased from 1108 +/- 161 (mean +/- SEM) in the control group to 162 +/- 31 ng/g wet weight in the denervated group as determined by HPLC technique and electrochemical analysis. However, the decrease in arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and coronary blood flow of the denervated group as compared to the control was not significant. Chemical sympathectomy significantly increased the number (Na) of the perfused capillaries from 57 +/- 3 to 66 +/- 3% and arterioles from 57 +/- 5 to 76 +/- 9%. A similar increase in the percentage of microvessels perfused with denervation was observed after propranolol. It is concluded that although denervation had no significant effect on the hemodynamic conditions or average coronary blood flow, it significantly increased the utilization of the myocardial microvessels. We suggest that the sympathetic nervous system and alpha adrenoceptors exert significant control of the utilization of coronary microvascular reserve.", 
    "11": "Arterial chemoreceptor discharge and ventilation are both significantly increased when the concentration of arterial potassium is raised to a level typical of moderate exercise. However, although the plasma potassium level of exercising, beta-blocked patients rises by more than that of normal subjects, this does not show up in their steady-state ventilatory response, i.e. exercising beta-blocked subjects ventilate no more than exercising controls. The present experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that the apparent failure of beta-blocked subjects to respond to the extra hyperkalaemia that they experience might be accounted for by a reduction in the sensitivity of arterial chemoreceptors to potassium. We used eleven pentobarbitone-anaesthetized, thoracotomized, artificially hyperventilated cats, in which arterial potassium was raised from ca. 4.5 to ca. 7 mM before and during beta blockade by propranolol or atenolol. The steady-state relation between chemoreceptor discharge and arterial potassium was curvilinear, discharge becoming more sensitive to potassium as the concentration of the latter was raised. Beta blockade significantly reduced discharge at all levels of plasma potassium (P less than 0.0001). It also significantly reduced (P less than 0.05) the slope of the response of discharge to a given increase of plasma potassium. Our results show that beta blockade decreases the sensitivity of arterial chemoreceptors to increases in arterial potassium. This may explain why exercising beta-blocked subjects breathe no harder than controls, in spite of the fact that they are more hyperkalaemic.", 
    "12": "This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that malfunction of the nonadrenergic noncholinergic inhibitory system (NANCIS) induces hyperreactive airways. Antigen sensitized guinea pigs were divided into four groups: (1) antigen challenge (n = 6), (2) 2 min oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) + antigen challenge (n = 5), (3) 27 min HbO2 + antigen challenge (n = 4), and (4) 2 min HbO2 + transmural stimulation (TS) + antigen challenge (n = 6). These animals were sensitized with ovalbumin 10 days before the study. In addition, 12 normal control animals without antigen sensitization were used for comparison. Under artificial ventilation, the anesthetized-paralyzed animals were hourly injected with atropine (0.2 mg/kg) and propranolol (1 mg/kg). Cervical segment of the trachea was converted to a closed tracheal pouch filled with Krebs solution containing also atropine (1 microM) and propranolol (3.5 microM). A change in the pouch pressure (Pp) reflected NANCIS TS- or antigen (5 micrograms) challenge-induced relaxation and/or constriction. HbO2 was used to inhibit NANCIS transmitter. There was no significant difference between normal and sensitized animals in the NANCIS TS-induced relaxation. Antigen challenge resulted in biphasic alteration in Pp, an initial increase and then a decrease after about 7 min. HbO2 pretreatment alone did not potentiate antigen-induced increase in Pp. HbO2 + TS, however, significantly abolished the late relaxation phase after antigen challenge.",

Furthermore, the effects of these drugs on the pressure-rate product were evaluated. 1. Vasopressin test (SHR): The administration of KW-3049 at 10 micrograms/kg (i.v.) developed an inhibitory effect comparable to that of nifedipine at 200 micrograms/kg (i.v.) against the ischemic ECG changes caused by the intravenous administration of vasopressin at 1 U/kg. The effects of KW-3049 at 3 and 10 mg/kg (p.o.) lasted for 8 h or more. 2. Coronary occlusion test (rat): The rise of T-wave of epicardial ECG following ligation of coronary artery was inhibited by the administration of KW-3049 at doses of 30 and 100 micrograms/kg i.v. Nifedipine at dose of 200 micrograms/kg i.v. was slightly effective. 3. Isoproterenol (isoprenaline) test (rat): The fall of ST in ECG by the continuous infusion of isoprenaline (10 micrograms/kg/min) was almost completely prevented by propranolol (500 micrograms/kg i.v.). Also, KW-3049 (200 micrograms/kg i.v.) and nifedipine (200 micrograms/kg i.v.) significantly inhibited the decline of ST, in which the former was more effective than the latter. 4. Anoxia test (SHR): The fall of ST and rise of T-wave of ECG, induced by stopping artificial respiration of gallamine-immobilized SHR, were suppressed by the administration of KW-3049 at doses of 10 and 30 micrograms/kg i.v.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "The antihypertensive action of (+/-)-(R*)-2,6-dimethyl-4- (m-nitrophenyl)- 1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid (R*)-1-benzyl-3-piperidinyl ester, methyl ester hydrochloride (benidipine hydrochloride, KW-3049) was evaluated in conscious, renal-hypertensive dogs. When KW-3049 (0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg) was orally administered, antihypertensive action and increased heart rate with peak time after 60 to 120 min of administration were observed, and the duration of actions at the dose of 0.3 mg/kg (p.o.) or more lasted for more than 7 h. When nifedipine (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) and nicardipine (1 and 3 mg/kg) were orally given, the duration of antihypertensive action was shorter. Nitrendipine (1 and 3 mg/kg p.o.) showed antihypertensive action and increased heart rate with peak time after 45 to 60 min of administration, and the duration of action at 3 mg/kg (p.o.) lasted for 7 h or longer. The antihypertensive activity of KW-3049 at the action peak was 6.1, 12.1 and 8.9 fold as compared with those of nifedipine, nicardipine and nitrendipine, respectively. Also, when KW-3049 at 0.3 mg/kg (p.o.) was administered after 1 h of propranolol (20 mg/kg p.o.) administration, the increase of the heart rate was markedly inhibited while its antihypertensive action remained unchanged. From these results, it was demonstrated that KW-3049 shows potent and long-lasting antihypertensive action with gradual appearance of action, and was suggested that it may be an useful antihypertensive agent.", 
    "15": "Three consecutive dose-response curves to aerosolized histamine were obtained in 11 anesthetized dogs. All dogs showed desensitization (i.e., tachyphylaxis) to high doses of histamine. Tachyphylaxis was highly reproducible. No tachyphylaxis occurred with inhaled acetylcholine or methacholine. Beta-Adrenergic blockade with propranolol or muscarinic blockade with atropine given intravenously had no effect on the histamine tachyphylaxis. Duration of thiamylal anesthesia did not alter the histamine responsiveness. Histamine tachyphylaxis was also seen with chloralose-urethan anesthesia. Since tachyphylaxis is not observed with acetylcholine, it cannot be attributed to a general decline in muscle contractility. We conclude that histamine tachyphylaxis in vivo is not explained by effects of cholinergic reflexes, catecholamine release, duration of anesthesia, or, probably, type of anesthetic agent.", 
    "16": "Fluctuation of hearing thresholds in an already severely to profoundly deaf child constitutes a stressing condition and a therapeutic challenge. Thorough medical inquiries revealed strong histories of migraine headaches in the parents of 13 severely deaf children (mean age: 7 years) and two of them also presented symptoms of migraine. This disease is viewed as a form of a relatively benign cerebral vasospasm causing an intense transitory vasodilatation of the small vessels of the brain and a subsequent sterile inflammatory reaction. Liberation of histamine, serotonin and plasma kinins appear to interfere with the metabolism of nerve cells. All children in our study had suffered from anoxia at birth, a condition related to a depopulation of cochlear brainstem nuclei. Migraines may therefore produce obvious hearing symptoms when vasomotor disturbances occur in already damaged nervous structures. Treatment with propranolol hydrochloride (HCl), a potent beta-blocker, resulted in cessation of hearing fluctuations in all patients and in an improvement of thresholds in two of them. We presented our results, as well as preliminary studies on asphyxiated rats shortly after birth, with transitory artificially induced cerebral vasodilatation.", 
    "17": "1. Ciguatoxin (CTX) caused a dose-dependent increase in the contractile force of the guinea-pig isolated left atria at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 ng ml-1 with the ED50 value of 0.5 ng ml-1. 2. In the atria, tetrodotoxin (5 x 10(-7) M) inhibited markedly the inotropic action of CTX. The inotropic effect of CTX at low concentrations was abolished by practolol (10(-5) M) and reserpine (2 mg kg-1 daily, for 3 days), whereas that of CTX at high concentrations was partially inhibited by both drugs. 3. In single atrial cells, CTX (3 ng ml-1) produced a marked increase in the amplitude of longitudinal contractions. 4. CTX (3 ng ml-1) caused marked prolongation in the falling phase of action potentials of atrial strips without affecting the maximum rate of rise of action potentials and membrane resting potentials. The effect of CTX on action potentials was abolished by tetrodotoxin (10(-6) M). 5. The whole-cell patch-clamp experiments on myocytes revealed that CTX (20 ng ml-1) shifted the current-voltage curve of Na inward currents by 40 mV in the negative direction. CTX caused a small sustained Na inward current even at resting membrane potentials. 6. These results suggest that the inotropic action of lower concentrations of CTX is primarily due to an indirect action via noradrenaline release, whereas that of higher concentrations is caused not only by an indirect action but also by a direct action on voltage-dependent Na channels of cardiac muscle. It is also suggested that CTX activates cardiac muscle Na channels by modifying the voltage-dependence of channel activation to increase Na inward currents, thus producing cardiotonic actions.", 
    "18": "1. Nifedipine can attenuate pressor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation both in the presence and in the absence of alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents. 2. In the presence of alpha,beta-methylene ATP, nifedipine produces only a small attenuation of the vasopressor response. 3. Nifedipine attenuates the vasopressor response produced by intravenous bolus administration of alpha,beta-methylene ATP. 4. The results suggest that the purinergic component of the vasopressor response to stimulation of the sympathetic outflow in the rat is subject to blockade by nifedipine, whereas the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated response to co-transmitter noradrenaline is relatively resistant.", 
    "19": "Preoperative management of treatment in thyrotoxicosis was investigated in a comparative study of carbimazole and propranolol in 41 consecutive patients collected during a 3-year period. The groups included 20 and 21 patients respectively, of equal sex and age distribution and of similar severity. The length of the preoperative treatment was significantly reduced in the propranolol pretreated patients (P greater than 0.001). Intraoperative blood loss, postoperative function with regard to the thyroid, parathyroids and vocal cords were similar in both groups. Three and two patients respectively had permanent hypothyroidism requiring thyroxin treatment. In patients with therapy compliance problems treatment with propranolol would entail a definite advantage, particularly in developing countries.", 
    "20": "A new method was used to study the effect of a single dose of propranolol on the QT intervals during exercise in 11 normal volunteers. They exercised maximally on a bicycle ergometer and repeated the test after taking propranolol (40 mg) by mouth two hours before. Electrocardiograms were continuously recorded on magnetic tape and the cardiac cycle length (RR interval) and the QT interval were measured every five seconds by a computer aided method. The RR-QT data from each test during the exercise phase were analysed by an exponential formula, QT = A - B x exp (-k x RR) and by Bazett's formula, QT = K x square root of (RR). Three reference QT intervals, QTc1, QTc2, and QTc3, estimated at RR = 400, 700, and 1000 ms respectively from the regression curves of both formulas were compared. The exponential formula, which consistently gave a better fit with the data, showed that propranolol had a biphasic action on the QT intervals during exercise. It significantly prolonged the mean (SD) interval at longer cycle lengths (from 287 (27) to 305 (18) ms at RR = 1000 ms and shortened it at shorter cycle lengths (from 198 (14) to 179 (16) ms at RR = 400 ms). In contrast, Bazett's formula did not show any significant effect when the same raw data were used. The exponential formula can be adapted to study other interventions or conditions that affect QT intervals.", 
    "21": "Regional left ventricular systolic pressure-thickness relations have been used to assess regional load-insensitive contractility with the assumption that they possess linear isochrones that are fundamental to the time-varying elastance model of global pressure-volume relations. We examined the shape and time-varying behavior of pressure-thickness isochrones in six open-chest canine preparations. Transmural wall thickening (sonomicrometry) and ventricular pressure were altered by abrupt preload alterations during control, dobutamine, and propranolol. In all dogs and interventions, linear isochrones (r2 mean +/- SE = 0.91 +/- 0.11) were found at 5-ms intervals. During control, linear isochrone slope rose monotonically from onset to end of systole. Thickness-axis intercepts also varied continuously in time, but peak intercept and maximal slope were asynchronous. Dobutamine caused a steeper earlier maximum slope and increased slope-intercept asynchrony. Propranolol reduced maximum slope and slope-intercept asynchrony. Isochronal data during early systole were better fitted to a parabolic than to the linear model; however, fits to linear and parabolic models were equally good near end of systole. Linear isochronal behavior exists in systolic pressure-thickness relations especially near end systole and is maintained during modest inotropic alterations.", 
    "22": "The administration of beta-blocking agents to patients with poor left ventricular (LV) function may result in clinical and hemodynamic deterioration. The beta antagonist pindolol has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) and therefore may be better tolerated. To test this hypothesis 30 patients with a precatheterization diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy were randomly assigned to three groups to receive intravenous injections of placebo, propranolol, or pindolol. The baseline ejection fraction and hemodynamics were similar for all groups. For propranolol 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg doses were given 5 minutes apart until a maximum dose of 10 mg was reached, until a 25% reduction in the heart rate or mean arterial pressure occurred, or until clinical deterioration developed. For pindolol, 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.3 mg, and 0.4 mg boluses were used with the same end points. Baseline hemodynamics were measured and repeated 15 minutes after the last dose of each drug was administered. The mean number of doses given was similar for both groups: 3.3 doses for the propranolol group and 3.4 for the pindolol group. Compared to propranolol, pindolol caused less of a reduction in heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume index, and stroke work index and less of an increase in the mean right atrial pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and pulmonary vascular resistance; there was a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. These differences were statistically significant for changes in heart rate, right atrial pressure, cardiac index, and systemic vascular resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "The actions of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, d,l-nadolol, were examined in anesthetized dogs subjected to circumflex coronary artery ligation in the presence of previous anterior myocardial infarction. With circumflex ligation, control dogs (N = 18) developed premature ventricular beats and ventricular tachycardia, followed by ventricular fibrillation (N = 16, 89%). Immediate arrhythmias (2 to 5 minutes) were accompanied by activation delays and continuous diastolic electrical activity in acutely ischemic epicardial tissue. Delayed arrhythmias (6 to 12 minutes) were accompanied by delayed activation and continuous diastolic electrical activity in acutely ischemic mid-myocardium. Nadolol (8 mg/kg, intravenously) (N = 10) reduced ventricular arrhythmias during both phases of arrhythmia development and increased survival (70%, p = 0.001 vs control). Nadolol failed to after activation in acutely ischemic epicardium, but prevented beat-to-beat changes in epicardial and mid-myocardial activation. Atrial pacing of nadolol-treated animals at heart rates comparable with those of the control group reversed the beneficial effects of nadolol on the development of ventricular arrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation (70%; p = 0.07 vs nadolol; p = 0.21 vs control, respectively). The beneficial effects of nadolol could not be attributed to reduced epicardial delays, but were associated with the suppression of beat-to-beat conduction abnormalities that preceded ventricular fibrillation.", 
    "24": "We prospectively evaluated 19 patients with prolonged chest pain not evolving to myocardial infarction and accompanied with reversible ST-T changes and tachycardia (heart rate greater than 100 beats/min) in order to correlate heart rate reduction with ischemic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes. Fourteen patients (74%) received previous long-term combined treatment with nifedipine and nitrates. Continuous ECG monitoring was carried out until heart rate reduction and at least one of the following occurred: (1) relief of pain or (2) resolution of ischemic ECG changes. the study protocol consisted of carotid massage in three patients (16%), intravenous propranolol in seven patients (37%), slow intravenous amiodarone infusion in two patients (10%), and intravenous verapamil in four patients (21%) with atrial fibrillation. In three patients (16%) we observed a spontaneous heart rate reduction on admission. Patients responded with heart rate reduction from a mean of 125 +/- 10.4 beats/min to 84 +/- 7.5 beats/min (p less than 0.005) and an ST segment shift of 4.3 +/- 2.13 mm to 0.89 +/- 0.74 mm (p less than 0.005) within a mean interval of 13.2 +/- 12.7 minutes. Fifteen (79%) had complete response and the other four (21%) had partial relief of pain. A significant direct correlation was observed for heart rate reduction and ST segment deviation (depression or elevation) (r = 0.7527 and 0.8739, respectively). These patients represent a unique subgroup of unstable angina, in which the mechanism responsible for ischemia is excessive increase in heart rate. Conventional vasodilator therapy may be deleterious, and heart rate reduction in mandatory.",

Anti-LKM1 titers follow the severity of the disease and the presence of these antibodies serves as a diagnostic marker for this autoimmune hepatitis type II. We demonstrate that anti-LKM1 IgGs specifically inhibit the hydroxylation of bufuralol in human liver microsomes. Using two assay systems with different selectivity for the two cytochrome P-450 isozymes catalyzing bufuralol metabolism in human liver, we show that anti-LKM1 exclusively recognizes cytochrome P-450db1. Immunopurification of the LKM1 antigen from solubilized human liver microsomes resulted in an electrophoretically homogenous protein that had the same molecular mass (50 kDa) as purified P-450db1 and an identical N-terminal amino acid sequence. Recognition of both purified P-450db1 and the immunoisolated protein on western blots by several monoclonal antibodies confirmed the identity of the LKM1 antigen with cytochrome P-450db1. Cytochrome P-450db1 has been identified as the target of a common genetic polymorphism of drug oxidation. However, the relationship between the polymorphic cytochrome P-450db1 and the appearance of anti-LKM1 autoantibodies as well as their role in the pathogenesis of chronic active hepatitis remains speculative.", 
    "27": "Acetylcholine increases ventricular automaticity in neonatal but not adult canine Purkinje fibers. In this study, we used a rat model to investigate the mechanism for the increased automaticity, and used surface electrodes to record spontaneous rates from the ventricular septa of three different age groups: 1 to 2 days old (neonates), 6 to 9 days old (1 week old) and adults. Acetylcholine, 10(-12) and 10(-11) M, induced a significant increase in automaticity from a control of 103 +/- 6.5 beats per min to 117 +/- 9.0 and 118 +/- 10.8 beats per min, respectively, in the neonates (P less than .05). The increase was attenuated by atropine, 2 x 10(-6) M (P = .05), and eliminated by propranolol, 2 x 10(-7) M, or hexamethonium, 5 x 10(-6) M (P less than .05). In 1-week-old rats, acetylcholine, 10(-12) M, induced a lesser increase in automaticity from a control of 106 +/- 13.0 to 113 +/- 14.0 beats per min (P less than .05). The increase was blocked by atropine, 2 x 10(-6) M, propranolol, 2 x 10(-7) M, and by hexamethonium, 5 x 10(-6) M (all P less than .05). In adults, acetylcholine did not increase automaticity. Among the neonatal septa, 82% showed increased automaticity with acetylcholine alone, 78% showed increased automaticity in the presence of atropine and 13% showed increased automaticity in the presence of either propranolol or hexamethonium, suggesting a largely nicotinic mediated and catecholamine dependent component. In 1-week-old septa, 75% showed increased automaticity with acetylcholine alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "The effects is of the optical isomers of pimobendan (UD-CG 115 BS), an inotropic agent, were studied on the electrical and mechanical activity of intact and detergent-skinned preparations of cardiac muscle from guinea pig and dog. Racemic pimobendan has been shown to increase contractile force and to potentiate slow action potentials (AP) induced by stimulation of papillary muscle partially depolarized with 25 mM [K]o. These effects are shown in this study to be mainly due to the l-optical isomer of pimobendan. When slow APs were maximally stimulated by 1 microM isoproterenol, addition of either the d- or l-isomer of pimobendan did not affect the slow AP parameters. However, under these conditions, contractile force was significantly increased to 124% of control by the d-isomer and to 184% of control by the l-isomer. These results suggest that pimobendan may have direct effects on the myofilaments and that these effects are dependent on the optical isomer of the compound. To test this directly, the effects of d- and l-pimobendan were compared on Ca++-activated force developed by detergent-skinned heart muscle fibers. Submaximal force developed at constant Ca++ was increased by both optical isomers, but the l-isomer had a significantly greater Ca++-sensitizing effect. For example at pCa 6.75 force was 270% of control in the presence of the d-isomer and 400% of control in the presence of the l-isomer. At pCa 5, there was no effect of either isomer on force developed by the skinned fiber preparations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "The renal hemodynamic response to renal arterial infusions of terbutaline and forskolin were compared in chronically instrumented fetal (129-139 days gestation; term 145 days), newborn (7-14 days old) and nonpregnant adult sheep. Infusions of terbutaline produced renal vasodilation in all age groups with maximal increases being higher in fetal (47 +/- 7%) than in newborn (30 +/- 8%) or adult sheep (24 +/- 5%). Terbutaline-mediated renal vasodilation was inhibited by the selective beta 2 adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551, whereas infusion of selective beta 1 adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 89,406, had no effect. Moreover, terbutaline effects were unchanged after phentolamine infusion to inhibit potential antagonistic effects of neuronal norepinephrine release by presynaptic beta 2 adrenoceptor stimulation. Renal arterial infusion of forskolin produced renal vasodilation of similar magnitude in all age groups, with maximal increases of 46 +/- 5, 38 +/- 3 and 38 +/- 5% in fetal, newborn and adult sheep, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that renal vasodilatory mechanisms stimulated by selective activation of beta 2 adrenoceptors (terbutaline) are greater during fetal life. However, direct activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin produces essentially similar renal vasodilatory responses during development in sheep. Thus, reasons to explain age-dependent differences in renal vasodilation observed previously with endogenous catecholamines may be at the receptor-hormone level.", 
    "30": "We investigated the lipolytic effect of several hormones on isolated human adipocytes obtained at different donor ages. In neonates, noradrenaline and adrenaline had an insignificant lipolytic effect (70% over basal). In this age group only thyrotropin (TSH) had a significant effect in physiological concentrations, and the maximal lipolytic effect (700% over basal) was the same as that of isoprenaline. The lipolytic effect of TSH was the same in premature 4-10-wk-old infants with a gestational age of 27-33 wk as in neonates, but fat cells from infants 4-10 wk old, born at term, showed a significantly lower effect. In children and adults, the lipolytic effect of TSH gradually decreased further and was present only in unphysiological concentrations. The catecholamine-induced lipolysis was pronounced and was similar in children and adults (350% over basal). TSH is the dominating lipolytic hormone in vitro during the neonatal period. Thus, the peak elevation of circulating TSH, which is seen immediately after birth, may be essential to lipolysis during this part of life.", 
    "31": "Arginine vasopressin is elevated in congestive heart failure. To determine the effect of arginine vasopressin upon systemic hemodynamics and regional blood flows, we administered the specific inhibitor of the vascular action of vasopressin [1-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid),2-(O-methyl)-tyrosine]-arginine vasopressin [d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP] to 15 dogs with chronic right-heart failure produced by tricuspid avulsion and progressive pulmonary artery constriction. The animals exhibited increased plasma arginine vasopressin and norepinephrine levels. Vasopressin inhibition increased cardiac output and left ventricular dP/dt and dP/dt/P, and it decreased total peripheral vascular resistance, whereas mean aortic pressure did not change significantly. Simultaneously, blood flow increased to skeletal muscle, kidneys, skin, and right and left ventricular myocardium. Plasma catecholamines also increased. Pretreatment with propranolol and prazosin abolished the increases in cardiac output and left ventricular function produced by vasopressin inhibition. Pretreatment also led to a decrease in mean aortic pressure after vasopressor inhibition. In contrast, administration of d(CH)2)5Tyr(Me)AVP to 11 sham-operated animals or administration of normal saline to nine sham-operated and eight heart-failure dogs was without effect either in the absence or in the presence of adrenergic receptor blockade. Thus, arginine vasopressin participates in the control of the circulation in right-sided congestive heart failure, with both a direct constrictor action on blood vessels and an indirect action by inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system.",

Using a B-A-B (off-on-off) medication design in a clinical setting, the children were treated with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Scores on an inventory of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder indicated that patients exhibited significantly fewer symptoms while receiving medication than either before or after they received medication.", 
    "33": "The effectiveness of nifedipine versus propranolol monotherapy in the treatment of unstable angina in the elderly was evaluated in 26 patients over age 65 years. The study utilized a randomized, parallel design with double-blind primary outcome measurements. Subjects (mean, 76 +/- 2 years) were allocated to nifedipine (n = 12) 10, 20 and 30 mg tid or propranolol (n = 14) 20, 40 and 80 mg tid with the dose increased at 24 to 72 h intervals if tolerated. Maintenance therapy was continued for three months. Unstable angina or myocardial infarction occurred in seven of 12 nifedipine patients versus two of 14 patients on propranolol (P = 0.025). The drugs were similar with respect to daily nitroglycerin use, treadmill walking time and left ventricular ejection fraction. Drug intolerance occurred in two patients on nifedipine and four on propranolol. Propranolol, if tolerated, appears to be more effective than nifedipine in preventing recurrent unstable angina or myocardial infarction in elderly patients.", 
    "34": "Experiments were designed to determine the role of products of cyclooxygenase in contractions of coronary smooth muscle evoked by serotonin. Rings of canine coronary artery without endothelium were suspended in organ chambers filled with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution. Serotonin caused concentration-dependent contractions followed by secondary relaxations at higher doses. Indomethacin and meclofenamate augmented both the contraction and the relaxation. Indomethacin did not affect contractions evoked by increasing concentrations of either phenylephrine, prostaglandin F2 alpha, or potassium chloride. Propranolol did not affect the concentration-response curve to serotonin under control conditions; it prevented the facilitated contraction to the monoamine but not the augmented secondary relaxation caused by the inhibitors of cyclooxygenase. These results suggest that endogenous prostanoids simultaneously inhibit the contractile process and brake relaxations induced by higher concentrations of serotonin. As a consequence, inhibitors of prostanoid formation facilitate the vasospastic component of the response to the monoamine in large coronary arteries. For unknown reasons, propranolol prevents this facilitation.", 
    "35": "We used transesophageal real-time two-dimensional Doppler echography (TE2DD) to assess the effects of propranolol (n = 18, 6 mg each) and nitroglycerin (n = 18, 0.5 mg each) on blood flow in the intercostal veins, azygos vein, thoracic aorta, and esophagogastric varices. The primary disease in all of the patients was liver cirrhosis. Propranolol infusion markedly reduced the flow velocity in the varices, intercostal vein, azygos vein, and thoracic aorta (-24%, -41%, -34%, and -24%, respectively). It also significantly reduced the blood flow volume index (BFVI), defined as mean velocity in cm/sec X the square of the diameter in cm2 of both the azygos vein and the aorta (-34%, -21%, respectively). Nitroglycerin infusion did not cause significant changes in the hemodynamics of the above vessels, because the hemodynamic responses to the drug differed from individual to individual. The BFVI of the azygos vein correlated well with the azygos venous flow measured by the conventional thermodilution technique (r = 0.79, p less than 0.01). TE2DD appears to be a useful method for studying the hemodynamics of ascending collaterals in patients with portal hypertension.", 
    "36": "The participation of a noradrenergic mechanism in the facilitation of lordosis by luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) was studied in two groups of ovariectomized estrogen primed rats, with or without sexual experience. The administration of 5 micrograms estradiol benzoate (EB) alone to sexually inexperienced subjects (Ss) induced weak lordosis behavior in some of them (mean lordosis quotient, LQ = 12 +/- 19). The SC injection of 5 micrograms LHRH significantly increased this response four hours later (LQ = 38 +/- 41), though great variability was observed (59% of Ss showing LQs below 30). The systemic administration of either prazosin, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist (0.2 or 1 mg/kg), or propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist (20 mg/kg), totally suppressed LHRH-induced lordosis in sexually inexperienced Ss (mean LQs = 8 +/- 11; 5 +/- 10; 18 +/- 31, respectively). In sexually experienced Ss (tested on two previous occasions with EB and LHRH) the administration of EB alone on a third test induced significant levels of lordosis (mean LQ = 51 +/- 41). The administration of 5 micrograms LHRH to sexually experienced, estrogen primed Ss induced near maximal levels of lordosis (LQ = 94 +/- 18). In these Ss, prazosin (0.2 and 1 mg/kg) and, to a lesser extent, propranolol (20 mg/kg) significantly depressed lordosis to values that were not significantly different from those obtained after EB alone (mean LQs = 59 +/- 38; 63 +/- 20; 74 +/- 32, respectively). These results indicate that blockade of noradrenergic transmission by either alpha- or beta-antagonists counteracts the stimulatory effect of LHRH on lordosis in ovariectomized estrogen primed rats with or without sexual experience.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "The effect of dopamine was studied on the isolated uterus of diethylstilboestrol-treated rats. Dopamine, at concentrations (10(7)-10(-4) M) produced a concentration-dependent relaxation in the K+-depolarized rat uterus. On a molar basis, dopamine was about 500 times less potent than adrenaline in relaxing the uterus, the maximum degree of relaxation obtained with both drugs was the same. Pretreatment of the rats with reserpine (5 mg/kg) did not produce any modification of the dose-response curve to dopamine. Similarly, cocaine (3 x 10(-6) M) failed to modify the relaxant effect of dopamine. The dopamine induced relaxation was inhibited by propranolol (10(-9)-10(-7) M) in a dose-dependent manner. Prazosin (10(-7) M), SCH 23390 (10(-7) M) and sulpiride (10(-7) M) did not affect the dopamine dose-response curve. In the isolated rat uterus which was not preconstricted by KCl neither dopamine nor adrenaline produced any effect when added to the organ bath. This lack of response to both catecholamines was present even in tissues pretreated with propranolol or sulpiride. It is concluded that dopamine produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of the uterus from diethylstilboestrol-treated rats by direct activation of beta-adrenoceptors. There was no evidence for indirect action (catecholamine release and neuronal uptake mechanisms) and specific dopamine receptor mediated relaxation and alpha-adrenoceptor mediated contractions have not been found in this preparation.",

Standard recommended doses of both drugs (labetalol 200-400 mg twice daily, nifedipine 10-20 mg three times daily) were used. Angina frequency was similar during the placebo washout period and treatment with the two drugs. The duration of treadmill exercise to angina, ischaemia (greater than 1 mm ST segment depression), and end of exercise was increased by both labetalol and nifedipine when compared with placebo, but there was no difference between the two drugs. Ambulatory ST segment monitoring demonstrated that the frequency, duration and magnitude of ST segment depression, whether painful or silent, were unaffected by either drug. Labetalol is an effective agent in improving exercise tolerance in normotensive patients with stable exertional angina pectoris, with an efficacy similar to that of nifedipine.",

The assessment of the quality of life was realized with 4 scales completed by the practitioner [anxiety, depression, well-being, visual analog scale (VAS)] and 4 scales of auto-assessment completed by the patient [2 VAS, well-being, sub-scale of pleasure]. At the end of the first treatment's period (D28), both drugs had decreased significantly supine SBP and DBP (p less than 0.001), standing DBP (L = p less than 0.01; C = p less than 0.05), while only L lowered supine SBP (p less than 0.01). The cross-over analysis was unable to conclude, due to the number of patients and a significant interaction which reduced its power. Thus the effect of the first treatment's period seemed to influence the efficacy of the second one. The percentages of patients with a controlled BP were respectively: after 4 weeks of treatment, L = 61 p. 100 vs C = 42 p. 100 and at the end of study (D56), L = 67 p. 100 vs C = 64 p. 100.

    "40": "Captopril is an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and has been widely studied in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, severe hypertension not responsive to conventional diuretic/beta-adrenoceptor blocker/vasodilator regimens, and patients with chronic congestive heart failure refractory to treatment with a diuretic and digitalis. In patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension, titrated low doses of captopril used alone or in conjunction with a diuretic are similar in efficacy to usual doses of hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, or beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, as well as to the other ACE inhibitors. In addition, captopril improved well-being to a greater extent than methyldopa or propranolol in a study designed specifically to determine the effect of treatment on the quality of life of patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension. The earlier demonstrated efficacy of captopril, used with a diuretic and often also with a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, in the treatment of severe hypertension refractory to conventional 'triple therapy' has been confirmed in more recent trials which illustrate the generally marked antihypertensive effect of captopril-containing regimens in such patients. Results of initial trials in patients with scleroderma are promising, with control of hypertension and stabilization of renal function in these patients when treated at an early stage of the disease. Several comparative and long term trials of captopril in patients with chronic congestive heart failure refractory to treatment with a diuretic/digitalis regimen clearly demonstrate that initial haemodynamic improvement is maintained and correlates with clinical benefit. A tendency for overall clinical response to captopril to be better than the response to prazosin, hydralazine, nisoldipine or enalapril has been reported. Results of a multicentre comparison with digoxin and placebo indicate that captopril is a suitable alternative to digoxin in patients with mild to moderate heart failure who are receiving maintenance diuretic therapy. The tolerability of captopril has now been studied in many thousands of patients involved in formalized trials and the early impression of poor tolerability can no longer be justified. The use of generally lower dosages of captopril in patients with normal or slightly impaired renal function has resulted in a generally low incidence of rash (0.5 to 4%), dysgeusia (0.1 to 3%), proteinuria (0.5%), neutropenia (0.3% during first 3 months) and symptomatic hypotension (0.1 to 3%).

Patients with a concomitant intraoperative mean arterial pressure increase of more than 30% or with an intraoperative wedge pressure higher than 15 mmHg (2.0 kPa) were excluded. After application of alinidine and metoprolol, heart rate decreased significantly (P less than 0.01) in the alinidine group from 88 +/- 19 beats per min to 72 +/- 13 and in the metoprolol group from 82 +/- 16 to 72 +/- 12.

The two drugs presented a similar anti-hypertensive effect which attained its peak expression in the second week of treatment. As for side-effects, penbutolol during treatment presented better tolerance than atenolol.

    "43": "The role of drug combinations for the treatment of patients with ventricular arrhythmias is reviewed. The use of single drugs to suppress ventricular arrhythmias is often unsatisfactory; a drug may be ineffective or cause intolerable adverse effects. Simultaneous use of antiarrhythmic agents with different but compatible electrophysiologic effects may control arrhythmias refractory to single-drug therapy. Patients may tolerate combination therapy fairly well because dosages in combination therapy are often lower than those employed when either drug is used alone. Although comparison of drug trials is hampered by nonuniformity among study protocols, the data suggest that drug combinations can be effective in treating some patients. Pairs of drugs showing the most promise have been a class IA drug (procainamide, quinidine, or disopyramide) with a class IB drug (usually mexiletine), and a class IA drug with a beta blocker. Amiodarone should be combined with a class I drug only as a last resort. There is little evidence to support the simultaneous use of two class IA drugs. Selection of a drug combination should be guided by consideration of the patient's medical history, concurrent disease states, and risk of sudden cardiac death. The efficacy of combination therapy should be evaluated by electrophysiologic testing or ambulatory electrocardiography. Combination antiarrhythmic therapy should be reserved for patients in whom single-drug therapy has been ineffective or poorly tolerated. More studies are needed to further define the efficacy, safety, and role of drug combinations in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "44": "Accurate assessment of ascending aortic blood velocity indices and reproducibility of a Doppler ultrasonic system during exercise were determined; the Doppler technique was then used to assess the effects of age, sex, and beta blockade on exercise hemodynamics. Doppler-determined velocity correlated well with an invasive electromagnetic system. Reproducibility of Doppler variables during three exercise tests was high (coefficient of variation less than 10%) and did not deteriorate appreciably with exercise. Peak velocity (PV) and maximum acceleration (MA) were inversely related to age, the relationship being more significant during exercise, whereas the systolic velocity integral showed no such relationship either at rest or during exercise. Doppler variables showed no difference between sexes, except at high levels of exercise. Beta blockade markedly attenuated the exercise response as shown by significant decreases in both MA and PV during exercise. The Doppler velocity data presented in this study provide a reference against which previously documented changes in exercising ischemic patients can be better related.",

The study, which lasted seven weeks, began with a single-blind two-week placebo lead-in period, followed by a four-week double-blind treatment phase, and concluded with a one-week single-blind placebo washout period. Of 24 patients included in the analysis of efficacy, seven received one Tenoretic 50 tablet per day (atenolol, 50 mg; chlorthalidone, 25 mg), nine received one Tenoretic 100 tablet per day (atenolol, 100 mg; chlorthalidone, 25 mg), and eight received placebo.

Reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the active treatment groups were significantly greater than the pressure reductions in the group receiving placebo (P less than .05 to .1). The combination of atenolol and chlorthalidone was well tolerated, and in no case was treatment discontinued because of side effects. This study showed that one tablet per day of either Tenoretic 50 or Tenoretic 100 is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "46": "Prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) is known to stimulate ventricular C fiber receptors resulting in a Bezold-Jarisch-like reflex. Also, cardiac receptor stimulation is known to interact with the expression of arterial baroreflexes. Therefore, experiments were performed to determine the effects of left circumflex coronary artery infusion of PGI2 on the baroreflex control of heart rate in conscious instrumented dogs. Dogs were instrumented chronically with an aortic catheter for the measurement of mean aortic pressure, hydraulic occluder cuffs on the descending aorta and inferior vena cava, a left ventricular catheter for the measurement of left ventricular pressure and heart rate, and a nonocclusive catheter in the left circumflex coronary artery. At the time of experimentation, arterial pressure was altered randomly in steps by partially inflating the occluders. Mean arterial pressure-heart curves (baroreflex curves) were constructed by fitting the data to a logistic curve by nonlinear regression. PGI2 infused into the left circumflex coronary artery at doses of 10, 20, and 50 ng/kg/min caused significant (p less than 0.05) inhibition of the maximum heart rate, heart rate range, and maximum slope of the curve compared to the control baroreflex curve obtained during intracoronary infusion of PGI2 vehicle. PGI2 had no significant effect on the minimum heart rate during hypertension. Since PGI2 is known to stimulate left ventricular receptors, these effects were most likely produced via stimulation of cardiac receptors. In additional experiments using beta 1-blockade with metoprolol or cholinergic blockade with atropine methyl bromide, it was shown that PGI2 attenuates baroreflex-mediated tachycardia by preventing parasympathetic withdrawal completely and by attenuating sympathetic stimulation by approximately 50%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The pharmacokinetics, hormonal and haemodynamic responses at rest and during challenges with angiotensin I (blood pressure), isoprenaline (heart rate), and noradrenaline (blood pressure) were investigated in six healthy male volunteers following a 1 week treatment with placebo, propranolol (120 mg day-1), cilazapril (2, 5 mg day-1), and a combination of both in a double-blind cross-over design. 2. Both drugs reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by about 7 mm Hg as compared with placebo. After coadministration, this drop in blood pressure was doubled and lasted longer than after the administration of the individual components. 3. Following cilazapril, a pronounced increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) was found (factor approximately 10 at drug peak concentrations). Coadministration of both drugs resulted only in a moderate increase in the PRA (factor approximately 3). Significant changes in plasma catecholamines were not observed. 4. Propranolol shifted the isoprenaline dose-effect curve to the right, and cilazapril that of angiotensin I, irrespective of the presence of the other drug. Cilazapril tended to shift the noradrenaline dose-effect curve somewhat to the right. 5. The gain of the baroreceptor reflex (angiotensin-stimulation) was not influenced by cilazapril but was lowered by propranolol, irrespective of the presence of the ACE inhibitor. 6.

Left ventricular function was assessed by serial radionuclide ventriculography. Radionuclide ventriculography was performed at rest and during cold pressor test. Both drugs improved symptoms of angina pectoris by at least one division of the New York Heart Association classification. Cold pressor testing caused increases in heart rate and blood pressure in both groups throughout the study. At rest, pretreatment ejection fraction was similar in both groups. During propranolol treatment this rose sequentially from 49% to 55% at 26 weeks. No change in the resting ejection fraction occurred in those taking pindolol. The difference in response between the groups reached significance at 26 weeks. In those with subnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (less than 50%), resting ejection fraction improved significantly throughout treatment with propranolol rising from a basal value of 39% to 51% at 26 weeks. In comparison, pindolol caused no significant change.

During ischemia: intracellular acidosis, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) degradation, and inorganic phosphate (Pi) accumulation were found to be reduced whether the perfusion fluid contained: acebutolol 2.7 x 10(-5) M, atenolol 10(-5) M, d-propranolol 10(-5) M, or dl-propranolol 10(-5) M. On reperfusion metabolic and functional variables were variously affected by the different drugs, except the Pi level which was, in all series, significantly lower compared with control hearts. The adenylate charge and the glycogen stores were protected in the acebutolol, dl-propranolol, and d-propranolol groups. The ATP level was higher than in controls only in the acebutolol and atenolol groups. The intracellular pH recovered to values nonsignificantly different from preischemic values in the acebutolol and dl-propranolol-treated hearts only. The mechanical performance, expressed as the rate-pressure product, was unaltered by the ischemia-reperfusion sequence in the acebutolol and d-propranolol series, while decreasing significantly in controls and in the atenolol group. In dl-propranolol-treated hearts the mechanical activity, which in normoxic conditions was already halved during the effect of the drug, remained at this same level after ischemia. From these observations, it appears that the nonspecific properties of the drugs, as distinct from beta-blockade, play an important part in attenuating the ischemia-induced alteration in myocardial metabolism. Thus, it can be postulated that (1) the metabolic effects of dl-propranolol probably result largely from the reduction of heart work induced by this drug; (2) the maintenance of energy metabolism associated with the preservation of the myocardial activity, as observed in the case of acebutolol and d-propranolol, is possibly a consequence of the existence of a membrane-stabilizing activity.", 
    "50": "The changes in spinal cord micro-circulation were investigated after administering alpha- and beta-blockers to rabbits with acute spinal cord injury. Immediately after the 8th thoracic spinal cord was injured by applying pressure with a weight (50 g) for 1 minute, an alpha or beta-blocker was injected into the subarachnoid space of the injured region of the spinal cord. Spinal cord edema, blood flow, vascular permeability, and the mean arterial pressure were compared between the groups treated with each agent and the control group. One hour after the injury, the water content of the spinal cord was significantly lower in the phenoxybenzamine-treated group than in the control group. After 6 hours, however, no significant difference was observed between these two groups. The spinal cord blood flow was higher in the phenoxybenzamine-treated group than in the control group until 6 hours after the injury. These results suggest involvement of norepinephrine in the formation of edema at the early stage of spinal cord injury.", 
    "51": "Rats were pithed, vagotomized and adrenalectomized and the effect of procaterol on the pressor response to electrical stimulation of the thoracolumbar preganglionic sympathetic outflow from the spinal cord or to exogenous noradrenaline was studied in the absence and presence of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and drugs interfering with the renin-angiotensin system. 1. Basal diastolic blood pressure was decreased by captopril, ramiprilate (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors), saralasin (an angiotensin II receptor antagonist), pepstatin A (a protease inhibitor with renin antagonistic properties) and by functional nephrectomy (ligation of both renal hili), but was not affected by procaterol (a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist), nebivolol (a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist) and ICI 118,551 (erythro-dl-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylaminobut an-2-ol; a beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist). 2. The vasopressor response induced by electrical stimulation of the preganglionic sympathetic nerve fibres was increased by procaterol, whereas the increase in blood pressure evoked by exogenous noradrenaline was not affected. The pressor response to both electrical stimulation and exogenous noradrenaline was decreased by captopril, ramiprilate, saralasin and nephrectomy but was not affected by nebivolol and ICI 118,551. 3. The facilitatory effect of procaterol on the neurogenic, electrically induced pressor response, which was also obtained when basal blood pressure was decreased by nephrectomy and increased by Lys8-vasopressin, was abolished by ICI 118,551 but not affected by nebivolol. Under none of these experimental conditions did procaterol alter the vasopressor response to exogenous noradrenaline. 4. The facilitatory effect of procaterol on the neurogenic, electrically induced rise in blood pressure was abolished by captopril, ramiprilate, saralasin and pepstatin A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "The KCl-contracted rat aorta is relaxed by labetalol, dilevalol, amosulalol and KF-4317. These relaxations are not reversed by ICI 118,551 at 10(-6) M and, therefore, are not due to beta-adrenoceptor agonism. At 10(-7) M, labetalol, dilevalol, amosulalol and KF-4317 were beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists as they inhibited the relaxant responses of rat aorta to procaterol.", 
    "53": "Recent studies indicate that selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists may be of use in the treatment of glaucoma. ICI 118,551, its desmethyl-, didesmethyl-, and ethyl- analogues, and a putative highly beta 2-selective binary aryloxypropanolamine (4d) have been evaluated for their ability to inhibit beta-adrenergic-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in rabbit ciliary process and heart. Potency ratios (Ki heart/Ki ciliary process) were 440 for ICI 118,551; 9.3 for the desmethyl analogue; 8.2 for the didesmethyl analogue; 720 for the ethyl analogue; and 11 for the binary aryloxypropanolamine. The values for the ethyl derivative of ICI 118,551 indicate that it is the most oculoselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist yet reported.", 
    "54": "The safety and efficacy of ketanserin, a competitive serotonin blocking agent, and propranolol were compared in 33 patients with mild to moderate hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 95-115 mm Hg) using a placebo run-in, randomized, double-blind parallel study design. All patients received placebo for 4 weeks, then were randomized to receive increasing doses of either ketanserin (20, 40 mg twice daily) or propranolol (40, 80 mg twice daily) to achieve a goal sitting DBP less than 90 mm Hg. Patients not achieving the goal blood pressure with either drug as monotherapy, received the other drug in combination. At the end of the active monotherapy phase (week 10 of the study), propranolol demonstrated a greater decrease in DBP from baseline, as compared to ketanserin (-7.9 +/- 10.9 mm Hg with propranolol, P less than 0.05; -1.0 +/- 7.2 mm Hg with ketanserin, P = NS). Four out of 16 patients achieved goal response on propranolol, compared to 3/17 for ketanserin. With combination treatment, 9/18 patients reached the goal response; the addition of propranolol to ketanserin in non-responders resulted in further reduction of sitting DBP of -10.3 +/- 6.3 compared to monotherapy (P less than 0.001), while the addition of ketanserin to non-responders produced no significant response in sitting DBP. Propranolol showed a consistent effect in slowing heart rate. Ketanserin displayed less frequent side effects than propranolol. Propranolol used twice daily appears to be more effective than twice daily ketanserin use in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "55": "The effects of the beta-adrenergic agents isoprenaline, terbutaline, l,d-propranolol, acebutolol, as well as d-propranolol, on the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in cortex and thalamus and arterial blood pressure (ABP) were investigated following i.v. administration. The experiments were performed in 64 cats anaesthetized with ether and chloralose. The rCBF was measured using the thermistor thermoclearance technique. Isoprenaline, as well as terbutaline (1, 3, 5 micrograms/kg) decreased the cortical rCBF and the ABP (p less than .05). Both adrenergic agonists increased the thalamic rCBF despite the decrease in ABP (p less than .05). L,d-propranolol (1 mg/kg) abolished the effects of isoprenaline and terbutaline on thalamic rCBF. Acebutolol (0.6 mg/kg) or d-propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) did not alter isoprenaline- and terbutaline-induced effects on rCBF in thalamus. L,d-propranolol decreased the thalamic rCBF, whereas d-propranolol increased the rCBF in thalamus (p less than .05). Acebutolol did not change the thalamic rCBF significantly. The results obtained indicate that beta-adrenergic agents have heterogeneous effects on rCBF in cortex and thalamus. Their effects on thalamic rCBF seem to be accomplished by beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "56": "The haemodynamic impact of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade (labetalol) was compared with that of slow-calcium channel blockade (nifedipine) in 32 patients with sustained elevation of systemic arterial pressure (systolic blood pressure greater than 160; diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mmHg) following a recent myocardial infarction (6-22 h). Patients with normal (pulmonary artery occluded pressure; (PAOP less than 18 mmHg; n = 16) or impaired (PAOP greater than 18 mmHg; n = 16) left ventricular function were randomized to labetalol (1 mg/kg i.v. 15 min) or nifedipine (20 mg sublingually) and haemodynamic profile was measured over 2 h. Both drugs equally reduced mean systemic arterial pressure (P less than 0.01 versus pretreatment control), and presumably left ventricular afterload; however, the heart rate (P less than 0.01) and cardiac index (P less than 0.01) increased after nifedipine, contrasting with reductions in both variables following labetalol (P less than 0.01). The elevated left ventricular filling pressure was reduced by both labetalol (P less than 0.05) and nifedipine (P less than 0.01) but the reduction was greater following nifedipine (-2 mmHg versus -5 mmHg, P less than 0.05). Thus both compounds were equally effective hypotensive agents. Labetalol consistently reduced cardiac stroke work and double product, important determinants of myocardial oxygen requirements; however, nifedipine afforded some improvement in cardiac performance in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "57": "Posterior hypophysis homogenates of female rats stimulated with epinephrine subcutaneously contain a pheromonal factor that increments significantly the incidence of fertile coitus after having been placed in the oronasal groove of rats in proestro (69.2% fertile coitus vs. 36.6% of control). These same homogenates obtained from spayed rats increment reproductive activity even more (80.0% fertile coitus). The homogenates do not act by an intraperitoneal route. Male rats under the effect of high doses of D,L-propranolol reduce reproductive activity (21.2% fertile coitus). This effect is counteracted by posterior hypophysis homogenates from female rats stimulated with epinephrine, placed in the oronasal groove (72.2% fertile coitus). The homogenates of anterior hypophysis do not increase the reproductive capacity of rats in proestro, and do not modify the propranolol effects in male rats.", 
    "58": "Left ventricular (LV) filling as assessed by Doppler transmitral flow velocity measurements was studied in 20 male patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and in 18 normal individuals. Stroke volume, blood pressure and heart rate in the two groups were not significantly different. Compared to normals, the ratio between early and atrial-induced peak velocities was significantly lower in the patients (1.2 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.40 +/- 0.3, P = 0.01), as was the fraction of transmitral filling during the first 1/3 of diastole (45 +/- 7% vs. 50 +/- 4%, P less than 0.001). Isovolumic relaxation time (IV R) was 96 +/- 13 ms in patients vs. 74 +/- 12 ms in normals (P less than 0.001). The CAD patients were treated with atenolol for 13-24 days. The velocity ratio increased by 30% (P less than 0.001) due to a 12% increase in early (P = 0.004) and an 11% decrease in atrial-induced peak velocities (P = 0.01). Filling fraction and deceleration rate of early inflow both increased by 22% (P less than 0.001). IV R decreased by 8% (P = 0.01). After atenolol treatment, heart rate and blood pressure decreased by 23% and 10% (P less than 0.001), respectively, whereas stroke volume increased by 14% (P less than 0.001). Thus, CAD was associated with Doppler indices of retarded LV filling and myocardial relaxation. After atenolol treatment, significant increases in velocity ratio and filling fraction indicated a shift of filling from late towards early diastole, suggesting improved diastolic function. However, different factors related to beta-adrenergic blockade may have contributed to the observed changes.", 
    "59": "A number of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs have been reported to induce a papulosquamous eruption which resembles psoriasis. We report distinctive clinical, histopathologic, immunocytochemical, and electron microscopic features in beta-blocker-induced psoriasiform eruptions that differentiate this syndrome from psoriasis. Preliminary data suggest that biopsy specimens from eruptions caused by beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocking agents (metoprolol and atenolol) were characterized by excessive degranulation of the neutrophils in the dermis, while the nonselective beta blockers (propranolol, nadolol, and sotalol) were marked by excessive release of proteolytic enzymes from macrophages, which are thought to possess beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Surprisingly, excessive release of enzymes by lymphocytes were noted in both the beta 1-selective and in the nonselective induced syndromes. It is believed that excessive lysosomal enzyme release by neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages is responsible for the presence of basal keratinocyte herniations, which have previously been shown to correlate with hyperproliferation and psoriasiform changes, as well as with the presence of excessive proteolytic enzymes in the skin. It is postulated that the beta-blocker-induced syndrome may result from enhanced proliferation, motility, and activity of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and cells of the macrophage-Langerhans cell series, stemming from depressed intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels caused by the beta blockade.", 
    "60": "The authors review recent progress in the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders. Most research within the last five years has focused on panic disorder; the findings include support for the usefulness of imipramine and clomipramine and probably other agents; evidence that the benzodiazepines alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, and clonazepam are approximately equally effective as antipanic agents; and high variability in relapse rates after discontinuation of drug treatment. Further work is required to determine whether buspirone and other forthcoming serotonin agonist drugs have a role in treating panic disorder and other anxiety disorders. For generalized anxiety disorder, scientific studies do not support the effectiveness of beta blocker; tricyclics may be potentially useful. Psychopharmacological treatments for social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder are also reviewed.", 
    "61": "Antihypertensive therapy is effective in elderly patients, at least in those under 80 years old. Stepped care may still serve as a therapeutic framework which is modified to fit the individual elderly patient, according to the risk: benefit ratio. However, there are no risk-free drugs and no antihypertensive agent is universally effective. The elderly are probably more sensitive than younger patients to the adverse effects of antihypertensive drugs, for various reasons, among which are age- and disease-related changes that can lead to altered pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. Multiple pathology and multiple drug therapy is likely to lead to an increased number of drug-drug and drug-disease interactions in the elderly. The elderly are probably most at risk from side effects that influence the cardiovascular and the central nervous system.", 
    "62": "The cellular mechanism by which the specific binding of [125I]insulin to intact rat adipocytes is inhibited by isoproterenol has been studied. By exposing control and isoproterenol-treated cells to trypsin (0-150 micrograms/ml for 20 min at 4 degrees C) and measuring the intact insulin receptor pool following detergent solubilization, a differential sensitivity to proteolysis of the cell membrane receptor was observed. At low trypsin concentration (less than 30 micrograms/ml), approximately 40% of the specific insulin binding in isoproterenol-treated cells was insensitive to proteolysis as compared to control cells. At higher levels of trypsin (50-150 micrograms/ml) both groups displayed similar levels of trypsin-insensitive receptors which, at the highest trypsin concentration, accounted for 10% of the total receptors in intact cells. Detergent-solubilized receptors from isoproterenol-treated cells, on the other hand, exhibited the same sensitivity to trypsin proteolysis as solubilized receptors from control cells. The time course of the onset and reversal of the isoproterenol-induced binding alteration in intact adipocytes has been analyzed by mild trypsinization (20 micrograms/ml). Results indicated that insulin receptors resistant to trypsin under these conditions mediated the decreased surface binding and were re-expressed on the cell surface upon removal of isoproterenol. Experiments in which adipocytes were fractionated into plasma membrane and Golgi-enriched fractions indicated that the loss of surface insulin binding was not accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of receptors in the adipocyte plasma membrane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Metipranolol is a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent used for the topical treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with chronic open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In double-blind comparative studies of up to 4 months duration, metipranolol 0.1 to 0.6% produced comparable reductions in intraocular pressure to timolol 0.25 to 0.5% and levobunolol 0.5%, lowering pressure by about 20 to 29% from baseline. Metipranolol has been well tolerated by most patients, producing only minor changes in objective measurements of ophthalmic status and systemic parameters. Similarly, subjective ophthalmic complaints have been minimal although reports of initial stinging or burning upon instillation have occurred. Further published reports, in which larger numbers of patients are treated over extended periods, are needed to confirm the drug's apparent long term comparative efficacy. Studies of ocular metipranolol to date are encouraging, and the drug demonstrates a lasting intraocular pressure reducing effect with good tolerability. Thus, ocular metipranolol provides a viable alternative to ocular timolol and levobunolol in the topical treatment of chronic open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.", 
    "64": "1. Experiments were done to characterize a putative adrenoceptor which functions to inhibit longitudinal muscle tension development in the guinea-pig ileum. Several phenylethylamine based agonists were investigated: BRL 37344, (-)-isoprenaline, (+)-isoprenaline, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and fenoterol. Propranolol and nadolol were tested as antagonists. Agonist-induced inhibition of the contractile response to histamine was measured under equilibrium conditions with alpha-adrenoceptors and muscarinic cholinoceptors inhibited. 2. Inhibitory responses were obtained to (-)-isoprenaline and BRL 37344 that were resistant to beta-adrenoceptor blockage with propranolol (5 microM) and nadolol (10 microM). These resistant responses were antagonized by much higher concentrations of nadolol (30 to 1000 microM) yielding apparent pA2 values for nadolol of 4.31 with (-)-isoprenaline as the agonist, and 4.68 with BRL 37344 as the agonist. Similar apparent pA2 values for nadolol at the putative adrenoceptor were obtained with noradrenaline (4.79), adrenaline (4.68), and fenoterol (4.38). 3. The order and relative potency of agonists at the putative adrenoceptor was: BRL 37344 (20) greater than (-)-isoprenaline (8) greater than noradrenaline (1) greater than adrenaline (0.5) greater than fenoterol (0.35) greater than (+)-isoprenaline (0.27). 4. The resistance to blockade by propranolol (5 microM), the low affinity of nadolol, and the order and relative potency of agonists, suggest the presence of an adrenoceptor with distinct pharmacological characteristics from currently defined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "65": "1. We investigated the hypothesis that the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, betaxolol, can be accumulated by cardiac sympathetic nerve endings and then released together with noradrenaline during accelerans nerve stimulation. 2. Dogs were chronically treated with betaxolol (1 mg kg-1 daily, s.c.) for 7 days. Twenty four hours after the last dose, there was a significant retention of betaxolol in the heart of these dogs treated chronically with the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist. However, during in vivo accelerans nerve stimulation, the concentration of betaxolol in the coronary sinus was not modified, whereas the noradrenaline concentration increased significantly. 3. Chronic betaxolol treatment antagonized the tachycardia induced by electrical stimulation of the cardiac accelerator nerves or by intravenous isoprenaline. However, the tachycardia induced by nerve stimulation was not antagonized to a greater extent than that induced by isoprenaline. 4. These findings are discussed in relation to a similar in vivo study in dogs treated with propranolol, in which the drug was found to be released into the coronary circulation during stimulation of the accelerans nerve.", 
    "66": "1. The antihypertensive efficacy of two different doses of the calcium antagonist felodipine was evaluated in patients with hypertension persisting despite beta-adrenoceptor blocker therapy. Following a single-blind placebo period of 4 weeks, patients were randomized to placebo (n = 36), felodipine 5 mg twice daily (n = 39) and felodipine 10 mg twice daily (n = 35) for another 4 weeks. beta-adrenoceptor blocker therapy remained unchanged throughout the study. 2. Effects on blood pressure (BP) were evaluated after the first dose and after chronic dosing at 2 h after dosing and the end of the dosing interval (12 h). 3. Felodipine decreased systolic and diastolic BP by 30-35/20-25 mm Hg at 2 h. These decreases were similar after acute and chronic treatment. Twelve hours after dosing, decreases of 15-20/10-15 mm Hg were observed compared to 10/5 mm Hg on placebo, and half of the patients still had a controlled BP (supine diastolic BP less than 90 mm Hg). BP responses were rather similar for both doses of felodipine at 2 and 12 h. 4. Multiple regression analysis showed that both initial BP level and plasma felodipine concentrations were significant predictors of the BP response to felodipine, but age was not. 5. Adverse effects attributed to felodipine were mainly related to vascular symptoms (primarily flushing and ankle swelling); these occurred in about 30% of patients, and were pronounced in three patients (4%). 6. Felodipine is therefore highly effective in lowering BP of hypertensive patients on chronic beta-adrenoceptor blocker therapy, with no evidence for a gradual lowering of the BP or for development of tolerance. Both initial BP level and plasma concentrations are better indicators of antihypertensive efficacy of this calcium antagonist than age.", 
    "67": "Although hypertension is regarded as a causal factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) a reduction in the risk of CHD as a result of lowering blood pressure in mild hypertension could not be demonstrated. This conclusion is based on an overview analysis of all published randomized trials in mild hypertension, including more than 25,000 subjects contributing over 125,000 person years of observation. There is evidence that treatment reduces the risk of CHD in moderate to severe hypertension. In addition the pooling of four clinical trials with treated control groups indicates a reduction in the risk of CHD of borderline significance with beta-blockers or aggressive treatment when compared with standard treatment (mostly diuretics). The failure of drug treatment to reduce the risk of CHD in mild hypertension is consistent with the results from epidemiological studies because of derangement of the lipid profile induced by diuretics and beta-blockers.", 
    "68": "beta-Adrenergic receptor blockers have been prescribed widely since their introduction 20 years ago. Noncardiac indications for beta-blockers have been expanded. Dermatologic manifestations of beta-blockers are reviewed in conjunction with their more liberal use. A retrospective analysis of our experience with beta-blockers in patients with psoriasis is presented. A 1-year study of 588 psoriatic patients who received treatment revealed that 26 patients were taking beta-blockers. Exacerbations of psoriasis were noted in 72.4% of these patients. beta-Blockers may worsen psoriasis and should be carefully evaluated in the management of these patients.", 
    "69": "Using a chronic maternal-fetal sheep preparation, the authors determined the transplacental passage and the hemodynamic changes consequent to maternal administration of esmolol. Fifteen experiments were performed in six chronically instrumented pregnant ewes near term. Each animal received esmolol iv, 500 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, for 4 min and then 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 6 min. Maternal and fetal blood esmolol concentrations (mean +/- SEM) were 1.2 +/- 0.28 and 0.1 +/- 0.03 micrograms/ml, respectively, at the completion of the infusion, and 0.03 +/- 0.01 microgram/ml in the mother and not detectable in the fetus 10 min after stopping the infusion. Despite the relatively low blood esmolol concentration in the fetus compared to the mother, the hemodynamic effects in the fetus were similar to those in the mother. The maximal decrease of maternal mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were 7 +/- 2 and 14 +/- 3% (mean +/- SEM), respectively (P less than .05). The maximal decrease of fetal MAP and HR were 7 +/- 2 and 12 +/- 3%, respectively (P less than .05). No changes were seen in maternal or fetal acid-base variables, and intra-amniotic pressure was not affected. The authors conclude that esmolol has a rapid but relatively small transplacental passage, and it is eliminated rapidly from both maternal and fetal plasma.", 
    "70": "Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade was used to investigate the role of catecholamines in endotoxin-induced elevations in glucose kinetics. Glucose kinetics were measured before and for 4 h after the injection of endotoxin [100 micrograms/100 g body wt iv, 30% lethal dose (LD30) at 24 h]. Adrenergic blockade was achieved by the bolus injection of phentolamine and propranolol followed by their continuous infusion. Endotoxin-treated rats exhibited a transient hyperglycemia and sustained (greater than 4 h) increase in plasma lactate concentration, as well as elevated rates of glucose appearance (Ra, 83%), disappearance (Rd, 58%), recycling (160%), and metabolic clearance (23%). Adrenergic blockade prevented endotoxin-induced increases in plasma glucose concentration, Ra, Rd, and recycling but not glucose clearance. The increase in plasma lactate concentration was blunted by 35%. After 2 h, endotoxic animals infused with adrenergic antagonists developed hypoglycemia, which may have resulted from an increased plasma insulin concentration. The attenuation of elevated glucose turnover by adrenergic blockade in the endotoxin-treated animals was not due to a reduction in plasma glucagon level or differences in plasma insulin concentration. Administration of the alpha- or beta-adrenergic antagonists separately blunted but did not prevent endotoxin-induced changes in glucose kinetics, and therefore the efficacy of the adrenergic blockade could not be assigned to a single receptor class. These results indicate that catecholamines are important contributory factors to many of the early alterations in carbohydrate metabolism observed during endotoxemia.",

The adverse experience safety data derived from 18 double-blind trials (n = 2884) were evaluated. The results demonstrated a wide margin of safety for celiprolol over the recommended dosage range of 200 to 600 mg once daily. Celiprolol exhibited an adverse experience profile similar to that of placebo and resulted in a lower incidence of bradycardia and age-associated increases in adverse event rates compared with atenolol and propranolol.", 
    "72": "Celiprolol is a third-generation, beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with ancillary pharmacologic properties that are potentially advantageous in the treatment of hypertension. Celiprolol provides 24-hour control of blood pressure and in formal clinical trials has been found superior to a placebo and of equal efficacy to other commonly used beta-blocking drugs. It has also been found to be equally as effective as enalapril in lowering the resting blood pressure and superior in controlling the increases in blood pressure and heart rate during exercise. Celiprolol is known to exert a beneficial effect on the atheroprotective components of the risk factors for coronary heart disease, such as cholesterol triglyceride, and fibrinogen. Therefore the primary attributes of beta-blockade are uniquely advanced by celiprolol's ancillary pharmacologic activities.",

The efficacy and safety of celiprolol in angina pectoris have been demonstrated in multiple studies that highlight its different hemodynamic properties compared with traditional beta-blockers. Celiprolol was found to be an effective antianginal agent compared with placebo. In addition, in angina and ischemia its efficacy was comparable to that of propranolol and atenolol.", 
    "74": "In a 12-month study of 12 patients with essential hypertension treated with once-daily celiprolol, 200 mg, mean supine blood pressure was reduced from 162/102 to 134/84 mm Hg (p less than 0.005)and standing pressures from 155/101 to 134/88 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Similarly, heart rate fell from 83 to 71 beats/min in the supine position and from 90 to 79 beats/min in the standing position. Serum cholesterol level also fell from 5.35 to 4.78 mmol/L (p less than 0.01) and was accompanied by a nonsignificant loss of body weight. Lipid electrophoresis showed a nonsignificant increase in the high-density lipid fraction, from 1.2 to 1.7 mmol/L, and a significant decrease in the low-density lipid fraction, from 3.4 to 2.7 mmol/L (p less than 0.01). Serum triglyceride levels also decreased from 1.85 to 1.37 mmol/L (p less than 0.02), and low-density lipid-high-density lipid ratio fell from 3.29 to 2.03 (p less than 0.02). There was an unexpected reduction in serum fibrinogen levels, from 288 to 253 mg/dl (p less than 0.01). Aside from a slight reduction in the fasting blood glucose, there were no other significant changes in the urine or blood parameters, and no adverse drug effects occurred. It is likely that celiprolol's effect in reducing fibrinogen levels may minimize the increase in blood viscosity associated with the hypertensive state, whereas its effects on fibrinogen may herald a reduction in hypertensive complications such as thrombosis or retinal \"cotton wool exudates.\" This warrants further investigation.\"", 
    "75": "The cardiovascular effects of celiprolol in healthy subjects and in those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are reviewed. Unlike classic beta-blockers, celiprolol does not depress cardiac contractility at rest while interfering to a lesser extent with cardiac function during exercise. Furthermore, celiprolol causes systemic vasodilatation, which, in hypertension, is mainly responsible for the blood pressure-reducing effects of the drug. Vasodilatation results from the reduction in vascular resistance of skeletal muscle tissues, but celiprolol also produces dilatation of vascular areas such as the kidney. This prevents a reduction in renal blood flow and consequently the salt and water retention associated with impaired perfusion. It is possible that such hemodynamic changes are dependent not on celiprolol's selective beta1-receptor-blocking properties but on certain additional properties."
