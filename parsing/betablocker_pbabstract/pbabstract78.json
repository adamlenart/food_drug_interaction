A few systemic diseases including metabolic and endocrine abnormalities, however, can also present with lower extremity paralysis. In such cases, an abnormal electrocardiogram can immediately point to a likely systemic etiology. In this report, we present 2 patients with a near carbon-copy presentation where previously healthy Hispanic men woke up in the morning not being able to get out of bed because of severe lower extremity weakness. In both cases, abnormal electrocardiograms on presentation pointed to the most likely diagnosis, which was quickly confirmed by simple laboratory testing. The appropriate evaluation and management of such patients are discussed.",

Eighty-three patients (20.4%) developed AKI: 47 (11.6%) with stage 1, 26 (6.4%) with stage 2 and 10 (2.5%) with stage 3. Mortality was 11.8% and was higher in patients with AKI (34.9% vs 5.9%, P < .0001). Univariate analysis disclosed age, reduced GFR at presentation, severe Killip class, heart rate and longer door-to-needle time as risk factors to develop AKI. Moreover, these patients received less \u03b2-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker in the ED. Multivariate analysis revealed that age, Killip class, heart rate, door-to-needle time, and \u03b2-blocker non-use were independent factors associated with AKI. These factors provided the ED physician with good accuracy in identifying patients at high risk of developing AKI.",

It is shown, that hormone has no effect on 2-cell embryos development, but it has enhanced viability of 4- and 8-cell mouse embryos. The number ofblastocyst formation increases in presence of 0.1 microM beta-endorphin in embryo cultured medium but the number of blastocyst with abnormal structure decreases. The effect of hormone on the change of intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ion in 2-, 4- and 8-cell mouse embryo has been studied with the help of fluorescent microscopy. The effect of adenylate cyclase, and phospholipase activity blockers and opioid blocker naloxone on the change of intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ion in early mouse embryo in the presence of beta-endorphin have been also studied. It is shown that 2-cell embryo has opioid and nonopioid beta-endorphin receptors, whereas 4- and 8-cell mouse embryos have only nonopoioid beta-endorphin receptors. It is also shown that the effect of beta-endorphin in the early mouse embryo through a nonopioid receptors occurs with the participation of intracellular Ca2+ and adenylate cyclase signaling system.",

West Virginia, due to its high obesity rates and lower socioeconomic status, is likely more heavily affected by these conditions. Prevention of episodic migraine goes well beyond the limited scope of medications and includes many areas which physicians need to be knowledgeable, including lifestyle modifications, trigger avoidance, and relaxation therapies. The prevention of progression of episodic headaches to chronic headaches includes a number of options, possibly most importantly the prevention of medication overuse from either over-the-counter or prescription medications. Despite limited evidence based pharmacologic options for the prevention of headaches, there are many safe and effective mechanisms in which physicians can help their patients limit the burden of migraine and prevent the progression toward chronic daily headache.",

All ethnicities can be affected, but TPP typically presents in men of Asian descent. The most common cause of TPP in thyrotoxicosis is Graves' disease. However, TPP can occur with any form of thyrotoxicosis. Up to our knowledge, very few cases ever reported the relationship between TPP and painless thyroiditis. We herein report a 25-yr-old Korean man who suffered from flaccid paralysis of the lower extremities and numbness of hands. The patient was subsequently diagnosed as having TPP associated with transient thyrotoxicosis due to painless thyroiditis. The paralytic attack did not recur after improving the thyroid function.

A rat model of thyrotoxicosis was established by daily intraperitoneal injections of L-thyroxine (T(4), 100 \u03bcg/kg) for 4 weeks. Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10 each): control group, T(4) group (T(4) alone), T(4) plus irbesartan group (T(4)-Irb, 30 mg/kg), and T(4) plus propranolol group (T(4)-Pro, 0.5mg/mL of drinking water). Cardiac chamber size and functional parameters were measured by echocardiography and cardiomyocyte diameter. Heart rate (HR) and cardiac fibrosis were determined. T(4) alone showed significantly increased HR and cardiomyocyte width (25.0 \u00b1 1.77 vs. 18.8 \u00b1 0.84 \u03bcm, P < 0.001) with fibrosis, reduced left ventricle (LV) longitudinal strain (S(long); -16.0 \u00b1 6.27 vs. -22.7 \u00b1 5.19 %, P < 0.001) compared with control. When compared with T(4) alone, T(4)-Irb showed significantly improved LV S(long) (-21.4 \u00b1 1.84 vs. -16.0 \u00b1 6.27 %, P =0.017) and reduced cardiomyocyte width (21.0 \u00b1 1.0 vs. 25.0 \u00b1 1.77 \u03bcm, P =0.002) with comparable HR (458.4 \u00b1 24.3 vs. 486.6 \u00b1 30.1 bpm, P = 0.086). However, T(4)-Pro showed significantly reduced HR with improved LV S(long) without alteration of cardiomyocyte width and fibrosis compared with T(4) alone. In conclusion, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocking by irbesartan could significantly attenuate TH-induced cardiac structural and functional remodeling. However, HR reduction by propranolol could not alternate structural remodeling, which may implicate the RAS as having an important role in thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy beyond tachycardia.",

Both are highly effective doping agents. As analytical science validated improved techniques to identify these drugs, Olympic athletes, including many medallists were caught and disqualified. When the International Olympic Committee (IOC) prohibited beta blockers (beneficial in shooting), diuretics (assist weight classified athletes) and glucocorticosteroids, some athletes with genuine medical conditions were denied legitimate medical therapy.

Recent molecular studies, most performed in mouse models, revealed that the MFS is more a developmental abnormality with broad and complex effects on the morphogenesis and function of multiple organ systems. FBN1 haploinsufficiency and dysregulated transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) signaling seem to be critical for clinical manifestations in MFS including aortic root dilatation. Aortic root aneurysm and aortic dissection represent the main causes of morbidity and mortality in MFS. Most importantly, TGF-\u03b2 antagonism through angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), for example losartan, has been shown to prevent and possibly reverse aortic root dilatation in a mouse model of MFS. A first human study on a small pediatric cohort confirmed those promising results in reducing the aortic root growth over a follow-up period of 12 to 47 months. So, a large multicenter trial has been set up and results should be available soon. Other therapeutic strategies which might be combined with losartan include traditional \u03b2-blockade, doxycyclin and statins.

To achieve this purpose, Lux(\u00ae) Cellulose-1/Sepapak-1 (cellulose tris-(3,5-dymethylphenylcarbamate)) (Phenomenex, Madrid, Spain) chiral stationary phase was used in gradient elution and normal phase mode at ambient temperature. The gradient elution program optimized consisted of a progressive change of the mobile phase polarity from n-hex/EtOH/DEA 90/10/0.5 (v/v/v) to 60/40/0.5 (v/v/v) in 13 min, delivered at a flow rate of 1.3 ml/min and a sudden change of flow rate to 2.3 ml/min in 1 min. Critical steps in any molecularly imprinted polymer extraction protocol such as the flow rate to load the water sample in the cartridges and the breakthrough volume were optimized to obtain the higher extraction recoveries for all compounds.

    "47": "In vivo, the enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 influences ligand access to the mineralocorticoid receptor. Ablation of the encoding gene, HSD11B2, causes the hypertensive syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess. Studies in humans and experimental animals have linked reduced 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 activity and salt sensitivity of blood pressure. In the present study, renal mechanisms underpinning salt sensitivity were investigated in Hsd11b2(+/-) mice fed low-, standard-, and high-sodium diets. In wild-type mice, there was a strong correlation between dietary sodium content and fractional sodium excretion but not blood pressure. High sodium feeding abolished amiloride-sensitive sodium reabsorption, consistent with downregulation of the epithelial sodium channel. In Hsd11b2(+/-) mice, the natriuretic response to increased dietary sodium content was blunted, and epithelial sodium channel activity persisted. High-sodium diet also reduced renal blood flow and increased blood pressure in Hsd11b2(+/-) mice. Aldosterone was modulated by dietary sodium in both genotypes, and salt sensitivity in Hsd11b2(+/-) mice was associated with increased plasma corticosterone levels. Chronic administration of an epithelial sodium channel blocker or a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist prevented salt sensitivity in Hsd11b2(+/-) mice, whereas mineralocorticoid receptor blockade with spironolactone did not. This study shows that reduced 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 causes salt sensitivity of blood pressure because of impaired renal natriuretic capacity. This reflects deregulation of epithelial sodium channels and increased renal vascular resistance. The phenotype is not caused by illicit activation of mineralocorticoid receptors by glucocorticoids but by direct activation of glucocorticoid receptors.",

Isolated mouse (from 20 to 25 mice) and human (from 3 donors) islets, and MIN6 \u03b2-cells, were used to investigate whether the stimulatory effect of OSA\u00ae on insulin secretion was dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium and protein kinase activation.", 
    "59": "OSA \u00ae-induced insulin secretion from mouse islets and MIN6 \u03b2-cells was inhibited by nifedipine, a voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel blocker, and by the removal of extracellular Ca(2+), respectively. OSA\u00ae did not affect the activities of KATP channels or voltage-dependent K(+) channels in MIN6 \u03b2-cells but it caused an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) concentrations in Fura-2-loaded mouse islet cells. The insulin secretagogue effect of OSA\u00ae was dependent, in part, on protein kinase activation since incubating mouse or human islets with staurosporine, a general protein kinase inhibitor, resulted in partial inhibition of OSA\u00ae-induced insulin secretion. Experiments using permeabilized, Ca(2+)-clamped MIN6 \u03b2-cells revealed a Ca(2+)-independent component action of OSA\u00ae at a late stage in the stimulus-response coupling pathway. OSA\u00ae-induced insulin secretion was unexpectedly associated with a decrease in intracellular cAMP levels.",

    "73": "Cardiovascular diseases is one of the key causes of lethality in developed countries. Coronary heart disease and arterial hypertension make significant contribution to this lethality. The above two diseases are often accompanied with compensatory acceleration of the heart rate (HR). At the same time long-term tachycardia is an independent risk factor of complications resultant from high consumption of oxygen, disturbed energy metabolism in cardiomyocytes, regress of heart contractility, development of cardiac failure. Heart contraction rhythm depends on electric activity of the sinus node cells which spontaneously generate action potentials (4P) present in all heart compartments and triggering contractile activity of cardiomyocytes. The study of the pacemaker cells (pC) discovered not only mechanisms responsible for AP rise and HR physiological regulation but revealed new ionic channels -f-channels involved in acceleration and lowering of the heart rate. Reduction of current along the f-channels (If-current) lowers AP generation in PC and, therefore, HR. Three groups of medicines are now used for HR lowering: beta-adrenoblockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists and recently introduced into clinical practice innovative drug ivabradin (coraxan) selectively suppressing activity of f-channels of sinus node cells and thus lowering HR. The review analyses differences in mechanisms of a negative chronotropic effect of these drugs.", 
    "74": "Resistant hypertension (RH) is defined as blood pressure above a goal despite adherence to at least 3 optimally dosed antihypertensive medications of different classes, one of which is a diuretic. Evaluation of possible RH begins with an assessment of adherence to medications. The white-coat effect should be ruled out by out-of-office blood pressure monitoring. Obesity, heavy alcohol intake, and interfering substances all contribute to RH. Dietary sodium restriction is an important part of management. RH may be secondary to problems such as renal disease, obstructive sleep apnea, or aldosteronism, and testing for these conditions should be considered. Adequate diuretic treatment is a key part of therapy. Chlorthalidone is more effective than hydrochlorothiazide in reducing blood pressure because it is more potent and lasts longer. In addition, it may reduce cardiovascular events to a greater extent than hydrochlorothiazide. When glomerular filtration rate is <30 mL/min, a loop diuretic usually is needed. The addition of spironolactone, with careful attention to potassium levels, is an evidence-based strategy for the treatment of RH. Other strategies include use of a vasodilating \u03b2-blocker, adding a long-acting nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, or adding clonidine. When blood pressure is not coming under control despite 4 or 5 agents, referral to a hypertension specialist may be warranted.", 
    "75": "Various hormonal and monoaminergic systems play determinant roles in the regulation of several cytochromes P450 (P450s) in the liver. Growth hormone (GH), prolactin, and insulin are involved in P450 regulation, and their release is under dopaminergic control. This study focused on the role of D\u2082-dopaminergic systems in the regulation of the major drug-metabolizing P450s, i.e., CYP3A, CYP2C, and CYP2D. Blockade of D\u2082-dopaminergic receptors with either sulpiride (SULP) or 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)piperidin-4-ol (L-741,626) markedly down-regulated CYP3A1/2, CYP2C11, and CYP2D1 expression in rat liver. This suppressive effect appeared to be mediated by the insulin/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/FOXO1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, inactivation of the GH/STAT5b signaling pathway appeared to play a role in D\u2082-dopaminergic receptor-mediated down-regulating effects on these P450s. SULP suppressed plasma GH levels, with subsequently reduced activation of STAT5b, which is the major GH pulse-activated transcription factor and has up-regulating effects on various P450s in hepatic tissue. Levels of prolactin, which exerts down-regulating control on P450s, were increased by SULP, which may contribute to SULP-mediated effects. Finally, it appears that SULP-induced inactivation of the cAMP/protein kinase A/cAMP-response element-binding protein signaling pathway, which is a critical regulator of pregnane X receptor and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b1, and inactivation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase contribute to SULP-induced down-regulation of the aforementioned P450s. Taken together, the present data provide evidence that drugs acting as D\u2082-dopaminergic receptor antagonists might interfere with several major signaling pathways involved in the regulation of CYP3A, CYP2C, and CYP2D, which are critical enzymes in drug metabolism, thus affecting the effectiveness of the majority of prescribed drugs and the toxicity and carcinogenic potency of a plethora of toxicants and carcinogens.", 
    "76": "Phospholamban (PLN) is a 52 amino acid integral membrane protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that exists in both monomeric and pentameric forms. In its unphosphorylated state, PLN inhibits the SR Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA). This inhibition is relieved when PLN is phosphorylated as a result of \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation of the heart. Consistent with some predictions from molecular models and from functional studies of PLN incorporated into planar lipid bilayers, it has also been postulated that pentameric PLN can also form ion-selective channels. Other molecular models contradict this hypothesis, however. In the work reported here, we used the Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent dye Fura-2, to examine the passive Ca(2+) permeability of the SR membrane in vesicles derived from cardiac ventricle. We have found that phosphorylation of PLN by protein kinase A (PKA) leads to an increase in the rate of Ca(2+) leak from Ca(2+)-loaded SR vesicles. This enhanced rate of Ca(2+) leak from the SR is also observed when SR vesicles are incubated with a PLN specific antibody (A1) that mimics phosphorylation of PLN. The ryanodine receptor blocker ruthenium red does not affect the increased rate of Ca(2+) leak from the SR after PLN phosphorylation with PKA or after exposure to A1 antibody, arguing against a possible role of ryanodine receptors in mediating the enhanced leak. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that phosphorylated PLN forms or regulates a Ca(2+) leak pathway in cardiac SR membranes in situ.", 
    "77": "Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a clinical syndrome characterized by excessive resting heart rate (HR) or disproportional increasing HR during exercise. The treatment of IST symptoms using beta-blockers or calcium channel-blockers is often non-effective or not well tolerated. Ivabradine is a new agent inhibiting sinus node I(f) current, resulting in a decrease of HR without haemodynamic compromise.", 
    "78": "We enrolled 20 patients (36 \u00b1 10 years; 14 women) affected by IST and resistant to previous administered therapy by using beta-blockers or verapamil. After 4 weeks of treatment with metoprolol succinate (up to 190 mg once a day) the therapy was switched to ivabradine up to 7.5 mg twice daily. Holter monitoring and treadmill stress test were performed after 1 and 2 months following start of the study. We observed a significant reduction of resting HR both for metoprolol and for ivabradine compared with baseline (92.8 vs. 90.2 vs. 114.3 b.p.m.; P< 0.001). During daily activity there was an even larger decrease of HR on ivabradine (mean daytime HR 94.6 vs. 87.1 vs. 107.3 b.p.m.; P< 0.001). Ivabradine was very well tolerated whereas in 10 patients on metoprolol we observed hypotension or bradycardia requiring dose reduction.

Fourteen patients (70%) treated with I(f) blocker were free of IST-related complaints.",

These and other analyses were repeated 30 days after instillation of the new eye drop treatment.", 
    "87": "The results demonstrated that patients enrolled with the preserved fixed combination of dorzolamide or brinzolamide represented a subgroup of patients in which the discomfort symptoms were supposedly justified by the presence of BAK used chronically in antihypertensive drops. Ocular discomfort scores were significantly higher with dorzolamide/timolol than brinzolamide/timolol (p < 0.0001).",

    "89": "The aim of the present investigation was to improve the permeation of Atenolol by preparing a transdermal patch and using the method of iontophoresis. Influence of chemical penetration enhancers was also studied. Combination of iontophoresis and chemical penetration enhancer d-limonene and oleic acid produced satisfactory permeation and flux. The electrically driven penetration enhancement provided by this method has succeeded in overcoming the formidable barrier presented by the stratum corneum, and has shown to be a promising technique for the transport of hydrophilic drug Atenolol from polymeric films. Atenolol is a water-soluble, ionizable drug and suffers from poor bioavailability when given by oral route due to its incomplete intestinal absorption and first-pass metabolism. Being a BCS class III drug, Atenolol has low log P (0.23) value, which also may be the reason for its poor intestinal absorption. Iontophoretic delivery using Ag/AgCl electrodes with current density of 0.35 mA/cm(2) enhances its delivery rate and thereby overcomes the problem of incomplete absorption. The prepared transdermal patches were subjected to ex vivo drug permeation studies using rat skin in phosphate buffer pH 7.4 for 24 h (passive and iontophoresis), and samples collected were analyzed by gradient high-pressure liquid chromatography. The column used was chiral alpha-glycoprotein (AGP) column (10 cm, particle size 5\u03bc) and UV-detection at 225 nm was used. The effectiveness of permeation enhancers (d-Limonene and oleic acid) was determined by comparing drug flux in the presence and absence of each enhancer. Combination strategies of iontophoresis with chemical enhancers like oleic acid led to the significantly higher flux levels compared with passive transdermal delivery.", 
    "90": "We developed a platform combining fluorogen-activating protein (FAP) technology with high-throughput flow cytometry to detect real-time protein trafficking to and from the plasma membrane in living cells. The hybrid platform facilitates drug discovery for trafficking receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors and was validated with the \u03b2\u2082-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2\u2082AR) system. When a chemical library containing \u223c1200 off-patent drugs was screened against cells expressing FAP-tagged \u03b2\u2082ARs, all 33 known \u03b2\u2082AR-active ligands in the library were successfully identified, together with a number of compounds that might regulate receptor internalization in a nontraditional manner. Results indicated that the platform identified ligands of target proteins regardless of the associated signaling pathway; therefore, this approach presents opportunities to search for biased receptor modulators and is suitable for screening of multiplexed targets for improved efficiency. The results revealed that ligands may be biased with respect to the rate or duration of receptor internalization and that receptor internalization may be independent of activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.", 
    "91": "Drug testing for sports doping control programs is extensive and includes numerous classes of banned compounds including anabolic androgenic steroids, \u03b22-agonists, hormone antagonists and modulators, diuretics, various peptide hormones, and growth factors.

Each of these classes of compounds can contain many prohibited substances that must be identified during the testing procedure. Various methods that have been designed to detect a large number of compounds in different drug classes are highly desirable as initial screening tools. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is widely used by anti-doping testing laboratories for this purpose and several rapid methods have been described to simultaneously detect different classes of compounds. Here, we describe a simple urine sample cleanup procedure that can be used to detect numerous anabolic androgenic steroids, \u03b22-agonists, hormone antagonists and modulators, glucocorticosteroids, and beta-blockers by LC-MS/MS.", 
    "92": "The likelihood of success of conservative management of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) and the predictors of failure of conservative therapy are not known. We therefore evaluated the efficacy of an algorithm for the management of symptoms and predictors of failed conservative therapy in 249 consecutive symptomatic patients with obstructive HC referred to a dedicated HC program for management in general or for septal reduction therapy (SRT) in particular. There was considerable practice variation in the extent to which conservative therapy was optimized before referral for SRT. Over 3.7 \u00b1 2.9-year follow-up, symptoms resolved with addition of or increase in dosage of a \u03b2 blocker, calcium channel blocker, or disopyramide in 16%, 10%, and 10% of patients, respectively. Pacing with short atrioventricular delay controlled symptoms in 4 of 9 patients. In 63% of patients, conservative measures failed to control symptoms. Multivariate predictors of failure of conservative therapy were presence of New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 2.9, p = 0.001) and greater septal wall thickness (hazard ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.10, p = 0.003) at presentation. At time of presentation, 93 patients (37%) were already on optimal therapy and were referred for SRT. Of the remaining 156 patients who did not require immediate SRT, 93 (60%) were free from a recommendation for SRT at the end of the follow-up period. In conclusion, in symptomatic patients with obstructive HC, conservative therapy is successful in >1/3 of referred patients at 3.7-year follow-up, obviating SRT in these patients. Clinicians in programs offering SRT should optimize conservative therapy before recommending SRT.", 
    "93": "Polymorphisms of the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) gene play a major role in pharmacokinetic variability in human, while CYP2D6*10 is an important subtype in Asian people. In this study, the co-expression enzyme of human recombinant CYPOR, CYPb5 and CYP2D6.1 or CYP2D6.10 with the Bac-to-Bac system in baculovirus-infected insect cells was used to study the catalytical activity to imipramine metabolism and stereoselective metabolism of propranolol. The metabolites of imipramine were identified of hydroxyl imipramine and desipramine by LC-MS/MS. There are some differences between CYP2D6.1 and CYP2D6.10 activity. The kinetics parameters K(m), V(max), and CL(int) are 11.77 +/- 0.91 micromol/L, 0.4235 +/- 0.05 nmol/nmol CYP2D6.1/min and 3.60 x 10(-5) ml/min/nmol CYP2D6.1 (n = 3) for CYP2D6.1, respectively, and 9.05 +/- 0.87 micromol/L, 0.42 +/- 0.03 nmol/nmol CYP2D6.10/min, and 4.60 x 10(-5) ml/min/nmol CYP2D6.10 (n = 3) for CYP2D6.10. For propranolol, two metabolites were identified to be hydroxyl and N-desisopropylation propranolol by LC-MS/MS. When the substrate concentration was 0.20 micromol/L, CYP2D6.1 and CYP2D6.10 exhibited significant stereoseletivity. Furthermore, enantioselective formation has been detected. Both of CYP2D6.1 and CYP2D6.10 produced more hydroxyl propranolol from the R-(+)-isomer than from the S-(-)-isomer while there was no obvious difference for N-desisopropylation propranolol production between R-(+)- and S-(-)- isomer. In summary, there is a somewhat different catalytical activity and stereoselectivity between the human recombinant CYP2D6.1 and CYP2D6.10. The data we got will be helpful in preclinical research and clinical use of CYP2D6 substrates.",

Cardiac tomography documented anomalous origin of the right coronary artery (ARCA) arising from the left sinus of valsalva coursing between the aorta and pulmonary artery. Myocardial ischaemia and myocardial damage revealed by SPECT are related to the transient coronary flow reduction elicited by the compression of the ARCA that is produced by the great arteries during exercise. The ARCA is a rare condition, but may cause myocardial infarction and sudden death. \u03b2-blockers and dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers may provide cardioprotection from inducible myocardial ischaemia. However, in case of failure of medical cardioprotection, relocation of the ARCA to the appropriate aortic sinus and coronary bypass grafting could be considered as the best options.",

Ivabradine also exerts some of its beneficial effects by decreasing cardiac proinflammatory cytokines and inhibiting peroxidants and collagen accumulation in atherosclerosis or congestive heart failure. However, the effects of ivabradine in the setting of acute viral myocarditis and on the cytokines, oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis have not been investigated.",

In a coxsackievirus B3 murine myocarditis model (Balb/c), effects of ivabradine and carvedilol (a nonselective \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist) on myocardial histopathological changes, cardiac function, plasma noradrenaline, cytokine levels, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase contents were studied. Both ivabradine and carvedilol similarly and significantly reduced heart rate, attenuated myocardial lesions and improved the impairment of left ventricular function. In addition, ivabradine treatment as well as carvedilol treatment showed significant effects on altered myocardial cytokines with a decrease in the amount of plasma noradrenaline. The increased myocardial MCP-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. in the infected mice was significantly attenuated in the ivabradine treatment group. Only carvedilol had significant anti-oxidative and anti-apoptoic effects in coxsackievirus B3-infected mice.", 
    "105": "These results show that the protective effects of heart rate reduction with ivabradine and carvedilol observed in the acute phase of coxsackievirus B3 murine myocarditis may be due not only to the heart rate reduction itself but also to the downregulation of inflammatory cytokines.",

In a multivariable linear regression model, mean on-treatment clinic or 24-hour SBP, but not SBP coefficient of variation or SD, was associated with end-of-treatment carotid intima-media thickness. Intima-media thickness increased progressively from the lowest to highest quartile of mean on-treatment clinic or 24-hour SBP (adjusted P for trend=0.046 and 0.048) but not along similar quartiles of SBP coefficient of variation or SD. In a multivariable logistic regression model, mean BP, but not variability, was associated with cardiovascular outcomes.",

In this study, the effects of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) on symptoms and medication score and skin prick test evaluation of patients with allergic rhinitis were investigated.In this placebo controlled trial, twenty four patients aged 5-18 years old with grass pollen induced rhinitis and sensitive to rye grass by positive skin prick test received randomly sublingual extract of rye grass or placebo for 6 months. Symptom and medication scores and adverse effects of SLIT were assessed during treatment. Skin prick test induced wheal at the beginning and the end of therapy were also measured. Data were analyzed with SPSS software.We found significant reduction of symptoms in intervention group from 21st week of immunotherapy (p<0.05). Medication scores were also reduced after 16th week (p<0.05), adverse effects were low and insignificant in both groups. Erythema induced diameter with skin prick test for grass and rye grass was significantly reduced in SLI group after immunotherapy.This study indicates that SLIT in grass-pollen rhinitis is well tolerated, improves overall clinical symptoms, and reduces drug consumes. We recommend this therapy as a safe therapy in patients with allergic rhinitis.",

The bi-layer-polymer structures were created on the surface of silica layer-by-layer. The inner layer was composed of poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene), which was grafted first for binding small molecules based on hydrophobic and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. The poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) bonded silica has good selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbons. It also has hydrophobicity and column efficiency similar to a C(18) bonded silica. The material has shown good ability of protein exclusion after grafting hydrophilic polymer on the external surface while its hydrophobicity and selectivity do not have obvious change. It demonstrated that the material is still qualified for hydrophobic extraction. In the study, the relations between the polymer structures and chromatographic properties of the materials were investigated. The synthetic conditions were optimized. The results have shown that the material prepared in the study has application potential in the HPLC analysis of hydrophobic molecules from biological samples by direct injection. It demonstrated that atom transfer radical polymerization can be used as a method in the preparation of restricted access material.",

CVS is characterised by recurrent stereotypic episodes of nausea and vomiting lasting hours or some days. Between these episodes there are intervals free of symptoms. The main symptoms include nausea, vomiting and often abdominal pain. CVS is a rare disorder in adult patients. Because of the lack of awarness, making the correct diagnosis is not easy und often delayed for some months or years. There is no specific test to secure the diagnosis. The accurate diagnosis is based on the typical anamnestic report and the exclusion of other disorders associated with a recurrent vomiting. No standard evidence-based treatment is currently available either to manage the acute vomiting episode or to manage the prophylactic therapy. For the acute treatment of the vomiting episodes antiemetic, antimigraine and sedative medications were used. The medications frequently used for the prophylactic therapy are amitriptyline and propranolol.",

We evaluated an all-comer population of our dedicated CHF outpatient clinic between 2006 and 2010. For inclusion, individually optimized doses of guideline-recommended pharmacotherapy including beta-blockers had to be maintained for at least 3\u00a0months and routine follow-up performed at our outpatient CHF-clinic thereafter. Treatment dosages of beta-blockers, and demographic and clinical profiles including resting heart rate were assessed. The outcome of patients who fulfilled select inclusion criteria of the SHIFT study (left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u226435\u00a0%, sinus rhythm, NYHA II-IV) and were followed-up for at least 1\u00a0year was stratified according to resting heart rates:\u00a0\u226575 versus\u00a0<75\u00a0bpm and\u00a0\u226570 versus\u00a0<70\u00a0bpm. The composite primary endpoint was defined as all-cause death or hospital admission for worsening heart failure during 12-month follow-up. In total, 3,181 patients were assessed in regard to treatment dosages of beta-blockers, and demographic and clinical profiles including resting heart rate. Of the overall studied population, 443 patients fulfilled all inclusion criteria and entered outcome analysis. Median observation time of survivors was 27.5\u00a0months with 1,039.7 observation-years in total. Up-titration to at least half the evidence-based target dose of beta-blockers was achieved in 69\u00a0% and full up-titration in 29\u00a0% of these patients. Patients with increased heart rates were younger, more often male, exhibited a higher NYHA functional class and lower LVEF. The primary endpoint occurred in 21\u00a0% of patients in the\u00a0\u226570\u00a0bpm group versus 9\u00a0% of patients in the group with heart rates\u00a0<70\u00a0bpm (p\u00a0<0.01). Likewise, comparing the groups\u00a0\u226575 and <75\u00a0bpm, the primary endpoint was significantly increased in the group of patients with heart rates\u00a0\u226575\u00a0bpm 27 vs. 12.2\u00a0%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). 5-year event-free survival was significantly lower among patients with heart rates \u226570\u00a0bpm as compared to those with\u00a0<70\u00a0bpm (log-rank test p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and among patients in the\u00a0\u226575\u00a0bpm group versus\u00a0<75\u00a0bpm group (log-rank test p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In conclusion, in clinical practice, 53\u00a0% of CHF patients have inadequate heart rate control (heart rates\u00a0\u226575\u00a0bpm) despite concomitant beta-blocker therapy. In this non-randomized cohort, adequate heart rate control under individually optimized beta-blocker therapy was associated with improved mid- and long-term clinical outcome up to 5\u00a0years. As further up titration of beta-blockers is not achievable in many patients, the administration of a selective heart rate lowering agent, such as ivabradine adjuvant to beta-blockers may pose an opportunity to further modulate outcome.", 
    "117": "Hispidulin, a naturally occurring flavone, has been reported to have an antiepileptic profile. An excessive release of glutamate is considered to be related to neuropathology of epilepsy. We investigated whether hispidulin affected endogenous glutamate release in rat cerebral cortex nerve terminals (synaptosomes) and explored the possible mechanism. Hispidulin inhibited the release of glutamate evoked by the K\u207a channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). The effects of hispidulin on the evoked glutamate release were prevented by the chelation of extracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a ions and the vesicular transporter inhibitor bafilomycin A1. However, the glutamate transporter inhibitor dl-threo-beta-benzyl-oxyaspartate did not have any effect on hispidulin action. Hispidulin reduced the depolarization-induced increase in cytosolic free Ca\u00b2\u207a concentration ([Ca\u00b2\u207a](C)), but did not alter 4-AP-mediated depolarization. Furthermore, the effect of hispidulin on evoked glutamate release was abolished by blocking the Ca(v)2.2 (N-type) and Ca(v)2.1 (P/Q-type) channels, but not by blocking ryanodine receptors or mitochondrial Na\u207a/Ca\u00b2\u207a exchange. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition also prevented the inhibitory effect of hispidulin on evoked glutamate release. Western blot analyses showed that hispidulin decreased the 4-AP-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and synaptic vesicle-associated protein synapsin I, a major presynaptic substrate for ERK; this decrease was also blocked by the MEK inhibitor. Moreover, the inhibition of glutamate release by hispidulin was strongly attenuated in mice without synapsin I. These results show that hispidulin inhibits glutamate release from cortical synaptosomes in rats through the suppression of presynaptic voltage-dependent Ca\u00b2\u207a entry and ERK/synapsin I signaling pathway.",

This cut-off was derived from a calculated reference change value above the biological, analytical, and observer variability of serial LAVI measurement. Multivariate analysis identified significant baseline clinical associates of LAVI progression as increased age, beta-blocker usage, and left ventricular mass index (all P < 0.05). Serological biomarkers were measured in a randomly selected subcohort of 30 'Progressors' matched to 30 'Non-progressors'. For 'Progressors', relative changes in matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), and the TIMP1/MMP9 ratio, markers of interstitial remodelling, tracked with changes in LAVI over time (all P < 0.05).",

Over 200 patients have been described from Japan with significantly less numbers being reported from outside the Orient. IAS is more common in patients older than 40\u2009yr of age with reports in the pediatric age group being notably rarer. Exposure to sulfhydryl group containing medications is implicated in the pathogenesis of this syndrome. In this report, we describe a case of IAS in an African-American adolescent. A 16-yr-old healthy African-American male was diagnosed with Graves' disease and started on Methimazole. Four weeks later, he was found unconscious and hypoglycemic (blood sugar 1.5\u2009mmol/L). Evaluation was negative for insulinoma. Insulin antibodies were positive. Oral glucose tolerance test revealed elevated free insulin concentrations with disproportionately elevated total insulin levels. The patient was started on prednisone, diazoxide, and propranolol for management of IAS and hyperthyroidism. Thyroid radio-ablation was subsequently undertaken.

A series of indenoisoquinolines displaying potent Top1 inhibitory activity in human renal cell carcinoma cell line SN12C were selected to establish 3D-QSAR models using CoMFA and CoMSIA methods. Internal and external cross-validation techniques were investigated, as well as some measures taken, including region focusing, bootstrapping and the \"leave-group-out\" cross-validation method. The satisfactory CoMFA model predicted a q(2) value of 0.659 and an r(2) value of 0.949, indicating that electrostatic and steric properties play a significant role in potency. The best CoMSIA model, based on a combination of steric, electrostatic and H-bond acceptor descriptors, predicted a q(2) value of 0.523 and an r(2) value of 0.902. The models were graphically interpreted by contour plots which provided insight into the structural requirements for increasing the activity of a compound, providing a solid basis for future rational design of more active anticancer agents.", 
    "124": "Surgery is a crucial intervention in most cancer patients, but the perioperative period is characterized by increased risks for future outbreak of preexisting micrometastases and the initiation of new metastases-the major cause of cancer-related death. Here we argue that the short perioperative period is disproportionately critical in determining long-term recurrence rates, discuss the various underlying risk factors that act synergistically during this period, and assert that this time frame presents an unexplored opportunity to reduce long-term cancer recurrence. We then address physiologic mechanisms that underlie these risk factors, focusing on excess perioperative release of catecholamines and prostaglandins, which were recently shown to be prominent in facilitating cancer recurrence through their direct impact on the malignant tissue and its microenvironment, and through suppressing antimetastatic immunity. The involvement of the immune system is further discussed in light of accumulating evidence in cancer patients, and given the recent identification of endogenously activated unique leukocyte populations which, if not suppressed, can destroy autologous \"immune-resistant\" tumor cells. We then review animal studies and human correlative findings, suggesting the efficacy of blocking catecholamines and/or prostaglandins perioperatively, limiting metastasis and increasing survival rates. Finally, we propose a specific perioperative pharmacologic intervention in cancer patients, based on simultaneous \u03b2-adrenergic blockade and COX-2 inhibition, and discuss specific considerations for its application in clinical trials, including our approved protocol. In sum, we herein present the rationale for a new approach to reduce long-term cancer recurrence by using a relatively safe, brief, and inexpensive intervention during the perioperative period.",

We examined whether PP predicted new-onset AF in comparison with other blood pressure components in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study, a double-blind, randomized (losartan versus atenolol), parallel-group study, including 9193 patients with hypertension and electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy. In 8810 patients with neither a history of AF nor AF at baseline, Minnesota coding of electrocardiograms confirmed new-onset AF in 353 patients (4.0%) during mean 4.9 years of follow-up. In multivariate Cox regression analyses, baseline and in-treatment PP and baseline and in-treatment systolic blood pressure predicted new-onset AF, independent of baseline age, height, weight, and Framingham Risk Score; sex, race, and treatment allocation; and in-treatment heart rate and Cornell product. PP was the strongest single blood pressure predictor of new-onset AF determined by the decrease in the -2 Log likelihood statistic, in comparison with systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure. When evaluated in the same model, the predictive effect of systolic and diastolic blood pressures together was similar to that of PP. In this population of patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, PP was the strongest single blood pressure predictor of new-onset AF, independent of other risk factors.",

The inclusion complexation with \u03b2-CD is investigated by UV-visible, steady state and time resolved fluorescence spectra and PM3 method. In protic solvents, the normal emission originates from a locally excited state and the longer wavelength emission is due to intramolecular charge transfer (TICT). Labetalol forms a 1:2 complex and pseudoephedrine forms 1:1 complex with \u03b2-CD. Nanosecond time-resolved studies indicated that both molecules show triexponential decay. Thermodynamic parameters (\u0394G, \u0394H, \u0394S) and HOMO, LUMO orbital investigations confirm the stability of the inclusion complex. The geometry of the most stable complex shows that the aromatic ring is deeply self included inside the \u03b2-CD cavity and intermolecular hydrogen bonds were established between host and guest molecules. This suggests that hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bond play an important role in the inclusion process.",

MET and HCT were detected at 240 and 214 nm, respectively, using a photodiode array detector. The univariate approach was used for optimizing voltage, injection time and capillary temperature. The factorial design with response surface plots, as a multivariate approach, was used to study the effect of buffer concentration and pH on resolution, peak area and migration time. The optimum conditions were 50 mmol/L phosphate at pH 9.5, injection time 10.0 s, voltage 25 kV and capillary temperature 25\u00b0C. The method was linear in the range of 2.5-250 \u00b5g/mL for both drugs with correlation coefficients above 0.9997. Additionally, acceptable recovery of the contents of MET and HCT in their formulations (96.0-100.3%) with acceptable precision (1.38-2.60 %) were achieved.

In phosphate buffer solution with pH 7.5, the fluorescence of PPL dramatically quenched upon addition of SCX6 revealing the formation of inclusion complexes between PPL and SCX6. The stoichiometric ratio was verified to be 1:1 by the continuous variation method. The inclusion constant of PPL-SCX6 complexes was calculated as 2.2\u00d710(4)L/mol by the nonlinear curve fitting method. (1)H NMR titration spectra testified that the aliphatic chain of PPL may be partially penetrated into the hydrophobic cavity of SCX6. This was confirmed by molecular dynamics calculations.", 
    "129": "It is well established that glucocorticoid hormones strengthen the consolidation of long-term memory of emotionally arousing experiences but have little effect on memory of low-arousing experiences. Although both positive and negative emotionally arousing events tend to be well remembered, studies investigating the neural mechanism underlying glucocorticoid-induced memory enhancement focused primarily on negatively motivated training experiences. In the present study we show an involvement of glucocorticoids within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in enhancing memory consolidation of both an appetitive and aversive form of taste learning. The specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist RU 28362 (1 or 3ng) administered bilaterally into the NAc shell, but not core, of male Sprague-Dawley rats immediately after an appetitive saccharin drinking experience dose-dependently enhanced 24-h retention of the safe taste, resulting in a facilitated attenuation of neophobia. Similarly, GR agonist infusions given into the NAc shell immediately after pairing of the saccharin taste with a malaise-inducing agent enhanced memory of this negative experience, resulting in an intensified conditioned aversion. Importantly, a suppression of noradrenergic activity within the NAc shell with the \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol blocked the facilitating effect of a concurrently administered GR agonist on memory consolidation in both the appetitive and aversive learning task. Thus, these findings indicate that GR activation interacts with the noradrenergic arousal system within the NAc to enhance memory consolidation of emotionally arousing training experiences regardless of valence.", 
    "130": "Antagonists of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-ARs) have previously been demonstrated to impair long-term memory in a variety of animal behavioral paradigms. Surprisingly little is known about the ability of \u03b2-ARs to modulate initial memory formation in drug conditioning paradigms. The current study examined whether the post-training administration of the \u03b2-AR antagonist, propranolol, would disrupt single-trial cocaine-induced sensitization. Rats received 10 mg/kg propranolol immediately following a 30-min cocaine or vehicle exposure in a conditioning context and were later tested for their locomotor response to a cocaine challenge. Rats that received propranolol following cocaine conditioning showed an impairment of locomotor sensitization during testing. However, this effect was only seen in animals with an initial sensitivity to the locomotor effects of cocaine. Rats that failed to show a locomotor response to cocaine during conditioning were not affected by propranolol. We discuss the implications of these findings as they relate to drug conditioning and memory consolidation studies.",

Dysfunction of the interactions between these neurotransmitters may induce human diseases. In the present study, the interactions of morphine and acetylcholine (ACh), NMDA, and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist (scopolamine, MK-801, and propanolol) were evaluated in a single-blind design by co-administrations of morphine and these drugs in a delayed response in rhesus monkeys. The results indicated that: (1) Co-administration of morphine and scopolamine deteriorated spatial working memory. (2) Co-treatment of morphine and MK-801 restored impairment caused by morphine and MK-801 in a dose-depending pattern. (3) Morphine plus propranolol impaired spatial working memory. High dose of morphine (0.01 mg/kg) reversed impaired spatial working memory induced by single propranolol and morphine treatment. These data suggested that the interactions of morphine and AChergic, NMDAergic and beta-adrenergic compounds were involved in spatial working memory in rhesus monkeys.",

We found the \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist SR59230A to be an inhibitor of Kir2.x channels. Therefore, we characterized the effects of SR59230A on Kir2.x and other relevant cardiac potassium channels. Cloned channels were expressed in the Xenopus oocyte expression system and measured with the double-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. SR59230A inhibited homomeric Kir2.1 channels with an IC(50) of 33\u03bcM. Homomeric Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 channels and Kir2.x heteromers were also inhibited by SR59230A with similar potency. In contrast, no relevant inhibitory effects of SR59230A were found in cardiac Kv1.5, Kv4.3 and KvLQT1/minK channels. In hERG channels, SR59230A only induced a weak inhibition at a high concentration. These findings establish SR59230A as a novel inhibitor of Kir2.1-2.3 channels with a favorable profile with respect to additional effects on other cardiac repolarizing potassium channels.",

The effect of cardiovascular risk factors and medications on CPCs isolation efficiency, c-kit stem cell marker expression, and ex\u00a0vivo proliferative potential is unknown and was examined in the present work. Cells from human right atrial appendages (n = 50) were expanded in culture; after \u223c16 days (T0), it was established the percentage of CPCs and c-kit protein mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Thereafter, CPCs were isolated by high throughput sorting; after culturing for 4 passages CPCs-derived cells were re-analyzed to assess c-kit(+) cell percentage and enrichment vs T0. The association between 19 demographic and clinical variables to CPCs number and MFI at T0, and CPCs enrichment at P4, was determined by multiple linear regression analysis with stepwise selection procedure. The results revealed that (1) at T0, the number of isolated CPCs directly correlated to \u03b2-blocker treatment; (2) at T0, c-kit protein expression directly correlated to pulmonary hypertension (PH); (3) at P4, CPC's enrichment inversely correlated to smoke, atrial fibrillation (AF), a history of myocardial infarction, whereas it directly correlated to PH and statins. Patient clinical profile and medications differently modulate CPCs isolation and amplification potential ex\u00a0vivo. These results may provide new insights for the understanding of cardiac homeostasis and suggest both limitations and possible enhancing strategies for the therapeutic use of cardiac-resident progenitor cells.",

However, the CBH column resulted in better resolution of enantiomers (R(s)=2.5 for amphetamine compared with R(s)=1.2 with Chirobiotic V). Method recovery rates were typically >80% for both methodologies. Pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs detected and quantified in environmental samples were successfully identified using MS/MS confirmation. In sewage effluent, the total beta-blocker concentrations of propranolol, atenolol and metoprolol were on average 77.0, 1091.0 and 3.6 ng L(-1) thus having EFs (Enantiomeric Fractions) of 0.43, 0.55 and 0.54 respectively. In river water, total propranolol and atenolol was quantified on average at <10.0 ng L(-1). Differences in EF between sewage and river water matrices were evident: venlafaxine was observed with respective EF of 0.43 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.58 \u00b1 0.02.",

Extracellular stimuli induce inter- and intramolecular interactions that change the functional state of GPCRs and activate intracellular messenger molecules. How these interactions are established and how they modulate the functional state of GPCRs remain to be understood. We used dynamic single-molecule force spectroscopy to investigate how ligand binding modulates the energy landscape of the human \u03b22 adrenergic receptor (\u03b22 AR). Five different ligands representing either agonists, inverse agonists or neutral antagonists established a complex network of interactions that tuned the kinetic, energetic, and mechanical properties of functionally important structural regions of \u03b22 AR. These interactions were specific to the efficacy profile of the ligands investigated and suggest that the functional modulation of GPCRs follows structurally well-defined interaction patterns.",

Since its first description, the field of pharmacogenetics has expanded to study a broad range of cardiovascular drugs and has become a mainstream research discipline. Three principle classes of pharmacogenetic markers have emerged: 1) pharmacokinetic; 2) pharmacodynamic; and 3) underlying disease mechanism. In the realm of cardiovascular pharmacogenetics, significant advances have identified markers in each class for a variety of therapeutics, some with a potential for improving patient outcomes. While ongoing clinical trials will determine if routine use of pharmacogenetic testing may be beneficial, the data today support pharmacogenetic testing for certain variants on an individualized, case-by-case basis. Our primary goal is to review the association data for the major pharmacogenetic variants associated with commonly used cardiovascular medications: antiplatelet agents, warfarin, statins, beta-blockers, diuretics, and antiarrhythmic drugs. In addition, we highlight which variants and in which contexts pharmacogenetic testing can be implemented by practicing clinicians. The pace of genetic discovery has outstripped the generation of the evidence justifying its clinical adoption. Until the evidentiary gaps are filled, however, clinicians may choose to target therapeutics to individual patients whose genetic background indicates that they stand to benefit the most from pharmacogenetic testing.",

The relation between PAI-1 and inflammation is of particular interest, but current knowledge regarding regulation of PAI-1 in adipose tissue is mainly based on animal studies or ex vivo experiments on human cultured adipocytes. So far, no study has described stimulated gene expression and protein synthesis of PAI-1 in vivo in human adipose tissue. We used open heart surgery as a model of acute systemic inflammation. Twenty-two male patients underwent blood sampling and omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies for gene expression studies before and after surgery. Expression and localisation of PAI-1 antigen was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. After surgery gene expression of PAI-1 increased 27-fold in omental adipose tissue and three-fold in subcutaneous adipose tissue, but no differences were found in tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) mRNA. PAI-1 antigen was localised within endothelial cells and in the adipose tissue interstitium close to vessels. The upregulated gene expression and protein synthesis in adipose tissue was followed by increased concentrations of PAI-1 antigen in plasma. In conclusion, we present for the first time that an acute systemic inflammation in humans increased gene expression and protein synthesis of PAI-1 in adipose tissue and that this increase was most prominent in omental adipose tissue. PAI-1 synthesis in adipose tissue due to acute systemic inflammation may be a link between inflammation and impaired endogenous fibrinolysis.",

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), because of their inherent multipotent nature and their ability to secrete a multitude of growth factors and cytokines, have been used for cardiac repair with encouraging results. Preclinical studies showed that MSCs injected into infarcted hearts improve cardiac function and attenuate fibrosis. Although stem cell transplantation is a promising therapeutic option to repair the infarcted heart, it is faced with a number of challenges, including the survival of the transplanted cells in the ischemic region, due to excessive oxidative stress present in the ischemic region. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of Carvedilol (Carv), a nonselective \u03b2-blocker with antioxidant properties, on the survival and engraftment of MSCs in the infarcted heart. MSCs were subjected to a simulated host-tissue environment, similar to the one present in the infarcted myocardium, by culturing them in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) to induce oxidative stress. MSCs were treated with 2.5 \u03bcM Carv for 1 h in serum-free medium, followed by treatment with H(2)O(2) for 2 h.

Twenty-eight dogs were randomly divided into sham, pacing, \u03b23-AR agonist (BRL37344) and \u03b23-AR antagonist (L748337) groups. AF was induced by rapid atrial pacing at 600 beats per minute for 3 weeks and evaluated by determining the ultrastructure and function of atria. The expression of \u03b23-AR and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was examined by western blot, immunohistochemistry and real-time RT-PCR. Additionally, the extent of oxidative stress was tested. We found the atrial enlargement and dysfunction in pacing group. Moreover, atrial interstitial fibrosis, apoptosis and oxidative stress were increased and the levels of \u03b23-AR and phosphorylated p38 MAPK were increased after pacing. Activation of \u03b23-AR exacerbated the pathologic changes and oxidative stress, which were effectively inhibited by L748337. We concluded that \u03b23-AR was upregulated in paced atria, which contributed to oxidative stress and exacerbated atrial structural remodeling by regulating p38 MAPK.

In the overall population was regionally analyzed the use of aspirin, clopidogrel, ACE inhibitors / AT1 blocker, beta-blockers and statins, separately and grouped by individual score ranging from 0 (no drug used) to 100 (all drugs used). In myocardial infarction with ST elevation (STEMI) regional differences were analyzed regarding the use of therapeutic recanalization (fibrinolytics and primary angioplasty).", 
    "190": "In the overall population, within the first 24 hours of hospitalization, the mean score in the North-Northeast (70.5 \u00b1 22.1) was lower (p <0.05) than in the Southeast (77.7 \u00b1 29.5), Midwest (82 \u00b1 22.1) and South (82.4 \u00b1 21) regions. At hospital discharge, the score of the North-Northeast region (61.4 \u00b1 32.9) was lower (p <0.05) than in the Southeast (69.2 \u00b1 31.6), Midwest (65.3 \u00b1 33.6) and South (73.7 \u00b1 28.1) regions; additionally, the score of the Midwest was lower (p <0.05) than the South region. In STEMI, the use of recanalization therapies was highest in the Southeast (75.4%, p = 0.001 compared to the rest of the country), and lowest in the North-Northeast (52.5%, p <0.001 compared to the rest of the country).", 
    "191": "The use of demonstrably effective therapies in the treatment of acute coronary disease is much to be desired in the country, with important regional differences.", 
    "192": "Reducing heart rate (HR) in CT angiography of the coronary arteries (CTACor) is critical to image quality. The effectiveness of calcium channel blockers as alternatives for patients with contraindications to beta-blockers has not been established.", 
    "193": "To compare the efficacy in the reduction of HR and RR variability of metoprolol and diltiazem in CTACor.", 
    "194": "Prospective, randomized, open study that included patients with clinical indication of CTACor in sinus rhythm with HR > 70 bpm and no use of agents that could interfere with HR. Fifty patients were randomized to the groups: metoprolol IV 5-15 mg or up to HR \u2264 60 bpm (M), and diltiazem IV 0.25 to 0.60 mg/kg or up to HR \u2264 60 bpm (D). Blood pressure (BP) and HR were measured at baseline, 1 minute, 3 minutes and 5 minutes after the agents, at the acquisition and after CTACor.", 
    "195": "HR reduction in absolute values was higher in group M than in group D (1, 3, 5 min, acquisition and post-test). The percentage reduction of HR was significantly higher in group M only 1 min and 3 min after the start of the agents. There was no difference in 5 min at acquisition and after examination. The percentage RR variability in group D was lower than that in group M during acquisition (RR variability/mean HR of acquisition). A single case of AVB, 2:1 Mobitz I occurred, which was spontaneously reverted (group D).", 
    "196": "We conclude that diltiazem is an effective and safe alternative to beta-blockers in the reduction of HR when performing computed tomography angiography of coronary arteries."
