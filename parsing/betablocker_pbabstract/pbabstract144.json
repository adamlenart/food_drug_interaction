Recent studies have demonstrated that AChE promotes the aggregation of PrP106-126, a peptide deduced from the prion protein sequence. In the present study we show that AChE triggers also the fibrillization of the main component of the amyloid plaques -the peptide spanning residues 82-146 (PrP82-146)- found in patients with Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler-Scheinker disease (GSS). The kinetics of PrP82-146 aggregate formation was directly correlated with AChE concentration and mature fibrils showed the tinctorial and optical properties of amyloid. Atomic force microscopy analysis showed that oligomer and amyloid fibril formation were significantly accelerated by AChE. This effect was mediated by the peripheral site of the enzyme since propidium iodide inhibited the fibrillization process. Present results strongly support the role of AChE in triggering amyloidogenesis and the potential therapeutic relevance of peripheral site blocker compounds.", 
    "1": "After administration of metoprolol, plasma concentrations of the drug are markedly higher in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs) than in non-PMs. In a prospective double-blind 3-month study, we investigated whether this translates into differences in metoprolol's effects after initiation of therapy. Despite administering equal doses to PMs and non-PMs, metoprolol plasma concentrations were 4.9-fold higher in the PM group. Metoprolol evoked significantly and persistently greater reductions in heart rate, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure in PMs than in non-PMs. It appears, therefore, that the CYP2D6 genotype contributes to interindividual differences in metoprolol response.", 
    "2": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether cardiovascular adaptations characteristic of long-term endurance exercise compensate more effectively during cardioselective beta(1)-adrenergic receptor blockade-induced reductions in sympathoadrenergic-stimulated contractility. Endurance-trained (ET) athletes (n = 8) and average-trained (AT; n = 8) subjects performed submaximal cycling exercise at moderate [45% maximum oxygen uptake (Vo(2max))] and heavy (70% Vo(2max)) workloads, with and without metoprolol. Cardiac output (Qc), heart rate (HR), and systolic blood pressure were recorded at rest and during exercise. Cardiac work was calculated from the triple product of HR, stroke volume, and systolic blood pressure, and myocardial efficiency is represented as cardiac work for a given total body oxygen consumption. Metoprolol reduced Qc at 45% Vo(2max) (P = 0.004) and 70% Vo(2max) (P = 0.022) in ET subjects, but did not alter Qc in the AT subjects. In ET subjects at 45% Vo(2max), metoprolol-induced reductions in Qc were a result of decreases in HR (P < 0.05) and the absence of a compensatory increase in stroke volume (P > 0.05). The cardiac work and calculated cardiac efficiency were reduced with metoprolol in ET subjects at both exercise intensities and in the AT subjects during the high-intensity workload (P < 0.01). The cardiac work and the calculated cardiac efficiency were not affected by metoprolol in the AT subjects during the 45% Vo(2max) exercise. Therefore, in AT subjects, beta-blockade reduced the amount of pressure generation necessary to produce the same amount of work during moderate-intensity exercise. In patients with heart disease receiving metoprolol, a decrease in the generation of cardiac pressure necessary to perform a given amount of work during mild-to-moderate exercise would prove to be beneficial.", 
    "3": "Insulin resistance is prevalent in heart failure (HF) patients, and beta2 adrenergic receptors (beta2-AR) are involved in glucose homeostasis. We hypothesized that beta2-AR Gln27Glu and Arg16Gly polymorphisms affect insulin resistance in HF patients, and we explored if effects of beta2-AR polymorphisms on glucose handling are modified by choice of beta blocker. We studied 30 nondiabetic adults with HF and a history of systolic dysfunction; 15 were receiving metoprolol succinate, and 15 were receiving carvedilol. We measured fasting glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance, and we determined beta2-AR genotypes at codons 27 and 16. The cohort was insulin resistant with a mean HOMA-IR score of 3.4 (95% CI, 2.3 to 4.5; normal value, 1.0). Patients with the Glu27Glu genotype exhibited higher insulin and HOMA-IR compared to individuals carrying a Gln allele (P = 0.019). Patients taking carvedilol demonstrated lower insulin resistance if also carrying a wild-type allele at codon 27 (fasting insulin, 9.8 +/- 10.5 versus 20.5 +/- 2.1 for variant, P = 0.072; HOMA-IR, 2.4 +/- 2.7 versus 5.1 +/- 0.6, P = 0.074); those on metoprolol succinate had high insulin resistance irrespective of genotype. The beta2-AR Glu27Glu genotype may be associated with higher insulin concentrations and insulin resistance in patients with HF. Future studies are needed to confirm whether treatment with carvedilol may be associated with decreased insulin and insulin resistance in beta2-AR codon 27 Gln carriers.",

The cardiac parameters were significantly increased in all the genotype groups during treadmill exercise test done for a period of 9 minutes. During predrug treadmill exercise at the end of third and sixth minute, Gly49Gly showed a higher increase in heart rate and volume of oxygen consumption compared to Ser49Ser. Same group showed a higher increase of volume of oxygen consumption at the end of ninth minute of exercise compared to the Ser49Ser. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were not different between Ser49Gly polymorphisms. However, there was no statistical difference between the genotype groups of both polymorphisms at any stage of post-drug treadmill exercise. The analysis of combination of genotypes showed no significant difference during predrug and postdrug exercise testing.",

    "8": "Metoprolol is a selective beta(1)-adrenergic antagonist extensively used since 1975. Metoprolol has proven its efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with hypertension and coronary heart disease. A recently developed controlled release/ extended-release formulation of metoprolol succinate was designed to provide relatively constant metoprolol plasma concentrations and beta(1)-blockade while retaining the convenience of once daily administration. A 100-mg metoprolol controlled/extended-release tablet contains 95 mg of metoprolol succinate and is considered to have equivalent activity of 100 mg metoprolol tartrate. After ingestion, the tablet disintegrates into individual pellets and each pellet acts as a diffusion cell releasing the drug at a relatively constant rate over a period of approximately 20 hours. The aim of this review was to determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of metoprolol succinate and to apply those properties in combination with other drugs mainly diuretics in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "9": "Essential hypertension is a heterogeneous multifactorial disease. Data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey and from the World Health Organization have clearly demonstrated that, worldwide, less than 30% of hypertensive patients are adequately controlled by our currently accepted blood pressure goals. Although monotherapy is often unable to achieve blood pressure goals, the use of fixed low-dose combination drugs as alternative treatment seems to be related to a better antihypertensive efficacy and higher response rates in the low range of doses as the result of complementary mechanisms of antihypertensive effects. Indeed clinical trials have shown that initial low-dose combination therapy is superior as compared with treatment by the stepped-care and the sequential monotherapy approach, while recently, low-dose combination therapy for initial antihypertensive therapy instead of the stepped-care approach or of sequential monotherapy has been recommended. This review summarizes the beneficial effect of low-dose bisoprolol/ hydrochlorothiazide combination in the treatment of patients with stage I and II hypertension.", 
    "10": "In this paper we evaluate a modified approach to the traditional single-pass intestinal perfusion (SPIP) rat model in investigating segmental-dependent permeability along the intestine following oral drug administration. Whereas in the traditional model one single segment of the intestine is perfused, we have simultaneously perfused three individual segments of each rat intestine: proximal jejunum, mid-small intestine and distal ileum, enabling to obtain tripled data from each rat compared to the traditional model. Three drugs, with different permeabilities, were utilized to evaluate the model: metoprolol, propranolol and cimetidine. Data was evaluated in comparison to the traditional method. Metoprolol and propranolol showed similar P(eff) values in the modified model in all segments. Segmental-dependent permeability was obtained for cimetidine, with lower P(eff) in the distal parts. Similar P(eff) values for all drugs were obtained in the traditional method, illustrating that the modified model is as accurate as the traditional, throughout a wide range of permeability characteristics, whether the permeability is constant or segment-dependent along the intestine. Three-fold higher statistical power to detect segmental-dependency was obtained in the modified approach, as each subject serves as his own control. In conclusion, the Triple SPIP model can reduce the number of animals utilized in segmental-dependent permeability research without compromising the quality of the data obtained.", 
    "11": "Previous evidence indicates that stress hormone effects on memory consolidation depend on concurrent emotional arousal-induced noradrenergic activity. Here, we asked whether this is also true for stress effects on memory retrieval and hypothesized that administration of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol would block the effects of stress on declarative and procedural retrieval performance. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 44 healthy young men learned a list of emotional and neutral words (declarative memory task) and completed a serial reaction time task (procedural memory task). On the following day, participants received either a placebo or 40 mg propranolol orally. One hour later, they were exposed to stress (socially evaluated cold pressor test (SECPT)) or a control condition 30 min prior to retention testing. Stress selectively enhanced the retrieval of emotionally arousing words. Pretreatment with propranolol had no effect on memory alone but blocked the stress-induced memory enhancement for emotional words, confirming the importance of noradrenergic activity in stress effects on memory retrieval. Memory for neutral words and the procedural task was neither affected by stress nor by propranolol. The present findings suggest that stress (hormone) effects on emotional memory retrieval require concurrent noradrenergic activation. Procedural memory retrieval and the retrieval of neutral verbal material appear to be less susceptible to stress.",

    "16": "The effects and plausible mechanism of action of Curcuma aeruginosa Roxb. (Zingiberaceae) rhizome chloroform and methanol extracts on the uterine contraction were investigated using isolated uterus strips from estrogen primed rats. The contractile responses were recorded isometrically with a Grass FT03 force transducer connected to a MacLab system. The experiments were carried out on both nonstimulated, agonist- and KCl-stimulated uteri. In the nonstimulated uterus, the two extracts (10-400 microg/ml) had no significant effect. In contrast, in the stimulated uterus, the chloroform and methanol extracts exerted concentration-dependent inhibition of the contractions induced by oxytocin (1 mU/ml), prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha, 0.5 microg/ml), ACh (3x10(-6) M) and KCl (40 mM) with the IC50 (inhibition of force) of 31.4, 58.59, 56.21 and 29.28 microg/ml; and 57.79, 69.3, 223.8 and 69.19 microg/ml, respectively. Verapamil, the reference L-type calcium channel blocker, exhibited a similar pattern of inhibition with the IC50 of 0.03, 0.25, 0.35 and 0.04 microg/ml. The IC50 of diclofenac against a PGF2alpha-induced contraction was 31.36 microg/ml. It is known that the contraction induced by agonists and KCl is mainly due to calcium influx through the voltage-gated L-type calcium channels opened indirectly or directly by agonist-receptor activation and KCl. Thus, it is speculated that the two plant extracts might inhibit uterine contraction by interrupting the influx of Ca2+ probably through voltage-gated L-type calcium channels. This possibility was further substantiated by the ability of the extracts to shift the CaCl2-contraction curves to the right. As the methanol extract also reduced the contraction of oxytocin in Ca2+-free EDTA solution; thus, it is suggested that part of its action may be involved with an intracellular mechanism. The effect of the two extracts did not involve the activation of beta2-adrenoceptors since their effects were unaffected by propranolol. Based on the inhibitory effect of the extracts on the oxytocin-induced contraction, it is concluded that the extracts might be useful as tocolytic agents for the prevention of preterm labor. Their effects on the inhibition of PGF2alpha-induced contractions also seem useful for the treatment of dysmenorrhea. There are reports by others that the plant rhizome contains beta-pinene and sesquiterpenes. In addition, there is evidence that these compounds possess spasmolytic effects in the rat intestine and uterus. Therefore, the uterine relaxant effect of the plant extracts could be due to beta-pinene and some sesquiterpene lactones contents. The methanol extract is less potent than the chloroform extract, and this might be due to the lower amount of terpene compounds or different compounds may involve in this action.", 
    "17": "Aqueous humor flow, one of the primary determinants of intraocular pressure, has been measured non-invasively in the human eye since the early 1950s. Other than sleep, which decreases flow rate to approximately half of what it is during alert wakefulness, few conditions affect flow rate. Three classes of medication can suppress flow and have been used therapeutically, beta-adrenergic antagonists, alpha(2)-adrenergic agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Studies of the production and circulation of aqueous humor have provided a basis for understanding the fundamental dynamics of the eye as well as understanding treatments for glaucoma.",

As the number of baby boomers continues to grow and the incidence of heart failure increases, the financial implications of ADHF treatment will become more prominent. Obtaining institutional support and developing a good working relationship with cardiology colleagues is vital to creating workable ADHF protocols for whichever type of OU an institution decides to use.", 
    "19": "Heart failure (HF) guidelines recommend that beta blockers be titrated to achieve the target doses shown to be effective in major clinical trials, if tolerated. Little is known, however, regarding the doses of beta blockers used in patients with HF in routine clinical practice before, during, and after hospitalization for HF. The Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) enrolled 5,791 patients admitted with HF in a registry with prespecified 60- to 90-day follow-up at 91 academic and community hospitals throughout the United States. Among 2,373 patients with systolic HF eligible for beta blockers at discharge, 1,350 (56.9%) were receiving beta-blocker therapy before admission and continued on therapy, and 632 (26.6%) were newly started. The mean total daily dose for beta blockers before hospital admission was <1/2 the recommended target dose (carvedilol 21.5 +/- 17.8 mg and metoprolol succinate 69.2 +/- 51.9 mg), with infrequent up- or down-titration during the HF hospitalization. More than 2/3 of patients had no change in their beta-blocker doses in the first 60 to 90 days after hospital discharge. At 60- to 90-day postdischarge follow-up, only 17.5% and 7.9% of patients were being treated with recommended target doses of carvedilol and metoprolol succinate, respectively. In conclusion, these data reveal that the doses of beta blockers applied in clinical practice are substantially less that the doses achieved in randomized clinical trials in HF and recommended in national guidelines. In the first 60 to 90 days after hospital discharge, little up-titration in beta-blocker dosing occurs. Further efforts are needed to help understand and overcome this beta-blocker titration gap.", 
    "20": "Sustained ventricular arrhythmias and heart failure are well-recognized complications after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and have been associated with worse outcomes and increased mortality. The use of and outcomes associated with acute beta-blocker therapy in patients with AMI complicated by sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) and heart failure were investigated. Of 5,391 patients in the VALIANT Registry, sustained VT/VF occurred in 306 (5.7%), with an in-hospital mortality rate of 20.3%. Multivariable logistic regression identified sustained VT/VF as a major predictor of in-hospital death (relative risk 4.18, 95% confidence interval 2.91 to 5.93). Of those with sustained VT/VF, 55.2% were treated with intravenous or oral beta blockade in the first 24 hours. After adjusting for baseline characteristics, propensity for acute beta-blocker use, and the interaction between Killip classification and beta-blocker therapy, beta-blocker therapy within 24 hours was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality in patients with sustained VT/VF (relative risk 0.28, 95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.75, p = 0.013) without evidence of worsening heart failure. Patients with sustained VT/VF were less likely to receive beta blockers within 24 hours (p = 0.001). In conclusion, sustained VT/VF was common after AMI. In patients with sustained VT/VF, beta-blocker therapy in the first 24 hours after AMI was associated with decreased early mortality without worsening heart failure. Unfortunately, beta blockers were underused acutely in patients with sustained VT/VF.", 
    "21": "Of the more than 5 million Americans who have heart failure (HF), 30% to 50% have HF with preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF). HF-PEF commonly occurs in elderly patients, especially women, with comorbidities of hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, diabetes, myocardial ischemia, and obesity. HF-PEF is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Although two large multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluating an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in patients with HF-PEF did not demonstrate any statistically significant benefit in their primary end points, they did suggest that these agents may have a modest role in reducing HF hospitalizations. Although calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers may be of benefit in patients with HF-PEF, large clinical trial data are not available to support their routine use in all patients with HF-PEF. Subgroup analysis does not support the use of digoxin in patients with HF-PEF in sinus rhythm. Current therapeutic recommendations for HF-PEF are aimed at 1) management of HF symptoms with sodium and fluid restriction along with diuretics for volume overload and 2) treatment of concomitant comorbidities, especially hypertension, rate and possibly rhythm control of atrial fibrillation, and evaluation and treatment of myocardial ischemia and anemia. ACEIs, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers are recommended for HF-PEF patients who have other established indications for their use. Results are awaited from ongoing clinical trials with another ARB, irbesartan, and an aldosterone blocker, spironolactone.",

    "50": "Left ventricular (LV) remodelling remains an important treatment target in patients after myocardial infarction (MI) and chronic heart failure (CHF). Accumulating evidence has supported the concept that beneficial effects of current pharmacological treatment strategies to improve the prognosis in these patients, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker therapy, and beta-blocker therapy, are related, at least in part, to their effects on LV remodelling and dysfunction. However, despite modern reperfusion therapy after MI and optimized treatment of patients with CHF, LV remodelling is observed in a substantial proportion of patients and is associated with an adverse clinical outcome. These observations call for novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or even reverse cardiac remodelling. Recent insights from experimental studies have provided new targets for interventions to prevent or reverse LV remodelling, i.e. reduced endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase-derived NO availability, activation of cardiac and leukocyte-dependent oxidant stress pathways, inflammatory pathway activation, matrix-metalloproteinase activation, or stem cell transfer and delivery of novel paracrine factors. An important challenge in translating these observations from preclinical studies into clinical treatment strategies relates to the fact that clinical studies are designed on top of established pharmacological therapy, whereas most experimental studies have tested novel interventions without concomitant drug regimens such as ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers. Therefore, animal studies may overestimate the effect of potential novel treatment strategies on LV remodelling and dysfunction, since established pharmacological therapies may act, in part, via identical or similar signalling pathways. Nevertheless, preclinical studies provide essential information for identifying potential novel targets, and their potential drawbacks, and are required for developing novel clinical treatment strategies to prevent or reverse LV remodelling and dysfunction.",

In-keeping with this, it has been observed that hypertension-induced LVH increases the risk of sudden cardiac death. Furthermore, a consistent bulk of data suggests antihypertensive therapy targeted at regression or prevention of electrocardiographic LVH may reduce the incidence of arrhythmias. In this regard, recent clinical trials showed that antihypertensive therapy may delay or prevent the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients with hypertension. Porthan et al. hypothesized that an antihypertensive therapy might also rapidly affect ventricular repolarization and sought to investigate the short-term electrophysiological effects of four common antihypertensive drugs, represented by an angiotensin II receptor blocker (losartan), a beta-blocker (bisoprolol), a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) and a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) in hypertensive men. Porthan et al. showed that losartan and bisoprolol favorably affected ventricular repolarization, with beneficial effects on ECG parameters of ventricular repolarization duration and heterogeneity. On the contrary, hydrochlorothiazide significantly increased repolarization heterogeneity, while amlodipine administration did not affect ECG repolarization measures.

Four groups of 20 SHR each were involved: (1) control group: SHR; (2) ADR group: SHR treated with ADR (2mg/kg i.v. twice in 20 days); (3) ADR-C group: SHR treated with ADR and carvedilol (30 mg/kg/day) and (4) ADR-CC group: SHR treated with ADR and carvedilol (30 mg/kg/day) and captopril (60 mg/kg/day). Systolic-, diastolic- and mean-pressures and pulse pressure were determined at weeks 6 and 12 after the second ADR injection; and body weight, creatinine clearance and proteinuria at weeks -3, 6 and 12. The rats were sacrificed at week 6 or 12, the weights of the left and right ventricles and kidneys measured and the kidney vascular index was calculated as described by Bader and Mayer. Both carvedilol alone and combined with captopril significantly reduced systemic blood pressure but the effect of the latter was more pronounced and registered from week 4 till the end of the study.

Significant positive correlations were found between PP (but not SBP, DBP and MAP) and both proteinuria and Ccr in all groups of rats.

Scopolamine (0.6-1.2 mg/kg; i.p.) treatment impaired the acquisition of CS1-US and CS1-CS2 associations, and also disrupted the expression of conditioned fear responses when injected prior to the CS1 test session. These findings have pointed out the usefulness for the olfactory fear conditioning paradigm to investigate drug effects on the acquisition, consolidation and expression of fear conditioned responses.",

The analytes and IS were extracted in methyl tert-butyl ether, separated on Hypurity C8 column and detected by tandem mass spectrometry with a turbo ion spray interface. The method had a chromatographic run time of 3.0 min and linear calibration curves over the concentration range of 0.25-25 ng/mL for alfuzosin and 0.6-60 ng/mL for solifenacin. The intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision (%CV) evaluated at four quality control levels were within 88.2-106.4% and 0.9-7.7% respectively. The absolute recovery from spiked plasma samples was 71.8% for alfuzosin and 93.1% for solifenacin. Stability of alfuzosin and solifenacin was assessed under different storage conditions. The validated method was successfully employed for bioavailability study after oral administration of 10 mg of alfuzosin hydrochloride and 5mg of solifenacin succinate tablet formulations in eight healthy volunteers under fed condition.",

Along with clinical examination, a number of scales: Clinical rating scale for tremor, scale of functional disturbances and Visual-analogous scale have been administered. The efficacy of topiramate was comparable to that of propranolol in 83% and 75% cases, respectively. However topiramate has some therapeutic advantages compared to propranolol; it may be prescribed for all clinical forms regardless of sex (its efficacy is higher in women), age and illness duration, both in earlier and later onset, familial and sporadic variants of ET (propranolol is more effective in patients with family history of ET). Moreover, in contrast to propranolol, topiramate may be prescribed to patients with predisposition to arterial hypertension and bradicardia, bronchial spasms of diabetes mellitus and heart rhythm disturbances.",

In an additional 4 hearts, action potential duration (APD), conduction velocity, and wavelength (WL) restitutions were determined. During d,l-sotalol infusion, VF was terminated in 3 of the 6 hearts. Only 1 heart developed transient ventricular tachycardia (VT). d,l-Sotalol reduced the number of phase singularities (ie, wavebreak) during VF (P<0.05), and it also increased the occurrence frequency (P<0.05) and lifespan (P<0.05) of epicardial reentry during VF. These reentries were non-stationary in nature and did not anchor on anatomical structures. Restitution data showed that d,l-sotalol flattened APD restitution. Furthermore, APD dispersion and spatial heterogeneity of restitutions were not enhanced by d,l-sotalol.", 
    "114": "d,l-Sotalol at therapeutic concentrations decreased wavebreak and facilitated the occurrence of long-lasting, non-stationary reentry during VF. However, VT rarely occurred. The related mechanisms include: (1) flattening of APD restitution without enhancement of spatial heterogeneity of electrophysiological properties, causing wavefront organization, and (2) WL prolongation, preventing steady anchoring of reentry.",

At analytical scale, the retention factor of both enantiomers is less than 5 with the separation factor 1.95 and the resolution 2.4. Then, the analytical method is scaled up to semipreparative loading to obtain small amounts of both propranolol hydrochloride enantiomers. Petroleum ether, rather than n-hexane, is used to effectively reduce the production cost of (R)- and (S)-propranolol. To increase the throughput, overlapping injections are used, allowing an injection to be made every 6.5 min instead of every 12 min. At semipreparative scale, approximately 19 mg/h enantiomers are isolated. The first fraction [(R)-(+)-propranolol hydrochloride] is isolated with a purity of > 99.6% (e.e.) and > 97.0% yield, and the second [(S)-(-)-propranolol hydrochloride] is isolated with a purity of > 99.3% (e.e.) and > 95.0% yield.

The parameters that were optimized include pH, buffer type, and concentration of surfactant. The results indicated that the optimum conditions for enantiomeric separations with the amino acid based polymeric surfactants examined in this study using CE were analyte dependent, not surfactant dependent. In other words, the optimum conditions for a particular analyte were the same for all the amino acid based polymeric surfactants examined in this study. The results of these studies indicate that when using a large group of related amino acid based polymeric surfactants only a few surfactants need to be optimized for each analyte under study. These studies were limited to anionic surfactants that contain the amino acids glycine, L-alanine, L-valine, and L-leucine only. No inference can be necessarily drawn about surfactants containing other types of amino acids such as threonine and serine, which contain extra heteroatoms, or phenylalanine that has an aromatic moiety.",

    "122": "Labetalol is clinically available as a mixture of two racemates (four stereoisomers). The stereoisomer (R,R) has as main activity the beta1-antagonism and the stereoisomer (S,R) is highly selective for the alpha1 adrenoceptor and is responsible for most of the alpha-blocker activity. In the present investigation, a method for the analysis of labetalol stereoisomers in human plasma was developed and applied to pharmacokinetic studies. Plasma samples (0.5 ml) were extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether at pH 9.5. The four labetalol stereoisomers were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a Chirobiotic V column using a mobile phase consisting of methanol, acetic acid, and diethylamine, with a recovery of more than 90% for all four. The quantitation limit was 0.5 ng/ml and linearity was observed at 250 ng/ml plasma for each stereoisomer. Studies of precision and accuracy presented coefficients of variation and percentage inaccuracy of less than 15%, indicating that the method is precise and accurate. The method was applied to the study of the kinetic disposition of labetalol over a period of 12 h after oral administration of a single 100 mg dose to a hypertensive pregnant woman. The clinical study revealed stereoselectivity in the pharmacokinetics of labetalol, with a lower plasma proportion for the active stereoisomers (R,R)-labetalol and (S,R)-labetalol. The stereoselectivity observed after oral administration is due to the hepatic metabolism and the first pass effect, with an AUC(R,R)/AUC(S,S) ratio of 0.5.", 
    "123": "Acting through a low-affinity site of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor (beta(1L)AR), CGP12177 causes sinoatrial tachycardia and positive inotropic effects in left atrium but not in the ventricle of the rat. However, inhibition of either PDE3 or PDE4 also uncovers positive inotropic effects of CGP12177 in ventricle, but whether these phosphodiesterases also control the atrial agonist effects of CGP12177 was unknown. We, therefore, investigated the effects of the PDE3-selective inhibitor cilostamide (300 nM) and PDE4 inhibitor rolipram (1 microM) on the (-)-CGP12177-evoked increases of sinoatrial beating rate and force of paced left atria of the rat. Rolipram (n = 8) increased basal sinoatrial rate by 27 +/- 5 bpm but cilostamide (n = 8) had no effect. The chronotropic potency of (-)-CGP12177 (-logEC(50)M = 7.5) was not changed by rolipram and cilostamide or their combination. (-)-CGP12177 increased left atrial force with intrinsic activity 0.25 compared to (-)-isoprenaline. Rolipram (n = 8) and cilostamide (n = 8) did not change basal force of left atria but concurrent rolipram + cilostamide (n = 8) increased force by 52 +/- 9% of the effect of 200 microM (-)-isoprenaline. Neither rolipram nor cilostamide affected the inotropic potency of (-)-CGP12177 (-logEC(50)M = 7.4) but concurrent rolipram + cilostamide caused potentiation (-logEC(50)M = 8.2) and converted (-)-CGP12177 into a full agonist compared to (-)-isoprenaline. Cyclic AMP appears to maintain sinoatrial rate and PDE4 elicits bradycardia through hydrolysis of cAMP in a compartment distinct from the beta(1L)AR-induced cAMP compartment through which (-)-CGP12177 causes tachycardia. In contrast to the (-)-CGP12177-evoked tachycardia, not controlled by PDE3 and PDE4, these isoenzymes jointly reduce (-)-CGP12177-evoked increases of left atrial contractility through beta(1L)AR.",

The cells showed a fibroblast-like morphology, but the morphology changed after 5-azacytidine exposure. They began spontaneous beating after 2 weeks, and expressed ANP and BNP. Electron microscopy revealed a cardiomyocyte-like ultrastructure. These cells had several types of action potentials; sinus node-like and ventricular cell-like action potentials. The isoform of contractile protein genes indicated that their muscle phenotype was similar to fetal ventricular cardiomyocytes. They expressed alpha(1A), alpha(1B), alpha(1D), beta(1), and beta(2) adrenergic and M(1) and M(2) muscarinic receptors. Stimulation with phenylephrine, isoproterenol and carbachol increased ERK phosphorylation and second messengers. Isoproterenol increased the beating rate, which was blocked with CGP20712A (beta(1)-selective blocker).

Cymarin--a cardiac glycoside--was also determined in A. venetum extracts by LC-MS/MS analysis. All extracts examined here showed a weak cardiotonic effect, i.e., induced a contractile response of the isolated atria and increased the pulse at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, which was not inhibited by propranolol (1 microM)-a beta-adrenoceptor blocker. The cymarin content in extracts of A. venetum was ranked as follows: old stem > stem > root > leaf > Venetron. Since the cardiotonic effects of A. venetum extracts did not reflect the cymarin content, a possible mechanism other than that of cardiac glycosides was investigated. The inhibitory effects on phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) were studied in a cell-free enzyme assay; all extracts of various parts of A. venetum inhibited PDE purified from human platelets. These results suggest that PDE3 inhibition may contribute to the cardiotonic effects of A. venetum extracts.",

Pertinent history revealed that he took drugs containing triiodothyronine (64 mug) and propranolol (40 mg) twice daily for weight reduction in the past month and discontinued these drugs 3 days before admission. Physical examination showed systolic hypertension (160/76 mm Hg), relative tachycardia (98 bpm), and symmetrical flaccid paralysis of all extremities. The most striking laboratory finding was severe hypokalemia (1.6 mmol/L) with low urinary potassium excretion and normal blood acid-base status, suggesting acute potassium shifting into cells. Approximately, 174 mmol of potassium chloride was administrated to restore his muscle strength within 12 hours, but rebound hyperkalemia (6.1 mmol/L) developed upon recovery. Despite normal serum free triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels, the suppressed concentration of thyroid stimulating hormone indicated hyperthyroidism. The low radioiodine uptake (4%) and serum thyroglobulin level (2 ng/mL) were consistent with thyrotoxicosis factitia. This is the first reported case of exogenous triiodothyronine-induced thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, which may have been precipitated by the withdrawal of propranolol.",

Either reducing the Abeta in the medium by antibody binding or decreasing Abeta production by gamma secretase inhibitor treatment could significantly depress CCE in APPswe cells. The results demonstrated that the CCE potentiation in APPswe cells was caused by Abeta over-expression. Our research also revealed that the effect of Abeta on CCE potentiation could be decreased by Abeta channel blocker, which showed that the channels formed by Abeta are one of the ways through which Abeta causes CCE potentiation.",

The most commonly used, and generally most effective, medications for essential tremor are propranolol and primidone, administered either as monotherapy or in combination. If these medications do not provide satisfactory control of tremor, other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as metoprolol or atenolol, and other antiepileptic drugs, such as topiramate or gabapentin, are often tried. In addition, benzodiazepines can be effective in some patients, particularly those with associated anxiety. There is a need for additional medications that result in greater tremor control in a larger number of patients with essential tremor.

The reaction mixtures were analysed by LC-MS, the reaction products were isolated by preparative HPLC, and the structures were elucidated by microprobe NMR spectroscopy. Heating a mixture of solid carvedilol and solid citric acid monohydrate for 96 h at 50 degrees C resulted in the formation of about 3% of a symmetrical ester as well as of a number of other reaction products in smaller amounts. Formation of the symmetrical ester was also observed at room temperature. At 70 degrees C, the amounts of three isomeric esters formed reached 6-8%. The minor reaction products were citric acid amides, O-acetylcarvedilol, and esters of itaconic acid.",

Two unusual products 2-(4-(3-(chloro(2-chloropropan-2-yl)amino)-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl) acetamide and 2-(4-(3-formamido-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl) acetamide were obtained along with 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamide. When the reaction was stopped at shorter times only 2-(4-(3-amino-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl) acetamide and the dichlorinated product were detected. Tests performed on the seeds of Lactuca sativa show that chlorinated products have phytotoxic activity.", 
    "159": "In vivo microdialysis was used to study the effects of the locally applied selective noradrenaline uptake inhibitor reboxetine on the baseline noradrenaline and dopamine efflux in the nucleus accumbens of freely moving rats. The effects of intra-accumbal infusion of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist l-propranolol on the reboxetine-elicited noradrenaline and dopamine efflux in the nucleus accumbens were also analysed. The intra-accumbal infusion of reboxetine (1.2 and 12 pmol) significantly increased both the accumbal noradrenaline efflux and the accumbal dopamine efflux. The intra-accumbal infusion of the chosen doses of l-propranolol (300 and 1200 pmol) did not alter the accumbal noradrenaline and dopamine efflux. The l-propranolol treatment did not affect the reboxetine-elicited accumbal noradrenaline efflux, but it significantly inhibited the reboxetine-elicited increase of accumbal dopamine efflux. The doses mentioned are the total amount of drug over the infusion period that varied across the drugs (60 or 120 min). The present study shows that the intra-accumbal infusion of selective noradrenaline uptake inhibitor reboxetine increases noradrenaline as well as dopamine efflux in the nucleus accumbens of freely moving rats. This study also indicates that inhibition of accumbal beta-adrenoceptors prevented the increase of the reboxetine-induced accumbal dopamine efflux. It is suggested that the reboxetine-induced increase of the endogenous accumbal noradrenaline activates among others accumbal beta-adrenoceptors that, in turn, stimulate the accumbal release of dopamine.",

However, these studies were conducted before the incorporation of beta blockers as standard therapy for patients with HF. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of digoxin in patients with HF on a contemporary regimen of renin-angiotensin inhibition and beta blockade. In 347 almost exclusively men, data pertaining to the index hospitalization and occurrence of all-cause mortality or readmission for HF were collected. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used. Patients on digoxin therapy had a lower left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF), higher prevalence of previous hospitalizations for HF and atrial fibrillation, and lower prevalence of hypertension. After adjustment for age, LVEF, history of HF hospitalizations, New York Heart Association class, presence of chronic renal insufficiency, presence of atrial fibrillation, and prescriptions for beta blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, HF hospitalizations (hazard ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.50, p = 0.66), total mortality (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35, p = 0.85), or the combined end point of HF hospitalization and total mortality (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.53, p = 0.52) were not different in patients using digoxin compared with those not using digoxin. Clinical outcomes were not different in subgroups of patients with EF < or =25%, New York Heart Association class III or IV, atrial fibrillation, heart rate < or =60 beats/min, or patients on beta-blocker therapy. In conclusion, digoxin use was not associated with a decrease in HF hospitalizations or overall mortality rates in a cohort of hospitalized patients with HF with LV systolic dysfunction on contemporary background HF treatment including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers.",

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of EA-DSE and the effects of the long-term use of beta blockers on it. A retrospective evaluation of 844 patients who underwent EA-DSE for known or suspected CAD was performed; 309 (37%) were receiving beta blockers. During a median follow-up period of 24 months, 102 events (12%) occurred. On univariate analysis, predictors of events were the ejection fraction (p <0.001), male gender (p <0.001), previous myocardial infarction (p <0.001), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy (p = 0.021), calcium channel blocker therapy (p = 0.034), and abnormal results on EA-DSE (p <0.001). On multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of events were male gender (relative risk [RR] 1.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13 to 2.81, p = 0.013) and abnormal results on EA-DSE (RR 4.45, 95% CI 2.84 to 7.01, p <0.0001). Normal results on EA-DSE with beta blockers were associated with a nonsignificant higher incidence of events than normal results on EA-DSE without beta blockers (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.87, p = 0.54). Abnormal results on EA-DSE with beta blockers had an RR of 4.97 (95% CI 2.79 to 8.87, p <0.001) compared with normal results, while abnormal results on EA-DSE without beta blockers had an RR of 5.96 (95% CI 3.41 to 10.44, p <0.001) for events, with no difference between groups (p = 0.36). In conclusion, the detection of fixed or inducible wall motion abnormalities during EA-DSE was an independent predictor of long-term events in patients with known or suspected CAD. The prognostic value of EA-DSE was not affected by the long-term use of beta blockers.", 
    "166": "Cognitive impairment and weak intellectual capacity is a gradually progressive neurodegenerative problem. Growing evidences indicate that oxidants and antioxidant defenses interact in a vicious cycle, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction. The present study was carried out to elucidate the neuroprotective effect of carvedilol against the colchicine-induced cognitive impairment and oxidative damage in rats. Colchicine (15 microg/5 microl), a microtubule disrupting agent when administered intracerebroventricularly in rats resulted in poor memory retention in both Morris water maze, elevated plus maze task paradigms and caused marked oxidative stress as indicated by significant increase in malondialdehyde, nitrite levels, depletion of SOD, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase activity and reduced glutathione levels. It also caused a significant decrease in the acetylcholinesterase activity. Chronic administration of carvedilol (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg; p.o.) for a period of 25 days, starting 4 days prior to colchicine administration resulted in an improvement in memory retention, attenuation of oxidative damage and restoration of acetylcholinesterase activity.

Greatest decrease of frequency of episodes of ST-segment depression was observed during therapy with heart rate reducing calcium antagonists. Disturbed LV diastolic function improved under action of calcium antagonists and beta-adrenoblockers did not change during therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Diminishment of severity of disturbance of diastolic function under influence of pulse slowing calcium antagonists was associated in the first place with augmentation of LV filling in the first phase of diastole, but during therapy with amlodipine and beta-adrenoblockers - with decrease of contribution of systole of the left atrium. beta-adrenoblockers and diltiazem improved LV diastolic function in patients with episodes of painless myocardial ischemia.",

    "182": "Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We recently reported that the redox state of the methionine residue in position 35 of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) 1-42 (Met35) strongly affects the peptide's ability to trigger apoptosis and is thus a major determinant of its neurotoxicity. Dysregulation of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis resulting in the activation of pro-apoptotic pathways has been proposed as a mechanism underlying Abeta toxicity. Therefore, we investigated correlations between the Met35 redox state, Abeta toxicity, and altered intracellular Ca(2+) signaling in human neuroblastoma IMR32 cells. Cells incubated for 6-24 h with 10 microM Abeta1-42 exhibited significantly increased KCl-induced Ca(2+) transient amplitudes and resting free Ca(2+) concentrations. Nifedipine-sensitive Ca(2+) current densities and Ca(v)1 channel expression were markedly enhanced by Abeta1-42. None of these effects were observed when cells were exposed to Abeta containing oxidized Met35 (Abeta1-42(Met35-Ox)). Cell pre-treatment with the intracellular Ca(2+) chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (1 microM) or the Ca(v)1 channel blocker nifedipine (5 microM) significantly attenuated Abeta1-42-induced apoptosis but had no effect on Abeta1-42(Met35-Ox) toxicity. Collectively, these data suggest that reduced Met35 plays a critical role in Abeta1-42 toxicity by rendering the peptide capable of disrupting intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and thereby provoking apoptotic cell death.",

Reabsorption of alveolar edema fluid (alveolar fluid clearance) has been considered to play an important role in resolution of acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, little is known regarding alveolar fluid clearance in diabetes mellitus. Since the obese Zucker rat has been used as an experimental model for diabetes mellitus, we determined if alveolar fluid clearance increased in the obese Zucker rat. First, we compared alveolar fluid clearance in obese Zucker rats with that in lean Zucker rats and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Then, we determined the role of sodium channel, Na,K-ATPase, and beta(2)-adrenoceptor, which drives alveolar fluid clearance, in obese Zucker rats. Alveolar fluid clearance was estimated by the progressive increase in alveolar albumin concentrations in the isolated lungs. We found that basal alveolar fluid clearance in obese Zucker rats was two-fold greater than that in lean Zucker rats and SD rats. The mRNA expression of alpha(1)-, beta(1)-Na, K-ATPase and beta(2)-adrenoceptor, but not mRNA expression of sodium channel, increased in obese Zucker rats. A selective beta(2)-agrenergic antagonist, but not a Na, K-ATPase inhibitor, specifically inhibited the increase in alveolar fluid clearance in obese Zucker rats. These results indicate that overexpression of beta(2)-adrenoceptor primarily increases basal alveolar fluid clearance in the obese Zucker rat. We speculate that the stimulation of alveolar fluid clearance ameliorates acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with diabetes mellitus."
