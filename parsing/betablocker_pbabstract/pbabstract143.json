Few studies have been performed on the association between the beta(1) adrenoreceptor, CYP2D6 polymorphism and blood pressure. The one reported here is a prospective, observational, clinical study in Chinese Han hypertensive patients on the combined influences of CYP2D6 and beta(1) adrenoreceptor polymorphisms on the therapeutic effects of metoprolol in 300 out-patients with essential hypertension. The same dose of metoprolol achieved different therapeutic effects in patients with different CYP2D6 and beta(1) adrenoreceptor polymorphisms. Additionally, different doses of metoprolol could achieve the same therapeutic effects in patients with different CYP2D6 and beta(1) adrenoreceptor polymorphisms.

    "17": "The neuroendocrine system is most active at birth and may play a role in the transition from fetal to postnatal life, in particular in the lungs' transition from fluid secretion to fluid absorption. Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells do release dopamine (DA), serotonin, and gastrin-releasing peptide but their effects on lung ion and fluid transport are poorly understood. Therefore, we studied their effects on fetal distal lung explants and primary cultures of fetal distal lung epithelium (FDLE). We show that DA, but neither serotonin nor gastrin-releasing peptide, alters ion and fluid transport, in a dose-dependent manner. DAs effects were abrogated by D1/D2 receptor blockers in FDLE but not in explants. Propranolol abrogated DAs effects in both models. DA increased intracellular cAMP levels in FDLE. Terbutaline, forskolin, and isobutylmethylxanthine did not increase short circuit current (Isc) in DA-treated cells, despite a further increase in cAMP. We conclude that at least one, but not all mediators released by pulmonary neuroendocrine cells alter distal lung epithelial ion transport.",

The underlying causes of thyrotoxicosis may be any of the well-recognized etiologies including a toxic multinodular goiter, Graves' disease or iodine excess. Beside thyrotoxicosis, a number of other hormonal factors have been hypothesized to contribute to hypokalaemic thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, particularly postprandial hyperinsulinaemia and testosterone. We hereby present a case of a 48-year-old hepatitis C positive gender-assigned man in whom all of these factors are proposed to interact, lending further support to these hypotheses. The patient presented with interferon-induced thyroiditis causing acute generalized weakness whilst undergoing combination interferon-alpha-2beta and ribavirin therapy. As part of his hepatitis C infection, marked insulin resistance with hyperinsulinaemia was also present, exacerbating the paresis. Initial treatment with beta-blocker failed to normalize his serum potassium concentration, requiring the novel use of spironolactone, despite euthyroidism. This continued to be required until his testosterone supplement dissipated.",

Both aqueous and solid phases were analysed for the presence of 31 pharmaceuticals included in the analytical method. The most ubiquitous contaminants in the sewage water were analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen (14.6-31.3 microg/L) and acetaminophen (7.1-11.4 microg/L), antibiotic ofloxacin (0.89-31.7 microg/L), lipid regulators gemfibrozil (2.0-5.9 microg/L) and bezafibrate (1.9-29.8 microg/L), beta-blocker atenolol (0.84-2.8 microg/L), hypoglycaemic agent glibenclamide (0.12-15.9 microg/L) and a diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (2.3-4.8 microg/L). Also, several pharmaceuticals such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, ofloxacin and azithromycin were detected in sewage sludge at concentrations up to 741.1, 336.3, 380.7, 454.7 and 299.6 ng/g dry weight. Two pilot-scale MBRs exhibited enhanced elimination of several pharmaceutical residues poorly removed by the CAS treatment (e.g., mefenamic acid, indomethacin, diclofenac, propyphenazone, pravastatin, gemfibrozil), whereas in some cases more stable operation of one of the MBR reactors at prolonged SRT proved to be detrimental for the elimination of some compounds (e.g., beta-blockers, ranitidine, famotidine, erythromycin). Moreover, the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine and diuretic hydrochlorothiazide by-passed all three treatments investigated. Furthermore, sorption to sewage sludge in the MBRs as well as in the entire treatment line of a full-scale WWTP is discussed for the encountered analytes. Among the pharmaceuticals encountered in sewage sludge, sorption to sludge could be a relevant removal pathway only for several compounds (i.e., mefenamic acid, propranolol, and loratidine). Especially in the case of loratidine the experimentally determined sorption coefficients (Kds) were in the range 2214-3321 L/kg (mean). The results obtained for the solid phase indicated that MBR wastewater treatment yielding higher biodegradation rate could reduce the load of pollutants in the sludge. Also, the overall output load in the aqueous and solid phase of the investigated WWTP was calculated, indicating that none of the residual pharmaceuticals initially detected in the sewage sludge were degraded during the anaerobic digestion. Out of the 26 pharmaceutical residues passing through the WWTP, 20 were ultimately detected in the treated sludge that is further applied on farmland.",

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were assessed based on the Juni assessment. Meta-analysis was completed using software Review Manager 4.2. Indication for evaluating effect was recurrence of syncope during follow-up or response in head-up tilt test (HUT). The results were stated as relative risk (RR) or odd ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI), and P<0.05 showed significant differences.", 
    "26": "Thirteen RCTs were selected finally. Funnle polt analysis showed publication bias might exist. Meta-analysis of 11 RCTs, including totally 460 patients in treatment group and 371 patients in control group, indicated patients in treatment group had lower rate of syncope recurrence as compared with control group (RR=0.61, 95%CI: 0.39-0.96, P=0.03). From 7 RCTs, including 166 patients in treatment group and 163 in control group, meta-analysis explored that patients in treatment group had higher rate of negative response in HUT at the end-point of follow-up as compared with control group (OR=9.15, 95%CI: 3.75-22.31, P<0.01).",

    "28": "Beta blockade is associated with the onset and progression of Peyronie disease (PD). To date, there has not been a report of PD occurring with the alpha/beta blocker carvedilol. It remains unproven but likely that carvedilol was the cause of the PD in the patient described in this case. It is hypothesized that because of carvedilol's vasodilating alpha adrenergic receptor stimulation and its anti-inflammatory effect, PD occurs less frequently with carvedilol than with other beta blockers. However, in this case the protective properties of carvedilol, like vasodilation and the anti-inflammatory effect, may not be sufficient to overcome its vasoconstricting beta adrenergic receptor blockade.", 
    "29": "The permeability estimation from cell monolayer permeation data is usually based on 100% recovery assumption. However, poor recovery is often seen in such experiments in practice but often neglected in data interpretation. In the present study, the cellular retention kinetics during Caco-2 permeation experiments of three passively transported compounds, weakly basic propranolol [(+/-)-1-isopropylamino-3-(1-naphthyloxy)-2-propanol], weakly acidic ibuprofen [alpha-methyl-4-(isobutyl)phenylacetic acid], and neutral testosterone (17beta-hydroxy-4-androsten-3-one), were determined. Furthermore, the effects of cellular retention kinetics on apparent permeability were evaluated, and the role of lysosomal sequestration in cellular retention of propranolol was explored. The cellular retention profiles were observed to be direction and concentration dependent, which may cause erroneous directionality and concentration dependence in permeability estimates. Furthermore, the lysosomal sequestration was demonstrated to contribute to the extent and kinetics of the cellular retention of propranolol.",

A competition curve for timolol was biphasic in lung and its binding affinity for beta(2)-adrenoceptors was approximately 158-fold higher than for beta(1)-adrenoceptors, indicating the beta(2)-selectivity of timolol. In contrast, competition curves for stereoisomers of befunolol, carteolol, and propranolol were monophasic in all tissues. The (-)-enantiomers of these antagonists were more potent than corresponding (+)-enantiomers in displacing from [(3)H]-CGP12177 binding, and the isomeric potency ratios of befunolol and carteolol were less than those of propranolol.",

    "34": "VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS: Different factors--like hypertrophy, fibrosis, ischemia and apoptosis increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden arrhythmic death. ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin receptor antagonists offer a curative therapeutic approach. Beta-blocker are strongly recommended. Amiodarone may be used for symptomatic arrhythmia suppression--but with no proven favourable prognostic effect. The use of class-1 antiarrhythmic drugs is obsolete in the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure. Implantable cardioverter/defibrillators (ICD) have been proven to have a positive effect on survival in secondary and primary prevention of sudden cardiac death, and so has cardiac synchronization in severe cardiac dysfunction and widened QRS complex. Atrial fibrillation (AF): Arterial hypertension represents the main risk factor for AF. Patients' age, left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial dilatation and angiotensin-II activation play an important role in the induction and maintenance of AF. Angiotensin-receptor and beta-blockers seem to be efficacious in AF suppression and also on the regression of hypertrophy. The use of antiarrhythmic agents (AA) is limited because of their relatively low long-term efficacy and pro-arrhythmia properties. Best results may be achieved with class 1C AA drugs in patients with no or minimal structural heart disease. In all other cases amiodarone is suitable but is limited by its side effects. In patients with no or only a few symptoms rate control may be sufficient, but if there are symptoms interventional left atrial ablation of pulmonary veins should be attempted as a real curative strategy.", 
    "35": "An improved multiple co-polymerization technique was developed to prepare a novel molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)-coated solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber with propranolol as template. Investigation was performed for the characteristics and application of the fibers. The MIP coating was highly crosslinked and porous with the average thickness of only 25.0 microm. Consequently, the adsorption and desorption of beta-blockers within the MIP coating could be achieved quickly. The specific selectivity was discovered with the MIP-coated fibers to propranolol and its structural analogues such as atenolol, pindolol, and alprenolol. In contrast, only non-specific adsorption could be shown with the non-imprinted polymer (NIP)-coated fibers, and the extraction efficiencies of propranolol and pindolol with the MIP-coated fibers were higher markedly than that with the commercial SPME fibers. A MIP-coated SPME coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for propranolol and pindolol determination was developed under the optimized extraction conditions. Linear ranges for propranolol and pindolol were 20-1000 microg L(-1) and detection limits were 3.8 and 6.9 microg L(-1), respectively. Propranolol and pindolol in the spiked human urine and plasma samples, extracted with organic solvent firstly, could be simultaneous monitored with satisfactory recoveries through this method.", 
    "36": "Neuropathic pain is a disease caused by a lesion or dysfunction of the nervous system. Antidepressants or anticonvulsants are presently the best available treatments. The mechanism by which antidepressants relieve neuropathic pain remains poorly understood. Using pharmacological and transgenic approaches in mice, we evaluated adrenergic receptor (AR) implication in the action of the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine, the noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine, and the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor reboxetine. Neuropathy was induced by cuff insertion around the sciatic nerve. We showed that chronic antidepressant treatment suppressed cuff-induced allodynia in wild-type mice but not in beta(2)-AR deficient mice, and/or that this antiallodynic action was blocked by intraperitoneal or intrathecal injection of the beta(2)-AR antagonist ICI 118,551 but not by the alpha(2)-AR antagonist yohimbine. We also showed that the anticonvulsant gabapentin was still effective in beta(2)-AR deficient mice. Our results demonstrate that beta(2)-ARs are essential for the antiallodynic action of antidepressant drugs.", 
    "37": "The release of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) into the environment is an ecologically important topic for study because, whilst APIs have been designed to have a wide range of biological properties for the target of interest (usually in man), little information on potential ecological risks is currently available regarding their effects on the organisms that inhabit the environment. In this study, the algae Micrasterias hardyi was exposed to propranolol, metoprolol (beta-adrenergic receptor agonist drugs) and mefenamic acid (a non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug), at concentrations ranging between 0.002-0.2 mM. Initial studies showed that Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy on algal homogenates illustrated that all three APIs had a quantitative effect on the metabolism of the organisms and it was possible to estimate the level of API exposure from the FT-IR metabolic fingerprints using partial least squares (PLS) regression. From the inspection of the PLS loadings matrices it was possible to elucidate that all drugs caused effects on protein and lipid levels. Most strikingly propranolol had significant effects on the lipid components of the cell. These were dramatically reduced possibly as a consequence of loss of membrane integrity. In order to investigate this further, FT-IR microspectroscopy was used to generate detailed metabolic fingerprinting maps. These chemical maps revealed that all the drugs had a dramatic effect on the distribution of various chemical species throughout the algae, and that all drugs had an affect on protein and lipid levels. In particular, as noted in the PLS analyses for propranolol treated cells, the lipid complement found in the lipid storage areas in the processes of M. hardyi was greatly reduced. This illustrates the power of spatial metabolic fingerprinting for investigating abiotic stresses on complex biological species.",

A two-dimensional echocardiogram showed mild asymmetric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy localized to the interventricular septum, consistent with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A maximal treadmill exercise test was terminated early owing to marked downsloping of the ST-T segment on all precordial leads, associated with mild chest discomfort. Cardiac MRI and coronary angiography showed that the left anterior descending (LAD) artery was 'tunneled' from its origin to the junction of the middle and lower segments, causing systolic obliteration. PET showed diffusely blunted myocardial blood flow after dipyridamole infusion. A beating-heart technique was used to perform surgical mobilization of the superficial and lateral surfaces of the LAD artery. The patient was free from angina at 6 months after surgery.

However, the protective mechanisms of donepezil have not yet been clearly identified. We investigated the neuroprotective effects of donepezil and other AChE-inhibitors against amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta42)-induced neurotoxicity in rat cortical neurons. To evaluate the neuroprotective effects of AChE-inhibitors, primary cultured cortical neurons were pre-treated with several concentrations of AChE-inhibitors for 24 h and then treated with 20 microM Abeta42 for 6 h. In addition to donepezil, other AChE-inhibitors (galantamine and huperizine A) also showed increased neuronal cell viability against Abeta42 toxicity in a concentration-dependent manner. However, we demonstrated that donepezil has a more potent effect in inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity compared with other AChE-inhibitors. The neuroprotective effects of donepezil were blocked by LY294002 (10 microM), a phosphoinositide 3 kinase inhibitor, but only partially by mecamylamine (10 microM), a blocker of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Additionally, donepezil's neuroprotective mechanism was related to the enhanced phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3beta and reduced phosphorylation of tau and glycogen synthase. These results suggest that donepezil prevents Abeta42-induced neurotoxicity through the activation of phosphoinositide 3 kinase/Akt and inhibition of GSK-3, as well as through the activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.", 
    "47": "Premature aging (senescence) of endothelial cells might play an important role in the development and progression of hypertension and atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that bradykinin, a hormone that mediates vasoprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, protects endothelial cells from oxidative stress-induced senescence. Bradykinin treatment (0.001 to 1 nmol/L) dose-dependently decreased senescence induced by 25 micromol/L of H(2)O(2) in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells, as witnessed by a complete inhibition of increased senescent cell numbers and a 34% reduction of the levels of the senescence-associated cell cycle protein p21. Because H(2)O(2) induces senescence through superoxide-induced DNA damage, single-cell DNA damage was measured by comet assay. Bradykinin reduced DNA damage to control levels. The protective effect of bradykinin also resulted in a significant increase in the migration of H(2)O(2)-treated bovine aorta endothelial cells in an in vitro endothelial injury model, or \"scratch\" assay. The protective effect of bradykinin was abolished by the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist HOE-140 and the NO production inhibitor N(omega)-methyl-L-arginine acetate salt. Therefore, we conclude that bradykinin protects endothelial cells from superoxide-induced senescence through bradykinin B2 receptor- and NO-mediated inhibition of DNA damage.", 
    "48": "The sympathetic actions of medullary raph\u00e9 neurons on heart rate (HR), atrioventricular conduction, ventricular contractility, and rate of relaxation were examined in nine urethane-anesthetized (1-1.5 g/kg iv), artificially ventilated rats that had been adrenalectomized and given atropine methylnitrate (1 mg/kg iv). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), ECG, and left ventricular pressure were recorded. The peak rates of rise and fall in the first derivative of left ventricular (LV) pressure (dP/dtmax and dP/dtmin, respectively) and the stimulus-R ($-R) interval were measured during brief periods of atrial pacing at 8.5 Hz before and after ventral medullary raph\u00e9 neurons were activated by dl-homocysteic acid (DLH, 0.1 M) or inhibited by GABA (0.3 M) in local microinjections (90 nl). LV dP/dtmax values were corrected for the confounding effect of MAP, determined at the end of the experiments after giving propranolol (1 mg/kg iv) to block sympathetic actions on the heart. DLH microinjections into the ventral medullary raph\u00e9 region increased HR by 44 +/- 2 beats/min, LV dP/dtmax by 1,055 +/- 156 mmHg/s, and the negative value of LV dP/dtmin by 729 +/- 204 mmHg/s (all, P < 0.001) while shortening the $-R interval by 2.8 +/- 0.8 ms (P < 0.01). GABA microinjections caused no significant change in HR, LV dP/dtmax, or $-R interval but reduced LV dP/dtmin from -5,974 +/- 93 to -5,548 +/- 171 mmHg/s and MAP from 115 +/- 4 to 105 +/- 5 mmHg (both, P < 0.01). Rises in tail skin temperature confirmed that GABA injections effectively inhibited raph\u00e9 neurons. When activated, the neurons in the ventral medullary raph\u00e9 region thus enhance atrioventricular conduction, ventricular contractility, and relaxation in parallel with HR, but they provide little or no tonic sympathetic drive to the heart.", 
    "49": "Noradrenaline-dopamine interactions mediate increases in locomotor activity, development of sensitisation and subjective effects of psychostimulant drugs. However, the modulatory effects of noradrenaline on psychostimulant-induced impulsivity are less clear. This article examined the relative roles of noradrenaline and dopamine in the modulation of methylphenidate-induced impulsive responding in rats performing the 5-choice serial reaction time task. Experiment 1 examined the systemic antagonism of methylphenidate-induced impulsivity with either propranolol, a beta-adrenoreceptor blocker, or prazosin, an alpha1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, which antagonises the locomotor activating effects of amphetamine. Propranolol completely abolished methylphenidate-induced impulsivity. This effect was centrally rather than peripherally mediated, as nadolol, a peripheral beta-blocker failed to affect methylphenidate-induced premature responding. Prazosin partially attenuated the methylphenidate-mediated increase in premature responding. A second experiment examined the effects of selective anti-D beta H saporin-induced cortical noradrenaline depletion on methylphenidate-induced impulsivity. Contrary to the effects of beta-adrenoreceptor blockade, cortical noradrenergic depletion did not alter methylphenidate-induced impulsivity. Other experiments examined the comparative effects of selective dopamine and serotonin receptor blockade. D4 dopamine receptor blockade with systemically administered L-745,870 also attenuated methylphenidate-induced impulsivity. The other antagonists had no effect on methylphenidate-induced impulsivity. Taken together, these studies provide evidence for a modulatory role of beta-adrenoreceptors on methylphenidate-induced impulsive responding.", 
    "50": "The mechanism underlying enhancer-blocking by insulators is unclear. We explored the activity of human beta-globin HS5, the orthologue of the CTCF-dependent chicken HS4 insulator. An extra copy of HS5 placed between the beta-globin locus control region (LCR) and downstream genes on a transgene fulfills the classic predictions for an enhancer-blocker. Ectopic HS5 does not perturb the LCR but blocks gene activation by interfering with RNA pol II, activator and coactivator recruitment, and epigenetic modification at the downstream beta-globin gene. Underlying these effects, ectopic HS5 disrupts chromatin loop formation between beta-globin and the LCR, and instead forms a new loop with endogenous HS5 that topologically isolates the LCR. Both enhancer-blocking and insulator-loop formation depend on an intact CTCF site in ectopic HS5 and are sensitive to knock-down of the CTCF protein by siRNA. Thus, intrinsic looping activity of CTCF sites can nullify LCR function.", 
    "51": "Renin secretion is regulated in part by renal nerves operating through beta1-receptors of the renal juxtaglomerular cells. Slow sodium loading may decrease plasma renin concentration (PRC) and cause natriuresis at constant mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We hypothesized that in this setting, renin secretion and renin-dependent sodium excretion are controlled by via the renal nerves and therefore are eliminated or reduced by blocking the action of norepinephrine on the juxtaglomerular cells with the beta1-receptor antagonist metoprolol. This was tested in conscious dogs by infusion of NaCl (20 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1) for 180 min, NaLoad) during regular or low-sodium diet (0.03 mmol.kg(-1).day(-1), LowNa) with and without metoprolol (2 mg/kg plus 0.9 mg.kg(-1).h(-1)). Vasopressin V2 receptors were blocked by Otsuka compound OPC31260 to facilitate clearance measurements. Body fluid volume was maintained by servocontrolled fluid infusion. Metoprolol per se did not affect MAP, heart rate, or sodium excretion significantly, but reduced PRC and ANG II by 30-40%, increased plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and tripled potassium excretion. LowNa per se increased PRC (+53%), ANG II (+93%), and aldosterone (+660%), and shifted the vasopressin function curve to the left. NaLoad elevated plasma [Na+] by 4.5% and vasopressin by threefold, but MAP and plasma ANP remained unchanged. NaLoad decreased PRC by approximately 30%, ANG II by approximately 40%, and aldosterone by approximately 60%, regardless of diet and metoprolol. The natriuretic response to NaLoad was augmented during metoprolol regardless of diet. In conclusion, PRC depended on dietary sodium and beta1-adrenergic control as expected; however, the acute sodium-driven decrease in PRC at constant MAP and GFR was unaffected by beta1-receptor blockade demonstrating that renin may be regulated without changes in MAP, GFR, or beta1-mediated effects of norepinephrine. Low-sodium diet augments vasopressin secretion, whereas ANP secretion is reduced.", 
    "52": "Saline administration may change renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activity and sodium excretion at constant mean arterial pressure (MAP). We hypothesized that such responses are elicited mainly by renal sympathetic nerve activity by beta1-receptors (beta1-RSNA), and tested the hypothesis by studying RAAS and renal excretion during slow saline loading at constant plasma sodium concentration (Na+ loading; 12 micromol Na+.kg(-1).min(-1) for 4 h). Normal subjects were studied on low-sodium intake with and without beta1-adrenergic blockade by metoprolol. Metoprolol per se reduced RAAS activity as expected. Na+ loading decreased plasma renin concentration (PRC) by one-third, plasma ANG II by one-half, and plasma aldosterone by two-thirds (all P < 0.05); surprisingly, these changes were found without, as well as during, acute metoprolol administration. Concomitantly, sodium excretion increased indistinguishably with and without metoprolol (16 +/- 2 to 71 +/- 14 micromol/min; 13 +/- 2 to 55 +/- 13 micromol/min, respectively). Na+ loading did not increase plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, glomerular filtration rate (GFR by 51Cr-EDTA), MAP, or cardiac output (CO by impedance cardiography), but increased central venous pressure (CVP) by approximately 2.0 mmHg (P < 0.05). During Na+ loading, sodium excretion increased with CVP at an average slope of 7 micromol.min(-1).mmHg(-1). Concomitantly, plasma vasopressin decreased by 30-40% (P < 0.05). In conclusion, beta1-adrenoceptor blockade affects neither the acute saline-mediated deactivation of RAAS nor the associated natriuretic response, and the RAAS response to modest saline loading seems independent of changes in MAP, CO, GFR, beta1-mediated effects of norepinephrine, and ANP. Unexpectedly, the results do not allow assessment of the relative importance of RAAS-dependent and -independent regulation of renal sodium excretion. The results are compatible with the notion that at constant arterial pressure, a volume receptor elicited reduction in RSNA via receptors other than beta1-adrenoceptors, decreases renal tubular sodium reabsorption proximal to the macula densa leading to increased NaCl concentration at the macula densa, and subsequent inhibition of renin secretion.", 
    "53": "The olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) rat is considered to be a good model of the pathology of human depression and also of the functional actions of antidepressant drug therapy. It has been proposed that antidepressant effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be accelerated by blocking 5-HT(1A/B) autoreceptors with pindolol. The underlying mechanism is thought to involve acute unrestricting of 5-HT release and, consequently, relatively enhanced 5-HT turnover throughout the forebrain serotonergic networks. The effect of this combination on 5-HT turnover in sham operated or OBX rats can be assessed at the level of 5-HT synthesis, a very important presynaptic step in serotonergic neurotransmission, using the alpha-[(14)C]methyl-l-tryptophan autoradiography method. In sham rats, acute citalopram (20mg/kg) treatment increased synthesis at almost all serotonergic terminal regions but slightly decreased synthesis at serotonergic cell body regions (i.e. dorsal and median (not significant) raphe; approximately 16%). Combining pindolol (10mg/kg) with citalopram further increased synthesis at many regions in sham rats (relative to treatment with only citalopram). In OBX rats, citalopram decreased synthesis at a few terminal regions and greatly decreased synthesis at the dorsal and median raphe ( approximately 45%; relative to OBX rats treated with saline). Combining pindolol with citalopram greatly increased synthesis at almost all regions in OBX rats (relative to treatment with only citalopram). These results suggest that acute citalopram effects result in elevated terminal 5-HT synthesis, but these effects are restrained by 5-HT(1A/B) autoreceptor feedback to different degrees in sham and OBX rats. Moreover, 5-HT(1A/B) autoreceptor feedback is stronger in OBX rats and may underlie the delay of SSRI effects in OBX rats and, correspondingly, in human depression. Pindolol acceleration and augmentation of SSRI antidepressant therapy for human depression may be mediated by attenuation of 5-HT(1A/B) autoreceptor feedback, permitting unhindered SSRI effects on serotonergic terminals.", 
    "54": "The effect of cyanocobalamin, vitamin B12, on glutamate release in isolated nerve terminals (synaptosomes) prepared from rat prefrontal cortex was examined. Cyanocobalamin inhibited the release of glutamate evoked by 4-aminopyridine in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory action of cyanocobalamin was blocked by the vesicular transporter inhibitor bafilomycin A1, not by the glutamate transporter inhibitor L-transpyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid or the nontransportable glutamate inhibitor DL-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate, indicating that this release inhibition results from a reduction of vesicular exocytosis and not from an inhibition of Ca(2+)-independent efflux via glutamate transporter. Examination of the effect of cyanocobalamin on cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration revealed that the inhibition of glutamate release could be attributed to a reduction in voltage-dependent Ca(2+) influx. Consistent with this, the N- and P/Q-type Ca(2+) channel blocker omega-conotoxin MVIIC, largely attenuated the inhibitory effect of cyanocobalamin on 4-aminopyridine-evoked glutamate release, but the Ca(2+) release inhibitor dantrolene had no effect. Cyanocobalamin did not alter the resting synaptosomal membrane potential or 4-aminopyridine-mediated depolarization; thus, the inhibition of 4-aminopyridine-evoked Ca(2+) influx and glutamate release produced by cyanocobalamin was not due to its decreasing synaptosomal excitability. In addition, cyanocobalamin-mediated inhibition of 4-aminopyridine-evoked Ca(2+) influx and glutamate release was significantly attenuated by protein kinase C inhibitors GF109203X and Ro318220. Furthermore, 4-aminopyridine-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase C was significantly reduced by cyanocobalamin. These results suggest that cyanocobalamin effects a decrease in protein kinase C activation, which subsequently reduces the Ca(2+) entry through voltage-dependent N- and P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels to cause a decrease in evoked glutamate release.",

In previous study, HO-1-u-1 cell line was grown on cell culture inserts and utilized as in vitro model for screening sublingual drug delivery. The aim of current study was to further investigate the effects of pH, osmolarity and permeation enhancer, sodium glycodeoxycholate (GDC) on the permeability of three beta-blockers with different lipophilicities. The cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTS/PES assay. The permeability studies were carried out using the cell culture model and compared with that obtained from fresh porcine sublingual mucosa. The results showed the enhancement effects caused by pH, osmolarity and GDC were highly lipophilicity-dependent and in the order atenolol>metoprolol>propranolol. The apparent permeability coefficients (P(app)) of all the three beta-blockers were significantly increased by increasing pH. However, less enhancing effects were observed by non-physiological osmolarity or the presence of GDC in permeability study using both cell culture and porcine sublingual mucosa. The present results suggested that the HO-1-u-1 cell culture model maybe a useful and effective in vitro model for evaluating the enhancement effects and mechanism in sublingual drug delivery.", 
    "56": "The direction of the effective electrophoretic mobility of small organic cations in micellar electrokinetic chromatography using sodium dodecyl sulphate in a low-pH electrolyte can be reversed in the presence of organic solvent. This effective electrophoretic mobility change is presented here as a new dimension for on-line sample preconcentration of cations in capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) using a background solution (BGS) modified by an organic solvent. The sample is prepared in a micellar solution without organic solvent. The focusing effect relies on the reversal in the effective electrophoretic mobility at the boundary zone between the micellar matrix and the BGS modified with organic solvent. This on-line sample preconcentration technique, called micelle to solvent stacking (MSS) afforded more than an order of magnitude improvement in concentration sensitivity compared to typical CZE-UV or CZE-electrospray ionization (ESI) MS analysis.

For this purpose, 24 male rats (Long Evans Norwegian Strain) were taken and were divided into four groups, consisting of 6 rats in each group. Group I was control, group II was stressed but non treated, group III was stressed and treated (treated with carvedilol an adrenoceptor blocker), and group IV was stressed and treated (treated with distilled water). The serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) were measured in all groups of animals. Haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit values were measured as indirect indices of haemoconcentration. Serum levels of total cholesterol, TG and HDL were significantly higher in stressed group than that of control group, but LDL cholesterol levels were same in both groups. Concurrently, there were haemoconcentration in stressed group compared to control group. In group III, there were decrease in total cholesterol, TG and HDL cholesterol levels compared to group II and TG level was mostly affected. But LDL level was significantly higher than that of control group (group I). Again, in group III, there were still haemoconcentration. The present data indicate that restrain stress induced elevations of serum lipid and lipoproteins were partly result from direct metabolic activation of sympathetic nervous system and also partly from haemoconcentration.",

Here, we attempted to demonstrate involvement of both influx and efflux transporters in vivo in gastrointestinal absorption of celiprolol in mice. Plasma concentration of celiprolol (3 mg/kg) after oral administration was mostly under the limit of quantification in wild mice, whereas that in mdr1a/b knockout (mdr1a/b(-/-)) mice was much more obvious, indicating P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux. Then, the oral absorption of celiprolol in mdr1a/b(-/-) mice was further examined to investigate influx transport mechanism with avoiding effect of P-glycoprotein. Coadministration of bromosulfophthalein (BSP), an inhibitor of various influx transporters including organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) reduced plasma celiprolol concentration. Inhibition by BSP of celiprolol uptake from apical membranes was confirmed in Ussing-type chamber of small intestinal tissues. Uptake of celiprolol by human small intestinal transporter OATP-A/1A2 was also confirmed in Xenopus Laevis oocytes. Interestingly, OATP-A/1A2 accepts various beta-blockers including acebutolol, atenolol and sotalol, oral absorption of which is inhibited by coadministration of citrus juice or telithromycin in human. Taken together, these findings have suggested fundamental role of influx transport system(s) in oral absorption of celiprolol.",

Systemic administration of 3-NP causes motor and cognitive deficits, particularly those associated with excessive free radical generation. Recently, carvedilol has been implicated as a neuroprotectant in the treatment of various neurological disorders. The present study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of carvedilol against 3-NP-induced cognitive impairment and oxidative damage in rats. Intraperitoneal administration of 3-NP (20 mg/kg for 4 days) caused significant body weight reduction, impaired motor function (locomotor activity, movement pattern), induced vacuous chewing movements, led to poor retention of memory in the Morris water maze, and elevated plus maze task paradigms. Chronic treatment with carvedilol (1 and 2 mg/kg, po), once daily for a period of 8 days beginning 4 days before 3-NP administration, significantly reversed 3-NP-induced motor impairment and cognitive deficits. However, carvedilol (1 and 2 mg/kg, po) treatment significantly attenuated oxidative damage (reduced lipid peroxidation and nitrite levels, and restored depleted reduced glutathione and succinate dehydrogenase enzyme activity) in the rat brain.

Elective replacement of the aortic root removes the most important predilection site for aneurysms, but the distal aorta remains at risk. Predictors for aortic growth and adverse events in the distal aorta include aortic diameter, aortic distensiblity, previous aortic root replacement, hypertension and aortic regurgitation. After aortic dissection, the initial false lumen diameter is an independent predictor for late aneurysm formation. Although there are a few reports of short-term success after endovascular stent grafting of the descending thoracic aorta, stent grafting in patients with Marfan syndrome is not recommended unless intervention is clearly indicated and the risk of conventional open surgical repair is deemed prohibitive. Optimal long-term outcome demands lifelong radiographic follow-up and medical treatment with beta-blocker therapy. After aortic dissection rigorous antihypertensive medication is of utmost importance. Losartan, an angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist, might offer the first potential for primary prevention of clinical manifestations in Marfan syndrome, but the results of clinical trials have to be awaited.

    "82": "Neonatal diabetes is a rare monogenic form of diabetes that usually presents within the first six months of life. It is commonly caused by gain-of-function mutations in the genes encoding the Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits of the plasmalemmal ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel. To better understand this disease, we generated a mouse expressing a Kir6.2 mutation (V59M) that causes neonatal diabetes in humans and we used Cre-lox technology to express the mutation specifically in pancreatic beta cells. These beta-V59M mice developed severe diabetes soon after birth, and by 5 weeks of age, blood glucose levels were markedly increased and insulin was undetectable. Islets isolated from beta-V59M mice secreted substantially less insulin and showed a smaller increase in intracellular calcium in response to glucose. This was due to a reduced sensitivity of KATP channels in pancreatic beta cells to inhibition by ATP or glucose. In contrast, the sulfonylurea tolbutamide, a specific blocker of KATP channels, closed KATP channels, elevated intracellular calcium levels, and stimulated insulin release in beta-V59M beta cells, indicating that events downstream of KATP channel closure remained intact. Expression of the V59M Kir6.2 mutation in pancreatic beta cells alone is thus sufficient to recapitulate the neonatal diabetes observed in humans. beta-V59M islets also displayed a reduced percentage of beta cells, abnormal morphology, lower insulin content, and decreased expression of Kir6.2, SUR1, and insulin mRNA. All these changes are expected to contribute to the diabetes of beta-V59M mice. Their cause requires further investigation.",

Death was identified from administrative, state mortality, and Social Security Administration databases. Multivariate Cox regression was used to examine the association between different beta-blockers and death.", 
    "89": "Among 11 326 adults surviving a hospitalization for heart failure, 7976 received beta-blockers (atenolol, 38.5%; metoprolol tartrate, 43.2%; carvedilol, 11.6%; and other, 6.7%) during follow-up. The rate (per 100 person-years) of death during the 12 months after discharge varied by exposure and type of beta-blocker (atenolol, 20.1; metoprolol tartrate, 22.8; carvedilol, 17.7; and no beta-blockers, 37.0). After adjustment for confounders and the propensity to receive carvedilol, the risk of death compared with atenolol was higher for metoprolol tartrate (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.34) and no beta-blockers (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.44-1.84) but was not significantly different for carvedilol (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.92-1.44).", 
    "90": "Compared with atenolol, the adjusted risks of death were slightly higher with shorter-acting metoprolol tartrate but did not significantly differ for carvedilol in adults with heart failure.

    "92": "Using the Get With the Guidelines-Coronary Artery Disease database, we examined sex differences in care processes and in-hospital death among 78 254 patients with AMI in 420 US hospitals from 2001 to 2006. Women were older, had more comorbidities, less often presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and had higher unadjusted in-hospital death (8.2% versus 5.7%; P<0.0001) than men. After multivariable adjustment, sex differences in in-hospital mortality rates were no longer observed in the overall AMI cohort (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.04; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.10) but persisted among STEMI patients (10.2% versus 5.5%; P<0.0001; adjusted OR=1.12; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.23). Compared with men, women were less likely to receive early aspirin treatment (adjusted OR=0.86; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.90), early beta-blocker treatment (adjusted OR=0.90; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.93), reperfusion therapy (adjusted OR=0.75; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.80), or timely reperfusion (door-to-needle time </=30 minutes: adjusted OR=0.78; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.92; door-to-balloon time </=90 minutes: adjusted OR=0.87; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.95). Women also experienced lower use of cardiac catheterization and revascularization procedures after AMI.", 
    "93": "Overall, no sex differences in in-hospital mortality rates after AMI were observed after multivariable adjustment. However, women with STEMI had higher adjusted mortality rates than men. The underuse of evidence-based treatments and delayed reperfusion among women represent potential opportunities for reducing sex disparities in care and outcome after AMI.", 
    "94": "We previously reported that short-term (2 h) plating of cat atrial myocytes on the extracellular matrix protein, laminin (LMN) decreases adenylate cyclase activity and beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)-AR) stimulation of L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)). The present study sought to determine whether LMN-mediated down-regulation of beta(1) signalling is due to down-regulation of adenylate cyclase and to gain insight into the signalling mechanisms responsible. beta(1)-AR stimulation was achieved by 0.01 microm isoproterenol (isoprenaline) plus 0.1 microm ICI 118551, a selective beta(2)-AR antagonist. Atrial myocytes were plated for at least 2 h on uncoated cover-slips (-LMN) or cover-slips coated with LMN (+LMN). As previously reported, beta(1)-AR stimulation of I(Ca,L) was significantly smaller in +LMN compared to -LMN atrial myocytes. In -LMN myocytes, 10 microm LY294002 (LY), a specific inhibitor of PI-(3)K, had no effect on beta(1)-AR stimulation of I(Ca,L). In +LMN myocytes, however, LY significantly increased beta(1)-AR stimulation of I(Ca,L). Western blots revealed that compared with -LMN myocytes, +LMN myocytes showed a significant increase in Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473, which was prevented by LY. In another approach, +LMN myocytes were infected (multiplicity of infection (MOI), 100; 24 h) with replication-defective adenoviruses (Adv) expressing dominant-negative inhibitors of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (Adv-FRNK or Adv-Y397F-FAK) or Akt (Adv-dnAkt). Compared with control cells infected with Adv-beta-galactosidase, cells infected with Adv-FRNK, Adv-Y397F-FAK or Adv-dnAkt each exhibited a significantly greater beta(1)-AR stimulation of I(Ca,L). In -LMN myocytes LY had no effect on forskolin (FSK)-stimulated I(Ca,L). However, in +LMN myocytes LY significantly increased FSK-stimulated I(Ca,L). Similar results were obtained in +LMN atrial myocytes infected with Adv-FRNK. We conclude that LMN binding to beta(1)-integrin receptors acts via FAK/PI-(3)K/Akt to inhibit adenylate cyclase activity and thereby down-regulates beta(1)-AR-mediated stimulation of I(Ca,L). These findings provide new insight into the cellular mechanisms by which the extracellular matrix can modulate atrial beta-AR signalling.", 
    "95": "There has been a tremendous focus on gynecologic health with the increasing number of women with congenital heart disease (CHD). Conversely, experience in providing sexual health screening to men with CHD is lacking. The purpose of this study was to identify sexual health issues in men with CHD. An anonymous survey was distributed to men in our adult CHD clinic. Age, type of CHD, medications, detailed sexual history including cardiovascular symptoms with intercourse, erectile dysfunction (ED), and willingness to discuss ED with a physician was obtained. A logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the relation between medications, CHD complexity, and ED; 86 men completed the survey with a mean age of 34 +/- 10 years. The prevalence of ED was 38%. Men were treated with cardiac medications including beta blockers (BB; 24%), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (8%), calcium-channel blockers (6%), and combination BB and ACE inhibitor therapy (16%). Men on BB were 3.13 times more likely to report ED (p = 0.045). Complexity of CHD did not increase the likelihood of ED symptoms (p >0.10). Although most men attributed symptoms to their underlying CHD, most were willing to discuss issues of ED with their cardiologist. In conclusion, ED is prevalent in young men with CHD. Although an emotional component may contribute, certain medications may exacerbate symptoms.", 
    "96": "Beta blockers are underprescribed to elderly patients with systolic heart failure (HF). We studied whether the prescription of a beta blocker is associated with a survival benefit in a nonselected population of patients >70 years of age hospitalized with acute HF and systolic dysfunction. We studied 272 consecutive patients >70 years (median 77.0, interquartile range 73.4 to 81.1) hospitalized with acute HF (left ventricular ejection fraction 34 +/- 8%) during a 2-year period. At discharge, beta-blocker therapy was prescribed in 139 patients (51.1%). A propensity score for the likelihood of receiving beta-blocker therapy was developed and showed a good performance (c-statistic = 0.825 and Hosmer-Lemeshow p = 0.820). After discharge, 120 patients (44.1%) died during the follow-up (median 31 months, interquartile range 12 to 46). Cox regression analysis showed a lower risk of death associated with beta-blocker prescription (p <0.001, hazard ratio [HR] 0.450, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.310 to 0.655), which persisted after risk adjusting for the propensity score (HR 0.521, 95% CI 0.325 to 0.836, p = 0.007). In a propensity-matched cohort of 130 patients, there was a significantly lower mortality in patients receiving beta blockers (log rank 0.009, HR 0.415, 95% CI 0.234 to 0.734, p = 0.003). Risk reduction associated with beta blockade was observed with both high doses (HR 0.472, 95% CI 0.300 to 0.742, p = 0.001) and low doses (HR 0.425, 95% CI 0.254 to 0.711, p = 0.001). In conclusion, beta-blocker prescription at discharge in a nonselected population >70 years of age hospitalized with systolic HF is associated with a significantly lower risk of death even at low doses. This benefit remains consistent after adjustment for potential confounders.", 
    "97": "High systolic blood pressure (SBP) is a predictor of survival for patients with heart failure (HF). Whether SBP predicts survival in both ischemic and nonischemic HF has not been well examined. We analyzed 2,178 patients with advanced HF (47.3% ischemic etiology, 75.5% men, 93.5% New York Heart Association class III or IV, age 52 +/- 13, left ventricular ejection fraction 24 +/- 9%) referred to a university center between 1983 and 2006. SBP and invasive hemodynamic variables were recorded after optimization of medical therapy. Patients were divided into SBP quartiles (<or=90, 91 to 100, 101 to 112, >or=113 mm Hg) based on SBP frequency. Survival free from death or urgent transplant in ischemic versus nonischemic HF was 53.2% versus 61.1% at 2 years. Higher SBP quartile was associated with increased survival in the total cohort and in subgroups of both nonischemic and ischemic HF. On multivariate analysis adjusting for age, left ventricular ejection fraction, cholesterol, gender, diabetes mellitus, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac index, New York Heart Association class, beta-blocker use, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker use, statin use, and smoking history, relative risk (95% confidence interval) of death or urgent transplant at 2 years for quartile 1 compared with quartile 4 was 1.9 (1.4 to 2.6) in the total cohort, 1.6 (1.1 to 2.5) in nonischemic HF, and 2.4 (1.5 to 3.7) in ischemic HF. In conclusion, SBP predicts HF survival in both ischemic and nonischemic HF independent of other risk factors and invasive hemodynamic variables.",

Therefore, oral loading with propafenone (as \"pill-in-the-pocket\" treatment of recent-onset atrial fibrillation) in a patient on concurrent carvedilol treatment may lead to a pharmacokinetic interaction, with high plasma levels of propafenone and potential drug-related adverse effects. In clinical practice, in order to improve the safety of \"pill-in-the-pocket\" treatment, use of propafenone loading should, in our view, be discouraged in patients on concurrent treatment with carvedilol.",

    "104": "Beta-adrenergic blockade ameliorates the hypermetabolism and catabolism in severe burn injury. Despite the salutary effects of beta-adrenergic blockade, the immunologic responses that accompany beta-blockade are not known. We have shown that burn sepsis is associated with increased sympathetic activation leading to altered monocytopoiesis and cytokine release in macrophages (M\u00d8). Recent evidence suggests that murine M\u00d8 expressing F4/80+Gr1+ are the inflammatory phenotype. Here, we report that propranolol given after burn sepsis modulates the number and function of myeloid cells in circulation. B6D2F1 male mice were divided into sham (S), burn (B), and burn sepsis (BS) groups. Dorsal hair was shaved from S, B, and BS; B and BS received 15% scald burn; BS was inoculated with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (PA 14, 4000-5000 colony-forming units) at the burn site. Mice from each group were then subjected to two different treatment regimens. One set received subcutaneous injections of propranolol (5 mg/kg body weight) at 24 and 48 hours after the injury while the control groups received saline. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture at 72 hours. The distribution of total F4/80+ monocyte population was determined by flow cytometry. Inflammatory monocyte subset was gated on Gr1+ expression in the F4/80+ fraction. Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated intracellular tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (ic-TNF) was also measured as an indicator of inflammatory response. The total F4/80+ monocyte fraction was significantly increased in BS (45 +/- 0.8%) vs S and B (10 +/- 0.8%; 9.5 +/- 0.6%). Propranolol treatment for 2 days reduced the number of circulating monocytes by 60% in BS. The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of ic-TNF produced per cell (F4/80+Gr1+ M\u00d8) was significantly decreased in B and BS (S: 3043 +/- 213, B: 1638 +/- 343, BS: 1463 +/- 67). Of importance, propranolol treatment partially restored the MFI of ic-TNF (2177 +/- 114) and increased the percentage of inflammatory monocyte subset (F4/80+Gr1+) in BS by 70% compared with saline treatment. In contrast, beta-blockade after BS increased the percentage of granulocytes in circulation (28.4 +/- 3.6% in BS propranolol vs 15.4 +/- 0.3% in BS saline; P < .05) and augmented their TNF production (MFI = 903 +/- 102 in BS propranolol vs 644 +/- 5 in BS saline; P < .05). Propranolol reverses burn sepsis-induced monocytosis and simultaneously increases the number of granulocytes and enhances the inflammatory potential of the granulocytes and inflammatory monocyte subsets in circulation suggesting that monitoring M\u00d8 subsets and granulocytes in blood is a reliable biomarker to predict the efficacy of beta-blockade.", 
    "105": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is reported to affect almost one third of the civilian burn patient population. Predisposing factors for PTSD include experiencing a traumatic event. Of Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) soldiers returning home after deployment without injury, 17% reported cognitive symptoms of PTSD. The authors recent study of soldiers burned in OIF/OEF showed a PTSD prevalence of approximately 30%, which is similar to civilian studies. Burns are characterized by hypermetabolism and increased catecholamine levels. beta-Adrenergic receptor blocking agents, like propranolol, decrease catecholamine levels. Propranolol may reduce consolidation of memory and a prophylaxis for PTSD. This retrospective study examines the relationship between PTSD prevalence and propranolol administration. After institutional review board approval, propranolol received, number of surgeries, anesthetic/analgesic regimen, TBSA burned, and injury severity score were collected from patients charts. The military burn center received 603 soldiers injured in OIF/OEF, of which 226 completed the PTSD Checklist-Military. Thirty-one soldiers received propranolol and 34 matched soldiers did not. In propranolol patients, the prevalence of PTSD was 32.3% vs 26.5% in those not receiving propranolol (P = .785). These data suggest propranolol does not decrease PTSD development in burned soldiers. The prevalence of PTSD in patients receiving propranolol is the same as those not receiving propranolol. More research is needed to determine the relationship between PTSD and propranolol.",

This is a challenging disease to treat because of the absence of a specific target, but these tumors are sensitive to chemotherapy. An improved understanding of the biology of TNBC has led to evaluation of DNA-damaging chemotherapy drugs, specifically, platinum compounds, and several targeted agents, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors, microtubule inhibitors, Src inhibitors, checkpoint kinase I inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, androgen receptor blocker, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor agonists, and transforming growth factor-beta antagonists, that may lead to improved clinical outcomes.

Methods and Results A randomized, multicenter comparison of rate control vs rhythm control in Japanese patients with PAF (the Japanese Rhythm Management Trial for Atrial Fibrillation (J-RHYTHM) study) was conducted. The primary endpoint was a composite of total mortality, symptomatic cerebral infarction, systemic embolism, major bleeding, hospitalization for heart failure, or physical/psychological disability requiring alteration of treatment strategy. In the study, 823 patients with PAF were followed for a mean period of 578 days. The primary endpoint occurred in 64 patients (15.3%) assigned to rhythm control and in 89 patients (22.0%) to rate control (P=0.0128). No significant differences between the treatment strategies were observed in the incidences of death, stroke, bleeding and heart failure. Meanwhile, significantly fewer patients requested changes of assigned treatment strategy in the rhythm control vs the rate control group, which was accompanied by improvement in AF-specific quality of life scores. Conclusion The J-RHYTHM study showed that rhythm control was associated with fewer primary endpoints than rate control. However, mortality and cardiovascular morbidity were not affected by the treatment strategy (umin-CTR No. C000000106).", 
    "113": "alpha(1)-Adrenergic vasoconstriction during dynamic leg exercise is diminished in younger individuals, although the extent of this exercise-induced \"sympatholysis\" in the elderly remains uncertain. Thus, in nine young (25 +/- 1 yr) and six older (72 +/- 2 yr) healthy volunteers, we evaluated changes in leg blood flow (ultrasound Doppler) during blood flow-adjusted intra-arterial infusion of phenylephrine (PE; a selective alpha(1)-adrenergic agonist) at rest and during knee-extensor leg exercise at 20, 40, and 60% of maximal work rate (WR(max)). To probe the potential contributors to exercise-induced changes in alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor sensitivity, exercising leg O(2) consumption (Vo(2)) and lactate efflux were also evaluated (n = 10). At rest, the PE-induced vasoconstriction (i.e., decrease in leg blood flow) was diminished in older (-37 +/- 3%) compared with young (-54 +/- 4%) subjects. During exercise, the magnitude of alpha(1)-adrenergic vasoconstriction in the active leg decreased in both groups. However, compared with young, older subjects maintained a greater vasoconstrictor response to PE at 40% WR(max) (-14 +/- 3%, older; -7 +/- 2%, young) and 60% WR(max) (-11 +/- 3%, older; -4 +/- 3%, young). It is possible that this observation may be attributed to lower absolute work rates in the older group, because, for a similar absolute work rate ( approximately 10 W) and leg Vo(2) ( approximately 0.36 l/min), vasoconstriction to PE was not different between groups (-14 +/- 3%; older; -17 +/- 5%, young). Together, these data challenge the concept of reduced sympatholysis in the elderly, suggesting instead that the inhibition of alpha(1)-adrenergic vasoconstriction in the exercising leg is associated with work performed and, therefore, more closely related to the rate of oxidative metabolism than to age per se.",

In BF 1''-hydroxylation and DEX O-demethylation, only CYP2D4 showed hook-shaped Eadie-Hofstee plots, the other four CYP2D enzymes exhibiting linear plots. In DEX N-demethylation, rat CYP2D2 did not show any detectable activity under the conditions used, whereas the other four enzymes yielded linear Eadie-Hofstee plots. To elucidate the mechanisms causing the nonlinear kinetics, four CYP2D4 mutants, CYP2D4-F109I, -V123F, -L216F and -A486F, were prepared. CYP2D4-V123F, -L216F and -A486F yielded linear or linear-like Eadie-Hofstee plots for BF 1''-hydroxylation, whereas only CYP2D4-A486F exhibited linear plots for DEX O-demethylation. The substitution of Phe-109 by isoleucine did not have any effect on the oxidative capacity of CYP2D4 for either BF or DEX.

Microinjections of NA 1, 3, 10, 30 or 45 nmol/100 nL into the SON caused dose-related pressor and bradycardiac response in unanesthetized rats. The response to NA 10 nmol was blocked by SON pretreatment with 15 nmol of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist RX821002 and not affected by pretreatment with equimolar dose of the selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist WB4101, suggesting that local alpha(2)-adrenoceptors mediate these responses. Pretreatment of the SON with the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol 15 nmol did not affect the pressor response to NA microinjection of into the SON. Moreover, the microinjection of the 100 nmol of the selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine (MET) into the SON did not cause cardiovascular response while the microinjection of the selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists BHT920 (BHT, 100 nmol) or clonidine (CLO, 5 nmol) caused pressor and bradycardiac responses, similar to that observed after the microinjection of NA. The pressor response to NA was potentiated by intravenous pretreatment with the ganglion blocker pentolinium and was blocked by intravenous pretreatment with the V(1)-vasopressin receptor antagonist dTyr(CH2)5(Me)AVP, suggesting an involvement of circulating vasopressin in this response. In conclusion, our results suggest that pressor responses caused by microinjections of NA into the SON involve activation of local alpha(2)-adrenoceptor receptors and are mediated by vasopressin release into circulation.",

Fifty Wistar rats that survived aortocaval (AC) shunt creation were randomly allotted into the following two groups: untreated animals (ACS; n=26) and animals treated with 100 mg/kg/day metoprolol (MP; ACS+MP; n=24). The effects of MP were evaluated at 1, 4 and 12 weeks post-surgery through echocardiographic, hemodynamic and pathologic studies. At 12 weeks post-surgery, LV wall thinning associated with chamber dilatation was observed in ACS but not in ACS+MP. LV end-diastolic pressure and diastolic wall stress were lower in ACS+MP than in ACS. The increase in LV weight was similar in both ACS and ACS+MP at 1 and 4 weeks post-surgery, but at 12 weeks post-surgery, it was significantly greater in ACS+MP than in ACS. At the cellular level, although the cardiac myocyte length progressively increased to a similar extent in both groups, the mean cross-sectional diameter of these cells in ACS+MP was greater than in ACS. In conclusion, MP did not prevent early eccentric hypertrophy in response to volume overload. However, in the late phase of volume overload-induced heart failure, MP appears to allow for myocyte cross-sectional growth and thus prevents LV wall thinning, resulting in a net increase in LV mass. In this manner, MP might contribute to reduction of diastolic wall stress and thereby delay progression of heart failure.",

First, we examined the effects of systemically injected beta-blockers on unconditioned and contextual conditioned response to cat odor. The centrally acting beta-blocker (propranolol) was able to impair unconditioned responses, as well as the acquisition of the contextual fear to cat odor; however, the peripherally acting (nadolol) was not effective. Next, we examined the neural substrate underlying the noradrenergic modulation of the defensive response to cat odor and focused on the dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd), because it represents the hypothalamic site most responsive to predatory threats and, at the same time, presents a dense plexus of noradrenergic fibers. We were able to see that propranolol significantly reduced PMd-Fos expression in response to cat odor and that beta-adrenoceptor blockade in the PMd, before cat odor exposure, reduced defensive responses to the cat odor and to the cat odor-related environment. We have also shown that beta-adrenoceptor blockade in the PMd, before the exposure to cat odor-related context, impaired the contextual conditioned responses. Overall, the present results provide convincing evidence suggesting that central noradrenergic mediation is critical for the expression of unconditioned and contextual conditioned antipredatory responses. We have further shown that the PMd appears to be an important locus to mediate these beta-adrenoceptor effects.", 
    "144": "We describe a novel approach for the automated localization of biotransformations, which we term IsoScore. Accurate mass measurement spectra of a parent drug and its metabolites are acquired. All virtual regioisomers of a given biotransformation are generated in silico by iterating over all plausible sites of oxidation around the parent drug. Each is then fragmented virtually using an exhaustive approach supplemented with chemical intelligence. Each fragment is scored based on the likelihood that it can be formed from the precursor structure. The fragment library of each virtual isomer is then compared with the experimentally observed ions. The likelihood that a regioisomer explains the observed fragmentation data is contained in its cumulated score. We include additional weightings, which take into account the level of similarity between the mass spectra of the metabolite and the parent compound.This concept was tested on a variety of metabolites from different chemical platforms formed via single biotransformations. For a very large proportion of the metabolites, IsoScore correctly located the biotransformation to the expected position. All ions above a defined threshold in the spectrum are used to contribute to the score with no predisposition to ignore minor ions or to weight conclusions based on readily interpretable fragments. The approach is found to be most successful when differential scoring is observed between related ions in the parent and the metabolite. Further improvements in the scoring function will result in increased differentiation between likely and unlikely structures, even when the parent and the metabolite spectra show little similarity.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of controlled oscillatory fluid flow (OFF) on osteoblastic cells in the presence and the absence of a gap-junction blocker. MC3T3-E1 Clone 14 cells in a monolayer were exposed to 2 h of OFF at a rate sufficient to create a shear stress of 20 dyne/cm(2) at the cell surface, and changes in steady-state mRNA levels for a number of key proteins known to be involved in osteogenesis were measured. Of the five proteins investigated, mRNA levels for osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin were found to be significantly increased 24 h postflow. These experiments were repeated in the presence of 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (BGA), a known gap-junction blocker, to determine whether gap-junction intercellular communication is necessary for this response. We found that the increase in OPN mRNA levels is not observed in the presence of BGA, suggesting that gap junctions are involved in the signaling process.

Physiological changes in pregnancy, which include plasma composition, can affect drug binding and subsequent drug response. In the present study, we investigated the toxicokinetics (TK) and/or toxicodynamics (TD) of diclofenac and propranolol comparing pregnant Sparague-Dawley (SD) rats with non-pregnant SD rats in terms of protein binding and drug distribution. Diclofenac and propranolol are reported to bind to albumin and alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP), respectively. After a single administration of diclofenac, the area under plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) based on free diclofenac in pregnant rats was 3.9 times higher than that in non-pregnant rats. This difference is considered to be due to a lower concentration of serum albumin and a higher concentration of non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) that inhibits drug binding to albumin, in pregnant rats. In histopathological examination, more severe gastrointestinal toxicity was observed in pregnant rats at 24 hr after dosing. This severe toxicity was likely to be correlated with the higher AUC. With respect to propranolol, the difference of the AUC based on free propranolol was not clear although the concentration of serum AGP was lower in pregnant rats. However, the binding analysis data suggested a difference of protein binding at a lower propranolol concentration range. Consequently, lowered serum proteins and increased NEFA in pregnant rats can lead to low protein binding, subsequent increase in free drug concentrations, and eventual increase in the TD of drugs.",

Male Wistar rats with cannulae implanted into the vSUB or BNST were trained on a step-through inhibitory avoidance task. Shortly after training, they received cholinergic drugs infused into the vSUB and/or glutamatergic or noradrenergic drugs infused into the BNST. Results of the 1-day retention tests showed that intra-vSUB infusion of oxotremorine (0.01 microg) or scopolamine (0.3 or 3.0 microg) enhanced or impaired retention, respectively. Both effects were dose- and time-dependent, and 0.001 microg oxotremorine attenuated the amnesia induced by 3.0 microg scopolamine. The oxotremorine-induced memory enhancement was blocked by intra-BNST infusion of DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid or propranolol at a dose not affecting retention; the amnesia induced by scopolamine was blunted by intra-BNST infusion of glutamate or norepinephrine at a dose with a negligible effect on retention.

For the 1235 diabetic hypertensive GEMINI patients, the authors assessed treatment differences by race (white/black/other), age (continuous variable), and sex on hemoglobin A(1c), insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]), and blood pressure. Both treatments significantly reduced blood pressure in all subgroups, but the metabolic effects of carvedilol were more beneficial in subgroups of race and sex. Carvedilol did not affect hemoglobin A(1c) but improved HOMA-IR results in all subgroups, significantly in males and \"other race\" subgroups. Metoprolol significantly increased hemoglobin A(1c) in all subgroups except \"other race,\" with no effect on HOMA-IR findings. Differences vs metoprolol significantly favored carvedilol for hemoglobin A(1c) in white and female subgroups and favored carvedilol for HOMA-IR in black, \"other race,\" and male subgroups. Carvedilol effects were favorable to adjustment of age as a covariate. In hypertensive patients with diabetes, carvedilol may be a more appropriate choice when beta-blockade is indicated.", 
    "177": "Ionophoretic application of alpha1- and beta-adrenoceptor blockers into the skin produces no effect on the parameters of thermal homeostasis under thermoneutral conditions. alpha1-Adrenoblocker verapamil inhibits cold shivering during fast and slow cold exposure; it elevates the temperature threshold and moderates the vasoconstrictor response during rapid cooling. These changes are accompanied by a compensatory decrease in the threshold and stimulation of non-shivering thermogenesis. Application of non-selective beta-blocker propranolol had no effect on the temperature thresholds of the thermoregulatory reactions, but augmented the maximum amplitude of shivering during both cooling protocols, thereby compensating the decrease in non-shivering thermogenesis. In the whole organism, block of one type adrenoceptors during cold exposure is accompanied by activation of the compensatory mechanisms mediated by adrenoceptors of the other type."
