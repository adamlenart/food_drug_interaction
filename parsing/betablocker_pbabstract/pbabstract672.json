A highly significant (P less than 0.001, mean -9.4 mm Hg,-29%) decrease in the intraocular pressure (IOP) was seen in 196 (164 simple, 32 capsular) patients in the beginning of the study using timolol alone. (Inadequate control timing, deviation from the treatment definition, or adverse reactions caused the exclusion of the data of 24 patients). A total of 180 patients (151 simple, 29 capsular) completed the 6-month study. At the end of the study an IOP less than 22 mm Hg was seen in 103 (57.2%, 91 simple, 12 capsular) patients treated with timolol alone. During the follow-up period there was no significant difference in the IOP-lowering effect of timolol in the simple and the capsular group using timolol alone. Combined treatment was needed by 39 of 180 patients who completed the study. It was needed more than twice as often in the capsular group (12 patients, 41.4%) as in the simple group (27 patients, 17.9%). The IOP increased above 25 mm Hg in one-fourth of these 39 patients during the follow-up period, but there was no significant difference between the simple and the capsular group. Six patients dropped out of the study because of side-effects possibly related to timolol therapy.", 
    "1": "The efficacy of chronic oral treatment with a total daily dose of 320 mg sotalol, given as a single or as two divided doses, was compared with placebo in a double-blind cross-over study of 12 patients with angina pectoris. Sotalol given once or twice daily significantly reduced heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures at rest. The exercise heart rates were significantly decreased in both treatment groups. After sotalol 320 mg once daily, there was a greater reduction in the maximum exercise heart rate 2 h after taking the last tablet than after sotalol 160 mg b.i.d. The systolic blood pressure at the highest comparable work-load was significantly and equally reduced by sotalol both once and twice daily. Total work (watts X minutes in both sotalol treatment groups was significantly increased compared to placebo. There was no difference between the two sotalol dosage regimens. The peak plasma levels were higher after the once daily treatment, but the trough levels were similar for both regimens. No serious side effects were observed.", 
    "2": "In a cross-over pharmacokinetic study in 8 healthy volunteers a retard formulation containing pindolol 30 mg was compared with the normal 15 mg. pindolol tablet. The pindolol 30 mg retard tablet led to the same maximum plasma level as a single dose of the normal pindolol tablet. A plasma concentration higher than half of the maximum was maintained twice as long after the retard than after the normal 15 mg pindolol tablet. The bioavailability of the two forms was practically identical.", 
    "3": "36 out of 52 patients with essential hypertension, whose blood pressure was not normalized with pindolol 15 mg per day, were treated with 30 mg per day for four to six weeks. Pindolol was administered in random order, either as 15 mg twice daily or as one 30 mg retard tablet once daily. Blood pressure was lowered from mean pretreatment levels of 174/111 mmHg to 149/98 mmHg by 15 mg b.d., and to 145/97 mmHg by 30 mg retard. In five patients diurnal variations in blood pressure and plasma pindolol levels were determined. At all times during the day blood pressure was at least well controlled by 30 mg retard as by 15 mg b.d. Plasma concentration maxima were similar with both forms, but a higher concentration was maintained for a longer time after the retard tablet. Pindolol 30 mg was well tolerated and the incidence of side effects was lower than during treatment with 15 mg b.d. Thus, patients requiring high doses of pindolol for control of hypertension can safely and conveniently be treated with a single tablet of 30 mg pindolol retard.", 
    "4": "In a double-blind trial 26 patients with essential hypertension were treated with nifedipine or placebo for 8 weeks, following a 4-week run-in-placebo period in all patients. The daily dosage of nifedipine during this phase was 10 mg 3 times daily. Metoprolol was then added to the therapeutic regimen of both groups for a further 12 weeks. Both nifedipine and metoprolol used as mono-therapy caused statistically significant reductions of arterial pressure. The addition of metoprolol to nifedipine tended to reduce blood pressure further, but blood pressures were not significantly lower than during nifedipine mono-therapy. Side-effects were few and only two patients had to be withdrawn during active therapy, one for headaches during nifedipine therapy, and another for asthma during metoprolol treatment. Combined therapy with a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, such as metoprolol, and a calcium antagonist with vasodilation properties, such as nifedipine, offers a theoretically interesting approach in the treatment of hypertension, even though the practical outcome in the present study probably suffered from an inadequate dose of nifedipine during the period of combined therapy.", 
    "5": "The kinetic profiles of oral methimazole 40 mg, propranolol 80 mg, metoprolol 100 mg and atenolol 100 mg were compared in hyperthyroid patients both during the hyper- and euthyroid states. for methimazole, neither the peak concentration (Cmax), the time to reach peak concentration (tmax), the elimination half-life (t 1/2) nor the area under the curve (AUC) value was affected by the hyperthyroid state. For propranolol and metoprolol, which undergo extensive presystemic clearance, the AUC values were lower (p less than 0.02) when the patients were hyperthyroid than when they had become euthyroid, but the t 1/2's were not significantly altered. For atenolol, there were no significant kinetic differences between the hyperthyroid and euthyroid states. The findings are compatible with the assumption that hyperthyroidism does not affect the kinetics of methimazole or atenolol, but that it may enhance presystemic clearance of propranolol and metoprolol.", 
    "6": "The elimination and bioavailability of two beta-blocking agents, propranolol and sotalol, were studied in 10 thyrotoxic patients, both before and after treatment with iodine-131. Each subject received in random order propranolol 160 mg and sotalol 160 mg as single oral doses both while hyperthyroid and after euthyroidism had been achieved. The pharmacokinetics of sotalol was not affected by hyperthyroidism, whereas serum propranolol concentrations were significantly lower during hyperthyroidism than in the euthyroid state. During hyperthyroidism, the bioavailability of propranolol was significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) and its clearance was increased (p less than 0.005), whereas there was no difference in its serum t 1/2. This indicates that the bioavailability of propranolol in hyperthyroidism is reduced by a mechanism which may depend on increased first-pass metabolism in the liver, or on an increased distribution volume of the drug. Both propranolol and sotalol caused a slight decrease in serum tri-iodothyronine concentration. As the effects of beta-blocking agents on the symptoms of hyperthyroidism are correlated with the serum concentration of the drugs, sotalol, with its long half-life and unaltered elimination in hyperthyroidism, has certain advantages over propranolol in the treatment of thyrotoxicosis.", 
    "7": "The antihypertensive effect of labetalol (L) was compared with that of clonidine (C) in a randomized cross-over study in 17 hypertensive outpatients on bendrofluazide (B). After treatment for two weeks with B(5 mg qd), either L (100 mg tid) or C (0.1 mg tid) was given and their doses were titrated at 2-weekly visits until normotension was achieve, or intolerable side-effects occurred. The treatment with B and L or C was than continued in a cross-over fashion for two 6-week periods, with 3 week diuretic washouts and subsequent dose-titration periods between the treatment periods. At the end of B, the supine blood pressure (BP) was 156/101, and at the end of B + L and B + C it was 136/91 (p less than 0.001) and 137/91 (p less than 0.0001), respectively, pooling the data from both periods. At the end of B the standing BP was 155/115, and at the end of B + L and B + C 134/100 (p less than 0.001) and 139/106 (p less than 0.0001), respectively. The mean daily doses required were L 476 mg and C 0.335 mg. On a weight basis, labetalol had about 1/1400 of the potency of clonidine. 12 patients complained of tiredness and dry mouth on clonidine and 2 patients of unsteadiness on labetalol. Labetalol caused a psoriasiform rash on the hands in one patient and limb weakness in one patient.", 
    "8": "1 The sympathetic transmitter stores of guinea-pig isolated atria were labelled with [3H]-noradrenaline. The effects of histamine (0.3 to 100 mumol/l) on resting and stimulation-induced (S-I, 2 Hz for 10 s) release of radioactivity were investigated. 2 Histamine, in low concentrations (0.3 and 1 mumol/l) had no effect on resting release but inhibited S-I release of radioactivity. The inhibition was abolished by the H2-receptor antagonist, cimetidine (10 mumol/l) and also by the H1-receptor antagonist, mepyramine (1 mumol/l). 3 The inhibitory actions of histamine on S-I release were not due to indirect effects involving alpha-adrenoceptors, beta-adrenoceptors, muscarinic cholinoceptors or prostaglandin synthesis. 4 Histamine in a high concentration (100 mumol/l) increased the resting and S-I release of radioactivity. The increase in resting release was abolished by the neuronal uptake blocking drug cocaine (30 mumol/l) but the increase in S-I release was only partially blocked by cocaine.", 
    "9": "The aim of the present study was to assess whether or not thrombin affects vascular smooth muscle activity by a direct action on the blood vessel wall. In isolated saphenous veins and femoral and pulmonary arteries thrombin did not affect basal tension, but in pulmonary and portal mesenteric veins it caused contraction. In saphenous and femoral veins and in femoral and pulmonary arteries the enzyme depressed contractions evoked by alpha-adrenergic stimulation. In the saphenous vein thrombin also depressed contractions induced with acetylcholine or potassium ions. In this blood vessel the relaxation caused by thrombin was abolished by antithrombin III and the tripeptide D-phenylalanine-proline-arginine-CH2Cl, a specific inhibitor of the enzyme center of thrombin. In pulmonary and portal mesenteric veins, thrombin potentiated the contractile response to norepinephrine. These contractile effects of thrombin were also abolished by D-phenylalanine-proline-arginine-CH2Cl. Thus, thrombin causes relaxation or contraction of blood vessels through a direct action on the blood vessel wall. These effects are due to its proteolytic activity.", 
    "10": "The stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by guanine nucleotides, isoproterenol and fluoride has been investigated in KCl washed rat aortic membranes. We observed that the presence of guanine nucleotides in the assay was obligatory for the isoproterenol stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity. Guanine nucleotides could stimulate adenylate cyclase in the absence of catecholamines; however, the extent of stimulation was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than that observed with isoproterenol. The order of effectiveness of guanine nucleotides was guanosine 5'-0-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP-gamma-S), 5'-guanylylimido diphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), and guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP). GTP stimulated enzyme activity without a noticeable lag period, while stimulation by Gpp(NH)p showed a lag period of 3-4 min. Addition of isoproterenol neither abolished the lag period, nor altered the apparent K1 value (concentration required for half maximal stimulation) for Gpp(NH)p stimulation. In a comparative study of adenylate cyclase activity between spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Kyoto Wistar normotensive rats (WKY), using 0.6 M KCl washed membranes from aorta and caudal artery, no differences were observed in the basal adenylate cyclase activity. However, guanine nucleotide-, isoproterenol-, and fluoride-stimulated enzyme activity was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in the caudal artery of SHR as compared to WKY.", 
    "11": "1. Hypertensive patients are particularly endangered by disproportionately high increases in blood pressure during daily physical and emotional activity. For this reason, antihypertensive drugs should also be able to influence there pressure changes. 2. Therefore the ability of the beta-receptor antagonist acebutolol (400 mg/die) and of the diuretic mefrusid (25 mg/die) to reduce exercise-induced increases in blood pressure and pressure-rate product during and after standardized ergometric work (50--100 watts) was compared in a within-patient study of 42 outpatients with arterial hypertension (stage 1 to 2, WHO) aged 18 to 50 years. 3. Both drugs resulted in a significant reduction of systolic (p less than 0.05-p less than 0.001) and diastolic (p less than 0.05-p less than 0.001) blood pressure at rest. However, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.001) and pressure-rate product (p less than 0.001) during exercise were only significantly reduced by acebutolol. 4. The strongest blood pressure lowering effect under all conditions could be proven for the free and fixed combination of acebutolol and mefrusid. 5. From these findings it is concluded: (1) beta-adreno-receptor blocking agents are the drugs of first choice in the baseline therapy of mild to moderate arterial hypertension, (2) diuretic drugs potentiate the antihypertensive effect of beta-blocking agents. 6. This therapeutic regimen is recommended especially for hypertensives with ischemic heart disease, because diuretics fail to reduce pressure-rate product as a measure of myocardial O2-consumption.", 
    "12": "The rise in resting oxygen consumption (VO2) during the 2-3 h following intragastric feeding (50 kJ [12 kcal]) was significantly greater in hyperphagic cafeteria-fed rats and hyperthyroid rats, but was markedly reduced in 3-day fasted and genetically-obese Zucker rats, compared to their respective stock-fed controls. In control and hyperthyroid animals this response was almost completely abolished by administration of propranolol. In another group of rats, resting VO/ was elevated by 8 per cent after 12 h of cafeteria feeding and was maximally increased by 20 per cent after 2.5 days on the diet. In rats previously cold-adapted (15 days at 5 degrees C) the maximal response (20 per cent) to cafeteria feeding was seen after only 12 h on the diet. These results suggest that the acute thermic response to food involves a sympathetic activation of thermogenesis, similar to that induced by chromic hyperphagia and cold-exposure, and can be influenced by genetic background plane of nutrition and thyroidal status.", 
    "13": "To determine if there are age-related changes in response to propranolol, we studied the hemodynamic effects of this beta-adrenergic-blocking agent in 19 awake chronically instrumented puppies and compared the response to that of 9 awake chronically instrumented adult dogs. Following intravenous administration of 1 mg/kg propranolol, heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, systemic arterial mean blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance were reduced similarly in all age groups of animals, However, puppies were more sensitive to the beta-adrenergic-blocking effect of propranolol than adult dogs when stressed with isoproterenol.", 
    "14": "The degree of myocardial cell necroses in pigs exposed to stress induced by a myorelaxant (succinylcholine) for about 12 min. was investigated. The Beta-adrenoceptor block propranolol was given in varying doses prior to the induced stress. The degree of necroses in these pigs was evaluated according to a point scale, ranging from 0 to 6 points, and compared with the changes found in untreated controls following stress. The blood levels of noradrenaline and adrenaline were assayed before, during an immediately after the period of stress. No protective effect of propranolol on the cardiac lesions was found when the drug was administered intravenously in a single dose of either 1 mg or 3 mg per kg. During the period of stress the blood levels of noradrenaline were high, indicating a high degree of activity in the sympatho-adrenal system. Propranolol in a single dose of 10 mg per kg intravenously reduced the number and size of heart lesions, while the blood levels of the catecholamines were lower under stress than after administration of 1 and 3 mg propranolol. After oral treatment with propranolol, 120 mg three times a day for 6 or 7 days, an almost complete absence of heart cell necrosis after the stress was obtained. The activity of the sympatho-adrenal system was elevated, as reflected by the high blood levels of catecholamines. The results indicate that stress-induced heart cell necrosis is mediated via the activity of the sympatho-adrenal system. The difference between a single and repeated doses of propranolol in protecting the heart suggests a complex of the adrenergic Beta-receptor blocker.", 
    "15": "The efficacy of propranolol used for prophylactic treatment of 122 patients with migraine is evaluated. Of the 122 patients 51 were suffering from simple or ophthalmic migraine, 43 from vasomotor cephalgia, and 28 from cervical migraine. On the basis of the data obtained the authors come to a conclusion that propranolol is an effective remedy for prevention of migraine and other headaches. According to the authors' data the optimal daily dose of the drug is 120 ml, and the treatment is to be given for not less than 12 weeks. The drug is well tolerated, and the side effects are negligible.", 
    "16": "Exercise tests were done on all patients referred to us because of ventricular premature beats. Exercise-associated ventricular tachycardia was seen in three of these patients. Once therapy for the arrhythmia was begun in two patients, we performed serial exercise tests, attempting to provoke the arrhythmia again. In the third patients, who was pregnant, we advised against strenuous physical activity and will exercise her post partum to determine whether therapy is warranted. We have shown that exercise testing can be used successfully in unmasking ventricular arrhythmias not detectable on resting evaluation.", 
    "17": "1. Studies of the subcellular distribution of two acids and three bases in adrenal medulla support the hypothesis that the charge on a drug molecule is an important factor determining its subcellular distribution in this tissue. 2. Acidic drugs carrying a negative charge do not bind well to adrenomedullary subcellular particles and accumulate predominantly in cell supernatant. 3. Basic drugs tend to bind more extensively to adrenomedullary intracellular organelles and distribute more uniformly over all subcellular fractions.", 
    "18": "Antihypertensive therapy was stopped in twenty-one patients with moderate hypertension. Almost all of them had been on combination therapy, usually propranolol or metoprolol with chlorthalidone, for more than a year. After a placebo 'wash-out' period of 4 weeks patients were randomly allocated in a controlled trial to a fixed daily dose of either 100 mg atenolol or 40 mg penbutolol for 6 weeks. Single-agent therapy at these doses successfully controlled the blood pressure in nineteen of the twenty-one patients, including six previously inadequately controlled on a combination. Although no conclusions can be drawn about the long-term benefits, in the patient population under study either penbutolol or atenolol given at a standard dose should provide good initial blood pressure control in most patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "19": "Isolated dog urinary bladder showed spontaneous miniature contractions under a steady state. In dome preparations, norepinephrine and isoproterenol decreased the frequency of miniature contractions, while epinephrine produced biphasic responses on it; increase by low concentration and decrease by high concentrations. The height of miniature contractions was decreased by these drugs. In trigone preparations, norepinephrine and epinephrine increased the frequency of miniature contractions, while isoproterenol decreased it. These drugs decreased the height of miniature contractions. In both preparations, phentolamine enhanced the decreases in frequency and height by norepinephrine, epinephrine and isoproterenol, while propranolol depressed or reversed them. A computer analysis showed positive and significant correlations between changes in tension development of bladder and frequency and height of miniature contractions. Results indicate that miniature contractions in both dome and trigone of isolated dog urinary bladder are increased by activation of alpha-adrenoceptors and decreased by activation of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "20": "A 57-year-old woman with hyperthyroidism had a loud to-and-fro bruit which persisted when the patient was inadvertently rendered hypothyroid with antithyroid drugs. Symptoms suggestive of transient cerebral ischemia prompted an angiographic study which demonstrated both normal cerebral circulation and an enormous increase in the size of thyroid vasculature. The possibility that the enhanced blood supply to the thyroid had compromised cerebral circulation (thyroid steal syndrome) was considered. The angiographic presentation of hyperthyroidism is reviewed, and the lack of specificity of thyroid bruits as a marker of hyperthyroidism in patients on antithyroid drugs is stressed.", 
    "21": "During antithyroid drug therapy hyperthyroid patients with border-line elevated serum T3 had shortening of pre-ejection period (PEP) and QKd interval (period between the onset of QRS complex and the onset of the Korotkoff arterial sound). There was a significant relationship between PEP and QKd interval with serum T3 concentration in a group of patients under medical therapy; PEP and QKd were normalized later than serum thyroid hormone concentration in such patients. Propranolol induced a prolongation of PEP and QKd interval in hyperthyroid patients. PEP and QKd are sensitive measures of metabolic status in thyrotoxic patients during antithyroid treatment.", 
    "22": "Using dogs or rabbits as model animals the effect of arterial-venous plasma concentration differences of propranolol, procainamide, griseofulvin, furosemide and theophylline on the determination of mean residence time (MRT) following intravenous administration was evaluated using standard methods. The MRT values calculated from femoral venous data were always higher (ranging from 1.5 to 109%) than those from femoral arterial data. The differences were mainly attributed to the additional residence time of drugs in the sampling tissue (leg). From a physiological point of view it appears generally more logical to assume that only the MRT calculated from arterial data using conventional methods represents the \"true\" MRT in the body. The potential pharmacokinetic significance of the present findings is discussed. New approaches, which eliminates the effect of arterial-venous plasma concentration differences on the MRT determination, are proposed.", 
    "23": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method is presented for the determination of metoprolol in human plasma. Metoprolol was extracted from plasma by a single extraction procedure with 4-methylpropranolol as the internal standard. Chromatography was done on a reversed-phase column with fluorescence detection. The minimum detectable concentration was 5.0 ng/ml of plasma. The standard curve was linear in the range evaluated, 10-300 ng/ml. The within-run coefficient of variation was 2.3-6.0%, and the day-to-day variation was 6.8%. The method is free from interference by major metoprolol metabolites.", 
    "24": "Bendroflumethiazide (Bft) was administered to 6 healthy subjects at 3 different dose levels (2.5, 5 and 10mg) in a cross-over design, either as capsules (2.5mg) or as tablets (5mg). Its pharmacokinetics were evaluated then and following administration of a fixed combination of Bft and propranolol and hydralazine to a further 7 volunteers. Plasma and urinary concentrations of Bft were determined by a new fluorimetric - thin-layer chromatography procedure. Peak plasma levels occurred after 2-3h and averaged 15, 27 and 45 microgram/l in the three dose groups. Areas under the plasma concentration - time curves (AUC0 leads to 12), which were 75, 147 and 250 microgram 1(-1)h respectively, and cumulative urinary recovery (20%) were independent of the dose administered and the type of formulation. Thus Bft kinetics proved to be linear within the dose range evaluated. The plasma clearance was calculated to be 505 ml/min, renal clearance 108 ml/min and nonrenal clearance 396 ml/min. Bioavailability of Bft was not altered following administration of the fixed combination. The amount of propranolol found in the circulation did not change, whereas that of hydralazine (determined as apparent hydralazine) increased by 59% when the fixed combination was administered.", 
    "25": "Tolmesoxide is a new, direct-acting vasodilator drug for use in the management of both hypertension and cardiac failure. In 6 essential hypertensives inadequately controlled by combined beta-blocker and diuretic therapy (average supine blood pressure 178/103 mmHg) the addition of tolmesoxide (300-900mg daily) was associated with a significant improvement in blood pressure control (average supine blood pressure 161/89 mmHg). the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of tolmesoxide have also been studied because, particularly at higher doses, the drug has been associated with upper gastrointestinal upset and it has been empirically recommended that it be taken with food. The blood pressure and heart rate responses were not significantly different when tolmesoxide was taken fasting or with food. Food resulted in a significant reduction in the peak plasma tolmesoxide concentration (2.14 microgram/ml compared to 2.97 microgram/ml) and a significant increase in the time to reach peak plasma tolmesoxide concentration (2.67 h compared to 0.63 h). Although there was no impairment of its hypotensive effect, food significantly altered the pharmacokinetics of tolmesoxide and may therefore be useful in reducing the gastrointestinal disturbance associated with its use. In the treatment of inadequately controlled hypertension, tolmesoxide has a limited role as an alternative vasodilator.", 
    "26": "The effects of metropolol (beta 1-selective), propranolol (nonselective) and clonidine (central alpha-stimulant) on plasma norepinephrine, blood pressure and heart rate were assessed at rest, during isometric work and dynamic exercise in 15 patients with moderate hypertension. Metroprolol resulted in a lower diastolic blood pressure during isometric and dynamic exercise that propranolol, which was paralleled by a lower plasma norepinephrine level during dynamic work; both beta-adrenergic blocking compounds resulted in a lower heart rate in all test situations than that obtained with clonidine; clonidine produced similar control of diastolic blood pressure to that obtained with the beta-adrenergic blocking agents, but did not clearly attenuate the systolic blood pressure response to dynamic exercise. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations tended to be lowest following clonidine, especially during dynamic work. The findings support the hypothesis that the central action of clonidine inhibits peripheral release of norepinephrine, but is insufficient to attenuate cardiac stimulation by physical exercise. The fact that propranolol caused higher plasma norepinephrine concentrations than metoprolol during exercise may explain the difference in the blood pressure responses during exercise.", 
    "27": "1. The initial heart rate response to lying down was analysed in 18 younger (23-36 years) and 10 older (48-67 years) normal subjects, and consisted of an immediate shortening of the R-R interval reaching a maximum around the third or fourth beat after lying, followed by a lengthening beyond the resting value to reach a steady level around beats 25-30. In six diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy, no cardiac acceleration occurred and the deceleration was markedly diminished. 2. In eight young normal subjects the pattern of response was altered by atropine, which abolished the initial shortening of the R-R interval over the first 10 beats. Thereafter slow but steady lengthening of the R-R interval occurred. With additional propranolol the later part of the response was further attenuated. Propranolol alone did not affect the normal pattern of response. 3. Six young normal subjects performed short periods of muscular exercise, lying, sitting and standing, and the heart rate patterns were compared with that after lying down. After both manoeuvres R-R interval shortened and then lengthened back to the resting level within 10-15 beats. Thereafter it remained steady after muscular exercise, but continued to lengthen after lying down. 4. In four young normal subjects, no initial R-R interval shortening occurred during fast or slow \"passive' tilting from the 80 degrees head-up position to horizontal, whereas shortening was seen both with fast and slow \"active' lying down. 5. It is concluded that the immediate part of the heart rate response to lying down (during the first 10 beats) is under vagal control and the later part predominantly under sympathetic control. The first part of the response is probably due to a \"muscle-heart' reflex which occurs during the change in posture.", 
    "28": "The authors report the cases of 3 patients who had depressive episodes after administration of propranolol for medical illnesses. The depressive episodes were severe, occurred in a dose-dependent manner, and promptly remitted when propranolol was discontinued. Physicians' awareness of this complication, especially in cases of patients with a history of depression, may reduce the occurrence of this drug reaction.", 
    "29": "Toxicity from cardiac drugs is a particular management challenge since the manifestations of an acute overdose and the initial indications for the drug are often similar. Plasma drug levels are essential but must be interpreted in light of the clinical picture. Hypotension, due to either vasodilatation or decreased myocardial contractility, and arrhythmias are the principal cardiac manifestations, but noncardiac effects are sometimes more troublesome. An antiarrhythmic agent of the same class should not be used in treating an arrhythmia resulting from an overdose.", 
    "30": "Benign essential tremor can be distinguished from parkinsonism by its rapid frequency, the involvement of voice and head, and the common finding of a positive family history. Essential tremor is less incapacitating than parkinsonism and less inexorably progressive. Propranolol (Inderal) is the best therapy available at this time. The transient beneficial effect of alcohol is deceptive. Patients with this disorder, although they find the tremor embarrassing, are generally not incapacitated and are otherwise in excellent health.", 
    "31": "It is well recognized that liver disease may influence the disposition of many drugs. Conversely, it has been suggested that knowledge of the disposition of a model drug might provide an index of certain aspects of hepatic function. This review discusses the physiology of drug disposition and indicates how recent progress in understanding the determinants of drug disposition has provided useful indices of individual aspects of hepatic function. Topics which are discussed are the interpretation of pharmacokinetic parameters as indices of hepatic function, including half-life clearance, and intrinsic clearance. Utilizing the \"intact hepatocyte hypothesis\" as an operational model, an approach is described that uses the pharmacokinetic disposition of high and low intrinsic clearance drugs following p.o. and i.v. administration to provide quantitative estimates of hepatic function, flow to functioning hepatocytes, and the extent of portasystemic shunting through the liver. Thus, the theoretical basis for quantitation of certain aspects of hepatic function are available. It remains to be determined whether these indices will provide clinically useful measures to follow the natural history of hepatic disease.", 
    "32": "The comparative efficacy of verapamil (360 mg daily) and propranolol (240 mg daily) was evaluated with computerized treadmill exercise in 22 patients with chronic stable angina in a placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study with 4 weeks on each active phase. Fourteen of these patients still had angina despite active drug therapy and they were further treated with a combination of verapamil (360 mg) and propranolol (120 mg) for 4 weeks. The mean exercise time for these patients taking placebo was 4.8 +/- 0.22 minutes (mean +/- standard error of the mean) and this increased to 6.8 +/- 0.64 minutes with propranolol and 8.0 +/- 0.5 minutes with verapamil. A further increase to 10.1 +/- 0.88 minutes was observed with the combination of both drugs and seven patients became symptom-free. S-T segment criteria improved with both drugs, and combination therapy produced a further reduction in peak S-T depression. Electrocardiographic ambulatory monitoring showed no evidence of conduction defects and mean hourly heart rates were similar to those seen with propranolol alone. Left ventricular function indexes were not significantly different from those obtained with propranolol. Combination therapy with verapamil and propranolol appears to be efficacious in the treatment of selected patients with severe chronic stable angina. The patients need to be carefully monitored for adverse effects.", 
    "33": "Eight patients taking metoprolol (300 mg/day) for essential hypertension were studied after abrupt withdrawal and placebo replacement of the drug. A 52% average rebound increase in cardiac chronotropic sensitivity to isoproterenol and 15% rebound rise in resting heart rate occurred in all patients between 2 to 8 days after metoprolol withdrawal (P less than 0.05). Holter monitoring showed no associated arrhythmia. A transient increase in blood pressure occurred in one patient and withdrawal-like symptoms were noted in three patients. There were no meaningful changes in plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, thyroxine, or triiodothyronine. Seven of the eight patients were again studied serially after the same metoprolol dosing, during a prolonged low-dose withdrawal schedule (50 mg/day for 10 days) and during placebo. Prolonged low dose before complete metoprolol withdrawal decreased but did not completely prevent the changes observed after abrupt withdrawal. The observed rebound of cardiac beta-adrenergic sensitivity may have application to the mechanism and prevention of the beta-blocker syndrome in patients with angina.", 
    "34": "Six manic patients, drug-free for at least 10 days, were treated with high doses (up to 3,000 mg/day, corresponding serum levels up to 1,600 ng/ml) of d-propranolol or dl-propranolol in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The EEG's of these patients were studied over a maximum period of 21 days. All 82 EEG's were normal, they showed neither epileptic patterns nor any other signs for hypersynchronisation, as a possible side-effect of propranolol, nor other abnormalities, due to the manic condition. Analysis by fast-fourier-transformation produced no difference between the effect of d-propranolol or dl-propranolol on EEG compared intra- and inter-hemispherically by power-spectra, cross-spectra, phase-differences and coherences. At high serum levels (more than 1,000 ng/ml) there was a corresponding increase of power and a drop in frequency of the alpha-activity, maximally--1.1 c/s, which probably depended on the serum level. This result is in agreement with the hypothesis of a direct antimanic effect of the drug and comparable to the clinical effect of lithium, which produces similar changes in EEG. A comparison of the propranolol-induced EEG changes with EEG changes usually induced by sedative drugs, contradicts the hypothesis that the antimatic properties of propranolol are caused by unspecific sedation.", 
    "35": "Insulin hypoglycaemia was induced three times in 6 insulin-dependent, hypertensive diabetics: before instituting antihypertensive long-term treatment and after obtaining a satisfactory blood pressure with either alprenolol or metoprolol given in a randomized order. The blood glucose concentration (1.6-1.9 mmol/l) at which the hypoglycaemia necessitated intravenous administration of glucose was almost identical on all three occasions. During hypoglycaemia the systolic and diastolic blood pressures increased significantly by a mean maximal rise of 27/14 mmHg on alprenolol treatment, but remained unchanged on metoprolol. The responses of adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol, and growth hormone did not differ significantly on the three occasions. None of the beta-adrenergic drugs counteracted the early hormone defence mechanisms in hypoglycaemia and the signs of hypoglycaemia were not masked. The haemodynamic response was altered only by the non-selective (alprenolol) and not by the selective beta-adrenergic blocking agent (metoprolol).", 
    "36": "In a multicentre, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study, the antihypertensive effect of labetalol 100 mg and chlorthalidone 10 mg, given alone or in combination, has been assessed in 32 hypertensive patients. The combination had a greater effect in reducing blood pressure than did its separate components. This was particularly evident after exercise. Heart rate increased during chlorthalidone therapy, decreased during labetalol therapy, and a summation effect was observed during treatment with the combination. In most cases additivity was observed, as no interaction between the single components was observed, except for heart rate after exercise, and for diastolic blood pressure in the upright position. No interaction was observed either in the biochemical indices or in the clinical side-effects.", 
    "37": "A double-blind, cross-over study in 16 patients with essential hypertension was carried out, to evaluate any possible interference by indomethacin, a known prostaglandin-synthetase inhibitor, with the antihypertensive effect of oxprenolol, a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent. Both indomethacin and oxprenolol, as well as the two drugs combined, inhibited plasma renin activity; no change was found in urinary sodium excretion or body weight. Oxprenolol alone caused a highly significant decrease in the systolic ( - 10.4 mmHg, p less than 0.001), diastolic ( - 7.4 mmHg, p less than 0.001) and mean ( - 7.7 mmHg, p less than 0.01) blood pressures, whereas indomethacin did not influence blood pressure. When the two drugs were given in combination, blood pressure decreased (systolic: - 5.9 mmHg; diastolic: - 4.0 mmHg; mean: - 4.6 mmHg), but the changes induced in blood pressure were reduced by about 50% when compared with those in the oxprenolol alone period. The data show that indomethacin seems to interfere with the antihypertensive effect of oxprenolol, by an action which may be due to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.", 
    "38": "Sixteen patients with essential hypertension completed a double blind factorial trial comparing the effects of indapamide (2.5 mg daily) and pindolol (10 mg daily) on blood pressure, heart rate, plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration. There were four randomised test phases of eight weeks each during which patients received indapamide alone, pindolol alone, indapamide plus pindolol and no active treatment (placebo). Blood pressure and heart rate were measured every two weeks. Supine mean arterial pressure fell from 117 mm Hg in the placebo phase to 111 mm Hg in the indapamide phase, 106 mm Hg in the pindolol phase and 103 mm Hg in the combined indapamide plus pindolol phase. Factorial analysis confirmed that the hypotensive effects of the two drugs were additive, without evidence of potentiation or antagonism. Indapamide caused significant reductions in plasma potassium and chloride, and increases in plasma bicarbonate and urate concentrations; it also caused increases in plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration. These changes are similar to those observed with thiazide diuretics.", 
    "39": "A double-blind, crossover study was carried out in 32 Sudanese patients with essential hypertension to assess the effectiveness of single daily doses of 400 mg acebutolol when given alone and in combination with single daily doses of hydroclorothiazide/amiloride diuretic. The results show that in both groups there was a statistically significant reduction in systolic and diastolic levels throughout the treatment period. After crossover at 6 weeks, those patients initiated on acebutolol alone showed a further reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressures when the hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride combination was added. Both treatment regimens were well-tolerated and only a few side-effects were reported.", 
    "40": "1 Pindolol is a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent; its affinity to adrenoceptors in guinea pig atria (beta 1) is not significantly different from that in guinea pig trachea (beta 1 + beta 2) and canine vascular smooth muscle (beta 2). 2 Pindolol displays a striking diversity of agonist activities in isolated tissues. Stimulant effects correspond to 40--50% of the maximum effects of isoprenaline in isolated kitten atria and guinea pig trachea and to only 10% in guinea pig atria. Effects in canine isolated mesenteric vessels are those of a full agonist, maximum responses equaling those of isoprenaline. These findings suggest that the stimulant effects of pindolol are exerted principally on beta 2-adrenoceptors. 3 Cardiac stimulation produced by pindolol in the dog is sufficient to compensate for the cardiac depression resulting from blockade of beta-adrenoceptors in the heart. Reductions in cardiac output and compensatory increases in total peripheral resistance do not occur or are much smaller than those produced by beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents lacking sympathomimetic activity. 4 Pindolol-induced relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle prevents or minimizes the bronchoconstrictor effects of injected spasmogens in the cat. 5 Pindolol has marked vasodilator activity, small doses reducing femoral and mesenteric vascular resistance by approximately 30%. Doses comparable to those used in hypertensive patients lower blood pressure by 20 mmHg in non-anaesthetized dogs.", 
    "41": "In adult male rats the effect of a subchronic treatment with trilostane, a new, orally active, competitive inhibitor of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, on adrenal steroid production and morphology was studied. Rats were treated with 150 mg or 300 mg trilostane/kg/day for 7 or 14 days and with 150 mg trilostane/kg/day for 10 days in combination with 75 mg propranolol/kg/day or 1 mg indomethacin/kg/day. Trilostane leads to a dose-dependent increase in adrenal weight and to a rather uniform increase in nuclear volumes of zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata cells. The basal secretion of aldosterone and corticosterone is not significantly altered. Trilostane increases the excretion of sodium and potassium in urine. The stimulating effect of trilostane on plasma renin activity and the adrenal enlargement are not inhibited by propranolol or indomethacin. We conclude that trilostane induces latent adrenal insufficiency. Increased renin and ACTH maintain normal basal steroid levels, and might impair the therapeutic effectiveness of trilostane.", 
    "42": "An open crossover study was carried out in 10 Arab patients with mild to moderate hypertension to compare the effectiveness and tolerability of labetalol with alpha-methyldopa. Patients were started on either 100 mg labetalol or 250 mg alpha-methyldopa 3-times daily and, if necessary, the dosage adjusted by standard increments every 2 weeks over a period of a month until satisfactory control was achieved. This dosage was then maintained for a further 6 weeks before the patients were crossed over to the alternative treatment, similarly adjusted, after a wash-out period of 2 weeks on placebo. The results showed that both treatments produced effective blood pressure control and there was no significant difference in the maximum reduction achieved. The effect of the two drugs on heart rate was also similar. Both treatments were generally well-tolerated and side-effects were mild and similar with either drug.", 
    "43": "Penbutolol (Hoe 893d), a long-acting non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, was given once daily to 23 patients with primary hypertension, WHO Stages I-II. The dose (50-100mg) needed to achieve the therapeutic goal, i.e. supine diastolic BP less than 95 mm Hg, was titrated individually. On a daily dose of penbutolol 83 +/- 19 mg (mean +/- SD) blood pressure (BP, mean +/- SD) fell from 180 +/- 21/112 +/- 8 mmHg on placebo to 154 +/- 25/94 +/- 14 mmHg. 18 patients who reached the therapeutic goal (responders) continued in a double blind, cross-over study versus placebo, during which the supine BP fell on average 20/10 mmHg on the same dose of penbutolol, and 2/1 mmHg on placebo. Plasma concentrations (mean +/- SD) of free 0.10 +/- 0.07 microgram/ml) and total (2.02 +/- 1.39 microgram/ml) penbutolol did not differ between responders and nonresponders, and were not correlated with the fall in BP. Side effects were mild and mostly well tolerated. One patient developed dermatitis and another an elevation of liver enzymes.", 
    "44": "Prazosin is a post synaptic alpha adrenergic blocker effective in hypertension, whose hypotensive effect is unaccompanied by reflex tachycardia or hyperreninemia, nor by other evidence of increased sympathetic activity. We studied the baroreceptor reflex arc as a potential mediator of these effects. Twenty-two essential hypertensive men were treated with prazosin alone versus placebo, and experienced a blood pressure fall (from 114.8 +/- 3.6 down to 101.1 +/- 2.5 mmHg, p less than 0.005) unaccompanied by any change in heart rate, plasma renin activity, or several other indices of sympathetic nervous system activity (plasma dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity; urinary excretion of free catecholamines and vanillyl mandelic acid; all p less than 0.1). Concomitant with the blood pressure fall, there was a significant depression of baroreflex arc sensitivity, from 11.4 +/- 2.0 ms/mmHg down to 6.6 +/- 1.9 ms/mmHg (p less than 0.05), without an associated change in cardiac vagal inhibition (291.2 +/- 46.2 versus 300.3 +/- 19.2 ms, p greater than 0.1). Baroreflex arc sensitivity depression may in part explain the lack of reflex sympathetic outflow noted during prazosin treatment of hypertension.", 
    "45": "The effect of a propranolol-hydrochlorothiazide combination tablet was compared with the effects of its two components alone in the twice-daily treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension (100 to 125 mmHg diastolic blood pressure). Propranolol alone or in combination was given at 80, 160, 240, or 320 mg/day; hydrochlorothiazide, at 50 mg/day. After a 3-week placebo period, a 12-week single-blind dose-finding test with the combination was held: 149/158 (94%) patients had decreases greater than or equal to 10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. Mean systolic and diastolic pressures were reduced by 26.6 mmHg 917%) and 19.2 mmHg (18.6%), respectively (P less than 0.001). A 10-week double-blind parallel treatment test followed, in which patients were assigned by random code to combination tablet, propranolol, or hydrochlorothiazide. There were significantly larger increases (P less than 0.05) in mean systolic or diastolic pressure with each component than with the combination from the end of dose-finding to each of the last four biweekly visits, to the mean of those four visits, and to the endpoint (last visit). The mean increases in pressure at the endpoint evaluation were (systolic/diastolic): combination (n = 47), 3.0/1.5 mmHg; propranolol (n = 51), 10.2/6.3 mmHg; hydrochlorothiazide (n = 52), 13.1/9.3 mmHg. During the double-blind period, no significant differences were demonstrated between the proportions of patients in each treatment group reporting new complaints. This study showed the combination to be as safe as, and more effective than, either component given at the same dose strength.", 
    "46": "Eighty milligrams of propranolol or sotalol was administered orally to two groups of 8 parturients who were to undergo elective cesarean section. This was performed 3 hours after drug administration. The transplacental passage of both drugs was registered in each patient. The maternal concentration of propranolol was approximately four times that in the umbilical circulation, while the sotalol level in maternal circulation was twice that in the umbilical circulation. The administration of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists caused a significant decrease in maternal plasma renin activity. After these doses of beta blockers, no difference in the plasma renin activity was found in the umbilical circulation, when compared with the previous normal values at cesarean section.", 
    "47": "These experiments show that pretreatment with propranolol was able to achieve significant infarct size reduction in this particular animal model of LAD occlusion followed by reperfusion through a critical stenosis. Despite infarct size reduction, the propranolol pretreatment prolonged the time course of spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias after acute myocardial infarction in the conscious dog. In contrast to this, propranolol pretreatment did not appear to protect against inducible ventricular arrhythmias in the late postinfarction period in the conscious dog. While it is, of course, impossible to extrapolate the results of animal studies to the clinical situation, future clinical studies designed to limit infarct size by pharmacologic intervention should specifically address the question of electrophysiologic instability after myocardial infarction, both in the early and late phases. The possibility exists that pharmacologic limitation of infarct size may preserve viable but potentially jeopardized areas of myocardium, leaving the risk of subsequent malignant arrhythmias and sudden death.", 
    "48": "Oral atenolol (25, 50 and 100mg) and placebo administered once daily were tested in a double-masked, randomized cross-over study. Ten patients (18 eyes) who had untreated intraocular pressure (IOP) greater than or equal to 22 mm Hg participated. A fall in IOP was observed 2 h after administration, with a mean maximum after 2-5 h. The decrease in IOP was dose-dependent and persisted 24 h during treatment with the higher doses. After 7-day treatment a significant decrease in IOP was still noted 24 h after intake of 50 and 100 mg. The mean maximum decrease in IOP was observed at the same time as on day 1, but the fall in IOP was slightly diminished. During the treatment period a reduction in pulse rate was seen with all the doses tested. A fall in systemic blood pressure was also observed with the higher doses. Two patients reported side effects that could be related to haemodynamic influence.", 
    "49": "In a randomized cross-over trial the combination labetalol/hydrochlorothiazide was compared with the combination of propranolol/hydralazine/hydrochlorothiazide in 34 uncomplicated hypertensive patients, who were not satisfactorily controlled with hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg alone. The elevated diastolic pressure (D.P.) in 27 patients responded satisfactorily to the labetalol schedule and in 28 patients to the propranolol/hydralazine schedule. No difference was found in the rate of decrease of D.P., nor in the disappearance of hypertension-related complaints. Although the duration of the washout between treatments was at least one month, treatment was significantly more efficacious during the second period. Labetalol pre-treatment especially seemed to enhance the effect of subsequent propranolol/hydralazine administration. Side effects due to therapy were rare and were not related to any particular treatment. The median daily dose of labetalol in responders was 600 mg and that of propranolol/hydralazine 120/60 mg (in both therapies hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg was given in addition). Patients showed a slight preference for the labetalol medication. It is concluded that labetalol/hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol/hydralazine/hydrochlorothiazide are equally satisfactory in the treatment of uncomplicated hypertension.", 
    "50": "Plasma aldosterone (PA), plasma renin activity (PRA), extracellular fluid volume (EFV) and hepatic blood flow were measured in forty-four patients with sustained essential hypertension and compared with forty-two normotensive controls of same age and sex. All patient had inulin clearances within the normal range and balanced sodium intake and urinary output. In hypertensives, PA, PRA, EFV and hepatic blood flow were within normal ranges; the log-ratio PA:PRA was significantly elevated (P less than 0.001). In normotensives, a negative relationship was observed between PA and EFV (r=-0.55; P less than 0.001) while a positive relationship was observed between PA and PRA (=+0.70; P less than 0.001). In hypertensives, the two relationships were disrupted or less significant: for a given value of EFV, PA was more elevated in hypertensives than in normotensives; for a given value of PRA, PA was more evaluated in hypertensives than in normotensives. The results could not be explained on the basis of a disturbance in hepatic blood flow and/or in the metabolic clearance rate of aldosterone. The study provided evidence that, in patients with sustained essential hypertension and equilibrated sodium balance, there is an excess of plasma aldosterone relative to the levels of extracellular fluid volume and plasma renin activity. The excess of probably related to an abnormality in the adrenal secretion.", 
    "51": "Five commonly used antiarrhythmic agents are examined with regard to their pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, electrophysiology, and clinical utility. The effective, nontoxic plasma levels are noted, and important drug--drug interactions with these agents are noted. Monitoring plasma levels of these agents serves a useful function in that it identifies patients who are not compliant, who are taking too little drug, or who are taking too much drug. Current techniques do not allow rapid, reproducible, and inexpensive measurements of free (vs. bound) drug in the plasma, a quantity that is likely to be substantially more valuable in determining drug effect than total plasma concentration. Previous studies on drug effectiveness may not have taken into account natural fluctuations in arrhythmia frequencies that mimic drug effect.", 
    "52": "In a double-blind crossover study, the antihypertensive effect of hydrochlorothiazide alone and in combination with the beta blocker acebutolol was assessed in 18 patients suffering from mild to moderate hypertension. After a placebo period, the patients were placed on hydrochlorothiazide alone for four weeks at a dose of 50 mg daily. Acebutolol was than gradually titrated into the regimen until the optimum dose was established. The average dose was 555 mg per day, with the usual optimum dose 200 mg b.i.d. The patients then entered the crossover portion of the trial during which patients received either hydrocholorothiazide with acebutolol or hydrochlorothiazide with placebo. Each treatment period lasted six weeks. Blood pressure and heart rate were significantly lower with the combination treatment than with hydrochlorothiazide alone. At the end of each treatment period, the mean diastolic blood pressure (erect) was 90.5 mm Hg with hydrochlorothiazide-acebutolol but remained above 100 mm Hg with the diuretic alone. Neither hydrochlorothiazide nor acebutolol produced any significant changes in plasma renin activity or plasma aldosterone. There were very few side effects and no reports of bradycardia.", 
    "53": "A convenient methods for determining the overall insulin sensitivity of small animals was established based on the steady state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentration methods of Shen, Reaven and Farguhar (1970). Subcutaneous injection into C57BL/6 mice of saline containing epinephrine, propranolol, glucose and (3H-3)glucose with or without insulin gave steady state levels of blood glucose (SSBG), plasma insulin (SSPI) and specific activity of blood glucose (SSBG), plasma insulin (SSPI) and specific activity of blood glucose after 45 minutes. Glucose turnover (GTN) and hepatic glucose output (HGO) were computed using specific activity of blood glucose and the influx rate of injected glucose. The method was applied to diabetic and insulin resistant mice, KK. There was no difference in GTN and HGO between KK and C57BL/6 mice regardless of whether insulin was injected or not. SSPI of both strains increased in the same injected or not, SSPI of both strains increased in the same injected or not. SSPI of both strains increased in the same fashion in response to increasing doses of the hormone. SSBG of both strains fell in response to increasing SSPI level, but the response of SSBG was less prominent in KK mice. Consequently, the insulin dose-response curve of SSBG apparently shifted rightwards in KK mice.", 
    "54": "THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS INVESTIGATION WERE: (a) to characterize the time and dose dependence of the effects of prostacyclin (PGI(2)) on renin release in healthy men; (b) to define whether PGI(2)-induced renin release is secondary to hemodynamic changes; (c) to determine the plasma and urine concentrations of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) (the stable breakdown product of PGI(2)) associated with renin release induced by exogenous or pharmacologically enhanced endogenous PGI(2). Intravenous PGI(2) or 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) infusions at nominal rates of 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 ng/kg per min were performed in each of six normal human subjects; in three of them, PGI(2) infusion was repeated after beta-adrenergic blockade and cyclooxygenase inhibition. PGI(2), but not 6-keto-PGF(1alpha), caused a time- and dose-dependent increase of plasma renin activity, which reached statistical significance at 5.0 ng/kg per min and was still significantly elevated 30 min after discontinuing the infusion. Although combined propranolol and indomethacin treatment significantly enhanced the hypotensive effects of infused PGI(2), it did not modify the dose-related pattern of PGI(2)-induced renin release. Plasma 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) levels rose from undetectable levels (<7.5 pg/ml) in a stepwise fashion during increasingly higher infusion rates of PGI(2) or 6-keto-PGF(1alpha). The threshold concentration of plasma 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) associated with a statistically significant stimulation of renin release was approximately 200 pg/ml. Upon discontinuing PGI(2) or 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) infusion, the disappearance of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) from blood showed an identical biphasic behavior, the initial phase having an apparent t((1/2)) of 3.2 min. The intravenous infusion of furosemide, which is known to stimulate renin release via a cyclooxygenase-dependent mechanism, caused a three-to fourfold increase of urinary 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) excretion rate, concomitant with the elevation of plasma renin activity levels, in six healthy women. 6-Keto-PGF(1alpha) remained undetectable in peripheral venous plasma throughout the study. WE CONCLUDE THAT IN HUMAN SUBJECTS: (a) PGI(2)-induced renin release occurs with a dose and time dependence similar to its reported platelet effects; (b) PGI(2)-induced renin release is not mediated by adrenergic stimuli or cyclooxygenase-dependent mechanisms secondary to hemodynamic changes; (c) furosemide-induced renin release is associated with increased renal PGI(2) formation; and (d) PGI(2) appears to act as a local modulator rather than a circulating hormone in controlling juxtaglomerular function.", 
    "55": "In certain cases because of sinus arrhythmia and/or anarchic return and postreturn cycles caused by premature atrial stimulation, the sinoatrial conduction time cannot be calculated since a chaotic postextrasystolic pattern appears. We examined 49 patients with a history and ECG signs suggesting sinus node dysfunction by programmed extrastimulation method as proposed by Strauss et al. prior to and after pharmacologic autonomic blockade (with propranolol 0.2 mg/kg body weight and atropine sulfate 0.04 mg/kg intravenously). Patients with normal intrinsic heart rate (IHR) (n = 31) showed chaotic postextrasystolic responses in 38%, which in every case could be eliminated by autonomic blockade, resulting in a clear I and II phase with a well estimated intrinsic conduction time. Patients with pathologic IHR (n = 18) gave chaotic responses in 22% which after drug testing increased up to 72%. The chaotic postextrasystolic patterns are to be interpreted as the desynchronization of the sinus potentials, while plateau (phase II) as functional integrity, synchronized activity of the sinus node, dependent on the momentaneous balance of the autonomous tone, and on the integrity of the pacemaker cells. The desynchronized chaotic responses are considered on one hand as a dystonic neurovegetative electrophysiologic characteristic, on the other hand as a primary extrastimulation parameter of the intrinsic sinus node dysfunction.", 
    "56": "A dose-dependent decrease in exploratory activity of naive rats was observed after 5-20 mg/kg i.p. of salbutamol. This effect was antagonized by the pretreatment with propranolol and yohimbine. Furthermore, in a single dose of mg/kg salbutamol increased clonidine-induced hypoactivity. By contrast to acute effects, repetitive administration of salbutamol (5 mg/kg twice daily for 10 days) failed to change exploratory activity of rats and abolished the clonidine-induced hypoactivity. The results demonstrate differences in the acute and chronic effects of salbutamol on behaviour which may indicate changes in the sensitivity of adrenergic pre- as well as postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors. Tentatively, the results could be explained by development of alpha2-adrenoceptor subsensitivity and the involvement of beta-adrenoceptors in the regulation of their activity.", 
    "57": "Four patients with ventricular arrhythmias due to sotalol intoxication were successfully treated with overdrive pacing. In three patients the reason for sotalol overdose was a suicidal attempt and in the fourth patient the reason was unknown. In all cases a prolongation of the Q-T interval was seen, which is a typical feature of sotalol overdose. Other features of beta-blocker intoxication like bradycardia were found in all patients and hypotension in two patients. Three of four patients received lidocaine, but with no effect on multiple ventricular premature beats (VPB) or ventricular tachycardia (VT) of \"torsade de pointes\"-type. Overdrive pacing abolished immediately VPBs and VTs in three patients, and in the fourth patient there was apparent decrease in dysrhythmia. Temporary overdrive pacing is suggested as treatment of ventricular arrhythmias in association with prolonged Q-T interval caused by overdose of sotalol.", 
    "58": "Eleven patients with essential hypertension participated in a double-blind cross-over comparison of labetalol (L) and propranolol (P). Each drug was given for 5--8 weeks. The dose reducing the supine diastolic blood pressure when given b.d. to or below 90 mm Hg was titrated out. At the end of each period, isometric exercise (sustained handgrip) and calf plethysmography were performed. L (mean daily dose 636 mg) was slightly more effective in lowering supine and standing blood pressure than P (mean dose 276 mg). There was no significant difference between the drugs in their effect on the blood-pressure response to handgrip. However, compared with no treatment, L attenuated the blood-pressure rise at near-maximal handgrip; this has not been reported with other beta-blockers. Resting vascular resistance and basal vascular tone were significantly lower (20%, p less than 0.05) during treatment with labetalol than when the patients were taking propranolol. - The differences may be explained by the alpha-receptorblocking action of labetalol.", 
    "59": "Single doses of labetalol (200 mg i.v. over 5 min, 200 and 400 mg orally) were given to five healthy men on three different occasions. Plasma levels were followed for up to 25 h and blood pressure for 5 h. The elimination half-life was 1.6 to 8.5 h for the first 8 h. The oral bioavailability ranged from 4 to 23%. All doses induced a significant fall in systolic blood pressure at 2 h, the peak effect occurring at 30--120 (mean 63-72) min. After intravenous administration the peak supine blood-pressure fall was significant for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and occurred 16 min after administration.", 
    "60": "Labetalol was given to women with hypertension of pregnancy in their last trimester to study its acute effect on circulation and metabolism. Seven women were given 50 mg labetalol i v. There was a significant decrease of blood pressure from a mean of 143/101 +/- 4/2 (SEM) to 127/88 +/- 5/2 mm Hg. Maternal heart rate fell significantly from 77 +/- 5 to 68 +/- 3 beats per min. These changes persisted during a three-hour observation period. The hypotensive response was accompanied by a significant increase in plasma noradrenaline from 1.54 +/- 0.16 to 2.37 +/- 0.41 nmol/l, suggesting sympathetic activation. Plasma cyclic AMP, which is increased by beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation, was significantly elevated after labetalol. This supports the hypothesis of partial beta-agonist activity of labetalol. Lipid metabolism, as judged from measurements of plasma FFA, glycerol and 3-hydroxybuturic acid, showed little change. The acute effect of labetalol on uteroplacental blood flow was determined in eight women with pregnancy hypertension using a gammacamera on line with a computer. 0.5 mCi indium-113m was given i v before and 30 min after labetalol was administered i v in a dose of 1 mg per kg body weight. After the injections of indium-113m, serial scintigrams were recorded during 10 s periods for 240 s. By computerized summation of the scintigrams, an image was obtained in which the placenta could be outlined for time-activity analysis of the isotope accumulation curve. From this curve a uteroplacental blood flow index could be calculated. Labetalol induced a significant drop of mean arterial blood pressure from 114 +/- mm Hg to 100 +/- 3 mm Hg after 30 min in this group of women. However, the uteroplacental blood flow index did not change. As we have earlier shown with this technique that uteroplacental blood flow can be severely impaired in hypertension of pregnancy, the finding of substained uteroplacental blood flow simultaneously with a decrease in blood pressure should be of clinical importance. Taken together with other studies of clinical effects, these results indicate that labetalol is useful in the treatment of hypertension of pregnancy.", 
    "61": "Labetalol (Trandate) is a new antihypertensive agent with both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties. In a double-blind cross-over study the antihypertensive action and side-effects of labetalol and propranolol were compared in 18 previously untreated outpatients with hypertension, WHO stage I--III. Mean daily dose of labetalol was 667 mg and of propranolol 129 mg. Labetalol reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the seated and upright position significantly more than propranolol. The pulse rate reduction was greater with propranolol. Side-effects were more pronounced with propranolol. The antihypertensive effect, effect on pulse rate and pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of 400 mg labetalol were studied in 6 patients with normal and 6 patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance less than 20 ml/min), all belonging to WHO stage I--II. A significant fall in pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed in both groups, the duration being more than 25 h. No difference was found between the two groups. From the serum concentration-time curves the elimination rate constant, elimination half-life and area under the curve were calculated. The mean values of the two groups did not differ significantly. A pronounced interindividual variation was found in both groups.", 
    "62": "The response of elderly hypertensive patients to labetalol, possessing alpha- and beta-blocking properties, was studied. The dosage was first titrated out and assessed in a double-blind cross-over trial. Altogether 24 patients were treated for one year. The dosage established during the titration period maintained its efficacy. In most cases 200 mg labetalol daily gave satisfactory result. The side-effects were few. The only reason for discontinuance of the drug was gastrointestinal discomfort. Because of the low dosage, the typical side-effects of beta-blockade were lacking and alpha-blockade seemed to be well tolerated. The normal precautions in the treatment of elderly hypertensive patients should be observed.", 
    "63": "In 12 patients with resistant hypertension labetalol was added to existing therapy. The average dose was 1333 mg (range 400--3600). The subjects were followed up for three and a half years. Mean supine blood pressure (BP) was reduced from 202/123 to 163/103 mm Hg and mean standing BP from 193/127 to 144/100 mm Hg. Mean BP after exercise was 134/93 mm Hg. The main side-effect was postural hypotension during exercise, causing withdrawal of labetalol in two subjects. In patients with severe hypertension, resistant to several combinations of antihypertensive drugs, the addition of labetalol may lead to satisfactory BP reduction, especially when combined with a potent diuretic.", 
    "64": "Ten men reported vasospastic symptoms in their hands during metoprolol treatment. They had no signs of occlusive arterial disease. The temperature reaction to local cooling was measured and no improvement was found after changing to pindolol. Vasospastic symptoms during beta-receptor blockade may arise in predisposed individuals irrespective of the type of beta-receptor antagonist used.", 
    "65": "Prenalterol (H 133/22) is an adrenergic beta-receptor stimulator which unlike isoproterenol is both orally active and has a long duration of action. The inotropic, chronotropic and dromotropic effects of prenalterol were investigated in pentobarbital anaesthetized dogs. Prenalterol was found to increase left ventricular maximum dP/dt in a dose-dependent manner up to a dose level of 50 micrograms/kg. Additional doses resulted in only small further increases in cardiac contractility. Electrophysiological studies were done to compare the effects of prenalterol and isoproterenol on sinus node and ventricular pacemaker function. Complete AV block was produced by electrocauterization of the His bundle. Prenalterol accelerated both ventricular and sinus node pacemakers at doses up to 50 micrograms/kg. The increase in ventricular rate was greater than the increase in sinus rate following supramaximal inotropic doses of prenalterol yet no ventricular extrasystoles were ever observed. Similar acceleration of the ventricular and sinus node pacemakers were observed by infusion of isoproterenol. Prenalterol and isoproterenol accelerated AV nodal conduction and ventricular conduction but had little effect upon His-Purkinje conduction. Sinus node reset time was abbreviated as was the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium and AV nodes.", 
    "66": "In 52 patients with labile hypertension and also in experimental hypertension in 52 rats dynamics of kallikrein-kinin system in the blood during obsidan and hemiton treatment has been studied to find relationship between the hypotensive action of these drugs and the blood kinins activity. It was found that there exist counter-directional shifts in the kallikrein-kinin system of the blood as a result of treatment depending on their initial level. Adequate therapy contributed to the maintenance of optimum kinin concentration for preservation of homeostasis. With hypertensive syndrome supervening in rats increase of kinin predecessor synthesis has been recorded. Chronic administration of obsidan (0.5 mg/kg) and hemiton (0.1 mg/kg for 20 days increased kininogenesis)."
