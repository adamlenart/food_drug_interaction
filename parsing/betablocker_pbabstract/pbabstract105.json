The different pharmacological properties of these drugs in relation to clinical outcomes raises questions as to their optimal desirable profile based on studies showing the undesirable effects of excessive \u03b2(2)-AR activation. The rationale for the use of selective \u03b2(2)-AR antagonists in heart failure is discussed.", 
    "1": "In the perioperative setting, there is still a high incidence of adverse cardiac events due to sudden coronary plaque rupture or oxygen supply-demand imbalance. \u03b2-Blockers play an important role in preventing these cardiac events. Discussion, however, remains on the side effects accompanying this therapy.",

    "3": "In perioperative care, \u03b2-blockers are recommended and can be given safely when started early in a low dose, titrated to heart rate. In the future, there could be a place for added perioperative short-acting \u03b2-blockers to further optimize heart rate control.", 
    "4": "Flow research of the development of receptor bronchial system was conducted in this work since the first day in 4th week of extra-uterine life, by following reactions of isolated tracheal rings in acetylcholine (Ach), histamine (Hist), and prostaglandin (PGF2-alfa) in concentrations of: 10(-4), 10(-3), 10(-2), 10(-1), mol/dm3, at piggy's of ages: 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks and 4 weeks. Results shows that Ach causes reaction of smooth muscles since the first day of extra-uterine life in a significant way (p < 0.01). Whilst propranolol (P) not emphasis the effect of Ach in a significant way (p > 0.1). Whereas histamine, and PGF2- alpha does not cause constriction of tracheal smooth musculature (MLT) in the first days of extra-uterine life. This shows that cholinergic and adrenergic system in airways of pigs is developed in intrauterine life and reaction was registered since the first day of extra-uterine life, whereas other receptor systems are developed in later weeks of extra-uterine life. Potential explanation of this mechanism of constriction of tracheal rings smooth musculature, dependence-age, is increase of the Calcium ions influx throughout \"receptor-activating\" and \"voltage operating\" channels in cells of the pigs tracheal smooth musculature in the first days of extra-uterine life.", 
    "5": "In cerebellar Purkinje cells, the \u03b24-subunit of voltage-dependent Na(+) channels has been proposed to serve as an open-channel blocker giving rise to a \"resurgent\" Na(+) current (I (NaR)) upon membrane repolarization. Notably, the \u03b24-subunit was recently identified as a novel substrate of the \u03b2-secretase, BACE1, a key enzyme of the amyloidogenic pathway in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we asked whether BACE1-mediated cleavage of \u03b24-subunit has an impact on I (NaR) and, consequently, on the firing properties of Purkinje cells. In cerebellar tissue of BACE1-/- mice, mRNA levels of Na(+) channel \u03b1-subunits 1.1, 1.2, and 1.6 and of \u03b2-subunits 1-4 remained unchanged, but processing of \u03b24 peptide was profoundly altered. Patch-clamp recordings from acutely isolated Purkinje cells of BACE1-/- and WT mice did not reveal any differences in steady-state properties and in current densities of transient, persistent, and resurgent Na(+) currents. However, I (NaR) was found to decay significantly faster in BACE1-deficient Purkinje cells than in WT cells. In modeling studies, the altered time course of I (NaR) decay could be replicated when we decreased the efficiency of open-channel block. In current-clamp recordings, BACE1-/- Purkinje cells displayed lower spontaneous firing rate than normal cells. Computer simulations supported the hypothesis that the accelerated decay kinetics of I (NaR) are responsible for the slower firing rate. Our study elucidates a novel function of BACE1 in the regulation of neuronal excitability that serves to tune the firing pattern of Purkinje cells and presumably other neurons endowed with I (NaR).",

Health profession's regulatory authorities, mandated to be publicly accountable for safe and effective care, are revising their quality assurance programs to focus on regular evaluations of practitioner performance. New methods for routine screening of performance are required and the use of administrative data for measuring performance on quality of care indicators has been suggested as one attractive option. Preliminary studies have shown that community pharmacy claims databases contain the information required to operationalize quality of care indicators. The purpose of this project was to determine the feasibility of routine use of information from these databases by regulatory authorities to screen the quality of care provided at community pharmacies.",

    "14": "Soluble oligomers of the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2Os) accumulate in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain and have been implicated in mechanisms of pathogenesis. The neurotoxicity of A\u03b2Os appears to be, at least in part, due to dysregulation of glutamate signaling. Here, we show that A\u03b2Os promote extracellular accumulation of glutamate and d-serine, a co-agonist at glutamate receptors of the N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype (NMDARs), in hippocampal neuronal cultures. The increase in extracellular glutamate levels induced by A\u03b2Os was blocked by the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX), by the NMDAR blocker (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801) and by removal of Ca(2+) from the extracellular medium, indicating dependence on excitatory neuronal activity. A\u03b2Os enhanced both the release of pre-synaptic vesicles labeled by FM1-43 and spontaneous post-synaptic activity measured by whole-cell patch-clamp. Activation of inhibitory GABA(A) receptors by taurine blocked the increase in extracellular glutamate levels, suggesting that selective pharmacological inhibition of neuronal activity can counteract the impact of AbOs on glutamate dyshomeostasis. Results reveal a novel mechanism by which Ab oligomers promote abnormal release of glutamate in hippocampal neurons, which may contribute to dysregulation of excitatory signaling in the brain.",

In the last years, the introduction of new materials for drug delivery matrix tablets has become more important. This paper evaluated the physicochemical and flow properties of new polymeric excipient of ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate and butyl metacrylate, synthesized by suspension polymerization using cellulose nanowhiskers as co-stabilizer, to be used as direct compression for modified release tablets. Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the success of the copolymerization reaction. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that excipient was obtained how spherical beads. Thermal properties of the beads were characterized by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. Particle size analysis of the beads with cellulose nanowhiskers (CNWB) indicated that the presence of the nanowhiskers led to a reduction of particle size and to a narrower size distribution. In vitro test showed that the nanowhiskers and beads produced are nontoxic. Parameters such as Hausner ratio, Carr's index and cotangent of angle \u03b1 were employed to characterize the flow properties of CNWB beads. Furthermore, the beads are used to produce tablets by direct compression contained propranolol hydrochloride as model drug. Dissolution tests performed suggested that beads could be used as excipient in matrix tablets with a potential use in drug controlled release.",

There were two I(Kr) blockers (d-sotalol and dofetilide), two I(Ks) blockers (chromanol 293B and HMR 1556), and a non-selective I(K) blocker (azimilide). d-sotalol, dofetilide, and azimilide lengthened APD(60) and APD(90) in a concentration-dependent manner. Both d-sotalol and dofetilide showed pro-arrhythmia at highest concentrations and in the presence of epinephrine and lower stimulation rate. Despite azimilide markedly lengthened APD(90), it was globally less pro-arrhythmic than dofetilide. Thus, in normoxic rabbit Purkinje fibers, I(Kr) blockade prolonged action potential duration (APD) and increased the incidence of early after-depolarizations, particularly so in the presence of adrenergic stimulation and bradycardia, I(Ks) blockade did neither, and non-selective I(K) blockade (by azimilide) behaved principally as I(Kr) blockade. It is concluded that in normoxic rabbit Purkinje fibers, I(Ks) blockade was neutral, whereas I(Kr) blockade was pro-arrhythmic, which may make a difference worth exploration in more complex models.",

    "34": "Portal hypertension (PH) is a severe complication of liver cirrhosis. Measurement of the degree of portal hypertension is usually performed by measuring the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) which is the difference between the free hepatic venous pressure (FHVP) and the wedged hepatic venous pressure (WHPG). The HVPG accurately reflects the degree of PH in the majority of liver diseases. PH is defined by an increase of HVPG values above the normal upper limit of 5 mm Hg, while clinically significant PH is defined by an HVPG to \u226510 mm Hg. Although measurement of HVPG potentially has several applications, in clinical practice its major use has been related to the assessment of hemodynamic response to pharmacological therapy, in order to evaluate the efficacy of treatment and to predict the risk of rebleeding from esophageal varices. When properly performed, HVPG is a reliable, safe and good predictive tool in the management of portal hypertension. However, the need for appropriate equipment, sufficient and reliable operators and costs, have discouraged its use outside Liver Units specifically devoted to the clinical management of portal hypertension. This has diminished its applicability. Combining its use with transjugular liver biopsy and using the prognostic value of HVPG may help encourage its use.",

HVPG has been convincingly shown to be a strong predictor of variceal bleeding and survival. In addition, it has been shown to predict other portal hypertension-related clinical events, to include fluid retention and hepatic encephalopathy. Finally, HVPG is the only suitable tool to assess the response of portal hypertension to medical treatment.

    "36": "This paper describes about an automated on-line enrichment method for the simultaneous determination of seven \u03b2-blockers in river water using a short liquid chromatography column for preconcentration coupled with LC-DAD. The method performs the preconcentration of 30 mL of river water samples (5% organic modifier) using a 50 mm\u00d74.6 mm C18 column for enrichment and a 150 mm\u00d74.6 mm C18 column for separation, allowing the determination of \u03b2-blockers at trace levels in river water. The analytical procedure was developed by optimizing the breakthrough parameters (flow rate, time of preconcentration and percentage of organic modifier added to the sample) in order to achieve the maximum sensitivity, and by optimizing the mobile phase (composition and flow rate) to get adequate separation of the components in a reasonable analysis time. Under the optimized conditions, the method was validated with respect to linearity, precision, limits of detection, limits of quantification and accuracy. Detection and quantitation limits ranged between 0.1 and 3.1 and between 1.0 and 5.0 ng mL(-1), respectively, whereas the RSD on inter-day precision was below 8%. To cope with the matrix effect in the determination of these drugs in river water samples, the standard addition methodology was successfully applied.

    "37": "The objective of this study was to demonstrate that the asymmetric membrane capsule can be used to deliver a poorly water soluble drug with a pH dependent solubility such as atenolol for extended periods of time by modulating solubility with organic acid. In osmotic systems, the release rate of an excipient relative to the release rate of the drug is an important factor that determines the duration of drug release. Consequently, for maintaining the desired pH over the entire period of drug dissolution a suitable thickening and suspending agent can be incorporated. By optimizing the concentration of thickening agent, it is possible to extend the availability of pH modifier in the core to provide an osmotic driving force or solubilization over the entire delivery period, so that the desired profile can be achieved for an active agent that has lower solubility characteristics. Finally, it was observed that the release rate of atenolol was influenced by the concentration of citric acid, mannitol and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC). Results of scanning electron microscopy studies showed the formation of pores in the membrane from where the drug release occurred. The optimal formulation was found to be able to deliver atenolol at the rate of approximate zero-order up to 24 h, independent of pH of release media and agitation rate.",

The mechanism of skin permeation of PHCL by terpenes was evaluated by FTIR, DSC, activation energy measurement and histopathological examination. Amongst the new terpenes, 1,4-cineole was found to be most effective enhancer for diffusion of PHCL through rat skin (ER=3.07) and human cadaver skin (ER=2.42) as compared to control. FTIR spectra and DSC thermogram of skin treated with aforesaid terpenes indicated that permeation occurred due to the disruption of lipid bilayers. No apparent skin irritation (erythema, edema) was observed on treatment of skin with terpenes, the irritation was higher with the \u03b2-citronellene and rose oxide.

In normotensive patients, the 0.125\u00a0mg/kg/min landiolol infusion was suitable for stabilization of systolic blood pressure and heart rate during tracheal extubation. Controlled hypertensive patients required a 0.25\u00a0mg/kg/min landiolol infusion for stabilization of systolic blood pressure and heart rate during tracheal extubation. In uncontrolled hypertensive patients the 0.25\u00a0mg/kg/min landiolol infusion could stabilize heart rate, but not systolic blood pressure.

    "49": "Ischaemic preconditioning (IPC) protects the heart against prolonged lethal ischaemia through a signalling cascade involving Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), and mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels (mitoK(ATP)). We previously demonstrated the involvement of the Wnt pathway in IPC in vivo via GSK-3\u03b2. A downstream target might be mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) since Wnt can impair tuberous sclerosis complex-2 (TSC2) phosphorylation by inhibiting GSK-3\u03b2. Here, we investigate whether the mTOR pathway is involved in cardioprotection.", 
    "50": "Isolated-perfused mouse hearts were subjected to IPC via four cycles of ischaemia/reperfusion or pharmacological preconditioning (PPC) by diazoxide, a selective mitoK(ATP) activator. IPC, like PPC, induced an inhibition/phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 through Akt activation. Preconditioning also induced phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1 that correlated with a significant reduction in infarct size after 40-min ischaemia and 120-min reperfusion when compared with non-preconditioned controls. Preconditioning was impaired in GSK3 knock-in mice. In transgenic mice hearts overexpressing secreted frizzled protein 1 (sFRP1, a Wnt/Frz antagonist), GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation, mTOR activation, and cardioprotection were impaired. Cardioprotection and its signalling were also inhibited by rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor), 5-HD (a mitoK(ATP) blocker), and N-(2-mercaptopropionyl) glycine (MPG) as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger.", 
    "51": "We propose that the preconditioning signalling pathway involving an amplification loop results in a downregulation of GSK-3\u03b2 and a constant opening of mitoK(ATP) with ROS generation to activate the mTOR pathway and induce cardioprotection. The disruption of the Wnt/Frz pathway by sFRP1 modulates this loop, inducing GSK-3\u03b2 activation. This study provides evidence that cardioprotection involves both a pro-survival mTOR pathway and a developmental Wnt pathway targeting GSK-3\u03b2.",

MI was induced in male Wistar rats by ligation of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery. Irbesartan at 50\u00a0mg/kg/day, carvedilol at 1\u00a0mg/kg/day, irbesartan plus carvedilol, or placebo was administered intragastrically; expression of TF and TFPI mRNA and protein was determined by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The relative left ventricle weights were lower in all three treatment groups than in the placebo group, with the lowest relative weight in the irbesartan plus carvedilol group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The size of the infarcted area was lower in the carvedilol and the combined groups than in the placebo group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The levels of expression of TF and TFPI mRNA and protein were lower in the combined group than in the placebo group or the carvedilol group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Treatment with irbesartan plus carvedilol reduced the expression of TF and TFPI mRNA and protein after MI in rats, and combined treatment with both agents had greater effects than the single agents alone. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of these drugs may include anticoagulation and that combined therapy with both agents is an option that should be evaluated further.", 
    "53": "\u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2ARs) are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that activate intracellular G proteins upon binding catecholamine agonist ligands such as adrenaline and noradrenaline. Synthetic ligands have been developed that either activate or inhibit \u03b2ARs for the treatment of asthma, hypertension or cardiac dysfunction. These ligands are classified as either full agonists, partial agonists or antagonists, depending on whether the cellular response is similar to that of the native ligand, reduced or inhibited, respectively. However, the structural basis for these different ligand efficacies is unknown. Here we present four crystal structures of the thermostabilized turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) \u03b2(1)-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(1)AR-m23) bound to the full agonists carmoterol and isoprenaline and the partial agonists salbutamol and dobutamine. In each case, agonist binding induces a 1\u2009\u00c5 contraction of the catecholamine-binding pocket relative to the antagonist bound receptor. Full agonists can form hydrogen bonds with two conserved serine residues in transmembrane helix 5 (Ser(5.42) and Ser(5.46)), but partial agonists only interact with Ser(5.42) (superscripts refer to Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering). The structures provide an understanding of the pharmacological differences between different ligand classes, illuminating how GPCRs function and providing a solid foundation for the structure-based design of novel ligands with predictable efficacies.", 
    "54": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are eukaryotic integral membrane proteins that modulate biological function by initiating cellular signalling in response to chemically diverse agonists. Despite recent progress in the structural biology of GPCRs, the molecular basis for agonist binding and allosteric modulation of these proteins is poorly understood. Structural knowledge of agonist-bound states is essential for deciphering the mechanism of receptor activation, and for structure-guided design and optimization of ligands. However, the crystallization of agonist-bound GPCRs has been hampered by modest affinities and rapid off-rates of available agonists. Using the inactive structure of the human \u03b2(2) adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(2)AR) as a guide, we designed a \u03b2(2)AR agonist that can be covalently tethered to a specific site on the receptor through a disulphide bond. The covalent \u03b2(2)AR-agonist complex forms efficiently, and is capable of activating a heterotrimeric G protein. We crystallized a covalent agonist-bound \u03b2(2)AR-T4L fusion protein in lipid bilayers through the use of the lipidic mesophase method, and determined its structure at 3.5\u2009\u00c5 resolution. A comparison to the inactive structure and an antibody-stabilized active structure (companion paper) shows how binding events at both the extracellular and intracellular surfaces are required to stabilize an active conformation of the receptor. The structures are in agreement with long-timescale (up to 30\u2009\u03bcs) molecular dynamics simulations showing that an agonist-bound active conformation spontaneously relaxes to an inactive-like conformation in the absence of a G protein or stabilizing antibody.", 
    "55": "G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) exhibit a spectrum of functional behaviours in response to natural and synthetic ligands. Recent crystal structures provide insights into inactive states of several GPCRs. Efforts to obtain an agonist-bound active-state GPCR structure have proven difficult due to the inherent instability of this state in the absence of a G protein. We generated a camelid antibody fragment (nanobody) to the human \u03b2(2) adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(2)AR) that exhibits G protein-like behaviour, and obtained an agonist-bound, active-state crystal structure of the receptor-nanobody complex. Comparison with the inactive \u03b2(2)AR structure reveals subtle changes in the binding pocket; however, these small changes are associated with an 11\u2009\u00c5 outward movement of the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 6, and rearrangements of transmembrane segments 5 and 7 that are remarkably similar to those observed in opsin, an active form of rhodopsin. This structure provides insights into the process of agonist binding and activation.", 
    "56": "We investigated the effects of different antihypertensive drugs on the ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI), pulse pressure (PP), the arterio-ventricular coupling index (AVCI) and aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV). After a 4-week placebo period, 94 and 107 patients with uncomplicated hypertension were randomly assigned to treatment with atenolol (AT) at dosage of 50\u2009mg per day or perindopril/indapamide (PER/IND) at dosage of 2/0.6\u2009mg per day for 1 year. From each patient's 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) recording, we determined the 24-h systolic and diastolic BPs. We computed PP as the difference between 24-h systolic and diastolic BP, AASI as unity minus the regression slope of diastolic on systolic BP, and AVCI as (T/\u03c4)/(1+2T/3\u03c4), where T is the heart period in seconds and \u03c4 is the decay time of aortic BP during diastole. On AT compared with PER/IND, with adjustments applied for covariables, 24-h systolic BP (-9.5 vs. -13.7\u2009mm\u2009Hg; P=0.009) and 24-h PP (-1.02 vs. -6.53\u2009mm\u2009Hg; P<0.001) decreased less and AVCI lengthened more (+0.019 vs. -0.008; P<0.001).

AASI and aPWV showed significant concordance (r=0.21, P=0.003) after adjustment for covariables. On administration of antihypertensive drugs with different hemodynamic profiles, AASI and aPWV behaved similarly. The similarity in the findings for aPWV and AASI support the use of AASI as an index reflecting the arterial stiffness.",

He visited an emergency department and was hospitalized for examination and treatment of myoclonus.", 
    "59": "As the patient's dialysis schedule was adequate, these symptoms were likely not due to uremia. The blood concentration of dextromethorphan (2.68 ng/mL) 60 hours after the 30-mg dose was higher than expected, and the blood concentration of dextrorphan, a metabolite, was lower than expected. We suspected that myoclonus was due to dextromethorphan-related symptoms induced by CYP2D6, which primarily metabolizes dextromethorphan. We analyzed the CYP2D6 gene for polymorphisms and identified CYP2D6 (*)1/(*)10. The patient had been taking metoprolol 40 mg/day for 2 years. The blood concentration of metoprolol 6 hours after administration was 13 ng/mL, which suggests that it was metabolized normally. Metoprolol has another metabolic pathway, via CYP2C19, and this may have led to its lack of accumulation. Moreover, metoprolol may have bound to active CYP2D6. Thus, affinity for CYP2D6, protein-binding rate, and lipid solubility may influence these drug interactions.

    "68": "Nadolol (NAD) is a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker with inverse agonist activity at \u03b2ARs. Previous studies in our laboratory showed that chronic treatment with NAD decreased airway resistance response (R (aw)) to the muscarinic agonist methacholine in a murine model of asthma while acute treatment with NAD increased R (aw) (Callaerts-Vegh et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 101:4948-4953, 2004). Chronic treatment with NAD also caused decreased airway inflammation and mucin content in a murine asthma model (Nguyen et al., Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol 38:256-262, 2008). In this study, we examined the effects of nadolol on \u03b2(2)AR levels and signaling components downstream of the \u03b2(2)AR using a line of HEK293 cells expressing human \u03b2(2)ARs. Chronic treatment with NAD increased \u03b2(2)AR protein levels and decreased receptor degradation, consistent with receptor stabilization by the inverse agonist. Basal cAMP levels decreased after 5\u00a0min of treatment with NAD but increased after a 24-h treatment. A 5-min treatment with NAD decreased forskolin-stimulated phosphorylation at the \u03b2(2)AR PKA site Ser 262 while a 24-h treatment with NAD increased it. In contrast, chronic treatment with NAD had no effect on phosphorylation of the \u03b2(2)AR GRK site at Ser 355, 356. Chronic treatment with NAD upregulated cellular levels of G(\u03b1)s but had no effect on G(\u03b1)i. Chronic NAD treatment therefore increases cellular cAMP levels by mechanisms that include the upregulation of \u03b2(2)AR and G(\u03b1)s. This effect may explain in part the beneficial effects of chronic nadolol treatment on airway contractility.",

The expression of extinction learning can be disrupted by the presentation of reward itself or reward-predictive stimuli (reinstatement) as well as the passage of time (spontaneous recovery) or contextual changes (renewal). The following experiments replicated the demonstration that presenting multiple previously rewarded stimuli in compound during extinction enhances extinction learning. To explore the pharmacological basis for this we next examined the effects of pharmacological treatments that either facilitated or blocked noradrenergic activity to test the hypothesis that increased noradrenergic activity at the time of extinction training would improve, whereas blockade of noradrenergic activity would impair the extinction of appetitive stimulus-reward memories. Different groups of rats were trained in a discriminative stimulus paradigm to lever-press for food reward. Once stable responding was achieved, responding was extinguished for 2 d. Prior to a third extinction session, rats received systemic administration of either saline, yohimbine (\u03b12 antagonist), atomoxetine (norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), or propranolol (\u03b2-receptor antagonist). Spontaneous recovery of responding to the stimuli was tested 4 wk later. Our results indicate that increasing noradrenergic activity during extinction augments extinction learning resulting in less recovery of responding at test. These results have important implications for models of relapse to drug seeking and the development of extinction-based therapies.",

In these conditions, beta-blockers are valuable management options with proven benefits on symptoms and mortality. Historically, however, clinicians have been reluctant to prescribe beta-blockers for patients with co-existing COPD, due to fear of provoking bronchoconstriction. Moreover, such patients have typically been excluded from trials of beta-blockers, raising additional concerns about the basis for treating them with these drugs.

Solvent evaporation in a vacuum evaporator and adsorption from acetone solution were the methods used to load various amounts of carvedilol into the Sylysia pores. The impregnated carriers were characterized using nitrogen-adsorption experiments, X-ray diffraction, wettability measurements, attenuated total reflectance FTIR spectroscopy and thermal analysis. The impregnation procedures resulted in a significant improvement of drug release compared to dissolution of pure carvedilol or its physical mixtures with Sylysia. The results showed that when the drug precipitated in a thin layer within the carrier the dispersion retained a high specific surface area, micropore volume, and drug-release rate from the solid dispersion. Increasing the amount of drug in the solid dispersion caused particle precipitation within the pores that decreased the carrier's specific surface area and pore volume and decreased the release rate of the drug. The results also suggest that the amorphous form of carvedilol, the improved wettability and weak interactions between the drug and carrier in the solid dispersion also contribute to improved dissolution of the drug from the dispersion.", 
    "84": "Dynamic exercise evokes sustained blood pressure and heart rate (HR) increases. Although it is well accepted that there is a CNS mediation of cardiovascular adjustments during dynamic exercise, information on the role of specific CNS structures is still limited. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) is involved in exercise-evoked cardiovascular responses in rats. However, the specific neurotransmitter involved in BST-related modulation of cardiovascular responses to dynamic exercise is still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of local BST adrenoceptors in the cardiovascular responses evoked when rats are submitted to an acute bout of exercise on a rodent treadmill. We observed that bilateral microinjection of the selective \u03b11-adrenoceptor antagonist WB4101 into the BST enhanced the HR increase evoked by dynamic exercise without affecting the mean arterial pressure (MAP) increase. Bilateral microinjection of the selective \u03b12-adrenoceptor antagonist RX821002 reduced exercise-evoked pressor response without changing the tachycardiac response. BST pretreatment with the nonselective \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol did not affect exercise-related cardiovascular responses. BST treatment with either WB4101 or RX821002 did not affect motor performance in the open-field test, which indicates that effects of BST adrenoceptor antagonism in exercise-evoked cardiovascular responses were not due to changes in motor activity. The present findings are the first evidence showing the involvement of CNS adrenoceptors in cardiovascular responses during dynamic exercise. Our results indicate an inhibitory influence of BST \u03b11-adrenoceptor on the exercise-evoked HR response.

In vitro experiments on adult scale melanophores demonstrated that both \u03b11- and \u03b12-adrenoceptors are functional in melanosome aggregation, the \u03b12 subtype being predominant. Most melanophores in zebrafish embryos were able to concentrate melanosomes to \u03b12-adrenergic agonist \u03b1-methylnorepinephrine when they first appeared. This ability increased at least in the following 48 h, showing melanophores at these stages have developed functional adrenoceptors and these receptors increase independently before sympathetic innervation. However, even high concentration (10(-3) M) of \u03b11-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine was not able to evoke any paling of the embryos. In adult scales, propranolol enhanced the melanosome-aggregating response of epinephrine and isoproterenol, but not norepinephrine, indicating \u03b2-adrenoceptor mediates melanosome-dispersing response in adult zebrafish. Similar response was not observed in embryos until 60 h post-fertilization (hpf). The melanophore adrenoceptor blocking effects of phentolamine and propranolol in embryos were much lower than that in adult zebrafish, suggesting these adrenoceptors in developing melanophores are less sensitive to the classical antagonists.",

However, we recently noted repeatable decreases in BP and heart rate (HR) in hypercapnic-acidotic rats in response to GD. The neural pathways, central processing, and autonomic effector mechanisms involved in this cardiovascular reflex response are unknown. We hypothesized that GD-induced decrease in BP and HR reflex responses are mediated during both withdrawal of sympathetic tone and increased parasympathetic activity, involving the rostral (rVLM) and caudal ventrolateral medulla (cVLM) and the nucleus ambiguus (NA). Rats anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine or \u03b1-chloralose were ventilated and monitored for HR and BP changes. The extent of cardiovascular inhibition was related to the extent of hypercapnia and acidosis. Repeated GD with both anesthetics induced consistent falls in BP and HR. The hemodynamic inhibitory response was reduced after blockade of the celiac ganglia or the intraabdominal vagal nerves with lidocaine, suggesting that the decreased BP and HR responses were mediated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic afferents. Blockade of the NA decreased the bradycardia response. Microinjection of kainic acid into the cVLM reduced the inhibitory BP response, whereas depolarization blockade of the rVLM decreased both BP and HR inhibitory responses. Blockade of GABA(A) receptors in the rVLM also reduced the BP and HR reflex responses. Atropine methyl bromide completely blocked the reflex bradycardia, and atenolol blocked the negative chronotropic response. Finally, \u03b1(1)-adrenergic blockade with prazosin reversed the depressor. Thus, in the setting of hypercapnic-acidosis, a sympathoinhibitory cardiovascular response is mediated, in part, by splanchnic nerves and is processed through the rVLM and cVLM. Additionally, a vagal excitatory reflex, which involves the NA, facilitates the GD-induced decreases in BP and HR responses. Efferent chronotropic responses involve both increased parasympathetic and reduced sympathetic activity, whereas the decrease in BP is mediated by reduced \u03b1-adrenergic tone.",

We previously reported in an animal model that \u03b2-blockade with metoprolol exerted beneficial effects on left ventricular remodeling and survival. Despite the recent publication of promising human data, \u03b2-blockade in chronic AR remains controversial. More data are needed to support this potentially new treatment strategy. We hypothesized that carvedilol might be another safe treatment option in chronic AR, considering its combined \u03b2-blocking and \u03b1-blocking effects and proven efficacy in patients with established heart failure.",

    "90": "Widespread occurrence of pharmaceuticals is reported in aquatic systems, posing concerns for the health of aquatic wildlife and a theoretical risk to humans. A recent concept was developed for the identification of highly active compounds amongst the environmental pharmaceuticals, based on their mode of action, the homology between human targets and possible targets in the environment, and the importance of the affected pathway for the target species. In line with this approach, this study investigated whether propranolol (PROP) affects the cAMP-dependent pathway in Mediterranean mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis. PROP is a prototypical \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist, and these receptors exist in bivalves and show gross pharmacological properties similar to their mammalian counterparts. PROP also acts as a 5-HT1 receptor antagonist, which is the sole 5-HT receptor reported in bivalves to date. Importantly, \u03b2-adrenoceptor and 5HT-1 receptor subtypes are positively and negatively coupled to cAMP-mediated signaling, respectively. PROP was administered as either l-PROP or dl-PROP. A wide range of concentrations was tested including low (0.3, 3 and 30ng/L) and high (300ng/L) environmental ranges, and a concentration 5-fold above the maximum reported environmental level (30,000ng/L). After a 7-day exposure, mussel cAMP levels and PKA activities were significantly reduced in digestive gland, increased in mantle/gonads and unaffected in gills. Similar patterns were observed for the mRNA expression of the ABCB1 gene encoding the membrane transporter P-glycoprotein, hypothesised to be under PKA modulation. The effects on the digestive gland are consistent with PROP blocking \u03b2-adrenoceptors. The observed increased cAMP levels in the mantle/gonad tissue support PROP blocking 5-HT1 receptors. Catalase and glutathione-S tranferase were differently affected by PROP in the two tissues. Mussel haemocyte lysosome membrane stability, a sensitive biomarker of animal health status, was concentration-dependently reduced following PROP exposure. Our observations provide evidence for PROP affecting cell signaling in M. galloprovincialis. Moreover, the chemical interacts with specific and evolutionally conserved biochemical pathways for which it was designed. The mode of action of PROP in mussels is related with its therapeutic properties in humans, based upon these conserved human targets. It also induced a stress response, and all these effects were displayed at the lowest concentrations tested.",

Complex river water samples spiked with 11 pharmaceutical substances resulted in poorly resolved chromatograms containing additional peaks from interfering matrix compounds and a change in the background absorbance due to the mobile phase gradient. Applying the present multivariate approach it was possible to resolve all 11 analytes from overlapping peaks, obtaining linear calibration lines (R(2)>0.96).

    "100": "Hypertension frequently coexists with diabetes and the cardiometabolic syndrome. \u03b2-Blockers have been a mainstay for controlling blood pressure for nearly 4 decades. However, \u03b2-blockers are perceived to cause glucose and lipid metabolism dysregulation, including hypoglycemia masking, reduced glycemic control, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. It should be noted, however, that \u03b2-blockers are diverse in their effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. Potential mechanisms that contribute to these metabolic effects include hemodynamic differences, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative pathways, and/or weight changes. Traditional \u03b2-blockers decrease cardiac output while peripheral vascular resistance increases or remains unchanged, which may result in glucose and lipid abnormalities. In contrast, vasodilating \u03b2-blockers reduce peripheral vascular resistance but have little effect on cardiac output. Vasodilating \u03b2-blockers may therefore result in less impact on insulin sensitivity and glycemic control, a reduced new-onset diabetes risk, and improved dyslipidemia compared with traditional \u03b2-blockers. Because of these effects, vasodilating \u03b2-blockers may represent a favorable option in the treatment of high-risk patients with hypertension.",

    "106": "Transient outward rectifying conductances or A-like conductances in sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPN) are prolonged, lasting for hundreds of milliseconds to seconds and are thought to play a key role in the regulation of SPN firing frequency. Here, a multidisciplinary electrophysiological, pharmacological and molecular single-cell rt-PCR approach was used to investigate the kinetics, pharmacological profile and putative K+ channel subunits underlying the transient outward rectifying conductance expressed in SPN. SPN expressed a 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) sensitive transient outward rectification with significantly longer decay kinetics than reported for many other central neurons. The conductance and corresponding current in voltage-clamp conditions was also sensitive to the Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 blocker phrixotoxin-2 (1-10 \u03bcM) and the blocker of rapidly inactivating Kv channels, pandinotoxin-K\u03b1 (50 nM). The conductance and corresponding current was only weakly sensitive to the Kv1 channel blocker tityustoxin-K\u03b1 and insensitive to dendrotoxin I (200 nM) and the Kv3.4 channel blocker BDS-II (1 \u03bcM). Single-cell RT-PCR revealed mRNA expression for the \u03b1-subunits Kv4.1 and Kv4.3 in the majority and Kv1.5 in less than half of SPN. mRNA for accessory \u03b2-subunits was detected for Kv\u03b22 in all SPN with differential expression of mRNA for KChIP1, Kv\u03b21 and Kv\u03b23 and the peptidase homologue DPP6. These data together suggest that the transient outwardly rectifying conductance in SPN is mediated by members of the Kv4 subfamily (Kv4.1 and Kv4.3) in association with the \u03b2-subunit Kv\u03b22. Differential expression of the accessory \u03b2 subunits, which may act to modulate channel density and kinetics in SPN, may underlie the prolonged and variable time-course of this conductance in these neurons.", 
    "107": "This study aimed to comparatively investigate the acute modulating effects of oestrogen and progesterone on the repolarization and the susceptibility of female rabbits to class III anti-arrhythmic agents. The acute influence of estradiol and progesterone on the cardiac repolarization and the drug sensitivity of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K(+) channel to sotalol was comparatively studied in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts at pharmacological concentrations through recording of epicardial monophasic action potentials. In Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, estradiol (1-30 \u03bcm) concentration-dependently prolonged the monophasic action potential durations (MAPD(30) and MAPD(90) ) (P < 0.05); while the effects of progesterone on MAPD were biphasic: it prolonged MAPD(30) and MAPD(90) at lower concentrations (1-3 \u03bcm) but shortened MAPD(30) and MAPD(90) at higher concentrations (10-30 \u03bcm). Sotalol-induced prolongation of MAPD(90) was significantly less in the hearts pretreated with progesterone than those treated with estradiol (P < 0.05). The incidence of the pro-arrhythmic events induced by sotalol in the hearts pretreated with progesterone was also significantly lower than those pretreated with estradiol (P < 0.05). In conclusion, estradiol and progesterone have different modulating effects on cardiac repolarization: estradiol can concentration-dependently prolong the cardiac repolarization time and thus may reduce the repolarization reserve and increase the susceptibility of female rabbits to sotalol-induced arrhythmias, whereas progesterone may shorten the cardiac repolarization time at concentrations above 10\u2003\u03bcm, thus protecting the heart from drug-induced arrhythmias.", 
    "108": "In the present work, we sought to mimic the internal state changes in response to a predator threat by pharmacologically stimulating the brain circuit involved in mediating predator fear responses, and explored whether this stimulation would be a valuable unconditioned stimulus (US) in an olfactory fear conditioning paradigm (OFC). The dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd) is a key brain structure in the neural processing of anti-predatory defensive behavior and has also been shown to mediate the acquisition and expression of anti-predatory contextual conditioning fear responses. Rats were conditioned by pairing the US, which was an intra-PMd microinjection of isoproterenol (ISO; \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonist), with amyl acetate odor-the conditioned stimulus (CS). ISO (10 and 40\u2009nmol) induced the acquisition of the OFC and the second-order association by activation of \u03b2-1 receptors in the PMd. Furthermore, similar to what had been found for contextual conditioning to a predator threat, atenolol (\u03b2-1 receptor antagonist) in the PMd also impaired the acquisition and expression of OFC promoted by ISO. Considering the strong glutamatergic projections from the PMd to the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG), we tested how the glutamatergic blockade of the dPAG would interfere with the OFC induced by ISO. Accordingly, microinjections of NMDA receptor antagonist (AP5, 6\u2009nmol) into the dPAG were able to block both the acquisition, and partially, the expression of the OFC. In conclusion, we have found that PMd \u03b2-1 adrenergic stimulation is a good model to mimic predatory threat-induced internal state changes, and works as a US able to mobilize the same systems involved in the acquisition and expression of predator-related contextual conditioning.",

More importantly, recent meta-analyses have highlighted that in primary prevention BBs are associated with a relatively weak effect in reducing stroke compared to placebo or no treatment and, compared with other drugs, show evidence of a worse cardiovascular outcome. Several reasons might explain their mild cardioprotective effect, such as their unfavorable metabolic properties, a lack of efficacy on left ventricular hypertrophy regression and endothelial dysfunction, and reduced patient compliance. Thus, the available evidence does not support the use of BBs as first-line drugs in the treatment of uncomplicated hypertension. It remains to be determined whether newer BBs, such as nebivolol and carvedilol, will be more effective than older compounds in improving cardiovascular prognosis.",

    "134": "Nicotinic acetylcholine-receptor systems are critical neural components of cognitive functions. Nicotine and nicotinic agonists have been shown to improve cognition in rats in numerous studies [13\u201315, 27, 31, 59]. Similarly, nicotinic-receptor antagonists \u2014 the subject of this chapter \u2014 can cause cognitive impairments in rats. The use of nicotinic-receptor antagonists in an animal model of cognitive impairment has clinical relevance because it models the functional effect of nicotinic-receptor loss. Studies have shown that patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease suffer a dramatic reduction in hippocampal and cortical nicotine-receptor density that parallels the cognitive decline associated with this disease [56\u201358]. Significant nicotinic-receptor loss also occurs in Parkinson\u2019s disease [9], and postmortem studies in schizophrenics show a decrease in the number of \u03b17 nicotinic receptors in the brain [8, 19]. Both of these diseases can also include cognitive decline. Thus animal studies wherein nicotinic receptors are blocked with antagonists can be useful in developing animal models of how these diseases \u2014 Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and schizophrenia \u2014 affect cognition. The predominant nicotinic-receptor antagonist used in cognitive studies with rats is mecamylamine, a noncompetitive antagonist that is not selective for particular nicotinic-receptor-subtype recognition sites. Mecamylamine has been shown to impair cognitive function on a variety of tasks, and this chapter reviews the effects of mecamylamine on task performance. In addition, a small number of studies have examined other nonspecific nicotinic antagonists, including chlorisondamine and d-tubocurarine, and the receptor-subunit-specific \u03b14\u03b22 (dihydro-\u03b2-erythroidine hydrobromide [DH\u03b2E]) and \u03b17 (methyllycaconitine [MLA]) antagonists, and these will also be discussed. In addition, many studies use the peripheral nicotinic blocker hexamethonium to show the specificity of mecamylamine effects to the central nervous system (CNS).", 
    "135": "Although a relation between diminished human immunity and stress is well recognized both within the general public and the scientific literature, the molecular mechanisms by which stress alters immunity remain poorly understood. We explored a novel model for acute human stress involving volunteers performing a first-time bungee jump from an altitude of 60 m and exploited this model to characterize the effects of acute stress in the peripheral blood compartment. Twenty volunteers were included in the study; half of this group was pretreated for 3 d with the \u03b2-receptor blocking agent propranolol. Blood was drawn 2 h before, right before, immediately after and 2 h after the jump. Plasma catecholamine and cortisol levels increased significantly during jumping, which was accompanied by significantly reduced ex vivo inducibility of proinflammatory cytokines as well as activation of coagulation and vascular endothelium. Kinome profiles obtained from the peripheral blood leukocyte fraction contained a strong noncanonical glucocorticoid receptor signal transduction signature after jumping. In apparent agreement, jumping down-regulated Lck/Fyn and cellular innate immune effector function (phagocytosis). Pretreatment of volunteers with propranolol abolished the effects of jumping on coagulation and endothelial activation but left the inhibitory effects on innate immune function intact. Taken together, these results indicate that bungee jumping leads to a catecholamine-independent immune suppressive phenotype and implicate noncanonical glucocorticoid receptor signal transduction as a major pathway linking human stress to impaired functioning of the human innate immune system.",

    "147": "In this paper we summarize present trends and controversies in the use of beta-blockers in cardiovascular diseases. Beta-blockers are catecolamine competitive inhibitors and act through alpha and beta adrenergic receptors blockade. Different agents have a dose-dependent affinity for different beta adrenergic receptors (beta 1, beta 2, beta 3) which is less with higher doses. The most important therapeutic effects of beta-blockers are on cardiovascular system, where they act as negative chronotropic and inotropic agents, lowering cardiac work and improving oxygen demand /supply ratio. Clinical indications are numerous. For their anti-ischemic activity beta-blockers are used as anti-anginal drugs and in acute and previous myocardial infarction for preventing total and cardiovascular mortality. Combined use of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors slows down heart failure progression and reduces cardiovascular mortality. Beta-blockers are useful in treating focal atrial tachycardia and supra ventricular paroxysmal tachycardia, by reducing sinus node automaticity and delay atrio-ventricular conduction; they also prevent sudden cardiac death and ventricular tachycardia associated with increased sympathetic activity. There is no indication in treating primary non-complicated hypertension with beta-blockers as first-line drugs. Different metabolic effects of selective and non-selective beta-blockers are actually debated. In conclusion, beta-blockers have indication in the treatment of many cardiovascular diseases. Further studies are needed for better understanding the differences in cardiac and peripheral beta-blockers effects depending on their selectivity.", 
    "148": "Migraine is defined as a disorder characterized by intermittent headache episodes, accompanied with nausea, photophobia and/or phonophobia. Pharmacological therapy is in accordance with the severity of pain and may include acute, prophylactic and most commonly both approaches. The aim of the acute therapy is stopping or alleviating the attack or progression of the pain and, in case of a migraine attack that has started, lessening the pain. Preventive therapy aims to reduce attack frequency and severity. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of dietary factors in the management and prophylaxis of migraine in cases diagnosed as having migraine disorder according to the 2003-IHS criteria. Fifty consecutive Turkish patients (13 men, 37 women) with diagnosis of migraine were randomly divided into two groups for treatment protocols with the written approval of the ethics committee. The cases in the first group (K) were treated with metoprolol, vitamin B(2) (riboflavin), and naproxen sodium just at the aura or at the beginning of the attacks. The cases in the second group (D) were also supplied with a comprehensive dietary list arranged by our algology clinic in addition to the same medication protocol. There were no demographic differences between the cases (P > 0.05). VAS scores were lower in group D than group K (P < 0.01), and also the migraine attack frequencies and monthly amounts of analgesic consumed amounts were also statistically significantly less. It was concluded that beta-blocker and riboflavin therapy supplemented with a convenient diet with appropriate alternatives in patients with migraine disorder was associated with statistically significant decreases in headache frequency, intensity, duration and medication intake.",

A prospective, controlled animal model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was employed to assess the effects of propranolol on long-term behavioral responses to stress. Animals exposed to predator scent stress received a single bolus of propranolol (10 or 15mg/kg) or vehicle 1h post-exposure. Outcomes were assessed using the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and acoustic startle response (ASR) at 30days and freezing response to a trauma reminder (unsoiled litter) on Day 31. Individual animals were classified as having \"extreme\", \"partial\" and \"minimal\" behavioral responses, according to pre-set cut-off criteria for EPM and ASR response patterns. The physiological efficacy of the doses of propranolol was verified by collecting cardiovascular data telemetrically (from exposed or unexposed individuals given propranolol or vehicle). The effect of propranolol on long-term memory was verified using a non-spatial memory task. Both doses of propranolol effectively reduced mean heart rate and impaired the object-recognition task, as expected. No significant effect on prevalence rates of PTSD-like behavioral responses or on trauma reminder response was observed for either dose of propranolol as compared to vehicle. Despite adequate efficacy in terms of heart rate and disruption of memory, single-dose, post-stress \u03b2-blockage with propranolol was ineffective in reducing onset of PTSD-like behavioral disruption and trauma cue responses in the long term.

In this process, several aldehydes, including 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), are generated and the amount of HNE is increased in the human failing myocardium. HNE exacerbates the formation of ROS, especially H\u2082O\u2082 and \u00b7OH, in cardiomyocytes and subsequently ROS cause intracellular Ca(2+) overload. Treatment with beta-blockers such as metoprolol, carvedilol and bisoprolol reduces the levels of oxidative stress, together with amelioration of heart failure. This reduction could be caused by several possible mechanisms. First, the beta-blocking effect is important, because catecholamines such as isoproterenol and norepinephrine induce oxidative stress in the myocardium. Second, anti-ischemic effects and negative chronotropic effects are also important. Furthermore, direct antioxidative effects of carvedilol contribute to the reduction of oxidative stress. Carvedilol inhibited HNE-induced intracellular Ca(2+) overload. Beta-blocker therapy is a useful antioxidative therapy in patients with heart failure.", 
    "179": "The present study was undertaken to evaluate the antihypertensive and vasorelaxant effects of Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume stem bark aqueous extract in rats. The in vivo activities of the extract were evaluated on normotensive and three rat models of hypertension while the in vitro tests were assayed on rat isolated aorta rings. Acute intravenous injection of the extract (5, 10 and 20mg/kg) induced a significant reduction in mean arterial blood pressure in anaesthetised normotensive Wistar rats, salt-loaded hypertensive, L-NAME hypertensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats. Pre-treatment of rats with either propranolol or atropine significantly inhibited the hypotensive effects of the plant extract suggesting its possible action through the interferences with both cholinergic and sympathetic transmissions. Moreover, pre-treatment of rats with L-NAME inhibited the sustained plant antihypertensive effects, suggesting a possible active vasodilatation, which might be partly mediated by an endothelial l-arginine/nitric oxide pathway. In isolated rat aortic rings pre-contracted with KCl (60mM), the extract exhibited cumulative vasodilating effects, which were attenuated with either L-NAME, vascular endothelium removal or both tetraethylammonium and glibenclamide pre-treatments. The vasorelaxant effects may be involved in the extract antihypertensive mechanism, partially by increasing the endothelial nitric oxide and by activating the KATP channels in vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "180": "A 32-year-old female para 4 gravi 3, who was 21 weeks pregnant, presented to the emergency department (ED) with a 2-day history of abdominal pain, headache, blurred vision and vomiting. On arrival, she was agitated and confused with a blood pressure 162/106 mm Hg, pulse rate 107, respiratory rate 18, temperature 37 degrees Celsius, point of care blood glucose 6.2 and her Glasgow coma scale was 13/15 M6V4E3. Paramedics witnessed seizure-like activity lasting <1 min during transport. A diagnosis of eclampsia complicated by the HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets count) was made. She was commenced on magnesium and labetalol intravenously for blood pressure control. Initial blood test results were consistent with the HELLP syndrome. Recognition of the HELLP syndrome with prompt management of blood pressure and clotting abnormalities is essential in the ED setting. An aggressive multidisciplinary approach is a key to optimise the prognosis for mother and fetus.", 
    "181": "Anomalous origin of right coronary artery (RCA) has been associated with angina, myocardial infarction and sudden death. Often these patients are referred for surgery. However, long-term \u03b2-blocker therapy instead of surgery has been used in some cases with success. The authors report a case of anomalous RCA where resolution of ischemia with \u03b2-blocker was objectively demonstrated on serial stress testing.", 
    "182": "The purpose of glaucoma treatment is to prevent progressive loss of optic nerve fibers and thereby to preserve the visual field. Because increased IOP is a primary risk factor in developing glaucoma, descrease its value below which may affect the optic is the antiglaucoma treatment target. This paper provides an overview of glaucoma treatment and the use of fixed combinations of topical prostaglandin analogues (PGA).", 
    "183": "Modern fixed-combination products simplify medication dose regimen without sacrificing their effectiveness.Potential benefits of the therapy with fixed-combination products are enhanced tolerability increased convenience,better compliance,cost and time economy and removal of the wash out effect. Regarding intraocular pressure lowering effect, fixed-combination agents are superior to monotherapy with the two medication components, with the exception of Duotrav that is not superior to travoprost action.Fixed-combination products are noninferior to concomitant administration of the two components of medication (nonfixed-combination agents) relative to their ocular hypotensive efficacy with the exception of Ganfort that is however inferior to concurrent administration of both the bimatoprost and timolol.", 
    "184": "Azarga is a new fixed combination product that consists of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor brinzolamide 1% and the betablocker timolol 0,5%. Its efficacy in lowering intraocular pressure is similar to that of Cosopt, a fixed combination that combines another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (eg dorzolamide 2%) with the betablocker timolol 0,5%. The main difference between these two ocular hypotensive agents lies in their safety profiles with Cosopt causing more ocular discomfort to appear while instilling (burning,stinging and smarting sensations) probably due to the differences between the pH of these two fixed combinations agents. Its similar efficacy and enhanced tolerability compared with Cosopt make Azarga represent a resonable alternative for the patients who do not achieve an adequate intraocular pressure control while treating with a monotherapeutic agent.", 
    "185": "To determine optimal treatment of arterial hypertension (AH) in patients with hepatic cirrhosis (HC) basing on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-adrenoblockers (BAB).", 
    "186": "A total of 360 patients with AH of the second degree, steatosis and alcoholic HC of class A according to Child-Pue participated in the study. The control group consisted of 120 patients with peptic ulcer in remission and normal function of the liver. The patients' treatment with enalapril (pharmacologically inactive prodrug), lisinopril (biologically active substance), atenolol (hydrophilic drug) and metoprolol (lipophylic drug) was analysed.", 
    "187": "Lisinopril showed a better hypotensive effect than enalapril in AH patients with HC. BAB decreased blood pressure in all hypertensive patients. Atenolol and metoprolol effectively reduced blood pressure in 88.89% patients with AH and HC. Bradycardia episodes in atenolol treatment were observed in 14.4% patients while in metoprolol treatment--in 22.2% patients, this evidencing for pronounced shifts in pharmacokinetic parameters of metoprolol exposed to hepatic metabolism.", 
    "188": "Biological activity is an essential criterion of choice of ACE inhibitor in patients with hepatic pathology. Enalapril, for example, as a pharmacological inactive prodrug, is metabolized in the liver to acquire activity, whereas lisinopril has a direct biological activity and has, therefore, a stronger hypotensive action in AH patients with HC. BAB should be selected by the ability to effectively control blood pressure and heart rate without inducing bradycardia the appearance of which necessitates correction of dose regimen with reduction of day dose.", 
    "189": "Poisoning is a leading cause cause for injury and death in pediatric patients. For this reason, \u03b2-blocker ingestion has been an indication for emergency department (ED) referral and evaluation in pediatric patients even though significant clinical effects are uncommonly reported. We sought to determine whether an evidence-based triage guideline developed jointly by the American Association of Poison Control Centers, American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, and American College of Medical Toxicology safely reduces unnecessary pediatric ED visits after unintentional small dose \u03b2-blocker overdose. This was a prospective study of patients aged 0-6 years with a \u03b2-blocker ingestion managed by a regional poison center pre and postimplementation of the triage guideline. One hundred fifty-three cases met inclusion criteria. Before implementation of an evidence-based triage guideline for out-of-hospital management, 52 (67%) cases were referred for ED evaluation, and 26 (33%) cases were recommended for home observation. After guideline implementation, 38 (51%) cases were referred for ED evaluation, and 37 (49%) were recommended for home observation. No deaths occurred in either group. The triage guideline was accurately followed by poison center staff in 96% of cases after implementation. An out-of-hospital triage guideline for pediatric \u03b2-blocker overdose was accurately followed by poison center staff and safely reduced unnecessary ED referrals with a 50% increase in home observation.", 
    "190": "The hypothesis that \u03b2-blockers cause depression has been both confirmed and refuted in previous studies. However, in hardly any of these studies, depression was systematically and adequately assessed. The aim of this cohort study was to examine whether \u03b2-blockers, in general, highly lipid-soluble, nonselective, or serotonergic receptor-binding \u03b2-blockers, are associated with incident depression. Between 1993 and 2005, 5104 elderly persons were followed for incident depressions. Depressions were identified by regular interview and continuous monitoring of medical records. Cases were categorized as clinically relevant depressive symptoms or as depressive syndromes, the latter including Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-defined depressive disorders. Pharmacies provided information on filled \u03b2-blockers. We used Cox regression with drug use as a time-dependent variable to analyze the data, adjusted for potential demographic covariates, activity of daily living, and (contra)indications for \u03b2-blockers. We found that use of \u03b2-blockers in general did not convey an increased risk of depressive symptoms (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-1.59) or depressive syndromes (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.53-1.84). Highly lipid-soluble \u03b2-blockers, mostly propranolol in our study, were associated with depressive symptoms during the first 3 months of use (HR, 3.31; 95% CI, 1.03-10.6), but not with depressive syndromes. Nonselective or serotonergic receptor affinity was not associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms or syndromes independent of high lipid solubility. We conclude that \u03b2-blockers in general do not convey an increased risk of depression. Lipophilic \u03b2-blockers are associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms.",

    "192": "Timoptol, Timoptol XE, Rysmon TG, and Timabak solutions were used. These commercially available drugs were diluted to 1/30, 1/100, and 1/300, and their effects on cell morphology, cell count, and cell activity were investigated. The effects of drugs containing benzalkonium chloride (BAK) as well as those of the Rysmon TG vehicle alone were also assessed.", 
    "193": "At 1/30 dilution, cells treated with Timoptol and Timoptol XE showed cell deformation. Timoptol and Timoptol XE also caused a significant decrease in the number of cells at 1/100 and 1/30 dilutions. Cell activity decreased in a concentration-dependent manner after the addition of either Timoptol or Timoptol XE. Rysmon TG and Timabak showed significantly higher cell activity than Timoptol or Timoptol XE at both 1/100 and 1/30 dilutions. The cell count increased in a concentration-dependent manner in the BAK-free group, while cell activity decreased in a concentration-dependent manner in the cultures in the BAK-containing group.",

    "196": "Using a simulation model, initiating therapy with timolol (strategy 1) and with latanoprost (strategy 2) was simulated for a hypothetic cohort of ocular hypertension patients with an initial IOP distribution (data of 1000 patients). Adjustment of therapy within 15 months and a subsequent lifelong follow-up, with an IOP dependent conversion to glaucoma, were modeled. The IOP lowering effect of medication (based on a meta-analysis) was applied by Monte Carlo simulation. Therapy could be maintained or changed, depending on the achieved IOP and side effects. Four drugs (latanoprost, timolol, brimonidine, dorzolamide) were used as monotherapy or in combination. Glaucoma conversion rate was based on literature.", 
    "197": "Treatment goal was achieved in both strategies in 90% by monotherapy. This was 60% for patients with initial IOP's of 30 mm Hg. The originally prescribed medication was maintained in 66% (1) and in 77% (2). IOP decreased with approximately 34%, from 25.4 mm Hg (mean) to 16.7 mm Hg (1) and to 16.5 mm Hg (2) Blindness per person within 18.7 years of life expectancy was 0.0923 years (1) and 0.0870 years (2), which corresponds to approximately 1 month. The difference between strategies was 2 days spent in blindness per patient.", 
    "198": "The difference in clinical effects of the strategies is small. This is largely owing to the key concept of a target pressure, which underlies both strategies."
