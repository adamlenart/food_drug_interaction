Below thermoneutrality (23.5 degrees C) the metabolic rate of obese mice was lower than that of their lean littermates, whereas at a thermoneutral temperature (31 degrees C) the metabolic rate of the obese mice was as high as that of lean mice. This confirms the view that the ob/ob mouse has defective thermoregulatory thermogenesis. However, in C57BL/6 mice, this defect is not due to a failure to respond to noradrenaline, because at 31 degrees C the maximum thermic effects of noradrenaline, ephedrine and BRL 26830A were as high in obese as in lean mice and at 23.5 degrees C they were higher in obese than in lean mice. Furthermore, the response of brown adipose tissue to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation appears normal since noradrenaline caused a normal rise in brown adipose tissue temperature, and treatment with noradrenaline or BRL 26830A in vivo caused a normal increase in GDP binding by brown adipose tissue mitochondria. At 31 degrees C propranolol depressed metabolic rate equally in lean and obese C57BL/6 mice, whereas at 23.5 degrees C it depressed metabolic rate more in lean than obese mice. In contrast to C57BL/6 mice, Aston ob/ob mice showed a reduced thermic response to noradrenaline. These results suggest that defective thermoregulatory thermogenesis in the ob/ob mouse is primarily due to a reduced ability to raise sympathetic tone, but in some strains an additional failure in the thermic response to noradrenaline may develop.", 
    "1": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) stimulates glycogenolysis and induces vasoconstriction in perfused rat liver. The effect of PAF was rapid but transient and it was blocked by indomethacin and bromophenacyl bromide which suggests a role of cyclooxygenase metabolites in its action. The homologous desensitization of glycogenolysis produced by PAF and the sensitivity of its actions to inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and phospholipase A2 markedly differentiate the mechanism of action of this agent with that of alpha 1-adrenergic agents, vasopressin or angiotensin II. No effect of PAF in isolated hepatocytes was observed which suggest that cells other than hepatocytes could be involved in its action in perfused liver. In addition nordihydroguaiaretic acid and bromophenacyl bromide abolished the vascular effect (but not the glycogenolysis) produced by epinephrine which suggest a role for lipoxygenase products in this effect.", 
    "2": "The electrophysiological effects of K-351 (0.3-300 microM), a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, on canine Purkinje and ventricular muscle fibers were examined and compared with those of propranolol (0.3-30 microM) and sotalol (3-300 microM) using standard microelectrode techniques. K-351 and propranolol dose dependently reduced the maximum upstroke velocity of phase 0 and action potential amplitude in both cardiac tissues. Action potential durations (APD) of Purkinje fibers were shortened by both propranolol and K-351 but prolonged by sotalol. However, in ventricular muscle fibers K-351 and sotalol significantly prolonged APD and effective refractory periods which contrasted with the unchanged APD after propranolol. These results suggest that K-351 is a beta-blocking drug possessing a membrane stabilizing action (class I antiarrhythmic properties) and in ventricular muscles it can also exert an APD-prolonging effect (class III antiarrhythmic properties).", 
    "3": "The lowering of blood pressure with beta-blocking drugs has had a low impact on coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality and the question has been raised whether adverse changes in plasma lipoproteins offset the benefits of blood pressure reduction. Comparison of plasma lipoprotein concentrations in hypertensive patients treated with commonly used beta-blockers with lipoprotein concentrations in patients with coronary heart disease shows that these drugs cause clinically important shifts in the cholesterol ratio [total cholesterol (TC): high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC)] and reductions in the atheroprotective lipoprotein HDLC. The magnitude of these changes is sufficient to increase the risk of heart attack two- to four-fold depending on the initial cholesterol ratio and the duration of treatment. Only beta-blockers with marked intrinsic sympathomimetic agonist activity (pindolol) or combined alpha-beta-blocking properties (Labetalol) appear free of adverse effects on plasma lipoproteins and triglycerides. Chronic treatment with other beta-blockers should be accompanied by cholesterol and HDLC measurements at the beginning of therapy. Plasma lipoprotein measurements at 3-6 month intervals seem mandatory in patients with cholesterol values greater than 6 mmol/1 (230 mg/dl) and (TC):HDLC ratios above 5 at the start of treatment. The risk of a coronary event must be regarded as unacceptable when the cholesterol ratio exceeds a critical value of about 6. Further controlled studies are needed to evaluate the effects of beta-blockers in hypertension when administered for periods of up to a year or more. More information is required on the behaviour of lipoprotein subspecies and apoproteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "Electrical stimulation of the rat A1 noradrenergic region produced orthodromic inhibition (34%), excitation (23%) or excitation-inhibition sequence (25%) of the spontaneous activity of phasically firing units in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). Excitatory responses could be distinguished into two types on the basis of their latency and duration. Both the primary and post-excitatory inhibitory responses were significantly attenuated by intravenous injection of propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, whereas neither type of excitatory response was affected.", 
    "5": "Searching for a possibility of an effective therapy of disturbances of peripheral arterial blood supply (stage I and II), the authors examined a medicamentously untreated group of patients as well as a comparable group of patients which was pretreated with propranolol. The two groups of patients performed twice a week an interval run exercise. Under the three-month training therapy in the two groups significant systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions as well as statistically ascertained shortenings of the xenon-133-half-value time under working conditions and enlargements of the average functional vascular cross section A appeared. The distance of the intermittent claudication and the standardized moving up and down test prolonged. An influence on the microcirculation caused by propranolol could not be proved. The results are discussed on the basis of literature.", 
    "6": "The internalization of beta-adrenergic receptors was investigated in rat livers perfused with an agonist ([3H]isoprenaline) or an antagonist ([125I]iodocyanopindolol). Analytical centrifugation of liver homogenates indicated that the ligands were transferred rapidly to endosomal and lysosomal positions in sucrose gradients. Endosome fractions contained beta-adrenergic binding sites, but adenylate cyclase activity was low and poorly activated by isoprenaline. The results indicate that the receptor-regulatory-protein-adenylate cyclase complex was disassembled during uptake of beta-adrenergic ligands, with the adenylate cyclase being retained at the plasma membrane.", 
    "7": "The inhibitory effect of two kinds of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs [propranolol: 1-100 mg/kg per day; carteolol: 0.3-30 mg/kg per day] on the development of cardiac hypertrophy was studied in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR: 4 weeks old). Though neither propranolol or carteolol given for 6 weeks reduced the development of hypertension in SHR, both drugs did reduce the increase in the heart weight/body weight ratio in a dose-dependent manner. This potency of carteolol was about 300 times greater than that of propranolol. The potency of carteolol with regard to the reduction in the myocardial protein/DNA ratio was about 300 times greater than that of propranolol. The beta-blocking potency, estimated from the area under the dose-response curve (beta-blocking action) of carteolol, was also 300 times greater than that of propranolol and correlated well with the extent of the structural changes in the heart. Thus, the possibility that the degree of beta-blocking potency may strongly relate to structural changes in the heart of young SHR has to be given consideration.", 
    "8": "Baroreceptor responsiveness was investigated in conscious dogs following increasing doses (i.v.) of the selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonists methoxamine (alpha 1) and oxymetazoline (alpha 2), in the presence and absence of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The study was repeated in another group of dogs with background afferent baroreceptor nerve activity reduced by continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside. Both agonists dose dependently increased mean arterial pressure and reflexly decreased heart rate. In dogs pretreated with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist a correlation between increase in mean arterial pressure (increase up to 70 mmHg) and increase in heart period (baroreceptor responsiveness) indicated no difference in the regression lines between methoxamine and oxymetazoline for both the normotensive and the sodium nitroprusside groups. However, in the dogs not pretreated with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist the slope of the regression line for oxymetazoline was steeper than that for methoxamine (P less than 0.01) in the normotensive group. In the sodium nitroprusside group the regression line for oxymetazoline was situated significantly to the left of the methoxamine line (P less than 0.05). It is suggested that this greater bradycardic response to the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist oxymetazoline was caused by suppression of the cardiac sympathetic component (presynaptic modulation of noradrenaline release) in addition to the vagal activation and the sympathetic withdrawal component of the reflex. This indicates that drugs with alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonistic activity can influence a reflex physiological situation under conditions of low sympathetic nerve activity.", 
    "9": "A possible interaction of the antihypertensive drug, urapidil with beta-adrenoceptors was investigated in a guinea-pig ventricular membrane preparation. Urapidil at concentrations above 1 microM antagonized the isoproterenol-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity. Urapidil 10 microM shifted the concentration-response curve for isoproterenol in a parallel manner to the right by a factor of 16. Urapidil competed with specific beta-adrenoceptor binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol with an IC50 of 12 microM. Since the affinity of urapidil to beta-adrenoceptors appeared rather low, any beta-adrenoceptor blocking property may be of relevance in vivo at high dosages only.", 
    "10": "After somatic cell fusion between splenocytes of immunized BALB/c mice and NS-1 myeloma cells, eight clones were obtained secreting anti-alprenolol antibodies as characterized by means of an ELISA. Four of these were subcloned and were studied further. The association constant for alprenolol ranged from 1.9 X 10(6) M-1 to 24 to 10(6) M-1. Competitive inhibition of [3H]-l-dihydroalprenolol binding revealed cross-reactivity with beta-adrenergic ligands, with a higher avidity for antagonists than for agonists. Two of the antibodies had a higher affinity for the l-isomer than for the d-isomer. The most stereospecific of these antibodies showed only affinity for beta-adrenergic antagonists and for the agonist isoproterenol. The other recognized both beta-adrenergic antagonists and agonists; it also showed an increase in tryptophan fluorescence after ligand binding. This property was used for the physicochemical study of the hapten-antibody interaction.", 
    "11": "The effects of bile acids (deoxycholic, cholic and dehydrocholic) were studied on the action of certain autonomic system drugs (isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline and acetylcholine). It was also tried to explain the causes of these changes in the light of the results of experiments with the widely used antagonists of adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. The experiments were carried out on isolated rat intestine by the method of Magnus. It was found that bile acids decreased the relaxing effect of isoprenaline and caused inversion of the action of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the intestine. Changes in the action of catecholamines are caused by stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors enhanced by bile acids, with a simultaneous decreased stimulation of beta-receptors. Bile acids cause also an increase of the effect of acetylcholine on the intestine.", 
    "12": "The lipolytic response to fatigue-induced stress was studied in fed and fasted rabbits and in fed propranolol-treated rabbits. The initial plasma glycerol level was higher and the increase in glycerol after stress was lower in fasted as compared to fed animals. Propranolol lowered the initial glycerol level and attenuated the fatigue-induced rise in glycerol concentration. The data suggest that in rabbits, as in other species, catecholamines increase lipolysis through stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors. The increment in alpha-adrenergic responsiveness during fasting may contribute to decreased glycerol response to stress observed in fasted rabbits.", 
    "13": "The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of alpha and beta adrenoceptor blockade on gastric acid secretion, mucosal blood flow (GMBF) and catecholamine content of the gastric mucosa during glucagon-induced inhibition of gastric acid secretion. The secretory response to continuous infusion of pentagastrin (6 micrograms/kg/h) was reduced by regitine (0.5 mg/kg/h) and propranolol (25 micrograms/kg/h). Glucagon (25 ng/kg/h) further slightly decreased HCl secretion. GMBF was also significantly inhibited by regitine and propranolol. Administration of glucagon continued decreasing of the GMBF. By determining the change in the ratio of blood flow to secretory rate, this reduction in mucosal blood flow was found to be secondary to a fall in secretion. In these studies a concomitant increase in noradrenaline content of the gastric mucosa was observed: after regitine by 50%, after propranolol--by 32.5%, after these blockers given simultaneously--by 75%. The level of noradrenaline was higher after subsequent administration of glucagon. Our results indicate that more than one component is responsible for the inhibitory effect of glucagon on pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion.", 
    "14": "The degree of myocardial cell necroses after stress was investigated in 6 pigs, weighing 70 to 90 kg. The stress was induced by a myorelaxant, succinylcholine, for about 12 min. The alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent phenoxybenzamine (PBZ) was given orally 3 times a day in a total dose of 50 to 60 mg per day for 6 to 7 days before the stress. The plasma levels of noradrenaline and adrenaline were assayed in blood samples drawn before, during, and immediately after the period of stress. Heart cell necroses were found in all the cases. The activity of the sympathetic-adrenomedullary system, indicated by the plasma levels of catecholamines, was intense during the stress. When the present results were compared with those of earlier studies the degree of heart cell necroses was significantly smaller after PBZ in control pigs but significantly higher than after the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent propranolol given for about a week. PBZ exerts a number of different actions, as briefly discussed, some of them appearing to be harmful for the heart during stress while others appear to be protective for the heart.", 
    "15": "The cardiac electrophysiologic actions of a novel calcium antagonist, KB-944 [Fostedil, Abbott-53986, diethyl 4-(benzothiazol-2-yl) benzylphosphonate], were examined in anesthetized dogs. Cumulative doses of 0.5, 2.5 and 12.5 mg/kg i.v. produced dose-dependent increases in atrioventricular (AV) nodal refractoriness and conduction time (AH interval), although failing to alter atrial or ventricular refractoriness. Intra-atrial, infranodal and intraventricular conduction (PA, HV and H-EG intervals, respectively) were unchanged. In three of nine dogs, 2.5 to 12.5 mg/kg of KB-944 produced third degree AV blockade. Pretreatment with propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) was accompanied by sinoatrial blockade in three of five dogs who later received 12.5 mg/kg of KB-944. Glucagon (4 micrograms/kg) reversed the electrophysiologic changes associated with administration of KB-944 alone or in conjunction with propranolol. An examination of the temporal profiles of the cardiac electrophysiologic effects of KB-944 indicated selective alterations in AV nodal conduction and refractoriness for durations of approximately 60, 120 and 180 to 240 min after administration of 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg i.v. These results suggest that KB-944 may be an effective agent for treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias via selective depression of the AV nodal conduction system.", 
    "16": "A method for determination of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP) in dog serum was developed. Dog alpha 1-AGP was purified to homogeneity from pooled serum by DEAE and CM ion exchange chromatography. A monospecific antibody was obtained by injecting the antigen in rabbits. The antibody was used in a turbidimetric method that allowed detection at 10 micrograms/ml in serum. A linear correlation was found between the optical density and alpha 1-AGP concentration up to 20 micrograms alpha 1-AGP in the sample. The method has been used to demonstrate the effect of treatment with rifampicin on the alpha 1-AGP serum concentrations and its relation to the protein binding of oxprenolol and propranolol.", 
    "17": "The effects of chronic thyroxine treatment on cat soleus muscle contractions were studied. Maximum twitch tension, contraction time, half relaxation time and tension-time integral of maximal twitches of the soleus muscles of thyroxine treated cats were significantly decreased. Consequently, there was a decrease in tension and degree of fusion of incomplete tetanic contractions of the soleus muscle. The maximum tetanic tension was not statistically significantly changed, suggesting that the effects may be due to a decrease in the duration of the active state of the muscle. Isoprenaline given intravenously during incomplete tetanic contractions of the soleus muscle caused a statistically significant depression of tension in the control group but not in the thyroxine treated group. This further suggests reduction in the duration of the active state of soleus muscles of thyroxine treated cats. Propranolol injected chronically with thyroxine reversed or prevented the depression of tension caused by thyroxine treatment, suggesting the involvement of beta-adrenoceptors in these effects. The decrease in tension and degree of fusion during incomplete tetanic contractions of the thyroxine treated soleus could be responsible, at least partly, for the muscle weakness and tremor of thyrotoxicosis. Cyclic AMP may possibly be the mediator of these effects.", 
    "18": "Whole-body autoradiography of rats dosed with [14C]propranolol or [14C]nadolol have confirmed physicochemical predictions that nadolol, in contrast to propranolol, penetrates the CNS only to a slight extent, if at all. Differences between the CNS penetration of different beta-blockers have implications for the mechanism of the hypotensive action and the prevalence of side-effects associated with disturbance of the CNS.", 
    "19": "Dopamine, administered at a constant infusion rate of 1-2 micrograms/min into the cannulated sinus node artery of the isolated dog atrium, decreased sinus cycle length (SCL) from 630 +/- 19 to 501 +/- 22 msec (mean +/- SEM, 38 trials in 12 atria). However, on sinoatrial conduction time (SACT) estimated by a constant atrial pacing method, dopamine produced 2 types of response (shortening and lengthening) with sinus tachycardia. In 24 trials in 11 atria, the drug decreased SACT from 86 +/- 8 to 56 +/- 4 msec, and in 14 trials in 6 atria it increased SACT from 67 +/- 7 to 101 +/- 9 msec. In general, the effects of dopamine on SACT were dependent on the control levels of SCL: dopamine caused a reduction of SACT at small levels of SCL and a prolongation at large levels. At a control sinus rate of 120 beats/min, dopamine usually shortened SACT. Dopamine-induced shortening of SACT was blocked by a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol, and an uptake blocker, imipramine, but not by a dopaminergic inhibitor, sulpiride. Furthermore, dopamine-induced lengthening of SACT tended to be suppressed by propranolol, but not by sulpiride. It is concluded that the dopamine-induced changes in SACT are mediated via beta-adrenergic mechanism and partially due to a tyramine-like action.", 
    "20": "Electrophysiologic studies were performed in 10 patients (8 M, 2 F, mean age: 60.2 yrs) who had survived an episode of cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation. The purpose was to evaluate the usefulness of serial acute drug testing in selecting an effective chronic antiarrhythmic regimen. The cardiac arrest had always been sudden and unexpected. It occurred outside the hospital in 7 cases and in the hospital in 3 cases. Patients in whom cardiac arrest was associated with evidence of acute myocardial infarction were excluded from the study. Nine of the patients were suffering from chronic ischemic heart disease with 1 or more previous myocardial infarctions while 1 had no evidence of organic heart disease. A ventricular aneurysm was present in 4 of them. During control electrophysiologic study a sustained VT was induced by ventricular stimulation (single and double extrastimuli at various paced ventricular cycle lengths + bursts of rapid ventricular pacing) in 9 of the 10 patients (90%) and a non sustained VT was induced in 1 of them (10%). In 3 patients (30%) VT could be initiated only by right ventricular stimulation at a site different from the apex (outflow tract). During serial acute drug testing a totally effective drug regimen (successful in preventing the induction of any ventricular arrhythmia) was found in 6 of the 9 patients (66.7%) who underwent this procedure and a partially effective drug regimen (sustained VT no longer inducible, easier to interrupt and considerably slower) was found in 2 patients (22.2%). None of the patients who received a chronic antiarrhythmic therapy based on the results of serial acute drug testing died suddenly during a mean follow-up of 14.8 months (range: 3-29) and only 1 had a recurrence of cardiac arrest. The latter, however, was taking antiarrhythmic drugs at a dosage less than that proved to be effective during electropharmacological testing. The only patient who refused serial acute drug testing and received an empiric antiarrhythmic therapy died suddenly at the 21st month of the follow-up. It is also noteworthy that amiodarone, alone or in combination, was given chronically to 6 of our patients (60%). These results 1) indicate that serial electropharmacological testing is useful in selecting an effective long-term drug regimen in survivors of cardiac arrest, and 2) suggest that amiodarone may be effective in preventing sudden death in these patients.", 
    "21": "Advanced coronary atherosclerosis was produced in 30 mini-pigs by a combination of a hypercholesterolaemic diet and X-irradiation to the precordial region. Within 11-25 weeks after the irradiation, 13 of the 30 animals died a sudden death probably caused by coronary atherosclerosis. The contents of free and ester-bound cholesterol in the right coronary artery were significantly higher in the animals which died spontaneously than in surviving animals. In an untreated group of 12 animals 7 died whereas in a group treated with beta-pyridylcarbinol only 1 out of 5 died. In the coronary arteries, the contents of both free and ester-bound cholesterol were significantly lower in the beta-pyridylcarbinol-treated animals. In a sulfinpyrazone-treated group 3 out of 8, and in a metoprolol-treated group 2 out of 5 animals died. None of these drugs reduced the accumulation of cholesterol in the coronary arteries. The rate of sudden death was 26 +/- 6% (P less than 0.05) lower in the combined group of treated animals than in the untreated ones. By regular ECG recordings, signs which could predict the fatal outcome of the experiment were looked for. Although depressed ST segments were present before death in a few animals, this was not a regular phenomenon. It is concluded that advanced coronary atherosclerosis in mini-pigs often leads to sudden death and that this animal model seems suitable for testing the potential therapeutic effects of drugs.", 
    "22": "The addition of the calcium-antagonist Verapamil in order to antagonize myocardial side-effects under tokolysis with beta-mimetic agents was more and more critisized in the last time. We have therefore combined the tocolytic agent Hexoprenalin with the beta 1-blocking agent Metroprolol in 24 patients and have analysed the myoglobin level before as well as two and four hours after the beginning of tokolysis. There was no increase of serum-myoglobin seen under this tocolytic regime.", 
    "23": "Metoprolol, a beta 1-adrenergic blocking agent, has been found effective in the treatment of hypertension. A death due to deliberate ingestion of metoprolol is described, including the case history, postmortem toxicologic findings, and identification and quantitation of the drug by high pressure liquid chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Metoprolol levels were found to be 4.7 mg/L in blood, 194 mg/L in urine, 3.3 mg/L in vitreous humor, 3.9 mg/L in pleural fluid, 254 mg/L in bile, 7.1 mg/kg in kidney, and 6.3 mg/kg in liver.", 
    "24": "X-ray powder diffraction data for 9 commonly used drug substances are reported. The data for furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol hydrochloride, dexchlorpheniramine maleate, and brompheniramine maleate have been indexed by reference to published crystal structure data. The racemic modifications of propranolol hydrochloride and brompheniramine maleate are shown to exist as racemic compounds rather than racemic mixtures.", 
    "25": "A case history is reported of a patient who had several episodes of unconsciousness (because of ventricular extrasystole) while on antiarrhythmic and antihypertensive therapy consisting of quinidine (200 mg b. i. d.), sotalol (80 mg b. i. d.) and hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg g. d.). The syncopal attacks continued after discontinuation of quinidine but ended when sotalol was replaced by metoprolol and later on by verapamil. Marked prolongation of the previously normal Q-Tc interval (up to 0.71 s) was observed during the therapy with sotalol alone or combined with quinidine. The syncopal attacks were preceded by feeling of cardiac arrhythmia and they were most likely caused by torsade de pointes tachycardia. The prolongation of the Q-Tc interval by sotalol alone or combined with quinidine was obviously related to the tendency to cardiac arrhythmia and consequent episodes of unconsciousness.", 
    "26": "Concentrations of propranolol in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid can be reliably quantitated using liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. After addition of pronethalol as internal standard, alkalinized samples are extracted with hexane:isoamyl alcohol (98:2); the organic extract is separated, evaporated to dryness, reconstituted in mobile phase (acetonitrile:water:acetic acid, 30:69:1), and chromatographed on a reverse-phase C-18 column. Effluent is monitored with fluorescence detection at excitation and emission wavelengths of 235 and 335 nm. The simplified extraction procedure plus an automatic injection system allows one person to analyze up to 100 samples per day. Sensitivity limits are .5 ng of propranolol per ml of sample, and the method is applicable to experimental and clinical pharmacokinetic studies.", 
    "27": "Female rats were subjected to stress treatments during pregnancy and the offspring were studied at several different ages. The ligands [3H]WB-4101, [3H]clonidine and [3H]dihydroalprenolol were used to measure alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta receptor binding in several brain regions. At 16 but not at 23, 40 or 60 days of age the offspring showed reduced alpha 1 and beta receptor binding in cerebral cortex whereas a previous study had shown a similarly transient elevation of norepinephrine (NE) level at 16 days of age. The 60 day-old offspring showed only a reduced alpha 2 binding which appeared to have no regional specificity. Consistent with our previous finding that in 60 day-old offspring NE levels were not significantly affected by maternal stress exposure in almost all brain regions studied, we find no effect on the ability of nerve endings to synthesise catecholamines. These data provide additional support for the proposal that prenatal stress results in permanent neurochemical changes and suggest that there may be a delayed or impaired development of the postsynaptic elements of noradrenergic neurons.", 
    "28": "The effects of timolol on the elevation of intraocular pressure induced by orogastric water-loading were studied in conscious pigmented rabbits which had undergone unilateral, superior cervical ganglionectomy. Each rabbit was studied without timolol treatment and with unilateral 2% timolol treatment, either to the innervated eye or to the denervated eye, 90 min before water-loading. Timolol, applied to the innervated eye, significantly reduced the elevation of intraocular pressure in that eye, but not in the fellow eye. Timolol, applied to the denervated eye, did not affect the elevated intraocular pressure in either the denervated or the fellow eye. These results demonstrate that ocular adrenergic innervation participates in the mechanism of ocular hypotensive action of timolol in water-loaded pigmented rabbits.", 
    "29": "Sodium salicylate (5-10 mM) has been used to distinguish the effects of the three calcium-antagonist subgroups which had been previously differentiated in functional studies. Sodium salicylate (10 mM) reduced the antagonistic effects of verapamil and diltiazem on Ca2+-induced contractions of K+ (40 mM)-depolarized taenia preparations from the guinea-pig caecum. In contrast, salicylate had no effect on the potency of nifedipine and increased the inhibitory effects of cinnarizine and flunarizine. Sodium salicylate (10 mM) had little effect on Ca2+-induced contractions per se. In preparations pretreated with calcium-antagonists and recontracted with high concentrations of Ca2+, salicylate (5 mM) caused an additional contraction when the preparations had been pretreated with verapamil or diltiazem but had no effect in control or nifedipine-treated preparations. In contrast, salicylate relaxed Ca2+-induced contractions in tissues which had been pretreated with cinnarizine, flunarizine, pimozide, bepridil, fendiline, perhexiline and with the calmodulin antagonist W-7. The mechanism of action of salicylate was investigated. Inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis or of oxidative phosphorylation by salicylate was not responsible for these effects because indomethacin (28 microM) and 2,4-dinitrophenol (20 microM) did not differentiate between calcium antagonists. The effects of salicylate are ascribed to an increase in negative surface charge on the membrane because other agents changing surface charge (3,5-dichlorosalicylate, 0.3 mM; benzoate, 20 mM) have similar effects and their potency is dependent on their affinity for lipid membranes. Furthermore, salicylate increased the effectiveness of the cationic local anaesthetic, (+)-propranolol (100 microM), but did not change the effects of the neutral local anesthetic, benzocaine (1 mM). It is argued that salicylate increases the effectiveness of cinnarizine by increasing accumulation of this drug in the cell membrane or at intracellular sites whereas the reduced effectiveness of verapamil and diltiazem is secondary to a change in the state of the Ca2+ channel.", 
    "30": "Responses to dopamine were examined in the guinea-pig isolated lung parenchymal strip. Complete cumulative concentration-response curves to dopamine exhibited a biphasic pattern with a small initial contraction at concentrations below 10(-5) M followed by a dose-dependent relaxation at higher concentrations. Phentolamine (10(-5) M) completely abolished the contractile component and enhanced sensitivity and maximal relaxation to dopamine. In the presence of phentolamine, propranolol antagonized the dopamine-induced relaxation (pA2 = 8.54 +/- 0.07). In the presence of propranolol (10(-6) M), dopamine produced a dose-related contraction displaced to the right by phentolamine. Incubation with haloperidol (10(-5) M) did not modify the characteristics of the concentration-response curve to dopamine. Pretreatment with reserpine abolished the contraction to dopamine without affecting its relaxant response. Cocaine significantly increased the pD2 value of dopamine in the presence of propranolol. It is concluded that dopamine produced both relaxation of lung parenchymal strip due to direct activation of beta-adrenoceptors and contraction mediated through direct and indirect (catecholamine release) actions at alpha-adrenoceptors. There is no evidence in favour of the existence of specific dopamine-receptors in this preparation.", 
    "31": "Higher adrenalin sensitivity of mitochondrial processes in the small intestinal mucosa compared to that in liver mitochondria, was revealed under specially devised conditions of work with isolated mitochondria retaining their natural properties. Fifteen minutes after intraperitoneal injection of adrenalin into rats in a dose of 5 micrograms/100 bw an increase in Ca2+ capacity was seen only in intestinal mucosa mitochondria. The adrenalin-induced activation of oxidative phosphorylation was more remarkable in intestinal than in liver mitochondria at the initial stages of adrenalin action. The effect of adrenalin was completely reversed by the beta-blocker propranolol only in liver mitochondria. After 3 hours the adrenalin-induced activation of phosphorylation in the mitochondria ceases, whereas in the small intestinal mucosa it still persists.", 
    "32": "The elimination of atenolol (20 mg i.v.) has been studied in seven patients with renal failure on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Although atenolol was eliminated in the peritoneal fluid, the amount recovered in 24 h was relatively low (1.2 +/- 0.15 mg). The calculated urinary (n = 4) and peritoneal (n = 7) clearance was 0.289 +/- 0.058 l/h and 0.152 +/- 0.018 l/h respectively. This was considerably less than calculated total body clearance (1.21 +/- 0.086 l/h). The kinetics of atenolol in CAPD are worthy of further study.", 
    "33": "Thirty-two pregnant hypertensive patients were treated with oxprenolol administered in combination with dihydralazine as Trasipressol tablets. Before delivery, oxprenolol was demonstrable in the maternal plasma and the amniotic fluid. The free fraction of oxprenolol in the maternal serum (15% +/- 7.8; mean +/- s.d.; n = 25) was similar to that in normal serum. At the end of delivery, oxprenolol was found in both the maternal and umbilical plasma in most cases. Measurable, but low oxprenolol concentrations were present in the newborn plasma. After delivery, oxprenolol was demonstrable in the maternal plasma and breast milk. An infant weighing 3 kg and consuming 500 ml of breast milk per day would receive a maximum dose 60 times less than the normal daily dose for a hypertensive adult (4 mg/kg).", 
    "34": "The oral and intravenous pharmacokinetics of labetalol were determined in five subjects before and after a 3 week course of glutethimide 500 mg/day. After glutethimide there was a significant reduction in the AUC after the oral dose of labetalol, from 40,596 +/- 11,534 (mean +/- s.e. mean) to 22,057 +/- 6,276 ng ml-1 min (2P less than 0.05), and systemic bioavailability was reduced from 30.3 +/- 2.8 to 17.0 +/- 3.5% (2P less than 0.001). There was no significant change in labetalol plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) following an intravenous dose, half-life, volume of distribution, and plasma clearance. The oral and intravenous pharmacokinetics of labetalol were determined in six subjects before and after a 3 day course of cimetidine 1.6 g/day. After cimetidine there was a significant reduction in the volume of distribution of labetalol, from 520 +/- 51 to 445 +/- 24 1 (2P less than 0.05). The AUC of labetalol after the oral dose increased by 66%, from 51,029 +/- 7,950 to 84,772 +/- 19,444 ng ml-1 min (2P = 0.06). The systemic bioavailability of labetalol increased from 25.1 +/- 2.4 to 39.0 +/- 7.6% (2P = 0.06). There was no significant change in labetalol AUC after the intravenous dose, half life, and plasma clearance. There were no significant changes in resting heart rate and supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure following labetalol plus glutethimide, or labetalol plus cimetidine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "The effect of equivalent hypolipidaemic doses of cholestyramine (8 g) or colestipol (10 g) on the plasma concentrations of propranolol and 4'-hydroxypropranolol was studied in 12 normal volunteers following the oral administration of 120 mg of normal release propranolol tablets. When two doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol were administered prior to the propranolol, the peak plasma concentrations and area under the curve for both propranolol and the metabolite 4'-hydroxypropranolol were reduced significantly (P less than 0.05). We conclude that the drug interaction between cholestyramine or colestipol and propranolol leads to significant reductions in plasma concentrations of propranolol and 4'-hydroxypropranolol which may cause a clinically diminished effect for a given dosage. Therefore, patients should be observed when either of these resins are added to or deleted from a therapeutic regimen.", 
    "36": "Nifedipine, metoprolol and atenolol were administered orally to young, healthy volunteers. Each drug was given alone and nifedipine was also given with both beta-adrenoceptor blockers. Each drug was given for 3 days immediately before the study days. Plasma and urine drug concentrations were measured and the relevant pharmacokinetic parameters calculated. No pharmacokinetic interaction between nifedipine and the beta-adrenoceptor blockers was revealed.", 
    "37": "The effect of the withdrawal of long-term beta-adrenoceptor blockade on pulse rate and finger tremor was studied in 27 patients who had been treated for 2 years following an uncomplicated myocardial infarction with either atenolol, propranolol or placebo. During treatment, pulse rate was significantly lower in patients treated with propranolol or atenolol compared with placebo. Compared with the response in the placebo group the mean increase in tremor on withdrawal of propranolol was statistically significant for postural and for work tremor in both hands. A significant increase in tremor on withdrawal of atenolol occurred only in the postural position and in a narrow frequency band (left hand, 7-11 Hz; right hand, 7-9 Hz). The differences in the effect on tremor of withdrawal of treatment with propranolol or atenolol in doses which produced similar reductions in heart rate, emphasise the beta 2 classification of peripheral receptors associated with normal muscle tremor but do not exclude the involvement of beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "38": "Direct cardiodepressant activities of three beta-blockers, carteolol, pindolol and propranolol, were estimated using heart-lung preparation of the dog. Beta-blocking doses of these drugs to inhibit the positive chronotropic effect of isoproterenol by 50% were 2.2 micrograms for carteolol, 4.0 micrograms for pindolol and 21 micrograms for propranolol. Cardiac performance of the preparation was not influenced by up to 1 mg of these three beta-blockers. After 10 mg of these drugs, the cardiac function curves were shifted rightward and downward indicating the heart failure. It was doubtful, however, that this result indicated the cardiodepressant action of beta-blockers, for the preparation showed spontaneous deterioration without beta-blocker treatment. The influences of these beta-blockers on the compromised heart-lung preparations showed essentially similar results. In conclusion, direct cardiodepressant activity of the beta-blocker, if any, was exerted with far more large doses than their beta-blocking doses. The implication of the results in clinical use of beta-blockers, especially in relation to heart failure, was discussed.", 
    "39": "In unanaesthetized sheep, the sensitivity of the baroreceptor-cardio-inhibitory reflex was greater when intravenous vasopressin was used to raise blood pressure, than when intravenous phenylephrine was used to raise blood pressure. This difference was still evident in animals in which beta-adrenergic blockade had been carried out using propranolol. In the presence of combined beta-adrenergic and muscarinic blockade, a direct negative chronotropic effect of intravenous vasopressin could not be demonstrated. It was concluded, therefore, that intravenous vasopressin enhanced cardiac vagal tone. This effect of vasopressin on efferent cardiac vagal tone was confirmed directly in anaesthetized dogs by recording from single cardiac vagal efferent fibres. Furthermore, recordings from single carotid sinus baroreceptor fibres did not demonstrate a direct action of vasopressin on the sensitivity of the baroreceptors. However, the pressor effect of vasopressin is associated with a greater increase in efferent cardiac vagal discharge than that seen when equipressor doses of phenylephrine are given, or when blood pressure is raised by a similar amount by inflation of an intra-aortic balloon. Studies in isolated guinea-pig atrial preparations and in anaesthetized rabbits and dogs, revealed no consistent peripheral action of vasopressin on the action of the vagus at the heart.", 
    "40": "A 52-year-old man receiving long-term hemodialysis and a beta-adrenergic blocker for hypertension had symptoms of acute bronchospasm when exposed to a new hemodialyzer. Resistant to two doses of subcutaneous epinephrine (1 mL of 1:1000 dilution) and one intravenous dose of aminophylline (250 mg), the bronchospasm was rapidly relieved by metaproterenol sulfate given by inhalation one hour later.", 
    "41": "Propranolol hydrochloride is reported to lower portal pressure and inhibit renin secretion in patients with chronic liver disease, actions that might lessen the tendency to ascites formation. We compared the effect of diuretics with that of the same dose of diuretics plus propranolol on natriuresis, urine output, and daily weight loss in 13 hospitalized patients with stable chronic liver disease, sodium retention, and ascites. The propranolol hydrochloride dose was 20 to 160 mg four times a day, titrated to reduce resting pulse by 25% or systolic BP 10 mm Hg. Diuretics given were furosemide, 80 to 160 mg, and triamterene, 100 or 200 mg/day. Periods of time when each regimen was received ranged from one to four days. Creatinine excretion documented complete urine collections. Compared with diuretics alone, diuretics plus propranolol substantially reduced resting pulse, systolic BP, and urine sodium excretion, although not creatinine clearance. This antinatriuretic effect may limit the proposed usefulness of propranolol for prevention of variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.", 
    "42": "Lipophilic amine drugs such as propranolol and lidocaine are actively sequestered by tissues via saturable cytoplasmic binding systems. The present studies were designed to characterize the kinetics of drug transport and sequestration in rat brain in vivo by using the carotid injection technique. Both propranolol and lidocaine are sequestered by brain, and the half time (t 1/2) of clearance of the drugs from brain to blood is 6-7 min. The t 1/2 of propranolol association and dissociation reactions with the brain sequestration system are 0.38 +/- 0.03 and 1.33 +/- 0.20 min, respectively. The blood-brain barrier transport of propranolol and lidocaine is inhibited by acid pH, and drug transport is mediated by a low-affinity, high-capacity saturable transport system [propranolol half-saturation constant (Km) = 9.8 +/- 1.2 mM, maximal rate of saturable transport (Vmax) = 5.7 +/- 0.7 mumol X min-1 X g-1, and nonsaturable transport constant (KD) = 0.061 +/- 0.012 ml X min-1 X g-1). These studies indicate that in addition to cerebral blood flow, the distribution of lipophilic amines in brain is a function of plasma pH and of the activity of brain sequestration systems. The latter may represent high-capacity cytoplasmic drug-binding proteins that normally bind endogenous ligands in brain.", 
    "43": "The effects of low concentrations of Ba have been studied on dog Purkinje fibers and on guinea pig left ventricular epicardium. In both tissues, Ba induces diastolic depolarization at a membrane potential more negative than -80 mV. This effect becomes clearly detectable at concentrations as low as 10-20 microM in Purkinje fibers bathed in 5.4 mM K Tyrode solution and around 100 microM in ventricular epicardium. In both tissues the Ba-induced depolarization is blocked in a dose-dependent manner by low concentrations of Cs (0.5-5 mM) as is the normal pacemaker current (if) in Purkinje fibers. In ventricular muscle the Ba-induced depolarization develops at the same rate whether the tissue is at rest or depolarized by repetitive stimulation. The maximum (initial) slope of diastolic depolarization is insensitive to D 600, La, and 4-aminopyridine, increased by tetraethylammonium chloride, decreased by tetrodotoxin, and almost entirely suppressed by Na removal. Experimental data and reconstruction of electrical activity suggest that in ventricular muscle the Ba-induced diastolic depolarization results to a large extent from the unmasking of a small pacemaker inward current, mainly carried by Na ions and similar to the pacemaker current of Purkinje fibers. Unmasking of the depolarizing effect of the pacemaker current is very likely due to the decrease by Ba of the inward going rectification. Steady-state inward Na current flowing through the Na window can increase the diastolic depolarization. Residual Cs-insensitive, Ba-induced diastolic depolarization may result from a time-dependent blockade of the background K conductance like the one described in skeletal muscle.", 
    "44": "Hepatic zinc metallothionein (MT) levels are increased in response to a variety of stresses. Glucocorticoid induction of zinc thionein is insufficient in accounting for the levels attained. The potential involvement of catecholamines in the modulation of rat hepatic zinc metabolism and zinc thionein levels has been systematically studied. Eleven hours after multiple injections (6) of epinephrine, norepinephrine, or isoproterenol, zinc thionein levels of 4.01 +/- 0.74, 6.83 +/- 0.67, and 11.75 +/- 0.96 micrograms Zn in MT/g liver, respectively, were attained (untreated, 1.04 +/- 0.14). The levels of hepatic zinc thionein thus reached the range of stress response-induced levels (4-10 micrograms Zn in MT/g liver), attained 11 h after the onset of the stress. Multiple injections of isoproterenol and norepinephrine induced the formation of isoforms MT-I and MT-II in roughly equal amounts. The alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phentolamine blocked the 11-h increase in norepinephrine-stimulated (6) zinc thionein levels by 88%. The beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol blocked the 11-h increase in isoproterenol-stimulated (6) zinc thionein levels by 55%. This inhibition could be increased to 72% by previous administration of both phentolamine and propranolol. Catecholamines stimulated increases in both the zinc and the protein of MT, the latter as assessed by [35S]cysteine incorporation. Both of these increases were blocked by cycloheximide, confirming the requirement for de novo protein synthesis in this induction response.", 
    "45": "The enhanced left ventricular (LV) performance observed in anemia has been attributed to changes in preload and afterload. Whether there is a concomitant increase in contractility is controversial. Seventeen patients with chronic anemia (hematocrit range 17 to 30%) and 17 control subjects, matched by age and sex, were studied. In 10 patients and 10 control subjects (group I), a noninvasive evaluation of LV function through M-mode echocardiography and cuff blood pressure recording was performed. In patients with anemia, stroke volume increased 43% (p less than 0.01), fractional shortening 21% (p less than 0.001), and mean rate of circumferential shortening 32% (p less than 0.001). In patients with anemia, end-systolic stress decrease 27% (p less than 0.05) and diastolic blood pressure 21% (p less than 0.001). The effect of serum from these patients and control subjects on the development of isometric tension by isolated cat papillary muscles was assessed compared with the basal (Ringer-Locke bath) values. Anemia serum increased maximal developed tension 21% and maximal rate of tension development 20% relative to basal levels. These changes were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than the increases produced by control serum (8% and 7%, respectively). In the 7 patients with anemia in group II and their matched controls, the in vitro isometric tension characteristics were assessed before and after blocking beta adrenoreceptors with propranolol, 10(-6) M. The observed increase in the developed tension persisted after beta blockade, as well as the enhancement of the maximal rate of tension development. Plasma catecholamine levels in this group II were within the normal range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "Metoprolol or placebo was gradually withdrawn during 1 week in 115 patients participating in a 3-year, double-blind, postinfarction study. During the first month after withdrawal mental symptoms and increased cardiac symptoms occurred significantly more frequently in the metoprolol group. Disabling symptoms requiring reinstitution of treatment were seen in 14 of 58 in the metoprolol group vs 4 of 57 in the placebo group (p less than 0.05). In the metoprolol group, there was a rebound increase of basal heart rate and of the heart rate response to orthostatic testing during 3 weeks after withdrawal, when compared to values obtained 6 months later. In 27 patients plasma catecholamine levels were analyzed during repeated exercise tests and orthostatic provocations. Plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine responses to exercise were reduced 1 week after completion of withdrawal. At this time norepinephrine levels tended to be lower in relation to heart rate at all work loads. Our laboratory findings may be related to increased beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness, but unmasking of ischemic symptoms probably contributed to the clinical findings.", 
    "47": "Radionuclide angiography was used to study the effects of supine and upright bicycle exercise and handgrip exercise in 17 (12 well-trained) normal subjects before (control) and immediately after the administration of propranolol (160 mg/day for 4 days). Cardiac hemodynamic values were related to position in that control left ventricular volumes and the cardiac index were greater in the supine position than in the upright at rest but resting left ventricular ejection fraction was similar in both positions. The pressure volume index was greater in the upright position than in the supine. At maximal exercise before treatment, however, similar cardiovascular hemodynamic measurements were recorded in both positions. Propranolol increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume at rest and at maximal exercise. Left ventricular end-systolic volume, however, was substantially greater only in the upright position both at rest and at maximal exercise when compared with control values. Heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, cardiac index, and pressure volume index were decreased at rest and maximal exercise after treatment with propranolol. Ejection fraction was decreased in the upright position after propranolol administration but was unchanged in the supine position. Handgrip exercise primarily increased heart rate and arterial pressure and did not affect cardiac volume, and this response was unaffected by propranolol.", 
    "48": "The calcium-dependent release of [3H]dopamine ([3H]DA) elicited by field stimulation or potassium is modulated through activation of stereoselective inhibitory DA autoreceptors of the D-2 subtype that are pharmacologically different from the D-1 DA receptor subtype linked to the stimulation of adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1). The D-2 DA autoreceptors appear to be endogenously activated by DA because DA receptor antagonists such as S-sulpiride increased the stimulation-evoked release of [3H]DA. Nanomolar concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the electrical stimulation-evoked release of [3H]DA. The inhibitory effect of these catecholamines was not modified by S-sulpiride, which, on the contrary, selectively antagonized the inhibition of [3H]DA release elicited by exogenous DA. Phentolamine or (+/-)-propranolol did not affect the release of [3H]DA from rabbit retina. The alpha antagonist phentolamine competitively antagonized the inhibitory effect of both NE and E, which suggests that these catecholamines activate alpha receptors in retina. The decrease by catecholamines of the calcium-dependent release of [3H]DA appears not to involve beta adrenoceptors because their inhibitory effect was not modified by propranolol. Under identical experimental conditions (i.e., nomifensine, 30 microM), serotonin did not modify the stimulated release of [3H]DA. In conclusion, in the rabbit retina, DA autoreceptors of the D-2 subtype appear to modulate endogenously released DA whereas inhibitory presynaptic alpha receptors might be of pharmacological importance as sites of action for retinal or blood-borne catecholamines.", 
    "49": "Serum propranolol concentration, elimination t 1/2, and protein binding were studied after a combined intravenous/oral regimen in 20 subjects with myocardial infarction (MI) and 15 with chest pain (CP). There was 1000% interindividual variation in propranolol concentrations in each group. In the MI group, mean total serum propranolol concentrations were greater than 100 nmol/l, except at 7 hr, when there was a trough not present in subjects with CP. Mean elimination t 1/2 s in subjects with MI (7.2) and CP (7.4 hr) did not differ. There were significantly higher alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentrations and reduced percent unbound propranolol 27 hr after infarction. Free propranolol concentrations were lower 7 and 11 hr after dosing in the MI group, but concentrations thereafter were of the same order as those in subjects with CP. The only significant difference in any of the hemodynamic measurements was at 7 hr, when blood pressure was higher in the MI group. We conclude that propranolol kinetics were altered in subjects with MI and suggest that the regimen could be improved by increased propranolol dosage at commencement of therapy.", 
    "50": "The relationship between reductions in essential tremor and concentrations of metoprolol and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol was examined in five patients with essential tremor after treatment with 0, 25, 50, and 75 mg metoprolol twice daily for 7 to 10 days. Serum concentrations of metoprolol and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol were measured simultaneous to serial accelerometry measurements of tremor over 8-hr periods. There was a relationship between degree of tremor reduction and steady-state metoprolol concentration. Time course of the drug and metabolite concentration correlated better with the time course of effect than with the time course of metoprolol concentration alone. Data suggest that the alpha-hydroxymetabolite of metoprolol may contribute to the reduction in essential tremor.", 
    "51": "The purpose of this study was to characterize left ventricular systolic elastances as derived from pressure-segment length and pressure-diameter relationships, and to compare the resulting regional and global elastances to known changes in inotropy. Left ventricular pressure-segment length and pressure-diameter were varied in a series of consecutive beats by means of a volume-loading technique, and both regional and global relationships at 20-msec intervals throughout systole were found to be nonlinear and to exhibit hysteresis. In eight animals, regional hysteresis was present after vagotomy, propranolol (1.0 mg/kg), and atropine (0.1 mg/kg), and was present no matter whether hearts were loaded by volume (45-60 ml/sec) or by pressure (partial aortic occlusion) over a similar range of left ventricular systolic pressures. Elastance was linearly approximated by the slope of the major axis of the hysteresis loops. In each instance, elastance increased to a maximum and then decreased, thus defining end-systole. In seven animals, maximum elastance-length and -diameter were compared before and after treatments with dobutamine (5-13 micrograms/kg per min) and propranolol (6-51 micrograms/kg per min), or after induction of global ischemia. Dobutamine increased maximum elastance-diameter by 37% (P less than 0.01) and maximum elastance-length by 159% (P less than 0.05). Propranolol decreased maximum elastance-diameter by 27% (P less than 0.05) and maximum elastance-length by 6% (P = NS). Global ischemia (50% reduction in coronary flow) did not significantly change either maximum elastance-diameter or -length. However, with ischemia, the diameter intercept of maximum elastance-diameter increased by 24% (P less than 0.025), and the time to maximum elastance-length decreased by 33% (P less than 0.01). Comparing all interventions, the percent changes in maximum elastance-length and -diameter related directly but with a low correlation coefficient (r = 0.49). These differences in regional and global elastance suggest a complex relationship between regional and global myocardial mechanics, and may not necessarily reflect specific changes in contractility.", 
    "52": "To investigate whether thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) has additional cardiac electrophysiological and hemodynamic effects when induced after beta-adrenergic blockade, bupivacaine (0.7-1.2 mg/kg) was injected into the epidural space at T2-3 after intravenous injection of atenolol (1.0 mg/kg) in anesthetized dogs. Cardiac electrophysiology was studied by His bundle electrography, programmed electrical stimulation, and monophasic action potential recordings. Atenolol reduced heart rate, prolonged atrio-ventricular (AV) nodal impulse conduction time and refractoriness, prolonged ventricular refractoriness and action potential duration, and decreased left ventricular (LV) dP/dt max. Addition of TEA further reduced heart rate, prolonged AV nodal conduction time and refractoriness, decreased LV dP/dt max and arterial blood pressure, but had no effect on atrial and ventricular electrophysiology. Induction of TEA during beta-blockade may thus have additive depressive effects on sinoatrial and AV nodal functions, as well as on left ventricular inotropy. The study indicates that the cardiac electrophysiological effects induced by TEA are mainly caused by decreased beta-receptor stimulation, but increased vagal activity may also contribute.", 
    "53": "We studied the effects of two structurally unrelated inhibitors of the fatty acid cyclooxygenase and of alpha and beta adrenergic blockade on the elevated plasma levels of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin (PG)E2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and thromboxane (TX)B2, the stable derivatives of PGE2, PGI2 (prostacyclin) and TXA2, respectively, in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Meclofenamic acid and indomethacin each produced a significant decrease in the elevated plasma levels of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2. Phentolamine significantly reduced the plasma level of TXB2 but had no effect on the elevated circulating levels of glucose, free fatty acids, total ketones, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2 or 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. Propranolol significantly reduced the elevated circulating levels of glucose, free fatty acids and total ketones but had no effect on the levels of the three prostaglandin derivatives. The ability of meclofenamic acid and indomethacin to reduce the plasma levels of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2 confirms that the plasma levels of these three derivatives are elevated in rats with DKA. Since abnormalities in the production of PGI2 and perhaps other cyclooxygenase derivatives may contribute to the pathogenesis of certain important hemodynamic and gastrointestinal features of DKA, cyclooxygenase inhibitors may play a role in the management of selected patients with this disorder. Alpha adrenergic activity is essential for the maintenance of the elevated plasma TXB2 level in rats with DKA. The fall in the plasma TXB2 level during alpha adrenergic blockade appears to reflect inhibition of platelet aggregation and platelet TXA2 production, but other sources of the elevated plasma TXB2 level in DKA are not excluded. Beta adrenergic activity contributes to the maintenance of elevated circulating levels of glucose, free fatty acids and total ketones in experimental DKA but not to the elevated plasma levels of the prostaglandin derivatives.",

    "55": "These conventional antiarrhythmic agents, plus tocainide, are important drugs for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias.

    "56": "The elevated serum gonadotropin (GtH) levels in goldfish receiving two injections of des Gly10, [D-Ala6] LH-RH ethylamide (LH-RH-A), given 12-hr apart, were reduced by apomorphine, a dopamine agonist, injected at either the first or the second LH-RH-A injection. Serum GtH concentrations in goldfish given two injections of LH-RH-A at a 3-hr interval were also depressed by bromocriptine, a specific D-2 dopamine receptor agonist, administered simultaneously with both LH-RH-A injections. Injections of dopamine antagonists, pimozide or metoclopramide (a specific D-2 antagonist) caused increased serum GtH concentrations in normal goldfish, but no changes were found following injections of the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine, the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, or the sympathomimetic agent octopamine. Injection of pimozide or metoclopramide at the time of the second of two LH-RH-A injections given at an interval of 12 hr potentiated the LH-RH-A-induced increase in serum GtH concentrations; injections of phentolamine, propranolol, or octopamine did not alter the response to LH-RH-A. Injections of pimozide or metoclopramide also increased the frequency of ovulation in LH-RH-A-injected gravid female goldfish. These results suggest that stimulation of dopamine receptors can block the potentiating effect of multiple injections of GtH-releasing hormone, as well as ongoing LH-RH-A-stimulated release. The results also indicate that the dopamine inhibition of GtH secretion is specific and may be mediated by receptors resembling the D-2 type receptors in mammals.", 
    "57": "The drug albetol (labetalol) was used in 97 patients with stage I-III essential hypertension (according to the WHO classification) and 13 patients with stable arterial hypertension of renal genesis. Albetol exerted a marked hypotensive effect beginning from the 2-3d day of the treatment and peaking on the 6-8th day of the treatment. To normalize the blood pressure, the patients with labile hypertension were given the drug in a dose of 200-400 mg/day whilst in the patients with a stable course the dose used was 600-2200 mg/day (858 mg/day on the average). In patients with the hyperkinetic type of the hemodynamics the blood pressure decreased following albetol administration at the expense of a reduction in the cardiac index and the heart rate whereas in patients with the hypokinetic type it was achieved mostly at the expense of a decreased vascular resistance to the blood flow. The drug was effective in 69% of the patients, it was well tolerated and induced no side effects.", 
    "58": "In a double-blind, cross-over multicentre trial, the prophylactic antimigraine effect of the beta 1-selective beta-blocker metoprolol was evaluated and compared with that of the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol. Metoprolol was used in a dosage of 50 mg b.i.d. and propranolol in 40 mg b.i.d. 56 patients with classical or common migraine were included in the double-blind part of the investigation. 3 patients withdrew, but none because of side-effects. The data suggest that metoprolol is clinically equivalent in effectiveness to propranolol in migraine prophylaxis regarding parameters such as attack frequency, improvement in sum of severity score and subjective evaluation. Both drugs were generally well tolerated and the number of reported side-effects was similar to those reported during the run-in period (placebo).", 
    "59": "475 patients with suspected uncomplicated myocardial infarction (MI) were divided into 3 groups based on their entry ECG: group 1--significant ST elevation; group 2a--ST depression or T inversion; group 2b--normal ECG. Infarction was confirmed in 99.7% of group 1, 68.5% of group 2a and 39.7% of group 2b patients. Despite similar clinical, haemodynamic and historical variables at presentation, group 1 patients had significantly larger MI, more in-hospital complications and a higher short-term and long-term mortality (P less than 0.005) than group 2 patients. The entry ECG of patients with suspected MI is an excellent and simple predictor of those who are most likely to have an MI confirmed and identifies a group of patients at high risk of death or developing complications.", 
    "60": "The characteristics of 51Cr-labelled E. coli endotoxin binding to human erythrocyte membranes in vitro have been investigated. A saturable component of binding was apparent at low endotoxin concentrations (less than 50 micrograms ml-1) relevant to its in vivo actions, while at higher concentrations binding was non-saturable and increased in linear fashion. Experiments examining the ability of unlabelled endotoxin to antagonize the binding of labelled toxin provided further evidence for these specific and non-specific modes of endotoxin-membrane interaction. Membrane-active agents previously shown to reduce endotoxin toxicity in vivo decreased endotoxin binding to erythrocyte membranes in vitro, with propranolol and pranolium being the most effective in this regard. Tissue distribution studies following administration of radiolabelled endotoxin to guinea-pigs showed a positive correlation between the accumulation of 51Cr-endotoxin in lung and elevations in plasma acid phosphatase activity, a measure of in vivo endotoxin toxicity. The in vivo accumulation of 51Cr-endotoxin in guinea-pig lung was reduced by prior treatment with (+)-propranolol or pranolium, paralleling the results of the in vitro binding studies. Our results suggest that membrane-active agents such as (+)-propranolol may be useful adjuncts to antimicrobial drugs in the therapy of gram-negative endotoxaemia.", 
    "61": "A new beta-blocking agent, atenolol was studied on the supposition that it was a beta-blocker without any action on central nervous system. Atenolol was orally given to 10 patients with essential hypertension once a day and changes in various parameters were observed through 24 hours. As the results, hypotensive effect was accompanied by marked reduction of heart rate, systemic vascular resistance, plasma renin activity and blood aldosterone level over 24 hours. It was a decrease in systemic vascular resistance that showed best correlation with hypotensive effect.", 
    "62": "The role of the renin system in the maintenance of the elevated systolic blood pressure in isolated systolic hypertension was investigated in 31 patients who received long-term treatment with propranolol (120 mg daily) and in another group of 22 patients with isolated systolic hypertension who received a test dose of captopril (25 or 50 mg). The greatest systolic blood pressure decrease (35 +/- 5 mm Hg) by propranolol occurred in the high-renin group (n = 9), and the smallest decrease (3 +/- 2 mm Hg) in the low-renin group (n = 9), whereas in the normal-renin group (n = 13), systolic blood pressure was decreased by propranolol by 22 +/- 5 mm Hg. For all the propranolol-treated patients, the decrement in the systolic blood pressure by propranolol was related to the control plasma renin activity (r = 0.63, p less than 0.01) and to the concurrent change in plasma renin activity (r = 0.70, p less than 0.001). Captopril decreased the systolic blood pressure by 55 +/- 10 mm Hg in the high-renin group (n = 11) and by 17 +/- 5 mm Hg in the normal-renin group (n = 6), whereas the smallest decrease (12 +/- 5 mm Hg) in systolic blood pressure occurred in the low-renin group (n = 5). In all the captopril-tested patients (n = 22), the decrease in systolic blood pressure by captopril was related to the control plasma renin activity (r = 0.75, p less than 0.001). These results indicate that the plasma renin activity value indicates the participation of the renin-angiotensin system in the maintenance of the elevated systolic blood pressure in patients with isolated systolic hypertension.", 
    "63": "Two dose levels of diltiazem with propranolol were compared in the management of chronic stable angina. Two groups of patients were treated for alternate periods of 4 weeks with each drug in a double-blind crossover with computer-assisted maximal treadmill tests and ambulatory ST-segment monitoring for evaluation of efficacy and safety. In 12 patients who received diltiazem, 180 mg/day, the time to development of angina increased from 5.9 +/- 0.7 minutes (+/- standard error of the mean) during placebo treatment to 8.3 +/- 0.8 minutes during diltiazem treatment and to 9.2 +/- 0.8 minutes with propranolol, 240 mg/day. Three patients became angina-free when they were treated with both drugs. Among 12 patients who received diltiazem, 360 mg/day, 1 patient became angina-free during treatment with both drugs and 1 became angina-free with diltiazem only. The mean exercise time increased from 5.8 +/- 0.7 minutes with placebo to 8.6 +/- 1.0 minutes with diltiazem, 360 mg/day, and to 8.2 +/- 0.6 minutes with propranolol, 240 mg/day. Analysis of variance showed no difference in efficacy between the 2 doses of diltiazem or between the 2 drugs. Ambulatory heart rate was reduced both during the day and at night with both drugs and significantly more with propranolol than with diltiazem treatment. Except for 1 patient in whom a rash developed when given diltiazem, 180 mg/day, and another who had both a rash and first-degree heart block with diltiazem, 360 mg/day, both drugs were well tolerated. Thus, diltiazem in a daily dose of 180 or 360 mg/day is as effective as propranolol for the treatment of chronic stable angina.", 
    "64": "Data from multiple sources indicate that the death rate for blacks is higher than for the general population-in part because of higher mortality from cardiovascular causes. The Cardiovascular Mortality Survey, carried out in Los Angeles, indicates that the combined effects of increased mortality from high blood pressure and related causes (e.g. stroke, cerebrovascular disease), together with an ischemic heart disease mortality rate that is only a little below the mean, accounts for the overall excess mortality rates in blacks. In addition, black patients have been shown to have higher risk profiles compared with the study mean in a large study of beta-blocker therapy, and a definite treatment effect was demonstrated. Further prospective studies of natural history and response to therapy are indicated for appropriately selected patient groups.", 
    "65": "Recent reports have confirmed that slow calcium channel inhibitors have useful antihypertensive properties because they produce dilatation of the peripheral arterioles without reflex tachycardia. Their clinical place in the management of hypertension has yet to be clearly defined, and thus we have performed an open crossover trial to compare the 24-hour profiles of blood pressure reduction after chronic therapy with propranolol and verapamil. Nineteen patients were studied by continuous ambulatory intraarterial recording and the order of drug administration was decided by random allocation. Drug dosage was twice daily and titrated according to casual clinic pressures (propranolol, 40 to 240 mg twice a day; verapamil, 120 to 240 mg twice a day). Mean hourly blood pressure and heart rate values were obtained over a 24-hour cycle, and the responses to isometric and dynamic exercise were also examined. Both drugs were shown to produce a uniform and comparable reduction in blood pressure throughout the whole day, together with a reduction in heart rate, which was greater with propranolol. Comparable effects were also seen on the pressor responses to exercise. Both drugs were equally well tolerated and caused no patient withdrawals. We conclude that oral verapamil given twice daily showed a similar degree of efficacy to propranolol and provided 24-hour blood pressure control. This slow calcium channel inhibitor may be useful as initial therapy for hypertension, particularly for those patients in whom beta-adrenoreceptor blockers are contraindicated.", 
    "66": "Acebutolol is a new investigational beta-antagonist which has intrinsic sympathomimetic and cardioselective properties. In this study its effects on the ischemic consequences following supine bicycle exercise were compared to those of propranolol in 16 patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease (CAD) using a double-blind placebo crossover protocol and equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography. In eight patients (group I), the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at peak exercise fell under control conditions. During chronic acebutolol therapy (400 mg thrice daily), the exercise-induced LVEF (means +/- 1 SD) was significantly higher (37.1 +/- 15.5% versus 42.2 +/- 14.3%; p less than 0.05). The corresponding values during placebo and during propranolol (80 mg thrice daily) were 39.2 +/- 12.3% versus 43.4 +/- 14.8% (p = 0.07). In eight patients (group II) in whom supine bicycle exercise produced increases in LVEF, both acebutolol (58.8 +/- 5.4% versus 53.8 +/- 4.4%) and propranolol (57.8 +/- 5.7% versus 54.1 +/- 4.9%) attenuated the increases. In neither group was the resting LVEF reduced by acebutolol or propranolol. The data show that acebutolol and propranolol are approximately equipotent in minimizing the radionuclide left ventriculographic manifestations of myocardial ischemia induced by supine bicycle exercise.", 
    "67": "The effects of alpha-methyl substitution of epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine were investigated at alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors in the pithed rat. alpha-Methyl substitution of these three phenethylamines variably altered their capacity to elicit alpha adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction, with slightly enhanced potency being observed for alpha-methyl substitution of norepinephrine and dopamine and a marked reduction in potency for alpha-methyl substitution of epinephrine. However, in all instances, alpha-methyl substitution resulted in a higher selectivity for alpha-2 adrenoceptors (over alpha-1 adrenoceptors). Thus, while epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine all produced vasoconstriction that was mediated equally by postsynaptic vascular alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors, their corresponding alpha-methyl-substituted derivatives produced vasoconstriction exclusively by activation of postsynaptic vascular alpha-2 adrenoceptors. The beta-1 adrenoceptor-mediated chronotropic effects of these phenethylamines were inconsistently affected by alpha-methyl substitution, with an increase in potency being observed for alpha-methyl substitution of norepinephrine and decreases in potency being observed for alpha-methyl substitution of epinephrine and dopamine. In marked contrast, alpha-methyl substitution of epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine was associated with consistent and dramatic increases in potency for beta-2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasodepressor activity. These results indicate that alpha-2 and beta-2 adrenoceptors possess the unique ability to recognize and/or accept alpha-methyl substituents on phenethylamines and that this ability is not shared by their respective receptor subtypes, the alpha-1 and beta-1 adrenoceptors. Furthermore, the results show that alpha-methylepinephrine is a potent beta adrenoceptor agonist, with an apparent 500-fold selectivity for beta-2 adrenoceptors over beta-1 adrenoceptors.", 
    "68": "Forty-one patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were randomly assigned to receive prophylactic timolol or placebo, given in a double-blind fashion. beta-Adrenoceptor-blocking therapy was stopped at least one half-life before surgery. Three to 7 hr after surgery (304 +/- 56 min), 0.5 mg of timolol or placebo was given intravenously twice daily in a double-blind manner. When oral medications were resumed postoperatively, 10 mg of timolol twice daily or placebo was continued orally. Continuous electrocardiograms were recorded for 24 hr before and for 7 days after surgery with a standard cassette recorder. No patient received digoxin. Both groups were comparable for frequency of preoperative supraventricular arrhythmias, left ventricular ejection fraction, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross-clamp time, number of bypass grafts, and total duration of monitoring. Analysis of arrhythmias was done by hand counts, and supraventricular arrhythmias were divided into supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation and/or flutter. Timolol decreased the frequency of supraventricular tachycardia (581 episodes placebo vs 84 timolol; p less than .05) and of atrial fibrillation and/or flutter (291 episodes placebo vs five timolol; p less than .05). Timolol decreased the number of patients with severe (heart rate greater than 200 beats/min, duration greater than 50 beats) episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (four placebo vs 0 timolol; p less than .05) and also decreased the number of episodes of severe (heart rate greater than 200 beats/min, duration greater than 5 min) atrial fibrillation and/or flutter (16 placebo vs one timolol; p less than .005). There were differences in the durations of supraventricular arrhythmias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "The interaction of halothane anesthesia and intravenous verapamil (0.15 mg/kg over 10 min) was investigated in eight patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery. All patients had a normal left ventricular (LV) function at rest and were on chronic beta-blocker therapy. Halothane produced a marked reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac index, and in LV contractility as documented by a decrease in LV peak positive dP/dt. Verapamil caused an additional depression (16%) of LV peak positive dP/dt accompanied by a small increase (3 mm Hg) in LV end-diastolic pressure. The combined negative inotropic propensities of halothane and verapamil did not produce any overt untoward effects even in the presence of chronic low dose beta-blocker therapy. The predominant hemodynamic effect of verapamil was a systemic vasodilation resulting in a further reduction in MAP (12%) while heart rate remained unaffected. Despite reducing myocardial oxygen demand, caution must be exercised in dose selection in each drug to avoid regional myocardial ischemia due to the combined hypotensive effects of halothane and verapamil."
