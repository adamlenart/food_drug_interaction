    "0": "The disposition of propranolol stereoisomers after administration of a single oral dose of the racemic drug was investigated in seven hyperthyroid patients before and after antithyroid drug therapy. The possibility of hypersensitivity to propranolol in the patients was evaluated by constructing plasma propranolol concentration -- beta-blocking effect curves. There was no statistically significant difference in elimination half-life (t1/2) between (+/-)- and (-)-propranolol before and after antithyroid drug therapy. However, the plasma clearance (Vp) of (-)-propranolol was smaller than that of (+/-)-propranolol, and the difference was statistically significant after antithyroid drug therapy. Vp decreased or did not change in young patients after therapy. No significant difference was observed in the relationship between the tilt-induced pulse rate response and plasma propranolol concentration when treated patients became euthyroid compared to their response in the hyperthyroid state.", 
    "1": "In vitro propranolol has a profound effect on erythrocytes as indicated by a decrease of the packed cell volume and a shift to the right of the oxygen dissociation curve. Because of the lack of satisfactory in vivo studies, the effect of 80 mg propranolol and placebo was compared in twelve volunteers in a double-blind study. Although plasma propranolol concentrations varied greatly from individual to individual, all propranolol subjects demonstrated effective beta-blockade. Packed cell volume, mean cellular volume, plasma trapping after haematocrit centrifugation, P 50, 2,3-DPG, ATP, erythrocyte filterability and blood viscosity at different packed cell volumes (50% and 80%) and shear rates (11.5, 23, 46, 115 and 230 s-1) did not change significantly following administration of either propranolol or placebo. These findings are of interest in view of the use of beta-blocking agents in critically ill patients.", 
    "2": "Five cases of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with coronary artery disease are reported; 2 males and 5 females, aged 27, 49, 64, 67, and 70 years respectively. Four patients had angina, the other being asymptomatic. The diagnosis of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy was based on the presence of at least 4 of the following 5 signs: an ejectional systolic murmur, an external carotid pulse tracing showing a second endsystolic peak, an echocardiogramme showing both systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and asymmetrical septal hypertrophy biloculation and/or disaxation of the left ventricular cavity on selective angiography, and a spontaneous or provoked intraventricular pressure gradient of over 30 mm Hg. Coronary angiography showed one or more stenoses of over 70% on at least one of the three main coronary arteries in all patients. Two of the 5 patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery without myomectomy; the remaining 3 patients were treated medically. All patients have been followed up for periods ranging from 8 months to 6 years (average: 4 years) with a favourable outcome in 4 of them who are currently asymptomatic; the other patient has moderate angina (non-operated, treated with propranolol). The frequency of the association of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease was initially underestimated, but in fact it does not appear to be uncommon. The association would seem to be fortuitous. The long-term prognosis is not known and the management is not codified. It would seem logical to propose simultaneous surgical correction of the two conditions by myomectomy and coronary bypass surgery when anatomically possible, when beta blocker therapy fails, despite a relatively high operative risk, according to the few published cases.", 
    "3": "We investigated the separate and combined effects of pharmacological and intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) support on regional myocardial blood flow in an experimental model of acute myocardial ischemia. Chloralose-anesthetized dogs were ventilated with an oxygen-air mixture, and cardiac output, arterial pressure, and heart rate were held constant. Treatment was begun 20 minutes following permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). We evaluated the following pharmacological interventions: 25% hypertonic mannitol, isosorbide dinitrate, methyl-prednisolone sodium succinate, and propranolol. We measured left ventricular hemodynamics and intramyocardial blood flow by the radioactive microsphere technique prior to treatment and at 15-minute intervals thereafter. Compared with control measurements 20 minutes following LAD ligation, collateral blood flow to ischemic myocardium tended to decrease with no treatment. Treatments with the four pharmacological interventions and with IABP alone produced no significant improvement in collateral blood flow to ischemic myocardium 15 minutes following treatment. In contrast, mannitol, isosorbide dinitrate, and propranolol, each combined with IABP support, produced significant improvements in collateral flow within the same time periods. In nonischemic myocardium, combined pharmacological and IABP treatment did not enhance myocardial blood flow above that obtained with the pharmacological agents alone. The most effective combination of mechanisms for improving the ischemic region's myocardial blood flow appeared to be a reduction of extravascular coronary flow resistance coupled with a simultaneous increase in diastolic arterial pressure.", 
    "4": "Local anesthetics such as dibucaine, QX572, tetracaine, and phenacaine, as well as other drugs with local anesthetic-like properties (e.g., mepacrine, propranolol, and SKF 525A) inhibit the specific calmodulin-dependent stimulation of erythrocyte Ca2+-ATPase (ATP phosphohydrolase, EC 3.6.1.3) and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (3',5'-cyclic-nucleotide 5'-nucleotidohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.17) from brain and heart. Basal activities of these enzymes in the absence of calmodulin are relatively unaffected by concentrations of local anesthetics that strongly inhibit the specific stimulation by calmodulin. Increasing calmodulin, but not Ca2+, overcomes the inhibitory action of the local anesthetics on brain phosphodiesterase. However, excess calmodulin does not fully restore activity of erythrocyte CA2+-stimulated ATPase. Although the mechanism(s) by which the local anesthetics act is unclear, they inhibit binding of 125I-labeled calmodulin to the erythrocyte membrane. Antagonism of calmodulin provides a molecular mechanism that may explain the inhibition of many Ca2+-dependent cellular processes by local anesthetics--e.g., Ca2+ transport, exocytosis, excitation-contraction coupling, non-muscle-cell motility, and aggregation.", 
    "5": "Target analysis of the turkey erythrocyte adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] system showed that the molecular weight of the ground state enzyme increases from 92,000 with MnATP as substrate and no stimulatory ligands to 226,000 when activated by fluoride ion or by 5'-guanyl imidodiphosphate (p[NH]ppG) subsequent to clearance of previously bound GDP. The identical increment in size (130,000) suggests that the same regulatory unit is involved in the activation by both effectors. When assayed with isoproterenol and p[NH]ppG, the enzyme system displayed a further increment in size of 90,000 daltons. Based on binding of the antagonist 125I-labeled hydroxybenzylpindolol, the beta-adrenergic receptor is about 90,000 daltons or the same as that seen for activation of the enzyme by isoproterenol through the beta-adrenergic-receptor. Because single targets were seen for the ground state enzyme system under all conditions, it would appear that the various regulatory and catalytic components are structurally linked prior to activation by hormone, guanine nucleotides, and fluoride ion. Furthermore, based on reported subunit sizes of the nucleotide regulatory and receptor components are composed of multiple subunits, either homologous or heterologous in structure.", 
    "6": "A chemically synthesized form of leukotriene E4 (LTE4) has been studied for its ability to induce contractions in isolated guinea pig ilea, to induce vascular permeability changes in rat skin when injected intradermally, and to induce bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs after intravenous injection. The synthetic compound induced a contraction in the guinea pig ileum which was slower in developing than that induced by histamine but faster in developing than that induced by a crude preparation of SRS-A isolated from guinea pig lung. The compound was 70-fold more active than histamine on the guinea pig ileum (EC50 of 5 x 10(-9) and 3.5 x 10(-7) M, respectively). FPL 55712, a known SRS-A antagonist, exhibited the same potency in blocking the contractions elicited by the synthetic material as it did in blocking contractions produced by guinea pig SRS-A generated biologically (IC50 of 3.5 x 10(-8) M). The synthetic LTE4 induced a dose dependent increase in vascular permeability in the rat skin which was antagonized by the intravenous injection of FPL 55712 (ID50 of 1.2 mg/kg). The synthetic material was also a potent bronchoconstrictor in the guinea pig when injected intravenously. The bronchoconstriction, too, was antagonized by FPL 55712 when injected intravenously (ID50 of 0.2 mg/kg). In both the rat and guinea pig, FPL 55712 exhibited a short duration of action in vivo. The in vivo model systems discussed in this study, utilizing the synthetic form of LTE4 should be useful in the future evaluation of other SRS-A antagonists.", 
    "7": "Exposure to chronic hypoxia results in a lower resting heart rate and a blunted cardiovascular responsiveness to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Possible effects of acclimatization to high altitude on the binding of [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol to beta-adrenergic receptors on membranes of right and left ventricles of rat heart were determined. Chronic high-altitude exposure led to a decrease in the density of beta-adrenergic receptors in nonhypertrophied left ventricles as well as in hypertrophied right ventricles. The affinity of the receptor for the radioligand was not changed by the exposure to high altitude, suggesting that the properties of the receptor were not affected. Basal and isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities were decreased in membranes prepared from hearts and pulmonary arteries of rats acclimatized to high altitude. The loss of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors in rats adapted to high altitude was prevented by the chronic coadministration of a low dose of DL-propranolol. The results suggest that changes in beta-adrenergic receptor density may partially explain the hemodynamic adaptation that occurs with chronic hypoxia. These decreases may be due to a loss of functional beta-adrenergic receptors caused by chronically elevated concentrations of circulating neurally released catecholamines.", 
    "8": "Although the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors have opposing effects on insulin secretion, the inhibitory influence of alpha-receptors appears to predominate. To determine if this was due to differences in number and affinity of receptors, isolated rat pancreatic islet cells were incubated with [3H]-dihydroalprenolol and [3H]-dihydroergocryptine as ligands for beta- and alpha-adrenergic binding sites. It was found that the number of beta-adrenergic binding sites was 143 fmol/mg islet protein with a Kd = 0.57 nM. The number of alpha-adrenergic binding sites was 53 fmol/mg protein with a Kd = 0.26 nM. Thus, there are 2.7 times as many beta-adrenergic binding sites as alpha-binding sites, and neither binding site number nor affinity is responsible for the predominant influence of the alpha-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "9": "A dynamic approach to evaluating reversible competitive antagonists has been used in estimating the dissociation constant (apparent KB) for (+/-)-sotalol at beta adrenergic receptors which mediate a positive chronotropic response in rat atria. Cumulative dose-response curves to the beta agonists (-)-isoproterenol and (-)-soterenol were obtained after mixing each agonist with (+/-)-sotalol at fixed ratios (Q = [antagonist]/[agonist]). Experimental and theoretical dose-response curves obtained with the dynamic approach were in good agreement and the lowered maximum responses to the agonist-antagonist mixtures were dependent on Q. Also, apparent KB values for (+/-)-sotalol determined by three methods were independent of Q and agonist employed in the experiment. Apparent KB values for (+/-)-sotalol obtained by the dynamic method (6 x 10(-7)-2 x 10(-6) M) were similar to those obtained by the traditional equilibrium or static approach. As judged by the similarity of the apparent KB values derived by the two independent theoretical models, the dynamic approach may be considered an effective and alternative means to evaluate reversible competitive antagonists.", 
    "10": "The purpose of this study was to determine if renin secretion resulting solely from low-frequency renal nerve stimulation (no change in renal blood flow or urinary sodium excretion) is mediated by activation of beta-1 (beta-1) or beta-2 (beta-2) adrenergic receptors. Beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptor blockade were produced with atenolol and butoxamine, respectively. Low-frequency renal nerve stimulation (0.5 Hz) increased renin secretion without altering mean arterial pressure, renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate or urinary sodium excretion. The increase in renin secretion in response to renal nerve stimulation was blocked by beta-1 blockade with intrarenal atenolol (2.0 micrograms/kg/min) infusion. This dose of atenolol reduced the renal vasodilator response to intrarenal isoproterenol by only 48%, thus indicating modest beta-2 receptor blockade. A lower dose of atenolol (30 micrograms/kg i.v.) markedly decreased the tachycardia in response to i.v. isoproterenol (2 micrograms) but had no effect on the renal vasodilator response to intrarenal isoproterenol injection (2 micrograms), thus indicating selective beta-1 blockade. This dose of atenolol abolished the increase in renin secretion during renal nerve stimulation. In contrast, beta-2 receptor blockade with butoxamine (20 micrograms/kg/min) did not alter the renin secretion response to renal nerve stimulation. This dose of butoxamine decreased the renal vasodilator response to intrarenal isoproterenol by 73%, thus demonstrating significant beta-2 receptor blockade. These results indicate the low-frequency renal nerve stimulation (0.5 Hz) increases renin secretion without altering renal hemodynamics or urinary sodium excretion. This neurally mediated renin secretion resulted from activation of beta-1 adrenergic receptors.", 
    "11": "Three types of adrenergic receptors, beta, alpha-1, and alpha-2, were identified in human adipocytes, isolated from properitoneal adipose tissue, using both the binding of radioactive ligands and the effects of adrenergic agents on receptor-specific biochemical responses. Adrenergic binding studies showed the following results: [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol binding (beta adrenergic) B(max) 280 fmol/mg protein, K(D) 0.38 nM; [(3)H]para-aminoclonidine binding (alpha-2 adrenergic) B(max) 166 fmol/mg protein, K(D) 0.49 nM; [(3)H]WB 4101 binding (alpha-1 adrenergic) B(max) 303 fmol/mg protein, K(D) 0.86 nM. In adipocytes from subcutaneous adipose tissue, [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine binding indicated the presence of alpha-2 but not alpha-1 receptors. Beta and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors appeared to be positively and negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase, respectively. Cells or cell membranes were incubated with epinephrine (10 muM) alone and in combination with the antagonists yohimbine (alpha-2) and prazosin (alpha-1). Epinephrine alone prompted a modest increase in adenylate cyclase activity, cyclic AMP, and glycerol release, an index of lipolysis. Yohimbine (0.1 muM) greatly enhanced these actions whereas prazosin was without effect. The beta agonist, isoproterenol, stimulated glycerol release, whereas the alpha-2 agonist, clonidine, inhibited lipolysis and cyclic AMP accumulation. To assess further alpha-1 receptors, cells were incubated with [(32)P]phosphate and epinephrine (10 muM) alone and in combination with prazosin and yohimbine. Epinephrine alone caused a three- to fourfold increase in (32)P incorporation into phosphatidylinositol. Prazosin (0.1 muM) blocked this action whereas yohimbine (0.1 muM) was without effect. Thus, in a homogeneous cell preparation, the human adipocyte appears to have three different adrenergic receptors, each of which is coupled to a distinct biochemical response.", 
    "12": "Previous studies from our laboratory indicated that both beta-adrenergic and cholinergic agents stimulate in vivo secretion by rat bronchiolar Clara cells. Those studies also provided support for an in-series beta-adrenergic-cholinergic stimulation of secretion. To further explore the regulation of secretion in Clara cells, and to do it in the absence of systemic influences, we have used the isolated ventilated perfused rat lung. We have again used morphometry and electron microscopy to assess secretion by measuring the volume density (fraction of cell volume) of the secretory granules of bronchiolar Clara cells. We found that in the isolated perfused lung, as in the intact animal, isoproterenol stimulated secretion in Clara cells and that this effect was blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Pilocarpine, unlike its action in the intact animal, did not stimulate secretion in the isolated lung; rather it inhibited the secretory effect of isoproterenol. Increased tidal-volume ventilation stimulated secretion; propranolol did not block this effect. Analogs of cyclic (c)AMP and of cGMP also stimulated secretion by Clara cells. These findings indicate that there are at least two mechanisms by which Clara cells can be stimulated to secrete. One seems to be beta-adrenergic-cAMP mediated but the triggering event is unknown. The other is initiated by increased tidal volume and cGMP may be involved in the intracellular mediation of this stimulatory event. Finally, we found evidence of beta-adrenergic (stimulatory) -cholinergic (inhibitory antagonism in the regulation of secretion in Clara cells.", 
    "13": "Adrenal steroid hormones potentiate beta-adrenergic actions on the heart. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of adrenalectomy on agonist and antagonist interactions with myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase. The affinity and number of beta-adrenergic receptor sites, both defined by the antagonist (-) [3H]dihydroalprenolol, did not change after adrenalectomy. Computer modelling of agonist (-)-isoproterenol competition curves indicated the presence of two discrete receptor states with high and low affinities. After adrenalectomy, the agonist curves were shifted to the right, and the dissociation constant of the high-affinity state significantly rose from 12 to 48 nM (p < .001), but the dissociation constant of the low affinity state was unchanged. Although basal, maximal isoproterenol-stimulated and fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities were unaltered, the EC50 for isoproterenol stimulation was increased significantly from 490 to 1500 nM (p <.018). These results suggest that adrenal steroid hormones may regulate the ability of the beta-adrenergic receptors to form a high-affinity \"coupled\" state, presumably by modulating the interaction of the receptor with nucleotide regulatory proteins.", 
    "14": "Techniques are described which make it possible to study beta-adrenergic receptors on intact neuroendocrine cells. Receptors were characterized on neonatal pinealocytes using the radioligand [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol ([125I]IHYP). Specific binding of [125I]IHYP, which is 4-fold greater than nonspecific binding, is concentration and temperature dependent, reversible, and saturable. [125I]IHYP binds noncooperatively (Kd = 35 pM), and Scatchard analysis indicates that only a single class of receptor sites for [125I]IHYP is present. Under the conditions used, it appears that there are about 12,000 +/- 1,100 sites/cell. Inhibition of specific [125I]IHYP binding by beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists is stereospecific, and the relative potency of agonists is characteristic of binding to beta-adrenergic receptors. Analysis of adrenergic stimulation of intracellular cAMP accumulation indicates that similar half-maximal concentrations of antagonists inhibit [125I]IHYP binding and adrenergically stimulated cAMP accumulation. In contrast, beta-adrenergic agonists are considerably more potent in stimulating cAMP than in inhibiting [125I]IHYP binding. Unexpected differences, not previously reportd, were found in the shapes of the cAMP accumulation dose-response curves of norepinephrine and isoproterenol. The relative potencies of these two agonists appear to be partially concentration dependent. This raises the possibility that there may be distinct differences in the intrinsic effects of these compounds on the regulation of intracellular cAMP accumulation in pinealocytes. (Endocrinology 108: 559, 1981)", 
    "15": "With the aid of an asphyxia model in rabbit fetuses the possibility of diaplacental influence on the hypoxic effects of the fetal organism has been investigated. The trial to change the vasotonia during the asphyctic shock by sympathicomimetic or -lytic drugs (Dilatol, Obsidan, Ergocomb, Regitin) remained to be without any effect on the DIC in the fetal organism. Trying to seal the vascular wall by the high-molecular-weight basic polypeptide Aprotinin there seemed rather to be an increase of the intravascular fibrin sedimentation.", 
    "16": "beta-Adrenergic regulation of exocrine protein secretion from the parotid gland was studied over the adult rat life span. Enzymatically dispersed cell aggregates were prepared from 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month-old rats and exocrine protein secretion (amylase release) measured. No age differences were seen in the time course of amylase release following (-)-isoproterenol stimulation or in the (-)-isoproterenol dose-response curve. the beta-adrenergic antagonist (+/-)-propanolol inhibited (-)-isoproterenol-stimulated protein secretion from parotid cell aggregates of young and old animals equally. Similarly dibutyryl cyclic AMP induced comparable rates of protein secretion from cells of different aged rats. Direct examination of beta-adrenergic receptor characteristics in parotid gland membranes from 3- to 24-month-old rats revealed no differences in the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) or maximum specific ligand binding capacity (receptor number). These results suggest that the rat parotid beta-adrenergic system remains functionally intact throughout the animals' lifetime.", 
    "17": "Nine physically active males were studied three times with four different exercise tests after administration of placebo, 0.1 g atenolol, or 0.08 g propranolol in random order. The test modals were: bicycle ergometer exercise at 50% of VO2max, peak torque during knee extension, the Wingate muscle power test, and 2000 m track running. Muscle fiber composition had previously been determined. In subjects with a high percentage of slow-twitch fibers the beta-blockers caused a more marked impairment in the exercising muscles. This effect was more pronounced with the unselective beta-blocker propranolol than with atenolol. One interpretation of our findings is that peripheral sympathetic beta 2-receptors in skeletal muscles may contribute to regulating muscle metabolism.", 
    "18": "Sufentanyl is a new, potent, short-acting, fentanyl-like morphinomimetic. In the present study we compared the effects of high doses of sufentanyl and morphine on the peripheral circulation in beta-blocked dogs. Skeletal muscle surface pH (m-pH) was recorded continuously as an index of the microcirculation. Sufentanyl (0.01 mg/kg) had no adverse effects on the peripheral perfusion. Morphine (4 mg/kg) caused a severe and rapid fall in m-pH from 7.34 to 7.14 during the 30-min experimental period. At the same time calculated blood volume decreased by 20%. This hypovolemic deterioration of the circulation was probably caused by a histamine-mediated increase in capillary pressure and filtration of plasma from the intravascular space to the interstitial space. As sufentanyl could be safely administered to beta-blocked dogs, we recommend human studies. On the other hand, we discourage the use of high-dose morphine anesthesia until human studies have proved that the collapse of the peripheral perfusion seen in this study is species specific.", 
    "19": "In conscious dogs, the selectivity and duration of beta-blocking activity, and serum concentration of a beta-blocking agent, D-32 [dl-1-tert-butylamino-3-(2,3-dimethylphenoxy)-2-propanol hydrochloride] was compared to that of propranolol, pindolol, atenolol and IPS-339 [dl-1-tert-butylamino-3-(-9-fluorenylideneaminoxy)-2-propanol hydrochloride]. Ratios of doses causing a 50% inhibition of tachycardia to that on hypotension induced by isoprenaline were as follows: D-32 (0.69), propranolol (0.67), atenolol (0.03) and IPS-339 (6.3). Thus, present experiments indicate that, unlike atenolol and IPS-339, D-32, propranolol and pindolol are non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. Atenolol and IPS-339, however, selectively blocked cardiac beta1, receptors and vascular beta2-receptors respectively, as would be expected. In an optimal dose range these two drugs can be used satisfactorily as a pharmacological tool for inhibiting responses mediated via the respective beta-receptors. After oral administration, the pharmacological half-life (time required for 50% recovery of beta-blocking action) was 15.8 +/- 4.5 h for propranolol (3 mg/kg), 21.8 +/- 6.4 h for D-32 (0.5 mg/kg), 30.5 +/- 3.1 h for atenolol (6 mg/kg) and 30-35 h for pindolol (0.2 mg/kg). The pharmacological half-life after i.v. administration was 4.4 +/- 0.7 h for propranolol (300 microgram/kg) and 5.9 +/- 0.4 h for D-32 (150 microgram/kg), whereas the serum half-like (time required for 50% decrease in serum concentration) of propranolol was 1.4 h and that of D-32 was 1.3 h. The values for pharmacological half-life and serum half-life were significantly different. Thus, for determination of administration frequency and dosage of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, not only pharmacokinetic but also pharmacological data (duration of action) are essential.", 
    "20": "Some 1-(naphtho[2,1-b]furan-2-yl)-2-(t-butylamino)ethanols were synthesized for possible beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. The compounds may be considered to be derived from naphthyloxypropanolamines, the side chain of which is partially included in a furan ring. The pharmacological profile of 1-(naphtho[2,1-b]furan-2-yl)-2-(t-butylamine)ethanol (I b) is quite similar to that of propranolol without cardiac depressant properties.", 
    "21": "The beta-adrenergic receptors in human adipose membranes were identified by the specific and saturable binding of the beta-adrenergic antagonist (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol. The total number of sites in control membranes was 0.32 +/- 0.03 pmol/mg protein and the equilibrium dissociation constant for binding (Kd) was 2.6 nM and 2.5 nM as determined by Scatchard analysis of experiments on equilibrium binding and kinetics, respectively. The beta 1-adrenergic nature of the receptors was derived from the order of potencies of beta-adrenergic agonists (isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine greater than epinephrine) to complete with (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol for binding. Studies of saturation binding, kinetics and competition binding revealed the presence of a single class of beta 1-adrenergic receptors. Prolonged incubation of human adipose cells in the presence of (--)-norepinephrine decreases the lipolytic response to beta-adrenergic agonists, and reduces by 50% the concentration of beta-adrenergic receptors. The Kd values for (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol and the beta-adrenergic agonists remain unchanged. Catecholamines also produce a rapid conformational change of approximatively 50% of the receptors in control membranes as revealed by their increased sensitivity towards inactivation by the alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide. This inactivation process is not observed in desensitized membranes, which indicates that desensitization and inactivation by agonists plus N-ethylmaleimide affect the same receptor population. The beta 1-adrenergic receptors in human adipocytes can thus be divided into two subpopulations on the basis of the different consequences of their interaction wtih agonist molecules.", 
    "22": "1 Observations were made in five subjects who exercised before and at 2, 3, 6, 8, 24, 33 and 48 h after the oral administration of placebo and 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg betaxolol. 2 The exercise heart rate remained constant at all times after the placebo. All doses of betaxolol significantly reduced the exercise tachycardia at all times. The maximum effect (34.4 +/- 2.2%) occurred after 40 mg. 3 There was a small decline in effect from the peak to 24 h when 40 mg produced a 23.3 +/- 2.7% reduction and a further decline to 48 h when there was a 14.6 +/- 1.8% reduction. 4 Plasma levels of betaxolol were measured in these studies. The peak plasma concentration occurred between 3 and 8 h with different doses. The plasma elimination half-lives after 10, 20 and 40 mg were 11.4 +/- 2.5, 15.9 +/- 4.9 and 15.1 +/- 3.1 h. 5 The effects of 40 mg betaxolol, 200 mg atenolol, 160 mg propranolol, 160 mg oxprenolol, 400 mg sotalol and placebo on an exercise tachycardia were compared in five subjects who received all treatments in random order. 6 There was no significant difference in the maximum reduction produced in an exercise tachycardia by the different drugs. 7 The effect of all drugs decreased with time. The effect of oxprenolol had worn off at 24 h but at 48 h only atenolol and betaxolol produced significant reductions in the exercise tachycardia. 8 Plasma concentrations of the different drugs were measured and plasma elimination half-lives determined. The half-life for betaxolol was 24.5 h which was longer than that for any of the other drugs. 9 These observations show that betaxolol is a potent beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with a long duration of effect on an exercise tachycardia and a long plasma elimination half-life.", 
    "23": "Bilateral electrodermal orienting responses were measured to repeated auditory stimuli in schizophrenic patients and controls. In 3 studies phasic activity to moderate intensity sounds of patients on no drugs or phenothiazines was predominantly hyper- or hypo-responsive. Controls showed moderate or slow habituation. Propranolol was found to facilitate habituation in slow habituators and to reinstate responses in half of non-responders, especially when given as the sole drug. The effects seldom had a counterpart in changes in non-specific responses or levels of skin conductance. Modulatory influences on stimulus and response processing and on lateral asymmetries in responses may underlie propranolol's efficacy in treating schizophrenia.", 
    "24": "Seventy-three hypertensive patients were evaluated with M mode and two dimensional echocardiography. Left ventricular hypertrophy was found in 37 patients (51 percent); 29 had concentric hypertrophy and the remaining 8 had disproportionate septal thickening. Factors that did not influence the distribution of patients in the group with left ventricular hypertrophy and normal subjects included (1) duration of hypertension, (2) level of blood pressure, (3) age, (4) body surface area, and (5) race. More of the patients who had a normal left ventricular mass (32 or 89 percent) than of those who had hypertrophy (22 or 59 percent) were receiving two or more antihypertensive drugs. Electrocardiography was very insensitive in identifying left ventricular hypertrophy in these patients. The presence of increased left ventricular mass was associated with a greater incidence of other target organ disease.", 
    "25": "In rat anococcygeus muscle, dobutamine produced concentration-related submaximal contractions which were antagonized competitively by phentolamine (pKB = 8.3) and dobutamine antagonized norepinephrine-induced contractions in a competitive manner with an equilibrium dissociation constant for the alpha adrenoceptor of 20 nM (pKB = 7.7). Therefore, dobutamine satisfied criteria for a partial agonist of alpha adrenoceptors having an affinity for alpha adrenoceptors 25 times that of norepinephrine (pKA = 6.3) in this tissue. An estimate of the relative efficacy of dobutamine showed one-fortieth the the efficacy of norepinephrine at the alpha adrenoceptors. Dobutamine contracted rabbit aorta and produced concentration-related relaxations at 1000 times greater concentrations after alkylation of alpha adrenoceptors by phenoxybenzamine. In noncontracted canine saphenous vein, dobutamine had no visible agonist activity but did produce contractions after propranolol. In partially contracted saphenous vein, dobutamine produced a small contraction which was converted to a propranolol-sensitive relaxation of tone after phentolamine. Dobutamine was a full beta adrenoceptor agonist in guinea-pig trachea under spontaneous tone but a partial agonist after strong contraction by bethanechol. This allowed measurement of the pKB of dobutamine at beta adrenoceptors (pKB = 5.35) and estimation of efficacy at beta adrenoceptors relative to isoproterenol (eDob/eIso = 1/20). No evidence for beta adrenoceptor selectivity was found in studies of potency ratios and relative efficacy using isoproterenol for comparison. Dobutamine showed a slight (2-fold) selectivity for inotropy in vitro when compared to isoproterenol in guinea-pig right and left atria. This selectivity was removed by phentolamine suggesting a cardiac alpha-like adrenoceptor effect; this finding was confirmed in propranolol-treated guinea-pig left atria. These results are discussed in terms of the in vivo effects of dobutamine and its use as a tool for classification of beta adrenoceptors, particularly the putative presynaptic beta adrenoceptor.", 
    "26": "Left circumflex coronary blood flow (CBF) was measured in eight mongrel dogs with 8 MHz continuous wave Doppler flow transducers during classical aversive conditioning. The cardiovascular condition response consisted of significant (P less than 0.01) increases in: (1) mean aortic pressure (16.1%), (2) d(left ventricular pressure)/dt (64.2%), and (3) heart rate (63.2%). The coronary vascular response to behavioral stress consisted of an initial late diastolic decrease in CBF (12.5%) between 5 and 10 seconds after conditional stimulus onset, followed by a significant increase in CBF (96.8%). Concurrently, late diastolic coronary vascular resistance (CVR) first significantly increased (21.9%), then significantly decreased (39.8%). The increase in CVR was attenuated by cardiac pacing and converted into a significant decrease after alpha-receptor blockade. The decrease in CVR was reduced either by cardiac pacing or cardioselective beta-receptor blockage and eliminated by the combination of alpha- and beta-receptor blockade. Thus, these data indicate that the coronary vascular response to stress consisted of two components: an initial alpha-adrenergic coronary vasoconstriction, followed by a more complex vasodilation which was probably mediated by metabolites released secondarily to increases in heart rate and inotropic state.", 
    "27": "We studied the effects of intravenous infusion of angiotensin II on the circulation of the fetus in lambs in utero through chronically maintained intravascular catheters. Angiotensin II infused in doses of 29-280 ng/min per kg fetal weight resulted in an increase in plasma angiotensin II from a control value of 87 +/- 17 to 341 +/- 129 (mean +/- SE) pg/ml; these levels are similar to those observed following hemorrhage in fetal lambs. Fetal mean arterial blood pressure increased from 46 +/- 2.0 to 56 +/- 2.7 torr and fetal heart rate increased from 172 +/- 6 to 189 +/- 6 beats/min, an effect which was not altered by beta-adrenergic or cholinergic blockade. Fetal cardiac output and its distribution were measured before and during infusion of angiotensin II by the radionuclide-labeled microsphere technique. Combined ventricular output increased significantly from 526 +/- 32 to 616 +/- 24 ml/min per kg fetal body weight. Angiotensin constricted the umbilical-placental circulation as well as the gastrointestinal, renal, and thyroidal vascular beds. Angiotensin increased blood flow to the myocardium and markedly increased blood flow to the pulmonary circulation. These studies indicate that angiotensin II, at the plasma levels achieved with moderate hemorrhage, has marked influences on the circulation. The renin-angiotensin system may be important in the fetal response to stress.", 
    "28": "The effects of aminophylline, 1 mg/kg/min infused intravenously for 10 minutes, were examined on left ventricular (LV) diameter, pressure, an indexes of myocardial contractility, as well as systemic, coronary and regional hemodynamics in conscious dogs. Aminophylline increased mean arterial pressure 12 +/- 2%, LV systolic pressure 8 +/- 1%, LV dP/dt 20 +/- 2%, velocity of myocardial fiber shortening 13 +/- 2% and heart rate 5 +/- 2%, and reduced LV end-diastolic diameter 2 +/- 0.5%. Vascular resistance rose in the systemic bed 13 +/- 5%, the coronary bed 26 +/- 3%, the mesenteric bed 26 +/- 5% and the iliac bed 36 +/- 4%, but did not rise in the renal bed. Both beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol and chronic treatment with reserpine attentuated but did not abolish the positive inotropic response induced by aminophylline. Alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade with phentolamine prevented aminophylline-induced vasoconstriction in the systemic, coronary, mesenteric and iliac beds. In contrast to the vasoconstriction with i.v. aminophylline, when the drug was infused directly into the iliac artery, it elicited marked iliac vasodilation. Thus, in the intact conscious dog, i.v. aminophylline, in a dose that had little effect on heart rate, increased LV contractility and reduced preload. The increase in contractility was dependent in part on intact beta-adrenergic nervous activity and endogenous catecholamine stores. The increase in systemic, coronary, iliac and mesenteric resistances involved alpha-adrenergic mechanisms. These actions appear to involve autonomic mechanisms, because the only direct effect of aminophylline on the iliac artery was marked vasodilation.", 
    "29": "Exposure to cold (4 degrees C) of catheterized rats acclimated to 20 degrees C resulted in a progressive increase in plasma noradrenaline (NA) concentrations which reached values consistently more than twice the basal ones (20 degrees C) by about 30 min. No further increase in plasma NA levels were detected when the cold exposure was continued for 24 h. Plasma adrenaline (A) and dopamine levels did not change at any time studied. Adrenalectomized rats exposed to cold exhibited percent rises in plasma NA similar to those in intact rats. An increase in plasma A levels concomitant with that of NA was observed following exposure to cold of rats in which either basal catecholamine release was impaired by chlorisondamine or the vasoconstrictor response was impeded by phentolamine. Propranolol did not modify the acute neurosympathetic response to cold. Exposure to cold (4 degrees C) for short periods of time combined with the measurement of plasma catecholamines is proposed as a useful and reproducible method for studying a pure neurosympathetic response in the rat.", 
    "30": "A 14-year-old boy who ingested 8000 mg of propranolol developed sudden onset of arrhythmias, cardiac failure and convulsions. He responded to ventilator support, transvenous pacing, and massive dosage of isoprenaline. The clinical features and management of propranolol overdosage are outlined.", 
    "31": "A report is given on seven patients with Prinzmetal's variant angina. Rest angina occurred in all patients. In contrast, exertional angina was observed only on patients with significant (greater than 70%) coronary stenosis. Likewise, electrocardiographic changes (negative T) were only demonstrable in patients with severe coronary obstruction. The coronary angiogram was normal in one patient, demonstrated insignificant lesions in two and significant stenosis in four cases. In patients with insignificant coronary lesions obstructive coronary spasm was provoked by ergonovine maleate and this group responded well to a combination of nifedipine and isosorbide dinitrate therapy. The patients with significant coronary stenosis were free from pain after coronary bypass surgery; one of these suffered a perioperative anterior myocardial infarction. On the basis of these observations promising therapy is possible if the coronary morphology is known.", 
    "32": "Using (-)-[3H]-dihydroalprenolol ([3H]-DHA) and [3H]-norepinephrine ([3H]-NE) as probes, adrenoreceptors in mouse and rabbit adipocyte plasma membranes were studied and compared. The binding of either radioligand can be displaced by propranolol, alprenolol, isoproterenol or norepinephrine. [3H]-Norepinephrine bound to rabbit plasma membrane can be displaced by phentolamine. Based on displacement of radioligand by unlabelled stereoisomers, the binding is stereospecific for the (-) stereoisomer. Quantitative binding determinations of catecholamine radioligand as well as competitive inhibitory and displacement studies with Scatchard plots where appropriate, allowed calculation of binding parameters including Bmax and Kd for both radioligands and for the compounds listed above. Kinetics of displacement were also followed. Based on these binding parameters and kinetics, together with the activity of hormone and NaF sensitive adenylate cyclase, we conclude that both the population of beta-adrenoreceptor and its coupling efficiency for adenylate cyclase of the rabbit plasma membrane appear to be low as compared to that of mouse and rat.", 
    "33": "Hormone stimulated lipolysis of mouse and rabbit adipocytes as measured by both free fatty acid and glycerol release, is proportionally elevated with increase in the adipocyte cAMP level up to 1 nmol/g. The correlation coefficients are 0.94 and 0.97 for FFA/cAMP and glycerol/cAMP respectively. Increments in cAMP greater than 1 nmol/g show no correlation with increase in lipolysis. The release of lipolytic products, glycerol and free fatty acids, from white adipocytes in response to ACTH, epinephrine or norepinephrine was measured using radiochemical assays in short term incubation systems, with cAMP levels measured at the same time and from the same cell sample. Under the conditions studied, epinephrine is a more effective lipolytic hormone than ACTh in mouse adipocyte, and ACTH is more effective than epinephrine in rabbit adipocyte. The effect of catecholamines on the rabbit adipocyte is not modified by phentolamine (10 microM), but it is potentiated by 1-methyl-3-isobutyl xanthine (0.1 mM). The results suggest that cAMP mediates the action of these lipolytic hormones in white adipocytes of mouse and rabbit.", 
    "34": "A review of the different drugs used for the treatment of children's hypertension is done: diuretics, vasodilators and drug acting on nervous sympathetic system. The treatment of acute hypertension is described. According to personal experience based on 33 cases, a proposition of treatment of secondary chronic hypertension is presented. Then the medical cares and the follow up of the children's primary hypertension are discussed.", 
    "35": "Primidone given to a patient for epilepsy produced an unexpected reduction in benign familial tremor. Over the next eight years the drug was therefore tried in a prospective study of 20 other patients with benign familial tremor alone. Of these, six could not tolerate the drug because of vertigo and nausea but 12 obtained a good response, which in some cases was dramatic. Investigations in two patients suggested that the effect was mediated predominantly by derived phenylethylmalonamide, though primidone had some effect, since tremor recurred slightly on withdrawing the drug despite a constant or rising blood phenylethylmalonamide concentration. Primidone is highly effective in benign familial tremor. More patients with the condition are intolerant of the drug than are usually found with epilepsy.", 
    "36": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the separation of optical isomers (enantiomers) of amines is described. It is based on ion-pair chromatography with a chiral counter ion in a system with an organic mobile phase and an adsorbing stationary phase. The method has been applied to enantiomers of 1-aryloxy-3-isopropylamine-2-propanol derivatives (alprenolol, metoprolol, propranolol) which are completely resolved with (+)-10-camphorsulphonate as the counter ion. Studies of the influence of the counter-ion structure and the mobile phase composition are presented.", 
    "37": "Quantitative gas--liquid chromatographic (GLC) and GLC--mass spectrometric (MS) methods for the determination of Tobanum, a new beta-blocking agent, in human plasma have been developed. After solvent extraction, a bis-trifluoroacetyl derivative is formed which is measured by an electron-capture detector. The quantitation is controlled by using an internal standard, propranolol hydrochloride, which is added to all samples. The electron-capture detector response is linear in the concentration range used, 5--150 ng/ml. The identity and quantity of the GLC peaks is confirmed by GLC--MS. The minimum detectable concentration of Tobanum is 1 ng using 3-ml plasma samples.", 
    "38": "The systemic depressor reflex in cats evoked by inflation of an intrasinusal balloon is enhanced by stimulation of the superior cervical ganglion and by close infusion of 20 micrograms/ml/min of (d, l)propranolol.", 
    "39": "The purpose of this study is to define the hormonal regulation of pulmonary surfactant secretion in two models, the isolated perfused rat lung and the isolated alveolar type II cell in culture. In the perfused lung, both cholinergic and adrenergic stimulation independently increased labeled disaturated phosphatidylcholine secretion, the major phospholipid component of surfactant, each by 2.3-fold. A concomitant increase in lung cGMP and cAMP concentration of 275- and 25-fold, respectively, was observed. The effect of each agonist was inhibited only by its appropriate antagonist. In alveolar type II cells in culture, both adenylate and guanylate cyclase responded to their appropriate agonists and antagonists. The release of 3H-labeled disaturated phosphatidylcholine was enhanced by beta-adrenergic but not alpha-adrenergic or cholinergic agonists. The effect of isoproterenol (10 microM) on surfactant release was seen by 2.5 min, and secretion was stimulated 2.9-fold at a half-maximal concentration of 1 nM. Cyclic AMP levels were increased by 4.9-fold by isoproterenol at a half-maximal concentration of 40 nM. These results indicate that while in the perfused lung, secretion is stimulated by both adrenergic and cholinergic effectors, in the type II cell model, surfactant secretion is under only beta-adrenergic control.", 
    "40": "The effects of chagasic sera, containing an antibody (EVI antibody) which reacts with the plasma membrane of working myocardial cells, on \"toxic\" and \"non-toxic\" actions of ouabain upon isolated self beating or paced rat atria suspended in different media, were explored. Although ouabain produced a dose-dependent positive inotropic influence on atria suspended in Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate (KRB) and in KRB plus normal human serum (KRB + NHS) it did not elicit any significant positive inotropic effect on atria beating in KRB plus EVI positive human chagasic serum (EVI(+)S). Additionally, EVI(+)S dose-response curves of classical signs of digitalis cardiac toxicity shifted to the left. The threshold concentration of ouabain required to elicit the onset of \"toxic\" effects was higher in control preparations (kept in KRB or KRB + NHS) than in EVI(+)S exposed preparations. (-)-Propranolol attenuated the overall toxic action of ouabain in EVI(+)S and facilitated its positive inotropic influence. In control media, the beta-adrenoceptor blocker failed to modify either the \"non-toxic\" or the \"toxic\" effect of ouabain. On the other hand, with control atria, subthreshold exogenous norepinephrine inhibited the positive inotropism of ouabain. The data suggest that an adrenergic mechanism is involved in the action of ouabain on cardiac tissue immersed in an EVI(+)S-containing solution. The foregoing results may explain the severe \"toxic\" effects observed with cardioactive glycosides when they are used in patients with Chagas' heart disease, even at low doses.", 
    "41": "Various sigmoid lesions, seen on barium enema of 39 patients, were investigated with angiography of the inferior mesenteric artery using three series. The first was performed with contrast medium only, the second after use of epinephrine, and the third after a beta-blocking agent (propranolol) combined with epinephrine. The patients were followed for more than three years. Eleven carcinomas were detected, all diagnosed angiographically. Carcinoma, radiation fibrosis, and diverticulitis with fibrosis may appear similar on pharmacoangiography, but the inflammatory reaction seen, for example in diverticulitis, is different. These findings are important because they can have an influence on the indications and selection of the most suitable operation to be performed.", 
    "42": "A trial of propranolol for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms was conducted among 37 menopausal women in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover fashion. When compared with placebo, propranolol had a statistically significant effect on the reduction of both the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms (P less than 0.01). In selected patients, propranolol may be an alternative to the treatment of vasomotor symptoms with exogenous estrogens.", 
    "43": "The pharmacokinetics of atenolol were determined following acute intravenous and chronic oral administration to 20 subjects with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between 5 and 113 ml/min. Plasma levels in a further 5 patients on haemodialysis were measured after intravenous treatment. The mean half life of elimination increased from 5.9 h in patients with normal renal function to 42.1 h in preuraemic patients (GFR less than 10 ml/min) following a single i.v. dose. The half life of elimination following chronic oral administration was not significantly different. Mean peak plasma concentrations increased from 540 ng/ml in patients with normal renal function to 1493 ng/ml in preuraemic patients following chronic oral treatment with 100 mg/day. The mean half life of elimination during a single haemodialysis treatment was 4.3 h. In patients with a GFR greater than 10 ml/min the normal daily dose of atenolol should be employed, in patients with a GFR between 10 and 30 ml/min the dose should be reduced by half, and in patients with a GFR less than 30 ml/min a reduction by three quarters of the normal dose is recommended.", 
    "44": "A series of studies was performed in unanesthetized dogs to ascertain whether, in addition to cholinergic pathways, other neurotransmitter systems were involved in the GH-releasing effect of the potent enkephalin analog [D-Ala2, MePhe4, Met(o)5-ol]enkephalin (DAMME). DAMME at a dose of 8 microgram/kg iv elicited a striking rise in plasma canine GH (cGH), with peak levels at 30 min. Blockade of histaminergic H1 receptors by diphenhydramine (30 mg,iv, 15 min before) or clemastine (1 mg orally three times for 2 days and 2 mg orally 60 min before) completely suppressed the cGH release induced by DAMME without significantly altering baseline cGH levels. A slight reduction of the effect of DAMME was also induced by the histamine H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine (300 mg, iv, 15 min before). Pretreatment with the alpha-adrenergic inhibitor phentolamine (0.4 mg/min for 45 min) did not alter the neuroendocrine effect of DAMME, despite the occurrence of a rise in blood glucose (peak levels, 185 +/- 47 mg/dl). The administration of propranolol, a blocker of beta-receptors, did not potentiate the cGH release induced by a threshold dose of DAMME (4 microgram/kg, iv). An iv bolus injection of glucose (1 g/kg), which induced peak glucose levels of 296 +/- 29 mg/dl, completely suppressed the cGH release induced by DAMME or propranolol plus DAMME. These results indicate that histaminergic H1 receptors play an important role in the cGH release induced by DAMME, whereas this action occurs independently from adrenergic mediation. Based on these and previous findings, a neuromodulator role in GH-releasing mechanisms is suggested for opioid peptides.", 
    "45": "Chickens have been reported to have a rate of posthemorrhagic fluid mobilization twice that of mammals and lack a phase of shock irreversible to transfusion. In the present study we measured several hemodynamic and hematologic parameters in chickens subjected to sustained hemorrhagic hypotension. Total peripheral resistance was unaffected or fell slightly and skeletal muscle vascular resistance judged from changes in gastrocnemius resistance was not affected by hemorrhage. Blood compositional changes included a progressive hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia, and hemodilution as evidenced by linear falls in hematocrit, hemoglobin, and plasma total protein concentration. Plasma sodium and osmolality were unchanged, as were arterial pH and oxygen tension; however, there was a fall in carbon dioxide tension. These studies demonstrate that fluid mobilization in the chicken after hemorrhage does not require an increase in precapillary resistance and suggest that, because the chicken does not exhibit intense precapillary constriction, it is spared some of the deleterious effects of inadequate tissue perfusion. Thus, the findings tend to incriminate the peripheral action of the sympathetic nervous system as a major contributor to the development of irreversibility in other species.", 
    "46": "The effects of alpha and beta adrenergic agonists and antagonists on isolated smooth muscle preparations from the rabbit bladder body, bladder base and proximal urethra have been studied. The predominance of alpha receptors in the proximal urethra and the bladder base was observed via contraction of these areas by norepinephrine and blockade by phentolamine. Alpha receptor-mediated contractile activity could be unmasked in the bladder body when beta receptors were blocked with propranolol. Isoproterenol, 1 X 10(-10) to 3 X 10(-7) M, had a strong, dose-related relaxant effect on the bladder body, but little effect on the bladder base or proximal urethra. Selective beta-2 agonists such as terbutaline, salbutamol and ritodrine elicited tissue responses similar to those of isoproterenol. The pD2 values for isoproterenol, terbutaline, salbutamol and ritodrine were 8.59, 7.87, 7.34, and 6.52, respectively. Dobutamine, a selective beta-1 agonist, failed to cause significant relaxation of these tissues. The nonselective beta receptor blocker, propranolol, and the selective beta-2 receptor blocker, butoxamine, competitively antagonized the relaxant effects of the four active beta agonists; however, atenolol, a selective beta-1 receptor blocker, was inactive. On the basis of the selective action of these agonists and antagonists, we concluded that beta-2 receptors mediate relaxation of the vesicourethral smooth muscles of the rabbit and the participation of beta-1 receptors in the areas is insignificant.", 
    "47": "The present experiments were designed to measure and characterize direct hemodynamic effects of propranolol on vascularly isolated carotid sinuses. dl-Propranolol, when restricted to the isolated carotid sinuses, inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the reflex increases in heart rate and mean arterial pressure during carotid sinus hypotension. When perfused through isolated sinuses at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml, the drug totally abolished reflex changes to carotid sinus hypotension. Perfusion of the sinuses with d-propranolol or procaine at the same doses also totally inhibited the response. On the other hand, perfusion of the sinuses with sotalol, an adrenergic blocker without membrane stabilizing effects, did not alter resting levels of arterial pressure or heart rate and did not affect reflex changes during sinus hypotension. These results suggest that propranolol at high doses may affect baroreceptor afferents and inhibit the baroreceptor reflex through membrane-stabilizing and local anesthetic properties rather than through hypothesized beta receptors. It seems unlikely that these pathways contribute to the antihypertensive actions of the drug.", 
    "48": "The ability of cholinergic and adrenergic agonists to initiate protein secretion by in vitro slices of rabbit lacrimal gland was examined. The adrenergic response was not inhibited by atropine but was partially inhibited by propranolol and phentolamine. This indicates the presence of both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors and their association with the protein secretory response. The cholinergic response was inhibited completely by the muscarinic antagonist atropine. Additionally, the adrenergic antagonists, propranolol and phentolamine, inhibited approximately 70% and 40%, respectively, of the cholinergic response. Dose-response curves obtained for carbachol and isoproterenol indicated that the maximum response to carbachol is greater than that to isoproterenol but that the threshold for response to isoproterenol is much lower than that to carbachol. Additionally, carbachol and isoproterenol acted synergistically in promoting protein secretion. A hypothesis for the regulation of lacrimal gland function is proposed which takes into account the autonomic effects on electrolyte transport and tear flow rates reported by others as well as autonomic control of protein secretion reported in this paper.", 
    "49": "Pericardial effusions are occasionally observed in patients treated with the new oral vasodilator, minoxidil. Almost all of these cases are related to severe renal or congestive heart failure, but very rarely can be observed in patients without an identifiable cause. Such a case is reported herein, in which extensive investigation failed to reveal the cause. On further observation, the effusion subsided despite continuation of minoxidil therapy. Review of the literature suggests that pericardial effusion is uncommonly observed in patients treated with minoxidil unless accompanied by renal or cardiac failure, and that discontinuation of minoxidil therapy is not always indicated.", 
    "50": "Hypertension may be considered a disorder of increased energy in the blood, with two components: increased pressure energy may promote arteriolar disease, whereas arterial diseases such as atherosclerosis may be more closely related to flow disturbances (turbulence, boundary layer separation, high shear, or axial stream impingement) due to increased kinetic energy. Previous studies have shown that hydralazine aggravates turbulence in stenosed carotid arteries, whereas propranolol diminishes turbulence. To assess the effect of these drugs on the progression of atherosclerosis, the drugs were administered subcutaneously to rabbits made hypertensive (one kidney Goldblatt) and hypercholesterolemic (1% cholesterol diet for 4 weeks). Appropriate controls with normal, only hypertensive and hypertensive-hypercholesterolemic untreated rabbits were employed. A total of 36 rabbits was used. The extent of the aortic surface involvement with atherosclerotic lesions was assessed by morphometric analysis of magnified photographs. Although the extent or surface involvement did not differ significantly between the untreated or treated hypertensive rabbits, there was an interesting difference in the relationship between blood pressure and extent of surface involvement. In the untreated and hydralazine treated rabbits, there was a direct correlation between increasing blood pressure and extent of lesions; in the propranolol treated group, this relationship was abolished.", 
    "51": "The long-term antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a fixed combination of oxprenolol 160 mg slow-release + chlortalidone 20 mg was studied in 40 out-patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension followed during one year with monthly clinical visits. The fixed combination was given at the dosage of 1 tablet once daily, in the morning, increasing to 1 tablet b.i.d. in case of lying diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mmHg. After one year only 9 patients were on 1 tablet b.i.d., the others remaining on 1 tablet once daily regimen. Clear-cut antihypertensive effect was already evident after the 1st month of treatment. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure further decreased after two months (p less than 0.01) showing then a constant trend to decrease till the 6th month; afterwards blood pressure values remained unchanged. Normalization of blood pressure was obtained in 63%, 73% and 80% of the patients, respectively after 1, 6 and 12 months of treatment. Laboratory data did not show significant changes. Only 3 patients complained of unwanted effects which were mild, transient and in no case compelled to interrupt the treatment. Results confirm that the fixed combination of oxprenolol 160 mg slow-release + chlorthalidone 20 mg is able to long term control mild to moderate hypertension with a good tolerability, thus allowing an improved patient compliance."
