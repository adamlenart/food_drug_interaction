    "0": "1. The phospholipid composition of fat-cells prepared from rat epididymal fat-pad was determined. 2. The incorporation of [(32)P]P(i) into the phospholipids of fat-cells incubated in glucose-free medium and the effect of adrenaline and of alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agents, were studied. 3. Incorporation of [(32)P]P(i) into fat-cell phospholipid increased with time; incubation with adrenaline resulted in increased incorporation that was related to the concentration of adrenaline. 4. The pattern of incorporation of [(32)P]P(i) into the individual phospholipids of fat-cells after incubation for 1h was determined; adrenaline (5.4mum) resulted in increased incorporation into phosphatidylcholine. 5. Incubation of fat-cells with propranolol (34mum) and adrenaline (5.4mum) resulted in abolition of adrenaline-stimulated lipolysis; there was a decrease in the specific radioactivity of phosphatidylcholine and an increase in the specific radioactivity of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol and cardiolipin compared with cells incubated with adrenaline alone. 6. Incubation of fat-cells with phenoxybenzamine (0.1mm) and adrenaline (5.4mum) resulted in stimulation of lipolysis, and in diminished specific radioactivities of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol and choline plasmalogen compared with cells stimulated with adrenaline alone.", 
    "1": "When the concentration of calcium ions in the cerebral ventricles is elevated, a fully satiated rat eats voraciously. This feeding response is not prevented by prior intraventricular administration of alpha-or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, or other pharmacological antagonists. This supports the concept of an independent ionic mechanism, rather than a neurotransmitter one, for modulating a \"set-point\" for weight or hunger.", 
    "2": "1. Carrageenin or 5-hydroxytryptamine-induced oedema of the mouse hind paw was antagonized by catecholamines acting on both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors.2. Increased permeability of the mouse peritoneum induced by the local injection of acetic acid or pro-inflammatory mediators was antagonized by catecholamines acting predominantly on beta-adrenoceptors.3. The anti-inflammatory effect of catecholamines was due neither to hyperglycaemia nor to the release of adrenal cortical hormones.", 
    "3": "1. The electrical and mechanical activity have been recorded from the rat ureter in situ.2. The frequency of peristaltic contractions is usually about 25/min, and each peristalsis is preceded by electrical activity which normally travels from the renal end of the ureter towards the vesicular end. The electrical and mechanical activities are closely correlated.3. The velocity of propagation of the electrical activity is about 20 mm/sec.4. The normal electromyogram probably arises in the first 5 mm of the renal end of the ureter, and retrograde activity may arise from a similar region at the vesicular end of the ureter.5. A close arterial injection technique shows that the proximal end of the ureter behaves as if it possessed alpha-receptors; the distal end behaves as if it had beta-receptors. This conclusion is discussed.", 
    "4": "1. At an ambient temperature of 20 degrees C, intraventricular injection of noradrenaline in the mouse resulted in hypothermia accompanied by a fall in metabolic rate and by cutaneous vasodilatation. Subcutaneous injection of noradrenaline resulted in hyperthermia with raised metabolic rate and cutaneous vasodilatation.2. The hypothermia and fall in oxygen consumption rate following intraventricular noradrenaline were prevented by pre-treatment with subcutaneous propranolol, while the cutaneous vasodilatation was un-affected. However, the effects of subcutaneously injected noradrenaline were completely abolished by subcutaneous propranolol. Intraventricular propranolol did not modify the hypothermic effect of intraventricular noradrenaline.3. The direction of the effect on body temperature of intraventricular noradrenaline was dependent upon ambient temperature; hypothermia occurring at low (15 degrees C) and hyperthermia at high (36 degrees C) ambient temperatures. However, when the possibility of any peripheral action of noradrenaline escaping into the systemic circulation was prevented by prior subcutaneous injection of propranolol, significant hypothermia could be detected at temperatures as high as 32 degrees C.4. The possibility that the effects of intraventricular noradrenaline could be due to complete abolition of central temperature regulation was further excluded by the occurrence of thermal salivation in all animals during experiments performed at 36 degrees C.5. It is suggested that, in the mouse, the hypothermic actions of intraventricular noradrenaline are due to a central effect, while its hyperthermic effects at high ambient temperature are due to escape of noradrenaline into the peripheral circulation. The hypothermia could be the result of selective activation of central heat loss mechanisms.6. Intraventricular noradrenaline was without effect on brain plasma-space although exposure to 100% oxygen caused a detectable fall.", 
    "5": "1. Electrical stimulation of the spinal nerves in the pithed rat preparation produces a pressor response due to sympathetic vasoconstriction.2. When the vasoconstrictor effect of sympathetic stimulation is abolished by guanethidine or hexamethonium and the blood pressure is raised by noradrenaline infusion, spinal stimulation produces depressor responses or complex responses containing depressor components.3. Contractions of skeletal muscle caused by stimulation of motor nerves result in complex changes in blood pressure consisting of a pressor component due to clamping of muscle blood vessels and a secondary depressor phase due to functional hyperaemia.4. The depressor response is partly due to stimulation of cholinergic postganglionic fibres. The acetylcholine released, which causes vasodilatation, may be the overflow from neuromuscular junctions or ganglionic synapses.5. Stimulation of the nerves to the adrenal medulla causes release of adrenaline which has a vasodilator effect during noradrenaline infusion."
