[Ca(2+)](i) and cell viability were measured using the fluorescent dyes fura-2 and 4-[3-[4-lodophenyl]-2-4(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio-1,3-benzene disulfonate] (WST-1), respectively. Carvedilol at concentrations between 1 and 30 microM increased [Ca( 2+)](i) in a concentration-dependent manner. The Ca(2+) signal was reduced partly by removing extracellular Ca(2+). Carvedilol induced Mn(2+) quench of fura-2 fluorescence implicating Ca(2+) influx. The Ca(2+) influx was inhibited by suppression of protein kinase C activity. In Ca(2+)-free medium, after pretreatment with 1 microM thapsigargin (an endoplasmic reticulum Ca( 2+) pump inhibitor), carvedilol-induced [Ca(2+)](i) rise was reduced; and conversely, carvedilol pretreatment inhibited a major part of thapsigargin-induced [Ca( 2+)](i) rise. Addition of the phospholipase C inhibitor 1-[6-[[17 beta-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino] hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U73122; 2 microM) did not change carvedilol-induced [Ca(2+)](i) rise. At concentrations between 5 and 70 microM, carvedilol killed cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The cytotoxic effect of 20 microM carvedilol was not reversed by prechelating cytosolic Ca(2+) with BAPTA/AM. Apoptosis was induced by 5-70 microM carvedilol. Collectively, in SIRC corneal epithelial cells, carvedilol-induced [Ca(2+)](i) rises by causing Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum in a phospholipase C-independent manner, and Ca( 2+) influx via protein kinase C-regulated Ca(2+) channels. Carvedilol-caused cytotoxicity was mediated by Ca(2+)-independent apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner.",

    "20": "The low level of ambient glutamate is important for the brain's spontaneous activity and proper synaptic transmission. Cholesterol deficiency has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders. It was examined whether membrane cholesterol modulated the extracellular glutamate level in nerve terminals and the processes responsible for its maintenance. The ambient L-[(14)C]glutamate level, being an equilibrium between Na(+)-dependent uptake and tonic release, was increased from 0.193+/-0.013 nmol/mg protein to 0.282+/-0.013 (extracellular endogenous glutamate-from 6.9+/-2.0 to 16.6+/-2.0, respectively) in rat brain synaptosomes treated with a cholesterol acceptor methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD). This alteration was not due to the change in the activity of glutamine synthetase that was shown with the specific blocker L-methionine sulfoximine. In the presence of DL-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate, which significantly reduced the contribution of glutamate transporters, net tonic release of L-[(14)C]glutamate was decreased by 38% and release in low-Na(+) medium was attenuated by 41% after cholesterol extraction. Also, cholesterol-deficient synaptosomes showed a reduced content of cytosolic L-[(14)C]glutamate and a lower initial velocity of L-[(14)C]glutamate uptake. We suggested that cholesterol deficiency altered the intra-to-extracellular glutamate ratio by the reduction of the cytosolic level of the neurotransmitter and the augmentation of the ambient glutamate level, thereby favoring a decrease in tonic glutamate release. Thus, increased extracellular glutamate in cholesterol-deficient nerve terminals was not a result of the changes in tonic release and/or glutamine synthetase activity, but was set by lack function of glutamate transporters.",

Existing data tend to focus on the concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the aqueous phase, with limited studies on their concentrations in particulate phase such as sediments. Furthermore, current water quality monitoring does not differentiate between soluble and colloidal phases in water samples, hindering our understanding of the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals in aquatic organisms. In this study, an investigation was conducted into the concentrations and phase association (soluble, colloidal, suspended particulate matter or SPM) of selected pharmaceuticals (propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, meberverine, thioridazine, carbamazepine, tamoxifen, indomethacine, diclofenac, and meclofenamic acid) in river water, effluents from sewage treatment works (STW), and groundwater in the UK.",

Colloids were isolated by cross-flow ultrafiltration (CFUF). Water samples were extracted by solid-phase extraction (SPE), while SPM was extracted by microwave. All sample extracts were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the multiple reaction monitoring.", 
    "25": "Five compounds propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, indomethacine, and diclofenac were detected in all samples, with carbamazepine showing the highest concentrations in all phases. The highest concentrations of these compounds were detected in STW effluents, confirming STW as a key source of these compounds in the aquatic environments. The calculation of partition coefficients of pharmaceuticals between SPM and filtrate (observed partition coefficients, Kobsp, Kobsoc), between SPM and soluble phase (intrinsic partition coefficients, Kintp, Kintoc), and between colloids and soluble phase (Kcoc) showed that intrinsic partition coefficients (Kintp, Kintoc) are between 25% and 96%, and between 18% and 82% higher than relevant observed partition coefficients values, and are much less variable. Secondly, Kcoc values are 3-4 orders of magnitude greater than Kintoc values, indicating that aquatic colloids are substantially more powerful sorbents for accumulating pharmaceuticals than sediments. Furthermore, mass balance calculations of pharmaceutical concentrations demonstrate that between 23% and 70% of propranolol, 17-62% of sulfamethoxazole, 7-58% of carbamazepine, 19-84% of indomethacine, and 9-74% of diclofenac are present in the colloidal phase.", 
    "26": "The results provide direct evidence that sorption to colloids provides an important sink for the pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. Such strong pharmaceutical/colloid interactions may provide a long-term storage of pharmaceuticals, hence, increasing their persistence while reducing their bioavailability in the environment.", 
    "27": "Pharmaceutical compounds have been detected not only in the aqueous phase but also in suspended particles; it is important, therefore, to have a holistic approach in future environmental fate investigation of pharmaceuticals. For example, more research is needed to assess the storage and long-term record of pharmaceutical residues in aquatic sediments by which benthic organisms will be most affected. Aquatic colloids have been shown to account for the accumulation of major fractions of total pharmaceutical concentrations in the aquatic environment, demonstrating unequivocally the importance of aquatic colloids as a sink for such residues in the aquatic systems. As aquatic colloids are abundant, ubiquitous, and highly powerful sorbents, they are expected to influence the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of such chemicals by aquatic organisms. It is therefore critical for colloids to be incorporated into water quality models for prediction and risk assessment purposes.", 
    "28": "The present study investigated leaf water transport properties in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) leaves. Leaf lamina hydraulic conductance (K(lam)) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) were drastically suppressed by NaF (a general metabolic inhibitor). In leaves treated with 0.2 mM HgCl(2) (an aquaporin blocker), K(lam) declined by 22% when the leaves were sampled in June but the decline was not significant when the leaves were sampled in August. The leaves sampled in June that transpired 30 mM beta-mercaptoethanol following mercury application showed similar K(lam) as those in control leaves transpiring distilled water. When leaves were pressure-infiltrated with 0.1 mM HgCl(2), K(lam) significantly declined by 25%. Atrazine (a photosystem II inhibitor) drastically reduced leaf net CO(2) uptake by the leaves from seedlings and mature trees but did not have any effect on K(lam) regardless of the irradiance at the leaf level during the K(lam) measurements. When PTS(3) (trisodium 3-hydroxy-5,8,10-pyrenetrisulphonate) apoplastic tracer was pressure-infiltrated inside the leaves, its concentration in the leaf exudates did not change from ambient light to high irradiance treatment and declined in the presence of HgCl(2) in the treatment solution. Trembling aspen K(lam) appears to be linked to leaf metabolism and is uncoupled from the short-term variations in photosynthesis. Aquaporin-mediated water transport does not appear to constitute the dominant pathway for the pressure-driven water flow in the leaves of trembling aspen trees.", 
    "29": "Perioperative beta-blocker therapy has been a heavily investigated and controversial topic during the past decade. Prior national consensus statements that recommended the routine use of these medications in patients undergoing high-risk surgical procedures have been called into question because of the results of recent clinical trials that involved heterogeneous groups of surgical patients. This article reviews the evidence for perioperative beta-blocker usage as it pertains to patients undergoing vascular surgery procedures. The weight of evidence suggests that beta-blockers lower the perioperative risk of myocardial ischemia or infarction and cardiovascular death among patients with clinical risk factors undergoing major vascular surgery. However, there appears to be a concurrent risk of adverse events associated with these medications if patients are not monitored properly during the perioperative period. Perioperative beta-blockers should continue to occupy a prominent role in the therapeutic armamentarium for improving outcomes among high-risk patients undergoing major vascular surgery.",

From 1980 to 2007, use of Angiotensin II receptor antagonist, beta-blocker, statins significantly increased and the in-hospital mortality significantly decreased in group C patients. Percent of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use was the highest in 1990s. The hospital stay was significantly longer and all cause in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in group C compared to group A and group B (all P < 0.01). After adjustment for other risk factors by multivariate analysis, renal dysfunction was an independent risk factor of in-hospital all cause mortality. Patients faced 16.7% higher risk of all cause in-hospital mortality for every 10 mlxmin(-1) x1.73 m(-2) decrease in GFR.", 
    "33": "The incidence of renal dysfunction was high in CHF patients. The hospital stay was longer, in-hospital all-cause mortality was higher in CHF patients with renal dysfunction compared to CHF patients without or with mild renal dysfunction. Renal dysfunction was an independent risk factor for all-cause in-hospital mortality. Increased use of ACEI, ARB, beta-blocker and statins might be responsible for reduced in-hospital mortality in CHF with renal dysfunction patients in recent years.",

Forty-three obese, hypertensive African Americans (mean BP: systolic, 148.8+/-14.3 mm Hg; diastolic, 90.4+/-8.2 mm Hg) were treated with nebivolol (5-10 mg/d) for 8 weeks. Primary outcomes were change in systolic and diastolic BP and efficacy in reaching normotensive BP. Mean systolic BP decreased by 9.2+/-14 mm Hg (P<.005) and diastolic BP decreased 6.8+/-9 mm Hg (P<.005) with 8 weeks of therapy. Significant improvements were seen in arterial compliance with nebivolol treatment as measured by aortic augmentation index (P<.005) and time to wave reflection (P=.013). Nebivolol treatment improved endothelial function as measured by flow-mediated dilation (P<.005). Levels of erythrocyte cellular superoxide dismutase increased with nebivolol, indirectly suggesting increased bioavailability of nitric oxide (P<.005). Monotherapy with nebivolol in obese, hypertensive African Americans results in significant systolic and diastolic BP reduction by mechanisms that include improved vascular function and compliance.", 
    "36": "In contrast to the impact of plasma protein binding on pharmacokinetics, no quantitative in vivo information is available on its impact on pharmacodynamics. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of the model drug S(-)-propranolol was evaluated using mechanism-based estimations of in vivo receptor affinity (K(B,vivo)), under conditions of altered plasma protein binding resulting from different levels of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP). Male Wistar Kyoto rats with isoprenaline-induced tachycardia received an intravenous infusion of S(-)-propranolol, on postsurgery day 2 (n = 7) and day 7 (n = 8) with elevated and normal plasma protein binding, respectively. Serial blood samples were taken in parallel to heart rate measurements. AGP concentrations at 2 and 7 days postsurgery were 708 +/- 274 and 176 +/- 111 microg/mL (mean +/- SE), respectively. Using nonlinear mixed effects modeling, AGP concentration was a covariate for intercompartmental clearance for the third compartment of the pharmacokinetic model of S(-)-propranolol. Individual values of AGP concentrations ranged between 110 and 1150 microg/mL, and were associated with K(B,vivo) values of S(-)-propranolol from 7.0 to 30 nM. Using the K(B,vivo) for S(-)-propranolol with correction for average values for normal and elevated plasma protein binding, nearly identical values were found. This confirms, strictly quantitative, earlier indications that plasma protein binding restricts the pharmacodynamics of S(-)-propranolol.",

Yet their effect on cognitive functions of the elderly is unclear. In this study, 518 elderly were interviewed at their home six years ago. BP was measured and antihypertensive drug treatment and cognitive functions were evaluated. 318 of the original sample were re-examined (81% of the survivors). We evaluated the selective survival in relation to changes in BP, the specific drug usage and cognitive functioning. Beta blocker treatment increased the odds of survival but also the odds of decline in MMSE and memory scores. ACE-I treatment was also associated with decline in memory. Subjects treated with CCB had improved MMSE scores, memory, and performed better on tasks requiring concentration. Statins treatment in this study did not show any affect on cognitive functions. Although most subjects were treated by more than one antihypertensive drug, less than half were normalized at baseline and only one quarter at follow-up. Despite the low normalization rate, antihypertensive treatment regimen had been hardly changed during the six years follow-up. The use of statins, however, increased dramatically: from 6% at baseline to almost half at follow-up. According to our findings CCB emerges as the best option for reducing BP in elderly patients. It appeared to improve cognitive functions without hampering survival.",

Despite these structural defects that provide a template for mechanical stress-induced damage, young Lmna(+/-) mice subjected to 6 weeks of moderate or strenuous exercise training did not show induction of apoptosis or accelerated DCM. In contrast, regular moderate exercise attenuated DCM development in male Lmna(+/-) mice. Sustained pressure overload generated by thoracic aortic constriction depressed ventricular contraction in young wild-type and Lmna(+/-) mice with no sex or genotype differences in the time-course or severity of response.

    "49": "Arachidonic acid (AA) is generated in the pancreatic islets during glucose stimulation. We investigated whether AA activated extracellular Ca(2+) entry in rat pancreatic beta cells via a pathway that was independent of the activation of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. The AA triggered [Ca(2+)](i) rise did not involve activation of GPR40 receptors or AA metabolism. When cells were voltage clamped at -70mV, the AA-mediated intracellular Ca(2+) release was accompanied by extracellular Ca(2+) entry. AA accelerated the rate of Mn(2+) quench of indo-1 fluorescence (near the Ca(2+)-independent wavelength of indo-1), reflecting the activation of a Ca(2+)-permeable pathway. The AA-mediated acceleration of Mn(2+) quench was inhibited by La(3+) but not by 2-APB (a blocker of capacitative Ca(2+) entry), suggesting the involvement of arachidonate-regulated Ca(2+) (ARC) channels. Consistent with this, intracellular application of the charged membrane-impermeant analog of AA, arachidonyl-coenzyme A (ACoA) triggered extracellular Ca(2+) entry, as well as the activation of a La(3+)-sensitive small inward current (1.7pA/pF) at -70mV.

Salivary flow was assessed by determining stimulated and non-stimulated flow/minute. The quantification of the sense of taste was determined on a visual analogue scale (VAS) using solutions of 0.9% NaCl (salty), 50% sucrose (sweet), 20% unsweetened coffee (bitter) and 4.2% vinegar (sour). The DMFT index (number of decayed/missing/filled teeth) was determined by a calibrated examination, following the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). Masticatory performance was assessed with an Optosil comminution test and Rosim-Ramler equation.",

    "54": "Noradrenalin modulates prefrontal function, such as working memory (WM), and is associated with enhanced distractibility, and enhanced memory for emotional events and stimuli. The beta-blocker propranolol has been shown to reduce memory for emotional stimuli. Herein we describe investigations aimed at assessing whether the administration of propranolol would reduce the interference by emotional distractions during WM performance. In a between-subjects design, 48 young, healthy men received 80 mg propranolol (n=25) or placebo (n=23), before performing an \"emotional Sternberg task\" with neutral and negatively arousing distracters. Compared to placebo, propranolol impaired WM at low load, however, it also reduced the interference by emotional distracters at high load. Furthermore, an explorative moderated-mediation analysis indicated that the observed propranolol effects on emotional distraction were partially mediated by cortisol. In future non-clinical and clinical memory studies using propranolol administration, cortisol elevations should be monitored to further investigate the potential mediating role of cortisol.",

After immunization, rats were orally administered 10 mg/kg/day carvedilol (group C, n = 15) or a vehicle control (Group V, n = 12) for 3 weeks. On day 21, echocardiography and haemodynamic parameters, myocarditis areas, and cytokine concentrations were measured. Serum carvedilol concentrations ranged from 10.5 +/- 2.6 to 31.7 +/- 9.3 ng/ml over a 24 h period on day 20. Carvedilol decreased the myocarditis areas (23.07 +/- 1.6 versus 33.65 +/- 2.71%, P < 0.0001). The left ventricular fractional shortening and the absolute value of +dP/dt or -dP/dt were significantly higher in Group C. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and central venous pressure were significantly lower in Group C.

    "59": "Therapeutic efficiency of spirapryl and its combination with carvedilol in the treatment of diastolic cardiac insufficiency in patients with type 2 diabetes and essential arterial hypertension (AH). Criteria for inclusion in the study of 86 patients (20 men and 66 women) were diastolic cardiac insufficiency diagnosed as recommended by the Working Group of European Society of Cardiologists (2002). The patients were divided into 2 groups receiving either spirapryl (n = 42) or spirapryl with carvedilol (alpha, beta-adenoblocker). The patients were examined before and 24 weeks after therapy for the evaluation of their clinical condition, tolerance of physical activity, transmitral and transcuspidal diastolic flows (ECG and Doppler-ECG). All therapeutic modalities significantly improved the patients\" conditions, diastolic function, and ECG/ECG characteristics, but the best results were obtained with combined therapy that had beneficial effect on transmitral and transcuspidal diastolic flows (P < 0.01) and tolerance of physical exercises (P < 0.05). It is concluded that combined treatment with spirapryl and its combination with carvedilol is more efficient for the management of diastolic cardiac insufficiency than carvedilol monotherapy.", 
    "60": "Chemical oxidation processes have been widely applied to water treatment and may serve as a tool to minimize the release of micropollutants (e.g. pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors) from municipal wastewater effluents into the aquatic environment. The potential of several oxidants for the transformation of selected micropollutants such as atenolol, carbamazepine, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), ibuprofen, and sulfamethoxazole was assessed and compared. The oxidants include chlorine, chlorine dioxide, ferrate(VI), and ozone as selective oxidants versus hydroxyl radicals as non-selective oxidant. Second-order rate constants (k) for the reaction of each oxidant show that the selective oxidants react only with some electron-rich organic moieties (ERMs), such as phenols, anilines, olefins, and deprotonated-amines. In contrast, hydroxyl radicals show a nearly diffusion-controlled reactivity with almost all organic moieties (k>or=10(9)M(-1) s(-1)). Due to a competition for oxidants between a target micropollutant and wastewater matrix (i.e. effluent organic matter, EfOM), a higher reaction rate with a target micropollutant does not necessarily translate into more efficient transformation. For example, transformation efficiencies of EE2, a phenolic micropollutant, in a selected wastewater effluent at pH 8 varied only within a factor of 7 among the selective oxidants, even though the corresponding k for the reaction of each selective oxidant with EE2 varied over four orders of magnitude. In addition, for the selective oxidants, the competition disappears rapidly after the ERMs present in EfOM are consumed. In contrast, for hydroxyl radicals, the competition remains practically the same during the entire oxidation. Therefore, for a given oxidant dose, the selective oxidants were more efficient than hydroxyl radicals for transforming ERMs-containing micropollutants, while hydroxyl radicals are capable of transforming micropollutants even without ERMs. Besides EfOM, ammonia, nitrite, and bromide were found to affect the micropollutant transformation efficiency during chlorine or ozone treatment.", 
    "61": "Diabetes mellitus is a common disease and contributes to a high degree of morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular complications, including diabetic cardiomyopathy are major causes of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a condition that affects the myocardium, primarily. It is not necessarily associated with ischemic heart disease, high blood pressure, valvular or congenital anomalies. The pathology of diabetic cardiomyopathy includes interstitial fibrosis, apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, abnormal energy utilization, small vessel disease and cardiac neuropathy. These pathologies are induced by hyperglycemia and oxidative stress. Biochemical as well as electrolyte changes, especially reduced calcium availability also occurs in the myocardium of diabetic patients. The abnormal structure and biochemistry of the myocardium result in functional problems such as diastolic and systolic dysfunctions, which may cause symptoms of dyspnea and inability to tolerate exercise. No single specific therapeutic agent can treat diabetic cardiomyopathy because once the disease is overt, the management may require a variety of approaches such as risk factors and lifestyle modification, glucose control (insulin, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, sulfonylureas, biguanides, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors); hormones (IGF-1); ACE inhibitors (captopril, enalapril); angiotensin II receptor antagonists (losartan, olmesartan); beta adrenoreceptor antagonists (acebutolol, carvedilol); peptides (adrenomedullin); endothelin-1 receptor antagonists (bosentan, tezosentan); calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, verapamil); antioxidants (methalothionein, alpha tocopherol, alpha lipoic acid) and antihyperlipidemic drugs (simvastatin, fenofibrate, ezetimibe) to effectively treat patients with diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

    "63": "Landiolol is a recently developed, selective short-acting beta1-antagonist. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of landiolol for suppressing haemodynamic changes induced by laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation (LTI) in Japanese patients. A comprehensive search was undertaken to identify all randomised comparisons of landiolol with placebo that examined effects on haemodynamic responses following LTI. MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE and the Japanese Central Review of Medicine were searched from their date of inception to February 2009. Trials were included in the review if heart rate, systolic blood pressure or mean blood pressure was recorded at three different stages: pre-induction, just before intubation and in the post-intubation period. Weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for changes in haemodynamic variables between treatment and placebo groups. Seven randomised controlled trials involving 325 patients were included in the study. Of these, five trials that used the same continuous infusion regimen for landiolol (0.125 mg/kg/minute for one minute followed by 0.04 mg/kg/minute) showed efficacy in attenuation of heart rate and blood pressure following LTI (heart rate weighted mean difference: -21.18 bpm, 95% CI -18.59 to -14.20; systolic blood pressure weighted mean difference: -23.03 mmHg, 95% CI -43.59 to -2.47; mean blood pressure weighted mean difference: -16.26 mmHg, 95% CI -23.96 to -8.55). The other two studies used bolus administration of landiolol (0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg), but it was difficult to evaluate the efficacy because of the limited amount of data. Landiolol administration at 0.125 mg/kg/minute for one minute followed by 0.04 mg/kg/minute effectively suppresses the increases in heart rate and blood pressure following LTI. For a bolus regimen of landiolol, further studies are required to determine the efficacy and the optimal dose and timing for suppression of haemodynamic responses following LTI.",

    "76": "Salt ions were found to have an influence on template binding to two model molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), targeted to penicillin G and propranolol, respectively, in water-acetonitrile mixtures. Water was detrimental to rebinding of penicillin G whereas propranolol bound in the entire water-acetonitrile range tested. In 100% aqueous solution, 3-M salt solutions augmented the binding of both templates. The effects followed the Hofmeister series with kosmotropic ions promoting the largest increase. Binding was mainly of a non-specific nature under these conditions. In acetonitrile containing low amounts of water, the specific binding to the MIPs increased with the addition of salts. Binding of penicillin G followed the Hofmeister series while an ion-exchange mechanism was observed for propranolol. The results suggest that hydration of kosmotropic ions reduces the water activity in water-poor media providing a stabilizing effect on water-sensitive MIP-template interactions. The effects were utilized to develop a procedure for molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) of penicillin G from milk with a recovery of 87%.",

Inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective treatment for asthma in children and adults, with no evidence that the magnitude of benefit differs between adults and school-aged children. Leukotriene inhibitors are more widely used in children than in adults. This may be because provoking stimuli, such as environmental allergens and frequent exercise, are more important asthma triggers in children or because parental concerns about the side effects of treatment with ICS. Inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting inhaled beta(2)-agonist combinations may not be as effective in children as in they are adults in improving asthma control and reducing asthma exacerbations.", 
    "79": "Heart rate variability is a common feature of the vertebrate cardiovascular system and is a consequence of variable input from the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. The aim of this study was to examine the role of the autonomic nervous system in regulating heart rate and heart rate variability in 1-d-old emu hatchlings in normoxia and during exposure to 10% O2. The role of the autonomic nervous system in controlling emu heart rate and its variability was examined by blocking the action of the cholinergic and adrenergic pathways by administration of atropine and propranolol. Heart rate of 1-d-old hatchlings exhibited a significant cholinergic tone of 60 +/- 22 beats per minute (bpm) and beta-adrenergic tone of 28 +/- 17 bpm. Cholinergic tone was unchanged during hypoxic exposure (63.5 +/- 17.7 bpm), but adrenergic tone doubled to 68 +/- 15 bpm. Initially, the majority of hatchlings exhibited high frequency oscillations with a spectral peak at 0.22 +/- 0.02 Hz, associated with respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Beta-adrenergic blockade had no effect on respiratory sinus arrhythmia or spectral power in high frequency (HF; 0.1 to 0.7 Hz), low frequency (LF; 0.01 to 0.1 Hz), or total frequency (TF) ranges. After cholinergic blockade, spectral power in HF, LF, and TF ranges and respiratory sinus arrhythmia were all abolished. Hypoxia did not initially alter spectral power in the HF, LF, or TF ranges. beta-Adrenergic blockade along with hypoxia produced a significant increase in LF oscillations. A distinct LF oscillation appeared in most birds exposed to hypoxia that was abolished by cholinergic blockade. We conclude that although both the sympathetic and parasympathetic system exert a tonic influence on heart rate, the majority of HF and TF heart rate variability is mediated by the parasympathetic system in the emu hatchling. The sympathetic system contributes to LF heart rate oscillations by suppressing the influence of the parasympathetic system on LF oscillations.", 
    "80": "Due to the aging of the populations of developed countries and a common occurrence of risk factors, it is increasingly probable that a patient may have both cancer and cardiovascular disease. In addition, cytotoxic agents and targeted therapies used to treat cancer, including classic chemotherapeutic agents, monoclonal antibodies that target tyrosine kinase receptors, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and even antiangiogenic drugs and chemoprevention agents such as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, all affect the cardiovascular system. One of the reasons is that many agents reach targets in the microenvironment and do not affect only the tumor. Combination therapy often amplifies cardiotoxicity, and radiotherapy can also cause heart problems, particularly when combined with chemotherapy. In the past, cardiotoxic risk was less evident, but it is increasingly an issue, particularly with combination therapy and adjuvant therapy. Today's oncologists must be fully aware of cardiovascular risks to avoid or prevent adverse cardiovascular effects, and cardiologists must now be ready to assist oncologists by performing evaluations relevant to the choice of therapy. There is a need for cooperation between these two areas and for the development of a novel discipline, which could be termed cardio-oncology or onco-cardiology. Here, we summarize the potential cardiovascular toxicities for a range of cancer chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive agents and emphasize the importance of evaluating cardiovascular risk when patients enter into trials and the need to develop guidelines that include collateral effects on the cardiovascular system. We also discuss mechanistic pathways and describe several potential protective agents that could be administered to patients with occult or overt risk for cardiovascular complications.", 
    "81": "Local cooling (LC) of nonglabrous skin causes vasoconstriction via the adrenergic and removal of nitric oxide (NO) systems. Since cooling increases reactive oxygen species in smooth muscle cells and induces increased sensitivity of alpha-adrenergic receptors, antioxidant supplementation may attenuate the vasoconstrictor response to skin LC via adrenergic and/or NO systems. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of acute L-ascorbate (Asc, 10 mM) supplementation in human skin on the vasoconstrictor responses to LC in skin with and without NO synthase (NOS) inhibition or adrenergic receptor blockade. In a three-part study, forearm sites were instrumented with microdialysis fibers, local coolers, and laser-Doppler flow (LDF) probes in healthy volunteers. Sites were cooled from 34 to 24 degrees C at -1 degrees C/min and maintained at 24 degrees C for 20 min (parts 1 and 2) or 30 min (part 3). During the last 10 min of LC in parts 1 and 2, whole body cooling was performed to increase sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity. Cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) was calculated as the ratio of LDF to blood pressure and expressed relative to the baseline value before cooling. Treatments in each part were as follows: part 1) untreated, Asc; part 2) N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) to inhibit NOS, combined L-NAME + Asc; part 3) yohimbine (YOH) + propranolol (PRO) to antagonize alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors and combined YOH + PRO + Asc. CVC reduction during LC was smaller (P < 0.001) at Asc sites (-31 +/- 4%) than at untreated sites (-56 +/- 5%). LC-induced reduction in CVC was smaller (P < 0.05) at L-NAME + Asc sites (-23 +/- 8%) than at L-NAME sites (-43 +/- 7%). LC-induced reduction in CVC did not differ between at PRO + YOH sites (-56 +/- 3%) and at PRO + YOH + Asc sites (-50 +/- 3%). These findings suggest that antioxidant supplementation inhibits the vasoconstrictor response to direct cooling through an adrenoceptor-dependent mechanism in human skin.",

The protein and mRNA expression of eotaxin-1 were measured by ELISA assay and real-time PCR, respectively. Effects of formoterol and salmeterol on nuclear and cytosolic pSTAT-6 expression were evaluated by Western blot and immunofluorescence study. Formoterol and salmeterol (10(-7)-10(-10) m) significantly down-regulated IL-4- induced eotaxin-1 expression in BEAS-2B cells. A specific beta(2) adrenoceptor antagonist (ICI 118,551) reversed their suppression of eotaxin-1 production. Forskolin, an cAMP activator, could also suppress the expression of eotaxin-1 by IL-4 in a dose dependent manner (10(-7)-10(-10 )m). The western blot and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that formoterol 10(-7 )m suppressed the nuclear expression of pSTAT-6. Formoterol and salmeterol, two inhaled long-acting beta(2) agonists, down-regulated IL-4- induced eotaxin-1 expression in BEAS-2B cells. The effect was mediated via the beta(2) adrenoceptor, and cAMP. Formoterol significantly down-regulated pSTAT6 at higher concentration, and further turned off the IL-4 signaling pathway.",

    "122": "Norepinephrine and dopamine are both believed to affect signal-to-noise in the cerebral cortex. Dopaminergic agents appear to modulate semantic networks during indirect semantic priming, but do not appear to affect problem solving dependent on access to semantic networks. Noradrenergic agents, though, do affect semantic network dependent problem solving. We wished to examine whether noradrenergic agents affect indirect semantic priming. Subjects attended three sessions: one each after propranolol (40 mg) (noradrenergic antagonist), ephedrine (25 mg) (noradrenergic agonist), and placebo. During each session, closely related, distantly related, and unrelated pairs were presented. Reaction times for a lexical decision task on the target words (second word in the pair) were recorded. No decrease in indirect semantic priming occurred with ephedrine. Furthermore, across all three drugs, a main effect of semantic relatedness was found, but no main effect of drug, and no drug/semantic relatedness interaction effect. These findings suggest that noradrenergic agents, with these drugs and at these doses, do not affect indirect semantic priming with the potency of dopaminergic drugs at the doses previously studied. In the context of this previous work, this suggests that more automatic processes such as priming and more controlled searches of the lexical and semantic networks such as problem solving may be mediated, at least in part, by distinct mechanisms with differing effects of pharmacological modulation.", 
    "123": "Exogenous or endogenous beta(2)-adrenergic receptor agonists enhance alveolar epithelial fluid transport via a cAMP-dependent mechanism that protects the lungs from alveolar flooding in acute lung injury. However, impaired alveolar fluid clearance is present in most of the patients with acute lung injury and is associated with increased mortality, although the mechanisms responsible for this inhibition of the alveolar epithelial fluid transport are not completely understood. Here, we found that transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), a critical mediator of acute lung injury, inhibits beta(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist-stimulated vectorial fluid and Cl(-) transport across primary rat and human alveolar epithelial type II cell monolayers. This inhibition is due to a reduction in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator activity and biosynthesis mediated by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent heterologous desensitization and down-regulation of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. Consistent with these in vitro results, inhibition of the PI3K pathway or pretreatment with soluble chimeric TGF-beta type II receptor restored beta(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist-stimulated alveolar epithelial fluid transport in an in vivo model of acute lung injury induced by hemorrhagic shock in rats. The results demonstrate a novel role for TGF-beta1 in impairing the beta- adrenergic agonist-stimulated alveolar fluid clearance in acute lung injury, an effect that could be corrected by using PI3K inhibitors that are safe to use in humans.",

Acidic modifiers were responsible for acidification of mobile phase (pH 3) ensuring the protonation of the beta-blockers and further ion pairs creation. The effect of the type and concentration of mobile phase additives on retention parameters, the efficiency of the peaks, their symmetry and separation selectivity of the beta-blockers mixture were all studied. It appeared that at increasing acid concentration, the retention factor, for all compounds investigated, increased to varying degrees. It should be stressed that the presence of acids more significantly affected the retention of the most hydrophobic beta-blockers. Differences in hydrophobicity of drugs can be maximized through variation of the hydrophobicity of additives. Thus, the relative increase in the retention depends on either concentration and hydrophobicity of the anionic mobile phase additive or hydrophobicity of analytes. According to QSRR (quantitative structure retention relationship) methodology, chromatographic lipophilicity parameters: isocratic log k and log k(w) values (extrapolated retention to pure water) were correlated with the molecular (log P(o/w)) and apparent (log P(app)) octanol-water partition coefficients obtained experimentally by countercurrent chromatography (CCC) or predicted by Pallas software. The obtained, satisfactory retention-hydrophobicity correlations indicate that, in the case of the basic drugs examined in RP-HPLC systems modified with perfluorinated acids, the retention is mainly governed by their hydrophobicity.",

Thus, we believe that this pheromone may increase anxiety levels in rats. In the current study, we evaluated the predictive validity of this alarm pheromone-induced anxiogenic effect in detail by investigating whether six types of human anxiolytics, each of which has a different mechanism of action, were efficacious in reducing anxiety, using changes in the acoustic startle reflex (ASR) as an index. The alarm pheromone-enhanced ASR was not affected by vehicle pretreatment but was dose-dependently attenuated by pretreatment with midazolam, phenelzine, propranolol, clonidine, and CP-154,526-although not buspirone. These results may reflect some aspects of the predictive validity of the alarm pheromone-induced anxiety in rats as an animal model of human anxiety.", 
    "135": "The present study examined whether vagal visceral inputs are involved in parasympathetic reflex vasodilatation in the masseter muscle in urethane-anesthetized and cervically sympathectomized rats. Electrical stimulation of the central cut end of the cervical vagus nerve (VN) including visceral afferent fibers, which consisted of cervical/thoracic branches (heart and lungs) and abdominal branches (entire gastrointestinal tract), elicited intensity- and frequency-dependent increases of blood flow in the masseter muscle (MBF). Activation of the abdominal VN inferior to the diaphragm failed to affect the MBF. MBF increases evoked by cervical VN stimulation were reduced significantly by hexamethonium. Pretreatment with atropine reduced the MBF increase evoked by VN stimulation significantly, whereas pretreatment with either propranolol or phentolamine had no effect on the response. MBF increases occurred with electrical stimulation of nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), and these increases were significantly reduced by the administration of hexamethonium and atropine. MBF increases also occurred after microinjection of glutamate into the NTS in a dose-dependent manner. Microinjection of muscimol into the NTS caused a significant attenuation of the VN stimulation-induced MBF increases. Our results suggest that vagal visceral inputs passing to the NTS are involved in the parasympathetic reflex vasodilatation in the rat masseter muscle. The MBF increase evoked by the vagal-parasympathetic reflex mechanism occurred via visceral afferents running in the cervical VN, but not in the abdominal VN, suggesting that the vagal visceral afferents derived from cardiovascular and/or respiratory systems may play an important role in the regulation of the MBF.", 
    "136": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pomegranate (Punica granatum L., Punicaceae) seed extract on uterine contractility. Pomegranate seeds were methanolic extracted and their constituents analyzed using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Isometric force was measured in strips of longitudinal rat myometrium and the effects of pomegranate seed extract studied. We found beta-sitosterol to be the main constituent of the extract (16%) and its effects were also investigated. Pomegranate seed extract and beta-sitosterol increased spontaneous contractions in a concentration-dependent manner with a maximum effect at 250 mg/100 mL and 1 mg/100 mL, respectively. The amplitude and frequency of the phasic contraction were significantly increased along with basal tension. The effects of pomegranate seed extract were very similar to those of beta-sitosterol. Force produced in the presence of pomegranate seed extract was abolished by the inhibition of L-type calcium channels or myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Contractions were not potentiated by pomegranate extract following the inhibition of K channels or inhibition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). The actions of beta-sitosterol and the extract were not blocked by the estrogen receptor blocker, fulvestrant. We conclude that pomegranate seed extract is a potent stimulator of phasic activity in rat uterus. Our data suggest that the uterotonic effect is due to nonestrogenic effects of beta-sitosterol acting to inhibit K channels and SERCA and thereby increasing contraction via calcium entry on L-type calcium channels and MLCK. We suggest that pomegranate extract and beta-sitosterol may be a useful uterine stimulant.",

Preliminary results confirm feasibility of the study, an acceptable side effect profile and promising preliminary efficacy data.

The chambers were placed on a microelectrode-array (MEA) substrate and connected with a pathway. 24 hours after dissemination of the VMs, neuntes of the SCG neurons outgrew through the pathway and reached the VMs. Spontaneous electrical activities of the SCG neurons and the VMs were observed several days after the dissemination. Constant-voltage stimualtion (1 V, 1 ms, biphasic square pulses) was applied to the SCG neurons at the frequency of 10 Hz using 32 electrodes. Contraction rate of the VMs increased by 153 +/-110 % immediately after the stimulation to the SCG neurons was stopped. Then contraction rate gradually decreased and returned to almost the same rate as before the stimulation 5 minutes after the 1-min stimulation. Propranolol (beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist) prevented contraction rate of the VMs from increasing after electrical stimulation to the SCG neurons. These results suggest that neuromuscular junctions were formed between the SCG neurons and the VMs. Overall the semi-separated co-culture system in this study is available in research on changes in contraction rate of the VMs after applying electrical stimulation to the SCG neurons.",

The effects of TQ were significantly potentiated by bosentan (an ET(A)/ET(B) receptor antagonist). The effects of TQ were slightly abolished by pretreatment of the rings with glibenclamide (a non-selective blocker of ATP-sensitive K+ channels). TQ totally abolished the pressor effects of serotonin and phenylephrine on the isolated rat pulmonary arterial rings.", 
    "147": "The results of the present study suggest that TQ-induced relaxation of the precontracted pulmonary artery is probably mediated, at least in part, by activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels and possibly by non-competitive blocking of serotonin, alpha1 and endothelin receptors.", 
    "148": "The present study investigated a possible antidepressant-like activity of bis selenide using two predictive tests for antidepressant effect on rodents: the forced swimming test (FST) and the tail suspension test (TST). Bis selenide (0.5-5 mg/kg, p.o.) decreased the immobility time in the mouse FST and TST. The anti-immobility effect of bis selenide (1 mg/kg, p.o.) in the TST was prevented by the pretreatment of mice with p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester (PCPA; 100 mg/kg, i.p., an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis), ketanserin (1 mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist), and ondasentron (1 mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist). Pretreatment of mice with prazosin (1 mg/kg, i.p., an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist), yohimbine (1 mg/kg, i.p., an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist), propranolol (2 mg/kg, i.p., a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist), SCH23390 (0.05 mg/kg, s.c., a dopamine D(1) receptor antagonist), sulpiride (50 mg/kg, i.p., a dopamine D(2) receptor antagonist), or WAY 100635 (0.1 mg/kg, s.c., a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist) did not block the antidepressant-like effect of bis selenide (1 mg/kg, p.o.) in the TST. Administration of bis selenide (0.1 mg/kg, p.o.) and fluoxetine (1 mg/kg), at subeffective doses, produced an antidepressant-like effect in the TST. Bis selenide did not alter Na(+) K(+) ATPase, MAO-A and MAO-B activities in whole brains of mice. Bis selenide produced an antidepressant-like effect in the mouse TST and FST, which may be related to the serotonergic system (5-HT(2A/2C) and 5-HT(3) receptors).", 
    "149": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and it causes substantial mortality. The autonomic nervous system, and particularly the adrenergic/cholinergic balance, has a profound influence on the occurrence of AF. Adrenergic stimulation from catecholamines can cause AF in patients. In human atrium, catecholamines can affect each of the electrophysiological mechanisms of AF initiation and/or maintenance. Catecholamines may produce membrane potential oscillations characteristic of afterdepolarisations, by increasing Ca(2+) current, [Ca(2+)](i) and consequent Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange, and may also enhance automaticity. Catecholamines might affect reentry, by altering excitability or conduction, rather than action potential terminal repolarisation or refractory period. However, which arrhythmia mechanisms predominate is unclear, and likely depends on cardiac pathology and adrenergic tone. Heart failure (HF), a major cause of AF, causes adrenergic activation and adaptational changes, remodelling, of atrial electrophysiology, Ca(2+) homeostasis, and adrenergic responses. Chronic AF also remodels these, but differently to HF. Myocardial infarction and AF cause neural remodelling that also may promote AF. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) are used in the treatment of AF, mainly to control the ventricular rate, by slowing atrioventricular conduction. beta-Blockers also reduce the incidence of AF, particularly in HF or after cardiac surgery, when adrenergic tone is high. Furthermore, the chronic treatment of patients with beta-blockers remodels the atria, with a potentially antiarrhythmic increase in the refractory period. Therefore, the suppression of AF by beta-blocker treatment may involve an attenuation of arrhythmic activity that is caused by increased [Ca(2+)](i), coupled with effects of adaptation to the treatment. An improved understanding of the involvement of the adrenergic system and its control in basic mechanisms of AF under differing cardiac pathologies might lead to better treatments.", 
    "150": "Large-scale, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce mortality and hospitalization in patients with heart failure (HF) caused by left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). However, it is unknown whether ACE inhibitors and ARBs have similar effects on the long-term outcomes in HF patients encountered in routine clinical practice. The Japanese Cardiac Registry of Heart Failure in Cardiology enrolled HF patients hospitalized with worsening symptoms and they were followed during an average of 2.2 years. The outcome data were compared in patients with LVSD by echocardiography (ejection fraction, EF <40%) according to the predischarge use of ACE inhibitors (n=356) or ARBs (n=372). The clinical characteristics were similar between patients with ACE inhibitor and ARB use, except for higher prevalence of hypertensive etiology and diabetes mellitus. There was no significant difference between ACE inhibitor and ARB use in all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.958, 95% confidence interval 0.601-1.527, P=0.858) and rehospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 0.964, 95% confidence interval 0.683-1.362, P=0.836). The effects of ACE inhibitor and ARB use on the outcomes were generally consistent across all clinically relevant subgroups examined, including age, sex, etiology, EF, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and beta-blocker use. Discharge use of ARBs provided comparable effects with ACE inhibitors on outcomes in patients hospitalized for HF. These findings provide further support for guideline recommendations that ARBs can be used in patients with HF and LVSD as an alternative of ACE inhibitors.",

Seven dogs were anesthetized, and dobutamine or esmolol was infused at a rate of 5.0 and 10.0 mug/kg/min or 100 and 500 mug/kg/min, respectively, via a cephalic vein. The order of drug administration (dobutamine or esmolol) was assigned to each dog. Simultaneous pulsed-Doppler (PD) echocardiography, TDI and hemodynamic measurements were performed. Compared with the baseline values, dobutamine significantly increased dP/dt min, but significantly shortened tau (tau). Similarly, esmolol significantly decreased dP/dt min, but significantly prolonged tau. Compared with the baseline values, dobutamine significantly increased V(IR) and ACC, and esmolol significantly decreased V(IR) and ACC. Both dP/dt min and tau were significantly correlated with TDI-derived IVRT (r=-0.43 and 0.74), V(IR) (r=0.85 and -0.49) and ACC (r=0.84 and -0.52). These results indicate that the TDI-derived V(IR) and ACC values obtained from the LV free wall can potentially be used to assess LV relaxation in dogs.",

Various behavioural (locomotor activity, Morris water maze task) and biochemical parameters (lipid peroxidation, nitrate concentration, catalase, acetylcholinesterase, reduced glutathione and protein) were assessed.", 
    "154": "Intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin caused a significant memory deficit as evaluated in the Morris water maze task paradigms, and caused marked oxidative damage as indicated by significant increases in malondialdehyde and nitrite levels, and depletion of superoxide dismutase, catalase and reduced glutathione levels. It also caused a significant increase in acetylcholinesterase activity. Chronic administration of carvedilol (1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p.) for a period of 25 days starting 4 days before streptozotocin administration resulted in an improvement in memory retention, and attenuation of oxidative damage and acetylcholinesterase activity.",

    "157": "Three hundred and two consecutive glaucoma patients (91 males and 211 females, mean age 66.5+/-11.6 years, mean duration of disease 4.4 years) were investigated. Each patient underwent examination of the intraocular pressure (IOP), anterior eye segment, fundus oculi, and recommendations about further treatment were given.", 
    "158": "Females were 70% of the investigated subjects (the ratio of men to women was 1:2.3). Sixty-seven patients (22%) had a family history of glaucoma. Fifty-one (17%) of the glaucoma patients had diabetes mellitus, and 174 (58%)--arterial hypertension. Pseudoexfoliations on the pupillary margin and on anterior lens capsule were observed in 51 patients (17%). The distribution of glaucomas by type was as follows: primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)--209 patients, pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PEG)--50 patients, normal-tension glaucoma (NTG)--15 patients, closed-angle glaucoma (CAG)--9 patients, pigmentary glaucoma--6 patients, juvenile glaucoma--1 patient, congenital glaucoma--1 patient, secondary glaucoma--11 patients. According to the stage of the disease the investigated eyes were distributed as follows: early stage of glaucoma--41%, evolution stage--20%, progressive stage--19%, terminal stage--8%. Ten percent of the eyes presented with ocular hypertension and were suspect for glaucoma, while 2% were without glaucoma. Prostaglandin analogues were the most frequently used antiglaucoma topical drugs (45%), followed by beta-blockers (35%). The therapeutic approach was changed for 104 glaucoma patients (34%).", 
    "159": "The primary open-angle glaucoma has the highest frequency in our sample approximately 70% of the cases of glaucomas; pseudoexfoliation glaucoma has a relatively low frequency--17% and the low pressure glaucoma has a surprisingly low relative percentage in the sample. Therapy was changed in more than a third of the examined glaucoma patients--change in the drug therapy or referring patients for antiglaucoma surgery.",

The pharmacokinetic parameters of MET and META were measured after oral (15 mg/kg) administration of MET in rats in the presence and absence of SalB. Compared to the control given MET alone, with the concurrent administration of SalB (50 mg/kg), the AUC and C(max) of MET increased by 51.7% and 27.7%, and the AUC and C(max) of META decreased by 26.5% and 19.6%, respectively. With the presence of SalB, the metabolic ratio was markedly decreased by 50.8%. However, no significant changes were observed in the pharmacokinetic parameters of SalB when it was combined with MET.", 
    "161": "The epinephrine test has been shown to be a powerful tool to predict the genotype of congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS). The aim of this study was to evaluate its role in the diagnosis and management of LQTS in children. The test (using the Shimizu protocol) was conducted in patients with some evidence of LQTS but in whom clinical and management decisions were challenging (n = 41, age 9.6 +/- 3.9 years, 19 female). LQT1, LQT2, and negative responses to epinephrine were obtained in 16, 5, and 20 subjects, respectively. LQTS gene positivity was obtained in two subjects. Beta-blocker therapy was started in all subjects with a positive epinephrine response (n = 21) and in some negative responders because of their strong LQTS phenotype (n = 10). No therapy was given to the subset with less convincing features of LQTS who had also responded negatively to epinephrine (n = 10). Follow-up for 3.0 +/- 2 years was uneventful in both management groups. Due to the discordance with genotyping, the epinephrine test cannot be used to diagnose genotype-positive LQTS but when used in combination with phenotype assessment and genetic screening, it could enable better management decisions.", 
    "162": "Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a progressive disease and may lead to chronic kidney disease by deterioration of renal functions. Endothelial dysfunction is an important causative factor for kidney damage after RAS revascularization. Nebivolol, a new generation beta blocker induces endothelium-related arterial relaxation by nitric oxide (NO) and may improve endothelial dysfunction. This pilot study tested the effect of nebivolol on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in a series of 33 patients with severe RAS (>70%) who underwent revascularization. After revascularization, nebivolol was added to antihypertensive treatment in 17 randomly selected patients while 16 patients (control group) continued their standard treatment. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), proteinuria as well as nitrite and nitrate levels were measured at baseline and 6 months after the revascularization procedure. Six months after revascularization, eGFR increased from 44.8 to 50.6 ml/min in the nebivolol group. In contrast, eGFR did not change in the control group. Nitrite/nitrate levels decreased to a significant extent both in the nebivolol and in the control group. Proteinuria decreased more in the nebivolol group compared to the control group. These pilot data support a full-fledged clinical trial, testing whether nebivolol may be beneficial in the post-revascularization phase in patients with RAS.", 
    "163": "Absence seizures are characterized by cortical spike-wave discharges (SWDs) on electroencephalography, often accompanied by a shift in the firing pattern of thalamocortical (TC) neurons from tonic to burst firing driven by T-type Ca(2+) currents. We recently demonstrated that the phospholipase C beta4 (PLCbeta4) pathway tunes the firing mode of TC neurons via the simultaneous regulation of T- and L-type Ca(2+) currents, which prompted us to investigate the contribution of TC firing modes to absence seizures. PLCbeta4-deficient TC neurons were readily shifted to the oscillatory burst firing mode after a slight hyperpolarization of membrane potential. TC-limited knockdown as well as whole-animal knockout of PLCbeta4 induced spontaneous SWDs with simultaneous behavioral arrests and increased the susceptibility to drug-induced SWDs, indicating that the deletion of thalamic PLCbeta4 leads to the genesis of absence seizures. The SWDs were effectively suppressed by thalamic infusion of a T-type, but not an L-type, Ca(2+) channel blocker. These results reveal a primary role of TC neurons in the genesis of absence seizures and provide strong evidence that an alteration of the firing property of TC neurons is sufficient to generate absence seizures. Our study presents PLCbeta4-deficient mice as a potential animal model for absence seizures.", 
    "164": "The goal of the current study was to investigate the role of exogenous and endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) on neovascularization and wound healing in vitro and in vivo. Incubation of endothelial cells (ECs) with H(2)S enhanced their angiogenic potential, evidenced by accelerated cell growth, migration, and capillary morphogenesis on Matrigel. Treatment of chicken chorioallantoic membranes (CAMS) with H(2)S increased vascular length. Exposure of ECs to H(2)S resulted in increased phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, and p38. The K(ATP) channel blocker glibenclamide or the p38 inhibitor SB203580 abolished H(2)S-induced EC motility. Since glibenclamide inhibited H(2)S-triggered p38 phosphorylation, we propose that K(ATP) channels lay upstream of p38 in this process. When CAMs were treated with H(2)S biosynthesis inhibitors dl-propylargylglycine or beta-cyano-L-alanine, a reduction in vessel length and branching was observed, indicating that H(2)S serves as an endogenous stimulator of the angiogenic response. Stimulation of ECs with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) increased H(2)S release, while pharmacological inhibition of H(2)S production or K(ATP) channels or silencing of cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) attenuated VEGF signaling and migration of ECs. These results implicate endothelial H(2)S synthesis in the pro-angiogenic action of VEGF. Aortic rings isolated from CSE knockout mice exhibited markedly reduced microvessel formation in response to VEGF when compared to wild-type littermates. Finally, in vivo, topical administration of H(2)S enhanced wound healing in a rat model, while wound healing was delayed in CSE(-/-) mice. We conclude that endogenous and exogenous H(2)S stimulates EC-related angiogenic properties through a K(ATP) channel/MAPK pathway.", 
    "165": "Preoperative evaluation and perioperative management of cardiac disease in patients undergoing vascular surgery (VS) is important for patients and vascular surgeons. Recent evidence has emerged that has allowed us to develop contemporary paradigms for evaluating and managing coronary artery disease in VS patients perioperatively.", 
    "166": "The utility of stress testing, the role of preoperative coronary revascularization, the optimal use of beta-blockers and statins, and the role of antiplatelet therapy in VS patients were reviewed in the literature.", 
    "167": "The revised Lee cardiac risk index, based on the number of risk factors (high-risk surgery, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, renal failure, hypertension, and age >75) quantitates cardiac risk. Stress testing is not predictive of myocardial ischemia/infarction (MI) or death and is only recommended in patients with unstable angina or an active arrhythmia. Stress testing for patients with 0 to 2 risk factors delays VS up to 3 weeks. In high-risk patients (>or=3 risk factors), it helps to identify patients who may develop myocardial ischemia and would benefit from a 30-day period to optimize medical therapy before VS. Stress testing and coronary catheterization do not predict which coronary artery to revascularize to prevent MI or death. Revascularization does not decrease MI or death rates at 1 month or 6 years. Although beta-blocker treatment decreases cardiac risk with VS, timing and dosage (titration) influence outcomes, improper usage may increase stroke and death rate, and not all VS patients should be taking these drugs. Patients with >or=1 risk factor should be considered to begin a low dose beta-blocker 1 month before VS. Preoperative statin use sharply decreases MI, stroke, and death perioperatively and long-term postoperatively.", 
    "168": "Routine stress testing should not be performed before VS. The Lee index should be used to stratify risk in patients undergoing VS. Patients with >or=3 risk factors or active cardiac conditions should undergo stress testing, if VS can be delayed. All VS patients, except those with 0 risk factors, should be considered for a beta-blocker (bisoprolol, 2.5-5 mg/d started 1 month before VS, titrated to a pulse <70 beats/min and a systolic blood pressure >or=120 mm Hg). Intermediate risk factors may not require aggressive heart rate control but simply maintenance on a low-dose beta-blocker. Statins should be started (ideally 30 days) before all VS using long-acting formulations such as fluvastatin (80 mg/d) for patients unable to take oral medication.",

This may lead to the unmasking of a latent underlying cardiac condition or the new onset of maternal cardiovascular disease, with an attendant increase in adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Some women with pre-existing cardiac conditions may be receiving medications that need to be altered during pregnancy owing to a risk of adverse effects on the developing fetus, but for most cardiac conditions, there are safe and effective treatment options. Women should be educated that abrupt discontinuation of cardiac medications during pregnancy usually poses a greater risk than the medications themselves, and a plan of judicious drug selection should be implemented (ideally prior to conception).",

    "172": "This was an analysis of cross-sectional data from 61 primary care practices (377 439 patients) participating in the Scottish Continuous Morbidity Recording scheme. The prevalence of COPD in patients with HF increased from 19.8% in 1999 to 23.8% in 2004. In 2004, the prevalence was similar in men and women (24.8% vs. 22.9%, P = 0.09), increased with age up to 75 years, and increased with greater socioeconomic deprivation (most deprived 31.3% vs. least deprived 18.6%, P = 0.01). Contact rates for HF or COPD in those with both conditions were greater than disease-specific contact rates in patients with either condition alone. Although overall beta-blocker prescribing increased over time; the adjusted odds of beta-blocker prescription in patients with COPD was low and failed to improve [odds ratio 0.30 (0.28-0.32), P < 0.001]. In 2004, only 18% of individuals with HF and COPD were prescribed beta-blockers vs. 41% in those without COPD.",

    "174": "Most of the major advances in burn treatment were made within the last five decades. However, hypermetabolic response after severe burn remains a problem in the treatment of patients with massive burn. As skeletal muscle accounts for over 50% of body cell dry weight, its catabolism exerts profound effect on body metabolism as a whole. Main mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle wasting induced by severe burn include activation of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, bringing about breakdown of muscle protein, and myonuclear apoptosis. Therapeutic strategies for skeletal muscle wasting after burn mainly include maintenance of room temperature at (31.5 +/- 0.7) degrees C, early active and passive exercise of skeletal muscles, administration of beta adrenergic receptor blocker such as Propranolol, recombinant growth hormone, androgen, and insulin, which has lately been proven to possess the effect of suppressing myonuclear apoptosis after burn. Combination of multiple therapeutic strategies is beneficial in reducing complications of burn patients, particularly wide ranged skeletal muscle atrophy, to achieve a better clinical outcome.", 
    "175": "Dysregulation of autonomic nervous system function and impaired homogeneity of myocardial repolarization are 2 important mechanisms for the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias in nonalcoholic subjects. Our previous study suggested that acute ethanol withdrawal promoted the shift of cardiac sympathovagal balance toward sympathetic predominance and reduced the vagal tone, which were related to a higher incidence of ventricular arrhythmia and related death. However, the homogeneity of myocardial repolarization and its relation with the cardiac sympathovagal balance are unknown, especially in alcoholic subjects. The aim of the present study was to clarify these points.",

The cardiac sympathovagal balance and homogeneity of myocardial repolarization were evaluated based on the heart rate variability (HRV) and QT interval dispersion (QTd: dynamic changes in QT interval duration).", 
    "177": "The increase in QTd was observed only in rats at 1-day withdrawal, but not in nonalcoholic, continuous ethanol intake, and 1-day withdrawal with 7-day carvedilol pretreatment rats. At 1-day withdrawal, the low-frequency power/high-frequency power (LF/HF) ratio in HRV was elevated and correlated with the QTd. The increased QTd and elevated LF/HF ratio were normalized by the 7-day carvedilol pretreatment in rats at 1-day ethanol withdrawal.", 
    "178": "In rats with an abrupt termination of the chronic continuous ethanol intake, the homogeneity of myocardial repolarization impaired and correlated with the cardiac sympathovagal balance. Carvedilol pretreatment is associated with a reduction in both the QTd and LF/HF ratio, raising the possibility that the cardiac sympathovagal balance shift may be responsible for the impaired homogeneity of myocardial repolarization, and that beta-blocker pretreatment may decrease the mortality risk during alcoholic withdrawal."
