    "0": "1. The effects of six beta-adrenoceptive antagonists [(+/-)-propranolol, (+)-propranolol, (+/-)-sotalol, (+/-)-practolol, (+/-)-pindolol and (+/-)-procinolol] were studied on airway resistance and heart rate in guinea-pigs and dose-response curves constructed.2. All beta-adrenoceptive antagonists decreased heart rate and increased airway resistance. A significant correlation was found between the increase in airway resistance and the degree of bradycardia induced by all drugs except practolol. The orders of activity of the six drugs in inducing significant variations of the two parameters were respectively, for airway resistance: (+/-)-procinolol>(+/-)-pindolol>(+/-)-propranolol>(+/-)-sotalol>(+)-propranolol>(+/-)-practolol, and for heart rate: (+/-)-pindolol>(+/-)-procinolol>(+/-)-propranolol>(+/-)-sotalol>(+)-propranolol>(+/-)-practolol.3. (+/-)-Sotalol, (+/-)-pindolol and (+/-)-procinolol-induced changes in airway resistance and heart rate reached plateau values, which were not modified by increasing the dose. Since sotalol and procinolol have only very weak partial agonist and cardiac depressant properties, it appears that these changes can mainly be accounted for by the suppression of sympathetic tone. It is probable that this is also the case with pindolol.4. On the other hand, (+/-)-propranolol and (+)-propranolol induced dose-related changes in airway resistance and heart rate. Thus, a direct and non-specific effect of both drugs on the bronchial muscle, similar to that observed on the heart appears to be implicated, together with sympathetic tone suppression in these variations.5. (+/-)-Practolol-induced effects on airway resistance and heart rate were different from those observed with the five other beta-adrenoceptive antagonists.", 
    "1": "1. In the isolated rabbit ear vascular bed, perfused with Krebs solution, prostaglandins E(1) and F(2alpha) produce dose-dependent, phentolamine-sensitive constrictions.2. These are absent if the animal is pre-treated with reserpine or if the ear is denervated in advance.3. If noradrenaline or vasopressin is added to the Krebs solution, vascular resistance is high and PGE(1) and PGF(2alpha) produce vasodilatation which is unaffected by hyoscine or propranolol.4. Perfusion with theophylline, with added ATP, ADP or 3'5'-AMP, or pre-treatment of the animal with stilboestrol antagonizes the dilator response to PGE(1) in the presence of noradrenaline, which may be reversed. Most of the responses to PGF(2alpha) are reversed. These treatments elevate the level of 3'5'-AMP in tissues.5. It is postulated that prostaglandins exert a regulatory action on 3'5'-AMP levels through inhibition of adenyl cyclase and/or phosphodiesterase and that the resulting rising or falling level of 3'5'-AMP determines the nature of the response by the smooth muscle to the released noradrenaline.", 
    "2": "Catecholamines have several physiological effects on the kidney. These include: (a) stimulation of renin synthesis in the cortex: (b) antidiuresis by beta adrenergic agents; and (c) diuresis by alpha adrenergic stimulation. The role of cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in the renal actions of catecholamines was evaluated by measuring the effects of several adrenergic agents on cyclic AMP concentration in the dog kidney. Beta adrenergic activity increased cyclic AMP concentration in the renal cortex, a finding consistent with the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic stimulation augments renin synthesis by increasing cyclic AMP generation. Beta adrenergic stimulation, like vasopressin, increased cyclic AMP concentration in the renal medulla. This suggests that beta adrenergic stimulation causes antidiuresis by augmenting cyclic AMP generation in the renal medulla. Alpha adrenergic activity inhibited the effect of vasopressin to stimulate cyclic AMP generation. These results support the hypothesis that the diuretic effect of alpha adrenergic stimulation is mediated by inhibition of the effect of vasopressin to increase cyclic AMP generation.", 
    "3": "Propranolol, a blocking agent for the beta adrenergic receptor, produces a redistribution of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in the red cell. At concentrations of 3.3 x10(-5)M, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in the red cell membrane becomes unbound in vitro. The administration of propranolol to hunmns produces similar changes and results in a decrease in the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen.", 
    "4": "The ability of beta-adrenoceptor agonists to reduce the fusion of incomplete tetanic contractions of the soleus muscle of the cat has been used previously as a model to assess the potential tremor producing effect of sympathomimetic bronchodilators. The ability of (-)-isoprenaline, (-)-adrenaline, (+/-)-soterenol and (+/-)-quinterenol to depress incomplete tetanic contractions of the soleus has now been assessed using cumulative administration of the amines. The method quickly produced accurate and reproducible dose-response curves. It is particularly useful for evaluating the potency of long-acting compounds.", 
    "5": "In vitro treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), but not with oxidized 6-hydroxydopamine, caused transient, positive inotropic and chronotropic responses in the isolated rat atria. In the presence of rat blood plasma, the excitatory effect of 6-hydroxydopamine persisted unless the drug was washed out by fresh medium. 6-Hydroxydopamine failed to elicit the excitative response in the atria obtained from reserpinized rats or rats treated with 6-hydroxydopamine in vivo. In vitro treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine did not cause the development of supersensitivity to noradrenaline. Cocaine and desipramine, but not bretylium, inhibited the excitative action of 6-hydroxydopamine. No tachyphylaxis developed after repeated exposure to 6-hydroxydopamine in vitro. Propranolol, but not phentolamine, blocked the excitatory effect of 6-hydroxydopamine. It is thus concluded that in vitro treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine may cause atrial stimulation by an indirect action involving the release of catecholamines as a result of its displacement at the nerve ending.", 
    "6": "1. Dopamine produced vasoconstriction followed by secondary vasodilatation in the perfused cat hindquarters and splanchnic region. Low doses produced only vasodilatation in the splanchnic region.2. Phenoxybenzamine abolished, while despiramine and cocaine potentiated, the vasoconstrictor and secondary dilator actions of dopamine.3. After phenoxybenzamine, dopamine produced only vasodilatation in both the hindquarters and splanchnic region, being more effective in the latter.4. Haloperidol, but not propranolol, atropine or mepyramine, antagonized dopamine-induced vasodilatation.5. Dopamine differs from other catecholamines in that, while its cardiac effects are mediated by a beta-adrenoceptive mechanism, its vasodilator effects are not.6. The results support the concept of a specific receptor mediating dopamine vasodilatation."
