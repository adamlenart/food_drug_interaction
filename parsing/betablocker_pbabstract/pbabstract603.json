    "0": "The inotropic and chronotropic effects of protamine sulfate on rabbit myocardium were studied using isolated preparations of atrial and ventricular tissue. Each tissue differed markedly in its susceptibility to depression of peak isometric developed tension. The threshold concentration for depression of tension was 0.022% for left atrium, 0.055% for right atrium, and 0.3% for right ventricular papillary muscle. Tension in the left atrial preparation increased 20% over control at a protamine concentration of 0.02%, but decreased to less than 30% of control at a concentration of 0.022%. Right atrial tissue tension decreased to 48% of control at a protamine concentration of 0.055% and then to 17% of control at a concentration of 0.6%. In papillary muscle, tension decreased to 64% of control at a concentration of 0.3% and then to 9% of control at a concentration of 0.35%. Thus a very steep dose-response curve was observed for each tissue. In the right atrium-sinoatrial node preparation, administration of protamine at concentrations of 0.05-0.06% produced intermittent atrial extrasystoles, but no significant change in overall rate of discharge. The narrow margin of safety of the protamine dose-response curve may provide a partial explanation for the precipitous nature of hypotensive episodes during clinical administration.", 
    "1": "Studies were done to determine the mechanism whereby halothane inhibits the release of norepinephrine from postganglionic sympathetic nerve endings. Helical strips of dog saphenous vein were mounted for superfusion and measurement of isometric contractile tension in the presence or absence of halothane (1.2 or 2.5%). Endogenous norepinephrine overflowing in response to electrical stimulation (10 V, 2 Hz for 15 min), and the content of norepinephrine remaining in the veins after stimulation, were measured by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The data indicate that halothane decreased the stimulation-evoked release of norepinephrine by stimulation of prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors. Evidence was also obtained that halothane may impair clearance of norepinephrine from the synaptic cleft.", 
    "2": "Experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that acute hypertension caused by aortic baroreceptor deafferentation (ABD) is the result of sympathetic vasoconstriction. Cardiac output (CO), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were measured before and after ABD in anesthetized and conscious rats. The role of the sympathetic nervous system in acute ABD-induced hypertension was evaluated by examining the ability of adrenalectomy, adrenal demedullation, guanethidine or combined adrenal demedullation, and guanethidine pretreatment to prevent, and total autonomic blockade to reverse, ABD-induced hypertension. CO did not change significantly after ABD at any time, whereas MAP and TPR increased significantly (P less than 0.05). Only combined adrenal demedullation and guanethidine pretreatment prevented ABD-induced hypertension, and autonomic blockade normalized MAP in ABD rats. Normalization of blood pressure was the result of a decreased TPR. It is concluded that acute ABD-induced hypertension results from vasoconstriction caused by neurally released and/or circulating catecholamines.", 
    "3": "We treated two cases of severe envenomation by the scorpion Centruroides exilicauda. The first infant was treated with a species-specific scorpion antivenom, which produced a delayed but dramatic return of all vital signs to normal. A second infant was treated with two doses of intravenous propranolol hydrochloride and had a rapid, dramatic decrease in heart rate but only gradual resolution of neurologic symptoms. These cases demonstrate the severe symptoms of envenomation by this scorpion in the infant and show two possible treatments.", 
    "4": "Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may have the advantage of not depressing myocardial function and pulse rate at rest. Little is known about their effects during exercise. Thus, the effects of small and large doses of pindolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking drug with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, were compared with the effects of small and large doses of propranolol in 13 normal men during treadmill exercise. Compared with placebo, all drug regimens decreased exercise duration (p less than 0.001). There were no significant differences in duration between pindolol and propranolol, or between the small and large dose of each drug. Maximal oxygen consumption tended to be lower with all preparations compared with placebo (p less than 0.10). With smaller doses, decrements of maximal heart rate (HR) and HR-blood pressure (BP) product were equivalent for pindolol and propranolol (decreases of 46 vs 43 beats/min, and 13,000 vs 12,000 units). The HR-BP product decreased more with high-dose propranolol than high-dose pindolol (decrease of 18,000 vs 14,800 units) due to a greater decrement in HR with propranolol (decrease of 65 +/- 3 vs 53 +/- 3 beats/min). At both submaximal levels, for both low- and high-dose preparations, HR, BP and HR-BP product were lower for propranolol than for pindolol. Thus, in healthy subjects, pindolol and propranolol at doses that produced equivalent reductions in maximal oxygen consumption, exercise duration and, for the smaller dose, HR, had different effects on submaximal HR-BP product, an index of myocardial oxygen consumption, as a result of a higher HR and BP with pindolol.", 
    "5": "Hyperthyroid patients in the postabsorptive state have elevated levels of blood glycerol and ketone bodies (KB): this is believed to be due to increased lipolysis and ketogenesis. These increased glycerol and KB levels return toward normal after oral propranolol administration. In order to investigate the mechanism of action of propranolol in hyperthyroid patients, we compared the effects of the oral administration of propranolol with those of timolol, propylthiouracil (PTU), and a placebo. The placebo had no effect. The free thyroxine index, immunoreactive insulin level and glucagon level were not modified by propranolol, timolol, or PTU. Propranolol decreased the pulse rate (P less than 0.01) and the levels of serum triiodothyronine (T3; P less than 0.05), blood glycerol (P less than 0.01), and KB (P less than 0.01). Like propranolol, timolol decreased the pulse rate (P less than 0.01) but had no effect on the T3, glycerol, or KB levels. Propylthiouracil did not modify the pulse rate, but like propranolol, it decreased the T3 (P less than 0.05), glycerol (P less than 0.01) and KB (P less than 0.01) levels. These results suggest that the metabolic actions of propranolol are not caused by its hemodynamic effects nor its beta-blocking properties but are mediated by the decrease of the T3 level.", 
    "6": "Twenty-four subjects with mild to moderate essential hypertension completed this 9-wk parallel, randomized, double-blind study of the antihypertensive effects of verapamil (V) (240 to 480 mg%) and propranolol (P) (120 to 360 mg%). V lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressures in all postural positions, with an average reduction of 20/16 mm Hg. With the exception of standing systolic blood pressure, P also lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressures in all postural positions, with an average reduction of 9/11 mm Hg. Differences between V and P were significant only for sitting systolic blood pressure. Heart rate was decreased by P but was not affected by V. The PR interval was prolonged by V. Plasma levels of V and P were directly related to dose. Plasma levels of V were linearly related to those of its major metabolite, norverapamil (r = 0.81). There was no correlation between clinical response and the dose or plasma level of V or P, but all subjects who received 480 mg% V had an average blood pressure reduction of 20/16 mm Hg and plasma levels of the parent drug above 200 ng/ml. V is an effective antihypertensive for mild to moderate essential hypertension. Constipation, pedal edema, and a maculopapular rash were reported as side effects of V.", 
    "7": "Ten patients with the long QT syndrome and recurrent syncope and/or cardiac arrest caused by ventricular arrhythmias underwent left stellate (one patient) or left cervicothoracic sympathectomy (nine patients) after failing to respond to high-dose beta-blocker therapy. The syndrome was familial in four and idiopathic in six. All patients had a prolonged resting QT interval (548 +/- 51 msec, mean +/- SD) and corrected QT interval (QTc) (556 +/- 43 msec). After sympathectomy the mean QTc shortened significantly from 556 +/- 43 to 508 +/- 65 msec (p less than .05) but the QTc remained abnormal in all but one patient. Over a mean follow-up period of 38.6 +/- 19 months, eight patients developed recurrent symptoms that included cardiac arrest in three (one fatal, two nonfatal), syncope in four, and presyncope in six. The addition of beta-blockers was ineffective in suppressing the recurrent symptoms. The control of symptoms required more extensive sympathectomy (three patients), chronic atrial pacing (three patients), and implantation of an automatic internal defibrillator (one patient). Only one patient has remained asymptomatic without drug or pacemaker therapy. In conclusion, left cervicothoracic sympathectomy proved inadequate for long-term control of symptoms in most patients with the long QT syndrome. These patients usually required concomitant drugs, more extensive surgery, or long-term cardiac pacing for symptomatic relief.", 
    "8": "In the isolated, blood-perfused, canine right atrium, stimulation of the intramural autonomic nerves evoked negative chronotropic and inotropic responses. The responses were not maintained at a constant level during tonic neural stimulation, but they tended to drift back toward their control levels. These time-dependent changes in the cardiac responses were more pronounced the higher the frequency of stimulation. After the beta-adrenergic receptors were blocked in half of the preparations, the negative cardiac responses to autonomic neural stimulation were more pronounced, but the time dependency of those responses was less. After the muscarinic receptors were blocked in the other half of the preparations, only positive responses to neural stimulation were observed. These responses faded significantly at a high stimulation frequency (30 Hz), but not at a lower frequency (5 Hz). The cardiac responses to combined autonomic neural stimulation were substantially more negative than the algebraic sum of the individual responses to sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation. The extent of this interaction was most pronounced near the beginning of stimulation, but it became less pronounced as the stimulation progressed. Hence, the cardiac sympathetic-parasympathetic interactions change appreciably with time during a continuous train of autonomic neural stimulation.", 
    "9": "The capacity of human liver microsomes from 28 individuals to metabolize debrisoquine and bufuralol, two drugs oxidized polymorphically in humans, as well as the carcinogen 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF), was determined. In addition, the cytochrome P-450 content and the capacity of these microsomes to carry out the epoxidation of aldrin were measured. Interindividual differences in debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation, bufuralol 1-hydroxylation, and aldrin epoxidation were 12-, 20-, and 2.4-fold, respectively. The metabolism of debrisoquine was not correlated with cytochrome P-450 content (r = 0.26), whereas both the metabolism of bufuralol (r = 0.45; r2 = 0.20) and the epoxidation of aldrin (r = 0.72; r2 = 0.52) were correlated. Rates of debrisoquine and bufuralol metabolism were significantly correlated (r = 0.73), whereas only weak correlations existed between debrisoquine:aldrin (r = 0.49) and bufuralol:aldrin (r = 0.51). Because biphasic kinetics have been observed in human liver microsomes for the 7- and 5-hydroxylation of AAF, two concentrations of this substrate were used. The disappearance of AAF at either 0.37 or 50 microM was not correlated with debrisoquine, bufuralol, or aldrin metabolism. Similarly, at 0.37 microM AAF, no correlation existed between the formation of N-, 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-hydroxylation products of AAF and debrisoquine, bufuralol, or aldrin metabolism. At 50 microM AAF, only the 7-hydroxylation of this substrate correlated with bufuralol metabolism (r = 0.47). This lack of, or weak correlation between pathways leading to metabolic activation (N-hydroxylation) or detoxication (C-hydroxylation) of the carcinogen AAF and debrisoquine, bufuralol, and aldrin metabolism strongly suggests that different forms of cytochrome P-450 are involved in these pathways. In contrast, exceptionally high correlations (r greater than 0.94) existed between N-OH-AAF:1-OH-AAF. N-OH-AAF:7-OH-AAF, and 7-OH-AAF:1-OH-AAF at the low concentration of AAF, and imply that similar forms of cytochrome P-450 produce these metabolites. However, at 50 microM AAF, these correlations are considerably weaker and explain less than 35% of the variance in the data. It is concluded, based on these multiple cross-correlations, that common cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes are involved in the formation of AAF metabolites, while the metabolism of debrisoquine, bufuralol, and aldrin is unrelated to the metabolism of this carcinogen in human liver microsomes.", 
    "10": "Action potentials and ECGs were recorded from Langendorff perfused guinea pig hearts during ischaemia and reperfusion. Arrhythmias were significantly more frequent during low flow (10% of control) than zero flow ischaemia and were most frequent during reperfusion following 30 minute ischaemia. Arrhythmias during low flow ischaemia were preceded by spontaneous recovery in action potential amplitude and Vmax and marked shortening of refractory period which did not occur during zero flow ischaemia. Reperfusion VF was always preceded by further shortening of the action potential. Myocardial catecholamine depletion, by pre-treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine significantly reduced the incidence of arrhythmias during ischaemia and reperfusion. Catecholamine depletion blunted the ischaemia-induced reduction in action potential amplitude and Vmax, prevented any spontaneous recovery and abolished reperfusion induced shortening of action potential duration. Methoxamine given to catecholamine-depleted hearts, having only minor effects during normal perfusion, significantly reversed the anti-arrhythmic and electrophysiological effects of catecholamine depletion during ischaemia and reperfusion. Phentolamine and propranolol in anti-arrhythmic concentrations, profoundly modified the electrophysiological effects of ischaemia and reperfusion. These results suggest that release of endogenous myocardial catecholamines contributes through alpha and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation to the electrophysiological changes and arrhythmias during myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion.", 
    "11": "The effects of physical exercise on plasma ionized calcium, total serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations were evaluated in healthy subjects submitted to work on an ergometer bicycle. When the workload was increased stepwise there was a significant increase (P less than 0.001) in the calcium concentrations (ionized calcium from 1.13 +/- 0.03 (SD) to 1.24 +/- 0.03 mmol 1(-1) and total calcium from 2.35 +/- 0.07 to 2.48 +/- 0.07 mmol 1(-1] when the workload exceeded approximately 65% of the estimated maximum--i.e. a load that caused accumulation in blood of lactic acid. The rise in plasma ionized calcium was, therefore, presumably largely attributed to the acidosis but reduction of plasma volume and influx from extracellular sources might also have contributed. Beta blockade (with oral intake of propranolol) reduced physical capacity, shortened the duration of work and caused less acidosis. These factors were probably responsible for a smaller rise in ionized calcium during beta blockade (7 +/- 4%) than in control studies (21 +/- 5%) without medication in subjects examined during short-term maximal exercise. Long-term (1 h) steady-state work which caused fatigue without producing lactic acidosis did not affect the calcium concentrations. Despite the effects of work on calcium levels there was no discernible suppression of the PTH concentrations. This might have been due to a concomitant stimulation of PTH secretion by work.", 
    "12": "In 44 sportsmen under maximal physical loads, the maximal O2 transport was effectively maintained by different modes of the circulation. The optimal mode is: Q = 2.9 + 5.43 VO2 + 0.61 V2O2 - 0.099 V3O2 (where Q is the minute blood volume; VO2--oxygen consumption). This mode involves proportional contributions of the central and the peripheral mechanisms of the organism O2 supply. The expressive mode involves increased O consumption and minute blood volume (on the average 37.72 +/- 3.0 l/min), and a relatively small arterial-venous difference (on the average 141.5 +/- 13.1 ml/l). The reduced mode of circulation involves relatively small values of the minute blood volume (on the average 29.76 +/- 1.64 l/min) and an obvious increase of the arterial-venous difference in oxygen (on the average 180.9 +/- 14.3 ml/l). Formation of one or another hemodynamic mode is related to an individual blood volume velocity. In particularly high values of the minute blood volume, the O2 transfer from capillaries is limited by the flow. A relative decrease of the minute blood volume increases the contacting time of the blood with muscle tissues aiding to excessive extraction of O2 and thereby increasing the arterial-venous difference.", 
    "13": "Loss of hearing in a 43 year old man during treatment with metoprolol was dose related and disappeared within a few months after the drug had been stopped. The hearing impairment was of mixed type, with an air bone gap without any disorder of the middle ear observable by conventional clinical methods. Similar scattered reports from international sources on loss of hearing during treatment with beta blockers are also presented.", 
    "14": "Using 86Rb+ as a marker for K+ permeability, we find that extracellular Ca-EGTA influences the rate of 86Rb+ efflux from erythrocyte ghosts preloaded with 86Rb+ and \"buffered\" Ca2+. At an internal free Ca2+, where the rate of 86Rb+ efflux is minimal and uninfluenced by either external EGTA or external Ca2+, external Ca-EGTA at 0.2-0.5 mM can raise the flux rate to as high as can be attained by raising internal Ca2+, in the presence of an excess externally either of Ca2+ or of EGTA. Higher concentrations of Ca-EGTA (up to 1-2 mM) diminish the flux rate. External Ca-EDTA or Mg-EDTA can substitute for Ca-EGTA in enhancing and suppressing flux rate. The peak rate is insensitive to external free Ca2+ but depends on internal Ca2+; internal Mg-EDTA does not substitute for internal Ca-EGTA. Thus, the erythrocyte membrane is asymmetric with respect to its interaction with Ca2+ and Ca-EGTA. Also, 22Na+ does not substitute for 86Rb+. The peak rate of 86Rb+ flux produced by external Ca-EGTA is diminished by chlorpromazine (0.1 mM) and augmented by 1-propranolol (25 microM), in the same way as the rate produced by increasing internal Ca2+. The results suggest that external Ca-EGTA enhances the affinity of internal Ca2+ for its receptor(s) which operate the K+-gate at the inner surface of the membrane. At external concentrations of Ca-EGTA above 1-2 mM, 86Rb+ flux rate again rises with increase of Ca-EGTA. This phenomenon does not depend upon internal Ca2+, is not affected by chlorpromazine or by 1-propranolol, and is associated with an enhanced permeability to 22Na+, inulin, and haemoglobin.", 
    "15": "Variations in renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in experimentally induced hyperthyroidism were studied. The changes observed in the RAAS in these conditions, evaluated through the plasma renin activity (PRA), are parallel to serum aldosterone concentration (AC). An increase in PRA and AC is produced following the administration of triiodothyronine, possibly through elevated adrenergic activity: beta-blocker, propranolol, returned the PRA and AC to normal. The active hormone is seen to be triiodothyronine, confirmed by using the antithyroid preparation, propylthiouracil, to inhibit the conversion of thyroxine. Propylthiouracil administration to hyperthyroid animals lowers the PRA and AC.", 
    "16": "The antihypertensive effects of timolol administered once daily and a combination diuretic were compared in 45 young and middle-aged hypertensive patients. Both treatments significantly reduced lying and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressures as compared to placebo. There were no significant differences between blood pressure reductions after treatment with timolol or with the diuretic. There was a slight negative correlation between the decrease of diastolic blood pressure during timolol treatment and patient age. Serum potassium decreased slightly but significantly during treatment with the diuretic.", 
    "17": "To determine the combined ocular hypotensive effect of topical betaxolol hydrochloride and oral acetazolamide, we conducted a three-week clinical trial of the concurrent administration of the two drugs. One drop of betaxolol hydrochloride 0.5% every 12 hours effected a mean reduction in outflow pressure from baseline of 27.3%. When given topically to both eyes of a patient pretreated with oral acetazolamide (500 mg every 12 hours), betaxolol caused an additional mean outflow pressure decrease of 17.6%. Acetazolamide, 500 mg orally every 12 hours, produced a mean outflow pressure reduction from baseline of 42.5%. When added to the therapy regimen of a patient already receiving topical betaxolol, oral acetazolamide caused an additional mean outflow pressure decrease of 35.1%. Our study supports the clinical usefulness of concurrent administration of betaxolol and acetazolamide to lower intraocular pressure.", 
    "18": "Patients with glaucoma received either 3% guanethidine-0.5% epinephrine (20 patients) or 1% guanethidine-0.2% epinephrine (20 patients) and then 0.5% timolol maleate. The fall in intraocular pressure during 3% guanethidine-0.5% epinephrine therapy (10.1 mm Hg [34.4%] reduction) was higher than during timolol therapy (7.5 mm Hg [25.5%] reduction) and the response to 1% guanethidine-0.2% epinephrine therapy (7.9 mm Hg [29%] reduction) equaled the response to timolol (7.3 mm Hg [26.8%] reduction). During 3% guanethidine-0.5% epinephrine therapy, 24 (67.7%) of 36 eyes had an average IOP lower than 22 mm Hg, compared with 16 (44.4%) of 36 timolol-treated eyes. With 1% guanethidine-0.2% epinephrine, IOP in 27 (73%) of 37 eyes was less than 22 mm Hg v 23 (62.2%) of 37 timolol-treated eyes. Both guanethidine-epinephrine formulations increased outflow facility. Since timolol produced few side effects, it appears to be the therapy of choice. However, in patients who do not respond sufficiently to timolol, both guanethidine-epinephrine formulations are potent alternatives.", 
    "19": "In a patient with severe hypertension in association with insulin-induced hypoglycemia and prior therapy with propranolol hydrochloride, intravenous 50% dextrose significantly reduced arterial pressure on two occasions. Subsequent reduction of arterial pressure was observed with prazosin hydrochloride, an alpha-receptor antagonist. The hypertensive episode may have been caused by hypoglycemia stimulating excessive release of epinephrine. In the presence of vascular beta 2-receptor blockade by propranolol, the hypertensive action of epinephrine was mediated by vascular alpha-receptors. When beta-antagonists must be used in insulin-dependent diabetic patients, beta 1-selective antagonists appear to be a better choice.", 
    "20": "A double-blind crossover trial of atenolol and chlorthalidone was done in black Jamaican hypertensive patients. After an initial four weeks of single drug therapy, the beta blocker and thiazide diuretic were used in combination. Chlorthalidone at a daily dose of 25 mg produced a significant (P less than .05) fall in the mean systolic and diastolic pressures (19.4 mm Hg and 12.2 mm Hg, respectively); atenolol produced a significant fall in the diastolic blood pressure (6.5 mm Hg); and combination therapy produced a reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (27.8 mm Hg and 17.8 mm Hg, respectively). The study showed that combination therapy using a low dose of thiazide diuretic and a beta blocker was synergetic, but that a thiazide was more effective than a beta blocker in lowering the blood pressure in black hypertensive patients.", 
    "21": "The effects of adrenergic blockers on the glucagon response to insulin hypoglycemia were investigated in diabetic (10-15 days poststreptozocin [STZ] injection) and age-matched control rats. alpha-(Phentolamine nonspecific but predominantly alpha 1), alpha 2-(yohimbine), or beta-(propranolol) adrenergic blockers alone or in combination did not affect plasma glucose levels or plasma glucagon concentrations, in the basal state, in either control or diabetic rats. None of these adrenergic blockers, alone or in combination, inhibited the glucagon response to insulin hypoglycemia in control or diabetic rats. On the contrary, in control rats, the beta-adrenergic blocker alone or in combination with an alpha-adrenergic blocker and in diabetic rats, the alpha-adrenergic blocker alone significantly stimulated the glucagon response to insulin hypoglycemia. Second, the effects of yohimbine on the glucagon response to epinephrine infusion were studied in both young and old rats. Recently, Cherksey et al. (Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1982; 171:196-200) have reported that the adrenergic receptors on rat pancreatic islet cells are of the alpha 2-subtype. Yohimbine (alpha 2-adrenergic blocker) completely blocked the glucagon response to epinephrine infusion in both young and old rats, but had no inhibitory effect on the glucagon response to insulin hypoglycemia in control and short-term diabetic rats. From these observations, it could be inferred that the lack of glucagon response to insulin hypoglycemia in long-term diabetic rats is unlikely to be explained by an impairment of an adrenergic function.", 
    "22": "Twenty patients undergoing a coronary artery bypass grafting operation with high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia, all on long-term metoprolol medication, were randomly divided into a metoprolol group (last metoprolol dose given 1.5 h before the anaesthesia) and a control group (last metoprolol dose 12 h before the anaesthesia). Haemodynamics were measured and the ECG was recorded serially in order to compare the responses to the anaesthesia induction and skin incision in these two groups and to evaluate possible harmful effects of the maintained metoprolol medication. The ECG showed ischaemic signs in five control group patients during the anaesthesia induction; these patients also had a relatively high rate-pressure product. No metoprolol group patient developed ECG changes indicative of ischaemia at this stage, despite a low plasma metoprolol concentration in two patients. Surgical stimulation caused no signs of myocardial ischaemia in either group. There were no inter-group differences in the haemodynamics or oxygen transportation. No harmful effects of the maintained metoprolol on the post-bypass cardiac performance nor on the occurrence of rhythm or conduction disturbances could be seen, although a high plasma metoprolol concentration was maintained in several metoprolol group patients over the bypass time. It is concluded that continuation of long-term metoprolol medication up to 1.5 h before high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia for coronary artery bypass grafting has no harmful effects on the haemodynamics during the operation or the restoration of the cardiac function after the cardiopulmonary bypass, but it evidently does help to maintain the myocardial oxygen supply/demand balance during the anaesthesia induction.", 
    "23": "In both two-kidney, one clip renal hypertensive rats (RHR) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with myocardial hypertrophy, inotropic responsiveness to adenylate cyclase mediated agonists, such as isoproterenol and glucagon is decreased, as is the responsiveness to phenylephrine acting via alpha 1 adrenergic receptors. However, defects in the excitation response pathway differ in the two hypertensive models. In SHR beta-adrenergic receptors are decreased, alpha 1 receptors increased, cyclase activity is unchanged but c-AMP stimulated protein kinase is decreased. In RHR beta-receptors are increased, alpha 1 receptors decreased, adenylate cyclase activity decreased due to decreased nucleotide regulatory protein activity, and microsomal cAMP stimulated protein kinase is increased. We conclude that, although functional changes in hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy are similar, the underlying biochemical alterations are different. The shift in balance between alpha- and beta-adrenergic pathways may be a compensatory mechanism and play a role in the pathophysiology of cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "24": "Intracellular recordings were obtained from neurones of isolated guinea-pig inferior mesenteric ganglia. Repetitive stimulation (10-20 Hz for 1-2 s) of the hypogastric nerves evoked, in addition to the fast excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.), a non-cholinergic e.p.s.p. the mediator of which has previously been suggested to be substance P or a related peptide. When applied to the ganglia in the concentrations of 1-100 microM for 3-5 min, adrenaline, isoprenaline and noradrenaline produced an initial, short-lasting depression which was followed by a marked augmentation of the non-cholinergic e.p.s.p. lasting from minutes to over hours. Employed in comparable concentrations dopamine caused a slight depression that was not followed by a detectable increase of the non-cholinergic e.p.s.p. The catecholamine-induced depression and subsequent enhancement of the non-cholinergic e.p.s.p. was prevented by alpha-adrenergic antagonists (dihydroergotamine and phenoxybenzamine, 1-10 microM) and beta-adrenergic antagonists (propranolol and dichlorisoprenaline, 5-10 microM), respectively. The membrane depolarization induced by the putative transmitter substance P (1 microM) was augmented by isoprenaline; the enhancement which could be blocked by beta-antagonists was not preceded by a depression. Application of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10 microM-1 mM) by either superfusion or intracellular ionophoresis mimicked the enhancing effect of catecholamines. It is concluded that catecholamines, with the noticeable exception of dopamine, exerted a biphasic effect on the non-cholinergic e.p.s.p. of the inferior mesenteric ganglion cells: an initial depression that was mediated by alpha-adrenergic receptors and probably reflected a presynaptic inhibitory effect of catecholamines and, on the other hand, an enduring facilitation mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors which appeared to be linked to activation of post-ganglionic cyclic AMP.", 
    "25": "Rabbit ileal mucosa, when mounted in a flux chamber and stimulated with a 5 Hz electrical field (EFS), secretes Cl, a change reflected in an increase in short circuit current (Iac). Because the EFS response is eliminated by agents which prevent neural transmission, the mediator is most likely a neurotransmitter present in nerves lying close to the secreting epithelium. To identify the chemical mediators of the response, we determined the effects of receptor antagonists, agonist desensitization and other agents on the Isc response to EFS. Because of the failure of antagonists or desensitization to affect the response to EFS, we eliminated the following agents as possible mediators: acetylcholine (pre- and postganglionic), norepinephrine, dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, histamine, prostaglandins, adenosine triphosphate, bombesin, neurotensin and Substance P. Pyrilamine, diphenhydramine and cyproheptadine in high concentration (0.1 mM) reduced markedly the Isc response to EFS for reasons unrelated to histamine antagonism. Although acetylcholine has been shown in the ileum of humans and of guinea pigs to mediate up to half of the Isc response to EFS, the identity of the mediator(s) in rabbit ileum remains unknown.", 
    "26": "When APCs are symptomatic or are a potential trigger for supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation, suppressive therapy with beta-blocking drugs or type I antiarrhythmic agents is indicated. If APCs are infrequent and produce no symptoms, attention to possible provocative factors--excess tobacco or caffeine, or drugs (eg, sympathomimetic amines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants)--is all that is required.", 
    "27": "The justification for drug treatment of mild hypertension rests upon epidemiological data demonstrating an increased risk of heart attack and stroke and a very small number of controlled clinical trials. These data provide a slender basis for mass treatment and leave many vital questions unanswered. The incidence of stroke (and heart attack in some countries) appears to be falling irrespective of antihypertensive therapy. Are historic epidemiological findings still relevant? The level of diastolic blood pressure where risk begins to increase appears to be about 95 mmHg. Ought this also to be the target value for blood pressure reduction? Do thiazide diuretics have added risks and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs added benefits over and above their effect upon blood pressure? If the MRC Hypertension trial turns out to be the last of the big placebo controlled trials in hypertension how shall we assess the effects of new types of drugs upon outcome?", 
    "28": "Antihypertensive drugs act centrally (methyldopa, clonidine, guanabenz), peripherally (prazosin, guanadrel, guanethedine, hydralazine, minoxidil), centrally and peripherally (beta-adrenergic blocking drugs) and systemically [angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics]. Centrally-acting antihypertensives decrease blood pressure by diminishing sympathetic outflow from the vasomotor centre. Peripherally-acting antihypertensives act by depleting or inhibiting the release of catecholamines from the peripheral nerve ending or altering the response at alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptor sites. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs act through a variety of mechanisms by either decreasing cardiac output, decreasing renin release, inhibiting prejunctional release of norepinephrine or through central mechanisms. Diuretics act as indirect vasodilators by depleting salt and water not only within the intravascular compartment but within the intramural portion of the arteriole, thereby diminishing its responsiveness to catecholamine and angiotensin II stimulation. ACE inhibitors such as captopril and enalapril act by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II thereby decreasing the vasoconstrictor effect of angiotensin II and the aldosterone production secondary to angiotensin II stimulation. The main differences between captopril and enalapril is that enalapril does not possess the potentially toxic sulphydryl group and can be given twice-daily. Both drugs may show accumulation in patients with impaired renal function.", 
    "29": "The effects, on the development of a raised blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats, of bilateral adrenal demedullation and subcutaneous slow-release implants containing adrenaline, salbutamol and procaterol were studied. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurements were made, using an indirect tail-cuff method in groups of male SHR rats aged from three to 14 weeks, which were sham-operated or bilaterally adrenal demedullated under ether anaesthesia at four weeks of age. Bilateral adrenal demedullation attenuated the development of a raised blood pressure, while slow-release implants of adrenaline restored the development of hypertension in adrenal demedullated rats and this effect was abolished by concomitant treatment with the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist [C] 118551. Implants of salbutamol and procaterol were also effective in restoring hypertension development in adrenal demedullated rats. It is suggested that adrenaline exerts its pro-hypertensive effects via an action at beta 2-adrenoceptors; possibly those located prejunctionally which are involved in the facilitation of sympathetic neurotransmission.", 
    "30": "Mean hair zinc was found to be significantly lower in 20 mild hypertensive patients treated with thiazides for 6-36 months than in 19 mild hypertensive patients who had not been given diuretics for at least six months before study. Mean serum zinc did not differ significantly between the two groups. Chronic diuretic treatment can result in zinc deficiency through enhanced urinary excretion of zinc.", 
    "31": "Mental stress may directly influence coronary heart disease (CHD) and also a number of its etiologic risk factors. Research work carried out by the Psychopharmacology Research Group in the United Kingdom indicates that antianxiety drugs may have an application in the management of the stress factors influencing CHD. In one study there was a significant reduction in the glyceryl trinitrate requirements of patients treated with a tranquilizer, but this result was not confirmed in two other studies. However, out of a total of 77 patients treated with a placebo, there were five cases of myocardial infarction during the trial periods as compared to no such cases among 81 patients treated with the antianxiety drugs.", 
    "32": "Studies in cats suggest alpha-adrenergic contributions to arrhythmias during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. The validity of this concept in other species, however, remains uncertain. Thus, 106 chloralose-anesthetized open-chest dogs undergoing a 25 min coronary artery occlusion followed by reperfusion received saline (n = 52), prazosin (1 mg/kg, n = 26), phentolamine (5 mg/kg, n = 18), or phentolamine (same dose) + propranolol (1 mg/kg, n = 10). Alpha-blockade was confirmed by alpha-agonist dose-response studies. In phentolamine-treated dogs, arterial pressure and heart rate were kept constant to prevent exacerbation of ischemia. Control and treated groups were comparable with respect to variables known to affect arrhythmias, such as size of occluded and reperfused vascular beds, coronary collateral flow, severity of ischemia estimated from intramyocardial CO2 tension, and peak reactive hyperemia. During coronary occlusion, the number of single premature ventricular complexes was reduced by phentolamine (P less than 0.01), but not by prazosin or phentolamine + propranolol; no treatment affected the total number of couplets, ventricular tachycardia episodes and ventricular ectopic complexes, or the incidence of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. During coronary reperfusion, arrhythmias did not differ in control and treated groups. Thus, selective alpha 1-(prazosin), nonselective alpha 1- and alpha 2-(phentolamine), and combined alpha- and beta-blockade (phentolamine + propranolol) failed to attenuate complex arrhythmias induced by acute myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Alpha-adrenergic mechanisms appear unimportant in the genesis of these arrhythmias in the canine model.", 
    "33": "The actions of the hexoprenaline, salbutamol and terbutaline on adrenalin-induced effects in the human artery were studied in vitro. The human uterine artery has a two-part response to adrenalin: The first, rapid (phasic component), and the second, slow and sustained (tonic component). Both beta-2 stimulators relax the tonic component and reduced the amplitude of the phasic component. The depressor effect of the responses to adrenalin is reduced in the presence of butoxamine and intensified in the presence of caffeine. These results suggest the existence on the human uterine artery of beta-2 adrenergic receptors acting as mediators of smooth muscle relaxation, and suggest also that the mechanism of this relaxation is most likely cAMP dependent.", 
    "34": "Dynorphin A (DYN) (1 microM) decreased somatic calcium-dependent action potential (CAP) duration of a portion of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in a naloxone reversible manner. Responses to DYN differed from responses to Leu-enkephalin in that only DYN decreases of somatic CAP duration were associated with decreased action potential after hyperpolarization and persisted after intracellular injection of the potassium channel blocker cesium. While Leu-enkephalin at 10 microM did not affect somatic CAP duration of DRG neurons impaled with cesium-filled micropipettes, dynorphin A (1-8), dynorphin B, and beta-neoendorphin were effective at 1 microM. During single electrode voltage clamp, DYN decreased inward current in a portion of DRG neurons under conditions that predominately isolated calcium current. Leak current was unaffected by dynorphin A. Therefore, we suggest that DYN decreases voltage-dependent calcium conductance. The action on calcium conductance appears specific for opioids with affinity for kappa-receptors.", 
    "35": "In isolated tissue from the human corpus spongiosum urethrae (CS) the effects of adrenoreceptor and muscarinic receptor active drugs on release of 3H-noradrenaline (NA) from noradrenergic nerves and on isometric tension were investigated. The electrically induced release of 3H was reduced by clonidine (alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agonist), increased by rauwolscine (alpha 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist), and little affected by phenylephrine (alpha 1-adrenoreceptor agonist) and prazosin (alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist). Isoprenaline (beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoreceptor agonist) and procaterol (beta 2-adrenoreceptor agonist) increased the release, propranolol (beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist) reduced it, and prenalterol (beta 1-adrenoreceptor agonist) and atenolol (beta 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist) had no effect. Carbachol (muscarinic receptor agonist) decreased and scopolamine (muscarinic receptor antagonist) increased stimulation-induced efflux of 3H. NA, phenylephrine and clonidine contracted isolated CS preparations, clonidine being less potent and having less intrinsic activity than phenylephrine. Prazosin was more effective than rauwolscine for inhibition of NA-induced contractions, and prazosin, but not rauwolscine, abolished electrically induced contractions. Isoprenaline and procaterol, but not prenalterol, relaxed NA-contracted preparations. These relaxations could be blocked by propranolol but not by atenolol. Acetylcholine and carbachol relaxed NA-contracted preparations but had no contractant effect on any of the preparations tested. The results suggest that prejunctionally in the human CS, the alpha-adrenoreceptors are of alpha 2-type and the beta-adrenoreceptors of beta 2-type. Postjunctionally, the main alpha-adrenoreceptor function seems to be of alpha 1-type and the beta-adrenoreceptor function of beta 2-type. Stimulation of muscarinic receptors may inhibit the effects of NA both by decreasing its release from noradrenergic nerves and by counteracting its postjunctional effects.", 
    "36": "The effects of separate 1 week pre-treatments with each of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, propranolol (80 mg every 12 h), metoprolol (100 mg every 12 h) and atenolol (50 mg once daily), on the disposition of a single i.v. dose of tolbutamide were studied in six healthy volunteers. In addition, the effects of a 1 week pre-treatment with metoprolol (100 mg every 12 h) and atenolol (50 mg once daily) on the disposition of orally and i.v. administered lignocaine were determined in seven healthy subjects. Tolbutamide clearance, half-life, volume of distribution and plasma protein binding were not altered by the beta-adrenoceptor blocker pre-treatments. Similarly, neither metoprolol nor atenolol had a significant effect on the systemic clearance, apparent oral clearance or other dispositional parameters of lignocaine. 'Therapeutic' plasma concentrations of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers were confirmed on each study day. It is concluded that the inhibition of oxidative drug metabolism previously reported for lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor blockers may be selective for different forms of cytochrome P450 and possible concentration-dependent.", 
    "37": "The objective of this placebo controlled double-blind multicentre (six centres) trial was to investigate the safety and efficacy of ICI 141,292 (Visacor), a new selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with modest intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), in hypertensive patients. Fifty-nine patients with mild essential hypertension were randomized to two of five treatment alternatives (placebo, 50 mg, 100 mg 200 mg or 300 mg of ICI 141,292) each given once daily for 2 weeks with a 4 week placebo period before (run in) and in between (wash out) active periods. Thus, each of the five treatments was evaluated in 20-24 patients. After 2 weeks (24 h after last dose) the reduction in recumbent blood pressure for all doses except 50 mg of ICI 141,292 was statistically significant and in the order of 6/4 mm Hg. Standing systolic blood pressure was reduced in a dose-dependent way but only significant for 200 mg of ICI 141,292 (8 mm Hg). Heart rate changes (delta) less than 4 beats/min) were not statistically significant for any dose. It is concluded that ICI 141,292 was well tolerated and had a significant but weak antihypertensive effect which might be explained by too much beta 1-adrenoceptor ISA.", 
    "38": "The effects of propranolol 80 mg orally were compared with those of placebo on the response to a stepwise increasing exercise test in 17 healthy and physically untrained volunteers, of whom eight were female. Propranolol showed no significant effects on maximum work rate or perceived exertion rate. However, submaximal O2 uptake, CO2 output and minute ventilation tended to be lower after propranolol than after placebo. It is concluded that in subjects with a low work capacity, beta-adrenoceptor blockade does not impair maximal exercise capacity. The mechanisms underlying changes in respiratory response to exercise after propranolol are not fully explained. However, changes in substrate utilisation, the reduction in cardiac output and an alteration in respiratory drive may all be involved.", 
    "39": "Several experimental studies have demonstrated that the early administration of beta blockers in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction (in the first six hours) tended to diminish the area of myocardial necrosis. Numerous attempts to limit infarct size with beta blockers have occurred over the past ten years. Without a reliable and reproducible method to measure necrosed tissue, it has been difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of this therapy. Presently available studies have demonstrated, however, that beta blockers are well tolerated in the setting of an acute infarction as long as none of the usual contraindications are present. The majority (but not all) of these studies indicated improvement in parameters used to determine the amount of tissue necrosis and a tendency (not always significant due to the small numbers studied) to decrease morbidity and mortality during hospitalization. One study using metoprolol administered during the acute phase and continued during the first three months demonstrated a significant decrease in mortality. The results of this study are very demonstrative, nevertheless, once the acute necrotic phase is over, it is difficult to ascertain whether diminished tissue necrosis or the preventive effect of beta blockers is responsible for these findings until a recurrence or sudden death occurs.", 
    "40": "Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs prolong lives of post-infarction patients primarily by preventing sudden cardiac death. The mechanisms responsible for this beneficial effect are not understood clearly, since beta-blockers, in doses used in most clinical trials, are only weakly effective against stable ventricular arrhythmias. Arrhythmias during myocardial ischemia may differ from arrhythmias in other clinical settings in that they depend importantly upon autonomic neural factors, including the balance between levels of sympathetic cardiac stimulation and parasympathetic cardiac inhibition. Beta-blockers reduce sympathetic cardiac stimulation, and they may influence this balance favorably in another important way: a well documented, but not generally appreciated property of beta-blocking drugs is that they also increase levels of vagal cardiac inhibition. I propose that beta-blockade prevents arrhythmic deaths in post-infarction patients in part by increasing levels of vagal cardiac inhibition.", 
    "41": "Effects of prizidilol and nipradilol (K-351), beta-adrenoceptor antagonists with vasodilator action, on blood pressure and heart rate were studied in normotensive conscious rabbits after i.v. administration. In addition, we investigated relationships between plasma drug concentrations and beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity as estimated by the inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia and vasodilator activity as assessed by the inhibition of pressor response to angiotensin II (ANG II). Prizidilol (4 mg/kg) produced a significant and sustained fall in blood pressure and a slight increase in heart rate, while hydralazine (2 mg/kg) caused the same degree of hypotension and a marked tachycardia. Nipradilol (1 mg/kg) caused a significant reduction of resting heart rate, but had no significant effect on blood pressure. Propranolol (1 mg/kg) did not affect resting blood pressure and heart rate. Hypertensive response to ANG II was significantly attenuated only by hydralazine. Isoproterenol-induced tachycardia was significantly suppressed by prizidilol, nipradilol and propranolol. Good correlations were observed between beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity and plasma drug concentrations. These data suggest that prizidilol has an advantage over hydralazine to induce less tachycardia, but still may cause a certain degree of increase in heart rate. Nipradilol has a more potent beta-adrenoceptor blocking action than propranolol, while its vasodilator action is not obvious, at least in rabbits. Plasma concentrations of prizidilol and nipradilol are good indicators for beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity, but not for vasodilator activity.", 
    "42": "Direct cardiodepressant potency of nadolol was determined by comparing its effect with those of alprenolol, propranolol and pindolol, in both heart-lung preparation and blood-perfused papillary muscle preparation of the dog. In the heart-lung preparation, mean 50% beta-blocking doses of the beta-blockers to inhibit the positive chronotropic action of isoproterenol were 3.75 micrograms for nadolol, 12.5 micrograms for alprenolol, 9.6 micrograms for propranolol and 1.6 micrograms for pindolol. Alprenolol and propranolol in a dose of 10 mg shifted the cardiac function curves rightward and downward, while nadolol and pindolol in the dose of 10 mg did not shift the cardiac function curves. In the blood-perfused papillary muscle preparation, mean 50% beta-blocking doses of the beta-blockers, administered i.v. to the donor dog, to inhibit the positive inotropic action of isoproterenol were 9.1 micrograms/kg for nadolol, 56.6 micrograms/kg for alprenolol, 68.3 micrograms/kg for propranolol and 8.1 micrograms/kg for pindolol. Nadolol did not depress the contractile force in doses up to 1 mg/kg given i.v. or doses up to 10 mg given intra-arterially (i.a.) close to the preparation. Alprenolol and propranolol exerted the dose-related negative inotropic effects, when larger doses (30-300 micrograms) were injected i.a. Thus, it is confirmed that nadolol virtually possesses no direct cardiodepressant activity and also that the depressant activity is exerted only by large doses of the other beta-blockers.", 
    "43": "Severe non-specific adsorption of verapamil, nifedipine, prazosin and nadolol was observed during ultrafiltration of the drug solutions through the Centriflo CF 50A, YMT, YMB and Visking membranes. The results question the adequacy of the ultrafiltration procedure for the protein binding assay of the tested drugs.", 
    "44": "Adenylate cyclase activity was studied on the two epithelial cell types of bovine ciliary process after digestion by trypsin and purification by density gradient centrifugation. cAMP formation after isoproterenol stimulation showed that non pigmented cells were particularly enriched in adenylate cyclase activity. Furthermore pharmacological characteristics of this enzyme indicated that adenylate cyclase-associated beta adrenergic receptors were of beta 2 type in each kind of epithelial cells. These results support the hypothesis that beta adrenergic compounds modulate aqueous humor production through a direct effect on ciliary epithelium and enrichment of beta adrenergic sensitive adenylate cyclase activity in non pigmented epithelial cells suggests that these particular cells may play an important role in aqueous humor secretion.", 
    "45": "A therapeutic game plan is important for the management of hypertension in the runner. Participation in physical training programs may result in lower resting blood pressure in mild hypertensives. Maximal exercise tests can be used to identify those hypertensive patients with a dangerously high exercise blood pressure. Most antihypertensive drugs can be used for the treatment of hypertension which is refractory to exercise training. Atenolol, a cardioselective beta blocker has minimal side effects and the least risk of impairing performance. Calcium channel blockers effectively lower exercise blood pressure and should be used when side effects of beta blockers contraindicate their use in patients.", 
    "46": "The alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking activity of the R, R-isomer of labetalol, SCH 19927, was assessed in isolated tissues and compared with that of labetalol. The antihypertensive actions of both compounds were then evaluated during a 10-day dose regimen in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SCH 19927 produced a competitive alpha 1- and beta 1-blockade in vitro as indicated by the parallel shift to the right of the dose-response curves for norepinephrine and isoprenaline, respectively. SCH 19927 was found 4 times more potent as beta 1-blocker and 6.5 times less potent as alpha 1-blocker than labetalol. In conscious SHR, both SCH 19927 and labetalol produced long-lasting antihypertensive effects during the 10-day period of repeated administration with 10 mg/kg p.o. No tolerance to the antihypertensive activity occurred during the treatment. These findings suggest that SCH 19927 is more potent as a beta-blocker than as an alpha-blocker in isolated tissues and produces an effective antihypertensive activity during a repeated dose regimen.", 
    "47": "Central hemodynamic responses evoked by i.v. infusions of adrenaline and noradrenaline were studied in normovolemic anesthetized cats with intact adrenoceptors, after selective beta 2-blockade (ICI 118,551), and after nonselective beta-blockade propranolol). The results demonstrated the presence of an important beta 2-adrenergic component in the integrated response to 'physiological' doses of adrenaline contributing to increased cardiac output, decreased total peripheral resistance and virtually unchanged mean arterial blood pressure. Corresponding beta 2-adrenergic effects of noradrenaline were small. The beta 2-adrenergic effects of adrenaline on the heart seemed to be both direct and indirect. A moderate direct chronotropic response mediated by beta 2-adrenoceptors apparently was present but there was no evidence of a direct beta 2-adrenergic inotropic effect. An indirect, quite marked effect on the heart was accomplished by a beta 2-adrenergic vasodilator interaction with the alpha-adrenergic vasoconstrictor influence on the systemic resistance vessels. This caused a net decrease in total peripheral resistance, thereby preventing an undue increase in cardiac afterload (arterial pressure) which seemed to be essential for evoking 'optimal' increases in cardiac output. It is suggested that such adrenaline evoked indirect, beta 2-adrenergic improvement of cardiac performance is of functional importance in reflex sympatho-adrenal circulatory control.", 
    "48": "Bopindolol (Sandoz) in single daily doses of 1 and 2 mg was compared with atenolol (ICI) in single daily doses of 50 and 100 mg in respect of antihypertensive effect in a population of 33 patients divided by random allocation into 4 groups and treated for 12 months. Statistical analysis of the more than 4000 blood pressure readings obtained with a noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure recorder indicates equivalence of efficacy between bopindolol 1 mg, bopindolol 2 mg and atenolol 100 mg, with atenolol 50 mg less effective. Bopindolol's long duration of effect was reflected in lower morning values and in the absence of hypotension in the circadian profile.", 
    "49": "Chronic dietary administration of the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol (1.6-2.0 g/kg), to both male and female rats induced an appetite for 0.25 M NaCl solution when the rats were offered a choice between distilled water and salt solution to drink. Treatment was also accompanied by a significant reduction in both water and food intakes. In addition, increases in intake of NaCl solution during treatment with propranolol were correlated significantly with increases in urinary sodium output. To test for completeness of beta-adrenergic blockade, treated and control rats in the first study were administered isoproterenol (25 micrograms/kg b.w., SC) acutely and given only water to drink. The increased 1 hr water intake characteristically accompanying acute administration of isoproterenol was blocked completely by propranolol. Additional experiments were carried out with butoxamine, a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, (1.5 and 3.0 g/kg of food) to determine its effect on intake of 0.25 M NaCl solution. Butoxamine failed to produce a significant effect on salt appetite. The results indicate that chronic treatment with propranolol, but not butoxamine, induces an appetite for NaCl solution. They further suggest, but do not prove, that beta 1-adrenoceptors may be involved in the appetite for NaCl solutions in rats.", 
    "50": "Although anxiety is a familiar part of all our lives, pathologic anxiety states that lead to occupational and social dysfunction require medical treatment. Currently, the anxiety disorders are divided into nonphobic and phobic disorders. However, recent studies suggest that the disorders should be divided into three symptom groups: (1) generalized anxiety, (2) episodes with severe panic anxiety (panic attacks) plus generalized anxiety or even phobic avoidance, and (3) phobic anxiety and avoidance (alone, without panic attacks). This grouping is highly predictive of response to antianxiety medications. The generalized anxiety group responds well to psychosocial/psychotherapy treatments and to the antianxiety BZs. Many people with nonpanic, nonphobic (situational or generalized) anxiety only require simple psychotherapy or other nonpharmacologic methods to manage their anxiety. However, if the anxious patient is becoming dysfunctional or symptomatology is severe or persistent enough to warrant the use of medication, BZs are certainly the drugs of choice. Despite persistent public or media opinion that they are over-utilized or over-prescribed, most objective data suggest this is not the case. Most individuals for whom they are prescribed need them, use them in proper doses, and discontinue them when the indication passes. Most of the reported abuse occurs in the approximately 8 to 12 per cent who abuse other drugs, most notably alcohol. As anxiety is usually transient, BZs should be prescribed for limited periods (1 to 4 weeks) and then discontinued. This practice allows the physician to properly monitor the amount utilized and to evaluate need for continued BZs. The principal differences among the available BZs are their elimination half-lives, with some greater than 24 hours and others in the 8 to 12 hour range. Side effects are mostly mild (sedation, clumsiness) and drug-drug interactions are uncommon. Until recently, most patients suffering from disorders with panic attacks with or without phobias were either untreated or treated with long, but largely unsuccessful, treatments. Blockade of panic attacks with TCAs, MAOIs and alprazolam has dramatically improved our ability to treat these disorders, with 60 to 95 per cent of patients reporting marked alleviation of symptoms. Adequate amounts of medication and length of treatment period are the keys to successful treatment. This is a period of much productive interest and research in the anxiety disorders. Continued rapid progress in the understanding of the biologic substrates of these conditions and the development of new treatments promise much in this area of medicine in the near future.", 
    "51": "Of the many drug therapies mentioned in this review, only the alcohol-sensitizing drugs have current therapeutic applications in primary alcoholics. When alcohol abuse occurs in association with anxiety, depression, or schizophrenia, treatment with the anxiolytic, antidepressant, and neuroleptic drugs, respectively, may facilitate the alcoholic's ability to participate in other programs. Patients should receive drugs that are appropriate to treatment goals as well as to their psychosocial status. Even if a drug therapy is shown to be efficacious under controlled experimental conditions, its effectiveness may be compromised by a large number of factors that include poor compliance by the patient, a lack of a treatment strategy, or failure to optimize the treatment conditions. New pharmacotherapies with actions directed at central neurochemical pathways mediating alcohol consumption are urgently needed. However, even if such agents become available, they too will only be adjuncts to behavioral and social therapies directed at stabilizing all aspects of the alcoholic's life.", 
    "52": "Animal experiments have shown that beta-adrenoblockers have the most marked antistrophanthin properties while antiarrhythmic agents with locally anesthetic attributes are less active. All the substances studied have proved to be ineffective on the cellular model of strophanthin arrhythmia. The data obtained suggest that the antiarrhythmic effect of the substances under study including beta-adrenoblockers is exercised on the level of the receptor apparatus of the postsynaptic membrane. The membrane stabilizing properties do not play the decisive role in ensuring the antiarrhythmic effect in strophanthin arrhythmia.", 
    "53": "The intraocular pressure and the pupillary responses in conscious rabbits to racemic erythro-alpha-methylnorepinephrine (alpha MeNE) have been investigated and its activity compared to L-norepinephrine (NE). Aqueous solutions of alpha MeNE applied topically caused dose-dependent decreases of intraocular pressure and of pupil dilatation. The maximal intraocular pressure response to alpha MeNE exceeded that to NE, and the sensitivity of the intraocular pressure response exceeded that to NE by 10-20 times. The onset of the decrease in intraocular pressure to alpha MeNE was rapid and contrasted to the slow onset of the intraocular hypotensive response to NE. Preganglionic cervical sympathotomy did not effect the intraocular pressure and the pupillary responses to either alpha MeNE or NE. Superior cervical ganglionectomy induced supersensitivity to NE but not to alpha MeNE. Studies using alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta adrenoceptor antagonists indicated that the intraocular pressure responses to alpha MeNE were mediated primarily by alpha 2 and beta adrenoceptors whereas the responses to NE were mediated primarily by alpha 1 adrenoceptors. The observations are discussed in the light of recent data of the affinities of alpha MeNE and NE to alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta adrenoceptors. The high potency of alpha MeNE compared to NE in decreasing intraocular pressure and in dilating the pupil does not correlate with their binding affinities to alpha and beta adrenoceptors. The observations support an alternative explanation that the differences in the potencies of alpha MeNE and NE are due to differences in rates of inactivation of the two compounds in the adrenergic neurone.", 
    "54": "The Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT) was a multicentered, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to test the efficacy of long-term therapy with propranolol given to survivors of an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Three thousand, eight hundred and thirty-seven men and women, aged 30-69 years, were randomized into either the propranolol or placebo group 5 to 21 days after hospital admission for the MI and were followed at quarterly visits for 12 to 40 months (mean = 25 months). The primary outcome for the trial was all-cause mortality. This article describes the design and baseline findings of the trial. Included is a description of the historical background for the trial and the procedures employed in patient recruitment, randomization, treatment and follow-up. Also included is a comparison between the BHAT population and post-myocardial infarction patients enrolled in the other long-term trials of beta-blockers.", 
    "55": "The Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial was a randomized double blind controlled trial comparing propranolol with placebo in 3837 patients with a recent myocardial infarction. The trial was terminated on recommendation of the Policy and Data Monitoring Board 9 months before the scheduled closing date. The propranolol group, at the time of the decision, had a 26% lower mortality (z = 2.82). Many issues were considered in this decision. These included the magnitude of the overall results; consistency of results across subgroups, clinical centers, and cause of death; and completeness of follow-up. Two basic statistical methods were used in declaring the overall mortality results significant. The first method evaluated the current survival data taking into account the issue of repeated significance testing. The second method evaluated whether the observed trend was so impressive that the conclusion was unlikely to change even if the trial should continue to the scheduled end. These two methods, as well as other considerations led to the recommendation to discontinue the trial.", 
    "56": "Dogs with indwelling catheters in the jugular vein and in the carotid artery ran on the treadmill (slope: 15%, speed: 133 m/min). Lactate turnover and glucose turnover were measured using [U-14C]lactate and [3-3H]glucose as tracers, according to the primed constant-rate infusion method. In addition, the participation of plasma glucose in lactate production (Ra-L) was measured with [U-14C]glucose. Propranolol was given either (A) before exercise (250 micrograms/kg, iv) or (B) in form of a primed infusion administered to the dog running at a steady rate. Measurements of plasma propranolol concentration showed that in type A experiments plasma propranolol fell in 45 min below the lower limit of the complete beta-blockade. In the first 15 min of work Ra-L rose rapidly; then it fell below that of the control (exercise) values. During steady exercise, the elevated Ra-L was decreased by propranolol infusion close to resting values. beta-Blockade doubled the response of glucose production, utilization, and metabolic clearance rate to exercise. In exercising dogs approximately 40-50% of Ra-L arises from plasma glucose. This value was increased by the blockade to 85-90%. It is concluded that glycogenolysis in the working muscle has a dual control: 1) an intracellular control operating at the beginning of exercise, and 2) a hormonal control involving epinephrine and the beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "57": "Barrier contraception is a safe, effective, reversible form of contraception acceptable to many couples. The use of barrier contraception may protect against carcinoma of the cervix and sexually transmitted diseases. Distribution and education in the use of barrier contraception does not always require medical supervision. This must make it an attractive form of contraception for agencies supporting family planning programmes in developing countries. The only marketed recent advance in barrier contraception is the collatex sponge. Effectiveness rates range between 9 and 27 pregnancies per 100 woman-years. This is unlikely to make it the first choice of contraception for couples who would find an unintended pregnancy a severe problem, but the sponge will be acceptable to couples who are simply trying to delay a pregnancy. The new surge of interest in barrier contraception could lead to safer more effective forms of contraception being made available to women without medical supervision. This would have many advantages, but could also detract from the ability of family planning clinics to play an important role in preventative medicine for women.", 
    "58": "This article reviews current knowledge regarding the effectiveness and safety of barrier contraception (condoms, spermicides, vaginal sponges, the diaphragm, and cervical caps). Recent evidence suggesting adverse effects from IUD and oral contraceptive use has led to renewed interest in barrier contraception. Such methods may protect against sexually transmitted diseases and carcinoma of the cervix. Major advances have been made in condom marketing and manufacturing techniques. Although condom distribution campaigns have led to a dramatic decrease in the number of cases of sexually transmitted disease, those whose lifestyles put them at highest risk of contracting these diseases are least likely to accept condoms. Present commercially available spermicides appear to be free of serious side effects; however, since many drugs can be absorbed into the systemic circulation from the vagina, new preparations must be carefully tested for toxic effects. The collatex sponge represents the only marketed recent advance in barrier contraception. Vaginal sponges are less messy than caps and diaphragms, are unlikely to have adverse systemic effects, and can be purchased over the counter without medical consultation. Diaphragms are currently one of the least frequently used forms of contraception, in part because of the messiness of the spermicide. Little has been done to improve the image or packaging of diaphragms and caps. New innovations could make barrier methods of contraception more attractive and acceptable to couples. On the other hand, increased use of these methods would reduce opportunities for the application of preventive medicine to women of childbearing age since these methods do not require medical supervision.", 
    "59": "Liver alterations occurring after 1, 6 or 10 days of treatment with the hepatocarcinogen beta-blocker DL-1-(2-nitro-3-methyl-phenoxy)-3-tert-butyl-amino-propan-2-ol (ZAMI 1305) were studied in male and female Wistar rats. In agreement with its sex-dependent oncogenicity, ZAMI 1305 administration causes DNA damage in the liver of the female but not of the male rat, with the only exception of 2 out of 4 males treated for 6 days. In female rat, the amount of DNA damage increases from 1 to 6 days of treatment, being unchanged at 10 days; a small portion of DNA is however damaged. ZAMI 1305 administration to female rat induces also: (i) an increase of the relative liver weight, of the DNA and RNA synthesizing activity; (ii) a decrease of the number of hepatocytes in mitosis; (iii) a minimal oval cell hyperplasia. When the same parameters were studied in ZAMI 1305-treated male rats, they were unaffected or changed to a less extent in respect to female rats.", 
    "60": "A longitudinal population study of 1462 women aged 38-60 was carried out from 1968-9 to 1980-1 in Gothenburg, Sweden. The initial and follow up examinations included questions concerning history of diabetes and antihypertensive treatment. A considerably increased risk of developing diabetes was observed for subjects with hypertension taking diuretics (895 patient years), subjects taking beta blockers (682 patient years), and subjects taking a combination of diuretics and beta blockers (281 patient years) compared with subjects not taking antihypertensive drugs (13 855 control years). When diuretics and beta blockers were compared no difference was found in relative risk. Despite this increased risk, and because little is known about the relation between other forms of antihypertensive treatment and diabetes, diuretics and beta blockers should remain the treatments of choice in arterial hypertension.", 
    "61": "The authors tested in dogs the hypothesis that beta-adrenoceptor blockade might alter the time course or magnitude of serum potassium (K+) changes following the administration of succinylcholine (SCh). The results indicate that the normal increase in K+ induced by SCh (1 mg/kg intravenously) is exaggerated in the presence of propranolol-induced (0.25 mg/kg), beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Specifically, a peak increase of 1.7 mEq/1 (43%) over control K+ was noted in the beta-blocked dogs versus a 0.5 mEq/1 (13%) increase in control dogs. The peak increase in K+ occurred later in the beta-blocked dogs (60-90 min post-SCh) versus control dogs (30 min post-SCh). The authors postulate that these results reflect impairment of intracellular uptake of the SCh-induced acute K+ load secondary to beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Additionally, in a third group of dogs, diazepam in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg attenuated the K+ increases (1 mEq/1-24%) following SCh in beta-blocked dogs. Whether these data can be extrapolated to beta-adrenoceptor blocked patients remains a matter for further investigation. In the interim, periodic monitoring of K+ is warranted in any patient receiving medications known to alter the state of activity of the beta-adrenoceptor. In particular, careful consideration must be given to the potential impact of various interventions (SCh administration, K+ infusion) on K+ levels in beta-adrenoceptor blocked patients.", 
    "62": "Clinical and autopsy studies indicate that most patients who present with unstable angina or an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have significant underlying coronary atherosclerosis. This review discusses 4 mechanisms that may contribute to the precipitation of these acute ischemic clinical syndromes: progression of atherosclerosis, acute coronary thrombosis, coronary artery spasm, and platelet aggregation. Numerous clinical trials using thrombolytic agents early during AMI have shown the incidence of thrombosis to be at least 60%. Other studies suggest that platelet aggregation frequently contributes to the evolution of AMI from unstable angina and that spasm may occasionally play a similar role. The therapeutic implications of these mechanisms are also considered in light of their potential to restore coronary artery blood flow (vs conventional methods thought mainly to reduce myocardial oxygen demand) and thereby limit the infarct process. The role of vasodilators, thrombolytic agents, antiplatelet drugs and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs are discussed. Finally, therapeutic guidelines for the treatment of acutely ill patients are constructed that emphasize the need for a comprehensive yet time-efficient treatment strategy that uses nitrates, calcium channel-blocking drugs, streptokinase, heparin, aspirin and, in selected patients in an unstable condition, emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting.", 
    "63": "To determine whether the beta-blocking drug propranolol had any physiologic effect on normal (n = 14) and adenomatous (n = 15) human thyroid tissues, experiments were performed to study the binding of the beta-blockers 125I-iodocyanopindolol (125I-ICYP) and 125I-iodohydroxybenzylpindolol (125I-IHYP) and the stimulation of adenyl cyclase (AC) by isoproterenol. 125I-ICYP and 125I-IHYP failed to show high-affinity binding in 27 of 29 specimens, whereas two (one normal and one adenomatous) thyroid tissues demonstrated high-affinity binding (Kd 5.5 +/- 1 X 10(-9) M) for 125I-ICYP. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (0.3 IU/ml), guanosine triphosphate (10(-4) M), and Gpp (NH)p(10(-4) M) stimulated AC in all thyroid tissues, although in two tissues (normal) Gpp (NH)p failed to cause a significant increase. Isoproterenol (10(-4) M), in contrast, had no effect on basal AC activity or on guanosine triphosphate, and Gpp (NH) p stimulated AC activity in 26 of the 29 thyroid tissues. In one of the two tissues that increased AC in response to isoproterenol, the beta-blocking drugs propranolol hydrochloride, bunitrolol hydrochloride, and tolilprolol hydrochloride decreased AC stimulation to isoproterenol at concentrations of 10(-6) M (p less than 0.05). Higher concentrations of propranolol (10(-4) - 10(-2) M) decreased AC stimulation to thyroid-stimulating hormone (p less than 0.01), not only in this responsive tissue but also in tissues that failed to demonstrate high-affinity binding for 125I-ICYP and AC stimulation to isoproterenol (p less than 0.01). Thus most normal and adenomatous human thyroid tissues lack beta-receptors and a functioning beta-receptor AC system. High concentrations of propranolol in vitro decreased AC response by thyroid-stimulating hormone, but this is probably a nonreceptor-mediated effect.", 
    "64": "The normal decline in systolic blood pressure (SBP) during the recovery phase of treadmill exercise does not occur in some patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). In others the recovery values of SBP exceed the peak exercise values. To examine the diagnostic value of this observation, we studied 31 normal subjects and 56 patients undergoing treadmill exercise before coronary cineangiography. Because of large differences in peak exercise pressures between the two groups, recovery ratios were derived by dividing the SBP at 1, 2, and 3 min after exercise by the peak exercise SBP. The 1, 2, and 3 min ratios in the normal subjects declined steadily from 0.85 +/- 0.07 (SD) to 0.79 +/- 0.06 and to 0.73 +/- 0.06, respectively, while the ratios in the patients with CAD remained elevated at 0.97 +/- 0.12 to 0.97 +/- 0.11 to 0.93 +/- 0.13. With use of the upper limits defined by two SDs of the normal value, recovery ratios were compared with the occurrence of angina and with ST segment depression on the exercise electrocardiogram in the patients with CAD. Abnormal ratios were more frequent in patients with CAD (53/56, 95%) than in those with ST segment depression (33/56, 59%), angina (37/56, 66%), and either ST segment depression or angina (42/56, 75%). Twenty of the patients with CAD who were on no medication underwent an additional treadmill exercise test on a separate day and no significant differences were found in the ratios from the two tests. Ten additional patients with CAD underwent treadmill exercise testing while on placebo and while on a beta-blocker.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "We studied the ability of alpha-adrenergic stimulation to induce delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity in Purkinje fibers from cat hearts in the presence of an elevated Ca++ concentration. Delayed afterdepolarizations could not be induced at drive cycle lengths of 200 to 500 msec in the presence of extracellular Ca++ concentrations of 2.7 to 8.1 mM. However, the addition of 10(-5)M phenylephrine in the presence of 5 X 10(-7)M propranolol elicited delayed afterdepolarizations in eight of 10 preparations at a Ca++ concentration of 8.1 mM; nondrive-triggered action potentials were recorded from three of the preparations. These afterpotentials were completely suppressed by 5 X 10(-7)M prazosin or 10(-6)M phentolamine. In the presence of 5 X 10(-7)M propranolol, 10(-5)M phenylephrine prolonged action potential duration and this effect was suppressed by 5 X 10(-7)M prazosin. Methoxamine, at a concentration of 5 X 10(-6)M, was also observed to potentiate delayed afterdepolarizations in all of three preparations studied. These results demonstrate that alpha-adrenergic stimulation can induce afterpotentials in the presence of elevated Ca++ levels in cat hearts. Stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors may be responsible for arrhythmias under Ca++-loaded conditions such as ischemia and coronary reperfusion.", 
    "66": "Ouabain (80 micrograms/kg) injected into the lateral cerebroventricles (ICV) of rats produced a prompt and sustained increase in arterial blood pressure. A diastolic blood pressure increase of about 40 mm Hg began within 10 minutes of injection and lasted at lest 1 hour. This dose of ouabain had no effect on arterial pressure when given intravenously. The vasopressor response to intracerebroventricularly administered ouabain was not blocked by prior intravenous administration of phentolamine (1 mg/kg) or hexamethonium (3 mg/kg). However, continuous intravenous infusion of saralasin (2 micrograms/kg per min) prevented the pressor response to intracerebroventricularly administered ouabain. In addition, bilateral nephrectomy, adrenalectomy, pretreatment with intravenously administered propranolol (2 mg/kg) or captopril (10 mg/kg) abolished the increase in blood pressure evoked by intracerebroventricularly administered ouabain. Plasma renin and epinephrine levels at the peak of the pressor response to intracerebroventricularly administered ouabain were respectively, about 2.5- and 2-fold higher than in control rats. Our data indicate that ouabain administered into the central nervous system produces a hypertensive effect which does not primarily involve peripheral alpha-adrenergic receptors, but appears to be due to angiotensin II produced by renin of renal origin. These data suggest that digitalis agents can interact with sites in the central nervous system to induce a release of renin from the kidney; this release appears to involve activation of beta-adrenergic receptors by catecholamines from the adrenal medulla, perhaps through a direct adrenal-kidney vascular network.", 
    "67": "The individual target organ response to blood pressure reduction is an important criterion in the selection of appropriate antihypertensive therapy. We assessed both the renal and the systemic haemodynamic responses to antihypertensive monotherapy (five to seven weeks) with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (n = 12), in contrast to the cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol (n = 11) in subjects with essential hypertension. Enalapril lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and the fall in blood pressure was mediated haemodynamically by a 34% fall in systemic vascular resistance. In the kidney, glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow and renal blood flow were maintained by a 23% fall in renal vascular resistance. The disproportionate fall in systemic resistance versus renal resistance actually reduced the renal fraction of cardiac output. By contrast, metoprolol lowered predominantly diastolic blood pressure, with an associated 25% fall in cardiac output, without significant changes in overall systemic vascular resistance. In the renal circulation, renal perfusion was well maintained by a 20% fall in renal vascular resistance, perhaps at the efferent arteriole, without change in the renal fraction of cardiac output. Neither drug altered weight, plasma volume or total blood volume. Thus, each drug represents effective antihypertensive monotherapy, with a generally favourable, though different, renal haemodynamic profile, characterized by effective autoregulation of renal perfusion even in the face of a fall in perfusion pressure.", 
    "68": "The new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (MK-421), was tested by a double-blind trial. Patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension were randomly allocated to one of two stepped-care treatment groups: enalapril 20 mg once-a-day, or placebo as the first step, followed when necessary by the successive addition of hydrochlorothiazide (25 and 50 mg), oxprenolol (160 and 320 mg) and dihydralazine (50 and 100 mg). Blood pressure was normalized in both groups, although the enalapril group showed lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures than the placebo group (systolic 130.5 +/- 12 versus 136.6 +/- 9 mmHg, P less than 0.01; diastolic 82.8 +/- 6 versus 87.0 +/- 5 mmHg, P less than 0.001). These results were obtained with a smaller number of tablets per day (2.6 +/- 1.8 versus 4.2 +/- 2.4 mmHg, P less than 0.0001). Plasma potassium was identical for both groups at the start of treatment. At the end of the study, it was significantly higher in the enalapril group than in the placebo group (4.1 +/- 0.3 versus 3.9 +/- 0.5 mmol/l; P less than 0.05). Spontaneous complaints were noted during the bi-weekly or monthly visit and were also expressed by patients completing a self-administered questionnaire. Differences in spontaneous complaints or in the symptoms evaluated by the questionnaire were not significant. The increase in the number of symptoms at the end of the study was greater in the placebo group than in the enalapril group, but the difference was not statistically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "We studied left ventricular function by equilibrium-gated technetium-99m ejection fraction and global left ventricular perfusion by thallium-201 scintigraphy in 43 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Patients were studied at rest and during submaximal (approximately 50% of VO2 max) supine bicycle exercise, off therapy and on four forms of therapy for 16 weeks: methyldopa (n = 9); propranolol (n = 9); hydrochlorothiazide (n = 9); and enalapril (n = 16). None of the patients had focal myocardial ischaemia or heart failure. There were no differences between methyldopa, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide and enalapril in blood pressure responses to exercise. However, heart rate at rest (57 +/- 4.6 beats/min) and during exercise (108 +/- 8.0 beats/min) was significantly lower in patients on propranolol than in other groups (70 +/- 3.9 and 117 +/- 5.5 beats/min for methyldopa; 75 +/- 3.3 and 119 +/- 4.9 beats/min for hydrochlorothiazide; 74 +/- 2.8 and 125 +/- 2.6 beats/min for enalapril). In the propranolol-treated group, mean ejection fraction fell from 55% at rest to 49% during exercise. This suggests that cardiac output is likely to be lower and peripheral resistance higher during exercise in patients on propranolol than on other forms of treatment. There were no significant differences in coronary perfusion responses to exercise, however, or in the ratio of coronary perfusion to rate-pressure product, between any of the groups. These findings suggest that the limitation in exercise tolerance often reported by patients on beta-blockers is not due to coronary insufficiency during exercise, but to an attenuation of the cardiac output response to exercise, together with a raised peripheral vascular resistance.", 
    "70": "The acute haemodynamic effects of the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antiagonist pindolol which has considerable intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), were studied in 10 patients with essential hypertension for 24 h. One hour after oral dosing (10 mg), the drug reduced supine arterial pressure significantly. The maximum antihypertensive effect was observed after 3-4 h (-15 +/- 3%, P less than 0.001). The fall in arterial pressure was associated with a 25% reduction of systemic vascular resistance (P less than 0.001) after 24 h. By that time cardiac output was increased by 16 +/- 5% (P less than 0.05). Cardiac filling pressures and pulmonary artery pressure did not change. The vasodilator effect of pindolol cannot easily be explained by suppression of plasma renin activity since changes in arterial pressure and plasma renin were inversely correlated (r = -0.58, P less than 0.001). Despite the antihypertensive and vasodilator effect of pendolol, plasma noradrenaline did not rise. The rapid fall in arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance may be explained by the absence of an initial reflex vasoconstriction which normally follows blockade of cardiac beta-receptors. This may be related to ISA on cardiac and vascular postsynaptic beta-receptors. Concomitant blockade of central and/or peripheral presynaptic beta-receptors is suggested by the absence of a rise in plasma noradrenaline and may contribute to the vasodilator action of pindolol.", 
    "71": "The role of adrenaline-induced postjunctional alpha 2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction was studied in seven patients with essential hypertension (EHT) and eight normotensive subjects (NT) using forearm venous occlusion plethysmography. Adrenaline (0.01 to 0.08 micrograms/min/100 ml of tissue) infused into the forearm circulation via the brachial artery during alpha l adrenoceptor blockade with prazosin (0.05 micrograms/min/100 ml of tissue) and beta adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol (2 micrograms/min/100 ml of tissue) decreased forearm blood flow (FAF) dose-dependently below basal FAF (P less than 0.001). The adrenaline-induced decrease in FAF was greater in EHT than in NT (P less than 0.01) and was blocked in both groups by alpha 2 adrenoceptor blockade with yohimbine (30 micrograms/min/100 ml of tissue). The increase in FAF following postjunctional alpha-2 blockade as well as following postjunctional alpha-1 blockade was greater in EHT than in NT (P less than 0.01) but was similar in both groups following 'non-specific' vasodilation with sodium nitroprusside. Postjunctional alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction is enhanced in patients with essential hypertension. Adrenaline induced postjunctional alpha 2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction could contribute to elevated vascular resistance in patients with EHT and elevated plasma adrenaline concentrations particularly in the presence of blunted beta adrenoceptor-mediated functions.", 
    "72": "In 40 male patients with established essential hypertension (P diastolic greater than mmHg) the density and responsiveness of platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors and lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors were measured and compared with those in 40 male age-matched normotensive subjects (P diastolic less than 90 mmHg). The mean densities of platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors (assessed by 3H-yohimbine binding) and of lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors (assessed by (+/-) 125 iodocyanopindolol binding) were significantly increased in essential hypertensive patients (P less than 0.01). If data from all 80 subjects were combined there were significant positive correlations between mean arterial blood pressure of the subjects and alpha 2-adrenoceptor density (r = 0.591, P less than 0.001) and beta 2-adrenoceptor density (r = 0.648, P less than 0.001), respectively. The increases in and beta-adrenoceptor densities in essential hypertension were accompanied by enhanced responsiveness alpha- of platelets to 10 microM adrenaline to adrenergic stimulation: the aggregatory response via alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation) was increased, and in lymphocytes isoprenaline (0.01 - 100 microM) produced (via adrenoceptor stimulation) greater increases in cyclic AMP at each concentration than in control. Furthermore, activation of platelet adenylate cyclase by prostaglandin E1 was exaggerated in essential hypertensive patients. It is concluded that the increased density and responsiveness of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in essential hypertension may reflect enhanced sympathetic activity, and may contribute to the elevation of blood pressure.", 
    "73": "We have characterized the binding of [125I]-Iodohydroxybenzylpindolol to rat adipocytes' crude membrane. The binding was rapid, reaching equilibrium within 19 min. Binding of [125I]-Iodohydroxybenzylpindolol was saturable with 9 nM. Half-maximal saturation provided an estimated Kd of 2.42 nM. The order for 125IHYP displacement by various compounds was (-)-propranolol (-)-isoproterenol greater than (-)-epinephrine greater than (-)-norepinephrine. [125I]-Iodohydroxybenzylpindolol binding was more sensitive to L-propranolol inhibition in crude membrane prepared from diabetic rat fat cells than in those prepared from controls. The basal cAMP level was identical in diabetic and control rat crude membrane. Isoproterenol increased the cAMP level in diabetic more than in control rats."
