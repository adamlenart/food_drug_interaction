    "0": "The effects of dilevalol, a new beta-adrenergic blocking agent with beta-agonism, on renal function were determined in two groups of patients. Patients in group 1, all with normal renal function, received either dilevalol or atenolol. Patients in group II, all with impaired renal function, received either dilevalol or metoprolol. Parameters of renal function determined before and after chronic oral treatment included glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow, filtration fraction, mean arterial pressure (MAP), renal blood flow, and renal vascular resistance. Dilevalol lowered MAP by 14 mm Hg (P less than 0.005) in group I and 25 mm Hg (P less than 0.01) in group II but had no effect on other parameters of renal function, at either peak or trough drug levels. Atenolol and metoprolol also lowered MAP by 11 mm Hg (P less than 0.01) and 15 mm Hg (P less than 0.05), respectively. Atenolol reduced GFR by 23% at peak drug level, an effect that was partially ameliorated at trough drug level. The effect of atenolol on GFR appeared to vary as a function of baseline renal function in that greater reductions were seen in groups of patients with increasing baseline GFR. Metoprolol significantly decreased renal vascular resistance by 17% (P less than 0.05). These data suggest that dilevalol effectively lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients with normal or compromised renal function with no negative impact on parameters of renal function.", 
    "1": "Hemodynamic compromise developed following intentional overdose with nadolol in a 57-year-old woman. Nadolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Intravenous infusion of glucagon hydrochloride was effective in restoring hemodynamic stability after intravenous fluid loading and catecholamine infusions had failed. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of nadolol overdose.", 
    "2": "The influence of head-out water immersion (WI) (37 degrees C) on baroreflex control of heart rate was studied in five trained, instrumented, conscious dogs. Arterial pressure was raised and lowered using occluder cuffs implanted around the aorta and inferior vena cava. Function curves relating transmural systolic arterial pressure (TSAP = systolic arterial pressure-pleural pressure) to heart rate (HR) were constructed to compare responses in air and during WI. The resting TSAP in air [142 +/- 8 mmHg (mean +/- SE) at 78 +/- 6 beats/min] increased significantly during WI (161 +/- 9 mmHg at 109 +/- 9 beats/min). During WI, the saturation TSAP at the bradycardia plateau of the relation increased significantly, by 19 mmHg, whereas the average gain (slope) of the relation decreased significantly, from -1.426 to -0.752 beats.min-1.mmHg-1. Therefore, WI elicits both a resetting and a decrease of the average gain of the TSAP-HR relation. The heart rate range increased during WI as well. After cholinergic blockade with atropine, WI did not elicit a resetting of the relation and the change in average gain was abolished. However, after beta 1-blockade with metoprolol, the resting TSAP increased significantly during WI and resetting persisted, but the decrease of average gain was abolished. Therefore, the alteration of the TSAP-HR relation in WI is achieved via a modulation of both adrenergic and cholinergic regulation of HR.", 
    "3": "Sympathetic activation increases heart rate (HR) and reduces atrioventricular interval (AVI), whereas atrial pacing alone increases AVI. We sought to differentiate the direct effects of sympathetic activation on atrioventricular (AV) conduction time from the indirect changes associated with concurrent alterations in HR. We recorded electrocardiograms, blood pressure (BP), and intracardiac electrograms from chloralose-anesthetized autonomically decentralized dogs. Beat-by-beat HR and AVI data were collected continuously. Sympathetic stimulation (0.25-2.5 Hz; mean 0.81 Hz) resulted in a HR change of +60 beats/min after 60 s. This tachycardia was associated with a mean decrease in AVI of 22 ms. Computer-driven atrial pacing to reproduce the HR associated with control sympathetic stimulation caused a mean AVI increase of 10 ms. Propranolol (200 micrograms) was then administered via the sinoatrial node artery and sympathetic stimulation repeated. Although HR remained constant, AVI decreased by 14.8 ms. The AVIs associated with an identical HR achieved by two different mechanisms (sympathetic stimulation and atrial pacing) were significantly different. Although removal of the contribution of sympathetically induced HR changes on AV conduction might be expected to result in potentiation of neural effects at the AV node, none was evident. Thus sympathetic activity restricted to the AV node is less effective in influencing AV conduction than the response that occurs when HR changes occur concurrently. Therefore, the opposing actions of HR and sympathetic tone on AV conduction may not be predicted by a simple linear relationship.", 
    "4": "The microvascular responses to topically applied isoproterenol and to epinephrine in the intact and beta-adrenoceptor-blocked microcirculation were studied in the rabbit tenuissimus muscle by direct intravital microscopy. The main feeding arterioles in this muscle supply two vascular areas, the muscle capillaries and the adjacent connective tissue. beta-Adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol and epinephrine dilated the transverse arterioles that supply muscle and connective tissues, whereas their first-order side branches (terminal arterioles), which only supply the muscle capillaries, were little affected. Flow measurements were made at two different sites in the transverse arterioles to determine the relative changes in muscle capillary flow and connective tissue flow. These measurements showed that beta-adrenergic stimulation caused a fractional redistribution of microvascular blood flow from the muscle tissue proper to the adjacent connective tissue.", 
    "5": "The present study of primary prevention in white men aged 40 to 64 years attempts to investigate whether a beta-blocker given as initial antihypertensive treatment would lower total mortality to a greater extent than thiazide diuretics. Patients were randomized to metoprolol (n = 1609, 8110 patient-years) or a thiazide diuretic (n = 1625, 8070 patient-years). The median follow-up time was 4.2 years. The mean dose of metoprolol was 174 mg/d, and of thiazide diuretics, 46 mg/d of hydrochlorothiazide or 4.4 mg/d of bendroflumethiazide. Identical control of blood pressure was achieved using a fixed therapeutic schedule. Total mortality was significantly lower for metoprolol than for thiazide diuretics because of fewer deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke. Total mortality was also significantly lower in smokers randomized to metoprolol. The benefit demonstrated in patients treated with metoprolol seems to have important implications for clinical practice.", 
    "6": "The antihypertensive efficacy of a serotonin-receptor antagonist, ketanserin, was compared with that of a well-established antihypertensive drug, metoprolol, and their cardiac and forearm hemodynamic effects were investigated using echocardiography and bidimensional pulsed Doppler flowmetry, respectively. Twenty hypertensive subjects completed a double-blind, cross-over, randomized study using ketanserin and metoprolol. Two 5-week courses with ketanserin or metoprolol were preceded by a placebo period; the total duration of the study was 15 weeks. Despite a comparable efficacy in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (about 10% of the basal value), the two drugs showed quite different effects on forearm hemodynamics. Ketanserin increased forearm blood flow and induced a significant decrease in forearm vascular resistance (from 141 +/- 16 to 75 +/- 11 mm Hg/mL/sec, P less than .01). Furthermore, this treatment was able to improve brachial artery compliance (from 1.89 +/- .3 to 3.2 +/- .3 cm4/dyne 10(-7), P less than .01). On the contrary, metoprolol did not modify forearm hemodynamics. Both drugs did not significantly modify cardiac performance, as evaluated by left ventricle circumferential fiber shortening. Cardiac output was increased by ketanserin (from 5.9 +/- .3 to 6.6 +/- .5 L/min, P less than .05) and fell during treatment with metoprolol (from 5.9 +/- .4 to 4.9 +/- .3 L/min P less than .01). Thus, the two drugs reduce blood pressure through different hemodynamic mechanisms and the effects of ketanserin on systemic and peripheral circulation seem more favorable.", 
    "7": "Survival after variceal bleeding depends greatly on the outcome of the immediate posthaemorrhagic period. This may in turn depend on the recurrence of bleeding. We therefore prospectively evaluated the influence of propranolol on the recurrence of variceal haemorrhage during the early period after the acute bleeding episode. Twenty consecutive patients with acute variceal haemorrhage and liver disease were randomly assigned to treatment either with propranolol or placebo orally for 14 days. Propranolol significantly decreased the rate of recurrence of variceal haemorrhage during this early period (p = 0.0028; 95% confidence interval in the placebo group, 90 +/- 20%; in the beta blocker group, 20 +/- 26%). Whereas a recurrence of variceal bleeding occurred in 9 of 10 patients in the placebo group, only 2 of 10 rebled during treatment with propranolol. These results suggest that propranolol may prevent rebleeding in the crucial early period after acute haemorrhage from oesophageal varices.", 
    "8": "The cardiovascular effects of prostaglandin (PG)I2 and PGF2 alpha were compared in the unanesthetized American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana). Control mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were 25.7 +/- 1.1 mm Hg and 35.1 +/- 1.1 beats/min, respectively. Intravenous injections of PGI2 decreased MAP and increased HR in a dose-dependent fashion over the range of concentrations tested (0.03, 0.3, 3, and 10 micrograms/kg-body weight [bw]. Neither atropine (1 mg/kg-bw) nor verapamil (1 mg/kg-bw) treatment altered the MAP or HR responses to PGI2 (3 micrograms/kg-bw). However, propranolol (5 mg/kg-bw) significantly blunted the hypotensive effects without affecting the increase in HR. Prostaglandin F2 alpha (tested at 0.3, 3, 30, and 100 micrograms/kg-bw) increased both MAP and HR. Mean arterial pressure increased with concentrations greater than 0.3 microgram/kg-bw and reached peak effects at 30 micrograms/kg-bw. Prostaglandin F2 alpha increased HR at doses greater than 0.3 microgram/kg-bw. Neither the pressor nor positive chronotropic effects of PGF2 alpha (30 micrograms/kg-bw) were affected by atropine or propranolol. However, verapamil significantly attenuated the pressor effects without affecting the increase in HR. These results demonstrate that both prostaglandins have qualitatively similar effects on HR, but opposite effects on MAP. Prostaglandin I2 is a hypotensive prostaglandin, while PGF2 alpha is hypertensive. The pressor effects of PGF2 alpha are partially dependent on calcium influx. The positive chronotropic effects of both prostaglandins are independent of the autonomic nervous system, suggesting a different mechanism of action.", 
    "9": "1. In a double-blind, randomised, three-way-crossover study, 25 patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 120 mm Hg (Phase V) after 4 weeks' run-in on atenolol 50 mg twice daily, received atenolol 50 mg twice daily alone, atenolol 50 mg plus nifedipine 20 mg each twice daily and atenolol 50 mg plus nifedipine 40 mg each twice daily in three treatment periods each lasting 4 weeks. 'Washout' periods were not included. 2. The two combination treatment regimes lowered the 12 h post-dose blood pressure more effectively than did atenolol alone, but the high dose nifedipine combination was no more effective than the low dose nifedipine combination. Sitting systolic BP (+/- s.e. mean) at the end of each period was 174 +/- 5 mm Hg after the atenolol run-in, 170 +/- 5 mm Hg with atenolol alone, 156 +/- 5 mm Hg with the low dose combination and 158 +/- 4 mm Hg with the high dose combination. Corresponding diastolic BP readings were 106 +/- 2 mm Hg, 106 +/- 2 mm Hg, 97 +/- 2 mm Hg and 99 +/- 2 mm Hg respectively. 3. Side-effects tended to occur less commonly with the low dose of the fixed combination than with atenolol alone. An increased number of side-effects occurred with the 40 mg twice daily doses of nifedipine, particularly flushing/erythema, oedema of the ankles/feet, and a hot feeling in the legs. These differences did not reach significance. 4. Overall compliance was good (98 +/- 0.7 s.e. mean %) and was similar within the different treatment regimes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "A randomised, crossover, double-blind study was carried out in sixteen coronary patients with stable effort angina to compare the effects of verapamil (360 mg) and propranolol (120 mg). All the patients received placebo for 2 days, underwent a coronary angiography which confirmed coronary heart disease and were then randomised into two groups to receive an initial treatment of either verapamil or propranolol for three days. The patients then took placebo for 3 days, then the second drug after cross-over also over 3 days. The therapeutic efficacy was assessed by stress testing on a treadmill (Bruce protocol) with automated analysis of the results (Case-Marquette), carried out on the last day of each of the phases with placebo and the test drug. The duration of the stress test increased significantly with propranolol (p less than 0.01) and verapamil (p less than 0.05) with respect to placebo. In comparison with placebo, propranolol and verapamil resulted in a similar decrease in ST segment depression at the time of maximum effort (p less than 0.01). The resting systolic blood pressure decreased with propranolol (p less than 0.02) and verapamil (p less than 0.01), whereas resting diastolic blood pressure only decreased with verapamil (p less than 0.01). Resting heart rate decreased during the propranolol phase (p less than 0.001). The systolic blood pressure at the time of maximum effort decreased especially with propranolol (p less than 0.05), whereas the diastolic blood pressure on exertion decreased during the verapamil phase (p less than 0.01). Heart rate during exertion only showed a significant decrease with propranolol (p less than 0.001) as compared with placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "The renomedullary interstitial cell (RIC) is a unique cell found in the renal medullary interstitium among the collecting ducts, Henle's loop, and the vasa recta. A combination of morphologic and physiologic studies has defined some of the properties of this cell, which is the apparent source of the mediators of the antihypertensive function of the kidney. These may include prostaglandins (PGE2), APRL or platelet activating factor, and the incompletely defined neutral lipid, ANRL (or medullipin), the most likely candidate for this function. The lipid droplets in the RIC apparently are the precursors of the mediator(s). Degranulation of the RIC by an experimental maneuver usually indicates increased activity of these cells. The presence of abundant well-granulated RIC in a kidney indicates a resistance of that animal to the induction of salt-sensitive forms of experimental hypertension. There is definite evidence for an extrarenal antihypertensive function of the RIC mediators, but an intrarenal effect also is considered.", 
    "12": "A randomized controlled, single-blind trial was conducted to compare the effectiveness of a high-dose diuretic with a combination of a diuretic and metoprolol in black adults with hypertension. All subjects were first treated with 50 mg/d of hydrochlorothiazide for four weeks. Only subjects with a diastolic blood pressure of 95 mm Hg or higher at the end of this four-week period entered the randomized trial. We hypothesized that black patients with uncontrolled hypertension and low plasma renin activity on usual-dose hydrochlorothiazide therapy (ie, 50 mg/d) would respond better to higher doses of hydrochlorothiazide (ie, 100 to 150 mg/d) than to a usual-dose diuretic and metoprolol. Diuretic-metoprolol combination therapy was significantly more effective than high-dose diuretic therapy regardless of plasma renin status.", 
    "13": "The effects of captopril, methyldopa, and propranolol hydrochloride on reported distress over sexual symptoms over a 24-week treatment period were examined as part of a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial in which 626 men with mild to moderate hypertension participated. On entry into the clinical trial, 58% of patients taking antihypertensive medications and 44% of men not receiving antihypertensive drugs reported distress over one or more sexual symptoms. Among 304 patients treated with monotherapy who completed the trial, total symptoms distress scores of treatment groups did not differ from each other in change from baseline to week 24, but in particular, problems of maintaining an erection were significantly worsened with propranolol therapy. Among 177 patients treated with monotherapy plus a diuretic, total sexual symptoms distress scores worsened among the groups taking methyldopa or propranolol, with significant worsening in all individual symptoms among patients taking propranolol, and problems in maintaining an erection and in ejaculation among patients receiving methyldopa. Among patients treated with captopril plus a diuretic, no change from baseline appeared in scores for any of the sexual symptoms. The findings underline the importance of taking an adequate sexual history and document that selection of antihypertensive drugs may significantly affect the incidence of sexual symptoms.", 
    "14": "This double-blind, three-way crossover study measured the influence of beta-blocker treatment on drowsiness and mental test performance in older hypertensive patients and determined if lipophilicity was a determinant of these effects. Twenty-seven hypertensive patients (mean age, 63 +/- 3 years) were studied. Patients received two weeks each of daily treatment with placebo, 100 mg of atenolol, or 150 mg of metoprolol tartrate and were evaluated on the 14th day of each treatment period, after which their next treatment period began. Mental performance was measured using Trails-A maze testing. Drowsiness was measured subjectively using a visual analogue scale, and objectively using critical fusion-frequency threshold testing. Blood pressure control was equivalent and clinically adequate in all subjects. Steady-state levels of metoprolol tartrate (235.7 +/- 46 ng/mL) and atenolol (453.6 +/- 56 ng/nL) achieved were those expected to produce similar beta-blockade. Mental performance as measured by Trials-A testing showed better scores during beta-blocker treatment compared with placebo. Trails-A scores improved as patients went from placebo to metoprolol treatment, but did not change as patients went from placebo to atenolol treatment. Critical fusion-frequency threshold measurements were lower following administration of both drugs than following that of placebo, but subjectively there was no difference in feelings of lethargy between either beta-blocker and placebo. These data show greater improvement in mental testing performance to be associated with metoprolol treatment, but neither produced more lethargy than placebo in elderly patients.", 
    "15": "The goal of this study was to determine the prognostic utility of the exercise thallium-201 stress test in ambulatory patients with chest pain who were also referred for cardiac catheterization. Accordingly, 4 to 8 year (mean +/- 1SD, 4.6 +/- 2.6 years) follow-up data were obtained for all but one of 383 patients who underwent both exercise thallium-201 stress testing and cardiac catheterization from 1978 to 1981. Eighty-three patients had a revascularization procedure performed within 3 months of testing and were excluded from analysis. Of the remaining 299 patients, 210 had no events and 89 had events (41 deaths, nine nonfatal myocardial infarctions, and 39 revascularization procedures greater than or equal to 3 months after testing). When all clinical, exercise, thallium-201, and catheterization variables were analyzed by Cox regression analysis, the number of diseased vessels (when defined as greater than or equal to 50% luminal diameter narrowing) was the single most important predictor of future cardiac events (chi 2 = 38.1) followed by the number of segments demonstrating redistribution on delayed thallium-201 images (chi 2 = 16.3), except in the case of nonfatal myocardial infarction, for which redistribution was the most important predictor of future events. When coronary artery disease was defined as 70% or greater luminal diameter narrowing, the number of diseased vessels significantly (p less than .01) lost its power to predict events (chi 2 = 14.5). Other variables found to independently predict future events included change in heart rate from rest to exercise (chi 2 = 13.0), ST segment depression on exercise (chi 2 = 13.0), occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias on exercise (chi 2 = 5.9), and beta-blocker therapy (chi 2 = 4.3). The exclusion of myocardial revascularization procedures as an event did not change the results significantly. Although the number of diseased vessels was the single most important determinant of future events, the exercise thallium-201 stress test when considered as a whole (which included the number of segments demonstrating redistribution on delayed thallium-201 images, change in heart rate from rest to exercise, ST segment depression on the electrocardiogram, and ventricular premature beats on exercise) was equally powerful (chi 2 = 41.6). Combination of both catheterization and exercise thallium-201 data was superior to either alone (chi 2 = 57.5) for determining future events. Exercise stress test alone (without thallium-201 data) was inferior to the exercise thallium-201 stress test or cardiac catheterization for predicting future events (chi 2 = 30.6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "16": "The systemic and renal hemodynamic effects of tertatolol, a new noncardioselective beta blocker without partial agonist activity, given alone or in combination with cyclooxygenase inhibition by acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), were investigated in eight healthy volunteers. Tertatolol 5 mg, aspirin 1 g, tertatolol 5 mg together with aspirin 1 g and placebo were administered at 1-week intervals in a random order and in a double-blind fashion. Cardiac output was measured by Doppler echography and renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by constant infusion techniques using (123I) iodohippurate and (51Cr) EDTA, respectively. Measurements were performed before and then successively 2 and 4 hours after oral intake of drugs or placebo. Tertatolol decreased cardiac output by 22% (P less than .05) and heart rate by 17% (P less than .05) without change in blood pressure, renal blood flow, and GFR. The same effects occurred when tertatolol was given together with aspirin. Either placebo or aspirin alone had no effect on systemic and renal hemodynamics. These results suggest that cardiac output is redistributed to the kidneys after tertatolol intake in normal humans. This favorable effect on renal hemodynamics is probably not mediated by a local release of vasodilating prostaglandins.", 
    "17": "We tested the hypothesis that selective beta 1-adrenergic blockade will enhance growth hormone (GH) secretion in boys with constitutional delay of growth in response to both exogenously administered growth hormone-releasing hormone as well as to endogenous GH-releasing hormone pulsations. The study group comprised eight healthy, short, prepubertal boys ranging from 7 2/12 to 15 0/12 yr old with bone ages delayed 15 to 42 months. All had demonstrated GH levels of greater than 10 ng/ml following a pharmacologic or physiologic stimulus. During two consecutive nights, blood samples were withdrawn every 20 min for GH determination between 2000 and 0800 h. Immediately after each 0800 h blood withdrawal, 1 microgram/kg of GH-releasing hormone (1-40)-OH was administered intravenously to each subject and blood was withdrawn every 15 min for an additional 2 h. During the day before the second overnight sampling period each subject received atenolol, 25 mg orally, at 1030 and 1600 h to induce beta-adrenergic blockage. The six subjects in whom beta-adrenergic blockade could be documented had enhanced GH release after GH-releasing hormone administration on the atenolol treatment day both in terms of higher peak GH levels achieved (p less than 0.05) as well as greater total GH secretion (3916 +/- 701 versus 5624 +/- 986 ng/ml.min, p less than 0.01). In contrast, there were no differences in endogenous, unstimulated nocturnal GH pulse characteristics between study and control days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "In response to added catecholamines, isolated trout (Salmo gairdneri) hepatocytes substantially increase the output of glucose into the surrounding medium. This effect is due to activation of glycogen breakdown concomitant with increases in gluconeogenesis and cell respiration. Each metabolic parameter is activated to a similar extent. In hormone-treated and untreated cells, glycogenolysis accounts for more than 97% of glucose production. Activation of glycogen phosphorylase is implicated in the degradation of cell glycogen, while increased flux through the gluconeogenic pathway from lactate is associated with inactivation of pyruvate kinase, possibly through enzyme phosphorylation as indicated by the activity ratio measured at low and saturating concentrations of phosphoenolpyruvate. From studies with specific adrenergic agonists and antagonists, we conclude that stimulation of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in trout hepatocytes is consistent with a beta-adrenergic effect. Results are inconclusive with respect to catecholamine-mediated activation of cell respiration. None of the monitored cell acid-base variables (pH, PCO2, [HCO3-]) are implicated in the catecholamine-dependent changes in metabolic output of hepatocytes. Imposed hypercapnic conditions (increased medium PCO2 and decreased medium pH), which cause changes in cell acid-base parameters, result in a depression of lactate oxidation and gluconeogenesis, while the rate of glycogenolysis is not affected. In addition, the total amounts of glycogen phosphorylase and pyruvate kinase assayable are negatively affected by hypercapnic treatment of hepatocytes. Under hypercapnic conditions, cells are highly responsive to adrenergic agonists. It appears that--especially in the long term--the catecholamine-dependent activation of gluconeogenesis may compensate for the acid-base-dependent shortfall in glucose output by the liver.", 
    "19": "This study demonstrates how a previously described animal model can be utilized to evaluate the effects of multiple aerosols. For the exposures presented in this report, unanesthetized but mildly restrained guinea pigs were used. Airflow (V), tidal volume (VT), and respiratory frequency (f) were continuously measured in all animals and their flow-volume (V-VT) loops were also obtained. The animals were first exposed to room air and then challenged with a 10% CO2 (in 19% O2, 71% N2) mixture. The normal ventilatory response to 10% CO2 consists of increases in V, VT, and f. This response is very stable for long periods of time and is highly reproducible. It is possible, however, to alter the normal CO2 response by adding an aerosol to the CO2 mixture. Two types of acute responses can be induced, Type I and Type II. In this study, histamine and carbamylcholine aerosols were used to induce the Type I response while propranolol aerosols were used to induce the Type II response. Serotonin aerosols were used to induce both types of effects. We report that the bronchodilator, isoproterenol, reversed the Type I pulmonary effects where the level of reversal was dependent upon isoproterenol concentration. The rapid, shallow breathing, characteristic of the Type II response, was not reversed by isoproterenol but could be prevented by blocking the vagus nerve with cocaine. Since no invasive techniques are required and the same animals can be used repeatedly, combinations of aerosols can be tested in order to delineate how Type I or Type II abnormal ventilatory responses to CO2 are induced by a wide variety of airborne chemicals.", 
    "20": "The adrenergic section of the vegetative pancreatic innervation has been examined, using morphological, histochemical and biochemical methods, during neurogenic injury, acute experimental pancreatitis and alloxan diabetes. It has been established that the development of those etiologically different processes was accompanied by catecholamine level reduction in the adrenergic structures of the pancreas which can be prevented by ganglioblockers. It is concluded that sympathetic nervous system participates in etiopathogenesis of a number of pancreatic diseases and that it is possible to prevent and treat them with sympathotropic agents.", 
    "21": "This study was undertaken to determine if oral flecainide exerts autonomically mediated actions in addition to its direct depressant effect. Electrophysiologic studies were performed twice in each of 15 patients (mean age 59 years) with normal resting and intrinsic heart rate and normal A-H interval. In the first study, the variables of sinus node and atrioventricular node were evaluated both in the basal state and after autonomic blockade (propranolol 0.2 and atropine 0.04 mg/kg). Oral flecainide was administered for 4 to 5 days (200 to 250 mg daily) and the study was then repeated using the same methods. From comparison of data obtained in the 2 studies in the basal state, the overall effect of flecainide was evaluated and by comparing those obtained after autonomic blockade, the direct action of the drug was assessed. The overall effect of flecainide on sinus node was slight; sinus cycle length, corrected sinus node recovery time and sinoatrial conduction time did not change significantly after the drug. In contrast, after autonomic blockade the variables of sinosal automaticity were increased significantly (p less than 0.01). Flecainide significantly prolonged the atrioventricular node variables both in the basal state and after autonomic blockade (p less than 0.01), but the degree of increase was more marked after autonomic blockade (p less than 0.05). These data show dual effects of oral flecainide: a direct depressant action and an autonomically mediated opposing action, likely of vagolytic type.",

This approach can be used for data analysis in bioequivalence studies employing tissue sampling compartments. Application of this method indicated that an azone-containing ophthalmic formulation of levobunolol did not produce better ocular bioavailability than a formulation containing no penetration enhancer.", 
    "23": "In a single blind randomized study the effects of a 4-week administration of propranolol (160 mg/day) and penbutolol (40 mg/day) on metabolic control and insulin-induced hypoglycemia were tested in 8 non-insulin-dependent diabetics with diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 110 mmHg. The recovery from hypoglycemia was not delayed by either drug; hypoglycemic nadir and Conard's K did not change significantly. Symptoms of hypoglycemia were inhibited to a lesser extent and pulse rate decrease was lower after penbutolol vs baseline (65 +/- 2.4 vs 77 +/- 2.4 beats/min, p less than 0.01) than after propranolol vs baseline (61 +/- 1.06 vs 77 +/- 2.4 beats/min p less than 0.001). Both drugs produced similar and significant effects on blood pressure both systolic and diastolic. There were no significant effects on fasting plasma glucose concentration, HbA1c, IRI, urinary C-peptide, triglycerides, total and HDL cholesterol and FFA. IRG decreased after penbutolol vs baseline 60 min after insulin injection (170 +/- 30.8 vs 125 +/- 15.4 pmol/l, p less than 0.05). These results indicate that the use of beta-blockers, in particular penbutolol, for mild to moderate hypertension may be considered the treatment of choice also in non-insulin-dependent diabetics at the therapeutic doses employed.", 
    "24": "Beta adrenoreceptor blocking drugs have been used for the prevention of haemorrhage from oesophageal varices. However, it is possible that these agents, by virtue of their effects on hepatic blood flow, may impair liver function and precipitate hepatic encephalopathy. We have therefore studied the effect of the beta blocking drug propranolol on hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Twenty patients were randomly assigned to receive 4 weeks treatment with propranolol or an identical-looking placebo, the former given in a dose sufficient to reduce resting pulse rate by greater than or equal to 25%. Before and after treatment patients were assessed for the severity of liver disease and the presence of encephalopathy. EEG mean cycle frequency and fasting arterial ammonia concentrations were also measured, and in order to detect latent hepatic encephalopathy, each patient underwent a battery of psychometric tests. Patients were blinded as to their treatment, as were those assessing their responses. Neither propranolol nor placebo had any significant effect on the parameters measured. On propranolol median EEG mean cycle frequency fell from 9.08 ct s-1 (range 8.63-11.0 ct s-1) to 8.73 ct s-1 (range 8.27-11.44 ct s-1), and median fasting arterial ammonia concentration fell from 66 mumol litre-1 (range 40-329 mumol litre-1) to 49 mumol litre-1 (range 37-188 mumol litre-1). Psychometric test values, while initially abnormal and suggestive of latent hepatic encephalopathy in the majority of patients, did not change significantly during the study.", 
    "25": "Unlike amiodarone, beta-blockers have proved ineffective in the treatment of severe ventricular rhythm disorders encountered in hypertrophic myocardiopathy. We tried to evaluate the efficacy of sotalol, a betablocker with anti-arhythmic properties, like amiodarone, on the supraventricular and ventricular rhythm disorders of this disease. 13 patients (6 men and 7 women, mean age 53.5 +/- 26.5 years) were evaluated with a 48 hours electrocardiographic recording, before and 8 and 120 days after a sotalol treatment at a mean dose of 290 mg/day (160 to 640 mg). The diagnosis of hypertrophic myocardiopathy was established on standard clinical, phonomecanographic (13 cases), sonocardiographic (13 cases) and haemodynamic (9 cases) criteria. Five patients presented bursts of supraventricular tachycardia on DO. Their number decreased to 4 on D8 and to 3 to D120. Six patients presented Lown's class III or IV ventricular rhythm disorders on DO. Their number went from 2 on D8 to 4 on D120. Therefore, in this short series, sotalol has shown a non-negligible efficacy on the rhythm disorders encountered in hypertrophic myocardiopathy.",

The effect of chronic treatment with epanolol, a new cardioselective beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist with moderate beta 1-selective intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), on 24 h ambulatory intra-arterial blood pressure (24 h IABP) and the sino-aortic baroreceptor heart rate (SAB/HR) reflex was investigated in six hypertensive subjects. 2. All subjects demonstrated a greater than 10% reduction in mean arterial pressure with atenolol therapy (100 mg once daily) before entering a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover protocol with epanolol (100 mg twice daily for 4 weeks). 3. Epanolol treatment at this dose was not associated with significant reduction in systolic or diastolic 24 h IABP or heart rate. There was no change in SAB/HR reflex set point, sensitivity or latency with epanolol. 4. beta 1-selective ISA may be undesirable in beta-adrenoceptor antagonists used to treat hypertension.", 
    "27": "Effects of methoxamine and phenylephrine on the action potential and the membrane currents in spontaneously beating rabbit sino-atrial node cells were examined by means of a two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. Both methoxamine and phenylephrine (10(-4) mol/l) prolonged the cycle length (CL) and the action potential duration (APD), significantly. At concentrations higher than 3 x 10(-4) mol/l, phenylephrine increased the maximum rate of rise of action potential (Vmax) but methoxamine reduced it. Both agents depolarized the maximum diastolic potential (MDP). These changes in the action potential parameters occurred in a concentration-dependent manner. In the presence of phentolamine (10(-5) mol/l), methoxamine (3 x 10(-4) mol/l) did not modify the action potential parameters. Also, phenylephrine did not affect them during exposure to phentolamine (10(-5) mol/l) and pindolol (10(-7) mol/l). In voltage-clamp experiments, at 10(-3) mol/l both methoxamine and phenylephrine slightly increased the slow inward current (Isi), but decreased the time-dependent outward current (Ik). The steady-state activation variable of Ik (p infinity) was unaffected by these agents. The hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) was suppressed in the presence of methoxamine, but enhanced in the presence of phenylephrine. An additional application of pindolol (10(-7) mol/l) during exposure to phenylephrine (10(-3) mol/l) depressed the action potential amplitude (APA) and Vmax, and prolonged CL slightly. Under the same condition, all the membrane currents (Isi, Ik and Ih) were decreased. In addition, the time courses of decay for Isi were not modified in the absence and the presence of phenylephrine (10(-3) mol/l) and phenylephrine plus pindolol (10(-7) mol/l).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "Spirally cut strips of human saphenous veins preincubated with 3H-noradrenaline were superfused in the presence of corticosterone and, unless stated otherwise, of cocaine or desipramine. Tritium overflow was stimulated electrically (2 Hz). Adrenaline (in the presence of rauwolscine), isoprenaline and the preferential beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist procaterol concentration-dependently increased the electrically evoked tritium overflow. Prenalterol, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist with moderate preference for beta 1-adrenoceptors, was ineffective. The concentration-response curve of isoprenaline was shifted to the right by the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol and by the preferential beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551, but was not affected by the beta 1-selective antagonist atenolol. In experiments on strips preexposed to adrenaline 10 nmol/l (i.e. a concentration higher than that which normally occurs in vivo) for 32 min in the absence of cocaine or desipramine, the electrically evoked 3H overflow was not affected 12 and 44 min after withdrawal of adrenaline, irrespective of whether propranolol was absent or present in the superfusion fluid. In veins incubated with 3H-adrenaline, a considerable amount of the radioactivity was accumulated. During subsequent superfusion with 3H-adrenaline-free solution, electrical stimulation induced tritium overflow in a tetrodotoxin-sensitive manner. Propranolol failed to modify the evoked tritium overflow. It is concluded that the sympathetic nerve fibres of the human saphenous vein are endowed with facilitatory presynaptic beta 2-adrenoceptors. These receptors do not seem to play a substantial role in a local adrenaline (previously taken up)-mediated positive feedback loop regulating noradrenergic transmission, at least under the present in vitro conditions.", 
    "29": "P0160 (1-phenyl-3-(2-(3-(2-cyanophenoxy)-2-hydroxypropyl)amino) ethylhydantoin HCl) is an aryloxypropanolamine which contains a ureido group as part of the hydantoin ring. This molecule was synthesized to obtain a more cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker. Preliminary data have shown that it is as potent as propranolol and four times more cardioselective than atenolol in pharmacological tests in-vitro and in the conscious rat. In the present study we evaluated the interaction of P0160 with beta-adrenoceptors by radioreceptor binding studies and by measuring adenylate cyclase activity coupled to beta-adrenoceptors. The data indicate that P0160 binds with nanomolar affinity to beta-adrenoceptors labelled with [3H]DHA in the rat heart, but with micromolar affinity in the rat lung. Its binding is stereospecific, the S-(-)isomer being 200 times more active than the R-(+) form. P0160's selectivity between cardiac beta 1- and beta 2-receptors was 1388, about 60 times that for metoprolol. Analysis of the thermodynamic characteristics of P0160's interaction with rat heart beta-adrenoceptors indicated antagonist properties of the same order of magnitude as propranolol, as confirmed by adenylate cyclase studies. These data indicate that P0160 is a potent, specific and selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, and give a molecular explanation for the cardioselective activity found in pharmacological tests.", 
    "30": "Although beta-blockers have established efficacy in treating ventricular ectopy and PSVT, their applicability for acute antiarrhythmic interventions in patients with organic heart disease or COPD, is frequently limited by negative inotropic or bronchospastic side effects. The development of an ultrashort acting beta-blocker with rapid reversibility of its side effects would widen their applicability. Therefore, we tested the electrophysiologic properties of such a new short acting beta-blocker, esmolol, in 14 patients (10 with organic heart disease) with a mean EF of 47.6 +/- 17%, undergoing standard clinical electrophysiologic studies for various indications. Like most other beta-blockers, esmolol's major direct effects were on sinus node function and AV nodal conduction characteristics; significantly prolonging sinus cycle length, cycle length to Wenckebach and AH interval in sinus rhythm and at a paced cycle length of 600 ms. In contrast to most other beta-blockers, following termination of its infusion, esmolol shortened parameters of sinus node function and AV nodal refractoriness, with respect to the control values, suggesting a possible rebound phenomena. These effects occurred within 5 min of terminating the intravenous drug infusion. Esmolol had no significant effect on systolic blood pressure, electrocardiographic intervals and had rare adverse reactions. We conclude that esmolol is an ultra-short acting beta-blocker, with typical direct electrophysiologic effects on sinus node and AV nodal function, and a possible rebound phenomena following its discontinuation that may make it particularly suited to acute antiarrhythmic interventions in patients susceptible to adverse beta-blocker side effects.",

The aim of this study is firstly to show their tolerance in the long term in this pathology when the condition is stable and secondly to judge their efficacy in controlling side effects caused by bronchodilators (trembling, tachycardia) which are often administered at the same time. This study concerned 21 patients: 8 asthmatics and 13 spastic bronchitics, treated over a period of 4 months in a cross-over, double-blind test by 2 cardio-selective beta-blockers (2 months: betaxolol, 2 months atenolol).

In contrast, the hydrophilic drugs metipranolol, practolol and atenolol increased the incorporation of 32P into phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol. The inhibition of 32P incorporation by lipophilic drugs correlated with the high binding of these drugs to mast cells.", 
    "34": "In a randomized, double-masked study, 41 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were treated with betaxolol 0.5% or timolol 0.5% drops for 26 weeks. The average decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) over the total study period was significant with both betaxolol (-6.3 mmHg) and timolol (-7.2 mmHg) in patients receiving no adjunctive therapy. There was no difference between betaxolol and timolol with respect to changes from baseline IOP. Significantly decreased mean brachial arterial pressure (MAP) was seen only with timolol, although the difference between the two groups was not significant. Pulse, pupil size, and basal tear secretion were unchanged in both groups. Burning upon instillation of the drops was more frequent with betaxolol.",

In the particulate fraction, the beta-adrenoceptor number increased 4-10-fold after partial hepatectomy. 125I-ICYP binding to intact cells demonstrated a high fraction of non-specific binding, although phentolamine was included in the assay to reduce non-specific binding. 3H-CGP-12177 binding to intact cells also demonstrated a higher fraction of non-specific binding than in most cell types. In intact cells, the beta-adrenoceptor number increased 5-6-fold after partial hepatectomy. The number of receptors was comparable in intact cells and the broken cell preparation, indicating that receptors are conserved during the preparation of the particulate fraction.",

The selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551, 50 mg orally given thrice daily, did not lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients known to respond to therapy with atenolol or propranolol. 2. This dosage regimen resulted in a small decrease in supine heart rate which might represent partial beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonism by ICI 118,551. 3. The results suggest that beta 2-selective antagonism does not play a role in the hypotensive action of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "37": "1. In eight normal volunteers, the adductor pollicis (AP) was fatigued using intermittent trains of programmed, supramaximal stimulation at 1, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 1 Hz. Activity protocols were performed both with and without circulatory occlusion, both without and during propranolol 80 mg thrice daily in order to investigate the effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on 'peripheral' fatigue mechanisms. 2. The degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade was assessed by the reduction of exercise tachycardia during cycle ergometry, e.g. pulse rates at 210 watts were reduced from 190 +/- 15 to 127 +/- 5 beats min-1 (mean +/- 1 s.d.) indicating that beta-adrenoceptor blockade was substantial and highly significant (P less than 0.001). 3. Before, during and following fatiguing activity with circulatory occlusion force declines were identical during and without beta-adrenoceptor blockade. During and following activity without occlusion, there were slight declines in force which were questionably significantly different at 20 Hz (P less than 0.05). 4. The compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude, measured from the skin surface over the muscle, was unaltered by beta-adrenoceptor blockade before, during or after activity whether with or without circulatory occlusion. 5. The maximal relaxation rate (MRR) was not significantly reduced in previously unfatigued muscle during beta-adrenoceptor blockade. During activity, both with and without circulatory occlusion, there was no evidence that MRR was reduced significantly more during beta-adrenoceptor blockade. 6. The absence of a convincing effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on peripheral fatigue mechanisms may indicate that central mechanisms are involved or that impairments of peripheral force production, of a specific nature or as a result of exacerbation of limitations of circulatory oxygen transport, though small are detected during voluntary exercise and give rise to increases in motor unit recruitment and/or firing rates, and hence increased perception of fatigue.", 
    "38": "The major findings of a review of the literature on platelet aggregation in hypertensive human subjects and the effects of antihypertensive agents were as follows: (1) There is an increased platelet aggregatory response to epinephrine and ADP in hypertensives with MAP greater than 120 mmHg. (2) Treatment with propranolol decreases the aggregatory response to ADP, but it may enhance the response to epinephrine. (3) Treatment with calcium blockers in normotensives decreases the aggregatory response to epinephrine. Further work needs to be done to answer the questions raised by this review. Since the major goal, yet unachieved, of antihypertensive therapy is reduction of the incidence of CHD, the anti-thrombotic or thrombotic potential of antihypertensive agents must be known. Future clinical trials of drug therapy for hypertension should be designed to include at least a determination of platelet aggregation in response to both ADP and epinephrine.", 
    "39": "Specific beta-adrenergic receptors were demonstrated in the urinary bladder of adult and developing rats, by direct tissue binding with LD [125I]-cyanopindolol (CYP). The maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) was 167 +/- 25 fmol/mg membrane protein and the dissociation constant (KD) equalled 61 +/- 33 pM. The Hill slopes of the LD [125I]-CYP binding showed a single class of noncooperative receptor sites. The rank order of potency of agonist competition for LD [125I]-CYP binding suggests that the receptors are mostly of the beta 2 subtype. Beta-adrenergic receptor density was approximately half in the first 10 days of life (Bmax 63 to 77 fmol/mg protein) compared with the older age-groups studied (Bmax 91 to 167 fmol/ng protein). On the 1st day after delivery, the calculated beta-adrenergic receptor number/bladder was 9.4, and it increased significantly with age to 2,496 in the adult rat. This is a 250-fold increase in the number of receptors/bladder, while only a 20-fold increase in membrane protein and a five- to sixfold increase in the bladder weight was observed. Thus, an age-dependent increase of beta-adrenergic receptors on the cell membrane surface area occurred in the developing urinary bladder of the rat.", 
    "40": "Blockade of beta-adrenoceptors interferes with haemodynamic and metabolic adaptations and ion balance during dynamic exercise. After administration of a beta-blocker exercise heart rate is reduced. Exercise cardiac output and blood pressure are reduced also, but to a lesser extent than heart rate. At submaximal exercise intensities blood flow to the active skeletal muscle is also reduced. The availability of non-esterified fatty acids for energy production is decreased, due to inhibition of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated adipose tissue lipolysis, and possibly also of intramuscular triglyceride breakdown. During submaximal exercise muscle glycogenolysis is unaffected, but there are indications that the maximal glycogenolytic rate at high exercise intensities is decreased. In normally fed subjects plasma glucose concentration is maintained at a normal level during submaximal endurance exercise after beta-blocker administration, although lower glucose concentrations are found in fasting subjects and during high intensity exercise after beta-blocker administration. Plasma lactate concentrations tend to be somewhat lower after beta-blocker administration while plasma potassium concentration during exercise is increased. beta-Blocker administration may also interfere with thermoregulation during prolonged exercise. Maximal aerobic exercise capacity is reduced in normotensive and probably also in hypertensive subjects after beta-blocker administration. Submaximal endurance performance is impaired to a much more important extent in both groups of subjects. In patients with coronary artery disease, on the other hand, symptom-limited exercise capacity is improved during beta-blocker treatment. Studies on trainability during beta-blocker treatment show inconsistent results in healthy subjects, although the majority of studies suggest a similar training-induced increase in VO2max during placebo and beta-blocker treatment. In patients with coronary artery disease the training effects are also similar in patients treated with beta-blockers and those without. The negative effects of beta-blockers on maximal and especially submaximal exercise capacity should be considered when prescribing beta-blockers to physically active hypertensive patients. The negative influence is shared by all types of beta-blockers, although the impairment of submaximal exercise capacity is more pronounced with non-selective than with beta 1-selective beta-blockers. beta-Blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity have similar effects during exercise to those without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.", 
    "41": "A series of novel \"soft\" beta-blockers was designed and synthesized based on the \"inactive metabolite approach\". Accordingly, the acidic metabolite of metoprolol was converted into various lipophilic esters. The new compounds were tested for their effect on the intraocular pressure (IOP) of rabbits using the ultra-short acting beta-adrenergic antagonist \"Esmolol\" as a reference compound. Most of the tested compounds displayed a higher and a more prolonged ocular hypotensive activity than the reference methyl ester. The adamantaneethyl ester 2 emerged as the best potential candidate for ophthalmic use as an antiglaucoma agent. This compound exhibited an effective and long lasting ocular hypotensive activity without local irritation to the eye. At the same time, it showed a very fast rate of hydrolysis in human blood (t1/2 = 7.0 minutes) to the inactive acid metabolite. This makes possible effective separation of the desired ocular activity from unwanted systemic beta-blocking action. Unilateral treatment with 2 produced reduction in the IOP only in the treated eye, consistent with the mechanism proposed.",

With this model, effects of thoracic epidural anaesthesia (TEA) on mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), stroke volume (SV), heart rate (HR), central venous pressure (CVP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and maximal increase of pressure in the left ventricle (max dp/dt) were studied in six groups of animals: 1) In conscious animals (n = 10) MAP, CO, SV and HR decreased significantly by 12%, 25%, 10% and 16%, respectively, while SVR increased significantly by 20% during TEA; 2) In chloralose-anaesthetized animals (n = 7) the reduction in CO during TEA was less pronounced and there were no significant changes in SV or SVR; 3) In conscious animals (n = 6) LVEDP, CVP and max dp/dt decreased significantly during TEA; 4) Hexamethonium, when administered to pharmacologically vagotomized conscious animals during TEA (n = 8), induced a significant decrease in SVR (23%) but no change in HR; 5) Changes in haemodynamics after cardiac adrenoceptor blockade with metoprolol, in conscious animals (n = 12), did not differ significantly from those seen during TEA, except for an unchanged SV after metoprolol; 6) 50 microliters of bupivacaine (5 mg/ml) when given i.v. to conscious animals (n = 8) did not affect CO, SV, HR or TPR significantly, while MAP increased slightly but significantly. Thus, in this conscious animal model, TEA almost completely and rather selectively blocked probably mediated by a reflex activation of unblocked sympathetic efferents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

For the diagnosis, a checklist has been used on which the time course and the nature of the symptoms are recorded in plain language. The analysis will primarily assess death and disability from all causes, with disability measured using a modified Rankin scale. Secondary end points will be vascular death, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and retinal infarction.

    "44": "Three consecutive challenges of the rat isolated left atria with electrical stimulation and then electrical stimulation and isoprenaline were made. The responses to electrical stimulation decreased and the responses to isoprenaline increased with consecutive challenges such that the maximal combined response to electrical stimulation and isoprenaline remained constant. The sensitivity (pD2) to isoprenaline decreased with successive challenges. Thus, in studies of the effects of drugs on the responses to electrical stimulation and isoprenaline, it is necessary to perform parallel experiments with untreated atria to monitor changes in the responses unrelated to the addition of drug. Analysis of the effects of procaine, metoprolol, and propranolol on the responses to electrical stimulation and/or isoprenaline demonstrated distinct contractile manifestations of beta-adrenoceptor blocking and membrane stabilizing activity. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity of metroprolol at 10(-7) M and propranolol (3 X 10(-9)-10(-6) M) consisted of parallel rightward shifts of the concentration-response curves to isoprenaline alone. There were three components to the membrane-stabilizing action of drugs: first, there was a decrease in the responses to electrical stimulation alone, which was observed with procaine at greater than or equal to 10(-4) M and propranolol at greater than or equal to 3 X 10(-9) M, second, there was a small parallel rightward shift of concentration-response curve to isoprenaline alone with metoprolol at 10(-6) M and propranolol at 3 X 10(-6) M (that the inhibitory effects of metoprolol at 10(-6) M or propranolol at 3 X 10(-6) M are greater than can be explained by beta-adrenoceptor blockade only may be detected either by determining pA2 values from the formula pA2 = pAx + log(x - 1) or by Schild analysis); third, the highest concentrations of procaine (3 X 10(-4) M) and propranolol (10(-5) M) tested decreased the maximal combined response to electrical stimulation and isoprenaline.", 
    "45": "The effect of propranolol on myocardial oxygen consumption was studied in in situ canine hearts. In 12 afterload independent isovolumic hearts propranolol increased MVO2 an average of 19 +/- 3% (P less than 0.01) for all peaked developed pressure intervals from 75 to 175 mm Hg, secondary to increased wall stress. In 10 hearts instrumented for computer acquisition of pressure-volume workloops during progressive volume loading on right heart bypass, propranolol decreased preload recruitable stroke work an average of 36% (P less than 0.05). However, propranolol failed to decrease the amount of oxygen consumed for basal metabolism or external mechanical work when MVO2 is indexed for heart rate, heart weight, and stroke work. Therefore, propranolol does not decrease MVO2 for individual contractions and does not affect the energy requirements for basal metabolism, excitation-contraction coupling, and heat generation, in contrast to results obtained with beta agonists.", 
    "46": "The (+)-stereoisomers of arylethanolamine beta adrenergic agonists and antagonists are usually much less active in biological systems than their corresponding (-)-forms. In the eye, however, prior physiological studies have shown that these (+)-stereoisomers are unexpectedly potent in altering intraocular pressure, results which could be due to a difference in distribution and metabolism or to a difference in receptor interaction. The present experiments evaluated six stereoisomeric pairs of beta adrenergic antagonists for their ability to block rabbit ciliary process and cardiac beta adrenergic receptors activating adenylate cyclase, in vitro, under conditions in which the effects of drug metabolism, distribution and membrane lipid solubility were minimized. In the heart, all six pairs of antagonists demonstrated the expected increased potency of (-)-forms, with isomeric activity ratios of: 33 for metoprolol, 44 for timolol; 48 for bunitrolol; 76 for t-butyl-betaxolol; 100 for t-butyl-didesmethyl-ICI-118,551; and 530 for betaxolol. Under identical assay conditions in the ciliary process, (+)-enantiomers were much more potent relative to (-)-forms, with isomeric activity ratios of: 0.82 for timolol; 3.3 for bunitrolol; 7.4 for t-butyl-didesmethyl-ICI-118,551; 10 for metoprolol; 16 for t-butyl-betaxolol; and 190 for betaxolol.

    "47": "1. The game of squash has recently been associated with a high incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. To investigate this further, plasma catecholamines and potassium (K+) were monitored during a game of squash in six normal volunteers. 2. No cardiac arrhythmias were seen in this study despite the subjects reaching maximum heart rates of 181 +/- 5 beats/min (mean +/- SEM). 3. During exercise, plasma K+ rose from 3.82 +/- 0.16 to 4.29 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, but after 90 s rest this fell to 3.68 +/- 0.28 mmol/l and after 180 s to 3.44 +/- 0.17 mmol/l. This rapid K+ shift could not be accounted for by generalized changes in venous acid-base status or by changes in venous plasma catecholamines. Although pretreatment with a beta 2-antagonist caused the overall plasma K+ levels to be higher, it had no significant effect on the fall in plasma K+ after exercise. 4. Such rapid K+ shifts after exercise might contribute to arrhythmogenesis in susceptible individuals. The precise mechanism of the fall in K+ after exercise remains undetermined, but it seems not to involve catecholamines stimulating beta 2-adrenoceptors and is more likely to be due to increased skeletal muscle blood flow and/or intracellular acidosis.", 
    "48": "Regulation of beta-adrenoceptor-agonist function in the Maudsley Reactive (MR/Har) and the Maudsley Non-Reactive (MNRA/Har) rat strains was assessed by comparison of isoproterenol competition for [125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding sites in crude left ventricular homogenate preparations. Non-linear, least-squares analysis of isoproterenol competition for ICYP binding in the absence of guanine nucleotide revealed different proportions of high- and low-affinity receptors in the two strains; MR/Har rats (59 +/- 3.3%) had a significantly greater proportion of receptors in the high-affinity state than the MNRA/Har rats (41 +/- 4.5%). Addition of the non-hydrolyzable guanine nucleotide analog guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) converted receptors to the low-affinity state. Analysis of Gpp(NH)p concentration-response curves in left ventricular homogenates of the two strains revealed that the MR/Har strain had a significantly (P less than 0.02) lower EC50 for guanyl nucleotide inhibition of isoproterenol competition for ICYP binding than the MNRA/Har. Confirming previous experimental results, a significantly (P less than 0.04) greater density of ventricular beta-receptors was found in MR/Har rats (13.16 +/- 0.92 fmol/mg protein) than in MNRA/Har rats (10.81 +/- 0.63 fmol/mg protein). Left ventricular catecholamine levels were found to be correlated inversely with beta-adrenoceptor density in the two strains; norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EPI) concentrations (ng/mg protein) in left ventricle were 12.19 +/- 0.94 for NE and 0.165 +/- 0.038 for EPI in MNRA/Har, and 8.73 +/- 0.95 and 0.018 +/- 0.018, respectively, in MR/Har. All other parameters of agonist interactions with the cardiac beta-adrenoceptor for the MR/Har and MNRA/Har rat strains were similar [the IC50 for displacement of ICYP binding by isoproterenol, the accompanying Hill coefficients in the Gpp(NH)p present and absent condition, the Kd of the high- and low-affinity states in the absence of Gpp(NH)p, and the Kd of the uniform low-affinity state in the presence of Gpp(NH)p]. We hypothesize that the strain-dependent differences in high-affinity state formation reported here may account for some of the in vivo differences in cardiovascular function previously demonstrated in the Maudsley rats.", 
    "49": "In a non-double-blind, prospective, randomized study, the intra-operative electrocardiograms of 128 mildly hypertensive surgical patients were examined in order to determine the incidence of myocardial ischemia during anesthesia. No patient had been receiving chronic antihypertensive therapy prior to the study, but a single small oral dose of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (labetalol, atenolol, or oxprenolol) was given to 89 of them along with premedication. Forty-four per cent of the untreated control patients and 61% of the patients pretreated with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent had normal preoperative electrocardiograms and no risk factors for coronary artery disease other than hypertension (this difference between groups was not statistically significant). During tracheal intubation and/or emergence from anesthesia, a brief, self-limited episode of myocardial ischemia was detected in 11 of 39 untreated control patients, and in two of 89 patients pretreated with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (P less than 0.001). Tachycardia always accompanied the ischemic events, but a conspicuous increase in blood pressure did not. The authors conclude that mild hypertension, when untreated prior to the induction of anesthesia, is associated with a high incidence of myocardial ischemia; and that a single small oral dose of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, given with pre-medication, can significantly reduce that risk.",

Hexamethonium, a ganglion blocker, and propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, markedly inhibited the hyperglycemic response to stimulation of the lateral part of the PBD (LPBD). In contrast, phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocker, and atropine methylnitrate, a muscarinic blocker, had no effect. Because previous studies showed that bilateral lesions of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) eliminated hyperglycemia induced by intracranial injection of 2-deoxy-D-glucose and that blinding largely suppressed the hyperglycemia, the effects of these two treatments on hyperglycemia induced by electrical stimulation of the LPBD were examined. SCN lesions abolished the hyperglycemic response but did not affect the hyperglucagonemic response. Results 4 wk after orbital enucleation were similar to those after SCN lesions. These findings suggest that the SCN and a beta-adrenergic mechanism are involved in the hyperglycemic response to LPBD stimulation.", 
    "51": "A randomized double-blind multicenter study compared a new oral beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, betaxolol 10 to 40 mg (n = 71), with atenolol 25 to 100 mg (n = 75). Each drug was administered once daily for 24 weeks in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) measurements were taken 24 hours after dosing. Each drug produced significant (p less than 0.01) reductions in mean supine diastolic BP. The mean decrease in supine diastolic BP with betaxolol was significantly greater at weeks 4, 6, 10 and 12 (p less than 0.05). Throughout the remainder of the trial (weeks 14 to 24), no significant differences in BP reduction were noted between treatment groups. Normotension (supine diastolic BP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) was achieved in 72% of those given betaxolol compared with 52% of those given atenolol (p less than 0.05). The most common side effects noted were bradycardia, fatigue and headache. The incidence of these and of central nervous system side effects was similar between the betaxolol and atenolol groups. Both agents were well tolerated. At recommended doses, betaxolol once daily may be more effective than atenolol once daily in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "52": "Although several studies suggest beta blockers (BB) are effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias, less is known about their role in the treatment of patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias associated with impaired left ventricular function. To assess the tolerance and efficacy of these agents, 32 patients presenting with either ventricular fibrillation (18) or sustained ventricular tachycardia (14) were studied during BB therapy. Left ventricular dysfunction (mean ejection fraction 29%) was present as a consequence of coronary artery disease (26) or cardiomyopathy (6). Baseline arrhythmia assessment revealed recurrent ventricular tachycardia in all patients. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy including BB was guided by programmed stimulation (10), exercise testing (8), ambulatory monitoring (12), or was given empirically (2). Beta blockers were well tolerated, as measured by exercise duration, which improved significantly, and by long-term maintenance, which continued in 23 of 32 (72%) patients. Over a mean follow-up of 668 days, patients treated with BB had a relatively low incidence of both sudden (3%) and nonsudden (9%) death. Thus, BB can be effective and well tolerated adjunct therapy in patients with a history of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in the setting of impaired left ventricular function.", 
    "53": "Sixteen beta-adrenergic receptor blockers were screened for their mutagenic potential using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. All except penbutolol were found to be nonmutagenic. Penbutolol was cytotoxic to human fibroblasts and Chinese hamster V79 cells. These effects could be due to its ability to induce DNA-strand breaks detected by hydroxyapatite chromatography, which remained unrepaired within 1 h of incubation. Under the same conditions strand-breaking activity of propranolol, timolol and indenolol could not be detected. Three potential impurities of penbutolol were ineffective in causing DNA-strand breakage and one metabolite of this drug was found to be nonmutagenic.", 
    "54": "Beta-blockade has been reported to have beneficial hemodynamic effects in chronic congestive heart failure that may be related to alterations in the abnormal neurohumoral profile characteristic of this population. To determine the relationship of the neurohumoral profile to the hemodynamic response to beta-blockade in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, neurohumoral and hemodynamic variables were measured in 10 subjects having congestive cardiomyopathy at baseline and after administration of the beta-blocker pindolol. Baseline stroke index was noted to have an inverse curvilinear relation with plasma norepinephrine (r = -0.69) and renin (r = -0.71) concentration. Pulmonary vascular resistance demonstrated a direct logarithmic relation with plasma norepinephrine concentration (r = 0.68). Increases in norepinephrine, dopamine, and epinephrine concentrations after dosing were noted, with the most marked increase in norepinephrine concentration being coincident with a significant decline in stroke volume index. Two patients not tolerating beta-blockade were characterized by having baseline norepinephrine concentrations 3 SD higher than those of the remaining patients, more marked increases in epinephrine concentration after dosing, and the most profoundly decompensated heart failure at baseline, as defined by the relationship between neurohumoral and hemodynamic variables. These observations suggest that increases in catecholamines after dosing reflect a compensatory response to the adverse hemodynamic-inotropic effects of beta-blockade in congestive heart failure. The neurohumoral profile and the relationship of neuroendocrine to hemodynamic parameters may be useful in delineating patients at risk for adverse hemodynamic effects of beta-blockade.", 
    "55": "To assess the safety of combined intervention in acute myocardial infarction, a pilot study of thrombolysis and beta-adrenergic blockade was performed. Twenty-five subjects were randomized to therapy with intravenous (IV) metoprolol and IV streptokinase (group 1) or to IV metoprolol (group 2) alone. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed before intervention and five days later. The mean time from onset of symptoms to intervention was 1.92 hours. No major adverse reactions related to the intervention were observed in either group. Significant improvement from baseline was observed with combined therapy on both the biplane mean ejection fraction (p less than .02) and a calculated wall motion index of regional wall motion abnormalities (p less than .002). The presumed reperfusion rate was significantly higher in group 1 (p less than .03). Intravenous metoprolol and IV streptokinase in combination was found to be safe in the acute phase of acute myocardial infarction when administered to appropriate patients without contra-indications and deserves further study.", 
    "56": "Esmolol, an intravenous, ultrashort-acting beta-blocker, was studied for its ability to safely control supraventricular arrhythmias up to 24 hours in 15 postoperative cardiothoracic surgery patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter and rapid ventricular response. Esmolol obtained an initial therapeutic response in nine (60 percent) patients. Mean heart rate for the 15 patients was reduced from 139 +/- 12 beats/min before therapy to 106 +/- 21 beats/min during esmolol infusion (p less than 0.01). The mean time to a therapeutic response after initiation of therapy, using a multistep titration regimen (500 micrograms/kg/min loading infusions over one minute, prior to incremental titration steps from 50 to 300 micrograms/kg/min over 4 to 14 minutes), was 22 +/- 9 minutes, and therapy was continued for 17 +/- 9 hours in responders. Esmolol significantly lowered blood pressure in the group studied and resulted in mild supine or orthostatic hypotension in ten (67 percent) patients. Side effects, including hypotension (10/15 patients), gastrointestinal disturbances (2/15), and weakness or somnolence (6/15), were transient and were not associated with serious clinical sequelae. We conclude that esmolol is effective for rate control in a majority of postoperative cardiothoracic surgery patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter. Side effects, although mild, occur relatively frequently, limiting prolonged infusions and warranting close surveillance of patients.", 
    "57": "The effects of bromoacetylaminomenthylnorepinephrine (BAAN) on the sodium-dependent, high-affinity norepinephrine (NE) uptake system in rat brain synaptosomes and CNS neuronal cultures were investigated. BAAN inhibited [3H]NE uptake into synaptosomes in a dose- and time-dependent manner (IC50, 6.5 microM). Pretreatment of cortical synaptosomes or neuronal cells with BAAN alone, followed by washing to remove free drug, reduced the Vmax but did not alter the Km value for [3H]NE uptake. The BAAN-induced reduction in Vmax was attenuated by concurrent pretreatment with desipramine and blocked by the reaction of BAAN with dithiothreitol or cysteine. In contrast, BAAN was 19-fold less potent at inhibiting [3H]dopamine uptake in striatal synaptosomes, and no change in the Vmax or Km value for [3H]dopamine uptake was observed after a pretreatment with BAAN followed by washing. Furthermore, the irreversible beta-antagonist, bromoacetylalprenololmentane, was equipotent to BAAN for inhibiting [3H]NE uptake into cortical synaptosomes, but did not alter the Vmax or Km for [3H]NE after pretreatment. In neuronal cultures, BAAN inhibited sodium-dependent uptake of [3H]NE (IC50, 5.6 microM) with no effect on sodium-independent uptake. After pretreatment of cultures with 30 microM BAAN followed by washing, there was a 74% decrease in the Vmax for [3H]NE uptake. Following a 24-h lag period, uptake recovered to the control level within 48 h; however, recovery was completely blocked by cycloheximide. The data indicate that BAAN irreversibly binds to the [3H]NE uptake system in both CNS synaptosomes and neuronal cultures and may be a useful probe for studying the turnover of the [3H]NE uptake system.", 
    "58": "The effects of alpha 1-adrenergic agents on GH release and intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) were investigated in purified rat somatotroph preparations. Phenylephrine (PHE) stimulated in vitro GH release; the maximal effect (2.5-fold stimulation) occurred at 1 microM PHE. The effect was completely blocked by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine and partially counteracted by the beta-antagonist propranolol. Experiments with the fluorescent Ca2+ probe fura 2 show that PHE causes [Ca2+]i to rise from 178 +/- 31 nM (mean +/- SE; n = 25) to 370 +/- 55 nM (n = 9). This effect was complete within 20 sec and was maintained for at least 5-10 min. The rise was rapidly interrupted by administration of 1 microM phentolamine. The beta-receptor agonist isoproterenol caused a small [Ca2+]i rise due to action on alpha 1-adrenoreceptors. The PHE-induced [Ca2+]i rise showed two components: an initial peak due to Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores and a subsequent rise due to Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space. Somatostatin (SRIF) lowered both resting [Ca2+]i and Ca2+ influx stimulated by PHE. Pertussis toxin pretreatment did not modify PHE-induced [Ca2+]i changes, while it completely prevented the effect of SRIF on both resting and triggered [Ca2+]i, thus suggesting that a GTP-binding protein sensitive to the toxin is involved in the transduction of SRIF action. The increase in cAMP induced by cholera toxin pretreatment modified neither PHE nor SRIF action on [Ca2+]i. In conclusion, in rat somatotrophs Ca2+ mobilization and influx are stimulated by alpha 1-adrenergic agents, and this triggered [Ca2+]i rise results in a stimulation of GH release. In these cells SRIF is able to reduce both resting [Ca2+]i levels and [Ca2+]i increases induced by alpha 1-adrenergic activation.", 
    "59": "The recent elucidation of the primary structure of the cell membrane-bound beta-adrenoceptor has prompted us to explore putative ligand binding sites on this physiologically important receptor. By minimizing the energies of the 'prototype' ligand propranolol, (part of) the receptor and the proposed ligand-receptor complex with the aid of force field and quantum chemical calculations, we identified amino acid residue Trp313 as a highly probable candidate for interaction with the aromatic moiety of propranolol. The charge distribution on the indole nucleus of another beta-blocker, pindolol, with higher affinity for the beta-adrenoceptor, enables an even stronger interaction with the tryptophan residue. The carboxylic amino acid residue Glu306, located near the extracellular space of the cell membrane, interacts favorably with the positively charged nitrogen atom in the aliphatic side chain of the ligands. Finally, this putative model is discussed in the light of recent findings in mutagenesis studies, and compared to other ideas with respect to ligand-receptor interactions.", 
    "60": "Baclofen (a GABAB agonist) stimulates body temperature, metabolic rate and brown adipose tissue (BAT) in the rat through a central action, but no effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) itself on these parameters were observed. In the present study, it was found that the central effects of (+/-)baclofen (0.5-2.0 micrograms injection i.c.v.) on the temperature (1.2 degrees C increase) and metabolic rate (44-76% increase) of brown adipose tissue were inhibited by previous treatment with the GABAA agonist, muscimol (0.05 micrograms). Injection of GABA alone (12 micrograms) did not significantly affect these parameters, but in the presence of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline (2.5 micrograms), GABA significantly increased the temperature (0.3 degrees C) and oxygen consumption (22%) of brown fat. (-)Baclofen was found to be approximately 50-times more effective in stimulating the temperature of brown adipose tissue than (+/-)baclofen. The results indicate that activation of central GABAB receptors stimulates the activity and hence metabolic rate of brown adipose tissue. However, activation of the GABAA receptors opposes the effects of GABAB stimulation on the thermogenesis of brown fat.", 
    "61": "Existing reports on the effects of beta-adrenergic antagonists on lordosis behavior appear contradictory, with (+/-) propranolol being reported to inhibit, and (+/-) pindolol to facilitate this behavior. In the present study, both the (-) and (+) optical isomers of propranolol were effective in inhibiting lordosis behavior in ovariectomized rats treated with estrogen and progesterone. This finding suggests that the lordosis-inhibiting effects of propranolol were not due to blockade of beta-adrenergic activity, but rather to the membrane stabilizing effect of the drug. An observed inhibition of lordosis following the peripheral administration of the local anesthetic lidocaine is consistent with this possibility. (+/-) Propranolol had no effect 30 min after peripheral administration in estrogen-treated, ovariectomized rats with low baseline levels of lordosis behavior. (+/-) and (-) pindolol, but not (+) pindolol also inhibited lordosis 30 min after administration. However, in addition to its antagonist effects, pindolol acts as a partial agonist in some tissues. Centrally active doses of the pure beta-antagonist (+/-) metoprolol produced no inhibitory effects. Indeed, metoprolol reversed the inhibitory effect of the beta-agonist (+/-) salbutamol. This suggests that the lordosis-inhibiting effects of pindolol were due to its partial agonist effects. Taken together, the present data indicate that activity at central beta-adrenoceptors inhibits rather than facilitates lordosis behavior.", 
    "62": "In 12 patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension we assessed by 2-D pulsed Doppler flowmetry the influence of a 6-month effective treatment with enalapril or atenolol on peripheral hemodynamics. The patients were studied in control conditions, at the end of the 6-month pharmacologic treatment, and 2 weeks after the withdrawal of the therapy. In spite of a comparable fall in blood pressure, the effects of the two drugs on forearm hemodynamics were quite different. Enalapril induced a fall in vascular resistance and an increase in brachial artery diameter, flow, and compliance, while atenolol failed to modify all these parameters. In the enalapril group the improvement in forearm vascular resistance and brachial artery compliance persisted after the 2-week washout period. This latter observation raises the possibility that enalapril may reverse structural changes in the large arteries.", 
    "63": "Drugs like epinephrine or isoproterenol can enhance fibrinolytic activity of blood. It is still a matter of debate whether this effect can be totally or only partially blocked by beta-receptor blockers. We have developed a dog model for ex vivo measurement of the fibrinolytic activity using a spectrophotometric assay employing human plasminogen, chromogenic plasmin substrate and human fibrinogen-BrCN digests for the stimulation of t-PA. After i.v. administration of isoproterenol the fibrinolytic activity increased, but this could be seen only in the presence of fibrinogen-BrCN digest in the test system. This suggests that isoproterenol caused higher levels of dog t-PA. Pretreatment with the beta-blocker propranolol completely blocked the increase in t-PA.", 
    "64": "1. The subtype specificity of beta-adrenoceptors in foetal (20 days post coitum) rat liver membrane preparations has been determined by use of [125I]-iodopindolol binding assays and the characteristics of radioligand binding have been resolved. 2. The kinetics of radioligand association and dissociation (in the presence of 5 x 10(-4) M isoprenaline) showed an association rate constant of 1.5 x 10(7) M-1 S-1 and dissociation rate constant of 9.1 x 10(-4) S-1, corresponding to a dissociation constant for [125I]-iodopindolol of 60.7 pM. A similar dissociation constant (75 pM) was determined by saturation binding assays. 3. The rank order of potency for displacement of [125I]-iodopindolol binding was consistent with binding to a predominantly beta 2-adrenoceptor population (i.e. ICI 118551 greater than isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than atenolol). Computer analysis of displacement curves in the presence of a beta 1-subtype selective agent (atenolol) or a beta 2-subtype selective agent (ICI 118551) revealed the presence of beta 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptor subtypes in a ratio of about 80:20%. 4. Saturation binding assays by use of [125I]-iodopindolol were carried out at different perinatal ages to determine total beta-adrenoceptor concentrations and beta 2-subtype (in the presence of 5 x 10(-7) M atenolol) adrenoceptor concentrations. Competition binding assays with atenolol confirmed that at all ages apparent beta 2-adrenoceptor binding accounted for 84-95% of the total beta-adrenoceptor binding. The total beta- and beta 2-adrenoceptor binding capacity increased by 2.3 fold from 20 days post coitum to birth, and then decreased postnatally at 1 and 2 days post partum. The dissociation constant for [125I]-iodopindolol binding did not show any change with age. 5. The change in beta 2-adrenoceptor concentration with age is discussed in relation to the changing beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responsiveness of glucose production by rat liver during perinatal development.", 
    "65": "beta-Adrenoceptor binding on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of healthy adult volunteers was investigated using the radioligand 125iodo-cyanopindolol (ICYP). Saturation binding studies were performed with nine different concentrations of ICYP. Receptor density and affinity were calculated by Scatchard plots. Resolution of beta-adrenoceptors into those with high and low affinity state of the beta-adrenoceptor was obtained from inhibition curves with salbutamol using Hofstee plots. Receptor density on enriched B-cells ('B-cells') was two-fold higher than on enriched T-cells ('T-cells') (P less than 0.025). Affinity (KD values) of beta-adrenoceptors did not differ for B- and T-cells. However, when two distinct binding states for beta-adrenoceptor agonists were identified using salbutamol displacement curves, beta-adrenoceptors on T-cells presented more receptors in a high affinity state than those on B-cells (P less than 0.01). Since the ability of an agonist to activate adenylate cyclase is closely correlated with the ratio of low to high affinity states formed in the presence of the agonist, increased intrinsic activity for the beta-adrenoceptor agonist on T-cells may be postulated. In conclusion, determination of the B/T ratio is a prerequisite for interpretation of beta-adrenoceptor changes on peripheral lymphocytes in various diseases.", 
    "66": "A novel method for the determination of timolol in pharmaceutical products has been developed and is described. The method employs high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on silica dynamically modified with the cetyltrimethylamomonium cation to quantitate the analyte. The use of this type of reversed-phase HPLC system for timolol determinations results in improved quality of chromatography, especially in terms of peak tailing and peak efficiency, in comparison to chromatography on bonded-phase silica. Column-to-column as well as manufacturer-to-manufacturer reproducibility for this separation on silica columns has been obtained and is better in our hands than that encountered with bonded-phase column packings. The method has been shown to be linear for the compounds studied, comparably accurate and precise to bonded-phase methods and specific for timolol in a variety of pharmaceutical formulations. Under the conditions specified, timolol can be successfully separated from its three potential degradates. Possible explanations of the primary retention mechanisms for the analytes are offered.", 
    "67": "The effects of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and magnesium on the interaction of 1-isoproterenol with beta-adrenoreceptors were studied in myometrial membranes from nonpregnant and late-pregnant (0.9 gestation, term 65 days) guinea pigs. The affinity of the beta-adrenoreceptor for 1-isoproterenol, as measured by inhibition of (-)125I-cyanopindolol binding, was increased by 10 mM MgCl2. The addition of 250 microM GTP reversed this process. In the presence of MgCl2, the competition curves could be resolved into two affinity states of the beta-adrenoreceptor, high and low, respectively. The ratio of the dissociation constant of the high-affinity state to that of the low-affinity state was significantly higher in late-pregnant than in the nonpregnant animals. In the presence of GTP, there was only one (low-affinity) state of the receptor detectable. In both groups of animals, the interaction between beta-adrenoreceptor agonists and myometrial beta-adrenoreceptors was positively modulated by MgCl2. This process was reversed by GTP. However, there appeared to be a differential regulation of the ability of the myometrial beta-adrenoreceptor to form a high-affinity state, depending on the reproductive state of the animal.", 
    "68": "Interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) expression was assessed, using anti-Tac monoclonal antibody, after incubation of human lymphocytes with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (PRO). One-hour incubation of mononuclear cells (MNC) with PRO resulted in an increase of Tac positive cells. The greatest rise was observed with a PRO concentration of 10(-6) M (29% ring-stained cells compared with 0% in the control group). Cells cultured for 3 days with PRO showed a lower proportion of Tac positive cells (11%). Fifty-one per cent of MNC cultured with PHA for 3 days expressed IL-2R. Addition of PRO to PHA cultures increased IL-2R expression even more (65%). Enhancement of IL-2R expression after only 1 h incubation with PRO may be due to exposure of formerly synthesized receptor, which can be uncovered by some agents such as PRO.", 
    "69": "Melanophore-stimulating hormones (MSHs) from chum salmon cause pigment dispersion in isolated melanophores of medaka, a teleost. The in vitro medaka melanophore bioassay that responded to light with pigment dispersion and to the dark with pigment aggregation was utilized for measuring the activity of melanotropic hormones. alpha-MSH I was the most potent melanophore-dispersing agent tested. The minimal dose for the induction of pigment dispersion was 10(-15) M alpha-MSH I, 10(-13) M N-des-acetyl(Ac)-alpha-MSH, and 10(-11) M beta-MSH I, respectively. The melanosome-dispersing activity of beta-MSH I was enhanced about 40% by salmon N-acetyl-endorphin I (N-Ac-EP). The results suggest that N-Ac-EP may act as an enhancer for the activity of certain MSHs. The present bioassay provides a unique method for determining the biological activity of melanotropic peptides.", 
    "70": "The possibility that catecholamines modulate the erythropoietin-induced increase in production of cyclic AMP was investigated by examining the effect of erythropoietin and/or L-isoprenaline on the activity of the plasma membrane adenylate cyclase of anaemic rabbit bone marrow erythroblasts. Membranes isolated from cells cultured in the presence of both hormones exhibited both the transient stimulation of basal activity characteristic of erythropoietin action and the loss of the in vitro response to L-isoprenaline, concomitant with the loss of beta-adrenergic receptors, characteristic of L-isoprenaline stimulation. The presence of erythropoietin during cell culture with L-isoprenaline had no effect on the desensitization or number of beta-adrenergic receptors. The stimulation of adenylate cyclase by erythropoietin was observed also in the presence of the beta-antagonist propranolol, when both were added either to whole cells or to isolated membranes. We conclude that these two hormones activate adenylate cyclase independently of each other, via different receptors, with little evidence of cross-modulation.", 
    "71": "Isolated rings from the proximal and distal ends of the bovine epicardial anterior descending coronary artery and guinea pig tracheal rings were mounted in tissue baths for the measurement of isometric contraction and relaxation, and spontaneously beating rabbit atria were prepared for measurement of chronotropic response. All tissues were exposed to phenoxybenzamine to block tissue uptake of catecholamines and alpha adrenoceptors. The arterial and tracheal rings were contracted with 25 mM K+ in order to observe agonist-induced relaxation. Beta adrenergic agonist dose-response curves were obtained in all tissues in the presence and absence of the beta-2 selective antagonist, ICI 118,551. The orders of agonist potencies in the proximal and distal coronary arteries and the rabbit atria were the same: namely, isoproterenol (ISO) greater than norepinephrine (NE) much greater than procaterol. In contrast, that in the guinea pig trachea was procaterol greater than ISO greater than NE. Procaterol was a weak, partial agonist in the bovine coronary artery and rabbit atria and a potent, full agonist in the guinea pig trachea. The ICI 118,551 pA2 values in the proximal segment of the bovine coronary artery were the same against both NE and fenoterol, 7.38. In the distal segment, the values were 7.33 and 7.14, respectively. ICI 118,551 -log KB values in the rabbit atria, 6.81 and 6.83 for NE and ISO, respectively, were slightly below those in the coronary artery segments, whereas -log KB values in the guinea pig trachea were substantially higher, 8.19 and 8.81 for fenoterol and procaterol, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "Acting alone or in concert with pituitary gonadotropins, catecholamines have recently been shown to enhance androgen production by ovarian theca-interstitial cells. It is the objective of the in vitro studies reported herein to further characterize this catecholaminergic activity as well as to type and subtype the putative adrenergic recognition sites mediating this phenomenon. Treatment of collagenase-processed whole ovarian dispersates or highly enriched (greater than 90%) theca-interstitial cells from immature rats with norepinephrine (10(-6) M) resulted in a 2.0-fold increment in the accumulation of androsterone (3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-androstane-17-one), the main androgenic steroid identified in culture medium by HPLC. Qualitatively similar stimulation was obtained using beta (isoproterenol)- but not alpha (methoxamine)-selective adrenergic agonists. Moreover, combined treatment with both norepinephrine (10(-6) M) and hCG (1 ng/ml) unmasked a synergistic interaction subject to stereospecific blockade by beta (propranolol)- but not alpha (phentolamine)-selective adrenergic antagonists. Further probing with subtype-selective adrenergic ligands revealed terbutaline (a beta 2-selective agonist) to enhance androgen biosynthesis, with dobutamine (a beta 1-selective agonist) having little or no effect. Moreover, a beta 2 (ICI-118406)- but not a beta 1 (ICI-89406)-selective adrenergic antagonist yielded dose-dependent inhibition of the isoproterenol effect. Unaccounted for by either enhanced cellular growth or an alteration of the overall steroidogenic pattern, catecholaminergically stimulated androgen biosynthesis proved time and dose dependent but independent of the hCG dose (0.1-10 ng/ml) employed. Binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol to highly enriched theca-interstitial cells proved stereoselective and saturable, displaying a single class (Hill coefficient = 0.96 +/- 0.01) of high affinity (Kd = 5.6 X 10(-11) M), low capacity (1219 +/- 317 sites/cell) binding sites. The rank order of competitive potencies of selective adrenergic ligands (beta 2 greater than beta 1 greater than alpha), was consistent with a beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtype. Taken together, these findings suggest that catecholaminergic stimulation of ovarian androgen biosynthesis is mediated via beta 2-adrenergic recognition sites, the role of which may now be studied.", 
    "73": "The effects of systemic administration of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) on the concentration and affinity of myometrial beta-adrenoreceptors were studied in non-pregnant, previously oophorectomized guinea pigs receiving a continuous infusion of E2, P, a combination of the two hormones, or placebo for 7 days. Myometrial beta-adrenoreceptors were characterized by using (-)-[125I-cyanopindolol as the specific beta-adrenoreceptor ligand. Compared to that in the control group, E2 administration resulted in a 7-fold increase in the density of myometrial beta-adrenoreceptors. Administration of P alone resulted in a significant increase in both beta-adrenergic receptor concentration and the receptor dissociation constant (Kd). Finally, a combination of E2 and P treatment did not result in any synergistic or additive effect for the beta-adrenergic receptors, while the Kd was twice that of the control or E2-treated animals. We conclude that systemic administration of these sex steroid hormones, directly or indirectly, modulates myometrial beta-adrenergic receptor concentrations and their ligand affinity.", 
    "74": "This study examined the abilities of methimazole, propylthiouracil (PTU) and propranolol to exert an immunosuppressive effect in vitro. Incubation of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) with propranolol showed the drug to have no effect on either B- or T-cell activity. Methimazole or PTU at concentrations of greater than or equal to 10(-5)M resulted in significantly lower amounts of IgG and IgM being released into the culture medium. Both drugs were also found to have a direct effect on T-cell function as they caused the percentage of total and suppressor cells to increase towards normal levels. The three drugs were all found to have some free radical scavenging ability. These ranked PTU greater than methimazole greater than propranolol. These in-vitro findings would suggest that both methimazole and PTU have some direct effect on the immune system. It would seem more likely however that these effects are mediated via interleukin 2 rather than by their ability to act as free radical scavengers.", 
    "75": "The contribution of mast cell subtypes and their different mediators to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive lung diseases (COLD) has not yet been established. In the present study, enzymatic digestion, centrifugal elutriation and Percoll gradient centrifugation were used to obtain two populations of mast cell subtypes from human lung tissue. Mast cell subtypes were challenged with anti-human IgE, propranolol, compound 48/80, or opsonized zymosan. Both subtypes were able to release histamine, but differed in the amount of the amine release. Only the formalin-sensitive and alcian blue-positive type (FS-AB) released histamine on challenge with opsonized zymosan. The same subtype was able to release leukotriene C4 (LTC4) after challenge with anti-human IgE. The other subtype, the formalin-insensitive and alcian blue-positive type (FI-AB), did not respond to opsonized zymosan and did not release LTC4 after challenge with anti-human IgE. Stimulation with propranolol or compound 48/80 did not release histamine from the FS-AB mast cells while the FI-AB mast cells released only about 10% of their histamine content upon challenge with these secretagogues.", 
    "76": "The liberation of histamine from rabbit blood platelets during aggregation as well as the effect of propranolol and atenolol on this process was investigated. Thrombin, but not ADP, liberated histamine from platelets in a dose-dependent manner. This liberation was influenced by beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs and some modes of action are discussed.", 
    "77": "Propranolol liberates histamine from isolated mast cells and decreases the uptake of extracellular histamine in a dose-dependent way. Histamine liberation due to propranolol is accompanied by calcium displacement from intracellular storage sites. The significant increase in membrane fluidity due to propranolol is temperature dependent. The perturbation of membranes is most probably the explanation of propranolol's interaction with isolated rat mast cells which results in altered histamine transportation.", 
    "78": "Neurons projecting from the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) to the spinal cord are important in blood pressure control. The present experiments examined the role of spinal adrenoreceptors and serotonin receptors in mediating the pressor effects of electrical stimulation of the RVLM. Accordingly the effects on blood pressure of electrical stimulation of the RVLM were studied before and after intrathecal administration of adrenergic or serotonergic antagonists in normotensive and hypertensive rats. Electrical stimulation in the area of the RVLM-B3 serotonin-containing neurons in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats increased blood pressure, and the pressor responses were reduced by intrathecal methysergide (30 and 100 micrograms). Similar findings were seen in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In WKY, electrical stimulation in the area of the RVLM-C1 epinephrine-containing neurons, increased mean arterial pressure (MAP), but the pressor responses were unaffected by intrathecal phentolamine (15 micrograms), pindolol (2 micrograms), or methysergide (30 and 100 micrograms), or saline. The results suggest that the pressor effects of stimulation of the RVLM-B3 area are mediated at least in part through activation of spinal serotonin receptors. The lack of effect of phentolamine and pindolol on the RVLM-C1 area pressor responses raises a question regarding the importance of spinal adrenergic receptors in mediating these effects.", 
    "79": "Acebutolol is a relatively new beta-adrenoceptor blocking antagonist, possessing both beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity and partial agonist activity (PAA). Its acute (24 h, 400 mg, twice daily) and long-term effects (3 weeks) on systemic and renal hemodynamics, body fluid volumes, hormones, and beta-adrenoceptor density on lymphocytes were studied in a single-blind placebo-controlled trial, in 10 hypertensive patients. The initial response to acebutolol (1-2 h) was a fall in heart rate (HR) (-9.6 +/- 2.7%), cardiac output (-16.0 +/- 3%), and stroke volume (SV) (-10.7 +/- 0.2%), and an increase in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (18.0 +/- 3.9%). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) began to fall 2-3 h after dosing in parallel with a decrease in SVR. At the end of the acute study, MAP and SVR were decreased by 18.1 +/- 2.7% and 15.6 +/- 5.6%, respectively. By that time, HR and SV had returned to control values despite blockade of beta-adrenoceptors. After 3 weeks of treatment (mean dose of acebutolol 480 mg twice daily), the fall in MAP was 10.1 +/- 2.7% and HR was decreased by 13.0 +/- 2.3%. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate did not change. Acute and long-term treatment had no effect on the density of lymphocyte-membrane beta-adrenoceptors. This could be explained by acebutolol's beta 1 selectivity or, alternatively, this could be due to the drug's PAA.", 
    "80": "This study was performed to determine the subtype of muscarinic receptors involved in the action of cholinergic stimuli on prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in the isolated rabbit heart perfused at a constant flow rate with Krebs Hanseleit buffer. Acetylcholine (ACh, 1.0-10.0 nmol), an M1 and M2 receptor agonist, and arecaidine propargyl ester (APE, 1.0-5.0 nmol), a selective M2 agonist, produced a dose-related increase in the output of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and a decrease in heart rate, whereas 4-[m-chlorophenyl carbamoyl]-2-butynyl-trimethylammonium chloride (McN-A-343, 10 nmol-1.0 mumol), a selective M1 receptor agonist, did not alter PG output. The increase in PG output or the decrease in heart rate elicited by ACh or APE was abolished by atropine (0.1 microM), an M1 and M2 receptor antagonist, and by 11-[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6-H-pyrido-[2,3-b] [1,4]-benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX-116, 1.0 microM), a selective M2 antagonist, but not by pirenzepine (1.0 microM), a selective M1 antagonist. The developed tension, which was also reduced by ACh and APE, but not by McN-A-343, was minimized by AF-DX-116 and not by lower concentrations of pirenzepine that attenuated the coronary vasodilator effect of McN-A-343. Lower doses of ACh (1.0-5.0 nmol) caused coronary vasodilation, whereas higher doses of ACh (10.0 nmol) and lower as well as higher doses of APE produced a biphasic effect--an initial vasodilation followed by vasoconstriction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
