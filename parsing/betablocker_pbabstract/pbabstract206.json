This study aimed to investigate the effects of non-selective (propranolol), and selective beta1- (atenolol, metoprolol and betaxolol) and beta2-adrenoceptor (ICI 118,551) antagonists in the nitric oxide (NO)-mediated rabbit corpus cavernosum relaxations induced by either electrical field stimulation (EFS) or activators of voltage-gated sodium channels. The sodium channel blockers tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin abolished the relaxations induced by EFS or sodium channel activators of binding site-2 (aconitine and veratridine), site-3 (Ts3 toxin), site-4 (Ts1 toxin) and site-5 (brevetoxin-3). The beta-adrenoceptor antagonists failed to affect the relaxations induced by EFS, aconitine and veratridine. Relaxations induced by Ts3 and Ts1 toxins, as well as brevetoxin-3, were markedly reduced by prior addition of propranolol, betaxolol and ICI 118,551. During the established relaxation induced by Ts3 toxin, propranolol failed to restore the basal tone. In conclusion, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may cause an allosteric inhibition at the binding site-3, -4 and -5 of voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to blockade of neural NO release.",

    "2": "The study sample consisted of 20 140 patients with acute coronary syndromes from the international GRACE registry. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to determine predictors of quality performance. Quality indicators were use of aspirin and beta-blockers within 24 hours and at hospital discharge, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors at discharge, and in-hospital mortality.", 
    "3": "Use of medications in eligible patients at discharge ranged from 73% for ACE inhibitors to 93% for aspirin. High-risk features (eg, heart failure, older age) were related to failure to use aspirin and beta-blockers. Being at a teaching hospital and care by a cardiologist were associated with better use of aspirin and beta-blockers. Coronary artery bypass surgery was associated with failure to use ACE inhibitors and aspirin. When hospitals were divided into quartiles of quality performance, adjusted in-hospital mortality was 4.1% in the top versus 5.6% in the bottom quartile, representing a 27% (95% confidence interval: 11% to 42%) lower relative mortality.", 
    "4": "Identification of factors associated with failure to use proven treatments, including high-risk groups that would derive particular benefit from effective therapies, provides an opportunity to focus quality improvement interventions. The association of lower hospital mortality with better use of selected medical treatments supports their measurement to improve quality of care.", 
    "5": "We examined the inhibitory sympathetic beta-adrenergic mechanisms in peripheral lung, bronchi and trachea of an equine model of recurrent airway obstruction (RAO), to support the hypothesis that the beta-adrenergic receptor dysfunction is not only restricted to cell surface receptor density but rather encompasses a mechanistic defect apart from the receptor, to the intracellular signaling components. The non-asthmatic lung possessed 3.2-fold more beta-adrenergic receptors than bronchi (496 +/- 19.4 vs. 155.1+/- 19.6 fmol/mg protein; P < 0.01) and 6.2-fold higher than in the trachea (79.8 +/- 12.6 fmol/mg protein; P < 0.001) (assessed by radioligand binding assays using (-)-[(125)I]-iodocyanopindolol, ICYP) and in all tissues a greater proportion of the beta(2)- than the beta(1)-subtype (75-80%). The receptor density (B(max)) in lung parenchyma and bronchial membranes was 33 and 42%, respectively, lower (P < 0.001) in RAO than in control animals, attributable to a decrease in the beta(2)-subtype. This receptor down-regulation was accompanied with an attenuated coupling efficiency of the receptor to the stimulatory G(S)-protein (P < 0.05 vs. control). Concomitantly, activation of adenylate cyclase evoked by isoproterenol was significantly reduced in lung and bronchial membranes of animals with RAO, whereas effects of 10 microM GTP, 10mM NaF, 10 microM forskolin and 10 mM Mn(2+) were not altered. There was no difference in beta-adrenergic receptor density, G(S)-protein or adenylate cyclase coupling in the trachea between asthmatic and control animals. In conclusion, in stable asthma the pulmonary beta-adrenergic receptor-G(S)-protein-adenylate cyclase system is impaired, thus the pathologic process involves all signaling components, and due to its close similarity, this animal model seems to serve as a suitable model, at least partly, of chronic asthmatic patients.", 
    "6": "Phymatodes scolopendria (Burm.) Ching (Polypodiaceae) is widely used in the Eastern coast of Madagascar to treat respiratory disorders. Bioassay-guided fractionation using guinea pig trachea pre-contracted with histamine to monitor the activity led to the isolation of 1,2-benzopyrone (coumarin) as the main active constituent. Effectively, it induced a concentration-dependent relaxation of the histamine with a median effective concentration (EC(50)) of 35.03 microg/ml, or carbachol (EC(50) = 33.41 microg/ml) pre-contracted guinea pig trachea, and also provoked 100% relaxation at 72.10 microg/ml. It was less active either on KCl pre-contracted trachea (EC(50) = 130.78 microg/ml) or endothelium denuded trachea (153.4 +/- 22 microg/ml). It inhibited, in a non-competitive manner, the histamine and the external calcium spasm effect on the isolated trachea but it did not significantly modify the broncho-constrictive activity of KCl. When combined with theophylline, coumarin produced a significant additive relaxing effect on pre-contracted trachea. Furthermore, its bronchodilator effect was not blocked by propranolol. In vivo, pre-treated guinea pig with coumarin showed significant resistance to histamine inhalation, with an adequate dose protecting 50% of the tested animals (AD(50)) of 75 mg/kg. These results indicate that the bronchodilator effect of coumarin is partly due to the endothelium-dependent tracheal relaxation, and may be mediated through a non-specific tracheal relaxation.",

Newer, vasodilating, nonselective beta-blockers do not have the same adverse metabolic consequences observed with earlier beta-blockers. Recent evidence has shown that they have a neutral effect on metabolic parameters and lipid profile. They do not promote insulin resistance and can be used safely in heart failure patients with diabetes.",

    "11": "The effect of drugs from the class of cardiac (methyldigoxin, verapamil, propranolol), antiepileptic (carbamazepine), sedative (diazepam) and antihistaminic (promethazine) drugs on Na,K-ATPase activity of plasma membranes was studied in rat brain synaptosomes. Methyldigoxin in a concentration of 0.1 mmol/l inhibits enzyme activity by 80 %. Verapamil, propranolol and promethazine in concentrations of 20, 20 and 2 mmol/l respectively, entirely inhibit the ATPase activity. Carbamazepine and diazepam in concentrations of 0.02-60 mmol/l have no effect on the activity of this enzyme. According to the drug concentrations that inhibit 50 % of enzyme activity (IC(50)), the potency can be listed in the following order: methyldigoxin promethazine verapamil ? propranolol. From the inhibition of commercially available purified Na,K-ATPase isolated from porcine cerebral cortex in the presence of chosen drugs, as well as from kinetic studies on synaptosomal plasma membranes, it may be concluded that the drugs inhibit enzyme activity, partly by acting directly on the enzyme proteins. Propranolol, verapamil and promethazine inhibitions acted in an uncompetitive manner. The results suggest that these three drugs may contribute to neurological dysfunctions and indicate the necessity to take into consideration the side effects of the investigated drugs during the treatment of various pathological conditions.", 
    "12": "The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of the template/functional monomer proportion on the achievement of molecularly imprinted hydrogels with cavities with a high enough affinity for the drug to sustain drug release. Imprinted hydrogels were prepared from N,N-dimethylacrylamide and tris(trimethylsiloxy)sililpropyl methacrylate (DMAA and TRIS; main components), methacrylic acid (MAA; functional monomer), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA; cross-linker), and timolol (template drug). Photo-polymerization of the monomer solutions was carried out in poly(propylene) molds (0.3 mm thickness) to obtain contact lens-like devices. Non-imprinted control hydrogels were also prepared in the same way but without the addition of timolol. The imprinted hydrogels showed a higher affinity for timolol and a slower release rate than the non-imprinted hydrogels. The release rate decreased by increasing the MAA/timolol ratio in the gel recipe. Hydrogels prepared with 400 x 10(-3) M MAA, 600 x 10(-3) M EGDMA, and a timolol/MAA mole ratio of 1:16-1:32 had drug diffusion coefficients two orders of magnitude below those of non-imprinted hydrogels. The results obtained clearly indicate that the timolol release rate is critically affected by the conditions under which the hydrogels were synthesized. These effects are discussed on the basis of the influence of drug proportion on the conformation of the imprinted cavities.", 
    "13": "Different polymorphisms of the ADRB2 gene encoding the beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) are associated with changes in a variety of responses of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). In this study, we have investigated the distribution of frequencies of ADRB2-related allelic variants (Arg16Gly, Gln27Glu, Thr164Ile) in the Colombian population, as well as the influence of the Gln27Glu polymorphism as a risk factor for the development of dyslipidemia following propranolol administration. Genotyping was performed in unrelated Colombian volunteers, using PCR-RFLP methods. To examine the association between the Gln27Glu polymorphism of the ADRB2 gene and dyslipidemia induced by propranolol, we recruited 19 healthy individuals who were homozygous for either the Gln27 (wild-type, N = 11) or the Glu27 (homozygous mutant, N = 8) genotype. Electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body mass index (BMI), serum lipid levels (T-CHO, HDL-CHO, TG), and fibrinogen were determined before and after propranolol administration. The distribution of genotypes was as follows: Arg16Arg 46%, Arg16Gly 47.4%, Gly16Gly 6.6%, Gln27Gln 44.7%, Gln27Glu 48.2%, and Glu27Glu 7.1%, with allelic frequencies of 69.7% for Arg16, 30.3% for Gly16, 68.8% for Gln27, and 31.2% for Glu27. The Thr164Ile polymorphism was found only in one subject, who was heterozygous for the isoleucine variant. Significant changes in physiological parameters (HR, SBP, DBP) have been found in association with ADRB2 variants in both native and mutant subgroups after propranolol intake. HDL-CHO levels diminished (p = 0.005) in native homozygous individuals (Gln27Gln), whereas TG levels were found increased (p = 0.012) in the mutant homozygous individuals (Glu27Glu). T-CHO levels and serum fibrinogen levels remained unaltered in both subgroups. The evidence that subjects homozygous for Gln27 in the ADRB2 gene show a significant reduction of HDL-CHO levels, as well as the increased TG levels in subjects homozygous for Glu27 after propranolol administration, suggest that the Gln27Glu polymorphism represents a risk factor for dyslipidemia induced by propranolol. These results may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying dyslipidemia induced by ADRB2 antagonists.", 
    "14": "In isolated rat pancreatic alpha-cells, glucose, arginine, and the sulfonylurea tolbutamide stimulated glucagon release. The effect of glucose was abolished by the KATP-channel opener diazoxide as well as by mannoheptulose and azide, inhibitors of glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism. Glucose inhibited KATP-channel activity by 30% (P<0.05; n=5) and doubled the free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. In cell-attached recordings, azide opened KATP channels. The N-type Ca2+-channel blocker omega-conotoxin and the Na+-channel blocker tetrodotoxin inhibited glucose-induced glucagon release whereas tetraethylammonium, a blocker of delayed rectifying K+ channels, increased secretion. Glucagon release increased monotonically with increasing K+ concentrations. omega-Conotoxin suppressed glucagon release to 15 mM K+, whereas a combination of omega-conotoxin and an L-type Ca2+-channel inhibitor was required to abrogate secretion in 50 mM K+. Recordings of cell capacitance revealed that glucose increased the exocytotic response evoked by membrane depolarization 3-fold. This correlated with a doubling of glucagon secretion by glucose in intact rat islets exposed to diazoxide and high K+. In whole-cell experiments, exocytosis was stimulated by reducing the cytoplasmic ADP concentration, whereas changes of the ATP concentration in the physiological range had little effect. We conclude that glucose stimulates glucagon release from isolated rat alpha-cells by KATP-channel closure and stimulation of Ca2+ influx through N-type Ca2+ channels. Glucose also stimulated exocytosis by an amplifying mechanism, probably involving changes in adenine nucleotides. The stimulatory action of glucose in isolated alpha-cells contrasts with the suppressive effect of the sugar in intact islets and highlights the primary importance of islet paracrine signaling in the regulation of glucagon release.", 
    "15": "In patients with severe heart failure (CHF), chronically elevated cytokine levels document a systemic inflammation. Experimental data suggest that activation of the beta-adrenergic system may participate in this inflammatory response. Herein, we studied as to whether beta-adrenergic blockade on top of standard CHF therapy affects plasma cytokine levels (interleukin-6 [IL-6] and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFalpha]). Moreover, we studied if beta-blocker related changes of these cytokines correspond to changes in left ventricular (LV) function and exercise capacity.",

Metoprololsuccinate was administered in increasing dosages (up to 190 mg/day) for the following 3 months.

In CHF patients, 3 month of beta-blockade lowered heart rate (84+/-14 vs. 68+/-12 bpm; p<0.01), systolic (131+/-7 vs. 118+/-6 mm Hg; p<0.01), and diastolic blood pressure (78+/-5 vs. 71+/-6 mm Hg; p<0.01). Spiroergometric determined VO2 max (17.8+/-4.5 vs. 19.8+/-4.3 ml/min kg; p=0.013) increased significantly during 3 month of beta-blockade. Moreover, LV functional parameters tended to improve but the interindividual response varied and changes were non-significant. Interestingly, IL-6 levels decreased markedly during beta-blockade (8.9+/-9.9 vs. 4.5+/-3.1 pg/ml; p=0.036), whereas TNFalpha levels remained unchanged. Moreover, significant positive correlations were found between decrease of IL-6 levels and left ventricular end diastolic diameters (r2=0.59; p=0.012), whereas an inverse correlation was found between the decrease of IL-6 and the increase of VO2 max (r2=0.54; p=0.037), respectively.",

Treatment with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and aspirin was used on a similar scale among women and men. In-hospital complications and use of intravenous drugs were strongly associated with severity of disease in a similar way among women and men. The mortality rates at 30 days were 12.4% and 7.4% in MI with and without ST-segment elevation, but only 1.3% and 1.0% in unstable angina of high- and low-risk types.

    "23": "The ascending aorta or pulmonary trunk in congenital heart disease may dilate out of proportion to hemodynamic or morphogenetic expectations, may become aneurysmal, and may rupture. A bicuspid aortic valve and/or coarctation of the aorta are consistently associated with ascending aortic and para-coarctation medial abnormalities. Congenital heart diseases such as single ventricle, truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great arteries and tetralogy of Fallot are also associated with aortic medial abnormalities. Aortic regurgitation in unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot imposes volume overload on both ventricles. A significant subset of adults late after repair of tetralogy of Fallot exhibits progressive aortic root dilatation which may lead to regurgitation and predispose to dissection and rupture which can be fatal, and necessitating aortic valve and aortic root surgery. The aortic dilatation relates medial abnormalities coupled with previous long-standing volume overload of the ascending aorta. Risk factors for aortic dilatation and regurgitation in tetralogy of Fallot relate to specific hemodynamic abnormalities such as pulmonary atresia, right aortic arch and a history of an aorto-pulmonary shunt, and patient demographics such as male sex and the association of chromosome 22q11 deletion. There is no current consensus on beta-blocker administration for limiting progressive dilatation of the aortic root in patients with congenital heart disease and repaired tetralogy of Fallot. Aortic root surgery should be considered for these patients and address aortic regurgitation and or prevent the risk of aortic dissection. Meticulous follow-up of the aortic root after repair, tetralogy of Fallot are thus recommended.",

    "32": "A kinetic spectrophotometric method has been described for the determination of metoprolol tartrate in pharmaceutical formulations. The method is based on reaction of the drug with alkaline potassium permanganate at 25+/-1 degrees C. The reaction is followed spectrophotometrically by measuring the change in absorbance at 610 nm as a function of time. The initial rate and fixed time (at 15.0 min) methods are utilized for constructing the calibration graphs to determine the concentration of the drug. Both the calibration graphs are linear in the concentration range of 1.46 x 10(-6)-8.76 x 10(-6) M (10.0-60.0 microg per 10 ml). The calibration data resulted in the linear regression equations of log (rate)=3.634+0.999 log C and A=6.300 x 10(-4)+6.491 x 10(-2) C for initial-rate and fixed time methods, respectively. The limits of quantitation for initial rate and fixed time methods are 0.04 and 0.10 microg ml(-1), respectively. The activation parameters such as E(a), DeltaH(double dagger), DeltaS(double dagger) and DeltaG(double dagger) are also evaluated for the reaction and found to be 90.73 kJ mol(-1), 88.20 kJ mol(-1), 84.54 J K(-1) mol(-1) and 63.01 kJ mol(-1), respectively.

Five or 10 mg of carvedilol was orally administered to 23 subjects (22-44 years old), and blood samples were taken at 2 and 6 h after dosing. We determined the polymorphic alleles of CYP2D6 in each subject. The whole blood concentration of R- and S-carvedilol was measured by an HPLC method. The pharmacokinetic parameters in individual subjects were estimated by the Bayesian method using the nonlinear mixed effects model (NONMEM) program. The mean values of oral clearance for R- and S-carvedilol were estimated to be 1.01 and 2.15 l/h/kg, respectively. The oral clearance was highly correlated with the apparent volume of distribution among the subjects, suggesting that the interindividual difference in bioavailability was largely responsible for the pharmacokinetic variability of carvedilol. The oral clearance and also volume of distribution of both enantiomers were significantly lower in the subjects with the CYP2D6*10 allele than with the CYP2D6*1/*1 or *1/*2 genotype. These results suggested that the systemic and/or pre-systemic metabolism of R- and S-carvedilol in the liver is significantly decreased in Japanese with the CYP2D6*10 allele.",

    "47": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a powerful independent risk predictor for cardiovascular disease and reversal of LVH has become a primary goal of antihypertensive management. Recent evidence has confirmed that most hypertensive patients will benefit from a low-dose combination strategy to manage their hypertension, and two trials have recently examined the effect of this strategy on left ventricular mass. The REASON study (pREterax in regression of Arterial Stiffness in a contrOlled double-bliNd study) compared the low-dose combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a diuretic with beta-blocker monotherapy in hypertensive patients with LVH, and the PICXEL study (Preterax In a double-blind Controlled study versus Enalapril in LVH) compared the same low-dose combination with ACE inhibitor monotherapy in hypertensive patients with echocardiographic LVH. The REASON study demonstrated that the low-dose combination produced a significantly greater change in left ventricular mass after 1 year than the beta-blocker, despite inducing a similar change in mean blood pressure. Additionally, perindopril/indapamide reduced central (carotid) and peripheral (brachial) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) to a significantly greater extent than beta-blocker, and these benefits were more pronounced for the central values; LVH is affected more by central rather than peripheral haemodynamic changes. Results of the analysis of the PICXEL study showed a significantly greater decrease in LVH parameters and blood pressure over 1 year in favour of the low-dose combination. This reduction cannot be entirely explained by the better efficacy of the low-dose combination on blood pressure reduction.", 
    "48": "The endothelium is a favourite early target of cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular diseases like hypertension. This key role of the endothelium results from its capacity to respond to numerous autocrine and paracrine stimuli and to mechanical factors like shear stress but also from the pathophysiological consequences of endothelial dysfunction on vasomotor tone, arterial stiffness, arterial remodelling, and inflammation, all of which are factors that play a critical role in atherosclerosis and target-organ damage. In hypertension, endothelial dysfunction has been shown at the level of both resistance and conduit arteries and mainly results from an increase in nitric oxide (NO) degradation by interaction between NO and superoxide anions, while in experimental models of hypertension a decrease in NO production can also be observed. The fact that forearm endothelial dysfunction is a marker of future cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension stresses the importance of the clinical evaluation of endothelial function and of the evaluation of the effects of the different antihypertensive drug classes on this parameter. In this context, many studies have demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the perindopril-indapamide combination, and angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1) blockers improve endothelium-dependent vasodilatation partly independently of arterial pressure. Both their antioxidant effects and the stimulation of the release of NO are involved in their beneficial effects. For calcium antagonists, only the recent drugs have been shown to improve endothelial function with a simultaneous improvement in several markers of oxidative stress. Finally, beta-blockers classically do not affect endothelial function. Only nebivolol, a beta-blocker with NO donor properties, has been shown to improve endothelial function, but this effect results from the increase in NO and not from the beta-blocking properties of the drug.", 
    "49": "Physicochemical properties of sodium alginate-magnesium aluminum silicate (SA-MAS) composite films were investigated and a potential as a film former of SA-MAS dispersion for modifying drug release from tablets was evaluated as well. Interaction between SA and MAS in the composite films was revealed using FTIR spectroscopy. Thermal behavior of the composite films was changed due to the complexation of SA and MAS. Powder X-ray diffractometry data suggested that a higher crystallinity of the composite film and a phase-separated microcomposite were formed. The composite films in the ratios of 1:0.5 and 1:1 showed the increases of tensile strength and percentage of elongation when compared with SA films. Water vapor permeability of the composite films tended to increase with increasing ratio of MAS. The decreases in water uptake and drug permeability in 0.1 M HCl were found in the composite films. A positive charge drug, propranolol HCl, provided a higher affinity on the composite films than a weakly acidic nonelectrolyte, acetaminophen, resulting in a longer lag time and a higher partition coefficient depending on the content of MAS in the composite films. This was due to the complex formation of propranolol HCl and MAS. Using SEM, the tablets coated with SA-MAS dispersion had a smooth surface, while those with SA dispersion showed a pinholing on the surface, resulting in a faster drug release. The drug release profiles of the tablets could be modified by coating with the composite film at different coating levels. This finding suggests that MAS could improve physicochemical properties of the SA films, leading to a novel coating material of the SA-MAS dispersion for modifying drug release from tablets.", 
    "50": "Since the late 1950s, new-onset diabetes has been a recognized adverse effect of some antihypertensive drugs. Although diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus have changed greatly since then, epidemiologic and physiologic studies suggest that there are differences in glucose tolerance and incident diabetes across antihypertensive drug classes. Data about incident diabetes are now available from 16 long-term, randomized, clinical trials of antihypertensive drugs. From traditional meta-analyses, the rank-ordering of the drug classes is: beta-blocker approximately thiazide diuretic > placebo approximately calcium antagonist > angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor approximately angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Earlier studies indicated that most individuals who developed incident diabetes were \"pre-diabetic\" before beginning antihypertensive therapy, and ipso facto had increased cardiovascular risk compared with individuals with normal glucose tolerance. An earlier diagnosis of diabetes mellitus generally has little impact (over 5 years) on cardiovascular risk. The clinical importance of differential effects of antihypertensive drugs on incident diabetes is, therefore, much less clear.",

Intravenous administration of D-sotalol (0.3 mg kg(-1)) and terfenadine (0.3 mg kg(-1)), blockers of a rapid component of delayed rectifier potassium currents, prolonged the QT interval by 32+/-7 and 23+/-6 ms, respectively, whereas chromanol 293B (1 mg kg(-1)), a blocker of a slow component of delayed rectifier potassium currents, lengthened it by 33+/-8 ms. The extent of the QT interval prolongation by these drugs was greater than those in previous reports using pentobarbital-anaesthetized guinea-pigs. The MAP duration at the control was shortened by decreasing the pacing cycle length from 400 to 200 ms, but the MAP duration at each cycle length was prolonged by D-sotalol. The formulas of Van de Water, Matsunaga, Fridericia and Bazett showed good correlation of the repolarization period when compared with the MAP duration at a pacing cycle length of 400 ms. The halothane-anaesthetized guinea-pig model may possess enough sensitivity to detect drug-induced QT interval prolongation, indicating that halothane anaesthesia can reduce the repolarization reserve of the heart in vivo.",

The influence of concomitant food intake on drug release from the matrix-in-cylinder system was also studied. During the first 10 h after administration, the matrix-in-cylinder system resulted in similar plasma levels as the reference formulation Inderal. The concomitant intake of a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast did not cause dose-dumping. Between 10 h and 24 h after administration of the matrix-in-cylinder system, a remarkable increase of the propranolol plasma levels was noticed (compared to Inderal). This effect was even more pronounced under fed conditions. The matrix-in-cylinder system had a relative bioavailability of 156% (fasted conditions) and 222% (fed conditions) compared to the marketed reference product. In order to elucidate the origin of this increased bioavailability, Caco-2 experiments and dog lymph studies were performed.

By exposing cells that had been pre-treated with doxorubicin to oxidized-LDL, a LOX-1 agonist, in the presence or in the absence of k-carrageenan, a LOX-1 receptor antagonist, we documented that doxorubicin-induced LOX-1 expression plays a role in inducing apoptosis.

Spontaneously hypertensive rats, 8 weeks old, were treated with olmesartan, atenolol, or vehicle in their drinking water for 56 days. At the end of each treatment, arterial pressure and heart rate were measured, the ratio of heart weight to body weight was calculated, collagen deposition in the heart was determined histochemically using picrosirius red staining, and wall-to-lumen ratio in isolated mesenteric arteries was measured by a videographic approach. At 3 weeks after the initiation of treatment, rats medicated with olmesartan showed lower values of systolic BP compared with rats given atenolol or vehicle, whereas no difference in directly measured BP were observed at the end of study in anesthetized rats given olmesartan or atenolol. Rats given atenolol showed sustained bradycardia, whereas cardiac hypertrophy and collagen deposition was prevented only in spontaneously hypertensive rats given olmesartan. Olmesartan or atenolol reduced arteriolar wall-to-lumen ratio (olmesartan: 11.5+/-0.4%; atenolol: 13.3+/-0.6%; vehicle: 18.4%+/-1.1); however, this effect was greatest in rats medicated with the angiotensin II type 1 antagonist.

The in vivo permeability of verapamil and propranolol were determined by single-pass in situ intestinal perfusion in rat. The gene expression profiles were measured using Affymetrix GeneChip. Correlation analysis between drug in vivo permeability and expression of 3500 genes was performed with nonparametric bootstrap and ANOVA analysis. The permeability of verapamil and propranolol did not demonstrate regional dependency even though significant differences in gene expression were observed in various regions of the intestine. Verapamil permeability significantly correlates with propranolol permeability in both jejunum and ileum, but did not correlate with the permeability of other hydrophilic compounds (valacyclovir, acyclovir, and phenylalanine). Four different regions (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon) showed distinct gene expression patterns with more than 70-499 genes showing at least 5-fold expression differences. Interestingly, P-gp expression is gradually increased by 6-fold from the duodenum to colon. Despite the distinct gene expression patterns in the various regions of the intestine, verapamil permeability did not correlate with any gene expression from 3500 expressed genes in the intestine. A 2-6-fold P-gp expression difference did not seem to associate verapamil permeability in the various intestinal regions in vivo. These data suggest that P-gp plays a minimal role in the in vivo intestinal absorption process of verapamil with high water solubility and high membrane permeability. The intestinal absorption of verapamil in vivo is primarily dominated by its high permeability. However, it is important to note that the findings in this paper do not undermine the importance of P-gp in oral drug bioavailability, drug disposition from the liver, drug efflux from the blood-brain barrier, and drug-drug interaction.", 
    "79": "Dextromethorphan, a noncompetitive blocker of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type of glutamate receptor, at 45, 60 and 75 mg/kg, ip doses induced a behavioural syndrome characterised by reciprocal forepaw treading, lateral head-weaving, hind-limb abduction and flat body posture. Such type of behavioural syndrome is induced by 8-hydroxy-2- (di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) by directly stimulating the central postsynaptic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) receptors of the 5-HT1A type. Pretreatment with buspirone (5, 10 mg/kg, ip) and l-propranolol (10, 20 mg/kg, ip) antagonised the behavioural syndrome induced by 8-OH-DPAT and dextromethorphan. Pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine (100 mg/kg/day x 4 days) antagonised the behavioural syndrome induced by dextromethorphan and dexfenfluramine but had no significant effect on 8-OH-DPAT induced behavioural syndrome. This indicates that dextromethorphan induces the behavioural syndrome by releasing 5-HT from serotonergic neurons with resultant activation of the postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors by the released 5-HT. Pretreatment with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, ip) significantly potentiated the behavioural syndrome induced by dextromethorphan and 5-hydroxytryptophan but significantly antagonised dexfenfluramine induced behavioural syndrome. This indicates that dextromethorphan releases 5-HT by a mechanism which differs from that of dexfenfluramine. Dextromethorphan may be releasing 5-HT by blocking the NMDA receptors and thereby counteracting the inhibitory influence of l-glutamate on 5-HT release.",

More recently, beta-arrestin 2 has also been shown to be involved in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades by G protein-coupled receptors independently of G protein activation. Direct interactions between proteins can be monitored using enzyme complementation between two inactive deletion mutants of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal; Deltaalpha and Deltaomega). In the present study, we have used fusion proteins of the human beta(2)-adrenoceptor (C-terminal beta-gal Deltaalpha) and beta-arrestin 2 (beta-gal Deltaomega) to study directly the pharmacology of this interaction in C2C12 cells expressing the beta(2)-adrenoceptor-beta-gal Deltaalpha fusion protein at low physiological levels (38.2 +/- 2.7 fmol . mg protein(-1)). Isoprenaline, noradrenaline, and adrenaline (-log EC(50) = 5.9, 5.5, and 5.7, respectively) stimulated an association between the beta(2)-adrenoceptor and beta-arrestin 2 at much higher concentrations than required for activation of cAMP accumulation (-log EC(50) = 7.6, 6.3, and 7.7, respectively). This was sensitive to inhibition by the beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol, timolol, and ICI 118551. Both salbutamol and terbutaline behaved as partial agonists of beta-gal complementation. Furthermore, the long-acting beta(2)-agonist salmeterol (-log K(D) for inhibition of [(3)H]CGP12177 binding = 8.7) behaved as an antagonist of isoprenaline-stimulated beta(2)-adrenoceptor-arrestin 2 interactions (-log K(D) = 8.0), whereas acting as a full agonist of cAMP accumulation in the same cells (-log EC(50) = 9.2).

    "89": "The objective of the study was to evaluate whether improvements obtained during an intervention programme were maintained after the programme was stopped. 153 patients discharged with a diagnosis of heart failure (HF) were randomized to either usual care or an intervention programme, which included patient education, consultation with the cardiologist and monitoring in the Heart Failure Unit. After an average period of 16+/-8 months, the intervention programme was stopped. One year later, all the patients were re-examined to assess HF readmissions, all-cause mortality, quality of life, and prescribed medical treatment. During the 16+/-8-month treatment period, patients in the intervention group had a lower rate of HF readmissions (17% vs. 51%, p<0.01), less all-cause mortality (13% vs. 27%, p=0.03), improvement in quality of life (1.5+/-0.8 vs. 1.9+/-1, p=0.03) and optimisation of medical treatment was achieved. One year after stopping the intervention, there was no difference in HF readmissions (28% vs. 25%, p=0.72), all-cause mortality (14% vs. 17%, p=0.64) and quality of life (1.7+/-0.9 vs. 1.8+/-1, p=0.24) between the groups. Survival and the probability of not being readmitted due to HF were similar in both groups. There was also a reduction in the use of beta-blockers and spironolactone in the intervention group.",

A total of 107 parturients with arrested first stage of labour owing to inadequate uterine contractility were randomized to receive intravenously once or twice a 2 mg dose of propranolol or placebo combined with oxytocin infusion. The main outcome measure was the effect of intravenous propranolol on the frequency of Caesarean section among parturients with arrested labour. The secondary outcome measures were the duration of labour, the required dosage of oxytocin, CTG readings, neonatal outcome and maternal and cord plasma levels of beta-adrenoceptor-binding component of propranolol. Categorial variables between the groups were compared using Chi square and Fisher's exact tests. Continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test and Student's t-test.",

Seventy-three percent of the parturients in the propranolol group and 85% in the placebo group had spontaneous vaginal delivery, RR=0.86 (95% CI 0.70-1.05). The percentage proportion of the augmented part of labour was significantly shorter in the propranolol group than in the placebo group. No differences in the required oxytocin dosage or CTG pathology were found between the groups. Propranolol was found to be safe for the neonates. The concentrations of its beta-adrenoceptor-binding component after a 2mg intravenous dose were quite similar in parturients and neonates at the time of delivery. The active drug component crossed placental barriers with an average neonate umbilical artery/parturient venous plasma ratio of 0.7. After a 4 mg dose the active drug concentrations in parturients were rather similar to those measured after 2 mg dose, whereas in neonates there were signs of drug accumulation. No picture could be obtained from the kinetics of the beta-adrenoceptor-binding component of propranolol from the data.",

Although studies suggest that several psychotropic medications are sometimes useful for these behavioral problems, response is variable and adverse effects often limit treatment. Theoretical considerations suggest that increasing estrogenic activity or reducing androgenic activity could reduce agitation and aggression in dementia. Estrogen has been reported helpful for these symptoms, but adverse effects are problematic. Chronic administration of the synthetic gonadotropin (luteinising hormone) releasing hormone analogue, goserelin, reduces testosterone activity. Here we describe the apparently sustained elimination of previously treatment-resistant agitation and aggression with goserelin treatment in a 78-year-old male nursing-home resident with Alzheimer's disease.",

The coupling of microseparations with NMR detection is an area of increasing interest owing to the high structural information of NMR. In order to couple efficiently with the separation, the NMR detector must be reduced in size to correspond to that of the separation peak. This paper summarizes some of the approaches used in coupling NMR detection with pressure-driven and electrophoretic microseparations, the design of small NMR detectors and applications of this technology.",

In cITP, ionic analytes are concentrated and separated on the basis of their electrophoretic mobility. Because neutral molecules have an electrophoretic mobility of zero, they are normally not concentrated or separated in electrophoretic experiments like cITP. Most of the analytes studied were concentrated by cITP sample stacking by a factor of around 300. For analytes that formed a strong inclusion complex, beta-CD co-concentrated during cITP sample stacking. However, once the focusing process was complete, a discrete diffusional boundary formed between the cITP-focused analyte band and the leading and trailing electrolyte, which restricted diffusion into and out of the analyte band.",

During the scanning procedure, in which participants were confronted with highly negative emotional pictures, the significant increase in sAA levels in the PL group compared to the BB group persisted. No additional change was noticed in heart rate or blood pressure during scanning in the PL or BB group. The current pharmacological study in the human provides direct evidence for the sensitivity of sAA to changes in adrenergic activation, specifically in reaction to psychological stress.",

    "129": "Astronauts and cosmonauts are exposed to a wide variety of different hazards while in space that include radiation, which presents one of the most critical barriers to long-term missions. A major deleterious effect directly associated with ionizing radiation is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as peroxides and hydroxyl radicals. The free radicals generated by ultraviolet (UV) or ionizing radiation can attack cellular lipids, proteins and DNA. Endogenous free radical scavengers such as glutathione and the polyamines (e.g, spermidine and spermine) can inhibit the action of ROS. In particular, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the enzyme involved in heme protein metabolism, can provide antioxidant protection through the production of the antioxidant bilirubin. Furthermore, polyamines have been shown to indirectly increase HO-1 content and antioxidant protection. The beta2-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol has been shown to stimulate polyamine synthesis and by extension, might provide a margin of antioxidant protection through increasing HO-1 content. However, it is unclear whether the polyamines are acting as a tertiary messengers for antioxidant protection in the be beta2-adrenoceptor signal transduction pathway. The purpose of this study was to study the role of the polyamine pathway in attenuating free radical-induced damage.",

The vasorelaxant effects of labedipinedilol-C on phenylephrine (10 microM)-induced contractions were attenuated by removing endothelium, by pretreatment with soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitors ODQ (10 microM) and methylene blue (10 microM), a NOS inhibitor L-NAME (100 microM), a K channel blocker TEA (10 mM), a KATP channel blocker glibenclamide (1 microM), and Ca-dependent K channel blockers apamin (1 microM) and charybdotoxin (0.1 microM). In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), labedipinedilol-C increased NO release, which was significantly inhibited by L-NAME. The Western blot analysis on HUVECs indicated that labedipinedilol-C increased the expression of eNOS. These results indicate that hypotension effects of labedipinedilol-C result from alpha-adrenoceptor and Ca entry-blocking activities and release of NO or NO-related substance from vascular endothelium. The endothelium-independent relaxation of vascular smooth muscle is probably linked to K channel opening and alpha-adrenoceptor-blocking activities.", 
    "131": "A high prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been reported among idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients. We examined the prevalence of DCM patients with HCV antibody, and the pathophysiological characteristics and responsiveness to neurohormonal antagonism in DCM with HCV. HCV antibodies were determined in 540 patients with cardiac diseases. In 117 DCM patients, clinicopathologic data were evaluated before and 1 year after angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and/or beta-blocker (ACE-inhibitor/BB) administration and their prognosis was followed-up for a mean of 72 +/- 41 months. HCV antibodies were found in 12 of 135 DCM patients (8.9%) and in 37 of 405 patients without DCM (9.1%) (P = NS). At baseline, contrary to DCM without HCV, DCM with HCV was associated (P < 0.05) with greater left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and end-systolic dimension, LV mass, and myocardial diameter in endomyocardial biopsy, and lower % fractional shortening. By multivariate analysis, HCV infection was independently associated with larger LV end-systolic dimension among DCM patients (P = 0.005). The advanced LV dilatation and hypertrophy in DCM with HCV decreased more in response to the ACE-inhibitor/BB therapy compared to DCM without HCV. There were no differences between DCM patients with and without HCV in survival and cardiac event-free rates. In summary, although HCV infection appears not to be the specific cause of DCM, HCV may enhance ventricular remodeling leading to heart failure among DCM patients. Nevertheless, the advanced ventricular remodeling with HCV was adequately reversed by neurohormonal antagonism, and did not lead to an unfavorable outcome.",

In rat aorta, low-affinity state beta1-AR activation produced an endothelium-independent relaxation which was impaired in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). In the present work, we investigated whether renin-angiotensin system was involved in this alteration by evaluating the effects of enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or losartan, an AT1 angiotensin receptor antagonist. Cumulative concentration-response curves to low-affinity state beta1-AR agonists (CGP 12177, cyanopindolol or alprenolol) and to NS 1619, a large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BK) agonist were performed in denuded aortic rings isolated from control or treated Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats or SHRs in different experimental conditions. The low-affinity state beta1-AR-mediated aortic vasodilation was impaired in 5 and 12 weeks old SHRs when compared to age-matched WKY. Twelve days enalapril (5 mg/kg/day) or losartan (15 mg/kg/day) treatments reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) only in 12 weeks old SHRs whereas no significant change was observed in other groups. These treatments improved low-affinity state beta1-AR effect only in SHRs groups. In 12 weeks old WKY rats, CGP 12177-induced relaxation was insensitive to glibenclamide, a K(ATP)+ channel blocker, but was reduced by TEA or iberiotoxin, two large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel (BK) blockers. The impairment of NS 1619-induced vasodilation in both 5 and 12 weeks old SHRs was restored by enalapril or losartan. These results suggested that improvement of the low-affinity state beta1-AR-mediated vasodilation in 5 and 12 weeks old SHRs could be attributed to enhanced BK channels-induced hyperpolarization in SHRs independently of lowering of SBP.",

Recently, nongenomic (smooth muscle relaxation) and genomic (light estrogenic activity) effects of 17alpha-estradiol have been reported, but no reports have yet determined its possible antiestrogenic activity. Therefore, this study investigated: the nongenomic action of 17alpha-estradiol on uterine contractile activity and its potential agonist-antagonist activity on uterine growth.",

Different concentrations (0.2-200 microM) of 17alpha-estradiol were tested on spontaneous contraction and equimolarly compared with 17beta-estradiol. To examine the mechanism of 17alpha-estradiol action, its effect was studied in presence of beta2-antagonist (propranolol), antiestrogens (tamoxifen and ICI 182,780) or inhibitors of protein synthesis (cycloheximide) and transcription (actinomycin D). Moreover, contractions induced by high potassium (KCl) solution or calcium in depolarized tissues by KCl-calcium free solution were exposed to 17alpha-estradiol. Collaterally, we performed an uterotrophic assay in adult ovariectomized rats measuring the uterine wet weight. The administration for three days of 0.3 microM/day/Kg 17beta-estradiol was equimolarly compared with the response produced by 17alpha-estradiol. Antiuterotrophic activity was assayed by administration of 0.3 microM/day/Kg 17beta-estradiol and various doses ratios (1:1, 1:3, 1:5, and 1:100) of 17alpha-estradiol.", 
    "146": "The estradiol isomers elicited an immediate relaxation, concentration-dependent and reversible on spontaneous contraction. 17alpha-Estradiol presented lower potency than 17beta-estradiol although it did not antagonize 17beta-estradiol-induced relaxation. Relaxation to 17alpha-estradiol was not inhibited by propranolol, tamoxifen, ICI 182,780, cycloheximide or actinomycin D. The KCl contractions were also sensitive to 17alpha-estradiol-induced relaxation and calcium contractions in depolarized tissues were markedly prevented by 17alpha-estradiol, implying a reduction of extracellular calcium influx through voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCs). Uterotrophic assay detected significant increase in uterine weight using 17alpha-estradiol, which was significantly minor as compared with 17beta-estradiol. 17alpha-Estradiol, at all doses ratios, significantly antagonized the hypertrophic response of 17beta-estradiol.",

The overall data document a nongenomic relaxing action and a novel antiestrogenic action of 17alpha-estradiol, which are relevant in estrogen-mediated uterine physiology.",

The effects of antihypertensive agents on plasma homocysteine levels have not been tested extensively. We investigated the effects of beta-blocker therapy on homocysteine levels in patients with hypertension. In the study, 120 patients with newly diagnosed hypertension were enrolled. All patients received metoprolol succinate 100 mg/day initially. If blood pressure was above normal on the 15th day of follow-up, the metoprolol dosage was doubled. Before initiation of the antihypertensive medication and after the fourth month of treatment, homocysteine levels were measured. Of the 120 patients enrolled, 39 could not complete the study. Homocysteine levels decreased significantly by the end of the fourth month when compared with basal values (13.5+/-4.5 micromol/l versus 12.4+/-4.9 micromol/l; P = 0.001). There was no relation between homocysteine level and blood pressure control. There was a significant decrease in homocysteine levels in the women treated in this study (P = 0.001); however, this effect was absent in men (P = 0.185). We demonstrate that metoprolol succinate treatment significantly decreases plasma homocysteine levels in patients with hypertension, especially in women.",

    "161": "Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a functional and reversible impairment of renal function in patients with severe cirrhosis. Major pathophysiological elements include liver dysfunction, a circulatory derangement with central hypovolaemia and neurohumoral activation of potent vasoactive systems leading to a pronounced renal vasoconstriction. The prognosis of patients with HRS is poor but recent research has spread new enthusiasm for treatment. Efforts at treatment should seek to improve liver function, to ameliorate arterial hypotension and central hypovolaemia, and to reduce renal vasoconstriction. Therefore a combined approach should be applied with reduction of portal pressure with e.g. ss-adrenergic blockers and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), with amelioration of arterial hypotension and central hypovolaemia with vasoconstrictors such as terlipressin and plasma expanders. New experimental treatments with endothelin- and adenosine antagonists and long-acting vasoconstrictors may have a future role in the management of HRS.",

Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced to the same degree in patients treated with losartan as compared to atenolol. However, IMA decreased significantly only in patients treated with losartan (19.2 vs 17.6 mm2, p = 0.001) and the average relative decrease in IMA during the 3 years of treatment was significantly higher in patients treated with losartan as compared to atenolol (-7.4 vs -2.0%, p<0.05).", 
    "165": "Patients with hypertension and LV hypertrophy had hypertrophy of the common carotid arteries. Losartan, but not atenolol, induced regression of this hypertrophy.

    "166": "Despite the overwhelming evidence of the beneficial effect of beta-blockers in systolic heart failure, questions have been raised as to whether they provide similar benefits to women, the elderly, and blacks. Also, concerns about the use of beta-blockers in diabetes, chronic obstructive lung disease, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) have limited their use in populations with these diseases. A review of the experience generated from the three beta-blocker survival heart failure trials confirms the extension of similar beneficial effects to women, the elderly, blacks, and diabetic patients. There is strong support in the literature for the use of selective beta-blockers in patients with mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and encouraging data on their use in patients with mild to moderate PVD.", 
    "167": "Overwhelming clinical trial evidence confirms the efficacy and safety of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure (HF) caused by systolic dysfunction. beta-Blockers are recommended in national HF guidelines as standard of care therapy. Yet there is also a large body of evidence demonstrating that the use of beta-blockers for HF is seriously inadequate under conventional care. This HF treatment gap is due, in part, to the persistence of perceptions--despite recent evidence to the contrary--that beta-blocker therapy should be delayed until HF patients have been titrated to target doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and have been stable for at least 2 to 4 weeks after hospital discharge, and that early beta-blocker initiation results in a substantial risk of worsening HF. Conversely, recent clinical trial evidence substantiates that beta-blockers significantly reduce the risk of mortality and morbidity, including hospitalization for worsening HF, and have produced early survival benefits in patients with HF. It has also become evident that in-hospital initiation of life-prolonging cardiovascular therapies, including beta-blockers, has a positive impact on clinical outcomes and on long-term patient compliance. Overwhelming clinical evidence suggests that beta-blockers should be administered to all stable HF patients without contraindication and that this therapy should be initiated as soon as possible to ensure that patients derive early and long-term improvements in clinical outcomes.", 
    "168": "Although the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blockers has resulted in significant improvements in the management of heart failure (HF), morbidity and mortality remain high. Therefore, additional approaches have been sought to discover newer agents that might add incremental benefit. Although not all of these approaches have been successful, there have been some notable new approaches to therapy that have shown benefit or may be promising in terms of additional benefit. Most of these agents are targeted to achieve a more global neurohormonal blockade aiming to reduce or potentially reverse the ventricular remodeling process that occurs in HF. Some of the newer approaches aim for targets other than neurohormonal systems, eg, effects on myocardial metabolism or the vasculature. This article reviews the latest advances in pharmacologic therapy in HF, looking at several trials that may have a significant impact on the treatment of HF. We also discuss several newer agents with promising potential in HF management.", 
    "169": "Patients with chronic heart failure have diminished exercise capacity as a major aspect of their clinical syndrome, regardless of the cause of their left ventricular contractile dysfunction. The mechanisms for the reduction in exercise capacity are multifactorial and include central cardiac, peripheral vascular, respiratory, and skeletal muscle maladaptations that accompany the pathophysiology of heart failure. Increased sympathetic nervous system activity and elevations in circulating neurohormones and cytokines also influence the cardiovascular and metabolic responses to exercise in these patients. Despite the improvements in clinical outcomes with beta-blockers and resynchronization therapy in heart failure patients, their exercise capacity remains substantially reduced when compared with normal age-matched patients. Exercise training has the potential to reverse or improve most of the abnormal physiologic responses to exercise in these patients, and it may serve as adjunctive therapy to standard medical care of these patients. In addition, a body of evidence is being accumulated that suggests that exercise training itself has important secondary prevention benefit in these patients. This review identifies the potential mechanisms whereby exercise training may improve exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure and presents the current information regarding clinical outcomes of this therapy.", 
    "170": "The importance of addressing neurohormonal activation in patients after a myocardial infarction is now well-appreciated. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and the sympathetic nervous system can result in improved cardiac function and survival. As we learn more about other systems, we should be able to realize further benefits. In particular, the roles of endothelin, matrix metalloproteinases, and cytokines in remodeling are being investigated, with the potential to result in better outcomes for patients.", 
    "171": "Worsening and progressive heart failure has been the most common mode of death in patients with heart failure. With the development of drugs that primarily have modulation of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems as their mechanism, relative importance of progressive heart failure has decreased. Sudden death has become a larger issue and the dominant mode of death in heart failure. This change requires the clinician to redirect therapy to the prevention and treatment of sudden death.", 
    "172": "The Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) compared the effects of a comprehensive adrenergic antagonist, carvedilol (target dosage 25 mg twice daily), with a beta-1-selective agent, metoprolol tartrate (target dosage 50 mg twice daily), in 3029 patients with chronic heart failure caused by left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The study showed that, compared with metoprolol, long-term treatment with carvedilol exerted a substantially greater reduction in mortality and led to improvement in well-being in these patients. The superiority of carvedilol over metoprolol is readily explained by differences in their pharmacologic profiles. There is no evidence, within the trial or from other sources, that the relative dose of each agent or their formulation explained the observed difference. The result of COMET is entirely consistent with the results of previous placebo-controlled trials of beta-1-selective blockers and carvedilol.", 
    "173": "Therapies that modulate the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. However, they are grossly underused in clinical practice; when used, the doses prescribed are substantially smaller than the target doses used in the large-scale studies that established their utility. Whether these suboptimal doses are as effective in reducing morbidity and mortality is largely unknown. This review focuses on the relationship between the dose of b-blockers and their effect on clinical outcomes. Because direct dose comparisons of b-blockers are limited, we draw upon a broader spectrum of clinical trials across the cardiovascular continuum that involved neurohormonal modulators to address the question, \"Is more better?\"", 
    "174": "Treatment of patients with heart failure caused by left ventricular systolic dysfunction using b-adrenergic receptor antagonists (or b-blockers) results in improvements in symptoms, hemodynamics, left ventricular remodeling, morbidity, and mortality. Most patients studied in prospective, randomized placebo-controlled trials have had New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or III symptoms. The efficacy of b-blockers in treating NYHA class IV patients is not as well-established. This review summarizes the published experience regarding the use of b-blockers in patients with advanced heart failure. Although treatment requires considerable care, the data support attempts at initiation of b-blockers in this group of patients.", 
    "175": "Much clinical experience has led us to assume that the administration of a b-blocker, regardless of dose or frequency, would produce similar mortality benefits in patients with heart failure. The results from the recently published Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET), which found greater benefit of carvedilol than immediate-release metoprolol on mortality, clearly demonstrated this is not true. In heart failure, the COMET results strongly support the use of beta-blockers that have proven effective in large-scale clinical trials. The primary disagreement regarding COMET concerns the explanation of the efficacy difference between the two b-blockers tested. Pharmacodynamic considerations and hemodynamic data from the COMET trial itself suggest there were unequal degrees of b1-blockade between patients receiving carvedilol and immediate-release metoprolol. Failure to achieve a similar degree of b1-receptor blockade in the two groups prevents conclusions regarding the potential incremental benefits of selective versus nonselective adrenergic blockade. Further studies are needed to determine whether there are additional clinical benefits from the inhibition of adrenergic receptors beyond the proven benefits of b1-blockade.", 
    "176": "Therapy for heart failure caused by left ventricular systolic dysfunction is based on interference with maladaptive activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Agents that block beta-adrenergic receptors, decrease angiotensin-II formation, and antagonize the effects of angiotensin II and aldosterone have been shown to improve morbidity and mortality in this syndrome. Therefore, from a theoretical point of view, it would be desirable to actually diminish the degree of overactivity of these two homeostatic systems. There are compelling physiologic arguments and much experimental data to suggest that beta-adrenergic blockade may diminish activity of the RAAS. Conversely, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-II antagonists, and aldosterone antagonists may diminish activity of the SNS. Some clinical trials data may be interpreted in a fashion that suggests that part of the benefit of interfering with each system may relate to diminishing activity of the other. If true, combined therapy may lead to a virtuous cycle in which diminishing the adverse effects of each individual system is combined with reduced activity of the other. Such a cycle may be one factor underlying the impressive clinical results of recent neurohormonally based therapeutic trials and reinforces the need to look beyond acute hemodynamic effects of therapeutic agents when assessing their long-term impact in heart failure.", 
    "177": "This review examines the clinical benefit of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in patients with severe heart failure symptoms and interventricular conduction delay. The magnitude of CRT effects on exercise duration, quality of life, and reversal of adverse remodeling are compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy and combined beta-blocker/ACE inhibitor therapy. Overall, CRT delivers substantial improvement in clinical well-being to an extent similar to or greater than what would be expected with neurohormonal intervention alone.", 
    "178": "Clinical research during the past several decades has shown the importance of cardiac remodeling as a basic mechanism in the progression of heart failure. Changes in cardiac remodeling have high concordance with long-term clinical outcomes. Cardiac remodeling should be regarded as a primary target for treatment and also can serve as a reliable surrogate for clinical outcomes. Neurohormonal blockade with combination treatments that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic systems has proven effective in improving cardiac remodeling and clinical outcomes. Such treatment should be standard therapy for patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction and patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "179": "Contactless conductivity detection is successfully demonstrated for the enantiomeric separation of basic drugs and amino acids in capillary electrophoresis (CE). Derivatization of the compounds or the addition of a visualization agent as for indirect optical detection schemes were not needed. Non-charged chiral selectors were employed, hydroxypropylated cyclodextrin (CD) for the more lipophilic basic drugs and 18-crown-6-tetracarboxylic acid (18C6H4) for the amino acids. Acidic buffer solutions based on lactic or citric acid were used. The detection limits were determined as 0.3 microM for pseudoephedrine as an example of a basic drug and were in the range from 2.5 to 20 microM for the amino acids.", 
    "180": "Diabetic patients frequently develop heart failure and have a guarded prognosis because of the combination of diabetic cardiomyopathy, hypertension and ischaemic heart disease. The lack of patient awareness of the association between diabetes and cardiovascular disease contributes to the risk of heart failure in the diabetic population. Therefore, physicians should consider the risk of comorbidities and use appropriate screening tests to achieve early identification and initiate preventive strategies. There is evidence suggesting that adequate glycaemic control may improve cardiac metabolism and myocardial function in diabetics with heart failure. Improvement in cardiac function engendered by neurohumoral inhibition is associated with a decrease in mortality that is at least as great in the diabetic patients with heart failure as it is in the non diabetic patients. However, several therapeutic interventions have not yet been specifically validated in diabetic subjects. Thus, physicians should be encouraged to use therapies tested in the diabetic population, such as B-blockers and ACE inhibitors. Diabetic patients would benefit from more aggressive preventive programs aimed at reducing the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", 
    "181": "This paper aims at comparing two meta-analyses of clinical trials having investigated the effect of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system either with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or with a selective angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) on the incidence of new cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus in subjects with arterial hypertension or with congestive heart failure. The protection appears similar with ACEIs in six trials in a total of 24.623 patients (hazard ratio: 0.77; CI 95% 0.72-0.81; p < 0.00001 and with ARBs in five trials in a total of 14.344 patients (hazard ratio: 0.79; CI 95% 0.73-0.85; p < 0.00001). It is consistent whatever the comparator, a thiazide diuretic agent, a beta-blocker, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or a placebo. The large ongoing ONTARGET controlled study will allow a direct comparison between an ACEI, ramipril, and an ARB, telmisartan, and will also investigate the potential benefit of a combined treatment with both drugs. The inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system should be considered among pharmacological strategies of prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus.", 
    "182": "The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which common genetic variants can explain the variation of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) plasma levels in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). FH is characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although low HDL-C levels have been shown to affect the severity of the clinical phenotype, little is known about the factors that determine HDL-C levels in these patients. A cohort of 1002 heterozygous FH patients was genotyped for polymorphisms in the genes encoding for ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, apolipoprotein (apo) AIV, apoCIII, apoE, cholesteryl transfer ester protein, hepatic lipase, lipoprotein lipase, and two paraoxonases. Multiple linear regression showed that, together, these polymorphisms explain only 3.9% of the variation of HDL-C plasma levels. When significant two-way interactions between the polymorphisms were also taken into account, the explained variation rose to 12.5%. In a regression model that also incorporated sex, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, and concomitant beta-blocker use as covariates, the explained variation of HDL-C plasma levels even increased to 32.5%. This study provides direct evidence that multiple, modestly penetrant, but highly prevalent, polymorphisms can explain a substantial part of the variation of HDL-C plasma levels in a representative large cohort of heterozygous FH patients.",

    "193": "Forty-three patients scheduled for their 6-week post-ICD placement noninvasive electrophysiologic study were included in the study at the Arrhythmia Procedure Laboratory at Hartford Hospital, Hartford, CT. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation was approved by the Hartford Hospital Institutional Review Board.", 
    "194": "After 2 seconds of continuous VF, 7 consecutive VFCLs were measured from the ICD device recording printout using a 0.5 mm scale ruler under magnification at baseline and after the infusion of catecholamines (epinephrine or norepinephrine at 2 mcg/min) or matching placebo at steady state. The average VFCL and the cvVFCL were determined for each study phase. Subgroup analysis based on chronic beta-blocker use was performed. No between-group differences were noted for epinephrine, norepinephrine, or placebo group for baseline (P=0.538) or postinfusion VFCL (P=0.749) or for baseline (P=0.561) or postinfusion cvVFCL (P=0.623) Regardless of catecholamine group randomization, longer pre- and postinfusion VFCL were noted in those receiving beta-blockers (P=0.157, P=0.019) but no differences in cvVFCL were noted (P=0.216, P=0.474) versus those without beta-blockers, respectively.", 
    "195": "Moderately dosed epinephrine or norepinephrine does not affect either VFCL or the variability of VFCL after short duration of ventricular fibrillation. Chronic cardioselective beta-blockade prolongs VFCL without any impact on coefficient of variation of VFCL.", 
    "196": "Nervous and immune systems mutually cooperate via release of mediators of both neurological and immunological derivation. Adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) is a product of the hypothalamus-pituitary adrenal axis (HPAA) which stimulates secretion of corticosteroids from adrenals. In turn, corticosteroids modulate the immune response in virtue of their anti-inflammatory activity. On the other hand, catecholamines, products of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), regulate immune function by acting on specific beta-adrenergic receptors. Conversely, cytokines released by monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes, upon antigenic stimulation, are able to cross the blood-brain-barrier, thus modulating nervous functions (e.g., thermoregulation, sleep, and appetite). However, cytokines are locally produced in the brain, especially in the hypothalamus, thus contributing to the development of anorexic, pyrogenic, somnogenic and behavioural effects. Besides pathogens and/or their products, the so-called stressors are able to activate both HPAA and SNS, thus influencing immune responses. In this respect, many studies conducted in medical students taking exams have evidenced an array of stress-induced immune alterations. Phobic disorders and migraine without aura (MWA) represent examples of stress-related disorders in which phagocytic immune deficits, endotoxemia and exaggerated levels of proinflammatory cytokines [Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF- alpha), and interleukin- 1 beta] have been detected. Quite interestingly, administration of a thymic hormone could ameliorate clinical symptoms in phobic patients. In MWA patients, a beta-blocker, propranolol, could mitigate migraine, whose cessation coincided with a drop of TNF-alpha serum concentration. In phobic disorders and in MWA, benzodiazepines are very often administered and, in this respect, some of them, such as diazepam, inhibit immune functions, while others, e.g., alprazolam, enhance immune responses. Alprazolam could improve clinical symptoms in MWA patients. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a disorder whose etiology and pathogenesis are still unknown. In this syndrome both abnormalities of nervous and immune systems have been reported. Despite many immune parameters evaluated in CFS no specific biomarkers of disease have been found. Our own data are in agreement with current literature in that we found decreased levels of serum (IFN)-gamma in these patients, thus indicating a predominance of T helper (h)1 response in CFS. Also leptin, a hormone which regulates food intake, fluctuates within normal ranges in CFS individuals. Quite interestingly, in depressed patients, used as controls, leptinaemia was more elevated than in CFS. Finally, in a series of recent therapeutic trials several immunomodulating agents have been used, such as staphypan Berna, lactic acid bacteria, kuibitang and intravenous immunoglobulin. In conclusion, it seems that major drug targets in stress-related disorders are immune cells in terms of inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines and modulation of Th responses. In particular, according to recent evidences, antidepressants seem to exert beneficial effects in experimental autoimmune neuritis in rats by decreasing IFN- beta release or augmenting NK activity in depressed patients."
