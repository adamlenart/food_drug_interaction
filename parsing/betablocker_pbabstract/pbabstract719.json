Solubilized receptors were then reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles by the addition of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and removal of detergent. Vesicles were separated from residual soluble receptors and detergent by rate-zonal ultracentrifugation. Vesicles were monolamellar, 500-900 A in diameter, and had a lipid content of 6 mumol phospholipid/mg protein. Specific binding of the beta-adrenergic ligand [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DNA) was 0.9-1.9 pmol/mg protein. Reconstitution of receptors into vesicles restored their ability to bind [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol ([125I]IHYP). This ligand does not bind to detergent-solubilized receptors. [125I]IHYP binding was saturable [Kd = 84 pM] and competed appropriately with (+) and (-) isomers of beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists. These receptor vesicles therefore appear to be an excellent model system for the study of beta-adrenergic receptor function in a defined lipid milieu.", 
    "1": "Progesterone appears to be the physiological inducer of meiosis in amphibian oocytes. In Rana pipiens, dl-propranolol mimics the action of progesterone and both agents have a common action in producing a rapid [45Ca] efflux and a fall in intracellular cAMP followed by nuclear breakdown. Comparison of the rate of hydrolysis of injected [3H]-cAMP and of the conversion of injected [3H]-ATP to [3H]-cAMP followed exposure to meiotic inducers and inhibitors indicates that adenylate cyclase and not phosphodiesterase is the rate-limiting step in regulating [cAMP]i in the oocyte. The results suggest that progesterone initiates the resumption of the meiotic divisions by down-regulation of membrane adenylate cyclase, possibly via Ca2+ release from specific membrane sites.", 
    "2": "The effects of the beta-receptor blockading agents, metoprolol and sotalol on neutrophil random motility, chemotaxis, post-phagocytic glycolysis, superoxide production, hexose monophosphate shunt activity, myeloperoxidase (MPO) mediated protein iodination and hydrogen peroxide production were assessed in vitro. The concentration range investigated was 10(-8)--10(-2) M for each drug. Both agents caused significant stimulation of neutrophil motility at concentrations of more than 10(-4) M. Increased migration was not associated with increased glycolysis or significant cyclic nucleotide fluctuations, but was inversely related to inhibition of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide generation and MPO mediated iodination with both drugs. In a further series of experiments to determine the relationship between the drug induced inhibition of H2O2 production and MPO mediated protein iodination to stimulation of motility it was found that concentrations of sotalol and metoprolol that caused these effects prevented HRP/H2O2/I- induced inactivation of the leucoattractant and inhibition of neutrophil chemotactic responsiveness. Neither drug inhibited the activity of MPO per se nor the reduction of ferricytochrome c by superoxide generated by the xanthine: xanthine oxidase system in vitro. It is suggested that enhanced neutrophil motility is not related to beta-receptor blockade but rather to restricting the availability of hydrogen peroxide and reactive products of the MPO/H2O2/halide system.", 
    "3": "1. Adrenaline in a concentration of 1.0 microM depressed the stimulation-induced efflux of tritium from the guinea-pig atria incubated with [3H]-noradrenaline, whereas adrenaline in a concentration of 0.5 nM significantly enhanced the stimulation-induced efflux of tritium. This enhancement was blocked by metoprolol (0.1 microM) and thus appears to be mediated by beta-adrenoceptors. 2. In guinea-pig atria incubated with unlabelled adrenaline and then with [3H]-noradrenaline, both catecholamines were released by field stimulation. In such atria metoprolol, practolol, oxprenolol or propranolol decreased the stimulation-induced efflux of tritium. These effects did not occur if the atria were incubated with unlabelled noradrenaline and then with [3H]-noradrenaline, suggesting that neuronally released adrenaline activates prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors. 3. The effect of oxprenolol in decreasing the release of tritium from guinea-pig atria, incubated with unlabelled adrenaline and then with [3H]-noradrenaline was greater in the presence of phentolamine. This may reflect the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking activity of oxprenolol.", 
    "4": "1 Guinea-pig gall bladder strips were contracted by (-)-noradrenaline, 10(-5) M, and by field stimulation at 5 Hz (in the absence or presence of 10(-6) M atropine) and relaxed to 10(-5) M (-)-isoprenaline. (-)-Adrenaline, 10(-5) M, predominantly contracted, but sometimes relaxed, this preparation. 2 In the presence of 10(-6) M phentolamine, contractions to (-)-noradrenaline and to (-)-adrenaline were reversed to relaxations. The relaxations produced by (-)-isoprenaline were unaltered. In the presence of 10(-6) M propranolol, contractions to (-)-noradrenaline increased in magnitude, relaxations to (-)-adrenaline were reversed to contractions, and relaxations to (-)-isoprenaline were abolished. These results demonstrate the presence of postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors which mediate contractions, and postsynaptic beta-adrenoceptors which initiate relaxations, in the guinea-pig gall bladder. 3 The contractile responses to continuous field stimulation for 5 min at 5 Hz in Krebs solution alone were reduced in magnitude by propranolol, 10(-6) M. In the presence of 10(-6) M atropine (added to eliminate the cholinergic component of the response), propranolol, 10(-6) M, had no effect on responses to stimulation at 5 Hz. Thus propranolol reduced the response to cholinergic stimulation in this tissue; the basis of this effect is unclear. In the absence or presence of atropine (10(-6) M), the responses to 5 Hz were smaller in magnitude in the presence than absence of phentolamine, 10(-6) M. This suggests that the responses to field stimulation of the guinea-pig gall bladder may, in part, be due to the release of endogenous noradrenaline which acts at postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "5": "1 Metoclopramide (2.8 to 280 microM) augmented contractions of rat vas deferens preparations induced by field stimulation (6 Hz for 1 s). This effect was antagonized by phentolamine (0.1 microM). Metoclopramide (2.8 to 280 microM) did not affect phenylephrine-induced contractions. 2 Metoclopramide (2.8 to 280 microM) antagonized the inhibitory effects of clonidine on the contractions induced by field stimulation, but not the inhibitory effects of purine nucleosides. 3 From these results it is concluded that metoclopramide (2.8 to 280 microM) is a presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist in the rat vas deferens. 4 Following beta-adrenoceptor blockade with (+/-)-propranolol (3.3 microM), (-)-isoprenaline (0.47 to 14 microM) inhibited responses to field stimulation but not to phenylephrine. These propranolol-resistant effects of isoprenaline were antagonized by metoclopramide (2.8 to 280 microM) and by phentolamine (0.1 to 10 microM), indicating that isoprenaline may stimulate presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors in this preparation.", 
    "6": "In experiments on mature female rats it was shown that L-DOPA administration restores normal ovulation in rats after the dorsal hippocampus destruction and related partial ovulation blockade. Pharmacological analysis after microinjections of alpha- and beta-adrenoblockers into the dorsal hippocampus region has shown that alpha- and beta-adrenoreception of the dorsal hippocampus plays a definite role in the regulation of gonadotropin secretion. However, the effect of phentolamine injection on the rat ovulatory reaction was less pronounced than under conditions of this hippocampus region destruction. The beta-adrenoblocker propranolol injected into the dorsal hippocampus inhibited compensatory hypertrophy of the ovaries in hemicastrated rats, decreased the hypophyseal FSH content and did not influence ovulation.", 
    "7": "Incubation of slices of rat cerebral cortical grey matter in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate-glucose buffer induced a rapid decline in the responsiveness of the adenylate cyclase in subsequently prepared membrane preparations to stimulation by various activators of the enzyme. The loss of responsiveness was time- and temperature-dependent, showed an absolute dependence on extracellular calcium ions, and was mimicked by the presence of serine proteases in the incubation medium. The resultant adenylate cyclase preparation was partially responsive to activation by fluoride and guanylylimidodiphosphate but had become virtually unresponsive to activation by ganglioside, trypsin, or beta-adrenergic agonists. The loss of responsiveness of adenylate cyclase was not altered if slices were incubated with depolarizing agents, putative neurotransmitters, receptor blockers, serine protease inhibitors, or adenosine deaminase. The nature of the calcium-dependent mechanism involved in the loss responsiveness of membranal adenylate cyclase is unknown. A suggested mechanism for the loss of sensitivity is the action of a membrane-bound, calcium-dependent protease.", 
    "8": "The influence of alpha receptor blockers on the facilitation of the chemoreflex by clonidine was examined in anesthetized dogs. Intravertebral arterial administration of clonidine reduced blood pressure, facilitated chemoreflex-induced vasoconstriction and inhibited carotid occlusion-induced vasoconstriction. Intravertebral arterial administration of phentolamine (0.01-0.03 mg/kg), yohimbine (0.01-0.02 mg/kg), or piperoxan (0.05 mg/kg) prevented the inhibition of carotid occlusion-induced responses by clonidine, and the latter two alpha blockers reduced the hypotensive effect. Facilitation of the chemoreflex by clonidine was decreased by yohimbine and piperoxan, but not affected by phentolamine. Intravertebral infusion of propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) had no influence on clonidine's effect on reflex responses, but appeared to accentuate its hypotensive effect. The results support a role for alpha receptor stimulation in clonidine-induced hypotension and inhibition of the carotid occlusion reflex and suggest participation of alpha receptors in the potentiation by clonidine of chemoreflex-induced vasoconstriction.", 
    "9": "Symptomatic arrhythmias often occur intermittently in patients with sinus node dysfunction. A diagnostic test with ability to reveal latent sinus disease has therefore been much sought for. Determinations of sinus node recovery time (SNRT) and corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT) have been attempted but limitations in their diagnostic power are well recognized. To eliminate a possible masking effect of autonomous neural tone, propranolol 0.1 mg/kg and atropine 0.02 mg/kg was administered to 30 patients with established symptomatic sinus bradydysrhythmias (SSBD) and to a control group of 18 age-matched healthy volunteers. In addition the same procedure was applied to 9 patients with symptoms suggesting SSBD in whom, however, this cause was later excluded. The upper normal limit of CSNRT defined by the control group was 545 msec before and 505 msec after drugs. In the SSBD group, CSNRT was falsely negative in 8 of the 30 patients. Repeated testing after drug inhibition reduced this number to 2 patients. Thus, the sensitivity increased from 73% to 93%. CSNRT determinations were normal in the non-SSBD patients, specificity remaining at 100%. Thus, the discriminative power of electrophysiologic testing for sinus node disease was found to be high when CSNRT determinations were performed both before and after drug inhibition of autonomous neural tone.", 
    "10": "The effects of N,N-diethyl-5-methyl[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-alpha]pyrimidine-7-amine (trapidil) on the electrical activities of canine right ventricular muscle were studied using standard microelectrode techniques. Trapidil (10(-4) and 10(-3) mol/l) increased the plateau amplitude and shortened the duration of the action potential without changing the resting membrane potential and the maximum rate of rise of the action potential. Trapidil (10(-3) mol/l) restored regenerative action potentials (the slow response) in the ventricular muscle depolarized by elevation of extracellular K+ concentrations to 30 mmol/l. The slow response induced by trapidil was not affected by pindolol (10(-7) mol/l) which abolished that elicited by isoprenaline (10(-6) mol/l). These results indicate that the action of trapidil on the cardiac cell membrane is to increase the slow inward current during the action potential independently of stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors. Taken together with the results obtained by previous investigations the present results suggest that the increase in slow inward current during the action potential would be responsible for the positive inotropic effect of trapidil and would probably be related to its inhibitory action on cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase.", 
    "11": "Thirty-nine patients with various types of hypertension were treated by chronic blockage of the angiotensin converting enzyme, i.e. by twice daily administration of captopril, 50 to 200 mg p.o. The blood pressure reduction observed 1 hour following administration of the inhibitor was directly related to the baseline plasma renin activity (r=- 0.67, p < 0.001). Whenever blockade of the renin system alone did not lower blood pressure to normal levels additional sodium subtraction brought it under control. With the renin system neutralized, blood pressure becomes exquisitely sensitive to changes in sodium balance. Diuretics seem to preserve optimal natriuretic efficacy despite blood pressure reduction, probably because aldosterone levels are reduced and renal blood flow increases. Blockade of the renin system together with individually tailored salt subtraction provides an attractive new approach to long-term treatment of clinical hypertension.", 
    "12": "Recent research has shown that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays a role in maintaining or causing high blood pressure in the majority of patients and it has demonstrated that renin-sodium profiling defines this involvement. Plasma renin activity measurements reveal the degree of renin-mediated vasoconstriction supporting the blood pressure, and the urinary sodium value indicates the appropriateness of the renin activity to the volume status. Together with determination of serum potassium levels, this test is basic for screening and for definitive diagnosis of the surgically curable forms of renovascular and adrenocortical hypertension. For the remaining majority of patients with other forms of hypertension, renin profiling, used in the context of the vaso-constriction-volume analytical model, helps to reveal the relative participation of vasoconstriction and volume factors and it thereby guides simpler, more specific, and more predictable treatments using either antirenin or antivolume agents. In particular, renin profiling allows the physician to select those patients who should first receive a beta-blocker or a newer anti-renin drug instead of a diuretic. The vasoconstriction-volume analysis also can provide useful baseline information about the pace, severity, and prognosis of the disease in individual patients. For medical practice the new approach enables treatment with one drug instead of two for major subgroups, and the likelihood of more specific physiologic corrections. More research within this framework promises even better treatments as we near final solutions.", 
    "13": "The effects of ischemic and beta-blocker on myocardial cyclic nucleotides (cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP) of dogs were studied. The concentration of cyclic AMP in both infarcted and noninfarcted area 60 min after the ligation of the proximal part of the left anterior descending coronary artery to significantly higher than in sham-operated control animals. The concentration of cyclic GMP in infarcted area is also significantly elevated compared with control 15 min after the ligation. The cAMP/cGMP (A/G) ratio in the infarcted group was also elevated at 60 min and returned to control level after 5 hr. When propranolol was given, the concentration of cyclic AMP of both infarcted and noninfarcted area remained at control level. In propranolol-treated animals, the concentration of cyclic GMP in both infarcted and noninfarcted area increased significantly compared with control at 15 min and 60 min. The A/G ratio was also decreased below control level after the administration of propranolol. These results suggest that the stability of the ischemic cardiac muscle was enhanced by the administration of beta-blockers.", 
    "14": "It has been suggested that the mechanism of action of the calcium blocker diltiazem (DZ) is via beta-receptor blockade. In order to test this hypothesis, the effects of DZ on the competitive binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) to myocardial beta-receptors were evaluated and compared to those of a known beta-receptor agonist. Preliminary validation studies indicate that binding sites for 3H-DHA exhibit stereospecificity for isoproterenol (IP) (l-IP>d-IP) and show greater affinity for l-epinephrine compared to l-norepinephrine. In order to test the binding capacity of DZ to beta-adrenergic receptors, binding-concentration relationships were constructed for 3H-DHA (3--60 nM) in the presence of no drugs, l-IP (10(-4) M), or DZ (2.2 x 10(-6) M). 3H-DHA binding was significantly inhibited over the entire concentration range by 1-IP but was unaffected by the other conditions. This study was repeated using two different concentrations of DZ (2.2 x 10(-5) and 2.2 x 10(-7) M) with a similar lack of inhibition of 3H-DHA binding. These data indicate that DZ does not bind to myocardial beta-receptors and, therefore, does not appear to act via a beta-receptor-blocking activity.", 
    "15": "A role of prostaglandins in renin regulation has been recognized in animals and man. Indomethacin, a blocker of prostaglandin synthesis, lowers plasma renin activity, renal prostaglandin synthesis and causes sodium retention in man. It is shown that the sodium retaining effect of indomethacin can be separated from its effect on plasma renin activity. A more precise definition of the mechanisms whereby prostaglandins influence renin release is given showing that the baroreceptor and the macula densa mechanisms of renin release are affected by prostaglandins. Investigations aiming at the indentification of the prostaglandin responsible for cylooxygenase--dependent renin regulator reveal that PGI2 is a prominent prostaglandin biosynthesized in the renal cortex and causes renin release in vivo and in vitro. A hypothesis is presented which postulates that prostaglandin dependent renin release is mediated by prostacyclin. Various antihypertensive drug effects can be antagonized by blockers of prostaglandin biosynthesis. Possible mechanisms of such drug interactions between propranolol, hydralazine and diuretics on the one hand and indomethacin and aspirin on the other hand are discussed.", 
    "16": "Quantitative electron microscopic studies on the mouse pineal gland were done to elucidate the mechanism of the response of the granulated vesicles in pinealocytes to acute cold exposure. An increase in the number of the granulated vesicles in the mouse pinealocytes occurs following administration of isoproterenol and this increase is prevented by pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol. In addition, a numerical increase of the granulated vesicles in response to acute cold exposure is abolished in mice pretreated with propranolol or in adrenalectomized animals. The results suggest that catecholamines released from the adrenal medulla, but not from sympathetic nerve endings, may cause the response of the granulated vesicles to cold by way of beta-receptors.", 
    "17": "The beta-adrenergic receptor of C6 glioma cells contains a disulfide bridge which can be reduced by dithiothreitol (DTT). On intact cells, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (5 mM) does not change the affinity of [3H] H2-alprenolol ([3H] DHA) but reduces the total number of beta-adrenergic cell receptors by 21 +/- 3 per cent ; (N = 3). After receptor reduction by DTT, NEM irreversibly blocks the accessibility of the beta-adrenergic receptors to [3H]DHA. On isolated membranes, incubation in the presence of either NEM (5 mM) or isoproterenol (5.10(-7) M) does not significantly modify the total number of beta-adrenergic receptors accessible to [3H]DHA. Incubation of membranes with both NEM and isoproterenol reduces the number of binding sites by 33 +/- 2 per cent ; (N = 3). A thiol derivative of propranolol was synthetized. Its affinity is 10 times lower than that of propranolol. This sulfur derivative reduces the total number of beta-adrenergic receptors by 22 +/- 3 per cent (N = 3) when incubated with the native receptor and by 55 +/- 4 per cent (N = 4) when incubated with the reduced receptor. DTT does not significantly reverse the blockade induced by propranolol-SH. A model is proposed for explaining these results.", 
    "18": "Human CSF cyclic nucleotides do not distinguish manic-depresive patients or schizophrenic patients from controls, although a \"high CSF cyclic AMP\" subgroup of poor-prognosis schizophrenics is still under investigation. Neuroleptic therapy raises CSF cyclic GMP and lowers CSF cyclic AMP, at least in the responder subgroup of a clinically heterogeneous patient population when neuroleptics that are good adenylate cyclase inhibitors in vitro are used in the treatment. This is consistent with the concept that neuroleptic treatment in humans involves blockade of dopamine neurotransmission. Attempts to correlate the decline in CSF cyclic AMP concentration with clinical improvement may be important. Lithium treatment does not alter the level of CSF cyclic AMP, which probably derives largely from dopamine-related neurotransmission that lithium does not affect. However, the plasma cyclic AMP response to epinephrine is inhibited by lithium at therapeutic doses in vivo after chronic treatment. The lithium effect is somewhat specific in that the glucagon-stimulated rise in plasma cyclic AMP is not affected. The results in clinical experiments support the theory that norepinephrine-sensitive adenylate cyclase inhibition in brain is involved in lithium action. Research to attempt to distinguish lithium-responsive from lithium nonresponsive patients on the basis of sensitivity to lithium inhibition of the epinephrine-induced rise in plasma cyclic AMP is of considerable potential practical importance.", 
    "19": "Adrenaline causes a dose-related increase in enzyme (lactate dehydrogenase) release from the isolated perfused working rat heart and a rise in tissue cAMP. Rates of both enzyme release and tissue cAMP fell with beta blockade by propranolol (plus pacing to maintain heart rate). Theophylline also increased enzyme release and tissue cAMP. Dibutyryl cAMP, but not butyric acid or external cAMP, increased enzyme release. Hence the release of enzyme is mediated by cAMP according to the criteria of Sutherland et al (11) for mediating the action of catecholamines. However, factors other than cAMP are operative because the extent of enzyme release and the tissue cAMP can be dissociated by variations in external calcium or magnesium or glucose, which modulate the effects of a given level of cAMP.", 
    "20": "The clinical trial of the new non-depolarizing muscle relaxant 2 beta,16 beta-bis-(4'-dimethyl-1'-piperazino)-3 alpha,17 beta diacetoxy-5 alpha-androstane dibromide (pipecurium bromide, RGH-1106, Arduan) was performed on 80 patients who had to undergo medium and major size intraabdominal operation on the basis of chronic surgical indication. Four types of general anaesthetic methods were applied, neuroleptanalgesia, halothane, halothane-fentanyl combination and hydroxydione. The clinical applicability of pipecurium bromide was tried to establish the dose needed for complete muscle relaxation initially and repeatedly and the effect of antagonist drugs on the muscle relaxation. We investigated the duration of the first and repeated dose of the relaxant. Heart rate and arterial blood pressure were measured, mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure were calculated. In 10 patients of the halothane group the behaviour of some haemodynamic parameters was investigated. The changes of acid base parameters, blood gases, serum electrolytes and blood sugar were also observed. The administered doses were initially 3.88 mg/h, repeated doses 2.32 mg/h, this means 0.052 mg/kg body weight initially and 0.026 mg/kg body weight repeatedly The duration of effect after the first dose was 53 min, after the repeated doses 45 min. There were no direct effects on heart rate and arterial blood pressure. It did not affect myocardial contractility or work function, there was no remarkable changes in cardiac output. There were no direct metabolic changes due to pipecurium bromide. The relaxant has no histamine releasing effect. At the end of the anaesthesia the effect can be antagonized with neostigmine. During our observations there were no side effects or allergic reactions caused by pipecurium bromide.", 
    "21": "In experiments on cats it has been shown that 2 beta, 16 beta-bis (4'-dimethyl-1'-piperazino)-3 alpha, 17 beta-diacetoxy-5 alpha-androstane dibromide (pipecurium bromide, RGH-1106, Arduan), is a non-depolarizing muscular blocker. The order of myorelaxation evoked by this agent is characteristic: first the chewing and limb muscles, then abdominal muscles and diaphragm and at the end intercostal muscles are relaxed. Pipercurium bromide has no cardiotropic, atropine-like, or ganglion-blocking activity. It fails to influence the coronary blood-supply or myocardial oxygen consumption. No acetylcholinesterase inhibiting action of the compound was seen. It does not affect the central nervous system.", 
    "22": "The post-training IP administration of naloxone (0.8 mg/kg) facilitates memory consolidation of the habituation of a rearing response to a tone in rats. Amphetamine (1.0 - 2.5 mg/kg or nicotine (0.2 - 0.5 mg/kg), and amphetamine (2.5 mg/kg) plus nicotine (0.5 mg/kg) have no effect. The higher doses of amphetamine or nicotine, however, when given together with a dose of naloxone which is ineffective alone (0.2 mg/kg), markedly enhance consolidation. Haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg), propranolol (0.5 mg/kg), and phenoxybenzamine (2.0 mg/kg) have no effect on their own; whereas tolazoline (2.0 mg/kg) impairs consolidation. The effect of naloxone (0.8 mg/kg) is antagonized by haloperidol and by propranolol, but not by phenoxybenzamine or tolazoline. The results suggest that naloxone causes memory facilitation through the release of central dopaminergic and beta-adrenergic mechanisms from a tonic inhibitory influence of endogenous opiate peptide systems.", 
    "23": "A procedure was developed to purify plasma membranes from cardiac tissue. Canine ventricular tissue was homogenized relatively gently in hypotonic buffer, extracted briefly with 0.15 M sodium perchlorate at 4 degrees C, and membranes were collected in an intermediate pellet by centrifugation at 27,500 X gmax. At this stage, most contractile proteins were removed (although Z-band structures were apparent), and the recoveries of Na+, K+-ATPase, beta-adrenoreceptors and 5'-nucleotidase were 40--50%. Treatment of these particles with 0.5% dextran sulfate and continuous density gradient centrifugation resulted in the separation of membranes having 111 and 3.6 pmol/mg protein specific binding sites for [3H] ouabain and [3H] dihydroalprenolol, respectively. Electron micrographs showed medium-sized vesicles. 5'-Nucleotidase was also markedly purified but could be partially separated from the other plasma membrane markers in continuous sucrose gradients. Enzymes associated with mitochondria, lysosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum were efficiently removed. SDS-polyacrylamide gels showed six major and many minor bands. Adenylate cyclase remained responsive to hormones and Gpp(NH)p, but little purification was apparent. The membrane preparation has proved useful for studies of a nucleotide-binding protein associated with cyclase activation.", 
    "24": "1. Rat isolated hearts perfused with delta 1-THC (0.5 micrograms/ml) showed a reduction in the rate of beating which was not altered by pretreatment with propranolol (2 micrograms/ml), atropine (4 micrograms/ml) or hexamethonium (4 micrograms/ml). 2. Propranolol (2 micrograms/ml) also caused a decrease in the rate of beating, which was not affected by pretreatment with delta 1-THC (0.5 micrograms/ml). 3. In pithed rats, propranolol (2 mg/kg, i.v.) caused a decrease in the pulse rate, which was not altered by prior administration of delta 1-THC (1mg/kg, i.v.). 4. In both preparations, the responses to isoprenaline were markedly reduced or abolished by propranolol, but they were unaffected by delta 1-THC. 5. It is concluded that the hypotensive and cardiac slowing actions of delta 1-THC are not mediated by activation of parasympathetic nerves or by beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "25": "A marked beta-adrenergic dilator interaction with the vasoconstrictor response in skeletal muscle during hemorrhage is described. The dilator influence corresponded to some 40% of the constrictor response both at mild and moderate as well as at large bleeding. In absolute resistance units, the beta-adrenergic dilator influence averaged no less than 14 mmHg/ml X min-1 X 100 g-1) at large bleeding (hemorrhagic hypotension of 50 mmHg). Comparison of the hemorrhage induced resistance effects in the autoperfused innervated muscle, in the autoperfused denervated muscle, and in the innervated muscle cross-circulated from a donor animal, showed that the beta-adrenergic dilator influence more or less completely was caused by blood-borne catecholamines, in all likelihood by adrenaline, which is known to be secreted in large amounts during hemorrhage. The described beta-adrenergic dilator mechanism may serve to maintain nutritional blood flow by counteracting the constrictor response. It deserves consideration also from the point of view that it obviously has to be taken into account for proper evaluation of other vascular control mechanisms brought into action in hemorrhage.", 
    "26": "Pentobarbital-anesthetized and spontaneously breathing, bovine albumin (BA)-sensitized adult domestic fowl showed acute systemic anaphylaxis to IV injection of antigen (BA), which was characterized by arterial hypotension, central venous hypertension, and bradycardia. Large doses of pyrilamine maleate (/1-receptor antagonist) partially inhibited acute systemic anaphylaxis. On the other hand, metiamide (a specific H2-antagonist) and propranolol (beta-adrenergic antagonist) markedly enhanced the anaphylactic response. Terbutaline (beta 2-agonist), dimaprit (a highly selective H2-agonist), and compound FPL 55712 (a slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis receptor antagonist) either significantly inhibited or reversed the anaphylactic response. Cimetidine (a newer H2-antagonist) enhanced only central venous pressor response to BA. This investigation appears to suggest a minor role of histamine and a major role of slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis as chemical mediatiors of anaphylaxis. A protective role of beta 2-adrenergic and H2-histaminergic receptors seem to operate in immediate hypersensitivity reactions in adult domestic fowl.", 
    "27": "The question of whether the chronic administration of propranolol modifies the numbers or properties of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors was examined because of many reports suggestive of cardiac hypersensitivity following the withdrawal of beta-antagonists. In three studies, rats were given (+/-)-propranolol, 30 mg/day, orally or intraperitoneally, for 1 to 7 weeks. The numbers and affinities of specific binding sites for radioactive dihydroalprenolol in whole hearts from 60 control and 75 test animals were found to be the same. Thus catecholamine deprivation does not exert an important regulatory effect on most beta-receptors in the heart, as it does in the brain.", 
    "28": "1 A binding assay involving (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) and KCl-washed cardiac membranes were used to assess the numbers and affinities of beta-adrenoceptors in hearts from male and female rats varying in age from about 2 weeks to 18 months. 2 Although female rats grow more slowly and attain lower adult weights than male rats, heart weights increased in approximate proportion to body weight with little sex difference. 3 As heart weight increased about three fold, beta-receptors increased three fold. Since the number of myocardial cells is believed to be nearly constant during postnatal growth, the numbers of receptors/cell presumably increases similarly. 4 As heart weight increased, the number of beta-receptors per g of tissue decreased according to the equation: total pmol/g = 4.33 - 1.43 x heart weight, equally in males and females. 5 Dissociation constants for DHA (2 to 4 nM) remained the same, and equal, in male and female rats during their growth. 6 An excellent correlation was found between the decline in beta-receptors/g tissue during growth and the decline in the area of the external sarcolemma/g tissue. The data suggest that the number of receptors per unit area remains constant during growth, and thus that cell surface area is a major factor determining normal numbers of receptors per cardiocyte.", 
    "29": "1 An improved binding assay involving (-)-[(3)H]-dihydroalprenolol (DHA) and KCl-washed cardiac membranes was developed to study beta-adrenoceptors in the canine heart quantitatively.2 Receptor numbers varied from 3.8 to 7.1 pmol/g fresh tissue, showing a steady increase from left atrium --> right atrium --> right ventricle --> interventricular septum --> left ventricle. With one minor exception, the same pattern was found for adenylate cyclase activity and Na(+), K(+)-activated ATPase activity.3 The binding of DHA was inhibited in the expected manner by beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists, and was stereospecific, in confirmation of previous studies. Dissociation constants determined from Scatchard analyses included DHA: 2.5 nM; (-)adrenaline: 230 nM; (-)noradrenaline: 1167 nM. Kinetic analyses of the binding of DHA yielded a K(D) of about 4 nM.4 The distribution of beta-receptors is closely related to that of blood flow and the arrival plus retention of a circulating catecholamine, but is markedly different from that of endogenous noradrenaline, and thus adrenergic nerve terminals. Most receptors thus appear not at synapses but diffusely localized where they can react with circulating adrenaline.5 Evidence is discussed that beta-receptors at synapses respond primarily to neural noradrenaline, less to circulating adrenaline, and hardly at all to circulating noradrenaline; responses mediate increased cardiac output during exercise. In contrast most cardiac beta-receptors appear to respond only to adrenaline, and to be used, except at times of severe circulatory stress, during psychological stress.", 
    "30": "Norepinephrine, isoproterenol, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline, caused relaxation of in vitro dog detrusor strips associated with significant increases in detrusor cyclic AMP content. Bethanechol-induced detrusor contractions and alpha-adrenergic detrusor contractile responses to norepinephrine after propranolol were not associated with changes in cyclic AMP. Cyclic nucleotide metabolic pathways exist in detrusor muscle and offer another investigative approach to bladder dysfunction.", 
    "31": "Chronic beta adrenergic blockade was induced in eight dogs with 240 to 360 mg of oral propranolol dailty for 2 to 6 weeks. Beta blockade was confirmed by a minimal heart rate response to isoproterenol, 0.06 micrograms/kg/min, in a pentobarbital-anesthetized, open-chest preparation. Subsequent to confirmation of beta blockade, hemodynamic effects of isoproterenol and dopamine were examined individually and in combination. A desirable balance of arterial pressure and cardiac output was achieved by combining isoproterenol, 0.2 to 2.0 micrograms/kg/min, with dopamine, 5 to 20 micrograms/kg/min. This combination increased mean arterial pressure (109 +/- 9 versus 81 +/- 7), cardiac output (4.3 +/- .5 versus 2.8 +/- .3 L/min) and heart rate 156 +/- 4 versus 120 +/- 7) (p less than 0.05). The hemodynamic effects of combined isoproterenol-dopamine were superior to the effects of either drug alone and suggest a method for effective circulatory support of man during chronic beta adrenergic blockade.", 
    "32": "To further evaluate the potential utility of lymphocyte beta adrenergic receptor assays in the study of receptor alterations in human disease, we studied highly purified populations of B and T lymphocytes in peripheral blood to see if differences existed in the concentration or affinity of beta adrenergic receptors and catecholamine-responsive cAMP levels. The mean number of receptors present in particulate fractions of B cells did not differ significantly from the number found in T cells. Similarly, no significant difference in the dissociation constant for (-)[3H]dihydroalprenolol was found. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in whole lymphocytes as measured by radioimmunoassay was comparable, although a tendency toward lower basal and stimulated levels in the T cells was evident. The data suggest that differences observed in concentrations of beta adrenergic receptors or catecholamine-responsive cAMP accumulation in lymphocytes from patients with varying illnesses are not likely to be due to differences in the proportions of circulating B and T lymphocytes.", 
    "33": "Beta-Adrnergic receptor and beta-adrenergic sensitive adenylate cyclase were demonstrated in membrane fractions of human placenta. Placental membranes from normal term pregnancies bound the beta-adrenergic antagonist (-)[3H]dihydroalprenolol to a single saturable class of sites (Kd = 2.31 +/- 0.23 nM; n = 9; maximal capacity, 112 +/- 9 fmol/mg). Competition for binding was stereoselective for (-)isomers of propranolol, and beta-adrenergic agonists displayed competition for the placental receptor in the order (-)isoproterenol greater than (-)epinephrine greater than (-)norepinephrine, typical of a beta 2 type receptor. Beta-Adrenergic receptor was present in placental tissue as early as 10 weeks gestational age, and binding capacity decreased slightly with advancing gestation. [3H]Dihydroalprenolol binding was coupled to epinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity throughout gestation. The subcellular distribution of both beta-adrenergic receptors and epinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase suggest their localization primarily in nonbrush border membrane fractions, presumably from plasma membranes more closely related to the fetal rather than to the maternal circulation. Epinephrine-sensitive adenylate cyclase was not present in purified brush border preparations which were directly exposed to maternal blood in the intervillous space.", 
    "34": "To investigate the possible effects of newly synthesized beta-adrenergic blockers on plasma renin activity, an assay was developed using unanesthetized mice and radioimmunoassay. Renin activity was significantly increased by the administration of hydralazine (1 mg/kg, i.p.), furosemide (20 mg/kg, i.v.), and isoproterenol (0.1 mg/kg, s.c.). Unlike isoproterenol, norepinephrine (1 mg/kg, s.c.) and epinephrine (1 mg/kg, s.c.) were active but considerably less effective stimulants. The increase caused by isoproterenol was blocked by clonidine, pindolol, bunolol, atenolol, and l-propranolol, but not d-propranolol. The beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity such as pindolol were found to increase renin activity when given alone, but blocked an increase in renin activity when given prior to isoproterenol. In general, nonselective beta-blocking drugs possessing both beta 1- and beta 2-(vascular) blocking activity were found to be most effective in blocking plasma renin activity on oral administration.", 
    "35": "A six-year-old girl with syncope in association with atrial flutter-fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia produced by exercise or emotion is presented. The tachycardias could be reproduced by low-dose isoproterenol infusion and were blocked by high dose propranolol therapy. Catecholamine-induced tachyarrhythmias should be suspected in children with unexplained syncope in association with exercise or emotion.", 
    "36": "An elevation of the intracellular cAMP concentration in C6 cells by cholera toxin or the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine causes a densitization of the beta-adrenergic-receptor-dependent synthesis of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. The specific binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to the beta-adrenergic receptors and the activation of the adenylate cyclase in vitro by fluoride anions and guanyl imidotriphosphate remain unchanged. It is likely that the desensitization is caused by an inhibition of beta-receptor coupling to the GTP-binding coupling protein in the adenylate cyclase complex. Furthermore, these experiments provide evidence that the loss of beta-receptor binding observed after incubation of cells with catecholamines is not a necessary consequence of the densensitization of receptor coupling dependent on adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate.", 
    "37": "The effects of minoxidil used in combination with propranolol were assessed in the management of moderate hypertension. All patients had diastolic blood pressures above 95 mm Hg after therapy with thiazide diuretics for 2 weeks and were randomly assigned to treatment schedules which added minoxidil and propranolol in dosage ratios of 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8. Diastolic pressures were reduced to less than 90 mm Hg by upward titration of minoxidil dosage, minoxidil was discontinued; 2 weeks later propranolol was also withdrawn. A diastolic pressure less than 90 mm Hg was achieved with 5 mg of minoxidil in 50% of the patients. While vasodilator-induced tachycardia was blocked at all minoxidil/propranolol ratio, the 1:8 ratio group demonstrated the greatest percentage reduction in systolic and diastolic pressures at the end of the first week. We conclude that rapid control of moderate hypertension can be achieved by modest doses of minoxidil and with the production of only minor side effects, a minoxidil/propranolol ratio of 1:8 being adequate to prevent tachycardia.", 
    "38": "Since minoxidil was previously shown to raise plasma renin activity (PRA) but not the plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), the effect of minoxidil on the rate of aldosterone metabolic clearance was studied. After the addition of minoxidil to the antihypertensive regimen of 7 hypertensive patients, the aldosterone metabolic clearance rate increased from 1,110 +/- 91 to 1,570 +/- 180 liters/day (p less than 0.01), an overall increase of 41%. Hepatic blood flow, estimated from the clearance from plasma of indocyanine green, was increased in a group of minoxidil-treated patients compared to a comparable group not treated with minoxidil (p less than 0.01). Thus, although minoxidil induces an increase in PRA, PAC does not change, since aldosterone metabolic clearance increases. Minoxidil increased hepatic blood flow, and it was probably by this mechanism that the drug accelerated the rate of aldosterone clearance.", 
    "39": "The effects of minoxidil on the electrocardiogram (EKG) were assessed in a prospective investigation of 112 patients with severe hypertension during an observation period representing 241.5 patient-years. Highly significant blood pressure reductions at rest and during exercise were achieved and maintained with the combination of minoxidil, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and diuretics. In 90% of the patients, the initiation of minoxidil was associated with nonspecific T-wave changes in the EKG consisting of flattening or inversion, which ranged from slight to very marked. While these changes may initially appear disconcerting, the observations of this study show that they are not related to changes in heart rate or other clinical criteria associated with myocardial ischemia. The changes remain unaltered during the tachycardia of exercise, they are not influenced by beta-adrenergic blockage, and they generally revert to their control appearance during chronic treatment. During long-term treatment, a substantial reduction of the increased QRS voltages occurred.", 
    "40": "Five patients presenting with severe hypertension who failed to exhibit diastolic blood pressures less than 120 mm Hg following the oral administration of propranolol (60--80 mg) and furosemide (40 mg) received minoxidil (20 mg, p.o.). Systemic blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output were measured prior to and hourly following the addition of minoxidil to the regimen of propranolol and furosemide. One hour following the addition of minoxidil, systemic blood pressure decreased from 204/126 to 186/114 mm Hg (mean systolic/mean diastolic blood pressure). Four hours after minoxidil administration, systemic blood pressure was 175/105 mm Hg. Four of the 5 subjects exhibited diastolic blood pressures greater than 100 mm Hg at 4 hr and were given a booster dose of minoxidil (5--20 mg). Systemic blood pressure subsequently decreased to 153/92 mm Hg at 8 hr and to 142/86 mm Hg at 12 hr following the initial dose of minoxidil. The reduction of systemic blood pressure was achieved without significant change in heart rate or cardiac output. These data indicate that stepped-care therapy utilizing a diuretic, a beta-blocking agent, and minoxidil produces prompt, significant, and sustained reduction of systemic blood pressure in patients with severe, potentially life-threatening hypertension.", 
    "41": "Renal function was monitored in 20 previously refractory hypertensive patients treated for 2--7 years with minoxidil, sympathetic suppressants, and diuretics. Serum creatinine concentration increased by more than 1 mg/dl in 9 of the 20 patients. In 4 of the 9 patients, renal disease progressed to require hemodialysis. Eleven patients had no progression of renal disease (creatinine increased less than or equal to 1 mg/dl). Three of the 11 had had malignant hypertension with renal failure which was reversed during this triple therapy. Neither the quality of blood pressure control nor the duration of minoxidil therapy correlated with increases in serum creatinine concentration. Plasma norepinephrine levels were higher (p less than 0.01) and plasma renin activity lower (p less than 0.02) in the group with progression of renal disease. Serum creatinine at the time when neuroendocrine studies were done correlated with PNE (r = 0.51, p less than 0.05). Addition of clonidine to this triple regimen in 2 patients with advanced renal disease lowered plasma norepinephrine by 63 and 81%. These findings suggest that the high norepinephrine levels are due to excess release of norepinephrine rather than defective renal elimination of this catecholamine. Whether the elevated plasma norepinephrine contributes to or is a result of the underlying disease is not known.", 
    "42": "Twenty patients with hypertension refractory to conventional therapy were treated with minoxidil in combination with a diuretic and a beta-blocker. The mean supine initial blood pressure was 207/128 mm Hg, and the end-treatment pressure was 155/89 mm Hg. Five of the 7 patients with essential hypertension were adequately controlled, as were 8 of the 9 patients with renal failure and all 4 patients with renovascular hypertension. Thus, the overall controll rate was 85%. The duration of treatment ranged from 1 to 30 months, and the minoxidil dosage ranged from 5 to 60 mg/dry electrocardiographic changes characterized by T-wave inversion after starting minoxidil. These changes were reversible in 4 patients. Minoxidil was found to be an effective antihypertensive drug in these patients with refractory hypertension.", 
    "43": "Clonidine has clearly been shown to be effective in the treatment of all grades of hypertension. Clonidine by itself, when compared with placebo, has proved its worth in the treatment of essential hypertension; it has also been found to be more effective than diuretic treatment alone. When clonidine and a diuretic have been combined, the combination has proved superior to either clonidine or the diuretic given alone. The combination of clonidine with a diuretic is equal in efficacy to combinations of a diuretic with a beta-blocker, alpha-methyldopa, or prazosin. Combinations of a diuretic, a vasodilator, and clonidine were useful in patients with refractory hypertension that failed to respond to a two-drug regimen. Clonidine has also been shown to be effective in patients with renal failure or in hypertensive crisis.", 
    "44": "Histamine (1--2 x 10(-5) M) induced or enhanced oscillatory activity in four of five sheep Purkinje fibers depolarized by a low-potassium medium. These effects of histamine were readily antagonized by 2 x 10(-5) M burimamide but were unaffected by 10(-5) M practolol. Oscillatory activity was consistently induced or enhanced by 5 x 10(-6) M adrenaline in five preparations. Oscillatory activity, whether induced by histamine or adrenaline, was always abolished by verapamil (0.22--2.2 x 10(-6 M) but in only one of five experiments by lidocaine (4.2 x 10(-5) M). We conclude that induction of oscillatory responses may be added to the other arrhythmogenic mechanisms produced by histamine through the stimulation of H2 receptors. We confirmed that oscillatory activity is very effectively suppressed by verapamil.", 
    "45": "Inotropic and electrophysiologic effects in dogs of a single dose of digitoxin with and without autonomic blockade with propranolol plus atropine were observed for 8 hr. Left heart catheterization and His bundle registration were performed in 14 Labrador dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital. Pacing and programmed electrical stimulation were used to determine heart rate-independent changes in dP/dt, intra-atrial, AV nodal, His-Purkinje, and intraventricular conduction velocity. The effective and the functional refractory periods of the atrium, and the functional nodal refractory period (AV-FRP) were measured. Six dogs were given propranolol 0.5 mg/kg plus atropine 0.05 mg/kg every hour. After determination of inotropic and electrophysiologic parameters, digitoxin (2.0 mg) was given to 5 of the dogs, while 1 dog served as control. The other 8 dogs were given only digitoxin (2.0 mg). The dP/dt increased after digitoxin in both groups with maximum values after 2 hr. The autonomic nervous system had only minor influence on changes in contractility caused by digitoxin. The marked fall in heart rate and increase in A-H time (i.e., AV nodal conduction time) and AV-FRP after digitoxin were almost completely blocked by atropine and propranolol. Minor increases in A-H time and AV-FRP indicated a slight direct effect of digitoxin on the AV node.", 
    "46": "We studied 11 previously refractory hypertensive subjects who were treated with minoxidil, propranolol, and diuretics for 2--7 years. During this time 70 random blood samples were collected in the supine position and analyzed for plasma norepinephrine (PNE) and plasma renin activity (PRA). The mean PNE was 546 pg/ml (normal mean +/- SE, 173 +/- 10) and was reciprocally related to log PRA. To determine if this elevated PNE would respond to clonidine, 5 of the patients were admitted to the General Clinical Research Center for administration of placebo and later of clonidine (0.1 or 0.2 mg). A single dose of clonidine suppressed PNE (p less than 0.01) and lowered mean blood pressure (p less than 0.02) for 12 hr. The PRA was not altered significantly by clonidine. Thus, high PNE in these treated patients can be suppressed by clonidine, and this suppression of PNE and blood pressure occurs without alteration of PRA.", 
    "47": "Effects of bradykinin on SA node pacemaker activity and atrial contractility were studied, using isolated, blood-perfused dog atrium preparations. Bradykinin (0.1--100 micrograms) caused a slightly but consistently positive chronotropic action, although it did not produce a consistent inotropic action. When successive doses of bradykinin were given in a short period, these preparations displayed tachphylaxis. Bradykinin-induced action was not suppressed by a potent beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, carteolol. In addition, kallikrein (0.1--3 units), was administered into the sinus node artery to investigate the effect of endogenous kinins. Kallikrein had no effect on SA node pacemaker activity nor atrial contractility at any examined doses. On the other hand, a kallikrein inhibitor, aprotinin, induced dose-relatedly a negative inotropic and chronotropic effect at a dose range from 100 to 3,000 units. These negative actions of aprotinin were not blocked by an adequate dose of atropine. From these results, it is concluded that bradykinin has a slight direct positive chronotropic effect, and that aprotinin has direct negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in the isolated, blood-perfused canine atrium in a wide dose range.", 
    "48": "Histidine decarboxylase activity and histamine levels of peritoneal mast cells were enhanced 4 days after intraperitoneal Haemophilus influenzae vaccination of rats. Incubation of the cells with propranolol (3.4 x 10(-4) M) resulted in histamine release and an increased histidine decarboxylase activity. Histidine decarboxylase activity and histamine release were more increased in the presence of propranolol in mast cells obtained from H. influenzae-vaccinated rats. An increased mediator release is also suggested by the increase of the number of peritoneal eosinophils. These data might explain the earlier observed enhanced plasma and lung histamine levels in H. influenzae-vaccinated rats.", 
    "49": "Changes in arterial blood pressure were compared in young male SHR rats untreated or treated orally with a beta-blocker for 5 days out of 7 from the 5th to 9th week of life. Propranolol, acebutolol and practolol, at a daily dose of 50 mg/kg, prevented the occurrence of hypertension, not only during the 4 weeks of treatment, but also during 6,9 and 11 weeks respectively after cessation of treatment. Alprenolol and metoprolol (50 mg/kg/day) and atenolol (100 mg/kg/day) proved to be active only during the period of treatment, whereas oxprenolol (100 mg/kg/day) was totally inactive. Propranolol and acebutolol were, however, inactive under identical conditions with SHR of the same strain but bred in another laboratory. The physiological difference between the two groups of SHR was confirmed by the fact that the resistance of their erythrocytes to osmotic shock was different. This suggests that all the beta-blockers do not necessarily have the same preventive activity with respect to hypertension in the SHR and that two groups of SHR bred in two different places can be physiologically dissimilar even though they originate from the same strain.", 
    "50": "Two new beta-adrenergic blocking agents, timolol and MK-761, were found to effectively antagonize the positive inotropic effects of isoproterenol on isolated cat papillary muscles without depressing contractile force. However, appropriate doses of these beta-adrenergic blockers (ie, 12.5--25 microgram/kg) did not significantly prolong survival in hemorrhagic shock in anesthetized cats. MK-761 prevented some of the plasma accumulations of myocardial depressant factor (MDF) during shock. Nevertheless both beta-blockers failed to prevent the accumulation of the lysosomal protease cathepsin D or peptide fragments (ie, amino-nitrogen groups) in the blood during shock. We conclude that neither agent is of significant benefit in severe hemorrhagic shock, and probably beta-adrenergic blockade is not a productive approach to pursue in the therapeutics of hemorrhagic shock.", 
    "51": "Fifteen healthy male subjects, aged 18-19 years, with primary T wave aberrations consisting mainly of notches in the T wave without concomitant ST depression (group T) were compared to twenty-six controls of the same age with normal electrocardiograms. The T wave aberrations were eliminated by beta-adrenergic blockade in thirteen subjects in group T. Physical exercise decreased all the T wave aberrations. Group T was on average shorter and had signs of higher sympathetic tone, as shown by a higher heart rate and systolic blood pressure, than the controls and the parasympathetic tone was lower, as indicated by a higher heart rate during beta-adrenergic blockade. No significant differences in physical work capacity and heart volumes were found. Measurement of systolic time intervals suggested increased sympathetic influence on the heart and no signs of cardiac impairment. Thus the majority of subjects with aberrant T waves had changes in the autonomic tone and no signs of functional impairment of the heart.", 
    "52": "Two adrenergic receptor antagonists, acebutolol and propranolol, were observed to depress rabbit heart contractile force and adrenaline-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity at 1 X 10-(5) to 1 X 10-(3) M and 1 X 10-(6) to 1 X 10-(3) M concentrations, respectively. Acebutolol depressed sarcoplasmic reticular and mitochondrial calcium uptake at 5 X 10-(3) to 10-(2) M concentrations. On the other hand, propranolol was found to decrease calcium uptake activities of sarcoplasmic reticular and mitochondrial fractions at 1 X 10-(4) to 1 X 10-(2) M and 1 X 10-(3) to 1 X 10-(2) M concentrations, respectively. On the basis of these results with calcium transport systems, it is proposed that beta-antagonists with a mild depressant effect, such as acebutolol, may be called beta-moderators, whereas those with a strong effect, such as propranolol, may be called beta-blockers."
