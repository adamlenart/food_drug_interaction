In this study, human myocardial tissue was used to examine the state of PKA subunits. As expected, total myosin binding protein-C phosphorylation and Ser23/24 troponin I phosphorylation significantly decreased in HF. Examination of PKA subunits demonstrated no change in type II regulatory (RII\u03b1) or catalytic (C\u03b1) subunit expression, although site specific RII\u03b1 (Ser96) and C\u03b1 (Thr197) phosphorylation were increased in HF. Further, the expression of type I regulatory subunit (RI) was increased in HF. Isoelectric focusing of RI\u03b1 demonstrated up to three variants, consistent with reports that Ser77 and Ser83 are in vivo phosphorylation sites. Western blots with site-specific monoclonal antibodies showed increased Ser83 phosphorylation in HF. 8-fluo-cAMP binding by wild type and phosphomimic Ser77 and Ser83 mutant RI\u03b1 proteins demonstrated reduced Kd for the double mutant as compared to WT RI\u03b1. Therefore, failing myocardium displays altered expression and post-translational modification of PKA subunits that may impact downstream signaling.",

Male prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) spontaneously exhibit high levels of alloparental care, even in the absence of reproductive experience. In previous studies, exposure to a pup was selectively associated with increased activity in oxytocin and vasopressin neurons along with decreased plasma corticosterone. In the present study, physiological, pharmacological and neuroanatomical methods were used to explore the autonomic and behavioral consequences of exposing male prairie voles to a pup. Reproductively na\u00efve, adult male prairie voles were implanted with radiotransmitters used for recording ECG, temperature and activity. Males responded with a sustained increase in heart-rate during pup exposure. This prolonged increase in heart rate was not explained by novelty, locomotion or thermoregulation. Although heart rate was elevated during pup exposure, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) did not differ between these males and males exposed to control stimuli indicating that vagal inhibition of the heart was maintained. Blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors with atenolol abolished the pup-induced heart rate increase, implicating sympathetic activity in the pup-induced increase in heart rate. Blockade of vagal input to the heart delayed the males' approach to the pup. Increased activity in brainstem autonomic regulatory nuclei was also observed in males exposed to pups. Together, these findings suggest that exposure to a pup activates both vagal and sympathetic systems. This unique physiological state (i.e. increased sympathetic excitation of the heart, while maintaining some vagal cardiac tone) associated with male caregiving behavior may allow males to both nurture and protect infants.",

    "16": "Heart rate reflects autonomic nervous system activity. Numerous studies have demonstrated that an increased heart rate at rest is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as an independent risk factor. It has been shown a link between cardiac autonomic balance and inflammation. Thus, an elevated heart rate produces a micro-inflammatory response and is involved in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction. In turn, decrease in heart rate produces benefits in congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, obesity, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis. Alteration of other heart rate-related parameters, such as their variability and recovery after exercise, is associated with risk of cardiovascular events. Drugs reducing the heart rate (beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and inhibitors of If channels) have the potential to reduce cardiovascular events. Although not recommended in healthy subjects, interventions for reducing heart rate constitute a reasonable therapeutic goal in certain pathologies.",

    "22": "Catecholamine release is known to modulate cardiac output by increasing heart rate. Although much is known about catecholamine function and regulation in adults, little is known about the presence and role of catecholamines during heart development. The present study aimed therefore to evaluate the effects of different catecholamines on early heart development in an in vitro setting using embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Effects of catecholamine depletion induced by reserpine were examined in murine ES cells (line D3, \u03b1PIG44) during differentiation. Cardiac differentiation was assessed by immunocytochemistry, qRT-PCR, quantification of beating clusters, flow cytometry and pharmacological approaches. Proliferation was analyzed by EB cross-section measurements, while functionality of cardiomyocytes was studied by extracellular field potential (FP) measurements using microelectrode arrays (MEAs). To further differentiate between substance-specific effects of reserpine and catecholamine action via \u03b1- and \u03b2-receptors we proved the involvement of adrenergic receptors by application of unspecific \u03b1- and \u03b2-receptor antagonists. Reserpine treatment led to remarkable down-regulation of cardiac-specific genes, proteins and mesodermal marker genes. In more detail, the average ratio of \u223c40% spontaneously beating control clusters was significantly reduced by 100%, 91.1% and 20.0% on days 10, 12, and 14, respectively. Flow cytometry revealed a significant reduction (by 71.6%, n\u200a=\u200a11) of eGFP positive CMs after reserpine treatment. By contrast, reserpine did not reduce EB growth while number of neuronal cells in reserpine-treated EBs was significantly increased. MEA measurements of reserpine-treated EBs showed lower FP frequencies and weak responsiveness to adrenergic and muscarinic stimulation. Interestingly we found that developmental inhibition after \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic blocker application mimicked developmental changes with reserpine. Using several methodological approaches our data suggest that reserpine inhibits cardiac differentiation. Thus catecholamines play a critical role during development.",

Preconditioning counteracted this decrease by 91%. Preconditioning reduced hypoxia-induced necrosis by 40%, attenuated lowering of proteins of mitochondrial complexes I-IV and enhanced stimulation of HIF-1-alpha and phosphorylated AMPK proteins. Preconditioning by diazoxide was abolished by co-exposure to tolbutamide or elevated potassium (i.e. conditions which increase Ca(2+) inflow). Preconditioning with nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, partly reproduced effects of diazoxide. Both diazoxide and nifedipine moderately reduced basal glucose oxidation whereas glucose-induced oxygen consumption (tested with diazoxide) was unaffected. Preconditioning with diaxoxide enhanced insulin contents in transplants of rat islets to non-diabetic rats and lowered hyperglycemia vs. non-preconditioned islets in streptozotocin-diabetic rats.

    "31": "We reported that iron influx drives the translational expression of the neuronal amyloid precursor protein (APP), which has a role in iron efflux. This is via a classic release of repressor interaction of APP mRNA with iron-regulatory protein-1 (IRP1) whereas IRP2 controls the mRNAs encoding the L- and H-subunits of the iron storage protein, ferritin. Here, we identified thirteen potent APP translation blockers that acted selectively towards the uniquely configured iron-responsive element (IRE) RNA stem loop in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of APP mRNA. These agents were 10-fold less inhibitory of 5'UTR sequences of the related prion protein (PrP) mRNA. Western blotting confirmed that the 'ninth' small molecule in the series selectively reduced neural APP production in SH-SY5Y cells at picomolar concentrations without affecting viability or the expression of \u03b1-synuclein and ferritin. APP blocker-9 (JTR-009), a benzimidazole, reduced the production of toxic A\u03b2 in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells to a greater extent than other well tolerated APP 5'UTR-directed translation blockers, including posiphen, that were shown to limit amyloid burden in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). RNA binding assays demonstrated that JTR-009 operated by preventing IRP1 from binding to the IRE in APP mRNA, while maintaining IRP1 interaction with the H-ferritin IRE RNA stem loop. Thus, JTR-009 constitutively repressed translation driven by APP 5'UTR sequences. Calcein staining showed that JTR-009 did not indirectly change iron uptake in neuronal cells suggesting a direct interaction with the APP 5'UTR. These studies provide key data to develop small molecules that selectively reduce neural APP and A\u03b2 production at 10-fold lower concentrations than related previously characterized translation blockers. Our data evidenced a novel therapeutic strategy of potential impact for people with trisomy of the APP gene on chromosome 21, which is a phenotype long associated with Down syndrome (DS) that can also cause familial Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "32": "QT variability (QTV) signifies repolarization lability, and increased QTV is a risk predictor for sudden cardiac death. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of autonomic nervous system activity on QTV. This study was performed in 29 subjects: 10 heart failure (HF) patients with spontaneous ventricular tachycardia [HFVT(+)], 10 HF patients without spontaneous VT [HFVT(-)], and 9 subjects with structurally normal hearts (HNorm). The beat-to-beat QT interval was measured on 3-min records of surface ECGs at baseline and during interventions (atrial pacing and esmolol, isoprenaline, and atropine infusion). Variability in QT intervals was expressed as the SD of all QT intervals (SDQT). The ratio of the SDQT to SD of RR intervals (SDRR) was calculated as an index of QTV normalized to heart rate variability. There was a trend toward a higher baseline SDQT-to-SDRR ratio in the HFVT(+) group compared with the HFVT(-) and HNorm groups (P = 0.09). SDQT increased significantly in the HFVT(+) and HFVT(-) groups compared with the HNorm group during fixed-rate atrial pacing (P = 0.008). Compared with baseline, isoprenaline infusion increased SDQT in HNorm subjects (P = 0.02) but not in HF patients. SDQT remained elevated in the HFVT(+) group relative to the HNorm group despite acute \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockade with esmolol (P = 0.02). In conclusion, patients with HF and spontaneous VT have larger fluctuations in beat-to-beat QT intervals. This appears to be a genuine effect that is not solely a consequence of heart rate variation. The effect of acute autonomic nervous system modulation on QTV appears to be limited in HF patients.",

Current protocols recommend overnight admission for initiation of propranolol as well as baseline investigations including electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography (ECHO).

We evaluated 20 consecutive patients commencing propranolol as a day case for the treatment of an infantile haemangioma over an 18-month period. Investigations were carried out according to our local protocol. Cardiac investigations were not routinely performed. Patients were observed for 2\u00a0h following administration of the first dose of propranolol (0.5\u00a0mg/kg orally). If no adverse effects were observed, patients were discharged on a daily dose of propranolol of 1\u00a0mg/kg, increased to 2\u00a0mg/kg on day 4. Patients were reviewed on the day ward on day 8. All haemangiomas requiring treatment were small to moderate in size (median maximum diameter 2.35\u00a0cm). Except for capillary blood glucose measurement, no patient required venepuncture for additional blood investigations. As all patients had a normal clinical examination, none required ECHO. An ECG was performed on just one patient. No adverse reactions were observed following administration of propranolol. All patients were discharged home on the same day.

    "67": "Autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a potentially dangerous complication of high-level spinal cord injury (SCI) characterized by exaggerated activation of spinal autonomic (sympathetic) reflexes, can cause pulmonary embolism, stroke, and, in severe cases, death. People with high-level SCI also are immune compromised, rendering them more susceptible to infectious morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms underlying postinjury immune suppression are not known. Data presented herein indicate that AD causes immune suppression. Using in vivo telemetry, we show that AD develops spontaneously in SCI mice with the frequency of dysreflexic episodes increasing as a function of time postinjury. As the frequency of AD increases, there is a corresponding increase in splenic leucopenia and immune suppression. Experimental activation of spinal sympathetic reflexes in SCI mice (e.g., via colorectal distension) elicits AD and exacerbates immune suppression via a mechanism that involves aberrant accumulation of norepinephrine and glucocorticoids. Reversal of postinjury immune suppression in SCI mice can be achieved by pharmacological inhibition of receptors for norepinephrine and glucocorticoids during the onset and progression of AD. In a human subject with C5 SCI, stimulating the micturition reflex caused AD with exaggerated catecholamine release and impaired immune function, thus confirming the relevance of the mouse data. These data implicate AD as a cause of secondary immune deficiency after SCI and reveal novel therapeutic targets for overcoming infectious complications that arise due to deficits in immune function.",

Ventricular fibrillation (VF) had occurred during breakfast and was defibrillated by an automated external defibrillator operated by emergency medical service staff. On admission, his ECG demonstrated complete right bundle branch block as the sole abnormality. Intensive examination could not detect any structural disease leading to a diagnosis of idiopathic VF and implantation of an ICD. VF storm occurred one month after hospital discharge and beta-blocker, amiodarone, and sedative administration had no effect on VF. Likewise, catheter ablation for triggering premature ventricular beats failed to control the VF storm. The VF storm then subsided in the following weeks and the patient was discharged on amiodarone. A half month later VF storm recurred and the patient was admitted again. This time, isoproterenol infusion was effective in suppressing VF, and thereafter the patient was administered bepridil and followed up without recurrence of VF for 1.5 years. From these beneficial effects, the VF of the patient was suggested to share common arrhythmogenic characteristics to those of Brugada syndrome or J-wave associated VF.",

We compared the electrocardiographic data and longterm outcomes between patients with apical HCM versus asymmetric HCM. This retrospective study enrolled 796 patients (243 apical HCM and 553 asymmetric HCM). We assessed long-term all-cause and cardiac mortalities using an inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) method and propensity score matched (PSM) analysis. In patients with asymmetric HCM, QT prolongation, QRS widening, PR prolongation, and pathologic Q wave were significantly more frequent. The incidences of early repolarization were similar (11% in apical and 12% in asymmetric HCM, P = 0.19). The median follow-up duration was 6.5 years. There was a borderline significant difference in overall survival rates between the apical and asymmetric HCM groups (73% versus 69%, log rank P = 0.38, IPTW: P = 0.05, PSM: P = 0.05). Regarding cardiac death, asymmetric HCM was more hazardous than apical HCM (89% versus 77%, log rank P = 0.04, IPTW: P = 0.03, PSM: P = 0.03). There was no electrocardiographic predictor for the long-term outcomes, although beta-blocker use was significantly associated with lower overall death (HR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.41-0.81) and slightly lower cardiac death (HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.55-1.33).

The in vitro data were correlated with in vivo data. For level A IVIVC, drug absorption data were calculated using Wagner-Nelson method. In addition, convolution approach was used to approximate plasma drug levels from in vitro dissolution data. The coefficient of determination (R2) for level A IVIVC was 0.720, 0.905, 0.928 and 0.878 for Mepressor, T1, T2 andT3 formulations, respectively, with acceptable percent error (< 15%). The value of R2 for level B and C IVIVC was 0.231and 0.714, respectively. It is also concluded that level A IVIVC is a proficient mathematical model for biowaiver studies involving study parameters as those implemented for T1S (T1formulation tested for dissolution in the presence of sodium lauryl sulfate) revealing that IVIVC level A is dosage form specific, rather than to be drug specific.",

Bx was subjected to acidic and alkaline hydrolysis but degradation was observed only in acidic solutions. The degradation process was described with kinetic and thermodynamic parameters.

    "72": "Defective cardiac mechanical activity in diabetes results from alterations in intracellular Ca(2+) handling, in part, due to increased oxidative stress. Beta-blockers demonstrate marked beneficial effects in heart dysfunction with scavenging free radicals and/or acting as an antioxidant. The aim of this study was to address how \u03b2-blocker timolol-treatment of diabetic rats exerts cardioprotection. Timolol-treatment (12-week), one-week following diabetes induction, prevented diabetes-induced depressed left ventricular basal contractile activity, prolonged cellular electrical activity, and attenuated the increase in isolated-cardiomyocyte size without hyperglycemic effect. Both in vivo and in vitro timolol-treatment of diabetic cardiomyocytes prevented the altered kinetic parameters of Ca(2+) transients and reduced Ca(2+) loading of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), basal intracellular free Ca(2+) and Zn(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i and [Zn(2+)]i), and spatio-temporal properties of the Ca(2+) sparks, significantly. Timolol also antagonized hyperphosphorylation of cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), and significantly restored depleted protein levels of both RyR2 and calstabin2. Western blot analysis demonstrated that timolol-treatment also significantly normalized depressed levels of some [Ca(2+)]i-handling regulators, such as Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) and phospho-phospholamban (pPLN) to PLN ratio. Incubation of diabetic cardiomyocytes with 4-mM glutathione exerted similar beneficial effects on RyR2-macromolecular complex and basal levels of both [Ca(2+)]i and [Zn(2+)]i, increased intracellular Zn(2+) hyperphosphorylated RyR2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Timolol also led to a balanced oxidant/antioxidant level in both heart and circulation and prevented altered cellular redox state of the heart. We thus report, for the first time, that the preventing effect of timolol, directly targeting heart, seems to be associated with a normalization of macromolecular complex of RyR2 and some Ca(2+) handling regulators, and prevention of Ca(2+) leak, and thereby normalization of both [Ca(2+)]i and [Zn(2+)]i homeostasis in diabetic rat heart, at least in part by controlling the cellular redox status of hyperglycemic cardiomyocytes.", 
    "73": "\u03b22 adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) regulated many key physiological processes by activation of a heterotrimeric GTP binding protein (Gs protein). This process could be modulated by different types of ligands. But the details about this modulation process were still not depicted. Here, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the structures of \u03b22AR-Gs protein in complex with different types of ligands. The simulation results demonstrated that the agonist BI-167107 could form hydrogen bonds with Ser203(5.42), Ser207(5.46) and Asn293(6.55) more than the inverse agonist ICI 118,551. The different binding modes of ligands further affected the conformation of \u03b22AR. The energy landscape profiled the energy contour map of the stable and dissociated conformation of G\u03b1s and G\u03b2\u03b3 when different types of ligands bound to \u03b22AR. It also showed the minimum energy pathway about the conformational change of G\u03b1s and G\u03b2\u03b3 along the reaction coordinates. By using interactive essential dynamics analysis, we found that G\u03b1s and G\u03b2\u03b3 domain of Gs protein had the tendency to separate when the inverse agonist ICI 118,551 bound to \u03b22AR. The \u03b15-helix had a relatively quick movement with respect to transmembrane segments of \u03b22AR when the inverse agonist ICI 118,551 bound to \u03b22AR. Besides, the analysis of the centroid distance of G\u03b1s and G\u03b2\u03b3 showed that the G\u03b1s was separated from G\u03b2\u03b3 during the MD simulations. Our results not only could provide details about the different types of ligands that induced conformational change of \u03b22AR and Gs protein, but also supplied more information for different efficacies of drug design of \u03b22AR.",

We evaluate the effects of nebivolol and metoprolol on the RDW and N/L in new essential hypertensive patients. After baseline assessment, 72 patients were randomly allocated to 5 mg/d of nebivolol (n = 37, 20 men) or 100 mg/d of metoprolol (n = 35, 18 men) and treated for 6 months. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), RDW, and N/L were measured before and after treatment. BP significantly decreased with both drugs (P < 0.001). Analog reduction was observed for resting HRs (P < 0.001), but metoprolol caused greater HR fall as compared with nebivolol (P < 0.001). After 6 months of treatment, nebivolol significantly lowered not only RDW but also the total white blood cell and N/L (P < 0.001, P = 0.023, P = 0.017, respectively). No changes were observed in metoprolol group. Percent decrease in RDW was found to be significantly higher in nebivolol than in the metoprolol group (P = 0.001) and remained also after correction for confounders (P = 0.012). Nebivolol improved RDW and N/L to a greater extent than metoprolol in patients with hypertension.

    "86": "Beta adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) subtypes act through diverse signaling cascades to modulate cardiac function and remodeling. Previous in vitro studies suggest that \u03b21-AR signaling is cardiotoxic whereas \u03b22-AR signaling is cardioprotective, and may be the case during ischemia/reperfusion in vivo. The objective of this study was to assess whether \u03b22-ARs also play a cardioprotective role in the pathogenesis of non-ischemic forms of cardiomyopathy. To dissect the role of \u03b21 vs \u03b22-ARs in modulating MLP (Muscle LIM Protein) cardiomyopathy, we crossbred MLP-/- with \u03b21-/- or \u03b22-/- mice. Deletion of the \u03b22-AR improved survival, cardiac function, exercise capacity and myocyte shortening; by contrast haploinsufficency of the \u03b21-AR reduced survival. Pathologic changes in Ca(2+) handling were reversed in the absence of \u03b22-ARs: peak Ca(2+) and SR Ca(2+) were decreased in MLP-/- and \u03b21+/-/MLP-/- but restored in \u03b22-/-MLP-/-. These changes were associated with reversal of alterations in troponin I and phospholamban phosphorylation. Gi inhibition increased peak and baseline Ca(2+), recapitulating changes observed in the \u03b22-/-/MLP-/-. The L-type Ca(2+) blocker verapamil significantly decreased cardiac function in \u03b22-/-MLP-/- vs WT. We next tested if the protective effects of \u03b22-AR ablation were unique to the MLP model using TAC-induced heart failure. Similar to MLP, \u03b22-/- mice demonstrated delayed progression of heart failure with restoration of myocyte shortening and peak Ca(2+) and Ca(2+) release. Deletion of \u03b22-ARs prevents the development of MLP-/- cardiomyopathy via positive modulation of Ca(2+) due to removal of inhibitory Gi signaling and increased phosphorylation of troponin I and phospholamban. Similar effects were seen after TAC. Unlike previous models where \u03b22-ARs were found to be cardioprotective, in these two models, \u03b22-AR signaling appears to be deleterious, potentially through negative regulation of Ca(2+) dynamics.", 
    "87": "Green tea catechins have been shown to affect the activities of drug transporters in vitro, including P-glycoprotein and organic anion transporting polypeptides. However, it remains unclear whether catechins influence the in vivo disposition of substrate drugs for these transporters. In the present study, we investigated effects of green tea extract (GTE) and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on pharmacokinetics of a non-selective hydrophilic \u03b2-blocker nadolol, which is reported to be a substrate for several drug transporters and is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received GTE (400 mg/kg), EGCG (150 mg/kg) or saline (control) by oral gavage, 30 min before a single intragastric administration of 10 mg/kg nadolol. Plasma and urinary concentrations of nadolol were determined using high performance liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by a noncompartmental analysis. Pretreatment with GTE resulted in marked reductions in the maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the time-plasma concentration curve (AUC) of nadolol by 85% and 74%, respectively, as compared with control. In addition, EGCG alone significantly reduced Cmax and AUC of nadolol. Amounts of nadolol excreted into the urine were decreased by pretreatments with GTE and EGCG, while the terminal half-life of nadolol was not different among groups. These results suggest that the coadministration with green tea catechins, particularly EGCG, causes a significant alteration in the pharmacokinetics of nadolol, possibly through the inhibition of its intestinal absorption mediated by uptake transporters.",

Cholesterol is believed to play a key role in this process, but the molecular mechanisms linking cholesterol and amyloid channel formation have so far remained elusive. Here, we show that the short A\u03b222-35 peptide, which encompasses the cholesterol-binding domain of A\u03b2, induces a specific increase of Ca(2+) levels in neural cells. This effect is neither observed in calcium-free medium nor in cholesterol-depleted cells, and is inhibited by zinc, a blocker of amyloid channel activity. Double mutations V24G/K28G and N27R/K28R in A\u03b222-35 modify cholesterol binding and abrogate channel formation. Molecular dynamic simulations suggest that cholesterol induces a tilted \u03b1-helical topology of A\u03b222-35. This facilitates the establishment of an inter-peptide hydrogen bond network involving Asn-27 and Lys-28, a key step in the octamerization of A\u03b222-35 which proceeds gradually until the formation of a perfect annular channel in a phosphatidylcholine membrane. Overall, these data give mechanistic insights into the role of cholesterol in amyloid channel formation, opening up new therapeutic options for Alzheimer's disease.

    "89": "\u03b2-blockers are a class of drugs that are widely used in treating cardiac, respiratory and other ailments. They act by blocking \u03b2-adrenergic receptor-mediated signaling. Studies in various cancers have shown that patients taking a \u03b2-blocker have higher survival and lower recurrence and metastasis rates. This is supported by several preclinical and in vitro studies showing that adrenergic activation modulates apoptosis, promotes angiogenesis and other cancer hallmarks, and these effects can be abrogated by \u03b2-blockers.

However, many patients require combination approaches for effective control of blood pressure, and new drugs are required for reaching target blood pressure values in difficult-to-treat subjects. Indeed, initial use of combination therapies more effectively lowered blood pressure, resulting in a further decreased risk of stroke compared to antihypertensive monotherapy (Yu, J. et al., Abst PO-13). Nevertheless, novel drugs and new fixed-drug combinations are being developed, as reported in the following report from this year's American Society of Hypertension meeting. As exemplified by a comparison of newer versus older antihypertensive drugs in Sub-Saharan African countries that demonstrated the superiority of valsartan/amlodipine versus bisoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide (M'Buyamba-Kabangu, J.R. et al., Abst PO-86), newer drugs are beating the efficacy of older agents, and drugs currently in development may eventually demonstrate greater benefits that drugs considered new today.

In the wake of this evidence, we evaluated the possible therapeutic effect of BBs in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. We identified 800 postmenopausal women operated between 1997 and 2008 for early primary TNBC. The effect of BB intake on the risk of breast cancer (BC) recurrence and death was evaluated through competing risk and Cox regression survival models. At cancer diagnosis, 74 (9.3\u00a0%) women out of 800 were BBs users. Median age was 62\u00a0years in BB users and 59\u00a0years in non-users (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). BB users and non-users were similarly distributed by all tumor characteristics. The 5-year cumulative incidence of BC-related events was 13.6\u00a0% in BB users and 27.9\u00a0% in non-users (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). The beneficial impact of BBs remained statistically significant at multivariable analysis (HR, 0.52; 95\u00a0% CI 0.28-0.97), after the adjustment for age, tumor stage, and treatment, peritumoral vascular invasion and use of other antihypertensive drugs, antithrombotics, and statins.

Hypertension, other antihypertensive drugs, antithrombotics, and statins did not impact prognosis. In this series of postmenopausal TNBC patients, BB intake was associated with a significantly decreased risk of BC-related recurrence, metastasis, and BC death.

This investigation aimed to study the drug release kinetics of betaxolol hydrochloride from a hydrophobic matrix system of PMMA cast with incorporating different proportions of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and evaluate its ability to improve ocular bioavailability and duration of action for the drug. Matrix type ocular inserts were prepared by the film casting technique and characterized in vitro by drug release studies using a flow through apparatus that simulated the eye conditions. All the formulations were subjected to physicochemical evaluation. Rabbit model with steroid induced glaucoma was used to establish in vivo efficacy of inserts. Polymer composition and concentration significantly affected the drug release based on change in diffusional path length and formation of gelaneous pores by polymer erosion. Formulations released the drug by non-fickian diffusion including anomalous transport (0.5<n<1) and super case II transport (n>1). It was also observed that increasing the proportion of PEO in to PMMA does not affect the blend miscibility. IVIVC suggested no significant difference (P< 0.001) between in vitro and in vivo release of drug from inserts.

The aetiology and pathogenesis seems to be multifactorial and poorly understood, with the available literature rather conflicting. In recent years, there has been increased interest in the role played by genetic predisposition in the development of PCM. It probably develops as a result of a complex interaction of pregnancy-associated factors and genetic factors and recently there have been many observations pointing out the central role played by a genetic predisposition. The direct and indirect observations on genetic susceptibility may offer new insights into the pathogenesis of PCM.

    "122": "Metabolic liver functions are significantly involved in the total clearance of a number of drugs. In liver cirrhosis the reduced drug elimination is a result of the blood flow through the liver, hepatocytes function and volume of hepatic tissue. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes depend on the nature and degree of hepatic impairment and on the characteristics of the dosed drug. Hepatocytes have a different extraction ability with respect to the individual drugs. The following are examples of drugs with high hepatic extraction: anodyne, propranolol, metoprolol, verapamil and lidocaine. These drugs are significantly dependent on the first passage through the liver. Intrahepatic and extrahepatic collateral blood flows significantly increase their bio-logical availability and reduce the clearance. The reduction in hepatic clearance of drugs with low extraction coefficient, such as chlordiazepoxide, diazepam or furosemide, is a result of its own limited functional capacity to eliminate the drug. Predicting a hepatic metabolic disorder based on a common bio-chemical assessment of enzyme activities is not sufficient. In advanced liver cirrhosis a higher risk is demonstrated for drugs with a narrow therapeutic width. It is always necessary to take into account whether the pharmacotherapy is necessary, use small doses and cautiously monitor the patient.", 
    "123": "Retrieval of drug-associated memories is critical for maintaining addictive behaviors, as presentation of drug-associated cues can elicit drug seeking and relapse. Recently, we and others have demonstrated that \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) activation is necessary for retrieval using both rat and human memory models. Importantly, blocking retrieval with \u03b2-AR antagonists persistently impairs retrieval and provides protection against subsequent reinstatement. However, the neural locus at which \u03b2-ARs are required for maintaining retrieval and subsequent reinstatement is unclear. Here, we investigated the necessity of dorsal hippocampus (dHipp) \u03b2-ARs for drug-associated memory retrieval. Using a cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) model, we demonstrate that local dHipp \u03b2-AR blockade before a CPP test prevents CPP expression shortly and long after treatment, indicating that dHipp \u03b2-AR blockade induces a memory retrieval disruption. Furthermore, this retrieval disruption provides long-lasting protection against cocaine-induced reinstatement. The effects of \u03b2-AR blockade were dependent on memory reactivation and were not attributable to reconsolidation disruption as blockade of \u03b2-ARs immediately after a CPP test had little effect on subsequent CPP expression. Thus, cocaine-associated memory retrieval is mediated by \u03b2-AR activity within the dHipp, and disruption of this activity could prevent cue-induced drug seeking and relapse long after treatment.",

In the present study, \u03b23-AR expression in mouse B16F10 melanoma cells was demonstrated and the effects of two widely used \u03b23-AR blockers, SR59230A and L-748,337, were evaluated in comparison with propranolol, a \u03b21-/\u03b22-AR blocker with poor affinity for \u03b23-ARs, and with siRNAs targeting specific \u03b2-ARs. Both SR59230A and L-748,337 reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, likely through the involvement of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase. In addition, hypoxia upregulated \u03b23-ARs and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in B16F10 cells, whereas SR59230A or L-748,337 prevented the hypoxia-induced VEGF upregulation. Melanoma was induced in mice by inoculation of B16F10 cells. Intra-tumor injections of SR59230A or L-748,337 significantly reduced melanoma growth by reducing cell proliferation and stimulating apoptosis. SR59230A or L-748,337 treatment also resulted in significant decrease of the tumor vasculature. The decrease in tumor vasculature was due to apoptosis of endothelial cells and not to downregulation of angiogenic factors. These results demonstrate that SR59230A and L-748,337 significantly inhibit melanoma growth by reducing tumor cell proliferation and activating tumor cell death.

We started investigating the issue of palatability of drugs among children in 2004 using smile-face scales. In the first trial we compared taste and smell acceptability of pulverized angiotensin receptor antagonists among nephropathic children and found that the score assigned to candesartan was significantly higher than that assigned to irbesartan, losartan, telmisartan and valsartan. In the second trial we compared the taste of pulverized amlodipine and lercanidipine among children and found that the score assigned to lercanidipine was significantly higher.

    "133": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality for women in the United States. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), approximately one in three female adults have some form of cardiovascular disease. AHA suggests there is evidence showing that women at risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) are less often referred for the appropriate diagnostic test than are men. Coronary anatomy and pathology have traditionally been defined and identified by coronary angiography, a procedure that is indicated in patients who have chest pain and are at high risk for CAD. For intermediate-risk patients, clinicians have a wide range of noninvasive technologies (NITs) to choose from that can assess functional status (i.e., ischemia or no ischemia) or visualize anatomic abnormalities (i.e., no CAD, nonobstructive CAD, or obstructive CAD). Functional modalities include stress electrocardiography (ECG); stress echocardiography (ECHO); and stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging, including single-proton emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). Anatomic modalities include stress myocardial perfusion and wall-motion cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and coronary computed tomography angiography (coronary CTA). The comparative safety and accuracy of these NITs in women was uncertain, although substantial data exists for populations combining men and women, and for mixed populations of known and no known CAD. In 2012, a Comparative Effectiveness Review (CER), \u201cNoninvasive Technologies for the Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease in Women,\u201d evaluated the diagnostic accuracy and risks of NITs in women with symptoms suspicious for CAD, including assessing predictors affecting test accuracy, and the ability of NITs to provide risk stratification and prognostic information, inform decisionmaking about treatment options, and affect clinical outcomes. A total of 104 comparative studies (110 articles) were included. For women with no known CAD, the summary of accuracy for each NIT modality compared with coronary angiography was ECG (29 studies): sensitivity 62 percent, specificity 68 percent; ECHO (14 studies): sensitivity 79 percent, specificity 83 percent; SPECT (14 studies): sensitivity 81 percent, specificity 78 percent; CMR (5 studies): sensitivity 72 percent, specificity 84 percent; and CTA (5 studies): sensitivity 94 percent, specificity 87 percent. Compared with men evaluated in the same studies, in women ECG and coronary CTA modalities were both less sensitive and less specific. The ECHO and SPECT modalities, although less sensitive, appeared to be more specific in women. The lower specificity of the ECG modality in women was the only statistically significant difference. Strength of evidence was high for ECG, ECHO, and SPECT, and was low for CMR and coronary CTA compared with coronary angiography in women. Eleven comparative studies examined predictors of diagnostic accuracy in women such as postmenopausal status, race/ethnicity, heart size, beta blocker use, and pretest probability; insufficient evidence was available to draw conclusions about predictors that affect accuracy. Eight studies assessed risk stratification and prognostic factors, two studies assessed treatment decisionmaking, and four studies provided comparative clinical outcomes but provided insufficient evidence on the comparative effectiveness of NITs to provide risk stratification, prognostic information, treatment decisionmaking, or impact on clinical outcomes in women. Thirteen comparative studies reported risks. Of these, four studies of coronary CTA showed a higher mean effective radiation dose and attributable risk of cancer incidence in women compared with men; however, radiation safety issues were not discussed in other NIT modalities with radiation exposure. Thus, there was insufficient evidence regarding the comparative risks of various NIT modalities in women. Given the clinical and economic importance of noninvasive testing for CAD in women, the ongoing investment in NIT research, and the remaining areas of uncertainty, we sought to create a prioritized research agenda that would represent the interests of diverse stakeholders and allow the remaining areas of uncertainty to be addressed.",

This review will mainly focus on those GV located in the fundus of the stomach (isolated gastric varices 1 and gastroesophageal varices 2). The 1-year risk of GV bleeding has been reported to be around 10%-16%. Size of GV, presence of red signs, and the degree of liver dysfunction are independent predictors of bleeding. Limited data suggest that tissue adhesives, mainly cyanoacrylate (CA), may be effective and better than propranolol in preventing bleeding from GV. General management of acute GV bleeding must be similar to that of esophageal variceal bleeding, including prophylactic antibiotics, a careful replacement of volemia, and early administration of vasoactive drugs. Small sample-sized randomized controlled trials have shown that tissue adhesives are the therapy of choice for acute GV bleeding. In treatment failures, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is considered the treatment of choice. After initial hemostasis, repeated sessions with CA injections along with nonselective beta-blockers are recommended as secondary prophylaxis; whether CA is superior to TIPS in this scenario is not completely clear. Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) has been introduced as a new method to treat GV. BRTO is also effective and has the potential benefit of increasing portal hepatic blood flow and therefore may be an alternative for patients who may not tolerate TIPS. However, BRTO obliterates spontaneous portosystemic shunts, potentially aggravating portal hypertension and its related complications. The role of BRTO in the management of acute GV bleeding is promising but merits further evaluation.",

Its physiological effects include the regulation of blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature, and the inhibition of gastric acid secretion. The action of NmU in rats is mediated by two G-protein-coupled receptors, NmU-1R and NmU-2R. NmU-2R is present mainly in the brain, and NmU-1R mainly in the periphery. Despite the great variety of the physiological action of NmU, little is known about its possible effects in different forms of behavior, such as anxiety. In the present work, NmU-23 (the rodent form of the peptide) was tested for its effect on anxiety in elevated plus maze test in mice. For detection of the possible involvement of neurotransmitters, the mice were pretreated with receptor blockers: haloperidol (a D2, dopamine receptor antagonist), propranolol (a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist), atropine (a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist), phenoxybenzamine (a nonselective \u03b1-adrenergic receptor antagonist) or nitro-l-arginine (a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor). The peptide and nitro-l-arginine were administered into the lateral brain ventricle, while the receptor blockers were applied intraperitoneally. An NmU-23 dose 0.5\u03bcg elicited anxiolytic action, whereas this action is faded away when the dose was increased. For further testing therefore 0.5\u03bcg i.c.v. was used. Propranolol and atropine fully blocked the NmU-induced anxiolytic action, while haloperidol, phenoxybenzamine and nitro-l-arginine were ineffective.

Therefore, in this study, we examined the biological and clinical significance of APP in breast carcinoma using immunohistochemistry and in vitro studies. APP immunoreactivity was detected in 57 out of 117 (49%) breast carcinoma tissues examined, and it was positively associated with androgen receptor (AR) expression. APP immunoreactivity was also significantly associated with Ki-67 LI and increased risk of recurrence in the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cases, and was an independent prognostic factor in these patients. Subsequent in vitro experiments demonstrated that APP mRNA expression was significantly induced by biologically active androgen dihydrotestosterone in both a dose-dependent and a time-dependent manner in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, which was potently suppressed by an AR blocker hydroxyflutamide. Moreover, cell proliferation activity of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was significantly associated with their APP expression level. These findings suggest that APP is an androgen-induced gene that promotes proliferation activity of breast carcinoma cells.

The purpose of the current experiments was to develop a mouse model of pediatric heart disease and test whether the influence of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) antagonism could be modeled in this system. We hypothesized that isoproterenol treatment of young mice would provide a model system of cardiac pathology, and that nonselective \u03b2-AR blockade would provide benefit in adult, but not young, mice, similar to clinical trial data. We found that isoproterenol treatment (through osmotic minipump implantation) of young and adult mice produced similar degrees of cardiac hypertrophy and recapitulated several age-related molecular abnormalities in human heart failure, including phospholamban phosphorylation and \u03b2-AR expression. We also found that nonselective \u03b2-AR blockade effectively prevented pathological cardiac growth and collagen expression in the adult but not young mice, and that selective \u03b21-AR blockade was effective in both young and adult isoproterenol-treated mice.

    "188": "9580 individuals aged 65 years to 84 years who were admitted to hospital with their first AMI diagnosis between 1 January 1995 and 1 January 2006.", 
    "189": "Time to death from any cause out to 11 years after first AMI, identified from registry data, was the primary outcome measure. Cardiovascular drugs dispensed within 28 days following hospital discharge were identified as main exposure categories.", 
    "190": "In total, 975 deaths occurred during 1 year follow-up, culminating to 3247 by 11 years. 1-year risk of death was significantly reduced for all drug combinations, but not for drugs dispensed in isolation. Out to 11 years, only combinations of '\u03b2-blockers and statins' (with or without ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEi/ARB)) provided significant reductions in risk of all-cause mortality. In men, the greatest reduction in risk was associated with being dispensed '\u03b2-blockers and statins' (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.58), whereas women benefited most from being dispensed '\u03b2-blockers, statins and ACEi/ARBs' (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.99).", 
    "191": "The combination of '\u03b2-blockers and statins' (with or without ACEi/ARB) dispensed within 28 days postdischarge was associated with the greatest long-term survival following an AMI. Our observations of significantly reduced mortality risk in men (compared with women) who were dispensed '\u03b2-blockers and statins', or '\u03b2-blockers and ACEi/ARBs', warrants further investigation.", 
    "192": "Night blood pressure (BP) predicts patient outcomes. Variables associated with night BP response to antihypertensive agents have not been fully evaluated in essential hypertension.", 
    "193": "We sought to measure night BP responses to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), atenolol (ATEN), and combined therapy using ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring in 204 black and 281 white essential hypertensive patients. Initial therapy was randomized; HCTZ and ATEN once daily doses were doubled after 3 weeks and continued for 6 more weeks with the alternate medication added for combined therapy arms. ABP was measured at baseline and after completion of each drug. Night, day, and night/day BP ratio responses (treatment - baseline) were compared in race/sex subgroups.", 
    "194": "Baseline night systolic BP and diastolic BP, and night/day ratios were greater in blacks than whites (P < 0.01, all comparisons). Night BP responses to ATEN were absent and night/day ratios increased significantly in blacks (P < 0.05). At the end of combined therapy, women, blacks, and those starting with HCTZ as opposed to ATEN had significantly greater night BP responses (P < 0.01). Variables that significantly associated with ATEN response differed from those that associated with HCTZ response and those that associated with night BP response differed from those that associated with day BP response.", 
    "195": "In summary, after completion of HCTZ and ATEN therapy, women, blacks, and those who started with HCTZ had greater night BP responses. Reduced night BP response and increased night/day BP ratios occured with ATEN in blacks. Given the prognostic significance of night BP, strategies for optimizing night BP antihypertensive therapy should be considered.",

    "198": "Rat myocardial infarction (MI) model was produced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. Forty-eight rats were randomized to the following groups before surgery: sham-operated group (n=8), MI group (n=10), and three carvedilol-treatment groups (n=30, 2 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg).", 
    "199": "Four days after MI, carvedilol treatment could ameliorate left ventricular dysfunction by inhibiting the MI-induced increase of left ventricular end diastolic pressure and the decrease of left ventricle end systolic pressure and the changes to their maximum rates (+dp/dtmax and -dp/dtmax). Histological examination showed that carvedilol attenuated myocardium necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration. In parallel, the treatment also suppressed the expression of NF-\u03baB and TLR4 induced by MI, but increased the expression of \u03b2-arrestin 2.", 
    "200": "These results indicate that short term administration of carvedilol could improve early cardiac dysfunction in a rat model of MI. This beneficial effect may be attributed to inhibit the expression of NF-\u03baB and TLR4, but induce the expression of \u03b2-arrestin 2 in the infarct region of the myocardium, which would suppress inflammation.", 
    "201": "Agranulocytosis is known to be a rare side effect of thionamides. This complication puts pregnant patients at particular risk for infections. Obstetricians caring for such patients have the difficult task of deciding between conservative or surgical management.", 
    "202": "The patient is a 37-year-old gravida 4 para 3 Hispanic woman at 11 weeks of gestation with recently diagnosed hyperthyroidism who presented with a neutropenic fever and ecthyma as a complication of thionamide use. She subsequently underwent a thyroidectomy and then had a spontaneous abortion on postoperative day 2.", 
    "203": "This patient had life-threatening thyrotoxicosis complicated by neutropenic fever and infection, likely caused by a reaction to thionamides. She quickly recovered with broad-spectrum antibiotics. She could not be restarted on methimazole or propylthiouracil as a result of agranulocytosis and thus underwent thyroidectomy.", 
    "204": "Long-QT syndrome is a rare, inherited cardiac channelopathy that is characterized by arrhythmia, syncope and sudden cardiac death. Foetal symptoms are very rare and prenatal diagnosis is difficult. We report on a foetal presentation of long-QT syndrome with severe hydrops and a chaotic heart rhythm at 32 weeks of gestation. Postnatal electrocardiography showed runs of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and an extremely prolonged-QT segment (QTc of 640 ms). The initial approach of overdrive pacing, followed by the combined therapy of a beta blocker, a sodium channel blocker (mexiletine) and potassium suppletion proved successful in maintaining a stable sinus rhythm. The girl was doing well at eight months of followup. In this patient a timely diagnosis and effective management after birth have been life-saving.The intrauterine manifestation of foetal atrioventricular dissociation and ventricular arrhythmia should raise suspicion of congenital long-QT syndrome."
