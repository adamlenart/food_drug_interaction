    "0": "1. Inhibition of mechanical activity in longitudinal muscle strips of rabbit duodenum was induced by perivascular and intramural nerve stimulation.2. The effects of perivascular stimulation were abolished by phentolamine + propranolol, guanethidine, reserpine and by tetrodotoxin. The effects of intramural stimulation were abolished only by tetrodotoxin.3. Noradrenaline, phenylephrine, isoprenaline, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine each produced an inhibition of mechanical activity. The relative potencies of these agonists were noradrenaline>isoprenaline>phenylephrine>ATP>ADP>adenosine>AMP.4. Exposure of tissues to high concentrations of either ATP or adenosine desensitized the tissue to further exposure to ATP, ADP, AMP and adenosine, whilst the inhibitory effects of noradrenaline, phenylephrine and isoprenaline and of perivascular and intramural stimulation were unaffected. The effects of desensitization were reversible.5. It was concluded that the effects of intramural stimulation were mediated neither by noradrenaline nor by adenosine or its derivatives.", 
    "1": "The melatonin (5-methoxy-N-acetylserotonin) content and N-acetyltransferase activity of rat pineal increase rapidly in response to physical immobilization or insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Carbohydrate consumption, which causes insulin release without hypoglycemia, does not elicit these pineal responses. Prior treatment with propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, inhibits the N-acetyltransferase responses to hypoglycemia and immobilization, indicating that these changes result from stimulation of pineal beta-receptors by a catecholamine, presumably norepinephrine released from pineal sympathetic nerve terminals. Prior destruction of those terminals with 6-hydroxydopamine does not block, but actually potentiates, the increase in melatonin content and N-acetyltransferase activity after induced hypoglycemia or immobilization. This finding probably reflects an action of circulating catecholamines, secreted from the adrenal medullae or surviving sympathetic nerve terminals, on supersensitive pineal cells. These observations indicate that factors other than changes in environmental lighting, which modify sympathetic nervous tone, can also influence pineal function.", 
    "2": "1. Under certain conditions D-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 10(-9)-10(-6) g/ml., exerted an immediate, prolonged and slowly reversible inhibitory effect upon the post-ganglionic motor transmission in desheathed guinea-pig vas deferens preparations.2. The most critical factor influencing this action of LSD appeared to be the train length. With short trains of less than 4 or 5 pulses the twitch inhibition produced by LSD was often total. With longer trains (5-20 pulses), the degree of inhibition declined with increase in train length. These results suggest the existence of two components in the motor response to post-ganglionic stimulation, distinguished by their susceptibility to LSD.3. The inhibition of the LSD-susceptible component was related to the dose of LSD in the range 10(-9)-10(-6) g/ml., reaching a maximum at 0.5-1 x 10(-6) g/ml. The response remnants elicited by trains of more than 5 pulses under these conditions could not be reduced further by a ten- to twenty-fold increase in LSD concentration to 10(-5) g/ml. and were in fact slightly potentiated.4. The inhibition of post-ganglionic motor transmission by LSD was not explicable on the basis of an alpha-adrenoceptor blockade because it was not associated with any reduction in motor responses to noradrenaline.5. The use of propranolol excluded mediation of the LSD-inhibition by beta-adrenoceptors.6. The LSD effect was not due to a non-specific smooth muscle depression because it was not associated with any reduction in motor responses to acetylcholine, ATP or bradykinin.7. The inhibitory effect of LSD on post-ganglionic transmission resembled that of noradrenaline in that it was antagonized by phentolamine; another alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent, phenoxybenzamine, was less effective than phentolamine in this respect.8. The LSD-inhibition was obtained in preparations taken from reserpinized guinea-pigs.9. The inhibition of motor transmission in the vas deferens by LSD was confirmed in rats, Meriones shawii and rabbits.10. The inhibition of post-ganglionic transmission by LSD was unrelated to its ability to antagonize 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), to which the longitudinal muscle of the guinea-pig vas deferens is insensitive. The more potent 5-HT antagonists, methysergide and BOL 148 were either virtually inactive or considerably weaker than LSD.", 
    "3": "Histamine-induced relaxation of the sheep bronchus was antagonized by burimamide but not by mepyramine, indicating the presence of H(2)-receptors. Mepyramine or burimamide alone produced partial antagonism of histamine-induced relaxation of the cat trachea. Both inhibitors added simultaneously effectively abolished the histamine response, suggesting that both H(1)- and H(2)-receptors are active in relaxing the cat trachea.", 
    "4": "1. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties of (+/-)-1-(2-acetyl-4-n-butyramidophenoxy)-2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropane hydrochloride (M&B 17,803A) have been compared with those of practolol and propranolol in the guinea-pig, cat and dog.2. Following either intravenous or oral administration in the cat or dog, M&B 17,803A and practolol had similar potency in antagonizing isoprenaline-induced tachycardia and both showed cardioselectivity, but both were less potent than propranolol.3. M&B 17,803A and practolol had approximately one hundredth the intravenous potency of propranolol in increasing the severity of anaphylactic bronchospasm in the conscious sensitized guinea-pig.4. M&B 17,803A possessed less marked intrinsic sympathomimetic activity than practolol but, like propranolol, it had significant local anaesthetic properties and increased the refractory period of rabbit isolated atria.", 
    "5": "1. L7810 (4-carbamoyloxy-1-(4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-oxobutyl) decahydroquinoline, has a local anaesthetic action on frog nerve 1.75 times that of procaine.2. L7810 protected anaesthetized guinea-pigs against ouabain-induced ventricular fibrillation and increased the lethal dose of ouabain.3. L7810 reduced the rate of rise of intracellularly recorded action potentials in rabbit isolated atria; the resting potential was not affected, but the duration of the action potential was prolonged.4. Unlike most drugs with local anaesthetic properties L7810 did not depress contractions in isolated atria but increased them.5. L7810 reduced the spontaneous frequency, maximum follow frequency and conduction velocity of rabbit isolated atria.6. L7810 had no blocking action on the chronotropic or positive inotropic actions of isoprenaline on isolated atrial muscle.7. In anaesthetized dogs L7810 caused a small dose-related bradycardia, and a large dose-related decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. There was no blockade of the effects of isoprenaline on heart rate or peripheral blood flow.", 
    "6": "Receptors for small endogenous hormones on human leukocytes were studied by insolubilizing the hormones and incubating them with the cells. Histamine, norepinephrine, and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) were conjugated to either of two types of carrier: (bovine or rabbit) serum albumin or a random copolymer of DL-alanine and L-tyrosine. The conjugates were linked to agarose beads (Sepharose) and the resultant drug-conjugate-beads were incubated with leukocytes. Norepinephrine (when linked to its carrier via glutaraldehyde) and histamine preparations bound the majority of leukocytes. The binding appeared to be specific for the hormones tested. For example, the binding by histamine-rabbit serum albumin-Sepharose was prevented or reversed by high concentrations of histamine and histamine antagonists, but not by catecholamines or their pharmacologic antagonists. Similarly, binding of cells to the norepinephrine conjugate was inhibited by some catecholamines and propranolol, but not by histamine or histamine antagonists. Conjugates of norepinephrine linked via carbodiimide did not bind cells. The protein or copolymer carriers did not contribute to binding per se. The hormone-protein-conjugates bound more cells than the hormone-polymer conjugates. The former (unlike the free amines) failed to stimulate accumulation of cyclic AMP in leukocytes. The norepinephrine linked to polymer via glutaraldehyde, however, did stimulate leukocyte cyclic AMP accumulation, possibly because of the flexibility of the polymer. Columns of the various Sepharoses were used to determine the distribution of receptors to each hormone in mixed leukocyte populations. The majority of cells appeared to have receptors for both histamine and norepinephrine (bound through glutaraldehyde). Receptors to prostaglandins may have been detected by the column procedure, but their distribution could not be quantitated. The approach described provides a means to separate leukocytes on the basis of what are likely to be preformed receptors to small endogenous hormones, and to study the physiologic importance and function of the receptors.", 
    "7": "Three patients with angina pectoris treated with practolol in varying doses developed a syndrome of arthralgia, particularly of the small joints of the hands, rash, fever, a raised E.S.R., and positive tests for lupus erythematosus (L.E.) cells and antinuclear antibody. The syndrome responded partly to withdrawal of the drug, but steroids were required to produce adequate symptomatic improvement. These disease features suggest that this is an example of drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus (S.L.E.). The impaired ability of lymphocytes from these patients to transform in vitro indicates a testable hypothesis for the pathogenesis of the syndrome.", 
    "8": "Twenty-eight thyrotoxic patients were treated with propranolol. In seven patients the drug had to be discontinued after one or two months, but in the remaining 21 clinical improvement was observed. Serial clinical studies and tests of thyroid function performed at monthly intervals showed that in four patients thyrotoxicosis remitted and all indices of thyroid function returned to normal. A fifth patient shows distinct evidence of remission with the 20-minute (132)I uptake falling to normal, although the free-thyroxine index remains slightly raised. It is likely that these remissions reflect the natural tendency of the disease to remit since propranolol is not considered to have any direct in-vivo effect on thyroid function.However, because of failure to gain adequate control of symptoms in all patients treated, and the fact that circulating thyroid hormone levels were often not restored to normal, propranolol is considered an unsatisfactory alternative to conventional antithyroid drugs for routine treatment.", 
    "9": "The biphasic nature of the lipolytic dose-response curve of epinephrine in fat cells from \"young\" rats (40-45 days) was confirmed. The first phase (Lipolysis I) occurred at concentrations of from 10(-7) m to 3 x 10(-6) m. The second phase (Lipolysis II) occurred at concentrations of from 10(-5) m to 3 x 10(-4) m. Insulin (0.1 mU/ml) abolished Lipolysis I and slightly augmented Lipolysis II. Higher concentrations of insulin (1.0 mU/ml) augmented Lipolysis II even further. These results may help to explain some of the conflicting reports in the literature concerning the effects of insulin on lipolysis. The dose-response curve of epinephrine using fat cells from \"old\" rats (14-16 months) was monophasic. Based on results with propranolol, K(+)-free media, and insulin, it was concluded that the lipolytic response in tissue from older animals corresponds to Lipolysis II in tissue from younger rats. The lipolytic response to ACTH was greatly reduced in the cells from the older rats, but the response to theophylline was unaltered."
