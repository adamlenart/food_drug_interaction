    "0": "In a previous randomized trial, we demonstrated that propranolol prevented recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. We have undertaken the present study in a new group of patients to ascertain the factors associated with rebleeding. Among 232 patients with cirrhosis admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding, 127 were included. They received propranolol orally at a dose reducing the heart rate by 25%. The median follow-up period was 682 days. The following factors were studied: cause of cirrhosis; severity of cirrhosis; hepatocellular carcinoma recognized after inclusion; compliance; persistent decrease in heart rate; dose of propranolol; alcohol abstinence; previous history of hemorrhage; time interval from hemorrhage to onset of propranolol administration, and source of bleeding. The percentage of patients free of rebleeding was 71% at 1 year and 57% at 2 years. Only five factors were significantly and independently associated with rebleeding: occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma; lack of compliance; lack of persistent decrease in heart rate; lack of abstinence, and previous history of bleeding. In conclusion, this study confirms the results of our previous trial and suggests that certain factors play a role in the mechanism of rebleeding in patients receiving propranolol.", 
    "1": "We investigated the hemodynamic effect of synthetic atrial natriuretic factor Auriculin A (ANF) and its influence on arterial baroreflex control of heart rate, systemic blood pressure, and perfusion pressure in the hind limb (perfused at constant flow) in rabbits anesthetized with alpha-chloralose and urethane. The neural mechanisms underlying these effects were also studied. In the intact animal, a 45-minute constant infusion of ANF (2 micrograms/kg prime, 0.2 microgram/kg/min) significantly reduced mean blood pressure and increased mean perfusion pressure, while heart rate did not change. Comparable data were obtained with lower (0.5 microgram/kg + 0.05 microgram/kg/min; 1 microgram/kg + 0.1 microgram/kg/min) or higher (4 micrograms/kg + 0.4 microgram/kg/min; 8 micrograms/kg + 0.8 microgram/kg/min) doses of ANF. In addition, ANF enhanced bradycardic reflex responses to phenylephrine i.v. bolus administration, while it did not change baroreflex-mediated responses to nitroglycerin i.v. bolus administration and to 30-second bilateral carotid occlusion. The specificity of the influence of ANF on arterial baroreflex responses was confirmed by the observation that no significant change in reflex responses to phenylephrine or carotid occlusion was detectable during a comparable decrease in blood pressure induced by a constant infusion of nitroglycerin. Bilateral vagotomy prevented both the fall in blood pressure and the increase in perfusion pressure induced by ANF, while cholinergic blockade (atropine, 0.5 mg/kg i.v.) or adrenergic blockade (propranolol, 0.3 mg/kg i.v. + phentolamine, 0.3 mg/kg i.v.) did not modify the hemodynamic response to ANF observed in the intact animal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "Long-term treatment of hypertensive rats with arterial vasodilators may further increase left ventricular hypertrophy. Since left ventricular hypertrophy may be an important determinant of outcome in hypertension, the long-term effects of arterial vasodilation with hydralazine on left ventricular mass and function were compared with those of an alternative third-line drug, the alpha1 blocker prazosin, in patients still hypertensive despite combined diuretic and beta blocker therapy. A single-blind, randomized, two-group parallel design was employed. Both treatments induced a sustained antihypertensive effect, with hydralazine showing more effect on supine blood pressure, and prazosin having more effect on standing pressure. Heart rate, cardiac output, and volume status showed only minor changes. Plasma norepinephrine showed a sustained increase when measured in both the supine and standing positions, but the increases were similar for the two treatments. Supine and standing plasma renin activity increased only during long-term treatment with hydralazine. Prazosin induced a progressive decrease in left ventricular mass over time (-34 +/- 15 g/m2 at 12 months), but hydralazine did not (-9 +/- 10 g/m2 after 12 months). Stepwise regression indicated that a decrease in systolic blood pressure was associated with a decrease in left ventricular mass with both treatments, but an increase in plasma norepinephrine was associated with an increase in left ventricular mass only with hydralazine, suggesting that increased sympathetic activity may affect left ventricular mass via cardiac alpha1 receptors. Thus, if regression of left ventricular hypertrophy is a worthwhile therapeutic goal, hydralazine and analogous arterial vasodilators are not drugs of choice.", 
    "3": "The effect of adding either nifedipine or captopril as third-line agents was studied in a single-blind crossover fashion in 24 patients with essential hypertension uncontrolled by combination beta blocker and diuretic therapy. Nineteen patients completed both phases of the study. The mean initial sitting blood pressure before the addition of nifedipine was 164/109 mm Hg and captopril 165/108 mm Hg. Both nifedipine and captopril produced further significant reductions in both sitting and standing blood pressure, 47% of the captopril-treated patients achieving target blood pressure of less than 160/95 mm Hg compared with 67% with nifedipine. Further increase in the dosage resulted in 63% of the captopril- and 81% of the nifedipine-treated patients achieving target blood pressure. There were, however, no statistically significant differences in the mean fall in blood pressure or in the number of patients obtaining target pressure at the end of each treatment period. Captopril treatment also resulted in a small reduction of pulse rate, and, although pulse rates rose with nifedipine, these changes were not significant. Both treatments were generally well tolerated, and serious side effects were not reported. Both nifedipine and captopril were effective and well tolerated as third-line antihypertensive agents.", 
    "4": "Nicotine (20-60 micrograms/kg) produced an initial vasodepressor response followed by a vasopressor response in anaesthetized cats, the mechanism of which was investigated. The vasodepressor response was antagonized by atropine or by vagotomy and was potentiated by physostigmine or neostigmine. Nicotine increased the single unit activity of different peripheral sympathetic nerves and evoked contraction of nictitating membrane and spleen along with vasopressor response. The vasopressor response was antagonized by phentolamine, prazosin, guanethidine, bretylium, 6-OHDA, hemicholinium-3 or hexamethonium. Propranolol or atenolol pretreatment potentiated the vasodepressor response and was antagonized by atropine. Desensitization by salbutamol did not modify the response to nicotine. The biphasic response to nicotine remained unaltered in yohimbine pretreated, in adrenalectomized, and in acute spinal as well as in decapitated animals; intracarotid or intracerebroventricular administration of nicotine did not produce any response. The biphasic response to nicotine does not involve the stimulation of the central vasomotor centre. In conclusion, these results suggest that the vasodepressor response is due to the vagal cholinergic mechanism. The vasopressor response is a consequence of activation of different peripheral adrenergic nerves causing increased release of the adrenergic transmitter at the neuroeffector region and the alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediate vasoconstriction in the systemic vascular bed.", 
    "5": "Dopamine was shown to be effective in releasing glycerol and nonesterified fatty acid from brown fat adipocytes. The response was inhibited by dopamine-antagonists, and by a beta-blocker. This is further evidence that dopamine may be important in the release of energy from brown fat in newborn and cold-adapted animals.", 
    "6": "Activities of lysosomal and cytoplasmic cholesterol esterases and cholesterol content in rat blood serum, liver tissue and aorta were studied after administration of ephedrine and propranolol. The ephedrine-induced lipolytic effect was fully inhibited by propranolol. The correlation between stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors and activation of lipolytic enzymes was found.", 
    "7": "Acute hemodynamic changes induced by two beta-blocking agents, bunitrolol and propranolol, in patients with ischemic heart disease were studied. Besides possessing negative chronotropic and inotropic effects which were demonstrated by decreased heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI) and double product (DP) of the heart, propranolol significantly increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR, 12%, p less than 0.05) and the time constant of left ventricular (LV) isovolumic pressure fall (T, 10%, p less than 0.01). With bunitrolol, no significant changes were observed in indexes reflecting chronotropic and inotropic states of the heart, and CI and DP were essentially unchanged. Only LV systolic pressure (-5%, p less than 0.01), LV end-diastolic pressure (EDP, -17%, p less than 0.01) and T (-10%, p less than 0.05) decreased significantly. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased, though insignificantly. Myocardial oxygen supply-demand balance in the resting state was not improved by propranolol as evidenced by the fact that CI decreased in proportion to the decline in DP. In contrast, ischemia at rest was apparently improved by bunitrolol because LV wall stress decreased due to the reduction in LV volume which was suggested by the decline in LV systolic pressure and LVEDP while CI remained constant. Improvement of the time constant T might be strong evidence of relief from ischemia. Bunitrolol might be effective even in patients with overt heart failure, especially that due to ischemic heart disease because of its lack of negative inotropic action and its ameliorating effect on ischemia at rest.", 
    "8": "Betaxolol, a cardioselective beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, was used in a clinical trial in nine patients with glaucoma and chronic obstructive airways disease to assess its patient acceptance, and its effect on intraocular pressure, respiratory function, corneal and tear function. Betaxolol was well tolerated by all patients with no adverse symptoms. It significantly lowered intraocular pressure (p = 0.03) with no significant change in respiratory function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), mean mid expiratory flow rate (MMEFR) and vital capacity). Although there was a tendency to decreased wetting with Schirmer 1, decreased break-up time and increased corneal staining with Rose Bengal, this was not statistically significant in this small series. We confirmed the previously reported efficacy and safety of betaxolol in patients with glaucoma and airways disease with satisfactory patient acceptance.", 
    "9": "In own measurements octanol/buffer pH 7.4 partition coefficients of 10 different betablockers were determined and the clinical relevance of these data is discussed by using reference data.", 
    "10": "Primidone was compared to the unselective beta adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol in the suppression of essential tremor. In a 4-week single-blind placebo-controlled study primidone was given in increasing doses from 62.5 mg X 1 up to 250 mg X 3 daily and propranolol 20 mg X 3 daily. The drugs produced a similar reduction in the degree of tremor after 2 and 1 weeks' medication respectively. This indicates that primidone can be an alternative to propranolol when beta-blockers are contraindicated. However, primidone was significantly even more effective in the beginning after only 2 doses, when at the same time 10 of 13 patients showed a maximum of acute toxic side-effects producing nausea, vomiting, giddiness and/or sedation. Correlation analysis between the individual tremor amplitude reductions and plasma primidone concentrations showed on the second day a tendency towards a greater reduction in tremor in those patients with the highest primidone plasma concentration. By the fourteenth day tremor had increased compared with the second day and correlation analysis between individual increase in tremor amplitude and plasma phenobarbital concentrations showed the highest degree of tremor increase in those patients who had the highest levels of phenobarbital. These and other data suggest that after the first doses, tremor suppression and acute toxicity is related to the initial exposure to primidone and the plasma level of the drug itself rather than its metabolites phenobarbital and phenylethylmalanomide. The individual tremor frequency spectrums did not change significantly during the placebo and propranolol periods, whereas the frequency tended to decrease during the primidone period.", 
    "11": "The time course of the effects of isoprenaline (3 X 10(-7) mol/l) on contractile force and on the cyclic AMP level was studied in the electrically driven isolated muscle strip of the human right atrium. Isoprenaline produced a rise in cyclic AMP content (maximum increase after 60 s) preceding the increase in contractile force. The effects of isoprenaline on contractile force and on the intracellular level of cyclic AMP were enhanced in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor papaverine (10(-5) mol/l). On the other hand, the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (10(-7) mol/l) suppressed isoprenaline-induced cyclic AMP increases, but reduced the increase in force of contraction by only 35%. In addition, both the beta 1-selective antagonist bisoprolol (3 X 10(-9)-3 X 10(-8) mol/l) and the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 (3 X 10(-9)-3 X 10(-8) mol/l) inhibited the isoprenaline-induced cyclic AMP increase concentration-dependently; ICI 118,551 produced more pronounced inhibition than bisoprolol. It is concluded that cyclic AMP is involved in the positive inotropic action of isoprenaline evoked by beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation in isolated human right atrium; however, an additional cyclic AMP independent mechanism cannot be ruled out.", 
    "12": "A test for inhibition of mortality induced by intravenous injection of aconitine in rats is proposed as a particularly valid method, owing to its simplicity and degree of specificity, for inclusion among the preliminary screening tests for antiarrhythmic activity. LD50 (63.5 micrograms/kg, i.v.) and LD99 (118.9 micrograms/kg, i.v.) values of aconitine were determined. The dose employed for screening was 100 micrograms/kg i.v., which in control animals produced a death rate of 97.7% (293 deaths/300 treated animals). The protection produced by various drugs belonging to different groups of antiarrhythmics was studied. ED50s, expressed in mg/kg i.p., were as follows: Class I antiarrhythmics: flecainide, 5.5; E-4017, 30.0; lorcainide, 30.9; quinidine, 41.1; diphenylhydantoin, 42.3; lidocaine, 48.5; ajmaline: 53.9; procainamide, 61.3. Class II antiarrhythmics: pindolol 22.8; propranolol, 24.9; oxprenolol, 38.0; labetalol, 60.7; atenolol, 100.0; metoprolol, approximately 160; acebutalol, greater than 160; timolol, greater than 160. Class III antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, greater than 160. Class IV antiarrhythmics: verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine were inactive up to 40 mg/kg. The test would appear to be selective for membrane-stabilizing agents (class I) and beta-blockers (class II), but in view of the magnitudes of activity found, it should be used in combination with other antiarrhythmic tests.", 
    "13": "The two enantiomers ((R)- and (S)-) of propranolol glycol, a metabolite of propranolol, have been synthesized, and their effects upon the beta-adrenoceptor studied by two methods. The ability of these compounds to antagonize the inotropic actions of isoprenaline was examined on spontaneously beating rat atrial preparations. Also, the effects of these enantiomers upon the binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to beta-receptors in rat cardiac ventricular membranes was studied. Experiments with the atria indicated that the (S)-glycol was a reversible competitive antagonist of isoprenaline with a potency approximately one thousand times lower than that of (+/-)-propranolol. In contrast, the (R)-glycol appeared to act as an irreversible antagonist, producing complex dose-response curves. The effects of these compounds to cause displacement of alprenolol binding were consistent with the organ bath data. The interaction of the (S)-glycol with the beta-receptor binding site was reversible (Ki of 27.6 +/- 4.2 microM) but less potent than that of (+/-)-propranolol (Ki of 0.99 +/- 0.07 nM). On the other hand, pretreatment of ventricular membranes with the (R)-glycol, followed by extensive washing techniques, resulted in alprenolol binding which did not regain control values, providing further evidence for an irreversible effect upon the beta-receptor. The possible significance of these pharmacological actions of the two enantiomers is discussed in terms of the in vivo metabolic pathways for propranolol.", 
    "14": "It was shown that in dogs with experimental aphthous stomatitis (ligation of the common bile duct) tyrosine hydroxylase activity and content of catecholamines (CA) in the oral mucosa were increased. Blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors caused by anaprilin (1 mg/kg) led to the further increase of tyrosine hydroxylase activity. A relative decrease of CA content was simultaneously observed.", 
    "15": "Mixed function oxidases in liver microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-pretreated guinea pigs converted S-propranolol to 4-hydroxypropranolol, 5-hydroxypropranolol, and desisopropyl-propranolol. The addition of glutathione and cytosol from rat liver to the system resulted in the formation of a water-soluble metabolite. Evidence that the metabolite was a glutathione adduct was obtained by showing that treatment with gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase changed its HPLC retention time. The formation of the glutathione adduct required glutathione S-transferases in cytosol and was accompanied by a decrease in the formation of 5-hydroxypropranolol, but not of 4-hydroxypropranolol or desisopropylpropranolol. The formation of the propranolol-glutathione adduct was confirmed by two independent approaches. When [14C]glutathione and [3H]S-propranolol were used, the relationship between 14C and 3H in the metabolite indicated that it contained equal amounts of glutathione and propranolol. When a pseudoracemic mixture of S-propranolol and [2,4-2H2]R-propranolol was used, thermospray LC/MS analysis of the glutathione adduct revealed two peaks having different retention times. The first peak, representing a [2,4-2H2]R-propranolol-GSH adduct, gave fragment ions at m/z 294, 278, 262, while the second, which represented the S-propranolol-GSH adduct, gave fragment ions having 2 mass units less than those obtained with [2,4-2H2]R-propranolol. There was no evidence of any loss of deuterium during the formation of these fragment ions. The material in both peaks gave ions of m/z 308, 147, and 130, which is consistent with the presence of a glutathione group.", 
    "16": "The beta-adrenoceptor antagonists have been widely used clinically for over 20 years and their pharmacokinetics have been more thoroughly investigated than any other group of drugs. Their various lipid solubilities are associated with differences in absorption, distribution and excretion. All are adequately absorbed, and some like atenolol, sotalol and nadolol which are poorly lipid-soluble are excreted unchanged in the urine, accumulating in renal failure but cleared normally in liver disease. The more lipid-soluble drugs are subject to variable metabolism in the liver, which may be influenced by age, phenotype, environment, disease and other drugs, leading to more variable plasma concentrations. Their clearance is reduced in liver disease but is generally unchanged in renal dysfunction. All the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists reduce cardiac output and this may reduce hepatic clearance of highly extracted drugs. In addition, the metabolised drugs compete with other drugs for enzymatic biotransformation and the potential for interaction is great, but because of the high therapeutic index of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, any unexpected clinical effects are more likely to be due to changes in the kinetics of the other drug. Because satisfactory plasma concentration effect relationships have been difficult to establish for most clinical indications, and little dose-related toxicity is seen, plasma beta-adrenoceptor antagonist concentration measurement is usually unnecessary. The investigation of the clinical pharmacokinetics of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists has added greatly to our theoretical and practical knowledge of pharmacokinetics and made some contribution to their better clinical use.", 
    "17": "The effects of different drugs on the post-tetanic twitch responses of the prostatic end of the isolation rat vas deferens were examined. Following repetitive field stimulation (4-5 Hz for 40-60 s), the post-tetanic twitches (0.2-0.5 Hz) were depressed relative to the steady-state pretetanic twitches. Maximum post-tetanic twitch depression (PTD) occurred 15-30 s after the tetanic stimulation. The PTD was not reversed but deepened and prolonged by the presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists idazoxan (RX781094) or yohimbine (10(-7) M) alone or combined with the neuronal uptake blocker, desipramine (10(-6) M). The PTD was insensitive to the beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol (10(-6) M), the P1-purinoceptor antagonist, 8-phenyltheophylline (10(-5) M) or the prostaglandin E synthesis inhibitor, indomethacin (10(-6) M). Pre- and post-tetanic contractions to superfused noradrenaline (NA), adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), or beta, gamma-methylene ATP (beta, gamma-mATP) (bolus injections into superfusate, 1-8 X 10(-5) M) were not significantly (p less than 0.01) different. The PTD was absent in high magnesium (6.2-11.2 mM) solutions. These results are consistent with the PTD having an intrinsic presynaptic origin. They are discussed in relation to stimulation-induced modulation of transmitter release.", 
    "18": "The effect of octopamine on the neuromuscular junction of the mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) was examined. Octopamine potentiated excitatory junctional potentials (EJPs) recorded intracellularly and extracellularly from ventral longitudinal muscle fibers. The potentiating action of octopamine was blocked in the presence of the alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, phentolamine, but not in the presence of another alpha-blocker, phenoxybenzamine, or the beta-blockers propranolol and dichloroisoproterenol. The resting membrane potential, membrane input resistance, reversal potential of EJP, glutamate potentials, and spontaneous miniature EJPs were found to be unaffected by octopamine. In contrast, quantal contents estimated by the extracellularly recorded EJP failures were greatly increased by octopamine. These results suggest that octopamine acted on the presynaptic terminals via alpha-adrenoceptor-like receptors (octopamine receptors) at the Tenebrio neuromuscular junctions to enhance the transmitter release associated with the motor nerve impulses.", 
    "19": "When metoprolol in methanol was analysed by capillary gas chromatography (GC), an additional peak was observed; mass spectrometry (MS) showed this additional peak to have a molecular weight 12 dalton higher than that of the parent compound. A similar phenomenon was observed with other beta-adrenergic blocking aryloxypropanolamines in methanol or dichloromethane. Capillary GC-MS using deuterated solvents as isotopic markers showed that a methylene group from the solvents was incorporated into the parent molecule. The structure of the observed products and the mechanism of their formation are proposed.", 
    "20": "The effects of beta-blockade on tidal volume (VT), breath cycle timing, and respiratory drive were evaluated in 14 endurance-trained [maximum O2 uptake (VO2max) approximately 65 ml X kg-1 X min-1] and 14 untrained (VO2max approximately 50 ml X kg-1 X min-1) male subjects at 45, 60, and 75% of unblocked VO2max and at VO2max. Propranolol (PROP, 80 mg twice daily), atenolol (ATEN, 100 mg once a day) and placebo (PLAC) were administered in a randomized double-blind design. In both subject groups both drugs attenuated the increases in VT associated with increasing work rate. CO2 production (VCO2) was not changed by either drug during submaximal exercise but was reduced in both subject groups by both drugs during maximal exercise. The relationship between minute ventilation (VE) and VCO2 was unaltered by either drug in both subject groups due to increases in breathing frequency. In trained subjects VT was reduced during maximal exercise from 2.58 l/breath on PLAC to 2.21 l/breath on PROP and to 2.44 l/breath on ATEN. In untrained subjects VT at maximal exercise was reduced from 2.30 l/breath on PLAC to 1.99 on PROP and 2.12 on ATEN. These observations indicate that 1) since VE vs. VCO2 was not altered by beta-adrenergic blockade, the changes in VT and f did not result from a general blunting of the ventilatory response to exercise during beta-adrenergic blockade; and 2) blockade of beta 1- and beta 2-receptors with PROP caused larger reductions in VT compared with blockade of beta 1-receptors only (ATEN), suggesting that beta 2-mediated bronchodilation plays a role in the VT response to heavy exercise.", 
    "21": "Beta-blockers are often prescribed for patients who are asymptomatic and for whom the benefits of therapy are likely to be small. Side-effects are therefore of great importance. Symptoms such as muscle fatigue and peripheral coldness are commonly associated with treatment with beta-blockers but these subjective phenomena are difficult to detect and quantify so that their prevalence and severity are uncertain. Conventional symptom questionnaires may be relatively insensitive and visual analogue scales (VAS), which permit interval quantification of subjective phenomena, may have some advantages. They appear to be able to detect the presence of tiredness of the legs and peripheral coldness among hypertensive patients taking beta-blockers and are more sensitive than descriptive or 'category' questionnaires. However, some patients find VAS hard to understand and a minority of patients score erratically for all symptoms. A most detailed explanation is of paramount importance. Scores derived from VAS surveys are not normally distributed and should be examined using non-parametric statistical methods; normalising transformations do not improve the sensitivity of the method.", 
    "22": "The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity plays a key role in the release of adenosine from the ischemic myocardium. In 51 open-chest dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused through an extracorporeal bypass tube from the carotid artery, and adenosine release into the local coronary vein was measured by the radioimmunoassay technique following the reduction of perfusion pressure for 20 minutes under alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-adrenoceptor attenuations. Adenosine and lactate concentrations in the coronary arterial and venous blood sampled from the perfused area were determined, as well as fractional shortening. In the untreated condition, adenosine release was significantly (p less than 0.01) increased from 1.7 +/- 0.8 (SEM) to 8.8 +/- 1.3 nmol/100 g/min, 20 minutes after the onset of hypoperfusion (coronary blood flow: 28 +/- 2 ml/100 g/min) following the initial overshoot release. Neither beta- nor alpha 2-adrenoceptor attenuation affected the increase in adenosine release during hypoperfusion except for the slight attenuation of the overshoot release by beta-attenuation. In contrast, intracoronary infusions of prazosin and phentolamine during coronary hypoperfusion markedly attenuated (p less than 0.01) release of adenosine (1.8 +/- 0.7 nmol/100 g/min at 20 minutes). The extents of decreases in fractional shortening and lactate production were comparable between the untreated and alpha 1-adrenoceptor attenuation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "Previously unrecognised, nerve-mediated relaxation in pig and human detrusor muscle is described. The relaxation was mediated via non-cholinergic, non-adrenergic and non-prostaglandin transmitter or modulator systems and was present in 12 of 15 detrusor strips from six pigs and in four of 15 detrusor strips from seven patients. A contractile phase preceded relaxation in all strips; in contrast to the contractile phase, relaxation was augmented by an increase in basal tension in a complex way and possibly by the slowest stimulation frequencies.", 
    "24": "A comparative study in eight healthy normotensive males of the effects on blood pressure, heart rate and beta-adrenoceptor function following single oral doses of adimolol (600 mg), propranolol (240 mg) and placebo. Both active treatments produced small but significant reductions in blood pressure and heart rate, supine and erect. These effects persisted for up to 7 days after adimolol. The heart rate increases following both dynamic exercise and intravenous isoprenaline were attenuated by both propranolol and adimolol. With adimolol evidence of functional beta-adrenoceptor antagonism was sustained for up to 7 days. Lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor binding studies showed that both adimolol and propranolol significantly reduced affinity for beta-adrenoceptors. In addition, adimolol significantly reduced receptor number and even by 3 days after dosing Bmax had only returned to half the control value. In a small sub-group of subjects there was no evidence to suggest that adimolol had additional alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist properties. Adimolol was detected in plasma for up to 3 days after dosing. The mean terminal elimination half-life was 14 h, compared to 3 h for propranolol. This study confirms that adimolol has prolonged beta-adrenoceptor antagonist activity with effects persisting for up to 7 days after a single dose. The reduction in beta-adrenoceptor number following adimolol suggests that this prolonged effect may not be solely due to competitive antagonism but may additionally depend upon non-competitive antagonism at beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "25": "Duck isolated perfused pancreas was used to assess glucose, adrenergic mediated effects and pancreatic function interrelationships. A moderate physiological 50% increase in glucose level, corresponding closely to the difference observed between 24-h-fasted and fed animals, induced a significant decrease of pancreatic glucagon not due to a rise in somatostatin secretion. The great responsiveness of the A cell was still found after glucagon stimulation by catecholamines or beta adrenergic agonism. Insulin was irresponsive to the glucose load we used, suggesting that glucose-induced glucagon suppression was also insulin independent. As far as the D cell was concerned, glucose had no effect on pancreatic somatostatin output; however, an interesting finding was that beta adrenergic agonism has a permissive effect on D cell responsiveness to the nutriment.", 
    "26": "The influences of acute cerebral ischemia on renal hemodynamics were examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats in which cerebral ischemia was induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion. Renal and cerebral blood flow were measured with a hydrogen clearance technique. Either phenoxybenzamine (0.5 mg/kg body wt) or propranolol (2 mg/kg) was given i.v. immediately after ischemia was induced to examine the drugs' effects on cerebral and renal hemodynamics. One hour after ischemia, cerebral blood flow was markedly reduced to 5, 3, and almost 0% of the preischemic value in the untreated, phenoxybenzamine-treated, and propranolol-treated rats, respectively. In contrast, renal blood flow at that time was decreased to 65, 88, and 67%, respectively. The calculated renal vascular resistance was similarly increased to 151% in the untreated and 136% in the propranolol-treated rats, but decreased to 82% in the phenoxybenzamine-treated rats. The present results indicate that in acute cerebral ischemia renal blood flow was considerably decreased with concomitant increased renal vascular resistance, and that such reduction in renal blood flow was minimized by alpha-adrenergic blockade but not by beta-blockade. It is concluded that activation of the alpha-adrenergic system in acute cerebral ischemia causes renal vasoconstriction.", 
    "27": "Physical training using dynamic, nonisometric exercise can increase physical endurance and decrease cardiac work load of submaximal exertion. This is true for people with coronary artery disease and for normal individuals, and it may also be true for those with selected other cardiac diseases. Effective training should involve exercise at between 70 and 85 per cent of predicted maximal heart rate for 15 to 20 minutes or more at least three times a week. An exercise prescription should be written on the basis of individual patient needs and limitations and utilizing an exercise electrocardiogram test. Medically supervised exercise programs allow physical training for patients with heart disease to be conducted safely and efficiently. The effect of training in coronary disease patients is primarily attributable to increased efficiency of peripheral musculature and circulation; how much true cardiac adaptation results is variable. Training improves psychologic outlook, probably reduces selected risk factors for coronary disease, and may improve longevity.", 
    "28": "The basic components of aerobic exercise prescription include recommendations for optimal frequency, intensity, duration, mode, and progression of activity. The most effective program design involves the use of each of these components and incorporates specific coexistent medical problems and objective data derived from a multistage exercise tolerance test. In addition to the prescription of aerobic exercise, the use of circuit weight training and recreational activities has become accepted as an important part of a comprehensive exercise prescription. In effecting a well-designed and safe exercise program, the clinician must also be aware of environmental considerations and the effect of cardiac medications on the response to exercise.", 
    "29": "Isometric exercise produces a characteristic pressor increase in blood pressure which may be important in maintaining perfusion of muscle during sustained contraction. This response is mediated by combined central and peripheral afferent input to medullary cardiovascular centers. In normal individuals the increase in blood pressure is mediated by a rise in cardiac output with little or no change in systemic vascular resistance. However, the pressor response is also maintained during pharmacologic blockade or surgical denervation by increasing systemic vascular resistance. Left ventricular function is normally maintained or improves in normal subjects and cardiac patients with mild impairment of left ventricular contractility. Patients with poor left ventricular function may show deterioration during isometric exercise, although this pattern of response is difficult to predict from resting studies. Recent studies have shown that patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction can perform submaximum isometric exercise such as carrying weights in the range of 30 to 50 lb without difficulty or adverse responses. In addition, many patients who show ischemic ST depression or angina during dynamic exercise may have a reduced ischemic response during isometric or combined isometric and dynamic exercise. Isometric exercises are frequently encountered in activities of daily living and many occupational tasks. Cardiac patients should be gradually exposed to submaximum isometric training in supervised cardiac rehabilitation programs. Specific job tasks that require isometric or combined isometric and dynamic activities may be evaluated by work simulation studies. This approach to cardiac rehabilitation may facilitate patients who wish to return to a job requiring frequent isometric muscle contraction. Finally, there is a need for additional research on the long-term effects of isometric exercise training on left ventricular hypertrophy and performance. The vigorous training regimens currently utilized by international class and professional athletes should stimulate longitudinal studies of physiologic and pathophysiologic outcomes of intense isometric exercise training programs.", 
    "30": "A study involving 20 mongrel dogs tested the hypotheses that beta-adrenoceptor blockade or alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation may potentiate and prolong the increase in plasma potassium concentration after suxamethonium administration, and that the beta effect is beta 2-receptor mediated. Propranolol 0.5 mg kg-1 altered the time to peak increase in plasma concentration of potassium after suxamethonium, but did not increase peak concentrations. In controls, the maximum change (0.83 mmol litre-1) occurred at 3 min, while in propranolol-treated dogs the peak change (0.96 mmol litre-1 occurred at 30 min. Similar results were obtained when metoprolol 0.25 mg kg-1 and ICI 118551 0.1 mg kg-1 were used, respectively, as selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor blockers. The increases in potassium concentration following suxamethonium in the metoprolol group (0.98 mmol litre-1) and the ICI 118551 group (0.82 mmol litre-1) reached maximum concentrations at 30 min compared with the controls (0.79 mmol litre-1) which achieved a maximum at 3 min. Phenylephrine was infused at 8 micrograms kg-1 min-1 to produce alpha stimulation. The infusion alone altered plasma concentrations of potassium, but the haemodynamic changes were such that conclusions as to the effect of alpha-stimulation on release of potassium after suxamethonium could not be reached.", 
    "31": "The systemic and coronary hemodynamic effects of combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade produced by labetalol were assessed in 12 normotensive patients with angina pectoris and an ischemic electrocardiographic response to exercise stress. When given to the patient at rest, labetalol (0.5 mg/kg intravenously) produced systemic and coronary vasodilation (mean 16% and 13%, respectively, both p less than 0.05); aortic pressure decreased, cardiac output increased and coronary flow and heart rate did not change. Before labetalol treatment, supine bicycle exercise produced angina in all patients. After treatment, exercise duration was prolonged in 8 patients (average 33%). At the same duration of exercise that led to angina during the control period, ST depression in lead V5 was less after labetalol (from 1.2 to 0.4 mm, p less than 0.5). During exercise, tachycardia was blunted (-12%, p less than 0.05) as were the increases in aortic pressure (-12%, p less than 0.05), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (-7%, difference not significant) and coronary sinus flow (-16%, p less than 0.05). Cardiac output and systemic and coronary vascular resistance were similar to values during control exercise. The hemodynamic effects of labetalol appeared to be beneficial and differed from those of classic beta-adrenergic blocking agents.", 
    "32": "The beta blockers exhibit clinically significant differences in beta-receptor selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and alpha-adrenergic blocking activity. These agents also show important differences in their pharmacokinetic profiles, including gastrointestinal absorption, first-pass hepatic metabolism, lipid solubility, protein binding, hepatic biotransformation, pharmacologic activity of metabolites, and renal clearance of unchanged drug and metabolites. These many differences determine the appropriateness of administering a given beta blocker in a given clinical situation. The selection of beta blockers must also take into account concurrent therapy with other agents. Concurrent administration of beta blockers with drugs that alter gastric, hepatic, or renal function may affect blood levels, duration of action, or efficacy of beta-blocker action. The beta blockers vary in the extent to which their action is altered when they are given with other agents, and therapeutic substitution may produce unwanted side effects and toxicity. Elderly patients should be carefully monitored following interchange among beta blockers, since the probability of drug interaction, impact of adverse effects, unpredictability of response, and physiologic variability of renal and liver function is greater than for younger individuals. Therapeutic substitution among beta blockers in patients already stabilized on a given agent will require careful monitoring. Retitration with the new beta blocker will be required in many cases to assure therapeutic equivalence. Beta blockers are currently used for over 20 medical conditions. There is wide variation in the strength of the clinical evidence supporting the use and efficacy of specific beta blockers for specific conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "The influence of selective beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation and blockade on cardiac electrophysiologic properties was studied in 18 anesthetized dogs. Selective beta 2-adrenoceptor activation by salbutamol failed to alter myocardia excitability but significantly lowered serum potassium concentration. Excitability, refractoriness, and ventricular fibrillation threshold were also not changed after administration of 100 and 200 micrograms/kg of the selective beta 2-antagonist ICI 118,551. However, at a dose of 500 micrograms/kg, refractoriness was prolonged and ventricular fibrillation threshold increased. These changes appear to be due to blockade of beta 1-adrenoceptors rather than to membrane stabilizing effects, since in catecholamine-depleted animals even the highest dose of ICI 118,551 did not alter myocardial electrical properties. It is concluded that beta 2-adrenoceptors do not influence electrophysiologic properties of the canine myocardium.", 
    "34": "A rapid and sensitive competitive receptor binding assay for beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic binding for adrenergic agents has been developed. The steps that are critical for the success of the assay are given in detail so that the assay can be set up in any routine laboratory with relative ease. The rationale behind the use of specific reagents is discussed. The assay requires microgram quantities of test compound, a radiolabeled specific beta adrenergic antagonist [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA), and turkey erythrocyte beta-1 and rat erythrocyte beta-2 receptor membranes. Serial dilutions of sample are incubated with appropriate receptor membranes and DHA for 1 hr at room temperature. After equilibrium is attained, the bound radioligand is separated by rapid filtration under vacuum through Whatman GF/B filters. The amount of bound DHA trapped on the filter is inversely proportional to the degree of beta-1 or beta-2 adrenergic binding of the sample. Separation of bound from free radioligand by filtration permits rapid determination of a large number of samples. This assay quantitates and differentiates beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic binding of synthetic adrenergic agents.", 
    "35": "The synthesis of a series of (3-phenylflavonoxy)propanolamines is described. These compounds were evaluated for potential antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats, as well as for in vivo and in vitro evidence of beta-adrenoceptor antagonism. Some of the compounds of this series exhibited effective antihypertensive properties but did not antagonize beta-adrenergic receptors. These active compounds represent a unique series of effective antihypertensive agents that, despite possessing structural characteristics typical of beta-blockers, does not have beta-adrenergic receptor blocking activity.", 
    "36": "The antiarrhythmic and antifibrillatory actions of dilevalol, the R,R-isomer of labetalol, were evaluated in conscious dogs 4 to 6 days after anterior myocardial infarction. The administration of dilevalol in a lower dose of 0.3 mg/kg i.v. q 8 hr or a higher dose of 3.0 mg/kg i.v. q 8 hr over a period of 24 hr failed to alter electrophysiologic parameters or significantly suppress the induction of ventricular tachycardia by programmed ventricular stimulation (incidence of ventricular tachycardia suppression: 4 of 25 [16%] dilevalol vs. 1 of 14 [7%] vehicle). Pretreatment with dilevalol failed to reduce arrhythmic death in response to the subsequent development of ischemia at a site distant to the area of previous infarction (mortality: 8 of 10 [80%] dilevalol vs. 14 of 14 [100%] vehicle), but did alter the nature of the lethal ischemic arrhythmia from ventricular fibrillation (incidence of ventricular fibrillation: 14 of 14 [100%] vehicle vs. 2 of 8 [25%] dilevalol, P less than .05) to bradyarrhythmia with eventual sinoatrial arrest (6 of 8 [75%] dilevalol). The administration of methylscopolamine, 0.01 mg/kg both i.v. and i.m., to postinfarction animals pretreated with dilevalol, 3.0 mg/kg i.v. q 8 hr for 24 hr, reduced significantly mortality in response to subsequent posterolateral ischemia (mortality: 4 of 10 [40%] dilevalol plus methylscopolamine vs. 14 of 14 [100%] vehicle, P less than .05). However, methylscopolamine alone failed to suppress the development of ischemic ventricular fibrillation in 5 of 6 (83%) postinfarction dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "Accumulation of basic drugs by pulmonary tissue is well known. The cationic amphiphilic nature of many of these compounds suggests that they may be sequestered within an acidic and/or phospholipid-rich compartment. We described previously receptor-independent, concentrative, temperature- and pH-dependent sequestration of the beta adrenergic antagonists [125I]iodocyanopindolol and [125I]iodopindolol by intact rat type II pneumocytes in primary culture. The present study reveals that type II pneumocytes sequester [125I]iodocyanopindolol to an extent greater than other cell types (type II cells greater than polymorphonuclear leukocytes greater than S49) within 80-min incubations. Localization of fluorescence into large granular structures was observed after incubation of type II cells with 9-aminoacridine-propranolol (9-AAP). The distribution of fluorescence coincides with surfactant-containing lamellar bodies (LB) visualized with tannic acid/osmium staining. The large granule localization of 9-AAP fluorescence decreases with time in primary culture in parallel with changes in cell morphology and decreased numbers of LB. Comparison of patterns of fluorescence after incubation with 9-AAP, acridine orange and 9-aminoacridine (all 1 microM) indicates that localization is not a property of the acridine moiety, but requires the propranolol side-chain. Association of 9-AAP fluorescence with LB is inhibited completely by chlorpromazine (10 microM); the same concentration of propranolol or chlorquine produces less extensive, but detectable, inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "Binding of beta adrenergic receptors (BAR) in membranes of freshly isolated type II pulmonary epithelial cells to the radioligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol was saturable, steresospecific and of high affinity. Optimal conditions for the assay of BAR on type II pneumocyte membranes are presented. Type II pneumocyte BAR are primarily of the beta-2 subtype, as indicated by inhibition of subtype-specific antagonists, ICI 118,551 and betaxolol. Maximum binding and Kd were measured (Kd, 4-20 pM; maximum binding, 30-50 fmol/mg of protein) and used to identify factors which alter BAR. The number of BAR on type II pneumocytes doubled after 42-hr culture in the presence of dexamethasone. Ligand-receptor interactions were of similar affinity to those in membrane particulates from whole lung, but maximum binding was reduced 3- to 4-fold. Less than 5% of total pulmonary BAR can be accounted for by those expressed on freshly isolated type II pneumocyte membranes. Other cell types thus probably account for the majority of specific beta adrenergic binding sites in the lung as a whole.", 
    "39": "Research studies and general literature support the careful use of neuroleptics for control of agitation-related symptoms in the elderly if the symptoms are severe enough to disrupt normal functioning. No one neuroleptic has been found to be more effective than others; medication choice should therefore be based on differential toxicity rather than differential therapeutic efficacy. The differences in frequency and intensity of neuroleptic side effects are discussed, and the use of nonneuroleptic agents, including beta blockers, in the treatment of agitation is considered.", 
    "40": "Pharmacokinetics of the benzodiazepine bromazepam were evaluated in volunteer subjects who received single 6 mg oral doses followed by blood sampling during the next 48 hours. Age and gender effects were studied in 32 subjects, divided into young (aged 21 to 29 years) and elderly (aged 60 to 81 years) groups. Compared with young subjects, the elderly had significantly higher peak serum bromazepam concentrations (132 vs. 82 ng/ml), smaller volume of distribution (0.88 vs. 1.44 L/kg), lower oral clearance (0.41 vs. 0.76 ml/min/kg), and increased serum free fraction (34.8% vs. 28.8% unbound). However, gender had no significant influence on bromazepam kinetics. In 11 young female users of oral contraceptive steroids, compared with seven age- and weight-matched control women not using oral contraceptives, no differences in bromazepam kinetics were observed. Coadministration of cimetidine (1.2 gm daily) significantly reduced bromazepam clearance (0.41 vs. 0.82 ml/min/kg) and prolonged elimination half-life (29 vs. 23 hours). Propranolol (160 mg daily) significantly prolonged bromazepam half-life (28 vs. 23 hours), but the reduction in clearance associated with propranolol (0.65 vs. 0.82 ml/min/kg) did not reach significance. Bromazepam has the pharmacokinetic characteristics of benzodiazepines with half-life values between 20 and 30 hours. Consistent with its biotransformation pathway by hepatic microsomal oxidation, bromazepam clearance is significantly impaired in elderly individuals, by coadministration of cimetidine and possibly propranolol.", 
    "41": "Support for the concept that neurohormonal mechanisms play an important role in determining the survival of patients with severe chronic heart failure is derived from two lines of evidence: circulating levels of neurohormones are markedly elevated in patients who have a poor long-term prognosis and the survival of high-risk patients may be favorably modified by treatment with specific neurohormonal antagonists. Plasma norepinephrine is a major prognostic factor in patients with severe chronic heart failure, the most markedly elevated levels being observed in patients with the most unfavorable long-term prognosis. Data from uncontrolled studies suggest that low-dose beta-blockade may improve the survival of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Similar trends were noted in the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, in which patients with congestive heart failure before or accompanying their acute myocardial infarction experienced a significant reduction in sudden death when treated with beta-blockers. In contrast, there appeared to be little selective benefit in patients without heart failure, who presumably had low circulating levels of catecholamines. Similarly, serum sodium concentration is a major prognostic factor in patients with severe chronic heart failure, the shortest survival being observed in patients with the most severe hyponatremia. The poor long-term outcome of hyponatremic patients appears to be related to the marked elevation of plasma renin activity in these individuals, since (in retrospective studies) hyponatremic patients appeared to fare significantly better when treated with converting-enzyme inhibitors than when treated with vasodilator drugs that did not interfere with angiotensin II formation. In contrast, there appeared to be no selective benefit of converting-enzyme inhibition on the survival of patients with a normal serum sodium concentration, in whom plasma renin activity was low. These data suggest that neurohormonal systems may exert a deleterious effect on the survival of some patients with severe chronic heart failure, which may be favorably modified by long-term treatment with specific neurohormonal antagonists.", 
    "42": "Beta-blocker therapy is associated with an increase in the severity and, possibly, the incidence of acute anaphylaxis. The population at risk consists of people with allergic conditions who are given a beta-blocker for an unrelated condition. Anaphylaxis under these conditions may be severe, protracted and resistant to conventional treatment because of the beta-adrenergic blockade. Severe or fatal attacks have been triggered by insect stings, the ingestion of allergenic foods or drugs, and injections of radiocontrast media, antisera or immunotherapy antigens. These occurrences are probably infrequent, but their incidence is unknown. At least two fatal cases have recently occurred in Canada. Clinical allergists, internists and family practitioners in particular should be aware of the need for aggressive and prolonged support in patients who experience anaphylaxis while receiving beta-blocker therapy and should report all such occurrences to the federal registry of adverse drug reactions. Allergy skin testing or immunotherapy is inadvisable in patients who take a beta-blocker orally or in the form of ophthalmic eyedrops. The list of relative contraindications to beta-blocker use should be extended to include susceptibility to recurrent anaphylaxis, whether it is idiopathic or due to an identifiable cause.", 
    "43": "The changes of mean outflow resistance (MOR) (defined as the ratio between mean aortic ejection pressure and mean ejection rate) and of total peripheral resistance (TPR) together with their relations to some circulatory parameters and to each other were studied under control (NaCl) and six different loading conditions on anesthetized closed chest dogs. Phenylephrine increased both MOR and TPR (ca. 160%, max), pacing increased MOR (p less than 0.01) but not TPR. Isoproterenol and dextran infusion decreased TPR (p less than 0.001) but not MOR. Calcium chloride decreased MOR (p less than 0.05) but increased TPR (NS). The relationship between MOR and TPR was linear in each case (r from 0.63 to 0.91). Both MOR and TPR showed either positive or negative linear correlations with volume and pressure parameters although MOR appeared to be more sensitive to the administered interventions. The present results suggest that, when referring to the pulsatile and discrete nature of the blood-flow-pressure output from the left ventricle, MOR seems to be a more useful measure than TPR in the assessment of the left ventricular afterload.", 
    "44": "In 34 patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias the effect of the antiarrhythmic therapy of sotalol (160-320 mg p.o.) in combination with the type-I-B-agent mexiletine (600-800 mg p.o.) or tocainide (800-1200 mg p.o.) was studied by Holter monitoring. In all patients 2.2 +/- 1.1 drugs trials had failed, including amiodarone in 8 patients and beta blocking substances in 15 patients. The combination of sotalol with mexiletine or tocainide reduced ventricular ectopic beats by 79% and complex ventricular arrhythmias (pairs and salvoes) by 85%. A significant reduction of ventricular ectopic beats (greater than 80%) was reached in 74% of the patients, of pairs and salvoes (greater than 90%) in 79%. There was no difference in the antiarrhythmic efficacy between the combination of sotalol/mexiletine and sotalol/tocainide. Intervals of the resting ECG or laboratory values did not change significantly. In 5 patients with sotalol/tocainide and 1 patient with sotalol/mexiletine, side effects were observed which necessitated discontinuation of the treatment. The results show that sotalol, in combination with mexiletine or tocainide, has a potent antiarrhythmic effect in patients with otherwise drug-refractory ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "45": "Atrial fibrillation was induced during an electrophysiology study in 10 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, after determination of baseline properties of the accessory atrioventricular (AV) connection; intravenous propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) was then administered. Atrial fibrillation terminated during the drug infusion in three patients, allowing determination of propranolol's effects on conduction and refractoriness during sinus rhythm, before atrial fibrillation was reinduced. In these three patients propranolol had no effect on refractoriness or conduction properties of the accessory AV connection during sinus rhythm. The mean ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation was slowed by 15-56 beats/min in six patients, had no effect on the mean rate in three patients, and markedly increased the ventricular rate (203 to 267 beats/min) in one patient. In this patient, 54% of QRS complexes during atrial fibrillation were narrow, compared to 0-25% in the other patients. Propranolol reduced the percentage of QRS complexes that were narrow from 13 +/- 16% to 1 +/- 2% (mean +/- standard deviation, p less than 0.05). We conclude that propranolol may slow the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation in some patients with the WPW syndrome, probably by blocking the effects of adrenergic activation. However, propranolol should not be used in patients with the WPW syndrome who have atrial fibrillation, if most QRS complexes during atrial fibrillation are preexcited. When a large percentage of QRS complexes are narrow, propranolol may increase the ventricular rate, probably by eliminating concealed retrograde conduction in the accessory AV connection.", 
    "46": "Metoprolol and other beta-adrenergic blocking drugs are known to exert cardioprotective effects that include significant reduction in occurrence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) following myocardial ischemia and infarction. To help determine the mechanism of these cardioprotective effects, this study evaluated the effect of equipotent beta-blocking doses of metoprolol and three other beta-blockers with differing ancillary properties on ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) in the normal canine heart. Metoprolol tartrate (1.0 mg/kg i.v.), atenolol (0.3 mg/kg i.v.), propranolol hydrochloride (0.3 mg/kg i.v.), pindolol (0.03 mg/kg i.v.), or saline control (0.9% NaCl solution; vehicle) was given, alone and in combination with lidocaine (L), to groups of six pentobarbital (32.5 mg/kg i.v.) anesthetized mongrel dogs after control VFT and control isoproterenol-induced (ISO) positive chronotropic effects had been determined. The D- (membrane stabilizing, non-beta blocking) and L- (beta blocking) isomers of propranolol also were administered to separate groups of six anesthetized dogs in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg i.v. Blood samples (venous) were taken before drug or vehicle administration, 10 min after drug/vehicle administration and at half-hour intervals thereafter during experimentation. ISO responses and VFT were determined 5 and 15 min, respectively, after drug/vehicle administration and at half-hour intervals for a total experimental period of 165 min. VF was induced with a train of pulses (5 s, 100 Hz, 3-ms duration, 250-omega resistance) applied by bipolar platinum electrodes to a paced heart (200 beats/min). Voltage (V) was increased every 60 sec (0.25-V increments between 0-3.5 V and 0.5-V increments greater than 3.5 V) until VF occurred. Metoprolol increased VFT significantly (p less than 0.05) and maximally (max delta V = 2.3 +/- 0.7 V) at 135 min postdrug when the ISO-induced increase in heart rate was inhibited (%I ISO) by less than 53%. Max delta V was not significantly increased following i.v. administration of atenolol (0.8 +/- 0.6 V), pindolol (0.1 +/- 0.1 V), or saline (0.1 +/- 0.1 V). Max delta V was 0.5 +/- 0.2 in the D-propranolol-treated group and 0.5 +/- 0.3 in the L-propranolol-treated group. These values did not differ from max delta V obtained in the propranolol-treated group (0.6 +/- 0.4 V). Changes in VFT for all groups were, over time, negatively correlated with %I ISO and were not dependent on membrane stabilizing effect (metoprolol, propranolol (D,DL), pindolol), intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (pindolol), or cardioselectivity (metoprolol, atenolol).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "47": "In pentobarbital-chloralose-anaesthetized rats, pretreated with hexamethonium and atropine the mechanism by which substance P (SP) causes tachycardia was analysed. Substance P, when infused i.v. at doses between 0.49 nmol and 1.52 nmol elicited a marked, dose-dependent tachycardia, which was reduced to less than half by propranolol, 0.1 mg kg-1. Furthermore, the SP-induced tachycardia was reduced to about 1/10 of control by guanethidine. Further, the tachycardia, which could also be elicited in pithed rats, was antagonized by the SP-receptor blocker Spantide, but these results must be taken with care since Spantide itself caused a pronounced and long-lasting depressor response. It is hypothesized that SP causes tachycardia by exciting specific receptors on the stellate ganglia, which leads to an activation of adrenergic fibres to the sinus node.", 
    "48": "The effects of the thymic polypeptide thymopoietin (Tpo) on the properties of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AcChoR) were investigated by patch clamp techniques on mouse C2 myotubes and by biochemical assays on AcChoR-rich membrane fragments purified from the Torpedo marmorata electric organ. At high concentrations (greater than 100 nM), Tpo inhibits the binding of cholinergic agonists to the AcChoR in a Ca2+-insensitive manner. At lower concentrations (2 nM), Tpo applied on C2 myotubes simultaneously with nondesensitizing concentrations of acetylcholine results in the appearance of long closed times separating groups of openings. This effect depends on the presence of Ca2+ in the external medium. Outside-out recordings, performed with various concentrations of EGTA in the intracellular medium, suggest that Ca2+ acts on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane after entry through acetylcholine-activated channels. Parallel studies with T. marmorata AcChoR-rich membranes show that in the presence of Ca2+ Tpo causes a decrease in the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of the noncompetitive blocker [3H]phencyclidine, enhances, at low concentrations, the binding of [3H]acetylcholine, and also alters the binding kinetics of the fluorescent agonist 6-(5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonamido)-n-hexanoic acid beta-(N-trimethylammonium bromide) ethyl ester to the AcChoR. It was concluded that, in the presence of Ca2+, Tpo displaces the conformational equilibrium of the AcChoR towards a high-affinity desensitized state and increases the transition rate towards the same state.", 
    "49": "Arrhythmogenesis as an effect of antiarrhythmic therapy is a relatively recent concern. Satisfactory definitions are lacking, but 2 categories, clinical and technical, can be recognized. Although arrhythmogenesis is an international problem and multifactorial, its expression depends on variables that differ according to geographic location. In Europe, use of antiarrhythmic therapy is more conservative than it is in the U.S. In the U.S., many antiarrhythmic drugs commonly used in Europe are either recently released, are on limited release or are available only in investigational protocols. Mexiletine, class IC agents and sotalol are agents in routine use in Europe. All have arrhythmogenic potential, although this appears lowest with mexiletine.", 
    "50": "Unlike desipramine, a potent blocker of noradrenaline uptake, the antidepressant drugs, mianserin and citalopram did not, after chronic administration (28 days), attenuate the clonidine-induced inhibition of [3H]dopamine (DA) release from rat nucleus accumbens slices. Mianserin, like desipramine, failed to alter the isoproterenol-induced enhancement of [3H]DA release from rat nucleus accumbens and striatal slices. These findings suggest that antidepressant action does not necessarily involve desensitization of central alpha 2- or beta-adrenoceptors which influence neuronal transmission.", 
    "51": "In foregoing work, we found that the release of renin from rat kidney cortical slices was stimulated by the calmodulin antagonist W-7. The present work was done to determine whether W-7 would stimulate renin release in vivo. W-7 and its control agent, W-5 were directly infused into the renal artery of anesthetized rats. W-7 and W-5, at 50 micrograms/kg/min, produced no significant effects on renin release. Infusion of W-7 at 100 micrograms/kg/min resulted in a marked stimulation of renin release, but there was no significant alteration in the release when the same dose of W-5 was infused. Both compounds elicited a slight decrease in renal blood flow. The alterations in renin release and renal blood flow seen with W-7 were not affected by pretreatment with phentolamine or propranolol. As W-7 stimulates renin release in vivo, the hypothesis that Ca2+-calmodulin plays an inhibitory role in renin release from the kidney is given added support.", 
    "52": "Effects of catecholamines on immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor (I-CRF) release from the rat hypothalamus were examined using a rat hypothalamic perifusion system and a rat CRF RIA in vitro. Norepinephrine had a potent inhibitory effect on I-CRF release in a dose-dependent manner at 0.1 nM-1 microM concentrations, but dopamine did not. This inhibitory effect of norepinephrine was completely blocked by propranolol, but only partially blocked by phentolamine. Isoproterenol also had a potent inhibitory effect at 0.01-100 nM concentrations, and a high dose of phenylephrine (10 nM) inhibited I-CRF release. Clonidine did not influence I-CRF release. These results suggest that norepinephrine inhibits I-CRF release mainly through the beta-adrenergic receptor and partially through the alpha 1-receptor.", 
    "53": "Bromoacetylalprenololmenthane was found to inhibit hormone-induced beta-adrenergic receptor internalization in a dose-dependent fashion in S49 lymphoma cells, besides its known ability to bind to beta-receptors irreversibly. This new found property of BAAM+ was taken advantage of in studying whether receptor internalization is a necessary step in the desensitization of adenylate cyclase. BAAM-treated cells showed functional desensitization even when receptor internalization had been blocked substantially by 50-65%. This finding suggests that receptor internalization is not directly involved in desensitization.", 
    "54": "A new and sensitive method is described for the determination of the beta-receptor blocker Carazolol, 4-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropoxy)-carbazole, in different animal tissues. The procedure comprises extraction of Carazolol from tissue, clean-up by Kieselgel adsorption and high-performance liquid chromatographic separation with fluorimetric detection. The determination limit is 0.48 microgram/kg sample. The method has been verified by measuring Carazolol in liver, kidney and filet of a fattening pig treated with Carazolol before slaughtering.", 
    "55": "Psychological stress has been reported to be a risk factor for sudden cardiac death in individuals both with and without underlying structural heart disease. From a group of 80 patients presenting with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia, six were identified without underlying structural heart disease. Five of these six patients experienced marked psychological stress. Each of these five patients underwent arrhythmia evaluation, demonstrating recurrent rapid monomorphic ventricular tachycardia related to changes in tone of the sympathetic nervous system. Subsequently, solitary beta-adrenergic blocker therapy was given to each patient. During therapy, four of the five patients had a marked reduction of both arrhythmia and symptoms during a follow-up ranging from 29 to 49 (mean, 38) months.", 
    "56": "We conducted a multicenter, randomized, prospective study comparing medical therapy alone with coronary-artery bypass surgery plus medical therapy in 468 men with unstable angina pectoris. Patients were entered in the study from June 1, 1976, to June 30, 1982. Among those assigned to surgery who received bypass grafts, operative mortality was 4.1 percent. Arteriography performed after one year of follow-up revealed that 74.8 percent of the grafts studied were patent. The cumulative rate of crossover from medical to surgical therapy after two years was 34 percent; the operative mortality among patients crossed over was 10.3 percent. Nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred in 11.7 percent of the patients treated surgically and 12.2 percent of those treated medically (no significant difference). Most of the nonfatal myocardial infarctions in the surgical group occurred in the perioperative period. Overall, the two-year survival rate computed by life-table analysis did not differ between the two groups. However, the curves reflecting mortality as a function of left ventricular ejection fraction were significantly different (P = 0.03); surgery was associated with a significantly reduced mortality among patients with lower ejection fractions. We conclude that patients with unstable angina pectoris have a similar outcome after two years whether they receive medical therapy alone or coronary bypass surgery plus medical therapy. However, patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fractions may have a better two-year survival rate after coronary bypass surgery.", 
    "57": "We measured the change in intraocular pressure prospectively after extracapsular cataract extraction in 80 eyes after treatment with either pilocarpine gel, pilocarpine 4% solution, timolol 0.5% solution, or placebo. Intraocular pressure, pupil size, and anterior chamber cellular reaction were measured in a masked fashion on the first day after surgery. A significant increase in intraocular pressure was found in all groups postoperatively when compared with baseline values (P less than .001). Eyes treated with pilocarpine gel had an average intraocular pressure increase of 4.2 +/- 2.1 mm Hg (mean +/- 1 S.E.), eyes treated with pilocarpine 4% eyedrops had an average increase of 9.8 +/- 2.8 mm Hg, and eyes treated with timolol demonstrated an intraocular pressure increase of 8.25 +/- 3.19. The intraocular pressure in untreated eyes (controls) increased by an average of 12.9 +/- 2.7 mm Hg. Only the difference in intraocular pressure change between the eyes treated with pilocarpine gel and control eyes was statistically significant (P = .025). Postsurgical intraocular pressure exceeding 25 mm Hg was observed in three of 20 pilocarpine gel treated eyes (15%) and 11 of 20 control eyes (55%). Pilocarpine treatment was not associated with noticeable changes in intraocular inflammatory response, nor were significant ocular or systemic adverse reactions observed. A single administration of pilocarpine gel is effective in reducing increased intraocular pressure for the first 24 hours after extracapsular cataract extraction.", 
    "58": "Incubation of human mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) in vitro with isoproterenol resulted in a rapid loss of surface beta-adrenoceptors, determined by radioligand binding at 4 degrees. Isoproterenol concentrations in the range of 10 nM to 100 microM resulted in significant down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors. At a concentration of 1 microM isoproterenol, the time-dependent loss of surface beta-adrenoceptors closely paralleled the loss in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. If receptor number in intact cells was determined at 32 degrees, hardly any loss in receptor number was observed, due to reversal of down-regulation during the incubation period. When beta-adrenoceptor number in broken cell preparations was determined by [125I]cyanopindolol binding at 37 degrees no significant loss was observed, even after 2 hr of isoproterenol treatment, while [3H]CGP-12177 binding resulted in a similar reduction in binding sites as in intact cells. Reversal of loss in surface beta-adrenoceptors was rapid after 1 hr pretreatment with isoproterenol, but followed a biphasic time course after 4 hr pretreatment, with an initial rapid return of about 40% of the down-regulated receptors, followed by a slow, gradual reappearance of receptors. The results indicate that catecholamine exposure leads to a rapid sequestration of MNL surface beta-adrenoceptors away from the cell surface, to a compartment where they are inaccessible to the hydrophilic ligand [3H]CGP-12177 as well as to the lipophilic ligand [125I]cyanopindolol at 4 degrees. Up to 2 hr of isoproterenol treatment does not lead to any breakdown of sequestered beta-adrenoceptors, as they are still recognized by [125I]cyanopindolol binding in broken cell preparations.", 
    "59": "Including own results a survey is given of the side effects of beta-receptor blockers on the plasma lipoprotein metabolism. The formation of a from the coronary-preventive point of view unfavourable lipoprotein risk profile under influence of individual beta-receptor blockers, among others propranolol, seems to be connected with an inhibition of a key enzyme in the lipoprotein metabolism, the lecithin-cholesterol-acyl transferase. Talinolol does not show these side effects. It is recommended to control the triglyceride level and the HDL cholesterol before the induction and after the beginning of a therapy with beta-receptor blockers and to use talinolol instead of propranolol in pre-existing dyslipoproteinaemia or in unfavourable changes during the treatment.", 
    "60": "Beta-blockers are frequently administered in therapy of arterial hypertension and coronary heart disease. They mostly lead to an asymptomatic increase of peripheral and coronary resistance. Three patients in whom there were indications of a deterioration of myocardial blood flow under beta-blockade were observed within a few weeks. After discontinuation of the beta-blockers and instituting a therapy with calcium antagonists, both a reduction of ischemia in the exercise ECG and a reduction of symptoms could be observed. The possibility that beta-blockers trigger coronary spasms and thus give rise to unfavorable effects on myocardial blood flow must be considered in the context of therapy monitoring, especially in patients with coronary heart disease.", 
    "61": "CGS 12066B is a novel pyrroloquinoxaline with selectivity for the serotonin-1B (5HT1B) recognition site as assessed by binding, biochemical and electrophysiological studies. The compound had an IC50 value of 51 nM at the 5HT1B recognition site as determined using the binding of [3H]5HT in the presence of 1 microM spiperone. At the 5HT1A receptor the compound had an IC50 value of 876 nM, providing a 5HT1A/5HT1B ratio of 17 in contrast to the putative 5HT1B selective agent trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) which had a corresponding ratio of 3.6. The compound had minimal affinity for alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors and for dopamine D-1 and D-2 receptors. CGS 12066B, in contrast to TFMPP, which was inactive, was found to inhibit dorsal raphe cell firing with an ED50 value of 358 nmol/kg i.v. The corresponding values for the 5HT1A selective agonists 8-OH-DPAT and ipsapirone were 1.3 and 33 nmol/kg. CGS 12066B was also effective in decreasing rat brain 5-HTP concentrations and inhibiting in vitro 5HT release. The data obtained indicate that CGS 12066B is a reasonably active 5HT1B site agonist, which due to its selectivity as compared to compounds such as TFMPP, will be a useful tool for evaluating the physiological role of such receptors in the mammalian CNS.", 
    "62": "In Myxicola heavy water (D2O) does not alter Na+ gating currents, but slows activation and inactivation. In this study, the solvent formamide (5-20% v/v) is shown to proportionately and reversibly block Na+ currents and charge movement, suggesting it may be useful for fractionating gating currents. Formamide- and prepulse-sensitive (inactivating) gating currents were identical, comprising 60-80% of total charge. Both had rising phases and decayed as single exponential functions. Formamide-insensitive and non-inactivating charge movements had no rising phases and decayed slowly with more complex kinetics. Another solvent, dimethylsulfoxide (1% v/v), had no effect on Na+ activation or charge movement, though it did affect inactivation. Amantadine (0.1 mM) did not change Na+ activation or charge movement, but slowed inactivation and shifted the foot of the steady state Na+ inactivation curve. Sotalol (0.1 mM) slowed inactivation, but also inhibited Na+ activation and gating current.", 
    "63": "The three psychotropic cationic amphiphilic drugs, chlorpromazine, desmethylimipramine and propranolol were found to have biphasic effects on rat brain lysophospholipase A, stimulating the enzyme at low, and inhibiting it non-competitively at higher concentrations. Low concentrations (less than or equal to 50 microM) of the drugs prevented the formation of micelles of lysophosphatidylcholine, whereas high concentrations caused a phase transition of the substrate with formation of a highly ordered membranous lattice. A possible mechanism of stimulation and inhibition of the enzyme activity by cationic amphiphilic drugs is proposed. Stimulation is explained by a decrease in the concentration of substrate micelles, which are inhibitory for the activity, whereas inhibition may be caused by adsorption of the enzyme onto the membranous lattice formed by the substrate in the presence of high cationic amphiphilic drug concentrations.", 
    "64": "Numerous clinical studies have shown that propranolol administration causes hypertriglyceridemia and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein in man. Although these findings have been attributed to diminution of triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein catabolism by lipoprotein lipase, biochemical studies of the effects of propranolol on lipoprotein lipase activity in vitro have not been previously reported. We purified lipoprotein lipase from raw bovine skimmed milk and examined the effect of propranolol using as substrate phospholipid-stabilized, triolein emulsions containing purified human apolipoprotein C-II. These studies demonstrate that propranolol inhibits lipoprotein lipase activity. The inhibition was found to be noncompetitive with a Ki for propranolol of 0.55 mM. In addition, propranolol was shown to bind to phospholipid-stabilized triolein emulsions reaching local concentrations at the particle surface many times higher than its bulk concentration. Metoprolol, timolol and practolol, which are less hydrophobic than propranolol, were less inhibitory. Atenolol was the weakest inhibitor of purified bovine lipoprotein lipase in vitro.", 
    "65": "Esmolol is an investigational ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocker that has potential application in many clinical cardiology settings. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a bolus dose of esmolol on heart rate, blood pressure, and PR interval in healthy, exercising male subjects. We gave a single esmolol bolus over 30 seconds to 13 men who exercised to a predetermined target heart rate. Each subject performed the exercise protocol twice, receiving a different dose between 10 and 300 mg each time. An additional eight subjects received two esmolol boluses 5 minutes apart while performing the same exercise protocol. Esmolol doses of 180 mg or greater caused a 13% to 18% decrease in heart rate, an 11% to 18% decrease in blood pressure, and a 13% to 22% prolongation of the PR interval. The median time to peak esmolol effect was 1 minute for heart rate, 2 minutes for blood pressure, and 4 minutes for PR interval. The median time required to recover 50%, 75%, and 90% of the decrement in heart rate was 8, 10, and 13 minutes, respectively. The rapid onset and disappearance of esmolol effects may make it an appealing drug in acute care settings.", 
    "66": "The objective of this study was to determine whether changes in dietary protein and carbohydrate influence the oral clearance of propranolol, a high-clearance drug, and theophylline, a low-clearance drug. Six normal subjects studied in a clinical research center each received a single oral dose of propranolol, 80 mg, and theophylline, 5 mg/kg, after having been on each of two well-defined diets for a period of 10 days. When the diet was altered from high carbohydrate/low protein to low carbohydrate/high protein, the oral clearance of propranolol increased by 74% +/- 20% (mean +/- SE; range 9% to 156%; P less than 0.01) with no change in plasma half-life or plasma binding. This dietary change resulted in an increase in theophylline clearance of 32% +/- 6% (range 18% to 50%; P less than 0.02) and a corresponding decrease in plasma half-life of 26% +/- 6% (range 6% to 42%; P less than 0.05) with no alteration in the apparent volume of distribution. These observations reemphasize the importance of diet in drug disposition and suggest that the clearance of high-clearance drugs like propranolol is more susceptible than the clearance of low-clearance drugs to dietary manipulations, effects that may have to be considered in drug therapy.", 
    "67": "Latex-induced transmural myocardial infarction or epicardial application of phenol interrupts sympathetic fibers innervating myocardium apical to the infarction or to the phenol-painted area. These denervated regions subsequently show supersensitive shortening of effective refractory period (ERP) in response to the infusion of norepinephrine (denervation supersensitivity). The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that such denervation supersensitivity is arrhythmogenic. Ventricular arrhythmias were elicited by programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) during a control period, during bilateral stimulation of the ansae subclaviae (4 msec pulses, 4 Hz and 3 mA), and during the infusion of norepinephrine (0.5 microgram/kg/min). Study groups consisted of 14 sham-operated dogs, 16 dogs with phenol painted over a diagonal branch, 13 dogs with latex embolization of a diagonal branch that resulted in transmural myocardial infarction, 14 dogs with a one-stage ligation of a diagonal branch producing nontransmural myocardial infarction, and 12 dogs undergoing both phenol painting and one-stage ligation of a diagonal branch. Four to 22 days after the first operation, PVS was performed in anesthetized, open-chest dogs after neural decentralization of the heart. Dogs with phenol painting on the epicardium and dogs in which latex was injected into a diagonal branch showed supersensitive shortening of ERP to infused norepinephrine at apical sites. PVS resulted in ventricular fibrillation more often during stimulation of the ansae subclaviae (p less than .001) and infusion of norepinephrine (p less than .001) than during the control state in dogs treated with phenol alone. The incidence of ventricular fibrillation was highest in dogs with ligation-induced infarction that received phenol compared with all other groups during control (p less than .001), stimulation of the ansae subclaviae (p less than .002), and the infusion of norepinephrine (p less than .01). Propranolol (0.5 mg/kg or 10 mg iv at maximum) attenuated supersensitive shortening of ERP and decreased the incidence of induction of ventricular fibrillation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "68": "The relationship between debrisoquine metabolic phenotype and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propafenone was studied in 28 patients with chronic ventricular arrhythmias (22 extensive metabolizers [EMs] and six poor metabolizers [PMs] of debrisoquine). EMs were characterized by a shorter propafenone elimination half-life (5.5 +/- 2.1 vs 17.2 +/- 8.0, p less than .001), lower average plasma concentration (Cp) (1.1 +/- 0.6 vs 2.5 +/- 0.5 ng/ml/mg daily dosage, p less than .001), and higher oral clearance (1115 +/- 1238 vs 264 +/- 48 ml/min, p less than .001). The active metabolite 5-hydroxypropafenone, assayed in 12 patients, was identified in nine of 10 EMs but in neither of the PMs. A lower incidence of central nervous system side effects was noted in EMs (14% vs 67%, p less than .01). The magnitude of QRS widening at any given propafenone Cp was greater in EMs than PMs. There was no significant difference between EMs and PMs in effective propafenone dose or frequency of antiarrhythmic response. Inhibition of debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation by propafenone was demonstrated both in vivo and in a human liver microsomal system in vitro. We conclude that propafenone is metabolized via the same cytochrome P-450 responsible for debrisoquine's 4-hydroxylation, and that its pharmacokinetics and concentration-response relationships and the incidence of central nervous system side effects are different in patients of different debrisoquine metabolic phenotype.", 
    "69": "The prolonged QT interval and its association with diseases and drugs was studied on the basis of computerized electrocardiograms recorded in the region of the Kuopio University Central Hospital, East Finland. Altogether, 33,655 persons in whom at least 1 electrocardiogram was recorded from 1975 to 1983 were found. The study population consisted of 183 persons with prolonged QT intervals (at least 470 ms) and 187 with normal QTc intervals (440 ms or less), aged 45 to 64 years. These subjects were selected from 14,990 persons eligible. No difference in the prevalence of diseases affecting the QTc interval was found between those with long QTc intervals and those with normal QTc intervals. No difference between the groups was found in use of quinidine, procainamide or disopyramide. When the comparison was made on the basis of all group 1A antiarrhythmic drugs (quinidine, procainamide and disopyramide combined), persons with prolonged QTc intervals used these drugs more often than did those with normal QTc intervals (p = 0.031). Use of sotalol was significantly more common (p less than 0.001) in subjects with long QTc intervals. The mortality rate was also higher in persons with prolonged QTc interval (p less than 0.001), and most deaths during follow-up were due to coronary artery disease.", 
    "70": "Intravenous nicardipine, 5 mg, was infused over 5 minutes in 2 comparable groups of 8 patients with chronic coronary artery disease but no clinical signs of heart failure. Eight patients had received no previous treatment and served as a control group; 8 other patients had received long-term treatment with large doses of propranolol. The hemodynamic responses to nifedipine were similar in the 2 groups, but was greater in patients taking propranolol. At 10 minutes, systemic vascular resistance decreased by 47% in patients taking propranolol and by 39% in the control group; mean aortic pressures decreased by 25% and 10%; heart rate increased by 23% and 19%; and cardiac index increased by 45% in both groups. At 20 minutes, left ventricular end-systolic volume index decreased by 20% in patients taking propranolol and 15% in the control patients; angiographic stroke index increased by 19% and 8%; left ventricular ejection fraction increased by 22% and 11%; and mean circumferential fiber velocity increased by 46% and 32%. Intravenous nicardipine infusion (5 mg) did not induce negative inotropic effects in patients with chronic coronary heart disease, and no evidence of congestive heart failure was seen, even in patients receiving large doses of propranolol. Nicardipine counteracted the potential deleterious effects of propranolol; increased peripheral vascular resistance and left ventricular stroke work and decreased cardiac output.", 
    "71": "In a prospective study we compared propranolol, placebo, and self-hypnosis in the treatment of juvenile classic migraine. Children aged 6 to 12 years with classic migraine who had no previous specific treatment were randomized into propranolol (at 3 mg/kg/d) or placebo groups for a 3-month period and then crossed over for 3 months. After this 6-month period, each child was taught self-hypnosis and used it for 3 months. Twenty-eight patients completed the entire study. The mean number of headaches per child for 3 months during the placebo period was 13.3 compared with 14.9 during the propranolol period and 5.8 during the self-hypnosis period. Statistical analysis showed a significant association between decrease in headache frequency and self-hypnosis training (P = .045). There was no significant change in subjective or objective measures of headache severity with either therapy.", 
    "72": "The efficacy of verapamil in the conversion of 47 episodes of supraventricular tachycardia in 22 children was evaluated. The age of the patients ranged from 15 days to 10 years. Tachycardia was the main mode of presentation. Ten out of 22 children had viral infections. Two patients developed mild cardiac failure. Six patients had underlying cardiac abnormalities. Forty-four out of 47 episodes of supraventricular tachycardia were converted to sinus rhythm by a single dose of verapamil (0.11 +/- 0.08 mg/kg). No significant side-effects were observed. Intravenous verapamil is an effective and safe drug for the conversion of supraventricular tachycardia in children.", 
    "73": "Two patients developed profound hypotension approximately one hour after taking an initial oral dose of ketanserin 40 mg. The reaction appeared similar to that reported with prazosin, and may have been due to the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist action of ketanserin. Both patients were taking regular beta-blocker therapy, which may exacerbate such a reaction.", 
    "74": "Five patients with essential hypertension who were receiving treatment with the beta- and alpha-adrenoreceptor-blocking drug labetalol had elevated urinary excretion of catecholamines. When measured with a radioenzymatic assay, all five subjects had elevated urinary excretion of norepinephrine and normal urinary excretion of epinephrine; when measured with a fluorometric assay, four subjects had elevated urinary excretion of epinephrine with normal urinary excretion of norepinephrine, and one subject had elevated urinary norepinephrine excretion with normal urinary excretion of epinephrine. In three subjects who could be reevaluated three days to two months after labetalol therapy was discontinued, the urinary catecholamine levels had returned toward normal. Our studies indicate that labetalol produced a false elevation of urinary catecholamine levels. Although labetalol also interfered with the measurement of urinary excretion of metanephrine, it did not interfere with the measurement of urinary excretion of vanillylmandelic acid, homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and serotonin, and it probably did not interfere with the measurement of plasma concentrations of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. We conclude that labetalol therapy should be discontinued, and another beta-blocking drug, such as propranolol, that does not interfere with these tests should be temporarily substituted at least three days before a patient collects a 24-hour urine for measurement of the urinary excretion of catecholamines and metanephrine.", 
    "75": "The acute haemodynamic effects of taurine were studied in normal and in beta blocker (propranolol) or calcium antagonist (diltiazem) treated rabbits and in rabbits with experimentally produced chronic aortic regurgitation. The administration of taurine (25 mg.kg-1) did not affect heart rate and left ventricular end diastolic pressure but produced significant increases in left ventricular dP/dtmax, cardiac output, and left ventricular systolic pressure in control hearts, indicating that intravascularly administered taurine substantially increased cardiac performance. In propranolol (1 mg.kg-1) treated rabbits taurine significantly improved left ventricular dP/dtmax and cardiac output, which were previously depressed by propranolol. Taurine had the same effect on diltiazem (1 mg.kg-1) treated rabbits. In rabbits with aortic regurgitation a bolus injection of taurine improved cardiac performance. Continuous infusion of taurine (100 mg.h-1) also produced a significant increase in left ventricular dP/dtmax. These results suggest that taurine has a unique action as an inotropic agent and that it may be useful in the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "76": "In order to evaluate the use of Doppler echocardiography in the assessment of the haemodynamic effects of antihypertensive drugs, the acute haemodynamic response to felodipine and additional administration of metoprolol after 90 min was assessed in 10 hypertensive patients, by using both the Fick method and Doppler blood flow velocimetry in the ascending aorta. Intrabrachial artery pressure was significantly reduced by the treatment. Both the Fick and Doppler estimates of cardiac output (CO) rose significantly with felodipine and reached their highest values after 30 min, 45 +/- 8% (s.e.m.) and 58 +/- 7%, respectively. The felodipine-induced increase of heart rate (HR) persisted for 90 min, but the increase of stroke volume was only transient. Metoprolol brought CO and HR back to control levels. The felodipine- and metoprolol-induced changes of CO and stroke volume (SV) from control were on average not different between the observations with the Fick and the Doppler techniques throughout the study. As for the absolute values (control period), the Doppler measurement under-estimated SV (10 ml) and CO (1.1 l/min) in comparison with the Fick method, and the limits of agreement (mean difference +/- 2 s.d.) between both methods were 42 and -22 ml for stroke volume and 3.4 and -1.2 l/min for CO. In conclusion, despite the poor agreement in absolute results between the two methods, aortic Doppler velocimetry reflects the acute haemodynamic changes induced by felodipine and metoprolol in a group of hypertensive patients. The technique should facilitate the study of haemodynamic effects of drugs in man.", 
    "77": "The cardiovascular profile of 6-[4-(4'-pyridyl)aminophenyl]-4,5-dihydro-3(2H)-pyridazinone hydrochloride (MCI-154), a novel cardiotonic agent structurally different from cardiac glycosides and beta-adrenoceptor agonists, was investigated in vivo. In anesthetized, open-chest dogs, MCI-154 (0.3-100 micrograms/kg i.v., bolus injection) produced dose-dependent increases in dP/dtmax and cardiac output, and decreases in arterial blood pressure and total peripheral resistance with a relatively small increase in heart rate. The positive inotropic effect of MCI-154 was more potent than those of amrinone and milrinone. In anesthetized, intact-chest dogs, infusion of MCI-154 (0.3-3 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) also exerted a positive inotropic effect. P.o. administrations of MCI-154 (10-300 micrograms/kg) increased dP/dtmax in conscious beagle dogs. The cardiotonic effect of MCI-154 was not attenuated by blockade of autonomic receptors, catecholamine depletion and prostaglandin synthesis inhibition. MCI-154 (0.3-30 micrograms i.a.) produced a direct vasodilator effect in the canine hind-limb. MCI-154 (3 and 30 micrograms/kg i.v.) was effective in heart failure models induced with high doses of propranolol or verapamil. The potent cardiotonic and vasodilator activities of MCI-154 revealed by the present study suggest that this agent would be an effective remedy for the treatment of heart failure."
