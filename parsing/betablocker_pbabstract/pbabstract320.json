    "0": "The administration of an ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic antagonist, esmolol, has been introduced as a novel method for beating-heart surgery. In the present study, a new ultra-short-acting beta-blocker, ONO-1101, was administered during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to investigate its effects on cardiac function and hemodynamics. Nine adult mongrel dogs underwent 60 min of CPB during which they were given either ONO-1101 (ONO group; n = 4) or saline (control group; n = 5). In the ONO group, the hearts became flaccid enough for surgery to be performed without cardiac standstill within 10 min after the commencement of ONO-1101 with significant decreases in the heart rate, the preload recruitable stroke work (PRSW), and the slope of the end-systolic left ventricular pressure-volume relationship (Emax). The mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance also decreased, but were maintained above 50 mmHg during CPB without catecholamine. These indices increased to the control group level 20 min after the discontinuation of ONO-1101. The serum concentration of ONO-1101 decreased from the maximum level of 121 +/- 15 microg/ml soon after infusion to 11 +/- 5 microg/ml within 30 min after discontinuation. These data suggest that ONO-1101 may be useful to enable beating-heart surgery to be performed without aortic cross-clamp as an ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocker.", 
    "1": "Crude myocardial sarcolemmal membrane fractions were prepared from rat hearts subjected to total global ischemia with and without normoxic reperfusion, or global anoxic (N2) perfusion with and without normoxic reperfusion. The direct effects on beta-adrenoceptor number, G-protein levels and stimulation of the adenylate cyclase (AC) complex were assessed. In terms of AC activation, ischemia led to a marked increase (4-fold) in sensitivity to terbutaline (beta2-agonist) and phorbol ester (tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate = TPA) stimulation, whereas the dobutamine (beta1) responsiveness and Gpp(NH)p activation through G(s)alpha/G(i2)alpha remained unaltered. However, forskolin-elicited holoenzyme activity fell markedly during normoxic reperfusion. Ischemia did not change the beta1-adrenoceptor number, while beta2-receptor population increased by approximately 45%. Western blots of myocardial G(s)A and G(i2)alpha contents revealed that ischemia selectively diminished G(i2)alpha levels only by some 50-70%. Contrastingly, anoxia selectively increased the AC sensitivity (2-fold) to beta1-adrenergic stimulation. As subsequent to ischemia, anoxia also increased the sensitivity to TPA stimulation, however, only 2-fold. Gpp(NH)p activation was unchanged, while forskolin-enhanced activity gradually declined, also during ensuing normoxic reperfusion. Anoxia brought about a 75% enhancement in beta1-receptor number, while beta2-receptors remained unaffected. However, altered receptor number normalized on termination of normoxic reperfusion. Finally, anoxia led to a 50-60% decimation of myocardial G(i2)alpha levels, while G(s)alpha was only marginally reduced. Despite the fact that the ischemia and anoxia effectuated a similar deterioration of physiological heart parameters, myocardial contents of energy rich phosphate moieties and loss of G(i2)alpha, ischemia rendered the most profound increase in responsiveness of the sarcolemmal AC system.", 
    "2": "We measured free intralymphocyte magnesium (Mgi) in 10 hypertensive subjects (HS) before and after treatment with atenolol (A) and in 16 normotensive control subjects (NC). We also carried out in vitro studies on human lymphocytes to test the effect of catecholamines and beta-antagonists on Mgi. Mgi in HS was not statistically different before and after the treatment with A (M +/- SD, basal: 227 +/- 31 + mumol/l; A: 236 +/- 47 mumol/l; NS). Mgi in NC proved not statistically different as compared to HS without treatment (M +/- SD, NC: 232 +/- 35 mumol/l; HS before treatment: 227 +/- 31 mumol/l; NS). The Mgi of the lymphocytes treated in vitro with noradrenaline (NA) significantly decreased in comparison with the control (M +/- SD, basal: 244 +/- 26 mumol/l; NA: 198 +/- 25 mumol/l; p = 0.0001), whereas it did not change after incubation with NA and propranolol (P) (M +/- SD, basal: 238 +/- 32 mumol/l; NA + P: 239 +/- 30 mumol/l; NS). On the other hand Mgi decreased significantly after incubation with NA and A (M +/- SD, basal: 255 +/- 21 mumol/l; NA + A: 202 +/- 34 mumol/l). Our in vivo data show that the Mgi of HS remains unvaried after treatment with A, and that there is not statistical difference between Mgi of NC and of HS before treatment. The in vitro study demonstrated that catecholamines cause a significant reduction in Mgi. This effect is only inhibited by a non-selective beta-blocker such as P. These results seem to explain the ineffectiveness of treatment with atenolol on our patients' Mgi.", 
    "3": "The role of intracellular calcium stores in stimulus-secretion coupling in the pancreatic beta-cell is largely unknown. We report here that tetracaine stimulates insulin secretion from collagenase-isolated mouse islets of Langerhans in the absence of glucose or extracellular calcium. We also found that the anesthetic evokes a dose-dependent rise of the intracellular free-calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in cultured rat and mouse beta-cells. The tetracaine-specific [Ca2+]i rise also occurs in the absence of glucose, or in beta-cells depolarized by exposure to a Ca(2+)-deficient medium (< 1 microM) or elevated [K+]o. Furthermore, tetracaine (> or = 300 microM) depolarized the beta-cell membrane in mouse pancreatic islets, but inhibited Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in HIT cells, an insulin-secreting cell line. From these data we conclude that tetracaine-enhancement of insulin release occurs by mechanisms that are independent of Ca2+ entry across the cell membrane. The tetracaine-induced [Ca2+]i rise in cultured rat beta-cells and insulin secretion from mouse islets is insensitive to dantrolene (20 microM), a drug that inhibits Ca2+ release evoked by cholinergic agonists in the pancreatic beta-cell, and thapsigargin (3 microM), a blocker of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ pump. We conclude that the Ca2+ required for tetracaine-potentiated insulin secretion is released from intracellular Ca2+ stores other than the ER. Furthermore, tetracaine-induced Ca2+ release was unaffected by the mitochondrial electron transfer inhibitors NaN3 and rotenone. Taken together, these data show that a calcium source other than the ER and mitochondria can affect beta-cell insulin secretion.",

Although the former reflects baroreflex regulatory mechanisms, the physiological meaning of -PI/+SAP and +PI/-SAP is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that -PI/+SAP and +PI/-SAP \"nonbaroreflex\" sequences represent a phenomenon modulated by the autonomic nervous system reflecting a feed-forward mechanism of cardiovascular regulation.",

Nonbaroreflex sequences were defined as >/=3 beats in which SAP and PI of the following beat changed in the opposite direction. CAB reduced the number of nonbaroreflex sequences (19. 1+/-12.3 versus 88.7+/-36.6, P<0.05), as did SB (25.3+/-11.7 versus 84.6+/-23.9, P<0.001) and atropine (11.2+/-6.8 versus 94.1+/-32.4, P<0.05).

Mean total p-nitrophenol clearance was decreased in cirrhosis (healthy: 18.5+/-0.2 vs. cirrhotic 15.3+/-4.0 ml/min; p<0.05). The decrease in total clearance of p-nitrophenol was due solely to the decrease in sulphate formation clearance, which was significantly decreased (healthy: 14.1+/-1.9 vs. cirrhotic: 9.27+/-3.33 ml/min; p<0.05). Mean glucuronide formation clearance (healthy: 5.11+/-0.94 vs cirrhotic: 5.79+/-0.85 ml/ min; p>0.05) was not significantly altered.

Alone, ICI 118,551 did not effect HRV, but in combination blocked the actions of salbutamol. Scatterplot length (944 ms [869, 1019]) and area (222*10(3) ms2 [191, 253]) were reduced by salbutamol compared with placebo; (length difference (164 [98, 230]) and area difference 59 [36, 83]). Scatterplot width (dispersion) was lower at both low (width RR-1 25% salbutamol 277 ms [261, 293]: salbutamol minus placebo 14 ms [0, 28]) and high (width 75% salbutamol 417 [391, 443]: salbutamol minus placebo 41 [20, 62]) heart rates. ICI 118,551 alone did not alter scatterplot parameters but in combination blocked the effect of salbutamol. Cardiac acceleration episodes (i.e. consecutive deltaRR and deltaRRn+1 shorten) were increased following salbutamol 7288 [6089, 8486] compared with placebo -1890 [-2600, -1179]; the beat-to beat difference (deltaRRn+1) was reduced after salbutamol compared with the other treatments.

However antagonism at the beta2-adrenoceptor with ICI 118,551 alone did not significantly alter the HRV. The beta2-adrenoceptor modulates HRV in healthy volunteers; the implications of agonism and antagonism at the beta2-adrenoceptor in cardiovascular disease states warrants further investigation.",

    "24": "In this study, we examine the cost effectiveness of carvedilol for the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF). We use a Markov model to project life expectancy and lifetime medical care costs for a hypothetical cohort of patients with CHF who were assumed alternatively to receive carvedilol plus conventional therapy (digoxin, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) or conventional therapy alone. Patients on carvedilol were assumed to experience a reduced risk of death and hospitalization for CHF, which is consistent with findings from the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program. The benefits of carvedilol were projected under 2 alternative scenarios. In the first (\"limited benefits\"), benefits were conservatively assumed to persist for 6 months, the average duration of follow-up in these clinical trials, and then end abruptly. In the other (\"extended benefits\"), they were arbitrarily assumed to persist for 6 months and then decline gradually over time, vanishing by the end of 3 years. We estimated our model using data from the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program and other sources. For patients receiving conventional therapy alone, estimated life expectancy was 6.67 years; corresponding figures for those also receiving carvedilol were 6.98 and 7.62 years under the limited and extended benefits scenarios, respectively. Expected lifetime costs of CHF-related care were estimated to be $28,756 for conventional therapy, and $36,420 and $38,867 for carvedilol (limited and extended benefits, respectively). Cost per life-year saved for carvedilol was $29,477 and $12,799 under limited and extended benefits assumptions, respectively. The cost effectiveness of carvedilol for CHF compares favorably to that of other generally accepted medical interventions, even under conservative assumptions regarding the duration of therapeutic benefit.", 
    "25": "Earlier studies have shown that cardiovascular autonomic regulation is impaired in untreated or poorly controlled systemic hypertension. The purpose of this double-blind, randomized parallel trial was to evaluate whether improved blood pressure (BP) control can reverse this impairment. The study group consisted of 33 patients (age 45 to 63 years) with poor BP control who received randomized metoprolol or enalapril monotherapy. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was assessed by phenylephrine test and time- and frequency-domain measurements of heart rate variability (HRV) were analyzed from 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings during monotherapy and after 10 weeks of combination therapy with metoprolol + felodipine or enalaril + hydrochlorothiazide to lower casual BP to < 140/90 mm Hg. Intensified treatment decreased 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP from 139 +/- 12/86 +/- 8 mm Hg to 126 +/- 8/80 +/- 7 mm Hg (p <0.0001). BRS improved from 6.2 +/- 3.2 ms/mm Hg to 8.9 +/- 4.1 ms/mm Hg (p <0.0001) and measurements of HRV (e.g., SD of all RR intervals from 128 +/- 45 ms to 145 +/- 46 ms, p <0.001) improved significantly during the combination therapy. Changes in BRS and HRV were similar in magnitude in both treatment arms. Mean RR intervals were comparable before and after intensive antihypertensive therapy (850 +/- 124 ms vs 937 +/- 279 ms, p = NS). These data indicate that adequate BP control with modem antihypertensive combination therapy can improve cardiovascular autonomic function, which may partially explain the reduced cardiac mortality observed in patients with intensified antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "26": "The Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome is an autosomal recessive trait characterized by deafness and electrocardiographic changes. These changes include prolongation of the QT interval and T-wave inversion. Treatment may include the use of beta-blockers to prevent the development of malignant ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. We report a patient with this syndrome, who was receiving propranolol orally and who became hypoglycaemic during the preoperative fasting period prior to cochlear implantation.", 
    "27": "Beta-Blockers reduce mortality in patients with congestive heart failure and a proposed mechanism has been changes of autonomic tone. Heart rate variability is a non-invasive tool to estimate cardiac autonomic tone. The aim was to study changes of heart rate variability in patients with congestive heart failure on placebo, on the beta1-selective antagonist metoprolol or 24 h after metoprolol withdrawal. Forty-five patients with congestive heart failure were studied with Holter recordings. Heart rate variability measurements were performed before, after 6-12 months of treatment with 150 mg metoprolol/placebo, or 24 h after discontinued metoprolol. After treatment, patients on beta-blockade had a significantly longer mean RR interval and changes of heart rate variability, suggesting elevated vagal tone. Patients monitored in the rebound phase of beta-blocker withdrawal had a significant vagal reduction to the level of the placebo group. There was also a nonsignificant trend towards increased sympathetic tone (LF/HF over 24 h), compared with the beta-blockade group. Heart rate variability indicates an elevated vagal tone during treatment with metoprolol but beta-blockade withdrawal shifts the autonomic balance towards lower vagal and higher sympathetic tone within 24 h. These results could imply a potential risk when abruptly discontinuing beta-blockade medication in these patients.", 
    "28": "Nitric oxide (NO) is continuously produced in the lung and is present in exhaled air. We examined the effect of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation on the production of pulmonary NO in rabbits. Exhaled NO was measured by chemiluminescence in anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated rabbits and in buffer-perfused rabbit lungs. Intravenous infusions of adrenaline (0.1-10 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) elicited dose-dependent increases in exhaled NO. The increases in exhaled NO comprised an initial peak followed by a lower plateau level. The increase in exhaled NO was inhibited by propranolol (1 mg kg(-1)) but not by phentolamine (1 mg kg(-1)). Prenalterol, a beta1-adrenoceptor agonist, and terbutaline, a beta2-adrenoceptor agonist, also caused dose-dependent increases in exhaled NO. However, prenalterol was >100 times more potent than terbutaline. Infusions of forskolin (0.01-0.03 micromol kg(-1) min(-1)), an adenylate cyclase stimulator, elicited dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and concomitant increases in heart rate but caused no alterations in exhaled NO. Nimodipine, a L-type calcium channel blocker, antagonized the increases in exhaled NO in response to prenalterol infusions. The increases in exhaled NO in response to adrenaline and prenalterol were also present in blood-free, buffer perfused lungs during constant-flow conditions. These results demonstrate that pulmonary nitric oxide production can be enhanced by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. Furthermore, the results indicate that the beta-adrenergic stimulation of pulmonary NO production is not critically dependent on cyclic AMP formation but may require intact calcium-channels.", 
    "29": "The possible existence of a beta3-adrenergic receptor (beta3-AR) in the human detrusor muscle was investigated by in vitro functional studies and analysis of mRNA expression. Isoprenaline, noradrenaline and adrenaline each produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of the human detrusor. The rank order for their relaxing potencies was isoprenaline (pD2 6.37+/-0.07) > or = noradrenaline (pD2 6.07+/-0.12) > or = adrenaline (pD2 5.88< or =0.11). Neither dobutamine (beta1- and beta2-AR agonist) nor procaterol (beta2-AR agonist) produced any significant relaxation at concentrations up to 10(-5) M. BRL37344A, CL316243 and CGP-12177A (beta3-AR agonists), relaxed the preparations significantly at concentrations higher than 10(-6) M. The pD2 values for BRL37344A, CL316243 and CGP-12177A were 6.42+/-0.25, 5.53+/-0.09 and 5.74+/-0.14, respectively. CGP-20712A (10(-7) - 10(-5) M), a beta1-AR antagonist, did not affect the isoprenaline-induced relaxation. On the other hand, ICI-118,551, a beta2-AR antagonist, produced a rightward parallel shift of the concentration-relaxation curve for isoprenaline only at the highest concentration used (10(-5) > M) and its pKB value was 5.71+/-0.19. Moreover, SR58894A (10(-7) - 10(-5) M), a beta3-AR antagonist, caused a rightward shift of the concentration-relaxation curve for isoprenaline in a concentration-dependent manner. The pA2 value and slope obtained from Schild plots were 6.24+/-0.20 and 0.68+/-0.31. The beta1-, beta2- and beta3-AR mRNAs were all positively expressed in detrusor smooth muscle preparations in a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. In conclusion, the present results provide the first evidence for the existence of the beta3-AR subtype in the human detrusor. They also suggest that the relaxation induced by adrenergic stimulation of the human detrusor is mediated mainly through beta3-AR activation.", 
    "30": "The effects of BK agonists and antagonists, and other hyperalgesic/antihyperalgesic drugs were measured (3 h after injection of hyperalgesic drugs) in a model of mechanical hyperalgesia (the end-point of which was indicated by a brief apnoea, the retraction of the head and forepaws, and muscular tremor). DALBK inhibited responses to carrageenin, bradykinin, DABK, and kallidin. Responses to kallidin and DABK were inhibited by indomethacin or atenolol and abolished by the combination of indomethacin + atenolol. DALBK or HOE 140, given 30 min before, but not 2 h after, carrageenin, BK, DABK and kallidin reduced hyperalgesic responses to these agents. A small dose of DABK+ a small dose of BK evoked a response similar to the response to a much larger dose of DABK or BK, given alone. Responses to BK were antagonized by HOE 140 whereas DALBK antagonized only responses to larger doses of BK. The combination of a small dose of DALBK with a small dose of HOE 140 abolished the response to BK. The hyperalgesic response to LPS (1 microg) was inhibited by DALBK or HOE 140 and abolished by DALBK + HOE 140. The hyperalgesic response to LPS (5 microg) was not antagonized by DALBK + HOE 140. These data suggest: (a) a predominant role for B2 receptors in mediating hyperalgesic responses to BK and to drugs that stimulate BK release, and (b) activation of the hyperalgesic cytokine cascade independently of both B1 and B2 receptors if the hyperalgesic stimulus is of sufficient magnitude.", 
    "31": "Imdur (IMD) is a sustained-release isosorbide 5-mononitrate preparation for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris. Controlled medication release is achieved using the Durules principle of insoluble matrix embedding. Data from randomised double-blind trials show that IMD 60 mg once daily (the most widely studied dosage) has significant antianginal and anti-ischaemic effects compared with placebo after 2 weeks' treatment. Efficacy was generally observed approximately 1 to 12 hours after administration, indicating that once-daily administration in the morning will provide effective prophylaxis of symptoms throughout the day. Improvements from baseline are generally maintained during IMD repeated treatment. There was no evidence of classical tolerance to IMD 30 to 240 mg/day in a large well designed study. Although improvements from baseline were maintained over 6 weeks with IMD 30 or 60 mg/day, statistical significance versus placebo was eventually lost because of improved performance in the placebo group. IMD 120 or 240 mg/day were more effective than placebo after 6 weeks. Studies lasting up to 2 weeks found no evidence of tolerance to IMD 60 mg/day. In comparative trials lasting approximately 2 weeks, IMD 60 mg once daily was more effective than isosorbide dinitrate 30 mg 4 times daily and similar to or better than isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg 3 times daily. Preliminary data show that IMD 60 mg once daily has similar efficacy to diltiazem 60 mg 3 times daily and is at least as effective as certain other sustained-release isosorbide 5-mononitrate preparations. There is no evidence for rebound worsening of ischaemia 24 hours after IMD administration. Abrupt discontinuation during long term IMD treatment may exacerbate anginal symptoms. In general, IMD is well tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse event, headache, is usually mild to moderate, improves with long term therapy and rarely leads to treatment withdrawal. Patient compliance is better with once-daily administration of IMD than with twice-daily administration of conventional isosorbide 5-mononitrate.", 
    "32": "In patients with chronic stable angina, IMD provides effective antianginal prophylaxis for up to 12 hours and does not seem to be associated with rebound phenomena at the end of the dosage interval. Improvements from baseline are maintained during repeated administration, although loss of statistically significant superiority over placebo was evident during 6 weeks' treatment with IMD < or =60 mg/day in 1 study. Further evaluation of comparative efficacy (particularly with respect to other sustained-release preparations) and long term effects would be beneficial. Nevertheless, the available data suggest that IMD is a useful and convenient agent for the treatment of patients with chronic stable angina pectoris.",

Intra-arterial (des-Arg9)-bradykinin induced a hypotensive response in the LPS-pre-treated group (DBK 1 microg kg(-1), -6 +/- 1 mm Hg, DBK 10 microg kg(-1), -10 +/- 1 mm Hg, p < 0.05 vs. control conditions) that was totally abolished by intra-arterial (des-Arg9, Leu8)-bradykinin (10 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) (+1 +/- 2 mm Hg, p < 0.05). In the control and MLA-pre-treated groups, (des-Arg9)-bradykinin had no effect.", 
    "37": "MLA pre-treatment did not induce a hypotensive response to (des-Arg9)-bradykinin. We conclude that, in contrast to LPS, MLA does not induce B1-receptor synthesis, 24 h after its administration in the rabbit. Thus, the cardioprotective effects of MLA do not appear to be related to the kinin pathway.", 
    "38": "The effects of captopril and bradykinin on chorda tympani-induced salivation were studied in the submandibular gland of anesthetized cat. Captopril and bradykinin, but not des-Arg9-bradykinin, increased salivation evoked by electrical stimulation of chorda tympani. These potentiated effects of captopril and bradykinin were suppressed by Hoe-140, a kinin B2 receptor antagonist, or by concomitant addition of N(G)-nitro arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, and aspirin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. It appears that captopril potentiates chorda tympani-induced salivation through endogenously accumulated bradykinin, which acts on kinin B2 receptors, mediating production of nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase products.", 
    "39": "The Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder of connective tissue with pleiotropic manifestation involving mainly the cardiovascular, ocular, skeletal and pulmonary systems. Aortic root dilatation and heart valve lesions are particularly common and presage a reduced life expectancy. Over the ensuring 20 years, however, treatment to prevent or correct the cardiovascular complications of the syndrome has changed dramatically--life expectancy for patients with the Marfan syndrome has increased > 25%. Reasons for this dramatic increase may include (1) an overall improvement in population life expectancy, (2) benefits arising from cardiovascular surgery, and (3) greater proportion of milder cases due to increased frequency of diagnosis. Cardiovascular surgery, both prophylactic and emergent, has become accepted treatment for aortic aneurysm, and aortic dissection. In addition, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists have gained wide acceptance as potential agents for delaying aortic expansion and progression to rupture or dissection. In conclusion, medical therapy is also associated with an increase in probable survival.",

This prospective, controlled trial included consecutive eligible patients who had large varices (>5 mm in diameter) that were at high risk for bleeding. The patients were assigned to either propranolol therapy, at a dose sufficient to decrease the base-line heart rate by 25 percent, or variceal ligation, to be performed weekly until the varices were obliterated or so reduced in size that it was not possible to continue treatment.",

The mean (+/-SD) duration of follow-up in each group was 14+/-9 and 13+/-10 months, respectively. The mean time required to achieve an adequate reduction in the heart rate was 2.5+/-1.7 days; the mean number of sessions needed to complete variceal ligation was 3.2+/-1.1. After 18 months, the actuarial probability of bleeding was 43 percent in the propranolol group and 15 percent in the ligation group (P=0.04). Twelve patients in the propranolol group and four in the ligation group had bleeding. Three of the four in the ligation group had bleeding before their varices had been obliterated. Nine patients in the ligation group had recurrent varices, a mean of 3.7 months after the initial treatment. Five patients in each group died; bleeding from the varices was the cause of death of four patients in the propranolol group and of three in the ligation group. There were no serious complications of variceal ligation; in the propranolol group, treatment was stopped in two patients because of side effects.",

    "43": "Lungs from near-term fetal guinea pigs (61 +/- 2 days of gestation) were supported in vitro for 3 h; lung liquid production was monitored by a dye dilution method. Untreated control preparations produced fluid at 1.38 +/- 0.30 mL x kg(-1) body weight x h(-1), with no significant change (ANOVA; regression analysis); those given 1.24 x 10(-9) or 1.24 x 10(-8) M norepinephrine during the middle hour showed no significant change, but those given concentrations between 5.24 x 10(-8) and 1.24 x 10(-5) M all showed significant reductions or fluid reabsorption (based on 42 fetuses). The responses showed a linear relationship with the log concentration (r = 0.97). They appeared to involve alpha-adrenoreceptors, since responses to 10(-7) M norepinephrine were unaffected by 10(-6) M propranolol, but those to 10(-7) and 1.24 x 10(-6) M norepinephrine were abolished by 10(-6) and 1.78 x 10(-5) M phentolamine, respectively (based on 48 fetuses). Activation was through alpha2-adrenoreceptors, since responses to 10(-7) and 10(-5) M norepinephrine were abolished by 10(-4) M yohimbine, but not by 10(-5) M prazosin (based on 60 fetuses). The results show that norepinephrine is able to reduce lung liquid production when at plasma levels present at birth, and that it can produce reabsorption; unlike epinephrine, there was no reduction in responses at high concentrations. This work reintroduces a neglected factor, norepinephrine, into possible controls of lung liquid reabsorption, and opens up the potential for neural controls.", 
    "44": "It is now well known that the signal transduction pathway involving beta-adrenoceptors and adenylyl cyclase is altered in ischemic heart disease. Since leukocytes accumulate in the ischemic heart and produce hypochlorous acid (HOCl), we investigated the effects of HOCl upon beta-adrenoceptors and adenylyl cyclase activities by perfusing rat hearts with 0.1 mM HOCl for 10 min and isolating cardiac membranes. Marked depressions in both the density and affinity of beta1-adrenoceptors were observed, whereas no significant change in the affinity or density of beta2-adrenoceptors was seen in hearts perfused with HOCl. After treatment of hearts with HOCl, competition curves using isoproterenol, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, revealed a decrease in the proportion of high affinity binding sites. The adenylyl cyclase activities in the absence and presence of forskolin, NaF, Gpp(NH)p, or isoproterenol were depressed in hearts perfused with HOCl; however, the stimulatory effects of these agents on adenylyl cyclase were either unaltered or augmented. The presence of methionine in the perfusion medium prevented the HOCl-induced changes in beta1-adrenoceptors and adenylyl cyclase activity. These results suggest that HOCl may produce a defect in the beta-adrenoceptor linked signal transduction mechanism by affecting both beta1-adrenoceptors and adenylyl cyclase enzyme in the myocardium.", 
    "45": "Hydrogen peroxide has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, the effects of hydrogen peroxide upon the functional integrity of beta-adrenoceptors have been investigated in C6 glioma cells. Treatment of cells for 24 h with hydrogen peroxide in serum-free medium produced a concentration-dependent cell toxicity, seen both using cell counting and LDH release into medium as end point. There were no large nor consistent changes in either the density of cell surface beta 1, or beta 2-adrenoceptors, measured using the hydrophilic ligand [3H](-)-CGP 12177, nor in either basal, forskolin and isoprenaline-stimulated cAMP responses, following hydrogen peroxide treatment. It is concluded that the decreased adenylyl cyclase activity and responsiveness to Gs stimulation found in post-mortem brain samples from Alzheimer's disease autopsy cases is unlikely to be mediated by hydrogen peroxide.", 
    "46": "The efficacy and acceptability of 5 mg nebivolol once daily, a long-acting, vasodilating cardioselective beta blocker that additionally facilitates the L-arginine/nitric oxide system, was assessed in a double-blind, randomized trial in comparison with 20 mg nifedipine retard twice daily in patients with essential hypertension. At 2 weeks of treatment, nebivolol was significantly more effective. Thereafter, both drugs effectively and similarly lowered systolic and diastolic pressures without orthostatic effect. Nebivolol had a trough-to-peak antihypertensive effect ratio of 90%. Nifedipine gave the expected side effects of headache, flushing, and edema. Nebivolol was well tolerated. Nebivolol slightly but significantly lowered heart rate. Neither drug adversely affected plasma levels of lipids.", 
    "47": "The effects of metoclopramide, labetalol, and metoclopramide plus labetalol treatments on baseline cardiovascular parameters and isometric handgrip-induced changes were evaluated in 11 hypertensive subjects. Although all treatments were effective in reducing resting systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures, the combination of metoclopramide and labetalol appeared to provide a greater decrease (changes in SBP/DBP: 15/11 mm Hg, P < 0.05; from 149 +/- 4/95 +/- 4 mm Hg to 134 +/- 5/84 +/- 3 mm Hg) than did labetalol alone (changes in SBP/DBP: 10/9 mm Hg, P < 0.05; from 149 +/- 4/95 +/- 4 to 139 +/- 4/86 +/- 3 mm Hg). At 2 minutes, handgrip increased blood pressure on placebo (changes in SBP/DBP: 34/7 mm Hg, P < 0. 001). In the presence of metoclopramide and metoclopramide plus labetalol, however, handgrip induced lesser increases in blood pressure (changes in SBP/DBP: 23/7 mm Hg, P < 0.01, and 18/4 mm Hg, P < 0.01, for metoclopramide and metoclopramide plus labetalol treatments). We conclude that (1) metoclopramide lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients; (2) metoclopramide attenuates blood pressure response to isometric handgrip; and (3) both compounds, labetalol and metoclopramide, seem to have a pharmacologic interaction concerning blood pressure decrease. A clinical significance is suggested for the metoclopramide effect.", 
    "48": "In clinical practice it is far from uncommon that antihypertensive drugs fail to meet their expectations. This is mainly due to mechanisms counteracting their antihypertensive effects. These mechanisms include stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS), stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), as well as endothelium-dependent mechanisms. To review whether the activation of such mechanisms follows differential patterns depending on the type of antihypertensive therapy being used. The antihypertensive effects of diuretics and calcium channel blockers are largely offset by all of the mechanisms enumerated. The antihypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists and beta-blockers are counteracted by all of the mechanisms enumerated except for the effects of a stimulated RAAS and SNS, respectively. ACE inhibitors/AII receptor antagonists and beta-blockers display a better profile of mechanisms counteracting their antihypertensive effects than other categories of drugs currently available. However, because this is not routinely confirmed by random trial evidence, additional determinants of drug performance must be considered including between-subject disparities in drug response, metabolic effects, and proliferative effects.",

All drugs were titrated to a diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or less. Both studies were double-blind, randomized, parallel dose escalation trials with similar designs and included three active treatments. The second study also had a placebo group. The mean change from baseline of systolic and diastolic blood pressure for placebo (n = 79) was -0. 1/-2.2 mm Hg; amlodipine (n = 154), -12.4/-10.3 mm Hg; enalapril (n = 155), -9.4/-8.2 mm Hg; and bisoprolol/HCTZ (n = 155), -14.0/-12.0. Overall efficacy analyses documented a statistically significant decrease in sitting diastolic blood pressure for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ compared with placebo, amlodipine, and enalapril. There was a significant reduction in sitting systolic blood pressure for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ compared with placebo and enalapril but not amlodipine. Also, there was a significant decrease in sitting heart rate for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ (-6.2 beats/min) compared with placebo (+0.1 beats/min), amlodipine (+1.2 beats/min), and enalapril (+0.5 beats/min). The control rate (diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ (66.5%) was significantly better than for placebo (21.8%) and enalapril (47.1%) but not amlodipine (58.4%). Of those patients achieving and maintaining control, 49% of the bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ subjects were on the lowest two doses compared with 30% of the amlodipine and 26% of the enalapril subjects. Percentages of patients reporting at least one drug-related adverse event through week 12 were 27%, 24%, 28%, and 25% for placebo, bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ, amlodipine, and enalapril (not significant). Lower doses of two drugs in fixed combination can provide as good or better blood pressure control compared with higher doses of a single drug with similar tolerability and safety.", 
    "50": "Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in diabetic patients. It has been reported to count for almost 80% of all deaths. About three-fourths of these deaths result from coronary artery disease. Studies have shown that diabetic patients who have had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have a mortality of about twice that of nondiabetic patients. Various medications have been shown to improve the prognosis among diabetic patients suffering from ischemic heart disease. They include beta-blockers, thrombolytic agents, aspirin, ACE inhibitors, and lipid-lowering drugs. Experiences indicate that treatment with beta-blockers, thrombolytic agents, and ACE inhibitors is particularly advantageous in diabetic patients who have suffered AMI. Metabolic control also may be of major importance during the acute cardiac event because it is assumed that fatty acid metabolism is increased with a compromised glycolysis not only in ischemic but also in the nonischemic areas. One way to suppress free fatty acid oxidation is by the infusion of insulin-glucose. In the Swedish Diabetes Mellitus and Insulin Glucose Infusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction (DIGAMI) Study, patients with diabetes and AMI were randomized to receive insulin-glucose infusion followed by intensive subcutaneous insulin treatment or to be control subjects. The 1-year mortality was reduced 30% by insulin treatment. Diabetic patients who suffer from coronary artery disease have a particularly adverse prognosis. Previous experiences indicate that treatment with beta-blockers, thrombolytic agents, and ACE inhibitors is particularly advantageous in diabetic patients who have suffered AMI. Aspirin and lipid-lowering drugs should be offered to these patients on traditional indications as well. Metabolic control seems to be of major importance for the outcome.",

    "55": "beta-Blockers reduce cardiovascular death and reinfarction in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors provide an overall survival benefit in patients with signs or symptoms of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and a history of acute MI. Despite this, these agents remain underused in clinical practice. Appropriate patient selection in standard clinical practice should be encouraged in order to achieve a mortality rate reduction comparable to that seen in clinical trials. It appears from the findings of recent studies that the greatest benefit from beta-blocker therapy is achieved in patients who are more than 60 years of age and in patients at moderate or high risk for reinfarction and death (eg, patients with LV dysfunction or arrhythmias or both). Patients with class I-IV heart failure treated with ACE inhibitors have fewer recurrent infarctions, a lower incidence of severe congestive heart failure, and a reduced incidence of total cardiovascular death and sudden cardiac death. In addition to the studies completed in patients with MI, there are ongoing studies evaluating whether or not ACE inhibitors can reduce myocardial ischemic events in patients without a prior infarction who have coronary artery disease or hypertension and preserved LV function. There is also growing evidence that concomitant therapy with a beta-blocker and an ACE inhibitor may reduce mortality rates beyond that observed with ACE inhibitors alone in survivors of MI who have LV dysfunction.", 
    "56": "Biological functions and processes, including cardiovascular ones, exhibit significant circadian (24-hour) and other period rhythms. Ambulatory blood pressure assessment reveals marked circadian rhythms in blood pressure both in normotensive persons and hypertensive patients, whereas Holter monitoring substantiates day-night patterns in electrocardiographic events of patients with ischemic heart disease. The concept of homeostasis, that is, constancy of the milieu interne, which has dominated the teaching, research, and practice of medicine during the 20th century,is now being challenged by emerging concepts from the field of chronobiology-the science of biological rhythms. Epidemiologic studies document the heightened morning-time risk of angina, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Circadian rhythms in coronary tone and reactivity, plasma volume, blood pressure, heart rate, myocardial oxygen demand, blood coagulation, and neuroendocrine function plus day-night patterns in the nature and strength of environmental triggers all contribute to this morning vulnerability. Homeostatically devised pharmacotherapies, that is, medications formulated to ensure a near-constant drug concentration, may not be optimal to adequately control diseases that vary in risk and severity during the 24 hours. Moreover, circadian rhythms in the physiology of the gastrointestinal tract, vital organs, and body tissues may give rise to administration-time differences in the pharmacokinetics and effects of therapies. Thus the same medication consumed in the same dose under identical conditions in the evening and morning may not exhibit comparable pharmacokinetics and dynamics. New technology makes possible chronotherapy, that is, increase of the efficiency and safety of medications by proportioning their concentrations during the 24 hours in synchrony with biological rhythm determinants of disease. The chronotherapy of peptic ulcer disease achieved by the evening dosing of H 2-receptor antagonists and of asthma by the evening dosing of special drug delivery forms of theophylline and morning methylprednisolone administration has proven to be beneficial. Controlled-onset extended-release verapamil constitutes the first chronotherapy of essential hypertension and ischemic heart disease; once-a-day bedtime dosing results in a high drug concentration in the morning and afternoon and a reduced one overnight. Studies demonstrate effective 24-hour control of blood pressure, including the attenuation of its rapid rise in the morning, without induction of nighttime hypotension. Moreover, this formulation effectively controls angina, especially in the morning when the risk of ischemia is greatest. Determination of the role of verapamil chronotherapy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality awaits the results of the CONVINCE trial now in progress.",

Moreover, in the metoprolol group we found significant decreases in the oral glucose tolerance as well as C-peptide and insulin responses to the glucose load.", 
    "79": "Treatment with quinapril for 6 months appears to have advantages over metoprolol in NIDDM patients with hypertension. Although treatment with quinapril or metoprolol over 6 months was concomitant with a rise in the HbA1c, increased fasting blood glucose, decreased oral glucose tolerance and decreased C-peptide and insulin responses to a glucose challenge were observed only in patients treated with metoprolol.", 
    "80": "Important intervention trials performed during the last decades and years are presented and critically reviewed. These long-term studies with hard end points have demonstrated positive results for four different antihypertensive classes: diuretics, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors. The major issue is the prevention of hypertensive complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure or stroke. For achieving this primary goal blood pressure reduction--or ideally normalization--is of decisive importance. As recommended by the Deutsche Hochdruckliga (German \"Hypertension League\") specific and individualized treatment of hypertension should consider target organ protecting effects of the various antihypertensive agents. In many cases combination therapy will be necessary to control hypertension (blood pressure target < 140/90 mmHg).", 
    "81": "Systemic and especially splanchnic arterial vasodilation accompany chronic portal hypertension. Different soluble mediators causing this vasodilation have been proposed, the strongest evidence being for nitric oxide (NO). No data exist if structural vascular changes may partly account for this vasodilatory state. Here, we developed a new in vivo quantitative angiogenesis assay in the abdominal cavity and determined if: 1) portal hypertensive rats show increased angiogenesis; and 2) angiogenesis is altered by inhibiting NO formation. Portal hypertension was induced by partial portal vein ligation (PVL). Sham-operated rats served as controls (CON). During the index operation (day 0), a teflon ring filled with collagen I (Vitrogen 100) was sutured in the mesenteric cavity. After 16 days, rings were explanted, embedded in paraffin, and ingrown vessels counted using a morphometry system. The role of NO was tested by adding an antagonist of NO formation (Nomega-nitro-L-arginine [NNA], 3.3 mg/kg/d) into the drinking water. The mean number of ingrown vessels per implant was significantly higher in PVL rats compared with CON rats, i.e., 1,453 +/- 187 versus 888 +/- 116, respectively (P <.05; N = 5 per group). NNA significantly (P <.01) inhibited angiogenesis in PVL (202 +/- 124; N = 5) and in CON (174 +/- 25; N = 6) rats, respectively. In contrast, the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, did not prevent angiogenesis either in PVL or CON rats in a separate set of experiments (data not shown). The conclusions drawn from this study are that: 1) rats with portal hypertension show increased angiogenesis; and 2) inhibition of NO formation significantly prevents angiogenesis in both PVL and CON rats. Therefore, splanchnic vasodilation in chronic portal hypertension may also be a result of structural changes.", 
    "82": "Previous studies have shown that an elevated basal metabolic rate (BMR) is present in elderly malnourished cancer patients. A possible dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system needs to be demonstrated. In aged weight-losing cancer patients (n = 40), aged non-weight-losing cancer patients (n = 30), and aged weight-losing noncancer patients (n = 18), the baseline BMR and heart rate variability were studied. Aged weight-losing cancer patients (n = 40) underwent bioimpedance analysis, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring with analysis of heart rate variability, and determination of the BMR. Then, the patients received infusion of Intralipid (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) without and with propranolol (6 days of 40 mg twice daily) administration. At baseline, a simple correlation between the BMR and the low-frequency component (LF) (r = .42, P < .006) and LF to high-frequency (HF) ratio (r = .51, P < .001) was found. After propranolol administration, the percent decline in the BMR was significantly correlated with the percent decline in the LF (r = .39, P < .01) and LF/HF ratio (r = .53, P < .001). The percent decline in the BMR was not correlated with the HF (r = .13, P < .34) or the plasma noradrenaline concentration (r = .21, P < .20) at any time. With regard to the BMR and substrate oxidation, 6-day propranolol administration plus Intralipid infusion produced the strongest decline in the BMR. This study demonstrates that autonomic nervous system dysfunction occurs and is responsible for the elevated BMR in elderly cancer patients, propranolol administration rectifies the autonomic dysfunction, and Intralipid infusion combined with propranolol administration is useful for enhancing the daily caloric intake without a strong increase in energy expenditure.", 
    "83": "Endothelins play an important role in cardiovascular diseases, and clinical trials have shown a reduction in endothelin levels after long-term treatment of chronic heart failure with beta-adrenergic antagonists. It is not known, however, whether this effect is caused by haemodynamic changes associated with the use of beta-adrenergic antagonists or by direct interaction of beta-blockers with human endothelial cells. The aim of this study was to determine whether beta-adrenergic antagonists have an influence on endothelin-1 (ET-1) synthesis and release in human endothelial cells.",

This ET-1-reducing effect was even more pronounced in thrombin-stimulated cells (10(-5) mol L-1 of propranolol, metoprolol and celiprolol: 19% +/- 5.8%, 25% +/- 4% and 37% +/- 5.2% respectively).", 
    "85": "Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Northern blotting confirmed an inhibitory effect of the beta-blocker on biosynthesis. Furthermore, the ET-1-reducing effect of propranolol, metoprolol and celiprolol was not due to a compensatory increase in prostacyclin and was not reversible by N-nitro-L-arginine.",

    "87": "Phosphatidic acid and its hydrolysis product, diacylglycerol, play potentially vital roles as extracellular messengers in numerous cellular systems and may play a key role in regulating hematopoiesis. In this study, we describe an ecto-phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase that potentially regulates cellular responses to phosphatidic acid on bone marrow derived human hematopoietic progenitors. We partially purified hematopoietic progenitor ecto-PAPase using a novel in-gel phosphatase assay and then characterized the enzyme on phenotypically defined subpopulations of hematopoietic CD34+ progenitors isolated by flow cytometry. The most pronounced PAPase activity was confined to uncommitted CD34+/CD38+ hematopoietic progenitors, which lacked the expression of other lineage-associated antigens. We conclude that hematopoietic progenitor cells at various stages of maturation possess a potent ecto-PAPase, an enzyme well positioned to regulate progenitor cell growth and differentiation induced by phosphatidic acid and related lipids.", 
    "88": "P-glycoprotein is a plasma membrane protein of mammalian cells that confers multidrug resistance by acting as a broad-specificity, ATP-dependent efflux transporter of diverse lipophilic neutral or cationic compounds. Previously, we identified two positively cooperative drug-binding sites of P-glycoprotein involved in transport [Shapiro, A. B. & Ling, V. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem. 250, 130-137]. The H site is selective for Hoechst 33342 and colchicine. The R site is selective for rhodamine 123 and anthracyclines. Substrate binding to one site stimulates transport by the other. In this paper, we show that prazosin and progesterone stimulate the transport of both Hoechst 33342 and rhodamine 123. Rhodamine 123 and prazosin (or progesterone) in combination stimulate Hoechst 33342 transport in an additive manner. In contrast, Hoechst 33342 and either prazosin or progesterone interfere with each other, so that the stimulatory effect of the combination on rhodamine 123 transport is less than that of each individually. Non-P-glycoprotein-specific effects of prazosin on membrane fluidity and permeability were excluded. These results indicate the existence of a third drug-binding site on P-glycoprotein with a positive allosteric effect on drug transport by the H and R sites. This allosteric site appears to be one of the sites of photoaffinity labeling of P-glycoprotein by [125I]iodoarylazidoprazosin [Safa, A. R., Agresti, M., Bryk, D. & Tamai, I. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 256-265] and is likely not to be capable of drug transport.",

Mean (SD) age was 60 (12) years (313 men, 199 women). Chronotropic incompetence was defined as failure to achieve 85% of the maximum exercise heart rate predicted for age and sex (220 - age in men; 200 - age in women) at maximum dobutamine dose.", 
    "91": "Chronotropic incompetence occurred in 196 patients (38%). Affected patients were significantly younger, more likely to be men (both p < 0.001) and smokers (p < 0.05), had a higher prevalence of previous myocardial infarction (p < 0.005) and resting wall motion abnormalities (p < 0. 05), and had a lower resting heart rate (p < 0.001) and systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001) than patients without chronotropic incompetence, but there was no difference in the overall prevalence of ischaemia and significant coronary artery disease. By multivariate analysis, independent predictors of chronotropic incompetence were a lower resting heart rate (p < 0.001), younger age (p < 0.001), and male sex (p < 0.001).", 
    "92": "The relations among sex, age, and chronotropic incompetence show the need to titrate the dobutamine dose using specific data based on age and sex related heart rate responses to dobutamine rather than to an exercise stress test. Obtaining specific heart rate criteria is necessary to determine whether chronotropic incompetence represents a real failure to achieve a normal response or is the result of applying an inappropriate gold standard.",

Higher pulse pressure was associated with increased prevalence of female gender, greater calcium channel blocking agent, digoxin and diuretic use, lower heart rate and a higher rate of reported smoking history. Higher mean arterial pressure was associated with higher heart rate, lower calcium channel blocker and digoxin use and lower New York Heart Association functional class. Over a 61-month follow-up 1,582 deaths (1,397 cardiovascular) occurred. In a multivariate analysis adjusting for the above covariates and treatment assignment, higher pulse pressure remained an independent predictor of total and cardiovascular mortality (total mortality relative risk, 1.05 per 10 mm Hg increment; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.10; p = 0.02).

Carvedilol was commenced at 3.125 mg b.i.d. and titrated to 25 mg b.i.d. as tolerated. Patients with class IV symptoms were older (p = 0.03), had lower left ventricular fractional shortening (p < 0.001), had lower six-min walk distance (p < 0.001) and were receiving more heart failure medications at baseline compared with less symptomatic patients.", 
    "101": "Nonfatal adverse events while taking carvedilol occurred more frequently in class IV patients (43% vs. 24%, p < 0.0001), and more often resulted in permanent withdrawal of the drug (25% vs. 13%, p < 0.01). Thirty-seven (59%) patients who were NYHA class IV at baseline had improved by one or more functional class at 3 months, 8 (13%) were unchanged and 18 (29%) had deteriorated or died. Among the less symptomatic group, 62 (37%) patients had improved their NYHA status at 3 months, 73 (44%) were unchanged and 32 (19%) had deteriorated or died. The differences in symptomatic outcome at three months between the two groups were statistically significant (p = 0.001, chi-square analysis). Both groups demonstrated similar significant improvements in left ventricular dimensions and systolic function.",

On univariate analysis, beta-blocker use was associated with significantly lower mortality than nonuse in both trials. Moreover, a synergistic reduction in mortality with use of both a beta-blocker and enalapril was suggested in the Prevention trial. After adjusting for important prognostic variables with Cox multivariate analysis, the association of beta-adrenergic blocking agent use with reduced mortality remained significant for Prevention trial patients receiving enalapril.

Difficulties arise when drugs reduce either the physical ability or the motivation to exercise. This article focuses on the physiological limitations to prolonged aerobic exercise in patients receiving beta-blockers. Possible limiting factors to exercise while taking beta-blockers include reduction in heart rate and cardiac output, local alterations to blood flow, changes to muscle and liver glycogenolysis, and alterations to adipose and intra-muscular lipolysis. The disadvantages and advantages of nonselective and beta 1-selective drugs are discussed, as well as those of drugs that have beta 2-agonist properties. Particular emphasis is placed upon the beta-blocker-induced attenuation of the normal increase in fat oxidation during prolonged exercise. There are physiological advantages, especially for the physically active individual, in prescribing beta 1-selective rather than nonselective drugs in controlled release, rather than conventional release, form. Additionally, there may be further advantages in prescribing drugs which have partial agonist properties at beta 2 receptors.",

The patient presented with cough and dyspnea and was found to have a restrictive disorder leading to hypoxemia (68 mmHg at rest and 51 mmHg during exercise). Bronchial lavage fluid had high lymphocyte (28%) and neutrophil (7%) counts. Transbronchial biopsies demonstrated moderate fibrous thickening of the interalveolar walls.

Rats were treated with saline, isoprenaline, nitrendipine, or nitrendipine + isoprenaline. After 7 days of treatment, tracheas were isolated and the dissociation constant (Kb) for the propranolol-beta-receptor complex was determined. Lung parenchymal tissue was used to study the binding characteristics of beta-adrenoceptors. The Kb value for the propranolol-beta-receptor complex was found to be up to 6.4-fold higher in trachea isolated from isoprenaline-treated rats (32 +/- 5.4 nM) than from control rats (4.9 +/- 1.2 nM); the Kb value for trachea from isoprenaline + nitrendipine-treated rats was 7.0 +/- 1.2 nM. A 31% reduction in the number of beta-adrenoceptors as compared to those of the control group was observed in the isoprenaline-treated group while the number of the beta-adrenoceptors in the isoprenaline + nitrendipine-treated group was significantly increased as compared to that of the isoprenaline-treated group.",

A total of 202 patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma and an IOP > or = 22 mm Hg were enrolled in this 12-week, randomized, observer-masked, two-period crossover study. Significantly more patients preferred timolol gel to timolol solution (P < 0.001). Ninety-two percent of patients preferring timolol gel strongly agreed or agreed that once-daily dosing was a reason for their preference. Those who preferred timolol solution did so because of fewer side effects. The mean IOP-lowering effects of the 2 treatments were similar at both morning trough and peak time points. The incidence of drug-related adverse experiences was similar (timolol gel 11.4% vs timolol solution 10.9%). Because both treatments were well tolerated and effective in lowering IOP, timolol gel, with its once-daily dosing regimen, should be considered in patients who are candidates for therapy with an ophthalmic beta-blocking agent.",

We assessed heart rate variability of diabetic patients with the tone-entropy analysis that has been published elsewhere (Oida et al. 1997). Tone reflects the cardiac vago-sympathetic balance and entropy the total autonomic efferent activity. Diabetic influence on tone and entropy was examined in two groups of patients (38-52 years and 60-69 year, total 106) stratified according to the occurrence of impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus. Ten healthy middle-aged volunteers were also examined as a reference. Electrocardiographic data were collected at rest for 10 min. Tone increased and entropy decreased significantly with severity of diabetic disorders. The alterations were depicted as a curvi-linear relation in tone-entropy space, which superimposed adequately on the standard tone-entropy values obtained in a pharmacological experiment. The results demonstrate that the vago-sympathetic balance is altered with diabetic disorders: vagal predominance is impaired significantly in proportion to a withdrawal of total autonomic efferent activity.",

Prior to restoration of SR, AF cycle length prolonged by 68%, 103%, 53%, and 20%, respectively. The QRS width increased by 14%, 64%, and 58% (HQ, Ci, and Fl), and remained unchanged by administration of dS. RR intervals were slightly prolonged by HQ, Ci, and Fl, and markedly prolonged by dS (48%). The QT interval was moderately prolonged by HQ, Ci, and Fl, and considerably by dS (34%). QTc was only slightly prolonged by each of the drugs. Directly after cardioversion of AF, the atrial refractory period was 87+/-29 (HQ), 119+/-32 (Ci), 66+/-10 (Fl), and 73+/-18 msec (dS) (control: 146+/-18 msec). Atrial conduction velocity was 85+/-6, 71+/-11, 86+/-12, and 110+/-11 cm/sec compared with a control value of 116+/-10 cm/sec. Because directly after cardioversion the atrial wavelength was still very short (5.7 to 8.4 cm), the vulnerability for AF was still very high, and a single premature beat reinduced AF in 71% (Ci) to 100% (HQ, Fl, and dS) of the cases.",

The trial will test the hypothesis whether, in high-risk post myocardial infarction (MI) patients already treated with beta blockers, electrophysiologic study (EPS)-guided therapy (including the prophylactic implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ICD] in inducible patients) will improve survival compared with conventional therapy. Patients eligible for the study are survivors of recent MI (> or = 5 and < or = 21 days), aged < or = 80 years, with left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 35% and > or = 1 of the following additional risk factors: (1) ventricular premature beats > or = 10/hour; (2) decreased heart rate variability (standard deviation of unusual RR intervals < 70 msec); and (3) presence of ventricular late potentials. Furthermore, all enrolled patients must be able to tolerate at least 25 mg of metoprolol per day. These patients constitute about 9% of all patients with recent MI and are expected to have a 2-year all-cause mortality > 25% of which 50% is anticipated to be from sudden death. The main criteria of exclusion from the study are (1) a history of sustained ventricular arrhythmia; (2) documentation of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during the screening phase; and (3) the need for myocardial revascularization and contraindications or intolerance to beta-blocker therapy. Eligible patients will be randomized to 2 different therapeutic strategies: conventional strategy or EPS/ICD strategy. Patients allocated to the EPS/ICD strategy will undergo further risk stratification, and electrophysiologically inducible patients (approximately 35%) will receive prophylactic ICDs, in addition to the conventional therapy, whereas noninducible patients will be only conventionally treated. The primary endpoint of the study will be death from all causes. By hypothesizing a 30% reduction in the 2-year mortality (from 20% to 14%) in the EPS/ICD group compared with conventionally treated patients, 1,200 patients will have to be included. A triangular, 2-sided sequential design with preset boundaries, for a 5% significance level and 90% power to detect a reduction in 2-year mortality from 20% to 14%, will be used to permit early termination of the trial if the strategy is found to be efficacious, no difference, or inefficacious.", 
    "132": "Catecholamines and ischemia play an important role in the induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Beta blockers antagonize the effect of catecholamines and have anti-ischemic properties. Several controlled studies performed in the early 1980s in patients after myocardial infarction have shown that beta-blocker therapy clearly decreases sudden and nonsudden cardiac death. Despite the lack of recent randomized trials, data from uncontrolled studies suggest that the beneficial effect of beta blockers is still present in the thrombolytic era. Thus, it is incomprehensible that today in the United States and in most parts of Europe, < 40% of post-myocardial infarction patients are treated with beta blockers. Even in patients with documented sustained ventricular tachycardias (VTs) or ventricular fibrillation (VF), clinical studies indicate that beta blockers improve survival. Thus, even in the thrombolytic era, beta blockers should be used as a basic therapy in patients who are at risk of sudden cardiac death.", 
    "133": "Both isolated systolic hypertension (>140 mm Hg/<90 mm Hg) and systolic/diastolic hypertension (>140 mm Hg/>90 mm Hg) are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease in the elderly. Specific antihypertensive drug therapy is available if lifestyle interventions fail to reduce blood pressure to a normal level. Diuretics and beta blockers both reduce the occurrence of adverse events related to cerebrovascular disease; however, diuretics are more effective in reducing events related to coronary heart disease. Treated patients are less likely to develop severe hypertension or congestive heart failure. In most instances, low-dose diuretic therapy should be used as initial antihypertensive therapy in the elderly. A long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker may be used as alternative therapy in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension. Trials are being conducted to evaluate the long-term effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers in elderly patients with uncomplicated hypertension.", 
    "134": "Renin-angiotensin system has long been thought to be a classic endocrine negative feedback system in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Furthermore, angiotensin II formation was believed to be regulated by renin secreted from the kidneys. In contrast to these considerations is the identification of local angiotensin II production in other tissues than pulmonary vasculature. Prorenin, the molecular precursor of renin, has been assumed to be involved in local angiotensin II production because of its renin-like activity. Prorenin has also been found to be secreted from extrarenal sources, although a major part of it is derived from the kidneys. Increased concentration of total renin in serum has been proposed to be useful in identifying patients with active proliferative retinopathy in insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Renin-angiotensin system is strongly affected by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and therefore the interfering effect of ACE inhibitor medication on total renin concentration should be known in order to interpret serum total renin concentrations. Nine hypertensive outpatients, all men, treated at the department of internal medicine in Turku University Central Hospital, received randomly 5 mg of ramipril or 95 mg of metoprolol once a day for 4 weeks. Ramipril significantly increased the mean value of total renin (191.9 ng/l vs 312.0 ng/l, p < 0.01), but the metoprolol-induced increase in the concentration of serum total renin was insignificant. We conclude that the negative feedback mechanism in regulating renin and prorenin secretion was inhibited by ACE inhibitor ramipril but beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol did not significantly change total renin concentration in serum.", 
    "135": "Total sleep deprivation (TSD) shows powerful but transient clinical effects in patients affected by bipolar depression. Pindolol blocks the serotonergic 5-HT1A autoreceptor, thus improving the antidepressant effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. We evaluated the interaction of TSD and pindolol in the treatment of acute episodes of bipolar depression. Forty bipolar depressed inpatients were randomized to receive pindolol 7.5 mg/day or placebo for nine days in combination with three consecutive TSD cycles. Pindolol significantly improved the antidepressant effect of TSD, and prevented the short-term relapse after treatment. The response rate (HDRS scores < 8) at the end of treatment was 15/20 for pindolol, and 3/20 for placebo. Coadministration of pindolol and TSD resulted in a complete response, which could be sustained for six months with lithium salts alone, in 65% of cases. This results suggest a major role for serotonergic transmission in the mechanism of action of TSD, and makes TSD treatment more effective in the treatment of bipolar depression.", 
    "136": "The RIMA (Rimodellamento Infarto Miocardico Acuto) study was designed to assess the relative effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by captopril, beta-blocker therapy by metoprolol, and their combination in patients with a first acute myocardial infarction on: 1. echocardiographically detected left ventricular remodeling; 2. prognosis. The second goal will be the argument of the present paper. Two-hundred fifty < or = 75 years consecutive patients (mean age: 58 yrs, males = 203) with acute myocardial infarction were randomly allocated to receive for > or = 3 months captopril (up to 75 mg/day, Group 1), metoprolol (up to 200 mg/day, Group 2) or captopril + metoprolol (Group 3) starting in the first 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. Intravenous beta-blockers in the acute phase of myocardial infarction and all other cardioactive drugs were allowed. The effect of the randomized therapy at six months from admission to the coronary care unit was considered in relation to: 1. recurrence of spontaneous cardiac events and of elective revascularization procedures; 2. adverse reactions (hypotension, atrioventricular block, cough, allergy, need of beta-blockers in Group 1, need for ACE inhibition in Group 2) requiring treatment modification based on physician's decision.", 
    "137": "Definite follow-up data were available in 226 patients and 195/226 patients (86%) had a complete treatment period. In these patients (per protocol analysis), 37 spontaneous cardiac events occurred: cardiac death = 6, non-fatal reinfarction = 9, unstable angina requiring hospitalization = 16, congestive heart failure = 6. Moreover, seven patients received a coronary revascularization procedure. Events occurred in 11/67 patients from Group 1, 16/63 patients from Group 2, 10/65 patients from Group 3 (16% vs 25% vs 15%, p = 0.28). The multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated an increased odds ratio (OR) for spontaneous cardiac events in patients from Group 2 (OR = 2.82, 95% Cl: 1.16-6.87: p < 0.05). Elective revascularization procedures were statistically less frequent in patients treated with metoprolol (Group 1 = 9%, Group 2 = 1.6%, Group 3 = 0%; Group 1 vs Groups 2 and 3; p = 0.03). The intention-to-treat analysis on the overall population (226 patients) confirmed the presence of a trend towards a higher risk in patients from Group 2 (OR = 2.1, 95% Cl: 0.96-4.59; p = 0.06). Adverse reactions were observed in 16 patients from Group 1, 6 patients from Group 2 and 15 patients from Group 3 (22% vs 10% vs 23%; Group 2 vs Groups 1 and 3; p = 0.08). At the multivariate regression analysis, a trend towards less adverse reactions in patients assigned to the beta-blocker therapy alone was confirmed (OR = 0.41, 95% Cl: 0.15-1.13; p = 0.07).", 
    "138": "In a randomized early post-infarction treatment strategy, ACE inhibition with captopril alone or in combination with metoprolol demonstrated an increased protection against spontaneous cardiac events at six months in comparison with metoprolol alone. On the other hand, the beta-blocker treatment was associated with a lower number of elective revascularization procedures and appeared better tolerated than ACE inhibition.", 
    "139": "Neurally mediated syncope is a complex syndrome that is often difficult to manage using currently available treatment strategies. The efficacy and safety of clonazepam was evaluated in 35 patients with refractory neurally mediated syncope. All patients had syncope (n = 33) or disabling presyncope (n = 2) and a positive head-up tilt table test (HUTT) despite treatment with one or more of the following therapies: beta-blocker, high-salt diet, fludrocortisone, elastic compression stockings, and disopyramide. Clonazepam was initiated at 0.5 mg/day and titrated in 0.25-0.5 mg/day increments for symptom control. Early (first 8 weeks) symptomatic response was achieved in 31 of 35 (89%) patients. Early HUTT reverted to negative in 29 of 35 (83%) patients. Two patients discontinued clonazepam during early follow-up due to side effects. Thirty-three patients received long-term clonazepam therapy. Twenty-five patients had late HUTT with 21 remaining negative. Of the eight patients who did not have late HUTT, one patient discontinued clonazepam prior to HUTT due to side effects. Seven patients refused late HUTT. All seven patients achieved symptomatic control on clonazepam with two requiring dose titration. Of the 21 patients with a negative late HUTT, 18 achieved symptomatic control with two of these patients requiring dose titration. Two patients who had only partial symptom control despite dose titration achieved total symptomatic control with the addition of disopyramide and beta-blockers. Two patients with a negative late HUTT discontinued clonazepam due to side effects. One patient had been symptomatically controlled while the other had recurrent symptoms with dose limiting side effects occurring after clonazepam dose titration. In the 4 patients with a positive late HUTT, 2 patients were symptomatically controlled, 1 patients required combination therapy with a beta-blocker to achieve symptomatic control, and 1 patient discontinued therapy due to side effects. Overall, 29 of 35 (83%) patients continue to receive clonazepam with symptom control. Based on intention-to-treat HUTT results, 21 of 35 (60%) patients were responders. Four patients required clonazepam dose titration and three required combination therapy with clonazepam plus disopyramide and/or a beta-blocker to achieve control. Clonazepam was discontinued in 6 patients, 5 for side effects and 1 following a transient ischemic attack. Clonazepam appears to be an effective therapeutic alternative in patients with refractory neurally mediated syncope. Based on our preliminary findings, a placebo controlled evaluation of clonazepam in neurally mediated syncope is warranted.", 
    "140": "Pharmacological therapy of neurocardiogenic syncope is often limited by the relatively low response rate to such treatment. In particular, response to beta-blocker treatment has been reported to average 50%. Therefore, a two-step protocol, with metoprolol being the drug of first choice, was developed and prospectively evaluated in consecutive patients with a history of repeated syncopal attacks and a positive tilt table test indicative of neurocardiogenic syncope. Patients not responding to the beta-blocker were switched to the alpha-adrenoceptoragonist midodrine. Acute drug efficacy was assessed by repeated tilt table testing. The incidence of syncope recurrence rate was determined during a 7-month follow-up. In 16 of 30 (53%) patients, metoprolol was primarily effective; this was also the case in 7 of 11 patients receiving midodrine. Thus, the overall efficacy rate could be increased to 77% by the treatment protocol (P = 0.009, as compared to beta-blocker treatment alone). During follow-up, only 1 of 27 patients (4%) had a syncopal event. Thus, the two-step treatment protocol presented in this study proved to be safe and to improve significantly patients clinical symptoms, as well as results of repeated tilt table testing as compared to beta-blocker treatment alone.", 
    "141": "1. The effects of adrenergic stimulation on the ultrarapid delayed rectifier K+ current (IKur,d) of dog atrial myocytes was studied with patch-clamp methods. 2. Isoproterenol (isoprenaline) increased IKur,d in a concentration-dependent fashion with an EC50 of 7.3 +/- 0.8 nM. The effect of isoproterenol was blocked by propranolol, mimicked by forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP, and prevented by inhibition of protein kinase A. 3. Phenylephrine (in the presence of propranolol) increased IKur,d with an EC50 of 0.49 +/- 0.06 microM. The effect of phenylephrine was blocked by prazosin, prevented by inhibition of protein kinase C, and mimicked by activation of protein kinase C with phorbol ester. 4. Phenylephrine significantly abbreviated canine atrial action potential duration in the absence of tetraethylammonium (TEA). When TEA was present under both control conditions and in the presence of phenylephrine, phenylephrine failed to alter canine atrial repolarization. 5. We conclude that beta- and alpha-adrenergic stimulation increase IKur,d via protein kinase A and C, respectively, and that the induced changes in IKur,d may play a role in adrenergic control of canine atrial repolarization.", 
    "142": "Clinical studies conducted with carvedilol suggest that beta-adrenoceptor antagonism is an effective therapeutic approach to the treatment of heart failure. However, many beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are weak partial agonists and possess significant intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), which may be problematic in the treatment of heart failure. In the present study, the ISAs of bucindolol, xamoterol, bisoprolol, and carvedilol were evaluated and compared in normal rats [Sprague-Dawley (SD)], in rats with confirmed heart failure [spontaneously hypertensive heart failure (SHHF)], and in isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. At equieffective beta1-adrenolytic doses, the administration of xamoterol and bucindolol produced a prolonged, equieffective, and dose-related increase in heart rate in both pithed SD rats (ED50 = 5 and 40 microgram/kg, respectively) and SHHF rats (ED50 = 6 and 30 microgram/kg, respectively). The maximum effect of both compounds in SHHF rats was approximately 50% of that observed in SD rats. In contrast, carvedilol and bisoprolol had no significant effect on resting heart rate in the pithed SD or SHHF rat. The maximum increase in heart rate elicited by xamoterol and bucindolol was inhibited by treatment with propranolol, carvedilol, and betaxolol (beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist) but not by ICI 118551 (beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist) in neonatal rat. When the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated cAMP response was examined in cardiomyocytes, an identical partial agonist/antagonist response profile was observed for all compounds, demonstrating a strong correlation with the in vivo results. In contrast, GTP-sensitive ligand binding and tissue adenylate cyclase activity were not sensitive methods for detecting beta-adrenoceptor partial agonist activity in the heart. In summary, xamoterol and bucindolol, but not carvedilol and bisoprolol, exhibited direct beta1-adrenoceptor-mediated ISA in normal and heart failure rats.", 
    "143": "It has been established that administration of 5-HT1A agonists attenuates the rate of isolation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) in 10-day-old rat pups. In this study we extended these findings by examining the effects of administration of the serotonergic 1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), and mixed 5-HT1A antagonist/beta adrenergic antagonist, (+/-)-pindolol, in 3-, 10-, and 14-day-old rat pups in order to assess the effect of these drugs from a developmental perspective. At all three ages, 8-OH-DPAT significantly reduced the rate of isolation-induced USV. While only the highest dose (1.0 mg/kg) of 8-OH-DPAT administered to the 10- and 14-day-olds significantly reduced the rate of vocalization, both the 0.1- and 1.0-mg/kg doses significantly attenuated the vocalization rate in the 3-day-olds. Pindolol administration did not alter the rate of USV at any age nor did it block the quieting effect that generally occurs when an anesthetized littermate is placed with the isolated pup. We conclude that 8-OH-DPAT is effective as early as 3 days of age in the quieting of isolation-induced USV and that the regional age-dependent development of 5-HT1A receptors and projections are important factors in the observed differential sensitivity to 8-OH-DPAT administration during development.", 
    "144": "The spontaneous discharge patterns of developing retinal ganglion cells are thought to play a crucial role in the refinement of early retinofugal projections. To investigate the contributions of intrinsic membrane properties to the spontaneous activity of developing ganglion cells, we assessed the effects of blocking large and small calcium-activated potassium conductances on the temporal pattern of such discharges by means of patch-clamp recordings from the intact retina of developing ferrets. Application of apamin and charybdotoxin (CTX), which selectively block the small and large calcium-activated potassium channels, respectively, resulted in significant changes in spontaneous firings. In cells recorded from the oldest animals [postnatal day 30 (P30)-P45], which manifested relatively sustained discharge patterns, application of either blocker induced bursting activity. With CTX the bursts were highly periodic, short in duration, and of high frequency. In contrast, with apamin the interburst intervals were longer, less regular, and lower in overall spike frequency. These differences between the effects of the two blockers on spontaneous activity were documented by spectral analysis of discharge patterns. Filling cells from which recordings were made with Lucifer yellow revealed that these effects were obtained in all three morphological classes of cells: alpha, beta, and gamma. These findings provide the first evidence that apamin- and CTX-sensitive K+ conductances can have differential effects on the spontaneous discharge patterns of retinal ganglion cells. Remarkably, the bursts of activity obtained after apamin application in more mature neurons appeared very similar to the spontaneous bursting patterns observed in developing neurons. These findings suggest that the maturation of calcium-activated potassium channels, particularly the apamin-sensitive conductance, may contribute to the changes in spontaneous firings exhibited by retinal ganglion cells during the course of normal development.", 
    "145": "Although it has long been believed that glial cells play a major role in transmitter uptake at synapses in the CNS, the relative contribution of glial and neuronal cells to reuptake of synaptically released glutamate has been unclear. Recent identification of the diverse glutamate transporter subtypes provides an opportunity to examine this issue. To monitor glutamate transporter activity, we optically detected synaptically induced changes of membrane potential from hippocampal CA1 field in slice preparations using a voltage-sensitive dye, RH155. In the presence of ionotropic glutamate-receptor blockers, synaptic inputs gave rise to a slow depolarizing response (SDR) in the dendritic field. The amplitude of SDR correlated well with presynaptic activities, suggesting that it was related to transmitter release. The SDR was found to be caused by the activities of glutamate transporters because it was not affected by blockers for GABAA, nACh, 5-HT3, P2X, or metabotropic glutamate receptors but was greatly reduced by dihydrokainate (DHK), a specific blocker for GLT-1 transporter, and by D, L-threo-beta-hydroxyaspartate (THA), a blocker for EAAC, GLAST, and GLT-1 transporters. When SDR was detected with RH482 dye, which stains both glial and neuronal cells, 1 mM DHK and 1 mM THA were equally effective in suppressing SDR. The SDR was very small in GLT-1 knockout mice but was maintained in gerbil hippocampi in which postsynaptic neurons were absent because of ischemia. Because GLT-1 transporters are exclusively expressed in astrocytes, our results provide direct evidence that astrocytes play the dominant role in sequestering synaptically released glutamate.",

    "150": "Essential hypertension appears to be more prevalent among blacks than among whites and has an earlier onset in blacks. Many data in this field come from studies in the African-American population. Hypertension-related complications, e.g. ischaemic heart disease, (end stage) renal failure and cerebrovascular disease, are encountered more often among blacks and frequently run a more severe course. Factors that might explain the racial difference in prevalence of hypertension and hypertensive complications include both genetic and environmental variables. Hypertension in blacks is characterized by salt sensitivity, a tendency towards expanded plasma volume and low plasma renin levels. Socioeconomic factors, the higher prevalence of obesity and insulin resistance may contribute to the high prevalence of hypertension in blacks. Aggressive antihypertensive therapy appears mandatory in the black hypertensive, possibly with lower goal blood pressures than the 140/90 mmHg generally recommended. Diuretic monotherapy proves to be the first-line therapy, calcium channel blockers are an attractive alternative. Black patients are frequently less responsive to monotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blocking agents. This black/white difference in therapeutic response can, however, be eliminated by addition of a diuretic.", 
    "151": "Catecholamines modulate lymphocyte function via stimulation of beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2R). Previous investigations revealed a decreased density of beta2R on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients with chronic rheumatic diseases. Aim of the present study was to determine the impact of this decrease on catecholamine response of PBMC from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in vitro. PBMC from 17 patients with RA and 12 healthy blood donors (HD) were investigated. Beta2R were determined by a radioligand binding assay. The effects of epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) on PBMC proliferation were studied using cells activated with pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and monoclonal anti-CD3-antibodies (OKT3), respectively. In parallel, alpha1- or beta-receptor antagonist were added to the culture to determine the specificity of the catecholaminergic effects. The results showed that depending on the stimulus and the catecholamine concentration employed E and NE exert inhibitory (OKT3) or stimulatory signals (PWM) on lymphocyte proliferation. Inhibitory effects could be abolished by adding beta-antagonist, while stimulatory signals were diminished after addition of alpha1- of beta-antagonist. Patients with RA showed a significantly reduced density of beta2R compared to HD paralleled by a significantly reduced influence of catecholamines on lymphocyte function. The study demonstrates the intricate relationship between PBMC reactivity and catecholamine effects that are mediated via alpha1- and beta-adrenergic receptors. In this respect the reduced catecholamine response of PBMC from RA patients may contribute to the pathogenic process of RA.",

    "168": "Adrenergic systems are importantly involved in memory storage processes. As such, agents that alter adrenergic receptors, such as \"beta-blockers,\" also alter memory storage. However, the anxiety literature cautions that beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, such as propranolol, may have different behavioral effects with acute vs chronic dosing. The effects of chronic propranolol specifically on memory modulation are unknown. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of chronic propranolol on retention for an aversive task, in which there is endogenous adrenergic activation. Adult male ICR mice were given daily injections of one of four doses of propranolol (2, 4, 8, and 12 mg/kg) or 0.9% NaCl vehicle for 15 days prior to, and continuing during, behavioral tests of exploration and retention. Exploratory behavior, as an index of anxiety level, was measured in a conventional elevated plus-maze, whereas retention of an aversive experience was measured in a step-through inhibitory avoidance apparatus. Sensitivity to aversive footshock was also evaluated. Compared to controls, propranolol-treated mice showed a dose-dependent decrease in retention for the inhibitory avoidance task, but no effect on anxiety on the plus-maze or on footshock sensitivity. Taken together with results from previous studies, it is apparent that propranolol can have different behavioral effects when administered acutely vs chronically, and its chronic effects significantly impair memory storage processes. Since these drugs are typically used chronically, and often in older adults, they could contribute to functional memory impairments.", 
    "169": "Recent evidence indicates that the amygdala plays a role in modulating memory processes in other brain regions. For example, posttraining intra-amygdala infusions of amphetamine enhanced memory in both spatial and cued training water maze tasks; these tasks are known to depend on the integrity of the hippocampus and caudate nucleus, respectively. To determine whether this modulation is dependent on noradrenergic activation within a subregion of the amygdala (the basolateral nucleus), the present study examined the effects of posttraining microinfusions (0.2 microl) of norepinephrine or propranolol into the basolateral amygdala immediately following training in a spatial version of the water maze task. Rats received a four-trial training session on each of 2 consecutive days. On the third day, rats were given a 60-s probe test in the absence of a platform. Retention latencies obtained on the second training day revealed that norepinephrine dose-dependently enhanced retention for the location of the hidden platform. In contrast, propranolol significantly impaired retention. Probe trial analysis revealed that rats treated with 0.25 microg norepinephrine demonstrated a selective spatial bias for the training platform location relative to all other groups. These findings are consistent with others and support the view that the basolateral amygdala has a role in modulating memory storage by interacting with other brain regions.", 
    "170": "Calcicludine, a 60-amino acid protein isolated from the green mamba venom, has been recently identified as blocking a large set (i.e., L-, N- and P-type) of Ca2+ channels. The three-dimensional structure of calcicludine has been determined by NMR and molecular modeling using a data set of 723 unambiguous and 265 ambiguous distance restraints, as 33 phi and 13 chi1 dihedral angle restraints. Analysis of the 15 final structures (backbone root-mean-square deviation = 0.6 A) shows that calcicludine adopts the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor fold. Its three-dimensional structure is similar to that of snake K+ channel blockers dendrotoxins. Conformational differences with protease inhibitors and dendrotoxins are localized in the 3(10) helix and loop 1 (segments 1-7 and 10-19), the extremity of the beta-hairpin (segment 27-30), and loop 2 (segment 39-44). These regions correspond to the functional sites of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and dendrotoxins. The positioning of the N-terminal segment 1-7 relative to the rest of the protein is characteristic of calcicludine. The involvement of this segment and the positively charged K31 at the tip of the beta-hairpin in the biological activity of calcicludine is discussed.", 
    "171": "Hyperthyroid patients often suffer from impaired exercise capacity with dyspnoea. Two well established, non-invasive methods were used to evaluate the influence of hyperthyroidism on cardiopulmonary function.", 
    "172": "In 42 patients with hyperthyroidism we performed spirometry and cardiopulmonary exercise testing before and after 7 days of propranolol therapy as well as in euthyroidism.", 
    "173": "In hyperthyroidism reduced vital capacity and 1-second capacity were observed (95.5 +/- 2.4% vs 102.6 +/- 1.5%; p = 0.0087; 89.4 +/- 2.3% vs 95.2 +/- 2.2%; p = 0.0179). No changes showed during beta-blockade. At the anaerobic threshold reduced tidal volume and enhanced respiratory frequency were noted (1119.8 +/- 48.9 ml vs 1289.3 +/- 62.7 ml; p = 0.0227; 28.3 +/- 0.8 vs 25.4 +/- 0.9; p = 0.0012). A significant tachycardia could be shown. Impaired response to exercise in pulse and respiratory frequency were observed. Work at the anaerobic threshold was impaired in hyperthyroidism (70 +/- 5 watts vs 86.9 +/- 5.7 watts; p = 0.016) and did not change during propranolol therapy. Oxygen pulse at the anaeorbic threshold was reduced in hyperthyroidism (7.7 +/- 0.4 ml O2/beat vs 9.1 +/- 0.4 ml O2/beat; p = 0.0012) and increased with propranolol (8.9 +/- 0.4 ml O2/beat; p = 0.0001).", 
    "174": "In hyperthyroidism significant changes in cardiopulmonary function were noted at rest and exercise. High resting function and impaired response to exercise suggest a cardiopulmonary work with low efficiency. Propranolol leads to economization and lowers patients complaints.", 
    "175": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to slow the progression of chronic renal failure. However, the value of ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension in renal allograft recipients has not been established. ACE inhibitors dilate the efferent glomerular arteriole, an effect that may aggravate the decrease in glomerular filtration rate resulting from cyclosporine-induced vasoconstriction at the afferent glomerular arteriole. Therefore, the goal of this double-blind, randomized study was to compare the antihypertensive and renal effects of the ACE inhibitor quinapril with those of the beta-blocker atenolol in renal allograft recipients in whom hypertension developed 6 to 12 weeks after transplantation. All patients received cyclosporine as an immunosuppressant and had stable graft function (serum creatinine concentration, <220 micromol/L) at entry into the study. Twenty-nine patients who received quinapril (daily dose titrated between 2.5 and 20 mg) and 30 patients who received atenolol (daily dose titrated between 12.5 and 100 mg) completed the 24-month study. The two groups did not differ in age, sex ratio, height, and weight before entry into the study. Quinapril decreased diastolic blood pressure from 96+/-1 to 84+/-1 mm Hg (average throughout treatment period), and atenolol decreased diastolic blood pressure from 96+/-1 to 83+/-1 mm Hg. The serum creatinine concentration did not change significantly in either group after 24 months (129+/-8 micromol/L at entry and 148+/-19 micromol/L after 24 months in the quinapril group and 131+/-6 micromol/L at entry and 152+/-15 micromol/L after 24 months in the atenolol group; P=NS for both groups). After 24 months, the change in urinary albumin excretion from baseline was -10+/-15 mg/d in the quinapril group and 52+/-32 mg/d in the atenolol group (P=0.03). These results show that quinapril and atenolol are effective antihypertensive drugs when used after renal transplantation. Moreover, compared with atenolol, quinapril has no adverse effects on graft function. The relative reduction in albuminuria observed with quinapril as compared with atenolol could indicate a beneficial effect of quinapril on long-term graft function.", 
    "176": "We examined the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril, and a beta-blocker, propranolol, on cerebral arterioles in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). The structure and mechanics of cerebral arterioles were examined in untreated Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHRSP that were untreated or treated for 3 months with a high (2 mg/kg per day) or a low (0.3 mg/kg per day) dose of perindopril or propranolol (250 mg/kg per day) alone or in combination with the low dose of perindopril. We measured pressure, external diameter, and cross-sectional area of the vessel wall (CSA) in maximally dilated (with EDTA) cerebral arterioles. Treatment of SHRSP with the high dose of perindopril or the combination of propranolol and the low dose of perindopril normalized cerebral arteriolar mean pressure (50+/-1 [mean+/-SEM] and 43+/-2 mm Hg vs 50+/-1 mm Hg in WKY and 94+/-3 mm Hg in untreated SHRSP; P<0.05), pulse pressure (15+/-1 and 16+/-1 mm Hg vs 13+/-1 mm Hg in WKY and 35+/-1 mm Hg in untreated SHRSP; P<0.05), and CSA (1103+/-53 and 1099+/-51 microm2, respectively, vs 1057+/-49 microm2 in WKY and 1281+/-62 microm2 in untreated SHRSP; P<0.05). In contrast, treatment of SHRSP with the low dose of perindopril or propranolol alone did not normalize arteriolar pulse pressure (24+/-1 and 21+/-1 mm Hg) and failed to prevent increases in CSA (1282+/-77 and 1267+/-94 microm2). Treatment with either dose of perindopril or the combination of propranolol and perindopril significantly increased external diameter in cerebral arterioles of SHRSP (99+/-3, 103+/-2, and 98+/-3 microm vs 87+/-2 microm in untreated SHRSP; P<0.05), whereas propranolol alone did not (94+/-3 microm; P>0.05). These findings suggest that effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on cerebral arteriolar hypertrophy in SHRSP may depend primarily on their effects on arterial pressure, particularly pulse pressure, whereas their effects on cerebral arteriolar remodeling (defined as a reduction in external diameter) may be pressure independent.", 
    "177": "ATP-sensitive K+ channels (K(ATP)) are distributed in a variety of tissues including smooth muscle, cardiac and skeletal muscle, pancreatic beta-cells and neurons. Since K(ATP) channels are present in the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) pathway, the effect of potassium-channel modulators on the release of DA in the striatum of conscious, freely-moving rats was investigated. The extracellular concentration of DA was significantly decreased by the K(ATP)-channel opener (-)-cromakalim but not by diazoxide. (-)-Cromakalim was effective at 100 and 1000 microM concentrations, and the maximum decrease was 54% below baseline. d-Amphetamine significantly increased extracellular DA levels at the doses of 0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg, s.c. with a 770% maximum increase. (-)-Cromakalim had no effect on d-amphetamine-induced DA release, while glyburide, a K(ATP) blocker, significantly potentiated the effects of a low dose of d-amphetamine. These data indicate that K+ channels present in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminals modulate basal release as well as evoked release of DA."
