    "0": "Propranolol causes a massive leakage of potassium ions from red cells, which results in an alteration of the Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium across the red cell membrane. According to such a mechanism, the presence of propranolol significantly increases the hydrogen ion activity of the interior of the red cell, causing a decreased oxygen affinity of hemoglobin according to the classical Bohr effect. No release of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate which may be bound to the membrane is thus necessary to explain the effect of propranolol on the oxygen dissociation curve of blood.", 
    "1": "Catecholamines and propranolol were chemically bound to Sepharose and glass beads and washed extensively. The complexes were unstable and bound ligands were gradually released into the supernatants.", 
    "2": "To estimate the ultimate extent of myocardial damage during evolving myocardial infarction in conscious dogs and patients, we analyzed early serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) changes with nonlinear curve-fitting techniques. In experiments with dogs, serial serum CPK changes were fit to a log-normal function by the least squares method; the extent of the completed infarct was calculated by analysis of observed serum CPK changes and verified by measurement of myocardial CPK depletion 24 h after coronary occlusion. Early prediction of myocardial damage was based on projected serum CPK values from best fit curves based on data obtained during the first 5 h after initial elevation of enzyme activity. The correlation between predicted and observed values was close (r > 0.96, n = 11). In 11 additional conscious animals subjected to coronary occlusion, isoproterenol was administered continuously as soon as damage had been estimated from projected serum CPK values. The extent of the completed infarct was assessed by analysis of all serial serum CPK values and verified by analysis of myocardial CPK depletion 24 h after coronary occlusion. In each experiment the calculated completed infarct size exceeded infarct size projected before administration of isoproterenol (average increase = 44+/-10 [SE]%). When similar calculations were applied in experiments with eight dogs treated with propranolol, myocardial salvage was detected in 50% of the animals. In 30 patients with uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction the extent of the completed infarct, measured by analysis of CPK activity in serum samples obtained every 2 h, was compared with damage estimated from CPK values projected by the best fit log-normal curve derived from data obtained during the first 7 h after the initial serum CPK elevation. The estimate of damage based on early data correlated closely with the extent of infarction calculated from all available serial serum CPK values (r = 0.93, n = 30). Thus, the extent of the completed infarct could be estimated accurately during the early evolution of infarction. In patients with spontaneous extension of infarction manifested by chest pain and electrocardiographic changes, the calculated extent of the completed infarct exceeded that predicted. Conversely, salvage of myocardium, after reduction of myocardial oxygen requirements by administration of trimethaphan, was reflected by reduction of the extent of the calculated completed infarct with respect to that predicted from early serum CPK changes.", 
    "3": "The acute effects of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and isoproterenol on the plasma immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) response were studied in 13 550-600 kg cows. Catecholamines were infused for 7.0 min. During epinephrine infusions at 0.08 mumol/min iPTH increased from 0.48+/-0.12 (mean+/-SE, ng/ml) to 1.09+/-0.18 ng/ml (P < 0.02). Small increases in plasma free fatty acids and glucose could be detected with 0.08 mumol/min epinephrine; the iPTH response to epinephrine was as sensitive as the free fatty acid and glucose responses and possibly of physiological importance. Plasma calcium (total and ionized) and magnesium did not change. The responses were more pronounced at 0.8 mumol/min epinephrine with a mean iPTH increase from 0.49+/-0.16 ng/ml to 1.74+/-0.35 ng/ml (P < 0.01). Small decreases in plasma calcium occurred at 0.8 mumol/min epinephrine, but the plasma magnesium remained unchanged. However, when the plasma calcium was lowered with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N, N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a much more pronounced lowering of the plasma calcium was required to produce comparable increases of the plasma iPTH concentrations than when epinephrine was infused. It appears that epinephrine has a direct effect on the release of iPTH from the parathyroid glands. Simultaneous infusions of calcium and epinephrine suppressed the stimulation by epinephrine. This points towards a common mechanism of the regulation of parathyroid hormone secretion caused by decreases in the extracellular calcium concentration and/or alterations in the distribution of calcium within parathyroid cells following the administration of epinephrine. The iPTH response to epinephrine was suppressed in the presence of propranolol. Isoproterenol was less active in raising iPTH than epinephrine, and norepinephrine was the least active. The stimulation by isoproterenol and the suppression by propranolol suggest beta adrenergic receptor sites within the parathyroid glands.", 
    "4": "AH5158, a salicylamide derivative, said to be a blocker of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, has been studied in intact anaesthetized dogs. At a dose of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously, the drug increased cardiac output and caused a late fall in mean systemic and pulmonary arterial pressure. Coronary sinus flow increased, as did cardiac oxygen extraction. External cardiac efficiency decreased. Blood glucose and non-esterified fatty acid values increased, but cardiac extraction of these did not change."
