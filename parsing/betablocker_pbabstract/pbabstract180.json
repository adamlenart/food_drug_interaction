LA volumes were measured echocardiographically just before the time of mitral valve opening (V (max)), onset of atrial systole (p-wave at the electrocardiography = V (p)) and mitral valve closure (V (min)) according to the biplane area length method at baseline and in the 3rd month after the administration of beta blockers. NT-proBNP level was measured at the beginning and in the third month of beta blocker treatment. The first group was given carvedilol 6.25 mg/day, the second group was given 12.5 mg/day metoprolol succinate and it was increased to the tolerable maximal dose.",

    "4": "Chronic heart failure is an increasingly frequent clinical syndrome, characterized by reduced physical performance, dyspnea and an adverse prognosis. It is associated with age, indicating that it will become more common. Diagnosis requires the characterization of cardiac dysfunction and a precise definition of the underlying cardiac disease. Treatment guidelines of the cardiac societies, which were updated 2005, recommend therapy with ACE-inhibitors, AT1 receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists and digitalis. It is essential, however, to consider the individual circumstances such as underlying disease, age as well as the frequent complications and comorbidities.", 
    "5": "This national study examines the impact of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) on the prescribing of thiazide-type diuretics and other antihypertensive medications for patients with newly diagnosed hypertension. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from a national network of electronic health records for 2 groups with newly diagnosed hypertension and started on antihypertensive medications: one a year before and the other a year after the publication of ALLHAT. The percentage of new hypertensives started on thiazides increased from 29% pre-ALLHAT to 39% post-ALLHAT. An increase was also seen for angiotensin receptor blockers, while prescribing for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers declined. There was no significant change in prescriptions for alpha-blockers. Prescriptions for thiazides for patients with newly diagnosed hypertension increased after the publication of ALLHAT. Data from large national trials can have a considerable impact on prescribing practices.", 
    "6": "Beta-blockers with pharmacologic effects that differ from conventional agents might add to antihypertensive treatment options. This study evaluated a new once-daily formulation of the beta-/alpha1-blocker, carvedilol controlled-release (CR), in hypertensive patients off treatment or while still taking up to 2 (non-beta-blocker) agents. After a 4-week run-in phase, patients were randomized either to placebo (n=76) or carvedilol CR 20 mg (n=82), 40 mg (n=76), or 80 mg (n=86) once daily. After 6 weeks of treatment, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was repeated to measure the primary end point of changes in mean 24-hour diastolic blood pressure. During treatment, 24-hour diastolic blood pressure fell in the placebo and carvedilol CR 20-mg, 40-mg, and 80-mg groups by (mean +/- SE) 0.4+/-0.9, 4.4+/-0.9, 7.9+/-0.9, and 9.6+/-0.9 mm Hg, respectively (P< or =.001, trend test for all carvedilol CR doses with placebo). Corresponding 24-hour systolic blood pressure changes were 0.6+/-1.4, 6.8+/-1.3, 10.1+/-1.4, and 12.5+/-1.3 mm Hg, respectively (P< or =.001, trend test). Diastolic blood pressure trough-to-peak ratios (placebo-corrected) based on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (trough = mean of 20- to 24-hour post-dose readings; peak = mean of 3- to 7-hour post-dose readings) for 20-mg, 40-mg, and 80-mg doses were 0.73, 0.64, and 0.65, respectively. Adverse events, including clinical chemistry values, were similar in the drug-treated and placebo groups. Carvedilol CR has a clinically meaningful defined dose-dependent antihypertensive effect that persists throughout a 24-hour period.", 
    "7": "Increasing knowledge of the role of nitric oxide (NO) in physiology and disease has stimulated efforts to target the NO pathway pharmacologically. These therapeutic strategies include NO donors that directly or indirectly release NO and agents that increase NO bioactivity. Traditional organic nitrates such as nitroglycerin, which indirectly release NO, were believed to have limited long-term efficacy and tolerability, chiefly because of nitrate tolerance. Recent studies, however, suggest more effective ways of using these agents and new applications for them. Nicorandil, a hybrid organic nitrate that also activates potassium channels, has demonstrated significant benefits in acute coronary syndromes. Other nitrates are being investigated for use in neurodegenerative diseases. Direct NO donors include NO gas, which is useful in respiratory disorders, and the more recent classes of diazeniumdiolates, sydnonimines, and S-nitrosothiols. Preliminary data suggest that these agents may be effective as antiatherosclerotic agents as well as in other disease states. In addition, hybrid agents that consist of an NO donor coupled with a parent anti-inflammatory drug, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, have demonstrated enhanced efficacy and tolerability compared with the anti-inflammatory parent drug alone in diverse experimental models. Established drugs that enhance NO bioactivity include antihypertensive agents, particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and newer vasodilating beta-blockers. In addition, 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) promote NO bioactivity, both through and independent of lipid lowering. The NO-promoting actions of these established drugs provide some insight into their known benefits and suggest possible therapeutic potential.", 
    "8": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and reduction of elevated blood pressure significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular events. Endothelial dysfunction, which is characterized by impairment of nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, is an important risk factor for both hypertension and cardiovascular disease and may represent a major link between the conditions. Evidence suggests that NO plays a major role in regulating blood pressure and that impaired NO bioactivity is an important component of hypertension. Mice with disruption of the gene for endothelial NO synthase have elevated blood pressure levels compared with control animals, suggesting a genetic component to the link between impaired NO bioactivity and hypertension. Clinical studies have shown that patients with hypertension have a blunted arterial vasodilatory response to infusion of endothelium-dependent vasodilators and that inhibition of NO raises blood pressure. Impaired NO bioactivity is also implicated in arterial stiffness, a major mechanism of systolic hypertension. Clarification of the mechanisms of impaired NO bioactivity in hypertension could have important implications for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "9": "Women and the elderly are underrepresented in clinical trials of heart failure (HF). The authors analyzed, by sex and age groups, a registry of 4280 community patients initiating carvedilol for HF. Women (n=1485) were older than men (n=2793) and had worse functional class with higher left ventricular ejection fraction and blood pressure. Women also had more HF hospitalizations, less use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and lower doses of carvedilol. Nevertheless, during 1-year follow-up, both groups experienced greater than 40% reductions in HF hospitalizations (P<.001), with mortality of 7.3% in women vs 9.1% in men (P=.085). With increasing age, left ventricular ejection fraction, blood pressure, and functional class increased, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use and carvedilol doses decreased. HF hospitalizations fell at least 40% in all age groups after starting carvedilol (P<.001). Characteristics of women and the elderly with HF in the community suggest increased risk, but both populations respond well after initiating carvedilol.",

Although aortic root dilatation did not increase during pregnancy, three months after delivery, the patient noticed a pulsatile abdominal mass. Aortic aneurysm was diagnosed and surgical replacement of the infrarenal abdominal aorta to the common iliac arteries and reconstruction of the inferior mesenteric artery were performed. Moreover, the patient subsequently developed a Stanford type B thoracic aortic dissection, even after more than four months of beta-blockade.", 
    "11": "Inhalation of ammonia influences the activity of slowly adapting airway receptors (SARs), but the mechanism(s) is uncertain. Release of inflammatory mediators by transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor-1 (TRPV1) containing nerve endings could affect SAR response to ammonia. We examined how sensitization and subsequent desensitization of the TRPV1 by resiniferatoxin (RTX), affected the responses of SARs to inhaled ammonia. In pentobarbital-anesthetized, paralyzed and artificially ventilated rats, the left cervical vagus nerve was exposed, sectioned rostrally, and desheathed. Single fibers of SARs were identified and recorded. Two milliliters of ammonia vapor (from a 30% NH(4)OH solution) was inhaled over 20 s and responses to ammonia were measured. RTX was injected intravenously at 2 microg/Kg. Twenty minutes later, ammonia inhalation was repeated. Isoproterenol (ISO, 100 microg/kg, i.v.) was used in another set of experiments to block possible ammonia-induced bronchoconstriction. Ammonia increased tonic activity of SARs (n=10, P<0.0001), with complex changes in ventilator-related activity. SAR firing rate began to increase 2.3+/-0.2 min after RTX and returned to control levels at 13.6+/-1.4 min (n=10). By 20 min after RTX cardiovascular responses to ammonia were abolished, but effects on SAR activity were essentially unchanged. ISO did not modify the response of SARs to ammonia (n=8). These data suggest that responses of SARs to ammonia in rats do not depend on release of mediators by nerve endings containing TRPV1 and are not secondary to bronchoconstriction. However, when TRPV1 containing nerve endings were initially activated by RTX, the release of mediators may have affected SAR discharges.",

We reviewed the currently available evidence for the usefulness of beta-blockers in patients with hypertension and also assessed the efficacy of its use for other indications, like, chronic heart failure, stable angina, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias etc. The review of the currently available literature shows that for patients with uncomplicated hypertension, there is paucity of data or absence of evidence to support use of beta-blockers as monotherapy or as first line agent. Given the risk of stroke and numerous unacceptable adverse effects, the risk benefit ratio for beta-blockers is not acceptable for this indication. However, beta-blockers are very efficacious agents for the treatment of heart failure, certain types of arrhythmia, and post myocardial infarction. The various guideline committees should seriously reconsider their decision about their endorsement of beta-blockers as first line therapy for uncomplicated hypertension. However, this is applicable for hypertension and beta-blockers continue to be efficacious for other indications.",

Understanding pathophysiology and overall good prognosis forms the basis for medical treatment. Treatment is tailored by the presence or absence of outflow tract gradient and individual symptoms. In all patients, formal stratification for sudden death risk is necessary, with consideration of defibrillator implantation in patients deemed to be at high risk. In patients with no or only mild symptoms the approach of watchful waiting is often appropriate. For symptomatic patients with non-obstructed disease medical treatment with calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers is aimed to improve heart failure symptoms, and ischemia. Verapamil is the most often used, with likely benefit of relieving ischemia. Obstruction, most commonly due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM) and mitral-septal contact, occurs in >/=50% of all HCM patients, worsening symptoms and increasing mortality. Successful medical treatment of obstruction with negative inotropes slows acceleration of left ventricular ejection with delay in SAM, ultimately yielding a lower pressure gradient. Beta -blockers are the first line treatment in obstructive HCM predominantly by mitigating provocable gradients. The magnitude of symptom relief with verapamil is similar to the effect of beta -blockade. Disopyramide combined with beta -blockade is thought by some to be the most effective medical treatment of obstruction, and has been shown to be safe and not pro-arrhythmic. Most symptomatic HCM patients with significant obstruction at rest or provocation can be successfully managed with long-term medication alone.",

In addition to their cardioprotective effects, beta-blockers have been found to have neuroprotective effects on the central nervous system, but their effect on SCI has not yet been studied. In the current study, we investigated the effect of metoprolol on myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, a marker of neutrophil activation, in the spinal cord after experimental SCI in rats. Rats were divided into six groups: controls received only laminectomy and spinal cord samples were taken immediately; the sham operated group received laminectomy, and spinal cord samples were taken 4h after laminectomy; the trauma only group underwent a 50g/cm contusion injury but received no medication; and three other groups underwent trauma as for the trauma group, and received 30mg/kg methylprednisolone, 1mg/kg metoprolol, or 1mL saline, respectively. All the medications were given intraperitoneally as single doses, immediately after trauma. Spinal cord samples were taken 4h after trauma and studied for MPO activity. The results showed that tissue MPO activity increased after injury. Both metoprolol and methylprednisolone treatments decreased MPO activity, indicating a reduction in neutrophil infiltration in damaged tissue. The effect of metoprolol on MPO activity was found to be similar to methylprednisolone. In view of these data, we conclude that metoprolol may be effective in protecting rat spinal cord from secondary injury.",

Factors predicting SRC were identified, including high-dose corticosteroid administration. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) has dramatically impressed the prognosis of SRC, but it mortality rate is still high. Treatment aims at normalizing blood pressure as soon as possible.

    "95": "The vascular type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a rare genetic disease transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. It is distinguished from other forms of EDS by its unstable acrogeric morphotype and by vascular, gastrointestinal, and obstetrical complications. Diagnosis is based on various clinical signs, noninvasive imaging, and on the identification of a mutation of the COL3A1 gene, which provides diagnostic certainty but has a sensitivity of only 61%. When two major diagnostic criteria are present, a genetic test should be proposed, performed and its result presented in a multidisciplinary group. The precautionary principle requires that preventive measures be implemented when the diagnosis is suspected. All artery puncture, surgery, and gastrointestinal and uterine endoscopy are contraindicated, permissible only in life-threatening emergencies. Straining against a closed glottis and all other situations or drugs likely to raise blood pressure must be avoided. Contraception must be discussed to avoid pregnancy during the diagnostic period. Arterial lesions suggestive of the disease include dissecting aneurysms of the internal carotid and iliac arteries and of the anterior visceral branches of the abdominal aorta, fusiform aneurysms of the splenic artery, and early onset nontraumatic direct carotid-cavernous fistulae. Early-onset varicose veins, spontaneous peritonitis or unusually important perineal lesions after giving birth should also attract the physician's attention. Psychological treatment and support of patients and their families is essential, to help them both to live with their disease and to deal with the information and screening issues. The prognosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type, is grim but there is wide interindividual variability and life expectancy is best among patients receiving regular follow-up. Management by an experienced multidisciplinary team, implementation of drastic prevention measures and, depending on the results of the BBEST study, the possible prescription of beta-blockers should help to reduce the risk of complications and justify hope for a real improvement in prognosis in the near future.",

In this study we explored whether AT(2)R is expressed and functionally active on peripheral resistance arteries of hypertensive diabetic patients treated for 1 year with either the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan or the beta-blocker atenolol. Twenty-six hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients treated with oral hypoglycemic and antihypertensive agents (not receiving angiotensin receptor blockers or beta-blockers) were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment for 1 year with valsartan or atenolol once daily added to their previous therapy in a clinical trial that we reported recently and compared with 10 normal subjects. Resistance arteries dissected from gluteal subcutaneous tissues were assessed on a pressurized myograph. Vasomotor response curves to angiotensin II (1 nmol/L to 1 micromol/L) were performed on norepinephrine precontracted vessels in the presence of valsartan (10 micromol/L) with or without the AT(2)R inhibitor PD123319 (1 micromol/L). AT(2)R expression was evaluated by confocal microscopy. After 1 year of treatment, systolic and diastolic blood pressure was controlled and comparable in the valsartan and atenolol groups. Angiotensin II evoked a significant vasodilatory response only on resistance arteries from patients treated with valsartan, effect blocked by PD123319. AT(2)R expression was 4-fold higher in small arteries of valsartan-treated patients. In conclusion, AT(2)Rs are upregulated and contribute to angiotensin II-induced vasodilation in resistance arteries of hypertensive diabetic patients treated with angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers and may mediate, in part, vascular actions of these drugs in high cardiovascular risk patients.",

Carrageenan-induced TMJ hyperalgesia was assessed by measuring the behavioral nociceptive responses, such as rubbing the orofacial region and flinching the head, induced by the injection of a low dose of 5-hydroxytryptamine into the TMJ sensitized 1 h before by a TMJ injection of carrageenan. Blockade of prostaglandin synthesis by indomethacin prior to initiation of inflammation by carrageenan significantly attenuated the TMJ hyperalgesia. The guanethidine depletion of norepinephrine or the blockade of beta(2)but not the blockade of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor by the selective adrenoceptor antagonists ICI 118.55 and atenolol, respectively, significantly reduced carrageenan-induced TMJ hyperalgesia. In the present study, we further validated our carrageenan-induced TMJ hyperalgesia model to study the mechanisms involved in inflammatory TMJ hyperalgesia and to test the analgesic effect of different types of peripheral analgesics.

Multifractal spectrum, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) as well as the traditional time- and frequency-domain heart rate variability (HRV) parameters were compared before and after carvedilol therapy together with those in age and sex-matched normal control. The results showed that the multifractal spectrum tau(q) vs. q of N-N interval time series returned toward normal during carvedilol treatment. All the traditional HRV parameters and the short-term DFA improved significantly after 3 months of carvedilol therapy.",

The method was applicable in rat in situ intestinal permeability study to assess intestinal permeability of BPQ, a promising lead compound for Leishmania donovani infections. The method was validated on a C-4 column with mobile phase comprising ammonium acetate buffer (0.02 M, pH 3.5) and acetonitrile in the ratio of 30:70 (v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The retention times for atenolol, quinidine, propranolol, verapamil and BPQ were 4.30, 5.96, 6.55, 7.98 and 8.54 min, respectively. The calibration curves were linear (correlation coefficient > or =0.996) in the selected range of each analyte. The method is specific and sensitive with limit of quantitation of 15 microg/ml for atenolol, 0.8 microg/ml for quinidine, 5 microg/ml for propranolol, 10 microg/ml for verapamil and 200 ng/ml for BPQ. The validated method was found to be accurate and precise in the working calibration range. Stability studies were carried out at different storage conditions and all the analytes were found to be stable. This method is simple, reliable and can be routinely used for accurate permeability characterization.",

Nitric oxide (NO) is upregulated in the brain after hypoxia-ischemia and generally believed to exert a paradoxical effect on neurons, neurodestruction and neuroprotection, but it has not been demonstrated that NO is actually neuroprotective in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. We evaluated the effect of intracerebroventricular administration of nipradilol (3,4-dihydro-8-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylamino)-propoxy-3-nitroxy-2H-1-benzopyran), a potent NO donor, at various concentrations (0.1 muM to 1 mM in 5 mul PBS/brain) to neonatal rats with hypoxic-ischemic treatment. The extent of the infarct area in the brain was significantly reduced by injection of the 1 muM nipradilol solution. However, denitro-nipradilol (3,4-dihydro-8-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylamino)-propoxy-3-hydroxy-2H-1-benzopyran), that does not release NO, did not show the neuroprotective effect, suggesting that NO released from nipradilol exerts a neuroprotective effect on neonatal neurons.",

The ACC/AHA guidelines apply to all patients after MI and do not specify whether the recommended therapies are effective in post-MI patients with LVD or HE Reviewing the trials that included post-MI patients with LVD and/or HF, it appears that in some cases, only certain agents within a class have been evaluated (eg, post-MI beta-blocker trials often excluded patients with LVD, and the efficacy of atenolol has not been evaluated in post-MI patients with LVD or HF), and some agents have not shown as much efficacy as others in this high-risk patient population (eg, metoprolol appeared to be associated with poorer outcomes in this population than carvedilol).

Permeation was measured in a specially designed cell, dissolution took place in the apparatus 4, USP. In order to test the apparatus for its reproducibility and conclusiveness, different tablet strengths and varying release profiles of propranolol HCl tablets were produced and evaluated. It was shown that for both tablet species, immediate and extended release, the apparatus was able to measure permeation through Caco-2 monolayer as well as dissolution simultaneously with high precision and reproducibility. The permeated amount of the three immediate release tablets with increasing dosage strength showed linear dependency on the dosage strength. Furthermore, the effect of retarded release on permeation could be detected and conclusive data for dissolution and permeation were obtained. In summary, connecting cell culture based permeability assessment with compendial flow through dissolution equipment led to promising results and poses the base for more advanced studies for detecting influences of dosage forms on permeation process.",

This product is indicated for the treatment of elevated IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension (OH) who are insufficiently responsive to topical beta-adrenoceptor antagonist monotherapy. As such, it can be considered for use in individuals who, as a consequence of failing to achieve target IOP with beta-adrenoceptor antagonist monotherapy, require the addition or substitution of another class of topical antiglaucoma medication. Clinical trials have demonstrated that dorzolamide/timolol (1 drop per eye twice daily) is an effective and generally well tolerated fixed combination for lowering IOP in patients with open angle glaucoma or OH, including individuals uncontrolled on beta-adrenoceptor antagonist monotherapy. Compared with concomitant therapy with the individual components, the primary advantage of fixed combination dorzolamide/timolol is convenience.",

Drawing on comparison with the USA, it argues that, contrary to public expectation and perception, the aftermath of thalidomide did not give rise to strident British drug control, imposing the highest possible safety standards on the pharmaceutical industry. Rather, there existed a culture of reluctant regulation that was characterised by continued optimism about, and trust in the purported benefits of new drugs among manufacturers and regulators in the United Kingdom, together with commitment to the protection of the industry and its institutional support for the medical profession. In particular, British regulators were willing to allow new drugs on to the market, fully aware of uncertainty about their safety, but unwilling to be pro-active in issuing warning letters about risks and requiring 'certainty' before acting to withdraw a product. Even after the practolol disaster, the British system was unable to reform itself to construct more rigorous and pro-active monitoring of drug risks. This was because of conflicts with industry interests.",

However, symptoms and signs of hypersensitivity are not found in all patients. EM can lead to progressive myocardial damage with destruction of the conduction system and refractory heart failure. The present report describes three cases of biopsy-proven EM with different presentations, including acute coronary syndrome, cardiogenic shock and newly diagnosed heart failure. In one patient, hypersensitivity to sumatriptan was suspected to be the underlying cause. All patients responded well to treatment with steroids, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. There was a complete recovery of the ventricular function in all cases.", 
    "140": "Recent analyses suggest that about 67-68% of men with hypertension have some degree of erectile dysfunction (ED). With about 25 million men in the US with hypertension, substantial numbers of hypertension-related ED exist that tend to be of a more severe nature than the general population. Men with ED are also more likely to have hypertension. Thiazide diuretic and beta-blocker therapy may contribute to ED. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors are effective therapy in men with ED owing to hypertension who are taking antihypertensive medicines including those on multiple antihypertensive medicines. The addition of PDE5 inhibitors to usual common antihypertensive medicines (diuretics, beta blockers, calcium blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) results in either no or small additive reductions in blood pressure (BP) and no increase in serious clinical adverse events. There are however precautions regarding the use of PDE5 inhibitors in patients taking alpha blockers for either hypertension or benign prostatic hypertrophy, as some patients may develop orthostatic hypotension. Organic nitrates remain an absolute contraindication for PDE5 inhibitors because synergistic and symptomatic reductions in BP may occur in some patients with this drug combination.", 
    "141": "Pathological conditions such as coronary artery disease are clinically controlled via therapeutic regulation of platelet activity. Thrombin, through protease-activated receptor (PAR) 1 and PAR4, plays a central role in regulation of human platelet function in that it is known to be the most potent activator of human platelets. Currently, direct thrombin inhibitors used to block platelet activation result in unwanted side effects of excessive bleeding. An alternative therapeutic strategy would be to inhibit PAR-mediated intracellular platelet signaling pathways. To elucidate the best target, we are studying differences between the two platelet thrombin receptors, PAR1 and PAR4, in mediating thrombin's action. In this study, we show that platelet activation by PAR1-activating peptide (PAR1-AP) requires a phospholipase D (PLD)-mediated phosphatidic acid (PA) signaling pathway. We show that this PAR1-specific PA-mediated effect is not regulated through differential granule secretion after PAR-induced platelet activation. Perturbation of this signaling pathway via inhibition of lipid phosphate phosphatase-1 (LPP-1) by propranolol or inhibition of the phosphatidylcholine-derived phosphatidic acid (PA) formation by PLD with a primary alcohol significantly attenuated platelet activation by PAR1-AP. Platelet activation by thrombin or PAR4-AP was insensitive to these inhibitors. Furthermore, these inhibitors significantly attenuated activation of Rap1 after stimulation by PAR1-AP but not thrombin or PAR4-AP. Because PA metabolites such as diacylglycerol play an important role in intracellular signaling, identifying crucial differences in PA regulation of PAR-induced platelet activation may lead to a greater understanding of the role of PAR1 versus PAR4 in progression of thrombosis.", 
    "142": "The appropriate and timely evaluation and treatment of patients with severely elevated blood pressure is essential to avoid serious adverse outcomes. Most importantly, the distinction between a hypertensive emergency (crisis) and urgency needs to be made. A sudden elevation in systolic (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that is associated with acute end organ damage (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or renal) is defined as a hypertensive crisis or emergency. In contrast, acute elevation in SBP and/or DBP not associated with evidence of end organ damage is defined as hypertensive urgency. In patients with a hypertensive emergency, blood pressure control should be attained as expeditiously as possible with parenteral medications to prevent ongoing and potentially permanent end organ damage. In contrast, with hypertensive urgency, blood pressure control can be achieved with the use of oral medications within 24-48 hours. This paper reviews the management of hypertensive emergencies.", 
    "143": "Carvedilol is a third-generation beta(1)- and beta(2)-blocker that also possesses alpha(1)-adrenergic-blocking properties. This compound has: i) shown superior efficacy to certain other beta-blockers in heart failure, ii) can improve myocardial function (e.g., in myocardial infarction) and iii) is the only beta-blocker shown to significantly reduce mortality and morbidity (such as reinfarction and development of heart failure) in postmyocardial infarction patients with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD). The currently available preparation of carvedilol needs to be taken twice daily; however, studies have shown that the need for twice-daily dosing may decrease adherence. A once-daily formulation of carvedilol (controlled release) is expected to become available in 2007. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the new formulation are equivalent to the twice-daily formulation. A number of investigations have demonstrated equivalence between the twice-daily and once-daily formulations; thus, carvedilol controlled-release is expected to provide not only the same life-prolonging benefits of twice-daily carvedilol, but also the convenience of once-daily dosing.",

The prevalence of heart failure continues to increase, largely due to an aging population and to modern technologic innovations that have led to prolonged survival of the cardiac patient. Hypertension increases the risk for heart failure in all age groups. In those individuals aged 40 years or older whose blood pressure is > 140/90 mm Hg, the lifetime risk for developing heart failure may be twice as high as that of their aged-matched counterparts. Therefore, it is imperative that the clinician be aware of the current diagnostic and therapeutic advancements for the early detection and aggressive treatment of hypertension and heart failure, to prevent patients from developing symptoms of heart failure and to decrease the need for hospitalizations once the diagnosis is confirmed.",

    "155": "Functional optical imaging showed that odor or electric shock stimuli presented to the fly causes transient calcium influx into the two major axon branches of alpha/beta mushroom body (MB) neurons. One pairing of odor and electric shock stimuli or multiple, massed pairings did not alter odor-evoked calcium influx. In contrast, animals that received multiple, spaced pairings exhibited a robust increase in calcium influx into the MB axons when tested at 9 or 24 hr after training, but not at 3 hr. This modification occurred only in the alpha branch of the neurons and was blocked by mutation of the amnesiac gene, inhibition of protein synthesis, or the expression of a protein blocker of the transcription factor Creb. Thus, behavioral long-term olfactory memory appears to be encoded as a branch-specific modification of calcium influx into the alpha/beta MB neurons that occurs after spaced training in a protein synthesis-, Creb-, and amnesiac-dependent way.",

(13)C and (1)H NMR spectra of timolol, sorbic acid, and a mixture of the two were obtained, and the signal changes induced by pairing were observed. The carbon signals of the butylaminopropanol moiety of timolol were markedly shifted in the mixture, as were the carboxyl and conjugated carbons assigned to sorbic acid. The localizations of the changes in each molecule revealed the binding sites. The profiles of butylaminopropanol carbon chemical shifts plotted against a molar ratio of sorbate were synchronized, which suggested a single type of interaction with sorbic acid. The Job plot showed a typical pattern with a single-maximum at a mole function of 0.5, indicating the presence of a 1:1 complex of timolol and sorbic acid. The stability constants (K) of the timolol-sorbate and timolol-maleate pairs were 1.9x10(1) and 2.2x10(2)M(-1), respectively. The higher K value of the timolol-maleate interaction suggested that it was dominant to the timolol-sorbate interaction when maleate and sorbate coexisted within a timolol solution. Here, we demonstrated evidence of an interaction between timolol and sorbic acid using simple NMR measurements, which suggested the existence of ion pair formation derived from charge neutralization. Our analysis using NMR spectroscopy should advance the understanding and optimization of formulations that are based on ion pair.",

    "158": "The prognosis of heart failure in elderly patients is poor. The knowledge of the particular aspects of this pathology could certainly increase the prevention and the therapeutic approach of this disease. The presence of many precipitating factors and comorbidities is typical of this pathology. The clinical diagnosis is particularly difficult, especially because the signs and symptoms are similar to those of frequent disorders in elderly patients. Moreover, cognition and sensory impairments and the spontaneous reduction of the physical activity, masking symptoms, may also disturb the diagnosis. Diastolic heart failure, frequent in old patients, contributes sometimes to perturb the diagnosis. The treatment of heart failure in elderly people is based in first line on the control of the precipitating factors. The pharmacotherapy is not fundamentally different from the younger patient and must follow the recommendations of the literature (Evidence Based Medicine). The underutilization of proven therapy must indeed be avoided. However, the careful beginning, at very low doses, and a careful titration to obtain the recommended doses, is essential. Moreover, the susceptibility to side effects and the frequent contra-indications in the elderly require meticulous precautions in the prescription of the drugs. Diuretics remain the cornerstone to promptly control the pulmonary congestion and the edema. The angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, the antagonists of the angiotensin-receptors and the beta-blockers must be prescribed as in the younger patients. Digoxin plays also a role in several precise indications. Coronary angioplasty, heart surgery and technique of resynchronization have indications in certain cases.

    "167": "The vasorelaxant effect of cinnamaldehyde, one of the major oil components in Cinnamomi Cortex, was studied using isolated rat aorta. Cinnamaldehyde at final concentrations of 1 microM to 1 mM showed dose-dependent relaxation of the rat aorta contracted by treatment with prostaglandin F2alpha, norepinephrine or KCl. In addition, cinnamaldehyde relaxed prostaglandin F2alpha-precontracted aortic rings with endothelium and without endothelium, with the latter being significantly less sensitive than the former. Relaxation induced by cinnamaldehyde with endothelium was significantly inhibited by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), while nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin), beta-adrenergic receptor blocker (propranolol), an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (theophylline), a delayed rectifier K+ channel blocker (tetraethyl ammonium chloride), or an ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker (glibenclamide) did not reduce the relaxation induced by cinnamaldehyde with endothelium treated by L-NAME. Conversely, aorta pretreatment with L-NAME and theophylline increased the relaxation by cinnamaldehyde significantly compared to aorta pretreatment with only L-NAME. Furthermore, cinnamaldehyde significantly inhibited Ca2+-induced contraction. These results suggested that the vasorelaxant effects of cinnamaldehyde were derived from both endothelium-dependent and -independent effects. Endothelium-dependent relaxation is affected by nitric oxide, and one of the mechanisms of endothelium-independent relaxation is thought to be influenced by the blocking of Ca2+ channels.", 
    "168": "Neuroendocrine regulation of cardiac function involves a population of three types of beta-adrenoceptors (ARs). In various mammalian species, beta1- and beta2-AR stimulation produces an increase in contractility; whereas beta3-AR activation mediates negative inotropic effects. At the moment, nothing is known about the physiological role of beta3-AR in fish. Using an isolated working heart preparation, we show that a beta3-AR selective agonist BRL(37344) (0.1-100 nmol l(-1)) elicits a dose-dependent negative inotropism in the freshwater eel Anguilla anguilla. This effect was insensitive to the beta1/beta2-AR inhibitor nadolol (10 mumol l(-1)), but was blocked by the beta3-AR-specific antagonist SR(59230) (10 nmol l(-1)). The analysis of the percentage of stroke work (SW) variations, in terms of EC(50) values, induced by BRL(37344) alone (10 nmol l(-1)), and in presence of SR(59230) (10 nmol l(-1)), indicated a competitive antagonism of SR(59230). In addition to the classic positive inotropism, the non-specific beta agonist isoproterenol (100 nmol l(-1)) induced, in 30% of the preparations, a negative inotropic effect that was abrogated by pre-treatment with SR(59230), pointing to a beta3-mediated pathway. The BRL(37344)-induced negative inotropic effect was abolished by exposure to a G(i/o) proteins inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTx; 0.01 nmol l(-1)), suggesting a G(i/o)-dependent mechanism. Using L-N5(l-imino-ethyl)ornithine (L-NIO; 10 mumol l(-1)), as a nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) blocker and haemoglobin (Hb; 1 mumol l(-1)), as a NO scavenger, we demonstrated that NO signalling is involved in the BRL(37344)-induced response. Pre-treatment with either an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase (GC) 1H-(1,2,4) oxadiazolo-(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 10 mumol l(-1)), or an inhibitor of the cGMP-activated protein kinase (PKG) KT(5823) (100 nmol l(-1)), abolished the beta3-dependent negative inotropism, indicating the cGMP-PKG component as a crucial target of NO signalling. Taken together, our findings provide functional evidence for the presence of beta3-like adrenoceptors in the eel Anguilla anguilla heart identifying, for the first time in a working fish heart, the beta3-AR-dependent negative inotropy discovered in mammals.",

    "173": "The affinity and enantioselectivity have been determined for designed propranolol derivatives as ligands for Cel7A by capillary electrophoresis (CE) at pH 7.0. These results have been compared to measurements at pH 5.0. In agreement with previous studies, the affinity increased at the higher pH. However, the affinity was not as dependent of the ligand structure at pH 7.0 as at pH 5.0, and the selectivity was generally decreased. Instead, at pH 7.0, the changes in binding were mainly dependent on the presence of additional dihydroxyl groups, indicating an increased importance of the electrostatic interactions. To evaluate the pH dependent variations in binding, changes in both the ligand and in the enzyme had to be taken into account. To ensure that the ligands had the same charge in all measurements, pKa-values of all compounds were determined. The ligand-protein interaction has also been studied by inhibition experiments at both pHs to evaluate the specific binding to the active site when competing with the substrate p-nitrophenyl lactoside (pNPL). With support of docking computations we propose a hypothesis on the effect of the ligand structure and pH dependency of the binding and selectivity of amino alcohols to Cel7A.",

The results demonstrated that castration in early postnatal period lowers levels of both neurally- and thymocyte-derived noradrenaline in adult rats, and thereby diminishes beta-adrenoceptor-mediated fine tuning of the T-cell differentiation/maturation. In non-Cx rats P affected TCRalphabeta-dependent stages of thymocyte differentiation/maturation decreasing frequency of CD4+8+ double positive (DP) TCRalphabeta(low) cells entering selection processes and increasing relative number of positively selected DP TCRalphabeta(high) (most likely due to an increased thymocyte surface density of Thy-1 that is involved in negative control of TCRalphabeta-mediated signaling/selection thresholds) and the most mature CD4+8- TCRalphabeta(high) cells (including CD4+25+ regulatory cells).

We investigated the effect of celiprolol hydrochloride, a beta1 antagonist and mild beta2 agonist, on the lesions and function in type II male Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) diabetic rats. OLETF rats were fed regular chow with or without atenolol (25 mg/kg/day) or celiprolol (100 mg/kg/day) treatment (group DM, no treatment; group DM-a, atenolol treatment; group DM-c, celiprolol treatment), and treatment was continued for 31 days. Separately, normoglycemic control rats, LETO, were prepared as group C. On day 3, endothelial cells of the right internal carotid artery were removed by balloon injury, and the rats were evaluated 4 weeks after balloon injury. The plasma glucose and lipid levels were unchanged throughout the treatment period. Intimal thickening was observed in the right carotid artery in the DM and DM-a groups; however, little thickening was observed in those of DM-c rats. Acetylcholine-induced NO-dependent relaxation in arteries was improved in DM-c rats compared with DM and DM-a rats (maximum relaxation DM 30.8+/-4.5, DM-a 37.4+/-3.9, DM-c 48.8+/-4.6%, *P<0.05 vs. DM for DM-c rats). Tone-related basal NO release and acetylcholine-induced NO-dependent relaxation in the arteries and plasma NO(x) (sum of NO(2)(-) and NO(3)(-)) were greater in DM-c and C groups than in DM and DM-a groups.

    "184": "Our group previously discovered a novel hypocholesterolemic pentapeptide (IIAEK: Ile-Ile-Ala-Glu-Lys, or what we describe as \"lactostatin\") derived from bovine milk beta-lactoglobulin. To clarify the mechanism of the hypocholesterolemic action of lactostatin, we screened the target gene and signal transducing pathway induced by lactostatin in HepG2, a human liver cell line. Unexpectedly, we found that water-soluble lactostatin can activate cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) gene expression. Treatment with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor or calcium (Ca2+) channel blocker blocked this activation. We also found that lactostatin regulates the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Here, we show the involvement of a new regulatory pathway in the calcium-channel-related MAPK signaling pathway of lactostatin-mediated cholesterol degradation. Oligopeptide shows promise as a new molecule for the development of medicines and functional foods to prevent and improve hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.", 
    "185": "The FDA has published recommendations for sponsors who wish to request a waiver of in vivo bioavailability (BA) or bioequivalence (BE) studies for immediate release (IR) solid oral dosage forms based on the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS). Biowaivers can be requested for IR formulations in which the active ingredient is shown to be a BCS class I drug: that is, a drug showing high permeability and high solubility over a pH range of 1-7.5. For permeability determinations, a variety of experimental methods can be used, such as the rat in situ single pass perfusion or Caco-2 cell culture models, once the suitability of the particular method is established. Following the recommended procedure for assessing the suitability of permeability determinations, we determined the permeability of 20 test drugs using the in situ single pass perfusion model in rats. The test compounds were coperfused through jejunal intestinal segments with an internal permeability reference standard (metoprolol) over a 90 min time period. Sample analysis was performed by HPLC, and the ratio of the effective permeability, Peff (cm/s), of test compound to that of metoprolol was determined. To address the question of test drug permeabilities that approach that of the internal standard, we propose that a statistical analysis such as the \"0.8-1.25 rule\" used for in vivo or in vitro bioequivalence studies provide guidance for permeability classification using the in situ single pass perfusion model. We developed a method using the 90% confidence interval of the permeability ratio of the test to internal reference standard in order to differentiate between high and low permeability compounds. This analysis allowed for the proper permeability classification of all of the test compounds and suggests a robust means for assessing drug permeability classification.", 
    "186": "Sulfonylurea receptors (SURs) constitute the regulatory subunits of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (K(ATP) channels). SUR binds nucleotides and synthetic K(ATP) channel modulators, e.g. the antidiabetic sulfonylurea glibenclamide, which acts as a channel blocker. However, knowledge about naturally occurring ligands of SUR is very limited. In this study, we show that the plant phenolic compound trans-resveratrol can bind to SUR and displace binding of glibenclamide. Electrophysiological measurements revealed that resveratrol is a blocker of pancreatic SUR1/K(IR)6.2 K(ATP) channels. We further demonstrate that, like glibenclamide, resveratrol induces enhanced apoptosis. This was shown by analyzing different apoptotic parameters (cell detachment, nuclear condensation and fragmentation, and activities of different caspase enzymes). The observed apoptotic effect was specific to cells expressing the SUR1 isoform and was not mediated by the electrical activity of K(ATP) channels, as it was observed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing SUR1 alone. Enhanced susceptibility to resveratrol was not observed in pancreatic beta-cells from SUR1 knock-out mice or in cells expressing the isoform SUR2A or SUR2B or the mutant SUR1(M1289T). Resveratrol was much more potent than glibenclamide in inducing SUR1-specific apoptosis. Treatment with etoposide, a classical inducer of apoptosis, did not result in SUR isoform-specific apoptosis. In conclusion, resveratrol is a natural SUR ligand that can induce apoptosis in a SUR isoform-specific manner. Considering the tissue-specific expression patterns of SUR isoforms and the possible effects of SUR mutations on susceptibility to apoptosis, these observations could be important for diabetes and/or cancer research.",

Three assays were studied: individual rhCYP isozymes and corresponding coumarin derivative-probe substrates with fluorescent detection, human liver microsomes (HLM) and cocktail drug-probe substrates with LC-MS detection, and double cocktail rhCYP isozymes mix and drug-probe mix with LC-MS detection. Data comparisons showed that the rhCYP-fluorescent assay and the cocktail assay with HLM-LC-MS had weak correlation. Detection method and probe substrates were shown to not be the major cause of the disparity in IC(50)s. However, the enzyme source and composition (HLM versus, rhCYP) caused disparity in IC(50)s. Specifically, the high concentrations of CYP isozymes often used with HLM-based assays produced high probe substrate conversion and test compound metabolism, which should both contribute to artificially higher IC(50)s. Non-specific binding of substrate to higher concentration proteins and lipids in the HLM-based assays should also contribute to higher IC(50)s. The modified double cocktail assay was found to overcome limitations of the other two assays. It uses an rhCYP isozymes mix, drug-probe substrate mix, low protein concentration, and LC-MS detection. The double cocktail assay is sensitive, selective, and high throughout for use in drug discovery to provide an early alert to potential toxicity with regard to drug-drug interaction, prioritize chemical series, and guide structural modification to circumvent CYP450 inhibition.",
