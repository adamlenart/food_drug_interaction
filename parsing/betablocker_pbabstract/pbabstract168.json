Aim of this study is to estimate the protective effect of Nebilet for perioperative cardiac complications (nonfatal myocardial infarction and cardiac death) in patients which underwent recostructive vascular surgery. Patients were administrated Nebilet (2.5 to 7.5 mg/per day, according to arterial pressure and heart rates) 20 days before operation and 2 months after surgery. In early postoperative period we performed the control examinations: troponin T (1, 3, 7 days), ECG (1 day), echocardiography (1-2 day) and 2 months after operation (ECG and echocardiography). During whole follow up period we controlled in patients arterial pressure and heart rates.", 
    "1": "Early use of beta-blockers is a quality indicator for the treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), despite limited data from randomized clinical trials in this population. We sought to determine the impact of acute beta-blocker therapy on outcomes in patients with NSTEMI.", 
    "2": "We examined acute (<24 hours) beta-blocker use in 72,054 patients with NSTEMI from the Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes with Early Implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines (CRUSADE) initiative at 509 US hospitals from 2001-2004. We analyzed patient and provider factors associated with beta-blocker use and the impact of beta-blocker therapy on unadjusted, risk-adjusted, and propensity matched outcomes in the overall sample and among selected high-risk subgroups.", 
    "3": "A total of 82.5% of patients without documented contraindications received acute beta-blocker therapy. Factors strongly associated with acute beta-blocker use included prior beta-blocker use, higher presenting systolic blood pressure, lower heart rate, lack of signs of heart failure, and cardiology care. Acute beta-blocker use was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (unadjusted 3.9% vs 6.9%, P <.001, adjusted odds ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.60-0.72), lower adjusted mortality among most of 6 subgroups determined by propensity to receive acute beta-blockers, and lower adjusted mortality in patients with and without signs of heart failure and in those <80 years and those > or =80 years old.", 
    "4": "The majority of NSTEMI patients receive acute beta-blocker therapy. Certain patient subgroups remain undertreated. Because treatment with acute beta-blockers was associated with improved clinical outcomes in nearly all patient subgroups assessed, broader use in patients with NSTEMI appears warranted.", 
    "5": "Concerns persist about the validity of generalized transfer function-derived, aortic blood-pressure measurements during the administration of vasoactive agents in clinical trials. Hence, we compared this transfer-function method with another, which estimates aortic systolic pressure directly from the late systolic shoulder of the radial pressure wave, after administration of placebo, ramipril, or atenolol.", 
    "6": "We recorded radial pressure pulse waveforms, using a commercially available system, in 30 subjects with >or=1 coronary risk factor in an acute study of ramipril at 10 mg and atenolol at 100 mg. Directly recorded radial and derived aortic pressure pulse waveforms were examined individually and were ensemble-averaged, and the difference between radial and aortic pressure responses was examined.", 
    "7": "The late systolic shoulder response from radial waveforms was reduced by 15.8 mm Hg (SD, 12.2 mm Hg) more with ramipril than with atenolol. This was similar to a difference of 14.6 mm Hg (SD, 11.2 mm Hg) calculated for the aortic systolic pressure response using the transfer-function technique. Ramipril caused a greater reduction in the aortic systolic pressure response (22.2 mm Hg), whereas with atenolol, there was a modest decrease (7.6 mm Hg). The mean difference between aortic systolic pressures measured from direct radial waveforms and from derived aortic pressure between 3 and 5 h after dosing under all circumstances was 1.6 mm Hg (SD, 8.9 mm Hg).", 
    "8": "Central pressure derived from radial pressure waveforms using a generalized transfer function gave similar results for central pressure measured directly from radial waveforms. The hemodynamic benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, and calcium channel blocker over beta-blocker antihypertensive therapy in recent trials were confirmed by this study.", 
    "9": "The occurrence of the clinical manifestations of ischemic heart disease (IHD)--myocardial ischemia and angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death--is unevenly distributed during the 24 h with greater than expected events during the initial hours of the daily activity span and in the late afternoon or early evening. Such temporal patterns result from circadian rhythms in pathophysiological mechanisms plus cyclic environmental stressors that trigger ischemic events. Both the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of many, though not all, anti-ischemic oral nitrate, calcium channel blocker, and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist medications have been shown to be influenced by the circadian time of their administration. The requirement for preventive and therapeutic interventions varies predictably during the 24 h, and thus therapeutic strategies should also be tailored accordingly to optimize outcomes. During the past decade, two first generation calcium channel blocker chronotherapies have been developed, trialed, and marketed in North America for the improved treatment of IHD. Nonetheless, there has been relatively little investigation of the administration-time (circadian rhythm) dependencies of the PK and PD of conventional anti-ischemic medications, and there has been little progress in the development of new generation IHD chronotherapies. Available epidemiologic, pharmacologic, and clinico-therapeutic evidence demonstrates how the chronobiologic approach to IHD can contribute new insight and opportunities to improve drug design and drug delivery to enhance therapeutic outcomes.", 
    "10": "Serial neurohormones may serve as markers of efficacy of congestive heart failure (CHF) therapy. We measured serial plasma big-endothelin (Big-ET), ET-1, N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in 206 patients randomized to bucindolol or placebo in Beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST).", 
    "11": "Neurohormones were measured at baseline and 3 and 12 months. At baseline, BNP and Big-ET levels were greater in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV than in Class III patients (median 122 pg/mL versus 447 pg/mL, P = .001; and 20.0 pg/mL versus 9.9 pg/mL, P = .003), and in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < or = 20% compared with LVEF > 20% (median 211 pg/mL versus 99.1 pg/mL; and 12.9 pg/mL versus 8.0 pg/mL, both P = .003). Big-ET and BNP were the strongest predictors of the composite end point of CHF hospitalization or death. LVEF at 12 months correlated inversely with 12-month BNP levels (r = -0.41, P = .0001). Bucindolol had no effect on neurohormones except that bucindolol treated patients had lower Big-ET levels at 3 months than patients receiving placebo (median 9.1 pg/mL versus 10.9 pg/mL, P = .05). A decline in ET-1 was associated with increased risk of the composite endpoint.",

    "13": "With the rise in the use of device therapy implants, we are better identifying appropriate chronic heart failure patients for primary implantable defibrillator therapy who are at risk of ventricular arrhythmia. As our knowledge expands, however, controversial issues emerge. Guidelines have been endorsed by the major international societies, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the European Society of Cardiology. In view of certain variances in recommendations and new data, a recent joint guideline statement has been issued from these 3 societies regarding management of ventricular arrhythmia and preventing sudden cardiac death in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. In this review, the recent joint statement is compared with those from the Heart Failure Society of America (Heart Failure Practice Guidelines 2006) and ACC/AHA (Heart Failure Guidelines 2005), with a special emphasis on new expanded criteria for primary prevention in both ischemic and nonischemic heart disease. In addition, the authors review current guidelines for electrophysiology testing in chronic left ventricular dysfunction and the emerging role of microvolt T-wave alternans as a means of risk stratification.", 
    "14": "Approximately 90% of all ophthalmic drug formulations are now applied as eye-drops. While eye-drops are convenient and well accepted by patients, about 95% of the drug contained in the drops is lost due to absorption through the conjunctiva or through the tear drainage. A major fraction of the drug eventually enters the blood stream and may cause side effects [J.C. Lang, Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 16 (1995) 39-43; C. Bourlais, L. Acar, H. Zia, P.A. Sado, T. Needham, R. Leverge, Prog. Retinal Eye Res. 17 (1998) 33-58; M.P. Segal, FDA Consumer Mag. (1991)]. The drug loss and the side effects can be minimized by using microemulsion-laden soft contact lenses for ophthalmic drug delivery [D. Gulsen, A. Chauhan, Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 45 (2004) 2342-2347; D. Gulsen, A. Chauhan, Abstr. Pap. Am. Chem. Soc. 227 (2004) U875]. In order for microemulsion-laden gels to be effective, these should load sufficient quantities of drug and should release it a controlled manner. The presence of a tightly packed surfactant at the oil-water interface of microemulsions may provide barrier to drug transport, and this could be used to control the drug delivery rates. In this paper we focus on trapping ethyl butyrate in water microemulsions stabilized by Pluronic F127 surfactant in 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) gels and measuring the transport rates of timolol, which is a beta-blocker drug that is used for treating a variety of diseases including glaucoma. The results described here show that microemulsion-laden gels could have high drug loadings, particularly for drugs such as timolol base which can either be dissolved in the oil phase or form the oil phase of the microemulsions. However, the surfactant covered interface of the Pluronic microemulsions does not provide sufficient barrier to impede the transport of timolol, perhaps due to the small size of this drug.",

    "16": "A total of 110 patients with POAG (52 men and 58 women) were included in the study. All the patients were divided into four subgroups based on the refractive error. The visual field of all the included patients was assessed by an Octopus 30 degrees central visual field every 6 months, for a total of 837 visual fields examined. The resulting data were analyzed by PERIDATA for Windows 1.7 TREND function. Mean defect (MD) and loss variance (LV) were considered for the analysis.", 
    "17": "At the first examination, 82% of eyes showed a global decrease of differential light sensitivity (MD >2 dB) and in 67% the distribution of the defect was nonhomogeneous (LV >6 dB). The analysis of variance for subgroups showed a more significant decrease of MD in highly myopic patients. A linear regression analysis highlighted a statistically significant change in time of MD in 36% and of LV in 34% of the eyes studied. Highly myopic patients had the highest (p<0.01) percentage of change of MD and LV (46% and 42%, respectively). Among the four subgroups, there was no difference in progression of MD decrease in time.", 
    "18": "These results showed that after 5 years of glaucoma, the visual field was altered in most of the eyes examined (82%) and that in 67% of cases, its defect was nonhomogeneous and worsened with the increase of myopia. The regression linear analysis of visual field changes in time showed a progressive increase of MD and LV in approximately one third of all the eyes examined.", 
    "19": "The effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) on adrenal glucocorticoid secretion are controversial, and we have investigated this issue in guinea pigs, where, like in humans and cows, the main glucocorticoid hormone is cortisol. In vivo experiments showed that prolonged NPY administration markedly lowered cortisol plasma concentration not only in normal guinea pigs, but also in animals whose hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and renin-angiotensin system had been pharmacologically interrupted by the simultaneous administration of dexamethasone and captopril. In vitro experiments ruled out the possibility that in vivo glucocorticoid anti-secretagogue action of NPY can ensue from a direct effect on the adrenal gland. In fact, NPY did not affect cortisol secretion from dispersed guinea pig inner adrenocortical cells. In contrast, NPY raised cortisol production from adrenal slices containing medullary tissue, and this effect was blocked by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist l-alprenolol. This finding, coupled with the demonstration that NPY enhanced catecholamine release from guinea pigadrenomedullary tissue, strongly suggests that NPY may stimulate glucocorticoid secretion in this species through an indirect mechanism involving catecholamines, that in a paracrine manner promote the secretion of inner adrenocortical cells. In light of these observations, the conclusion is drawn that the in vivo effects of NPY are mediated by mechanism(s) independent of either the suppression of the main adrenal agonists ACTH and angiotensin-II or the direct inhibition of adrenal secretion. The possibility merits an investigation into whether NPY enhances the production of peptides, which, like leptin, inhibit adrenal glucocorticoid secretion acting as circulating hormones.", 
    "20": "Polymorphisms Arg(16)Gly and Gln(27)Glu of the gene of adrenoreceptor beta(2)(ADRB2) are associated with altered sympathetic responses. This study evaluated the relationship between these polymorphisms and changes in lipids induced by metoprolol in hypertensive patients. 105 adults were enrolled. After serum lipid levels and genotype had been determined, metoprolol was administered orally. Genotyping was performed using a mini-sequencing technique. Allelic and genotypic frequencies were: Arg(16) (49.5%); Gly(16) (50.5%); Gln(27) (89%); Glu(27) (11%); Arg(16)Arg (28.6%); Arg(16)Gly (41.9%); Gly(16)Gly (29.5%); Gln(27)Gln (81%); Gln(27)Glu (16.1%), and Glu(27)Glu (2.9%). Ninety patients concluded the study. There were no significant differences between the demographic, pharmacological and biochemical variables evaluated, grouped by their genotype in positions 16 and 27 of the ADRB2 gene. We did not find differences in lipid profiles in the whole group, but when we compared these profiles within each genotypic subgroup, we found that total cholesterol diminished (p = 0.03) in the patients with the native Gln(27)Gln genotype, whereas in the Gln(27)Glu heterozygous triglycerides increased (p = 0.025). We only found 3 patients homozygous for Glu(27)Glu and 2 of them were treated with diet and antidyslipidemic drugs. These results suggest that the polymorphism of codon 27 constitutes the target of the changes in lipids induced by beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists.", 
    "21": "A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether prophylactic beta-blockers effectively reduces the incidence of atrial fibrillation post-cardiac surgery. Altogether 113 papers were found using the reported search, of which 8 represented the best evidence on this topic. The author, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses were tabulated. We conclude that prophylactic beta-blockers clearly reduce the incidence of AF with a number needed to treat of only seven to prevent one episode of AF. The optimal beta-blocker or the benefits to patients with impaired ejection fraction are less clear.", 
    "22": "Preoperative beta-blockade in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has recently been shown to be beneficial in improving the early outcomes after surgery. We aimed to quantify the effect of preoperative beta-blockade on outcomes in our own patient population. We performed a retrospective analysis on CABG patients identified from our prospectively collected cardiac surgery database. Logistic regression was used to adjust in-hospital outcomes for differences in patient and disease characteristics. Treatment selection bias was controlled by deriving a propensity score for beta-blocker therapy. Consecutive patients (4381) underwent CABG on cardiopulmonary bypass between 1 April 1997 and 31 March 2002, with 2836 (64.7%) on preoperative beta-blocker therapy. After adjustment with the propensity score, beta-blocker therapy was significantly associated with a reduction in post-operative stroke (adjusted OR 0.59, p=0.011). The incidence of atrial arrhythmia was significantly increased in patients who had received preoperative beta-blockers (adjusted OR 1.21, p=0.011). There were no significant differences in operative mortality or other morbidity outcomes. Preoperative beta-blocker therapy significantly reduces the incidence of post-operative cerebrovascular events in patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass surgery.", 
    "23": "The present study investigates adrenergic regulation of the systemic and pulmonary circulations of the anaesthetised South American rattlesnake, Crotalus durissus. Haemodynamic measurements were made following bolus injections of adrenaline and adrenergic antagonists administered through a systemic arterial catheter. Adrenaline caused a marked systemic vasoconstriction that was abolished by phentolamine, indicating this response was mediated through alpha-adrenergic receptors. Injection of phentolamine gave rise to a pronounced vasodilatation (systemic conductance (G(sys)) more than doubled), while injection of propranolol caused a systemic vasoconstriction, pointing to a potent alpha-adrenergic, and a weaker beta-adrenergic tone in the systemic vasculature of Crotalus. Overall, the pulmonary vasculature was far less responsive to adrenergic stimulation than the systemic circulation. Adrenaline caused a small but non-significant pulmonary vasodilatation and there was tendency of reducing this dilatation after either phentolamine or propranolol. Injection of phentolamine increased pulmonary conductance (G(pul)), while injection of propranolol produced a small pulmonary constriction, indicating that alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptors contribute to a basal regulation of the pulmonary vasculature. Our results suggest adrenergic regulation of the systemic vasculature, rather than the pulmonary, may be an important factor in the development of intracardiac shunts.", 
    "24": "A large body of evidence corroborates the notion that deficiencies of serotonergic system are likely involved in the pathogenesis of both depression and anxiety. Activation of beta(3) adrenoceptors has been shown to increase brain tryptophan content suggesting an elevation of brain serotonin (5HT) synthesis. SR58611A is a selective beta(3) adrenergic agent possessing a profile of antidepressant activity in routine rodents' experimental models of depression. The present study was undertaken to evaluate in rodents the antidepressant properties of SR58611A and to assess its putative anxiolytic value in experimental models of depression and anxiety. Compared to the control group, SR58611A (0.1, 1, 5 or 10 mg/kg) caused a dose-dependent reduction in immobility of Wistar male rats in the forced swim test. The maximum dose appeared to be equivalent to an effective dose of clomipramine (50 mg/kg). In addition, acute injection of SR58611A induced in rats a dose-dependent decrease in grooming response to a novel environment (novelty-induced grooming test). For any dose, the effect was lower than that of diazepam (1 mg/kg). Chronic treatment with SR58611A resulted also in an increased social interaction time in the social interaction test without affecting motor activity of rats. Furthermore, similarly to diazepam a chronic treatment with the highest doses of SR58611A was followed by increased exploratory behavior in Swiss male mice exposed to the elevated plus maze test. These effects are mediated by beta(3) adrenoceptors since i.p. pretreatment with the selective beta(3) adrenoceptor antagonist SR59230A (5 mg/kg) blocked the effects of SR58611A. Finally, also the 5HT antagonist methysergide (2 mg/kg) prevented the antidepressant and anxiolytic-like activity of SR58611A indicating that 5HT transmission is strictly involved in its action.", 
    "25": "Congenital loss of function and drug-induced inhibition of the slowly-activating delayed-rectifier K(+) current (I(Ks)) cause impaired cardiac repolarization. beta-Adrenergic-receptor stimulation contributes to sympathetically-induced torsades de pointes (TdP). An in vivo model of long-QT1 (LQT1) syndrome and TdP in a species with I(Ks) characteristics relevant to man is lacking. We investigated the in vivo mechanisms of TdP in a novel canine model of drug-induced LQT1 syndrome.", 
    "26": "Adult beagle dogs (n=30; F/M) were anesthetized with lofentanil (0.075 mg/kg i.v.) and etomidate (1.5 mg/kg/hour). ECGs, left- (LV) and right-ventricular (RV) monophasic action potentials (MAPs), and intracavitary pressures were recorded simultaneously. Infusion of the I(Ks) blocker HMR1556 (0.025-0.050 mg/kg/min) mimicked LQT1, and bolus injections of isoproterenol (1.25-5 microg/kg) reproducibly triggered TdP in 94% of dogs (defibrillated if necessary).", 
    "27": "Isoproterenol evoked paradoxical repolarization prolongation during heart rate accelerations. Beat-to-beat variability [QT, LV MAP duration (MAPD(90))] and spatial dispersion of repolarization (T(peak)-T(end) interval, endo-minus epicardial MAPD(90), LV-RVMAPD(90)) were significantly increased. Early afterdepolarizations occurred predominantly in the endocardium and not the epicardium. During isoproterenol, secondary systolic contractions (aftercontractions; peak 25+/-6 mm Hg) arose in the LV (not RV) when TdP ensued. Prevention of TdP by esmolol (1.25 mg/kg), verapamil (0.4 mg/kg) or mexiletine (5 mg/kg) was only successful when repolarization prolongation was contained and aftercontractions remained absent.", 
    "28": "beta-Adrenergic challenges trigger TdP in a reproducible manner in this model of drug-induced LQT1. Paradoxical prolongation and increased temporal and spatial dispersion of repolarization precipitate TdP. Incremental LV systolic aftercontractions precede TdP, suggesting abnormal cellular Ca(2+) handling contributes to the arrhythmogenic mechanism.",

    "30": "The prevalence of hypertension in blacks in the United States is among the highest in the world. Compared with whites, blacks develop hypertension at an earlier age, their average blood pressures are much higher and they experience worse disease severity. Consequently, blacks have a 1.3 times greater rate of nonfatal stroke, 1.8 times greater rate of fatal stroke, 1.5 times greater rate of heart disease death, 4.2 times greater rate of end-stage kidney disease, and a 50% higher frequency of heart failure; overall, mortality due to hypertension and its consequences is 4 to 5 times more likely in African Americans than in whites. The increased prevalence of hypertension and excessive target organ damage is due to a combination of genetic and, most likely, environmental factors. There are no clinical trial data at present to suggest that lower-than-usual BP targets should be set for high-risk demographic groups such as African Americans. The primary means of prevention and early treatment of hypertension in African Americans will be the appropriate use of lifestyle modification. The International Society of Hypertension in Blacks guidelines realize that most patients will require combination therapy, many of them first-line, to reach appropriate BP goals. Although certain classes and combinations of antihypertensive agents have been well-established to be effective, the choice of drugs for combination therapy in African American patients may be different. Within the African American group, the responsiveness to monotherapy with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta blockers may be less than the responsiveness to diuretics and calcium channel blockers, but these differences are corrected when diuretics are added to the neurohormonal antagonists. Of note, African American patients with systolic BP >15 mm Hg or a diastolic BP >10 mm Hg above goal should be treated with first-line combination therapy.", 
    "31": "The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of an alpha,beta-blocker, amosulalol hydrochloride, were investigated in mice. After intravenous administration (10 mg/kg), the plasma concentration of the unchanged drug declined biphasically, with a terminal half-life of 1.1 h. The maximum plasma concentrations were reached at 0.25 h after oral administration, and then declined with apparent half-lives of 0.8-1.3 h. The systemic bioavailability of a 10-mg/kg dose was 38.7%. The area under the plasma concentration curve increased more than proportionally to the dose, which suggests metabolic saturation. After oral and intravenous administrations of (14)C-labelled amosulalol hydrochloride, 64.7% and 81.0% of the radioactivity were recovered, respectively, in the urine within 48 h. HPLC-UV and LC/MS analyses demonstrated that the major urinary metabolite was the glucuronide of M-2 (desmethyl metabolite at the o-methoxyphenoxy group) followed by M-5, the M-3 glucuronide, and the M-4 glucuronide, in that order. In the bile sample, amosulalol carbamoyl glucuronide was found as a new metabolite of this drug.", 
    "32": "The QT interval is a predictor of sudden death. Many drugs prolong the QT, primarily through I(Kr) block. Autonomic tone directly affects heart rate and ventricular repolarization, but its effects in the setting of I(Kr) block are unknown.",

    "34": "Healthy adults (n = 9) were administered ibutilide with ECGs obtained at regular intervals. On a separate day, subjects were administered intravenous propranolol and atropine to induce autonomic block, resulting in intrinsic heart rate and QT interval; ibutilide was administered again, with serial ECGs obtained at regular intervals. No differences in baseline RR, QT, or QTc intervals were seen between the two study days. Ibutilide in the setting of intact autonomic tone prolonged QTc by 43 +/- 8 msec (P = 0.001) and prolonged RR interval by 93 +/- 39 msec (P = 0.04). Autonomic block alone on the second day prolonged QTc by 16.7 +/- 9.4 msec (P = 0.02). An additional 68 +/- 5 msec prolongation of QTc was seen with ibutilide in the setting of double autonomic block (P = 0.036). There was no effect of ibutilide on intrinsic heart rate (P = 0.125).", 
    "35": "Autonomic block results in an exaggeration of drug-induced QT prolongation by ibutilide. I(Kr) block has no effect on intrinsic heart rate. QT-prolonging drugs may have more deleterious effects in those with underlying autonomic dysfunction, thus increasing the risk for sudden death.", 
    "36": "Renal nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced form (NADPH) oxidase is an important source of oxidative stress and its expression is enhanced in the glomerulus and distal tubules of diabetic nephropathy. High glucose-induced protein kinase C signalling or renal angiotensin II signalling increases the membrane translocation of cytosolic component p47phox. NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the podocytes damage the glomerular basement membrane and the slit diaphragm causing proteinuria, and mesangial and glomerular endothelial NADPH oxidase increase TGF-beta and cause collagen and fibronectin accumulation. Tubular NADPH oxidase stimulated by angiotensin II or aldosterone contributes to sodium retention and to tubulointerstitial damage. Thus, inhibition of the renal renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker or selective aldosterone inhibitor indirectly suppresses NADPH oxidase reducing renal ROS, proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. Statins are also effective in blocking the membrane translocation of Rac, especially in diabetes with hypercholesterolemia where ROS is produced by the intrinsic NADPH oxidase and by the activated macrophages. A medical herb, picrorhiza, inhibits the membrane translocation of p47phox, is a specific inhibitor of NADPH oxidase and, more so than superoxide dismutase mimetics, may be a promising strategy for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "37": "The purpose of the study was to evaluate the influence of metoprolol succinate and carvedilol on the physical ability (FA) of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) of different etiologies. The subjects of the study were 108 patients with postinfarction cardiosclerosis and 39 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy with I to V functional class (FC) CHF and left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 45%. The dynamics of functional parameters were assessed after 6 to 12 months of carvedilol therapy (57 patients) or metoprolol (81 patients) therapy. Therapy with beta-adrenoblockers resulted in a significant decrease in CHF FC (by 0.80 +/- 0.57; p < 0.05), an increase in the distance of six-minute walking test (by 110.7 +/- 86.5 m; p < 0.001) and everyday activity according to DASI questionnaire. The improvement was more substantial in patients with non-ischemic CHF. Peak oxygen consumption during treadmill test did not change, but CO2 ventilatory equivalent increased. The results demonstrate that carvedilol and metoprolol improve subjective and submaximum parameters of the functional status of patients with CHF without changing maximal FA.", 
    "38": "The applicability of dual injection CE for affinity selection of biopolymers that contain multiple binding sites is demonstrated. The efficient analysis of biomolecules such as carbohydrates and proteins, as well as pharmaceuticals by CE requires the reduction or elimination of nonspecific interactions with the capillary surface. Phospholipids are integral components of cell membranes and aqueous phospholipid liquid crystals adopt a bilayer structure on fused-silica. This phospholipid surface does not interact significantly with the following biomolecules: serum albumin, the 96-110 heparin binding domain of amyloid precursor protein (APP), polydisperse glycosaminoglycans, and variable chain-length oligosaccharides. Pharmaceuticals including five anionic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, three cationic analgesics, and two cationic beta-blockers, also show minimal interaction with the surface. In addition, the use of a phospholipid coating suppresses EOF, which enables reversed-polarity separations, dual opposite injection CE, affinity screening via CE by dual opposite injection, and serial target-ligand injections.",

It may be explained by a dynamic proximal shunt stenosis of the synthetic conduit that links the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, as detected by echo cardiographic study. The use of beta-blockers in the post-operative period has been recently described in order to improve the arterial oxygen saturation. In this report, we describe the use of propranolol in two patients undergoing Sano modification of the Norwood procedure, in whom a gradient reduction in the synthetic conduit, increase in the levels of arterial oxygen saturation, decrease in heart rate, and increase in blood pressure were observed, thus resulting in clinical improvement. We conclude that the use of beta-blockers in these cases was beneficial.", 
    "46": "Nebivolol is a beta1-adrenergic receptor antagonist that also reduces blood pressure by evoking endothelial NO production and vasodilation. We aimed at assessing whether nebivolol induces NO production also in the heart and delineating the molecular mechanisms involved. Using the fluorescent probe diaminofluorescein, we found that nebivolol induces a dose-dependent NO production in the heart, statistically significant already at 10(-7) mol/L. It is not an effect because of the blockade of beta1-adrenergic receptor, because this effect is not shared by another drug of the same class, atenolol. Because nebivolol has been reported to act as an agonist on other beta-adrenergic receptors, we tested NO production in the presence of receptor antagonists. Nebivolol was not able to induce NO production in presence of the beta3-antagonist SR59230A, indicating a fundamental role for beta3-adrenergic receptors in cardiac NO production by nebivolol. Moreover, inducible NO synthase inhibition abolishes NO release in the heart, indicating that nebivolol induces NO production by acting on the inducible isoform of the enzyme. The action of nebivolol on inducible NO synthase was confirmed by real-time PCR experiments, showing cardiac overexpression of inducible NO synthase but not neuronal NO synthase or endothelial NO synthase, after 5 hours of treatment with nebivolol. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that nebivolol also stimulates NO production in the heart. This action of nebivolol is exerted via a signaling pathway starting from the activation of beta3-adrenergic receptors and leading to overexpression of inducible NO synthase. Cardiac NO production by nebivolol could participate in the cardiovascular effects of nebivolol treatment in patients affected by hypertension and heart failure.",

In time-dependent Cox analyses, absence of in-treatment LV hypertrophy was associated with a decreased risk of SCD: every 1-SD-lower in-treatment CP (1050 mm x ms) was associated with a 28% lower risk of SCD (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.79) and 1-SD-lower SLV (10.5 mm) with a 26% lower risk (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.84). After adjustment for time-varying systolic and diastolic blood pressures, treatment allocation, age, gender, baseline Framingham risk score, ECG strain, heart rate, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, smoking, diabetes, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and occurrence of myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and noncardiovascular death, both in-treatment CP and SLV remained predictive of SCD: each 1-SD-lower CP was associated with a 19% lower risk of SCD (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.90) and 1-SD-lower SLV with an 18% lower risk (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.98).

The tests were performed in normal individuals and patients in the first phase. Only patients underwent the same tests in the second phase.

Rest and ambulatory HR were higher in patients and decreased under propranolol. The 24 hours systolic and diastolic BPs were lower in patients, and their values increased under propranolol. Heart rate decreasing and epinephrine levels reduction were positively correlated. No correlation was found between BP increase and catecholamine levels.",

The IgG from control patients and 32 previously anti-beta1-EC(II)-negative patients (17 ICM/15 DCM) did not significantly affect cAMP. Surprisingly, our technology detected anti-beta1-Abs in 23 DCM patients formerly judged antibody-negative, but their cAMP signals were generally lower (31.3 +/- 6.8%) than in the previous group. \"Low\"-activator anti-beta1-Abs were blocked preferentially by peptides corresponding to the first, and \"high\"-activator anti-beta1-Abs by peptides corresponding to the second beta1-extracellular loop.

    "64": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of imperatorin on vasodilatation and its possible mechanisms. Isometric tension of rat mesenteric arterial rings was recorded by a myograph system in vitro. The results showed that imperatorin at more than 10 muM concentration-dependently relaxed rat mesenteric arteries pre-contracted by potassium chloride (KCl) and endothelin-1, and human omental arteries pre-contracted by noradrenaline and U46619. Removal of the endothelium did not affect imperatorin-induced relaxant responses, suggesting that the vasodilatation effect is independent of the endothelium. Co-incubation with imperatorin resulted in rightward shift of concentration-response curves of KCl, calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) and noradrenaline in a non-parallel manner; 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentration-response curves were shifted towards right in a parallel manner by imperatorin 10 and 30 muM, but markedly suppressed by imperatorin 100 muM. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of imperatorin is mainly via voltage dependent calcium channel and possibly receptor operated calcium channel. beta-adrenoceptor, ATP-sensitive potassium channel and inwardly rectifying potassium channel were not involved in the vasodilatation, whereas blockage of calcium-activated potassium channel with tetraethylammonium had effect. Furthermore, in Ca(2+)-free medium, imperatorin concentration-dependently depressed the vasoconstrictions derived from noradrenaline and CaCl(2), and resulted in a decreased contractile response induced by caffeine, indicating a role of inhibiting extracellular Ca(2+) influx and intracellular Ca(2+) release from Ca(2+) store. Taken together, our results suggest that imperatorin induces vasodilatation by possible mechanisms inhibiting voltage dependent calcium channel and receptor-mediated Ca(2+)influx and Ca(2+)release. Opening calcium-activated potassium channel and competitive antagonism of 5-HT receptors may also contribute to this vasodilatation effect.",

It is highly selective for the beta1-adrenoceptor, and has additional nitric oxide-mediated vasodilating and antioxidant properties, along with a favourable metabolic profile. Nebivolol is well tolerated by patients with hypertension and heart failure. Although several smaller studies were conducted with nebivolol in hypertensive patients, no large randomised clinical trials have been performed to prove efficacy on hard clinical end points. In patients with heart failure, a large mortality/morbidity trial was conducted, and nebivolol was shown to reduce the composite end point of mortality and hospitalisations.

    "70": "Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and adrenomedullin (AM) are potent vasodilators and exert positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the heart. Receptors for CGRP and AM are calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR)/receptor-activity-modifying protein (RAMP) 1 and CLR/RAMP2 heterodimers, respectively. The present study was designed to delineate distinct cardiovascular effects of CGRP and AM. Thus a V5-tagged rat CLR was expressed in transgenic mice in the vascular musculature, a recognized target of CGRP. Interestingly, basal arterial pressure and heart rate were indistinguishable in transgenic mice and in control littermates. Moreover, intravenous injection of 2 nmol/kg CGRP, unlike 2 nmol/kg AM, decreased arterial pressure equally by 18 +/- 5 mmHg in transgenic and control animals. But the concomitant increase in heart rate evoked by CGRP was 3.7 times higher in transgenic mice than in control animals. The effects of CGRP in transgenic and control mice, different from a decrease in arterial pressure in response to 20 nmol/kg AM, were suppressed by 2 micromol/kg of the CGRP antagonist CGRP(8-37). Propranolol, in contrast to hexamethonium, blocked the CGRP-evoked increase in heart rate in both transgenic and control animals. This was consistent with the immunohistochemical localization of the V5-tagged CLR in the superior cervical ganglion of transgenic mice. In conclusion, hypotension evoked by CGRP in transgenic and control mice was comparable and CGRP was more potent than AM. Unexpectedly, the CLR/RAMP CGRP receptor overexpressed in postganglionic sympathetic neurons of transgenic mice enhanced the positive chronotropic action of systemic CGRP.",

These changes in response to social isolation showed predictable interrelations and were mediated by a disruption of autonomic balance including both sympathetic and parasympathetic (vagal) mechanisms.",

    "76": "Since the 1980's nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), the endogenous gas molecules produced from metabolic pathway, have been realized as signal molecules to be involved in the regulation of body homeostasis and to play important roles under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. The researches on these endogenous gas signal molecules opened a new avenue in life science. To explore the new member of gasotransmitter family, other endogenous gas molecules which have been regarded as metabolic waste up to date, and their biological regulatory effects have been paid close attention to in the current fields of life science and medicine. Sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) can be produced endogenously from normal metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids. L-cysteine is oxidized via cysteine dioxygenase to L-cysteinesulfinate, and the latter can proceed through transamination by glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) to beta-sulfinyl pyruvate which decomposes spontaneously to pyruvate and SO(2). In mammals, activated neutrophils by oxidative stress can convert H(2)S to sulfite through a reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase-dependent process. The authors detected endogenous production of SO(2) in all cardiovascular tissues, including in heart, aorta, pulmonary artery, mesenteric artery, renal artery, tail artery and the plasma SO(2) content. As the key enzyme producing SO(2), GOT mRNA in cardiovascular system was detected and found to be located enriched in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells near the endothelial layer. When the normal rats were treated with hydroxamate(HDX), a GOT inhibitor, at a dose of 3.7 mg/kg body weight, the blood pressure (BP) went high markedly, the ratio of wall thickness to lumen radius was increased by 18.34%, and smooth muscle cell proliferation was enhanced. The plasma SO(2) level in the rats injected with 125 micromol/kg body weight SO(2) donor was increased to 721.98+/-30.11 micromol/L at the end of 30 seconds, while the blood pressure was decreased to the lowest point 65.0+/- 4.9 mm Hg at the end of 1 minute. The above results showed that endogenous SO(2) might be involved in the maintenance of blood pressure and normal vascular structure. In spontaneous hypertensive rat (SHR) animal model, exogenous supplement of SO(2) donor decreased the BP, the media cross-sectional area, and pressure of the media and the ratio of wall thickness to lumen radius in the SHR. Moreover, the proliferative index of aortic smooth muscle cells was decreased in the SHR treated with SO(2) donor compared with that in SHR. The above data showed that SO(2) could prevent the aortic structural remodeling by inhibiting the proliferation of aortic smooth muscle cells. The authors observed the direct vasorelaxant effects of SO(2) on the aortic ring pre-treated with norepinephrine (NE). SO(2) donor at a concentration of 25-100 micromol/L relaxed the aortic ring temporarily and slightly, but SO(2) donor at a concentration of 1-12 mmol/L induced relaxation of the ring in a concentration-dependent manner. Administration with nicardipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker other than glibenclamide, an ATP sensitive potassium channel (K(ATP) channel) blocker or removal of vascular endothelium could decrease the SO(2)-induced vasorelaxation. In hypoxic pulmonary hypertension animal model, SO(2) donor decreased the mean pulmonary artery pressure and the systolic pulmonary artery pressure (P<0.01), respectively as compared with hypoxic group, and alleviated obviously the hypoxic pulmonary vascular structural remodeling. The percentage of muscularized arteries of small pulmonary vessels was significantly decreased in hypoxia+SO(2) donor-treated rats compared with that of hypoxic rats (P<0.01), while the percentage of non-muscularized vessels was obviously higher in hypoxia with SO(2) donor-treated rats than that of hypoxic rats (P<0.01). Similarly, SO(2) obviously decreased relative media area and relative media thickness of small muscularized pulmonary arteries in hypoxic rats (P<0.01). The above data showed that SO(2) might play an important role in development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. Perfusion with SO(2) donor (10(-6)-10(-3) mol/L) to the isolated rat heart obviously inhibited the left ventricular peak rate of contraction ( + LV dp/ dtmax) , peak rate of relaxation (-LV dp/ dtmax) and difference of left ventricular pressure ( DeltaLVP) in a concentration dependent manner. Nicardipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, could partly antagonize the inhibitory effect of SO(2) on the heart function. In a word, SO(2) could be endogenously generated in cardiovascular tissues and exert important cardiovascular effects such as vasorelaxant effect and negative inotropic effects. Moreover, SO(2) might play considerable roles in the regulation of systemic circulatory pressure, pulmonary circulatory pressure and vascular structural remodeling in the pathogenesis of hypertension and hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. On the basis of the above findings, we presumed that endogenous SO(2) might be a novel cardiovascular functional regulatory gasotransmitter. More studies on the significance of endogenous SO(2) in cardiovascular system under physiological and pathophysiological conditions need to be investigated.", 
    "77": "The authors aim to highlight the pitfalls of different validated methods used for the assessment of drugs' effect on QT duration. Digital 12-lead Holter electrocardiograms were recorded at baseline and after a single dose of sotalol in 39 healthy subjects (age = 27.4 +/- 8.0 years). Using both time- and rate-based approaches, the authors obtained averaged QRS-T complexes every minute (\"time bins\") and at different RR intervals (\"rate bins\"). Time bins were corrected for heart rate using a subject-specific approach. The individual alpha coefficients increased from placebo (0.309 +/- 0.052) to sotalol (0.454 +/- 0.136), P < .0001. When the placebo individual alpha coefficients were applied to correct the QT interval on sotalol, the changes were >5 ms smaller than those obtained using the ON drug alpha coefficients. The \"rate\"-averaging process leads to a complete loss of the time course of drug effect. In conclusion, the individual correction formula calculated from the placebo condition cannot always be used for QT correction on the drug.",

Previous placebo-controlled phase III and phase IV trials with agalsidase-beta demonstrated clearing of globotriaosylceramide from vascular endothelia but little effect on proteinuria or progressive loss of kidney function in patients with Fabry disease and severe chronic kidney disease marked by overt proteinuria and/or estimated GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and/or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy is the standard of care for patients with proteinuric kidney diseases, but their use is challenging in patients with Fabry disease and low or low-normal baseline systemic BP. A group of patients with Fabry disease were treated with antiproteinuric therapy, in conjunction with agalsidase-beta; sustained reductions in proteinuria with stabilization of kidney function were achieved in a group of six patients who had severe Fabry nephropathy; the progression rate was -0.23 +/- 1.12 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per yr with 30 mo of follow-up.", 
    "79": "Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) or excitation (DSE) is a well-known form of endocannabinoid-mediated short-term plasticity that is induced by postsynaptic depolarization. It is generally accepted that DSI/DSE is triggered by Ca(2+) influx through voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. It is also demonstrated that DSI/DSE is mediated by 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). However, how Ca(2+) induces 2-AG production is still unclear. In the present study, we investigated molecular mechanisms underlying the Ca(2+)-driven 2-AG production. Using cannabinoid-sensitive inhibitory synapses of cultured hippocampal neurons, we tested several inhibitors for enzymes that are supposed to be involved in 2-AG metabolism. The chemicals we tested include inhibitors for phospholipase C (U73122 and ET-18), diacylglycerol kinase (DGK inhibitor 1), phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (propranolol), and diacylglycerol lipase (DGL; RHC-80267 and tetrahydrolipstatin (THL)). However, unfavorable side effects were observed with these inhibitors, except for THL. Furthermore, we found that RHC-80267 hardly inhibited the endocannabinoid release driven by G(q/11)-coupled receptors, which is thought to be DGL-dependent. By contrast, THL exhibited no side effects as long as we tested, and was confirmed to inhibit the DGL-dependent process. Using THL as a DGL inhibitor, we demonstrated that DGL is involved in both hippocampal DSI and cerebellar DSE. To test a possible involvement of PLCdelta in DSI, we examined hippocampal DSI in PLCdelta1, delta3 and delta4-knockout mice. However, there was no significant difference in the DSI magnitude between these knockout mice and wild-type mice. The present study clearly shows that DGL is a prerequisite for DSI/DSE. The enzymes yielding DG remain to be determined.",

Although degenerative changes in the aortic wall are common to thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and to various types of dissection in general, TAA can result from specific heritable disorders of connective tissues. Today, increased awareness of vascular diseases and access to tomographic imaging equipment facilitate the diagnosis of TAA, even when asymptomatic. While most TAA cases with ascending aortic involvement are treated with surgical repair (primarily valve-preserving techniques), aneurysms of the distal arch and descending thoracic aorta are amenable to alternatives to classic open repair such as the emerging endovascular treatment techniques. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the etiology, pathophysiology and clinical management of patients with TAA, and discuss the most recent literature on the condition.", 
    "82": "This study examined the effects of serotonergic depletion and beta-adrenergic antagonism on performance in both visible platform and hidden platform versions of the water maze task. Male Long-Evans rats received systemic injections of p-chlorophenylalanine (500 mg/kg x 2) to deplete serotonin, or propranolol (20 or 40 mg/kg) to antagonize beta-adrenergic receptors. Some rats received treatments in combination. To separate strategies learning from spatial learning, half of the rats underwent Morris' water maze strategies pretraining before drug administration and spatial training. Individual depletion of serotonin or antagonism of beta-adrenergic receptors caused few or no impairments in either naive or pretrained rats in either version of the task. In contrast, combined depletion of serotonin and antagonism of beta-adrenergic receptors impaired naive rats in the visible platform task and impaired both naive and strategies-pretrained rats in the hidden platform task, and also caused sensorimotor impairments. This is the first finding of a 'global' water maze task/sensorimotor impairment with combined administration of two agents that, at the high doses that were given individually, produced few or no impairments. The data imply that (1) serotonergic and beta-adrenergic systems may interact in a manner that is important for adaptive behavior; (2) impairments in these systems found in Alzheimer patients may be important for their cognitive and behavioral impairments; and (3) the approach used here can model aspects of the cognitive and behavioral impairments in Alzheimer disease.", 
    "83": "Puerarin is the main isoflavone found in Pueraria lobata (Willd) Ohwi, which has been used in therapy for various cardiovascular diseases. The present study examined the effects of puerarin on the large-conductance voltage- and Ca2+-activated potassium (BK(Ca)) channel and on rat thoracic aortas. BK(Ca) channels encoded with either alpha (BK-alpha) or alpha/beta subunits (BK-alpha+beta1) were heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes or human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The activities of BK(Ca) channels were measured using excised patch-clamp recordings. Puerarin activated BK-alpha+beta1 currents with a half-maximal concentration (EC50) of 0.8 nM and a Hill coefficient of 1.11 at 10 microM Ca2+ and with an EC50 of 12.6 nM and a Hill coefficient of 1.08 at 0 microM Ca2+. Puerarin (1 nM) induced a 16-mV leftward shift in the conductance-voltage curve for BK-alpha+beta1 currents at 10 microM Ca2+ and at 100 nM induced a 26-mV leftward shift at 0 microM Ca2+. Puerarin mainly increased the BK-alpha+beta1 channel open probability without changing the unitary conductance. Activation was also detected in the absence of the beta1 subunit. A deglycosylated analog of puerarin, daidzein, also activated BK(Ca) channels with weaker potency. In addition, puerarin (0.1 to 1000 microM) caused concentration-dependent relaxations of rat thoracic aortic rings contracted with 1 microM noradrenaline bitartrate (EC50 = 1.1 microM). These were significantly inhibited by 50 nM iberiotoxin, a specific blocker of BK(Ca) channels. This is the first study demonstrating that puerarin activates BK(Ca) channels, especially BK-alpha+beta1 channels. The activation of the BK(Ca) channel probably contributes to the puerarin-mediated vasodilation action.",

Echocardiographic indices of left ventricular function and dimensions were used as measures of ventricular remodeling.", 
    "86": "6 months after the infarction patients who at baseline had AT(1)R density above median (N=17) as compared to those with AT(1)R density below median (N=20) had higher left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI, 41.3+/-2.7 vs. 33.2+/-2.3) and lower ejection fraction (LVEF 48.1+/-1.8 vs. 54.7+/-2.0). Moreover LVESVI positively and LVEF negatively correlated with AT(1)R density although the strength of these correlations was weaker than at discharge. Infarct size as reflected by a single troponin T measurement and post-MI therapy did not differ between high- and low-AT(1)R groups: over 85% patients received ACE-inhibitor, beta-blocker and statin.", 
    "87": "High AT(1)R density on blood platelets (a presumable marker of cardiovascular AT(1)R density) drawn in the acute phase of MI predicts poorer left ventricular systolic function in 6-month follow up. This suggests that modern therapy offers suboptimal blockade of renin-angiotensin system activity in the setting of MI.", 
    "88": "Once the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been made, treatment should be based upon the patient's overall clinical condition. Up to now, there has been no controlled data to guide the optimal medical regimen, but it is reasonable to treat these patients with standard medications for left ventricular systolic dysfunction during acute phase. This includes aspirin, beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors, and diuretics as necessary for volume overload. Since this type of cardiomyopathy is a transient disorder, the appropriate duration of therapy is not known. Although the current study demonstrates that the use of beta-blockers, aspirin, ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers does not seem to be indicated for chronic treatment of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, we strongly believe that we need to achieve the data which will be obtained from large scale prospective studies in the near future to assess the clinical significance of chronic medical treatment.", 
    "89": "Balanced and coordinated antioxidant defence enzyme activities are of utmost importance for correct physiological function and for shielding against unwelcome pathological conditions. We determined the activities of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase in erythrocytes isolated from patients receiving different therapy (streptokinase alone or in combination with metoprolol or with carvedilol) for up to 168 hr after starting treatment for acute myocardial infarction. We observed increased CuZnSOD activity in erythrocytes isolated from patients treated with streptokinase-carvedilol (after 6, 24 and 168 hr) and in erythrocytes isolated from patients treated with streptokinase-metoprolol (after 24 hr). In addition, positive correlation between CuZnSOD and catalase activities was found in erythrocytes isolated from patients that received streptokinase-carvedilol after 168 hr. As metoprolol does not react directly with hydrogen peroxide, it would appear that combined streptokinase-metoprolol therapy exerted its effects primarily via by beta-blockade whereas combined streptokinase-carvedilol therapy appeared to function via both beta-blockade and direct antioxidant mechanisms.", 
    "90": "Andrographis paniculata has been widely used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of common cold, diarrhea and hypertension. The three major active diterpenoids are andrographolide (AP1), 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide (AP3) and neoandrographolide (AP4). It has been reported that AP3 has hypotensive and vasorelaxation effects. However, there is only limited information on the cardiovascular effects of the other diterpenoids and crude extracts containing different levels of AP3. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of these diterpenoids, AP1, AP3, and AP4, isolated from A. paniculata, and different aqueous plant extracts on blood pressure, vascular and chronotropic responses by using conscious rats and their isolated aortas and right atria as the test models. Among the three major diterpenoids, AP3 was the most potent compound for inducing vasorelaxation and decreasing heart rate. In addition, Extract B (high level of AP3) had greater hypotensive effect in conscious rats than Extract A (low level of AP3). Verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker, also had a hypotensive effect less than that of Extract C containing a high level of AP3. At the doses and durations of Extract A and B which produced hypotension, the responses of the Extract A-treated aorta to norepinephrine, and the vascular muscarinic responses to acetylcholine of both extracts were decreased. However, repeated doses of both extracts did not alter cardiac beta-adrenoceptor and muscarinic responses of extract-treated rats to NE and ACh, respectively. The results of this study suggest that vascular smooth muscle is the major site of these hypotensive effects of both AP3 and A. paniculata extracts. Furthermore, the consumption of A. paniculata products containing high levels of AP3 may be responsible for causing hypotension in some patients taking this herbal drug.",

We analyzed data from 186 JLN patients obtained from the literature (31%) and from individual physicians (69%). Most patients (86%) had cardiac events and 50% were symptomatic already by age 3. Their QTc was markedly prolonged (557 +/- 65 ms). Most of the arrhythmic events (95%) were triggered by emotions or exercise. Females are at lower risk for cardiac arrest and sudden death (CA/SD). A QTc>550 ms and history of syncope during the first year of life are independent predictors of subsequent CA/SD. Most mutations (90.5%) are on the KCNQ1 gene; mutations on the KCNE1 gene are associated with a more benign course. beta-blockers have only partial efficacy as 51% of the patients had events despite therapy and 29% had CA/SD.",

    "94": "Prescriptions of dispensed medication and mortality were identified by an individual-level linkage of nationwide registers. Inclusion was irrespective of left ventricular function. Treatment with renin-angiotensin inhibitors (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-2 receptor blockers), beta-blockers, spironolactone, and statins was initiated in 43%, 27%, 19%, and 19% of patients, respectively. Patients who did not initiate treatment within 90 days of discharge had a low probability of later treatment initiation. Treatment dosages were in general only 50% of target dosages and were not increased during long-term treatment. Short breaks in therapy were common, but most patients reinitiated treatment. Five years after initiation of treatment, 79% patients were still on renin-angiotensin inhibitors, 65% on beta-blockers, 56% on spironolactone, and 83% on statins. Notably, multiple drug treatment and increased severity of heart failure was associated with persistence of treatment. Nonpersistence with renin-angiotensin inhibitors, beta-blockers, and statins was associated with increased mortality with hazard ratios for death of 1.37 (95% CI, 1.31 to 1.42), 1.25 (95% CI, 1.19 to 1.32), 1.88 (95% CI, 1.67 to 2.12), respectively.", 
    "95": "Persistence of treatment was high once medication was started, but treatment dosages were below recommended dosages. Increased severity of heart failure or increased number of concomitant medications did not worsen persistence, but nonpersistence identified a high-risk population of patients who required special attention. A focused effort on early treatment initiation, appropriate dosages, and persistence with the regimen is likely to provide long-term benefit.",

The method is based on the diffuse reflectance measurements of the colored product (III) of the spot test reaction between propranolol hydrochloride (I) and 2,6-dichloroquinone-4-chloroimide (II) using filter paper as solid support. Spot test conditions have been investigated using experimental design in order to identify and optimize the critical factors. The factors evaluated were DCQ concentration, propranolol solvent and DCQ solvent. The best reaction conditions were achieved with the addition of 30 microL of propranolol solution in ethanol 35% (v/v) and 30 microL of DCQ solution at 70 mg mL(-1) in acetone, in this order. All reflectance measurements were carried out at 500 nm and the linear range was from 8.45x10(-4) to 8.45x10(-2)mol L(-1) (r=0.998). The limit of detection was 1.01x10(-4)mol L(-1). No interference was observed from the assessed excipients and drugs. The method was applied to determine propranolol in commercial brands of pharmaceuticals. The results obtained by the proposed method were favorably compared with those given by the British Pharmacopoeia procedure.",

We aimed to evaluate the impact of preventive therapy with two widely employed drugs (topiramate and nadolol) on the quality of life of migraine patients. A population of consecutive migraineurs aged > or = 16 years, with frequent migraines, was selected prospectively for evaluation at baseline and after 16 weeks of therapy with nadolol or topiramate (40 mg and 100 mg daily, respectively) by generic and specific quality of life questionnaires (SF-36 and MSQOL) and by an anxiety and depression scale (HADS). Preventive therapy resulted in a statistically significant improvement in physical domains of the SF-36, whereas mental domains remained almost unchanged. Despite this improvement, all domains remained below the population norms. The HADS revealed a moderate depressive state at baseline that did not change with therapy. The MSQOL global score also revealed statistically significant improvement. Both drugs were similarly effective, although topiramate was superior on the role physical domain compared with nadolol. Preventive therapy with nadolol and topiramate significantly improves the quality of life of migraineurs, although additional efforts are needed to place them in a nearer-to-normal situation compared with the general population.",

They were followed yearly for 11.2 +/- 2.2 years. During 483 patient-years, cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or acute coronary syndrome requiring hospitalization or revascularization occurred in 3 (12%) of MED vs. 17 (61%) of RFC patients (P < 0.001).

    "108": "G protein-coupled receptors are cell surface receptors that mediate the effects of extracellular signals in the endocrine/paracrine and sensory systems. Experimental evidence is accumulating, which suggest that these receptors form dimers or higher order oligomers. The functional relevance of G protein-coupled receptor dimerization or oligomerization has been raised in a number of different processes, including ontogeny, internalization, ligand-induced regulation, pharmacological diversity and signal transduction of these receptors. Agonist-independent homo- and hetero-oligomerization of the angiotensin AT1 receptor has been reported, and it has been suggested that hetero-oligomerization with beta-adrenergic receptors leads to cross-inhibition of these receptors. Much less is known about the functional interactions between AT1 receptor homo-oligomers. The aim of the present study was to analyze the functional interactions between these homo-oligomers by determining the functions of normal, AT1 receptor blocker (candesartan) resistant (S109Y) and G protein coupling deficient (DRY/AAY) AT1 receptors (co-)expressed in COS-7 cells. Although we have found no evidence that stimulation of a G protein coupling deficient receptor could cross-activate co-expressed normal receptors, candesartan binding to a signaling deficient receptor caused cross-inhibition of co-expressed candesartan resistant AT1 receptors. Since the studied mutations were in the third intracellular helix of the receptor, the observed effects cannot be explained with domain swapping. These data suggest that AT1 receptor blockers cause cross-inhibition of homo-oligomerized AT1 receptors, and support the concept that receptor dimers/oligomers serve as the functional unit of G protein-coupled receptors.",

    "117": "The thermodynamics of the interaction of positively charged drug molecules with negatively charged glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is investigated by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fluorescence spectroscopy. The drugs considered are propranolol hydrochloride, tacrine, and aminacrine, and the polymers used as model GAGs are dextran sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronic acid. The ITC results show that the interaction between drugs and GAGs is via direct binding and that GAGs bind to drugs at one set of sites. Large negative values of heat capacity change (DeltaC(p)) are observed upon binding of GAGs to drugs. Such negative DeltaC(p) is not expected for purely electrostatic interactions and suggests that hydrophobic and other interactions may be also involved in the binding process. These results are corroborated by fluorescence spectroscopy measurements, which show that specific drug/GAG complex formation is accompanied by a clear enhancement of the fluorescence intensity. The results highlight the importance of the formation of drug/GAG complexes as a primary step for the drug delivery process into cell membranes. It is concluded that the interactions are dependent on the nature of both GAG and drug and this is a fact to be taken into account when new drugs are designed.",

AF is associated with an increased risk of stroke, prolonged hospitalization and increased medical costs. Risk factors of post-operative AF are valvular surgery, advanced age, and pre-operative history of AF. Postoperative AF occurs most frequently at 2 days after the surgery and rarely after 7 post-operative days. Most of post-operative AF is short-lived and terminates until discharge. Because of short-lived nature, rate control with beta-blockers or Ca antagonists is the treatment of choice. Beta-blockers, amiodarone and sotalol are effective in preventing post-operative AF when given before the surgery and for 7 days post-operatively. Anticoagulation with heparin should be given to the patients when thromboembolic risk is high.",

Compared with the control group, the mean blood pressure and cardiac output were significantly decreased, while peripheral resistance was significantly increased in the CHF group. This proved that the CHF model was successful created with adriamycin in this study. Compared to the control group, the ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) was remarkably decreased and all MAPD of the 3 myocardial layers were extended in rabbits with CHF. However, the extension of MAPD in the midmyocardium was more obvious. The transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) was significantly increased in CHF. Low-dose carvedilol (0.25 mg/kg, twice daily) had no effects on ventricular remodeling. Treatment with low-dose carvedilol significantly increased VFT. Although the MAPD of the 3 myocardial layers were further prolonged in the carvedilol treated CHF group, the prolongation of MAPD in the midmyocardium was shorter than those in the epicardium and endocardium. Treatment with low-dose carvedilol significantly decreased TDR in CHF.",

    "129": "Drug lipophilicity is known to have a major influence on in vivo drug absorption from intramuscularly and subcutaneously administered solutions. Indeed, chemical modification to increase drug lipophilicity is used to enable sustained drug release from solutions. In contrast to the wealth of knowledge on drug release from simple solutions, the influence of drug lipophilicity on its release from controlled release formulations, such as, microparticles and in situ forming depots, have not been systematically studied. Controlled release vehicles are designed to 'control' drug release, hence, in vitro studies show negligible influence of drug lipophilicity on release. The situation could however be different in vivo, due to interactions between the vehicle and biological tissue. We therefore investigated the influence of drug lipophilicity on its in vivo release in rats from two controlled release formulations, PLGA microparticles and in situ forming depots. Both systems exhibited a burst drug release. Subsequent to the burst release, we found that lipophilicity did not influence the rate or extent of drug absorption from the two formulations over a 10-day study period, which would imply that drug partitioning out of the depots was not the main mechanism of drug release from both formulations. This study must however be repeated with a greater number of animals to increase its power.", 
    "130": "Hypertensive left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is associated with a substantial risk for malignant arrhythmias and sudden death. According to recent results, antihypertensive therapy with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker irbesartan reverses both structural and electrical remodelling. However, the relation between the LV geometric pattern (concentric vs eccentric) and electrical reverse remodelling has not been characterized, neither has the relation between repolarization and rate (QT/RR and JT/RR relation), which presumably reflects the propensity for bradycardia-dependent ventricular arrhythmia. In this study, repeat echocardiographic and electrocardiographic measurements were performed in hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy, randomized to double-blind therapy with irbesartan (n = 44) or the beta(1)-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol (n = 48) for 48 weeks; 53 patients had concentric and 39 eccentric LV hypertrophy. In addition, 37 matched hypertensive subjects without LV hypertrophy and no current therapy served as controls. Irbesartan induced structural and electrophysiological reverse remodelling, independent of LV geometry. In contrast, atenolol had similar beneficial effect only in patients with concentric LV hypertrophy, while the response in those with eccentric hypertrophy was unfavourable with both prolonged repolarization time and an increased QT/RR slope (suggesting reverse-use dependence). In conclusion, there is a significant geometry-related difference in the reverse remodelling processes induced by irbesartan and atenolol. Echocardiographic characterization of the geometry in hypertension-induced LV hypertrophy might become an important step in the selection of optimal antihypertensive therapy.",

The incidence of angina, heart failure, diabetes mellitus and hypertension in the female group was higher than in male group (73.6% vs 62.3%, P < 0.0001; 8.2% vs 5.7%, P = 0.031; 30.8% vs 18.6%, P < 0.0001 and 66.4% vs 56.8%, P = 0.001 respectively), but the incidence of smoking was less in the female group than in the male group (6.6% vs 66.2%, P < 0.0001). More male patients presented with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) compared with female patients (48.5% vs 39%, P = 0.002). With the exception of beta-blocker administration, no differences were found among medications including aspirin, ACEI, lipid lowering agents and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) between female and male patients presenting with ACS in hospitals. Compared with male patients with non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) ACS, female subjects were more prone to receive beta-blockers (75.1% vs 63.4%, P = 0.001). Among STEMI and NSTE-ACS patients, fewer female subjects received reperfusion therapy compared with male subjects (37.1% vs 26.8%, P = 0.013 for STEMI; 53.6% vs 37.2 %, P < 0.0001 for NSTE-ACS). Recurrent angina was more often seen in the female group of patients with the whole spectrum of ACS (25% vs 14.5%, P = 0.005 for STEMI; 29.4% vs 20.2%, P = 0.001 for NSTE-ACS) as was true for patients with congestive heart failure. There was no significant difference in in-hospital death rates between the two groups with ACS (5.6% vs 7.1%, P = 0.2 for STEMI, and 2.1% vs 1.4%, P = 0.738 for NSTE-ACS).",

    "139": "The purpose of this study was to determine the permeability and solubility of seven beta-blockers (acebutolol, atenolol, labetalol, metoprolol, nadolol, sotalol, and timolol) and to classify them according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS). Apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) were measured using the Caco-2 cell line, and the solubility was determined at 37 degrees C over a pH range of 1.0-7.5. The permeability coefficients ranged from 1.0x10(-7) to 4.8x10(-5) cm/s. On the basis of the in vitro permeability and solubility data observed in the study, labetolol, metoprolol, and timolol can be categorized as BCS Class I drugs, whereas acebutolol, atenolol, and nadolol belong to BCS Class III. The permeability coefficients in Caco-2 cells were consistent with the reported extent of intestinal absorption in humans for all drugs except sotalol. Sotalol displayed low permeability in the Caco-2 cell line, but the extent of intestinal absorption in humans is over 90%. The low permeability through the Caco-2 monolayers might be largely related to its low lipophilicity. In addition, the difference between the tightness of the intercellular junction in vivo and in vitro may partially contribute to this disparity in the sotalol permeability of in vivo and in vitro.",

In one large trial the main morbidity and mortality outcomes did not differ significantly between initial treatment drug classes when drugs were added to reach goal blood pressures. However, the comparison ACE Inhibitors vs diuretic favoured the diuretic for stroke 1.40 [1.17 to 1.68]; combined CHD 1.15 [1.02 to 1.30] and combined CVD 1.19 [1.09 to 1.30] and the comparison alpha blocker vs diuretic favoured the diuretic for combined CVD 1.40 [1.25 to 1.57].

    "148": "Episodes of acute emotional stress can have significant adverse effects on the heart. Acute emotional stress can produce left ventricular contractile dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, or disturbances of cardiac rhythm. Although these abnormalities are often only transient, their consequences can be gravely damaging and sometimes fatal. Despite the many descriptions of catastrophic cardiovascular events in the setting of acute emotional stress, the anatomical substrate and physiological pathways by which emotional stress triggers cardiovascular events are only now being characterized, aided by the advent of functional neuroimaging. Recent evidence indicates that asymmetric brain activity is particularly important in making the heart more susceptible to ventricular arrhythmias. Lateralization of cerebral activity during emotional stress may stimulate the heart asymmetrically and produce areas of inhomogeneous repolarization that create electrical instability and facilitate the development of cardiac arrhythmias. Patients with ischemic heart disease who survive an episode of sudden cardiac death in the setting of acute emotional stress should receive a beta-blocker. Nonpharmacological approaches to manage emotional stress in patients with and without coronary artery disease, including social support, relaxation therapy, yoga, meditation, controlled slow breathing, and biofeedback, are also appropriate to consider and merit additional investigation in randomized trials.",

Concurrently, the blockade of beta-adrenoceptors has been shown to augment the release of inflammatory mediators in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. We therefore aimed to investigate whether the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol might modulate the anti-inflammatory effects of isoflurane on the systemic and pulmonary release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in endotoxemic rats.",

    "153": "Betaxolol is a selective antagonist of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors. Personal response to the drug widely varies and depends on its properties and individual features including innate characteristics. Our aim was to study the association between the clinical response to betaxolol in patients with essential hypertension (EH) and polymorphous markers of two genes: beta(1) adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB1) and cytochrome P450 2D6 gene (CYP2D6). Eighty-one patients with EH were selected. Mean age was 52.2 +/- 1.22 years. Betaxolol monotherapy provided effective blood pressure control (BP < 140/90 mmHg) in 68 patients, 56 of them continued treatment with initial dose. The systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure declined significantly at the end of the study. We have not found any significant association of rest and exercise BP and heart rate (HR) with polymorphous marker Arg389Gly of ADRB1 gene except the nighttime variability of DBP. But in case of the polymorphous marker Pro34Ser of CYP2D6 gene we have found significant association with response to betaxolol therapy. The rest HR declined more significantly in Ser/Pro genotype carriers (-32.6 +/- 4.77 beats/min and -18.4 +/- 2.01 beats/min, P = 0.023). These patients demonstrated more significant increase of exercise time (4.58 +/- 0.90 and 0.59 +/- 0.58 min, P = 0.045). Maximal exercise HR and DBP were also significantly lower in Ser/Pro genotype carriers in comparison with Ser/Ser genotype carriers. Decline of mean daytime SBP in 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was more significant in Pro allele carriers (-21.0 +/- 2.55 mmHg vs. -5.2 +/- 2.27 mmHg in patients with Ser/Ser genotype, P = 0.001). Betaxolol effect on HR and BP significantly depends on variability of the gene determining the drug metabolism. The carriers of Pro34 allele of CYP2D6 gene (8.6%) are more sensitive to betaxolol therapy. Because of the relatively small group sizes our data should be considered as preliminary ones. The increase of our groups and the replication in other studies will permit to estimate the contribution of genetic factors to betaxolol effect on HR and BP.", 
    "154": "The static relationship between heart rate (HR) and the activity of either vagal or sympathetic nerves is roughly linear within the physiological range of HR variations. The dynamic control of HR by autonomic nerves is characterized by a fixed time delay between the onset of changes in nerve activity and the onset of changes in HR. This delay is much longer for sympathetically than for vagally mediated changes in HR. In addition, the kinetics of the HR responses shows the properties of a low-pass filter with short (vagal) and long (sympathetic) time constants. These differences might be secondary to differences in nervous conduction times, width of synaptic cleft, kinetics of receptor activation and post-receptor events. Because of the accentuated low-pass filter characteristics of the HR response to sympathetic modulation, sympathetic influences are almost restricted to the very-low-frequency component of HR variability, but the chronotropic effects of vagal stimulation usually predominate over those of sympathetic stimulation in this frequency band. Oscillations in cardiac sympathetic nerve activity are not involved in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (high-frequency component) and make a minor contribution to HR oscillations of approximately 10-s period (low-frequency component of approximately 0.1 Hz), at least in the supine position. In the latter case, HR oscillations are derived mainly from a baroreflex, vagally mediated response to blood pressure Mayer waves. Beta-blockers and centrally acting sympathoinhibitory drugs share the ability to improve the baroreflex control of HR, possibly through vagal facilitation, which might be beneficial in several cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "155": "We hypothesized that bolus injections of lipid soluble chemotherapeutic drugs during transient cerebral hypoperfusion could significantly boost regional drug delivery. In the first two groups of New Zealand White rabbits we measured brain tissue carmustine concentrations after intravenous infusion, intraarterial infusion with normal perfusion, and after intraarterial injections during transient cerebral hypoperfusion. In the third group of animals we assessed the safety of the technique by assessing electroencephalographic changes for 6 h after flow arrest carmustine administration and subsequent histological examination. The brain tissue carmustine concentrations were fivefold to sevenfold higher when the drug was injected during cerebral hypoperfusion compared to a conventional intracarotid infusion (68.4 +/- 24.5 vs. 14.2 +/- 8.3 microg/g, n = 5 each, respectively, P < 0.0001). The brain tissue carmustine concentrations (y) were a linear function of the bolus dose (x) injected during cerebral hypoperfusion, y = 10.4 x x - 21 (R = 0.84, P < 0.001). Stable EEGs were recorded several hours after flow arrest carmustine exposure and histological examinations did not reveal any gross evidence of cerebral injury. Transient cerebral hypoperfusion during intraarterial bolus injection of carmustine significantly increases drug delivery. Clinical techniques that decrease CBF, such as, transient arterial occlusion by balloon tipped catheters, hyperventilation, hypothermia, induced hypotension, or transient circulatory arrest, could enhance intraarterial drug delivery to the brain. We believe that the mechanisms for improved drug delivery is the decrease in drug dilution by reduced or absent blood flow, decreased protein binding and a longer time for high concentrations of free drugs to transit through the blood brain barrier.",

    "160": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of adrenergic antagonists carvedilol and propranolol on L-thyroxin-induced cardiovascular and metabolic disturbances in rats. Treatment with L-thyroxin sodium (75 mg/kg body mass, s.c., every alternate day for 3 weeks), produced a significant increase in food and water intake, body temperature, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, along with an increase in serum T3, T4, and triglyceride levels. Besides a significant reduction in body mass, serum levels of TSH and cholesterol were also reduced following L-thyroxin treatment. Carvedilol (10 mg/kg body mass, orally) and propranolol (10 mg/kg body mass, i.p.) administered daily in the third week to 2 separate groups of L-thyroxin-treated animals reversed thyroxin-induced loss in body mass and rise in body temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate. Propranolol treatment increased TSH levels and decreased T3 and T4 levels in hyperthyroid animals, whereas carvedilol did not produce any effect on thyroid hormones. Carvedilol treatment reversed thyroxin induced hypertriglyceridemia, whereas propranolol treatment had no effect. Both carvedilol and propranolol prevented decrease in cholesterol levels induced by thyroxine. Compared with normal animals, L-thyroxin-treated animals showed a state of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinaemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance, as inferred from elevated fasting serum glucose and insulin levels, higher area under the curve over 120 min for glucose, and decreased insulin sensitivity index (KITT). Propranolol and carvedilol treatment significantly decreased fasting serum glucose levels. Treatment with propranolol did not alter serum insulin levels, area-under-the-curve glucose, or KITT values. However, treatment with carvedilol significantly reduced area-under-the-curve glucose, decreased fasting serum insulin levels and significantly increased KITT values. In conclusion, carvedilol appears to produce favorable effects on insulin sensitivity and glycemic control and can therefore be considered as more efficacious adjunctive treatment than propranolol in hyperthyroidism.", 
    "161": "Recent evidence supports a role for beta(3)-adrenoceptors in human non-pregnant and pregnant myometrium. The present study was designed to characterize the pharmacology of beta-adrenoceptors involved in the function of non-pregnant rat myometrium by comparison of the activity of several beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists in isolated rat uterus and urinary bladder. Contractions of myometrial and detrusor strips were induced by adding 1 nM oxytocin and 15 mM KCl respectively. Cumulative concentration-response curves to the selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonists, CL 316243 and BRL 37344 and the selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist ritodrine were obtained in the presence and absence of the selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551 and the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist bupranolol. Both BRL 37344 (pD(2)=6.79+/-0.09) and ritodrine (pD(2)=6.89+/-0.19) produced potent inhibition of oxytocin-induced contractions in myometrial strips; CL 316243 was inactive at concentrations up to 10 microM. Concentration effect curves to both BRL 37344 and ritodrine were shifted (10 to 30-fold) to the right in the presence of ICI 118551 (10 nM). BRL 37344 (pD(2)=8.51+/-0.21) and CL 316243 (pD(2)=8.61+/-0.24) produced potent inhibition of detrusor strips, while ritodrine was almost 100-fold less potent (pD(2)=5.83+/-0.17). The response to all agonists was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with bupranolol (10 microM), but only ritodrine was affected by ICI 118551 (1 microM). These results demonstrate that relaxation of rat myometrium is mediated by beta(2)-adrenoceptors while, consistent with previous reports, the beta(3)-subtype is primarily responsible for relaxation of rat detrusor.", 
    "162": "Reperfusion after a brief period of cardiac ischemia can lead to potentially lethal arrhythmias. Importantly, there are sex-related differences in cardiac physiology and in the types and severity of cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that gonadal hormones influence the susceptibility to reperfusion-induced sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), as well as the response to beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Male and female intact and gonadectomized rats were instrumented, and arterial pressure, temperature, ECG, and cardiac output were recorded. In addition, a snare was placed around the left main coronary artery. Tension was applied to the snare for determination of susceptibility to sustained VT produced by 3 min of occlusion and reperfusion of the left main coronary artery in conscious rats. Reperfusion culminated in sustained VT in 77% (10 of 13 susceptible) of female rats and 56% (9 of 16 susceptible) of male rats (P > 0.05, male vs. female). beta-Adrenergic receptor blockade prevented sustained VT in females only [1 of 9 susceptible females (11%) vs. 6 of 9 susceptible males (67%), P < 0.05]. Ovariectomy did not significantly reduce the susceptibility to reperfusion arrhythmias [5 of 9 susceptible (56%)]. In sharp contrast, orchidectomy significantly increased the susceptibility to reperfusion arrhythmias [9 of 9 susceptible (100%)]. Finally, beta-adrenergic receptor blockade prevented sustained VT in ovariectomized females [0 of 4 susceptible (0%)] and orchidectomized males [0 of 7 susceptible (0%)], but the protective effect of beta-blockade was due to a reduction in heart rate in males only. Thus gonadal hormones influence the susceptibility to reperfusion-induced arrhythmias, as well as the effects and mechanisms of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade.", 
    "163": "OFF-center retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) occupy a smaller proportion than ON RGCs when RGCs regenerate axons into a transplanted peripheral nerve. We examined whether the regeneration ability of OFF RGCs in adult cats was promoted when the numbers of regenerating RGCs were increased with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)+ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)+forskolin (BCF) or 3,4-dihydro-8-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylamino)-propoxy-3-nitroxy-2H-1-benzopyran (nipradilol), an anti-glaucoma drug. ON or OFF RGCs were morphologically determined on the basis of their dendritic ramification in the inner plexiform layer using computational analysis. In the normal intact retina the ratio of ON and OFF RGCs (ON/OFF ratio) was 1.25 (55%/44%); whereas, it was 2.61 in regenerating RGCs with saline injection (control) 6 weeks after peripheral nerve transplantation. Estimated numbers of regenerating ON and OFF RGCs were 2149 and 895, respectively. An injection of BCF increased only numbers of ON RGCs into 5766 (2.7-fold to control) but not that of OFF RGCs, n=858. Nipradilol increased both estimated numbers of ON (11,518, 5.4-fold to control) and OFF RGCs (7330, 8.2-fold to control). In the retinas with optic nerve (OpN) transection and intravitreal saline-, BCF- or nipradilol-injection, numbers of ON and OFF RGCs surviving axotomy showed similar trend to that in regenerating RGCs. Thus, nipradilol promoted the survival and regeneration abilities of both of ON and OFF RGCs whereas BCF only did the abilities of ON RGCs. The distribution of tropo-myosin-related kinase B, BDNF receptor, was sparser in the outer two thirds of inner plexiform layer. The lower surviving ability of OFF-RGCs may be attributed in part to the distribution."
