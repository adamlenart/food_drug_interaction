While many patients with iliac venous occlusive disease and superficial venous insufficiency improve with combined iliac venous stenting and correction of superficial venous reflux, some patients have symptoms which persist. The goal of this study was to identify clinical factors related to persistent symptoms in patients with leg swelling after treatment of both iliac vein stenting and thermal ablation. Methods This observational study analyzed data for patients who underwent both iliac vein stent placement as well as endovenous ablation (either RFA or EVLT) as a management for chronic venous insufficiency between February 2012 and February 2014. Follow-up was performed after completion of both procedures and inquiring for improvement of swelling. Statistical analysis performed using Chi-square and student's t-test. Results Of the total 173 patients who underwent both endovenous closure and iliac vein stent placements, 55 (31.8%) patients were men; 29 (16%) patients stated they had no improvement after these procedures. The average age of patients who did not improve was 68.8 (\u00b116.7 SD) years and 66.2 (\u00b113.3 SD) years for patients who improved. Over all, the classification of the presenting symptoms by CEAP classification demonstrated 25.4%, 53.2%, 5.8%, and 15.6%, for C3-C6, respectively. There was no correlation with failure to improve the swelling with: age ( P\u2009=\u2009.44), gender ( P\u2009=\u2009.33), presenting symptom ( P\u2009=\u2009.67), use of calcium channel blockers ( P\u2009=\u2009.85), nitroglycerin ( P\u2009=\u2009.86), Plavix ( P\u2009=\u2009.07), aspirin ( P\u2009=\u2009.55), Synthyroid ( P\u2009=\u2009.55), Coumadin ( P\u2009=\u2009.14), angiotensin receptor blocker ( P\u2009=\u2009.81), \u03b2 Blockers ( P\u2009=\u2009.61), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ( P\u2009=\u2009.88), furosemide 40\u2009mg ( P\u2009=\u2009.74), hydrochlorothiazide 12.5\u2009mg ( P\u2009=\u2009.07), hydrochlorothiazide 25\u2009mg ( P\u2009=\u2009.48), and EVLT vs. RFA ( P\u2009=\u2009.91). The use of furosemide (20\u2009mg) was associated with continued swelling ( P\u2009=\u2009.01). The use of dual diuretics (furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide) was associated with persistent swelling even after these combined endovenous procedures P\u2009=\u2009.03).

After one year, compared to baseline, heart rate in ivabradine-treated patients was 16bpm lower. This reduction was associated with a significant improvement in NYHA class, and less frequent signs of decompensation (36% to 8%). The proportion of hospitalized patients within 1year decreased from 23% before treatment, to 5% with ivabradine therapy. These improvements in clinical status were accompanied by a reduction in BNP and an increase in LVEF (+5.1% at 1year). Quality of life was significantly improved in all measured dimensions.

The Coronary Revascularization Demonstrating Outcome Study in Kyoto Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) Registry is a multicenter registry enrolling 5,429 consecutive patients with AMI undergoing PCI from 2005 to 2007. The present study population consisted of 3,682 patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI within 24\u00a0hours of symptom onset and discharged alive. The incidence of HF hospitalization was 4.4%/year during the first year after the index STEMI, which attenuated to approximately 1.0%/year beyond 1 year to 5 years with the median follow-up period of 1,956\u00a0days. The independent risk factors for HF hospitalization within 1\u00a0year included older age, previous myocardial infarction, HF at STEMI, left ventricular dysfunction, anterior AMI, and onset-to-balloon time >3\u00a0hours, use of \u03b2 blocker, and nonuse of statin at discharge. By the landmark analysis at 1 year, the cumulative incidences of all-cause death and HF hospitalization beyond 1 year and up to 5 years were significantly higher in patients with HF hospitalization within 1 year of STEMI than in patients without (36.3% vs 10.1%, p <0.001, and 40.4% vs 4.3%, p <0.001, respectively). Even after adjusting for confounders, HF hospitalization within 1 year remained independently associated with a higher risk for death and HF hospitalization beyond 1 year (hazard ratio 1.64, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.52, p\u00a0= 0.04 and HR 5.72, 95% CI 3.46 to 9.22, p <0.001, respectively).

Iontophoresis provides merits such as sustained release of drugs and circumvention of first pass metabolism. This study further investigated and evaluated the anti-osteoporotic effects of liposomal PRP in ovariectomized (OVX) rats via iontophoresis. Rats subjected to OVX were administered with pure or liposomal PRP via iontophoresis or subcutaneous injection twice a week for 12 weeks. Changes in the microarchitecture at the proximal tibia and the fourth lumbar spine were assessed between pure or liposomal PRP treated and non-treated groups using micro-computed tomography. Administration of liposomal PRP at low dose (0.05 mg/kg) via iontophoresis over 2-fold elevated ratio between bone volume and total tissue volume (BV/TV) in proximal tibia to 9.0% whereas treatment with liposomal PRP at low and high (0.5 mg/kg) doses via subcutaneous injection resulted in smaller increases in BV/TV. Significant improvement of BV/TV and bone mineral density (BMD) was also found in the fourth lumbar spine when low-dose liposomal PRP was iontophoretically administered. Iontophoretic low-dose liposomal PRP also elevated trabecular numbers in tibia and trabecular thickness in spine. Enhancement of bone microarchitecture volumes has highlighted that liposomal formulation with transdermal iontophoresis is promising for PRP treatment at the lower dose and with longer duration than its clinical therapeutic range and duration to exhibit optimal effects against bone loss in vivo.",

Exercise training (ET) and \u03b2-blocker therapy have significant impact on the HRR of patients following myocardial infarction (MI). However, the combination of ET and \u03b2-blocker therapy, as well as its effectiveness in patients with a more compromised HRR (\u226412\u00a0bpm), has been under-studied. Male patients (n\u00a0=\u00a064) post-MI were divided: Training\u00a0+\u00a0\u03b2-blocker (n\u00a0=\u00a019), Training (n\u00a0=\u00a015), \u03b2-blocker (n\u00a0=\u00a011) and Control (n\u00a0=\u00a019). Participants performed an ergometric test before and after 3\u00a0months of intervention. HRR was obtained during 5\u00a0min of recovery and corrected by the cardiac reserve (HRRcorrCR ). Compared to pre-intervention, HRRcorrCR was significantly increased during the 1st and 2nd minutes of recovery in the Training\u00a0+\u00a0\u03b2-blocker group (70\u00b75% and 37\u00b75%, respectively; P<0\u00b705). A significant improvement, lasting from the 1st to the 4th minute of recovery, was also observed in the Training group (47%, 50%, 25% and 8\u00b77%, respectively; P<0\u00b705).

Combination of \u03b2-blocker therapy with ET does not compromise the effect of training and instead promotes HRR and aerobic capacity improvement. In addition, this combination is particularly beneficial for individuals presenting with a more compromised HRR.

    "60": "Aldosterone mediates many of the physiological and pathophysiological/cardio-toxic effects of angiotensin II (AngII). Its synthesis and secretion from the zona glomerulosa cells of the adrenal cortex, elevated in chronic heart failure (HF), is induced by AngII type 1 receptors (AT1Rs). The AT1R is a G protein-coupled receptor, mainly coupling to Gq/11 proteins. However, it can also signal through \u03b2-arrestin-1 (\u03b2arr1) or -2 (\u03b2arr2), both of which mediate G protein-independent signaling. Over the past decade, a second, Gq/11 protein-independent but \u03b2arr1-dependent signaling pathway emanating from the adrenocortical AT1R and leading to aldosterone production has become appreciated. Thus, it became apparent that AT1R antagonists that block both pathways equally well are warranted for fully effective aldosterone suppression in HF. This spurred the comparison of all of the currently marketed angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs, AT1R antagonists or sartans) at blocking activation of the two signaling modes (G protein-, and \u03b2arr1-dependent) at the AngII-activated AT1R and hence, at suppression of aldosterone in vitro and in vivo. Although all agents are very potent inhibitors of G protein activation at the AT1R, candesartan and valsartan were uncovered to be the most potent ARBs at blocking \u03b2arr activation by AngII and at suppressing aldosterone in vitro and in vivo in post-myocardial infarction HF animals. In contrast, irbesartan and losartan are virtually G protein-\"biased\" blockers at the human AT1R, with very low efficacy for \u03b2arr inhibition and aldosterone suppression. Therefore, candesartan and valsartan (and other, structurally similar compounds) may be the most preferred ARB agents for HF pharmacotherapy, as well as for treatment of other conditions characterized by elevated aldosterone.",

Unwanted \u03b22-blockade risks causing life-threatening bronchospasm and reduced efficacy of \u03b22-agonist emergency rescue therapy. Thus, current life-prolonging \u03b2-blockers are contraindicated in patients with both heart disease and asthma. Here, we describe NDD-713 and -825, novel highly \u03b21-selective neutral antagonists with good pharmaceutical properties that can potentially overcome this limitation. Radioligand binding studies and functional assays that use human receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells demonstrate that NDD-713 and -825 have nanomolar \u03b21-AR affinity >500-fold \u03b21-AR vs \u03b22-AR selectivity and no agonism.

In congestive heart failure (CHF) there is only one randomized trial with a statistical sample sufficiently large. In this trial (DIG trial), which enrolled patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction in sinus rhythm, digoxin had a neutral action on mortality and modestly reduced the overall need of hospitalization. The study was conducted in the pre-beta-blocker era and, therefore, it has a doubtful application to the current clinical context. There are no randomized trials on atrial fibrillation, either with or without heart failure. Several observational and retrospective studies and meta-analysis have shown an association between the use of digoxin and increased mortality about 20%. Both in the European and American guidelines, even in class I recommendations, evidence is not supported by randomized or observational trials, but just by experts' opinions. Digoxin use in CHF and atrial fibrillation is related to the physician's clinical judgment, based more on consolidated custom that on established scientific evidence. In our opinion, this therapy should be withdrawn until new randomized controlled trials will provide evidence of its efficacy. Two trials have been planned to this aim. Also the issue of toxicity threshold is still unresolved; digoxinemia values should be <1 ng/ml if digoxin is used, to avoid overdosing and toxicity with increased mortality.",

Carvedilol has been widely used for the complication of hepatic cirrhosis in the clinic. Furthermore, it has powerful antioxidant properties. We assessed the potential antifibrotic effects of carvedilol and the underlying mechanisms that may further enhance its clinical benefits. Methods. Using a bile duct ligation rat model of hepatic fibrosis, we studied the effects of carvedilol on the fibrosis, collagen deposition, and oxidative stress based on histology, immunohistochemistry, western blot, and RT-PCR analyses. Results. Carvedilol attenuated liver fibrosis, as evidenced by reduced hydroxyproline content and the accumulation of collagen, downregulated TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, and upregulated MMP-13. MMP-2 was an exception, which was decreased after carvedilol treatment for 2 weeks and upregulated after carvedilol treatment for 4 weeks. Carvedilol reduced the activation of HSCs, decreased the induction of collagen, transforming growth factor-\u03b21, and MDA content, and strengthened the SOD activity. The antifibrotic effects were augmented as dosages increased. Conclusions. The study indicates that carvedilol attenuated hepatic fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner. It can decrease collagen accumulation and HSCs activation by the amelioration of oxidative stress.", 
    "68": "A 55-year-old man with a history of erosive, seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and interstitial lung disease presented with shortness of breath. Echocardiography showed new-onset severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15% and moderately increased mean aortic valve gradient of 20\u2009mmHg in a trileaflet aortic valve with severe sclero-calcific degeneration. Coronary angiography revealed no significant obstructive coronary disease. Invasive hemodynamic studies and dobutamine stress echocardiography were consistent with moderate aortic stenosis. Guideline directed medical therapy for heart failure with reduced EF was initiated; however, diuretics and neurohormonal blockade (beta-blocker and angiotensin receptor blocker) provided minimal improvement, and the patient remained functionally limited. Of interest, echocardiography performed 1\u2009year prior to his presentation showed normal LV EF and mild aortic leaflet calcification with moderate stenosis, suggesting a rapid progressing of calcific aortic valve disease. Subsequently, the patient underwent surgical aortic valve replacement and demonstrated excellent postsurgical recovery of LV EF (55%). Calcific aortic valve disease is commonly associated with aging, bicuspid aortic valve, and chronic kidney disease. Pathophysiological mechanism for valvular calcification is incompletely understood but include osteogenic transformation of valvular interstitial cells mediated by local and systemic inflammatory processes. Several rheumatologic diseases including RA are associated with premature atherosclerosis and arterial calcification, and we speculated a similar role of RA accelerating calcific aortic valve disease. We present a case of accelerated aortic valve calcification with (only) moderate stenosis, complicated by a rapid decline in LV systolic performance. Guidelines for AVR in moderate stenosis without concomitant cardiac surgery are not well established, although it should be considered in selected patients.", 
    "69": "Macrophage activation is increased in diabetes and correlated with the onset and progression of vascular complications. To identify drugs that could inhibit macrophage activation, we developed a cell-based assay and screened a 1,040 compound library for anti-inflammatory effects. Beta2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) agonists were identified as the most potent inhibitors of phorbol myristate acetate-induced tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 production in rat bone marrow macrophages. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, \u03b22AR agonists inhibited diabetes-induced tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 production, which was prevented by co-treatment with a selective \u03b22AR blocker. To clarify the underlying mechanisms, THP-1 cells and bone marrow macrophages were exposed to high glucose. High glucose reduced \u03b2-arrestin2, a negative regulator of NF-\u03baB activation, and its interaction with I\u03baB\u03b1. This subsequently enhanced phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and activation of NF-\u03baB. The \u03b22AR agonists enhanced \u03b2-arrestin2 and its interaction with I\u03baB\u03b1, leading to downregulation of NF-\u03baB. A siRNA specific for \u03b2-arrestin2 reversed \u03b22AR agonist-mediated inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation and inflammatory cytokine production. Treatment of Zucker diabetic fatty rats with a \u03b22AR agonist for 12 weeks attenuated monocyte activation as well as pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic responses in the kidneys and heart. Thus, \u03b22AR agonists might have protective effects against diabetic renal and cardiovascular complications.",

This study thus assessed the effect of 18 widely consumed pharmaceuticals, belonging to four groups: antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), blood lipid-lowering agents (BLLA) and \u03b2-blockers, on the physiology of soil microbial communities from a ecological crop field. Biolog EcoPlates, containing 31 of the most common carbon sources found in forest and crop soils, were used to calculate both the averaged well colour development (AWCD), as an indicator of the entire capacity of degrading carbon sources, and the diversity of carbon source utilization, as an indicator of the physiological diversity. The results show that pharmaceuticals impact microbial communities by changing the ability of microbes to metabolize different carbon sources, thus affecting the metabolic diversity of the soil community. The toxicity of the pharmaceuticals was inversely related to the log Kow; indeed, NSAIDs were the least toxic and antibiotics were the most toxic, while BLLA and \u03b2-blockers presented intermediate toxicity. The antibiotic sulfamethoxazole imposed the greatest impact on microbial communities at concentrations from 100 mg/L, followed by the other two antibiotics (trimethoprim and tetracycline) and the \u03b2-blocker nadolol. Other chemical parameters (i.e. melting point, molecular weight, pKa or solubility) had little influence on toxicity. Microbial communities exposed to pharmaceuticals having similar physicochemical characteristics presented similar physiological diversity patterns of carbon substrate utilization. These results suggest that the repeated amendment of agricultural soils with biosolids or sludges containing pharmaceutical residuals may result in soil concentrations of concern regarding key ecological functions (i.e. the carbon cycle).",

The KD results in elevated production of ketone bodies (KB's), such as beta-hydroxybutyrate (\u03b2-HB), which are thought to have anticonvulsant properties; however, their exact mechanism of action is unknown. In vitro, KB effects on reducing neuronal firing rates are mediated in part by Katp channel activity and GABAb signaling. In order to study metabolic and pharmacological effects in a whole-animal model, we used the eas \"bang-sensitive\" (BS) mutant strain of Drosophila, which exhibits seizure-like activity (SLA) upon mechanical stimulation. Direct application of the KB \u03b2-HB to food reduced BS SLA. Application either of tolbutamide, a Katp blocker, or of CGP-55845, a GABAb antagonist, concomitantly with \u03b2-HB, partially reversed these KB effects on SLA, verifying a role for Katp channels and GABAb signaling in mediating the anticonvulsant effects of KB's and validating this whole-animal model of KD effects on seizure.",

However, detailed associations between the presentation and initial management at the time of MI and post-MI outcomes in people with asthma compared to the general population have not been studied. A total of 300,161 people were identified with a first MI over the period 2003-2013 in the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project database, of whom 8922 (3%) had asthma. Logistic regression was used to compare presentation, in-hospital care, in-hospital and 180-day post-discharge all-cause mortality in people with and without asthma adjusting for demographics and comorbidities, diagnosis on arrival and secondary prevention. People with asthma were more likely to have a delay in their MI diagnosis following an STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction; odds ratio (OR) 1.38, confidence interval CI 1.06-1.79) but not an nSTEMI (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction; OR 1.04, CI 0.92-1.17) compared to people without asthma and a delay in reperfusion (OR 1.19, CI 1.09-1.30) following an STEMI.

    "100": "Measurement of blood pressure (BP) using a brachial cuff sphygmomanometer is universally accepted for the diagnosis of hypertension and prediction of cardiovascular diseases. However, brachial systolic BP does not represent actual systolic BP in the central arteries which encounter cardiac load directly. Due to wave amplification from central to peripheral arteries, a significant difference exists between the two. Central BP measurements also account for arterial stiffness, vessel branching and vascular mechanics, unlike brachial BP. Emerging data suggests that hypertension can be diagnosed more accurately by central pressure indices as compared to brachial BP. Various non-invasive techniques are now available to measure central BP indices owing to recent technological advances. Recently, it has been reported that different classes of anti-hypertensive drugs display differential effects on brachial and central BPs. Nebivolol is a cardio-selective beta-blocker which targets central systolic BP and reduces it significantly along with brachial BP. In this article, we will review the current literature to evaluate the role of central BP to diagnose hypertension in detail. We will also assess the clinical evidence to evaluate the role of nebivolol in the management of elevated central systolic BP. Central BP indices offer better estimation of BP in central arteries and should be considered in routine clinical practice.

We found that outward current recorded between -30 and +60\u00a0mV is carried primarily in BKCa channels in isolated horizontal cells of rats and mice. Whole-cell outward currents were maximal at +50\u00a0mV and declined at membrane potentials positive to this value. This current was eliminated by the selective BKCa channel blocker paxilline (100\u00a0nm), iberiotoxin (10\u00a0\u03bcm), Ca(2+) free solutions and divalent cation Cav channel blockers. It was activated by the BKCa channel activator NS1619 (30\u00a0\u03bcm).

The channels showed fast activation kinetics in response to Ca(2+) influx and inactivation gating that could be modified by intracellular protease treatment, which suggests \u03b2 subunit involvement. Under current clamp, block of BKCa current increased depolarizing membrane potential excursions, raising the average resting potential and producing oscillations. BKCa current activation with NS1619 inhibited oscillations and hyperpolarized the resting potential.

We calculated adjusted odds ratios [95% confidence intervals] to estimate the risk of specific CHDs associated with antihypertensive use during the month before conception through the third month of pregnancy, controlling for maternal age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, first trimester cigarette smoking, and NBDPS site. Overall, 164 (1.5%) case mothers and 102 (0.9%) control mothers reported early pregnancy antihypertensive use for their hypertension. We observed increased risk of 4 CHD phenotypes, regardless of antihypertensive medication class reported: coarctation of the aorta (2.50 [1.52-4.11]), pulmonary valve stenosis (2.19 [1.44-3.34]), perimembranous ventricular septal defect (1.90 [1.09-3.31]), and secundum atrial septal defect (1.94 [1.36-2.79]). The associations for these phenotypes were statistically significant for mothers who reported \u03b2-blocker use or renin-angiotensin system blocker use; estimates for other antihypertensive medication classes were generally based on fewer exposed cases and were less stable but remained elevated.

    "124": "In heart failure (HF), the heart cannot pump blood efficiently and is therefore unable to meet the body's demands of oxygen, and/or there is increased end-diastolic pressure. Current treatments for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotension receptor type 1 (AT1 ) antagonists, \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists, aldosterone receptor antagonists, diuretics, digoxin and a combination drug with AT1 receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor. In HF, the risk of readmission for hospital and mortality is markedly higher with a heart rate (HR) above 70 bpm. Here, we review the evidence regarding the use of ivabradine for lowering HR in HF. Ivabradine is a blocker of an I funny current (I(f)) channel and causes rate-dependent inhibition of the pacemaker activity in the sinoatrial node. In clinical trials of HFrEF, treatment with ivabradine seems to improve clinical outcome, for example improved ejection fraction (EF) and less readmission for hospital, but the effect appears most pronounced in patients with HRs above 70 bpm, while the effect on cardiovascular death appears less consistent. The adverse effects of ivabradine include bradycardia, atrial fibrillation and visual disturbances, but ivabradine avoids the negative inotrope effects observed with \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists. In conclusion, in patients with stable HFrEF with EF<35% and HR above 70 bpm, ivabradine improves the outcome and might be a first choice of therapy, if beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are not tolerated. Further studies must show whether that can be extended to HF patients with preserved EF.",

Adherence to \u03b2-blockers or to statins during a 365-day follow-up period was estimated in outpatient pharmacy claims using the proportion of days covered (PDC) in three ways: ignoring hospitalizations (PDC1); subtracting hospitalized days from the denominator (PDC2); and assuming drug use on all hospitalized days (PDC3). We compared these to an approach that incorporated inpatient drug use (PDC4).

We investigated this hypothesis using a linked dataset of the Eindhoven area of the Netherlands Cancer Registry and the PHARMO record linkage, including patients diagnosed with CRC between 1998 and 2011. Eligible patients were matched on propensity scores to control for potential confounders such as socio-demographic factors, comorbidity, cancer treatment and use of other medications. Controls were subsequently restricted to active comparators. The association between pre-diagnostic and time-dependent post-diagnostic beta-blocker use and overall survival was estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression models. Subgroup analyses by cancer site and stage and by beta-blocker type were conducted. Of 8,100 CRC patients with a median follow-up of 6.6 years, 1,813 (22%) used beta-blockers prior to diagnosis. In multivariate analysis, we observed no significant association in overall mortality for pre-diagnostic [hazard ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval (0.96-1.19)] and post-diagnostic [1.10 (0.98-1.23)] beta-blocker use, respectively. Analyses by beta-blocker type, by cancer site, cancer stage and by cumulative dose showed no significant survival improvements for beta-blocker users. However, there was a significant association between cumulative duration of use of 1-12 months and increased overall mortality [1.20 (1.03-1.39)]. Thus, our results do not support the hypothesis of a beneficial effect of pre- or post-diagnostic beta-blocker intake on CRC prognosis, neither for specific patient subgroups nor for specific types of beta-blockers.",

Ultrafast affinity extraction and peak profiling were used with AGP microcolumns to examine these processes for several model drugs (i.e., chlorpromazine, disopyramide, imipramine, lidocaine, propranolol and verapamil). The association equilibrium constants measured for these drugs with soluble AGP by ultrafast affinity extraction were in the general range of 10(4)-10(6)M(-1) at pH 7.4 and 37\u00b0C and gave good agreement with literature values. Some of these values were dependent on the relative drug and protein concentrations that were present when using a single-site binding model; these results suggested a more complex mixed-mode interaction was actually present, which was also then used to analyze the data. The apparent dissociation rate constants that were obtained by ultrafast affinity extraction when using a single-site model varied from 0.14 to 7.0s(-1) and were dependent on the relative drug and protein concentrations. Lower apparent dissociation rate constants were obtained by this approach as the relative amount of drug versus protein was decreased, with the results approaching those measured by peak profiling at low drug concentrations. This information should be useful in better understanding how these and other drugs interact with AGP in the circulation. In addition, the chromatographic approaches that were optimized and used in this report to examine these systems can be adapted for the analysis of other solute-protein interactions of biomedical interest.",

The MCER exhibited efficient removal performance in sole, binary, pre-loading and saline systems. The adsorption kinetics of Cu(2+) and ATL fitted both pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second order model, while better described by pseudo-second order model in binary system. In mixed Cu(2+) and ATL solution, the adsorption of ATL was suppressed due to direct competition of carboxylic groups, while Cu(2+) adsorption was enhanced because of the formation of surface complexes. This increasing in heterogeneity was demonstrated by adsorption isotherms, which were more suitable for Freundlich model in binary system, while better described by Langmuir model in sole system. As proved by FTIR and XPS spectra, both amino and hydroxyl groups of ATL could form complexes with Cu(2+). Decomplexing-bridging interaction was elucidated as the leading mechanism in coremoval of Cu(2+) and ATL, which involved [Cu-ATL] decomplexing and newly created Cu- or ATL sites for additional bridging. For saline system, the resulting competition and enhancement effects in mixed solution were amplified with the addition of co-existing cations.

Coronary vasospasm associated with pseudoephedrine has been reported in the literature. We discuss the case of a patient with new-onset atrial fibrillation receiving metoprolol for rate control on a background of pseudoephedrine use for allergic rhinitis leading to acute myocardial infarction from multivessel coronary vasospasm.

Based on currently available evidence, it can be interpreted that ivabradine may have a role in the treatment of patients who have a certain form of HF. So for patients with symptomatic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (EF \u2264 35%); that is, with the lower-left part of their heart not contracting well, with a heart rate of 70 beats per minute (bpm) or higher and for patients who are unable to tolerate optimal beta-blocker dosing. Of note, patients with HFrEF who have a heart rate greater than 77 bpm may be the ones to derive the most benefit from initiating ivabradine therapy. Ivabradine was evaluated in more than 10 clinical trials for a number of cardiovascular (CV) uses including coronary artery disease, angina, myocardial infarction, and HF. While an initial HF study, BEAUTIFUL (morBidity-mortality EvAlUaTion of the If inhibitor ivabradine in patients with coronary disease and left ventricULar dysfunction), did not find significant improvement in cardiac outcomes with ivabradine, findings from a prespecified subgroup of patients with a heart rate of 70 bpm or higher suggested a correlation between the resting heart rate and the risk of CV events; this observation led to further investigation of ivabradine for the treatment of HF. The clinical development of ivabradine continued with the SHIFT (Systolic Heart failure treatment with the If inhibitor ivabradine Trial) study. This study targeted patients with HFrEF, in sinus rhythm (i.e., normal heartbeat) and with a heart rate of 70 bpm or higher. The phase 3 trial evaluated the morbidity and mortality benefits of ivabradine as an add-on therapy to standard treatment for HF, including the use of a beta-blocker if tolerated, compared with placebo. Results showed that when ivabradine is added on to guidelines-based background therapy, there is a statistically significant decrease of 18% in the rate of primary end point (composite of CV death or hospital admission for worsening HF) compared with placebo. Of note, 89% of patients enrolled in the SHIFT trial were on beta-blockers. However, despite aiming to treat patients at the guidelines-specified target dose for beta-blockers, only 56% of patients were on at least 50% of the target dose and, 26% of patients were at target dose. The most common reasons for suboptimal dosing of beta-blocking therapy were hypotension and fatigue.",

In 2011, we published a prospective study, including patients with histologically confirmed malignant melanoma in stage II-IIIA. In total, 25% of them reported previous use of \u03b2-blockers that were administered at any time for any other diseases. After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, 34% of the patients in the untreated group showed disease progression. In contrast, only 3% of the patients in the treated group showed progression. We report the findings obtained in the same cohort after a longer period of \u03b2-blocker therapy and follow-up (8 years). We prospectively reviewed data of the patients enrolled in the original prospective study. Disease progression was assessed by evaluating the presence of lymphatic, in-transit or visceral metastases. Deaths by any cause and deaths because of melanoma were recorded. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the effect of \u03b2-blocker use on disease-free survival and overall survival, adjusting for significant confounders. After a median follow-up of 8 years and a median duration of \u03b2-blocker use of 7.6 years, 45% of the patients in the untreated group and 30% of the patients in the treated group showed disease progression. Notably, in the untreated group 35% patients died from melanoma and only 17% patients died from melanoma in the treated group. Results of this hospital-based prospective cohort study with a median follow-up of 8 years confirmed our previous results that the use of \u03b2-blockers significantly reduced the risk of recurrence and mortality in melanoma patients.",

    "192": "Common physiological manifestations of cocaine are related to its adrenergic effects, due to inhibition of dopamine and norepinephrine uptake at the postsynaptic terminal. Few studies have documented bradycardia secondary to cocaine use, representing the antithesis of its adrenergic effects. We assessed the prevalence of sinus bradycardia (SB) in habitual cocaine users and postulated a mechanism for this effect. One hundred sixty-two patients with a history of cocaine use were analyzed and compared with age- and gender-matched controls. SB was defined as a rate of <60 beats/min and habitual cocaine use as 2 or more documented uses >30\u00a0days apart. Propensity score-matching analysis was applied to balance covariates between cocaine users and nonusers and reduce selection bias. Patients with a history of bradycardia, hypothyroidism, or concomitant beta-blocker use were excluded. Mean age of study patients was 44 \u00b1 8\u00a0years. SB was observed in 43 of 162 (27%) cocaine users and in 9 of 149 (6%) nonusers (p\u00a0= 0.0001). Propensity score-matching analysis matched 218 patients from both groups. Among matched patients SB was observed in 25 of 109 (23%) cocaine users and in 5 of 109 (5%) nonusers (p\u00a0= 0.0001). Habitual cocaine use was an independent predictor of SB and associated with a sevenfold increase in the risk of SB (95% CI 2.52 to 19.74, p\u00a0= 0.0002). In conclusion, habitual cocaine use is a strong predictor of SB and was unrelated to recency of use. A potential mechanism for SB may be related to cocaine-induced desensitization of the beta-adrenergic receptor secondary to continuous exposure. Symptomatic SB was not observed; thus, pacemaker therapy was not indicated.",

Two cohorts were created of patients enrolled in Medicare Part D for the 12\u00a0months before 2007 and 2012. Patients were identified through a search for antiarrhythmic medication fills with a supply covering January 1 of the cohort year.

The 2007 (n\u00a0= 2,334) and 2012 (n\u00a0= 3,892) Medicare Part D cohorts had similar demographics: median age 76\u00a0years, 64%-67% male, and 87%-89% white. Of the 2007 cohort, 1,380 (59%) patients were on a beta blocker, and 484 (20.7%) were on an antiarrhythmic medication (70% amiodarone and 20% sotalol).

    "198": "Nebivolol (NEB) is one of the top-sold prescription drugs belonging to the third generation of beta-blockers. However, so far, occurrence data in the environment are lacking. Within this study NEB has been found for the first time in effluent samples of wastewater treatment plants in Germany with an average concentration of 13\u00a0ng\u00a0L(-1). Its photodegradation behavior in the environment and in technical processes is largely unknown. To fill this gap, three different UV treatment procedures (UV-C at 254\u00a0nm, UV-B at 312\u00a0nm and UV-A at 365\u00a0nm) were investigated in three different matrices: pure water, pure water in presence of the hydroxyl radical (OH) scavenger tert.-butanol and real wastewater. No elimination was observed during UV-A treatment. In contrast, NEB degradation during UV-B and UV-C treatment followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics, with highest removal rate during UV-C treatment in pure water (k\u00a0=\u00a07.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-4)\u00a0s(-1)). The rate constant for UV-C irradiation decreased to 2.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-4)\u00a0s(-1) in the presence of the OH scavenger and in the presence of the wastewater matrix. The rate constant for the UV-B lamp was 4.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-4)\u00a0s(-1), Three transformation products were identified after UV-B and UV-C photolytic degradation using high resolution mass spectrometry. The main photoreaction is the substitution of the fluorine atoms of NEB by hydroxyl groups. A photolytic cleavage of the CF bond can be excluded as the high bond dissociation energy of aromatic CF bonds (525\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol(-1)), exceeds the energy of electromagnetic radiation applied in the present study (\u2265254\u00a0nm, i.e., max. 471\u00a0kJ\u00a0E(-1)). The quantum yields for NEB degradation for the UV-C lamp achieved in pure water, the OH scavenged system and wastewater matrix were \u03a6deg\u00a0=\u00a00.53, 0.19 and 0.22, respectively. For UV-B \u03a6deg was 0.023\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.003, noticeable differences in quantum yield were not found. The photooxidation involves reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and singlet oxygen.

After successful cardioversion the horse displayed supraventricular ectopy and atrial contractile dysfunction and was administered sotalol hydrochloride in an attempt to decrease the risk of AF recurrence. Supraventricular ectopy and echocardiographic evidence of atrial dysfunction gradually improved and normalized over 6 months. No direct adverse effects of the chronic anti-arrhythmic treatment were observed and libido and semen quality were unaffected. AF recurred 6 months after cardioversion and sotalol therapy was continued to control the ventricular ectopy/aberrant ventricular conduction during semen collection.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most important comorbidities of CVD, which causes serious consequences in patients with ischemic heart disease, stroke, arrhythmia, and heart failure. COPD shares common risk factors such as tobacco smoking and aging with CVD, is associated with less physical activity, and produces systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Overall, patients with COPD have a 2-3-fold increased risk of CVD as compared to age-matched controls when adjusted for tobacco smoking. Chronic heart failure (HF) is a frequent and important comorbidity which has a significant impact on prognosis in COPD, and vice versa. HF overlaps in symptoms and signs and has a common comorbidity with COPD, so that diagnosis of COPD is difficult in patients with HF. The combination of HF and COPD presents many therapeutic challenges including beta-blockers (BBs) and beta-agonists. Inhaled long-acting bronchodilators including beta2-agonists and anticholinergics for COPD would not worsen HF. Diuretics are relatively safe, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are preferred to treat HF accompanied with COPD. BBs are only relatively contraindicated in asthma, but not in COPD. Low doses of cardioselective BBs should be aggressively initiated in clinically stable patients with HF accompanied with COPD combined with close monitoring for signs of airway obstruction and gradually up-titrated to the maximum tolerated dose. Encouraging appropriate and aggressive treatment for both HF and COPD should be recommended to improve quality of life and mortality in HF patients with COPD.", 
    "214": "Cardiac arrhythmias are one of the main causes of death in ChCP and other dilated cardiomyopathies. Previous studies demonstrated that ventricular arrhythmias are associated with the presence of autoantibodies with beta-adrenergic activity, Ab-\u03b2.", 
    "215": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether Ab-\u03b2, present in chronic chagasic patients (ChCP), induce cardiac arrhythmias in the pharmacological type-2 long QT syndrome model (LQTS-2).", 
    "216": "The LQTS2 was established by perfusion of Tyrode saline solution with a potassium channel blocker E-4031 (5\u03bcM) in isolated rabbit hearts or in rabbit cardiac strips, in order to record ECG or action potential, respectively. Autoantibodies from ChCP activating (Ab-\u03b2) or not (Ab-NR) cardiac beta 1-adrenergic receptors were used. Ab-\u03b2, but not Ab-NR, were able to significantly shorten QT, QTc and increase Tpeak-Tend interval in the LQTS-2. A positive correlation between higher QTc and Tpeak-Tend was found after Ab-\u03b2 perfusion in the same model. In addition, in the LQTS-2 model, in almost 75% (11/15) of the hearts perfused with Ab-\u03b2, ventricular and atrio-ventricular electrical disturbances were observed. Atenolol abolished all Ab-\u03b2-induced arrhythmias. Ab-\u03b2, when perfused in a cellular LQTS-2, drastically reduced the action potential duration and evoked early afterdepolarization (EAD's), while Ab-NR did not modulate the AP properties in the LQTS-2.", 
    "217": "The results indicate that Ab-\u03b2 were able to induce cardiac arrhythmias and EAD's. This phenomenon can explain, at least in part, the cellular mechanism of Ab-\u03b2-induced arrhythmias. Furthermore, atenolol is effective for the treatment of Ab-\u03b2-induced arrhythmias.", 
    "218": "Catamenial epilepsy is a common central nervous system disease in female, which is influenced by the 17-\u03b2-estradiol (estrogen) level during the menstrual cycle. Low level (<0.05ng/ml) of estrogen normally accompanies with the perimenstrual classification of catamenial epilepsy, however, without clear mechanism. In previous studies, estrogen has been demonstrated to possess widely regulatory effects on potassium channels. Here, the effect of 17-\u03b2-estradiol on modulating inwardly rectifying K(+) (Kir) currents was investigated in cultured hippocampal neurons. The underlying mechanism was also detected.", 
    "219": "In this research, null-estrogen cultures and spaying animals were used to mimicked the low level estrogen condition in menstrual period. Patch clamp recordings, western blotting and pharmacological experiments were performed to detect the effects of estrogen receptors and the underlying mechanisms.", 
    "220": "Compared to those neurons in normal medium (with 0.1ng/ml estrogen), null-estrogen cultures or neurons treated by estrogen receptor blocker (ICI 182,780) both had significant suppressed Kir currents. The expression level of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K(+) channel subunit 1 (GIRK1) was significantly decreased in spaying animals. Furthermore, a GIRK channel inhibitor (TPQ) similarly suppressed the Kir currents. Lastly, estrogen deficiency, estrogen receptor blocker and GIRK channel inhibitor all promoted the epileptiform bursting activities in neurons, as a result of Kir current suppression.", 
    "221": "Taken together, 17-\u03b2-estradiol, by the activation of estrogen receptors, is essential for the maintenance of Kir currents, and thus has an inhibitory effect on the epileptiform bursting activities in cultured hippocampal neurons, whereas GIRK1 is the major intermedial mediator. This research provides a new mechanism for the pathogenesis of catamenial epilepsy, particularly in the menstrual period and the early section of follicular phase.", 
    "222": "We propose a simple and reliable score, performance score ('PERFSCORE'), that allows cardiologists to assess the achievement of therapeutic goals.", 
    "223": "We identified six indicators of cardiac rehabilitation performance: heart rate (HR) less than 70\u200abeats/min; blood pressure (BP) less than 140/90 mmHg; smoking cessation or non-smokers; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) more than 40%; LDLc less than 100\u200amg/dl or more than 70\u200amg/dl if diabetic; and on treatment at least with three drugs among angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs), \u03b2-blockers, statins, and ASA. These six indicators are considered to be the collective expression of a latent variable measuring performance. To assess the relative contribution of each indicator in the definition of cardiac rehabilitation performance, we fitted a structural equation model using the 'Stata 13' system.", 
    "224": "A total of 839 consecutive patients were analyzed; 49% had recent ST- elevation myocardial infarction/non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and 51% had undergone elective percutaneous coronary intervention/coronary artery bypass graft. At the end of cardiac rehabilitation, LVEF was 55\u200a\u00b1\u200a11%; HR, 69\u200a\u00b1\u200a13\u200abeats/min; SBP, 135\u200a\u00b1\u200a20\u200ammHg; DBP, 79\u200a\u00b1\u200a10\u200ammHg; LDLc, 88\u200a\u00b1\u200a29\u200amg/dl; 56% had stopped smoking; 71% were on \u03b2-blockers; 78% ACE inhibitors or ARBs; 87% were on statins, and 96% were on ASA. Weights for each indicator in the PERFSCORE were 0.57 for HR, 0.40 for BP, 0.87 for LVEF, 0.78 for smoking, 0.42 for LDLc, and 0.75 for drugs, multiplied by 1 if the target has been reached, otherwise by 0. Higher performance values correspond to better cardiac rehabilitation results. The point range was 0-36: less than 24, not satisfying cardiac rehabilitation; 24-29, satisfying cardiac rehabilitation; and more than 29, optimal cardiac rehabilitation.", 
    "225": "In conclusion, we propose an easy algorithm to calculate the success of cardiac rehabilitation.", 
    "226": "Congenital hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (HH) can occur in isolation or it may present as part of a wider syndrome. For approximately 40%-50% of individuals with this condition, sequence analysis of the known HH genes identifies a causative mutation. Identifying the underlying genetic aetiology in the remaining cases is important as a genetic diagnosis will inform on recurrence risk, may guide medical management and will provide valuable insights into \u03b2-cell physiology. We sequenced the exome of a child with persistent diazoxide-responsive HH, mild aortic insufficiency, severe hypotonia, and developmental delay as well as the unaffected parents. This analysis identified a de novo mutation, p.G403D, in the proband's CACNA1D gene. CACNA1D encodes the main L-type voltage-gated calcium channel in the pancreatic \u03b2-cell, a key component of the insulin secretion pathway. The p.G403D mutation had been reported previously as an activating mutation in an individual with primary hyper-aldosteronism, neuromuscular abnormalities, and transient hypoglycaemia. Sequence analysis of the CACNA1D gene in 60 further cases with HH did not identify a pathogenic mutation. Identification of an activating CACNA1D mutation in a second patient with congenital HH confirms the aetiological role of CACNA1D mutations in this disorder. A genetic diagnosis is important as treatment with a calcium channel blocker may be an option for the medical management of this patient.", 
    "227": "Propranolol, a nonselective blocker of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, has become the first-line treatment for complicated infantile hemangiomas. Therefore, its use in the pediatric population has expanded in recent years. In adults, \u03b2-blockers have been reported to be the most common causative agents for drug-induced psoriasis. In infants treated with propranolol for infantile hemangioma, the onset of psoriasiform diaper rash has not yet been reported. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of psoriasiform diaper rash possibly induced by oral propranolol in an 18-month-old girl with no family history of psoriasis.", 
    "228": "Beta-blocker use is common in the cases with coronary artery bypass surgery. According to the literature, beta-blockers have positive effects but may cause erectile dysfunction (ED). The most commonly used beta-blockers in ischemic cardiac disease are nebivolol and metoprolol. In our clinic, we aimed to compare the effects of nebivolol and metoprolol succinate on ED in the sexually active cases with coronary artery bypass surgery.", 
    "229": "In our clinic, a total of 119 patients with coronary artery bypass surgery were included in the study. International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) Test was used to evaluate whether the patients had ED and to grade the cases.", 
    "230": "No significant difference was found in terms of anti-ischemic efficacy between metoprolol succinate and nebivolol in the postoperative period; however, the incidence of any grade ED was %85.96 in Group 1, %83.87 in Group 2. This difference was considered as statistically significant (p = 0.036).", 
    "231": "Beta-blocker use increases the risk of ED in cases with ischemic cardiac disease. We suggest that the complaints of ED could be less frequent with nebivolol use in sexually active cases with ischemic cardiac disease.", 
    "232": "There are limited accurate 30-day heart failure (HF) readmission risk scores using readily available clinical patient information on a well-defined HF cohort. We analyzed 1,475 admissions discharged from our hospital with a primary diagnosis of HF between 2010 and 2012. HF diagnostic criteria included satisfying clinical Framingham criteria, elevated serum N-terminal pro-natriuretic peptide, and evidence of cardiac dysfunction on transthoracic echocardiography. The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups; 60% were used as the derivation cohort and 40% as the validation cohort. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were used to develop the model. Weighted risk scores were derived from the odds ratio of the logistic regression model. Total risk scores were computed by simple summation for each patient. The 7 significant independent predictors of 30-day HF readmission used to derive the risk scoring tool were the number of previous HF-related admission in the preceding 1\u00a0year, index admission length of stay, serum creatinine level, electrocardiograph QRS duration, serum N-terminal pro-natriuretic peptide level, number of Medical Social Service needs, and \u03b2 blocker prescription on discharge. The area under the curve was 0.76. Sensitivity and specificity were 78.3% and 60.7%, respectively. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 18.9% and 96%, respectively. The actual observed and predicted 30-day heart failure readmission rates matched. In conclusion, we have developed the first 30-day HF readmission risk score, with good discriminatory ability, for an urban multiethnic Asian heart failure cohort with stringent diagnostic criteria. It consists of 7 easily obtained variables.", 
    "233": "Pyogenic granulomas, acquired vascular lesions, form on the ocular or palpebral surface related to inflammation from chalazia, trauma, or surgery. They can be unsightly, spontaneously bleed, and cause irritation to patients.", 
    "234": "A case series is presented of 4 consecutive children with acquired ocular surface pyogenic granulomas treated at Boston Children's Hospital from 2014 to 2016 with only topical timolol, 0.5%, twice daily for a minimum of 21 days. In all cases, complete resolution occurred within the treatment period with no recurrence for at least 3 months. There were no adverse effects from the timolol during follow-up.", 
    "235": "This case series of 4 children, while limited to no greater than 12 weeks of follow-up and without control children, suggests that ocular surface pyogenic granulomas respond to topical timolol treatment, which has a lower adverse-effect profile than conventional topical steroid treatments or other medical or surgical therapies. If confirmed in larger studies with longer follow-up and controls, this may be the desired treatment modality.", 
    "236": "A new sensitive LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of atenolol in human plasma and milk has been developed for clinical lactation studies.", 
    "237": "Atenolol and the internal standard, phenazone, were extracted from biological matrices by protein precipitation. A Phenomenex(\u00ae) C-18 column and gradient chromatographic conditions were used for separation of the analyte, followed by detection with MS. Stability of samples was confirmed for atenolol in human plasma and milk for up to 3 months. Linearity range of 1-800 ng/ml (r(2) = 0.9995), the precision within 15% CV and the recovery of the analyte (80-100% range) were achieved.", 
    "238": "A new validated analytical method for atenolol in plasma and milk was developed.", 
    "239": "Survival following ovarian cancer diagnosis is generally low; understanding factors related to prognosis could be important to optimize treatment. The role of previously diagnosed comorbidities and use of medications for those conditions in relation to prognosis for ovarian cancer patients has not been studied extensively, particularly according to histological subtype.", 
    "240": "Using pooled data from fifteen studies participating in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium, we examined the associations between history of hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and medications taken for these conditions and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) among patients diagnosed with invasive epithelial ovarian carcinoma. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for age and stage to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) overall and within strata of histological subtypes.", 
    "241": "History of diabetes was associated with increased risk of mortality (n\u2009=\u20097,674; HR\u2009=\u20091.12; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.01-1.25). No significant mortality associations were observed for hypertension (n\u2009=\u20096,482; HR\u2009=\u20090.95; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.88-1.02) or heart disease (n\u2009=\u20094,252; HR\u2009=\u20091.05; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.87-1.27). No association of these comorbidities was found with PFS in the overall study population. However, among patients with endometrioid tumors, hypertension was associated with lower risk of progression (n\u2009=\u2009339, HR\u2009=\u20090.54; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.35-0.84). Comorbidity was not associated with OS or PFS for any of the other histological subtypes. Ever use of beta blockers, oral antidiabetic medications, and insulin was associated with increased mortality, HR\u2009=\u20091.20; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.03-1.40, HR\u2009=\u20091.28; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.05-1.55, and HR\u2009=\u20091.63; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.20-2.20, respectively. Ever use of diuretics was inversely associated with mortality, HR\u2009=\u20090.71; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.53-0.94.", 
    "242": "Histories of hypertension, diabetes, and use of diuretics, beta blockers, insulin, and oral antidiabetic medications may influence the survival of ovarian cancer patients. Understanding mechanisms for these observations could provide insight regarding treatment."
