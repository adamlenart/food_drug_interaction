The effects of verapamil and procaine on guinea pig platelet aggregation were also examined. All of these agents including verapamil and procaine showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation, and their relative potencies determined on the basis of the molar concentrations producing a 50% inhibition of ADP-induced aggregation were in descending order: IPS-339 greater than propranolol greater than verapamil greater than dl-D-32 not equal to d-D-32 greater than pindolol greater than procaine greater than atenolol. This order of relative potencies of the inhibitory actions of these test compounds on platelet aggregation was well correlated to those of local anaesthetic action in guinea pigs (r = 0.932, P less than 0.01) and lipophilicity (r = -0.899, P less than 0.01), while it did not agree with the orders of potency of beta-adrenoceptor blocking action, intrinsic sympathomimetic action and vasodilator action. From these results, it may be reasonable to propose that inhibitory actions of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents and local anaesthetics on platelet aggregation are caused through the same mechanism or through a very similar one.", 
    "1": "Membrane potential and flavoprotein redox state have been measured simultaneously and continuously in brown adipose tissue in order to determine how nerve stimulation and adrenergic agonists control its metabolic activity. Both trains of nerve impulses and addition of noradrenaline evoke two temporally distinct cell depolarizations. The first rapid depolarization precedes the increase in flavoprotein reduction. With nerve stimulation, at the time of maximum flavoprotein reduction the cell has repolarized or hyperpolarized. The second slow depolarization follows flavoprotein reduction. Phentolamine, an alpha antagonist, selectively blocks the first depolarization, but not the flavoprotein reduction. However the time of maximum flavoprotein reduction is delayed. Propranolol, a beta antagonist, delays the first repolarization until the end of nerve stimulation and inhibits the transient hyperpolarization, second depolarization and flavoprotein reduction. Isoproterenol, a beta agonist, or the fatty acid octanoate produce only a transient hyperpolarization and subsequent slow depolarization following flavoprotein reduction. Thus brown adipose tissue contains both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. Stimulation of alpha receptors produces an early membrane depolarization. Stimulation of beta receptors leads to an increase in metabolic activity which then appears to produce slow changes in membrane potential.", 
    "2": "Nifedipine is a strong calcium antagonist; it blocks the excitation-contraction coupling, yet at therapeutic dosage levels it has few side effects. It is said that a single molecule of nifedipine can neutralize the effects of several thousand calcium ions in the excitation-process. Thus this agent reduces the ability of the cardiac cells to develop mechanical tension yet it does not affect electrical excitation. Calcium antagonists are also potent dilators, particularly of the arteries on the periphery of the human body and in the coronary arterial system. The basic mode of action is thought to be the same, i.e. reduction of the calcium transport, this time into the smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall, thus \"forcing' the arteriole to dilate. The resultant action is a reduction in afterload, while there is an increase in perfusion of the coronary vascular bed. Thus there is a dual action, the one centrally, the other peripherally both of which will be particularly effective in patients with unstable angina (UA) in whom excess coronary vascular tone is suspected. Beta-blockers, particularly propranolol and metoprolol, with which we have the most experience, work via beta 2 adrenoceptor blockade in the heart. Cardiac frequency decreases, arrhythmias are suppressed, blood pressure may decrease, all reducing cardiac work. If in UA variations in coronary vascular tone and frank spasm do occur then is would be more logical to use Ca-antagonists instead of beta-blockade. Our clinical experience to date has not shown that patients with UA are worsened by propranolol or metoprolol but there are scores of clinical reports showing worsening of chest pain in Prinzmetal's syndrome, presumably because beta-blockade leads to excessive alpha-adrenergic vascular tone. On the other hand, in one year experience with 73 patients with UA, 52 did not experience relief from adequate beta-blockade until nifedipine was added. Within 2 hours, 42 of the 52 became asymptomatic--thus indicating that in UA the need for spasmolytic therapy prevails over the need for beta-blockade. In many cases of UA both drugs may have a place however, their exact relative value remains to be established.", 
    "3": "The limitations of medical treatment in angina pectoris depend on its efficacity and indications. 1. Efficacity of medical treatment.--Anti-anginal drugs are able to relieve anginal pain in at least 3/4 of cases. However, the ability of medical measures (diet, exercise, stopping smoking, hypolipidemic drugs, antihypertensive drugs, anticoagulants, platelet anti-aggregants, antiarrhythmics, inotropic agents, vasodilators and diuretics) to prevent coronary atherosclerosis delay its progression and prevent its complications--so increasing the life expectancy of coronary patients--remains very uncertain. 2. Frontiers and judications of medical treatment.--Coronary patients with few or no symptoms appear to be best suited for long-term anti-anginal treatment with long acting nitrate derivatives and/or betablockers. The ability of the latter group to increase the life expectancy of all coronary patients remains to be shown. The limits of the indications of medical treatment are more difficult to define either by purely subjective criteria (incapacitating angina after trials of anti-anginal drugs at adapted doses) or by \"objective\" criteria (ergometry, coronary angiography).", 
    "4": "The first objective is to correct any existing coronary risk factors but this must be achieved with discrimination. Smoking should be strictly forbidden, hypertension reduced and a more active life style encouraged. However, a more nuanced approach should be adopted towards dietetic problems, obesity and disorders of lipid metabolism. It is also very important to teach the patient to use glyceryl trinitrate correctly in the double objective of relieving pain as quickly as possible and of preventing pain by using it in certain critical situations. Clinical practice shows that patients often use glyceryl trinitrate too sparingly. When these general measures have been settled, treatment must be adapted to each particular situation. The patient's age, the frequency of attacks, trigger factors, the repercussions of the disease on the patient's life all have to be considered before deciding on the individual's treatment. In younger patients, a controlled exercise ECG is essential for selecting patients for surgery. The drugs of choice for stable angina are the betablockers which have been shown to be effective and well tolerated. When this group of drugs cannot be used or is ineffective, other major anti-anginal drugs may be chosen according to the individual terrain and their known secondary effects.", 
    "5": "The authors report a case of congenital valvular aortic stenosis associated with echocardiographic and angiographic appearances of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. After valvular replacement and partial myotomy a high intraventricular pressure gradient (125 mmHg) with low intra aortic pressure was recorded. High dose intravenous propranolol (25 mg in 2 hours) reduced this gradient to 50 mmHg allowing cardiopulmonary bypass to be discontinued. This clinical combination is associated with a risk of aggravation of the intra-ventricular obstructive phenomenon when the obstacle to left ventricular ejection is relieved: surgical myotomy was performed in similar, previously published cases. High doses betablocker therapy can be performed in similar, previously published cases. High dose betablocker therapy can be useful in this association and it may also be instituted when right intraventricular pressure gradient increase after relief of pulmonary valvular stenosis.", 
    "6": "Three randomised therapeutic protocols were studied: thyrocalcitonin, beta-blockers and the combination of Grisefuline + Penthonium, in a group of 95 cases of algodystrophy (64 women, 31 men). These cases were divided into four groups: upper limb, lower limb, \"recent\" or \"long-standing\". The results were assessed after one month of treatment. A positive result was defined as being an improvement of more than 50 p. cent of the clinical subjective and objective criteria; less than that, the activity is uncertain or nil. Comparison of the results did not reveal any statistically significant difference between the three proposed treatments, whether we consider the whole group of patients or each sub-group separately (overall positive results: Calsyn 100 = 53 p. cent, Visken = 42,5 p. cent, Grisefuline + Penthonium = 53 p. cent). The important role played by rehabilitation must be stressed. It should be discontinued during the acute phase and instituted in the later phase. Cure is obtained after an average of 4-5 months of treatment. 10 patients were left with major trophic sequelae after 2 years of the disease; all involve the hand.", 
    "7": "The acute effects of intravenous nadolol (0.01 and 0.02 mg/kg) on cardiac electrophysiologic parameters were assessed with His bundle recording and programmed atrial stimulation. The higher dose of nadolol reduced resting heart rate (71 vs. 65 beats/min, P less than 0.02), and the degree of slowing was related to the initial heart rate (r = -0.68, P less than 0.05). Atrioventricular conduction time as defined by the paced A-H interval, rose by 12 msec (P less than 0.001) after nadolol (0.02 mg/kg) administration. Atrial refractoriness increased (by 10 msec, P less than 0.02) only at the higher dose level with nadolol. At both dose levels, atrioventricular nodal effective and functional refractory periods were increased (P less than 0.02) by a mean of 45 and 21 msec, respectively, suggesting greater sensitivity of atrioventricular nodal refractoriness to beta-adrenergic blockade. Nadolol's effects were generally similar to those of previously reported studies with other beta-adrenergic blockers. These data suggest that nadolol slows conduction through the atrioventricular node and increases atrial and atrioventricular nodal refractoriness.", 
    "8": "Serum T4, T3, rT3 and T3 resin uptake (T3 RU) were measured before and after 7 days of treatment with either propranolol, alprenolol, sotalol, atenolol or metoprolol in hyperthyroid patients. We found a significant decrease in serum T3 after propranolol, alprenolol, atenolol and metoprolol but no change in the sotalol treated group. A significant increase in rT3 was found in the propranolol and alprenolol treated groups whereas a significant fall in rT3 was found in the atenolol and metoprolol treated groups. No change was found in the sotalol treated group. The changes observed in serum T3 and in rT3 could be explained by an inhibition of the 5'deiodinase enzyme by propranolol and alprenolol and an inhibition of both the 5'deiodinase and 5 deiodinase enzymes caused by atenolol and metoprolol.", 
    "9": "1 The effects of a single oral dose of 600 mg of prizidilol on renal function were studied 5 to 6 h after dosing in six normal subjects and eight patients with essential hypertension. 2 Mean arterial blood pressure was reduced to 92% of the control value in normal subjects and to 75% in hypertensive patients. Heart rate increased slightly. 3 In normal subjects, effective renal plasma flow was increased to 107% of control values while glomerular filtration rate (83%), filtration fraction (79%), sodium (84%) and potassium (50%) clearances were significantly decreased. 4 In hypertensive subjects, effective renal plasma flow was increased to 120% of control values, while glomerular filtration rate (67%), filtration fraction (57%), sodium (27%) and potassium (72%) clearances were significantly decreased. 5 Plasma noradrenaline increased significantly in normal subjects (150%) and in patients (173%). Plasma renin activity, aldosterone and epinephrine levels did not change consistently. 6 The results indicate that the acute effects of prizidilol on blood pressure and renal function are more marked in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects. Prizidilol increases renal plasma flow like hydralazine and depresses glomerular filtration rate and fractional sodium excretion like endralazine. In addition to the fall in arterial pressure, efferent vasodilation and/or a specific effect on the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient Kf may account for the striking decrease in filtration fraction.", 
    "10": "The effect of sulfhydryl compounds on binding of the beta-adrenergic antagonist (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol [(-)-[3H]DHA] to a microsomal fraction from rabbit skeletal muscle was examined. Inhibition of binding by a variety of adrenergic agonists and antagonists and the effects of these agents on adenylate cyclase were consistent with the beta-adrenergic receptor in this tissue being of the beta 2-subtype. Binding of (-)-[3H]DHA was reduced by incubating the membranes with dithiols such as dithiothreitol (DTT), 1,3-dimercapto-2-propanol and 1,4-dimercaptobutane; monothiols were much less potent. DTT-induced decline in (-)-[3H]DHA binding resulted primarily from a decrease in receptor number. Inactivation was partially reversed by the oxidant H2O2. Binding sites could be locked in the inactivated state by incubating DTT-treated membranes with the alkylating agent iodoacetamide. Both beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists protected against inactivation. Adenylate cyclase activity in the membranes was increased by DTT. The enzyme was rapidly inactivated by H2O2, and this could be partially reversed by DTT. It is concluded that the beta-adrenergic receptor of skeletal muscle contains an essential disulfide moiety which can be inactivated by reducing dithiols. Adenylate cyclase, on the other hand, contains at least one essential sulfhydryl which is preserved by dithiols.", 
    "11": "Myocardial beta-adrenoceptors mediate physiological effects of the agonists noradrenaline und adrenaline and stimulant effects of related amines and beta-blockers. At least 2 beta-adrenoceptor subtypes appear to contribute to the mediation of physiological effects. beta-adrenoceptor subtypes have recently been found with selective beta-blockers and nonphysiological agonists in several heart regions. However, no evidence has yet been reported that the affinity of a physiological agonist for cardiac beta-adrenoceptor subtypes differs. The possibility is discussed that an agonist may cause greater conformational change of one subtype than of another while binding to the same extent to both beta-adrenoceptor populations. The affinity of catecholamines for beta-adrenoceptors is low. Marked positive inotropic and chronotropic effects occur with catecholamine concentrations causing low beta-adrenoceptor occupancy and barely suprathreshold stimulation of the adenylyl cyclase. The large beta-adrenoceptor reserve and adenylyl cyclase reserve enable the regulation of the sinoatrial pacemaker activity and of ventricular and atrial contractility. Thus exposure to high catecholamine concentrations causes a pronounced decrease of Vmax for the adenylyl cyclase with a concurrent decrease in inotropic and chronotropic potencies, but without decreasing maximum inotropic and chronotropic effects of catecholamines. Data from isolated human myocardium suggest that the intropic potency of catecholamines is lower and the adenylyl cyclase reserve smaller than in other species. Pindolol, its derivatives, and some other partial agonists only cause positive chronotropic effects at concentrations considerably higher than those required to half-saturate cardiac beta-receptors.", 
    "12": "The distribution of adenylate cyclase activity in several discrete areas of brain in the goldfish (Carassius auratus) and the responsiveness of this activity in the optic tectum to various neurotransmitters were studied. Adenylate cyclase activity was found to have an uneven distribution in the brain, the highest concentrations occurring in the telencephalon. A dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase was found in the optic tectum. The increase in cAMP formation induced by dopamine was selectively prevented by antagonists at post-synaptic dopamine receptors linked to adenylate cyclase.", 
    "13": "In rabbit lung membranes known to contain both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors it was studied whether changes in incubation temperature may affect binding characteristics and/or selectivity of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor drugs. For this purpose inhibition of binding of the highly specific beta-adrenoceptor radioligand (+/-)-125iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) by beta 1-and beta 2-selective as well as non-selective drugs was determined at incubation temperatures of 37 degrees C and 18 degrees C and analyzed by Hofstee-plots. 1. The density of beta-adrenoceptors in rabbit lung membranes was identical independently of the incubation temperature. 2. At both incubation temperatures beta 1- and beta 2-selective drugs showed biphasic displacement curves and non-linear Hofstee-plots, while inhibition of binding by the non-selective drugs resulted in monophasic displacement curves with linear Hofstee-plots. With decreasing temperature affinity of antagonists to beta-adrenoceptors increased only slightly, while affinity of agonists increased markedly. 3. For all beta 1- and beta 2-selective drugs the same ratio beta 1/beta 2-adrenoceptors was calculated from the Hofstee-plots independently of the incubation temperature: It amounted to about 80% beta 1- and 20% beta 2-adrenoceptors in rabbit lung. 4. At an incubation temperature of 37 degrees C the displacement curve of the agonist isoprenaline was biphasic in the absence of GTP with a non-linear Hofstee-plot indicating that at 37 degrees C isoprenaline binds to high and low affinity states of the beta-adrenoceptors in rabbit lung. At 18 degrees C, however, beta-adrenoceptors do not form the high affinity GTP-sensitive complex with agonists, since GTP had no influence on isoprenaline displacement curves. 5. It is concluded that a decrease in the incubation temperature of ICYP binding assay from 37 degrees C to 18 degrees C does neither alter the relative amount of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in rabbit lung membranes nor the selectivity of beta 1- and beta 2-selective adrenoceptor drugs.", 
    "14": "This paper presents the results of a study on the effect of Metipranolol eye drops (Betamann) in 10 patients. The drops were tested with the following forms of glaucoma: glaucoma associated with alpha-kia, neovascular glaucoma, exfoliative glaucoma, pigmentary glaucoma, juvenile glaucoma. Some patients required treatment in combination with miotics. Metipranolol eye drops reduced intraocular pressure by about 15 percent for a prolonged period of time. The pressure-lowering effect was maintained during an observation period of twelve months. Visual acuity and visual fields were constant. The drug was tolerated well subjectively by almost all the patients.", 
    "15": "Elevated intraocular pressure during the first few days after routine intracapsular cataract extraction with and without alpha-chymotrypsin is a well-known symptom. A prospective, double-blind study was conducted to determine whether Metipranolol would prevent this increase in pressure. In 40 eyes which underwent routine, uncomplicated cataract extraction a drop of either Metipranolol 0,6% or placebo was administered before and during the first days after surgery. Prophylactic Metipranolol 0,6% can substantially reduce the incidence of severe early postoperative ocular hypertension.", 
    "16": "An experimental study in dogs with intact thoracic cavity under morphine-chloralose narcosis featured coronary catheterization, extracorporeal perfusion and resistography as well as catheterization of the heart cavities and the coronary sinus. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were recorded simultaneously. PO2, PCO2 and pH were measured in the inflowing and outflowing blood. The effect of insulin on circulatory response in acute hypoxic hypoxia was examined before and after obsidan block of beta-adrenoreactive systems. Insulin administered after the obsidan beta-adrenergic block was found to limit coronary dilatation and reduce myocardial oxygen consumption in a more pronounced measure. It is suggested that the effect of insulin on coronary dilatation is due to reduced myocardial oxygen consumption resulting from its action on the heart's beta-adrenergic systems.", 
    "17": "Exercise-induced lipolysis and hormones possibly involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism in association with exercise (plasma catecholamines, ACTH, HGH, TSH, insulin) were studied in 11 WHO stage 1 to 2 hypertensive men (mean age 37 years) during a 30-min steady-state submaximal (65% of VO2 max) and near-maximal exercise seated on a bicycle ergometer. To assess the contribution of the sympathetic system to the regulation of lipolysis and to define the type of beta-receptors mediating the catecholamine effects on lipolysis, all patients were again studied under identical conditions after a 4-week treatment with the beta-1-beta-2-receptor antagonist pindolol (15 mg daily) and with the beta-1-receptor blocker acebutolol (500 mg daily). Eight patients were even restudied after a 16-month treatment with acebutolol. Plasma glycerol levels increased progressively (P less than 0.001) during exercise reflecting increased exercise-induced lipolysis. The concomitant significant rise of noradrenaline, adrenaline, ACTH, and HGH and the parallel fall in plasma insulin suggest that all these hormones are involved in the adjustment of exercise-induced lipolysis. However, the impaired catecholamine-induced lipolysis under beta-receptor blockade was not accompanied by significant compensatory increases of ACTH, HGH, or TSH or a fall in insulin during exercise. Both beta-receptor antagonists resulted in a similar 27% inhibition of lipolysis confirming that the catecholamine-induced increase of lipolysis is mainly mediated via beta-1-adrenoceptors. After 16 months of treatment with acebutolol, the degree of inhibition of the exercise-induced lipolysis was unchanged. However, FFA were significantly reduced (28%, P less than 0.05) and HGH significantly (100%, P less than 0.05) increased.", 
    "18": "Muricide in olfactory bulbectomized rats (OB rats) is readily inhibited by systemic administration of desipramine (DMI) or microinjection of DMI and noradrenaline (NA) into the medial amygdaloid nucleus. The present experiment investigated whether the muricide inhibition produced by these forms of drug treatment was mediated by alpha- or beta-noradrenergic receptors in the central nervous system. Muricide inhibition produced by systemic administration of DMI was antagonized by an alpha-blocker phenoxybenzamine but unaffected by a beta-blocker sotalol, although administration of these adrenergic blockers alone had no effect on muricide. Muricide inhibition induced by the microinjection of DMI and NA into the medial amygdaloid nucleus was similarly antagonized by pretreatment of phenoxybenzamine injected into the same site, but sotalol had no effect. Injection of phenoxybenzamine or sotalol alone into the medial amygdaloid nucleus did not elicit any changes in muricide. These findings suggest that mechanisms mediated by brain noradrenergic alpha-receptor play an important role in muricide inhibition by tricyclic antidepressants in rats and that the medial amygdaloid nucleus is an important site of action of these drugs.", 
    "19": "A series of N-substituted exo- and endo-isomers of 2-amino-6,7-dihydroxybenzonorbornene, designed as rigid catecholamines, have been studied in the pithed rat in-vivo, as vasoconstrictor agents, and as inhibitors of the twitch response in the transmurally stimulated guinea-pig ileum. The exo-isomers examined were vasoconstrictor agonists in the pithed rat and inhibited the twitch response of the ileum. The corresponding endo-isomers were inactive in both preparations. The exo-isomers were less potent than the alpha 2-receptor agonist TL99, but were all directly acting vasoconstrictor agents, since they were still effective in reserpine-pretreated animals. Responses induced by members of the exo-series were selectively antagonized by the alpha 2-receptor antagonist rauwolscine, but were not antagonized by the alpha 1-receptor antagonist, prazosin, or the dopamine-receptor antagonist alpha-flupenthixol. The results demonstrate important conformational requirements for the interaction of catecholamines at presynaptic or postsynaptic alpha 2-receptors, and suggest that a fully extended or anti-conformation of the noradrenaline molecule is involved in alpha 2-receptor-agonist interaction.", 
    "20": "Calcium antagonistic drugs (also called slow channel or calcium channel inhibitors or calcium entry blockers) represent a major development in cardiovascular pharmacology. Their main site of action is at the slow channels where they inhibit Ca2+ influx into the cells. This characteristic distinguishes them from other drugs such as sodium nitroprusside, papaverine, hydralazine and diazoxide which interfere with the availability of calcium ions for their physiological functions by acting at sites other than the 'calcium channels'. There is considerable evidence, however, that calcium antagonistic drugs act at an intracellular site(s) as well as the 'calcium channels'. At present, verapamil, nifedipine and diltiazem are the most important representatives of this new class of drugs. Their chemical structures are quite different but their pharmacological characteristics are similar. The action of these drugs is primarily confined to the cardiovascular system. In the heart they depress cardiac contractions and heart rate and protect the ischaemic myocardium from calcium injury. Furthermore, verapamil and diltiazem (but not nifedipine) prolong AV conduction and refractoriness, which is important for their use as antiarrhythmic agents. All 3 drugs are powerful dilators of the coronary and peripheral arteries. These in vitro effects can be substantially altered by activation of baroreceptor reflexes in vivo, as is expected with vasodilators that cause little or no inhibition of noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerve endings. The combination of coronary dilatation with decreased oxygen demand of the myocardium and with decreased preload explains their value in the treatment of vasospastic and effort angina.", 
    "21": "The effect of a four-week treatment with propranolol and metoprolol on blood pressure and regional haemodynamics of the lower extremity at rest, after exercise and during reactive hyperaemia was studied in 34 patients with essential hypertension, but without peripheral arterial disease, in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. No significant difference in side-effects recorded during the trial was observed between these two drugs. Treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking drugs reduced systemic blood pressure. Calf blood flow during vasodilatation was also decreased. The most marked changes were observed during reactive hyperaemia; mean calf blood flow was reduced from about 250 ml/min/litre of tissue to 200 ml/min/litre of tissue (P less than 0.01) by propranolol and to 214 ml/min/litre of tissue (P less than 0.01) by metoprolol. Both drugs caused a significant increase in peripheral resistance above the initial level during reactive hyperaemia (P less than 0.05). No significant difference in peripheral resistance was observed, however, when the active drugs were compared with the placebo. There was no difference between propranolol and metoprolol in any of the parameters. Thus, the flow reduction can mainly be attributed to the diminished perfusion pressure due to the decreased cardiac output caused by beta-blockade of the heart.", 
    "22": "We have examined the effects of organic Ca++ channel blockade on calcium currents in Helix neurones, using a suction pipette technique which allows internal perfusion of the cell body and voltage clamp. In experiments on large cells with large currents, a microelectrode was used to measure membrane potential and provide the feedback potential for the voltage clamp. Calcium current was recorded after suppression of Na+ and K+ currents. The Ca++ conductance transports Ca++ and other divalent cations, such as Sr++, Ba++, Mn++, Zn++ and Cd++. Calcium current is temperature-dependent, and the Q10 of peak current was about 2.5. The organic Ca++ antagonists, verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine, inhibit calcium currents over the entire range of the current-voltage relationship. The effects are dose-dependent and there is no shifting in the current-voltage curves. Increases in extracellular Ca++ overcame the inhibitory action of the agents. Double reciprocal plots for peak calcium currents vs. external Ca++ concentrations in the presence or absence of diltiazem indicated competition with Ca++ at a common binding site. Intracellular application of diltiazem inhibited calcium currents.", 
    "23": "1--Responses (relaxation) to the beta-adrenoceptor agonists, isoprenaline, fenoterol or noradrenaline, were obtained on cat tracheal preparations contracted with a submaximal concentration of carbachol (0.5 microM). 2--The relative potencies of isoprenaline: fenoterol: noradrenaline were 100:8.1:10.7. From this, it was concluded that responses were mediated predominantly by beta 1-adrenoceptors but that a minor population of beta 2-adrenoceptors might also be involved. 3--Schild plots for the selective antagonists atenolol (beta 1-selective) or ICI 118,551 (beta 2-selective) were in different locations, i.e. were separated, depending on whether the antagonist was antagonizing noradrenaline or fenoterol. This supported the conclusion that beta 2- as well as beta 1-adrenoceptors were involved in mediating the response. In this respect, cat trachea resembles cat atria (rate responses). 4--In the presence of atenolol the concentration-response curves to fenoterol became biphasic. This was interpreted as indicating that the beta 2-adrenoceptors were too few in number to elicit a maximum tissue response. 5--Responses to isoprenaline of cat trachea were potentiated by the extraneuronal uptake inhibitor drugs, corticosterone and metanephrine. This indicated that extraneuronal uptake could modulate beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses (relaxation) of cat trachea. 6--Cat trachea resembles guinea-pig trachea in that (i) the beta-adrenoceptor population mediating relaxation is mixed (beta 1 + beta 2) and (ii) responses to isoprenaline are modulated by its extraneuronal uptake. However, cat trachea differs from guinea-pig trachea in that the predominant beta-adrenoceptor sub-type is beta 1 not beta 2.", 
    "24": "The literature on cimetidine drug interactions has been thoroughly reviewed. Several different mechanisms have been proposed for cimetidine-related drug interactions. These mechanisms include: (1) impaired hepatic drug metabolism due to inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, (2) reduced hepatic blood flow, resulting in decreased clearance of drugs that are highly extracted by the liver, (3) increased potential for myelosuppression when administered concurrently with other drugs capable of causing myelosuppression, and (4) altered bioavailability of acid-labile drugs. Cimetidine binds reversibly to the hepatic cytochrome P-450 and P-448 systems, resulting in decreased metabolism of drugs that undergo Phase I reactions (e.g., dealkylation and hydroxylation). In contrast, glucuronidation pathways are unaffected. The rapid onset and reversal of cimetidine's inhibition of hepatic metabolism indicates an effect on hepatic enzyme systems. Cimetidine also has been reported to decrease hepatic blood flow. Drugs that are highly extracted by the liver, such as propranolol, lidocaine, and morphine, may be postulated to have a decreased hepatic clearance. Cimetidine, through its effect on gastric pH, may increase the absorption of acid-labile drugs or may decrease the absorption of drugs. There have been reports of increased potential for myelosuppression when cimetidine is administered concurrently with drugs capable of causing bone marrow suppression. An understanding of the mechanisms involved in cimetidine drug interactions allows the clinician to prevent and predict these interactions.", 
    "25": "\"Early and aggressive\" drug therapy for mild hypertension, now widely prescribed in the United States, may be inappropriate for many of the 30 million patients with this condition. Although all of these patients are at greater risks of premature cardiovascular disease, the risks are manifested neither quickly nor uniformly. Drug therapy has not proved beneficial for patients with a diastolic (D) BP reading below 100 mm Hg, particularly those patients who are otherwise at low risk. Those antihypertensive drugs that are available now carry risks along with their benefits. Therefore, persons with mild hypertension who are at low risk should be encouraged to use nondrug therapies for at least six to 12 months. If their DBP remains below 100 mm Hg, they may be better off than if they were given drugs. The drug used in initial therapy has usually been a diuretic. For many patients, however, an adrenergic inhibitor may be a more appropriate choice.", 
    "26": "The voltage-dependent Na+ ionophore of various neuronal cells is permeable not only to Na+ ions but also to guanidinium ions. Therefore, the veratridine- (or aconitine-)stimulated influx of [14C]guanidinium in neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells was measured to characterize the Na+ ionophore of these cells. Half-maximal stimulation of guanidinium uptake was seen at 30 microM veratridine. At 1 mM guanidinium, the veratridine-stimulated uptake of guanidinium was lowered to 50% by approximately 60 mM Li+, Na+, or K+ and by a few millimolar Mn2+, Co2+, or Ni2+. The basal, as well as the veratridine-stimulated, uptake of guanidinium was inhibited by the cholinergic antagonists (+)-tubocurarine (Ki = 50 to 500 nM) and atropine (Ki = 5 to 30 microM) and the adrenergic antagonists phentolamine (Ki = 5 microM) and propranolol (Ki = 60 microM). The specificity of the inhibitory effects of these agents is stressed by the ineffectiveness of various other neurotransmitter antagonists. However, the corresponding ionophore in neuroblastoma cells (clone N1E-115) seems to be regulated differently. While phentolamine and propranolol inhibit the veratridine-activated uptake as in the hybrid cells, (+)-tubocurarine and atropine exert only a slight effect.", 
    "27": "Combinations of beta-adrenoceptor blockers and vasodilators have proved highly useful in antihypertensive therapy. Studies of the mechanisms of action of several agents that combine these effects within a single molecule are described in this report. Labetalol, SCH 19927, sulfinalol, MK-761, pindolol, and prizidilol, in contrast to propranolol, decreased blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). All except labetalol and SCH 19927 increased heart rate. In anesthetized dogs, all of these agents (except propranolol) produced vasodilatation on intra-arterial administration into the femoral vascular bed and, given i.v., lowered blood pressure after ganglionic blockade. In contrast to the other agents, labetalol and SCH 19927 caused only minimal increases in heart rate in ganglionically blocked dogs. The vasodilator and hypotensive actions as well as the antihypertensive effect in SHR of labetalol, SCH 19927, sulfinalol, and pindolol were inhibited by propranolol pretreatment but those of prizidilol were not, suggesting that the hypotensive and vascular effects of labetalol, SCH 19927, sulfinalol, pindolol, and MK-761 are mediated by activation of vascular beta-receptors. However, labetalol and SCH 19927 in particular differ from agents of this class as well as other beta blockers with strong intrinsic sympathomimetic actions in that their agonist activity is primarily directed at blood vessels and not the heart.", 
    "28": "The ability of l-norepinephrine to influence epileptiform activity was examined in an in vitro rat hippocampal slice preparation. Exogenously applied norepinephrine (NE) had anticonvulsant properties in that it slowed or stopped spontaneous interictal discharges which had been initiated by superfusion of slices with medium containing penicillin and elevated levels of potassium. This anticonvulsant property of NE was shared by the alpha receptor agonists 6-fluoro-norepinephrine, l-alpha-methyl-norepinephrine, and clonidine, but not by d-alpha-methyl-norepinephrine or l-phenylephrine. The beta receptor agonists 2-fluoro-norepinephrine and l-isoproterenol, on the other hand, were proconvulsant in that they increased interictal discharge rate. The alpha receptor antagonist phentolamine selectively blocked anticonvulsant responses, whereas the beta receptor antagonist timolol selectively blocked proconvulsant activity. These results suggest that activation of alpha or beta receptors has opposing inhibitory or excitatory effects respectively on epileptiform discharges in the rat hippocampus.", 
    "29": "Direct CNS effects of clonidine (0.2 mg) and propranolol (40 mg and 80 mg) were established in healthy young male subjects within three hours after oral administration. They were demonstrated in two studies using procedures of the Quantitative Pharmaco-EEG (QPEEG) method. Quantitatively, the greatest CNS effects were attained with 0.2 mg clonidine followed by 80 mg, and finally by 40 mg propranolol. Based on the computer-analyzed EEG (CEEG) profiles obtained and using the HZI Research Center CEEG data base, the psychotropic properties of these compounds were predicted. Propranolol, in the 40-mg dose, showed a similarity to vigilance-enhancing compounds, whereas the 80-mg dose and the 0.2-mg dose of clonidine were established as primarily similar to mood-elevating (sedative antidepressant) drugs. However, despite some overall similarities in the mode of action between the high dose of propranolol and the clonidine, some differences in their CNS effects were detected based on their secondary effects (anxiolytic and sedative effects, respectively).", 
    "30": "To determine the amount of sympathetic outflow suppression due to the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor stimulating agent clonidine, its effect on heart rate, blood pressure, and on circulating plasma catecholamines was assessed in ten healthy subjects at rest and during submaximal ergometric exercise. Similar exercise studies were performed in eight healthy normotensive persons after beta-blockade using propanolol. In nine healthy subjects the effect of an acute intravenous (IV) intervention of clonidine on plasma catecholamines was compared with the results obtained after IV administration of the cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol or of both drugs. Clonidine taken orally produced significantly reduced plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine (p less than 0.01). During submaximal ergometric exercise, the sympatholytic effect of clonidine was relatively less marked than at rest (p less than 0.05). After beta-blockade, either orally with propanolol or IV with metoprolol, plasma catecholamines at rest did not change significantly; their plasma levels during exercise, however, exceeded those obtained after administration of placebo (p less than 0.05). Giving IV clonidine and metoprolol combined revealed no significant changes of plasma catecholamines at rest and during exercise; heart rate and blood pressure decreased significantly (p less than 0.001). Clonidine on the one hand and the beta-blocking agents on the other exhibit oppositely directed effects on plasma levels of catecholamines.", 
    "31": "Isoproterenol, phenylephrine, and salbutamol (all 100 microM) induced the activity of tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT; EC 2.6.1.5) by 109%, 72%, and 141%, respectively, in organ culture of fetal human liver. Propranolol (100 microM) inhibited the effects of isoproterenol and phenylephrine. In organ culture of fetal rat liver, the induction of TAT activity by phenylephrine (100 microM) was not significantly affected by phentolamine (100 microM), whereas it was abolished by a combination of phentolamine and propranolol (both 100 microM). Isoproterenol and salbutamol caused significant increases in TAT activity, which were not affected by 100 microM atenolol but were completely inhibited by propranolol (100 microM). The results show that the fetal human liver has developed responsiveness to adrenergic stimuli at the 12th week of gestation. The adrenergic induction of TAT in fetal human liver is mediated solely by beta-adrenergic mechanisms. In the fetal rat liver, the adrenergic induction of TAT is mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "32": "A new procedure utilizing saccharose density gradient centrifugation was developed for the purification of beta-adrenergic receptor rich plasma membrane from rabbit heart ventricle tissue. The separation of the plasma membrane fraction from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria was verified by conducting binding studies, measuring the activities of marker enzymes, as well as by electron microscopy. It was found that the binding of [3H]-L-dihydroalprenolol is stereospecific in addition to being inhibited by beta-adrenoreceptor agonists and antagonists. Adenylate cyclase retained its responsiveness to beta-agonists and guanine nucleotides.", 
    "33": "It was previously observed that at the beginning of a 10 sec multiple arterial haemorrhage, vascular elasticity induces an increase of coronary vascular resistance, which in the late part of the haemorrhage is counteracted by the relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle fibres. In the present study the effect of multiple arterial haemorrhage on the coronary vascular resistance was studied after beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. The results suggest that also in these circumstances an elastic mechanism precedes a myogenic mechanism in the regulation of coronary vascular resistance.", 
    "34": "Penbutolol is a new, potent and long-acting non-cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker which has been evaluated in a 6-month open study of patients with moderate essential or renal hypertension. Eighty-two patients entered the study and 69 completed at least 3 months of treatment. Two-thirds of these showed a good response to penbutolol given alone as a single daily dose of either 40 mg or 80 mg. The major reduction in blood pressure occurred within the first 2 weeks of active therapy. This response was maintained for the entire study period. Blood pressure reduction after penbutolol did not correlate wtih the small reduction in heart rate observed. The remaining patients were treated with a combination of penbutolol and furosemide and most had achieved satisfactory control of their blood pressure by the end of the study. Penbutolol was well tolerated and produced no serious adverse effects. Some patients developed gastro-intestinal side-effects at the beginning of treatment which subsequently resolved. One patient with chronic glomerulonephritis showed a marked deterioration in renal function during the study. This may well have been related to disease progression. No other significant changes in biochemical or haematological parameters were observed.", 
    "35": "Infections of the deeper respiratory airways can contribute to the progression of chronic asthmatic bronchitis. In the present report a number of microorganisms affecting the number of beta-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig lung homogenates are described. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis and Escherichia coli O111B4 induced a significant decrease of the number of beta-adrenoceptors (by approximately 20%). Staphylococcus aureus, influenza A virus and Escherichia coli J5 were not active. These data point to a common factor shared by gram-negative bacilli; i.e. endotoxin. Purified endotoxin of E. coli O111B4 also decreased the number of beta-adrenoceptors, while E. coli J5-LPS did not. This suggests that neutral polysaccharides of bacterial cell walls, especially those in the 'O'-antigenic side chain of gram-negative endotoxins may be responsible for the decrease of beta-adrenoceptor number and therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic asthmatic bronchitis. Intact endotoxin seems to be necessary since neither the isolated lipid nor the polysaccharide part of E. coli O111B4 LPS affected the number of beta-adrenoceptors in the lung.", 
    "36": "The positive inotropic responses to orciprenaline of paced left atria and papillary muscles and the positive chronotropic responses of spontaneously beating right atria of guinea-pigs were recorded. Tissues from guinea-pigs pretreated with reserpine exhibited supersensitivity to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation as demonstrated by the significantly lower EC50 values to orciprenaline. The antagonism of these responses by Ro 03-7894 was characteristic of irreversible beta-adrenoceptor blockade--depression of maximum response and resistant to washout. The dissociation constants (KA) of orciprenaline were determined from the concentration-response curves obtained before and after Ro 03-7894, and no difference was found between tissues from untreated and reserpine-pretreated animals. KA values were also determined from the functional antagonism of the responses by carbachol. The degree of antagonism was less after reserpine pretreatment, but there was no increase in KA value. The reserpine-induced supersensitivity does not therefore appear to be due to an increase in agonist affinity for the cardiac beta-adrenoceptor.", 
    "37": "In an attempt to extend the hypothesis that activation of vascular postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors requires an influx of Ca2+ ions, the effects of 2 calcium entry blocking drugs verapamil and cinnarizine have been examined as inhibitors of the pressor responses to methoxamine and B-HT 920 in autoperfused dog hindlimb preparations. Verapamil (0.1-1 mg i.a.) selectively antagonized responses to B-HT 920 and had little or no effect upon responses to methoxamine, thus supporting this hypothesis. However cinnarizine, over the dose range studied (0.1-1 mg/kg i.a.) produced quantitatively similar inhibitions of the hindlimb responses to B-HT 920 and methoxamine. These results suggest that cinnarizine may have a different site of action to verapamil in resistance vessels of the dog hindlimb.", 
    "38": "Activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors stimulates the labeling of phosphatidylinositol in rat fat cells. The potency order of agonists was: epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than methoxamine; phenylephrine was a partial agonist for this effect. The action of norepinephrine was blocked by alpha-adrenergic antagonists in the following order of potency: prazosin greater than phentolamine greater than phenoxybenzamine greater than yohimbine. Trypsinization of fat cells nearly abolished the effect of norepinephrine indicating that alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation occurs at the outer surface of the plasma membrane.", 
    "39": "The process of discovery of 18 important adverse drug reactions was reviewed. For each adverse reaction the dates were noted of the report which first alerted the medical profession to the suspected reaction, the report which resulted in verification of causality beyond reasonable doubt, and the first regulatory action or warning to the medical profession in Britain by the Committee on the Safety of Medicines.", 
    "40": "The use of different methods of measuring contractility and the effects of cardiovascular reflexes are among the factors which complicate the assessment of selective inotropic activity of beta-adrenoceptor agonists. The effects of dobutamine, prenalterol, noradrenaline and isoprenaline on heart rate, iliac blood flow, left ventricular pressure, max dP/dt and (dP/dt) divided by IIT (integrated isometric tension) were evaluated in anaesthetised dogs in which the hearts were denervated and blood pressure held constant. All the drugs caused dose-dependent increases in heart rate and contractility. The relative chronotropic and inotropic activity of each agonist was evaluated. At most doses studied the agonists exerted similar chronotropic and inotropic activity when compared to the non-selective agonist isoprenaline. It is likely that the inotropic selectivity observed with prenalterol and dobutamine in previous studies depends on factors other than direct drug action.", 
    "41": "Ca2+-dependent K+ transport and plasma membrane NADH dehydrogenase activities have been studied in several 'high-K+' (human, rabbit and guinea pig) and 'low-K+' (dog, cat and sheep) erythrocytes. All the species except sheep showed Ca2+-dependent K+ transport. NADH-ferricyanide reductase was detected in all the species and showed positive correlation with the flavin contents of the membranes. NADH-cytochrome c reductase was very low or absent in dog, sheep and guinea pig membranes. No correlation was found between NADH dehydrogenase and Ca2+-dependent K+ channel activities in the species studied. Nor were any of the above activities correlated with (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity.", 
    "42": "The lipophilic cation [3H]triphenylmethylphosphonium, frequently used as a voltage sensor in membrane systems, binds reversibly to a site different from the acetylcholine binding site. This is concluded from the different pH dependences of the binding of these two ligands. Furthermore [3H]triphenylmethylphosphonium, previously identified as a channel blocker, can be covalently incorporated into acetylcholine receptor-rich membranes from Torpedo electric tissue by UV irradiation of the receptor-ligand complex. In the absence of effector, predominantly the alpha-polypeptide chains (Mr 40000) of the receptor protein are labeled by the radioactive ligand. The agonist carbamoylcholine strongly stimulates the labeling, but it directs the label predominantly to the delta- and beta-polypeptide chains. The antagonist D-tubocurarine and the virtually irreversible competitive antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin have qualitatively the same effect as the agonist carbamoylcholine. Significant differences were obtained with receptor-rich membranes prepared from Torpedo marmorata and Torpedo californica: No agonist- or antagonist-stimulated reaction was observed with the latter. The results are interpreted as an indication of a rearrangement of the receptor's quaternary structure caused by cholinergic effector binding preceding discrimination between agonists and antagonists.", 
    "43": "Fourteen 23 week old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were randomly divided into saline control or phospholipid (I-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) treatment groups. Four weeks of baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) measurements were determined via tail plethysmography. On week 25 of the baseline period a 1.5 ml blood sample was taken by tail clip for analysis of norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), and plasma renin activity (PRA). On the following week, a single injection of phospholipid (11 ug/kg, s.c.) was given to the experimental animals following baseline SBP and HR determinations. A similar procedure was employed for control subjects, except they received an injection of normal saline (0.5 ml, s.c.). Systolic BP and HR responses were monitored for 24 minutes following the injection. A 1.5 ml blood sample was taken at the end of the 4th minute for NE, E, and PRA assays. A significant drop in SBP (202 +/- 5 mmHg to 124 +/- 6 mmHg) and an increase in HR (431 +/- 17 bpm to 519 +/- 21 bpm) were observed for experimental animals, but not for control subjects. Plasma NE increased significantly (446 +/- 42 pg/ml to 1099 +/- 77 pg/ml), but E remained unchanged following treatment with the phospholipid. Plasma renin activity increased for both groups, but this change was only significant for the experimental group (18.1 +/- 5.7 ng Al/ml/hr to 34.3 +/- 3.6 ng Al/ml/hr). Thus, it appears that I-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine is a potent antihypertensive vasodilating agent which stimulates baroreceptor mediated sympathetic discharge to the heart and kidneys of the SHR.", 
    "44": "Labetalol (Trandate; Allen & Hanbury) was administered to 17 hypertensive patients with angina pectoris, which had persisted despite blood pressure control on treatment including beta-blocking agents. In comparison with placebo, labetalol significantly reduced the frequency and severity of attacks of angina pectoris, without further improvement in control of blood pressure at rest, during isotonic exercise or on performance of the cold pressor test. Labetalol significantly reduced blood pressure levels during isometric exercise but did not reduce the systolic pressure- heart rate product. Labetalol improved the angina without evidence of causing a reduction of cardiac work (and presumably oxygen consumption by the myocardium) in comparison with the other antihypertensive agents used in this study. A possible mechanism whereby labetalol increases myocardial blood supply in hypertensive patients with angina pectoris is by an increase in coronary perfusion due to its vasodilator action.", 
    "45": "dl-Propranolol (propranolol) fed to immature and mature aneurysm-prone turkeys (Broad-Breasted White, BBW) for 6 weeks significantly raised the tensile strength of tissue rings from the abdominal aorta. The drug-mediated increase in tensile strength values was dose-related and independent of its heart rate- and arterial pressure-lowering effects. Propranolol acts, in part, by (a) stimulating lysyl oxidase to produce greater amounts of reactive aldehydes for intermolecular cross-links, (b) enhancing the progression of chemically unstable to stable forms of intermolecular elastin cross-links (lysinonorleucine and the desmosines), and (c) reducing the density of the age-related intermolecular cross-linking of collagen (pyridinoline). These propranolol effects on the lysyl cross-links were demonstrated in both the immature and mature animals and suggest a heretofore unrecognized potential for this widely used cardiovascular drug.", 
    "46": "A method for the determination of metoprolol at concentrations down to 10 ng/ml in human plasma is described. After addition of oxprenolol as internal standard, both compounds are extracted into diethyl ether--dichloromethane (4:1, v/v) at basic pH, transferred into an acidic aqueous solution and back-extracted at basic pH into diethyl ether--dichloromethane. They are then derivatized with heptafluorobutyric anhydride. The derivatives are quantitatively determined by gas chromatography using a 63Ni electron-capture detector. The linearity was demonstrated, and the technique was formally validated in the concentration range 10-500 ng/ml. The technique was applied in a study of the bioavailability of metoprolol after oral administration to man; mean plasma concentrations are reported.", 
    "47": "Autonomic innervation of the atrioventricular (AV) junction modulates conduction of the cardiac impulse, the sympathetic nerves facilitating and parasympathetic nerves impeding conduction. Experiments assessed the relative importance of parasympathetic vs. sympathetic control by pharmacologic blockade with atropine (0.2 mg/kg) or propranolol (1.0 mg/kg) while pacing the right atrium (100-400 beats/min) in normal, conscious resting dogs and in dogs that had undergone chronic, intrapericardial cardiac denervation. Maximum pacing rate with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction was termed Rmax. Control Rmax at rest was 125.69 +/- 9.49 beats/min and was slightly reduced after propranolol to 118.28 +/- 10.98 (P = 0.043). After atropine, Rmax was significantly increased to 344 beats/min. Propranolol and atropine together resulted in an Rmax of 308 beats/min, which was significantly less than after atropine alone. Rmax in cardiac-denervated dogs was 301 beats/min, which was not significantly different from that following total pharmacologic blockade. In conscious, resting, unsedated dogs, the upper limit of AV nodal conduction is associated with the level of parasympathetic rather than sympathetic tone; during exercise the sympathetics assume greater importance.", 
    "48": "The identification of ligand-binding proteins in serum is important for understanding many metabolic pathways and for interpreting clinical measurements. Most techniques presently available lack the facility to identify specific binding proteins. This problem has been overcome by combining the specificity of immunological methods with the sensitivity of radioisotope detection. The methods comprise an adaptation of 2-dimensional immuno-electrophoresis, and radial immunodiffusion, combined with radiolabelled ligands and autoradiography. They have been used to determine the serum binding of calcium, cadmium, thyroxine and the beta blocking drug propranolol. This technique has wide application to other ligand-binding interactions.", 
    "49": "A study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of indapamide in the treatment of 20 patients with mild hypertension and to determine whether a favourable response to treatment was related to initial hyperadrenergic status, to changes in serum catecholamine levels or modified by orthostatic stress. After 4 weeks on placebo, patients received 2.5 mg indapamide per day for 4 weeks and, if diastolic pressure was controlled below 100 mmHg, this regimen was continued for a further 8 weeks. Those not adequately controlled with indapamide alone were treated additionally with nadolol (mean dose 140 mg per day) for a period of 12 weeks. The results showed that indapamide alone produced a significant reduction in blood pressure both in the recumbent and upright position in 12 (60%) of the patients and that addition of the beta-blocker augmented the antihypertensive effect. No relationship was demonstrated between initial high serum catecholamine levels and a favourable response to indapamide. Recumbent serum norepinephrine levels after indapamide alone or with nadolol for 4 to 8 weeks remained comparable with placebo levels. However; the amplitude of the norepinephrine increase due to orthostatic stress was significantly reduced after 8 weeks of indapamide treatment. Possible explanations for this are discussed.", 
    "50": "The long term efficacy and tolerability of nifedipine combined with propranolol was assessed in a group of hypertensive patients inadequately controlled on propranolol alone. Twenty-six subjects were initially treated with propranolol in a constant daily dose of 160-240 mg, for up to 4 weeks. Nifedipine, 30 mg/day, was added and the dose was titrated upwards to 90 mg/day to achieve normal blood pressure. In 22 patients receiving the combined therapy for 14-30 weeks, mean arterial pressure dropped from 138 +/- 3 mmHg to 102 +/- 2 mmHg. Thirteen patients experienced untoward effects, and 4 discontinued the study. In the remaining 9, side effects were mild and well tolerated. Seventeen patients were subsequently treated sequentially with propranolol alone, combined therapy and nifedipine alone, to assess the efficacy of each regimen and the additive effect of each drug. The combined regimen was found to be more effective than either drug alone. A subgroup continued either combined therapy (14) or nifedipine monotherapy (3) and was followed for up to 9 months. Blood pressure control was maintained in the majority, but 4 more patients dropped out because of side effects. We conclude that the long term use of nifedipine combined with propranolol is effective and relatively well tolerated, and may offer an alternative approach to the treatment of moderately severe hypertension.", 
    "51": "The effect of propranolol and carbachol injected directly into nucleus raphe dorsalis (RD) on the evoked potentials, their recovery cycles and on the spontaneous EEG activity recorded in the RD and the visual and somatosensory cortical regions was investigated. It was found that the changes in these electrophysiological parameters induced by propranolol and carbachol were similar and showed an increase in the excitability level in both the RD and the neocortex, mainly in the somatosensory cortex. The activating effect of carbachol was much more pronounced as compared with that of propranolol. The results are discussed in relation to the possible interactions between various neurotransmitter systems within the RD as well as to the data about the presumed role of this nucleus in some behavioral and/or electrophysiological manifestations. The findings suggest that raphe dorsalis participates in the regulation of the cortical excitability and apparently represents a system which modulates the transMission and integration of sensory information.", 
    "52": "The pharmacokinetics of acebutolol and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) alone or in combination were studied in 12 healthy subjects in a cross over study. Acebutolol and diacetolol (the main metabolite) in plasma and urine were determined by HPLC and hydrochlorothiazide by GLC. The main pharmacokinetic parameters of acebutolol did not differ significantly: AUC 4492 +/- 272 micrograms l-1h given alone versus 4118 +/- 354 micrograms l-1h with HCT, half-life (7,69 +/- 0,32 h vs 8,10 +/- 0,72 h) and renal clearance (13,1 +/- 0,5 lh-1 vs 13,8 +/- 0,9 lh-1), respectively. There was no difference in diacetolol pharmacokinetics. HCT values were not significantly different: AUC 784 +/- 48 micrograms l-1h given alone and 720 +/- 42 micrograms l-1h with acebutolol, t 1/2 (4,79 +/- 0,37 h vs 4,73 +/- 0,43 h). The renal clearance was slightly higher when HCT was given with acebutolol (26,2 +/- 2,6 vs 20,3 +/- 2,1 lh-1, p less than 0,05). This increase, observed during the first four hours, was probably due to competition between the drugs for binding to red blood cells.", 
    "53": "Propranolol (P) and all of its major known metabolites were found in maternal plasma, cord plasma and neonatal plasma in 10 women at term, irrespective of the P doses administered and the time elapsed (up to 15 h) between administration of the last P dose and delivery. The ratios of cord plasma to simultaneous maternal plasma levels for propranolol and its major metabolites (mean +/- SD) were: propranolol 0.32 +/- 0.17, propranolol glucuronide 0.86 +/- 0.36, 4-hydroxypropranolol 1.4 +/- 1.0, 4-hydroxypropranolol glucuronide 0.71 +/- 0.45 and naphthoxylactic acid 3.0 +/- 1.6. P binding in cord plasma at delivery was 67.2 +/- 3.9% (mean +/- SD) which was significantly less ('t' = 13.4, df = 13, p less than 0.001) than the P binding in maternal plasma at delivery (87.5 +/- 1.6%, mean +/- SD). The plasma protein binding (mean +/- SD) of naphthoxylactic acid in cord plasma (98.6 +/- 0.2%) was significantly greater ('t' = 3.808, df = 4, p less than 0.02) than the naphthoxylactic acid binding in maternal plasma at delivery (97.6 +/- 0.4%). When the simultaneous concentrations of P and naphthoxylactic acid in maternal and cord plasma are compared in conjunction with protein binding and ionic effects, it would seem that metabolism of P does occur in the placental/foetal unit.", 
    "54": "The influence of propranolol on blood flow in peripheral tissues was studied in 10 normotensive subjects. Adequacy of beta-blockade was ascertained by an ergometric test. Perfusion of the subcutaneous tissue and skeletal muscle was measured by the local 133Xe-washout technique. The arteriolar dilatation underlying the autoregulatory response to a decrease in arterial perfusion pressurehead was not affected by beta-blockade. Propranolol did not change the magnitude of arteriolar constriction elicited by the local sympathetic veno-arteriolar reflex. Thus, the locally induced increase in the discharge rate along the peripheral sympathetic adrenergic fibres did not lead to measurable change in beta-receptor activity. The present results indicate that local bloodflow regulatory mechanisms are not affected by propranolol. They also indicate that the direct peripheral effects of propranolol are of no clinical importance in normotensive subjects in the supine position, when the general activity in the sympathetic nervous system is low.", 
    "55": "Continuous intra-arterial blood pressure recording using the \"Oxford\" technique has been used to study the antihypertensive effects of oxprenolol taken three times daily in fully ambulatory patients with essential hypertension, outside hospital. During the first 24 h of treatment there was a reduction in daytime heart rate and a small reduction in daytime blood pressure. After 10 weeks treatment there was a more substantial fall in daytime blood pressure from the hour of waking, but no effect on sleeping nighttime blood pressure or heart rate. Twenty-four hour variation, as assessed by the amplitude of a fitted regression curve, showed a reduction in heart rate but not blood pressure variation. In 4 patients restudied after 11 weeks treatment with oxprenolol (tid) and cyclopenthiazide at 9 a.m. there was some evidence of an antihypertensive effect occurring during both the daytime and nighttime.", 
    "56": "We studied the changes in systemic and regional hemodynamics (using the radioactive microsphere technique) and catecholamine levels produced by propranolol in conscious semi-restrained intact or nephrectomized rats. Blood pressure increased by 17 +/- 2 and 32 +/- 2 mmHg in intact and anephric rats respectively, total peripheral vascular resistance by 61.5% and 176.5%, heart rate decreased by 23% and 35% respectively, cardiac index decreased by 35% and 57%, and stroke volume index by 14% and 30%. All changes were significantly more pronounced in anephric rats (p less than 0.05). Baseline norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine were significantly higher in anephric versus intact animals and did not change significantly after B-blockade except for norepinephrine of the anephric rats which decreased. After B-blockade regional blood flows in most organs (including coronary flow) decreased in proportion to the diminished cardiac index except for brain flow which decreased by only 12% in intact and 25% in anephric animals. Local vascular resistances increased concomitantly and these changes were far more pronounced in the absence of kidneys. Thus, anephric state exacerbates all systemic and regional hemodynamic alterations caused by B-blockade in the rat.", 
    "57": "The effects of timolol (2.5 mg i.v.) on coronary haemodynamics and myocardial metabolism were studied in 26 patients with angina pectoris. Cardiac venous flow (CVF) was measured by thermodilution technique. Blood was sampled for metabolic studies. Angina pectoris was induced by atrial pacing and the same heart rate was regained after timolol. Metabolic ischaemia was defined as reduction in myocardial lactate extraction ratio (MLE) by at least 50% and to a ratio below 0.15. The study was completed in 22 patients, 9 of whom fulfilled the metabolic criteria for ischaemia. This subgroup did not differ from the total group in any other respect than in lactate metabolism. Beta-adrenergic blockade reduced myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) and CVF significantly at rest, but MVO2, CVF, myocardial glucose uptake and MLE were unchanged during pacing despite a decrease in systolic aortic pressure, ejection time and reduced myocardial free fatty acid uptake. Conclusively, timolol did not reduce MVO2 and metabolic ischaemia during pacing-induced angina.", 
    "58": "Ten young healthy volunteers were given placebo, propranolol (20 or 40 mg), nicergoline, an alpha blocking agent (30 mg) or the association of nicergoline (15 mg) and propranolol (20 mg) in a randomized double blind study. The results show that nicergoline potentiates the cardiodepressant action of propranolol, whereby the effects of 20 mg become the same as those of 40 mg given alone on cardiac output and myocardial oxygen demand, though the plasma propranolol levels are not changed. We, therefore, propose that nicergoline blocks alpha 1 agonist effects of propranolol, which are usually masked by the greater beta 1 blocking effects but could have clinical and therapeutic relevance.", 
    "59": "To evaluate the hypotensive efficacy of labetalol (600 mg/day) six mild to moderate hypertensive patients were studied by the indirect continuous blood pressure monitoring with the Del Mar Avionics Pressurometer 111 degrees. This technique gives a much larger number of blood pressure values in a greater variety of conditions than the conventional Riva-Rocci sphygmomanometer. After one month of continuous therapy there was a substantial reduction in systolic and diastolic pressure. The increased index of Kurtosis revealed a decreased blood pressure variability. The circadian changes of blood pressure were not significantly affected, but the morning peak was smoothed by labetalol.", 
    "60": "A potential pharmacokinetic interaction between the beta-blocking drug, metoprolol, and the diuretic, chlorthalidone, has been investigated in three single or multiple dose studies in healthy volunteers. The pharmacokinetic profile of metoprolol 100 mg was not affected by pretreatment with or co-administration of chlorthalidone 25 mg twice daily. Similarly, the pre-dosing steady-state level of chlorthalidone during chronic treatment and its blood level profile after a single 25 mg dose were not affected by metoprolol. The bioavailabilities of the 2 drugs administered in combination were identical to those observed when each drug was administered alone. These studies demonstrate that there is no pharmacokinetic interaction between metoprolol and chlorthalidone when doses of 100 and 25 mg, respectively, are co-administered twice daily.", 
    "61": "Several beta-blockers increase VLDL-TG and decrease HDL-cholesterol concentrations. The underlying mechanism is not yet clear. Some studies have suggested that the effect is less pronounced during treatment with selective beta-blockers. The effects of 2 such drugs, metoprolol 200 mg/day and atenolol 50 mg/day, have been compared in 50 hypertensive patients (WHO Stage I-II), mean age 47 years. Serum lipoproteins were determined in 20 patients before treatment and after treatment with either drug for 3 months. Both drugs were equally effective in reducing blood pressure. After atenolol the initial VLDL-cholesterol concentration of 1.04 mmol/l had not changed, but it rose to 1.29 mmol/l after metoprolol (p less than 0.05). The HDL-cholesterol concentration 1.42 mmol/l did not fall during atenolol treatment, but during metoprolol there was a small reduction to 1.31 mmol/l (p less than 0.05). Hyperlipoproteinaemia is common in hypertensive patients, 40% of the present group had hypertriglyceridaemia and 25% had hypercholesterolaemia. Thus, atenolol 50 mg was found not to affect lipoproteins, whereas metoprolol 200 mg increased the VLDL concentration in 75% of the patients.", 
    "62": "We compared propranolol with methyldopa in a randomized prospective study of 28 women with pregnancy associated hypertension. Both drugs were equally effective in controlling maternal hypertension. There was no significant difference in the birthweights of the babies in each group. However one infant born to a mother receiving propranolol had symptomatic hypoglycaemia. The mean peak levels of propranolol, propranolol glucuronide, 4-hydroxypropranolol, and 4-hydroxypropranolol glucuronide were not significantly different in the first, second, third trimesters and at least 3 months post partum. The mean peak plasma level of naphthoxylactic acid however was significantly less in the third trimester compared with post partum levels. Propranolol and its metabolites were found to cross into breast milk with the maximum dose likely to be ingested by the infant as either propranolol or propranolol glucuronide being 7 micrograms of propranolol per 100 g of breast milk, being approximately 0.1% of the maternal dose.", 
    "63": "The aim of the present study on pregnant renal hypertensive rats was to investigate the effects on central hemodynamics and uteroplacental blood flow after chronic administration of pindolol, a nonspecific beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent with intrinsic beta-stimulatory effect. Renal hypertension was induced by partial clamping of both renal arteries four weeks before pregnancy. Pindolol was administered with the food during the entire pregnancy period. Two to four days before expected delivery mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, (dye-dilution technique) and utero-placental blood supply (microsphere technique) were determined. The chronic pindolol treatment reduced heart rate by 25 per cent while both mean arterial pressure and cardiac output remained unchanged. However, blood flow to uterus and placentae was reduced by 43 and 64 per cent, respectively, after pindolol treatment. Clinical as well as experimental studies (15, 16) demonstrate a reduced utero-placental blood supply when pregnancies are complicated by hypertension. As pregnancies with severe hypertension are associated with an increased frequency of intrauterine growth retardation and intrauterine asphyxia the present results indicate that the combination of hypertension and long-term treatment with beta-blockers might reduce utero-placental blood flow enough as to seriously interfere with fetal oxygen supply thereby increasing the risk of intra- and extra-uterine asphyxia.", 
    "64": "Sotalol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, was administered to 6 healthy pregnant volunteers between 32-36 weeks gestation and when at least 6 weeks post-partum. On both occasions, each volunteer was given sotalol 100 mg intravenously and 400 mg orally in randomised order with at least a 1 week washout period between. Plasma samples were analysed for sotalol using a fluorometric method and the pharmacokinetic profiles investigated. The systemic clearance of sotalol was significantly greater in the antenatal period (2.4 +/- 0.3 ml/min/kg) than in the post-natal phase (1.5 +/- 0.1 ml/min/kg). The apparent volume of distribution was similar in the two periods: the elimination half-life was 6.6 +/- 0.6 h ante-natally and 9.3 +/- 0.7 h post-natally after intravenous drug but the trend for faster elimination was not significant. The elimination half-life after oral administration (about 10 h) and bioavailability (about 90%) were not altered significantly by pregnancy. It is suggested that the more rapid clearance of sotalol in pregnancy may be due to increases in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate.", 
    "65": "Nineteen out-patients with moderate to severe essential hypertension were treated daily for 3 years, with an average dose of 13 mg endralazine, a new peripheral vasodilator, in free combination with pindolol 3 x 5 mg. The blood pressure showed a statistically significant reduction from 172/110 mmHg to 154/92 mmHg after treatment for 3 years. Tachyphylaxis was not observed during the 3 years period. Oedema was the most frequent side-effect, but it disappeared spontaneously. No difference in efficacy and tolerance between slow and fast acetylators was found. Only 2 patients developed a weak positive antinuclear antibody titre, which disappeared spontaneously from one during continued treatment. No clinical evidence of a systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome was noted. It is concluded that the differences between endralazine and hydralazine in dosage and metabolism may explain the lower immunogenic activity of endralazine."
