As ischaemia in exercise-induced angina is preceded by increase in heart rate, calcium channel blockers with negative chronotropic properties may perform better for this purpose than nonchronotropic compounds.", 
    "1": "A 335 patient double-blind parallel-group study comparing 14 day treatment with amlodipine 5 and 10 mg, with diltiazem 200 and 300 mg, and mibefradil 50 and 100 mg added to baseline beta-adrenoceptor blocker treatment was performed. Exercise testing (ETT) was performed by bicycle ergometry.", 
    "2": "Although none of the calcium channel blockers improved duration of exercise or amount of workload, all significantly delayed onset of 1 mm ST-segment depression on ETT (P<0.001 for any treatment vs baseline). In addition, mibefradil, both low and high dose treatment, produced the longest delays (low dose: different from diltiazem and amlodipine by 24.1 and 29.8 s, respectively, P<0. 003 and <0.001; high dose: different from diltiazem and amlodipine by 33.7 and 37.0 s, respectively, P<0.001 and <0.001). These effects were linearly correlated with the reduction in rate pressure product (RPP). Serious symptoms of dizziness occurred significantly more frequently on mibefradil (P<0.05), and 19 patients on mibefradil withdrew from trial.", 
    "3": "Calcium channel blockers with negative chronotropic properties provide greater delay of ischaemia in patients with exercise-induced angina, but the concomitant risk of intolerable dizziness attenuates this benefit.", 
    "4": "The oxygen limitation theory states that capillarization of the sinusoidal endothelium in cirrhosis impairs hepatocellular oxygen uptake manifesting as a reduction in oxygen-dependent enzyme activity including phase 1 drug metabolism. The hepatic artery supplies highly oxygenated blood to the liver. Therefore, we tested whether augmentation of hepatic arterial blood flow could improve hepatic oxygenation and function in cirrhosis. Rats were treated with carbon tetrachloride and phenobarbitone to induce hepatic cirrhosis or fibrosis. We used a bivascular rat liver perfusion model to examine the effects of increased hepatic artery flow on propranolol clearance and oxygen consumption. Each liver was perfused at three hepatic artery flow rates, 1 to 3, 4 to 6, and 7 to 9 ml/min with a constant portal venous flow of 7 to 9 ml/min. Increasing the hepatic artery flow led to improvement in propranolol clearance in control (n = 7, P <.001), fibrotic (n = 8, P <.001), and cirrhotic (n = 6, P <.001) livers. Intrinsic clearance of propranolol increased only in the cirrhotic livers (P =.01), indicating an improvement in enzyme activity. Regression analysis indicated that this improvement was mediated by change in oxygen delivery alone (P =.001). The results confirm that propranolol metabolizing enzyme activity in cirrhosis can be improved by increasing oxygen delivery by increasing hepatic arterial blood flow. These findings suggest that increasing hepatic arterial blood flow may be an important therapeutic strategy for improving global liver function in cirrhosis.", 
    "5": "Open-field behavior was compared between untreated, saline-treated, and butoxamine (a beta-2-adrenoceptor antagonist) treated (15 and 5 mg/kg body weight) male golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Butoxamine-treated males spent significantly more time self-grooming than saline-treated and untreated males. Especially, untreated males and very similar saline control males showed a clear time sequential structure of behavior with two axes: a grooming-grooming sequence and a highly organized flankmark followed by scrape axis. The degree of this organization was markedly decreased in the butoxamine-treated males, showing an increase in organization of the transition between grooming acts. In general, these males displayed a more stereotypic pattern of behavior than the other. To reveal a systematic relation between the flankmark-scrape response and the exposition to butoxamine and to keep the numbers of experimental animals low, mixed samples were created through consecutive summing of the individual transition matrices of six males treated with 5 mg/kg b.wt. butoxamine to the 15 mg/kg b.wt. sample. By analyzing all samples separately, a positive linear relation between the number of low dosed males in the samples and the degree of organization of the flankmark-scrape sequence was found. The results suggest that the analysis of the transitional structure of behavior during short-term challenges can considerably contribute to an estimation of the coping style and seems to be a more sensitive method than comparing frequencies of behavioral indicators of stress.", 
    "6": "This paper describes a rapid and systematic method of using open trials to identify medications that may be useful for the treatment of cocaine dependence. Results of these open trials can be used to prioritize medications for inclusion in subsequent double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Preliminary results are presented from the evaluation of propranolol, nefazodone, and the combination of phentermine and fenfluramine (phen/fen). Each medication was evaluated in an open trial, and results were compared to results obtained from a group that received a multivitamin. Outcome measures included treatment retention, urine toxicology screens, self-reported cocaine use, and changes on the Addiction Severity Index (ASI). Treatment retention was significantly better in the propranolol group than in the multivitamin group. Concurrent alcohol abuse was associated with increased rates of attrition in the multivitamin group, and the phen/fen group, but not in the propranolol group. Neither the nefazodone nor the phen/fen groups showed any outcome advantages over the multivitamin group. We conclude that propranolol may enhance retention among cocaine-dependent patients, especially among those who also abuse alcohol. These results encourage a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of propranolol.",

Three hours after this, venous blood and various organs were removed and their activities were related to the administered activity. A kinetic study of the whole-body activity retention after administration of terbutaline was also made.", 
    "9": "The biodistribution of 99mTc-HDP was similar after the administration of sympathomimetics and of beta-antagonists. All drugs gave rise to an increased soft tissue activity and a decreased bone activity, corresponding to a lowered quality of the potential bone scan. Terbutaline gave rise to an increased excretion of 99mTc-HDP. The mechanisms behind the findings cannot be entirely explained.",

    "11": "Melatonin is a mediator in the establishment of the circadian rhythm of biological processes. It is produced in the pineal gland mainly during the night by stimulation of adrenergic beta1- and alpha1-receptors. Sleep disturbances are common side-effects of beta-blockers. The influence of specific beta-blockade as well as that of combined alpha-and beta-blockade on melatonin production has not been investigated in humans before.", 
    "12": "We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 15 healthy volunteers. Subjects received single oral doses of 40 mg (R)-propranolol, 40 mg (S)-propranolol, 50 mg (R)-atenolol, 50 mg (S)-atenolol, 25 mg (R,S)-carvedilol, 120 mg (R,S)-verapamil or placebo at 1800 hours. Urine was collected between 2200 hours and 0600 hours, and 6-sulfatoxy-melatonin (aMT6s), the main metabolite of melatonin which is almost completely eliminated in urine, was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA).", 
    "13": "Mean nocturnal excretion of aMT6s in urine after intake of the drugs was as follows (in microg): placebo 26; (R)-propranolol 24 (-7%, NS); (S)-propranolol 5 (-80%, P < 0.001); (R)-atenolol 27 (+7%, NS); (S)-atenolol 4 (-86%, P < 0.01); (R,S)-carvedilol 23 (-10%, NS); (R,S)-verapamil 29 (+14%, NS). These data show that only the specifically beta-blocking (S)-enantiomers of propranolol and atenolol decrease the nocturnal production of melatonin whereas the non-beta-blocking (R)-enantiomers have no effect. Unexpectedly, (R,S)-carvedilol which inhibits both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors does not decrease melatonin production.", 
    "14": "These findings indicate that beta-blockers decrease melatonin release via specific inhibition of adrenergic beta1-receptors. Since lower nocturnal melatonin levels might be the reason for sleep disturbances, further clinical studies should investigate whether or not oral administration of melatonin might avoid this well-known side-effect of beta-blockers. The reason why (R,S)-carvedilol does not influence melatonin production remains to be determined.",

    "16": "Prescription patterns among 355 patients discharged from a public teaching hospital after recovery from myocardial infarction were prospectively monitored in a before-after trial. The implementation strategies included educational interventions (large group meetings), placement of guidelines in patients' records, and bimonthly general reminders sent to physicians.", 
    "17": "Beta blockers were prescribed in 93 (38%) of 243 survivors of acute myocardial infarction before guideline implementation (12-month control period), as compared with 71 (63%) of 112 patients (P <0.001) after their implementation (6-month period). During the entire study period, the prescription of beta blockers at a neighboring public teaching hospital, used as a comparison, was unchanged. After adjusting for potential confounders, implementation of the guidelines remained significantly associated with prescription of beta blockers at discharge [odds ratio (OR) = 10; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.2 to 33; P <0.001]. Other independent predictors of prescription of beta blockers were previous coronary artery bypass grafting (OR = 8.7; 95% CI, 2.5 to 31; P = 0.001), hypertension (OR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4 to 4.5; P = 0.003), age per 10-year increase (OR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.99; P = 0.04), secular trend in prescription patterns expressed in months (OR = 0.9; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.0; P = 0.02), a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40% (OR = 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.4; P <0.001), the presence of atrioventricular block (OR = 0.1; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.7; P = 0.02), and concomitant prescription of digoxin (OR = 0.2; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.8; P = 0.02) or calcium antagonists (OR = 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.3; P = 0.001).",

A number of pharmacologic interventions, including the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A, beta-blockers, benzodiazepines, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. The choice of initial treatment depends on a variety of factors including comorbidity, prior treatment history, patient preference, and adverse effect profile. This article will examine the effectiveness of various pharmacologic agents for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, discuss considerations for long-term management, and review strategies for optimizing treatment in patients who are partially responsive or unresponsive to initial therapy.", 
    "20": "Social anxiety disorder is associated with significant impairment in social and occupational functioning. Gender differences in social anxiety disorder are apparent for treatment seeking and symptom clusters, and hormonal influences may affect the natural course of illness. The lifetime prevalence rate is 13.3%, with rates of 15.5% in women and 11.1% in men. Although most studies indicate that more women suffer from social anxiety disorder, it appears that men are more likely to seek treatment. Gender differences in the presentation and management of social anxiety disorder may be influenced by fluctuations in levels of endogenous or exogenous reproductive hormones. Neurotransmitter systems implicated in the etiology of mood and anxiety disorders may be affected by both estrogen and progesterone. There are also issues with regard to pregnancy in women who have social anxiety disorder. It is not known if untreated social anxiety disorder represents a significant risk to the fetus. However, social anxiety disorder often is complicated by comorbid depression, panic disorder, or substance abuse, all of which may pose risks to the fetus if left untreated. Treatment strategies for patients with social anxiety disorder should consider gender differences in response to pharmacotherapy, psychiatric comorbidity, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy status, and the specific nature of symptoms in the individual patient.", 
    "21": "Behavioral and psychological signs and symptoms associated with dementia are common and often confusing because they do not meet criteria for typical discrete psychiatric disorders. Although the symptoms tend to occur in clusters, the clusters often vary with time and between patients. Recognizing the behavioral pathology associated with dementia is important because it can be distressing to the patient, lead to dangerous interactions with others or the environment, and result in the use of inappropriate psychotropic medications. A practical, general approach to the evaluation and management of agitation in dementia for psychiatric consultants confronted with such problems is proposed.", 
    "22": "Treatment of high blood pressure can be challenging. Most patients have no symptoms and are unlikely to appreciate the value of antihypertensive medications. Unless acute target organ involvement is already present, there are no compelling reasons to lower blood pressure quickly. Instead, beginning with relatively low doses of medications and slowly bringing the blood pressure to goal helps avoid troublesome medication side effects. This is especially important in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension who are susceptible to orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and confusion, despite little change in blood pressure. Use of long-acting agents and combination medications may improve compliance with the medical regimen.",

The alpha-blocker phentolamine was given to 16 patients before exercise, five of whom had also taken a beta-adrenergic-blocker the same morning. Ten patients served as controls. The cross-sectional areas of a normal and a stenotic coronary vessel were determined by biplane quantitative coronary arteriography.", 
    "27": "In the normal vessel segments, coronary cross-sectional area did not change after phentolamine injection, but increased in all patient groups similarly during exercise. Although coronary vasoconstriction existed in stenotic vessel segments in control patients, phentolamine-treated patients showed exercise-induced vasodilation without difference in patients with and without chronic beta-blockade.", 
    "28": "Exercise-induced vasoconstriction of stenotic coronary arteries is prevented by intracoronary administration of phentolamine. There was no difference in coronary vasomotion between patients receiving phentolamine alone and patients receiving phentolamine in addition to a beta-blocker. This finding suggests that exercise-induced vasoconstriction is mediated not only by endothelial dysfunction but also by alpha-adrenergic mechanisms.",

The costs include the costs of appropriate shoes, garments and equipment, but these were not specifically measured.", 
    "35": "(1) People with mild hypertension should engage in 50-60 minutes of moderate rhythmic exercise of the lower limbs, such as brisk walking or cycling, 3 or 4 times per week to reduce blood pressure, (2) Exercise should be prescribed as an adjunctive therapy for people who require pharmacologic therapy for hypertension, especially those who are not receiving beta-blockers.

Several options for pharmacologic therapy exist in this setting and include: vasopressin in combination with nitroglycerin, terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide. Metoclopramide and domperidone may also be useful but require additional study. At present, octreotide, administered intravenously as soon as variceal bleeding is suspected, is favored.",

Pharmacologic therapy has a definite role in the prevention of recurrent variceal bleeding and should be started as soon as the acute bleeding event has been controlled. Serial hemodynamic measurements are critical for success. Non-selective beta-blocker therapy is a reasonable first line approach followed by the addition of a long-acting nitrate for patients not achieving a 20% reduction in the hepatic venous pressure gradient.

Renal biopsies were taken before and after 38 (36-48) months of treatment. Albumin excretion rate, blood pressure and HbA1c were measured every third month. A reference group without antihypertensive treatment (group 3, n = 9), with similar age, diabetes duration and degree of microalbuminuria as group 1 and 2, had baseline and follow-up renal biopsies taken previously with an interval of 26-34 months, analysed at the same laboratory.

Microalbuminuria returned to normal in group 1 and 2 only. Decreased albumin excretion rate tended to inversely correlate with increased basement membrane thickness (p = 0.08) and diabetic glomerulopathy index (p = 0.05). Mean HbA1c was similar between groups. Mean diastolic blood pressure was lower in group 1 and 2 than in group 3 (p < 0.01).

However, these microspheres also showed a large burst release in the initial period. Post-coating of the PLA/PEG microspheres with a gelatin film by dipping the microspheres into a dilute gelatin solution effectively inhibited the initial burst release rate in the drug release tests. Post-coating of gelatin reduced 98% of the burst release. With thicker coatings, there were slower releasing rates, and the release rate can be simply related to the coating thickness.",

A face-centered central composite design (26 runs+3 center points) was selected and the variables studied were: filler ratio (lactose:dicalcium phosphate (50:50)), polymer level (15/32.5/50%), magnesium stearate level (1/1.5/2%), lubricant blend time (2/6/10 min) and compression force (400/600/800 kg). Granulations (1.5 kg, 3000 units) were manufactured using a fluid-bed process, lubricated and tablets (100 mg metoprolol tartrate) were compressed on an instrumented Manesty D3B rotary tablet press. Dissolution tests were performed using USP apparatus 2, at 50 rpm in 900 ml phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). Responses studied included percent drug released at Q1 (1 h), Q4, Q6, Q12. Analysis of variance indicated that change in polymer level was the most significant factor affecting drug release. Increase in dicalcium phosphate level and compression force were found to affect the percent released at the later dissolution time points. Some interaction effects between the variables studied were also found to be statistically significant. The drug release mechanism was predominantly found to be Fickian diffusion controlled (n=0.46-0.59). Response surface plots and regression models were developed which adequately described the experimental space. Three formulations having slow-, medium- and fast-releasing dissolution profiles were identified for a future bioavailability/bioequivalency study. The results of this study provided the framework for further work involving both in vivo studies and scale-up.",

Hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), carbopol, polycarbophil and sodium alginate were examined as mucoadhesive polymers. The characteristics of the suppositories differed depending on the choice of mucoadhesive polymer. For example, the gelation temperature was between 30 and 36 degrees C, the mucoadhesive force was between 430 and 5800 dyne/cm2, the apparent first-order release rate constant in phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, was between 0.399 and 0.271 h-1, the migration distance of the suppository in the rectum 4 h after administration was between 1 and 5 cm, and the bioavailability of propranolol was between 60.9 and 84.7%. Rectal bioavailability increased as the mucoadhesive force increased (r=0.984, p<0.0005), and the migration distance decreased (r=-0.951, p<0.005). No relationship was found between the bioavailability and the gelation temperature, drug release or irritation of the rectal mucosal membrane by the suppository. Therefore, retaining propranolol at the dosed site in the rectum by the addition of appropriate mucoadhesives to the formulation of liquid suppositories appears to be a very important factor in avoiding first-pass hepatic elimination and thereby increasing the bioavailability of the drug. Among the mucoadhesive polymers examined, sodium alginate and polycarbophil exhibited the largest mucoadhesive force and the smallest intrarectal migration resulting in the largest bioavailability of propranolol (84.7 and 82.3%, respectively). In contrast to other polymers, sodium alginate alone caused no irritation of the rectal mucosal membrane. Thus, poloxamer liquid suppositories containing sodium alginate appears to be a preferred formulation for drugs that are sensitive to extensive first-pass metabolism.",

We identified 72,263 patients age 65 years or older with a diagnosis of CHD. We examined data collected with the federally mandated Minimum Data Set, drug information, and Medicare hospital claims. Antiischemics were defined as beta-adrenergic blockers, long-term nitrates, and calcium channel blockers. We determined factors associated with use of the drugs by logistic regression. Antiischemic therapy was inversely related to age and cognitive and physical functioning, but positively associated with recent hospitalization and concomitant cardiovascular diseases. beta-Adrenergic blockers were least likely to be administered regardless of age, gender, or cognitive or physical function. We conclude that antiischemic therapy in nursing home residents may not be optimal.",

QT interval dispersion, measured as an interlead variability of QT, is a marker of dispersion of ventricular repolarization and, hence, of electrical instability. The present study was conducted to assess the occurrence of QT dispersion and its modulation during treatment with sotalol. Methods Twenty-five patients with the diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia were studied retrospectively. Fourteen patients were considered low risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death, and 11 high risk due to documented sustained ventricular arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, or sudden cardiac death. Twenty five healthy volunteers served as control subjects.",

We investigated the effects of carteolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, by administrating two different dosages (0.01 and 10.0 mg/kg) twice a day for 4 wk to control and DCM turkey poults. At completion of the study there was 59% mortality in the nontreated DCM group, 55% mortality in the group treated with the low dose of carteolol, and 22% mortality in the group treated with the high dose of carteolol. Both treated groups showed a significant decrease in left ventricle size and significant restoration of ejection fraction and left ventricular peak systolic pressure. Carteolol treatment increased beta-adrenergic receptor density, and the high carteolol dose restored SR Ca2+-ATPase and myofibrillar ATPase activities, along with creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, and ATP synthase activities, to normal. These results show that beta-blockade with carteolol improves survival, reverses contractile abnormalities, and induces cellular remodeling in this model of heart failure.", 
    "69": "Endogenous release of catecholamines is an important mechanism that can prevent alveolar flooding after brief but severe hemorrhagic shock. The objective of this study was to determine whether this catecholamine-dependent mechanism upregulates alveolar liquid clearance after prolonged hemorrhagic shock. Rats were hemorrhaged to a mean arterial pressure of 30-35 mmHg for 60 min and then resuscitated with a 4% albumin solution. Alveolar liquid clearance was measured 5 h later as the concentration of protein in the distal air spaces over 1 h after instillation of a 5% albumin solution into one lung. There was no upregulation of alveolar liquid clearance after prolonged hemorrhagic shock and fluid resuscitation despite a significant increase in plasma epinephrine levels. The intravenous or intra-alveolar administration of exogenous catecholamines did not upregulate alveolar liquid clearance. In contrast, catecholamine-mediated upregulation of alveolar liquid clearance was restored either by depletion of neutrophils with vinblastine, by the normalization of the concentration of reduced glutathione in the alveolar epithelial lining fluid by N-acetylcysteine, or by the inhibition of the conversion from xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase. These experiments provide the first in vivo evidence that a neutrophil-dependent oxidant injury to the alveolar epithelium prevents the upregulation of alveolar fluid clearance by catecholamines in the absence of a major alteration in paracellular permeability to protein after prolonged hemorrhagic shock.",

T4, T3, 3,5-T2, and DIT (10 n m) all increased current density relative to control to a similar degree: to 1.22+/-0.2, 1.21+/-0.03, 1.16+/-0.02 and 1.16+/-0.03, respectively, P<0.05. In contrast, thyroid hormone analogs with an altered side group of the inner iodophenyl ring, including tetrac, triac, and D-T3, had no effect on INa nor did rT3, MIT or tyrosine. Pretreatment with rT3 inhibited the effects of T4, T3, 3,5-T2, and DIT. Conversely, the dose-dependent inhibitory effect of amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative that antagonizes thyroid hormone actions, on INa was blocked when myocytes were pretreated with T3(100 n m, n=3), suggesting an interaction of T3 with amiodarone. The enhancement of INa by T3 and 3, 5-T2 could not be blocked by propranolol, suggesting that the effects are not mediated through beta -adrenergic signaling pathways. In conclusion, the present results suggest that the acute effects of thyroid hormone and analogs on cardiac INa are mediated by a non-genomic thyroid hormone receptor with a unique structure-activity relationship.", 
    "75": "The aim of the present functional study was to assess the role of beta3-adrenoceptors in the light of recent findings suggesting the existence of a putative fourth beta-adrenoceptor in adipose and heart tissue. The effect of the non-conventional beta3-adrenoceptor partial agonist CGP12177A is resistant to the effect of the beta3-adrenoceptor antagonist SR59230A. Under isotonic conditions in circular muscle strips of human distal colon, the concentration-effect relationship of CGP12177A and SR59104A (beta3-adrenoceptor agonists), alone and in the presence of CGP20712A (beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist) ICI118551 (beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist) and SR59230A, all 0.1 microm was studied. CGP12177A concentration-dependently relaxed circular muscle strips (pEC50=6.16+/-0.05). This effect was left unchanged by beta1-/beta2-adrenoceptor blockade, but antagonised by SR59230A (pA2=8.12+/-0.02). SR59104A concentration-dependently relaxed circular muscle strips (pEC50=5.43+/-0.01), an effect that was not significantly affected by pretreatment with CGP20712A and ICI118551, but competitively antagonised by SR59230A (p KB=7.89). Isoprenaline-induced relaxations were antagonised by propranolol with a low pA2value (7.76+/-0.16).

Haloperidol (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) and mianserin (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) also exerted an inhibitory effect on non-stressed normal mice.

Our results show that relative LV mass and the LV content of IGF-1 were significantly lower with all antihypertensive drugs in GB rats (p<0.001). Serum concentrations of IGF-1 were lower in GB rats treated with enalapril, alpha-methyldopa and propanolol (p<0.01), but not in those treated with losartan.

This task has proved to be useful in studying time-dependent postacquisition intracellular processes necessary for long-term memory. The present experiments evaluated the temporal dynamics of the role of beta-noradrenergic receptors in long-term consolidation. Rats were implanted with intracerebroventricular cannulae and trained in a single session to find reinforcement in a hole in a sponge impregnated with a particular odor. Injections of the beta-receptor antagonist timolol were made at 5 min, 1, 2, or 5 hr after training. Memory and relearning ability were evaluated 48 hr later. Rats treated with timolol 2 hr after training showed a memory deficit at the retention test, but were able to relearn the task normally. Injections at the earlier or later time points were ineffective. The results reinforce previous observations with systemic injections that beta-noradrenergic receptors are involved in the late phase of memory consolidation and suggest a critical time window during which they are necessary. The time window is compatible with the current view that long-term memory depends on late involvement of the cAMP cascade leading to new protein synthesis necessary for synaptic reorganization.",

Five hundred and four patients, with a mean age of 62 +/- 12 years, were included during the hospital period in the 74 participating intensive care units, 9 +/- 6 days after myocardial infarction (ejection fraction 34 +/- 6%). After a 6.25 mg test dose of Captopril, the dosage was progressively increased to the target dose of 150 mg at the end of the first month. Of the 504 patients included, 343 finished the trial and 161 stopped the trial prematurely.

There was no significant change in blood pressure for the whole study population. However, the systolic blood pressure of the patients receiving 150 mg/day of Captopril at the end of the trial was slightly higher than that observed at the end of the hospital period (126 +/- 17 mmHg and 116 +/- 17 mmHg respectively, p = 0.006). Severe Intercurrent events were observed in 89 patients: 24 deaths, 7 recurrent infarctions, 58 hospital admissions (21 for cardiac failure, 15 for recurrence of angina, 11 aorto-coronary bypass operations, 7 coronary angioplasties, 2 cerebro-vascular accidents, 2 systemic emboli). Of the benign complications, hypotension was observed in 25% of patients, nearly half of which occurred during the hospital admission. The drugs prescribed in association with Captopril were Aspirin (78%), betablockers (57%), nitrate derivatives (42%) and diuretics (27%). Multivariate analysis showed 3 factors associated with good tolerance of the 150 mg dosage of Captopril: Killip Class I or II on admission, an ejection fraction > 30% and an initial systolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg. In conclusion, in this trial of dose titration, 3 out of 4 patients with myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction, tolerated the 150 mg/day dosage of Captopril.

We tested the concept that ion channel modulators as a class of agents suppress contact hypersensitivity in a mouse model. Mice were sensitized to several contact sensitizing chemicals including dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) and a sensitizing drug, nadolol. We report our successful use of several ion channel modulators in suppressing contact hypersensitivity, including amiloride, ethacrynic acid (ECA), nifedipine and verapamil. For this purpose, Balb/c female mice were sensitized with DNCB, and abrogation of induction of contact hypersensitivity reaction (CHR) was examined by topical pretreatment of the target-sensitized skin with amiloride, nifedipine and pairwise combinations of these agents with ECA, a potassium ion channel blocker. Abrogation of induction of CHR was observed in all cases. In addition, suppression of contact hypersensitivity was observed in nadolol-sensitized mice pretreated with either verapamil or nifedipine. The results indicate that ion channel inhibitors are broadly effective inhibitors of allergic contact dermatitis and may be useful for facilitating the transdermal delivery of therapeutic drugs that have sensitization potential.",

Association of vibrissa stimulation with beta-receptor activation resulted in subsequent conditioned responses to vibrissa stimulation alone, in a dose-dependent manner. Together, these results suggest that early associative somatosensory conditioning requires and involves NE in a manner similar to that previously demonstrated for early olfactory learning.", 
    "110": "Contrary to widely held belief, physical dependency is not systematic in alcohol dependence. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome can appear even without stopping (or sharply decreasing) high or chronic alcohol intake. It occurs through revelation of a physicochemical cerebral response (membrane changes and decrease in modulation systems) to chronic intoxication. Given the differences in severity, the lability of symptoms and the rapid evolution of the syndrome, the repeated use of scales to evaluate intensity is suggested. Management should be based on this index in order to treat minor forms and to avoid a course to severe forms, which should be transferred to the intensive care unit.", 
    "111": "The adverse effects of long term treatment of asthma with the short acting beta agonist fenoterol have been established in both epidemiological and clinical studies. A study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy and safety of long term treatment with salbutamol and salmeterol in patients with mild to moderate bronchial asthma.", 
    "112": "In a two centre double dummy crossover study 165 patients were randomly assigned to receive salbutamol 400 micrograms q.i.d., salmeterol 50 micrograms b.i.d., or placebo via a Diskhaler. All patients used salbutamol as required for symptom relief. The study comprised a four week run in and three treatment periods of 24 weeks, each of which was followed by a four week washout. Asthma control was assessed by measuring mean morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), a composite daily asthma score, and minor and major exacerbation rates. Washout assessments included methacholine challenge and bronchodilator dose response tests. Analysis was by intention to treat.", 
    "113": "Data from 157 patients were analysed. Relative to placebo, the mean morning PEFR increased by 30 l/min (95% CI 26 to 35) for salmeterol but did not change for salbutamol. Evening PEFR increased by 25 l/min (95% CI 21 to 30) and 21 l/min (95% CI 17 to 26), respectively (p < 0.001). Salmeterol improved the asthma score compared to placebo (p < 0.001), but there was no overall difference with salbutamol. Only daytime symptoms were improved with salbutamol. The minor exacerbation rates were 0.29, 0.88, and 0.97 exacerbations/patient/year for salmeterol, salbutamol and placebo, respectively (p < 0.0001 for salmeterol). The corresponding major exacerbation rates were 0.22, 0.51 and 0.40, respectively (p < 0.03 for salmeterol). For salbutamol the asthma score deteriorated over time (p < 0.01), and the time spent in major exacerbation was significantly longer compared with placebo (12.3 days (95% CI 4.2 to 20.4) versus 8.4 days (95% CI 5.2 to 11.6), p = 0.02). There was no evidence of rebound deterioration in asthma control, lung function, or bronchial hyper-responsiveness following cessation of either active treatment, and no evidence of tolerance to salbutamol or salmeterol.", 
    "114": "Regular treatment with salmeterol is effective in controlling asthma symptoms and reduces minor more than major exacerbation rates. Salbutamol was associated with improved daytime symptoms but subtle deterioration in asthma control occurred over time. Salbutamol should therefore be used only as required.", 
    "115": "Intracellular application of the sulfonylurea tolbutamide during whole-cell patch-clamp recordings stimulated exocytosis >5-fold when applied at a cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration of 0.17 microM. This effect was not detectable in the complete absence of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and when exocytosis was elicited by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS). The stimulatory action could be antagonized by the sulfonamide diazoxide, by the Cl--channel blocker 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS), by intracellular application of the antibody JSB1 [originally raised against a 170-kDa multidrug resistance (mdr) protein], and by tamoxifen (an inhibitor of the mdr- and volume-regulated Cl- channels). Immunocytochemistry and Western blot analyses revealed that JSB1 recognizes a 65-kDa protein in the secretory granules. This protein exhibited no detectable binding of sulfonylureas and is distinct from the 140-kDa sulfonylurea high-affinity sulfonylurea receptors also present in the granules. We conclude that (i) tolbutamide stimulates Ca2+-dependent exocytosis secondary to its binding to a 140-kDa high-affinity sulfonylurea receptor in the secretory granules; and (ii) a granular 65-kDa mdr-like protein mediates the action. The processes thus initiated culminate in the activation of a granular Cl- conductance. We speculate that the activation of granular Cl- fluxes promotes exocytosis (possibly by providing the energy required for membrane fusion) by inducing water uptake and an increased intragranular hydrostatic pressure.", 
    "116": "An 84-kDa group VI phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) that does not require Ca2+ for catalysis has been cloned from Chinese hamster ovary cells, murine P388D1 cells, and pancreatic islet beta-cells. A housekeeping role for iPLA2 in generating lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) acceptors for arachidonic acid incorporation into phosphatidylcholine (PC) has been proposed because iPLA2 inhibition reduces LPC levels and suppresses arachidonate incorporation and phospholipid remodeling in P388D1 cells. Because islet beta-cell phospholipids are enriched in arachidonate, we have examined the role of iPLA2 in arachidonate incorporation into islets and INS-1 insulinoma cells. Inhibition of iPLA2 with a bromoenol lactone (BEL) suicide substrate did not suppress and generally enhanced [3H]arachidonate incorporation into these cells in the presence or absence of extracellular calcium at varied time points and BEL concentrations. Arachidonate incorporation into islet phospholipids involved deacylation-reacylation and not de novo synthesis, as indicated by experiments with varied extracellular glucose concentrations and by examining [14C]glucose incorporation into phospholipids. BEL also inhibited islet cytosolic phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAPH), but the PAPH inhibitor propranolol did not affect arachidonate incorporation into islet or INS-1 cell phospholipids. Inhibition of islet iPLA2 did not alter the phospholipid head-group classes into which [3H]arachidonate was initially incorporated or its subsequent transfer from PC to other lipids. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric measurements indicated that inhibition of INS-1 cell iPLA2 accelerated arachidonate incorporation into PC and that inhibition of islet iPLA2 reduced LPC levels by 25%, suggesting that LPC mass does not limit arachidonate incorporation into islet PC. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry measurements indicated that BEL but not propranolol suppressed insulin secretagogue-induced hydrolysis of arachidonate from islet phospholipids. In islets and INS-1 cells, iPLA2 is thus not required for arachidonate incorporation or phospholipid remodeling and may play other roles in these cells.", 
    "117": "Recent studies of beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) subtype signaling in in vitro preparations have raised doubts as to whether the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling is activated in the same manner in response to beta2-AR versus beta1-AR stimulation.", 
    "118": "The present study compared, in the intact dog, the magnitude and characteristics of chronotropic, inotropic, and lusitropic effects of cAMP accumulation, PKA activation, and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of key effector proteins in response to beta-AR subtype stimulation. In addition, many of these parameters and L-type Ca2+ current (ICa) were also measured in single canine ventricular myocytes. The results indicate that although the cAMP/PKA-dependent phosphorylation cascade activated by beta1-AR stimulation could explain the resultant modulation of cardiac function, substantial beta2-AR-mediated chronotropic, inotropic, and lusitropic responses occurred in the absence of PKA activation and phosphorylation of nonsarcolemmal proteins, including phospholamban, troponin I, C protein, and glycogen phosphorylase kinase. However, in single canine myocytes, we found that beta2-AR-stimulated increases in both ICa and contraction were abolished by PKA inhibition. Thus, the beta2-AR-directed cAMP/PKA signaling modulates sarcolemmal L-type Ca2+ channels but does not regulate PKA-dependent phosphorylation of cytoplasmic proteins.", 
    "119": "These results indicate that the dissociation of beta2-AR signaling from cAMP regulatory systems is only apparent and that beta2-AR-stimulated cAMP/PKA signaling is uncoupled from phosphorylation of nonsarcolemmal regulatory proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling.", 
    "120": "On the basis of the presence of beta2-receptors within the sympathetic nervous system, beta2-stimulation may increase cardiac sympathetic outflow. We addressed the hypothesis that sympathoexcitatory beta2-receptors are present in the human left ventricle.", 
    "121": "The beta2-agonist salbutamol was infused into the left coronary artery in 3 groups of patients: group 1 (n=9, no beta-blocker therapy), group 2 (n=7, beta1-selective blockade with atenolol), and group 3 (n=6, nonselective beta-blockade with nadolol). Left ventricular +dP/dt in response to increasing concentrations of salbutamol was measured in all groups, and cardiac norepinephrine spillover was measured in group 1. There were no systemic hemodynamic changes in any group. Salbutamol resulted in a 44+/-6% increase in +dP/dt in group 1, a 25+/-6% increase in group 2 (P<0.05 versus group 1), and no increase in group 3. Salbutamol also resulted in a 124+/-37% increase in cardiac norepinephrine spillover in group 1 (P<0.05).", 
    "122": "Evidence that salbutamol increased norepinephrine release from cardiac sympathetic nerves was provided by the observations that atenolol suppressed the salbutamol inotropic response, demonstrating that this response was mediated in part by beta1-receptors and that salbutamol also resulted in an increase in cardiac norepinephrine spillover. This result provides in vivo evidence, in humans, for the role of sympathoexcitatory cardiac beta2-receptors.", 
    "123": "Nebivolol is a lipophilic beta1-blocker. It is devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilising activity but appears to have nitric oxide-mediated vasodilatory effects. Nebivolol is administered as a racemic mixture of equal proportions of d- and l-enantiomers. The drug does not significantly influence glucose or plasma lipid metabolism and appears to have a protective effect on left ventricular function. At the recommended dosage (5 mg once daily) nebivolol reduces resting diastolic blood pressure as effectively as standard therapeutic dosages of atenolol, metoprolol, lisinopril and nifedipine, as shown in comparative trials. Nebivolol reduced blood pressure significantly more than enalapril 10 mg daily in the short but not the long term, although the enalapril dose may not have been optimal. Nebivolol has an additive effect in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Standing blood pressure and/or mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure is significantly and similarly reduced with nebivolol, atenolol or nifedipine. Nebivolol tended to prevent increases in early morning blood pressure better than nifedipine. Overall response rates to nebivolol therapy (a decrease in sitting/supine diastolic blood pressure to < or = 90 mm Hg or a 10% or > or = 10 mm Hg fall in diastolic blood pressure) ranged from 58 to 81% after 4 to 52 weeks' treatment. In comparative studies, response rates were greater in nebivolol than in enalapril or metoprolol recipients, but not significantly different from those in atenolol or nifedipine recipients. Nebivolol 5 mg once daily is well tolerated in patients with hypertension. Adverse events are infrequent, transient and mild to moderate. Those reported most often include headache, fatigue, paraesthesias and dizziness. Several studies reported no signs of orthostatic hypotension with nebivolol. Comparative trials revealed no significant differences between the frequency and severity of adverse events in patients receiving nebivolol, atenolol, enalapril or placebo; however, the overall incidence of adverse events was greater with nifedipine or metoprolol. Some atenolol or enalapril, but not nebivolol, recipients reported impotence or decreased libido during therapy.", 
    "124": "Current evidence indicates that nebivolol 5 mg once daily is a well tolerated beta-blocker, which is as effective as once daily atenolol and other classes of antihypertensive agents. It may therefore be recommended as a useful alternative first-line treatment option for the management of patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension.", 
    "125": "Systematic, prospective data regarding phenotypic features, including echocardiographic findings, in pediatric patients with the Marfan syndrome are lacking. In addition, limited and conflicting information exists regarding the impact of pharmacologic therapy on aortic growth rate in children. Fifty-three children and adolescents with the Marfan syndrome underwent physical examination, anthropometric evaluation, and echocardiography. The relation of pharmacologic therapy to aortic growth rate was examined in the 44 subjects in whom serial echocardiograms were recorded. Although boys and girls did not differ in ocular, skeletal, or cardiovascular manifestations, aortic dilatation tended to be more common in boys (86% vs 72%). Children with aortic dilatation at baseline (42 of 53 or 79%) were more likely to also have scoliosis and mitral prolapse (both p <0.005). The medicated patients had slower aortic growth than the unmedicated patients with regard to both absolute aortic growth rate (p <0.01) and aortic growth rate adjusted for age and body size (p <0.005). Nevertheless, major cardiovascular complications developed in 5 patients despite long-term pharmacologic therapy. In conclusion, beta-blocker and calcium antagonist therapy retards aortic growth rate in children and adolescents with the Marfan syndrome.",

    "131": "The aim of this study was to determine whether sympathetic imbalance in congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) can be identified by cardiac sympathetic neuronal dysinnervation. 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a tracer of the norepinephrine analogue which reflects the regional innervation and norepinephrine kinetics in cardiac sympathetic nerves. Sixteen patients with LQTS, who were members of 12 families, and 7 normal controls underwent MIBG scintigraphy. Myocardial SPET and planar images were obtained 15 min and 4 h after the injection of MIBG in each patient. The relative regional uptake (RRU) and regional washout rate (rWR) of MIBG at 4 h in each of nine regions were compared with those in the control group. The heat-to-mediastinum ratio (H/M) and global washout rate (GWR) were also calculated. The RRU, rWR, H/M and GWR showed no significant difference between LQTS patients and normal controls. Furthermore, the RRU in 96% of all regions in LQTS was within the mean +/- 2 standard deviations of that in the control group. Patients with LQTS have normal cardiac sympathetic innervation, as assessed by MIBG. The sympathetic imbalance hypothesis is unlikely to be attributed to an abnormal distribution and different regional norepinephrine kinetics of cardiac sympathetic nerves.", 
    "132": "Glucagon is a counter-regulatory hormone that is classically used to treat hypoglycemia. However, it can elicit the generation of cAMP within the myocardium to cause positive inotropic and chronotropic effects without the need for beta-1 adrenoceptor stimulation. Glucagon has been used extensively to treat beta-blocker overdose and has evidence for use in verapamil and imipramine overdose as well. Glucagon has been used as adjunctive therapy in shock situations and heart failure but is inferior to catecholamines. An interesting potential indication for glucagon is in treating postcountershock asystole.", 
    "133": "The goal of the present experiment was to measure the volume of the different compartments in liver of exercised rats and to get some insights into the appropriate working of the hepatic function following exercise. Hence, livers from male rats were isolated and perfused after treadmill exercise or rest. This procedure was performed on rats that were overnight semifasted (50% food restriction) or well fed. To evaluate the hepatocyte cell volume, the multiple-indicator dilution curve technique was used after 40 min of perfusion. Radioactive tracers for red blood cells, sucrose, and water were used to measure liver vascular space, liver interstitial space, and water cellular space, respectively. The hepatocyte function was assessed by taurocholate and propanolol clearance. Oxygen consumption, intrahepatic resistance, bile secretion, and lactate dehydrogenase release estimated liver viability. Liver viability and hepatocyte function were not changed following exercise either in the fed or in the semifasted animals. As expected, liver glycogen levels were significantly (P < 0.01) reduced in the food-restricted rats. Consequently, liver glycogen levels following exercise were decreased significantly (P < 0.01) only in the fed rats. Despite this, exercise decreased the hepatocyte water space in both food-restricted and fed groups ( approximately 15%; P < 0.01) without altering the sinusoidal and interstitial space. The present data show that acute exercise decreased the hepatocyte volume and that this volume change is not entirely linked to a decrease in hepatic glycogen level.", 
    "134": "Approximately 50 million people have hypertension. Many agents with differing efficacy, side effects, dosing schedules, and costs are available to treat hypertension. Joint National Committee (JNC) guidelines attempt to simplify this decision by recommending specific agents based on special considerations such as comorbidities. The objective of this study was to survey primary care physicians' antihypertensive prescribing practices and their treatment recommendations for patients with comorbidities. A direct mail survey was sent to a national random sample of 500 office-based primary care internists, family practitioners, and general practitioners. There were no significant differences between initial treatment recommendations at the time of the survey and those recommended before the survey. However, there were several therapeutic classes whose reported utilization for specific comorbidities significantly changed over 18 months. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reportedly increased in patients with congestive heart failure and diabetes. In addition, the reported use of selective beta-blockers increased for patients with a history of myocardial infarction. Physicians did not follow JNC recommendations when initiating treatment in black patients, older patients, or those with mild renal failure. Younger physicians were more likely than older physicians to select agents consistent with guideline recommendations. Physicians did not adhere to JNC guidelines when initiating treatment in patients with comorbidities; however, more physicians are prescribing recommended agents today as compared to 18 months ago. Younger physicians were more likely to prescribe agents consistent with the guidelines. More direct efforts are needed to ensure awareness and compliance with these guidelines.", 
    "135": "Four diastereomeric propranolol ester prodrugs (1S2S, 1S2R, 1R2S, 1R2R) were synthesized by treating pure R- and S-propranolol hydrochloride with pure enantiomers R- and S-phenylbutyryl chloride. A HPLC technique using alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (chiral AGP) column was developed to study the racemization of propranolol enantiomers during synthesis and hydrolysis studies. A reversed phase HPLC method was also developed to simultaneously analyze propranolol and the ester prodrug. Hydrolysis of these esters was studied in different rat tissue homogenates, i.e., liver, intestine, plasma, skin, brain, and pure plasma cholinesterases, i.e., butyryl cholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8) and acetyl cholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7). In vitro percutaneous permeation studies across full thickness shaved rat skin were performed using standard side-by-side diffusion cells at 37 degrees C. The disappearance of the diastereomeric ester prodrugs in rat tissue homogenates followed apparent first-order kinetics and was stereoselective. The ratio of brain to plasma hydrolytic rate constants are 27.8, 5.58, 6.07, and 2.97 for 1S2S, 1R2R, 1R2S, and 1S2R esters, respectively. Hydrolysis of all four diastereomeric ester prodrugs was faster by acetyl cholinesterase than butyryl cholinesterase and is stereoselective. The permeability coefficients [Kp x 10(3) (cm h-1)] are 1.40 +/- 0.30, 1.41 +/- 0.27, 42.20 +/- 1.24, 29.26 +/- 3.41, 16.27 +/- 3.12, 12.99 +/- 2.84 for (R)-propranolol, (S)-propranolol, 1S2S, 1R2S, 1S2R, and 1R2R ester prodrugs, respectively. The results indicate that the 1R2S diastereomeric ester prodrug of propranolol shows greatest stability in liver and intestinal tissues while it exhibits fairly rapid conversion in plasma. The results also suggest the configuration on the second chiral carbon atom to be the determinant in the rate of hydrolysis of all the diastereomeric prodrugs in all biological media examined. The Kp of all four prodrugs markedly increased compared to that of the parent drug, with 1S2S showing a 30-fold increase in skin permeability, the highest among all four prodrugs.",

Ochronosis is a rare disease, with chronic benign course, but frequently followed by complications. Histopathological criteria for the diagnosis of this disease are described in detail.", 
    "137": "The purpose of this experiment was to examine the effects of both exercise and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade on the expression of native cardiac myosin isoforms. Specifically, this experiment tested two hypotheses: 1) treatment of sedentary rats with the beta blocker, propranolol, will promote increased ventricular V3 (slow) native myosin content with a concomitant reduction of V1 (fast) myosin isoforms; and 2) endurance exercise training will result in an increased sympathetic drive and therefore will retard the propranolol-induced shift in cardiac myosin isoform expression.", 
    "138": "Adult, male Sprauge-Dawley rats (120 days old) were randomly divided into 4 groups: 1) exercise-sham (ES); 2) exercise-propranolol (EP); 3) sedentary-sham (SS); and 4) sedentary-propranolol (SP). Propranolol (30 mg drug/kg body wt) and sham (saline) injections (i.p.) were administered 30 minutes prior to daily exercise. Both ES and EP groups completed six weeks (5 day/wk) of treadmill running at approximately 65-70% VO2max.", 
    "139": "Data analysis revealed that exercise training did not alter (p > 0.05) ventricular myosin isoforms in the sham injected animals. In contrast, propranolol treatment resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the slow (V3) myosin isoform and a concomitant decrease in the V1 isoform in both sedentary and exercise trained animals.", 
    "140": "The observed increase in V3 myosin isoform in propranolol treated rats supports the notion that beta-adrenergic stimulation is an important regulator of cardiac myosin isoform expression. However, our hypothesis that exercise training would retard the propranolol-induced shift in cardiac myosin was not supported.", 
    "141": "Priming of human eosinophils is an essential event for the respiratory burst induced by serum-opsonized particles [serum-treated zymosan (STZ)]. In this study we have found that treatment of eosinophils with platelet-activating factor (PAF) leads to activation of phospholipase D. Inhibition of the formation of phospholipase D-derived products by ethanol resulted in about 90% inhibition of PAF-induced binding of fluorescent STZ particles to the cells, but only when ethanol was added to the cells before treatment with PAF. When ethanol was added after treatment with PAF, only a minor inhibition of the STZ binding and STZ-induced response was observed. These results indicate that phospholipase D-derived phosphatidic acid is involved in PAF priming, without having an effect on STZ stimulation. In the presence of propranolol, which inhibits phosphatidic acid-phosphatase activity, binding of STZ particles to human eosinophils induced by suboptimal concentrations of PAF was enhanced, indicating that phosphatidic acid and not diradylglyceride is the relevant molecule derived from phospholipase D activity. Addition of cell-permeant diC8-phosphatidic acid (DiC8-PA) to human eosinophils resulted in CD11b/CD18-dependent adhesion, both to STZ particles and fibronectin-coated wells, without significant upregulation of CD11b/CD18. The DiC8-PA-induced adhesion was not mediated via the fatty acid moiety, because other C8-lipids such as 1,2-diC8-phosphatidylcholine, 1-C8-monoacylglycerol or C8-ceramide were without effect. Activation of protein kinase C with PMA or 1,2-diC8-diacylglycerol did result in enhanced STZ binding. However, under these latter conditions upregulation of CD11b/CD18 was observed. Taken together, these results suggest that phospholipase D-derived PA is involved in changing the affinity of the CD11b/CD18 integrin for its ligands.", 
    "142": "Heart failure, still nowadays an important cause of morbidity and mortality in many countries, is a complex of symptoms related to inadequate peripheric perfusion and often to the retention of fluid, that results from an impaired left ventricular pump function. Treatment of heart failure has seen considerable changes in the last years. Short term goals of therapy are directed towards the relieve of symptoms that can be commonly managed by the use of vasodilators, diuretics, digoxin, in order to obtain an improvement in myocardial functional capacity and quality of life of patients. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that improvement of symptoms is not necessarily correlated with correction of left ventricular dysfunction and, most important, with improvement of survival. In late 1980s both experimental and clinical observations carried out in an attempt to explain the progression of the disease and its poor long-term survival, led the physicians to think about heart failure as a neurohormonal disorder. This new conceptual model has first led to the widespread introduction of angiotensin converting inhibitors in clinical practice; then, the evidence that sympathetic activation might play an important role in the progression of heart failure, led the investigators to propose that beta-blocking agents might be useful in the management of heart failure. Accumulating clinical evidence indicates that beta blocker therapy, particularly with third generation beta-blocking agents, not only improves left ventricular function but also may reduce and reverse pathological remodeling in the heart. Ongoing large scale clinical trials may confirm the mounting evidence, from numerous clinical studies, that these agents may prolong survival in patients with heart failure.", 
    "143": "In order to investigate the putative role of beta3-adrenoceptors in central and peripheral cardiovascular regulations, the effects of intracisternal (i.c.) and intravenous (i.v.) injections of SR 58611 A (10, 50, 100 and 200 nmol kg-1), a selective beta3-adrenoceptor agonist, were investigated in chloralose anaesthetized dogs. In normal dogs, i.v. SR 58611 A (100 and 200 nmol kg-1) induced a dose-dependent increase in heart rate with no change in blood pressure. After i.c. injection, SR 58611 A failed to modify blood pressure and heart rate (except at the highest dose 200 nmol kg-1 which induced a positive chronotropic effect). The positive chronotropic effect of SR 58611 A (200 nmol kg-1) appeared earlier and was significantly more pronounced after i.v. than i.c. administration. The positive chronotropic effect of i.v. SR 58611 A (200 nmol kg-1) was reduced by pretreatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists [propranolol, nadolol, bupranolol or the beta3-adrenoceptor selective antagonist, SR 59230 A (2 mg kg-1 i.v.)] and suppressed after sinoaortic denervation (i.e. after removal of vagal tone to the heart). These experiments do not show evidence for a primary central cardiovascular effect of SR 58611 A. The positive chronotropic effect of i.v. SR 58611 A is mainly of peripheral origin and can be attributed to a baroreceptor-mediated reflex due to the beta3-adrenoceptor mediated vasodilation with an increase in sympathetic tone and a reduction in vagal tone to the heart.", 
    "144": "The effect known as the GTP-shift refers to the complete conversion of receptors from the high- to the low agonist-affinity state in the presence of an excess of GTP or one of its analogs. 5'-Guanylylimidodiphosphate (GppNHp) was able to fully suppress the high (-)-isoproterenol-affinity of beta-adrenoceptors (beta AR) in cultured rat brain astrocytes. In contrast, a proportion of beta AR in rat cortex and cerebellum synaptosomes was found to be insensitive to this GTP analog. This GppNHp-insensitivity was due to a membrane-associated factor, presumably interacting with Gs proteins and not present in a functional form in cultured astrocytes. Here we assessed the effect of this factor on the beta AR-mediated activation of Gs proteins. The removal of the GppNHp-insensitivity factor from the synaptosomes was achieved using 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), a mild detergent. The activation of Gs proteins was monitored by the binding of another non-hydrolysable GTP-analog, guanylyl 5'-[gamma-[35S]thio]-triphosphate ([35S]GTP gamma S). The beta AR-Gs protein coupling was at least twofold less efficient in synaptosomes relative to cultured astrocytes. The CHAPS treatment induced a twofold increase in the coupling efficiency in cortex and cerebellum synaptosomes, but had no effect in cultured astrocytes. It undoubtedly indicated the inhibitory effect of the GppNHp-insensitivity factor on the activation of Gs proteins in the synaptosomes. Using CHAPS-soluble material extracted from synaptosomes, it was possible to reconstitute the GppNHp-insensitivity of CHAPS-treated membranes or even to induce it in cultured astrocytes. This effect correlated with the amount of CHAPS-soluble material according to a sigmoid curve, but it was abolished by the heat of CHAPS-soluble material. Successful crossed reconstitutions of the GppNHp-insensitivity suggest that the GppNHp-insensitivity factor is the same regardless of its originating area, and that it might play a general role in the central nervous system. Further investigations should help to identify the GppNHp-insensitivity factor.", 
    "145": "Investigations with in vitro and animal models suggest an interaction between amiodarone and beta-blockers. The objective of this work was to explore if an interaction with beta-blocker treatment plays a role in the decrease of cardiac arrhythmic deaths with amiodarone in patients recovered from an acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "146": "A pooled database from 2 similar randomized clinical trials, the European Amiodarone Myocardial Infarction Trial (EMIAT) and the Canadian Amiodarone Myocardial Infarction Trial (CAMIAT), was used. Four groups of post-myocardial infarction patients were defined: beta-blockers and amiodarone used, beta-blockers used alone, amiodarone used alone, and neither used. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. Unadjusted and adjusted relative risks for all-cause mortality, cardiac death, arrhythmic cardiac death, nonarrhythmic cardiac death, arrhythmic death, or resuscitated cardiac arrest were lower for patients receiving beta-blockers and amiodarone than for those without beta-blockers, with or without amiodarone. The interaction was statistically significant for cardiac death and arrhythmic death or resuscitated cardiac arrest (P=0.05 and 0.03, respectively). Findings were consistent across subgroups.", 
    "147": "These findings are based on a post hoc analysis. However, they confirm prior results from in vitro and animal experiments suggesting an interaction between beta-blockers and amiodarone. In practice, not only is the adjunct of amiodarone to beta-blockers not hazardous, but beta-blocker therapy should be continued if possible in patients in whom amiodarone is indicated.", 
    "148": "The authors have previously reported that oscillatory potentials (O.P.) of the electroretinogram are impaired in essential hypertensive patients before the appearance of funduscopic changes. They can therefore be considered an early marker of the nervous damage induced by hypertension. Aim of this study was to evaluate whether an antihypertensive regimen could influence the progression of this damage. O.P. were recorded in 35 essential hypertensives before antihypertensive treatment and after one-year treatment. The patients were randomly allocated into 4 treatment groups: 1) beta-blockers 2) ACE-Inhibitors 3) calcium antagonists 4) no pharmacological treatment. At the end of the study, blood pressure was significantly decreased in all but group 4. O.P., similar in the 4 groups at the beginning, were significantly higher at the end of the study only in patients treated with ACE-inhibitors. The results of this study suggest that although all hypotensive agents reduced blood pressure only ACE-I showed a protective effect on the retinal electric electrophysiology in hypertensive patients.", 
    "149": "The effect of intravenous administration of disopyramide (total dose 100 mg, bolus 20 mg every 5 minutes) was compared with that of propranolol (total dose 10 mg, bolus 2 mg every 5 minutes) in a patient with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular pressure gradient (LVPG) was assessed by continuous wave Doppler flowmetry. LVPG markedly decreased (97 to 16 mmHg), and preejection period (PEP) increased with an increase in heart rate (HR) during disopyramide injection. No changes were observed in LVPG and PEP, and a decrease occurred in HR during propranolol administration. These results indicate that disopyramide produced greater effects on the reduction of LVPG than propranolol, a negative inotropic agent, did.", 
    "150": "The effect of the antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone on the human myocardial beta-adrenoceptor-G protein-adenylyl cyclase signalling cascade was investigated. Amiodarone had no effect on myocardial G proteins and maximal adenylyl cyclase activity, but acted as a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. This mechanism might be at least partially responsible for the beneficial effects of the drug in patients with arrhythmia and heart failure.", 
    "151": "A possible mechanism of action of antimigraine drugs such as sumatriptan is inhibition of the trigeminovascular pathway. Sumatriptan's effects might be mediated by 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D or 5-HT1F receptors. To establish the relative importance of these subtypes, we compared the effects of sumatriptan with those of a selective 5-HT1F receptor agonist (LY 344864) on c-fos protein expression in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. c-fos expression was induced in urethane-anaesthetized rats by intracisternal capsaicin administration. Sumatriptan and LY 344864 decreased the number of capsaicin-induced c-fos-like immunoreactive cells within trigeminal nucleus caudalis (ID50 = 0.04 and 0.6 mg kg(-1)). The effect of sumatriptan, but not of LY 344864, was prevented by pretreatment with the antagonist SDZ 21-009, which displays high affinity for rat 5-HT1B receptors. LY 344864 appears to attenuate c-fos-like immunoreactivity via 5-HT1F receptors, while sumatriptan acts via 5-HT1B receptors. The fact that activation of 5-HT1F receptors is sufficient to modulate the activity of the trigeminal system suggests that this receptor may be a target for antimigraine drugs with improved safety profile.", 
    "152": "A prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled study was undertaken to compare the perioperative analgesic and recovery characteristics of equipotent doses of tramadol, pethidine and nalbuphine (3.0 mg kg-1, 1.5 mg kg-1 and 0.3 mg kg-1 respectively) with placebo (saline 0.02 ml kg-1) given at induction of anaesthesia in 152 ASA 1 children and young adults undergoing tonsillo-adenoidectomy. Premedication (temazepam and diclofenac), induction and maintenance of anaesthesia (thiopentone, atracurium, nitrous oxide and isoflurane), with controlled ventilation, were standardized. Variables monitored were heart rate (HR) and systolic arterial pressure (SAP) during surgery, time to recovery of spontaneous respiration at the termination of anaesthesia and restlessness, time to awakening, sedation and emesis in the recovery unit. Increases in HR or SAP > 33% of baseline during surgery were treated with esmolol 2.0 mg kg-1 intravenously (i.v.) and restlessness during recovery was treated with the same opioid i.v. given with an aesthesia, or pethidine i.v. in the placebo group. With placebo, there was a high requirement for esmolol during surgery and for pethidine in the recovery ward. Tramadol did not reduce the rate of intra-operative treatment with esmolol, but reduced the tramadol requirement during recovery (P < 0.05). Pethidine and nalbuphine reduced the intra-operative esmolol requirement more significantly (P < 0.025 and P < 0.005 respectively) and the need for treatment during recovery with opioids (P < 0.005 each). The time to recovery of spontaneous respiration at the end of anaesthesia was only delayed by pethidine. Other recovery variables were similar, except that restlessness-pain scores were reduced by tramadol (P < 0.02), pethidine (P < 0.005) and nalbuphine (P < 0.005). These results suggest that pethidine 1.5 mg kg-1 and nalbuphine 0.3 mg kg-1 given with induction of anaesthesia provide better analgesia during and after tonsillo-adenoidectomy than does tramadol 3.0 mg kg-1. The delay to recovery of spontaneous respiration with pethidine suggests a greater safety profile of nalbuphine and tramadol.", 
    "153": "1. Arterial compliance is a major determinant of left ventricular afterload. In keeping with earlier experimental data obtained in isolated arterial segments, it has recently been shown in the rat that arterial compliance decreases with an increase in heart rate (HR) induced by atrial pacing. 2. To elucidate the potential relevance of this effect in humans, we investigated nine male volunteers (age 20-30 years; mean 26 years). Systemic arterial compliance (SAC) was measured with the diastolic area method and carotid-to-femoral and femoral-to-dorsalis pedis pulse wave velocities (PWV) were measured to determine regional changes in compliance. Heart rate was first lowered with intravenous metoprolol to 56 +/- 2 b.p.m. and then increased by transoesophageal atrial pacing to 80 and 100 b.p.m. 3. Increasing HR from 56 +/- 2 to 80 b.p.m. by pacing increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 78 +/- 2 to 98 +/- 1 mmHg (P < 0.001) and then to 102 +/- 2 mmHg (P = NS). Systemic arterial compliance fell from 0.48 +/- 0.06 to 0.33 +/- 0.04 arbitrary compliance units (ACU; P < 0.01), carotid-to-femoral PWV increased from 6.1 +/- 0.3 to 6.8 +/- 0.4 m/s (P < 0.001) and femoral-to-dorsalis pedis PWV increased from 8.9 +/- 0.4 to 10.1 +/- 0.5 m/s (P < 0.001). Pacing at 100 b.p.m did not change MAP, but did lead to a further decrease in SAC (to 0.24 +/- 0.03 ACU; P < 0.05) and further increases in carotid-to-femoral (7.3 +/- 0.4 m/s; P = NS) and femoral-to-dorsalis pedis PWV (11.3 +/- 0.4 m/s; P < 0.001). 4. We conclude that systemic, central and peripheral compliances decrease in vivo with an increase in HR induced by atrial pacing.", 
    "154": "Although a great deal is known about responses to propofol, controversy remains about its mechanism of action. The present study was undertaken to investigate the direct effects of 2,6-diisopropyl phenol, disodium edetate, and its intralipid emulsion in the rat pulmonary vascular bed and to better understand the mechanisms involved in propofol-mediated responses.", 
    "155": "The effects of N omega-l-nitro-l-arginine benzyl ester (L-NABE), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, of the cyclooxygenase blocker, meclofenamate, and the K + ATP channel antagonist, U-37883A, an ATP-sensitive potassium channel antagonist, on responses to propofol, acetylcholine, nitroglycerin, and isoproterenol were investigated in the isolated blood-perfused rat lung under low tone and high steady-state tone.", 
    "156": "Propofol produced a dose-dependent decrease in pulmonary arterial perfusion pressure. L-NABE significantly reduced vasodilator responses to acetylcholine, whereas the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor had no significant effect on responses to propofol. Meclofenamate significantly reduced vasodilator responses to arachidonic acid without effecting responses to propofol. Responses to propofol were not significantly changed in the presence of U-37883A, whereas U-37883A reduced vasodilator responses to levcromakalim. Additionally, 2,6-diisopropylphenol in a pure preparation as well as an intralipid preparation similar to propofol emulsion had no significant effect while disodium edetate had a dose-dependent depressor effect under high steady-state tone.",

    "158": "A stereoselective direct liquid chromatographic method for assay of the enantiomers of the beta-adrenergic blocker acebutolol (AC) and its active metabolite, diacetolol (DC), in human serum was developed. The assay is based on extraction with ethyl acetate and separation of enantiomers on an amylose tris-(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) chiral stationary phase (Chiralpak AD) column. The method was validated and proved useful for the determination of the enantiomers in serum samples of patients suffering from hypertension and chronically treated with racemic AC. The results were compared and found similar with an indirect assay based on derivatization of the enantiomers with (+)-(S)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethyl isocyanate (NEIC).", 
    "159": "CYP2D6 mediates both alpha-hydroxylation and O-demethylation of metoprolol. In Chinese subjects, CYP2D6*1 (the wild-type) alleles are relatively uncommon. Subjects with P34S (C188-->T188) and S486T (G4268-->C4268) mutations (CYP2D6J or CYP2D6*10A) are more frequently seen. Recently, the CYP2D6*2 (CYP2D6L) genotype that results in R296C (C2938-->T2938) and S486T mutations was also found important. In this study, metoprolol pharmacokinetics was investigated in subjects of these 3 major genotypes.",

Subjects with both CYP2D6*1 and CYP2D6*2 have homozygous C188 in the exon 1, whereas subjects with CYP2D6*10A have T188. Metoprolol pharmacokinetics was compared in 16 C188 subjects (6 homozygous CYP2D6*1 subjects and 10 heterozygous CYP2D6*1/CYP2D6*2 subjects), 12 heterozygous C/T188 subjects, and 12 homozygous T188 subjects.",

Therefore data from subjects with CYP2D6*1 and CYP2D6*2 were pooled to compare with data from subjects with CTP2D6*10A. The area under plasma concentration curves (AUC) of S-metoprolol was 1411+/-116 (mean +/- SEM, n = 16), 1899+/-120 (n = 12), and 3588+/-435 (n = 12) nmol x hr/L for homozygous C188, heterozygous C/T188, and homozygous T188 subjects, respectively. The urinary recovery of all 4 alpha-hydroxymetoprolol diastereomers was significantly lower in T188 subjects than in C188 subjects.", 
    "162": "The P34S polymorphism but not the R296C polymorphism resulted in higher metoprolol plasma concentrations and lower urinary metoprolol metabolite levels in Chinese subjects.

    "163": "In line with the idea that cholecystokinin (CCK) is involved in anxiety-related behaviours, previous investigations showed that stressful conditions and an 'anxiogenic' drug, yohimbine, increased the cortical release of CCK like-material (CCKLM) in awake rats, and that this effect could be prevented by diazepam. Here, we investigated whether other anxiolytic drugs such as 5-HT1A receptor agonists could also affect cortical CCKLM release. Indeed, neither buspirone (1 mg/kg i.p.), alnespirone (1 mg/kg i.p.) nor lesopitron (3 mg/kg i.p.) affected, on their own, CCKLM release. However, pretreatment with the latter drugs completely abolished the stimulatory effect of restraint stress on the peptide outflow. As expected of the involvement of 5-HT1A receptors, tertatolol (10 mg/kg i.p) markedly reduced the inhibitory effect of buspirone on restraint stress-evoked CCKLM overflow. On the other hand, pretreatment with buspirone, alnespirone or lesopitron also inhibited the stimulatory effect of yohimbine (5 mg/kg i.p.) on cortical CCKLM outflow. These data support the idea that the anxiolytic action of 5-HT1A receptor agonists could be mediated, at least partly, through their inhibitory influence on cortical CCK-ergic systems.", 
    "164": "The connection between affect and memory is poorly understood. A possible psychopharmacological linking mechanism is the sympathetic arousal that occurs in response to threatening or emotive material. Cahill et al. (1994) reported that a single administration of 40 mg propranolol hydrochloride, a non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker, to healthy young adults significantly reduced delayed recall of emotive material, with recall of matched neutral material unaffected. This study differed importantly from the original Cahill et al. (1994) procedure in that only the emotionally arousing narrative was employed. Using the same slide presentation as Cahill et al. (1994), an experiment was carried out in order to determine whether beta-adrenergic blockade significantly reduces recall of emotive material via a central or peripheral mode of action. Thirty-six healthy young adults were recruited as subjects. Subjects were randomly allocated to three groups: (a) placebo (b) 40 mg propranolol hydrochloride (a beta blocker which readily crosses the blood brain barrier) and (c) 40 mg nadolol (a beta blocker which does not cross the blood-brain barrier). The three groups were matched for age, sex, intelligence, personality factors, and general memory functioning. Subjects viewed a series of 11 slides accompanied by a narrative, divisible into three phases. The emotionally arousing component of the narrative was introduced during phase II. Both central and peripheral beta blockade produced the expected effects on the sympathetic nervous system, as demonstrated by reliable reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In a surprise memory test 1 week later, subjects were asked to recall as much as possible of the story and slides, and also completed a forced choice recognition memory test. All three groups showed heightened recall and recognition for the central (emotive) section of the story. There was no differential effect of beta blockade (either central or peripheral) relative to placebo. Beta blockade markedly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure, but resulted in no significant effect on memory for both emotional and neutral material.",

Two h after single oral administration PR (50 mg/kg) did not change HB sleeping time, while NF (50 mg/kg) and DL (30 mg/kg) prolonged it by 171.2 and 99.6%, respectively. Coadmistration of PR with DL or with NF significantly prolonged HB sleep by 240.7 and 129%, respectively. Only NF increased aniline 4-hidroxylase (AH) activity (by 92%) and the total P-450 content (by 24%). PR and NF increased cytochrome b5 content and this effect was also observed with the combinations PR + NF (by 109%) and PR + DL (by 102%). The NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase activity was significantly decreased by NF and DL and after their combination with PR. The ethymorphine-N-demethylase (EMND) and amidopyrine-N-demethylase (APND) activities were not changed. The effects of PR, NF and DL administrated alone or in combination on liver oxidative metabolism are considered as possible mechanisms of drug interactions.",
