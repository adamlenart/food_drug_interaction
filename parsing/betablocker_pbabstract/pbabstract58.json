The purpose of this study was to test a novel method for stimulating BAT thermogenesis in rats. Application of electrical field stimulation to the dorsal surface of interscapular BAT caused a substantial rise in tissue temperature without affecting rectal temperature. The electrical stimulation failed to raise BAT temperature on the 2nd day after surgical sympathetic denervation. This is unlikely to be due to loss of thermogenic capacity, since neither UCP1 contents nor norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis were diminished 2 days after the denervation. A pharmacological experiment revealed that the BAT thermogenesis induced after electrical stimulation is mediated through \u03b2-adrenoceptors. The present study demonstrates that electrical stimulation applied to the dorsal surface of BAT is able to activate thermogenesis of BAT through mediation of norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves. Our findings may provide a basis for developing a novel therapeutic procedure for obesity and related disorders.",

Saikosaponin D (SSD) is a major component of saikosaponins isolated from Bupleurum falactum, a herb that has been linked to hepatotoxicity. Our current study was to examine the toxic effect of SSD on human hepatocyte LO2 cells and explore the possible mechanism. The results demonstrated that SSD reduced cell viability and led to dramatic morphological alterations in LO2 cells. Hoechst staining and flow cytometry analyses showed that SSD stimulated hepatocyte apoptosis. SSD-treated cells exhibited apparent nuclear condensation and fragmentation, and the apoptotic cells were increased by SSD dose-dependently. Subsequent experiments showed that SSD decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and downregulated Bcl-2 but upregulated Bax. Moreover, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were activated in SSD-treated LO2 cells. These data consistently indicated that SSD stimulated mitochondrial apoptosis in hepatocytes. Mechanistic investigations showed that SSD disrupted p38 signaling and that p38 specific inhibitor SB203580 mimicked the pro-apoptotic effect of SSD. In addition, platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b2 receptor (PDGF-\u03b2R) blocker imatinib reduced p38 phosphorylation and also mimicked the pro-apoptotic effect of SSD in LO2 cells. These data collectively indicated that SSD induced apoptosis by interrupting PDGF-\u03b2R/p38 pathway in LO2 hepatocytes.", 
    "46": "In addition to its role in regulation of salt transport in the kidney, the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone plays an independent role as a mediator of kidney injury and progression of chronic kidney disease. Studies in both animal models and patients have shown that aldosterone enhances the accumulation of extracellular matrix and progression of fibrosis in the kidney. However, the cellular mechanisms that lead to aldosterone-dependent fibrogenesis are poorly understood. In this study we find that aldosterone stimulates fibronectin synthesis through mineralocorticoid receptor (MCR) dependent activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and subsequent phosphorylation of the AP1 transcription factor c-jun, which forms a nuclear complex with the mineralocorticoid receptor in a kidney fibroblast cell line (NRK 49f). Furthermore, MCR-independent phosphorylation of Src family kinase induces IgF1 receptor phosphorylation, which leads to stimulation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) to enhanced fibronectin synthesis. We further find that the IgF1-R-dependent signaling pathway activates fibronectin expression faster than the MCR-dependent pathway. We propose that the mechanisms described in this study are important to aldosterone-dependent progression of interstitial fibrosis in the kidney. Due to the duality of aldosterone-dependent activation of fibronectin synthesis in kidney fibroblasts, MCR-specific inhibitors may not entirely prevent the progression of fibrosis by aldosterone in the kidney.",

This study sought to investigate the role of endogenous neurokinin and its relationship with \u03b21-adrenergic mechanism in the infarction induced arrhythmias. In 60min of MI in rats, the contents of substance P (SP), a native agonist of neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1-R), norepinephrine (NE), NK1-R and \u03b21-adrenergic receptor in the myocardium at risk of ischemia were examined and the ventricular arrhythmias were analyzed. The effects of pretreatment with D-SP (152ng/kg), a specific antagonist of NK1-R, esmolol (10mg/kg), a specific blocker of \u03b21-adrenergic receptor, and a combination of the two blockers were studied. The results showed that the overlaps of up-regulation of NE, SP and the increase of ventricular arrhythmias were observed. D-SP exacerbated the episodes and duration of VT & VF by 54% and 104%, respectively (all P<0.05). Esmolol inhibited the morbidity rate, the episodes and the duration of VT & VF by 66%, 92% and 95%, respectively. Surprisingly, esmolol significantly attenuated the arrhythmogenic effect of D-SP throughout the MI, beyond the time span of esmolol action, during which a significant up-regulation of the NK1-R (by 19%, P<0.05) was detected. In conclusion, the findings of this study may indicate an anti-arrhythmic effect of endogenous neurokinin mechanism, through the activation of which, via up-regulation of NK1 receptor, esmolol may exert its anti-arrhythmic action at the early time of acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "48": "Nuclear lamins form the lamina on the interior of the nuclear envelope, and are involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including DNA replication and chromatin organization. Despite this evidence, little is known about potential alterations in nuclear metabolism, specifically lamin structure and integrity in isolated \u03b2-cells subjected to stress conditions, including chronic exposure to hyperglycemia (i.e., glucotoxicity). Herein, we investigated effects of glucotoxic conditions on the catalytic activation of caspase 3 and the associated degradation of one of its substrate proteins, namely lamin-B. We report that incubation of insulin-secreting INS-1 832/13 cells, normal rat islets or human islets under glucotoxic conditions (20 mM; 12-48 h) results in the degradation of native lamin B leading to accumulation of the degraded products in non-relevant cellular compartments, including cytosol. Moreover, the effects of high glucose on caspase 3 activation and lamin B degradation were mimicked by thapsigargin, a known inducer of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). Nifedipine, a known blocker of calcium channel activation, inhibited high glucose-induced caspase 3 activation and lamin B degradation in these cells. 4-Phenyl butyric acid, a known inhibitor of ER stress, markedly attenuated glucose-induced CHOP expression (ER stress marker), caspase 3 activation and lamin B degradation. We conclude that glucotoxic conditions promote caspase 3 activation and lamin B degradation, which may, in part, be due to increased ER stress under these conditions. We also provide further evidence to support beneficial effects of calcium channel blockers against metabolic dysfunction of the islet \u03b2-cell induced by hyperglycemic conditions.",

His aortic valve is tricuspid. He is non-Marfanoid and asymptomatic. He realizes that he does not yet meet guideline criteria for aortic surgery, but he is also cognizant of the fact that he is approaching the cut-off for surgical intervention. He wishes to minimize his future risk of aortic rupture, dissection and aortic expansion and seeks your input. Should 'medical treatment' should be employed at this stage? Is there sufficient basis to initiate any form of pharmacotherapy? Would you start a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, an angiotensin receptor blocker, a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (doxycycline), or a statin to reduce his aortic risk for rupture, dissection or need for surgical repair? Does your clinical decision match evidence from existing data? Our paper will address these issues among other questions relevant to the role of medical therapy for thoracic aortic disease.",

We therefore studied our center's experience with CRT in dialysis-dependent patients. We constructed a descriptive assessment of these patients (n = 15) and performed a case-control analysis matching for age, gender, bundle branch morphology, diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy origin, and \u03b2-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker use. Baseline and 6-month echocardiograms were assessed for evidence of reverse remodeling. No periprocedural or long-term complications were observed among dialysis patients. Heterogenous improvement in ejection fraction (+3.1 \u00b1 9.2%) was noted and 2 patients derived absolute improvements of 8% and 22%, respectively. Dialysis patients demonstrated the following 3-year event rates: HF hospitalization, 31%; all-cause hospitalization, 100%; mortality, 73%; and HF hospitalization or death, 82%. In the case-control analysis, controls demonstrated superior reverse remodeling (+9.2 \u00b1 9.5% increase in ejection fraction), decreased mortality (73% vs 44%, p = 0.038), and all-cause hospitalizations (76% vs 100%, p = 0.047), with no difference in HF hospitalizations (p = 0.39), compared with dialysis patients. In conclusion, at our center, the dialysis-dependent patients with HF who underwent CRT implantation did so safely and no serious complications were observed. Certain dialysis patients demonstrated compelling improvement after device implantation.

Herein we report a 37-year-old woman who suffered from palpitation. Her chest X-ray showed a mass lesion at the left hilum, and chest computed tomography scan yielded a suspicion of pericardial cyst. Thereafter, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was performed, and thymic cyst was diagnosed during the operation. However, subsequent pathological studies confirmed a diagnosis of mature cystic teratoma. A thyroid function test demonstrating hyperthyroidism was completed prior to the patient's operation, and thyroid storm was diagnosed by clinical presentation. The patient's symptoms did not improve after the operation until we added beta blocker and anti-thyroid agents. Therefore, was the presence of thyroid storm and anterior mediastinal teratoma coincident or correlative in this case? The special stain of teratoma tissues did not reveal any thyroid tissues.

Vascular tumors include infantile and congenital hemangiomas, tufted angiomas, and kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas. Infantile hemangiomas, the most common vascular anomaly, generally have a predetermined life cycle (proliferation and subsequent involution). GLUT-1, a glucose transporter, is a marker for these specific lesions during all phases of development. Vascular malformations are classified according to their vascular tissue of origin and include capillary, venous, arteriovenous, lymphatic, and mixed malformations. Complex lymphatic malformations and complex mixed malformations, which may have most vascular components, are the most difficult vascular malformations to successfully treat. These lesions are present at birth and often expand or grow in response to trauma, infection, or hormonal changes. Imaging advancements have enabled more accurate assessments and improved management of vascular anomalies. In addition, many lesions are now being managed with targeted pharmacologic therapy. Propranolol and steroids are used for complex or disfiguring tumors, and new anti-angiogenesis inhibitors such as sirolimus are selectively used to treat lymphatic and venous lymphatic malformations that are poorly responsive to sclerotherapy, embolization, and surgical excision. Multimodal therapies are often essential for complex lesions and require the combined expertise of an interdisciplinary team.",

The results suggested that benidipine combined with a BB appeared to be less beneficial in reducing the risk of stroke compared with the benidipine-TD combination (hazard ratio (HR): 2.31, P=0.0109). We further evaluated the treatment effects on different stroke subtypes among the three benidipine-based regimens. The COPE trial was an investigator-initiated, multicenter study with PROBE design. Patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter were excluded from the study. All stroke events were subclassified with the Trial of Org 10,172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria. The total incidence of stroke was 4.7, hemorrhagic stroke was 1.6 and ischemic stroke was 2.5 per 1000 person-years. The incidence of lacunar stroke was 1.1, large-artery stroke was 0.6, cardioembolic stroke was 0.3, unknown ischemic type was 0.6 and transient ischemic attack was 0.6 per 1000 person-years. Although few differences in stroke subtypes were observed among the three treatment groups, multi-adjusted HRs for the incidence rates of all types of stroke, hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke were significantly higher with the benidipine-BB regimen than with the benidipine-TD regimen. The incidence of both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke in the benidipine-ARB regimen was not different compared with the other two treatment regimens.

In this study, we evaluated pharmacokinetic changes following intravenous (i.v.) and oral metoprolol in rats with diabetes mellitus induced by streptozotocin (DMIS). Metoprolol has an intermediate hepatic extraction ratio in rats (0.586-0.617), and it is assumed that the liver is exclusively responsible for metoprolol metabolism. Thus, the hepatic clearance, CL(H) (the non-renal clearance, CL(NR)) of metoprolol depends on the hepatic blood flow rate (Q(H)), the free fraction in plasma (f(p)), and in vitro hepatic intrinsic clearance, CL(int). After i.v. administration of 1.5 mg/kg metoprolol to DMIS rats, its CLNR was 40.9% faster than control animals. This could be due to a significantly faster QH because hepatic CL(int) and fp were comparable between the two groups of rats due to unchanged hepatic CYP2D activity. After oral administration of 1.5 mg/kg metoprolol to DMIS rats, gastrointestinal absorption was >99% of the oral dose for both groups, while the area under the curve (AUC) was 27.9% smaller, which could be caused by the greater hepatic metabolism seen in the i.v. study.

    "115": "Inflammation reduces pharmacological response to \u03b21-blockers by down-regulating the target receptor protein. This may contribute to the sub-optimal response to pharmacotherapy with \u03b2-blockers. Nebivolol is a third generation \u03b2-adrenoceptor (AR) blocker with high selectivity for blocking \u03b21 and \u03b23-agonistic properties. We studied whether response to nebivolol is also reduced by inflammation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Inflamed; Mycobacterium butyricum induced) and Control (healthy) were orally administered single doses of 2 mg/kg nebivolol (n=5) or 25 mg/kg propranolol (positive control, n=7-8); ECG recorded for PR and RR interval measurements; serial blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic assessment. Subsequently, the myocardial \u03b21, \u03b22 and \u03b23-AR levels were measured in homogenized hearts. For propranolol, inflammation resulted in increased concentration but reduced response and down-regulation of \u03b21- AR. The action and disposition of nebivolol were, however, unaffected by inflammation despite the reduced \u03b21-AR levels. The levels of \u03b22 and \u03b23-AR were unaffected by inflammation. The consistency of response to nebivolol despite inflammation may be due to the predominance of contribution of \u03b22 and \u03b23-AR. The lack of an inhibitory effect of inflammation on the clearance of nebivolol is suggestive of mechanisms other than an efficient hepatic metabolism for its low bioavailability. If extrapolated to human, nebivolol may be a more effective cardiovascular drug when inflammatory conditions are present.", 
    "116": "Nebivolol, a third generation \u03b2-adrenoceptor (\u03b2-AR) antagonist (\u03b2-blocker), causes vasodilation by inducing nitric oxide (NO) production. The mechanism via which nebivolol induces NO production remains unknown, resulting in the genesis of much of the controversy regarding the pharmacological action of nebivolol. Carvedilol is another \u03b2-blocker that induces NO production. A prominent pharmacological mechanism of carvedilol is biased agonism that is independent of G\u03b1s and involves G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)/\u03b2-arrestin signaling with downstream activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Due to the pharmacological similarities between nebivolol and carvedilol, we hypothesized that nebivolol is also a GRK/\u03b2-arrestin biased agonist. We tested this hypothesis utilizing mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that solely express \u03b22-ARs, and HL-1 cardiac myocytes that express \u03b21- and \u03b22-ARs and no detectable \u03b23-ARs. We confirmed previous reports that nebivolol does not significantly alter cAMP levels and thus is not a classical agonist. Moreover, in both cell types, nebivolol induced rapid internalization of \u03b2-ARs indicating that nebivolol is also not a classical \u03b2-blocker. Furthermore, nebivolol treatment resulted in a time-dependent phosphorylation of ERK that was indistinguishable from carvedilol and similar in duration, but not amplitude, to isoproterenol. Nebivolol-mediated phosphorylation of ERK was sensitive to propranolol (non-selective \u03b2-AR-blocker), AG1478 (EGFR inhibitor), indicating that the signaling emanates from \u03b2-ARs and involves the EGFR. Furthermore, in MEFs, nebivolol-mediated phosphorylation of ERK was sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of GRK2 as well as siRNA knockdown of \u03b2-arrestin 1/2. Additionally, nebivolol induced redistribution of \u03b2-arrestin 2 from a diffuse staining pattern into more intense punctate spots. We conclude that nebivolol is a \u03b22-AR, and likely \u03b21-AR, GRK/\u03b2-arrestin biased agonist, which suggests that some of the unique clinically beneficial effects of nebivolol may be due to biased agonism at \u03b21- and/or \u03b22-ARs.", 
    "117": "In the mammalian myocardium, ACh, which is the main neurotransmitter of cardiac parasympathetic postganglionic fibres, can be released via both quantal (vesicular) and non-quantal (non-vesicular) mechanisms of secretion. Non-quantal release is continuous and independent of vagus activity and exocytosis of ACh-containing vesicles. During the incubation of myocardium in the presence of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, non-quantal ACh release leads to accumulation of ACh in the myocardium and cholinergic effects, which are proportional to the intensity of non-quantal secretion. The aim of the present study was to reveal whether non-quantal release of ACh can be modulated by another major cardioregulator, noradrenaline, or whether it represents uncontrolled leakage of ACh from cholinergic fibres. Cholinergic changes of electrical activity induced by the AChE inhibitor paraoxon (5 \u00d7 10(-6) M) in isolated rat right atrial preparations were determined by means of a standard microlectrode technique and used as a measure of the intensity of non-quantal release. Noradrenaline (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) substantially suppressed, but did not abolish, effects of paraoxon via stimulation of \u03b1-adrenoceptors, because all experiments were conducted in the presence of the \u03b2-blocker propranolol (5 \u00d7 10(-6) M). A blocker of ganglionic transmission, hexamethonium bromide (10(-4) M), failed to alter the inhibitory effect of noradrenaline, indicating that only non-quantal ACh release is suppressed by this neurotransmitter. The effects of noradrenaline could be reduced by the \u03b12-antagonist yohimbine (10(-6) M). However, both the \u03b11-agonist phenylephrine (10(-6) M) and the \u03b12-agonist clonidine (10(-6) M) significantly inhibited the cholinergic effects of paraoxon, indicating the possible involvement of both \u03b1-adrenoceptor subtypes in mediation of the adrenergic inhibition of non-quantal ACh release. Thus, cardiac non-quantal ACh release can be negatively regulated by noradrenaline, providing another facet of sympathetic-parasympathetic interaction in the heart.", 
    "118": "Five estrogenic hormones (unconjugated\u2009+\u2009conjugated fractions) and 10 beta blockers were analyzed in three wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and receiving river waters in the area of Lyon, France. In the different samples, only two estrogens were quantified: estrone and estriol. Some beta blockers, such as atenolol, acebutolol, and sotalol, were almost always quantified, but others, e.g., betaxolol, nadolol, and oxprenolol were rarely quantified. Concentrations measured in river waters were in the nanogram per liter range for estrogens and between 0.3 and 210 ng/L for beta blockers depending on the substance and the distance from the WWTP outfall. The impact of the WWTP on the receiving rivers was studied and showed a clear increase in concentrations near the WWTP outfall. For estrogens, the persistence in surface waters was not evaluated given the low concentrations levels (around 1 ng/L). For beta blockers, concentrations measured downstream of the WWTP outfall were up to 16 times higher than those measured upstream. Also, the persistence of metoprolol, nadolol, and propranolol was noted even 2 km downstream of the WWTP outfall. The comparison of beta blocker fingerprints in the samples collected in effluent and in the river also showed the impact of WWTP outfall on surface waters. Finally, a tentative environmental risk evaluation was performed on 15 sites by calculating the ratio of receiving water concentrations to predicted non-effect concentrations (PNEC). For estrogens, a total PNEC of 5 ng/L was considered and these substances were not linked to any potential environmental risk (only one site showed an environmental risk ratio above 1). Unfortunately, few PNECs are available and risk evaluation was only possible for 4 of the 10 beta blockers studied: acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol, and propranolol. Only propranolol presented a ratio near or above 1, showing a possible environmental risk for 4 receiving waters out of 15.",

Volume-overload models were created on male Sprague-Dawley rats by producing an abdominal arteriovenous fistula. Confocal microscopy, quantitative real-time PCR, and western blot were performed to investigate the expression of SK channels and observe the influence of \u03b2-blocker bisoprolol on the expression of SK channels I KAS, and the effect of bisoprolol on I KAS and the sensitivity of I KAS to [Ca(2+)]i at single isolated cells were also explored using whole-cell patch clamp techniques. SK channels were remodeled in HF rats, displaying the significant increase of SK1 and SK3 channel expression. After the treatment of HF rats with bisoprolol, the expression of SK1 and SK3 channels was significantly downregulated, and bisoprolol effectively downregulated I KAS density as well as the sensitivity of I KAS to [Ca(2+)]i.

These findings demonstrate not only that an elevated HR is an epiphenomenon of CV risk status but also that an elevated HR itself should be a therapeutic target. In addition, recent epidemiologic evidence demonstrates that the in-treatment HR or HR change predicts subsequent all-cause and CV mortality, independent of the HR-lowering strategy. Characteristics of the in-treatment HR or HR change are also important as possible therapeutic guides for risk management.

Primary prevention of bleeding in patients at risk for a first bleeding episode is therefore a major goal. Medical prophylaxis consists of non-selective beta-blockers like propranolol or carvedilol. Variceal endoscopic band ligation is equally effective but procedure related morbidity is a drawback of the method. Therapy of acute bleeding is based on three strategies: vasopressor drugs like terlipressin, antibiotics and endoscopic therapy. In refractory bleeding, self-expandable stents offer an option for bridging to definite treatments like transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Treatment of bleeding from gastric varices depends on vasopressor drugs and on injection of varices with cyanoacrylate. Strategies for primary or secondary prevention are based on non-selective beta-blockers but data from large clinical trials is lacking.

Management of severe pre-eclampsia includes identification of high-risk patients, optimisation of antenatal care, early intervention and the identification and early management of complications. In the first instance, oral anti-hypertensive agents, including labetalol, nifedipine and methyldopa, should be tried. If oral anti-hypertensive agents have failed to adequately control blood pressure, intravenous anti-hypertensives should be considered. Commonly used intravenous anti-hypertensives include labetalol, hydralazine and glyceryl trinitrate. In addition to anti-hypertensive agents, close attention should be given to regular clinical examination, assessment of fluid balance, neurologic status and monitoring of other vital signs. Magnesium sulphate should be considered early to prevent seizures. Delivery of the baby is the definitive management of severe pre-eclampsia.",

Three days after ovariectomy, mice were treated intraperitoneally with nifedipine (15 mg/kg), telmisartan (5 mg/kg), enalapril (20 mg/kg), propranolol (1 mg/kg) or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg/kg) for 35 consecutive days. Uterine atrophy of all mice was confirmed to evaluate estrogen deficiency state. BMD and micro-architectural analyses were performed on tibial proximal ends by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). When OVX mice with uterine atrophy were compared with mice without atrophy, BMD decreased (P < 0.001). There were significant differences in BMD loss between different antihypertensive drugs (P = 0.005). Enalapril and propranolol increased BMD loss in mice with atrophied uteri compared with control mice. By contrast, thiazide increased BMD in mice with uterine atrophy compared with vehicle-treated mice (P = 0.048). Thiazide (P = 0.032) and telmisartan (P = 0.051) reduced bone loss and bone fraction in mice with uterine atrophy compared with the control. Thiazide affects BMD in OVX mice positively.

Recently, we have demonstrated that Ang-(1-7) peptidomimetic - AVE0991, as well as known beta-adrenolytic agent nebivolol, exert anti-atherogenic actions in mouse model of atherosclerosis - apoE-knockout mice. Here, using LC-ESI-MS ex vivo system, we tested whether prolonged treatment of apoE-knockout mice by these drugs can influence RAS in aorta of apoE-knockout mice in regard to generation of most active metabolites of Ang I-Ang II and Ang-(1-7). As compared to wild type animals there was increased generation of Ang II in aorta of apoE-knockout mice, while the formation of Ang-(1-7) did not differ between both groups. Either treatment with AVE0991 or nebivolol resulted in significant attenuation of Ang II production in aorta of apoE-knockout mice. In conclusion, for the first time we directly demonstrated that there is increase in ability of aortic tissue to generate Ang II in mouse model of atherosclerosis of apoE knockout mice, and that such effect could be efficiently attenuated either by treatment of nebivolol or Ang-(1-7) peptidomimetic - AVE0991. The exact mechanism(s) responsible for interference of both drugs with RAS require further investigation.",

Spontaneously hypertensive rats received a 10 mg/kg/day amlodipine dose and 25 mg/kg/day bisoprolol dose via an orogastric tube during three months. We performed examination of the myocardium's fragments under a scanning electron microscope. Morphometric investigation of mitochondrions we performed using special program what is named \"ORGANELLE\". Amlodipine significantly normalizes the ultrastructure of the myocardium. This antihypertensive drug prevented the signs of over-contractility of myofibrils. Amlodipine causes the fusion mitochondrions which has compensatory character on the background of good safety of mitochondrial ultrastructures. Another feature of amlodipine is a significant increase in the number of capillaries. Bisoprolol significantly reduced over-contractility of the myofibrils, but the signs of dystrophic-destructive processes in myofibrils and mitochondrions of cardiomyocytes remained. Bisoprolol improved the condition of the endothelial cells, but the activation of the functional activity of these cells has not been observed. The combined use of two antihypertensive drugs amlodipine and bisoprolol led to a better recovery of myofibrils than their separate use, whereas the effect on mitochondrions noted similar as in the group of rats received bisoprolol and that effect was worse than during amlodipine's monotherapy. Also we didn't reveal a reason to combine these drugs after analysis of the effect of the drug combination on the conditions of blood microvessels, which number was increased compared with hypertensive rats, but significantly less than when rats received only amlodipine. These essential cell-protective effects of amlodipine and bisoprolol in spontaneously hypertensive rats could be a significant additional factor in the treatment of hypertension complicated with pathological changes in the heart.", 
    "173": "The effect of lipophilicity of drug on the microneedle (MN)-mediated iontophoretic delivery across dermatomed human skin was studied. Beta blockers with similar pKa but varied log P values were selected as model drugs in this study. Iontophoresis (ITP) or MNs, when used independently, increased the transdermal flux of beta blockers as compared with passive delivery (PD). ITP across the MN-treated skin (MN + ITP) increased the permeation rate of all beta blockers as compared with PD (p < 0.001). The enhancement ratios (ER) for hydrophilic molecules (atenolol and sotalol) were 71- and 78-fold higher for ITP + MN as compared with PD. However, for lipophilic molecule such as propranolol, there was 10-fold increase in the ER as compared with PD. These observations were further substantiated by the skin retention data; an inverse relationship between the skin retention and the hydrophilicity of the drug was observed. The results in the present study point out that the lipophilicity of the molecule plays a significant role on the electrically assisted transdermal delivery of drugs across the microporated skin. Using the combination of ITP + MN, hydrophilic drugs (atenolol and sotalol) were delivered at a much higher rate as compared with lipophilic molecules (propranolol and acebutolol).",

However, nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms whereby ApoCIII hyperactivates \u03b2 cell CaV channels. We now demonstrate that ApoCIII increased CaV1 channel open probability and density. ApoCIII enhanced whole-cell Ca(2+) currents and the CaV1 channel blocker nimodipine completely abrogated this enhancement. The effect of ApoCIII was not influenced by individual inhibition of PKA, PKC, or Src. However, combined inhibition of PKA, PKC, and Src counteracted the effect of ApoCIII, similar results obtained by coinhibition of PKA and Src. Moreover, knockdown of \u03b21 integrin or scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) prevented ApoCIII from hyperactivating \u03b2 cell CaV channels.

One of the main targets for PKA modulation is the cardiac L-type Ca\u00b2\u207a channel (CaV1.2) located in the plasma membrane and along the T-tubules, which mediates Ca\u00b2\u207a entry into cardiomyocytes. \u03b2-Adrenergic receptor activation increases the Ca\u00b2\u207a current via CaV1.2 channels and is responsible for the positive ionotropic effect of adrenergic stimulation. Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanism underlying this modulation has not been fully resolved. On the contrary, initial reports of identification of key components in this modulation were later refuted using advanced model systems, especially transgenic animals. Some of the cardinal debated issues include details of specific subunits and residues in CaV1.2 phosphorylated by PKA, the nature, extent, and role of post-translational processing of CaV1.2, and the role of auxiliary proteins (such as A kinase anchoring proteins) involved in PKA regulation. In addition, the previously proposed crucial role of PKA in modulation of unstimulated Ca\u00b2\u207a current in the absence of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor stimulation and in voltage-dependent facilitation of CaV1.2 remains uncertain. Full reconstitution of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor signaling pathway in heterologous expression systems remains an unmet challenge.
