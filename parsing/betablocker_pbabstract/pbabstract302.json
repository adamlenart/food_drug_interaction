Patients were monitored in an intensive care unit and underwent 48-hour Holter monitoring to assess transient ischemia. Carvedilol as adjunctive therapy resulted in a significant reduction of median heart rate (65 vs 75 beats/min, p <0.05), mean systolic blood pressure (133 vs 130 mm Hg, p <0.05), and mean rate-pressure product (8,337 vs 10,042, p <0.05). Carvedilol reduced the ischemic burden during 48 hours of treatment by 75% (49 vs 204 minutes), including a 36% reduction of patients with ischemic episodes (p <0.05), a 66% reduction of the mean number of ischemic episodes (8 vs 24, p <0.05), and a 76% reduction in the mean duration of ischemic episodes (50 vs 205 minutes, p <0.05). Side effects occurred in 8 of 59 patients (13.6%) in the carvedilol group and in 5 of 54 patients (8.8%) given placebo. Although not significant, the early onset of maximal blood pressure reduction and the delayed effect on heart rate were closely correlated to drug-induced hypotension and bradycardia in the carvedilol group. Thus, carvedilol as an adjunctive to standardized treatment effectively reduces heart rate and blood pressure, and thus the ischemic burden in patients with unstable angina pectoris, but requires close monitoring of patients at risk for bradycardia or hypotension.", 
    "1": "Bilateral common carotid occlusion (BCO) over a period of 60 s in conscious rats produces a biphasic pressor response, consisting of an early (peak) and late (plateau) phase. In this study we investigated 1) the effects of lesions of the commissural nucleus of the solitary tract (commNTS) on the cardiovascular responses produced by BCO in conscious rats and 2) the autonomic and humoral mechanisms activated to produce the pressor response to BCO in sham- and commNTS-lesioned rats. Both the peak and plateau of the pressor response produced by BCO increased in commNTS-lesioned rats despite the impairment of chemoreflex responses induced by intravenous potassium cyanide. In sham rats sympathetic blockade with intravenous prazosin and metoprolol, but not vasopressin receptor blockade with the Manning compound, reduced both components of BCO. In commNTS-lesioned rats the sympathetic blockade or vasopressin receptor blockade reduced both components of BCO. The results showed 1) the sympathetic nervous system, but not vasopressin, is important for the pressor response to BCO during 60 s in conscious sham rats; 2) in commNTS-lesioned rats, despite chemoreflex impairment, BCO produces an increased pressor response dependent on sympathetic activity associated with vasopressin release; and 3) the increment in the pressor response to BCO in commNTS-lesioned rats seems to depend only on vasopressin secretion.", 
    "2": "Acute increases in peripheral osmolality evoke a pressor response and baroreflex-mediated bradycardia. These experiments were designed to determine if the fall in heart rate during peripheral sodium loading is 1) equivalent to bradycardia accompanying phenylephrine (PE) infusion, 2) mediated by the parasympathetic (PSNS) or sympathetic (SNS) nervous system, and 3) controlled by the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). Male rats received an intravenous infusion of isotonic saline, hypertonic saline (2.5 M NaCl), or PE for 30 min. Blood pressure increased equivalently in the hypertonic NaCl and PE groups. However, heart rate fell more in animals infused with PE. Furthermore, pretreatment with methylatropine to block the PSNS had no effect on bradycardia, whereas blocking SNS influences on cardiac function significantly attenuated the fall in heart rate during peripheral hyperosmolality. Finally, kainic acid administration in the MnPO before testing increased bradycardia observed during hypertonic saline loading. Taken together, these data suggest that acute peripheral hyperosmolality acts at the MnPO to reduce cardiac SNS withdrawal during the pressor response that reduces the associated baroreflex bradycardia.",

Our model was used to describe the effect of propranolol on blood volume and flow distribution in humans.", 
    "4": "Indocyanine green disposition was determined twice in four healthy adult men, once during a propranolol infusion that decreased cardiac output. After injection of indocyanine green, arterial blood was collected frequently for 2 minutes and less frequently thereafter. Plasma indocyanine green concentrations were measured by HPLC. The recirculatory pharmacokinetic model incorporates data from both the initial transient oscillations and the later post-mixing portions of the blood indocyanine green concentration versus time curves to characterize not only blood volume and cardiac output but also their distribution among a central blood volume and fast and slow peripheral volumes in lumped parallel circuits. Flow through the central circulation (cardiac output) is described by two parallel Erlang distribution functions generated by two linear chains of compartments in parallel.", 
    "5": "Propranolol reduced cardiac output from 10.6 to 4.1 L/min. Most of the decrease in cardiac output was at the expense of blood flow to the fast peripheral circuit, which represented nonsplanchnic circulation. Propranolol also reduced the blood volume of the fast peripheral circuit by more than half.",

    "7": "Atrial pacing is often used empirically to suppress atrial ectopy and prevent atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting.", 
    "8": "To determine whether atrial overdrive pacing reduces atrial fibrillation and atrial ectopy after coronary artery bypass grafting, 100 patients were randomized to no atrial pacing (Control) versus AAI pacing at 10 beats/min or more above the resting heart rate (Paced), started by postoperative day 1 and continued through day 4. Major end points were new atrial fibrillation and frequency of atrial ectopy during the first 4 days after coronary artery bypass grafting.", 
    "9": "Atrial fibrillation occurred by day 4 in 13 of 51 (25.5%) Paced and in 14 of 49 (28.6%) Control patients, p = 0.90. Control patients who developed atrial fibrillation had significantly more atrial ectopy than those who did not. Atrial ectopy was paradoxically more frequent in the Paced group (2,106+/-428 versus 866+/-385 per 24 hours, p = 0.0001). Loss of capture, sensing, and consistent atrial pacing occurred frequently during atrial pacing.", 
    "10": "Contrary to prevailing opinion and practice, postoperative atrial overdrive pacing significantly increases atrial ectopy and does not reduce the likelihood of atrial fibrillation.", 
    "11": "Pharmacological studies have revealed a non-beta1, beta2 or beta3 adrenergic receptor that mediates tachycardia in rat and human atria. The present studies utilized transgenic mice that lack the rodent beta3 receptor to explore, in a more definitive fashion, whether a non-beta1, beta2 or beta3 receptor can mediate atrial tachycardia. Insofar as the rat stomach fundus possesses a beta3 receptor mediating relaxation, we examined the stomach fundus from beta3 receptor knockout mice for the presence or absence of the beta3 relaxant receptor. Contractile responses to carbamylcholine were similar in potency and magnitude between mouse stomach fundus from wild type and beta3 receptor knockout animals. However, the classical beta3 receptor agonist CL316243, (10(-8)-10(-6)M) relaxed stomach fundus from wild type mice, but not from the beta3 receptor knockout animals. These data provide functional evidence for the absence of the beta3 receptor in beta3 receptor knockout animals and support the role of beta3 receptors mediating relaxation in mouse stomach fundus. Atria from mice lacking the beta3 receptor responded similarly (in potency and maximal increase in heart rate) to isoproterenol (10(-9)-10(-6)M) as atria from wild type mice. Furthermore, propranolol (3 x 10(-7) M) produced a dextral shift in the concentration response to isoproterenol in atria from both the beta3 receptor knockout and wild type mice with negative log K(B) values of 8.03 and 8.09, respectively. Thus, beta receptors mediating tachycardia to isoproterenol are intact and respond similarly in atria from both knockout and wild type mice. Furthermore, CGP12177, a prototypic 'atypical' beta receptor agonist produced tachycardia with a similar EC50 and maximal response in atria from both the wild type and beta3 receptor knockout mice. Cyanopindolol was a partial agonist relative to CGP12177 in both wild type and beta3 receptor knockout mice. Tachycardia to CGP12177 and cyanopindolol was not blocked by propranolol (3 x 10(-7) M) in atria from either group. These data provide definitive evidence that the receptor mediating tachycardia to CGP12177 and to cyanopindolol in atria from the transgenic beta3 receptor knockout mice is neither the beta1, beta2, nor beta3 adrenergic receptor.", 
    "12": "The potent, subtype-selective radioligand (+/-)-erythro-5-(1-hydroxy-2-[11C]isopropyl-aminobutyl)-8-hydroxy-car bostyril ([11C]procaterol) was synthesized and evaluated for visualization of pulmonary beta2-adrenoceptors with positron emission tomography (PET). Procaterol was labelled by reductive alkylation of the desisopropyl precursor with [11C]acetone under the influence of NaCNBH3 and acetic acid. Synthesis and HPLC purification were performed in 34 min. Specific activities ranged from 26.5-39.3 TBq (about 700-1000 Ci)/mmol and the radiochemical yield was 2.4-8.6% (corrected for decay). Biodistribution studies were performed in male Wistar rats which were either untreated or predosed with (D,L)-propranolol hydrochloride (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, 2.5 mg/kg), ICI 118551 (beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist, 0.15 mg/kg), CGP 20712A (beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist, 0.15 mg/kg) or isoprenaline (beta1-adrenoceptor agonist, 15 mg/kg). Specific binding was observed in lungs, spleen and red blood cells, tissues known to contain beta2-adrenoceptors. Pulmonary binding was blocked by propranolol, ICI 118551 and isoprenaline, but not by CGP 20712A. This binding pattern is consistent with the beta2 selectivity of the radioligand. The clearance of [11C]procaterol was biphasic, with a rapid distribution phase (t1/2 0.17 min) representing 90% of the injected dose followed by an elimination phase (t1/2 18.1 min). About 45% of the plasma radioactivity was unmetabolized procaterol at 15 min postinjection. In a dynamic PET-study, the lungs of untreated control rats could barely be detected and total/non-specific binding ratios rose to only 1.2 at 20 min postinjection. Although labelling and administration of (-) erythroprocaterol, the most active of 4 stereoisomers, may produce better results, [11C]procaterol seems unsuitable for beta-adrenoceptor imaging.", 
    "13": "The effects of JTV-506 ((-)-(3S,4R)-2,2-bis(methoxymethyl)-4-[(1,6-dihydro-1-methyl-6-oxo-3- pyridazinyl)amino]-3-hydroxychroman-6-carbonitrile hemihydrate, CAS 170148-29-5), a novel coronary vasodilator, on blood pressure were evaluated in conscious dogs and rats. In conscious dogs, JTV-506 (0.01-1 mg/kg p.o.), levcromakalim (0.01-1 mg/kg p.o.) and nifedipine (3-30 mg/kg p.o.) elicited an increase in double product, whereas nicorandil (1-10 mg/kg p.o.) did not affect the double product. The JTV-506-induced increase in double product was abolished by a beta-blocker, propranolol, suggesting that this increase in double product may be due to augumentation of heart rate by sympathetic nerves which mediate the baroreflex. The doses at which JTV-506 increased coronary blood flow in a previous study were lower than the doses required to increase the double product. JTV-506 did not have a crucial influence on electrocardiogram. In conscious rats, orally administered JTV-506, levcromakalim, nicorandil and nifedipine reduced blood pressure and increased heart rate dose dependently. These effects were more remarkable in hypertensive rats than in normotensive rats. JTV-506, a new potassium channel opener, seems to be relatively free of any hemodynamic effects.", 
    "14": "A topochemical model to explain the biological activity of dendrotoxin-I (DTX-I), a potent blocker for potassium channels, was developed by searching common spatial arrangements of functionally important residues between DTX-I, alpha-dendrotoxin, dendrotoxin-K, BgK, ShK, and charybdotoxin. The first three are structurally and functionally related to one another, and specifically target to Kv1 type potassium channels. The last three are structurally unrelated to the first three but have the ability to displace (125)I-labeled dendrotoxins on the same types of potassium channels. In order to obtain the correct electronic surface potential, thought to be crucial for the DTX-I function, we determined the three-dimensional solution structure of DTX-I by nmr spectroscopy using its correct amino acid sequence recently determined by our group. The most interesting characteristic of our model is that DTX-I has two binding sites to potassium channels: one is the cationic domain made up of Lys residues at positions 5 in the 3(10)-helix, 28 and 29 in the beta-turn, and the other is the Lys19/Tyr17/Trp37 triad located in the antiprotease domain. The cationic domain and the triad are located at the opposite sides of the molecular structure and are separated by about 25 A between Lys29 Calpha and Tyr17 Calpha. The functional triad is characterized by three distances, d(1) approximately 7.5 A (Lys19 Calpha-the center of the Tyr17 aromatic ring), d(2) approximately 8.1 A (Lys19 Calpha-the center of the 6-membered ring of the Trp37 indole group), and d(3) approximately 7. 3 A (the center of the Tyr17 aromatic ring-the center of the 6-membered ring of the Trp37 indole group). This model should aid in the pharmaceutical design of peptide and nonpeptide drugs with potassium channel blocking potencies, as well as in understanding of the physiology, pharmacology, biochemistry, and structure-function analysis of potassium channels.",

    "16": "In 18 patients, heart rate (HR), mean arterial (MAP), central venous (CVP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), cardiac output (CO), and mixed venous oxygen saturation (Sv0(2)) were prospectively measured after induction of anaesthesia (T1), start of surgery (T2), during bypass grafting with beta-blockade (T3), and at the end of surgery (T4).", 
    "17": "Mean esmolol dose at T3 was 0.44+/-0.2mgkg(-1)min(-1). HR was unchanged, whereas significant decreases in mean CO (3.1+/-0. 8 vs 4.8+/-1.0lmin(-1)m(-2), pre-esmolol), MAP (53+/-10 vs 89+/-14mmHg), and SvO(2) (65+/-10 vs 81+/-4%) were observed during esmolol administration. All haemodynamic parameters normalized immediately after termination of esmolol (T4).", 
    "18": "Despite unchanged HR esmolol reduced CO and MAP suggesting a favorable reduction of myocardial oxygen consumption. Mean Sv0(2) during esmolol administration reflects an acceptable ratio of whole-body oxygen delivery and consumption.

    "19": "A mathematical simulation is presented which describes the in vitro drug delivery kinetics from hydrophilic adhesive water-soluble poly-N-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-polyethylene glycol (PEG) matrices of transdermal therapeutic systems (TTS) across skin-imitating hydrophobic Carbosil membranes. Propranolol is employed as the test drug. The contributions of the following physicochemical determinants to drug delivery rate control have been estimated: the drug diffusion coefficients both in the matrix and the membrane; the membrane-matrix drug partition coefficient: the drug concentration in the matrix and the membrane thickness. Drug transfer from the hydrophilic matrix across the membrane is shown to be controlled by the drug partitioning from the matrix into the membrane. The best correlation between simulation data and experimental results is obtained when the effect of membrane hydration is taken into consideration during in vitro drug release.", 
    "20": "The present study characterized beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) in a clonal cell line (C1) immortalized from cerebral cortical astroglial cells of FVB/N mice. We also determined whether the wild type Moloney murine leukemia virus (wt-MoMuLV) and one of its neuropathogenic mutants, ts1-MoMuLV, modulated the beta-AR system in these cells. We observed that C1 cells possess a functional beta-AR system coupled to cAMP accumulation and capable of normal agonist-induced regulation (desensitization). Significant increases were observed in forskolin stimulated cAMP accumulation in C1 cells infected by wt MoMuLV and by ts1-MoMuLV. In contrast, the cAMP response to beta-AR stimulated by isoproterenol was relatively spared after viral exposure.", 
    "21": "Cytosolic Ca(2+) elevations are known to be involved in triggering apoptosis in many tissues, but the effect of sustained enhancement of Ca(2+) influx on apoptosis in beta cells remains unknown. We have found that the viability of RINm5F cells is decreased dose-dependently by continuous exposure to glibenclamide at concentrations from 10(-7) to 10(-4) M, and that this effect is partially ameliorated by pretreatment with cycloheximide. Electrophoresis of the cells exposed to glibenclamide revealed ladder-like fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis, and which also is suppressed by cycloheximide pretreatment. By using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining, we detected increased DNA fragmentation in the nuclei of the cells exposed to glibenclamide, and staining with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide showed a dose-dependent increase in the number of cells with the chromatin condensation and fragmentation in their nuclei that is characteristic of apoptosis. The effects of glibenclamide on cell viability and apoptotic cell death were partially inhibited by treatment with Ca(2+) channel blocker, and by reducing the extracellular Ca(2+) concentration during glibenclamide exposure, suggesting that they may be derived from increased Ca(2+) influx. Furthermore, only the percentage of apoptotic cells, and not that of necrotic cells, increased with the increasing intracellular Ca(2+) concentration during glibenclamide exposure. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the sustained enhancement of Ca(2+) influx caused by glibenclamide exposure can induce apoptotic cell death in a pure beta cell line.", 
    "22": "Stimulation of (1-3)-beta-glucan receptors results in Ca(2+) influx through receptor-operated channels in alveolar macrophages (AMs), but the mechanism(s) regulating Ca(2+) influx is still undefined. In this study we investigated the role of protein kinase C (PKC) regulation of Ca(2+) influx in the NR8383 AM cell line using the particulate (1-3)-beta-glucan receptor agonist zymosan. PKC inhibition with calphostin C (CC) or bisindolymaleimide I (BSM) significantly reduced zymosan-induced Ca(2+) influx, whereas activation of PKC with phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or 1, 2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DOG) mimicked zymosan, inducing a concentration-dependent Ca(2+) influx. This influx was dependent on extracellular Ca(2+) and inhibited by the receptor-operated Ca(2+) channel blocker SK&F96365, indicating that zymosan and PKC activate Ca(2+) influx through a similar pathway. NR8383 AMs expressed one new PKC isoform (delta) and two atypical PKC isoforms (iota and lambda), but conventional PKC isoforms were not present. Stimulation with zymosan resulted in a translocation of PKC-delta from the cytosol to the membrane fraction. Furthermore, inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) with genistein prevented zymosan-stimulated Ca(2+) influx and PKC-delta translocation. These results suggest that PKC-delta plays a critical role in regulating (1-3)-beta-glucan receptor activated Ca(2+) influx in NR8383 AMs and PKC-delta translocation is possibly dependent on PTK activity.",

    "53": "Adrenomedullin (ADM) has been recently found to directly inhibit agonist-stimulated aldosterone secretion by dispersed zona glomerulosa (ZG) cells and to stimulate basal catecholamine release by adrenomedullary fragments. In light of the fact that catecholamines enhance aldosterone secretion acting in a paracrine manner, we have investigated whether these two effects of ADM may interact when the integrity of the adrenal gland is preserved. ADM increased basal aldosterone output by adrenal slices containing a core of adrenal medulla, and the effect was blocked by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist l-alprenolol. In contrast, ADM evoked a moderate inhibition of K(+)-stimulated aldosterone production, and the blockade was complete in the presence of l-alprenolol. The in vivo bolus injection of ADM did not affect plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) in rats under basal conditions. Conversely, when rat ZG secretory function was enhanced (by sodium restriction or infusion with angiotensin-II [ANG-II]) or depressed (by sodium loading or infusion with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril), ADM evoked a sizeable decrease or increase in PAC, respectively. The prolonged infusion with the ADM receptor antagonist ADM(22-52) caused a further enhancement of PAC in sodium-restricted or ANG-II-treated rats, and a further moderate decrease of it in sodium-loaded or captopril-administered animals. RIA showed that ADM plasma concentration did not exceed a concentration of 10(-11) M in any group of animals. Under basal conditions, ADM adrenal content was 1.2-2.0 pmol/g, which may give rise to local concentrations higher than 10(-8) M (i.e. well above the minimal effective ones in vitro). ADM adrenal concentration was markedly increased (from two-fold to three-fold) by both ZG stimulatory and suppressive treatments. Collectively, our findings suggest that in vivo 1) ADM, in addition to directly inhibit aldosterone secretion, may enhance it indirectly by eliciting catecholamine release, the two actions annulling each other under basal conditions; 2) under conditions leading to enhanced aldosterone secretion, the direct inhibitory effect of ADM prevails over the indirect stimulatory one, and the reverse occurs when aldosterone secretion is decreased; and 3) the modulatory action of ADM on the aldosterone secretion has a physiological relevance, endogenous ADM being locally synthesized in adrenals.", 
    "54": "We have examined observational data from four published studies investigating the incidence of postoperative silent myocardial ischaemia (post-SMI) for the effects of chronic intercurrent therapy with beta-adrenoceptor blockade or chronic calcium channel entry blockade. A total of 453 patients underwent ambulatory ECG monitoring before and for 2 days after non-cardiac surgery; 79 patients were receiving chronic intercurrent beta-adrenoceptor blockade and 70 calcium channel entry blockade for ischaemic heart disease or arterial hypertension. Using logistic regression analysis, we defined a model for post-SMI that included four significant terms: beta-adrenoceptor blockade; calcium channel entry blockade; arterial hypertension; and vascular surgery. Using univariate regression, there was no effect of chronic beta-adrenoceptor blocking therapy on post-SMI (odds ratio 0.94 (95% confidence intervals 0.54-1.65)), but there was a higher incidence of post-SMI in patients receiving chronic calcium channel entry blocking drugs (odds ratio 1.95 (1.15-3.32); P = 0.015). There was no interaction between beta-adrenoceptor blockade and calcium channel entry blockade for postoperative SMI (odds ratio 2.48 (0.71-8.73)), but there was an interaction between beta-adrenoceptor blockade, calcium channel entry blockade, hypertension and vascular surgery (P = 0.0201). These findings are at variance with those which have shown effects of preoperative beta-adrenoceptor blockade on the incidence of post-SMI over the first 7 days after operation, and on mortality rates to 2 yr. There are no comparable data examining the effects of chronic intercurrent calcium channel entry blockade.", 
    "55": "The genotoxicity of atenolol, a beta-blocker antihypertensive drug, both in vitro and in vivo, was cytogenetically tested for its ability to induce sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronuclei (MN) in cultured peripheral lymphocytes. Also, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a centromeric probe was performed to determine the origin of the induced MN. The in vivo study was carried out, on the one hand, on four patients under antihypertensive treatment with atenolol and, on the other hand, on four matched control individuals taking an oral dose of atenolol. The in vitro study was performed on the control individuals by adding the drug to the culture medium at a final concentration similar to the levels found in plasma. When a comparison was made, the frequency of SCE did not show significant differences in any case. A statistically significant increase in the frequency of MN was detected in patients but not in control individuals either in vitro or in vivo. FISH analysis revealed statistically significant differences between patients and control individuals without the drug with respect to the frequency of centromeric signals in MN. Taking all these observations together, our data suggest that chronic exposure to atenolol resulted mainly in the induction of chromosome loss, so an aneugenic activity could be predicted. Different sensitivity to the compound was observed among control individuals. Nevertheless, all of them responded to the presence of atenolol in the same way in both assays. Interindividual variability was also reported. The intervariability seen in patients suggested an adaptive response to the chemical after long-term therapy.", 
    "56": "To explore the pathophysiological role of leptin in obesity-related hypertension, we examined cardiovascular phenotypes of transgenic skinny mice whose elevated plasma leptin concentrations are comparable to those seen in obese subjects. We also studied genetically obese KKA(y) mice with hyperleptinemia, in which hypothalamic melanocortin system is antagonized by ectopic expression of the agouti protein. Systolic blood pressure (BP) and urinary catecholamine excretion are elevated in transgenic skinny mice relative to nontransgenic littermates. The BP elevation in transgenic skinny mice is abolished by alpha(1)-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, or ganglionic blockers at doses that do not affect BP in nontransgenic littermates. Central administration of an alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone antagonist causes a marked increase in cumulative food intake but no significant changes in BP. The obese KKA(y) mice develop BP elevation with increased urinary catecholamine excretion relative to control KK mice. After a 2-week caloric restriction, BP elevation is reversed in nontransgenic littermates with the A(y) allele, in parallel with a reduction in plasma leptin concentrations, but is sustained in transgenic mice overexpressing leptin with the A(y) allele, which remain hyperleptinemic. This study demonstrates BP elevation in transgenic skinny mice and obese KKA(y) mice that are both hyperleptinemic, thereby suggesting the pathophysiological role of leptin in some forms of obesity-related hypertension.", 
    "57": "The regulation of pyruvate kinase activity by noradrenaline was investigated in Rana balcanica red cells. Thirty minutes of noradrenaline incubation induced a significant increase in the Vo/Vmax ratio of pyruvate kinase. The S0.5 for phosphoenolpyruvate of the enzyme significantly increased in the presence of noradrenaline while the Km for ADP decreased. In response to hormonal stimulation the Na +/H+ exchange was activated as was shown by the increase in Na+ and cyclic adenosine monophosphate from the 3rd min of incubation. All these effects were specific to alpha1 and beta antagonists. High concentrations of fructose diphosphate significantly activated the enzyme in the presence of noradrenaline but not in its absence. Furthermore, the presence of noradrenaline partially released the inhibition of the enzyme by adenosine triphosphate, inorganic phosphate and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The results suggest that noradrenaline stimulates glycolysis through pyruvate kinase activation. The mechanism of stimulation may is through Na+/H+ exchange activation, cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activation.",

Papillary muscle studies revealed isoproterenol hyporesponsiveness to be unaltered by NO synthase (NOS) inhibition. Circulating NO metabolites were undetectable. In noninfarcted myocardium, although inducible NOS (iNOS) mRNA was absent, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 mRNA and protein were markedly elevated compared with sham (P<0.001), with 2-fold higher expression (P<0.025) of IL-6 compared with TNF-alpha or IL-1beta. Metoprolol administration starting 48 hours after infarction (1) attenuated (P<0.02) LV dilatation and systolic dysfunction, (2) preserved isoproterenol responsiveness (P<0.025) via NO-independent mechanisms, and (3) reduced myocardial gene expression and protein production of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta (P<0. 025) but not IL-6, which remained high.", 
    "60": "During heart failure development, adrenergic activation contributes to increased myocardial expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta but not IL-6, and one mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of beta-adrenergic blockade may involve attenuation of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta expression independent of iNOS and NO.", 
    "61": "The development process of subtotal nephrectomy-salt hypertension is still unclear. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of the interaction between vasopressin and sympathetic system in the development of this hypertension by using AVP V1 antagonist and alpha blocker phentolamine under anesthesia condition. For this purpose, we carried out about 73% subtotal nephrectomy on male Wistar rats. One group of these rats (normotensive group) was given a low-salt diet and the other group (hypertensive group) was given a high-salt diet for 4 weeks. Finally, eight groups of rats were formed according to the kind(s) of the injected drug(s): (1) normotensive and hypertensive groups injected only V1 antagonist, (2) normotensive and hypertensive groups injected only phentolamine, (3) normotensive and hypertensive groups injected first V1 antagonist and then phentolamine, (4) normotensive and hypertensive groups injected first phentolamine and then V1 antagonist. Either V1 or alpha blockage separately led to a higher reduction in the mean blood pressure (MAP) of the hypertensives than, of the normotensives (p < 0.05). The combined blockage of V1 and alpha receptors, also caused a higher decrease in the MAP of hypertensive group than, of normotensive group, not depending on the order of the injections (p < 0.01). The heart rate increase recorded as a response to the phentolamine injection in normotensive group, did not develop in hypertensive group (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to plasma electrolytes and osmolality. A positive correlation was found between systolic blood pressure and plasma osmolality in hypertensive group (r = 0.40, p < 0.05), but not in normotensive group. We conclude that the increase in V1 and alpha pressor activities contributes to the subtotal nephrectomy-saline hypertension and the augmentation of alpha pressor activity by vasopressin may participate in this contribution.", 
    "62": "Carbofuran is a nematicide used in agricultural fields throughout the world. Indiscriminate use of this pesticide poses severe detrimental effects on our ecosystem. We have shown that it induces the CYP1A (cytochrome P4501A) monooxygenase enzyme system in cultured hepatocytes from Indian catfish, Heteropneustes fossilis (Bloch). We have quantified this induction by measuring the activity of the enzyme 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), synthesized from CYP1A1 gene. The induction followed a dose-dependent relationship with carbofuran. The dose-dependent curve of EROD using carbofuran was very much similar with beta-napthoflavone, which is a known inducer of CYP1A1. Coexposure of these compounds to the culture media showed a synergistic effect on the enzyme activity. A blocker of aromatic hydrocarbon receptor, alpha-napthoflavone, blocked carbofuran-induced EROD activity in a dose-dependent manner. All these findings suggest that metabolism of carbofuran might be mediated by the CYP1A monooxygenase system through binding of the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor. We have also studied the superinduction phenomenon, which is a typical characteristic of the CYP1A gene in our system.", 
    "63": "Dyspnea is one of the symptoms of acute aflatoxicosis. Contrary to expectations, we observed that naturally occurring aflatoxins (AF) AFB(1), AFB(2), AFG(1), and AFG(2) and their major metabolites AFM(1), AFM(2), AFP(1), AFQ(1), and AFG(2a) relaxed carbachol (C) precontracted guinea pig trachea to different degrees. The efficacies but not the potencies of AFB(1), AFB(2), AFG(1), and AFG(2) were similar to that of the beta-agonist, isoprenaline, whose activity was potentiated by the AF. Their mechanism of action is not clearly understood but several mechanistic indications were obtained with AFB(1): 1) its effect was not influenced by the beta-blocker, timolol, indicating that a direct interaction with beta(2)-adrenergic receptors was not involved. 2) AFB(1) potentiated PGE(1) and PGE(2), two relaxant prostaglandins, and its activity was reduced by indomethacin. 3) The cAMP level in the guinea pig trachea relaxed by AFB(1) increased, possibly due to inhibition of phosphodiesterase; direct interaction with PG receptors; and/or interaction with A(2) adenosinic receptors, suggested by the inhibitory activity of XAC, a specific antagonist. 4) Finally, since tetrodotoxin reduced the relaxant activity of AFB(1), it is speculated that this mycotoxin could stimulate inhibitory nonadrenergic, noncholinergic nerves (i-NANC). In conclusion, the symptoms of acute aflatoxicosis do not seem to be due to a direct activity on the tracheal muscle, but rather, to the well-known pro-inflammatory activity of the aflatoxins, which are capable of releasing arachidonic acid from cell membranes.", 
    "64": "Recent studies of beta(2)-adrenergic receptor suggest that agonist-promoted receptor internalization may play an important role in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation by G protein-coupled receptors. In the present study, we explored the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) type-1 receptor (AT(1)) internalization on Ang II-induced activation of ERK using the receptor internalization blocker concanavalin A (ConA) and the carboxyl terminus-truncated receptor mutants with impaired internalization. ConA inhibited AT(1) receptor internalization without affecting ligand binding to the receptor, Ang II-induced generation of second messengers, and activation of tyrosine kinases Src and Pyk2 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). ConA blocked ERK activation evoked by Ang II and the calcium ionophore A23187. Impairment of AT(1) receptor internalization by truncating the receptor carboxyl terminus did not affect Ang II-induced ERK activation. ConA induced proteolytic cleavage of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor at carboxyl terminus and abolished Ang II-induced transactivation of the EGF receptor, which is critical for ERK activation by Ang II in VSMC. ConA also induced proteolysis of erbB-2 but not platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Thus, ConA blocks Ang II-induced ERK activation in VSMC through a distinct mechanism, the ConA-mediated proteolysis of the EGF receptor.",

    "74": "Cardiac-specific overexpression of the human beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (AR) in transgenic mice (TG4) enhances basal cardiac function due to ligand-independent spontaneous beta(2)-AR activation. However, agonist-mediated stimulation of either beta(1)-AR or beta(2)-AR fails to further enhance contractility in TG4 ventricular myocytes. Although the lack of beta(2)-AR response has been ascribed to an efficient coupling of the receptor to pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) proteins in addition to G(s), the contractile response to beta(1)-AR stimulation by norepinephrine and an alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonist prazosin is not restored by pertussis toxin treatment despite a G(i) protein elevation of 1.7-fold in TG4 hearts. Since beta-adrenergic receptor kinase, betaARK1, activity remains unaltered, the unresponsiveness of beta(1)-AR is not caused by betaARK1-mediated receptor desensitization. In contrast, pre-incubation of cells with anti-adrenergic reagents such as muscarinic receptor agonist, carbachol (10(-5)m), or a beta(2)-AR inverse agonist, ICI 118,551 (5 x 10(-7)m), to abolish spontaneous beta(2)-AR signaling, both reduce the base-line cAMP and contractility and, surprisingly, restore the beta(1)-AR contractile response. The \"rescued\" contractile response is completely reversed by a beta(1)-AR antagonist, CGP 20712A. Furthermore, these results from the transgenic animals are corroborated by in vitro acute gene manipulation in cultured wild type adult mouse ventricular myocytes. Adenovirus-directed overexpression of the human beta(2)-AR results in elevated base-line cAMP and contraction associated with a marked attenuation of beta(1)-AR response; carbachol pretreatment fully revives the diminished beta(1)-AR contractile response. Thus, we conclude that constitutive beta(2)-AR activation induces a heterologous desensitization of beta(1)-ARs independent of betaARK1 and G(i) proteins; suppression of the constitutive beta(2)-AR signaling by either a beta(2)-AR inverse agonist or stimulation of the muscarinic receptor rescues the beta(1)-ARs from desensitization, permitting agonist-induced contractile response.", 
    "75": "Wild-type or mutated human beta3-adrenergic receptor (Trp64Arg) cDNAs were stably expressed in mouse 3T3-L1 cells. Saturation binding study using a beta-adrenergic ligand revealed that there was no significant difference in the receptor density and the equilibrium dissociation constant between the two cell lines. However, the ability of the mutant beta3-adrenergic receptor to accumulate cyclic AMP (cAMP) in response to isoproterenol was much reduced and Kact for cAMP accumulation was lowered as compared to the wild type receptor. The amount of alpha subunit of stimulatory GTP-binding protein (GSalpha) and adenylyl cyclase activity in response to forskolin were not different in the two cell lines. The responses of the mutant receptor to epinephrine, norepinephrine and L-755,507, a highly specific agonist for human beta3-adrenergic receptor, were also reduced, but the reduction of Kact for L-755,507 was more evident than other agonists tested. The cAMP accumulation in response to some conventional beta3 agonists was less than 10% of that to isoproterenol even in the cells expressing the wild type receptor. These results suggest that the Trp64Arg mutant beta3-adrenergic receptor has less ability to stimulate adenylyl cyclase, and that lipolytic activity through the beta3-adrenergic receptor by catecholamines in subjects carrying this mutation might be suppressed.",

    "80": "The beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) exists in multiple polymorphic forms with different characteristics. Their relevance to heart failure (HF) physiology is unknown. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed on 232 compensated HF patients with a defined beta(2)AR genotype. Patients with the uncommon Ile164 polymorphism had a lower peak VO(2) (15.0+/-0.9 mL. kg(-1). min(-1)) than did patients with Thr164 (17.9+/-0.9 mL. kg(-1). min(-1), P<0.0001). The percentage achieved of predicted peak VO(2) was also lower in patients with Ile164 (62. 3+/-4.5% versus 71.5+/-5.1%, P=0.045). The relative risk of a patient having a VO(2) </=14 mL. kg(-1). min(-1) who had Ile164 was 8.0 (P=0.009). Catheterization-based invasive exercise testing revealed depressed changes in the exercise-induced cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, stroke volume, and VO(2) in patients with Ile164. The polymorphisms at position 16 also impacted exercise capacity: peak VO(2) for Arg16 versus Gly16 was 17.0+/-0.8 versus 15. 6+/-0.5 mL. kg(-1). min(-1), respectively (P=0.03). Because the polymorphisms at loci 16 and 27 can occur together, 4 homozygous combinations exist. Patients with Arg16/Glu27 had the highest percentage achieved of predicted peak VO(2) (75. 7+/-6.4%), whereas those with Gly16/Gln27 had the lowest (55.3+/-2. 8%, P=0.0032). The above findings were not confounded by baseline clinical characteristics, including beta-blocker usage.

    "81": "The electrical activity of neurons from the red nucleus, a mesencephalic structure involved in motor control, is under the influence of several neurotransmitters released from afferent fibers and/or from local interneurons. We have investigated the combined effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and noradrenaline (NA), both present at high levels in the red nucleus, on the firing activity of single rubral neurons recorded extracellularly in vivo on anesthetized adult rats. NA inhibited the firing activity of a large part of rubral neurons and induced excitatory or biphasic inhibitory/excitatory effects in a smaller group of cells. Neuronal firing was also inhibited by GABA in all the cells studied. When the effect of GABA was tested during continuous applications of NA, the magnitude of GABA response was modified in 58% of the cells: the effect of GABA was potentiated by NA in half of the responding neurons and was decreased in the remaining half. NA-induced potentiation of GABA response was mimicked by the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine and was abolished by the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine. On the other side, the decrease of GABA response was reproduced by the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline and was blocked by timolol, an antagonist of beta-adrenoceptors. Neuronal firing activity was reduced by nipecotic acid, an inhibitor of GABA reuptake mechanism, and was instead increased during application of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline, suggesting that rubral neurons in vivo were under tonic control by endogenous GABA. Both the inhibitory and the excitatory effects of NA were reduced in the presence of nipecotic acid and were instead potentiated during application of bicuculline, suggesting that NA responses were modified by endogenous GABA. Taken together, our results indicate a reciprocal modulation between the effects of GABA and NA on neuronal firing activity in the red nucleus of the rat: GABA depresses the responsiveness of rubral neurons to NA, whereas NA is able either to potentiate or to decrease the effects of GABA by activation of alpha(2)- and beta-adrenoceptors, respectively. The functional significance of such interaction, as well as the possible implication in diseases affecting motor control, will be discussed.", 
    "82": "In urethane anesthetized, adult male Wistar rats, noxious chemical stimulation of the mid to lower thoracic interspinous tissues, in the form of capsaicin injection, was accompanied by a pronounced increase in gastric sympathetic nerve activity and inhibition of gastric motility. Much weaker effects on gastric sympathetic nerve activity and gastric motility were observed with similar stimulation of the lower lumbar interspinous tissues. The inhibitory response of gastric motility to thoracic stimulation was preserved in spinalized animals, somewhat diminished in vagotomized animals and was abolished in most animals from which the coeliac ganglion had been extirpated. In vagotomized animals, treatment with 1 mg/kg propranolol i.v. did not cause any further attenuation of the inhibitory reflex. However, the inhibitory reflex was extinguished in vagotomized animals which received 1 mg/kg propranolol plus 10 mg/kg phentolamine i.v. These results suggest that noxious chemical stimulation of the interspinous tissues elicits a segmentally organized reflex which is mediated principally at the spinal level and which expresses itself principally, but not exclusively via sympathetic efferents traversing the coeliac ganglion. The expression of the reflex response appears to be largely dependent upon the integrity of alpha adrenergic receptors.", 
    "83": "We investigated the effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation on Na/Ca exchange in whole-cell patch-clamped guinea-pig ventricular myocytes at 37 degrees C. With ion channel and Na/K pump currents blocked, the Na/Ca exchange current (I(Na-Ca) was measured selectively as membrane current inhibited by 10 mM nickel (Ni) during a voltage ramp applied between +80 and -120 mV. Isoprenaline (1 microM) caused an increase in both inward and outward current generated by the Na/Ca exchange, which was prevented by the beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol. These data suggest that isoprenaline caused a receptor-mediated up-regulation of Na/Ca exchange activity. Mimicking beta-adrenoceptor activation, either by stimulation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin or by internal dialysis of cells with cyclic AMP (3':5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate), also increased I(Na-Ca). Using fluorescence Ca measurement, an increase of internal cAMP was shown to increase the rate of transmembrane Ca transport via the Na/Ca exchange. A selective inhibitor of protein kinase A prevented stimulation of Na/Ca exchange by isoprenaline. These data suggest that the underlying mechanism of stimulation was phosphorylation of the Na/Ca exchange protein by protein kinase A. Isoprenaline did not stimulate I(Na-Ca) when experiments were carried out at 20 degrees C, in contrast to the findings at 37 degrees C. Modulation of Na/Ca exchange by the beta-adrenergic pathway may have important physiological consequences for intracellular Ca regulation and electrical activity during hormonal stimulation, or during sympathetic nerve stimulation.", 
    "84": "The autonomic control of respiratory-related arterial pressure variability (RAPV) remains uncharacterised. We set out to test the hypothesis that the autonomic nervous system may participate in RAPV via its effect on pulse pressure (PP). Experiments were performed on adult male Sprague-Dawley rats anaesthetised with ketamine and paralysed with pancuronium under positive-pressure ventilation. Respiratory variability in each parameter was quantified by auto-spectral analysis and the relationship between variabilities in two signals assessed by cross-spectral analysis. PP and systolic pressure (SP) exhibited similar powers of respiratory variability that were far more pronounced than for diastolic pressure (DP) or mean pressure (MP). The variability in PP preceded that in SP, MP or DP. The largest phase lag occurred between PP and DP and was equivalent to the time delay of one pulse interval. Coherence between respiratory variabilities in PP and MP was nearly perfect. Propranolol dose dependently suppressed respiratory variability in each pressure parameter and eventually disrupted the PP-MP relationship in respiratory variability. However, the influence of lung volume on MP persisted with a near-zero phase lag. Combined administration of phentolamine and atropine facilitated respiratory variability in PP and SP and failed to block the effect of propranolol. However, the combined administration moved the dose/response curve of propranolol and respiratory variability in each pressure parameter to the right. We conclude that, in addition to non-autonomic mechanisms, RAPV may be facilitated by cardiac sympathetic function via the effect on PP variability. The autonomic mechanism can still be evoked during combined alpha-adrenoceptor and muscarinic blockade, possibly via baroreflex mechanisms.", 
    "85": "The changes in human red blood cell microrheology in different glutaraldehyde (3.0 and 5.0 x 10(-6) mol x l(-1)) and exaprolol (2.5 and 5.0 x 10(-4) mol x l(-1)) concentrations were studied. The method of millipore filtration was compared with the method of cation-osmotic hemolysis. Both drugs prolonged the filtration time. Cation-osmotic hemolysis in glutaraldehyde-treated cells was significantly lower in comparison with the control group. On the other hand, there was a significant increase in cation-osmotic hemolysis in exaprolol-treated cells. Besides cation-osmotic hemolysis and filterability of erythrocytes, we evaluated the medium cell volume (MCV) and the medium cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). No changes in MCV and MCHC in glutaraldehyde-treated cells were observed. However, the MCV was significantly lower and the MCHC was significantly higher in exaprolol-treated cells. In conclusion, we suggest that the method of cation-osmotic hemolysis is more sensitive than the filtration method for determination of red blood cell microrheology.",

The renal clearance (CLR) of talinolol was unchanged after co-administration of erythromycin and there was a small but statistically significant decrease in elimination half-life (t1/2). Serum pharmacokinetics correlate with the results derived from urine concentration measurement. One subject suffered from moderate diarrhea after erythromycin and was excluded from the analysis.",

Sixteen patients responded to bisoprolol therapy and 13 did not respond after 12 months of full-dose therapy. Calibrated myocardial IB intensity was lower in responders relative to nonresponders in both the interventricular septum (responders, -20.1 +/- 3.6 dB vs nonresponders, -9.8 +/- 5.1 dB, P <.0001; controls, -20.1 +/- 4.4 dB) and posterior wall (responders, -20.6 +/- 3.6 dB vs nonresponders, -14.6 +/- 4.2 dB, P =.0002; controls, -22.7 +/- 3.3 dB). Also, the lower the myocardial intensity in the interventricular septum or posterior wall, the better left ventricular systolic function improved after beta-blocker therapy. However, CV was lower in both DCM groups than in the controls, and CV in the interventricular septum was lower in nonresponders than in responders (responders, 4.0 +/- 4.1 dB vs nonresponders, -0.8 +/- 6. 1 dB, P <.02; controls, 8.3 +/- 2.4 dB). In addition, CV in the posterior wall showed no difference between the 2 DCM groups (responders, 5.6 +/- 1.3 dB vs nonresponders, 5.1 +/- 3.5 dB, P = not significant; controls, 9.6 +/- 2.5 dB). Also, the percent fibrosis on right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimens showed no distinctions between these 2 groups (responders, 25.1% +/- 16.1% vs nonresponders, 24.9% +/- 15.0%, P = not significant).",

Multivariate predictors of worse survival included older age, severe left ventricular dysfunction, lower systolic blood pressure, history of congestive heart failure, diabetes, smoking or atrial fibrillation, and preexistent pacemaker.

The measured concentration range was 100-300 ng ml-1 for all drugs except phenytoin (0.5-1.5 micrograms ml-1). Analysis was based on direct injection of methanolic solutions of drugs into the mass spectrometer with the subsequent elution with a mobile phase consisting of methanol and 1% acetic acid solution (4:1) at a flow rate 1 ml min-1. The mass spectrometer was programmed to permit detection and determination of either fragment or molecular ions of carbamazepine, phenytoin, acebutolol, atenolol, pindolol and propranolol at m/e 194.3, 252.9, 337.2, 267.1, 249.1 and 260.1, respectively. The recorded chromatograms exhibited well-resolved peaks at retention times < 1 min. The peak area was correlated linearly to the drug concentration. Intraday precision gave relative standard deviations in the range 1.75-4.02%. Compared to HPLC, the described LC-MS was faster, more sensitive and specific. Unlike HPLC, LC-MS could be applied to analyze incompletely resolved mixtures. The absolute detection limits for LC-MS and HPLC were 0.2-0.5 and 10-25 ng, respectively. Recovery studies of the investigated compounds in pharmaceutical products using LC-MS and HPLC gave mean percentages of 97.5-102.0 and 98.4-103.3, respectively. Statistical analysis of the data using t- and F-tests showed insignificant differences between both methods for the analysis of carbamazepine, phenytoin, acebutolol and atenolol in pharmaceutical formulations. However, LC-MS gave more accurate results than HPLC for determination of pindolol in tablets. Propranolol could only be determined in tablets using LC-MS.", 
    "113": "The effect of propranolol on Ca(2+) signalling in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells was investigated by using fura-2 as a Ca(2+) probe. Propranolol increased cytosolic free Ca(2+) levels ([Ca(2+)](i)) in a concentration-dependent manner between 0.1 and 1 mM. The response was partly inhibited by external Ca(2+) removal. In Ca(2+)-free medium pretreatment with 0.2 mM propranolol partly inhibited the [Ca(2+)](i) rise induced by 1 microM thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump; but pretreatment with thapsigargin abolished propranolol-induced Ca(2+) release. Addition of 3 mM Ca(2+) induced a [Ca(2+)](i) rise after pretreatment with 0.2 mM propranolol in Ca(2+)-free medium. Propranolol (0.2 mM) inhibited 25% of thapsigargin-induced capacitative Ca(2+) entry. Suppression of 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) formation by 2 microM U73122, a phospholipase C inhibitor, did not alter 0.2 mM propranolol-induced internal Ca(2+) release. Propranolol (1 mM) also increased [Ca(2+)](i) in human neutrophils. Collectively, we have found that 0.2 mM propranolol increased [Ca(2+)](i) in MDCK cells by releasing Ca(2+) from thapsigargin-sensitive Ca(2+) stores in an IP(3)-independent manner, followed by Ca(2+) influx from external space. Independently, propranolol was able to inhibit thapsigargin-induced capacitative Ca(2+) entry.", 
    "114": "Administration of ephedrine prior to rocuronium decreases the onset time of neuromuscular blockade from rocuronium by 26%. This effect was attributed to a increased cardiac output. If so, beta adrenergic-blocking drugs, which decrease cardiac output, should prolong the onset time of rocuronium. In a double-blind study, 60 patients were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 20) to receive either 70 microg. kg(-1) of ephedrine, 0.5 mg. kg(-1) esmolol or placebo, 30 s before induction of anesthesia. Onset time of rocuronium was defined as the time from the end of its injection to disappearance of all four twitches of the train-of-four. The onset time of rocuronium was significantly shorter after ephedrine (22%) and longer after esmolol (26%), as compared to placebo. No differences were observed among the three groups with regard to heart rate, systolic, diastolic or mean blood pressure. We concluded that a dose of 0.5 mg. kg(-1) of esmolol significantly prolongs the onset time of rocuronium with minimal hemodynamic changes.", 
    "115": "Corticosteroids enhance beta-adrenergic responses by actions at both beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) and post-beta-AR sites. The present study investigated the effects of dexamethasone on beta-AR density, high-affinity beta-agonist binding, G(s)alpha and G(i)alpha protein expression, and cAMP responses in bovine tracheal smooth muscle (bTSM). Dexamethasone treatment of cultured bTSM cells increased total beta-AR density 1.6- to 1.9-fold as assessed by the saturation binding of [(3)H]CGP-12177 and by displacement of radioligand binding with isoproterenol. Isoproterenol bound to the beta-AR at two sites, a high-affinity site with a density of 5.9 +/- 1.2 fmol/mg protein and a low-affinity site with a density of 16.9 +/- 1. 0 fmol/mg protein. Dexamethasone increased both high- and low-affinity isoproterenol binding sites to 11.1 +/- 2.2 and 25.9 +/- 2.1 fmol/mg protein, respectively, without influencing agonist binding affinities. Dexamethasone also selectively increased G(s)alpha protein levels from 0.99 +/- 0.14 to 1.46 +/- 0.17 microg/mg protein without affecting G(i)alpha levels. The net effect of these changes was a 1.8-fold increase in maximal isoproterenol-induced cAMP generation in dexamethasone-treated bTSM cells. These findings provide new insights into the corticosteroid regulation of beta-adrenergic signaling pathways in airway smooth muscle.", 
    "116": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the contribution of bradykinin (BK) B(1) and B(2) receptors in a model of type III hypersensitivity, the reverse passive Arthus reaction (RPA), in wild-type mice and transgenic B(2) knockout littermates. BK (10 microg mouse(-1)) or bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg mouse(-1)) induced a sustained Evans blue extravasation for more than 80 min in naive or rabbit anti-bovine serum albumin-treated mice (RPA model), respectively. The response to the two stimuli was prevented by the B(2) receptor antagonist, HOE-140, but not by [Leu(8)]desArg(9)-BK (B(1) receptor antagonist). In contrast to the wild-type littermates, RPA and bradykinin were unable to trigger an increase in plasma extravasation in B(2) knockout mice. Furthermore, endothelin-1 (5 microg mouse(-1)) and a selective NK-1 receptor agonist [Sar(9),Met (O(2))(11)]-SP (20 microg mouse(-1)), triggered a significant increase in peritoneal plasma extravasation in both wild-type and B(2) knockout animals. A pretreatment with indomethacin (200 microg mouse(-1)) significantly reduced the RPA-induced but not the BK-induced increase in Evans blue extravasation. Furthermore, RPA, but not BK, triggered a significant indomethacin-sensitive increase in peritoneal prostaglandin E(2) content. Our results suggest a pivotal role for B(2) receptors in the mechanism of plasma extravasation which occurs during the reverse passive Arthus reaction in the mouse. Moreover, our results suggest an important contribution of prostanoids in the plasma leakage mechanisms triggered by RPA but not by bradykinin.", 
    "117": "In the search for more potent but still short-acting beta-blockers (BB), the methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl, cyclohexyl, 2-(1-adamantyl)ethyl, and methylthiomethyl esters of the acidic inactive metabolite of bufuralol were synthesized based on the \"inactive metabolite\" approach. The cleavage of the ester bond by blood and tissue esterases rapidly deactivates these compounds, resulting in an ultrashort duration of action. The beta-antagonist potencies and time courses of actions of the new \"soft\" BBs were characterized by recording ECG and intra-arterial blood pressure (BP) in rats. In the isoproterenol-induced tachycardia model, while bufuralol at an iv dose of 1 mg/kg (3.8 micromol/kg) diminished heart rate (HR) for at least 2 h, the effects of the soft drugs lasted for only 10-30 min at equimolar dose. The inactive metabolite did not decrease HR significantly. The first four members of this series of compounds showed the highest beta-blocking potencies, ranging between 25% and 50% of that of bufuralol. Next, the effects of these most active compounds on resting HR and BP were evaluated in comparison to esmolol. Infused for 10 min at a rate of 20 micromol/kg/min, esmolol decreased HR and mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 40% and 60%, respectively. The soft drugs at doses ranging only between 2 and 4 micromol/kg/min resulted in a 20-40% decrease in HR and a 30-50% reduction in MAP. However, the time courses of both the bradycardic and hypotensive effects of the soft drugs were superimposable to that of esmolol, diminishing within 60 min after the discontinuation of the infusions.", 
    "118": "The effects of selective and non-selective beta-adrenergic agents on cutaneous water evaporation (CWE) were studied in hand-reared rock pigeons (Columba livia). CWE was measured by the vapor diffusive resistance method, using a transient porometer. Intramuscular and subcutaneous injections of a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist (propranolol) or a selective beta(2)-adrenergic antagonist (ICI-118551) to heat-acclimated (HAc) pigeons at ambient temperature (T(a)) of 24 degrees C resulted in intensive CWE. The CWE values that were triggered by propranolol and ICI-118551 (18.59+/-0.73 and 16.48+/-0.70 mg cm(-2) h(-1), respectively) were close to those induced by heat exposure (17.62+/-1.40 mg cm(-2) h(-1)). Subcutaneous administration of propranolol produced local response. Intramuscular injection of salbutamol (selective beta(2)-adrenergic agonist) to HAc pigeons drastically diminished CWE induced by either propranolol, metoprolol or heat exposure. Such manipulations also enhanced panting at relatively low T(a)s (42 degrees C). The inhibition of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors by metoprolol increased CWE, while inhibition by atenolol produced no change from basal values. This difference may be attributed to their distinctive nature in penetrating the blood-brain barrier. Our findings indicate a regulatory pathway for CWE consisting of both beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. We suggest that the beta(1)-adrenergic effect is restricted mainly to the CNS, while the beta(2)-adrenergic effect takes place at the effector level. We postulate this level to be either the cutaneous microvasculature or the epidermal layer.", 
    "119": "Direct enantioselective separation on chiral stationary phases and indirect separation based on the formation of diastereomeric derivatives were developed and compared for the HPLC analysis of R(+) and S(-)-metoprolol in human plasma. Plasma samples prepared using solid-phase extraction columns or liquid-liquid extraction were directly analyzed on a Chiralpack AD or on a Chiralcel OD-H columns, respectively. S-(-)-menthyl choroformate was also used to yield diastereomeric derivatives resolved on a RP-8 column. The methods were employed to determine plasma concentrations of metoprolol enantiomers in a pharmacokinetic study of single dose administration of racemic metoprolol to a healthy Caucasian volunteer phenotyped as extensive metabolizer of debrisoquine. The correlation coefficients among enantioselective metoprolol plasma concentrations (5-223 ng/ml) obtained by the three methods were equal or higher than 0.99. The direct method that employed the chiral column Chiralpak AD may be considered the most sensitive, although the three methods demonstrated interchangeable use in the pharmacokinetic investigation.",

We therefore developed a new method using the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist carazolol. We administered a bolus injection of 1 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mg/kg/h in adult German 'Landrasse' pigs. Blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output and maximum left ventricular pressure rise time showed a significant (P < 0.05) reduction of the control value varying between 40% and 59%.

However adenosine is expensive and injectable verapamil currently is scarcely available. While intravenous diltiazem has been shown to be useful for terminating PSVT, the efficacy of esmolol in this regard has not been evaluated previously. Hence these latter two drugs were studied for their efficacy in terminating PSVT.", 
    "122": "A prospective, randomised, crossover study was undertaken in patients presenting with hemodynamically tolerated PSVT to the ICCU. While 50 patients had been planned for the trial, the study had to be prematurely terminated after 32 patients had been enrolled due to the marked superiority of diltiazem. Two sequential doses with a 5 minute interval of either drug were administered before crossover. Diltiazem was given in a dose of 0.25 mg/kg while the esmolol dose was 0.5 mg/kg.", 
    "123": "Diltiazem terminated PSVT in all the 16 patients in whom it was given as the first drug. The 12 patients who did not respond to esmolol were also effectively treated with diltiazem. Thus totally 28/28 patients responded to diltiazem while only 4/16 patients responded to esmolol (p < 0.001). Of the 28 patients who responded to diltiazem, in 13 patients the second bolus of diltiazem worked after the first one had failed. No significant adverse effects were seen.", 
    "124": "Intravenous diltiazem is highly effective and safe for terminating PSVT. When the first bolus is ineffective, the second bolus given after 5 minutes usually succeeds. Esmolol in the dose of 0.5 mg/kg has poor efficacy for terminating PSVT, even when 2 boluses are administered.", 
    "125": "For some time the medical treatment of glaucoma has consisted of topical beta-blockers, adrenergic agents, miotics and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs). However, the therapeutic arsenal available for the medical treatment of glaucoma has recently extended with new classes of ocular hypotensive agents i.e. prostaglandins, local CAIs and alpha2-adrenergic agents. Beta-blockers are still the mainstay in glaucoma treatment and are first line drugs. However, even if they are applied once daily, as with timolol in gel forming solution and levobunolol, the possible cardiopulmonary adverse effects of beta-blockers remain a cause for concern. When monotherapy with beta-blockers is ineffective in reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) or is hampered by adverse effects, a change of monotherapy to prostaglandins, local CAIs, alpha2-adrenergic agonists (brimonidine) or to dipivalyl epinephrine is advised. Prostaglandins, local CAIs and alpha2-adrenergic agonists, such as brimonidine, may in time become first line drugs because they reduce IOP effectively and until now systemic adverse effects have rarely been reported with these agents. The development of a pro-drug of either a local CAI or an alpha2-adrenergic agonist with a sustained and continuous effect on IOP level, which could be applied once a day is suggested. Because of these new developments, miotics, i.e. pilocarpine and carbachol, are recommended as second or third line drugs. The cholinesterase inhibitors are considered third line drugs as better agents with fewer local and systemic adverse effects have become available. Oral CAIs may be used temporarily in patients with elevated IOPs e.g. postsurgery or post-laser, or continuously in patients with glaucoma resistant to other treatment. Combining ocular hypotensive drugs is indicated when the target pressure for an individual patient cannot be reached with monotherapy. Combination therapy of beta-blockers is additive with prostaglandins, topical CAIs and miotics. Prostaglandins such as latanoprost can be combined with beta-blockers, adrenergic agents, local CAIs and miotics. Combinations with brimonidine or local CAIs need further investigation. Treatment of glaucoma with the new ocular hypotensive agents, either in monotherapy or combination therapy, may provide lower IOPs and delay or postpone the need for surgery.",

    "131": "RAW 264.7 macrophage arginase activity was measured in vitro in response to 4 catecholamines with or without propranolol or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). C57BL/6 mice underwent laparotomy as a model of moderate trauma after propranolol treatment, with and without intraperitoneal Escherichia coli LPS administration as a simulated pro-inflammatory stimulus.", 
    "132": "Macrophage arginase activity increased in vitro in response to catecholamines or LPS (P < .05). Propranolol pretreatment blocked macrophage arginase activity induced by epinephrine (10 mumol/L) in vitro (P < .05). Trauma or LPS alone increased splenic arginase activity in vivo (P < .05). Propranolol did not alter LPS-induced splenic arginase activity but did significantly reduce trauma-induced splenic arginase activity (P < .05).", 
    "133": "Catecholamines alone increase macrophage arginase activity through beta-adrenoceptor activation. Increased splenic arginase activity induced by moderate trauma is decreased by beta-adrenoceptor blockade, suggesting that trauma-induced arginase activity is partly mediated by endogenous catecholamines.", 
    "134": "An autoradiographic method for labelling beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors using [3H]CGP 12177 as a radioligand is described as well as the procedure for an autoradiographic saturation kinetic study. The method afforded higher quality autoradiographs as well as an improvement in the tissue preservation when assayed in birds and chick embryos. The results confirmed the K(d) values previously reported for membrane homogenate binding. The use of different radioligands to characterise beta-adrenoceptors, the higher B(max) values found with autoradiography than those obtained by the membrane homogenate binding method and the typical errors in quantifying autoradiography are discussed. It is concluded that the method described here considerably improves autoradiographic beta-adrenergic characterisation.", 
    "135": "We recently demonstrated that alpha(v)beta(3) integrins are involved in the mechanisms of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced DNA synthesis and collagen gel contractions in rat cardiac fibroblasts (CFBs), cellular mechanisms that are relevant for cardiac remodeling. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the effect of Ang II and other growth factors on the regulation of the alpha(v)beta(3) integrins in fibroblasts from neonatal rat hearts. The alpha(v)beta(3) integrin receptor expression was significantly increased (P<0.05) at the mRNA level after treatment with Ang II, transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) for 8 and 16 hours. The surface expression of the alpha(v) and beta(3) integrin subunits was elevated after 32 and 48 hours (P<0.05) as determined with flow cytometry. To investigate fibroblast motility, we performed chemotaxis experiments with transwell chambers. Ang II was chemotactic for CFBs, as tested with checkerboard experiments. The chemotactic effect was concentration dependent and was completely blocked by Ang II type 1 receptor blockers but not by Ang II type 2 receptor blocker PD 123319. Ang II- and PDGF-BB-mediated chemotaxis could be significantly inhibited by RGD peptides and the blocking antibodies against alpha(v)beta(3) integrin (both P<0.01). Adhesion of CFBs to vitronectin was partially inhibited by an antibody to alpha(v)beta(3) integrin but was mainly mediated by an alpha(v)beta(5) integrin. Relevant in vivo expression of alpha(v)beta(3) integrin by CFBs was confirmed with in situ hybridization with probes for alpha(v) and beta(3) mRNA in rat hearts. The present study demonstrates that the expression of alpha(v)beta(3) integrin is augmented by Ang II, PDGF, and TGF-beta(1) in neonatal CFBs. Furthermore, this integrin is involved in the chemotaxis, motility, and adhesion of CFBs. The present findings support the current concept that integrins participate in the control of fibroblast behavior during cardiac remodeling mechanisms.", 
    "136": "Preconditioning the heart by brief coronary (CAO) or mesenteric artery occlusion (MAO) can protect against damage during subsequent prolonged CAO and reperfusion. The role of bradykinin (BK) in remote cardiac preconditioning by MAO is investigated by antagonizing the BK B(2) receptor [Hoechst 140 (HOE-140)] or simulating local BK release by mesenteric intra-arterial infusion. Anesthetized male Wistar rats (n = 6-8) were treated with HOE-140 or saline before starting the preconditioning protocol, CAO, MAO, or non-preconditioned control. Infarct size related to risk area [ratio of infarct area to area at risk (IA/AR)] was determined after 3 h of reperfusion following a 60-min CAO. IA/AR was 62 +/- 5% in controls and not affected by HOE-140 (58 +/- 6%). CAO as well as MAO significantly protected the heart (IA/AR, 37 +/- 3 and 35 +/- 5%), which was prevented by HOE-140 (IA/AR, 71 +/- 6 and 65 +/- 7%, respectively). Brief intramesenteric BK infusion mimicked MAO (IA/AR, 26 +/- 3%). Pretreatment with hexamethonium could abolish this protection (IA/AR, 67 +/- 4%). These data indicate an important role for BK in remote preconditioning by MAO. Results support the hypothesis that remote preconditioning acts through sensory nerve stimulation in the ischemic organ.", 
    "137": "The purpose of this study was to investigate, in an anesthetized pig model of low-flow myocardial ischemia, the electrophysiologic effects of the class III drug d-sotalol during myocardial ischemia. Serial monophasic action potential (MAPD90) recordings and refractory period determinations from the anterior and posterior left ventricular wall were taken in 25 pigs during baseline, after low-flow posterior wall ischemia, after d-sotalol infusion under nonischemic conditions, and after repeated posterior wall ischemia while continuing the drug. Measurements were done at 60 and 150 beats/min after radiofrequency ablation of atrioventricular conduction. At baseline, MAPD90 and refractory periods were comparable in the anterior and posterior wall (323 +/- 15 vs. 318 +/- 10 ms, and 267 +/- 10 vs. 262 +/- 11 ms at 60 beats/min, respectively). In the absence of d-sotalol, low-flow regional ischemia was associated with a significant shortening of MAPD90 in the posterior versus the anterior wall (267 +/- 20 vs. 317 +/- 20 ms at 60 beats/min; p = 0.006). Similarly, ischemia-induced shortening of the refractory periods in the posterior wall was apparent (230 +/- 16 ms in the posterior wall vs. 274 +/- 14 ms in the anterior wall at 60 beats/min). In contrast, ischemia was no longer associated with shortening of MAPD90 (360 +/- 17 ms posterior wall and 360 +/- 20 ms anterior wall at 60 beats/min) and refractory periods (304 +/- 19 ms posterior wall vs. 316 +/- 15 ms anterior wall at 60 beats/min) during combined posterior wall ischemia and d-sotalol infusion. Similar findings were obtained during pacing at 150 beats/min. d-Sotalol attenuates ischemia-induced action potential shortening. This property should decrease dispersion of cardiac repolarization and be antiarrhythmic. On the other hand, longer APD under ischemic conditions may favor calcium overload, which may trigger new arrhythmias.", 
    "138": "Numerous studies have shown a beneficial effect of combination therapy with beta-blockers and calcium antagonists in patients with anginal syndrome and/or hypertension. However, because both agents exert a negative chronotropic effect, their combined use may cause bradyarrhythmias with resultant symptoms of cerebral, coronary, and systemic hypoperfusion. We describe our clinical experience with patients who had cardiovascular adverse drug reactions (CVADRs) with combination therapy. This prospective study included 26 patients who had CVADRs among 2,574 admissions during a 2-year period. The study group included 14 men and 12 women with a median age of 73 years. Various combinations of calcium antagonists and beta-blockers were associated with the CVADRs. The most frequent pharmacologic combination was diltiazem plus propranolol. The CVADRs were the cause for hospital admission in 10 patients, an associated cause in nine patients, and developed during hospitalization in seven patients. Cardiac bradyarrhythmias were found in 22 patients. These rhythm abnormalities resolved within 24 h after discontinuation of the offending drugs. Temporary transvenous pacemaker insertion was necessary in only one patient with complete atrioventricular block. Twenty-two patients recovered, two patients died of pump failure not associated with CVADRs, and in two patients, the CVADRs contributed to the patients' death. CVADRs are not uncommon in elderly patients with ischemic heart disease and/or hypertension treated with the concomitant use of calcium antagonist and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Use of calcium antagonist plus beta-blocker may unpredictably cause serious hemodynamic events, marked suppression of sinus node activity, and prolongation of atrioventricular conduction in some patients. Enhanced therapeutic monitoring may be warranted when calcium antagonists are combined with beta-blockers.", 
    "139": "A novel monolithic drug delivery system for highly water-soluble bioactive agents to follow pH-independent zero-order kinetics is described. The system utilizes a hydrophilic gel-based swellable polymeric material (polyethylene oxide), a model drug (metoprolol tartrate, 100% water soluble at 25 degrees C) and different electrolytes, such as sodium carbonate and/or pentasodium tripolyphosphate. Based on the induction of in situ intra-gel chemical reactions between different ionic species, drug and polymer, a heterogeneous structure manifested as 'peripheral boundary stiffening,' is accomplished. The consequence of these interactions essentially include the development of gradient-controlled matrix swelling as elucidated through textural profiling, which may contribute to inhibition of drug solubility and its outward diffusion. Analysis of textural profiles and photomicroscopy distinctly provides information on the disposition of peripheral boundary densification for the electrolyte-containing matrices. Electrolytic conductivity measurements performed with the simultaneous analysis of matrix swelling showed that sodium carbonate forms a highly reactive matrix within the first 3 h of medium penetration. On the other hand, larger molecules such as pentasodium tripolyphosphate maintain a constant conductivity level, which may be related to its lower solubility and diffusion in comparison to sodium carbonate. Based on model fitting and statistical analysis, it is shown that drug release kinetics were adequately described by M(t)/M(infinity)=k(0)t, with zero-order release rate constant k(0) of 0.054 h(-1). This novel approach in formulation development could potentially be used for constant rate delivery of highly soluble bioactive agents over an extended period for specific biopharmaceutical needs.", 
    "140": "In left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) due to systemic hypertension, myocardial fibrosis is an important determinant of pathologic hypertrophy. Therefore, it is most relevant to utilize an antihypertensive regimen that permits a regression in myocardial fibrosis along with blood pressure normalization and regression of LVH.", 
    "141": "To address this issue we examined 60 Sprague-Dawley rats. We treated 16-week-old rats having established LVH and myocardial fibrosis due to 8-week renovascular hypertension (RHT) with either 6 mg/kg/day zofenopril (ZOF), 30 mg/kg/day nifedipine (NIF) or 40 mg/kg/day labetalol (LAB) for 12 weeks. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP, mmHg), left ventricular/body weight ratio (LV/BW, mg/g), and left and right ventricular collagen volume fractions (LVCVF, RVCVF, %) were obtained and compared with age/sex matched untreated rats with RHT and sham-operated controls.", 
    "142": "In RHT, SAP was significantly elevated compared with controls (188+/-11 vs. 125+/-5 mmHg; P<0.001) while in each treated group SAP was normalized. LV/BW was significantly increased in RHT (2.61+/-0.12 mg/g; P<0.00001) while in each treated group LVH was completely regressed (P<0.002 vs. untreated RHT) with LV/BW values comparable to controls (1.82+/-0.03 mg/g) irrespective of the utilized antihypertensive agent. In untreated RHT, myocardial fibrosis was present in the left (LVCVF: 12.3+/-1.9%; P<0.0005 vs. 4.5+/-0.2% of controls) and right ventricles (RVCVF: 20.6+/-2.5%; P<0.00005 vs. 8.8+/-0.4% of controls). In rats treated with ZOF or NIF, LVCVF was significantly reduced to 5.6+/-0.4 and 5.4+/-0.6%, respectively (P<0.005 vs. untreated RHT), and RVCVF was decreased as well (ZOF: 11.0+/-0.9%; NIF: 10.4+/-2.4%; P<0.007 vs. untreated RHT) where no significant difference to controls remained. In contrast, treatment with LAB did not affect myocardial fibrosis where LVCVF was 9.3+/-1.3% and RVCVF was 19.8+/-2.8%, i.e., remained significantly elevated compared with controls (P<0.007).", 
    "143": "In rats with renovascular hypertension and hypertensive heart disease that included LVH and fibrosis, equipotent doses of ZOF, NIF, and LAB normalized arterial pressure associated with regression of LVH while only ZOF and NIF were found to regress myocardial fibrosis.", 
    "144": "Free radicals and lipid peroxide (LPO), easily formed in the diabetic state, play an important role in the development of diabetic complications. Potentially, nicorandil may reduce the production of free radicals and LPO in various organs. In fact, increased LPO levels in the serum, kidney, and cardiac muscle of diabetic (DM) rats were reduced by nicorandil treatment (N treatment). Xanthine oxidase (XOD), which produces free radicals, was decreased in the liver and increased in the kidney of DM rats compared with control rats, and these changes were prevented by N treatment. The concentration of Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) decreased in the cardiac muscle and increased in the kidney of DM rats, and these changes returned to normal after N treatment. The decreased concentration of Mn-SOD in the liver, kidney, and cardiac muscle from DM rats was also reversed by N treatment. The changes in catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activities in DM rats were not improved effectively by N treatment. Another K-adenosine triphosphate (K-ATP) channel opener, tilisolol hydrochloride, had an effect similar to that of nicorandil. The effects of nicorandil and tilisolol were studied only in DM rats. These data imply that N treatment, as an antioxidative therapy, may be beneficial in preventing diabetic complications due to lipoperoxidation and free radicals in DM rats.", 
    "145": "By increasing dopamine (DA) release and activating feedback mechanisms, amphetamine and related psychostimulants are known to inhibit DA cell firing. Here, we report that D-amphetamine also has an excitatory effect on DA cells, which under control conditions, is masked by the inhibitory effect of D-amphetamine and is revealed when D2-like receptors are blocked. Thus, using in vivo single-unit recording in rats, we found that the selective D2 antagonist raclopride not only blocked the inhibition induced by D-amphetamine but also enabled D-amphetamine to excite DA cells. The excitation, expressed as an increase in both firing rate and bursting, persisted when both D1- and D2-like receptors were blocked by SCH23390 and eticlopride, suggesting that it is not mediated by DA receptors. The norepinephrine uptake blocker nisoxetine mimicked the effect of D-amphetamine, especially the increase in bursting, whereas the 5-HT uptake blocker fluoxetine produced no significant effect. Adrenergic alpha1 antagonists prazosin and WB4101 and the nonselective alpha antagonist phenoxybenzamine completely blocked increase in bursting induced by D-amphetamine and partially blocked the increase in firing rate. The alpha2 antagonist idazoxan and the beta antagonist propranolole, however, failed to prevent D-amphetamine from producing the excitation. Thus, revising the traditional concept, this study suggests that D-amphetamine has two effects on DA cells, a DA-mediated inhibition and a non-DA-mediated excitation. The latter is mediated in part through adrenergic alpha1 receptors.", 
    "146": "Randomized controlled trials often rely on placebo control groups to estimate treatment differences. Recently, the high frequency of negative trials and ethical concerns surrounding the use of placebos have brought the use of placebo control groups under increased scrutiny. Although many psychiatric researchers argue that placebo control groups should be replaced with active control groups, we argue that preferential use of active control groups will not reduce the number of negative trials. Rather, we suggest that some of the variation and contradiction in randomized controlled trial results arises from the clinical heterogeneity of patient characteristics, disease severity, comorbidity, and cotherapies. Further characterization of patient heterogeneity, through improved disease taxonomies, severity indices, and classification of comorbid diseases, will serve to reduce clinical heterogeneity among patients and reduce the number of negative trials produced by wide variation in treatment and control response rates.", 
    "147": "We report on four cases of primary orthostatic tremor. The purpose of this study is the rarity of this type of tremor and the differential diagnosis with other tremors. The electrophysiological study showed a 15-20 Hz tremor frequency in our cases. There are clinical, electrophysiological and therapeutic differences of primary orthostatic tremor in report to other tremors of legs, according to the literature and characteristics of our cases.", 
    "148": "In patients with accelerated (malignant) hypertension, end-organ damage is the determinant factor for prognosis. Although recent advances in antihypertensive therapy have improved the outcome of patients with accelerated hypertension, the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy still remains less convinced. In this study, we followed 13 patients clinically diagnosed with accelerated hypertension (defined as diastolic blood pressure > 130 mmHg, retinopathy with K-W IV and accelerated renal impairment) for 3 yr. One patient died due to acute myocardial infarction arising from poor compliance with antihypertensive therapy. One patient was maintained on hemodialysis for 3 yr. One patient was introduced for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for a year and then lived without dialysis therapy. The remaining 10 patients were followed for 3 yr. All patients were initially treated with intravenous administration of calcium antagonist for reduction of blood pressure, followed by hemodialysis therapy if needed. After stabilization of blood pressure, combination therapy with extended release nifedipine (40 to 80 mg daily) and arotinolol (20 mg daily) was started. The targets for blood pressure control were a systolic pressure of 135 mmHg and a diastolic pressure of 80 mmHg. If blood pressure control was unsatisfactory, guanabenz (2 to 4 mg before bedtime), a central acting drug, was added. At presentation, the mean diastolic blood pressure (mDBP) among the 10 remaining patients was 134 +/- 2 mmHg, the mean serum creatinine (mScr) was 4.5 +/- 0.7 mg/dl and the left ventricular mass index (LVMi) as measured by echocardiography was 150 +/- 9 g/m2. At 1 yr, the mDBP was reduced to 90 +/- 3 mmHg, the mScr to 2.9 +/- 0.9 mg/dl and the LVMi to 140 +/- 9 g/m2. At 3 yr, the mDBP was stabilized at 79 +/- 3 mmHg, the mScr maintained at 2.2 +/- 0.4 mg/dl, and the LVMi reduced to 128 +/- 9 g/m2. These results indicate that appropriate blood pressure control is important for improvement of renal impairment and cardiac damage in patients with accelerated hypertension. Moreover, combination therapy with arotinolol and extended release nifedipine may be beneficial for this purpose.", 
    "149": "We report the case of a 68-yr-old woman who, upon standing, experienced dizziness in association with increased blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). We made a diagnosis of orthostatic hypertension and examined the BP response to postural change using the head-up tilt test. Positional change resulted in a 20-mmHg increase in systolic BP and a 15-bpm increase in HR. A 24-h ambulatory BP recording showed daytime hypertension that decreased at night, along with a nocturnal decrease in HR. Based on these post-diagnostic results, the patient was rediagnosed as an extreme dipper with silent lacunar infarction as the only complication of orthostatic hypertension. We suggest that, in our patient, the mechanism of orthostatic hypertension was hypersensitivity of cardiovascular responsiveness to endogenous vasoconstrictors. This was evidenced by increased pressure sensitivity to isoproterenol as well as phenylephrine. We thus selected carvedilol, a beta-blocker with slight alpha-blocking action, and were more effective in abolishing the hypertension.", 
    "150": "A matrix-dispersion-type transdermal drug delivery system of propranol was developed using different ratios of mixed polymeric grades of Eudragit. Formulations were evaluated for in vitro dissolution characteristics using a Cygnus' sandwich patch holder. Selected formulations followed zero-order release kinetics. In vivo evaluation was carried out on healthy human volunteers following a balanced incomplete block design (BIBD). In vitro dissolution rate constant k and pharmacokinetic parameters generated from plasma and urine were evaluated statistically. Statistically excellent correlation was found between percentages of drug absorbed from patch versus Cmax, AUC0-24, and AUC0-alpha. A highly significant difference was observed when Cmax and AUC0-alpha generated from plasma and urine data were compared, but when ke, t1/2e, ka, and t1/2a were compared, the difference was not significant. Urinary excretion data are suggested as a simpler alternative to blood-level data in studying the kinetics of absorption and deriving the absorption parameter.", 
    "151": "In brown adipocytes, fundamental cellular processes (cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis) are regulated by adrenergic stimulation, notably through beta-adrenergic receptors. The presence of all three beta-receptor subtypes has been demonstrated in brown adipose tissue. Due to the significance of the action of these receptors and indications that the subtypes govern different processes, the adrenergic regulation of the expression of the beta(1)-(,) beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor genes was examined in murine brown-fat primary cell cultures. Moderate levels of beta(1)-receptor mRNA, absence of beta(2)-receptor mRNA and high levels of beta(3)-receptor mRNA were observed in mature brown adipocytes (day 6 in culture). Noradrenaline (norepinephrine) addition led to diametrically opposite effects on beta(1)- (markedly enhanced expression) and beta(3)-gene expression (full cessation of expression, as previously shown). beta(2)-Gene expression was induced by noradrenaline, but only transiently (<1 h). The apparent affinities (EC(50)) of noradrenaline were clearly different (7 nM for the beta(1)-gene and</=1 nM for the beta(3)-gene), as were the mediation pathways (solely via beta(3)-receptors and cAMP for the beta(1)-gene and via beta(3)-receptors and cAMP, as well as via alpha(1)-receptors and protein kinase C, for the beta(3)-gene). The half-lives of the corresponding mRNA species were very short but different (17 min for beta(1)-mRNA and 27 min for beta(3)-mRNA), and these degradation rates were not affected by noradrenaline, implying that the mRNA levels were controlled by transcription. Inhibition of protein synthesis also led to diametrically opposite effects on beta(1)- and beta(3)-gene expression, but - notably - these effects were congruent with the noradrenaline effects, implying that a common factor regulating beta(1)-gene expression negatively and beta(3)-gene expression positively could be envisaged. In conclusion, very divergent effects of adrenergic stimulation on the expression of the different beta-receptor genes were found within one cell type, and no unifying concept of adrenergic control of beta-receptor gene expression can be formulated, either concerning different cell types, or concerning the different beta-receptor subtype genes.", 
    "152": "In male rats under anaesthesia, dialysis of the venous blood from sella turcica region was carried out. Vasopressin and oxytocin content was determined in the dialysates by radioimmunoassay. The obtained results indicate that: 1. Electrical stimulation of the superior cervical ganglion causes an increase in vasopressin and oxytocin release. 2. 20 days after superior cervical ganglionectomy the vasopressin and oxytocin release increased. 3. Superior cervical ganglionectomy immediately before the dialysis evoked a several times increase in vasopressin and oxytocin release. 4. Application of alpha1-blocker, prazosin, as well beta-blocker, propranolol, has partially prevented the increase in vasopressin release which was found immediately after superior cervical ganglionectomy. 5. Contrary to vasopressin, the increase in oxytocin release after superior cervical ganglionectomy is completely prevented by the beta-blocker, propranolol, and only partially by the alpha1-blocker, prazosin.", 
    "153": "We present a 68-year-old patient with essential tremor who was treated with propranolol hydrochloride (80 mg daily) and gabapentin (900 mg daily) after a history of mild success of gabapentin alone in relieving his symptoms. The patient had several daily episodes of paroxysmal dystonic movements in both hands. After reducing the propranolol dose to 40 mg daily, the dystonic movements resolved. This case suggests a synergistic effect between propranolol and gabapentin."
