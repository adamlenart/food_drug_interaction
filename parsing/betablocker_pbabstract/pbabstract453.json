Esmolol or placebo was administered one minute prior to induction of anaesthesia and exactly two minutes before ECT. Both the 100 and 200 mg bolus doses significantly blunted the maximum increase in heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) following ECT in comparison with placebo. Compared with placebo, esmolol 100 mg decreased maximum HR by 23 +/- 3%, maximum MAP by 17 +/- 7% and maximum rate-pressure product (RPP) by 40 +/- 9%. Esmolol 200 mg decreased maximum HR by 25 +/- 3%, maximum MAP by 19 +/- 3% and maximum RPP by 42 +/- 5%. No significant difference was found between the two esmolol doses at corresponding measurement points before and after ECT. Treatment with esmolol 200 mg resulted in a significantly shorter mean seizure duration than with placebo. As the 200 mg dose caused a shorter seizure duration and the haemodynamic effects of 100 mg and 200 mg doses were similar, it was concluded that the 100 mg esmolol bolus dose was the better dose for ECT.", 
    "1": "A double-blind, randomised study was conducted to examine the efficacy of a single bolus dose of esmolol in treating surgically-induced tachycardia. Anaesthetic technique was identical in all patients, and consisted of premedication with midazolam and glycopyrronium, induction with thiopentone followed by suxamethonium, tracheal intubation, and maintenance with isoflurane 0.6% (end-tidal) and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Forty-eight patients developed a heart rate of greater than 95 beats/minute or 20% more than pre-induction values at an average time of 34 minutes after tracheal intubation and received placebo (15 patients), esmolol 50 mg (16 patients), or esmolol 100 mg (17 patients). Controlled intervention was instituted if heart rate or blood pressure was not adequate. Both 50 and 100 mg of esmolol resulted in lower heart rates compared to placebo (p less than 0.05), with no difference between the two esmolol groups (p greater than 0.05). Patients who received placebo had more episodes of medical intervention than those given esmolol (p less than 0.05). No adverse effects occurred in any patient.", 
    "2": "The relationship between exercise tolerance assessed by a conventional exercise stress test using a standard Bruce protocol and quality of life (QoL) was studied in 50 patients with stable angina pectoris (AP). Before the exercise test, patients completed three self-administered QoL questionnaires, the Psychological General Well-Being Index, an Angina-Specific QoL Questionnaire, and Jenkins' Sleep Dysfunction Scale. Total exercise time (r = -0.40) and time until onset of pain (r = -0.44) were significantly correlated with perceived physical limitations. Somatic symptoms were related to total time (r = -0.38). Apart from a significant correlation between depressed mood and total exercise time (r = 0.36), there was no corresponding correlation with well-being and sleep disturbance. These results suggest that exercise stress tests do not reflect quality of life in patients with AP.", 
    "3": "Hyperthyroidism is associated with elevation of heart cells sensitivity to catecholamines. We demonstrated that T3(10(-8) M) increased (30%) the number of beta-adrenoceptors in intact heart cells grown in vitro within 48 hr, without changing the affinity of the ligand [3H]CGP-12177. The increase in beta-adrenoceptors in T3-treated myocytes was not associated with an increase in receptor-mediated cAMP production. Amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic drug, reduces the sensitivity of the heart to catecholamines. To investigate this effect, we analysed the influence of amiodarone on the level of beta-adrenergic receptors. Ninety minute preincubation with amiodarone (5 x 10(-5) M) decreased the number of beta-adrenoceptors (35-50%) in intact heart cells and in heart membranes, without affecting the dissociation constants (Kd). Amiodarone inhibited isoproterenol induced cAMP production. These results indicate that the mechanism of action of amiodarone on the heart seems to be a non-competitive inhibition of catecholamine receptors.", 
    "4": "The risks of agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia in relation to the use of cardiovascular drugs were estimated in a population-based case-control study conducted in Israel and Europe (total population, 23 million). Cardiovascular drug use in the week before onset of illness was compared between 270 patients hospitalized with agranulocytosis and 1870 hospitalized control subjects. Propranolol (relative risk, 2.5), dipyridamole (3.8), digoxin (2.5), and acetyldigoxin (9.9) were significantly associated with agranulocytosis. The excess risks attributable to these drugs ranged from one to three cases per 10 million persons exposed for up to 1 week. Increased risks were also observed for cinepazide (used by six cases and no control subjects), procainamide (7, 1), and aprindine (5, 1); based on crude relative risk estimates, the excess risks for the latter two drugs were approximately three per million persons exposed for up to 1 week. The use of cardiovascular drugs in a 5-month period ending 1 month before hospital admission was compared between 152 patients with aplastic anemia and 2180 control subjects. Furosemide was the only significantly associated drug (relative risk, 3.1); the excess risk attributable to any exposure in a 5-month interval was 1.7 per million.", 
    "5": "The 2- and 6-fluoro derivatives of the potent beta-adrenergic agonist 3-(tert-butylamino)-1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenoxy)-2-propanol were prepared and their adrenergic properties examined. The order of potency was as follows: beta-adrenergic activity (simulation of cyclic AMP formation in C6 glioma cells), 2-F = parent much greater than 6-F; beta 1-activity (rate of contraction, guinea pig atria), parent greater than 2-F much greater than 6-F; beta 2-activity (relaxation of guinea pig tracheal strip), 2-F greater than parent much greater than 6-F. The affinity of the 2-fluoro analogue for beta 1-adrenergic receptors (inhibition of the specific binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol, rat cerebral cortical membranes) was 2 times greater, while the 6-fluoro analogue was 1450 times less than the parent. These results suggest that the aromatic rings of phenoxypropanolamine adrenergic agonists and phenylethanolamine adrenergic agonists bind in similar fashion to the adrenergic receptor, and that if interactions between fluorine and the side-chain hydroxyl group are critical in defining beta-adrenergic selectivity, the interactions are similar in both phenoxypropanolamines and phenylethanolamines.", 
    "6": "The purpose of this study was to quantify the relative roles of the canine cardiac parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves in controlling the distribution of power within the heart rate (HR) power spectrum using a highly selective surgical technique to parasympathectomize the SA node. DAta were recorded in awake dogs (n = 6) before and after the selective denervation; the animals were isolated from human contact and their behavior carefully monitored during the measurements. The average amplitude in the high-frequency (approximately 0.32 Hz) peak in the HR power spectrum decreased from a predenervation control of 2.68 +/- 1.54 (mean +/- SD, arbitrary units) to 0.07 +/- 0.06 (P less than 0.05). Corresponding resting HR increased from 80 +/- 9 to 106 +/- 16 beats/min (P less than 0.05). The low-frequency peak (approximately 0.02 Hz) also decreased from a control of 2.45 +/- 1.18 to a postparasympathectomy value of 1.25 +/- 0.92 (P less than 0.05). beta-Adrenergic blockade (propranolol, 1 mg/kg) further decreased the latter peak to 0.59 +/- 0.52 (P less than 0.05). These data directly demonstrate that the high-frequency peak of the HR power spectrum 1) results from parasympathetic control of SA nodal automaticity, while 2) the low-frequency peak reflects activity in both divisions of the autonomic nervous system.", 
    "7": "To assess the efficacy and safety of the ultra short-acting beta-blocking agent, esmolol, in acute unstable angina, we administered esmolol to 21 patients who had persistent angina despite conventional medical therapy. Following a baseline Doppler echocardiographic examination, esmolol was titrated to reduce the rate-pressure product by at least 20%. Once the patients had been receiving a maintenance dosage for 30 minutes, Doppler echocardiographic studies were repeated. Mean esmolol dose at target response was 17 +/- 16 mg/min, with the dosage range of 8 to 24 mg/min. Esmolol was effective in alleviating anginal chest pain in 18 of the 21 patients. Seven patients eventually underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and eight had coronary bypass surgery. The remainder were discharged receiving medical therapy including oral beta-blockade. During esmolol therapy, heart rate and blood pressure decreased significantly (86 +/- 14 to 68 +/- 12 beats/min and 125 +/- 16 to 103 +/- 20 mm Hg, both p less than 0.001). Cardiac output decreased from 5.4 +/- 1.3 to 4.5 +/- 1.1 L/min (p less than 0.001) secondary to a decrease in heart rate as stroke volume remained unchanged. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 47 +/- 12 to 49 +/- 13 with esmolol therapy, although this change was not statistically significant. Both the one third filling fraction as well as E/A ratio (ratio of early-to-late diastolic filling velocities) increased with esmolol therapy (35 +/- 8% to 38 +/- 8% and 0.73 +/- 0.2 to 0.85 +/- 0.23, both p less than 0.005), indicating improvement in left ventricular diastolic function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "Hepatic drug metabolism is decreased in patients with severe liver disease, but it is unclear to what extent this is due to altered hepatic blood flow or reduced intrinsic metabolic capacity. In this study we quantitated in needle-biopsy specimens the intrinsic capacity of liver tissue from 67 patients with mild liver disease (n = 36), chronic active hepatitis (n = 16) and cirrhosis (n = 15) to metabolize two model compounds in vitro. Hydroxylation of the low-extraction drug bufuralol resulted in the formation of 251 +/- 25 nmol 1'OH-bufuralol/gm wet wt/hr in mildly diseased liver tissue and was significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced in liver tissue exhibiting chronic active hepatitis (166 +/- 23 nmol/gm wet wt/hr) and cirrhosis (124 +/- 21 nmol/gm wet wt/hr). The formation rates of monoethylglycinexylidide, the main metabolite of the high-extraction drug lidocaine, varied widely and were not significantly different among the three groups. To relate the drug-metabolizing capacity to the hepatocyte content of liver tissue, morphometrical study was performed in the biopsy pieces originally submitted. The metabolic activity of each biopsy piece was then related to the fractional volume of hepatocytes it was calculated to contain. In mildly diseased liver tissue 355 +/- 35 nmol 1'OH-bufuralol/ml hepatocytes x hr or 12.4 +/- 1.0 mumol monoethylglycinexylidide/ml hepatocytes x hr- and in cirrhotic liver tissue 306 +/- 49 nmol 1'OH-bufuralol/ml hepatocytes x hr or 15.3 +/- 3.0 mumol monoethylglycinexylidide/ml hepatocytes x hr--were formed, respectively, and these differences were not significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "To assess the relation of lipid levels to angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD), lipid profiles were obtained on 125 men and 72 women undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography. CAD, defined as greater than or equal to 25% diameter narrowing in a major coronary artery, was present in 106 men (85%) and 54 women (75%). Multiple regression analyses revealed that only high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level in men, and age and total/HDL cholesterol ratio in women, were independently associated with the presence of CAD after adjustment for other risk factors. HDL cholesterol level and age were significantly correlated with both extent (number of diseased vessels) and severity (percent maximum stenosis) of CAD in men. In women, age was the only independent variable related to severity, whereas age and total/HDL cholesterol ratio were related to extent. Of 71 patients with total cholesterol less than 200 mg/dl, 79% had CAD. With multiple regression analyses, HDL cholesterol was the only variable independently related to the presence and severity of CAD in these patients after adjustment for age and gender; extent was significantly associated with age and male gender, and was unrelated to any of the lipid parameters. With use of multiple logistic and linear regression analyses of the group of 197 patients, HDL cholesterol was the most powerful independent variable associated with the presence and severity of CAD after adjustment for age and gender. HDL cholesterol was also an independent predictor of extent. Age was independently associated with each of the end points examined, and was the variable most significantly related to extent. These data add to the growing body of information demonstrating an important association between HDL and CAD.", 
    "10": "Ideally, an antihypertensive agent should have a neutral effect or, preferably, produce a favorable shift in the serum lipid and lipoprotein profile, which is associated with a decrease in coronary heart disease risk. The thiazides and loop diuretics increase total lipid levels, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides. beta-Blockers without beta 2-agonist properties increase triglycerides and decrease high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and combined alpha/beta-blockers are generally thought to have little effect on the lipid profile, although some studies have indicated a modest beneficial effect. alpha-Adrenoceptor antagonists are known to reduce LDL cholesterol levels modestly and to increase HDL cholesterol levels. The overall results of the currently available studies with celiprolol, a selective beta 1-antagonist with ancillary beta 2-agonist and vasodilating properties, indicate a favorable effect of the drug on serum lipid and lipoprotein profiles.", 
    "11": "With the rapidly increasing average age of the population of the Western world, care and treatment of the elderly are becoming increasingly important. Cardiovascular diseases are major causes of death and disability in the elderly; hence, identification of cardiovascular risk factors and effective treatment are essential. Evidence indicates that these risk factors in the elderly are similar to those in the young; namely, high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, hyperfibrinogenemia, obesity, and cigarette smoking. The latter two relate to general patient management, whereas the remainder can be significantly influenced by modern drug therapy such as celiprolol. This drug is a third-generation highly selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with beta 2-agonist and vasodilatory activity giving a unique and advantageous pharmacologic profile for antihypertensive therapy with particular benefits for the elderly. The impact of therapy with celiprolol on the cardiovascular risk factors in the elderly hypertensive patient is reviewed.", 
    "12": "beta-Blockers are known to suppress exercise-induced ischemia but give rise to such problems as fatigue or dyspnea on effort and also bradycardia. In a series of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of celiprolol (a cardioselective beta 1-blocker with beta 2-agonist and vasodilatory properties) in patients with hypertension and angina and in normal volunteers, it was found that celiprolol did not produce bradycardia when given in combination with verapamil. Celiprolol did reduce exercise-induced ischemia, but there was no reduction in cardiac output at rest or on exercise compared with placebo. Compared with atenolol, celiprolol produced less dyspnea and fatigue at submaximal levels of exercise. It is concluded that celiprolol possesses certain differences, compared with conventional beta-blockers, that may be of direct clinical benefit.", 
    "13": "The systemic and regional hemodynamic alterations in hypertension and of the beta-adrenergic receptor inhibiting agents are reviewed. Hemodynamically, hypertension may be regarded as persistent elevation of arterial pressure associated with increased total peripheral resistance. In early or mild essential hypertension, however, increased total peripheral resistance may not readily be recognized because of the overriding effect of increased cardiac output. Clearly, the hemodynamics of blood pressure control are complex, and the mechanisms of antihypertensive agents must be used appropriately. The early beta-blockers reduced heart rate and cardiac output immediately after intravenous administration without immediately reducing arterial pressure, and calculated total peripheral resistance was increased. With prolonged oral treatment, arterial pressure decreased while maintaining a reduced heart rate and cardiac output. Total peripheral resistance, however, remained elevated. Recent beta-blockers, such as celiprolol, provide an improved physiologic response by instantly reducing arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance without reducing heart rate or cardiac output or expanding intravascular volume.", 
    "14": "The clinical pharmacology of beta-adrenoceptor blockers is summarized. They have a variety of pharmacological actions on the beta-adrenoceptors. For example, propranolol is a nonselective beta-blocker with antagonist effects on both beta 1 and beta 2 receptors, atenolol is a selective beta 1-antagonist, and celiprolol is a selective beta 1-antagonist, partial beta 2-agonist. beta 1-Receptor blockade tends to reduce heart rate, cardiac output, and arterial pressure while increasing peripheral vascular resistance, whereas beta 2-receptor blockade tends to be disadvantageous in causing bronchoconstriction and peripheral vasoconstriction. Selective beta 1-antagonist, beta 2-agonist activity would, therefore, appear to be particularly beneficial in offering the advantages of beta 1 blockade plus peripheral vasodilation. The beta 1- and beta 2-receptor actions of drugs are not always clearly identifiable, as in the demonstration of celiprolol's partial beta 2-agonist activity in human beings. This is because, in vivo, cardiovascular reflexes are intact and it has not, so far, been possible to remove endogenous catecholamines. This review summarizes various studies to investigate partial agonist activity, with particular emphasis on celiprolol.", 
    "15": "The authors report their experience using esmolol, an ultra-short acting beta-adrenergic antagonist, for the treatment of seven patients with cocaine-associated cardiovascular complications. No consistent hemodynamic benefit was found with the use of this drug. Although there was a decline in mean heart rate of 23% (range 0% to 35%), they were unable to show a consistent antihypertensive response. Adverse effects occurred in three patients. This included one patient with a marked exacerbation of hypertension and one who became hypotensive. Another patient developed emesis and lethargy during esmolol therapy and required endotracheal intubation. They do not recommend the routine use of esmolol for cocaine cardiotoxicity.", 
    "16": "In anesthetized cats, electrical stimulation of the nucleus ambiguous elicited obvious changes in electrical activity of the pylorus: slow wave frequency decreased, spike potentials either appeared or disappeared depending on stomach wall functional state. Also, the electrical stimulation decelerated the heart rate and decreased arterial blood pressure.", 
    "17": "Morphine treatment (20 mg/kg for 7 consecutive days) did not affect the density of [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) binding sites in the cortical membranes of the rat, but during naloxone-precipitated abstinence syndrome the density of these sites increased. Electroconvulsive treatment for 6 days, which by itself decreased the density of [3H]DHA binding sites, prevented the increase.", 
    "18": "beta-Adrenergic and muscarine acetylcholinergic receptors were studied in human lung parenchyma obtained from patients with tuberculoma (after segmental resection of tuberculoma surrounding normal tissues were performed to obtain control samples) as well as from patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Assays of binding of beta-adrenergic radioligand 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) exhibited high affinity in lung parenchyma membranes in both control samples and in that of patients with tumors. Binding of muscarine antagonist 3H-quinuclidinyl benzylate (3H-QNB) also showed high rate of affinity in lung parenchyma. High number of 3H-DHA binding sites was distinctly decreased and 3H-QNB--was increased in lung malignant tumors as compared with normal tissue. Considerable decrease of beta-adrenergic and increase of muscarine receptors were found in patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. beta-Adrenergic and muscarine receptors appear to be of importance in pathogenesis of human lung malignant tumors.", 
    "19": "A radiant heat device (RHD) for whole-body hyperthermia (WBH) has been safely and effectively used with a dog model. The cardiovascular changes which occur in the dog during WBH--including heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume and ejection fraction--agree qualitatively and quantitatively with changes observed in previous WBH-RHD studies done in pigs and humans. We elected to study the effect of propanolol in dogs during WBH in order to evaluate this drug's potential use in human cancer patients who are ineligible for WBH because of coronary artery disease. This report details cardiovascular changes which occur with beta-blockade during 42 degrees C WBH in the dog. Our results show that the level of beta-blockade needed to control heart rate during WBH produces acute cardiovascular decompensation.", 
    "20": "Prevention of cardiotoxicity without interfering with the therapeutic efficacy of adriamycin is a very crucial question. We have investigated the activity of beta-adrenoceptor coupled to guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins) and Ca(2+)-ATPase activity in experimental adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity and the influence of metoprolol treatment on these variables. Adriamycin was administered to rats intravenously as a single dose of 6 mg/kg, and metoprol was continuously given by means of implanted osmotic pumps. beta-Adrenoceptor characteristics were measured by radioligand-binding experiments and by basal and stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Northern blot and dot blot analysis was used to quantify G-protein mRNA. It was shown that adriamycin did not induce any change in the total beta-adrenoceptor density, nor did the high affinity agonist binding to beta-adrenoceptor change. Adriamycin did not induce any alteration in the amount of mRNA encoding for stimulatory (Gs) or inhibitory (Gi) G-proteins. Also, basal and stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities were identical in the different experimental groups. In contrast, the Ca(2+)-ATPase was shown to increase in adriamycin-treated rats compared to control rats (45 +/- 3.8 versus 23 +/- 1.2 mumol Pi/mg/h, P less than .01). Metoprolol was shown to normalize this increase (29 +/- 2.1 mumol Pi/mg/h). Thus, it may be concluded that in experimental adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity, despite Ca(2+)-overloading, the beta-adrenoceptor-G protein-adenylyl cyclase system remains intact. Metoprolol seems to prevent Ca(2+)-overloading independently of the beta-adrenoceptors studied here.", 
    "21": "Thiobarbituric acid-reactants (TBARs) are considered to be an index of lipid peroxidation. In the present experiments, the effect of stress and hormones on hepatic TBARs levels was studied in Sprague-Dawley rats. In unstressed conditions adrenalectomized rats showed higher TBARs levels than sham-adrenalectomized rats. The effect of adrenalectomy was reverted by the administration of corticosterone but not by that of aldosterone, indicating that glucocorticoids exert a negative role on the regulation of liver TBARs. The effect of these hormones appears to be a permissive one, since the administration of a long lasting ACTH preparation did not reduce liver TBARs. In contrast to that observed in unstressed rats, glucocorticoids appeared to increase liver TBARs in stressed rats. Nevertheless, other alternative explanations are possible. Finally, no evidence for a role of catecholamines in the regulation of hepatic TBARs was found.", 
    "22": "To elucidate the possible role of adrenergic mechanism in thyroid hormone metabolism during starvation, serum thyrotropin (TSH), thyroxine (T4), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) levels and conversion of T4 to T3 in perfused liver were investigated in fasting (60 h) and fed rats. Propranolol (0.5 mg/kg), yohimbine (0.3 mg/kg) or phentolamine (5.0 mg/kg) was subcutaneously injected to the rat every 12 h. Serum levels of TSH, T4, and T3 were significantly lower in fasting rats than in fed rats. Although propranolol, yohimbine, and phentolamine administration did not significantly alter circulating TSH, T4 and T3 levels in fed rats, phentolamine partly inhibited the starvation-induced reduction in circulating TSH, T4, and T3. Thyroxine uptake and T3 production in perfused liver were significantly lower in fasting rats than in fed rats. Phentolamine treatment did not alter the T4 uptake and T3 production in perfused liver of fasting rats. These results suggest that alpha-adrenergic mechanism may have some role in starvation-induced reduction in circulating T4 and T3, and that phentolamine partly inhibited this phenomenon probably through the inhibitory effect on reduction in circulating TSH during starvation.", 
    "23": "Besides the variety of other cellular processes in which beta-adrenergic compounds have been involved, their effect on the second messenger cAMP is thought to be related to the growth and differentiation of malignant cells. Because beta-adrenergic receptor could be an easy target for a new combination treatment, we attempted to identify and characterize adrenergic receptor in breast tumor and sought for correlations with estradiol and progesterone receptors. Using L[3H]-dihydroalprenolol, a potent beta-adrenergic antagonist, we demonstrated in human breast tumor the presence of beta-adrenergic receptors with high affinity (Kd 1-3 nM) as shown by Scatchard analyses. Natural and synthetic agonists and antagonists inhibited the [3H] DHA binding, mainly in the order of beta 2-subtype potency. We verified that these receptors were normally coupled with G-protein. A slight correlation was shown between adrenergic and progesterone receptors, and no correlation between adrenergic and estrogen receptors. The presence of specific beta-adrenergic receptors functionally coupled with G protein incited us to study their physiological regulation, since it is tempting to speculate that circulating or locally released catecholamines or other natural compounds may participate in the process of growth and differentiation of the mammary gland through adrenergic receptors.", 
    "24": "Surgical preparation of the rat cremaster skeletal muscle for microvascular study usually involves occlusion of the deferential artery and vein which supply a collateral circulation to the tissue. This allows removal of the testis and ductus deferens, and permits direct observation of the cremaster microvasculature. We examined with intravital microscopy the effect of this occlusion on alpha-adrenergic and nonreceptor-mediated (KCl) constriction of large arterioles (1A, 136 microns i.d.) and venules (1V, 193 microns i.d.). The acutely denervated cremaster was suspended in a tissue bath containing propranolol to block beta-adrenergic receptors. alpha 1-adrenergic (norepinephrine (NE) + rauwolscine), alpha 2-adrenergic (NE + prazosin), and KCl (+ phentolamine) concentration-response curves were obtained for bath-added agonists before vs after occlusion of the deferential circulation. Occlusion had no effect on baseline 1A diameter but increased 1V diameter slightly. Arteriolar alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic sensitivities were unaffected by occlusion, but venular sensitivities were reduced by the same amount (approximately fourfold) for both receptor types. Occlusion increased arteriolar sensitivity to KCl but had no effect of venular KCl sensitivity. These data indicate that occlusion of the deferential collateral circulation can produce significant and varied effects on alpha-adrenoceptor and nonreceptor-mediated constriction of cremaster large arteriolar and venular smooth muscle, and underscore the need to avoid collateral occlusion for certain studies of the cremaster microcirculation.", 
    "25": "1. The mouse neocortical slice has been used to examine the sensitivity of neurones to isoprenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and adenosine acutely and following chronic treatment of animals with propranolol or theophylline. 2. While having little effect alone, all three agonists enhanced the d.c. depolarizing potential produced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). The effect of (-)-isoprenaline (0.2 microM) was shared by (+)-isoprenaline at the much higher concentration of 10 microM. 3. Superfusion of slices with theophylline or 8-phenyltheophylline blocked responses to adenosine with evidence of selectivity. A single injection of theophylline 24 h before slice preparation did not alter agonist sensitivity, but when administered daily at 100 mg kg-1 for 14 days, the xanthine caused a loss of sensitivity to adenosine and (-)-isoprenaline but not 5-HT. The lower dose of theophylline, 10 mg kg-1 daily, also led to a loss of adenosine responses but no change of sensitivity to the amines. 4. Following the 14 day treatment with theophylline at 100 mg kg-1 daily in two groups of mice, responses to adenosine recovered to control levels after 20 days. 5. Propranolol superfusion blocked responses to both isomers of isoprenaline and 5-HT but did not affect sensitivity to adenosine. 6. Chronic treatment with propranolol at 25 mg kg-1 daily for 14 days induced a loss of sensitivity to (-)-isoprenaline and 5-HT but not adenosine. A lower dose of 5 mg kg-1 daily caused no change in responses to adenosine or 5-HT, but yielded an increased sensitivity to (-)-isoprenaline. 7. The results are discussed with respect to reports of receptor up-regulation in binding studies; caution is clearly required in extrapolating from such work to receptor activity in a functional system, especially in the case of theophylline and adenosine.", 
    "26": "1. Optically pure enantiomers of propafenone and diprafenone were prepared from their racemic mixtures and tested for their ability to block beta-adrenoceptors and to prolong functional refractory period in the guinea-pig heart. beta-Adrenoceptor affinity of the enantiomers was determined by the radioligand binding technique and in functional experiments. 2. Propafenone and diprafenone inhibited specific binding of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (-)-[3H]-CGP-12177 to guinea-pig myocardial membranes. beta-Adrenoceptor affinities of diprafenone enantiomers exceeded those of corresponding propafenone enantiomers by one order of magnitude. Displacement of (-)-[3H]-CGP-12177 by both antiarrhythmics was highly stereoselective, in that the (S)-enantiomers were 40-60 fold, i.e. 1.6-1.8 log units more potent than the (R)-enantiomers. 3. Propafenone and diprafenone antagonized the positive inotropic action of isoprenaline in isolated atria. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonist potencies of diprafenone enantiomers were about one order of magnitude higher than those of corresponding propafenone enantiomers. For both drugs the (S)-enantiomer was found to be considerably more potent (14-40 fold) than the (R)-enantiomer. 4. Propafenone and diprafenone prolonged functional refractory period of isolated auricles with equal potency and no difference in the antiarrhythmic activity of purified enantiomers was found. 5. It is concluded that the enantiomers of propafenone and diprafenone exert comparable antiarrhythmic activity, whereas only (S)-enantiomers block cardiac beta-adrenoceptors with high affinity, which explains the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist effects of the racemic drugs.", 
    "27": "1. The nature of the beta-adrenoceptor(s) mediating adenylyl cyclase activation in rat adipocyte ghosts by (-)-isoprenaline and the lipolytically selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, BRL 37344, was investigated by use of the beta 1-selective antagonist, CGP 20712A. The results were compared with lipolysis in adipocytes. 2. While in lipolysis BRL 37344 was a full and 10 times more potent agonist than (-)-isoprenaline, in adenylyl cyclase activation similar pD2 values for both agonists were found. BRL 37344 was only a partial agonist on rat adipocyte adenylyl cyclase, with an intrinsic activity of 0.62. 3. With CGP 20712A small rightward shifts of the (-)-isoprenaline concentration-response curve (CRC) were observed at concentrations up to 10 microM, while at 100 microM and 1 mM clear rightward shifts occurred. The BRL 37344 CRC was not shifted with antagonist concentrations up to 10 microM. Only at 100 microM and 1 mM CGP 20712A were rightward shifts observed. 4. CGP 20712A concentrations of 10 microM and 100 microM depressed the maximum of the (-)-isoprenaline CRC to 89 and 60%, while the BRL 37344 CRCs retained the control maximum effect (62% of (-)-isoprenaline). Only at 1 mM CGP 20712A, was the CRC of BRL 37344 depressed, while the (-)-isoprenaline maximum was diminished further. 5. It was concluded that as with lipolysis, (-)-isoprenaline acts both through typical beta 1- and atypical beta 3-adrenoceptors for activation of adenylyl cyclase, while BRL 37344 acts solely through atypical beta 3-adrenoceptors. 6. The results also demonstrate that the relationship between adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and lipolysis is different for BRL 37344 and (-)-isoprenaline. Although the maximum activation of adenylyl cyclase by BRL 37344 is only 62% of that by (-)-isoprenaline, the distance between the lipolysis and adenylyl cyclase CRCs is much larger in the case of BRL 37344, indicating a larger transduction reserve for this agonist.", 
    "28": "The beta-adrenergic antagonists, alprenolol and propranolol, inhibit the Na+/H+ exchanger in rat renal brush-border membrane vesicles. Half-maximal inhibition occurs at 86 microM alprenolol and 36 microM propranolol. Similar to amiloride and Na+, propranolol protects the Na+/H+ exchanger from irreversible inhibition by the carboxyl group reagent, N,N'-dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide (DCCD). Protection is incomplete, depends on propranolol concentration, and reaches a maximum at 0.4 mM propranolol. With a comparable dose dependence, propranolol protects a 65 kDa band from labeling with [14C]DCCD. The data indicate that beta-adrenergic antagonists specifically interact with the proximal tubular Na+/H+ exchanger.", 
    "29": "The roles of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and noradrenaline (NA) in sympathetic neurotransmission to large arteries and veins were studied in vitro using the thoracic portions of the aorta and inferior vena cava from guinea-pigs. Both vessels are densely innervated by axons containing NA and NPY. Repetitive transmural stimulation at 2-30 Hz produced contractions of the aorta, which were abolished by prazosin. NPY did not have significant postsynaptic or presynaptic effects on vascular tone of the aorta. Transmural stimulation of the vena cava produced long-lasting contractions which were enhanced by alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, and were blocked by guanethidine. Precontracted venae cavae responded to sympathetic stimulation with beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation, followed by contraction. alpha-Adrenoceptor blockade delayed the onset of neurogenic contractions. NPY was a potent contractile agent of the vena cava (EC50 approximately 1.5 x 10(-8) M). A high concentration (3 x 10(-6) M) of NPY, or the specific NPY Y1 receptor agonist, [Leu31, Pro34]NPY, caused parallel, and reversible, desensitization of contractions produced by sympathetic nerve stimulation, and by low concentrations of exogenous NPY. This provides good evidence that NPY is the mediator of the non-adrenergic sympathetic contractions of the vena cava. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that differential location or coupling of postsynaptic receptors for NA and NPY in the aorta and vena cava, leads to differential participation by these substances in sympathetic vasomotor responses. This is likely to be related to the different functions of these two parts of the systemic circulation.", 
    "30": "The beta-antagonistic effects of celiprolol were assessed in isolated guinea-pig preparations. The pA2 values obtained were 7.84 +/- 0.07, 7.79 +/- 0.06 and 6.45 +/- 0.11 against the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects in the atria and relaxant effects in the trachea induced by isoproterenol, respectively, indicating that celiprolol is a cardioselective beta-antagonist. Celiprolol produced slight positive chronotropic and inotropic effects in atrial preparations and a uniquely strong relaxant effect in tracheal preparations. All these effects were attenuated by pretreatment with 10(-6) M atenolol or 10(-6) M propranolol. In pithed rats, celiprolol produced pressor responses at doses lower than 0.03 mg/kg and hypotensive responses at doses higher than 0.3 mg/kg. It produced sustained increases in heart rate in all doses applied. These effects were attenuated by pretreatment with 1 mg/kg of propranolol. The pressor response might be taken to be a reflection of an increase in cardiac function mediated by cardiac beta 1-receptor stimulation, while the hypotension may be ascribed mainly to stimulation of beta 2-adrenoceptors in the vascular system. It is concluded that celiprolol exerts a uniquely strong partial agonist activity at beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "31": "Immunoblot analysis of cell extracts using antibodies specific for the 91-kDa form of membrane-associated phosphatidate phosphatase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Lin, Y.-P., and Carman, G.M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8641-8645) revealed the existence of a 45-kDa form of the enzyme. Immunoblot analysis also showed that the 91-kDa form of the enzyme was a proteolytic product of a 104-kDa enzyme. The mitochondrial fraction contained the 45-kDa enzyme, whereas the microsomal fraction contained the 45- and 104-kDa enzymes. In vivo labeling experiments showed that the 104-kDa form of phosphatidate phosphatase was not a precursor of the 45-kDa form of the enzyme. The 45- and 104-kDa forms of phosphatidate phosphatase were purified and characterized. The enzymological properties of both enzymes were similar. However, the phosphatidate phosphatase 45- and 104-kDa proteins differed with respect to their isoelectric points and peptide fragments resulting from V8 proteolysis and cyanogen bromide cleavage. The expression of the phosphatidate phosphatase 45- and 104-kDa enzymes were regulated differentially in cells supplemented with inositol. The addition of inositol to the growth medium resulted in the induction of the phosphatidate phosphatase 45-kDa enzyme. The expression of the 104-kDa enzyme was not affected by inositol. Both forms of phosphatidate phosphatase were induced when cells entered the stationary phase of growth.", 
    "32": "[125I]Iodocyanopindolol binding sites were characterized by autoradiography in the superior cervical ganglia of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. A high concentration of (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol binding sites, characterized as beta-adrenoceptors by (-)-propranolol displacement, was distributed throughout the ganglia and in the postganglionic (internal carotid) nerve. ICI 118,551, a beta 2-selective antagonist, displaced more than 85% of the binding sites, whereas CGP 20712A, a beta 1-selective antagonist, displaced less than 10% of the binding sites, indicating that the beta-adrenoceptors were primarily of the beta 2-subtype. Emulsion autoradiography demonstrated that at least part of the binding sites were associated with principal ganglion cells. Unilateral deafferentation did not modify the number of binding sites in the superior cervical ganglia of WKY or spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). These results suggest that at least part of these receptors may correspond to prejunctional beta 2-adrenoceptors originated in principal ganglion cells. The concentration of beta 2-receptors was increased in the superior cervical ganglia of young and adult SHR when compared to age-matched WKY rats (49% and 39%, respectively). There were no differences in beta 2-adrenoceptor number in the stellate ganglia of young and adult WKY and SHR. These results suggest that beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation may be selectively enhanced in some peripheral sympathetic ganglia in SHR and this could play a role in the development and maintenance of the increased sympathetic activity in this strain.", 
    "33": "Blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients is a surrogate for the real therapeutic goal of reducing the risks consequent to hypertension. This surrogate is convenient but its use may have important therapeutic implications. Results of treatment with new antihypertensive agents, data from clinical trials, and insights into underlying mechanisms are reviewed. The overall success of antihypertensive therapy has been undeniable, but has reduced minimally the frequency of atherosclerosis and coronary events; metabolic disarray resulting from the agents used, especially thiazides and beta blockers, may have contributed to this. Electrolyte abnormalities predispose to malignant arrhythmias and sudden death during myocardial infarction. Left ventricular hypertrophy, a chief risk factor for coronary events, arrhythmias, and heart failure, responds selectively to antihypertensive agents. Similarly, progression of renal injury may be sensitive to the agents used. Obesity and hypertension frequently coexist. Evidence is growing that atherogenic abnormalities common in obese patients, such as insulin resistance, also occur in the nonobese patient and are sensitive to the antihypertensive agent selected.", 
    "34": "The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on stroke volume (SV) at increasing submaximal exercise intensities was studied in 12 endurance-trained normotensive and 12 untrained hypertensive (diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg) men, aged 18 to 34 years. Subjects were assigned to each of 3 treatments in a double-blind, randomized order: placebo, propranolol (80 mg twice daily) and pindolol (10 mg twice daily) for 10 days, with a period of 48 to 60 hours from the initial dose to the first treadmill test and a 4-day washout period between drugs. Cardiac output was measured using the carbon dioxide rebreathing method and SV was calculated from cardiac output and heart rate as follows: SV = cardiac output/heart rate. Cardiac outputs were estimated at rest and while walking on a treadmill at 25, 45, 60 and 75% of the subject's previously determined maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). No significant differences were found in cardiac output between either of the drugs and placebo at rest, or at any of the 4 rates of work. Propranolol significantly increased SV above placebo values (p less than 0.05) for both trained and untrained groups at the intensities of 45, 60 and 75%. Significant differences in SV were found between pindolol and placebo only at the intensities of 60 and 75% in the trained group. Contrary to expectations, SV showed no indication of a plateau with propranolol in the trained subjects throughout the 4 different exercise intensities, whereas a plateau was established under placebo conditions by 45% of VO2max in both trained and untrained subjects. These results suggest that both trained and untrained hypertensive persons can exercise with beta-adrenergic blockade at submaximal levels without compromised cardiac function.", 
    "35": "Assays for two distinct phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activities were established based upon a differential inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). The activity that is insensitive to this reagent in rat liver is predominantly in the plasma membrane fraction, whereas the NEM-sensitive activity is in the cytosolic and microsomal fractions. The NEM-insensitive activity is further distinguished from the NEM-sensitive phosphohydrolase by: (a) being relatively stable to heat; (b) not being inhibited by phenylglyoxal, butane-2,3-dione, cyclohexane-1,2-dione, 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, and diethyl pyrocarbonate; (c) being inhibited by NaF and phosphatidylcholine; and (d) not being stimulated by Mg2+. The NEM-insensitive activity was specific for phosphatidate. Both phosphohydrolase activities could be inhibited by chlorpromazine, propranolol, sphingosine, and spermine. The NEM-sensitive phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activity was increased by incubating hepatocytes for 12 h with glucagon and dexamethasone, and this effect was antagonized by insulin. The NEM-sensitive phosphohydrolase is concluded to be involved in glycerolipid synthesis. The activity of the NEM-insensitive phosphohydrolase was not altered by preincubation of rat hepatocytes in the short or long term with vasopressin, glucagon, insulin, triiodothyronine, or dexamethasone, but it might be modulated indirectly by sphingosine. The NEM-insensitive enzyme of the plasma membranes could be involved in signal transduction via the agonist-stimulated degradation of phosphatidylcholine through the phospholipase D pathway.", 
    "36": "Several time and frequency domain measures of heart period variability are reduced 1 to 2 weeks after myocardial infarction, and a reduced standard deviation of normal RR intervals over a 24 h period (SDNN) is associated with increased mortality. The predictive accuracy of heart period variability may be reduced by drugs used to treat patients after myocardial infarction. Accordingly, a randomized, three period, placebo-controlled, crossover (Latin square) design was used to determine the effect of atenolol and diltiazem on time and frequency measures of heart period variability calculated from 24 h continuous electrocardiographic recordings during treatment with atenolol, diltiazem and placebo in 18 normal volunteers. During atenolol treatment, the 24 h average normal RR (NN) interval increased 24% (p less than 0.001). The three measures of tonic vagal activity were significantly increased (p less than 0.001) during atenolol treatment: percent of successive normal RR intervals greater than 50 ms = 69%, root mean square successive difference of normal RR intervals = 61% and high frequency power in the heart period power spectrum = 84%. Low frequency power also increased 45% (p less than 0.01), indicating that this variable also is an indicator of tonic vagal activity over 24 h. Diltiazem had no significant effect on the 24 h average NN interval or on any measure of heart period variability. The decreased mortality rate after myocardial infarction associated with beta-adrenergic blocker but not calcium channel blocker therapy may be attributed in part to an increase in vagal tone caused by beta-blockers.", 
    "37": "d-Propranolol lacks clinically significant beta-adrenergic receptor blocking properties, but has the same membrane stabilizing effects as racemic (d,l) propranolol. To assess the role of beta-blockade versus membrane stabilization or other shared nonspecific effects in the therapeutic action of propranolol in neuroleptic-induced akathisia (NIA) we treated 11 patients with NIA in a crossover, double-blind study of d-propranolol versus placebo. Akathisia scores were unchanged after both d-propranolol and placebo. Eight patients were subsequently treated in a nonblind manner with racemic propranolol, with a significant reduction in akathisia scores. These findings suggest that beta-blockade, not membrane stabilization or other shared nonspecific effects, contributes to the efficacy of propranolol in NIA.", 
    "38": "Many recommended drug doses are higher than necessary, for two reasons. Drugs are often introduced at a dose that will be effective in around 90% of the target population, because this helps market penetration. Doses are also partly determined by an irrational preference for round numbers. The dose excess due to such digit preference may be as much as 70% of the correct dose and on average is probably 25%. Needlessly high doses are bound to cause avoidable unwanted effects in a proportion of patients. Rigorous methods must be used to determine the doses recommended and the amount of drug to be put into a tablet or other dosage form.", 
    "39": "Stimulation of DDT1 MF-2 vas deferens cells with epinephrine resulted in a time- and dose-dependent loss of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-specific ligand binding. Regulation of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA was characterized. In monolayer culture, cells displayed 0.7 +/- 0.05 amol of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA/microgram of total cellular RNA. Epinephrine, which acts at both alpha 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors of DDT1 MF-2 cells, induced a short term (2-8 h) increase (50-70%) in the abundance of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA. Propranolol, a beta 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, attenuated the epinephrine-mediated increase in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA but did not affect the decrease in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-specific ligand binding. Phentolamine, an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, did not attenuate the epinephrine-mediated increase in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA at 4 h but did block the decrease in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-specific ligand binding. The half-life of the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA was approximately 7 h in untreated cells as well as in cells challenged with epinephrine. The epinephrine-promoted increase in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA was found to result from cross-regulation via beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Cholera toxin, forskolin, as well as the cyclic AMP analog CPT cAMP (8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate) increased the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA at 4 h, as did epinephrine in the presence of alpha 1-antagonists but not in the presence of a beta-adrenergic antagonist. This is the first report of heterologous up-regulation of mRNA levels of adrenergic receptors. Cross-regulation between alpha 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated pathways at 4 h occurs at the level of mRNA whereas later down-regulation of alpha 1-receptor mRNA and binding proceed via agonist activation of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "40": "Neonatal hyperthyroidism is only seen in children whose mothers had an autoimmune thyroid disease. In these women, thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) must be assayed during pregnancy, so that the newborn can be taken care of immediately. Contrary to thyroid hormones, TSI cross the placental barrier and are responsible for thyrotoxicosis; regular monitoring of their decrease in the newborn indicates that these antibodies are of maternal origin. In both mother and child, the treatment of choice is a synthetic antithyroid drug.", 
    "41": "A previous study from this laboratory reported an antiaversive effect of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol microinjected into the dorsal periaqueductal grey (DPAG) of the rat, that was antagonized by the 5-HT(2) receptor blocker ritanserin. The present results show that microinjection into the DPAG of isamoltane (4-32nmol) a beta-blocking agent that binds to 5-HT(1B) receptors more selectively than propranolol, raised the threshold of aversive electrical stimulation of the rat DPAG in a dose-dependent manner. The antiaversive effect of 8nmol of isamoltane was antagonized by pretreatment with ritanserin (10nmol), as well as by the more selective 5-HT(2) receptor blocker ketanserin (10nmol). Therefore, the antiaversive effect of beta-adrenoceptor/5-HT(1B) receptor antagonists injected into the DPAG is likely to be mediated by endogenous 5-HT, through activation of 5-HT(2) receptors.", 
    "42": "The aim of the present investigation was to examine whether or not presynaptic facilitatory beta-adrenoceptors are detectable on the postganglionic nerves in the rabbit isolated ear artery. Strips of rabbit central ear artery were incubated with 3H-noradrenaline (10(-7) mol/l; 30 min or 10(-6) mol/l; 60 min). Subsequently, they were washed repeatedly with physiological salt solution. The strips were subjected to electrical-field stimulation (S1-S8) and the resultant 3H-overflow was determined. When the ear artery was stimulated with 150 pulses (0.5 ms; 3 Hz; 225 mA), isoprenaline (10(-9)-10(-6) mol/l) either alone or in the presence of either rauwolscine (10(-6) mol/l) or phentolamine (10(-6) mol/l) did not alter the stimulation-evoked 3H-overflow. This was also the case in the presence of rauwolscine (10(-6) mol/l) plus either the selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor ICI 63 197 (3 x 10(-5) mol/l) or forskolin (10(-6) mol/l). When the ear artery was stimulated with 300 pulses (1 ms; 5 Hz; 225 mA), isoprenaline had no effect on the stimulation-evoked 3H-overflow. This was also the case when phentolamine (10(-6) mol/l) was present. Propranolol (10(-7)-10(-5) mol/l) did not alter the stimulation-evoked 3H-overflow. In some experiments, the stimulation current was reduced to 175 mA in order to obtain similar reference release (S3) values despite the presence of rauwolscine (150 pulses; 0.5 ms; 3 Hz). Even then, isoprenaline (10(-9)-10(-6) mol/l) did not change stimulation-evoked 3H-overflow. The results suggest that postganglionic sympathetic nerves in rabbit central ear artery do not possess presynaptic facilitatory beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "43": "Each of three monkeys was operantly conditioned to slow its heart, to exercise (lift weights) and to attenuate the tachycardia of exercise by combining these two skills. Each was further tested during beta-adrenergic blockade (atenolol), combined alpha-adrenergic blockade (prazosin) and beta-adrenergic blockade, or cholinergic blockade (methylatropine). During all experiments heart rate, stroke volume, intraarterial blood pressure, O2 consumption, and CO2 production were recorded on a beat-to-beat basis. Each animal was able to attenuate the tachycardia of exercise under each of the drug conditions, indicating that \"central command\" is not the expression of fixed, cardiovascular and pulmonary reflexes elicited by somato-motor commands, but rather is an adaptive behavior, determined by environmental contingencies and mediated by cardiovascular and pulmonary as well as somato-motor commands. The ability of the animals to perform with greater cardiac efficiency during the combined exercise and heart rate slowing task relative to the exercise-only task was not affected by sympathetic blockade; however, parasympathetic blockade did reduce cardiac efficiency.", 
    "44": "1. Cimetidine pretreatment of male Sprague-Dawley rats caused a significant increase in the specific content of total hepatic cytochrome P-450, supporting the hypothesis that this H2-receptor antagonist has monooxygenase induction effects. 2. Quantitative ultrastructural studies of liver of cimetidine-pretreated animals also supported this hypothesis in showing a significant proliferation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. These ultrastructural changes were qualitatively similar to those produced by treatment of rats with phenobarbital, a well-characterized monooxygenase-inducing agent whose effects were studied for comparative purposes. 3. Competitive inhibition of metoprolol alpha-hydroxylation by cimetidine in liver microsomes prepared from untreated animals (Ki = 18.8 microM) was also demonstrated. 4. These results allowed testing of the hypothesis (Burnet et al. 1986) that inhibition of a defined monooxygenase should lead to induction of the synthesis of the relevant cytochrome P-450 isozyme. 5. The finding that metoprolol alpha-hydroxylase activity of liver microsomes was lowered, not elevated, by pretreatment of animals with cimetidine argues against the concept of a causal link between monooxygenase inhibition and induction.", 
    "45": "The polyanionic form of methacrylic acid:methacrylic acid methyl ester copolymer reacts readily with propranolol.HCl to give a sparingly soluble complex at saturation equilibrium. Propranolol: methacrylic acid copolymer complex is characterized by differential thermal analysis, and IR and UV spectroscopic methods. Propranolol content is found to be 68% in the complex. The value of the Hill coefficient (1.5) indicates that there is a high degree of positive cooperative interaction between propranolol and the polymer.", 
    "46": "Changes in left diastolic filling which had been caused by treatment with the beta-adrenoblocker atenolol given in a dose of 50-100 mg/day were studied in 66 patients with Functional Class I-II exercise-induced angina pectoris. Echocardiography was performed during isometric exercise tests before and 7-9 days after drug administration. It was ascertained that not only ino- and chronotropic mechanisms, but redistribution in diastole patterns in the direction of increasing atrial systole were involved to adequately maintain cardiac output during exercise. Ejection fraction became higher in response to exercise with predominant myocardial mass, whereas atrial systolic fraction, with predominant dilatation. The drug produced its negative inotropic effect in the patients with predominant left ventricular dilation; a decrease in the rapid filling fraction was not followed by an increase in the atrial systolic fraction, which may be regarded as an early sign of myocardial failure.", 
    "47": "Obsidan was tested for effects on psychoemotional stress (PES) tolerance in 37 patients with coronary heart disease concurrent with angina pectoris. During PES testing, the course treatment of obsidan versus placebo resulted in a significant decrease in the pulse-pressure index by significantly bringing down heart rate. With this, blood pressure remained unchanged. The patients who were highly responsive to PES, as evidenced by heart rate measurement, showed a high rise in systolic and diastolic blood pressure when they were taking obsidan. The frequency of positive tests was 48.7% before obsidan therapy and 8.1% during its therapy; that was 29.8 and 8.1%, respectively, when the objective criterion for myocardial ischemia was used as ECG ST-segment displacement.", 
    "48": "The antihypertensive and haemodynamic effects of labetalol were compared with those of prazosin both at rest and during bicycle exercise in 38 moderate to moderately severe hypertensive patients (supine DBP 95 to 119 mmHg when untreated). Following a two week open placebo phase to establish baseline BP and baseline exercise performance, patients were randomly and double-blindedly assigned to receive labetalol or prazosin. Drug dose was titrated from 100 to 400 mg labetalol twice daily, or from one to 10 mg prazosin twice daily at weekly intervals until BP was controlled (supine DBP less than or equal to 90 mmHg with at least a 10 mmHg decrease from baseline). Eighteen labetalol and twenty prazosin patients achieved BP control and were subsequently reexercised to fatigue on a bicycle ergometer. The mean changes from baseline for heart rate and rate pressure product (heart rate x SBP) were reduced only in the labetalol group; the difference between the labetalol and prazosin groups was significant (P less than 0.01) both at rest and during exercise. This haemodynamic profile of labetalol may be important in selecting a vasodilating antihypertensive for patients with concomitant ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "49": "The origin of the relative bradycardia found in athletes and in chronically exercised animals is still controversial. To further investigate the role of the autonomic nervous system in exercise bradycardia three groups of Sprague-Dawley rats performed swimming exercises daily for 1.5 hr for a total of 45 hrs. The contribution of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems to the resultant bradycardia was elucidated by differential autonomic blockade using propranolol hydrochloride and atropine sulphate respectively. This procedure permits the determination of the intrinsic heart rates so that it is possible to observe the contributions of the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system in exercise bradycardia. The results showed that both sympathetic and parasympathetic tones of the trained rats were reduced, being respectively 13% and 5% lower than the control groups. It was concluded that the reduction in heart rate in trained rats was mainly due to a reduction in the sympathetic tone.", 
    "50": "The aim of the present study was to ascertain, on the basis of single case statistics and time-series analysis, responder and non-responder rates for metoprolol, propranolol and nifedipine in migraine prophylaxis. In addition, an attempt was made to identify the dose relationship for the various drugs on headache parameters. In a double-blind dose-finding study, 58 patients were treated in five consecutive dosage steps each lasting 1-3 months. All patients kept a headache diary before, during and after treatment. Serum drug levels were also determined. The data were assessed by time-series analysis, as well as by multiple regression and analysis of variance. A significant improvement was noted in 54.4% of patients with migraine during treatment with metoprolol. The study did not confirm the high success rates in migraine prophylaxis of nifedipine and propranolol quoted in the literature. Administration of nifedipine led to an increase in migraine attacks in 71% of the patients. Nifedipine was of no value in the prophylaxis of migraine. Only 32% of patients showed a reduction in frequency of migraine attacks during administration of propranolol. The analysis of variance failed to show any significant difference between the responder rates for metoprolol and propranolol. Higher doses of propranolol and metoprolol were more effective. Multiple regression analysis explained a considerable part of variance for propranolol (but not for metoprolol) as a result of reduced intake of ergotamine preparations and analgesics. It can therefore be concluded that part of the prophylactic effect of propranolol is attributable to a reduction in the use of migraine medication.", 
    "51": "After screening a local population in the northern part of The Netherlands for hypertension, 125 patients (116 of whom had not previously used antihypertensive drugs) with a five times elevated diastolic pressure (DP) of between 95 and 130 mmHg were randomized and treated daily either with atenolol 50 mg o.d. (n = 62) or with captopril 25 mg b.i.d. (n = 63) for 2 months under double-blind conditions. During this period the DP fell by 9 mm under atenolol (from 107 +/- 8 to 98 +/- 8) and by 8 mm under captopril (from 107 +/- 7 to 99 +/- 9). The number of responders with a DP = less than 90 mmHg was 21% and 20%, respectively. After 2 months the double-blind period was ended and the patients were submitted to a medication protocol for another 4 months in which an increased dose and additional nifedipine were given to non-responders. The response rate rose to 76% (atenolol/nifedipine combination) and to 60% (captopril/nifedipine combination) - NS. It is concluded that low doses of atenolol and captopril are equally effective in lowering blood pressure in uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "52": "In this study we present evidence that lipolysis in man is under beta-2 adrenergic control and that beta-2 stimulation produces a characteristic profile of individual free fatty acid (FFA) release. Twelve healthy volunteers received infusions of placebo (N Saline), terbutaline (a selective beta-2 agonist) and dilevalol (a new non-selective beta-blocker with beta-2 agonist activity). Plasma FFA concentrations during and after the infusions were measured using gas chromatography. A significant rise in total and individual FFAs was seen after 30 min of terbutaline infusion. This was most marked for oleic acid. Total and individual FFA concentrations also rose after 30 min of dilevalol infusion; this was only significant for oleic acid and was approximately 15% of the rise induced by terbutaline infusion. Placebo infusion did not cause any significant changes in FFA levels.", 
    "53": "An arterial and venous blood (or plasma) concentration difference of drugs across the lung of rats was evaluated based on the recirculatory concept. The recirculatory system is given by the combination of the transfer functions for the pulmonary and the systemic circulations and is described by a Laplace-transformed equation, i.e., an image equation. For the manipulation of the image equations, the fast inverse Laplace transform (FILT) was adopted and MULTI(FILT) was used for the simultaneous curve fitting to estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters in the recirculatory model. Metoprolol as a test drug and cephalexin as a control drug were infused respectively into the femoral vein for 30 min, and arterial and venous blood samples were collected simultaneously through the cannula at the femoral artery and at right atrium during and after the infusion. Exponential functions were assumed for the weight functions through both the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Results of the curve fitting showed that the single-pass extraction ratio through the pulmonary circulation (Ep) of metoprolol was about 0.2, whereas that of cephalexin was negligible. The mean transit times through the pulmonary circulation (tp) of metoprolol and cephalexin were both about 0.5 min, which is small. The single-pass extraction ratios through the systemic circulation (Es) of metoprolol and cephalexin were both about 0.1, and the mean transit times through the systemic circulation (ts) were 11.5 min and 8.2 min, respectively.",

In 12 animals subjected to 5, 10, and 15 min (random order) of dry gas isocapnic hyperpnea [tidal volume (VT) 4-6 ml, 150 breaths/min) followed by quiet breathing of humidified air (VT 2-3 ml, 60 breaths/min), severe bronchoconstriction developed only after the cessation of hyperpnea; the magnitude of respiratory system resistance (Rrs) increased with the duration of dry gas hyperpnea [peak Rrs 1.0 +/- 0.2, 1.8 +/- 0.3, and 2.3 +/- 0.3 (SE) cmH2O.ml-1.s, respectively]. Seven other guinea pigs received, in random order, 10 min of warm humidified gas hyperpnea, 10 min of room temperature dry gas hyperpnea, and 5 min of dry gas hyperpnea immediately followed by 5 min of warm humidified gas hyperpnea. After each hyperpnea period, the animal was returned to quiet breathing of humidified gas. Rrs rose appreciably after the 10 min of dry and 5 min of dry-5 min of humidified hyperpnea challenges (peak Rrs 1.3 +/- 0.2 and 0.7 +/- 0.2 cmH2O.ml-1.s, respectively) but not after 10 min of humidified hyperpnea (0.2 +/- 0.04 cmH2O.ml-1.s).

    "55": "1. The role of the macula densa in renin synthesis was studied using mice with one hydronephrotic kidney. 2. Renin synthesis was assessed by measurement of renal renin, renal mRNA for renin and plasma renin. 3. Sodium depletion stimulated mRNA and renal renin to a similar extent in the hydronephrotic and contralateral kidney. 4. Enalapril stimulated mRNA concentration in both kidneys but renal renin did not rise in the hydronephrotic kidney. 5. Propranolol did not alter the response to sodium depletion in either kidney. 6. The macula densa is not crucial for the stimulation of renin synthesis following sodium depletion. However, it may regulate renin production after mRNA synthesis, possibly by controlling the conversion of prorenin to renin.",

Pretreatment, (a) vs (d), significant elevations (12-h mean +/- SD) were observed in the concentrations of noradrenaline (44.9 +/- 14.4 vs 2.3 +/- 0.7 nmol/l, P less than 0.01), glucose (6.9 +/- 1.9 vs 5.0 +/- 1.0 mmol/l, P less than 0.05), glycerol (0.22 +/- 0.02 vs 0.07 +/- 0.01 mmol/l, P less than 0.01), non-esterified fatty acids (0.71 +/- 0.28 vs 0.34 +/- 0.08 mmol/l, P less than 0.01), and total ketone bodies (0.08 +/- 0.03 vs 0.03 +/- 0.02 mmol/l, P less than 0.01). Alpha-blockade, (b) vs (a), was associated with an increase in noradrenaline levels (P less than 0.01) but not with any significant alterations in intermediary metabolite concentrations. Following the establishment of combined alpha and beta-blockade, (c) vs (b), plasma noradrenaline returned to its pretreatment level while the concentrations of glycerol, fatty acids and ketone bodies were normalized. A completely physiological 12-h blood glucose profile, however, was observed only post-operatively. No significant differences were observed in mean plasma insulin levels between the four studies. These results indicate impaired regulation of multiple aspects of carbohydrate, lipid and ketone body metabolism in our patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "57": "In a randomized primary prevention trial including 3,234 men with mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension, the effect of the beta-blocker metoprolol or a thiazide diuretic as an initial antihypertensive therapy was compared regarding the risk of sudden cardiovascular death during a follow-up ranging from 2.3 to 10.8 years (median of 4.2 years). Only men aged 40 to 64 years were included in the study. The randomization of patients into the metoprolol (n = 1,609) or diuretic group (n = 1,625) was performed after stratification for age, smoking habits, serum cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure. At baseline the two treatment groups were well matched. Metoprolol was given in a mean dose of 174 mg daily and the mean dose of thiazide diuretic was either 46 mg hydrochlorothiazide daily or 4.4 mg bendroflumethiazide daily. Identical blood pressure control was achieved using the fixed therapeutic schedule. Total and cardiovascular mortality were significantly lower for metoprolol than for diuretics, owing to fewer deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke. Of the cardiovascular deaths, 78% were classified as sudden cardiovascular deaths (occurred within 24 h after the onset of symptoms). There were significantly fewer sudden cardiovascular deaths in the metoprolol group compared to the diuretic group (32 v 45, P = .017). The present results suggest that initial antihypertensive therapy with metoprolol is associated with a lesser incidence of sudden cardiovascular deaths than initial diuretic treatment in uncomplicated hypertension.", 
    "58": "The heart rate response to vagal stimulation and the interaction with sympathetic activity was evaluated in conscious dogs at rest and during exercise; the latter was used as a tool to physiologically elevate sympathetic activity. In 20 dogs with a healed myocardial infarction and in 7 healthy dogs a bipolar electrode was chronically implanted around the right cervical vagus. Vagal stimulation (3 ms; 2.1 +/- 0.7 mA; 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 Hz) was performed while dogs stood on the treadmill (heart rate 120 +/- 25 beats/min) and while they exercised (201 +/- 17 beats/min). Gradual increases of the frequency of vagal stimulation gradually enhanced the inhibitory effect on heart rate both before and during exercise. During exercise, heart rate reduction was significantly greater than that produced at rest at any frequency of stimulation (P less than 0.001). This difference widened as the frequency of stimulation increased and the interaction with or without the presence of exercise was significant (P less than 0.02). Vagal stimulation produced similar effects in the seven dogs without myocardial infarction. These data demonstrate that the vagal-sympathetic \"accentuated antagonism\" described in anesthetized animals is also present in conscious dogs.",

After completing a 4-week placebo phase, 79 elderly (65 years or older) patients with an average standing diastolic blood pressure (BP) 95 mm Hg or above and 114 mm Hg or less were randomized to receive a 12-week course of either labetalol or enalapril in an open-label design. The patients' BP and heart rate were evaluated biweekly by trained observers unaware of the treatment status, and drug dosage was titrated (up to 400 mg twice a day of labetalol or 40 mg daily of enalapril) to achieve a standing diastolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg and a decrease of 10 mm Hg from baseline. Patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) at the end of the placebo phase and again after 8 weeks of active treatment.",

Labetalol demonstrated a significantly greater reduction (p less than 0.05) in standing diastolic BP at the end of the titration period compared to enalapril, but this difference was not significant by the end of the study period. Based on 24-hour ABPM readings, labetalol reduced mean 24-hour diastolic BP (p less than 0.05) and mean heart rate (p less than 0.05) more than enalapril. The labetalol-treated patients were significantly less often above their diastolic BP goal throughout the 24-hour ABPM period (p less than 0.01). The two treatments were equally well tolerated.",

    "63": "The pulsatile ocular blood flow (POBF) has been recorded in 15 patients with chronic open angle glaucoma. Measurements were performed during regular treatment with timolol 0.25% eyedrops, two weeks after withdrawal of this treatment, and then a further two weeks after its reinstitution. Readings were taken with subjects in both the erect and supine positions by means of a pneumotonometric probe to measure intraocular pressure (IOP), linked to a Langham ocular blood flow system. Assumption of the supine posture was associated with a significant increase in IOP in all phases of the study. Treatment with timolol lowered the mean IOP in comparison with the untreated phase (-4.4 (SEM 0.6) mmHg, p less than 0.001) but had no effect on the postural change. A significant reduction in POBF was recorded on assumption of the supine posture (-66 (SEM 18) microliters/min, p less than 0.001), representing a mean decrement of 19%. However, there were no significant differences in POBF between treated and untreated phases of the study. Comparison of the values obtained in patients with glaucoma (COAG) after withdrawal of treatment with those in subjects with ocular hypertension revealed that there was no significant difference in intraocular pressure between the two groups. However, both POBF (-68 (SEM 29) microliters/min) and the pulse amplitude of the intraocular pressure (ocular pulse: -0.45 (SEM) 0.14 mmHg) were significantly lower in the COAG patients. Pulsatile ocular blood flow is significantly lower in patients with chronic open angle glaucoma. Furthermore, the POBF and the postural response of these patients is not improved by the use of topical timolol therapy.", 
    "64": "To study the demographic and clinical correlates of essential tremor (ET), we analyzed a comprehensive database of 350 patients evaluated at the Movement Disorders Clinic at Baylor College of Medicine from 1982 to 1989. The age at onset of tremor showed bimodal distribution for both male and female patients, with peaks in 2nd and 6th decades. ET appeared most frequently in hands, followed by head, voice, tongue, leg, and trunk. Half of the patients (47%) had associated dystonia, including cervical dystonia, writer's cramp, spasmodic dysphonia, and cranial dystonia, and 20% of the patients had associated parkinsonism. At least one 1st-degree relative of 62.5% of ET patients reported tremor. Alcohol relieved tremor in 2/3 of ET patients. Sixty-eight percent of patients who had adequate follow-up improved with propranolol, and 72% with primidone. There was no significant difference in various clinical variables between the 219 patients with familial ET and 131 with sporadic ET. Patients with early-onset ET were more likely to have hand involvement and associated dystonia than patients with late-onset ET. Dystonia was more frequently associated with mild ET than with severe ET. Patients with low-frequency tremor were older and had more head but less hand involvement than patients with high-frequency tremor. The lack of relevant differences between ET subgroups suggests that, despite variable expression, ET represents a single disease entity.", 
    "65": "We studied the effect of cooling on the responses of isolated human airways to the beta-agonist isoproterenol, the alpha/beta-agonist norepinephrine in the presence of the beta-blocker timolol, methacholine, leukotriene C4 (LTC4), and histamine. In addition, the effect of cooling on baseline airway tone and responses to electric field stimulation (EFS) was studied. At 27 degrees C the sensitivity (-logEC50) and maximal response to isoproterenol were unchanged. No measurable response was found to alpha-adrenergic stimulation with norepinephrine + timolol either before or during cooling. At 27 degrees C and 21 degrees C the sensitivity and maximal contraction to methacholine and LTC4 as well as the contraction to a single dose of histamine were reduced. Cooling diminished baseline airway tone. EFS produced a rapid cholinergic contraction followed by a deflection below baseline and a sustained noncholinergic contractile response, which was substantially reduced by the LTC4/D4 receptor antagonist FPL 55712 (11.5 microM) at all three temperatures. Cooling decreased the cholinergic response to EFS and increased the sensitivity to EFS-induced relaxation. In contrast, the sustained noncholinergic contractile response to EFS was not changed, suggesting that cooling facilitates the synthesis of LTC4/D4 that follows EFS and/or inhibits its inactivation. We conclude that in nonasthmatic, isolated human airways slow cooling of the airway wall down to 21 degrees C does not cause bronchoconstriction and does not increase the responsiveness to contractile or relaxing agonists. However, cooling increases the sensitivity to EFS-induced relaxation and might facilitate the accumulation of leukotriene C4/D4 in the airway wall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "66": "Gonadotrophs are known to possess voltage-sensitive Na channels. We used two experimental systems, proestrous rat anterior pituitary tissue superfusion and 17 beta-estradiol-treated rat anterior pituitary cells in primary culture, to examine the effect of Na channel inhibition on LH secretion. We found that a blocker of voltage-sensitive Na channels, tetrodotoxin (TTX), significantly augments LHRH- and elevated extracellular [K+]-induced LH secretion 20-90%. The augmentation of LHRH-induced secretion was demonstrable for both experimental systems and was independent of the time of TTX exposure. These results differ from previous studies in which TTX was without effect or was found to inhibit LH secretion. These discrepancies may be explained, in part, by the demonstration that TTX augmentation requires relatively low TTX concentrations (10(-6)-10(-8) M) and is not demonstrable at higher concentrations, requires submaximal LHRH concentrations (10(-10)-10(-9) M), and requires exposure of cultured cells to 17 beta-estradiol. The site of TTX action could be either directly on gonadotroph voltage-sensitive Na channels or indirect via modulation of Na channels of a paracrine modulator of gonadotroph function. The mechanism by which TTX Na channel blockade augments secretagogue-induced LH secretion is unknown; however, the data are interpreted as favoring direct action of TTX on the gonadotroph, with Na channel blockade affecting a site or sites common to both LHRH and elevated extracellular [K+]. Whether the inhibition of Na channels is one of the several effects of LHRH-receptor interaction remains to be determined.", 
    "67": "To investigate the role of the autonomic nervous system in changes in blood volume and composition induced by acute hypoglycaemia in man, seven healthy subjects participated in three experiments on separate days: insulin-induced hypoglycaemia with concomitant alpha-adrenoceptor blockade; insulin-induced hypoglycaemia with total autonomic blockade (alpha-adrenoceptor blockade combined with beta-adrenoceptor blockade and atropine); and insulin-induced hypoglycaemia without any autonomic blockade. In the experiments without autonomic blockade the peripheral venous hematocrit increased, plasma volume decreased, intravascular albumin content decreased and the transcapillary escape rate of albumin increased. In both experiments with autonomic blockade the increase in venous haematocrit was abolished, yet plasma volume decreased, intravascular albumin content decreased and the transcapillary escape rate of albumin increased in these experiments. Thus, the changes in plasma volume and composition in response to hypoglycaemia are due to the combined actions of adrenaline and of insulin.", 
    "68": "The Cardiac Antiarrhythmic Suppression Trial (CAST) showed flecainide and encainide induced excess mortality compared with placebo. Labeling drugs as Class 1C is based on clinical observations, comprising measurements of the electrocardiographic parameters QRS. H-V and J-T intervals and of effective refractory period (ERP) as follows: 1--(QRS) wide, 2--(HV) long, 3--(ERP) unchanged, 4--(JT) unchanged. In vitro electrophysiology helped to explain the clinical findings. Flecainide and encainide rendered Na channels as nonconducting, but F and E were only slowly released from the channels after repolarization. At any given drug concentration, a proportion of total channels were eliminated, and the steady-state proportion increased at rising heart rate. It is not proven that the properties that lead to classification of a drug as 1C were those that caused excess deaths in the CAST. The proarrhythmic tendency of 1C drugs can be reduced by beta-blockade, and the mechanisms of adrenergic arrhythmogenicity are discussed. Propafenone is both a 1C drug and a beta-blocker, and its pharmacologic profile is reviewed to illustrate how it resembles and differs from flecainide and encainide. Some features of the CAST are assessed with particular reference to the extent to which conclusions drawn from the results may be justifiably extrapolated to other drugs classified as 1C.", 
    "69": "The effects of Ca2+ channel blockers on two modes of G protein-mediated pharmacomechanical coupling, Ca2+ release and modulation of Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus, were investigated. Smooth muscles were permeabilized with Staphylococcal alpha-toxin or with beta-escin to avoid effects due to block of sarcolemmal Ca2+ channels, while retaining receptor/G protein coupling. In permeabilized portal vein smooth muscle, verapamil and nifedipine inhibited Ca2+ release induced by an alpha 1-adrenergic agonist (phenylephrine) and by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S), but not that induced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). These Ca2+ channel blockers also did not block the phenylephrine- or GTP gamma S-induced force development at constant cytoplasmic Ca2+ (\"Ca2+ sensitization\"). An alpha 1-blocker (prazosin) inhibited both the Ca2(+)-releasing and Ca2(+)-sensitizing effects of phenylephrine, but not those of GTP gamma S, nor did it block InsP3-induced Ca2+ release. We conclude that Ca2+ channel blockers selectively uncouple the Ca2(+)-releasing, but not the Ca2(+)-sensitizing, component of pharmacomechanical coupling. These findings raise the possibility that pharmacomechanical Ca2+ release may be modulated by dihydropyridine binding proteins at the level of G proteins/phospholipase C and also indicate a divergence of the Ca2(+)-releasing and Ca2(+)-sensitizing effects at some step prior to phospholipase C.", 
    "70": "Graded maximal treadmill exercise responses were studied before and after beta blockade (atenolol 100 mg once daily for 2 weeks) in 20 male patients with chronic stable angina. Beta-blocking effect consisted of significant reduction of resting heart rate (HR) by 21%, systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 12% and rate pressure product (RPP) by 30%. While the maximum exercise capacity was marginally increased by mean 1.7 min +/- 1.6 SD (P less than 0.001) under the influence of therapy, peak HR, SBP and maximum RPP were significantly lower (P less than 0.001) than in preatenolol exercise tests. Similarly, while the configuration and magnitude of ST segment depression did not differ materially between the pre and post atenolol tests, onset time of ST change was delayed and offset time shortened significantly. These parameters cannot be relied upon to assess the extent and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) if stress test is carried out while the patient is on a beta-blocking drug. The overall sensitivity of the stress test to detect coronary disease is, however, not likely to be compromised because of negligible influence of beta-blockers upon ST segment depression provided maximally tolerated (not submaximal) exercise is performed. ST/HR slope, an exercise test variable known to correlate well with the extent of CAD, was shown to be uninfluenced by beta-blockade. Its measurement is therefore recommended in interpreting stress tests performed in patients receiving beta-blocker therapy. This, however, requires a meticulously prepared protocol of recording computer averaged QRST complexes and multilead ECG tracings at very frequent intervals throughout the exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Ultrasound and rheography investigations were employed to elucidate the relations between portal and pulmonary hypertension in cirrhosis patients. Criteria of early diagnosis are discussed. Nitrosorbide++ produced positive effect on hepatic blood flow, corinfar improved pulmonary hemodynamics in lack of its influence on hepatic blood flow, while propranolol resulted in the drop of both portal and pulmonary hypertension, normalization of general hemodynamics.", 
    "72": "For the study of genetic and physiological mechanisms of inherited stress-sensitive arterial hypertension, specific binding of ligands of alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors was measured in 2 strains of rats: Wistar normotensive and ISSAH rats (rats with inherited stress-sensitive arterial hypertension). The maximal binding sites (Bmax) and apparent dissociation constants (Kd) were studied with the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist 3H-prazosin, alpha 2-adrenergic agonist 3H-clonidine and 3H-dihydroalprenolol, a beta 1-receptor antagonist. Four brain regions were investigated: frontal cortex, hypothalamus, pons and medulla oblongata. In comparison with normotensive controls, hypertensive rats had significantly greater density of the alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the medulla oblongata. However, the number of hypothalamic alpha 1-adrenoceptors was significantly reduced in these animals. The same significantly lower alpha 2-adrenoreceptor density was found in the hypothalamus and the pons, and lower, beta-adrenoceptors density in the medulla oblongata. It was concluded that brain adrenoceptors are involved in the mechanisms of development of inherited stress-sensitive hypertensive syndrome.", 
    "73": "The present study was designed to determine the regional hemodynamic effects of prolonged beta-adrenergic receptor inhibition in conscious stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) using a radioactive microsphere method. When the regional blood flow was compared between 10 and 30 weeks of age, the age-related changes in organ blood flow were observed in several organs, i.e., the reduction of flow rate in kidney, adrenal gland and intestines. The reduction of flow rate in these organs contributes strongly to the age-related rise of total peripheral resistance. Carteolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, was given at a dose of 10 mg/kg/d from 10 to 30 weeks of age. These animals gained more weight than the untreated control SHRSPs, and heart rate was reduced significantly. Blood pressure was not affected. However, the prolonged treatment with carteolol prevented the age-related reduction of the blood flow rate in the kidney, adrenal gland and intestines. Thus, our findings indicate that carteolol had appreciable and beneficial effects on the maintenance of flow rates in the above organs of SHRSP without any change in blood pressure.", 
    "74": "1. The chronotropic and inotropic responses of the young chick heart to noradrenaline have been investigated in isolated right atria, left atria and ventricular strips from 14-day-old chicks. 2. In the presence of desipramine and metanephrine to inhibit amine uptake, concentration-response curves to noradrenaline in all three tissues were shifted to the right by propranolol (1 microM) but were not altered by the presence of either phentolamine (5 microM) or prazosin (10 microM). 3. Similar results were obtained in the presence of cocaine (10 microM) and corticosterone (10 microM) to inhibit amine uptake. Propranolol (0.3-3.0 microM) produced rightward shifts of noradrenaline concentration-response curves which gave pA2 values of 8.1-8.4. Phentolamine (5 microM), in contrast, did not affect responses to noradrenaline in any tissue, either in the absence or presence of propranolol (1 microM). 4. Isoprenaline produced positive chronotropic responses in right atria and positive inotropic responses in left atria and ventricular strips. Methoxamine elicited positive inotropic responses in left atria but only negative chronotropic responses in right atria and negative inotropic responses in ventricular strips. 5. These results demonstrate that cardiac responses to noradrenaline in the chick heart are mediated via beta-adrenoceptors only, and that cardiac alpha-adrenoceptors are not involved in these responses.", 
    "75": "To assess the potential role of adrenoceptor-stimulated atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) release in healthy humans, 18 volunteers, divided into groups of six, underwent experiments with infusion of incremental doses of salbutamol with and without beta-blockade with propranolol, propranolol alone, and bolus injections of clonidine before and after alpha-blockade with phentolamine, and phentolamine alone. Since changes in right atrial pressure have been shown to influence ANF release, central venous pressure (CVP) was continuously measured 30 min before, during the 120 min duration of drug infusions, and for 30 min after the bolus injections of the drugs. ANF was serially determined in central venous plasma during all drug infusions, and plasma catecholamines were measured to determine any possible influence of endogenous sympathetic activation on ANF levels. Plasma ANF was unaffected by all individual drugs and drug combinations, despite significant reductions in CVP in the salbutamol, phentolamine and phentolamine + clonidine groups, and a doubling of heart rate during salbutamol administration (p less than 0.01 for all). The results do not suggest a major role for adrenoceptor-mediated ANF release in normal humans, and do not indicate that plasma ANF levels are determined by tonic inhibition or facilitation of the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "76": "1. Electrical field stimulation (10 Hz, 60 V, 1 ms, for 10 s) produced monophasic contractions of isolated preparations of rat cauda epididymis which could be abolished by guanethidine, and attenuated by prazosin and alpha, beta-methylene ATP. 2. The rank order of potency of adrenoceptor agonists in causing contraction of the preparation in the presence of the neuronal uptake blocker, nisoxetine (0.1 microM) was: adrenaline greater than or equal to phenylephrine greater than or equal to noradrenaline greater than clonidine greater than methoxamine greater than metaraminol greater than dopamine greater than or equal to isoprenaline greater than xylazine. 3. Responses to the agonists were blocked by prazosin but not by propranolol or idazoxan. 4. The rank order of potency of purinoceptor agonists in causing contraction of the cauda epididymis was: alpha,beta-methylene ATP greater than beta,gamma-methylene ATP greater than or equal to 2-methylthio ATP greater than ATP greater than ADP. AMP and adenosine did not cause contractions. 5. Contractile responses to the purine nucleotide analogues were blocked by repeated application of alpha,beta-methylene ATP. 6. It is concluded that both ATP and noradrenaline may act as co-transmitters in the sympathetic nerves supplying the smooth muscle of the rat cauda epididymis, and that alpha 1-adrenoceptors and P2x-purinoceptors are present postjunctionally.", 
    "77": "1. The responses of isolated left atria and papillary muscles to isoprenaline, forskolin and calcium have been examined in 3 week streptozotocin-diabetic rats and the effects of oral ponalrestat administration (25 mg kg-1 daily) on diabetes-induced changes in cardiac responsiveness investigated. 2. Three weeks after animals were made diabetic, cardiac responses to isoprenaline were enhanced and this was accompanied by an increase in the density of ventricular [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites. Treatment of animals with ponalrestat prevented the increase in cardiac beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness and receptor number. 3. Diabetes also enhanced the sensitivity of cardiac tissues to forskolin, an effect that was not prevented by the treatment of animals with ponalrestat. 4. Ponalrestat treatment increased the resting and maximum tensions developed by cardiac tissues from diabetic animals and increased the maximum tensions developed by tissues from control animals. Diabetes alone had no effect on resting or maximum developed tensions. 5. Ponalrestat therefore prevents the changes in beta-adrenoceptor density and responsiveness induced by short-term diabetes in the rat and also increases the tension developed by cardiac muscle, an effect observed in diabetic and normal animals.", 
    "78": "Several studies have shown that antihypertensive drugs therapy could reduce morbidity and mortality of hypertension related complication such as stroke, congestive heart failure and renal failure, but there was no significant reduction of coronary heart disease. The benefit of the treatment on morbidity and mortality may be counterbalanced by adversed metabolic effects of long-term therapy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the blood pressure-lowering and adverse metabolic effects of chlorothiazide and propranolol monotherapy. A double-blind, cross-over design clinical trial was performed for 42 cases (22 males and 20 females) with the mean age of 52 (from 30 to 59 years old). After 2 weeks run-in period, the patients were assigned to group A and B with age and sex stratification. Chlorothiazide and propranolol were given for 12 weeks in alternative with 2 weeks placebo washout period. Our studies have shown that, chlorothiazide and propranolol could reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly. But they also associated with adverse metabolic effects. Serum uric acid and triglyceride increased and decreased the concentration of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Those changes could counterbalance the benefit of blood pressure-lowering effect of antihypertension. Carefully monitoring the adverse metabolic effects closely is necessary in therapy with these drugs.", 
    "79": "Cold air exposure stimulates a rise in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and plasma norepinephrine (NE). The specific contribution of the beta-adrenergic receptor to this pressor response is unknown. Therefore, we pretreated 12 normal men with placebo or a bradycardia-inducing amount of propranolol prior to exposing them to either 25 degrees C or 4 degrees C air. At 25 degrees C, propranolol pretreatment lowered heart rate (HR) and MAP. When we compared changes in MAP after their respective 30-min exposure at 25 degrees C and 4 degrees C, the cold elevated MAP by 18.4 +/- 1.5 mm Hg in subjects pretreated with propranolol compared with 13.0 +/- 2.5 mm Hg in subjects pretreated with placebo. Fingertip skin temperature (Tfing) measured at 4 degrees C, 9.5 +/- 0.8 degrees C in propranolol-pretreated subjects was lower than the 11.1 +/- 0.7 degrees C with that of placebo. Plasma NE increased equally during cold exposure with both placebo and propranolol pretreatment. We conclude that the beta receptor plays a minor role in generating the pressor response to cold air. Therefore, the effectiveness of acute administrations of propranolol for maintaining normotension in subjects exposed to cold environments may be attenuated.", 
    "80": "Receptor autoradiography using (-)-3-[125I]cyanopindolol and [3H]prazosin was used to study the distribution of beta and alpha-1 adrenoceptors in the rat uterus at early and midpregnancy. The binding of [3H]prazosin to slide-mounted sections at 25 degrees C was time dependent (K1 = 3.01 x 10(7) M-1 min-1, K2 = -0.0116 min-1) and saturable (1 nM). Competition binding curves with the selective alpha-1 and alpha-2 antagonists (prazosin, yohimbine) or alpha-1 and alpha-2 agonists (phenylephrine, clonidine) showed the presence of alpha-1 adrenoceptors; autoradiographic studies revealed that this subtype is highly localized in the circular layer of the myometrium during pregnancy. (-)-3-[125I]Cyanopindolol binding to slide-mounted sections of the pregnant uterus at 25 degrees C was time dependent (K1 = 4.68 x 10(8) M-1 min-1, K2 = -0.0117 min-1) and saturable (200 pM). Competition binding curves with beta-1 or beta-2 selective agonists (dobutamine, metaproterenol) and antagonists (atenolol, ICI 118,551) revealed the presence of beta adrenoceptors in the proportion of 67% beta-2 to 33% beta-1. Hyperfilm exposed to sections of the whole pregnant uterus incubated with (-)-3-[125I]cyanopindolol with or without ICI 118,551 or atenolol showed a high density of beta-2 adrenoceptors in the longitudinal layer of the myometrium and in the placenta. A small density of beta-2 adrenoceptors was also located in the decidua basalis on day 8 of pregnancy.", 
    "81": "It has been suggested that 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin)-containing neurons influence the regulation of central beta adrenoceptors caused by antidepressants. [3H]Dihydroalprenolol ( [3H] DHA) was the radioligand used in these previous studies to measure beta adrenoceptors. In this study, we compared the binding characteristics of [3H]DHA with those of [125I]iodopindolol ( [125I]PIN) and used [125I]IPIN to study effects of lesioning serotonergic nerves on the regulation of beta adrenoceptors. A comparison was made in homogenates prepared from rat frontal cortex of the specific binding of [3H]DHA with that of [125I]IPIN to beta adrenoceptors. Nonlinear regression analysis of saturation experiments of [3H]DHA binding to cortical homogenates indicated that a two-component binding model fit the data significantly better than a one-component model. A dissociation constant value of 0.47 +/- 0.16 nM and a Bmax value of 62 +/- 7 fmol/mg protein were obtained for the high-affinity site. The low-affinity site was poorly defined. Rosenthal transformations of the saturation isotherms for [3H]DHA binding were clearly curvilinear. By contrast, nonlinear regression analysis of saturation experiments of the binding of [125I]IPIN indicated that the binding of this radioligand was described adequately by a one-component model and yielded a dissociation constant value of 147 +/- 10 pM with a Bmax of 80 +/- 5 fmol/mg protein. Rosenthal transformations of the [125I]IPIN data were linear. From such data, it was inferred that [3H]DHA binds to some site in addition to beta adrenoceptors, whereas [125I]IPIN does not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "82": "Studies in animals have shown that drug-induced action potential prolongation with class III antiarrhythmic agents increases with slow pacing rates. We studied the physiological rate dependence of sotalol effects on ventricular repolarization, measured as QT interval duration on the surface electrocardiogram at rest and during a maximal exercise test, in 10 normal volunteers. In a randomized, crossover study, three dosages of sotalol (160 mg/24 hr, 320 mg/24 hr, and 640 mg/24 hr) were administered during 4 days to each subject. In a control period, no drug was administered. During each period, 50-100 QT intervals were measured over a wide range of RR intervals recorded at rest and during the course of a maximal exercise test. Plasma sotalol concentration and beta-adrenoceptor blockade (percent reduction in peak exercise heart rate from control) were also measured. The QT-versus-RR relation was fitted to several formulas, and the overall best fit was used to calculate QT interval duration normalized for a heart rate of 60 beats/min (QTc) and to analyze the rate dependence of QT prolongation with sotalol. Sotalol-induced beta-adrenoceptor blockade and QTc prolongation were dose and concentration dependent. Sotalol reduced peak exercise heart rate by 13.8 +/- 7% at the dosage of 320 mg/24 hr and by 25.4 +/- 8% at the dosage of 640 mg/24 hr (both p less than 0.01). Sotalol prolonged QTc interval by 5.8 +/- 3.7% and 11.8 +/- 3% at these respective dosages (both p less than 0.01). The concentration of sotalol required to produce minimal (mean QTc prolongation, 5.6%; confidence interval, 0-11.2%) QTc prolongation (680 ng/ml) tended to be lower than that required for minimal (mean percent reduction in maximal exercise heart rate, 13.9%; confidence interval, 0-27.8%) beta-blockade (840 ng/ml). QT prolongation with sotalol increased with increasing RR intervals (i.e., decreasing heart rate) at all dosages. QT prolongation became statistically significant for RR of 800 msec or more at all dosages and for RR intervals of 600 msec or more at the dosage of 640 mg/24 hr. This rate dependence altered the relation between QT interval duration and sotalol plasma concentrations. These results suggest that sotalol prolongs QTc interval in humans at dosages and concentrations similar to those required to produce beta-adrenoceptor blockade, QT prolongation with sotalol is more pronounced when heart rate decreases and is not apparent during exercise-induced tachycardia, and the relation between QT prolongation with sotalol and plasma concentrations of the drug depends on the heart rate at which measurements are made.", 
    "83": "We have observed that serum potassium levels measured immediately before induction of anesthesia (\"preinduction K+\") are often lower than those measured 1-3 days preoperatively (\"preoperative K+\"). The purpose of this investigation was to determine, in two studies, the magnitude of this difference and to elucidate the mechanism by which this occurs. In the first study, preinduction K+ (3.6 +/- 0.4 mEq/L, mean +/- SD) was significantly lower than K+ levels measured during routine preoperative testing (4.4 +/- 0.4 mEq/L, n = 47, P less than 0.001). Twenty-three patients (49%) had preinduction K+ levels that were considered hypokalemic (less than or equal to 3.5 mEq/L), but 22 of these 23 patients had normal preoperative K+ levels. The second study tested the hypothesis that preinduction decreases in serum K+ are mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Preinduction K+ changes were determined in patients given a single preoperative dose of propranolol (beta 1/beta 2-antagonist), atenolol (beta 1-antagonist), or no beta-blocker (control). The difference between preoperative and preinduction serum K+ in patients receiving propranolol (0.1 +/- 0.4 mEq/L) was significantly attenuated (P less than 0.02) compared with the difference in control subjects (0.5 +/- 0.4 mEq/L), but was not significantly different from controls in patients pretreated with atenolol (0.3 +/- 0.4 mEq/L). These results demonstrate that serum K+ levels measured intraoperatively just before anesthetic induction are consistently and significantly less than those measured 1-3 days preoperatively. The ability of propranolol but not atenolol to block this change suggests that the acute decrease in K+ levels was due to beta 2-adrenergic receptor stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "84": "Twenty-six hypertensive patients took part in an open, randomized, parallel-group pilot study of the effects of a nine-week treatment period with the calcium antagonist isradipine and the beta 1-blocking agent atenolol. The mean dosage in the isradipine group was 7.9 +/- 3.5 mg/day, and 69.2 +/- 43.5 mg/day in the atenolol group. A significant reduction of the arterial blood pressure was seen with both treatment regimens. Lung volumes and airways resistance remained unchanged, but, in the atenolol-treated group, the linear relationship between alveolar pressure and airways resistance at the lower lung volumes during forced expiration at 25% of forced vital capacity was affected by a shift to higher airways resistance. This change can be interpreted as an early sign of altered air-flow behavior in the small airways in subjects susceptible to beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The calcium antagonist isradipine did not produce changes in any parameters of lung function in this group of patients.", 
    "85": "After a placebo run-in phase of four weeks' duration, 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg isradipine twice daily orally was administered for one year to 23 patients who had been diagnosed as hypertensive. Good control of blood pressure was recorded in the majority of patients until the third month of treatment. After five months, it was necessary to add a beta-blocker to the treatment regimens of some of the patients in order to maintain the target blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg. Patients were exercise-tested using bicycle ergometry. After three months, diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower during exercise when comparing the treatment values with those taken at the end of the placebo run-in (baseline values). Values for systolic blood pressure did not differ between treatment and baseline. These results may be explained by the decrease in peripheral vascular resistance produced by isradipine. After one year, the results were modified by the administration of the beta-blocker bopindolol (Sandonorm, Sandoz Pharma Ltd., Basle, Switzerland). Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels did not change during treatment. Triglycerides were lower after three months, but slightly higher after one year, with an average value lying within the normal range. The influence of isradipine on plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone levels was followed by measuring values at rest and during exercise. It was found that PRA was higher during the first three months, then inversely inhibited to lower levels. Aldosterone levels were also increased after three months, but without a subsequent decrease. The results are compared with those obtained with diltiazem in a similar treatment regimen.", 
    "86": "The management of essential hypertension requires therapeutic selections that are not only effective in reducing diastolic blood pressure but are also tailored to the individual patient, with minimal effect on patient demographics, concurrent illnesses, and cardiovascular risk factors. Celiprolol hydrochloride is a new highly cardioselective vasodilating beta-adrenoceptor antagonist that has been proven effective and safe for the treatment of essential hypertension. It is comparable to other therapies in blood pressure control while demonstrating an excellent safety profile, favorable hemodynamic activity, and minimal effects on other cardiovascular risk factors. Celiprolol may offer the physician a unique therapeutic alternative."
