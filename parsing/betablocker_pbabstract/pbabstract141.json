Labrasol, Transcutol, polyethylene glycol 400, propylene glycol, ethanol, oleic acid, isopropyl myristate, and phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 40% v/v polyethylene glycol 400 as control, were used as vehicles; limonene, carvone, camphor, menthol, Transcutol, and Labrasol at 5% w/v concentrations were used as penetration enhancers. Skin permeation studies were conducted in Franz diffusion cells using excised porcine ear skin. Solubility was highest (369.13 mg/mL) in Transcutol, whereas isopropyl myristate showed the lowest solubility (0.79 mg/mL) among all the vehicles. The flux of carvedilol from Transcutol, Labrasol, polyethylene glycol 400, ethanol, and oleic acid was 10.5, 8.6, 4.2, 2.9, and 1.5 times higher, respectively, than that observed with control. The flux obtained using Transcutol was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the flux obtained using the other vehicles. However, the flux values of carvedilol using isopropyl myristate (P < 0.01) and propylene glycol (P < 0.05) were significantly lower than that of the control. Solutions containing 5% w/v camphor showed maximum permeation (232.54 microg) in 24 h with a flux of 3.19 microg/cm2/h, which was significantly different (P < 0.05) than the flux obtained using other permeation enhancers.

    "20": "Chronic regular use of beta(2)-adrenoceptor (beta(2)-AR) agonists in asthma is associated with a loss of disease control and increased risk of death. Conversely, we have found that administration of beta(2)-AR inverse agonists results in attenuation of the asthma phenotype in an allergen-driven murine model. Besides antagonizing agonist-induced signaling and reducing signaling by empty receptors, beta-AR inverse agonists can also activate signaling by novel pathways. To determine the mechanism of the beta-AR inverse agonists, we compared the asthma phenotype in beta(2)-AR-null and wild-type mice. Antigen challenge of beta(2)-AR-null mice produced results similar to what was observed with chronic beta(2)-AR inverse agonist treatment, namely, reductions in mucous metaplasia, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and inflammatory cells in the lungs. These results indicate that the effects of beta(2)-AR inverse agonists are caused by inhibition of beta(2)-AR signaling rather than by the induction of novel signaling pathways. Chronic administration of alprenolol, a beta-blocker without inverse agonist properties, did not attenuate the asthma phenotype, suggesting that it is signaling by empty receptors, rather than agonist-induced beta(2)-AR signaling, that supports the asthma phenotype. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that, in a murine model of asthma, beta(2)-AR signaling is required for the full development of three cardinal features of asthma: mucous metaplasia, AHR, and the presence of inflammatory cells in the lungs.", 
    "21": "Aortic dissection is an uncommon but a highly lethal condition. Dissection of the ascending aorta is associated with a mortality rate of 1-2% per hour within the first 24h and should be managed by an open surgery. An uncomplicated, acute, type B dissection, which should be treated medically, is less frequently lethal, with survival rates of 84% within 1 year. Unfortunately, long-term outcome of medical therapy alone is suboptimal, with a reported 30-50% mortality rate at 5 years and a delayed expansion of the false lumen in 20-50% of patients at 4 years. In this setting, endovascular treatment should be considered when the aortic diameter exceeds 55-60mm, in case of uncontrolled pain, blood pressure and rapid growth of the dissecting aneurysm (>1cm per year). About 30-42% of acute, type B aortic dissections are complicated, as evidenced by haemodynamic instability or peripheral vascular ischaemia with a mortality rate of 50-85% if not treated properly. In this scenario, stent-graft repair is an attractive alternative to surgical repair for correcting ischaemic complications. The long-term therapy of patients with aortic dissection includes aggressive medical therapy, follow-up visits and serial imaging.", 
    "22": "KCl (40 mM) caused reproducible relaxations in frog esophagus. N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG; 1-100 microM), a steriospecific inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), completely inhibited the relaxations induced by KCl but not those induced by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) antagonist. The inhibitory effect of L-NOARG was prevented by L-arginine (L-ARG; 0.1-1 mM), the precursor of nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis, but not by D-arginine (D-ARG; 0.1-0.5 mM), the enantiomer of L-arginine. L-ARG or D-ARG alone did not significantly modify the effect of KCl. The relaxations to KCl were significantly inhibited by omega conotoxin (omega-conotoxin; 0.1 microM), a selective blocker of N-type calcium channels. Propranolol (0.1-1 microM), a nonselective blocker of beta-adrenergic receptors, prazosine (0.01-0.1 microM), a selective blocker of alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors, phentolamine (0.1-1 microM), a nonselective blocker of adrenergic receptors, atropine, a selective blocker of muscarinic cholinergic receptors, and lidocaine (1-10 microM), a blocker of sodium channels, had no effect on KCl-evoked relaxations. Caffeine (500 microM), an intracellular calcium releasing agent, did not significantly modify the effect of KCl. In contrast, ruthenium red (100 microM), a selective blocker of ryanodine receptors (intracellular Ca(2+) channels), significantly inhibited these relaxations. Similarly, potassium channel blockers such as 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; 100 microM) and tetraethylammonium (TEA; 100 microM) caused a significant inhibition on relaxations to KCl. In addition, ouabain (100 microM), a specific blocker of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, also caused a significant inhibition on these relaxations. The results suggest that NO, Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and potassium channels may have a role on relaxations induced by 40 mM KCl in the frog esophagus.", 
    "23": "To assess the beneficial effects of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker telmisartan on a non-obese animal model of reduced function and mass of islet beta-cells prior to the development of diabetes, Spontaneously Diabetic Torii (SDT) rats were treated with telmisartan at 8 weeks of age. At 24 weeks of age, the treatment with telmisartan dose-dependently ameliorated hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia, and high-dose (5 mg/kg/day) treated SDT rats did not developed diabetes. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that treatment with high-dose telmisartan reduced mRNA expression of local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components, components of NAD(P)H oxidase, transforming growth factor-beta1 and vascular endothelial growth factor in the pancreas of male SDT rats. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses revealed that treatment with telmisartan also reduced expression of p47(phox). These results suggest that treatment with telmisartan reduces oxidative stress by local RAS activation and protects against islet beta-cell damage and dysfunction. These findings provide at least a partial explanation for the reduced incidence of new-onset diabetes that has been observed in several clinical trials involving angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors.",

    "28": "Endothelial dysfunction, which is characterized by impairment of nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, plays an important role in the development of arterial hypertension. The L-arginine-NO pathway is closely related to oxygen transport to tissue. Endothelial dysfunction in patients with arterial hypertension can affect haemoglobin-oxygen affinity and tissue oxygen supply. Alterations in blood oxygen transport indices may play role in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the beta-selective adrenoblocker nebilet (nebivolol) on blood oxygen transport indices and on endothelial dysfunction in patients with arterial hypertension. The study population included 52 patients with grade II and grade III arterial hypertension. The results of our studies indicate that endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive patients significantly changes blood oxygen indices. The endothelium can be involved in formation of these impairments because only NO synthesized in sufficient amounts can maintain normal blood flow and oxygen transport to tissues. Endothelial dysfunction impairs formation of different haemoglobin NO-derivatives, that influence not only on the release of NO at different sites of the vascular bed, but also on haemoglobin-oxygen affinity, and accordingly, on optimal blood oxygenation in capillaries of pulmonary circulation and its deoxygenation in capillaries of systemic circulation. Treatment of hypertensive patients with nebivolol corrects the blood oxygen transport indices, stimulates NO production and improves endothelium-dependent dilatation. Normalization of blood oxygen transport indices may regulate the activity of the L-arginine-NO pathway. Thus, nebivolol may improve efficiency of the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "29": "Derivatization with 1,2-dimethylimidazole-4-sulfonyl chloride (DMISC) has been successfully used as a tool to differentiate between aromatic and aliphatic O-glucuronides of hydroxypropranolol. The analyses were performed with liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) with both a triple quadrupole and an ion trap instrument. Hydroxylated forms of propranolol can be glucuronidated in aliphatic as well as aromatic positions. These isoforms are not distinguishable by tandem MS alone, as they both initially lose 176 Da, i.e. monodehydrated glucuronic acid, giving back the aglycone. Two in vitro systems were set up for the production of propranolol metabolites. The obtained isomers of 4'-hydroxypropranolol glucuronide were determined to correspond to one aliphatic and one aromatic form, using chemical derivatization with DMISC and LC-MS(n). DMISC was shown to react with the secondary amine in the case where the naphtol was occupied by the glucuronyl moiety, resulting in a different fragmentation pattern compared with that of the aliphatic glucuronide, where the naphtol group was accessible to derivatization.",

A 31-year-old female patient with primary pulmonary hypertension underwent successful bilateral lung transplantation. She had a pressure gradient of 30 mmHg through the right ventricular outflow tract one week after transplantation, but was successfully treated with atelenol and disopyramide. Long-term follow-up cardiac catheterization did not show any significant right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The actual cause of the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction remained unknown, but longstanding pulmonary hypertension might have induced significant structural changes in the heart, such as right ventricular hypertrophy and enlargement.",

Despite her family history of several sudden deaths in close relatives the patient was misdiagnosed, being treated many years for epilepsy. Finally, after another series of syncopal spells she was diagnosed with LQTS. Although QTc interval was normal on surface ECG, the presence of notched T-waves and QT prolongation up to 543 ms on Holter recording were helpful in establishing the correct diagnosis, which was later confirmed by genotyping revealing G601S mutation in the HERG gene.

    "33": "We conducted a meta-analysis of trials comparing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), or calcium-channel blockers (CCBs), with diuretics, beta-blockers, or placebo in hypertensive or high-risk subjects without CHF at entry. Both fixed- and random-effect models were used. In trials vs. placebo, the risk of CHF was reduced by 21% with ACEIs (P = 0.007), whereas the effect of ARBs and CCBs was not significant (random-effect models). Thus, CCBs did not increase the risk of CHF. In trials vs. diuretics/beta-blockers, no differences were found between ACEIs and comparators [odds ratio (OR) 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84-1.24], whereas CCBs were associated with an 18% higher risk of CHF (OR 1.18; 95% CI 1.00-1.39; P = 0.048). Therefore, ACEIs were not superior to diuretics/beta-blockers for the prevention of CHF. Because heterogeneity between trials was significant, we investigated potential sources of heterogeneity by meta-regression. The risk of CHF decreased by 24% (P < 0.001) for each 5 mmHg reduction in systolic BP. The risk of CHF was 19% less with ACEIs/ARBs than CCBs (P < 0.001) and 16% less in studies without multiple risk factors required for entry (P = 0.009).",

AE was defined by norepinephrine levels above the upper limit of normal. Irrespective of the individual beta-blocker agents used and the dose equivalent taken, the prevalence of AE was 31-39%. Norepinephrine levels neither correlated with heart rate (r=0.02; 95% CI: -0.08-0.11; P=0.74) nor were they related to underlying rhythm (P=0.09) or the individual beta-blocker agent used (P=0.87).

The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of azelnidipine, a unique dihydropyridine Ca(2+) channel blocker, on aldosterone production in the human adrenocortical cell line NCI-H295R. Azelnidipine inhibited angiotensin II- and KCl-induced expression of steroid 11beta-hydroxylase, steroid 18-hydroxylase, and the alpha1H subunit of the T-type Ca(2+) channel, and suppressed steroid biosynthesis in H295R cells by the same amount as efonidipine.

Catanionic vesicles formed from the drug substances alprenolol or tetracaine, and the oppositely charged surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate were mixed with polymers. Three polymers with different properties were employed: one bearing hydrophobic modifications, one positively charged and one positively charged polymer bearing hydrophobic modifications. The structure of the vesicles before and after addition of polymer was investigated by using cryo-TEM. Gel formation was confirmed by using rheological measurements. Drug release was studied using a modified USP paddle method. Gels were observed to form only in the case when catanionic vesicles, most likely with a net negative charge, were mixed with positively charged polymer bearing lipophilic modifications. The release of drug substance from these systems, where the vesicles are not trapped within the gel but constitute a founding part of it, could be significantly prolonged.

    "52": "Recently, new cardiac imaging techniques as cardiac magnetic resonance have shown to play a primary role for a recognition of unusual mechanisms of right and left ventricular obstruction. However, echocardiography remains the most widely used technique and the first step to recognize myocardial hypertrophy, blood flow velocity, and pressure gradients in real time (2). We describe a rare case of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with isolated obstruction of right ventricular out flow where transthoracic echocardiography was able to detect right ventricular hypertrophy and obstruction.", 
    "53": "Opioids are an effective treatment for the signs and symptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and the signs and symptoms of RLS return when the opiate receptor blocker naloxone is given to opioid treated RLS patients in a blinded fashion. These data suggest that the opioid effect is specific to the opiate receptor in RLS and implicate the endogenous opioid system with its enkephalins and endorphins in the pathogenesis of RLS. We therefore measured Beta endorphin, Met-enkephalin and Leu-enkephalin levels in thalamus and substantia nigra of RLS patients (5 F - avg age 80.2 years) compared to controls (5 F, 1 M - avg age 76.3 years). One half of each brain was fixed in paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for pathologic evaluation and paraffin sections were stained with antibodies. Cell numbers were counted in a blinded fashion. In the thalamus, there were reductions of Beta-endorphin and Met-enkephalin positive cells by 37.5% (p=.006, effect size 2.16) and 26.4% (p=.028, effect size 1.58), respectively, in RLS patients compared to controls. There was no difference in Leu-enkephalin in the thalamus or changes in Beta endorphin, Met-enkephalin, Leu-enkephalin or Tyrosine Hydroxylase, the rate limiting step for dopamine synthesis, in the substantia nigra. Although one of the main hypotheses for pathogenesis has been that there is a dopaminergic hypofunction in RLS, this lack of decrease in Tyrosine Hydroxylase in substantia nigra is consistent with previously published post-mortem data in RLS. With Bonferroni correction, the decrease in thalamic Beta endorphin remained significant (p= .006 x 7= .042). These results suggest that there may be altered central processing of pain in RLS and these data further implicate the endogenous opioid system in the pathogenesis of RLS. The mu opiate receptor subtype may be involved in the pathogenesis of RLS as it is the target of Beta-endorphin and Met-enkephalin but not Leu-enkephalin. However, these results should be viewed as only preliminary and more advanced techniques such as stereology should be employed in future post-mortem studies. In addition, other opioid rich areas need to be explored as well as areas implicated in the pathogenesis of RLS such as the red nucleus and raphe nucleus.", 
    "54": "Beta blockers have a proven benefit in the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and for secondary prevention of coronary events. Current guidelines list such reactive airway diseases (RADs) such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as relative contraindications to beta-blocker use. However, the co-morbid burden of RAD and coronary heart disease is substantial, and data suggest that the treatment benefit of beta blockers is shared by patients with RAD. The Get with the Guidelines (GWTG) database was used to evaluate use of beta blockers within 24 hours of admission and at discharge in patients with ACS with (n = 12,967) and without (n = 81,140) a history of RAD. Data were collected in 435 hospitals between January 2000 and September 2006. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine predictors of beta-blocker treatment. In patients with no RAD history, beta-blocker prescription rates were 78.3% at admission and 88.7% at discharge; in patients with a RAD history, rates were 65.6% at admission and 77.2% at discharge. Compared with patients with no history of RAD, patients with a history of RAD were 42% less likely (odds ratio 0.58, confidence interval 0.54 to 0.62, p <0.0001) to receive a beta blocker upon admission and 55% less likely (odds ratio 0.45, confidence interval 0.41 to 0.48, p <0.0001) to receive a beta blocker at discharge in multivariable analysis. Among all other clinical factors, RAD history was the most significant predictor of likelihood of not receiving a beta blocker at admission or discharge. Receipt of beta blockers within 24 hours after admission was associated with a lower in-hospital mortality rate for patients with RAD (odds ratio = 0.52, p <0.001) and for patients without RAD (odds ratio = 0.38, p <0.001). Careful assessment of beta-blocker safety and RAD severity by physicians is needed to improve beta-blocker prescription rates in this large group of patients with ACS.",

    "59": "Chronic stable angina pectoris (CSAP) usually occurs in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) that affects one or more large epicardial arteries. It results when myocardial perfusion is insufficient to meet cardiac metabolic demand. Elevated heart rate (HR) is an important factor in the development of myocardial ischemia and angina pectoris. The pharmacologic agents most commonly administered in the treatment of CSAP are beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers (CCBs). However, the use of beta-blockers is limited by poor compliance related to contraindications and comorbidities, especially in elderly patients. Ivabradine is a new selective HR-lowering agent that selectively inhibits the pacemaker current I (f) in the sinus atrial node. In several randomized controlled trials, ivabradine 5-10 mg twice daily has demonstrated equivalent anti-ischemic and anti-anginal activity to beta-blockers and CCBs, with a good safety and tolerability profile. Although ivabradine has been shown not to improve cardiac outcomes in patients with stable CAD and left ventricular systolic dysfunction, it may be used to reduce the incidence of CAD outcomes in a subgroup of patients with HR > or =70 bpm. The aim of this short review is to summarize the use of ivabradine in the treatment of CSAP, and its potential utility in atherosclerosis, primitive and dilatative cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmias, such as postural tachycardia syndrome and inappropriate sinus tachycardia, where exclusive lowering of elevated HR may prove beneficial.",

In the present study we investigated the influence of CYP2D and CYP3A on the stereoselective metabolism of metoprolol in rats. Male Wistar rats (n = 6 per group) received racemic metoprolol (15 mg/kg) orally, with or without pretreatment with the CYP inhibitor ketoconazole (50 mg/kg), cimetidine (150 mg/kg), or quinidine (80 mg/kg). Blood samples were collected up to 48 h after metoprolol administration. The plasma concentrations of the stereoisomers of metoprolol, O-demethylmetoprolol (ODM), alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (OHM) (Chiralpak AD column), and metoprolol acidic metabolite (AODM) (Chiralcel OD-R column) were determined by HPLC using fluorescence detection (lambda(exc) = 229 nm; lambda(em) = 298 nm). CYP3A inhibition by ketoconazole reduced the plasma concentrations of ODM and AODM and favored the formation of OHM. CYP2D and CYP3A inhibition by cimetidine reduced the plasma concentrations of OHM and AODM and favored the formation of ODM. The inhibition of CYP2D by quinidine reduced the plasma concentrations of OHM and favored the formation of ODM. In conclusion, the results suggest that CYP3A is involved in the formation of ODM and CYP2D is involved in the formation of AODM.",

    "80": "Recent studies from our laboratory indicate that psychological stress is a potent inducer of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10, raising the possibility that the IL-10 family of cytokines may be key mediators of stress-induced immunosuppression. In this study we examined the impact of psychological stress (restraint stress) on expression of IL-10, and the novel IL-10 family members IL-19, IL-20 and IL-24 in mouse spleen following an in vivo challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that stressor exposure significantly augmented LPS-induced IL-10 expression. Similarly, IL-19 expression was induced by LPS, and this was significantly enhanced by restraint stress. In contrast, expression of IL-24 was not significantly altered by LPS or stress, and expression of IL-20 was largely not detectable in vivo in either saline or LPS-treated animals. Consistent with a role for sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation in stress-induced immune regulation, the sympathetic neurotransmitter noradrenaline increased LPS-induced IL-10 and IL-19 expression in splenocytes and dendritic cells, and the ability of noradrenaline to induce expression of these cytokines was blocked by pre-treatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. Similarly, pre-treatment of mice with the peripherally acting beta-adrenoceptor antagonist nadolol completely blocked the stress-induced increase in IL-10 and IL-19 mRNA expression. Finally, pre-treatment with the benzodiazepine anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide prevented the stress-induced increase in IL-10 and IL-19 expression. Taken together, these data demonstrate that psychological stress induces expression of the IL-10 and its homolog IL-19 via activation of beta-adrenoceptors, and the ability of stress to induce these cytokines is prevented by treatment with the anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide. The findings suggest that stress enhances the production of immunosuppressive cytokines, which may impact on stress-related disease processes.", 
    "81": "Recent studies suggest that certain cardiovascular antihypertensive agents decrease the incidence of Alzheimer's disease. Based on this evidence and the fact that Abeta aggregation into high-molecular-weight-soluble oligomeric Abeta species is known to directly induce cognitive impairment, we tested the possibility that certain antihypertensive compounds may affect the progression of Alzheimer's disease, at least in part by influencing the formation of Abeta oligomers. High throughput screening of 55 commercially available antihypertensive drugs identified four compounds that significantly reduced Abeta(1-42) oligomerization in a dose dependent manner. These four compounds, furosemide (diuretic), nitrendipine (calcium channel blocker), candesartan cilextil (angiotensin II receptor antagonist) and diazoxide (vasodilator) showed no detectable Abeta lowering activities in primary neuron cultures generated from Tg2576 mouse embryos. However, furosemide, nitrendipine and candesartan cilextil prevented oligomerization of both Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) in vitro. Furosemide also dissociated pre-aggregated Abeta(1-42) oligomers. Furthermore, short term furosemide treatment resulted in decreased amount of Abeta oligomers in the brain of Tg2576 mice. Our studies suggest that certain antihypertensive compounds may prevent AD-type neuropathology through inhibition of Abeta oligomer formation.",

These compounds have been selected since they are often encountered in anti-doping control. The principle is based on the selection of representative analytes during SPE protocol optimization, allowing a drastic reduction of generated data and development time. To select the representative compounds, all substances were classified based on their SPE behavior with a generic method and groups were formed with the help of a chemometric tool, namely hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). One representative analyte per group was selected and used for subsequent SPE method development. Once the SPE method was developed, compounds were analyzed by LC-MS and matrix effects were evaluated to determine the influence of the matrix on the SPE process and MS signal alteration due to endogenous compounds. As a result, matrix effects evaluation must be performed on all analytes; representative compounds previously selected for SPE development were unable to predict matrix effects.",

The aim was to investigate differences in effects of the antiarrhythmic agent and open-channel blocker tedisamil on transient outward current I(to) (Kv4.3) when coexpressed with beta-subunits potassium voltage-gated channel, Isk-related family, member 1 (KCNE1), potassium voltage-gated channel, Isk-related family, member 2 (KCNE2), or dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase-like protein 6 (DPP6) which modulate I(to) kinetics. Tedisamil inhibited I(to) with IC(50) values of 16 microM for Kv4.3+KChIP2, 11 microM in the presence of KCNE1, and 14 microM for KCNE2. Values were higher in the presence of DPP6 or DPP6+KCNE2 (35 and 26 microM). K(d) values of tedisamil binding and rate constants were not affected by KCNE or DPP6. I(to) kinetics were accelerated by KCNE and DPP6, inactivation to a larger extent with DPP6. Tedisamil did not affect activation time course but apparently accelerated inactivation in all channel subunit combinations tested. Deletion of the intracellular domain of KCNE2 or DPP6 resulted in slowing of kinetics and increased tedisamil sensitivity (IC(50) 4 and 7 microM). It is concluded that apparent effects of DPP6 and deletion mutants (KCNE2 and DPP6) are due to the acceleration or slowing effects of the beta-subunits on I(to) kinetics.",

Prescriptions of evidence-based treatments issued from 1997 to 2003 by a sample of primary care practices were also examined. A total of 116 556 individuals (52.6% women) had a first hospital discharge for HF. Age-adjusted first hospitalization rates for HF (per 100 000; 95% CI in parentheses) rose from 124 (119 to 129) in 1986 to 162 (157 to 168) in 1994 and then fell to 105 (101 to 109) in 2003 in men; in women, they rose from 128 (123 to 132) in 1986 to 160 (155 to 165) in 1993, falling to 101 (97 to 105) in 2003. Case-fatality rates fell steadily over the period. Adjusted 30-day case-fatality rates fell after discharge (adjusted odds [2003 versus 1986] 0.59 [95% CI 0.45 to 0.63] in men and 0.77 [95% CI 0.67 to 0.88] in women). Adjusted 1- and 5-year survival improved similarly. Median survival increased from 1.33 to 2.34 years in men and from 1.32 to 1.79 years in women.

Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may reduce LV mass to a greater extent than other antihypertensive agents. We compared the effect of aliskiren, the first orally active direct renin inhibitor, the angiotensin-receptor blocker losartan, and their combination on the reduction of LV mass in hypertensive patients.",

Patients were treated to standard blood pressure targets with add-on therapy, excluding other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and beta-blockers. Patients underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging for assessment of LV mass at baseline and at study completion. The primary objective was to compare change in LV mass index from baseline to follow-up in the combination and losartan arms; the secondary objective was to determine whether aliskiren was noninferior to losartan in reducing LV mass index from baseline to follow-up. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced similarly in all treatment groups (6.5+/-14.9/3.8+/-10.1 mm Hg in the aliskiren group; 5.5+/-15.6/3.7+/-10.7 mm Hg in the losartan group; 6.6+/-16.6/4.6+/-10.5 mm Hg in the combination arm; P<0.0001 within groups, P=0.81 between groups). LV mass index was reduced significantly from baseline in all treatment groups (4.9-, 4.8-, and 5.8 g/m(2) reductions in the aliskiren, losartan, and combination arms, respectively; P<0.0001 for all treatment groups). The reduction in LV mass index in the combination group was not significantly different from that with losartan alone (P=0.52). Aliskiren was as effective as losartan in reducing LV mass index (P<0.0001 for noninferiority). Safety and tolerability were similar across all treatment groups.", 
    "114": "Aliskiren was as effective as losartan in promoting LV mass regression. Reduction in LV mass with the combination of aliskiren plus losartan was not significantly different from that with losartan monotherapy, independent of blood pressure lowering.

Of these, 7410 (79.6%) were prescribed a loop diuretic, 6620 (71.1%) were prescribed an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or ARB, 3403 (36.6%) were prescribed beta-blockers but only 2732 (29.3%) were prescribed an ACE inhibitor or ARB and a beta-blocker in combination. Thirty-five per cent of patients prescribed ACE inhibitor and 11.5% of those prescribed beta-blockers met ESC guideline target doses. Age, gender and comorbidity predicted whether patients received beta-blocker or ACE inhibitor with younger males being more likely to receive maximal therapy.",

Nipradilol and timolol, but not latanoprost, induce the expression of peroxiredoxin 2 through the activation of the Foxo3a transcription factor. TM cells showed reduced sensitivity to H(2)O(2) when cells were treated with either nipradilol or timolol, but not with latanoprost. In addition, both Foxo3a and PRDX2 expression were enhanced by drug-induced signal transduction through its receptor.",

    "124": "The beta(3)-adrenoceptors (beta(3)-ARs) have been identified and characterized in the human heart. Specific beta(3)-AR stimulation, unlike beta(1)-AR or beta(2)-AR stimulation, decreases cardiac contractility, partly via the G(i)-NO pathway. However, the precise role of cardiac beta(3)-ARs is not yet completely understood. Indeed, under normal conditions, the beta(3)-AR response is present only to a very low degree in rats and mice. Therefore, we evaluated whether beta(3)-ARs were present and functional in rabbit ventricular cardiomyocytes, and whether the rabbit could serve as a relevant model for the study of cardiac beta(3)-ARs. We used RT-PCR and Western blot to measure the beta(3)-AR transcripts and protein levels in rabbit ventricular cardiomyocytes. We also analysed the effect of beta(3)-AR stimulation using isoproterenol in combination with nadolol or SR 58611A on cardiomyocyte shortening, Ca(2+) transient, L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)), delayed rectifier potassium current (I(Ks)) and action potential duration (APD). For the first time, we show that beta(3)-ARs are expressed in rabbit ventricular cardiomyocytes. The mRNA and protein sequences present a high homology to those of rat and human beta(3)-ARs. Furthermore, beta(3)-AR stimulation decreases cardiomyocyte shortening, Ca(2+) transient and I(Ca,L) amplitudes, via a G(i)-NO pathway. Importantly, beta(3)-AR stimulation enhances I(Ks) amplitude and shortens the APD. Taken together, our results indicate that the rabbit provides a relevant model, easily used in laboratories, to study the roles of cardiac beta(3)-ARs in physiological conditions.", 
    "125": "This study was undertaken to clarify the effects of esmolol and landiolol, beta-1 selective adrenergic antagonists, on hyperreactive airways in both ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs and asthmatic patients. In the animal study, asthma was induced by ovalbumin. After control acetylcholine responses for total pulmonary resistance (Raw) and dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn) were obtained, the animals received propranolol, esmolol, or landiolol, and the same protocol was again performed. Sixty inpatients with coronary risk factors and asthma were enrolled in the human study. Under propofol anesthesia, the patients received saline, esmolol, or landiolol. To assess intubation-induced bronchoconstriction, the presence of wheezing was determined. The dose-response curves of Raw and Cdyn to acetylcholine were significantly elevated and declined in the ovalbumin-sensitized model compared with those in the control group. Neither esmolol nor landiolol had any effect on the acetylcholine-induced response curve in these sensitized animals. However, propranolol significantly enhanced Raw and reduced Cdyn in this model. Tracheal intubation increased the incidence of wheezing in asthmatic patients. However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of wheezing among these groups. The ultra-short-acting beta-1 selective adrenergic antagonists esmolol and landiolol can be safely used perioperatively in patients with airway hyperreactivity.",

We describe here the genetic background of long QT syndrome and the eleven different genes for ion-channels and a structural anchoring protein associated with that disorder. Clinical Background section discusses the risk of cardiac events associated with different LQTS types. Management and Prevention section describes in turn gene-specific therapy, which was based on the identification of the gene defect and the dysfunction of the associated transmembrane ion channel. In patients affected by LQTS, genetic analysis is useful for risk stratification and for making therapeutic decisions. A recent study reported a quite novel pathogenic mechanism for LQTS and suggested that treatments aimed at scaffolding proteins rather than specific ion channels may be an alternative to antiarrhythmic strategy in the future.", 
    "127": "ABSTRACT Heart failure continues to be the leading cause of hospitalization among older adults. Noncompliance with medications, dietary indiscretion, failure to recognize symptoms, and failed social support systems contribute to increased morbidity. Multidisciplinary medical approaches have proven successful for heart failure. In 2004, the Naval Medical Center San Diego started a multidisciplinary shared medical appointment for patients with complicated cases of heart failure. Patients enrolled in the heart failure clinic were monitored prospectively for 6 months. Validated questionnaires concerning satisfaction with care, self-care management, depression, and quality-of-life measures were administered at baseline and 6 months after enrollment. Thirty-nine individuals were enrolled in the clinic, with 33 completing 6 months of follow-up monitoring to date. Hospital admissions for any cause decreased from 11 to eight, whereas congestive heart failure-related admissions decreased from four to two. There was a total of six deaths. During the 6 months of enrollment, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-receptor blockers had absolute increases of 20% and 19%, respectively. Statistically significant improvements were seen in the Beck Depression Inventory and Self-Care Management Index results. A multidisciplinary approach to heart failure patients using the shared medical appointment model can improve patient satisfaction, enhance quality of life, and help reduce hospitalizations while improving provider efficiency.",

Current commercially available fixed combinations used in glaucoma treatment include Combigan, Cosopt, Xalcom, Duotrav and Ganfort. Statistically significant superiority of the ocular hipotensive efficacy of the fixed combinations vs monotherapy with the two individual constituents is present connected with Cosopt and Xalcom. It also exists vs timolol ophthalmic solution relative to Combigan, Duotrav and Ganfort but is missing within these fixed combinations vs brimonidine, travatan and bimatoprost respectively. A slight reduction, that is clinically and statistically insignificant relative to fixed combination efficacy vs the nonfixed combinations (e.g. concomitant but separate administration of the two individual components) is acceptable when this is balanced by potential benefits of the fixed combinations therapy (improved tolerability and convenience,increased compliance,cost and time economies,decreased washout effect and reduced exposure to preservatives).",

    "130": "The new beta(2) Adrenoceptor (beta(2)AR) crystal structures provide a high-resolution snapshot of receptor interactions with two particular partial inverse agonists, (-)-carazolol and timolol. However, both experimental and computational studies of GPCR structure are significantly complicated by the existence of multiple conformational states coupled to ligand type and receptor activity. Agonists and antagonists induce or stabilize distinct changes in receptor structure that mediate a range of pharmacological activities. In this work, we (1) established that the existing beta(2)AR crystallographic conformers can be extended to describe ligand/receptor interactions for additional antagonist types, (2) generated agonist-bound receptor conformations, and (3) validated these models for agonist and antagonist virtual ligand screening (VLS). Using a ligand directed refinement protocol, we derived a single agonist-bound receptor conformation that selectively retrieved a diverse set of full and partial beta(2)AR agonists in VLS trials. Additionally, the impact of extracellular loop two conformation on VLS was assessed by docking studies with rhodopsin-based beta(2)AR homology models, and loop-deleted receptor models. A general strategy for constructing and selecting agonist-bound receptor pocket conformations is presented, which may prove broadly useful in creating agonist and antagonist bound models for other GPCRs.", 
    "131": "The present investigation was undertaken to fabricate modified release tablet of metoprolol succinate using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and xanthan gum as a matrixing agent. A 3(2) full factorial design was employed for the optimization of formulation. The percentage drug released at a given time (Y (60), Y (240) and Y (720)) and the time required for a given percentage of drug to be released (t (50%)) were selected as dependent variables. The in vitro drug dissolution study was carried out in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer employing paddle rotated at 50 rpm. The similarity factor (f (2)) was calculated for selection of best batch considering mean in vitro dissolution data of Seloken XL as a reference profile. It is concluded that the desired drug release pattern can be obtained by using a proper combination of HPMC (high gelling ability) and xanthan gum (quick gelling tendency). The economy of xanthan gum and faster hydration rate favors its use in modified release tablets. The matrix integrity during dissolution testing was maintained by using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.", 
    "132": "This review examines pharmacotherapy of rhythm management for atrial fibrillation (AF) in the elderly. There is little research specifically focused on this topic in the elderly but five of the seven randomized controlled trials comparing pharmacologic rate control to pharmacologic rhythm control enrolled patients who can be considered \"elderly\". Collectively, these studies showed that the rate control approach was favored for the outcomes of mortality, hospitalization and cost. With respect to stroke and systemic thromboembolism, no clear advantage accrues to either approach and the major therapeutic intervention for stroke prevention is anticoagulation. Rhythm control may be better for relief of symptoms in those who are highly symptomatic but symptoms are usually less problematic in the elderly. Little comparative information is available about use of specific drugs in the elderly but beta blockers are probably the preferred initial therapy for rate control when possible. Although amiodarone is the most effective rhythm control agent, its adverse effect profile suggests it should be reserved for use when other antiarrhythmic drugs fail or are contraindicated. To date, \"upstream\" or preventive therapies have not been specifically evaluated in the elderly but nebivolol (a beta blocker) does not prevent emergence of AF in elderly patients with heart failure, although it does provide the other salutary benefits of beta blocker therapy seen in younger heart failure patients.", 
    "133": "There are three options for the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease: coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and optimal medical treatment alone. While there has been an active interface between CABG and PCI, medical treatment has not been as vociferously advocated. However, it performs well in randomized trials and is still a treatment arm in studies such as the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D) trial. The present review compares these options in acute and chronic coronary syndromes, including the indications for each as summarized by recent American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines. While the landscape in Canada is changing for CABG and PCI, with an increase in the latter procedure for patients with multivessel disease, optimal medical treatment alone is very effective. There are few subsets, particularly in chronic syndromes, in which revascularization is indicated for prognosis alone.",

Theophylline, paracetamol, metoprolol succinate, diltiazem HCl and metoprolol tartrate were used as model drugs exhibiting significantly different solubilities (e.g. 14, 19, 284, 662 and 800 mg/mL at 37 degrees C in 0.1N HCl). The pellet core consisted of a drug matrix, drug-layered sugar bead or drug-layered microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) bead, generating different osmotic driving forces upon contact with aqueous media. Importantly, the addition of small amounts of poly(vinyl alcohol)-poly(ethylene glycol) graft copolymer (PVA-PEG graft copolymer) to the ethylcellulose coatings allowed for controlled drug release within 8-12h, irrespective of the type of drug and composition of the pellet core. Drug release was found to be controlled by diffusion through the intact polymeric membranes, irrespective of the drug solubility and type of core formulation. The ethylcellulose coating was dominant for the control of drug release, minimizing potential effects of the type of pellet core and nature of the surrounding bulk fluid, e.g. osmolality. Thus, this type of controlled drug delivery system can be used for very different drugs and is robust.", 
    "144": "Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterized by uncoordinated atrial activation with consequent deterioration of atrial mechanical function. It is a common arrhythmia that presents various treatment options. Pharmacologic therapy is used to maintain sinus rhythm, to control the ventricular response, or to convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm and prevention of thromboembolism. Cardioversion shocks are applied through surface or intrathoracic electrodes to convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. The tendency for recurrence of atrial fibrillation is high. Treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs has decreased its recurrence. Drugs that slow conduction through the AV node (such as digoxin, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers) have been used as adjuvants to therapy for the prevention of atrial fibrillation. Drugs used for the prevention of atrial fibrillation are antiarrhythmic drugs of class IA and C, and type III. Drug combination acting through different electrophysiological channels and mechanisms may prove beneficial in the prevention of atrial fibrillation.",

The amplitudes of gustatory depolarizing potentials in the disk cells for 4 basic taste stimuli were reduced to 40-60% after intravenous injection of beta-GA at 1.0 mg/kg. beta-GA of 1.0 mg/kg did not affect the resting potentials and the reversal potentials for tastant-induced depolarizing potentials in any taste disk cells. The percentage of cells responding to each of 4 basic taste stimuli and varying numbers of 4 taste qualities did not differ between control and beta-GA-treated taste disk cells. This implies that gustatory depolarizing response profiles for 4 basic taste stimuli were very similar in control and beta-GA-treated taste disk cells. It is concluded that beta-GA at 1.0 mg/kg reduced the amplitude of gustatory depolarizing potentials in taste disk cells by strongly blocking depolarizing currents flowing through the gap junction channels and hemichannels, but probably weakly affected the gustatory transduction mechanisms for 4 taste stimuli.",

We utilized an in vivo burn wound model in animals with implanted pumps to deliver beta2AR active drugs to study how these alter healing in vivo. Immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting were used to examine the up-regulation of catecholamine synthetic enzymes in burned tissue, and immunoassay for epinephrine determined the levels of this catecholamine in affected tissue and in the circulation. When epinephrine levels in the culture medium are elevated to the range found in burn-stressed animals, the migratory rate of both cultured human and murine keratinocytes is impaired (reduced by 76%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 56%-95% in humans, p < 0.001, and by 36%, 95% CI 24%-49% in mice, p = 0.001), and wound re-epithelialization in explanted burned human skin is delayed (by 23%, 95% CI 10%-36%, p = 0.001), as compared to cells or tissues incubated in medium without added epinephrine. This impairment is reversed by beta2AR antagonists, is absent in murine keratinocytes that are genetically depleted of the beta2AR, and is reproduced by incubation of keratinocytes with other beta2AR-specific agonists. Activation of the beta2AR in cultured keratinocytes signals the down-regulation of the AKT pathway, accompanied by a stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton and an increase in focal adhesion formation, resulting in a nonmigratory phenotype. Burn wound injury in excised human skin also rapidly up-regulates the intra-epithelial expression of the epinephrine synthesizing enzyme phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase, and tissue levels of epinephrine rise dramatically (15-fold) in the burn wounded tissue (values of epinephrine expressed as pg/ug protein +/- standard error of the mean: unburned control, 0.6 +/- 0.36; immediately postburn, 9.6 +/- 1.58; 2 h postburn, 3.1 +/- 1.08; 24 h post-burn, 6.7 +/- 0.94). Finally, using an animal burn wound model (20% body surface in mice), we found that systemic treatment with betaAR antagonists results in a significant increase (44%, 95% CI 27%-61%, p < 0.00000001) in the rate of burn wound re-epithelialization.", 
    "153": "This work demonstrates an alternate pathway by which stress can impair healing: by stress-induced elevation of epinephrine levels resulting in activation of the keratinocyte beta2AR and the impairment of cell motility and wound re-epithelialization. Furthermore, since the burn wound locally generates epinephrine in response to wounding, epinephrine levels are locally, as well as systemically, elevated, and wound healing is impacted by these dual mechanisms. Treatment with beta adrenergic antagonists significantly improves the rate of burn wound re-epithelialization. This work suggests that specific beta2AR antagonists may be apt, near-term translational therapeutic targets for enhancing burn wound healing, and may provide a novel, low-cost, safe approach to improving skin wound repair in the stressed individual.", 
    "154": "We investigated in 51 consecutive outpatients with symptomatic congestive heart failure caused by abnormal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction treated with furosemide or torsemide (10% also with metolazone), beta blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, 55% with spironolactone, and 18% with digoxin, the effects of doubling the dose of furosemide, torsemide, and metolazone on symptoms, weight, 6-minute walk distance, and echocardiographic measurements of LV systolic and diastolic function at 24 \u00b1 6 days follow-up. At follow-up, the weight decreased from 70 \u00b1 6 kg to 65 \u00b1 6 kg (P < 0.001), the New York Heart Association functional class decreased from 2.9 \u00b1 0.4 to 2.1 \u00b1 0.2 (P < 0.001), the Minnesota With Heart Failure Questionnaire score decreased from 43 \u00b1 7 to 28 \u00b1 8 (P < 0.001), the 6-minute walk distance increased from 270 \u00b1 46 m to 318 \u00b1 44 m (P < 0.001), and there was no significant change in LV ejection fraction, LV end-diastolic dimension, LV end-systolic dimension, left atrial dimension, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, peak mitral early/ atrial ratio, mitral deceleration time, and velocity time interval. In conclusion, doubling the dose of diuretics in outpatients with symptomatic congestive heart failure caused a significant loss of weight and a significant improvement in symptoms and 6-minute walk distance but did not change LV systolic and diastolic function.", 
    "155": "Currently, nipradilol, an alpha-1 beta-blocker with a nitric oxide donative action, is used as an ocular hypotensive agent for glaucoma patients in Japan. The aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of nipradilol on optic nerve injury in rats.", 
    "156": "Using a calibrated cross-action forceps, a crush lesion was inflicted unilaterally on the optic nerve 2 mm behind the globe of adult Wistar albino rats and followed by topical instillation of either 0.25% nipradilol or the vehicle in both eyes twice daily until killing. A sham operation was conducted on the contralateral eye. Intraocular pressure measurement was performed 3 days before and 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after acute injury of the optic nerve. One week before killing, Fluoro-Gold was injected into the bilateral superior colliculi to identify surviving retinal ganglion cells (RGCs).", 
    "157": "Twenty-eight days after injury, retinal damage was assessed morphologically. There was no significant difference in the intraocular pressure of both eyes between the nipradilol and control groups. Within 1 month, the mean RGC density in the vehicle-treated group had decreased to 71.58+/-0.102% of that of the contralateral eye, whereas the optic nerve crush with topical application of nipradilol showed a considerably smaller decrease to 89.60+/-0.027% (P<0.001). No significant morphologic difference between sham-operated animals and animals from the experimental groups was observed in the retinal layers owing to the crush force.",

We aimed to investigate the relaxant effects and possible underlying mechanisms of these agents on isolated rat thoracic aorta.", 
    "160": "The preparations were precontracted with prostaglandin F2alpha (10(-7) mol l(-1)) and pancuronium (10(-7)-10(-4) mol l(-1)), rocuronium (10(-7)-10(-4) mol l(-1)), vecuronium (10(-7)-10(-4) mol l(-1)) and mivacurium (10(-7)-10(-4) mol l(-1)) added at cumulative concentrations in the presence or absence of a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, indomethacin (10(-6) M), and a nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methylester (3 x 10(-5)). The same protocol was applied to both endothelia (+) and endothelia (-) aortic rings. The preparations precontracted with prostaglandin F2alpha (10(-7) mol l(-1)) were stimulated with electrical field stimulation at a frequency of 10 Hz as square-wave pulses of 50 V (0.2 ms) in the presence of a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor desipramine (10(-7) mol l(-1)) and a nonselective beta-blocker propranolol (10(-6) mol l(-1)). Drugs were added at ineffective concentration of 10(-7) mol l(-1). Tetrodotoxin (10(-7) mol l(-1)) was added to test whether the changes were dependent on the neuronal response.", 
    "161": "Pancuronium and rocuronium relaxed aortic rings precontracted by prostaglandin F2alpha in a dose-dependent manner, but vecuronium and mivacurium did not. The relaxation effect of pancuronium and rocuronium was endothelium independent because there was not a significant response difference from the endothelium-denuded group.", 
    "162": "In conclusion, their relaxation effect may be due to an increase in prostaglandin synthesis. The increased relaxation effect of these agents at electrical field stimulation may be by the decreasing effect of noradrenaline reuptake from nerve endings because a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor desipramine did not change this effect. Also, these neuromuscular agents may affect beta-receptors, because a nonselective beta-blocker agent, propranolol, decreased their electrical field stimulation-induced relaxations.", 
    "163": "Intracellular acidosis is a profound negative regulator of myocardial performance. We hypothesized that titrating myofilament calcium sensitivity by a single histidine substituted cardiac troponin I (A164H) would protect the whole animal physiological response to acidosis in vivo. To experimentally induce severe hypercapnic acidosis, mice were exposed to a 40% CO(2) challenge. By echocardiography, it was found that systolic function and ventricular geometry were maintained in cTnI A164H transgenic (Tg) mice. By contrast, non-Tg (Ntg) littermates experienced rapid and marked cardiac decompensation during this same challenge. For detailed hemodymanic assessment, Millar pressure-conductance catheterization was performed while animals were treated with a beta-blocker, esmolol, during a severe hypercapnic acidosis challenge. Survival and load-independent measures of contractility were significantly greater in Tg vs. Ntg mice. This assay showed that Ntg mice had 100% mortality within 5 min of acidosis. By contrast, systolic and diastolic function were protected in Tg mice during acidosis, and they had 100% survival. This study shows that, independent of any beta-adrenergic compensation, myofilament-based molecular manipulation of inotropy by histidine-modified troponin I maintains cardiac inotropic and lusitropic performance and markedly improves survival during severe acidosis in vivo.",

    "165": "Expression of beta(2)-AR was examined in 65 cases of OSCC specimens, 10 cases of normal oral mucosa, and two cell lines using immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RT-PCR. The differences in beta(2)-AR expression between various groups were evaluated using SPSS 13.0 Statistical Software. Cell proliferation assays were assayed by beta-adrenergic receptors agonists (norepinephrine) and antagonists (propranolol). Norepinephrine-mediated cell migration was assayed in Matrigel-coated chemotaxis chamber.", 
    "166": "beta(2)-AR was highly expressed on OSCC compared to normal controls. In OSCC, positive beta(2)-AR expression was significantly correlated with cervical lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001), age (P = 0.003), tumor size (P = 0.001) and clinical stage (P = 0.001), but not with gender. RT-PCR and Western blot also confirmed positive beta(2)-AR expression in OSCC and TCa8113 cell line, and negative beta(2)-AR expression in normal oral mucosa and ACC cell line. beta-adrenoreceptor agonist (norepinephrine) was a potent mitogen for TCa8113 and ACC cell lines, and completely inhibited by the selective antagonist of beta-adrenergic receptors (propranolol).

Our main analysis considering impact of LABAs (salmeterol and formoterol) has already been published. In this report we present detailed information from studies investigating use of twice daily formoterol among patients receiving ICS.", 
    "171": "The search yielded 16 relevant studies included in this analysis. Among over 10,000 participants (5,996 taking formoterol with over 4,000 patient-years observation in formoterol groups) there were 2 asthma-related deaths (both in formoterol groups) and no asthma-related non-fatal intubations. The risk of asthma-related hospitalizations (odds ratio [OR] 0.59, 95% CI 0.37-0.93) and asthma-related serious adverse events (mostly hospitalizations) [OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.91] were significantly lower in patients on formoterol and ICS compared to patients on ICS alone. The OR for total mortality was 1.22, 95% CI 0.38-3.90, reflecting 7 deaths in formoterol groups and 3 deaths in control groups respectively.",

    "173": "Acetylcholine (ACh) and N-methyl-D aspartate receptors (NMDARs) interact in the regulation of multiple important brain functions. NMDAR activation is indirectly modulated by ACh through the activation of muscarinic or nicotinic receptors. Scant information is available on whether ACh directly interacts with the NMDAR. By using a cortical brain slice preparation we found that the application of ACh and of other drugs acting on muscarinic or nicotinic receptors induces an acute and reversible reduction of NMDAR-mediated currents (I(NMDA)), ranging from 20 to 90% of the control amplitude. The reduction displayed similar features in synaptic I(NMDA) in brain slices, as well as in currents evoked by NMDA application in brain slices or from acutely dissociated cortical cells, demonstrating its postsynaptic nature. The cholinergic inhibition of I(NMDA) displayed an onset-offset rate in the order of a second, and was resistant to the presence of the muscarinic antagonist atropine (10 microM) in the extracellular solution, and of G-protein blocker GDP(beta)S (500 microM) and activator GTP(gamma)S (400 microM) in the intracellular solution, indicating that it was not G-protein dependent. Recording at depolarized or hyperpolarized holding voltages reduced NMDAR-mediated currents to similar extents, suggesting that the inhibition was voltage-independent, whereas the reduction was markedly more pronounced in the presence of glycine (20 microM). A detailed analysis of the effects of tubocurarine suggested that at least this drug interfered with glycine-dependent NMDAR-activity. We conclude that NMDAR-mediated current scan be inhibited directly by cholinergic drugs, possibly by direct interaction within one or more subunits of the NMDAR. Our results could supply a new interpretation to previous studies on the role of ACh at the glutamatergic synapse.", 
    "174": "Propranolol is found to reduce physiological hyper-responsiveness in post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), possibly by affecting reconsolidation after the reactivation of traumatic memories. Cortisol is found to attenuate declarative memory retrieval, but it is unknown whether it also reduces physiological responses to emotional memories.",

    "176": "After preparing a script of a negative disturbing memory, participants were instructed to imagine this event 1 week later after ingestion of either 35 mg cortisol, 80 mg propranolol, or a placebo. Physiological responding to the script-driven imagery was recorded. Another week later, after washout, the imagery was repeated again. During all three sessions as well as 8 months later, subjective emotional reactions to the memories were assessed.", 
    "177": "The emotionality of the memories was reduced over time, which was not affected by the treatments, however. The personal emotional script did evoke higher skin conductance responses than a neutral story, which decreased 1 week later, but no effects were found of either propranolol or cortisol on this responsiveness.", 
    "178": "Whereas healthy males do show psychophysiological responding to personal emotional scripts, the effects of cortisol and propranolol on physiological responses to emotional memories might be specific to clinical groups characterized by hyper-responsiveness, like PTSD. Future studies using longer-acting doses and more elaborate reactivation procedures in both healthy men and women could shed more light on the effects of cortisol and propranolol on psychophysiological responding to emotional memories.", 
    "179": "A case is presented of initially unrecognized takotsubo cardiomyopathy with a dramatic clinical course after emergency catecholamine treatment for circulatory support during stress-induced cardiac syncope followed by complete recovery of cardiac function after catecholamine withdrawal and starting beta-blocker therapy. Echocardiography including 2D-strain imaging suggested that the left ventricle (LV) wall motion abnormality was mainly the consequence of geometry-induced regional differences in wall stress (progressively amplified by catecholamines), which might be another possible pathophysiological mechanism involved in the development of LV dysfunction in takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This case also suggests that in emergency, before coronary angiography is possible, echocardiography can be helpful for initial therapeutic decisions, especially to avoid emergency inotropic therapy in such patients.",

Patients with either a primary or secondary diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome were identified from medical records over a 4-month period (January-April 2007). A range of clinical data was extracted from medical records, including medical history, clinical presentation and pharmacotherapy both on admission and at discharge. This audit focussed on the use of four guideline-recommended therapies: aspirin +/- clopidogrel, beta blockers, statins and ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I), as well as the utilization of multiple antithrombotics.", 
    "182": "Data pertaining to a total of 169 patients was extracted and reviewed. The mean age of the study population was 65.9 years and 71% of the population was male. Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (Non-STEMI) accounted for 42% of the admissions, whereas 33.7% and 24.3% of the patients were respectively admitted for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or unstable angina. After accounting for reported contra-indications, overall, 96% of the eligible patients received antithrombotics comprising of at least aspirin, and 79% of eligible patients received aspirin plus clopidogrel. Furthermore, 82% of eligible patients received a beta-blocker at discharge, 86% a statin and 79% received either an ACE-I or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist. Compared with patients who presented with myocardial infarction (with or without ST-segment elevation), those presenting with unstable angina were less likely to receive a beta-blocker (OR = 0.19, 95%-CI: 0.08-0.48) or an ACE-agent (OR = 0.15, 95%-CI: 0.06-0.39) at discharge. Patients over 65 years of age were also less likely to receive a beta-blocker (OR = 0.35, 95%-CI: 0.14-0.89) or an ACE-agent (OR = 0.28 95%-CI: 0.11-0.70) at discharge, but were also less likely to receive the combination of aspirin plus clopidogrel (OR = 0.19, 95%-CI: 0.07-0.54) at discharge, compared with younger patients. Men were more likely to be discharged on a statin (OR = 3.36, 95%-CI: 1.11-10.15), compared with women. Only six patients (4%) received three or more antithrombotics at discharge; five of these received the triple combination of aspirin, clopidogrel and warfarin.",

However, there is some potential underutilization in the older population and patients presenting with unstable angina. Variability in the use of oral anticoagulants alongside dual antiplatelet therapy indicates there is potentially a need for further guidance regarding the prescription of antithrombotics in those requiring poly-therapy.", 
    "184": "Previously, surgery hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) has consisted primarily of septal myectomy and/or resection of the anterior mitral leaflet with low-profile valve replacement. However, recent studies have shown that the anterior papillary muscle and chordal fan can contribute to obstruction, and also that significant mitral regurgitation (MR) may be encountered. Hence, a surgical procedure was devised to address all components of this disorder.", 
    "185": "A 37-year-old man had a history of heart murmur and NYHA class IV symptoms, despite beta-blocker therapy. Echocardiography showed severe septal hypertrophy, systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve, severe MR and a 185 mmHg resting outflow tract gradient. At surgery, the anterior papillary muscle was found to be medially displaced and contributing to outflow obstruction. The anterior papillary muscle and chordae were resected, a 'traditional' septal myectomy was performed, and a full annuloplasty ring placed. The mitral valve was repaired by connecting the left aspect of the leaflets to the posterior papillary muscles, using Gore-Tex artificial chords.",

Emodin might inhibit all of those changes induced by IL-1beta (P<0.05). When TGF-beta1 signal way was intercepted, IL-1beta induced-TEMT was suppressed and the expression of ILK was decreased, however, there was no significant difference in expression of TGF-beta1 between the SB431542 group and the IL-1beta-induced group.

    "208": "In urethane-anaesthetized adult rats, the effect of venom on the PDG reflex responses (blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate) and the pulmonary water content was ascertained using various antagonists(des- Arg, B(1) receptor antagonist; Hoe 140, B(2) receptor antagonist; N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor; methylene blue, soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor; and glibenclamide, K(+)(ATP) channel blocker). The effect of phosphodiesterase V inhibitor (sildenafil citrate) on the reflex response and the pulmonary water content was also examined and compared with venom-induced responses.", 
    "209": "Intravenous injection of PDG (10 microg kg(-1)) evoked apnoea, bradycardia and hypotension lasting >60 s. Exposure to MBT venom (100 microg kg(-1)) for 30 min augmented the PDG reflex responses by two times and increased the pulmonary water content, significantly. Hoe 140 blocked the venom-induced responses (augmentation of PDG reflex and increased pulmonary water content) whereas des-Arg did not. l-NAME, methylene blue or glibenclamide also blocked the venom-induced responses. Furthermore, sildenafil citrate (that increases cGMP levels) produced augmentation of PDG reflex response and increased the pulmonary water content as seen with venom.", 
    "210": "The results indicate that venom-induced responses involve B(2) kinin receptors via the NO-dependent guanylate cyclase-cGMP pathway involving K(+)(ATP) channels."
