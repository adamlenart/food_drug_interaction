    "0": "Bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation is a prototypical reaction catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (P450) 2D6, an enzyme known to show debrisoquine/sparteine-type genetic polymorphism in humans. In the present study we further examined the roles of several human P450 enzymes, as well as P450 2D6, in the hydroxylation of (+/-)-bufuralol, using liver microsomes from several human samples and human P450 enzymes expressed in human lymphoblastoid cell lines or Escherichia coli. Kinetic analysis of bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation by liver microsomes showed that there were different Km and Vmax values in seven human samples examined; low Km values (approximately 0.05 mM) were observed in four samples (including sample HL-18), high Km values (approximately 0.25 mM) in two samples (including sample HL-67), and an intermediate Km value (approximately 0.1 mM) in one sample. Quinidine and anti-rat P450 2D1 antibody almost completely inhibited bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation in human sample HL-18 at a substrate concentration of 0.4 mM, whereas these effects were not so drastic when liver microsomes from human sample HL-67 were used. In contrast, a very low concentration (< 10 microM) of alpha-naphthoflavone or anti-human P450 1A2 antibody significantly inhibited bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation catalyzed by human sample HL-67, but not HL-18, with 0.4 mM bufuralol. When the relative contents of P450 2D6 and P450 1A2 in 20 human samples were determined, bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation in samples containing large amounts of P450 2D6 tended to be more sensitive to quinidine, whereas the P450 1A2-rich samples were highly susceptible to alpha-naphthoflavone. However, at low substrate concentrations bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation was shown to be catalyzed principally by P450 2D6, based on the inhibitory effects of anti-rat P450 2D1 antibody and quinidine, in both human samples HL-18 and HL-67. At least five other, minor, bufuralol products were formed by human liver microsomes, in addition to 1'-hydroxybufuralol. Two of them were identified as 4- and 6-hydroxybufuralol by 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The formation of the 4- and 6-hydroxylated products was suggested to be catalyzed by P450 1A2, based on the results of correlation with P450 1A2 contents in 60 human samples and inhibition by anti-P450 1A2 and alpha-naphthoflavone. Purified recombinant P450 1A2 (expressed in E. coli) produced 1'-, 4-, and 6-hydroxybufuralol in a reconstituted system, although P450 2D6 (expressed in human lymphoblast cell lines) was found to catalyze only bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "1": "Functional activity of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor ligands and beta adrenergic receptor antagonists was studied at 5-HT1B receptor sites in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) fibroblasts by measuring two cellular responses: inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP formation and potentiation of basic fibroblast growth (BFGF) induced mitogenesis. A good correlation was found between the potency of agonists to inhibit forskolin-induced cyclic AMP formation and their potency to potentiate bFGF-induced thymidine incorporation in CHL fibroblasts. Potent agonist activity was measured with 5-methoxy-3,1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyidinyl- 1H-indole (RU 24,969), 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT), 3-(1,2,5,6)-tetrahydro-4-pyridyl-5-pyrrolo(3,2-b)pyril-5-one (CP 93,129) and 5-HT, whereas sumatriptan displayed weak agonist activity at concentrations different from its binding affinity for 5-HT1B binding sites. In contrast to the observed 5-HT1B receptor-mediated agonist activity in opossum kidney cells for metergoline and the beta adrenergic receptor antagonists: cyanopindolol, 4-(3-tert-butyl-amino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-indole-2 carbonic acid isopropyl ester (SDZ 21,009), isamoltane, (-)-propranolol and (-)-pindolol, antagonist activity at 5-HT1B receptor sites was yielded in CHL fibroblasts in accordance with the reported observations at rat brain 5-HT1B receptors. Methiothepin was the only compound that antagonized both the opossum kidney cell and CHL fibroblast 5-HT1B receptor-mediated responses although the antagonist effect was more pronounced in CHL fibroblasts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "Recent evidence from our laboratory has demonstrated that blockade of somatodendritic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A autoreceptors by systemic administration of spiperone increases the firing rate of central serotonergic neurons in awake cats. The present study examines the effects of three other putative 5-HT1A antagonists (BMY 7378 (8-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-8-azaspiro [4,5]decane-7,9-dione), NAN 190 [1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl]piperazine) and (-)-propranolol) on the single-unit activity of serotonergic neurons recorded in the dorsal raphe nucleus of free-moving cats. Systemic administration of the phenylpiperazine derivatives BMY 7378 (5-100 micrograms/kg i.v.) and NAN 190 (5-250 micrograms/kg i.v.) produced a rapid, dose-dependent inhibition of neuronal activity with BMY 7378 being approximately twice as potent as NAN 190 (ED50 = 15.3 micrograms/kg vs. 34.2 micrograms/kg). The suppression of neuronal activity produced by both compounds was greatly attenuated by spiperone (1 mg/kg i.v.). Systemic administration of (-)-propranolol (2 and 4 mg/kg i.v.) produced a modest suppression of serotonergic neuronal activity which did not appear to be dose-related. The ability of BMY 7378, NAN 190 and (-)-propranolol to block the suppression of neuronal activity produced by 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a selective 5-HT1A agonist, was also examined. Pretreatment with these compounds had no significant effect on the inhibitory response of serotonergic neurons to 8-OH-DPAT challenge. These results indicate that BMY 7378 and NAN 190 act as agonists rather than antagonists at the somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "The value of dobutamine stress echocardiography for detecting coronary artery disease was evaluated in 67 patients with normal left ventricular wall motion at rest who also underwent quantitative angiography. The overall sensitivity and specificity of dobutamine stress echocardiography for detecting coronary artery disease were 83% and 70%, respectively. The sensitivities for detecting multivessel disease and single vessel disease were 92% and 76%, respectively. The sensitivity of dobutamine stress echocardiography was 91% in patients treated without beta-blocker, and 70% in patients treated with beta-blocker (p < 0.001). The relatively low peak heart rate during dobutamine infusion in patients treated with beta-blocker seems to affect the sensitivity of dobutamine stress echocardiography. There were no severe complications during dobutamine infusion. Dobutamine stress echocardiography is a safe and accurate method for detecting coronary artery disease. However, an additional technique to increase peak heart rate in patients treated with beta-blocker such as injection of atropin should be considered.",

    "10": "The observed response to atropine in patients with Chagas' disease suggests abnormality in the innervation of the sinus node. The difference found in the IHRo after TAB indicates involvement of the automaticity of the sinus node. These findings may explain the bradycardia reported in this disease.", 
    "11": "To study the neuromuscular interactions between succinylcholine (Sch) and esmolol, we determined the dose-response relationship of Sch and the neuromuscular actions of the 3xED90 dose of Sch, both prior to and following esmolol pretreatment. Twenty rats were anaesthetized with urethane. Train-of-four stimulation was applied every 12 s to the sciatic nerve, and the electromyogram (EMG) of the tibialis anterior muscle was measured. The results showed that the potency of Sch decreased with esmolol pretreatment. The ED50 of Sch increased significantly, from 191 ug/kg to 227 ug/kg after esmolol infusion, p < 0.05. The duration of EMG depression achieved by the 3xED90 dose of Sch decreased significantly with esmolol pretreatment (12 min vs 14 min p < 0.05), and also the onset time was significantly longer (43 sec vs 28 sec, p < 0.05). There were no significant difference between groups with regard to the maximal block or recovery index. The results of two methods of study demonstrated that the pharmacological interaction between Sch and esmolol is antagonistic instead of potentiating.", 
    "12": "Tachycardia and hypertension usually accompany laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. This response is undesirable, especially in patients with cardiovascular or intracranial diseases. Esmolol is a cardioselective, ultrashort-acting beta adrenergic blocking agent with a very short half-life. The efficacy of bolus dose of esmolol in blunting hemodynamic responses during laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation was evaluated. 45 patients (15 in each group) of ASA physical status I and II scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgery were included in this randomized, placebo-controlled study. At time zero, the study preparation (placebo, 100 or 200 mg of esmolol) was administered intravenously, followed by thiopentone 5 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg for induction. Tracheal intubation was performed 2 minutes after time zero. Anesthesia was maintained with 50% nitrous oxide and 1.0 MAC halothane in oxygen, and vecuronium 0.08 mg/kg. Heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were recorded every minute for 10 minutes. To compare with the placebo group, there was a significant decrease in either HR or SBP in 200 mg group in the 8 minutes course after intubation (p < 0.05). There was a significant decrease in HR in the 100 mg group at the 3rd, 4th, and 5th minutes when compared with the placebo group (p < 0.05). The differences in SBP between the 100 mg group and placebo group were significant at the 3rd and 4th minutes (p < 0.05). Both bolus dosages of esmolol could effectively attenuate the tachycardia and hypertension produced by laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Furthermore, esmolol 200 mg presented a better hemodynamic stability than esmolol 100 mg during induction of anesthesia.", 
    "13": "To assess the minimal effective dosage of esmolol to prevent hypertension and tachycardia during laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in fentanyl-pretreated anesthesia, a double-blinded, randomized study was conducted. Two hundred patients undergoing elective, noncardiac surgeries were randomly allocated into four groups: group A received saline, group B esmolol 20 mg, group C esmolol 40 mg and group D esmolol 60 mg intravenously. General anesthesia was induced with 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium, 5 micrograms/kg fentanyl and 0.3 mg/kg etomidate. Heart rates (HR), systolic blood pressures (SBP), mean arterial pressures (MAP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) were recorded before induction, after induction, before intubation, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 4 minutes, 6 minutes, and 10 minutes after intubation. After intubation HR and SBP increased significantly in group A (86.7 beats/min, 166.6 mmHg) in comparison with groups C (77.6 beats/min, 153.9 mmHg) and D (73.4 beats/min, 153.4 mmHg) (p < 0.05). Tachycardia (HR > 100) was found in 13 of 50(26%) patients in group A, 10 of 50(20%) patients in group B, 7 of 50(14%) patients in group C and 2 of 50(4%) patients in group D. Hypertension (SBP > 180) was found in 18(36%) patients in group A, 19(38%) patients in group B, 9(18%) patients in group C, and 6(12%) patients in group D. When compared with group A, only group D had significantly lower incidence of these adverse events (p < 0.05). In conclusion, fentanyl 5 micrograms/kg could not completely prevent the hemodynamic changes associated with endotracheal intubation, and 60 mg esmolol was observed to have positive effect in helping to control these changes.", 
    "14": "The N-nitroso derivatives formed by the in vitro reaction of 5 beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs with sodium nitrite and previously found to induce DNA fragmentation and repair in primary cultures of both rat and human hepatocytes were tested for their ability to exert a clastogenic effect in vivo. In partially hepatectomized rats given by gavage a single dose of 1000 mg/kg, all 5 N-nitroso derivatives caused a statistically significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated hepatocytes, the clastogenic potencies of NO-propranolol, NO-metoprolol, and NO-nadolol being slightly greater than those of NO-atenolol and NO-sotalol. In contrast, none of them produced a significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow and the spleen. For all 5 N-nitroso derivatives the in vivo clastogenic potency, i.e. the ratio between the number of micronuclei observed in the liver and the dose administered, was markedly lower than the in vitro DNA-damaging potency calculated as the ratio between the amount of DNA fragmentation and the concentration tested. This suggests a preferential detoxification in vivo of the 5 N-nitroso derivatives.", 
    "15": "Exercise and pharmacological stress echocardiography have emerged as convenient alternatives to myocardial scintigraphy. The objective of this study was to compare in the same patients the diagnostic values of exercise, dobutamine, and dipyridamole stress echocardiography tests for detection of myocardial ischemia.", 
    "16": "We performed exercise (maximal treadmill Bruce protocol), dobutamine (up to 40 micrograms/kg per minute) and dipyridamole (up to 0.84 mg/kg over 10 minutes) stress echocardiography tests, in random sequence and on separate days, in 136 consecutive patients. All patients underwent coronary angiography. Significant coronary artery disease was defined by quantitative coronary angiography as a lesion with a diameter stenosis > or = 50%. A stress echocardiogram was considered positive when new or worsening of preexisting wall motion abnormality was observed. Most of the patients (94%) were receiving the same antianginal medication for each stress test; 59 patients were receiving concomitant beta-blocker therapy. The prevalence of coronary artery disease was 87.5%, with 108 patients having one-vessel coronary artery disease. Peak heart rate and systolic blood pressure were higher with exercise than with dobutamine or dipyridamole (P < .01). Sensitivity of exercise, dobutamine, and dipyridamole stress echocardiography was 88%, 82%, and 74% (dipyridamole versus exercise, P < .01), respectively. Specificity was 82%, 77%, and 94%, respectively. The overall accuracy was 87%, 82%, and 77% (dipyridamole versus exercise, P < .01), respectively. The accuracy of dipyridamole was higher (P = .02) in the group of patients not receiving beta-blockers (84%) than in the patients receiving beta-blocker therapy (66%), whereas the accuracy of exercise and dobutamine were only slightly higher in the patients not receiving beta-blockers. Significant side effects occurred in 3%, 11%, and 1% of patients during exercise, dobutamine, and dipyridamole tests, respectively.", 
    "17": "Despite the different hemodynamic effects, exercise, dobutamine, and dipyridamole echocardiography have high overall diagnostic values. In this group of patients with a predominance of one-vessel coronary artery disease, the overall diagnostic accuracy of stress echocardiography tests was higher for exercise than for dobutamine or dipyridamole. Concomitant beta-blocker therapy significantly decreased the accuracy of the dipyridamole stress echocardiography test. Pharmacological stress testing (dipyridamole without beta-blockers) can therefore be used as an efficient option for detection of myocardial ischemia in patients who are unable or poorly motivated to exercise adequately.", 
    "18": "Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase mediates the effects of beta-adrenergic agonists and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on tracheobronchial epithelial cell function by increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In turn, increases in cAMP affect airway function by modulating ciliary beating, chloride and water transport, mucus secretion, and release of bronchoactive substances. This study examined the function and regulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylyl cyclase system (beta AR-AC) in tracheal epithelial cells isolated from the rabbit, a frequently used animal model of airway reactivity, inflammation, and electrolyte transport. beta AR number, assessed by ligand binding using the non-subtype-specific beta-antagonist [125I]iodopindolol, averaged approximately 10,700 beta AR/cell (400 fmol/mg membrane protein). Greater than 85% of the receptors were of the beta 2 subtype as determined by competitive antagonist displacement of iodopindolol by selective beta 1- (betaxolol) and beta 2- (ICI 118,551) antagonists. cAMP synthesis was stimulated with isoproterenol, PGE2, and forskolin in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. Preincubation of epithelial cells for 30 min with either isoproterenol (10 microM) or the peptide inflammatory mediator, bradykinin (100 microM), markedly depressed subsequent isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP synthesis. Isoproterenol-induced beta AR-AC desensitization appeared to be homologous since cAMP responses to PGE2 and forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase, were not reduced. The effect of bradykinin on isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP response was mimicked by preincubation with either dioctanoyl glyceride or phorbol myristate acetate, activators of protein kinase C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The patients were given 14/190 mg metoprolol, 100 mg atenolol, and placebo once daily for a 7-day period each in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. At the estimated time of peak plasma concentrations, cumulative doses of salbutamol (12.5, 37.5, 112.5, 412.5, 812.5, and 1612.5 micrograms) were applied every 20 minutes. Specific airway conductance, finger tremor amplitude, heart rate, and blood pressure were registered at baseline and at each dose increment. The slopes of the salbutamol dose-response curves of specific airway conductance did not differ on day 1 (P > .05). On day 7, atenolol caused a shift of the dose-response curves of specific airway conductance to the right (P < .05), whereas metoprolol was indistinguishable from placebo (P > .05). The median cumulative salbutamol concentrations causing a 50% increase in specific airway conductance were 416 and 384 micrograms (days 1 and 7, respectively) for placebo, 594 and 444 micrograms for metoprolol, and 562 and 1419 micrograms for atenolol. The median cumulative salbutamol concentrations causing a 35% increase in tremor were 732 and 706 micrograms for placebo, 812 and 1213 micrograms for metoprolol, and 797 and 1323 micrograms for atenolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Severe sinus bradycardia and hypotension accompanied by light-headedness, cold sweating, and nausea occurred at 80 degrees head-up position during 4 micrograms/min isoproterenol infusion. Oral propranolol, 160 mg/d, in four divided doses, effectively prevented the above-mentioned abnormal vasovagal reflexes; diltiazem was only partially effective while disopyramide, aminophylline, or atropine was ineffective in preventing the abnormal vasovagal reflexes induced by head-up tilt with isoproterenol infusion. However, the patient experienced ten episodes of syncope in 2 weeks after he was discharged from the hospital on a regimen of atenolol, 50 mg/d. His symptoms ameliorated immediately after discontinuation of atenolol therapy and he became free of severe symptoms while receiving fludrocortisone. Thus, we have documented a patient with worsening of vasovagal syncope after beta-blocker therapy.",

Unstimulated and stimulated saliva flow rates, total protein concentrations, and protein secretion rates were compared from medicated (various beta-antagonists, n = 25) and control (n = 60) subjects. Age-related decreases were found in unstimulated parotid saliva flow rate (p = .011) and protein secretion rate (p = .04), unstimulated submandibular salivary flow rate (p = .005) and protein secretion rate (p = .010), and in stimulated submandibular flow rate (p = .002) and protein secretion rate (p = .006). A drug-related effect was observed only in unstimulated parotid salivary flow (p = .033) and protein secretion rate (p = .04) from medicated subjects. Results from this study indicate that age and beta-adrenergic blockade alter salivary glandular function, but their effects differ with the type of salivary secretion examined.", 
    "29": "Effects of the non-selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) on the nociceptive responsiveness in a hot plate and tail flick tests were examined in mice. Intraperitoneal administration of m-CPP (1-10 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent antinociception in both those tests; the effect of m-CPP in the hot plate test was stronger. The antinociceptive effect of m-CPP in either test was abolished by pretreatment with mesulergine (2 mg/kg), ritanserin (1-2 mg/kg), 5-HT2A/5-HT2C receptor antagonists, and metergoline (0.5-2 mg/kg), a non-selective 5-HT receptor antagonist. On the other hand, spiperone (0.25-0.5 mg/kg), a dopamine, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor antagonist; pindolol (4-8 mg/kg), a beta-adrenoceptor, 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor antagonist and zacopride (0.1-1 mg/kg) a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, did not affect the analgesia induced by m-CPP. Neither of the drugs used as putative receptor antagonists changed the nociceptive responsiveness in mice. The obtained results suggest that the analgesia induced by m-CPP is mediated by 5-HT2C receptors.", 
    "30": "The molecular interaction of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens (Ag) and of beta-adrenergic receptors was previously demonstrated on lymphocytes. By long-term culturing with high concentration of foetal calf serum, the murine S49 lymphoma cell line was modified (S49m) giving phenotypic alterations in beta-adrenergic receptors and class I Ag expression. S49m cells displayed a reduced number of beta-adrenergic sites that were uncoupled to the adenylate cyclase system. These were unable to respond to beta agonist stimulation, despite the fact that direct activation of Gs could be achieved with aluminium tetrafluoride. Although S49m cells showed normal expression of the thy 1.2 Ag, they displayed no expression of class I Ag of the d haplotype. This was assessed by the evident lack of cytotoxic activity of specific monoclonal antibodies (Mo Ab) and of their binding. When performing IFI staining on permeabilized cells, we found positive staining with anti-class d Ab inside the cell. This loss of expression and activity of beta-adrenoceptors and the internalization of class I Ag were accompanied by a higher rate of proliferation in S49m cells. The possibility that the loss of both molecules would modify the biology of the cell is also discussed.", 
    "31": "To assess by serial quantitative angiography, the significance of clinical and angiographic variables that affect the progression of coronary artery disease (CAD). Progression of disease by sequential angiography is unpredictable and the role of clinical risk factors controversial. Various intervention trials have demonstrated less progression and even regression in hyperlipidemic patients. Correlates of progression have included a younger age, unstable angina, and greater involvement of the coronary arteries, with few studies looking at angiographic features of individual lesions. Serial angiograms on 74 patients were analyzed by computer assisted quantitative angiography using absolute measurements. A total of 99 diseased segments were analyzed for progression defined as an absolute reduction of 20% in luminal cross-sectional area. A preliminary correlation coefficient was calculated for each of the clinical and angiographic variables to detect any association with progression, and the odds ratio determined. The presence of any of the clinical risk factors-diabetes, hypertension, serum cholesterol, smoking, and a family history of coronary disease could not predict progression. The use of beta blockers was three times less likely to be associated with progression (odds ratio 0.33). While the presence of distal disease was associated with progression of a more proximal lesion (odds ratio 2.4), eccentricity, branch point location, lesion length, calcification, thrombus, or the presence of collaterals did not influence progression of disease in an individual segment. In conclusion, the presence of any of the clinical risk factors could not predict progression of disease in an individual coronary segment as determined by serial quantitative angiography, and the use of beta blockers and the absence of coexistent distal disease was associated with less progression of disease in an individual coronary segment. This may be related to changes in wall stress, reduced platelet interactions, and the integrity and permeability of the vascular endothelium to lipids.", 
    "32": "In this study we quantified insulin-mediated glucose uptake in weight-matched (260-330 g) fed (6-8 h fast) and fasted (24 h fast) male rats with spontaneous hypertension (SHR) and control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. To accomplish this goal, rats were infused continuously for 165 min with glucose and insulin. Blood was taken at frequent intervals from 120-165 min, and the values averaged to determine the steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) and insulin (SSPI) concentrations. In some studies epinephrine and propranolol were added to the infusate in order to suppress endogenous insulin secretion. Steady-state plasma insulin (SSPI) concentrations were similar in SHR and WKY during the three infusion studies (382-483 pmol/L). However, SSPG was significantly higher in fed SHR as compared to fed WKY during infusions performed with (9.4 +/- 0.8 vs 7.0 +/- 0.4 mmol/L, p < 0.05) or without (8.6 +/- 0.2 vs 7.0 +/- 0.6 mmol/L, p < 0.05) epinephrine and propranolol in the infusate. In contrast, SSPG concentrations (mmol/L) were similar in SHR (6.8 +/- 0.3) and WKY rats (6.5 +/- 0.6) when they were studied after a 24 h fast. These results demonstrates that differences in insulin-mediated glucose removal from plasma between SHR and WKY rats will vary as a function of nutritional status.",

In addition, the study will examine the effects on morbidity and mortality of a low dose, 75 mg daily, of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) or placebo. In the HOT Study, basic antihypertensive treatment is initiated with the calcium antagonist felodipine at a dose of 5 mg daily. If target blood pressure is not reached, additional antihypertensive therapy with either an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent is given. Further dosage adjustments are made in accordance with a set protocol. As a fifth and final step, a diuretic may be added. Inclusion of patients was stopped on April 30, 1994. At that time 19,196 patients had been randomized. There were 9,055 (47%) women and 10,141 (53%) men with an average age of 61.5 +/- 7.5 (SD) years. At enrollment, 52% of patients were receiving antihypertensive treatment. These patients entered a wash-out period of at least 2 weeks before randomization. The average randomization blood pressure in untreated patients was 169 +/- 14/106 +/- 3 mmHg and in the treated patients 170 +/- 14/105 +/- 3 mmHg. On August 15, 1994, blood pressure data were available for 14,710 and 10,275 patients, who had completed 3 and 6 months treatment, respectively. The average reduction in diastolic blood pressure was 22 mmHg after 6 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "The present studies examined the involvement of peripheral beta-adrenergic receptor activity in the establishment and expression of conditioned morphine-induced alterations of immune status. Previous work in our laboratory has shown that morphine's immunomodulatory effects can become conditioned to environmental stimuli which predict drug administration. These immune alterations include conditioned changes in natural killer cell activity, interleukin-2 production, and mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation. During the training phase of these experiments, Lewis rats received two conditioning sessions during which a subcutaneous injection of 15 mg/kg morphine sulfate was paired with exposure to a distinctive environment. On the test day, rats were reexposed to the conditioned stimulus prior to sacrifice. Saline or nadolol (0.002, 0.02, 0.2, or 2.0 mg/kg) was administered either prior to the training sessions or prior to the test session. Administration of nadolol prior to training did not affect the development of conditioned alterations of immune status. Conversely, nadolol administration prior to testing completely attenuated the expression of a subset of the conditioned morphine-induced changes in immune status. Taken together, these studies suggest that whereas peripheral beta-adrenergic receptor activity is not required for the establishment of conditioned morphine-induced alterations of immune status, it is involved in the expression of a subset of these conditioned immunomodulatory effects.", 
    "35": "Aconitine and higenamine are the components of aconite root. We investigated the cardiac effects of these compounds on murine right and left atria and the interaction of higenamine with aconitine on the rate of spontaneously beating right atria. Higenamine increased the rate (EC50 = 38 nM) and the force of contraction (EC50 = 97 nM), the maximal responses being comparable with those of isoproterenol. The positive chronotropic effect of higenamine was antagonized by propranolol (30-300 nM) and practolol (10 nM-3 microM), but not by butoxamine (1 microM), indicating that it was a beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated action. The positive chronotropic effect of higenamine was not changed by pretreatment with reserpine (4 mg/kg, i.p., 4 hr). Aconitine (0.16-0.25 microM) induced tachyarrhythmia in right atria was attenuated by quinidine (1 microM), atropine (8.6 microM) and AF-DX 116 (8.6 microM), suggesting that aconitine activates sodium channels and muscarinic receptors. Higenamine (2.5 nM) and dobutamine (1 nM) did not cause chronotropic effects by themselves, but enhanced the aconitine-induced tachyarrhythmia. These results indicate that higenamine is a beta 1-adrenoceptor full agonist in murine atria and that the aconitine-induced tachyarrhythmia is augmented by the beta 1-adrenergic action of higenamine.", 
    "36": "The neural mechanisms underlying the penile erection induced by serotonergic, cholinergic and dopaminergic stimulants were comparatively investigated. Fenfluramine (0.1-10 mg/kg, i.p.), pilocarpine (0.032-3.2 mg/kg) and apomorphine (0.01-1 mg/kg) induced penile erection in rats with bell-shaped dose-response curves. The penile erection induced by fenfluramine (1 mg/kg) was dose-dependently antagonized by pindolol (0.1-3.2 mg/kg), a 5-HT1 antagonist, or scopolamine (0.032-1 mg/kg), a muscarinic antagonist, but not by sulpiride (1-32 mg/kg), a dopaminergic antagonist. The penile erection induced by pilocarpine (0.32 mg/kg) was countered by pindolol or scopolamine but not by sulpiride, while that induced by apomorphine (0.032 mg/kg) was countered by all three antagonists. Septo-hippocampal cholinergic deafferentations by medial septum lesioning or fimbria-fornix transection also significantly attenuated the penile erection induced by fenfluramine or apomorphine, but scarcely affected that induced by pilocarpine. Raphe lesion by injections of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, a serotonergic neurotoxin, into the median- and dorsal-raphe nuclei significantly attenuated the penile erections induced by fenfluramine and apomorphine but not that by pilocarpine. These results suggest that a neuronal link between the dopaminergic, serotonergic and cholinergic systems plays a crucial role in the expression of penile erection; dopaminergic stimulation causes an activation of the raphe serotonergic neurons which in turn enhances the septo-hippocampal cholinergic pathway and results in expression of penile erection.", 
    "37": "Milrinone is an inotropic and vasodilator agent proven to be effective in the treatment of heart failure. This study evaluated whether milrinone produces inotropic and hemodynamic effects independent of reflex adrenergic stimulation. Eleven stable heart failure patients (New York Heart Association class II to III) undergoing cardiac catheterization received intravenous (i.v.) milrinone (50 micrograms/kg for 10 minutes followed by 0.5 micrograms/kg/min for 50 minutes) during beta-adrenergic blockade. After beta-blockade with a 50-mg oral dose of metoprolol, heart rate decreased by a mean of 16.6%. The peak inotropic response to i.v. milrinone measured using the maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (LV dP/dt) was fully developed at 20 minutes. Mean absolute inotropic response of LV dP/dt from baseline was statistically significant at 10, 20, 30, and 40 minutes (P < 0.05). Mean percentage increase in cardiac index from baseline was statistically significant at 20 and 30 minutes, and mean absolute decline from baseline for pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was statistically significant at 20 and 40 minutes (P < 0.05). The inotropic and hemodynamic effects of i.v. milrinone were thus preserved during beta-adrenergic blockade. This finding is consistent with a mechanism of action of i.v. milrinone--myocardial phosphodiesterase inhibition--that is independent of reflex adrenergic stimulation.",

The results were identical for all samples. Excitation at the red edge of the absorption spectrum of TNS leads to an important shift (15 nm) of the fluorescence emission maximum of the probe. This reveals that emission of TNS occurs before relaxation of the amino acid dipole has time to occur. Emission from a non-relaxed state means that TNS molecules are bound tightly to the protein, a result confirmed by polarization studies. Sialic acid residues and propranolol do not affect the rigidity of the binding site of TNS.", 
    "52": "Level of thymidylate synthase (TS) mRNA elevated about 6-fold compared with the normal in 24 h-regenerating rat liver after partial hepatectomy. This elevation of TS mRNA level was coupled with that of the activity. After 24h, the TS mRNA level began to decline steeply and returned to the normal level at 72h, when TS activity remained at the maximal level. alpha-Adrenergic regulation of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, which was shown in our previous paper, was found to be occurred at mRNA level of TS. The administration of cycloheximide resulted in the decreases of both TS activity and TS mRNA level while actinomycin D had no effect. This suggested that the increase of TS mRNA in regenerating liver required the de novo synthesis of some activator protein(s).",

The Scatchard analysis of the data demonstrated a uniphasic plot with Kd and Bmax values of 0.86 +/- 0.16 nM, and 13.34 +/- 1.11 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The pKi values of bopindolol and its two metabolites for beta 2-adrenoceptors in the bovine mesenteric artery were 7.70 +/- 0.13, 8.07 +/- 0.13, 8.20 +/- 0.24, respectively, with 20-785 showing the highest values among these drugs.

    "54": "We questioned whether the prolonged stimulation of ciliary beat frequency (CBF) to a short exposure of low-dose capsaicin (Wong et al. J. Appl. Physiol. 68: 257-2580, 1990) could be due to the activation of indirect pathways involving neural reflexes initiated independently in the bronchi and alveoli. Tracheal CBF (CBFtr) was measured temporally in anesthetized groups of 10 dogs by means of heterodyne-mode correlation analysis laser light scattering. To elucidate the site of the afferent neural stimulation and the efferent mediators affecting the ciliated epithelium, capsaicin (3 nM) aerosol was delivered for 4 min, either predominantly to the bronchi or to the alveolar regions, with use of pulsed aerosol techniques. This resulted in 13 pg of bronchial (85%) and 10 pg of alveolar (96%) capsaicin deposited, which caused marked stimulation of CBFtr with maxima at 7 and 35 min, respectively. Prior administration of aerosolized indomethacin to the bronchi or aerosolized cromolyn to the alveoli inhibited the bronchial and alveolar responses, respectively. Prior administration of aerosolized hexamethonium to the tracheal lumen blocked the stimulatory CBFtr responses from both capsaicin challenges. Ipratropium or propranolol aerosols delivered to the tracheal lumen also inhibited these responses. It is proposed that these pathways comprise one set of sensitive mechanisms to ensure a prolonged stimulation of CBF to effect the removal of secretions and the irritant from the lungs.", 
    "55": "The intravenous and oral dose kinetics and metabolism of the enantiomers of propranolol were investigated in five dogs during steady-state oral racemic propranolol dosing (5 mg/kg, every 8 hr for 3 days). These results were compared with those obtained during concomitant administration of oral diltiazem (2.5 mg/kg, every 8 hr for 3 days) in the same animals. The oral and intravenous propranolol test doses consisted of a pseudoracemic mixture of equal amounts of hexadeuterated-(R-(+))- and dideuterated-(S-(-))-propranolol. Propranolol metabolism in the urine was evaluated by coadministering 150 muCi of [4'-3H]racemic propranolol HCl, along with the deuterium-labeled compounds. Plasma concentrations of the deuterated enantiomers were measured by HPLC-thermospray MS, using undecadeuterated racemic propranolol as the internal standard. Diltiazem coadministration had no significant effects on either the systemic clearance, renal clearance, the apparent volume of distribution, or the elimination half-lives of either enantiomer. On the other hand, concomitant diltiazem treatment significantly reduced the oral clearance of S-(-)- and R-(+)-propranolol by 58 and 61%, respectively. These reductions resulted in an increase in their respective apparent steady-state oral availabilities of 129 and 106%. The S/R enantiomeric ratio of the oral availability of propranolol was not significantly changed from control. The urinary propranolol metabolites were isolated and purified by solvent extraction and HPLC and quantitated by radioactivity. Twelve metabolites, including propranolol, were isolated and quantitated in the urine. A significant reduction in the percentage of ring oxidation products and a significant increase in the percentage of naphthoxylactic acid and propranolol glucuronide excreted in the urine occurred in the diltiazem-treated animals. The S/R enantiomeric ratios of urinary excreted propranolol, propranolol glucuronide, 4'-hydroxypropranolol glucuronide, and its sulfate were not altered by diltiazem. These results suggest that the decreased oral clearances of the enantiomers of propranolol by diltiazem is caused by a selective decrease in the formation of ring-oxidized products.", 
    "56": "Incubation of R(+)- and S(-)-carvedilol with rat liver microsomes showed the formation of four oxidative metabolites: 1-hydroxycarvedilol (1-OHC), 8-hydroxycarvedilol (8-OHC), 4'-hydroxycarvedilol (4'-OHC), and O-desmethylcarvedilol (DesC). The structures of these metabolites were confirmed by cochromatography with the authentic metabolites and by thermospray ms. As expected from in vivo metabolism studies, 1-OHC and 8-OHC were the major products for both enantioners used as a substrate. The S/R enantiomeric ratios for intrinsic clearance (Vmax/KM) of 1-OHC, 8-OHC, DesC, and 4'-OHC were 0.40, 1.99, 0.77, and 2.71, respectively, showing that stereoselective oxidation occurs in this species. These findings strongly suggest that the stereoselective biliary excretion of the two major carbazole ring-hydroxylated glucuronides, 1-hydroxycarvedilol O-glucuronide, and 8-hydroxycarvedilol O-glucuronide observed previously in rats can be explained by stereoselective hydroxylation in liver. The cause of the difference in intrinsic clearance for 1-OHC and 8-OHC between the two enantiomers was based on the difference in affinity to the catalyzing enzyme. The main enzyme concerned in the 1- and 8-hydroxylation of both enantiomers is considered to be CYP2D1 from the following observation: the marked strain differences between Sprague-Dawley and Dark Agouti rats and competitive inhibition by quinine. In the O-demethylation of both enantiomers, CYP2C11 is probably the major catalyzing enzyme, because sex differences, but no strain difference, were observed in both Sprague-Dawley and Dark Agouti rats, and also anti-CYP2C11 strongly inhibited this demethylation.", 
    "57": "Although limited numbers of elderly subjects have occasionally been included in population-based studies, only a few studies have been conducted specifically on elderly hypertensives, and practically none at a population level. We studied 655 hypertensive subjects from a cohort of 2,254 elderly subjects. The intervention consisted of the creation of a Hypertension Outpatients' Clinic under our auspices but with complete co-operation from general practitioners, randomizing the identified hypertensive patients into pre-established therapeutic drug regimens, and early follow-up recording of mortality for 7 years. The drugs used were clonidine (n = 61), nifedipine (n = 146) and the fixed combination of atenolol+chlorthalidone (n = 144); 304 subjects underwent \"free therapy\" by their personal physicians without any special intervention. There were 1,404 normotensive subjects. Overall 7-year follow-up mortality was 34.9% in the hypertensive subjects receiving \"free therapy\", 22.5% in those receiving \"special care\", and 24.2% in the normotensives. Cardiovascular mortality was respectively 23.7%, 12.2%, and 12.0%. Overall and cardiovascular annual cumulative mortality were significantly lower in the < special therapy > than in the < free therapy > group.

    "58": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the intestinal permeability of ophthalmic beta-blockers and evaluate the utility of intestinal membrane for predicting the ocular permeability. The penetrations of beta-blockers were measured across the isolated jejunum and colon of the albino rabbit using a two-chamber glass diffusion cell. beta-Blockers tested include atenolol, carteolol, tilisolol, timolol, and befunolol. Colonic membrane showed lower permeability of hydrophilic drugs than jejunal membrane. Scraping the entire cell monolayer of jejunum increased the drug permeability. There was a significant correlation between colonic permeability coefficients and lipophilicities of beta-blockers. The permeability coefficients through jejunum and scraped jejunum were not susceptible to drug lipophilicities. Jejunum, scraped jejunum, and colon showed permeability coefficients almost equal to those of sclera, conjunctiva, and cornea, respectively. There was a significant correlation between permeability coefficients through colon and cornea. These results indicate that the steady-state permeability of ophthalmic beta-blockers through ocular membranes may be predicted by measuring the permeability through certain intestinal membranes. However, the analyses of intestinal permeability using Fick's equation showed the functional difference of intestinal permeability from ocular permeability of ophthalmic beta-blockers.",

    "61": "A low dose of levcromakalim (0.01 mg/kg) was selected, which decreased blood pressure by 25% but had almost no electrophysiologic effect on AV nodal or ventricular conduction or effective refractory period. In dogs with chronic AV block, the antiarrhythmic action of this dose of levcromakalim was evaluated in three models of abnormal impulse formation: (1) d-sotalol (2 mg/kg) induced torsades de pointes VT, initiated by early afterdepolarizations (EADs), (2) sustained ouabain-induced VTs, which are dependent on delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs), and (3) VT occurring 24 hours after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion, which are likely based on abnormal automaticity. Levcromakalim abolished d-sotalol induced U waves, ventricular ectopic beats, and self-terminating bouts of torsades de pointes. Induction of torsades de pointes by pacing was also completely prevented. The cycle length of the idioventricular rhythm, which was lengthened after d-sotalol from 1490 +/- 515 to 1700 +/- 610 msec (P < 0.05), remained similar after levcromakalim (1655 +/- 580 msec). The QT(U) duration, which was increased after d-sotalol from 410 +/- 55 to 550 +/- 40 msec (P < 0.05), normalized to 405 +/- 70 msec (P < 0.05). Levcromakalim did not suppress but rather enhanced ouabain-induced VT by decreasing the cycle length slightly from 315 +/- 35 to 290 +/- 35 msec (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with a beta blocker prevented this acceleration in rate. Finally, levcromakalim had no effect on VT 24 hours after infarction.",

The dorsal hand vein technique was used to determine whether nebivolol has venodilator action in vivo in man. 3. Nebivolol and atenolol were infused into the phenylephrine preconstricted superficial hand veins of 11 healthy male volunteers. In separate studies L-NMMA (0.1 microgram min-1) was pre- and co-infused with nebivolol to determine whether nitric oxide (NO) mediated mechanisms were present. Further studies with prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) preconstriction were performed to exclude an alpha-adrenergic antagonistic effect of nebivolol. Effects of L-NMMA infusion on nitroglycerin venodilation were also determined. 4. Nebivolol produced a dose dependent venodilation, (72 +/- 18% maximum), whereas atenolol produced no significant venodilation. At doses of nebivolol producing plasma concentrations comparable with plasma levels achieved after standard oral dosing (10(-13)-10(-12) mol min-1) small (14 +/- 6% and 23 +/- 8%) but significant (P < 0.05) venodilation was observed. 5. The venodilator response to nebivolol was significantly reduced by infusion of L-NMMA (maximum dilation 18% vs 72%, P < 0.01). Venodilator responses to nitroglycerin were unaffected by L-NMMA infusion. A venodilator effect to nebivolol was also seen following preconstriction with PgF2 alpha (40 +/- 20% maximum). 6.

    "64": "Supersensitivity of adenylyl cyclase after exposure to inhibitory agonists is a general means of cellular adaptation. We hypothesized that such \"crosstalk\" between muscarinic cholinergic agonists, beta 1-adrenoceptors, and adenylyl cyclase may be an important mechanism of cardiac adaptation to interventions that enhance vagal activity. We used primary cultures of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes and measured beta-adrenoceptors by radioligand binding and adenylyl cyclase activity by a single column method. Carbachol induced a time- and dose-dependent reversible decrease in cell surface beta 1-adrenoceptors. The peak effect occurred after 20 h of exposure to 100 microM carbachol which caused a decrease in the maximum number of binding sites for the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist 3H-CGP-12177 from 42.3 +/- 3.4 to 33.0 +/- 2.6 fmol/mg protein (n = 12, P < 0.03) without a change in antagonist affinity. Loss of cell surface receptors was prevented by atropine and by the protein kinase C inhibitor H7. The decrease in cell surface receptors was not accompanied by receptor internalization as assessed by equilibrium binding experiments in a cytosolic fraction using 125I-iodocyanopindolol. In contrast to the well-known acute inhibitory effects of carbachol on adenylyl cyclase activation, prolonged carbachol exposure preserved (-)-isoprenaline-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity and enhanced postreceptor stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Carbachol did not further enhance adenylyl cyclase activity after pretreatment with pertussis toxin. The protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine prevented the carbachol induced enhancement of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. We conclude that prolonged incubation with carbachol in rat neonatal ventricular myocytes causes a reduction in cell surface beta 1-Adrenoceptor density. beta 1-Adrenoceptor-mediated adenylyl cyclase activity is preserved and postreceptor-mediated adenylyl cyclase activity is augmented. Our data suggest that carbachol-stimulated protein kinase C activity may play a key role in the prolonged muscarinic regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity.", 
    "65": "Previous studies using cultured bovine trabecular meshwork cells demonstrated at least two different cell types which were distinguishable morphologically and electrophysiologically. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the electrical membrane properties of cultured human trabecular meshwork cells. Seven different human trabecular meshwork cell lines were grown from four different donors. One trabecular meshwork cell line was transformed by microinjection with SV40 DNA. The electrochemical properties of these TM cells were determined by micropuncture with glass microelectrodes. The mean membrane voltage at resting conditions differed between the cell lines (-33.3 to -58.7 mV). Application of 10-mmol l-1 Ba2+ induced repetitive voltage spikes in all cell lines. The voltage transients similar to action potentials were inhibited by nifedipine, but insensitive to tetrodotoxin. Acetylcholine evoked depolarizations in three cell lines which were blocked by atropine. In one cell line isoproterenol caused sustained depolarizations sensitive to metipranolol. All three of the cell lines tested depolarized upon application of the vasoactive peptide endothelin-1. All untransformed cell lines showed voltage spikes typical for smooth muscle cells and functional receptors for endothelin-1 and cholinergic agonists. One out of three cell lines tested possessed beta-adrenergic receptors influencing the membrane voltage.", 
    "66": "Seven patients with histologically verified small cell lung carcinoma were given an oral glucose load of 75 g on two occasions to examine the effect of glucose on whole body and forearm thermogenesis with and without acute beta-adrenergic inhibition with propranolol. Whole body energy expenditure was measured by the open circuit ventilated hood system. Forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion strain-gauge plethysmography. The uptake of oxygen in the forearm was calculated as the product of the forearm blood flow and the difference in arteriovenous oxygen concentration. The glucose-induced thermogenesis in the 120 min following the glucose load was significantly reduced by beta-adrenergic inhibition with approximately 50% from 63.9 +/- 5.8 kJ 120 min-1 (mean +/- SE) to 27.8 +/- 9.8 kJ 120 min-1 (P < 0.01). Almost the entire reduction took place from 60 to 120 min (P < 0.005). The integrated glucose-induced forearm oxygen uptake in the period 60-120 min following the glucose load was significantly reduced after beta-adrenergic inhibition from 103 +/- 28 mumol 100 g-1 60 min-1 to 29 +/- 29 mumol 100 g-1 60 min-1 (P < 0.05). The noreadrenaline concentration in the arterial blood was not increased in the baseline period compared to healthy elderly; it increased following the glucose load while there was no demonstrable increase in adrenaline concentration in the two experiments. It is suggested that these patients have increased sensitivity of the beta-adrenergic receptors and an early facultative component of the glucose-induced thermogenesis in part takes place in the forearm.",

After a haemodynamic assessment considered as initial a bolus of 1.5 mg/kg of propafenone was given during a period of 30 seconds and similar assessments were made 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after.", 
    "70": "Before propafenone, heart rate was significantly higher in Group II-isoflurane (p < 0.05). After propafenone we found: In both Groups, a decrease in the cardiac output (p < 0.05) with the mean arterial pressure maintained; in Group I (halothane) a decrease in the stroke volume (p < 0.05) which was not found in Group II (p = ns); In Group II (isoflurane) a decrease in heart rate (p < 0.05) not found in Group I (p = ns). All the changes were higher at the 5th minute values. 30th minute and 60th minute values were not significantly different from initial values.", 
    "71": "In dogs anaesthetized with halothane 1.2 MAC a reduction in the stroke volume, resulting in a cardiac output decrease, was observed, suggesting that propafenone increases the negative inotropic action of halothane. In dogs anaesthetized with isoflurane 1.2 MAC the decrease in cardiac output was similar to the decrease in heart rate, and therefore no reduction in the stroke volume was observed. The decrease in the heart rate found in this group but not in the halothane group was probably related with the beta-blocker action of the propafenone. Looking to the systemic vascular resistances, our study suggested that propafenone didn't have any vasodilator effect during halogenated anaesthesia.", 
    "72": "Several studies during the past 15 years have shown that antihypertensive therapy with different types of drugs can reduce microalbuminuria or clinical proteinuria and retard the progression toward end-stage renal failure. However, some authors reported disparate renal protective effects of different antihypertensive drugs in diabetic animals and humans. In an attempt to resolve the controversy surrounding this possibility, previously we reported a meta-analysis of published studies in diabetics with microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria treated with conventional agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or calcium antagonists (Ca2+ antagonists). Here we present an updated meta-analysis of published studies in diabetics with microalbuminuria or clinical proteinuria (UProt), treated during > or = 4 weeks with ACE inhibitors, Ca2+ antagonists, or conventional therapy (diuretic and/or beta-blocker). Despite similar blood pressure (BP) reductions, UProt tended to decrease more on ACE inhibitors (on average -45%) than on conventional therapy (on average -23%) or Ca2+ antagonists other than nifedipine (on average -35%); in contrast, UProt tended to increase slightly on nifedipine (on average 5%, P < .05). On the basis of multiple regression analysis, ACE inhibitor-induced UProt changes correlated with BP changes (r = 0.77, P < .00001), averaged -28% at zero BP change, and varied 1.5% for each percent BP change. On conventional therapy, UProt and BP changes also correlated (r = 0.62, P < .005), but UProt began to decrease only after a BP reduction of > 5% and the slope was steeper (4% UProt change per percent BP change) than on ACE inhibitors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "73": "The effects of several beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on the desipramine-induced increase in aggressive behavior in long-term isolated mice were examined. Desipramine HCl (10 mg/kg, IP) significantly increased the duration of aggressive behavior in isolated mice but did not significantly change the latency to the first attack consistent with our previous reports. Intraperitoneal administration of (+/- )propranolol HCl (2.5-10 mg/kg), a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, dose dependently attenuated the desipramine-induced enhancement of aggressive behavior without significantly affecting the basal aggressive responses. ICI118,551 HCl (1.25-5 mg/kg, IP), a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, also blocked the desipramine-induced enhancement of aggressive behavior in a dose-dependent manner, whereas metoprolol tartrate (5-20 mg/kg, IP), a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, did not affect it. Moreover, clenbuterol HCl (0.1-0.5 mg/kg, IP), a lipophilic beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, significantly increased the duration of basal aggressive behavior. Taken together with our previous finding that the desipramine-induced enhancement of aggressive behavior can be blocked by yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, the present results indicate that not only alpha 2- but also beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation plays important roles in modulation of aggressive behavior in long-term isolated mice.", 
    "74": "Timolol eyedrops may cause systemic side-effects in glaucoma patients due to absorption of the drug into systemic circulation. In a previous study, timolol concentrations in plasma were reduced if timolol was administered in ocular inserts instead of eyedrops. We compared the intraocular pressure lowering effect and systemic absorption of timolol inserts to those of 0.5% timolol eyedrops in humans. Inserts of silicone tubing released 90.3 +/- 13.9 micrograms of timolol in 24 hours in vivo. Timolol inserts afforded similar decreases in intraocular pressure in open-angle glaucoma patients as did b.i.d. eyedrops, but produced lower peak timolol concentrations in plasma, 0.70 +/- 0.10 ng/ml and 0.24 +/- 0.05 ng/ml, respectively. After eyedrops, peak concentrations were achieved at 15.0 +/- 2.2 min, while application of an insert resulted in a delayed peak (tmax = 623 +/- 195 min). The insert resulted in a higher systemically absorbed fraction of the timolol dose than the eyedrop, but the peak timolol concentration and daily absorbed amount of timolol were decreased. The release rate of timolol from the inserts in vivo was only slightly less than that in vitro. Silicone devices are useful for clinical testing of controlled delivery properties of ocular drugs.",

    "77": "We investigated the effects of intraperitoneal administration of adrenoceptor antagonists to the hyperthermia and hyperglycemia induced by prostaglandin F2 alpha (50 micrograms) injected into the third cerebral ventricle in anesthetized rats. Phentolamine inhibited the hyperthermia and hyperglycemia induced by prostaglandin F2 alpha. Prazosin inhibited the hyperthermia induced by prostaglandin F2 alpha, while enhancing the hyperglycemia. Yohimbine inhibited the prostaglandin F2 alpha-induced hyperglycemia without an effect on the hyperthermia. Propranolol had no effect on either prostaglandin F2 alpha-induced hyperglycemia or hyperthermia. These observations suggest that the hyperglycemia induced by prostaglandin F2 alpha is regulated by alpha 2-adrenoceptor systems while the hyperthermia is regulated by alpha 1-adrenoceptor systems in rats.", 
    "78": "The effects of prolonged administration of antidepressant drugs, belonging to three different classes, on high-affinity GABAA receptor, GABAB receptor and beta-adrenoceptor binding parameters were determined in the frontal cortex of olfactory bulbectomised rats. Clorgyline (1 mg/kg/day), paroxetine (10 mg/kg/day) or desipramine (10 mg/kg/day) were administered for 21 days via subcutaneous osmotic minipumps implanted in the scapular region 7 days after bulbectomy. Cortical GABAA receptor densities, defined with [3H]gamma-aminobutyric acid ([3H]GABA), were significantly increased following bulbectomy. This effect on Bmax values was reversed by all three antidepressant drugs. GABAB receptor densities decreased slightly after bulbectomy. Chronic antidepressant administration had no effect on GABAB receptor binding parameters. Olfactory bulbectomy did not induce any changes in cortical beta-adrenoceptor binding parameters determined with [3H]CGP-12177 ((-)-4-(3-t- butylamino-2-hydroxypropxy)- [5,7-3H]benzimidazol-2-one). However, prolonged administration of all three antidepressant drugs induced a downregulation of beta-adrenoceptors. The results of the present study confirm the involvement of cortical GABAA rather than GABAB receptors in the olfactory bulbectomy animal model of human depression. Moreover, the data further support the hypothesis that a decrease in function of the GABAA receptor complex could play a role in the therapeutic effects of antidepressant treatments.", 
    "79": "When treating cardiovascular disorders such as arterial hypertension, the major goal of treatment is to reduce morbidity and mortality. The present review will concentrate on how the treatment of cardiovascular disorders affects mortality. Hypertension studies performed in the 1950s showed that treatment of malignant hypertension improved five year survival dramatically. More recent studies in patients with nonmalignant hypertension have shown positive effects on mortality as well, especially with regard to the treatment of hypertension in the elderly. Other cardiovascular disorders have also been treated successfully with regard to mortality. This is true in particular of postmyocardial infarction patients, in whom beta-blocker treatment has been effective. Moreover, patients with congestive heart failure have been shown to benefit from treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as regards total mortality. The most recent addition to our knowledge stems from the GISSI-3 trials in which lisinopril, alone or in combination with nitrates, was shown to reduce mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction.",

In study II, 84 patients were randomised to receive quinapril (5-20 mg twice daily) which was titrated upwards every four weeks as necessary to reduce DBP < or = 90 mmHg (titration period 16 weeks, followed by a 12-week maintenance period). Both cohorts of patients were demographically slightly dissimilar because there were more females and higher baseline DBP in study II versus study I (60% vs 34%, and 115.0 vs 109.1 mmHg, respectively) and more blacks (26% vs. 0%) and heavier patients (90 kg vs. 73 kg) in study I versus study II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "81": "A microdetermination of propranolol enantiomers and of their glucuronide and sulphate conjugates in human plasma and urine by reversed-phase HPLC after chiral derivatization is described. After extraction from 100 microliters of plasma or urine with racemic 4-methylpropranolol as internal standard (I.S.), the enantiomers are derivatized with R(+)-phenylethylisocyanate as chiral derivatization reagent. Chromatography is performed on Novapak C18 column with fluorescence detection. Glucuronide and sulphate conjugates are cleaved prior to extraction by incubating, respectively, the samples with glucuronidase-arylsulphatase and saccharic acid 1-4 lactone as specific glucuronidase inhibitor. The retention times of propranolol and I.S. enantiomer derivatives are short (tR = 5.5-6.2 min and 8.8-10.1 min, respectively). The diastereomeric derivatives are very stable and show good peak symmetry and resolutions (RS = 2 and 2.2). The use of 4-methylpropranolol as I.S. improves significantly relative standard deviations (RSD: 1.7-5.1). Sensitivity is about 1 ng ml-1 per enantiomer. The method is applied to pharmacokinetic studies of racemic propranolol in human plasma and urine.

    "82": "The capacity of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system to modify the acutely autotransplanted heart was investigated in eight anesthetized open-chest canine preparations in which the adrenal glands had been removed from the circulation. Cardiac effects elicited by isoproterenol and nicotine were also examined before and after heart-lung transplantation. Cardiac augmentation induced by isoproterenol was similar before and immediately after cardiopulmonary transplantation, indicating that the surgery did not obtund cardiac myocyte function significantly. The initial bradycardia induced by nicotine was greater before transplantation. The subsequent augmentation in left atrial systolic pressure, as well as right and left ventricular intramyocardial systolic pressures, induced by nicotine were similar before and after transplantation. When nicotine was administered to transplanted preparations after atropine administration, cardiac augmentation was induced. Cardiac augmentation was not induced by nicotine after subsequent beta-adrenergic blockade. These data indicate that nicotine-sensitive adrenergic neurons which accompany the transplanted heart are capable of inducing considerable cardiac augmentation. Power spectral analysis of heart rate and left ventricular chamber rate of pressure rise variability indicated an almost complete lack of power in these indexes after, as opposed to before, transplantation. Together with intrinsic cardiac cholinergic neurons, intrinsic cardiac adrenergic neurons may be responsible for physiologically and pharmacologically induced alterations in cardiac variables that occur in acutely transplanted hearts.", 
    "83": "A patch-clamp study of Ca2+ currents and spectrofluorometric detection of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]i was performed on porcine myometrial cells that had been isolated by collagenase. Isolated myometrial cells were the typical long cylinder shape. The main length and diameter of myometrial cells were 505 +/- 20 and 11 +/- 0.5 microns (n = 40), respectively, in the prepartum period and 265 +/- 22 and 7 +/- 0.4 microns (n = 40), respectively, in the luteal phase. Immunocytochemistry with an antibody against desmin stained 90% of the cells positively, and about 95% of the cells excluded Trypan blue dye.

In prepartum myometrial cells, oxytocin (10(-7) mol l-1) and carbachol (10(-4) mol l-1) increased [Ca2+]i in a biphasic pattern, with a sharp peak followed by a plateau. In cells in the luteal phase, adrenaline (10(-7) mol l-1) plus propranolol (10(-6) mol l-1) produced a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i. However, in the absence of propranolol, the increase in [Ca2+]i by adrenaline was small. Prostaglandin F2 alpha (10(-6) mol l-1) induced a monophasic increase in the [Ca2+]i in cells in the luteal phase.

    "84": "The underlying treatment of atrial fibrillation comprises two possible options. In the best of cases, sinus rhythm obtained by cardioversion must be maintained by appropriate therapy. This solution is the best option for preventing the risks of embolism or of myocardial deterioration. In refractory cases, the remaining option is to control the ventricular response. The principle is to maintain the rhythm within acceptable limits (70 to 90/min at rest), an action which also aims to limit the response to effort. This results in a symptomatic improvement and protects myocardial function. Digitalis is the commonest drug used for controlling the ventricular response. It is usually successful at recommended therapeutic doses, but often fails to control the response to effort. Adjustment of dosage using plasma concentrations may improve the situation. Another method of improving the control of the ventricular response is to associate digitalis with beta-blockers or calcium inhibitors. The risk of this option is the induction of an excessive bradycardia but, on the other hand, the response to exercise can be reduced and the variations of ventricular response decreased over a 24 hour period. In forms resistant to pharmacological treatment, it is possible to intervene directly on the atrioventricular conduction pathways. Radio frequency current is used in this indication. Sometimes, the objective is only to alter atrioventricular conduction to reduce the ventricular response to atrial fibrillation. In fact, this is often difficult to obtain and a number of cases develops complete atrioventricular block. In general, the aim is to create complete atrioventricular block which is then associated with implantation of a pacemaker.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "85": "The effect of blood flow rates on hepatic elimination of metoprolol (Met) was studied in a recirculating isolated perfused rat liver system with a constant infusion of Met into the reservoir.

    "86": "The pharmacological properties of YM-15430-1 and its stereoisomers (YM-15430-2, YM-15430-3 and YM-15430-4) were evaluated in in vitro experiments. In the rabbit isolated aorta, all compounds antagonized the CaCl2-induced contraction with a negative logarithm of the dissociation constant in calcium antagonism of 8.51, 7.13, 8.68 and 7.16, respectively. In the rat isolated right atrium, YM-15430-1 produced a competitive antagonism of the isoprenaline-induced tachycardia with a pA2 value of 7.59. YM-15430-2, YM-15430-3 and YM-15430-4 also antagonized the isoprenaline-induced tachycardia, with pA2 values of 7.91, 7.09 and 6.24, respectively. Because it was the most active of the 4 stereoisomers, YM-15430-1 was particularly studied. YM-15430-1 showed an about 100-fold greater selectivity for beta 1- than for beta 2-adrenoceptors, and had no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. These results suggest that YM-15430-1 is a hybrid compound which combines calcium entry-blocking and selective beta 1-adrenoceptor-blocking activities in one molecule.", 
    "87": "The inhibitory effect of beraprost on the transmembrane action potentials was compared with other cardioprotective drugs during hypoxia in guinea-pig isolated right ventricular muscle. Glibenclamide, like beraprost, inhibited the decrease of the action potential duration, but propanolol and diltiazem did not affect this decrease during hypoxia. In beraprost-treated preparations, the decrease of the myocardial K+ content during hypoxia was inhibited. Furthermore, beraprost prevented the action potential shortening during metabolic inhibition by 2,4-dinitrophenol. It is suggested that beraprost may inhibit the hypoxia- and 2,4-dinitrophenol-induced shortening of the action potential duration by preserving the muscular ATP level. Accordingly, beraprost may have beneficial effects both during hypoxia and metabolic inhibition.", 
    "88": "The effects of maninile and obsidan and their combined action on metabolic processes were studied in a series of in vitro experiments. The metabolic processes serve as a prerequisite to energy supply and couple the anabolic and catabolic pathways of hepatic metabolism. The rate of aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of glucose was shown to decrease when maninile was in close contact with liver tissue. It is indicative of the indirect hypoglycemic action of maninile. There is evidence for the combined use of maninile and obsidan since it allows the balance of regulatory metabolites to be maintained. Also, metabolic changes became less if they were used in combination rather alone.", 
    "89": "The effect of betaadrenoceptor blocking drugs atenolol and propranolol was studied in both nonstimulated and stimulated isolated rat mast cells. Atenolol did not liberate histamine from non-stimulated mast cells, decreased spontaneous secretion, inhibited 48/80 stimulated histamine release, increased 32P incorporation into membrane phospholipids, decreased membrane fluidisation and decreased arachidonic acid liberation from membrane phospholipids of stimulated mast cells. Propranolol dose-dependently liberated histamine from nonstimulated mast cells and inhibited histamine liberation, it nonsignificantly increased membrane phospholipid turnover but significantly increased membrane fluidisation and inhibited stimulated arachidonic acid liberation in stimulated mast cells. The results indicated the interaction of atenolol and propranolol with mast cell membranes, particularly with the phospholipid bilayer, resulting in a possible inhibition of phospholipase A2 activation. Histamine liberation suggested its displacement from granule binding sites after intracellular propranolol accumulation in mast cells.", 
    "90": "1. The roles of the tissue kallikrein-kinin system and nitric oxide (NO) release in Phoneutria nigriventer venom-induced relaxations of rabbit corpus cavernosum (RbCC) smooth muscle have been investigated by use of a bioassay cascade. 2. Phoneutria nigriventer venom (10-30 micrograms), porcine pancreatic kallikrein (100 mu), rabbit urinary kallikrein (10 mu), bradykinin (BK, 0.3-3 nmol), acetylcholine (ACh, 0.3-30 nmol) and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN, 0.5-10 nmol) caused relaxations of the RbCC strips. Captopril (1 microM) substantially potentiated Phoneutria nigriventer venom- and BK-induced RbCC relaxations without affecting those elicited by GTN. 3. The bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, Hoe 140 (D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D- Tic7,Oic8]-BK, 50 nM), aprotinin (10 micrograms ml-1) and the tissue kallikrein inhibitor, Pro-Phe-Aph-Ser-Val- Gln-NH2 (KIZD-06, 1.3 microM) significantly inhibited Phoneutria nigriventer venom-induced RbCC relaxations, without affecting those provoked by GTN and ACh. The B1 receptor antagonist, [Leu9]des Arg10BK (0.5 microM) and soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI, 10 micrograms ml-1) had no effect on Phoneutria nigriventer venom-induced RbCC relaxations. 4. The relaxations induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom, porcine pancreas kallikrein, BK and ACh were significantly inhibited by N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10 microM) but not by D-NAME (10 microM). L-NAME did not affect GTN-induced relaxations. L-Arginine (300 microM), but not D-arginine (300 microM), significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of L-NAME. 5. Our results indicate that Phoneutria nigriventer venom activates the tissue kallikrein-kininogen-kinin system in RbCC strips leading to NO release and suggest a functional role for this system in penile erection.", 
    "91": "1. The effect of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, 7-nitro indazole (7-NI), on sympathetic and purinergic neurotransmission in the rat isolated vas deferens preparation has been studied. 2. 7-NI (50-200 microM) caused a dose- and frequency-dependent inhibition of the phasic (predominantly purinergic) contractile response of the rat vas deferens to electrical (field) stimulation (100 V, 0.5 ms). Greatest inhibition occurred at lower frequencies of stimulation (0.1-10 Hz). The sustained tonic contractile response (predominantly noradrenergic) was inhibited only at a high frequency of stimulation (60 Hz) and only at the highest concentration of 7-NI studies (200 microM). 3. 7-NI (100 microM) significantly reduced the contractile response of the vas deferens to exogenous ATP (20 microM-5 mM) and the stable P2X purinoceptor agonist, alpha, beta-methylene ATP (2.5 and 25.0 microM) but was without effect on contractions due to noradrenaline (0.1-50 microM) indicating a lack of antagonist effect on post-junctional alpha 1 adrenoceptors. 4. The effect of 7-NI (100 microM) on the phasic contractile response to field stimulation (0.1 and 2.0 Hz) was unaffected by preincubation of preparations with yohimbine (1.0 microM) or propranolol (0.01-10.0 microM) indicating the absence of involvement of alpha 2- or beta-adrenoceptors in this response. 5. 7-NI (50-600 microM) caused dose-related inhibition of contractions elicited by addition of a depolarizing concentration of KCl (64 mM). 6. The effect of 7-NI (100 microM) on the phasic contractile response to field stimulation (0.1 and 2.0 Hz) was unaffected by preincubation of preparations with L-arginine (1 mM). Neither L-arginine (1 mM) nor NC nitro L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 LM) affected the response of the vas deferens to field stimulation at 0.1 or 2.0 Hz. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzyme activity, measured as the conversion of[3H]-L-arginine to [3H]-citrulline, was not detectable in rat vas deferens homogenates.7. 7-Nr preferentially inhibits the purinergic component of the response of the rat vas deferens to field stimulation. The mechanism of action of 7-NI is not known but is not related to NOS inhibition. It seems likely that 7-NI combines an antagonist action at smooth muscle cell P2X-purinoceptors with the ability to inhibit the cellular influx of calcium ions. Although these hitherto unrecorded effects of 7-NI occur at relatively high concentrations, the effects described may contribute to the pharmacological effects of this NOS inhibitor.", 
    "92": "Small pieces of atrial tissue removed from the cannulation site before cardioplegia were used to develop a method for studying adrenergic regulation of the myocardial contractile force in children operated on for congenital heart defects (CHD). We measured the development of the isometric force of contraction dT/dtmax (T'max). Reduction in basal contractility induced by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist timolol indicated that the myocardium was about half-maximally stimulated by endogenous norepinephrine (NE), probably released from nerve endings by the electrical stimulation. The inotropic effect of endogenous NE could be further increased by tyramine (EC50 approximately 5 microM). A maximal concentration of tyramine increased T'max by a median of 62.5% above the basal level. Sequential blockade of the beta- and alpha 1-adrenoceptors after tyramine stimulation by timolol and prazosin, respectively, indicated that a near-maximal response to combined adrenoceptor stimulation by endogenous NE was mediated by both beta-adrenoceptors (median 77%) and alpha 1-adrenoceptors (median 23%). The basal level of endogenous NE may conceal inotropic effects by exogenous alpha-agonists added to this type of preparation. This preparation is suitable for studying adrenergic regulation by reversing the effects of endogenous NE.", 
    "93": "Lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) is an organochlorine pesticide that increases intracellular free calcium ([Ca++]i) in several tissues. Calcium homeostasis is central to the excitation and relaxation of uterine muscle during labor. The present study, therefore, investigated whether lindane exposure modulated [Ca++]i in myometrial smooth muscle cells. This study demonstrated that lindane, but not beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, increased [Ca++]i in a concentration-dependent manner in individual rat myometrial cells, as measured with the calcium-sensitive probe fura-2-AM. The lindane-induced Ca++ response was rapid in onset and protracted in duration. The lindane response was apparently independent of external calcium because equivalent [Ca++]i responses were observed in cells exposed to lindane in Ca(++)-containing and Ca(++)-free media and in the presence of 10 microM nifedipine, a dihydropyridine blocker of plasma membrane voltage-sensitive Ca++ channels. Prior depletion of internal Ca++ stores that contained Ca(++)-induced Ca(++)-release channels by 10 mM caffeine and 1 microM ryanodine did not affect lindane's ability to increase [Ca++]i, whereas pretreatment with either 1 microM ionomycin or 5 microM carbachol eliminated the lindane-induced [Ca++]i increase. These experiments suggest that lindane increases [Ca++]i through the selective release of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca++ stores. In addition, in Ca(++)-containing buffer, low concentrations of lindane (1 microM) rapidly inhibited the regenerative calcium oscillations induced by carbachol. If the mechanism is similar in vivo, lindane exposure may perturb many finely regulated Ca(++)-dependent processes required for excitation-contraction coupling in successful parturition and, therefore, increase the probability of delayed or dysfunctional labor.", 
    "94": "Recent experiments in this laboratory have investigated the distribution of the nuclear protein Fos in the rat brain after unilateral electrical stimulation of the aortic depressor nerve and have revealed intense ipsilateral straining in the islands of Calleja. To test the hypothesis that the islands of Calleja may have a role in cardiovascular control, we tested the effect on arterial pressure and heart rate of microinjection of L-glutamate into the islands of Calleja of the artificially ventilated, urethane anesthetized rat. Microinjection of glutamate into the islands of Calleja resulted in a decrease in arterial pressure (24.5 +/- 1.5 mmHg) and heart rate (16.6 +/- 1.6 bpm). These responses were eliminated by i.v. injection of propranolol or by transection of the spinal cord at the C1 level. These results are the first demonstration that the islands of Calleja are involved in mediating cardiovascular reflexes primarily through an influence on sympathetic outflow to the heart and vessels. To determine the effects of increases or decreases of arterial pressure on single unit activity in the islands of Calleja, responses of single units in the islands to i.v. injection of phenylephrine or sodium nitroprusside were recorded. Of 87 units recorded from in the islands of Calleja, 40 (46%) responded to phenylephrine and 27 (68%) decreased their firing frequency. Of these 27, 16 (59.3%) increased their firing frequency to administration of nitroprusside. In addition, in 11 (31%) of 35 units recorded from in the islands, glutamate microinjection in the nucleus tractus solitarius decreased the firing frequency in 9 (82%) units.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "95": "The molecular interfaces between Gs and the beta-adrenergic receptor were investigated using synthetic peptides corresponding to various regions of its alpha subunit, alpha s. These experiments were carried out on saponin-permeable C6 glioma cells in which the beta-adrenergic receptor appears tightly coupled to Gs. Synthetic site-specific peptides from alpha s (corresponding to amino acids 15-29, 354-372, and 384-394) and alpha i (8-22, 315-324, and 345-455) were tested for their ability to interfere with coupling between the beta-adrenergic receptor and Gs. The two carboxyl-terminal peptides from alpha s blocked beta-adrenergic stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in permeable cells. However, only alpha s-354-372 had this effect in C6 membranes. It is suggested that the partial uncoupling of Gs, which occurs subsequent to cell disruption, may be related to a change in the interaction of the alpha s carboxyl terminus with the beta-adrenoreceptor. Two carboxyl-terminal peptides, 354-372 and 384-394, could also mimic the effect of Gs to increase agonist affinity for the beta-adrenergic receptor. In combination, alpha s-354-372 and alpha s-384-394 increased the ability of isoproterenol to compete with 125I-pindolol binding in a partially additive manner. Synthetic peptides from alpha i and amino-terminal peptides from alpha s had no effect on beta-agonist binding, suggesting a high specificity of peptide effects. Two findings suggest that these peptides bind directly to the beta-adrenergic receptor and stabilize its high agonist affinity conformation. First, GTP and hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogs did not alter the high affinity binding in the presence of high concentrations of the peptides. Second, in S49 lymphoma cyc- cells, which lack Gs, these peptides evoked the high affinity agonist binding state of the beta-receptor. Neither peptide had an effect on antagonist binding affinity, as measured by propranolol displacement of 125I-pindolol. These data suggest that at least two regions on the alpha subunit of Gs participate in high affinity Gs binding to the beta-adrenergic receptor. The fact that these small peptides could mimic the holo-Gs effect on the receptor is rather surprising, and the specificity of the effect suggests that the primary and secondary structure of small regions of alpha s contain much of the information for specific interaction with beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "96": "Several possible mechanisms for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-induced tachycardia in rat have been suggested: an activation of 5-HT1C or 5-HT2 receptors, an indirect sympathomimetic effect or a mechanism independent of 5-HT2 receptor stimulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of these mechanisms in the 5-HT-induced increase in rat atrial rate using biochemical methods. Indeed, the 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 receptors are linked to phosphoinositide hydrolysis and the noradrenaline (NA) released by 5-HT can stimulate the beta 1-adrenergic receptors linked to adenylate cyclase stimulation. The effect of varying concentrations of 5-HT on inositol phospholipid hydrolysis and adenylate cyclase activity of the rat isolated atria were measured. 5-HT (2 microM) did not modify total inositol phosphate (IP) production, while 5-HT 10 and 50 microM increased it 2-fold. The 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin (1 microM) abolished IP accumulation induced by 5-HT microM), which indicates that this accumulation is 5-HT2 and not 5-HT1C receptor-mediated. Moreover, cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation was enhanced by 5-HT (5, 10, 20 and 50 microM). When atria were incubated 10 min with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist nadolol (1 microM), the increase in the cAMP level induced by 5-HT, whatever its concentration (10, 20 or 50 microM), was inhibited. Treating rats with reserpine (2.5 mg/kg, i.p., 48 and 24 hr before experimentation), which caused NA depletion in the heart, seemed to reduce the stimulating effect of 5-HT 10 and 50 microM on adenylate cyclase activity. Thus, the 5-HT-induced increase in cAMP is indirectly due to the activation of the beta-adrenergic receptors by the NA released by 5-HT. It is concluded that 5-HT stimulates both phosphoinositide turnover and adenylate cyclase activity in the rat isolated atria by activation of 5-HT2 receptors and by an indirect sympathomimetic effect.", 
    "97": "The existence of G protein-dependent and -independent mechanisms activated by sodium fluoride was examined in muscle cells isolated separately from the circular and longitudinal layers of guinea pig intestine. The cells were transiently permeabilized by incubation with Trans. Port Reagent in the presence or absence of GDP beta S (100 microM) and then re-sealed. In the absence of GDP beta S, NaF (1 mM) induced contraction and caused an increase in [Ca2+]i, IP3 and diacylglycerol levels and in protein kinase C (PKC) activity in both cell types. In the presence of GDP beta S, the increases in IP3, DAG and PKC were abolished whereas contraction and the increase in [Ca2+]i were partly inhibited. Residual contraction and [Ca2+]i were abolished by the Ca2+ channel blocker, methoxyverapamil. We conclude that contraction and Ca2+ mobilization induced by NaF is mediated by G protein activation as well as by a G protein-independent mechanism involving activation of plasmalemmal Ca2+ channels.", 
    "98": "This report describes the use of programmed atrial stimulation via the esophagus to predict the clinical efficacy of various management strategies for supraventricular arrhythmias in infants and children. A total of 203 transesophageal electrophysiologic studies were performed in 132 patients. Therapies evaluated included medications from each antiarrhythmic class, the Valsalva maneuver, follow-up of radiofrequency ablation, and no therapy. The transesophageal technique appeared to be adequate for inducing tachycardia, yielding a low false-negative rate. Overall, the predictive value of a negative study was high (89%), and increased to 96% when stimulation was performed in the presence of isoproterenol. However, the positive predictive value was significantly lower both with (72%, p < 0.00001) and without (60%, p < 0.0001) isoproterenol. These results were due in part to a very low positive predictive value when evaluating either digoxin and/or beta-blocker therapy, 62% vs 82% for the remaining studies. When clinical tachycardia cannot be induced with therapy, transesophageal techniques can be used to predict freedom from many supraventricular tachycardias for most therapies in children. However, induction of tachycardia may not predict treatment failure. Transesophageal pacing to evaluate arrhythmia therapy may be most useful when managing either severe symptoms, multiple recurrences, or the results of radiofrequency ablation.", 
    "99": "This study analyzed, with spectral techniques, the effects of atenolol or metoprolol on RR interval variability in 20 patients 4 weeks after the first uncomplicated myocardial infarction. Beta blocker-induced bradycardia was associated with a significant increase in the average 24-hour values of RR variance (from 13,886 +/- 1,479 to 16,728 +/- 1,891 ms2) and of the normalized power of the high-frequency component (from 22 +/- 1 to 28 +/- 2 normalized units), whereas the low-frequency component was greatly reduced (from 60 +/- 3 to 50 +/- 3 normalized units). When considering day and nighttime separately, the effects of both drugs were more pronounced in the daytime. In addition, a marked attenuation was observed in the circadian variation of the low-frequency component after beta blockade. As a result, the early morning increase of the spectral index of sympathetic modulation was no longer detectable. These results indicate that beta-blocker administration has important effects on RR interval variability and on its spectral components. The observed reduction in signs of sympathetic activation and the increase in vagal tone after beta blockade help to explain the beneficial effects of these drugs after myocardial infarction. However, the potential clinical relevance of the increase in RR variance remains to be established.", 
    "100": "3,3',5-Triiodothyronine (T3), at 10(-8) M, potentiated by 26.4-30.9% the isoproterenol-mediated inotropic effect in chick embryo cardiac myocytes in culture. Amiodarone (10(-6) M) decreased this response by 44.6% only in cells cultured with serum, where the T3 concentration was 10(-13) M. Amiodarone inhibited the potentiating effect of T3. Amiodarone alone had no influence on the beta-adrenoceptor density in cells cultured in serum-free medium. This confirms that the effects of amiodarone on cardiac beta-adrenoceptors are T3 dependent. T3 increased the density of beta-adrenoceptors through two concentration ranges, with an initial 30% increase between 10(-14) and 10(-11) M, followed by a second increase until 10(-7) M. Amiodarone not only inhibited the first positive effect of T3 but also decreased beta-adrenoceptor density far below the control value. The second positive T3 effect was also inhibited by 50% by amiodarone. This study suggests that T3 might increase the number of cell-surface beta-adrenoceptors and modify their cellular traffic through at least two mechanisms, one assumed to be non-genomic, the other being genomic, and that amiodarone could affect the two mechanisms differently.", 
    "101": "The effect of DL-propranolol on the production of nitric oxide (NO.) by cultured arterial smooth muscle cells from normotensive (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was studied before and after stimulation by lipopolysaccharide or interleukin-1 beta. The influence of L-arginine and NG-nitro-L-arginine on these events was also studied. Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated SHR-derived smooth muscle cells produced less NO. than WKY cells. However the amounts produced in response to interleukin-1 beta were similar for the two cell types. DL-propranolol increased the NO. production in both types of cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide, but had no significant effect on this parameter in WKY-derived cells exposed to interleukin-1 beta. Inclusion of L-arginine during incubations with propranolol had no effect on the levels of NO. produced by either cell type exposed to lipopolysaccharide. The basal production of NO. was enhanced in smooth muscle cells from both normotensive and hypertensive rats when the cells were treated with L-arginine after exposure to interleukin-1 beta. L-Arginine increased the response to DL-propranolol only in the WKY cells. NO. production was depressed by inclusion of NG-nitro-L-arginine during incubations in both cell types regardless of the treatment regime used to induce NO. synthase activity. The results suggest that DL-propranolol may induce the production of NO. by cultured smooth muscle cells exposed to cytokines.", 
    "102": "Male Wistar rats were subjected to a chronic mild stress procedure involving different stress stimuli applied for 8 weeks. During this time the consumption of 1% sucrose solution was monitored at weekly intervals. After the first 3 weeks, when stressed animals displayed a reduction of sucrose consumption, the control and stressed groups were divided into subgroups receiving daily placebo or imipramine (10 mg/kg/day) treatment. After 5 weeks of treatment, 24 h after the last injection, the rats were killed and beta-adrenoceptor density and affinity in cortical membrane preparations and the accumulation of cyclic AMP in cortical slices stimulated with noradrenaline were assessed. While in stressed placebo-treated rats the sucrose consumption remained reduced, in the imipramine-treated group the level of consumption gradually returned to control values. The stressed placebo-treated rats also displayed an increase in cortical beta-adrenoceptor density (by 34%) with no changes in affinity, and an increase (22%) in the cyclic AMP response to noradrenaline in cortical slices. Imipramine, which in non-stressed rats did not affect sucrose intake but depressed the beta-adrenoceptor density and the cyclic AMP response, reversed the stress-induced decrease in sucrose consumption and the increase in the beta-adrenoceptor density; at physiological noradrenaline concentrations it also reduced the enhanced cyclic AMP response. The results suggest that the chronic mild stress procedure produces behavioral and biochemical changes consistent with a realistic model of depression in animals.", 
    "103": "Five patients presented with unusually severe and therapy-resistant rhinitis, sinusitis, and nasal polyps. Long courses of antibiotics did not cure the sinusitis, and recurrences appeared soon after surgical intervention. The patients used non-selective beta blockers for hypertension or as secondary prophylaxis after cardiac infarction, either timolol (n = 4) or propranolol (n = 1), and the nasal problems developed with a latency ranging from a few days up to four years of beta blocker use. Two of the patients discontinued the beta blocker for reasons relating to cardiovascular status and experienced complete remission of the nasal problems without further treatment. In the three remaining patients the therapy was withdrawn. The symptoms cleared within weeks, and did not recur. The patients who needed beta blockade experienced no recurrence when put on beta-1-selective blocker (metoprolol or atenolol).", 
    "104": "We describe the synthesis of bordifluoropyrromethene (BODIPY), fluorescein, and related fluorescent derivatives of the beta-adrenergic ligand CGP 12177. With these probes we screened insect (Sf9) cells stably transformed with the human beta 2-adrenoceptor gene and expressing (2-3.5) x 10(5) human beta 2-adrenoceptors per cell. Among these derivatives only BODIPY-CGP gave a receptor-specific signal sufficiently strong for measuring the on- and off-rate constants and the equilibrium dissociation constant of beta-adrenoceptor-specific binding by spectrofluorometry or photon counting. Similar KD values for BODIPY-CGP binding were obtained by kinetic measurements (approx. 250 pM) and under equilibrium conditions (400 +/- 180 pM), and these were in the same range as those obtained with [3H]CGP 12177 (200 +/- 32 pM). The cell-bound fluorescence could be quenched specifically with nonfluorescent CGP 12177 to near background levels. The disposition of the beta 2-adrenoceptors in BODIPY-CGP-stained Sf9 cells was mainly restricted to the cell surface at 4 and 30 degrees C. Hence, beta-adrenoceptor-expressing cells can be stained specifically with BODIPY-CGP, and beta-adrenoceptors on a single cell can be assessed by photon counting under the fluorescence microscope. Cells can also be scanned by fluorescence-activated flow cytometry.", 
    "105": "The selectins, a family of adhesion receptors involved in leukocyte extravasation, recognize sialyl Lewis X (sLe(x); NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc) and related oligosaccharides. We used conformational energy computations, high field NMR, and structure-function studies to define distance parameters of critical functional groups of sLe(x). This sLe(x) pharmacophore was used to search a three-dimensional data base of chemical structures. Compounds that had a similar spatial relationship of functional groups were tested as inhibitors of selectin binding. Glycyrrhizin, a triterpene glycoside, was identified and found to block selectin binding to sLe(x) in vitro. We substituted different sugars for the glucuronic acids of glycyrrhizin and found the L-fucose derivative to be the most active in vitro and in vivo. A C-fucoside derivative, synthesized on a linker designed for stability and to more closely approximate the original sLe(x) pharmacophore, resulted in an easily synthesized, effective selectin blocker with anti-inflammatory activity.", 
    "106": "The aim of this study was to characterize the receptor(s) for bombesin (BN) and its homologues (gastrin releasing peptide, GRP; neuromedin B, NMB; neuromedin C, NMC) in guinea pig gallbladder muscle strips. Dose-dependent contractions were induced by all peptides tested (potency: BN = GRP > NMC > NMB, but with similar efficacy: BN = GRP = NMC = NMB). The contractions were resistant to tetrodotoxin, atropine, phentolamine, and propranolol. BN tachyphylaxis (1 microM) abolished subsequent contractile responses to BN, GRP and NMC; and partially antagonized the response to NMB (66 +/- 7% inhibition). NMB tachyphylaxis (10 microM) markedly inhibited subsequent contractile responses to NMB (78 +/- 5%); and partially antagonized the contractile response to BN (36 +/- 4%), GRP (31 +/- 12%) and NMC (22 +/- 2%). At 1 microM, both [D-Phe6, Des-Met14]-BN(6-14) ethylamide and ICI 216, 140, two BN receptor antagonists, reduced the contractile actions of BN (82 +/- 4% and 59 +/-8% inhibition, respectively), GRP (75 +/- 11% and 45 +/- 5%), and NMC (73 +/- 9% and 51 +/- 6%) while having no marked effect on NMB contractions. Our pharmacological approaches (receptor tachyphylaxis and differential antagonism) provide support for two types of receptors for BN-like peptides on guinea pig gallbladder smooth muscle: a GRP-preferring receptor and a NMB-preferring receptor.", 
    "107": "beta-adrenoceptors, Gs alpha- and Gi alpha-proteins were investigated in a crude plasma membrane preparation from ventricles of young (2-4 months) and senescent (22-24 months) Wistar rats. Receptor density, ligand affinity and beta 1/beta 2-receptor ratio were independent of the age of the rats. The percentage of beta-receptors coupled to G-proteins increased with age. An age-related increase in the level of Gs alpha (124%) was paralleled by an increase in the ratio between the high and low molecular weight form of Gs alpha. The level of Gi alpha-protein almost doubled (170%) upon aging. We conclude that the age-related differences are small at the level of the beta-adrenoceptor molecule, but that the increase in Gi alpha-proteins could be responsible for the age-related reduction in myocardial inotropic and chronotropic responses. Moreover, we suggest that the changes in degree of high affinity coupling between beta-receptor and Gs-protein are possibly linked to alterations in the ratio between the Gs-molecular weight subtypes.", 
    "108": "To quantitatively analyze the effects of serum stimulation and contractile activity and their interaction on cellular growth and cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene expression, spontaneously contracting neonatal rat ventricular myocytes in primary culture were maintained in serum-free growth medium or growth medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum. Contractile activity in paired cultures was inhibited by addition of the calcium channel blocker verapamil (10 microM) to the culture medium. Both serum stimulation and contractile activity produced myocyte hypertrophy as assessed by increases in total protein, total RNA, protein-to-DNA ratios, and total MHC protein content. MHC isoenzyme analysis indicated that both MHC-alpha and MHC-beta proteins accumulated in response to serum stimulation and/or contractile activity. The increases in MHC-beta protein resulting from serum stimulation and contractile activity occurred in parallel with increases in MHC-beta mRNA. In contrast, MHC-alpha mRNA levels were relatively unaffected by serum stimulation but appeared to decrease in response to contractile activity. The protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (5 nM) reduced MHC-beta expression in serum-free, contracting cultures and also prevented the serum-induced increase in MHC-beta mRNA observed in both contracting and arrested myocytes. Staurosporine also increased MHC-alpha mRNA levels in serum-free, contracting, and verapamil-arrested myocytes. These data suggest that both humoral and mechanical factors regulate MHC isoenzyme expression and cellular growth in neonatal ventricular myocytes.", 
    "109": "Epibatidine, a newly discovered alkaloid from the skin of Dendrobatidae frogs, has structural similarities to nicotine. We examined the effects of epibatidine on cardiorespiratory function and ganglionic synaptic transmission. Superior cervical or splanchnic sympathetic nerve discharge (sSND) and phrenic nerve discharge (PND) were recorded along with arterial pressure (AP) in urethane-anesthetized, paralyzed and artificially ventilated rats. Epibatidine administered i.v. at low doses (0.5-2 micrograms/kg) produced a transient increase in AP and sSND, followed by a decrease and return to baseline; this low dose of epibatidine also produced a dose-dependent increase in PND. At high doses (cumulative dose of 8-16 micrograms/kg), epibatidine produced bradycardia, a profound depression in sSND and a transient elimination of PND. After i.v. administration of the ganglionic blocker chlorisondamine (5 mg/kg), AP was still increased by 1 microgram/kg epibatidine (+39 +/- 11 mm Hg). This pressor effect was not altered by pretreatment with the alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist phentolamine (+40 +/- 10 mm Hg); however, it was blocked by additional pretreatment with the vasopressin antagonist [beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylenepropiony1, O-ET-Tyr2,Val4,Arg8]vasopressin (50 micrograms/kg i.v.; +2 +/- 0.4 mm Hg). Low doses of epibatidine (0.5-2 micrograms/kg) produced firing of postganglionic neurons in a decentralized ganglion preparation and potentiated synaptic transmission; at high doses (cumulative dose of 8-16 micrograms/kg), the alkaloid blocked ganglionic synaptic transmission. These results suggest that epibatidine is a potent agonist of ganglionic nicotinic receptors and that the alkaloid elicits cardiorespiratory effects similar to those of nicotine.", 
    "110": "The objective of the present work has been to analyze the influence of endothelium, ageing and hypertension in the norepinephrine (NE)-induced responses. For this purpose we used aortic rings from spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats of different ages. In rings with endothelium from 5-week-old WKY, cumulative addition of NE (0.01 and 0.1 microM) caused concentration-dependent contractions, whereas higher concentrations (1 and 10 microM) induced concentration-dependent relaxations. In 5-week-old SHR and 3-month-old WKY rats, these relaxant responses were observed only at 10 microM NE, and they disappeared in older animals from both strains. In endothelium denuded rings, NE induced only contractions, which were similar in WKY rats of different ages, but significantly increased in 6- and 12-month-old SHR. In both strains, the endothelium-dependent relaxant responses to NE were abolished by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and propranolol, but not modified by yohimbine or ouabain. Isoproterenol (0.01-10 microM) induced concentration-dependent vasodilation in rings from 5-week-old rats of both strains, precontracted with 1 microM NE. Isoproterenol-elicited responses were reduced by endothelium removal or by 0.1 mM NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and abolished by 1 microM propranolol. These results suggest that: 1) in the aorta from young WKY and prehypertensive SHR rats, NE induces vasodilations mediated by activation of endothelial beta adrenoceptors and release of nitric oxide; 2) these responses are impaired during ageing and hypertension; and 3) there is an important negative endothelial modulation of NE-induced contraction in adult SHR rats.", 
    "111": "The present study was designed to determine whether chronic benzodiazepine (BZ) agonist treatment alters the \"set point\" of the BZ pharmacological profile. This was achieved by investigating the modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated [36Cl-] influx by BZ ligands, as well as pentobarbital after chronic flurazepam treatment, in well characterized mammalian cortical neurons. Chronic flurazepam treatment (5 microM, 10 days) produced decreased efficacy of BZ agonists (diazepam and flunitrazepam) and inverse agonists (methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3'-carboxylate and ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate), as measured by GABA-induced [36Cl-] influx. The chronic flurazepam treatment, although not altering their EC50/IC50 values, decreased the Emax/-Emax values. Furthermore, the decreased efficacy was reversed after a 72-hr withdrawal, and by concomitant exposure of the neurons to Ro15-1788 (ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5 alpha][1,4]- BZ-3-carboxylate), a BZ receptor antagonist, but not by R 5135 (3 alpha-hydroxy-16-imino-5 beta-17-androstan-11-one; a GABA receptor antagonist) and pircrotoxin (a channel blocker). The chronic flurazepam treatment also produced uncoupling between pentobarbital and BZ receptor sites, and decreased the efficacy of pentobarbital to enhance GABA-mediated [36Cl-] influx, events also reversed at 72-hr withdrawal and concomitant exposure to Ro15-1788. Chronic flurazepam treatment-induced uncoupling and decreased efficacy of BZ agonists was not reversed by the GABAA receptor antagonist, R 5135, or channel blocker, picrotoxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

After ascertaining that the separate and cocktail phenotyping tests of the probe drugs correlated with each other (all rs values > 0.84; p < 0.001), the cocktail phenotyping assessment was extended to the other 74 Indonesians. In a total of 104 Indonesians phenotyped with the cocktail test, a visual antimode was apparent only in the dapsone N-acetylation and S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation polymorphisms: the frequencies of slow acetylators and poor hydroxylators were 43.3% (95% confidence interval, 33.7% to 52.8%) and 15.4% (95% confidence interval, 8.5% to 22.3%), respectively. The distribution histogram and probit plots of the metabolic ratio of metoprolol gave no clear evidence for bimodality, and therefore no poor alpha-hydroxylator of metoprolol was considered to exist in the present sample size. The findings indicate that the Indonesian subjects have a greater incidence of slow acetylator phenotype compared with Japanese and Chinese, as well as a frequency of poor metabolizer phenotype of S-mephenytoin similar to that of Korean and Chinese subjects. They resemble an African population (Nigerians) in metoprolol alpha-hydroxylation polymorphism, with no apparent antimode derived from white populations.",

The pharmacokinetics of a single 80 mg oral dose of propranolol and the plasma levels of the sex steroid hormones were therefore determined in normal volunteers. In 33 young men there was a positive correlation between the testosterone levels and the propranolol clearances through both alpha-naphthoxylactic acid (p < 0.001) and propranolol glucuronide (p < 0.002), as well as the total clearance (p < 0.05), but not through aromatic ring hydroxylation. Testosterone cypionate administration led to an increased clearance of propranolol through alpha-naphthoxylactic acid in nine of the 11 men studied, further supporting a stimulatory effect of testosterone on propranolol metabolism. In 23 young women there was no significant association between the circulating levels of either estradiol or testosterone and any of the clearances of propranolol. These observations may be clinically relevant for propranolol therapy and may provide improved insight into the influence of gender and circulating gonadal hormones on drug metabolism in humans.",

    "122": "Although the mechanisms responsible for alveolar liquid clearance have been studied in several species, there has not been any information regarding the effect of ion transport agonists or antagonists on alveolar liquid clearance in the human lung. Therefore, we studied alveolar liquid clearance in the recently resected human lung from patients who underwent surgery for lung cancer. A test solution of 40 ml of isosmolar albumin solution was instilled into one segment of a resected lobe within 10 min of resection. Because protein leaves the air spaces very slowly, the concentration of alveolar protein over 4 h was used to quantify alveolar liquid clearance. Basal alveolar liquid clearance was 12 +/- 2% over 4 h. Amiloride (10(-5) M), an inhibitor of apical Na+ uptake, and ouabain (10(-3) M), an inhibitor of Na,K-ATPase activity, reduced alveolar liquid clearance by 40 and 49%, respectively (p < 0.005). Terbutaline (10(-3) or 10(-4) M) doubled alveolar liquid clearance to 28 +/- 9% over 4 h (p < 0.05). Propranolol (10(-4) M) and amiloride (10(-5) M) inhibited the terbutaline-induced increase in alveolar liquid clearance. In conclusion, (1) alveolar liquid clearance in the human lung can be markedly reduced by inhibition of apical sodium channel uptake or Na,K-ATPase activity, and (2) beta-adrenergic stimulation markedly increases the rate of alveolar liquid clearance in the resected human lung without pulmonary perfusion.",

The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that endotoxemia impairs the beta-adrenoceptor- and adenosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate-mediated relaxation in the porcine coronary microcirculation.", 
    "124": "Coronary arterioles (80 to 170 microns internal diameter) were isolated from pigs 3 hours after intravenous administration of E. coli endotoxin (150 micrograms/kg, over 1 hour, n = 8) or Ringer's lactate (control, n = 8). Arterioles were studied in vitro in a pressurized, partially contracted, no-flow state by videomicroscopy.", 
    "125": "Precontracted (30% to 50% of baseline diameter with acetylcholine) control coronary arterioles dilated in response to either the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol, the Gs-protein activator, sodium fluoride, or the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin. After 3 hours of endotoxemia, the relaxation responses to isoproterenol and sodium fluoride were significantly reduced, but the relaxation response to forskolin was preserved. The beta 2-adrenoceptor blocker, ICI-118, 551, markedly reduced the relaxation of control microvessels induced by isoproterenol, whereas the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker, atenolol, caused only a slight reduction in isoproterenol-induced relaxation.", 
    "126": "beta 2-Adrenoceptors appear to predominate over beta 1-adrenoceptors in the coronary microcirculation. E. coli endotoxemia impairs beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation in the porcine coronary microcirculation, apparently because of changes proximal to adenylate cyclase in the signal transduction pathway.", 
    "127": "Heart rate (HR) variability is a marker of tonic cardiac autonomic activity and contributes in assessing risk for sudden death after myocardial infarction. Recent clinical observations have indicated that attenuation of HR variability, which occurs after myocardial infarction, may be transient. This study addresses the issue of whether autonomic control of heart rate recovers at different rates after myocardial infarction in subjects at high and low risk for ventricular fibrillation (VF).", 
    "128": "Thirty dogs, 22 with myocardial infarction and 8 sham-prepared animals, completed the study. Changes and recovery in cardiac autonomic activity after myocardial infarction were examined by measuring HR variability before and at defined intervals during the first 30 days after infarction. Each HR variability measurement was made before and after beta-blockade in dogs at high (n = 10) and low (n = 12) risk for VF. Arrhythmia risk was determined on the basis of development of VF during exercise and transient myocardial ischemia 30 days after infarction. No sham-prepared animals developed VF. Preinfarction measurements of HR variability were not different between the groups before beta-blockade, but HR variability increased much more in response to beta-blockade in animals destined to be resistant compared with susceptible animals (289 +/- 26 to 369 +/- 35 msec, delta 27.7%, versus 270 +/- 36 to 283 +/- 34 milliseconds, delta 4.8%, respectively, P < .01). Immediately after infarction, HR variability was significantly attenuated in all dogs, but in the resistant dogs it recovered to pre-myocardial infarction levels within 10 days. After the infarction, beta-blockade did not increase HR variability in either group of animals. Postoperative increases in HR variability from beta-blockade were preserved in the sham group. Susceptible animals were characterized by a persistent attenuation of HR variability throughout the 30 days.", 
    "129": "The depression in HR variability produced by myocardial infarction has a clearly different temporal recovery pattern between low- and high-risk animals. After myocardial infarction, beta-adrenergic blockade does not alter HR variability, thus preserving its predictive value. Before myocardial infarction, however, beta-blockade increases HR variability only in the animals destined to be at low risk for lethal arrhythmias after the infarction. The recovery pattern of HR variability after myocardial infarction may contribute to the early recognition of individuals at high risk for sudden death.", 
    "130": "Vasoconstriction occurs after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) along the dilated vessel. The vasomotor changes, initiated by the mechanical stretch of the stenotic region, are thought to be due to various mechanisms but whether the sympathetic nervous system plays a role in this phenomenon remains unknown.", 
    "131": "Quantitative angiography (ARTREK) was performed in 45 patients undergoing an epicardial vessel PTCA for a stenosis of 76 +/- 1% (1) in basal conditions, (2) after PTCA, and (3) 30 minutes after PTCA (vasoconstriction). In 14 control patients, the same measurements were obtained up to 60 minutes after PTCA. Coronary diameters were measured along the PTCA vessel at the narrowest stenosis level and at a level peripheral to stenosis. In 36 patients two diameters were also measured at a proximal segment and at a distal segment along a nonmanipulated vessel. Thirty minutes after PTCA the dilated segment underwent a -31 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM, ANOVA, P < .05) reduction in diameter when compared with PTCA values, and the segment peripheral to stenosis showed a reduction of -17 +/- 2% (P < .05). In all patients a significant vasoconstriction also was observed along the control vessel (proximal segment, -14 +/- 3%; P < .05 versus basal; and distal segment, -17 +/- 2%). At the time of maximal vasoconstriction (30 minutes after PTCA), the patients (treatment groups) received (1) 18 micrograms/kg IC phentolamine (Phe, n = 7), (2) 14 micrograms/kg IC yohimbine (YO, n = 7), (3) 16 micrograms/kg IC propranolol (Pro) followed by 18 micrograms/kg IC phentolamine (Pro+Phe, n = 7), and (4) 0.2 mg/kg IC bretylium (Bre, n = 10). In 14 patients (control groups) an intracoronary injection of warm saline was given. After drug injections, angiograms were repeated at 5-minute intervals for 20 minutes and ended after a 300-micrograms intracoronary trinitroglycerin injection. At stenosis level, Phe and Bre counteracted vasoconstriction, inducing a dilatation of +19 +/- 3% and +22 +/- 6%, respectively, while Pro+Phe caused a dilatation of +16 +/- 9% above the PTCA values (P < .05 versus PTCA). YO only partially reversed vasoconstriction (from -33 +/- 4% to -12 +/- 4%, P = NS versus PTCA). At peripheral-to-stenosis level, vasoconstriction was abolished by Phe (+26 +/- 7%, P < .05 versus basal), while it was still present after Pro+Phe (-23 +/- 2%) and Bre (-18 +/- 4%). In addition, Phe and Bre dilated the control vessel at the proximal segment (+17 +/- 6% and +8 +/- 4%, respectively, P < .05 versus basal), while YO and Pro+Phe only counteracted vasoconstriction (from -15 +/- 3% to +7.6 +/- 1% and from -16 +/- 3% to +4 +/- 5%, respectively, P = NS versus basal). At the distal segment only Phe produced a vasodilatation of +23 +/- 1%; YO counteracted constriction (from -16 +/- 2% to +9 +/- 6%, P < .05 versus basal), whereas after Pro+Phe and Bre, the vasoconstriction persisted.", 
    "132": "The mechanical stretch and ischemia caused by balloon inflation induced vasoconstriction mediated by alpha-adrenergic receptors (mainly alpha 1), overcoming a beta-mediated dilatation. The use of different antiadrenergic drugs showed that Phe counteracts post-PTCA vasoconstriction, and the simultaneous use of alpha- and beta-receptor blocking agents (Pro+Phe and Bre) reveals the presence of a peripheral, predominant beta-mediated dilatation. The presence of vasoconstriction also along the control vessels not branching from the stretched ramus provides evidence for the existence of neural sympathetic vasoconstrictor reflexes.", 
    "133": "Detection of asymptomatic ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease has been associated with increased risk for adverse outcome, but treatment of patients with asymptomatic ischemia remains controversial. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to determine if treatment reduces adverse outcome in patients with daily life ischemia.", 
    "134": "A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic outpatients with daily life silent ischemia due to coronary artery disease was conducted. The primary outcome measure was event-free survival at 1 year by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Events were death, resuscitated ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, aggravation of angina, or revascularization. The secondary outcome was ischemia during ambulatory ECG monitoring at 4 weeks. Three hundred six outpatients with mild or no angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society class I or II), abnormal exercise tests, and ischemia on ambulatory monitoring were randomized to receive either atenolol (100 mg/d) or placebo. After 4 weeks of treatment, the number (mean +/- SD, 3.6 +/- 4.2 versus 1.7 +/- 4.6 episodes, P < .001) and average duration (30 +/- 3.3 versus 16.4 +/- 6.7 minutes, P < .001) of ischemic episodes per 48 hours of ambulatory monitoring decreased in atenolol- compared with placebo-assigned patients (4.4 +/- 4.6 to 3.1 +/- 6.0 episodes and 36.6 +/- 4.1 to 30 +/- 5.5 minutes). Event-free survival improved in atenolol-treated patients (P < .0066), who had an increased time to onset of first adverse event (120 versus 79 days) and fewer total first events compared with placebo (relative risk, 0.44; 95% confidence intervals, 0.26 to 0.75; P = .001). There was a nonsignificant trend for fewer serious events (death, resuscitation from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for unstable angina) in atenolol-treated patients (relative risk, 0.55; 95% confidence intervals, 0.22 to 1.33; P = .175). The most powerful univariate and multivariate correlate of event-free survival was absence of ischemia on ambulatory monitoring at 4 weeks. Side effects were mild and generally similar comparing atenolol- and placebo-treated patients, although bradycardia was more frequent with atenolol.",

    "136": "Double-wave reentry (DWR) can be a mechanism for acceleration of ventricular tachycardia (VT) with a large excitable gap (EG). The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of heptanol, class Ic, and class III drugs on the inducibility of DWR.", 
    "137": "In 11 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, a thin ring of anisotropic left ventricular epicardium was created by a cryoprocedure. VT with a revolution time of 180 +/- 26 milliseconds and an EG of 106 +/- 8 milliseconds was induced by incremental pacing. During control, entrainment with 10 stimuli at a 99 +/- 15-millisecond interval terminated VT in seven hearts. In four hearts VT was accelerated from 205 +/- 24 to 115 +/- 14 milliseconds by introduction of a second circulating wave in the ring. In the seven VTs that could not be accelerated, 0.5 mumol/L Org7797 (class Ic) and 1.0 mmol/L heptanol (uncoupling agent) prolonged the cycle length of VT by 32% and 37%, respectively. Because the refractory period (RP) only increased by 11%, the EG prolonged by 71% and the ratio between EG and RP was increased from 0.66 to 1.00. Under these conditions, DWR could be induced in all seven hearts. In the four VTs that could be accelerated during control, administration of the class III drug D-sotalol (35 mumol/L) only slightly slowed VT by 6%. Because the RP was prolonged by 15%, the ratio between the EG and the RP decreased from 0.76 to 0.63. Entrainment now failed to accelerate VT in two of four hearts, whereas in the two other hearts, double-wave reentry self-terminated within eight cycles.", 
    "138": "Drugs that increase the ratio of EG and RP enhance the susceptibility to acceleration of VT, whereas drugs that decrease this ratio prevent induction of sustained double-wave reentry.", 
    "139": "It has been suggested that propranolol has unique effects that slow aneurysm expansion by remodeling the structural proteins of the aorta. These effects are believed to be independent of blood pressure reduction, a hypothesis we tested in this investigation with a rat model of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).", 
    "140": "With an established model, AAA were induced in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and genetically hypertensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKHT) rats by perfusing an isolated segment of the infrarenal aorta with elastase. A propranolol dose-response was studied for each strain: (1) saline solution controls (n = 18); (2) propranolol, 10 mg/kg subcutaneously (n = 18); (3) propranolol, 30 mg/kg (n = 14). Systolic blood pressure was determined by tail plethysmography before operation and on day 14, as well as by direct recording at surgery and on day 14. Rats were killed at 14 days, and aneurysm diameter was measured.", 
    "141": "The initial tail BP was 129 +/- 22 mm Hg in WKY animals and 158 +/- 21 mm Hg in WKHT animals (p < 0.0001). Tail BP and intraaortic systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure (BP) were not significantly decreased by propranolol treatment in either strain of rats. However, BP tended to rise in WKY rats, whereas it fell slightly in WKHT rats. Initial aortic size in all animals was 1.06 +/- 0.12. The final aortic size in untreated, hypertensive rats was more than twice that of untreated normotensive controls: 1: WKHT, 3.0 +/- 0.73 mm, 1: WKY, 6.9 +/- 3.5 mm (p < 0.01). After treatment with both doses of propranolol, hypertensive aneurysms were significantly smaller than the untreated WKHT group (p < 0.05) and not significantly different from aneurysms in all groups of normotensive animals: 2: WKY, 3.1 +/- 1.13 mm, 2: WKHT, 4.0 +/- 1.81 mm; 3: WKY, 4.1 +/- 0.41 mm, 3: WKHT, 2.9 +/- 1.24 mm. There was no significant difference in aortic size between the three normotensive WKY groups.", 
    "142": "Hypertension increases the size of aortic aneurysms in this experimental model. Propranolol significantly reduces the size of experimental AAA in hypertensive animals independently of the dose and by a mechanism that may be unrelated to simple BP reduction.", 
    "143": "Exogenous administration of beta-adrenergic agonists has previously been reported to increase lung liquid clearance by stimulation of active sodium transport across the alveolar epithelium. We hypothesized for this study that endogenous release of epinephrine in septic shock would stimulate liquid clearance from the airspaces in rats. Liquid clearance from the air spaces was measured by the concentration of protein over 4 h in a test solution of 5% albumin instilled into one lung. Bacteremic rats developed severe systemic hypotension and metabolic acidosis that was associated with a 100-fold rise in plasma epinephrine levels. There was a 100% increase in liquid clearance from the airspaces of the lung in the bacteremic compared with control rats. To determine the mechanisms responsible for this accelerated lung liquid clearance, amiloride (10(-3) M), a sodium transport inhibitor, was added to the air spaces. Amiloride prevented the increase in liquid clearance from the airspaces, indicating that this effect depended on increased uptake of sodium across the lung epithelium. The addition of propranolol (10(-4) or 10(-5) M) to the instillate also prevented the acceleration in alveolar liquid clearance in the bacteremic rats. We conclude that the release of endogenous catecholamines associated with septic shock markedly stimulates fluid clearance from the distal airspaces of the lung by a beta-adrenergic mediated stimulation of active sodium transport across the epithelial barrier. This data provides evidence for a previously unrecognized mechanism that can protect against or hasten the resolution of alveolar edema in pathological conditions, such as septic shock, that are associated with the endogenous release of catecholamines."
