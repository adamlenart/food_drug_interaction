Definite role in the treatment of these patients is also played by angiotensin-II receptor blockers. Diastolic left ventricular function is widely spread among patients with chronic heart failure and its important value for prognosis has been demonstrated. However effect of modern drugs used for the treatment of chronic heart failure has been poorly studied. We assessed effects of enalapril, its combination with bisoprolol, carvedilol, and irbesartan on parameters of diastolic function in a randomized prospective controlled study on 84 patients with NYHA class III-IV heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction <40%. It has been shown that left ventricular dysfunction is highly prevalent in patients with chronic heart failure and that differentiated approach to the choice of a drug for the treatment of chronic heart failure requires consideration of the type of diastolic dysfunction.", 
    "1": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) are assembled from a pool of nine alpha-subunits and three beta-subunits into functional pentamers in peripheral autonomic neurons. The contribution of different subunits to native, physiologically important nAChR for synaptic transmission in autonomic ganglia is unclear. Here, we examined the importance of the alpha7-subunit for parasympathetic innervation of the heart. Normal (C57BL/6J), alpha7-deficient (Chrna7), and wild-type littermate mice were implanted with telemetry devices, and, under conscious, unsedated conditions, ECG recordings were obtained at baseline and after atropine, propranolol, and hexamethonium bromide administration. Spectral analysis of heart rate variability [power spectral analysis (PSA)] was performed for the evaluation of resting autonomic tone to the heart. At the completion of conscious studies, animals were anesthetized and underwent electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve (VS) while R-R intervals were recorded. Heart rate at baseline and after atropine, propranolol, or hexamethonium was similar in all three groups of animals. PSA curves were similar between normal, wild-type, and Chrna7 mice. VS showed no difference between control and Chrna7 mice throughout the range of stimulation (5-20 Hz). Mice deficient in the alpha7-nAChR subunit do not display differences in resting autonomic tone to the heart at baseline or under conditions of single and combined autonomic blockade. VS showed no difference in heart rate responses between normal and alpha7-deficient mice. These data support previous findings in vitro and highlight the important differences in function between nicotinic receptor subtypes because alpha3-deficient mice display major autonomic dysfunction. We conclude that the alpha7-subunit does not contribute critically to resting parasympathetic control of the heart.",

We randomly assigned 128 drug-naive MP+ patients to either metoprolol or carvedilol, two antihypertensive drugs with different effects on sympathetic activity. The primary outcome was change in CIMT and circulating inflammatory markers at 12 months. Morning BP decreased more among patients in the carvedilol group (P < .001), whereas clinic BP showed a similar decrease in both groups. The CIMT (P < .001), IL-6 (P < .001), IL-18 (P < .001), and CRP (P < .001) decreased more in the carvedilol group than in the metoprolol group. The CIMT regression was observed in 49% of patients in the carvedilol group and 18% of patients in the metoprolol group (P < .01).

    "9": "Ten domestic swine underwent pacemaker implantation (PM) and atrial burst pacing to induce persistent AF. Four days after onset of persistent AF, pigs were randomized to HMR 1556 (30 mg/kg, p.o., 10 days) or placebo. All animals receiving HMR 1556 converted to SR (5.2 +/- 1.9 days), whereas placebo pigs remained in AF. Pigs treated with placebo developed high ventricular rates (297 +/- 5 bpm) and severe heart failure, whereas pigs treated with HMR 1556 remained hemodynamically stable. Left ventricular ejection fraction on the day of euthanization was significantly lower in the placebo compared to the HMR 1556 group (30 +/- 4% vs. 69 +/- 5%, p < 0.005). Similar results were seen with epinephrine levels (placebo 1563 +/- 193 pmol/l vs. HMR 613 +/-196 pmol/l, p < 0.05).

    "11": "Previous studies have suggested that sympathetic cardiac blockade enhances baroreflex function, whereas parasympathetic blockade diminishes baroreflex sensitivity and elicits arterial blood pressure (ABP) instability. The aim of this project was to test the hypothesis that sympathetic cardiac blockade was beneficial in maintaining ABP stability during orthostatic challenge. In 8 young healthy subjects, measurements were taken before and after sympathetic cardiac blockade (beta1-adrenoceptor blockade via metoprolol) in combination with or without parasympathetic blockade (atropine) at rest and during lower body negative pressure (LBNP). Arterial blood samples were obtained to evaluate plasma renin activity (PRA) and norepinephrine (NE). Power spectral analyses were performed on heart rate (HR) and ABP variability. LBNP -50 Torr significantly decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP, -6+/-3 mm Hg) and increased PRA (from 0.72+/-0.23 to 1.75+/-0.24 ng ml(-1) h(-1)) and NE (from 1.02+/-0.11 to 2.13+/-0.32 pg ml(-1)). Low frequency (LF, 0.04-0.12 Hz) SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) variability were significantly augmented by LBNP (4.1+/-1.6 vs. 10.8+/-3.0 mm Hg2, and 3.1+/-1.0 vs. 7.9+/-1.9 mm Hg2, respectively). Following metoprolol, arterial baroreflex sensitivity (assessed by the slope of HR interval to SBP during injection with 1 mug kg(-1) phenylephrine) increased significantly (9.9+/-2.2 to 19.6+/-4.1 ms mm Hg(-1)). With beta1-adrenoceptor blockade, LBNP still decreased SBP (-10+/-2 mm Hg) and increased NE, but did not significantly augment PRA (0.59+/-0.22 vs. 1.03+/-0.18 ng ml(-1) h(-1)), or LF SBP and DBP variability (3.3+/-0.6 vs. 5.7+/-1.3 mm Hg2, and 3.1+/-0.7 vs. 5.4+/-1.1 mm Hg2, respectively). The increased PRA during LBNP remained non-significant following metoprolol combined with atropine, whereas the augmented LF SBP (2.6+/-0.7 vs. 9.9+/-2.8 mm Hg2) and DBP (2.5+/-0.7 vs. 11.1+/-3.0 mm Hg2) variability were significantly accentuated compared to both metoprolol alone and control conditions, accompanied by a greater delta SBP (-17+/-7 mm Hg) and significantly diminished baroreflex gain (0.91+/-0.05 ms/mm Hg). These data suggested that removal of sympathetic cardiac influence improved cardiovascular stability as indicated by a diminished LF ABP variability, which was related to an enhanced cardiac responsiveness.", 
    "12": "We sought to determine the sites of origin of atrial tachyarrhythmias induced by activating mediastinal nerves, as well as the response of such arrhythmias to autonomic modulation. Under general anaesthesia, atrioventricular block was induced after thoracotomy in 19 canines. Brief trains of 5 electrical stimuli were delivered to right-sided mediastinal nerves during the atrial refractory period. Unipolar electrograms were recorded from 191 right and left atrial epicardial sites under several conditions, i.e. (i) with intact nervous systems and following (ii) acute decentralization of the intrathoracic nervous system or administration of (iii) atropine, (iv) timolol, (v) hexamethonium. Concomitant right atrial endocardial mapping was performed in 7 of these dogs. Mediastinal nerve stimulation consistently initiated bradycardia followed by atrial tachyarrhythmias. In the initial tachyarrhythmia beats, early epicardial breakthroughs were identified in the right atrial free wall (28/50 episodes) or Bachmann bundle region (22/50), which corresponded to endocardial sites of origin associated with the right atrial subsidiary pacemaker complex, i.e. the crista terminalis and dorsal locations including the right atrial aspect of the interatrial septum. Neuronally induced responses were eliminated by atropine, modified by timolol and unaffected by acute neuronal decentralization. After hexamethonium, responses to extra-pericardial but not intra-pericardial nerve stimulation were eliminated. It is concluded that concomitant activation of cholinergic and adrenergic efferent intrinsic cardiac neurons induced by right-sided efferent neuronal stimulation initiates atrial tachyarrhythmias that originate from foci anatomically related to the right atrial pacemaker complex and tissues underlying major atrial ganglionated plexuses.", 
    "13": "Although the impairment of beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR)-induced vascular relaxation to isoprenaline has been extensively described, discrepancy persisted in the literature. In this work, we investigated beta-AR-induced relaxation in spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats aorta. We attempted to determine beta-AR subtypes involved in order to understand the conflicting data regarding the beta-AR-induced vasodilation to isoprenaline. Aortic rings isolated from 12-week-old Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were placed in organ baths and constricted with phenylephrine (alpha1-AR agonist). Then, cumulative concentration-relaxation curves (CCRC) to AR agonists were constructed. In intact aortic rings from both strains, isoprenaline (a nonselective beta-AR agonist) (0.001-10 microM) induced similar concentration-dependent relaxations. CCRC was shifted to the right and upward in the presence of nadolol (a nonspecific beta1 and beta2-AR antagonist) (10 microM). After endothelium removal, the response to isoprenaline was partly inhibited in WKY rats, but was strongly inhibited in SHRs. In WKY rats, isoprenaline-induced endothelium-independent relaxation was not modified in the presence of nadolol but was inhibited in the presence of CGP 20712A (low-affinity-state beta1-AR antagonist). In endothelium-denuded rings, SR 58611A (a preferential beta3-AR agonist) (0.1-30 microM) produced a very small relaxation in both strains. In WKY rats, CGP 12177 (CGP) (0.1-30 microM) and cyanopindolol (0.01-3 microM) (partial beta3-AR and low-affinity-state beta1-AR agonists with beta1-AR and beta2-AR antagonistic properties) produced endothelium-independent relaxations. CGP-induced effect was significantly inhibited by CGP 20712A (10 microM) or bupranolol (10 microM) (low-affinity-state beta1-AR antagonists). In SHRs, similarly to the impaired endothelium-independent relaxation to isoprenaline, endothelium-independent relaxations to CGP and cyanopindolol were greatly blunted. These relaxations were not modified in the presence of CGP 20712A. In endothelium-denuded rings pretreated with pertussis toxin, CGP-induced relaxation was not modified in WKY rats, but was partly restored in SHRs. In conclusion, these results showed, that in 12-week-old SHRs, the endothelium-independent component of the relaxation to isoprenaline was impaired, and this impairment could involve the low-affinity-state beta1-AR. G(i) protein overexpression and/or overstimulation may be possible factors that contribute to this alteration in hypertension.", 
    "14": "Previous research in our laboratory has demonstrated a significant memory-enhancing effect of exposure to a complex rhythm stimulus following weakly-reinforced passive avoidance learning in chicks. The aim of this study was to explore whether noradrenaline mediates this process. Chicks were trained on a strongly-reinforced single-trial passive avoidance task involving discrimination between two coloured beads. Intracerebral administration of the protein synthesis blocker, anisomycin, revealed that a phase of memory formation sensitive to arousal levels was extended by approximately 35 min following exposure to the complex rhythm stimulus. Administration of 2,4-dinitrophenol showed that this extension occurred during phase B of intermediate-term memory. Finally, a higher dose of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol, was required to inhibit long-term memory in the presence of the auditory stimulus than in its absence. These findings suggest that the memory-enhancing effects of the complex rhythm stimulus may be mediated by noradrenaline, possibly via an increase in physiological arousal.", 
    "15": "Phenylarsine oxide (PAO), a trivalent arsenical compound, stimulated [Ca2+]i elevation in rat neutrophils in a Ca2+-containing medium but caused no appreciable response in a Ca2+-free medium. PAO also induced external Mn2+ entry, which was inhibited by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), but failed to elicit any appreciable Ba2+ and Sr2+ entry. Pretreatment of neutrophils with thiol-reducing agents including dithiothreitol (DTT), NAC, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol (DMP), 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid (DMPS) and tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), all greatly inhibited PAO-induced [Ca2+]i elevation. Addition of Ni2+ or La3+ followed by PAO stimulation also attenuated the Ca2+ signals in a concentration-dependent manner. PAO had no significant effect on the production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and nitric oxide (NO) nor did it decrease cellular low molecular weight thiols levels. PAO-induced [Ca2+]i elevation was significantly inhibited by 1-[6-[17beta-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U-73122), the inhibitor of phospholipase C-coupled processes, genistein, a general tyrosine kinase inhibitor, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, calyculin A, a cortical actin stabilizer, 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY 294002), a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, 1-[beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl]-1H-imidazole (SKF-96365), and cis-N-(2-phenylcyclopentyl)azacyclotridec-1-en-2-amine (MDL-12,330A), the blockers of receptor-gated and store-operated Ca2+ channels, whereas there was no appreciable effect exerted by aristolochic acid, a phospholipase A2 inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole and N-(3-aminomethyl)benzylacetamidine (1400W), the blockers of NO synthase, and by suspension in a Na+-deprived medium. In contrast, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borane (2-APB), the blocker of IP3 receptor and Ca2+ influx, enhanced the PAO-induced response. PAO had no effect on the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) activity in the pharmacological isolated neutrophil preparation and the neutrophil membrane fractions. These results indicate that PAO stimulates [Ca2+]i rise in rat neutrophils mainly through the oxidation of vicinal thiol groups on the cell surface membrane to activation of a non-store operated Ca2+ entry (non-SOCE) without affecting the activity of PMCA and the plasmalemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.", 
    "16": "Tremor is often a disabling primary condition or secondary to another disorder. No universally effective pharmacological agent exists for the treatment of essential tremor, and patients differ greatly in their response to therapies, thus requiring individualised regimens. Deep brain stimulation is the best option for patients with disabling, drug-resistant essential tremor. Resting tremor in Parkinson's disease is usually not the primary disabling feature, and in most cases, levodopa/carbidopa is satisfactory for many years. Young Parkinson's patients with dominant, disabling tremor benefit from anticholinergics in addition to dopaminergic therapies. However, older Parkinson's patients with more disabling tremor may suffer from dose-dependent side effects, and deep brain stimulation should be considered. This article outlines the available pharmacological agents and treatment considerations for various disabling tremors, including essential tremor and Parkinson's disease.", 
    "17": "An on-line preconcentration method based on ion exchange solid phase extraction was developed for the determination of cationic analytes in capillary electrophoresis (CE). The preconcentration-separation system consisted of a preconcentration capillary bonded with carboxyl cation-exchange stationary phase, a separation capillary for zone electrophoresis and a tee joint interface of the capillaries. Two capillaries were connected closely inside a 0.3 mm i.d. polytetrafluoroethylene tube with a side opening and fixed together by the interface. The preparations of the preconcentration capillaries and interface were described in detail in this paper. The on-line preconcentration and separation procedure of the analysis system included washing and conditioning the capillaries, loading analytes, filling with buffer solution, eluting analytes and separating by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). Several analysis parameters, including sample loading flow rate and time, eluting solution and volume, inner diameter and length of preconcentration capillary etc., were investigated. The proposed method enhanced the detection sensitivity of CE-UV about 5000 times for propranolol and metoprolol compared with normally electrokinetic injection. The detection limits of propranolol and metoprolol were 0.02 and 0.1 microg/L with the proposed method respectively, whereas those were 0.1 and 0.5 mg/L with conventional electrokinetic injection. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed technique can increase the preconcentration factor evidently.",

    "23": "Beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) stimulation increases cytosolic Ca(2+) to physiologically augment cardiac contraction, whereas excessive betaAR activation causes adverse cardiac remodeling, including myocardial hypertrophy, dilation and dysfunction, in individuals with myocardial infarction. The Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a recently identified downstream element of the betaAR-initiated signaling cascade that is linked to pathological myocardial remodeling and to regulation of key proteins involved in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. We developed a genetic mouse model of cardiac CaMKII inhibition to test the role of CaMKII in betaAR signaling in vivo. Here we show CaMKII inhibition substantially prevented maladaptive remodeling from excessive betaAR stimulation and myocardial infarction, and induced balanced changes in excitation-contraction coupling that preserved baseline and betaAR-stimulated physiological increases in cardiac function. These findings mark CaMKII as a determinant of clinically important heart disease phenotypes, and suggest CaMKII inhibition can be a highly selective approach for targeting adverse myocardial remodeling linked to betaAR signaling.",

The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was not significantly different in the two test groups: 11.7% for the amiodarone group and 10% for the diltiazem group. The incidence of atrial fibrillation in the control group was 23.3% and the differences were marginally significant when compared to the amiodarone ( p = 0.093) and diltiazem groups ( p = 0.050).

Less common causes include vertebrobasilar ischemia and retrocochlear tumors. The distinction between peripheral and central vertigo usually can be made clinically and guides management decisions. Most patients with vertigo do not require extensive diagnostic testing and can be treated in the primary care setting. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo usually improves with a canalith repositioning procedure. Acute vestibular neuronitis or labyrinthitis improves with initial stabilizing measures and a vestibular suppressant medication, followed by vestibular rehabilitation exercises. Meniere's disease often responds to the combination of a low-salt diet and diuretics. Vertiginous migraine headaches generally improve with dietary changes, a tricyclic antidepressant, and a beta blocker or calcium channel blocker. Vertigo associated with anxiety usually responds to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.",

However, although numerous interventional studies have been performed they are hampered by a low number of included patients and have often yielded differing results. Thus, in order to overcome current controversies larger multicenter studies are warranted before recommending a general testing for genotype prior to initiation of therapy which interferes with the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.",

The objective of this post hoc analysis was to determine the influence of pulse pressure on outcome. Patients were divided into quartiles of baseline pulse pressure. Cox regression, including baseline Framingham risk score as a covariate, was used to compare risk in the quartiles. In the atenolol group, there were significantly higher risks in the highest versus lowest quartile for the composite end point 28% (confidence interval [CI], 2% to 62%; P=0.035), stroke 84% (CI, 32% to 157%; P<0.001), and total mortality 41% (CI, 7% to 84%; P=0.013). Risk for myocardial infarction was 44% higher (CI, -5% to 120%; P=0.089).

    "33": "Glaucoma is a common eye disease that can cause irreversible blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated. Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the United States and other industrialized countries. In most cases, the symptoms of early-stage glaucoma are minimal or nonexistent. There are several different types of glaucoma, and they have been classically divided into the categories of primary or secondary open-angle or angle-closure glaucoma. Secondary forms of glaucoma are caused by various ocular or systemic diseases. Every available treatment to prevent progressive glaucomatous optic neuropathy has potential adverse effects and involves a certain amount of risk and financial expense. Conventional first-line treatment of glaucoma usually begins with the use of a topical selective or nonselective beta-blocker or a topical prostaglandin analog. Second-line drugs of choice include alpha-agonists and topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Parasympathomimetic agents, most commonly pilocarpine, are considered third-line treatment options. For patients who do not respond to antiglaucoma medications, laser trabeculoplasty and incisional surgery are further methods that can be used to lower intraocular pressure. The results of clinical trials have reaffirmed the utility of antiglaucoma medications in slowing the progression of the disease.",

It is the most common condition requiring re-hospitalization and carries with it a mortality rate of between 25% and 40% (Liu et al., 2003) In British Columbia, approximately 70,000 people (1.5% of the B.C. population) were diagnosed with heart failure in 2003 and it is estimated that a further 70,000 people may be living undiagnosed with the condition (British Columbia Ministry of Health Services, 2003). The vast majority of people with heart failure are over 70 years of age. As our population ages, it is reasonable to expect that the burden of heart failure on our health system will continue to increase. Heart failure is usually a chronic condition marked by frequent exacerbations. It is these exacerbations that bring patients to hospital emergency departments and medical wards.",

Use of immunosuppressive agents (mostly steroids) is still limited to the therapy of disease complications, such as proliferative ophthalmopathy. The aim of the study was to assess the influence of early immunosuppressive treatment of autoimmune thyrotoxicosis with azathioprine on the course of the disease and the incidence of its complications. The study comprised 64 patients (47 females and 17 males aged 20-43 years) for the first time diagnosed with Graves' disease. The subjects were randomised into two groups. Group I consisted of 28 patients treated only with antithyroid drugs, the remaining 36 subjects additionally receiving azathioprine were included into group II. The dose of both drugs was adjusted during the treatment according to metabolic status of each patients. The treatment was continued for 8-14 months, the follow-up duration after therapy withdrawal was 5 years. Euthyreosis was achieved in all patients 2-8 weeks after treatment initiation. No drug intolerance symptoms were observed in group I. In four patients additionally treated with azathioprine, gastrointestinal side effects or leucopenia were present. The disease relapse was observed during the follow-up period in 15 (53.5%) patients of group I and in 3 (8.3%) of group II, the difference was statistically significant (p<0.01). Only one patient receiving additionally azathioprine presented ophthalmic symptoms compared with seven subjects (25%) treated only with antithyroid drugs (p<0.001). The patients of group I were also more frequently referred to surgical treatment due to rapid goitre growth (accordingly 5 (17.8%) and 1 (2.7%) patients, p=0.07), the difference between both groups not being statistically significant.",

Morphological studies have suggested that SCs possess gap junctions, although physiological evidence for gap junctional communication in mammalian SCs is lacking. In the present study we investigated whether coupling exists between SCs situated in tissue slices of OE from neonatal (P0-P4) mice. Using whole cell and cell-attached patch recordings from SCs, we demonstrate that SCs are electrically coupled by junctional resistances on the order of 300 M(omega). Under whole cell recording conditions, Alexa 488 added to the pipette solution failed to reveal dye coupling between SCs. Electrical coupling was deduced from the biexponential decay of capacitive currents recorded from SCs and from the bell-shaped voltage dependency of a P2Y-receptor-activated current, both of which were abolished by 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (20-50 microM), a blocker of gap junctions. These data provide strong evidence for functional coupling between SCs, the physiological importance of which is discussed.",

Candesartan cilexetil showed angiotensin-II blocking action in a dose-dependent manner in rats with dilated cardiomyopathy. Twenty-eight days after immunization, surviving Lewis rats were divided into four groups and given candesartan cilexetil at 0.05 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg per day (Group-C0.05, n = 15, Group-C0.5, n = 15 and Group-C5, n = 15, respectively) or vehicle alone (Group-V, n = 15). After oral administration for 1 month, the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and heart weight/body weight ratio were lower in Group-C0.05 (13.3+/-1.1 mmHg and 3.7+/-0.2 g/kg, respectively), in Group-C0.5 (8.0+/-0.9 mmHg and 3.3+/-0.1 g/kg, respectively) and in Group-C5 (5.5+/-1 mmHg and 3.1+/-0.1 g/kg, respectively) than in Group-V (13.5+/-1.0 mmHg and 3.8+/-0.2 g/kg, respectively). The area of myocardial fibrosis was also lower in Group-C0.05 (25+/-3%), in Group-C0.5 (20+/-3%), and in Group-C5 (12+/-1%) than in Group-V (32+/-4%). Furthermore, expressions of transforming growth factor-beta1 and collagen-III mRNA were suppressed in Group-C0.05 (349+/-23% and 395+/-22%, respectively), Group-C0.5 (292+/-81% and 364+/-42%, respectively) and in Group-C5 (204+/-63% and 259+/-33%, respectively) compared with those in Group-V (367+/-26% and 437+/-18%, respectively).

Patients aged 55-80 years with blood pressures 160-200/<90 mm Hg were followed for a mean of 4.7 years. Blood pressure was similarly reduced in the losartan (n=660) and atenolol (n=666) ISH groups. There were 88 (6.6%) patients who experienced a stroke, 18 of which were fatal. Of patients experiencing strokes, 72.7% had an ischemic stroke. ISH patients in LIFE compared to the non-ISH group had a higher incidence of any stroke and embolic stroke, and similar incidences of fatal, atherosclerotic, and hemorrhagic/other strokes. The incidence of any stroke (40% risk reduction [RR], p=0.02), fatal stroke (70% RR, p=0.035), and atherothrombotic stroke (45% RR, p=0.022) was significantly lower in losartan-treated compared to the atenolol-treated patients. The 36% RR for embolic strokes in the losartan group was not statistically significantly (p=0.33) different from the atenolol group. These data suggest that losartan-based treatment is more effective than an atenolol-based treatment for patients with ISH and a high risk for stroke.",

Ring segments of the oviduct were set up for isometric tension recording. The effect of isoprenaline and BRL 37344 on smooth muscle tone was examined. The expression of beta3-adrenoceptors in the oviduct was also examined. Isoprenaline and BRL 37344 concentration-dependently relaxed circular muscles of the oviduct. BRL 37344 was less potent than isoprenaline and was a partial agonist. Propranolol shifted isoprenaline but not BRL 37344 concentration-response curve to the right without reducing the maximum response. Cyanopindolol (1 micromol/l), a beta3-adrenoceptor antagonist, shifted the isoprenaline concentration response curve to the right. The -log K(B) value of 7.8 indicates activation of beta3-adrenoceptors by isoprenaline. mRNA for beta3-adrenoceptors was expressed in the oviduct. These results suggest that beta3-adrenoceptors, mediating relaxation, are expressed in the human oviduct.",

Quantitation was achieved with UV detection at 274 nm based on peak area. The other two-chemometric-assisted spectrophotometric methods applied were principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS-1). These approaches were successfully applied to quantify each drug in the mixture using the information included in the absorption spectra of appropriate solutions in the range 240-290 nm with the intervals Deltalambda=0.2 nm.

The volume fractions of two solvents (f(2), f(3)) and cologarithm of electrophoretic mobilities in pure solvents (i.e., -Lnmu(1), -Lnmu(2) and -Lnmu(3)) were used as inputs and cologarithm of the mobility in mixed solvents was the output of the networks. The number of neurons in hidden layer, learning rate, momentum and the number of epochs were optimized, in which two neurons in hidden layer, 0.2, 0.9 and 20000 were found the optimized values for learning rate, momentum and number of epochs, respectively. Mean percentage deviations (MPD) between calculated and experimental mobilities were computed as an accuracy criterion. To assess the correlative ability of the model, all data points in each set were used as training set and the mobilities were back-calculated by the trained networks, in which the overall MPD (OMPD)+/- standard deviation (SD) for correlative study was 3.1+/- 2.3. To evaluate the prediction capability of the proposed ANN model, the network was trained using 15 data points for each analyte and the remaining data points were predicted. The obtained OMPD (+/-SD) for this analysis was 3.6+/-3.0. To further investigate on the applicability of ANN, a generalized network was trained with 10 data points from each beta-blocker and then the network was employed to predict the mobilities of the analytes in ternary solvent electrolyte systems. The MPDs for predicted mobilities were 3.6%, 3.6%, 3.9%, 3.7% and 2.9% respectively for labetalol, atenolol, practolol, timolol and propranolol.",

It is recommended that all patients with cirrhosis be screened for gastroesophageal varices and those with large varices should be offered primary prophylaxis. Nonselective beta-blockers (nadolol or propranolol) are the treatment of choice for primary prophylaxis but there are a number of limitations to their use. A number of studies have evaluated the efficacy of variceal band ligation (VBL) in providing primary prophylaxis, either in comparison to no treatment or to beta-blockers. VBL is very effective in preventing the initial bleed when compared to no treatment, but it is not superior to beta-blockers. In this issue of the journal the effect of beta-blockers on bleeding in patients undergoing VBL is examined and no benefit compared to VBL alone is shown. Thus, patients with large varices should be treated with beta-blockers and VBL should be offered to those cirrhotics who are unable to take beta-blockers. Further study is required to determine if VBL in combination with beta-blockers is more effective than the beta-blockers alone.",

We attempted to clarify the effects of nipradilol on the expression of apoptosis associated genes and the activity of nuclear factor-kappaB, a transcription factor, in PC12 cells during serum deprivation induced apoptosis. PC12 cells were cultured in serum free RPMI1640 medium with or without 0.01, 0.1, 1, or 10 microM of nipradilol, or in serum-added medium as a control. The gene expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, Fas, FasL, Caspase-1, 2, 3, and 9, p53, and Smac/DIABLO were examined using a quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction method, while nuclear factor-kappaB activity was examined using an electrophoresis mobility shift assay with a nuclear factor-kappaB consensus sequenced DNA probe. The effects of denitronipradilol were also examined to clarify the effect of nitric oxide donative action. Nipradilol down-regulated Bax gene expression 12 hr after serum deprivation, and that of the capase-9 and Smac/DIABLO genes at 24 hr, compared to the serum-free sample, while it also increased cell viability and decreased DNA ladder formation at 48 hr. However, the expressions of other examined genes were not affected by the agent. In addition, nuclear factor-kappaB activity was increased 2 hr after the addition of 0.1 or 1 microM of nipradilol. In contrast, denitronipradilol did not show any effects toward PC12 cells.

A population of 4,304 patients who did not have HF but did have angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease (>/=1 stenosis of >/=70%) without AMI at hospital presentation was evaluated. Baseline demographics, cardiac risk factors, clinical presentation, therapeutic procedures, and discharge medications were recorded. Patients were followed for a mean of 3.0 +/- 1.9 years (range 1 month to 6.9 years) for outcomes of all-cause death or AMI. Patients' average age was 65 +/- 11 years and 77% were men. Overall, 10% died and 5% had a nonfatal AMI.

After adjustment for 16 covariates, including statin prescription, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor prescription, and type of baseline therapy, the effect of beta blockers on the combination end point of death/AMI was eliminated. However, the effect of beta blockers on death remained (hazard ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.93, p = 0.02). Thus, beta blockers are clearly indicated for most patients who have HF or AMI, and our results suggest that patients who have coronary artery disease without these conditions have approximately the same protective benefit against death.

    "81": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. It is common in the elderly and those with structural heart disease. Clinical classification can be helpful in treatment decisions and the most widely accepted classification scheme (first episode, recurrent paroxysmal, recurrent persistent, permanent) is found in the ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines. The pathophysiology of AF remains unclear at this time. It is unlikely that a single pathophysiology is operative in all or even a majority of cases. Therapies to be considered for AF include prevention of thromboembolism, rate control, and restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm. These therapies and specific treatments for these purposes are discussed under these headings, including a section on the relative merits of the rate control and rhythm control strategies. Risk stratification is a fundamental part of the treatment for thromboembolism. When risk warrants treatment, prevention of thromboembolism is achieved either pharmacologically with aspirin, or with warfarin or new agents like ximelagatran, or by nonpharmacological approaches. Schema to assist in risk stratification and selection of appropriate antithrombotic therapy are provided. Recent trials comparing the strategy of rate control to the strategy of rhythm control failed to demonstrate that the rhythm control approach is superior to the rate control approach in patients and therapies studied so far. Rate control is an acceptable primary line of therapy in many patients, particularly the elderly with persistent AF who are not highly symptomatic. However, the risk and benefit of each treatment modality should be individualized according to the patient circumstances and comorbidity. Algorithms to help individualize which of the two strategies to use are provided. There are a number of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies available for rhythm management of AF. Pharmacologic cardioversion is an alternative to electrical cardioversion for recent onset AF but the latter is preferred for persistent AF. Current drug therapy to maintain sinus rhythm is neither highly effective nor completely safe. An algorithm to guide selection of the most appropriate antiarrhythmic drug for an individual patient is provided. Nonpharmacologic therapies for maintenance of sinus rhythm include surgery, radiofrequency ablation, devices, and hybrid (combination) therapies. Much remains to be learned about the role and application of such therapies. Pharmacologic heart rate control can be achieved for most patients with available agents and, when it cannot, there are effective nonpharmacologic therapies. A few specific situations in which AF occurs and for which there are some special considerations are described.",

    "89": "The small GTP-binding protein ADP ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) has recently been implicated in the internalization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), although its precise molecular mechanism in this process remains unclear. We have recently identified centaurin alpha(1) as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for ARF6. In the current study, we characterized the effects of centaurin alpha(1) on the agonist-induced internalization of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as well as confocal imaging of cells, we found that expression of centaurin alpha(1) strongly inhibited the isoproterenol-induced internalization of beta(2)-adrenoceptor. On the other hand, expression of functionally inactive versions of centaurin alpha(1), including an R49C mutant, which has no catalytic activity, and a double pleckstrin homology (PH) mutant (DM; R148C/R273C), which has mutations in both the PH domains of centaurin alpha(1), rendering it unable to translocate to the cell membrane, were unable to inhibit beta(2)-adrenoceptor internalization. In addition, a constitutively active version of ARF6, ARF6Q67L, reversed the ability of centaurin alpha(1) to inhibit beta(2)-adrenoceptor internalization. Finally, expression of centaurin alpha(1) also inhibited the agonist-induced internalization of beta(2)-adrenoceptor endogenously expressed in HEK 293 cells, whereas the R49C and DM mutant versions of centaurin alpha(1) had no effect. Together, these data indicate that by acting as an ARF6 GAP, centaurin alpha(1) is able to switch off ARF6 and so inhibit its ability to mediate beta(2)-adrenoceptor internalization. Thus, ARF6 GAPs, such as centaurin alpha(1), are likely to play a crucial role in GPCR trafficking by modulating the activity of ARF6.", 
    "90": "Tramadol, (1RS,2RS)-2-[(dimethylamine)-methyl]-1-(3-methoxyphenyl)-cyclohexanol hydrochloride, is an atypical centrally acting analgesic agent with relatively weak opioid receptor affinity and which, like some antidepressants, is able to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in the raphe nucleus. We have previously demonstrated that pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker/5-hydroxytryptamine(1A/1B) receptor antagonist, enhanced tramadol antinociception and that the selective 5-HT1A agonist 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) reduced it. These effects were related to the negative feedback control that regulates raphe region neurones. The current study examines the ability of the selective antagonist at somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors, N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl] ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexane carboxamide (WAY100635, 0.8 mg/kg), the selective antagonist at terminal 5-HT1B receptors, N-[3-(2-dimethylamino) ethoxy-4-methoxyphenyl]-2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4-carboxamide (SB216641, 0.1-0.8 mg/kg) and the selective agonist at 5-HT1B receptors, 1,4-tDihydro-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-5H-pyrrolo[3,2-b] pyridin-5-one (CP93129, 0.2-0.4 mg/kg), to modify the antinociceptive effect of 4-64 mg/kg of tramadol in the hot plate test in mice. The results show that 0.8 mg/kg of WAY100635 enhanced antinociceptive effect of tramadol while neither agonism nor antagonism at the 5-HT1B receptor modifies it significantly at the doses tested. These results account for involvement of the somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors in the analgesic effect of tramadol and support the supraspinal interaction of serotonin and the opioid system in the regulation of pain.", 
    "91": "Improved recognition of the relationship between childhood and adult blood pressures and identification of end-organ damage in children, adolescents, and young adults with hypertension has led to increased focus by pediatricians and general practitioners on the detection, evaluation, and treatment of hypertension. Notably, detection, evaluation, and treatment of pediatric hypertension has increased significantly since the first Task Force Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents in 1977 with advances in both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments.Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (e.g. captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril) and calcium channel antagonists (e.g. nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine) are the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive medications in children due to their low adverse-effect profiles. Diuretics (e.g. thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics) are usually reserved as adjunct therapy. Newer agents, such as angiotensin receptor antagonists (e.g. irbesartan), are currently being studied in children and adolescents. These agents may be an option in children with chronic cough secondary to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. beta-Adrenoreceptor antagonists (e.g. propranolol, atenolol, metoprolol, and labetalol), alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists, alpha-adrenoreceptor agonists, direct vasodilators, peripheral adrenoreceptor neuron agonists, and combination products are less commonly used in pediatric patients because of adverse events but may be an option in children unresponsive to calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers.", 
    "92": "The study reported here shows a practicable preparation of pure atenolol enantiomers using enantioselective liquid chromatography. The successful separation of enantiomers of the final atenolol and the intermediate ester and the good peak shapes could not have been obtained without diethylamine as a component of the mobile phase. That makes difficult the recycling of the three-component mobile phase, an unavoidable step in simulated moving bed chromatography separation technology. The only suitable methodology for preparation of atenolol enantiomers proved to be synthesis from its N-benzyl-N-isopropyl precursor and the chiral stationary phase Chiralpak AD was found to be very convenient for preparative separation of these enantiomers. The enantiomeric purities and recovery of separated enantiomers of this N-benzyl-N-isopropyl precursor were very high, allowing high enantiomeric purities of the final products, ee's 99.3% for S- and 99.0% for R-atenolol. The chromatographic separation parameters, as well as solubility of racemate in the mobile phase, are good bases for the further examination of possible scale-up resolution of compound 6.", 
    "93": "It is well established now that beta-blockers are an important treatment of heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction. It has been shown that this drugs counteract the negative effects of sympathetic stimulation on the myocardium (myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis and ischemia arythmogenic effect, increase of cardiac loading, apoptosis). Many big trials as CIBIS-II, MERIT-HF and CAPRICORN show that Bisoprolol, Metropolol and Carvedilol decrease the hospitalization rate due to heart failure, improve the functional status and increase the survival rate of patients in class II, Ill and IV. However, beta-blockers are not always safe and there use must be guided by some rules: respect of contra-indications (asthma, severe bradycardia, second or third atrio-ventricular block, arterial hypotension), initiation after 2 or 4 weeks of clinical stability, low initial doses with an increase every 2 or 4 weeks.", 
    "94": "Acute myocarditis may result in severe hemodynamic compromise with fatal outcome. Furthermore, recent studies suggest myocarditis as a major cause of sudden unexpected death. A variety of cardiotropic viral, rickettsial, and bacterial infectious agents have been identified to date. Parvovirus B19 (PVB19) is usually benign in childhood, but it may also cause death due to myocarditis. We present here the case of an adult female who presented with fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and orthostatic dizziness 8 months after successful liver transplantation. Cardiologic work-up, including left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy, revealed acute myocarditis secondary to PVB19. Since no specific therapy for this virus is available, the patient was treated symptomatically with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor plus beta-blocker and diuretics. After a period of stabilization, new-onset rapid atrial fibrillation caused acute low-output syndrome within 14 days after hospital admission. The patient eventually died because of refractory cardiogenic shock. In conclusion, to our knowledge this is the first report of PVB19-induced myocarditis confirmed by detection of viral genome in myocardium in a liver transplant recipient.",

As compared to atenolol, losartan treatment was associated with less increase in MFVR (4.3 versus 27%, P < 0.05) and less decrease in M/IG (24 versus -14%, P < 0.01). The relative change in M/IG was inversely associated with the relative change in MFVR (r = -0.16, P < 0.05) independently of the relative change in body mass index (r = -0.29, P < 0.001).",

    "110": "Which therapeutic strategy among medical, interventional and surgical options should be preferred in patients with chronic stable ischemic heart disease is an important public health problem. The available scientific evidence does not help much to facilitate the choice among the three available strategies of medical treatment, percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting. In this area practice-based medicine overwhelms evidence-based medicine. However, existing findings are discussed. The present experience in diabetic patients is highlighted; in such patients surgery is generally recommended but the results obtained by percutaneous coronary intervention with the currently available tools are improving markedly. Pharmacological therapy is also improving, particularly in the prevention of the progression of atherothrombosis and consequently of cardiovascular events. Actually two categories of drugs should be recognized: those prescribed to prevent death and myocardial infarction and those with antianginal and anti-ischemic effects aimed at alleviating symptoms and reducing ischemia. The first group of drugs includes antiplatelet-antithrombotic agents, lipid-lowering agents and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; the second group includes beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and nitrates. A good integration of the two classes of drugs, combined with an appropriate use of coronary revascularization procedures, should yield the maximum possible benefit in the individual patient.",

Lowering blood pressure too importantly during this period may worsen the outcome of the patient. Antihypertensive therapy is therefore required only when blood pressure is severely increased, especially in the presence of intracerebral haemorrhage. Initiating treatment before admission to the hospital is not recommended. The medications to be preferred are the blockers of the renin-angiotensin system, the beta-blocker labetalol (which possesses also alpha-blocking properties) and NO donors.",

The correction of anaemia, aggravating factor in heart failure, improves symptoms and survival of the patient. 2. It remains to prove that the treatment of sleep apnea, which seems to be an additional factor for mortality in cardiovascular diseases, is able to reduce the risk. 3. The interventions in the endocanabino\u00efd system which regulates weight and metabolic processes might be a promising new therapeutic acquisition. 4. Prevention of coronary disease with lipid lowering drugs is still a major topic, and the trend goes the lower the better. The problems observed with Rofecoxybe and other drug interactions reminds us to be conscious when prescribing multiple drugs. 5. The implantable defibrillator seems to be a life insurance in the event of ventricular fibrillation. However, it is not so easy to identify the patient who might really benefit.", 
    "113": "This study was done to evaluate the effect of treatment with manidipine as compared with atenolol on thrombin-mediated platelet aggregation in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. After a 2-week washout placebo period, 60 elderly patients (aged 65-80 years) with isolated systolic hypertension (SBP > 140 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to manidipine 10 mg or atenolol 50 mg 6-week treatment according to a double-blind, crossover design. Thirty patients had a concomitant well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (HbA1c < or = 6.5%). At the end of the washout and of each treatment period, blood pressure (BP) (by mercury sphygmomanometer) and platelet aggregation (by Born-type aggregometer) were evaluated. Blood samples were collected using sodium citrate as anticoagulant, and platelet aggregation was induced by 2 different concentrations of ADP and collagen. Manidipine and atenolol produced a significant BP reduction in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients, with no difference between treatments. Despite the similar BP effect, in diabetic patients manidipine produced a significant reduction in platelet aggregation induced by both doses of either ADP or collagen. In nondiabetic hypertensives, manidipine inhibited platelet aggregation only at the highest doses of both inducers. The difference in the platelet inhibitory effect of manidipine between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects was statistically significant (P < 0.05) at both inducer concentrations. No changes in platelet aggregation were observed in the atenolol group. These data indicate that, unlike atenolol, manidipine inhibits platelet aggregation in elderly hypertensive patients, expecially in those with associated type II diabetes mellitus. The clinical impact of this positive effect in terms of prevention of cardiovascular complications in these high-risk patients remains to be clarified.", 
    "114": "Potassium channels are widespread in living cells and are involved in many diseases. The scorpion toxin alpha-KTx(12.1) interacts with various K(+) channels, suggesting its capacity to match diverse channel pores. It is recognized that tissue injuries may affect the pH at toxins site of action, thereby modulating both protein conformation and activity. To better understand its molecular mechanism of action, we studied alpha-KTx(12.1) using pH as a tool to explore its plasticity and NMR in combination with MD calculations to detect it. The toxin solution structure consists of an alpha-helix and a triple-stranded beta-sheet stabilized by four disulfide bridges. The NMR results show, in addition, that His28 possesses an unusually low pK(a) of 5.2. The best set of protein conformers is obtained at pH 4.5, while at pH 7.0, the reduced number of NOEs resulting from a faster hydrogen exchange does not allow to reach a good structural convergence. Nonetheless, MD calculations show that the toxin structure does not vary significantly in that pH range, while conformational changes and modifications of the surface charge distribution occur when His28 is fully protonated. Moreover, essential dynamics analysis reveals variations in the toxin's coherent motions. In conclusion, His28, with its low pK(a) value, provides alpha-KTx(12.1) with the ability to preserve its active conformation over a wide pH interval, thus expanding the range of cellular conditions where the toxin can fully exhibit its activity. Overall, the results further underline the role of histidine as a natural controller of proteins' functionality.", 
    "115": "The effect of calcium antagonist on clinical outcome is controversial. A recent study investigated the safety and efficacy of the calcium antagonist nifedipine GITS (gastro-intestinal therapeutic system) in patients with stable, but symptomatic coronary disease. ACTION randomised 7.665 patients to double-blind addition of nifedipine 60 mg once daily or placebo during a mean follow-up of 4.9 years. Most patients were already treated by a beta-blocker, a statine, or aspirine. The addition of nifedipine was well tolerated with a low incidence of side effects. With nifedipine, the development of heart failure was reduced by 29 %. There was also a reduction in the need for coronary angiography and bypass grafting (reduction of 18 and 21%, respectively). The primary efficacy and safety outcomes were not different between nifedipine GITS and placebo. The rate of total mortality and cardiovascular death were not significantly different. The addition of nifedipine GITS to convential treatment of stable angina is safe, has no effect on major cardiovascular event free survival, but reduces the need for coronary angiography and interventions.", 
    "116": "We studied the impact of smoking in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study, which showed superiority of losartan over atenolol for reduction of composite risk of cardiovascular death, stroke and myocardial infarction in hypertensives with left ventricular hypertrophy. We compared hazard ratios in 4656 never-smokers, and 3033 previous and 1499 current smokers, adjusting for gender, age, alcohol intake, exercise and race. Composite endpoint rate was higher in previous (28/1000 years), as well as current (39/1000 years) smokers than in never-smokers (21/1000 years). Composite (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.94, p < 0.01) and stroke (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.47-0.80], p < 0.001) risks were lower with losartan than atenolol in never-smokers, but not significantly in previous smokers. Drug regimens did not differ in current smokers (composite hazard ratio 0.99, stroke hazard ratio 0.94). Smoking-treatment interactions were non-significant, but a borderline significant trend (p = 0.05) suggested decreasing benefit of losartan vs atenolol for stroke prevention from never- to previous to current smoking status. Smoking increased cardiovascular risk markedly in the LIFE study. The benefit of losartan vs atenolol is consistent with the overall conclusion of the LIFE study, although the treatment effect appeared largest in non-smokers.",

    "118": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is characterized by glomerulopathy and tubulointerstitial expansion followed by renal fibrosis. Angiotensin II (Ang II) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) are involved in the pathogenesis of DN, while Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is important in advanced glycation end-product (AGE)-induced effects in renal interstitial (NRK-49F) fibroblasts. Thus, we studied the role of Ang II, CTGF, and JAK2 in AGE-induced effects in NRK-49F cells. We found that AGE (150 microg/ml) increased mitogenesis and type I collagen production at 7 days while Ang II (10(-7)M) increased mitogenesis and type I collagen production at 3 days. We also found that AGE (150 microg/ml) increased angiotensinogen protein at 2 days, which was attenuated by AG-490 (a JAK2 inhibitor). AGE (150 microg/ml) increased CTGF mRNA and protein expression at 3 and 5 days, respectively. Ang II (10(-7)M) increased CTGF mRNA and protein expression at 1 and 2 days, respectively, which were attenuated by AG-490. Moreover, losartan (a type I angiotensin receptor blocker) and captopril (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) attenuated AGE-induced CTGF mRNA/protein expression while attenuating AGE-induced mitogenesis and type I collagen production. AG-490 and CTGF antisense (but not sense) oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) attenuated Ang II (10(-7)M) and AGE-induced mitogenesis and type I collagen production at 3 and 7 days, respectively. We concluded that AGE (150 microg/ml)-induced mitogenesis and type I collagen production are dependent on the Ang II-JAK2-CTGF pathway in NRK-49F cells. Moreover, Ang II-induced mitogenesis and type I collagen production are dependent on the JAK2-CTGF pathway.",

Subcutaneous cyclosporine administration (20 mg/kg/day) for 12 days had no effect on blood pressure or its variability index (SDMAP). In contrast, the average level of heart rate and its variability indices (SDRR and rMSSD) showed significant increases and decreases, respectively, in cyclosporine- compared with vehicle-treated rats. Vagal (atropine) or beta -adrenergic (propranolol) blockade had no effect on blood pressure but elicited increases and decreases, respectively, in heart rate. Compared with control rats, cyclosporine-treated rats exhibited lesser tachycardic responses to atropine and greater bradycardic responses to propranolol, suggesting alterations of cardiac vagal (attenuation) and sympathetic (enhancement) activity by cyclosporine. Further, atropine reduced indices of heart rate variability (rMSSD and SDRR) in control rats, effects that were blunted by cyclosporine treatment. On the other hand, propranolol had no effect on heart rate variability in either cyclosporine-treated or control rats. These findings implicate vagally-mediated alterations in the cardiac sympathovagal balance in the cyclosporine-induced impairment of heart rate oscillations.", 
    "128": "In order to identify genetic polymorphisms and haplotype frequencies of CYP1A2 in a Japanese population, the enhancer and promoter regions, all the exons with their surrounding introns, and intron 1 were sequenced from genomic DNA from 250 Japanese subjects. Thirty-three polymorphisms were found, including 13 novel ones: 2 in the enhancer region, 5 in the exons, and 6 in the introns. The most common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was -163C>A (CYP1A2*1F allele) with a 0.628 frequency. In addition to six previously reported non-synonymous SNPs, three novel ones, 125C>G (P42R, CYP1A2*15 allele, MPJ6_1A2032), 1130G>A (R377Q, *16 allele, MPJ6_1A2033), and 1367G>A (R456H, *8 allele, MPJ6_1A2019), were found with frequencies of 0.002, 0.002, and 0.004, respectively. No polymorphism was found in the known nuclear transcriptional factor-binding sites in the enhancer region. Based on linkage disequilibrium analysis, the CYP1A2 gene was analyzed as one haplotype block. Using the 33 detected polymorphisms, 14 haplotypes were unambiguously identified, and 17 haplotypes were inferred by aid of an expectation-maximization-based program. Among them, the second major haplotype CYP1A2*1L is composed of -3860G>A (*1C allele), -2467delT (*1D allele), and -163C>A (*1F allele). Network analysis suggested that relatively rare haplotypes were derived from three major haplotypes, *1A, *1M, and *1N in most cases. Our findings provide fundamental and useful information for genotyping CYP1A2 in the Japanese, and probably Asian populations.",

In all regions, younger and healthier patients were more likely than older high-risk patients to receive invasive treatment and medical therapy. Regions with more invasive treatment practice styles had more cardiac catheterization laboratory capacity; patients in these regions were more likely to receive interventional treatment, regardless of age, clinical indication, or risk profile. The absolute unadjusted difference in 7-year survival between regions providing the highest rates of both invasive and medical management strategies and those providing the lowest rates of both was 6.2%. For both ST- and non-ST-segment elevation AMI patients, survival improved with regional intensity of both invasive and medical management. In areas with higher rates of medical management, there appeared to be little or no improvement in survival associated with increased invasive treatment.", 
    "134": "In elderly Medicare patients with AMI, more intensive medical treatment provides population survival benefits. However, routine use of more costly and invasive treatment strategies may not be associated with an overall population benefit beyond that seen with excellent medical management. Efforts should focus on directing invasive clinical resources to patients with the greatest expected benefit.", 
    "135": "Cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6) genotyping reliably predicts poor metabolizer phenotype in Caucasians, but is less accurate in African Americans. To evaluate discordance we have observed in phenotype to genotype correlation studies, select African American subjects were chosen for complete resequencing of the CYP2D6 gene including 4.2 kb of the CYP2D7-2D6 intergenic region. Comparisons were made to a CYP2D6(*)1 reference sequence revealing novel SNPs in the upstream, coding and intervening sequences. These sequence variations, defining four functional alleles (CYP2D6(*)41B, (*)45A and B and (*)46), were characterized for their ability to influence splice site strength, transcription level or catalytic protein activity. Furthermore, their frequency was determined in a population of 251 African Americans. A -692(TGTG) deletion (CYP2D6(*)45B) did not significantly decrease gene expression, nor could any other upstream SNP explain a genotype-discordant case. CYP2D6(*)45 and (*)46 have a combined frequency of 4% and can be identified by a common SNP. Carriers are predicted to exhibit an extensive or intermediate CYP2D6 phenotype.", 
    "136": "Hypotonic shock rapidly inhibits Cl(-) secretion by chloride cells, an effect that is osmotic and not produced by NaCl-depleted isosmotic solutions, yet the mechanism for the inhibition and its recovery are not known. We exposed isolated opercular epithelia, mounted in Ussing chambers, to hypotonic shock in the presence of a variety of chemicals: a general protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine, G\u00f66976 that selectively blocks PKC alpha and beta subtypes, H-89 that blocks PKA, SB203580 that blocks p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), as well as serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP1 and 2A) inhibitor okadaic acid, and finally tamoxifen, a blocker of volume-activated anion channels (VSOAC). Chelerythrine has no effect on hypotonic inhibition but blocked the recovery, indicating PKC involvement in stimulation. G\u00f66976 had little effect, suggesting that PKC alpha and PKC beta subtypes are not involved. H-89 did not block hypotonic inhibition but decreased the recovery, indicating PKA may be involved in the recovery and overshoot (after restoration of isotonic conditions). SB203580 significantly enhanced the decrease in current by hypotonic shock, suggesting an inhibitory role of p38 MAPK in the hypotonic inhibition. Okadaic acid increased the steady state current, slowed the hypotonic inhibition but made the decrease in current larger; also the recovery and overshoot were completely blocked. Hypotonic stress rapidly and transiently increased phosphorylated p38 MAPK (pp38) MAPK (measured by western analysis) by eightfold at 5 min, then more slowly again to sevenfold at 60 min. Hypertonic shock slowly increased p38 by sevenfold at 60 min. Phosphorylated JNK kinase was increased by 40-50% by both hypotonic and hypertonic shock and was still elevated at 30 min in hypertonic medium. By immunoblot analysis it was found that the stress protein kinase (SPAK) and oxidation stress response kinase 1 (OSR1) were present in salt and freshwater acclimated fish with higher expression in freshwater. By immunocytochemistry, SPAK, OSR1 and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (pFAK) were colocalized with NKCC at the basolateral membrane. The protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (100 micromol l(-1)) inhibited Cl(-) secretion that was high, increased Cl(-) secretion that was low and reduced immunocytochemical staining for phosphorylated FAK. We present a model for rapid control of CFTR and NKCC in chloride cells that includes: (1) activation of NKCC and CFTR via cAMP/PKA, (2) activation of NKCC by PKC, myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), p38, OSR1 and SPAK, (3) deactivation of NKCC by hypotonic cell swelling, Ca(2+) and an as yet unidentified protein phosphatase and (4) involvement of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) acting on FAK to set levels of NKCC activity.",

We analysed the prognostic relevance on other outcomes of atrial fibrillation on the baseline electrocardiogram compared with no atrial fibrillation and the impact of new onset atrial fibrillation during follow-up. A multivariate analysis was performed using a Cox regression model where 10 baseline covariates were entered together with study treatment allocation. Six hundred patients (19.8%) had atrial fibrillation at baseline. These patients were older (65 vs. 61 years), included more men (88 vs.78%), had more severe symptoms [higher New York Heart Association (NYHA) class] and a longer duration of heart failure (all P<0.0001). Atrial fibrillation was associated with significantly increased mortality [relative risk (RR) 1.29: 95% CI 1.12-1.48; P<0.0001], higher all-cause death or hospitalization (RR 1.25: CI 1.13-1.38), and cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening heart failure (RR 1.34: CI 1.20-1.52), both P<0.0001. By multivariable analysis, atrial fibrillation no longer independently predicted mortality. Beneficial effects on mortality by carvedilol remained significant (RR 0.836: CI 0.74-0.94; P=0.0042). New onset atrial fibrillation during follow-up (n=580) was associated with significant increased risk for subsequent death in a time-dependent analysis (RR 1.90: CI 1.54-2.35; P<0.0001) regardless of treatment allocation and changes in NYHA class.",

Here we report that gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABA(A)) receptor alpha1-/- mice exhibit postural and kinetic tremor and motor incoordination that is characteristic of essential tremor disease. We tested mice with essential-like tremor using current drug therapies that alleviate symptoms in essential tremor patients (primidone, propranolol, and gabapentin) and several candidates hypothesized to reduce tremor, including ethanol; the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801; the adenosine A1 receptor agonist 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA); the GABA(A) receptor modulators diazepam, allopregnanolone, and Ro15-4513; and the L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist nitrendipine. Primidone, propranolol, and gabapentin reduced the amplitude (power) of the pathologic tremor. Nonsedative doses of ethanol eliminated tremor in mice. Diazepam, allopregnanolone, Ro15-4513, and nitrendipine had no effect or enhanced tremor, whereas MK-801 and CCPA reduced tremor. To understand the etiology of tremor in these mice, we studied the electrophysiological properties of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Cerebellar Purkinje cells in GABA(A) receptor alpha1-/- mice exhibited a profound loss of all responses to synaptic or exogenous GABA, but no differences in abundance, gross morphology, or spontaneous synaptic activity were observed. This genetic animal model elucidates a mechanism of GABAergic dysfunction in the major motor pathway and potential targets for pharmacotherapy of essential tremor.",

Three optimization approaches, i.e., direct infusion-MS, capillary zone electrophoresis-MS, and chiral micellar electrokinetic chromatography-mass spectrometry (CMEKC-MS), were investigated to optimize sheath liquid parameters, spray chamber parameters, and CMEKC separation parameters for maximum sensitivity and chiral resolution. Compared to unpolymerized micelle of L-SUCL, the use of micelle polymer (i.e., poly-L-SUCL) provided significantly higher separation efficiency, lower separation current, and higher detection sensitivity for CMEKC-ESI-MS of beta-blockers. It was also observed that, unlike monomeric L-SUCL, polymeric L-SUCL provided enantioseparation of all beta-blockers even at the lowest surfactant concentration (i.e., 5 mM poly-L-SUCL).

It may be caused by exogenous or endogenous factors: excessive TSH suppressive therapy with L-thyroxine (L-T4) for benign thyroid nodular disease, differentiated thyroid cancer, or hormone over-replacement in patients with hypothyroidism are the most frequent causes. Consistent evidence indicates that 'subclinical' hyperthyroidism reduces the quality of life, affecting both the psycho and somatic components of well-being, and produces relevant signs and symptoms of excessive thyroid hormone action, often mimicking adrenergic overactivity. Subclinical hyperthyroidism exerts many significant effects on the cardiovascular system; it is usually associated with a higher heart rate and a higher risk of supraventricular arrhythmias, and with an increased left ventricular mass, often accompanied by an impaired diastolic function and sometimes by a reduced systolic performance on effort and decreased exercise tolerance. It is well known that these abnormalities usually precede the onset of a more severe cardiovascular disease, thus potentially contributing to the increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality observed in these patients. In addition, it is becoming increasingly apparent that subclinical hyperthyroidism may accelerate the development of osteoporosis and hence increased bone vulnerability to trauma, particularly in postmenopausal women with a pre-existing predisposition.

In the present study, we describe the effects of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl heptanoate (TMPH), a novel compound that is a potent inhibitor of neuronal nicotinic receptors. Evaluation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes indicated that TMPH can produce a potent and long-lasting inhibition of neuronal nAChR formed by the pairwise combination of the most abundant neuronal alpha (i.e., alpha3 and alpha4) and beta subunits (beta2 and beta4), with relatively little effect, because of rapid reversibility of inhibition, on muscle-type (alpha1beta1gammadelta) or alpha7 receptors. However, the inhibition of neuronal beta subunit-containing receptors was also decreased if any of the nonessential subunits alpha5, alpha6, or beta3 were coexpressed. This decrease in inhibition is shown to be associated with a single amino acid present in the second transmembrane domain of these subunits. Our data indicate great potential utility for TMPH to help relate the diverse central nervous system effects to specific nAChR subtypes.",

    "177": "PSV, AVPD and HR gradually increased during exercise. The increases in PSV and AVPD were linearly correlated with the increase in HR. The increases in PSV were significantly lower during exercise with beta-blockade than without beta-blockade (P<0.05). This was not observed in AVPD, as increments were not affected by beta-blockade.", 
    "178": "These data showing a relationship between HR and PSV, and a significantly lower PSV with beta-blockade at a given HR, suggest that PSV is influenced by HR and myocardial contractility, both of which are augmented by physical exercise-induced sympathetic stimulation.", 
    "179": "The possible role played by hypoxia and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the regulation of follicular angiogenesis was studied in a three-dimensional fibrin gel model. Granulosa cells from follicles >5mm were subjected to normoxia (19% O2), partial (5% O2) or total (1% O2) hypoxia and their culture media were collected and used to stimulate porcine Aortic Endothelial Cells (AOC) included in the fibrin matrix. A suspension of AOC on microcarrier beads was pipetted in a fibrinogen solution (1 mg/ml PBS) before the addition of 1250 IU thrombine (250 microl) to catalize the gel formation. Granulosa cell conditioned media were tested in the presence or absence of VEGF Trap R1R2 (150 ng/ml), a potent VEGF inhibitor, that had its efficacy tested by adding VEGF (100 ng/ml) to AOC culture. Endothelial cell proliferation was measured at 48, 96, 144, 192 h by means of Scion Image Beta. A significant (p < 0.01) increase of AOC proliferation at each time of measurement was induced by culture media from granulosa cells subjected to partial (except at the end of the first 48 h) and total hypoxia compared to control and normoxia conditions, and by VEGF. VEGF Trap significantly (p < 0.01) inhibited the stimulatory effect of media conditioned by granulosa cells cultured in hypoxic conditions. These data suggest that hypoxia stimulates angiogenic activity of granulosa cells possibly by means of VEGF which could represent the main effector in promoting endothelial cell proliferation.", 
    "180": "Glucocorticoids increase plasma glucose concentrations in neonatal calves, but not hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme mRNA levels and activities. Catecholamines, too, enhance plasma glucose levels and regulate hepatic glucose metabolism. We have measured hepatic mRNA levels of beta-adrenergic receptors and beta-adrenergic receptor binding in neonatal calves on day 5 of life. Calves were fed either colostrums (C) or an isoenergetic milk-based formula (F), and in each feeding group, half of the calves were treated with dexamethasone (DEXA; 30 microg/(kg body weightday)). Abundance of mRNA was highest (P < 0.01) for beta2-adrenergic receptors and was higher (P < 0.01) for beta1- than for beta3-adrenergic receptors. DEXA treatment decreased (P < 0.05) beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptor mRNA levels. Beta3-adrenergic receptor mRNA levels were higher (P < 0.05) in colostrum- than in formula-fed calves. Competitive binding revealed highest affinities for alprenolol, propranolol (both beta1- and beta2-antagonists), and ICI-188,551 (beta2-antagonist), which did not significantly differ from each other. Atenolol (beta1-antagonist) up to 10(-5) M did not displace (3H)-CGP-12177 from receptors. Competitive binding for adrenaline was best fitted by a two-receptor model. DEXA decreased (P < 0.05) (3H)-CGP-12177 binding capacities, whereas binding affinity of (3H)-CGP-12177 was not affected by DEXA or different feeding. Binding sites correlated positively with mRNA levels of beta2-adrenergic receptors (r = 0.56; P < 0.01). In conclusion, beta2-adrenergic receptors were the dominant subtype in the hepatic tissue. Feeding did not significantly affect beta2-adrenergic binding sites. However, DEXA decreased beta2-adrenergic binding sites and this was regulated at the transcriptional level.", 
    "181": "To analyze the relationship between sudden death and death from arrhythmia and multiple risk factors in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes in two years of follow-up in China.", 
    "182": "This study was a part of an international multicentre registry-Organization to Assess Strategies for Ischemic Syndromes (OASIS). The patients admitted to the hospital with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome were enrolled. No particular intervention was given for the treatment. All patients had been followed-up for two years. The patients' clinical characteristics, therapeutic regimes and major events during hospitalization and two years' follow-up period were recorded by filling in Case Report Forms according to the protocol offered by Canadian Cardiovascular Collaboration. Cox regression model was used to analyze the association with the most common causes of death and multiple factors recorded.", 
    "183": "From April 1999 to December 2001, 2294 cases were enrolled in 38 hospitals in China nationwide. Among them 2188 patients two years follow-up was accomplished. The mean age of the patients was (62.8+/-8.1) years. Male gender was dominant (62.3%). The clinical diagnosis at admission was unstable angina in 88.5% of the patients and non Q-wave myocardial infarction(MI) in the remaining 11.5%. The mortality was 7.6% with total deaths of 174 by the end of 24-month follow up. The most common cause of death was severe arrhythmias or sudden death (92 cases, 52.9%). More than 70 factors were analyzed by Cox regression model in order to determine which were the predominant factors of death. Major risk factors that predisposed to death were: number of episodes of MI during follow-up period, re-MI within 24 hours during hospitalization, heart failure during hospitalization, previous history of MI, recurrent angina pectoris during hospitalization, the duration of hospitalization, and patient age. Protective factors that reduced the chance of death were: the frequency of using nitrate, frequency of taking anti-platelet medicine or beta-blocker during follow-up period.", 
    "184": "In China, the most common cause of death in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes is severe arrhythmias or sudden death, and it is related with the severity of coronary artery disease and the age of patients in majority of cases. Some factors that influence survival are similar to those established by previous evidence based medicine."
