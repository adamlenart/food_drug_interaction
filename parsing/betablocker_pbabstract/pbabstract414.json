    "1": "The Dutch TIA Trial was a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, in which the secondary preventive effects of two doses of aspirin were compared in patients with a transient ischemic attack or nondisabling stroke. On the basis of clinical symptoms and computed tomography, qualifying events were classified as pertaining to the left carotid, right carotid, or vertebrobasilar circulation.", 
    "2": "In 2,993 patients the territory of the qualifying event was that of the left carotid in 1,281 (43%), the right carotid in 1,090 (36%), and the vertebrobasilar in 444 (15%); the territory was uncertain in 178 (6%). On follow-up (mean, 2.6 years), 184 of the 2,371 patients with a baseline event in the carotid circulation suffered a recurrent ischemic stroke (7.8%), as did 28 of the 444 patients in the vertebrobasilar group (6.3%); 117 of these 212 infarcts (55%; 95% confidence interval, 49-62) occurred in the same territory (108 in the ipsilateral carotid and nine in the vertebrobasilar territory) as the event at baseline, compared with 39% to be expected by chance alone (95% confidence interval, 32-45). In the carotid groups patients were significantly more likely to have a subsequent ischemic event in the same territory as at entry than patients in the vertebrobasilar group (relative risk, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.2). The average interval between the qualifying event and the subsequent stroke was significantly shorter (mean, 167 days; 95% confidence interval, 77-257) if the vascular territory was the same.", 
    "3": "These results suggest that single artery disease accounts for at most one half of the strokes on follow-up, relatively more often in the carotid territory, and that recurrent strokes from the same arterial lesion occur sooner than strokes associated with other lesions.", 
    "4": "Increased airway hyperresponsiveness is thought to be one of the phenomena underlying nocturnal airway obstruction in asthma. To investigate the mechanisms that influence and modulate this phenomenon, we compared circadian variations in airway responsiveness with AMP and propranolol with the circadian variation in airway responsiveness to methacholine. Inhalation provocation tests were performed at 16.00 and 04.00 h in 16 nonsmoking atopic asthmatic subjects (18 to 42 yr of age), prospectively assigned to Group 1 (mean circadian peak expiratory flow rate [PEFR] variation > or = 15%) and Group 2 (< 15%). The circadian change in airway responsiveness to AMP, in contrast to methacholine, was significantly related to the circadian PEFR-variation of the 16 subjects (r = 0.81, p < 0.001). In Group 1 (n = 7) geometric mean PC20 AMP decreased more than PC20 methacholine during the night (2.3 and 0.9 doubling concentrations respectively, p < 0.05), whereas no difference in baseline FEV1 was found at the same time points during the different study days. Geometric mean PC20 propranolol did not change during the night. Daytime PC20 propranolol and PC20 AMP, in contrast to PC20 methacholine, were significantly lower in Group 1 as compared with Group 2. Together, the results show a higher susceptibility to stimulation of \"indirect\" airway responsiveness in the subjects with increased circadian PEFR amplitude. This suggests that mast cell activation rather than primary changes in smooth muscle cell contraction may play a role in the development of nocturnal airway obstruction.", 
    "5": "The efficacy of intravenous metoprolol in preventing symptoms during a repeat tilt test was compared with the outcome of chronic oral treatment in 21 patients (14 female, 7 male), age 8 to 20 years (mean 13 +/- 3) with unexplained syncope (> or = 1 episode) and a positive response to tilt testing. A positive response was defined as the development of either syncope or presyncope. During the initial tilt test, a positive response occurred during baseline (14 patients) or isoproterenol (0.03 to 0.1 microgram/kg/min) infusion (7 patients) with a cardioinhibitory (1 patient), vasodepressor (5 patients) or mixed (15 patients) pattern. Metoprolol (0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg) was administered intravenously. During the repeat tilt test, response was negative in 18 patients, including 11 of 14 patients with a positive response in the baseline and 7 of 7 patients with a positive response during isoproterenol infusion. Metoprolol (0.8 to 2.8 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to 15 patients for an average of 10 months. Symptoms were absent (7 patients) or improved (2 patients); metoprolol was discontinued because of adverse effects (3 patients) or recurrence of symptoms (3 patients). In 7 of 12 patients with a negative response and 2 of 3 patients with a positive response after intravenous metoprolol, oral administration of metoprolol prevented or improved symptoms without adverse effects. Many young patients (60%) with recurrent syncope obtained symptomatic improvement from chronic oral metoprolol treatment without adverse effects; repeat tilt testing after intravenous metoprolol did not appear to offer any additional information than would have been obtained from a trial of chronic oral treatment.", 
    "6": "The impact of treating hypertension on coronary artery disease has been less than anticipated from epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that adverse effects on lipids of traditional diuretic or beta-blocker regimens may diminish the potential benefits of antihypertensive therapy. Patients with mild to moderate systemic hypertension and normal serum lipids (n = 191) were randomly assigned to doxazosin or atenolol. After dose titration to goal diastolic blood pressure of < or = 90 mm Hg, patients continued treatment for a further 24 weeks. The principal outcome measurement was overall coronary artery disease risk using the Framingham formula. Relative risk of coronary artery disease was reduced to 92.4% of baseline (p = 0.144) for evaluable patients taking atenolol (n = 71), and to 74.6% (p = 0.0001) for patients taking doxazosin (n = 51): atenolol versus doxazosin, p = 0.0074. In patients who met the strict Framingham criteria for age, total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, the relative risk of coronary artery disease for patients taking atenolol (n = 23) was reduced to 86.2% of baseline (p = 0.082), and to 67.4% (p = 0.0004) for patients taking doxazosin (n = 18): atenolol versus doxazosin, p = 0.049. Alpha blockade with doxazosin was more effective than beta blockade with atenolol in reducing the risk of coronary artery disease in hypertensive patients because of the beneficial effects of doxazosin on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Overall withdrawal rate was greater in the alpha-blocker group because of a lower response rate and more adverse events.", 
    "7": "Because conventional antiarrhythmic therapy is often ineffective in maintaining sinus rhythm or is associated with adverse side effects in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), there is a clinical need to test newer agents. One hundred patients with AF who had unsuccessful therapy with 1.9 +/- 1.0 type IA antiarrhythmic agents were randomized to receive either propafenone (n = 50) or sotalol (n = 50). Patients were stratified into 4 groups based on AF pattern (chronic vs paroxysmal) and left atrial size (large [> or = 4.5 cm] vs small [< 4.5]). The proportion of patients remaining in sinus rhythm on each agent was calculated for each group by the Kaplan-Meier method. For patients randomized to propafenone, 46 +/- 8%, 41 +/- 8% and 30 +/- 8% remained in sinus rhythm at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively, after cardioversion. A similar proportion of patients treated with sotalol remained in sinus rhythm at follow-up (49 +/- 7%, 46 +/- 8% and 37 +/- 8% at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively; p = NS). The proportion of patients remaining in sinus rhythm on propafenone and sotalol was not dependent on arrhythmia pattern or left atrial dimension. Except for constipation that occurred more frequently in patients treated with propafenone, adverse side effects were equally distributed between the 2 therapies. Two patients receiving sotalol died during follow-up. Propafenone and sotalol, 2 new antiarrhythmic agents, were found to be equally effective in maintaining sinus rhythm in 100 patients with recurrent AF. Response rates were not affected by arrhythmia pattern, left atrial size or unsuccessful prior drug therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "Double-masked study on 40 eyes (40 patients) of primary angle-closure glaucoma demonstrated that topical timolol and indomethacin prevented the IOP rise following combined argon and Nd:YAG laser iridectomy. A combination of the 2 drugs was especially effective in that the number of patients who would have an IOP increase over 1.33 kPa (1 kPa = 7.5 mmHg) above the baseline was reduced by 80%. The mechanism of IOP rise following iridectomy and its prevention were discussed.", 
    "9": "1. Exposure of trout red blood cells to beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline activates a cAMP-dependent Na(+)-H+ antiport, the movements of protons being compensated by a Cl(-)-OH- (or HCO3-) exchange mediated by band 3 protein. The absorption of water osmotically linked to sodium and chloride induces cell swelling. 2. In the presence of acetazolamide, anionic exchange is inhibited and activation of cationic exchange resulted in the first 2 min in a strong external acidification and a large internal alkalinization leading to a reversal of the transmembrane pH gradient. Then, for at least 1 h and despite the inhibition of Cl- entry, a net Na+ uptake occurred which was balanced by an equivalent K+ loss, with the result that cell volume and pH gradient remained unchanged. 3. In such conditions, the inactivation of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger by a beta-antagonist, propranolol, blocked Na+ entry while K+ continued to be lost. This volume-independent K+ efflux, which is thus independent of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger, was not accompanied by a Cl- efflux but was associated with large internal and external pH changes consistent with K(+)-H+ exchange. 4. The K+ loss and the related pH changes are inhibited by compounds which are known to inhibit the K(+)-anion co-transporter in trout red cells, i.e. 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (Dids) and niflumic acid.", 
    "10": "1. A weak electroneutral sodium channel blocker 6-chloro-3,5-diamino-pyrazine-2-carboxamide was used to perform noise analysis on isolated epithelium from Rana fuscigula to determine the cellular mechanism underlying autoregulation of Na+ channel densities in response to a reduction in the mucosal Na+ concentration. 2. The inherent transport rates of these tissues were generally lower than in other frog skins. The macroscopic sodium current, INa, averaged 10.71 microA/cm2 and was mainly determined by the number of open channels (N(o)) which averaged 21.6 million/cm2. The calculated mean channel open probability (beta') was 0.38, and corresponded very closely to values previously determined by patch clamp. 3. Reducing the mucosal Na+ from 110 to 10 mM caused large increases in the open channel density, which stabilized the Na+ transport rate. N(o) increased from a mean value of 26.6 to 64.3 million/cm2 within 2 min. 4. Autoregulatory changes were induced primarily by increasing beta' by about 60% and to a lesser extent by an increase in NT, the total number of open and closed channels. 5. We also examined the role of the cytoskeleton in the regulation of Na+ channel densities. Colchicine treatment, which disrupted microtubules, had no apparent effect on the ability of the tissues to autoregulate their Na+ channel densities. 6. The integrity of the microfilaments were essential for autoregulatory changes in N(o). After we had disrupted the microfilaments with cytochalasin B, we observed a marked reduction in the ability of the tissues to increase N(o). 7. The mean N(o) did not increase in response to a drop in mucosal Na+ despite the fact that beta' increased by 69%. We, therefore, assumed that cytochalasin B did not affect Na+ channels already present in the membrane but interfered with recruitment of new channels. Significantly, we did not observe any increase in NT. 8. In kidney and other tight epithelia, microfilaments are responsible for regulating the delivery of newly synthesized membrane proteins. We believe that our results with cytochalasin-treated tissues support the theory that autoregulatory changes in N(o) are also regulated by the recruitment of channels from a cytoplasmic pool.", 
    "11": "Noradrenaline stimulates the concomitant release of ovarian oxytocin and progesterone in cattle within a few minutes, but the mechanism of its action is unknown. Changes in alpha- and beta-receptors and blood pressure were considered as possible mechanisms of the noradrenaline effect. Heifers in group 1 (n = 4) were infused with noradrenaline (0.16 microgram kg-1 min-1) for 30 min into the aorta abdominalis (cranial to the origin of the ovarian artery) on day 10. On days 11 and 12 before noradrenaline, phentolamine (alpha-blocker; 30 micrograms kg-1 min-1) or propranolol (beta-blocker; 5 micrograms kg-1 min-1) were infused for 30 min. Four other heifers were infused with noradrenaline only as controls. Only propranolol inhibited the stimulatory effect of noradrenaline on the secretion of progesterone and oxytocin. In group 2, heifers (n = 4) were infused, making use of the latin square design, with vasoconstrictive (angiotensin; 0.042 microgram kg-1 min-1) or vasodilatory (xanthinol-theophylline nicotinate; 250 micrograms kg-1 min-1) drugs that do not act through the adrenoceptors. Noradrenaline (0.3 microgram kg-1 min-1) was given 1 h later as in group 1. Blood pressure changes were measured in the posterior aorta abdominalis and oxytocin and progesterone concentrations were determined in the blood samples collected from the jugular vein. Noradrenaline and angiotensin increased (P < 0.01), whereas xanthinol decreased (P < 0.01), blood pressure during their infusion. However, the rise of oxytocin and progesterone concentrations was observed only after noradrenaline infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "Diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disorders are both common disorders, and it could be anticipated that they coexist in many patients. Diltiazem (DZ) is widely used alone or in combination with propranolol (PROP) for the treatment of hypertension and ischemic heart disease. These drugs could interfere with carbohydrate metabolism and impair glucose tolerance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of oral administration of DZ, PROP (100 and 25 mg kg-1, respectively) and their combination on fasting serum glucose and insulin levels in normal and diabetic Wistar rats. Diabetes was induced by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of streptozotocin (60 mg kg-1). In normal animals, serum glucose was significantly increased after DZ, PROP and DZ/PROP treatment compared to the initial values. In diabetic rats, serum glucose was significantly increased after PROP and DZ/PROP treatments, while it was slightly increased after diltiazem treatment compared to the initial values. In normal animals, plasma cAMP is significantly decreased in all treatment groups compared to the control value, while in the plasma of diabetic rats, cAMP was significantly decreased after PROP and DZ/PROP treatments when compared to the control value. Serum potassium of normal rats decreased after the diltiazem and DZ/PROP treatments, and they tend to increase slightly after PROP treatment. Serum potassium of diabetic rats was increased significantly after PROP and DZ/PROP treatments compared to the initial values. Body weight is decreased significantly in all treatment groups in normal rats while this significant decrease was observed only after DZ/PROP treatment in diabetic rats. This investigation suggests that diltiazem alone has no worsening effects on the glycemic control in diabetic rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "1. Interaction between topical isoprenaline and timolol on intraocular pressure was studied in conscious rabbits through changes of the dose-response curves. 2. Both drugs caused a dose-dependent fall of intraocular pressure mainly by reducing the aqueous humour formation. 3. When combined, timolol increased the response to submaximal concentrations of isoprenaline as well as EC50 (from 2.06 x 10(-3) M to 3.63 x 10(-3) M) and slope (from 1.21 to 1.89), but peak response to isoprenaline remained unchanged. 4. Discordance between experimental and theoretical additive curves as well as an interaction index smaller than 1 show that the interaction between both drugs is synergistic.", 
    "14": "beta-Adrenergic receptor binding and adenylyl cyclase activity were examined in lymphoblast cell lines established from 12 patients with bipolar disorder and 10 unrelated healthy control subjects. No significant differences were found in [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding affinity or capacity or in isoprenaline-stimulated cAMP response. Incubation of lymphoblasts with isoprenaline (1 nM) for 24 h prior to assay reduced both receptor number and adenylyl cyclase activity. The extent of receptor down-regulation was significantly less in cells of bipolar disorder patients (20 +/- 5%) compared to controls (40 +/- 4%). Desensitization of adenylyl cyclase, however, was reduced to a similar degree in bipolar (65 +/- 14%) and control (68 +/- 20%) subjects. We conclude that basal beta-adrenergic receptor characteristics are not altered in bipolar disorder but that agonist down-regulation of receptor number may be less efficient than in control cells. The functional implications of this effect are discussed.", 
    "15": "Fast-flow perfusion and flash photolysis of caged compounds were used to study the activation kinetics of L-type calcium current (ICa) in frog cardiac myocytes. Rapid exposure to isoproterenol (Iso) for 1 s or approximately 1 min produced similar kinetics of increase in ICa with an initial lag period of approximately 3 s, followed by a monophasic rise in current with a half-time of approximately 20 s. Epinephrine, as well as caged Iso, produced increases with similar kinetics. The fact that ICa increased significantly even after short Iso applications suggests that agonist binding to the receptor is rapid and that the increase in ICa is independent of free agonist. To dissect the kinetic contributions of various steps in the cAMP-phosphorylation cascade, the kinetics of the responses to caged cAMP and caged GTP gamma S and fast perfusion of forskolin, acetylcholine, and propranolol were compared. The response to caged cAMP exhibited no lag period, but otherwise increased at a rate similar to that produced by Iso and reached a peak at approximately 40 s after flash photolysis. This suggests that the lag period itself is due to a step before cAMP accumulation, but that activation of protein kinase and phosphorylation of the calcium channel are relatively slow. A lag period was also observed when ICa was stimulated by flash photolysis of caged GTP gamma S and when adenylyl cyclase was activated directly by rapid perfusion with forskolin. The lag period observed with forskolin may be due to slow binding of forskolin. The lag period was not due to the time required for cAMP to reach a threshold concentration, because a similar lag was observed in response to Iso in cells having ICa previously stimulated submaximally by internal perfusion with a low concentration of cAMP. These results suggest that the lag period can be attributed to a step associated with activation of adenylyl cyclase and cAMP accumulation.", 
    "16": "1. The effects of guanethidine and tachykinins on nicotine- and electrical stimulation-induced cholinoceptor responses were studied in isolated urinary bladder from the guinea-pig. 2. Acetylcholine release and the contractile response stimulated by nicotine were partially reduced by a sympathetic nerve blocker, guanethidine. Neurokinin A (but not substance P methyl ester or senktide) enhanced both acetylcholine release and contraction by nicotine in the presence of guanethidine. 3. Frequency-contraction curves (1 to 50 Hz) for electrical field stimulation (EFS) were partially reduced by atropine (1 microM), and after desensitization to alpha,beta-methylene adenosine 5'-triphosphate, the atropine-resistant contraction to EFS was completely abolished. Guanethidine, the tachykinin antagonist [D-Arg1, D-Pro2, Trp7,9, Leu11]-substance P and application of neurokinin A or substance P did not change the contractile response to EFS. Preganglionic nerve stimulation (5 Hz and 20 Hz) also evoked a similar response to EFS and was not influenced at all by guanethidine or neurokinin A. 4. We conclude that the ability of nicotine to release acetylcholine is enhanced both by endogenous tachykinins (probably released from sympathetic nerves) and by exogenously applied tachykinins as a result of interaction with NK2 receptors in the urinary bladder.", 
    "17": "Thyroid hormone deficiency is associated with changes in the cardiovascular system. No one has reported the measures of both atrial and ventricular calcium channel density and function, in association with measures of negative and positive channel modulators, in hypothyroid hearts. Hormonally-induced modulation of calcium channels has clinical significance in the development and application of therapeutic agents in dysthyroid states. We thyroidectomized male rats and sham-operated euthyroid controls, in order to measure radioligand binding to ventricular and atrial membrane Ca2+ channels ([3H]-isradipine), beta-adrenoceptors ([125I]-iodocyanopindolol) and atrial muscarinic receptors ([3H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate) and related these data to contraction and heart rate responses to isoproterenol, carbachol and calcium. When data from hypothyroid tissues were compared to those of controls, the densities of calcium channels increased 50% in ventricles, but no differences were seen in atrial homogenates. In both atria and ventricles, beta-adrenoceptors decreased modestly with no change in affinity. Atrial muscarinic receptor density was also unchanged. Dose response curves of left atrial contractions showed: decreased sensitivity (increased EC50 value) but equal maximal responsiveness to extracellular calcium; an increased carbachol sensitivity (decreased EC50 value); and no significant difference in isoproterenol response. Comparisons of within-individual preparation ratioed EC50 values confirm the changed calcium and carbachol sensitivities. Heart-rate dose response curves displayed: increased maximal heart rate responsiveness to calcium associated with increased EC50 values; isoproterenol sensitivity was decreased nearly 3-fold. There was no significant difference in heart rate response to carbachol; however, ratioed values of carbachol and calcium EC50s were significantly different. These data are consistent with a tissue-level state of enhanced negative chronotropism and inotropism occurring in hypothyroid myocardia. We also confirm an earlier controversial finding of increased calcium channel density in ventricles from hypothyroid rats.", 
    "18": "Changes in the QRS complex during exercise may provide information with respect to ischaemic heart disease. The intention with present investigation was to shed light on mechanisms behind QRS changes and to study the possibly confounding effects of beta-blockade on such alterations with exercise. Placebo or propranolol respectively was infused in randomized and double-blinded order in seven young healthy men before a maximum exercise test. Advanced computerized vectorcardiography and impedance cardiography was recorded continuously together with blood pressures and blood samples. The Y-lead magnitude increased significantly with propranolol infusion (P < 0.05), but it tended to decrease in the Z-lead (P < 0.07). While the serum potassium concentrations increased (P < 0.0005), the spatial QRS magnitude tended to decrease irrespective of treatment (P < 0.07). These changes correlated with changes in QR-duration (adj r2 > 0.58). With exercise, the mean spatial QRS magnitude decreased with similar amounts irrespective of treatment. However, propranolol made the magnitude decrease earlier (P < 0.01). No effect of treatment was detected on the decrease in QRS-duration. Immediately after exercise, the QRS complex continued to change as during exercise in the placebo investigations, but did not with propranolol (P < 0.05). These different patterns were most obvious in the first half of the QRS complex in the Y-lead. It is concluded that acute beta-blockade modifies QRS alterations both during and after exercise in healthy subjects. This indicates that such drugs may have confounding effects in evaluations of the diagnostic value of QRS alterations.", 
    "19": "Fifty patients with mild or moderate hypertension were assessed for the influence on peripheral hemodynamics of 10 months of treatment with lisinopril (25 patients) or metoprolol (25 patients). Two-dimensional Doppler flowmetry was used for the evaluation. Responding patients (blood pressure < 150/90 mm Hg) were monitored for another 4 weeks after treatment withdrawal to determine whether changes in forearm hemodynamics, if any, persisted. Twenty-two patients from either group (88%) were considered to be responders. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients receiving lisinopril dropped by 6% and 15%, respectively (p < 0.001), in those receiving metoprolol the decrease was 5.9% and 14%, respectively (p < 0.001). Forearm hemodynamics was not significantly different before treatment and improved in patients receiving lisinopril, with increased compliance (p < 0.001) and lower vascular resistance (p < 0.001). No significant changes were observed with metoprolol. After withdrawal, blood pressure returned to baseline values in both groups. However, improvement in forearm hemodynamics persisted in the lisinopril group. Hemodynamics changes were statistically different on lisinopril versus metoprolol both after treatment and after withdrawal. Lisinopril, but not metoprolol, seems capable to induce regression of functional and/or structural changes of large arteries in patients with hypertension.", 
    "20": "In C6-2B rat glioma cells, agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation is potently inhibited after the stimulation of endogenous bradykinin receptors or stably transfected substance K receptors, coupled to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. In the present report, pharmacological tools were used to selectively stimulate either protein kinase C or Ca2+, the two final effectors activated upon phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, and their role in the inhibition of the C6-2B cell cAMP signaling pathway was investigated. Activation of protein kinase C by an acute treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or L-alpha-1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-3-glycerol did not reduce, but rather enhanced, the cAMP accumulation elicited by forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1]. This effect was antagonized by the protein kinase inhibitor H-7 and mimicked by the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. Thapsigargin, a selective microsomal Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor, evoked a sustained increase in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration, with an EC50 of 24.8 +/- 4.3 nM, and inhibited the cAMP accumulation induced by the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol with comparable potency (IC50 = 19.3 +/- 0.2 nM), strongly suggesting a causal relationship between the two phenomena. The inhibition by thapsigargin of isoproterenol- or forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was not affected by pertussis toxin or down-regulation or inhibition of protein kinase C. Dantrolene, a blocker of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, antagonized 1) the Ca2+ transient in response to thapsigargin and substance K and 2) the inhibitory effect of these compounds on isoproterenol- or forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. Moreover, sequestration of intracellular Ca2+ with the cell-permeable Ca2+ chelator ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester abolished the cAMP inhibition mediated by thapsigargin. Finally, isoproterenol- or forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in digitonin-permeabilized cells was not affected by either thapsigargin or substance K. These data provide compelling evidence that increases in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration without activation of protein kinase C suffice and are responsible for the inhibition of cAMP accumulation in C6-2B cells.", 
    "21": "Concentration-dependent positive chronotropic response to phenylephrine (Phe) mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptor in isolated normotensive and SHRsp rat right atria was determined under normal or depressed beat rate by stimulation of cholinergic M-receptor. The spontaneous beat rate was increased from 223 +/- 18 to 271 +/- 16 bpm by Phe 100 mumol.L-1 in the presence of propranolol 1 mumol.L-1. When the basal rate was lowered by stimulation of cholinergic M-receptor with carbachol, PE-induced increment of beat rate was enhanced to 101 +/- 23 bpm, accompanied by an increase of the force of contraction from 45 +/- 14% to 125 +/- 56% (vs control response). However, beta-adrenoceptor mediated positive chronotropic effect was attenuated in the presence of carbachol, and no positive inotropic effect was detected. PE-induced increase in beat rate in SHRsp (31 +/- 9 bpm) was lower than that in WKY (41 +/- 10 bpm). After pretreatment with carbachol, Phe caused increments in beat rate in SHRsp and WKY were 70 +/- 18 bpm and 114 +/- 17 bpm, respectively. It is suggested that in SHRsp, the function of cardiac alpha 1-adrenoceptor is lower than that in WKY.",

    "23": "The effect of noradrenaline (NA) on mucociliary activity in the rabbit maxillary sinus was investigated in vivo by injecting it at increasing dosages (10(-11) to 10(-4) mol/kg) into the maxillary artery, the mucociliary response being recorded photoelectrically. NA increased mucociliary activity at a dosage of 10(-5) mol/kg, the maximal increase being 16.1 +/- 2.6%. The NA-induced stimulation of mucociliary activity had a latency of 20 s, and the activity returned to base-line level within 3 min. Pretreatment with the alpha-antagonist phentolamine (0.2 and 1.0 mg/kg) or the cholinergic antagonist atropine (1 mg/kg) did not alter mucociliary response to NA. Blockade with the beta-antagonist propranolol did not significantly reduce the maximal response to NA, which was 16.1 +/- 2.6% before and 11.1 +/- 3.0% after pretreatment with propranolol (n = 7; p = 0.2). In contrast, pretreatment with the prostaglandin-synthesis inhibitor indomethacin reduced the response from 12.9 +/- 2.9% to 6.3 +/- 1.3% (n = 6; p < 0.05), suggesting that at high dosages NA stimulates mucociliary activity via the cyclo-oxygenase pathway.",

Pyridostigmine and arginine induced a similar potentiating effect on GHRH-induced GH rise (Peak, mean +/- SEM: 56.9 +/- 12.8 and 48.6 +/- 8.5 micrograms/L, respectively vs 12.3 +/- 1.6 micrograms/L; p < 0.05). Combination of GHRH with propranolol induced an increase of GH that was significant only with regard to peak (28.9 +/- 8.4 micrograms/L) but not to AUC. However, GH rises observed after GHRH combined with PD or ARG did not significantly differ from that recorded after coadministration of GHRH and PROP both for peak and AUC. Our results confirm that pyridostigmine and arginine have a striking potentiating effect on the GHRH-induced GH rise in children and show that the tests with GHRH + PD and GH + H + ARG are ore reliable than that with GHRH + PROP to explore the secretory capacity of somatotroph cells.", 
    "26": "A 65-year-old woman with stable atopic bronchial asthma received a prescription for timolol maleate eye drops (0.25% solution, one drop twice a day to both eyes) for glaucoma. On that evening, ten minutes after administration of the first application of timolol, the patient experienced wheeze and slight difficulty in breathing. Within the next ten minutes, her respiration became obviously asthmatic. Her symptoms progressed rapidly. When she arrived at our hospital, reduced respiratory sounds, cyanosis and disturbance of consciousness were observed. After treatment with aminophylline, hydrocortisone, epinephrine and oxygen inhalation, her symptoms completely recovered. In a provocation test, fifteen minutes after application of timolol, wheeze and dyspnea were induced following an increase in respiratory resistance. After the asthma attack, transient hypoxemia, bradycardia and decrease in blood pressure were also observed.", 
    "27": "The effect of ovarian steroids on sedative effects of diphenhydramine (D), a histamine H1 receptor blocker, was determined. Seventy-five female Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: Group 1 (N = 54) was ovariectomized, group 2 (N = 7) was sham-operated, and group 3 (N = 14) was intact. The ovariectomized rats were then subdivided into 4 groups. Two groups received peanut oil 54 and 6 h before treatment with saline solution (group OS) or 20 mg/kg D (group OD). The other two groups received 50 micrograms/kg 17-beta-estradiol and 2 mg/kg progesterone, respectively, 54 and 6h before treatment with saline solution (group OHS) or 20 mg/kg D (group OHD). The sham-operated animals were treated as the OS group. Intact animals were injected with saline (group IS) or 20 mg/kg D (group ID) on the day of estrus, as determined by vaginal smears taken in the morning before the behavioral observations. Rats were observed for 6 min in the open field during the dark period of the cycle, 15 min after the administration of saline or D. There was a similar decrease in locomotion and rearing frequencies in OHS vs OHD and IS vs ID groups. Nevertheless, a lack of D sedative effect was observed in OD rats (locomotion and rearing frequencies, 56.0 +/- 3.3 vs 46.1 +/- 3.8 and 15.5 +/- 1.6 vs 15.2 +/- 1.6., for OS and OD groups, respectively). The results suggest that the sedative effect of diphenhydramine depends on the presence of ovarian steroids.", 
    "28": "Immunoenhancing in vivo effects of beta-adrenergic blockers have been previously ascribed to a reduced beta-receptor-mediated immunosuppression. In the present study using a whole blood stimulation assay, the effects of a five-day treatment with the purified (R)- or (S)-isomer of propranolol (3 x 40 mg/day) on the polyclonal in vitro responsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of normothyroid and hyperthyroid persons were assessed. It is shown that both isomers likewise exhibit a significant enhancing effect on the proliferative response of PBL to T and B cell mitogens, which strongly argues for nonspecific effects of propranolol to be responsible rather than a specific beta-adrenergic receptor blockade.",

    "30": "The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) Study is a prospective, randomized, multicenter study which will be conducted in some 20 countries world-wide. Two major issues will be investigated: i) What is the optimal target diastolic blood pressure during antihypertensive treatment with regard to the reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality? In order to address this question patients will be randomized to three different therapeutic goals: a diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mmHg, < or = 85 mmHg or < or = 80 mmHg; ii) The second aim is to evaluate the effect of a low dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) 75 mg o.d. in comparison with placebo on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The first aim will be investigated in accordance with the PROBE design (Prospective Randomized Open Blinded Endpoint evaluation), whereas the evaluation of aspirin versus placebo will be conducted under double blind conditions. It is estimated that 1,100 clinical events will be needed in order to answer the question regarding the relationship between target diastolic blood pressure and major cardiovascular events. The collection of these events will require the enrollment of at least 18,000 hypertensive men and women aged 50-80 years to be followed for 2.5 years (about 40,000 patient years). All patients will be given felodipine 5 mg o.d. as basic antihypertensive treatment with the addition of a beta-blocker or an ACE-inhibitor in a second step, with further predetermined increments in dosage as required in order to obtain the randomized therapeutic goal.",

The values of both Kd and Bmax of [3H] dihydroalprenolol binding in the cerebral cortical membranes of old-aged (12 month old) SAM-P/1 were not significantly different compared with those of young (2 month old) SAM-P/1. 2. The values of Ki of metoprolol in the young and old aged SAM were 119 +/- 39.5 nM and 157 +/- 55 nM, respectively. 3. The values of beta 1/beta 2 ratio of the young and old aged SAM were 1.67 +/- 0.15 and 1.64 +/- 0.13, respectively. 4. These results suggest that there were no significant changes of binding characteristics of beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors during aging in the cerebral cortex of SAM.",

Six beta-blockers, propranolol, metoprolol, timolol, pindolol, nadolol and atenolol, were used as the model permeants. The maximum flux values (observed flux/thermodynamic activity, Jmax) of drugs through the membrane coated with the model lipid mixtures and two keratinized membranes, rat skin and hamster cheek pouch, were determined in vitro using a Franz-type diffusion cell. Further, drug partition coefficients to the multilamellar liposomes prepared by the model lipid mixtures were determined. The Jmax values obtained in the model lipid-coated membrane, in the intact rat skin and in the intact hamster cheek pouch mucosa, bore a linear relationship to each other. These results suggest that the model lipid-coated membrane is a useful tool for the prediction of the drug permeability through the keratinized membrane in the in vitro system. The Jmax values also correlated with drug partition to the model lipid liposomes, suggesting the validity of the use of the model lipid mixtures as the substitutes for the intercellular lipids of the stratum corneum.",

The use of nitrates in acute angina and in prophylaxis of chronic ischemia as well as their adverse effects are also discussed. Nitrates efficacy is compared against beta-blockers and calcium antagonists. In conclusion, nitrates have a moderate efficacy and should be used in association with other anti-ischemic drugs, in eccentrical therapeutical schemes with a free interval between doses.", 
    "35": "Species differences in the distribution of beta-adrenergic receptors in the hippocampal and retrohippocampal regions of rats and guinea pigs were examined using in vitro autoradiographic techniques. beta 1-receptors were found in the hippocampal area CA1 of both species, although guinea pigs had significantly lower receptor densities in comparison to rats. In guinea pigs, beta 2-adrenergic receptors were predominant in hippocampal area CA1. Hippocampal area CA3 had very low levels of beta 1- and beta 2-receptors in both species. The retrohippocampal area was also found to have a distinct topographic distribution of beta-receptors. In rats, the subiculum and parasubiculum (layers II-III) were heavily labeled for beta 1-receptors; in contrast, guinea pigs had few receptors in these regions. beta 2-receptors were particularly prominent in the parasubicular region in rats. The entorhinal cortex laminae was found to contain beta-receptors in both rats and guinea pigs. Immunohistochemical techniques were used to compare the pattern of catecholaminergic innervation with the receptor distribution within each hippocampal subregion. Despite the general lack of beta-receptors in area CA3, abundant catecholamine immunoreactive fibers were observed in CA3 of rat and guinea pig hippocampus. Significant species differences were found in the distribution of hippocampal beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes, and moreover, in both species the distribution of beta-adrenergic receptors did not coincide with the pattern of hippocampal adrenergic innervation.",

The response to salbutamol were inhibited only by high concentrations of BL 343 Ac. The pA2 value and slope of the Schild plot, which was less than unity, suggest that BL 343 Ac has no competitive beta 2-adrenolytic properties, and thus appears to be a cardioselective beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking agent.",

An excellent neonatal outcome occurred.", 
    "38": "Migraine in itself is a potential cause of cerebral infarct in young adults. However the mechanism of migrainous ictus is open to discussion. Some drugs (oral anticonceptives, ergotaminics) could favor its appearance. Three cases has described in the medical literature of migraine patients in whom betablockers administration has been related with onset of an ischemic ictus. We present two new cases of this association. Nonselective betablockers provoke an increase in platelet activity by stimulation of platelet alpha-2 receptors; this together with their vasoconstrictor effect could favor the apparition of cerebral infarction in patients with migraine. We suggest, following other authors, to include non selective betablockers in the group of drugs which have to be carefully managed in the patients with migraine, especially in those with the classical type (migraine with aura) in whom an initial vasoconstriction has been suggested.", 
    "39": "We have studied the in-vitro effect of centpropazine on cerebral cortical noradrenergic receptors measured as the accumulation of second messengers, cyclic AMP and inositol phosphate, stimulated by noradrenaline, and the binding to alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors. Centpropazine inhibited inositol phosphate, but not the cyclic AMP accumulation in the cerebral cortical slices of the rat. It moderately antagonized the specific binding of [3H]prazosin, but did not affect the specific binding of the beta-adrenoceptor ligand, [3H]CGP 12177, to cerebral cortical membranes.", 
    "40": "The stereoselectivity of binding of four beta-blockers, pindolol, propranolol, oxprenolol and acebutolol, to purified rat alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) was examined using equilibrium dialysis. Pindolol and propranolol were bound stereoselectively to AAG, whereas binding of oxprenolol was non-stereospecific. Neither of the enantiomers of acebutolol bound to either AAG or any other plasma protein. The affinity of (+)-pindolol was 25 times that of (-)-pindolol, as determined in a single enantiomer experiment. Both enantiomers of propranolol demonstrated two classes of binding sites in AAG, the total binding for the high affinity site for (+)-propranolol being double that of (-)-propranolol, which could explain the higher binding of the (+)-enantiomer in racemate experiments. These results further showed that stereoselective binding to a rat AAG is not a property common to all beta-blockers.", 
    "41": "To support the development of a suitable transdermal dosage form for beta-blockers, in-vitro, skin permeation studies of nine beta-blockers were conducted at 37 degrees C across the excised abdominal skin of hairless mouse mounted on the receptor compartment of a two-chambered Valia-Chien glass diffusion cell. The drugs varied in lipophilicity, whereas pKa values were comparable. Permeability coefficients were calculated from the steady-state flux values. Agreement was found between the permeability coefficient and the drug lipophilicity, expressed as the octanol-buffer distribution coefficient.", 
    "42": "1. Effects of bopindolol, a beta adrenoceptor antagonist with partial agonist activity, on the diastolic blood pressure and heart rate of pithed rats were compared with those of pindolol. 2. Both bopindolol and pindolol reduced the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in pithed rats. Bopindolol (3.0 mg/kg) and pindolol (1.0 mg/kg) produced similar decreases in DBP of about 8 mmHg; thus pindolol had a 3-fold higher hypotensive potency when compared with bopindolol. 3. Both drugs also produced a dose-dependent decrease in heart rate. 4. Propranolol (5 mg/kg) had no antagonistic effect on the decrease in DBP produced by either bopindolol or pindolol. 5. These results suggest that both bopindolol and pindolol reduce DBP and heart rate in pithed rats through some mechanism independent of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "43": "In an effort to investigate the metabolic basis of previously reported pharmacokinetic interactions between beta-adrenergic antagonists and calcium channel blockers, the effects of verapamil on the oxidative metabolism of metoprolol were studied in microsomes isolated from four human livers. Deuterium-labeled pseudoracemic metoprolol was used to characterize the substrate stereoselectivity of this metabolic interaction. Biphasic kinetics were observed for both the alpha-hydroxylation and O-demethylation of metoprolol, suggesting that multiple P-450 enzymes with differing KMs are involved in the formation of these oxidative metabolites. alpha-Hydroxylation showed a slight preference for S-(-)-metoprolol, and it was largely mediated by a high-affinity enzyme over a wide range of substrate concentrations. The high-affinity component of the O-demethylation reaction exhibited significant selectivity for the R-(+)-enantiomer. The opposite enantioselectivity was observed for the low-affinity component of O-demethylation. Racemic verapamil inhibited both the alpha-hydroxylation and the O-demethylation of metoprolol. The kinetics of inhibition were consistent with competitive effects of verapamil on the high-affinity components of both oxidative pathways, which previously had been suggested to be mediated by CYP2D6. Potent inhibition of the low-affinity component of O-demethylation was also observed. The inhibitory effect of verapamil on the alpha-hydroxylation of metoprolol was not enantioselective. On the other hand, verapamil preferentially inhibited the O-demethylation of R-(+)-metoprolol compared with S-(-)-metoprolol at low substrate concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "Labetalol causes significant maternal and fetal metabolic effects in pregnant sheep (Yeleswaram et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 262, 683-691 (1992)). This study was undertaken to investigate the contribution of skeletal muscles in the development of metabolic acidosis induced by labetalol and to explore the involvement of active metabolite(s) using conscious, chronically instrumented adult nonpregnant ewes. Following a 100 mg iv bolus, the disposition of labetalol was similar to that observed in pregnant sheep. The effects of labetalol included hypotension, reflex tachycardia, a significant increase in femoral blood flow, hyperglycemia, lactic acidosis, and increased hind limb oxygen consumption. The arteriovenous flux of labetalol, glucose, lactate, and oxygen across the hindlimb was calculated using the Fick principle. The net output of lactate from the hindquarter over 12 hr following drug administration was calculated to be 6.25 +/- 1.35 g (0.07 +/- 0.015 mol). Glucuronidation, sulfation, and oxidative metabolism of labetalol were studied using urine and bile samples. The cumulative urinary excretion of labetalol as unchanged drug, glucuronide and sulfate was found to be 1.61 +/- 0.3, 11.46 +/- 2.83, and 1.47 +/- 0.74% of the dose, respectively. Using GC-mass selective detection, the presence of 3-amino-1-phenylbutane (3-APB), a close congener of amphetamine, in urine and bile samples was established. The cumulative excretion of 3-APB in urine represents 0.044 +/- 0.016% of the dose. Pharmacokinetic analysis shows the apparent elimination half-life of the metabolite to be 13.5 +/- 3.8 min. Conjugates of 3-APB were also found in the bile and urine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "Carvedilol shows a highly enantioselective first-pass extraction after therapeutic p.o. doses with preferential extraction of the S-enantiomer. To investigate, whether the enantioselective first-pass metabolism is saturable, male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered increasing single doses of R/S-carvedilol (p.o., 5-30 mg/kg; i.v., 5 and 10 mg/kg), and the individual stereopharmacokinetics were studied. Like in humans the plasma concentrations of R-carvedilol exceeded always those of S-carvedilol. As expected, a dose-dependent reduction in oral clearance was observed, while the total clearance after the i.v. doses was constant. Beyond 20 mg/kg an increased plasma half-life was found for both enantiomers, which is due to a reduced plasma clearance.", 
    "46": "The relationship between medication and incontinence was studied retrospectively in 128 elderly patients enrolled in an incontinence study. Patients were taking up to 18 non-topical medications but most of these were unlikely to have a significant urological effect. Nevertheless, 62% of patients were receiving, for other medical problems, up to 4 drugs which could potentially affect the lower urinary tract. These were classified by their mode of action. The most common types of urologically active medication, apart from diuretics, were calcium channel blockers, used by 21% of patients, and tricyclic antidepressants, used by 12%. The urodynamic findings in patients on different types of medication were compared. Patients with urodynamically proven urge incontinence who were on calcium channel blockers had significantly less urine loss than those not on the drug. Tricyclic antidepressants have been used in the treatment of urge incontinence; in this study urine loss was less severe among those receiving tricyclics, although the differences were not significant. A few patients on beta-blockers apparently had more severe urge incontinence. Drugs prescribed to the elderly for non-urological medical problems can affect the lower urinary tract and may have some effect, either beneficial or adverse, on incontinence.", 
    "47": "Using guinea-pig lung membranes and cloned human beta 2-receptor adrenergic receptors the effects of whole serum, plasma, purified immunoglobulins and cellular activation products on beta 2-adrenergic receptor ligand binding and function were investigated. Sera from 24 non-asthmatic subjects and 115 asthmatics in different clinical categories were studied. There were no significant differences between antagonist ([125I] cyanopindolol) inhibition mediated by serum, plasma or by purified IgG when the asthmatics were compared with non-asthmatics. There was also no inhibition of 10(-6) M isoproterenol stimulated cAMP release from L cells expressing human beta 2-adrenergic receptors, by plasma, DEAE purified IgG fractions from asthmatics and non-asthmatics, or by products of activated platelets or lymphocytes. Since we have no evidence that immunoglobulins from asthmatic subjects exert functional inhibition of human beta 2-adrenergic receptors we conclude that autoantibodies to the beta 2-adrenergic receptors do not play an important functional role in the pathophysiology of asthma.", 
    "48": "This study was performed to confirm the usefulness of 12 mg nipradilol, a beta-blocker with a vasodilator action similar to that of nitrate-type drugs, in the treatment of effort angina pectoris. It also discusses the mechanism of the action of this drug when using the exercise test heart rate-ST displacement analysis. The symptom threshold multistage graded exercise test was performed using nine patients with chronic stabilized effort angina pectoris after an observation period and an 8-week administration period and HR-ST analysis was performed simultaneously. The number of anginal attacks significantly decreased from the 2nd week, and the heart rate at rest decreased significantly in the prone position although blood pressure did not change. The maximum oxygen intake increased markedly from 13.7 +/- 1.1 ml/kg/min to 19.3 +/- 2.5 ml/kg/min, and the maximum ST decrease improved significantly from 1.72 +/- 0.45 mm to 1.17 +/- 0.19mm. In HR-ST analysis, delta ST/delta HR and delta ST/delta DP tended to improve slightly. Since monotherapy with a beta-blocker causes significant increase in delta ST/delta HR and delta ST/delta DP, it was assumed that a vasodilator action in addition to a beta-blocker action is involved in the improvement of maximum ST decrease brought about by nipradilol.",

    "50": "1. Noradrenaline and isoprenaline were infused subcutaneously in rats by use of Alzet osmotic minipumps. The effects of catecholamine infusion on ventricular alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor density and also the responses of isolated cardiac tissues were compared with saline infusion. 2. Noradrenaline (1 mg kg-1) or isoprenaline (40 micrograms kg-1) infused for 3 days resulted in a desensitization of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses of isolated left atria and papillary muscles. Concentration-response curves to isoprenaline were shifted to the right in left atria whilst maximum responses were reduced in papillary muscles. Right atrial rate responses were not affected by infusions of catecholamines. 3. Infusions of either noradrenaline or isoprenaline resulted in a supersensitivity of alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated responses in isolated papillary muscles with leftward displacements of concentration-response curves to phenylephrine. 4. The density of both ventricular [3H]-dihydroalprenolol and [3H]-prazosin binding sites was reduced following noradrenaline infusion. Isoprenaline infusion reduced only the density of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol binding sites. 5. Noradrenaline infusion therefore 'down-regulates' both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in the rat heart but at the same time ventricular alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated responses are enhanced. Isoprenaline similarly enhances responses to phenylephrine and possible mechanisms for this phenomenon are discussed.", 
    "51": "1. Isoprenaline (10(-9)-10(-5) M) relaxed rat isolated mesenteric resistance arteries pre-contracted with K+ (30-60 mM) (p EC50 (M) 8.03 +/- 0.40; maximum relaxation 66.79 +/- 2.43%, n = 7). This relaxation was partially attenuated by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10(-4) M). 2. The beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, salbutamol (10(-9)-10(-5) M), produced a modest maximum relaxation (35.93 +/- 2.93%), which was not sensitive to L-NAME. 3. The beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, dobutamine (10(-9)-10(-5) M), relaxed arteries precontracted with K+. This relaxation was abolished by L-NAME (10(-4) M) and also by propranolol (10(-6) M), but not affected by D-NAME (10(-4) M). The inhibition by L-NAME was partially reversed by L-arginine (10(-3) M). Removal of the endothelium severely attenuated relaxation to dobutamine. 4. Contractile responses to depolarizing K+ solutions were enhanced by the addition of L-NAME, and also by removal of the endothelium. 5. The above findings demonstrate that beta 1-adrenoceptor causes relaxation via NO release from the endothelium of rat mesenteric resistance arteries. In addition, contraction to K+ is modified by release of NO from the endothelium, possibly in response to tension development.", 
    "52": "During 1991 and 1992, three major interventional trials were published that dealt with the value of antihypertensive treatment in the elderly. The three studies were the American Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP), the Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension (STOP-Hypertension), and the British Medical Research Council (MRC) Trial of Treatment of Hypertension in Older Adults. The three trials all compared active antihypertensive treatment, mainly diuretics or beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, or the two in combination, with placebo. Two of the trials were double-blind (SHEP and STOP) whereas the MRC trial was single-blind. All three were multicentered, prospective, and included randomization. One of the trials (SHEP) was specifically designed to evaluate antihypertensive treatment in patients with isolated systolic hypertension. The SHEP, STOP, and MRC trials all showed that treatment of hypertension in the elderly reduces the risk of stroke and cardiovascular events. In one of the trials, total mortality was also positively affected. Thus, in the STOP-Hypertension trial, which included the oldest patients with the most severe hypertension, total mortality was reduced by 43%. On the basis of these trials, it is apparent that antihypertensive treatment with low-dose thiazides or beta-blockers, or the two in combination, can produce highly beneficial results in elderly patients, including a reduction in the incidence of stroke and other cardiovascular events as well as in total mortality. Furthermore, special analyses indicate that the cost:benefit aspects of such treatment is at least as positive as in young and middle-aged hypertensive patients.",

The essential thesis is that adrenergic control of lipid metabolism is responsible for the effect on lipids and lipoproteins of antihypertensive agents that block adrenergic receptors. Agonists and antagonists show the opposite action on lipoprotein lipase, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and LDL-cholesterol uptake by LDL receptors in a manner that might explain the findings of increases in triglycerides and LDL cholesterol with decreases in HDL cholesterol in patients receiving beta blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and the reverse in patients on treatment with alpha adrenergic receptor blockers.",

    "61": "The existence of a beta 3-adrenoceptor (in addition to classical beta 1- and beta 2-), its involvement in the control of lipolysis and its recruitment by catecholamines were investigated in dog adipose tissue. Isoproterenol, norepinephrine, and the beta 2-selective agonist procaterol fully activated lipolysis in adipocytes (order of potency: isoproterenol > norepinephrine = procaterol). beta 3-Adrenergic agonists stimulated lipolysis with the order of potency: BRL 37344 > CGP 12177 > SR 58611A. Propranolol and bupranolol (nonselective beta-antagonists) antagonized, with a low potency, the effect of BRL 37344, whereas the beta 1-antagonist CGP 20712A and the beta 2-antagonist ICI 118551 were without action. CGP 20712A inhibited the effect of lower concentrations of agonists (0.05 microM isoproterenol, 0.1 microM norepinephrine and 0.1 microM procaterol) with an inhibitory constant (mean Ki) of 0.0075, 0.032 and > 10 microM, respectively. Mean Ki values for the beta 2-antagonist ICI 118551 were 1.744, 1.243, and 0.019 microM. This result indicates that low concentrations of isoproterenol and norepinephrine stimulate lipolysis mainly via beta 1-adrenoceptors in dog fat cells. Inversely, the lipolytic effect of higher concentrations of agonists i.e., 1 microM isoproterenol and catecholamines, was weakly antagonized by CGP 20712A or ICI 118551 while the nonselective beta-antagonists bupranolol and propranolol suppressed the effects with the order of potency expected for a beta 3-adrenoceptor: bupranolol > propranolol. These data indicate 1) the presence of a functional beta 3-adrenoceptor that coexists with beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in dog fat cells; 2) a separation of the differential potencies of physiological amines in the activation of lipolysis through beta 1-, beta 2-, and beta 3-adrenoceptors; the lipolytic response initiated at low concentrations (submicromolar range) of norepinephrine is primarily mediated by the beta 1-adrenoceptor subtype; and 3) an activation of the beta 3-adrenoceptor that occurs at higher concentrations of catecholamines.",

HR and rate-pressure product (RPP) reserves were calculated as the differences between maximal values observed during a symptom-limited maximal bicycle exercise test and basal values. Basal values were either pre-test resting values or mean values from night-time registrations between 0100h and 0500h. Night-time values of basal HR and RPP were 7.7 and 18.7% lower respectively as compared to pre-test resting values. The myocardial energy demands of various job activities were calculated as the percentage use of the reserves. This resulted in lower MOD estimations when pre-test values were used as compared to night-time values. These differences were larger for the estimation of MOD of light physical work (mean difference 25%) than for heavy physical work (mean difference 12%). The estimations of MOD using HR reserve or RPP reserve were very similar. In patients who performed the same job activities no correlation was found between MOD and left ventricle ejection fraction. We believe these data provide useful information about the functional capacity of AMI patients. They also emphasise the great importance that has to be attached to the definition of basal values.", 
    "64": "The Skaraborg Hypertension Project was undertaken in 1977-1981, and 1428 male and 1812 female hypertensives aged 40-69 years were involved at hypertension out-patient clinics in primary health care. Their long-term risk of acute myocardial infarction during a follow-up of 8.3 years was compared to that of age- and sex-matched controls drawn from the census register at the beginning of surveillance and to normotensive untreated controls identified in a population survey in 1977. Relative risks (with a 95% confidence interval) for acute myocardial infarction morbidity compared to the population was 0.99 (0.78, 1.25) in men and 1.36 (0.95, 1.94) in women. Corresponding figures for acute myocardial infarction mortality were 0.97 (0.68, 1.38) and 1.15 (0.67, 1.99). With normotensive controls used as reference and adjusting for smoking habits and body mass index, the relative risks for acute myocardial infarction morbidity were 1.48 (1.12, 1.98) in men and 2.34 (1.43, 3.85) in women, and for acute myocardial infarction mortality 1.66 (1.07, 2.57) and 1.71 (0.84, 3.48), respectively. Treated hypertension is a weak risk factor for acute myocardial infarction in unselected hypertensive patients.", 
    "65": "Uniformity of myocardial contraction has been put forward as an important regulatory mechanism of myocardial contraction, and we have previously demonstrated reduced uniformity of local myocardial contraction in the midwall of left ventricles during preload reduction combined with increased inotropy. The aim of the present study was to explore the isolated inotropic influence on uniformity of contraction, keeping loading conditions constant. Segment performance was measured by implanted piezo-electric crystals in ten open-chest, anaesthetized cats. One crystal pair, circumferential segment, aligned with midwall and epicardial fibres, whereas another perpendicular segment, longitudinal, ran close to endocardial fibre direction. Maximal systolic shortening of longitudinal segments remained unchanged following inotropic interventions, isoprenaline and timolol, whereas circumferential segments revealed reduced performance with timolol (8.4 +/- 1.0% compared with 14.0 +/- 1.3% during control; P < 0.001). In the control state the longitudinal-to-circumferential ratio (LONG/CIRC) a quantitative measure of uniformity, was 0.32 +/- 0.08. No change in uniformity occurred during isoprenaline infusion (0.32 +/- 0.11) but during beta-adrenergic blockade with timolol a clearly higher LONG/CIRC ratio was observed (0.56 +/- 0.06, P < 0.005). Myocardial tissue blood flow measurement by radioactive microspheres showed a shift in transmural distribution with interventions so that subepicardial blood flow was markedly reduced during beta-adrenergic blockade. The direction of subepicardial fibres approximates our circumferential segments. Thus, there may well exist a relationship between segmental shortening and perfusion. In conclusion, circumferential segments were most influenced by changes in inotropy in contrast to previous observations where pronounced changes in longitudinal segments with loading occur. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that reduced inotropy with timolol helped uniform local contraction as estimated by the increased LONG/CIRC ratio, a transition that could improve contraction efficacy.", 
    "66": "We studied the effect of various kinds of beta-adrenergic blockers on oxotremorine-, harmaline- and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-induced tremors in mice. To investigate what property of beta-blockers plays the main role in suppressing tremor, we employed five beta-blockers (propranolol, atenolol, butoxamine, pindolol, and arotinolol). All drugs suppressed oxotremorine-induced tremors but none reduced harmaline-induced tremors. Even though TRH-induced tremors were decreased significantly only by propranolol and high doses of arotinolol, all drugs had a tendency to reduce the tremor. We concluded that neuropharmacological mechanisms underlying to harmaline-induced tremors were different from those of TRH- and oxotremorine-induced tremors and that features of beta-blockers (beta 1- or beta 2-selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and membrane stabilizing activity) did not primarily contribute to the suppression of tremors.", 
    "67": "The present study was undertaken to evaluate the behavior of the rat 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1B receptor stably expressed in a Y-1 cell line, using both radioligand binding ([125I]iodocyanopindolol) and functional assays (inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP release). The measured EC50 values for agonists were lower than expected from the measured Ki values (e.g., 5-HT, EC50 = 0.49 +/- 0.043, nine experiments; Ki = 5.3 +/- 0.82, four experiments). Furthermore, beta-adrenergic antagonists such as propranolol and pindolol, which have been reported to be partial agonists or antagonists at the 5-HT1B receptors in other systems, were found to be full agonists. To investigate the relationship between receptor occupancy and inhibition of cAMP release (and hence the degree of receptor reserve), we used the irreversible receptor antagonist N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ). EEDQ treatment shifted the dose-response curve for 5-HT to the right by 6-7-fold, accompanied by a reduction (30-50%) in maximal response. Analysis of the data by the method of Furchgott revealed a very steep hyperbolic relationship between receptor occupancy and response for 5-HT, with 92 +/- 1.4% (three experiments) receptor reserve at the 50% maximal response level. In contrast to its effect on 5-HT, EEDQ treatment did not significantly shift the dose-response curves for pindolol; rather, only the maximal responses were reduced and a linear relationship was found between receptor occupancy and response for this compound. According to classical receptor theory these data indicate that pindolol is a partial agonist, relative to 5-HT, but because of the high density of 5-HT1B receptors in this system the difference between the intrinsic activities of the two drugs is masked. Therefore, one has to be cautious when interpreting functional data in transfected systems that often display large receptor reserve.", 
    "68": "The rate of adenylate cyclase activation via agonist-bound receptors in intact cells can be partly dependent on the rate of turnover of occupancy by agonist with respect to individual receptors. For instance, low occupancy of the full complement of receptors by epinephrine in intact S49 cells has been shown to promote a rate of activation that is substantially greater than that for high occupancy of a small number of receptors for which the concentration of epinephrine-bound receptors is the same. According to the encounter coupling model, a partial dependence of the relationship between receptor occupancy and adenylate cyclase activity on the agonist binding frequency can in principle be explained by episodic interactions of finite duration (encounters) between individual pairs of receptor and GTP-binding protein. The mean lifetime of the agonist-receptor complex and the frequency of binding relative to the mean duration of such encounters dictate whether there is variation of the state of the receptor during an encounter and the extent to which the overall rate of GTP-binding protein activation can be dependent on binding frequency. We present here a quantitative analysis of agonist concentration versus cyclase response curves in terms of the encounter coupling model that explicitly includes agonist binding frequency, the encounter frequency, and the encounter duration as parameters. The essential result is that the model is quantitatively consistent with concentration versus response curves for receptor-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase in S49 cells. It is also shown that the model is consistent with data on the differential effects of antagonists to inhibit agonist-stimulated cyclase activation in a manner that is dependent on the antagonist binding frequency.", 
    "69": "The effect of amosulalol, a combined alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent, on changes in myocardial energy and carbohydrate metabolism during ischemia was studied. Ischemia was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery for 3 or 30 min during open-chest surgery in anesthetized dogs. The myocardial energy stores were depleted, and the levels of glycolytic intermediates were altered by 3 and 30 min of ischemia, indicating that anaerobic myocardial metabolism had occurred. Amosulalol (0.3 or 1 mg.kg-1) was injected intravenously 5 min before ischemia. Pretreatment with amosulalol, particularly at a dose of 0.3 mg.kg-1, reduced the myocardial energy depletion and the alteration of carbohydrate metabolism induced by ischemia. This result indicates that amosulalol can reduce ischemic influences on the myocardium.",

Early and late mortality after acute myocardial infarction is higher among diabetic patients. However, the effectiveness of newer treatments on diabetic patients with coronary artery disease has received little attention. This article reviews the effect of beta blockers and thrombolysis in diabetic patients after acute myocardial infarction and compares early and late results of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in diabetic patients with those in the nondiabetic population.", 
    "71": "The occurrence of ischemic episodes during daily activity has been reported to exhibit a bimodal circadian distribution, yet its relation to the ischemic threshold (heart rate at 1-mm ST segment depression) has not been explored.", 
    "72": "To determine whether the ischemic threshold during daily activity exhibits a circadian pattern that might relate to the frequency of occurrence of ischemic episodes, we studied the time of occurrence and the heart rate at onset of ischemia in 1,371 ischemic episodes recorded in 41 patients with stable coronary disease, positive exercise testing, and repeated ischemic episodes during ambulatory ECG monitoring (AEM). All patients had 7 days of AEM; 23 were off any anti-ischemic therapy, while 18 were on low dose of beta-blockers. The occurrence of ischemic episodes exhibited the typical bimodal circadian distribution with a prominent peak between 7:00 and 11:00 AM and a second less prominent peak between 6:00 and 9:00 PM. The threshold of myocardial ischemia exhibited a different single-peaked circadian distribution; it was lowest between 1:00 and 3:00 AM and highest between 10 AM and 1 PM. Time series analyses indicated a strong hour-by-hour trend of each of the two circadian distributions, whereas the two series cross-correlated maximally at a lag of zero hours (p < 0.01), indicating a complex interplay between myocardial oxygen demand and supply in determining the occurrence of ischemic episodes during daily activity. The morning increase in the frequency of ischemic episodes could not be attributed to a reduced threshold but rather to an increase in demand. The low threshold at night-time might probably indicate that the mechanism of ischemia during these hours is reduced coronary flow due to increased coronary tone. Secondary analyses for several predefined patients' subsets gave similar results. Patients who received low-dose beta-blockers maintained the bimodal circadian distribution of the occurrence of ischemic episodes, whereas the ischemic threshold exhibited a constant pattern with no circadian changes.", 
    "73": "Our results demonstrate that myocardial oxygen demand is a major determinant of daily ischemia, yet changes in the ischemic threshold that probably reflect dynamic changes in coronary tone play also an important role. The relative contribution of increased demand and decreased threshold to the genesis of ischemic episodes during daily activity can be assessed by AEM and may help to optimize medical therapy.", 
    "74": "We studied the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with Marfan's syndrome after observing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in a patient with this condition. We studied 25 patients (12 men and 13 women with a mean age of 31.9 +/- 2.8 yr) who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for Marfan's syndrome. Twenty-one of the patients were randomly recruited. We compared them with 12 age-, height-, and weight-matched control subjects. On history, 23 of 25 patients snored to some degree, and 21 of 25 had mild to moderate daytime hypersomnolence. Standard nocturnal polysomnography revealed that 16 of 25 (64%) patients had an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) greater than 5, with a mean of 20 +/- 3, and a mean minimal oxyhemoglobin saturation of 86 +/- 2%. Only one control subject had an AHI > 5, and the mean AHI for the group was 2 +/- 1 (p = 0.0005). Apneas and hypopneas were obstructive in nature. We conclude that there is a high prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with Marfan's syndrome, and that therefore the symptoms and signs of OSA should be sought in all such patients.", 
    "75": "To determine which computer ST criteria are superior for predicting patterns and severity of coronary artery disease during exercise testing, 230 male veterans were studied who had both coronary angiography and a treadmill exercise test. Significant (p < or = 0.05) differences in computer-scored ST criteria were observed among patients with progressively increasing disease severity. Three-vessel/left main disease produced responses significantly different from 1- and 2-vessel disease or those with < 70% occlusion. Discriminant function analysis revealed that horizontal or downsloping ST depression measured at the J junction during exercise or recovery, or both, was the most powerful predictor of severe disease. With use of a cut point of 0.075 mV ST depression, horizontal or downsloping ST depression alone yielded a sensitivity of 50% (95% confidence interval = 35 to 65%) and specificity of 71% for prediction of severe disease; the only additional variable that added significantly to the prediction was exercise capacity, which improved sensitivity to 57% (95% confidence interval = 41 to 72%) with no change in specificity. Measurements of ST amplitude at the J junction and at 60 ms after the J point without slope considered and other scores, including the Treadmill Exercise Score, ST Integral, and ST/heart rate index, had a lower but comparable predictive accuracy when compared with horizontal or downsloping ST depression. Prediction of coronary artery disease severity can be achieved using computerized electrocardiographic measurements obtained during exercise testing. The most powerful marker for severe coronary artery disease is the amount of horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression during exercise or recovery, or both, a measurement that stimulates the traditional visual approach.", 
    "76": "Pacing is indicated in patients with AF when clinical symptoms are readily attributable to slow ventricular rate and prolonged ventricular pauses. When choosing a pacemaker for implantation, one should consider the importance of a reasonable chronotropic response to exercise and provide a rate-responsive system (VVIR) for those patients who show chronotropic incompetence. In the case of paroxysmal AF, an AV synchronized system may provide protection against deterioration to chronic AF and heart failure and is preferred over VVI pacing, providing that paroxysms are infrequent. Drug-pacemaker interaction is rare, but it is recommended that class IC antiarrhythmic agents should not be used in pacemaker-dependent patients. Cardioversion should be performed with care in patients with a permanent pacemaker, and certain protective measures must be employed to avoid pacemaker destruction or malfunction. Pacemakers, when used according to strict criteria, constitute an integral part of treatment and may improve the quality of life and facilitate the use of necessary drugs in selected patients with AF.", 
    "77": "Intravenous atenolol was given to 31 patients just before balloon mitral valvotomy to assess the hemodynamic efficacy and safety of beta-blockade in mitral stenosis complicated by pulmonary hypertension. Hemodynamic response in patients with pulmonary resistance > 600 dynes.sec.cm-5 (group 2, n = 17) was compared with those (group 1, n = 14) with a resistance below this value. In addition to a higher pulmonary arterial resistance (by design), patients in group 2 had a higher systemic resistance, lower cardiac index, and smaller mitral valve area compared with those in group 1. After atenolol infusion, transmitral gradient and left atrial pressure improved similarly. In spite of the decline in left atrial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance increased in both groups, more in group 2 (847 +/- 398 dynes.sec.cm-5 to 135 +/- 648 dynes.sec.cm-5) than in group 1 (291 +/- 149 dynes.sec.cm-5 to 363 +/- 200; p < 0.001 for drug effect and p = 0.027 for group effect by two-way analysis of variance). Cardiac index declined similarly from 2.77 +/- 0.51 L/min/m2 to 2.37 +/- 0.37 L/min/m2 in group 1 and from 2.33 +/- 0.58 L/min/m2 to 1.92 +/- 0.54 L/min/m2 in group 2. Systemic pressure tended to decline only in group 2 (mean aortic pressure, 89 +/- 12 mm Hg to 89 +/- 12 mm Hg in group 1 and 90 +/- 9 mm Hg to 83 +/- 12 mm Hg in group 2; p = 0.06 for group effect).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

These responses were observed at the baseline hemoglobin level (12.5 +/- 0.3 g/100 ml) as well as after hemodilution-induced mild regional contractile dysfunction (7.4 +/- 0.4 g/100 ml) in the area supplied by this artery (LAD area).

Moreover, when the types of fibrosis were classified as interfascicular and intercellular by the dominance of counted points, there were 13 cases of interfascicular fibrosis and 5 cases of intercellular fibrosis in good responders and 1 case of interfascicular fibrosis and 11 cases of intercellular fibrosis in poor responders (p < 0.001, sensitivity 72%, specificity 91%, predictive accuracy 80%).

    "89": "The effects on blood pressure and renal function of long-term treatment with the alpha- and beta-blocker arotinolol at a dose of 20 mg/day were studied in 10 hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure. Patients received low-protein therapy in which the protein and phosphorus intakes were controlled at a certain level. The average duration of arotinolol treatment was 18.4 months. A significant decrease in blood pressure was seen after the second month of treatment, and this effect continued up to the 20th month. The progression rates of renal failure (creatinine clearance/month) before and after treatment were -0.377 +/- 0.344 and -0.164 +/- 0.172 ml/min/month, respectively. No side effects attributable to the drug were observed. These findings indicate that arotinolol has a stable antihypertensive effect and no adverse effects on renal function. Arotinolol appears to be a useful drug in the long-term treatment of hypertension in patients with chronic renal failure.", 
    "90": "Nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) contractile responses in guinea pig bronchi are due to the release of tachykinins from airway sensory nerves. The purpose of this study was to determine whether beta 2-receptor agonists modulate NANC contractions in guinea pig bronchi in vitro. Bronchial rings were suspended in organ baths for isometric measurement of tension, and comparable contractions were induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS; 40 V, 0.5 ms, 8 Hz for 20 s) or by exogenous substance P (3 microM). Aformoterol and salbutamol produced concentration-dependent inhibition of the NANC contraction, with aformoterol being ninefold more potent than salbutamol; approximate 50% inhibitory concentrations for aformoterol and salbutamol were 1.03 nM (n = 6) and 9.3 nM (n = 6), respectively. Aformoterol also inhibited the contraction induced by exogenous substance P but to a far lesser extent than its inhibition of EFS-induced responses. The inhibitory effects of formoterol (10 nM) on responses to EFS at 8 Hz were significantly prevented by propranolol (1 microM) and ICI 118551 (a beta 2-antagonist, 0.1 microM) but not by atenolol (a beta 1-antagonist, 1 microM) or phentolamine (10 microM). These experiments demonstrate that beta 2-agonists may modulate the release of tachykinins from airway sensory nerves by prejunctional receptors.", 
    "91": "Celiprolol given intravenously (i.v.) to pithed rats in the dose range of 0.1-10,000 micrograms/g produced a dose-dependent increase in heart rate (HR) which was greatest (123 beats/min) at 1,000-3,000 micrograms/kg. This partial agonist effect was blocked by the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712A. Celiprolol also produced a vasodepressor effect in this dose range which was abolished by the relatively selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551 but not CGP 20712A. The magnitude of this intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) response was not significantly altered by reserpine pretreatment. Celiprolol also antagonised the effects of isoprenaline 0.05 microgram/kg on HR and blood pressure (BP). The beta 1 selectivity of celiprolol as an antagonist in pithed rats (beta 1/beta 2 = 340:1) was similar to that observed in studies with isolated guinea pig atria and trachea (beta 1/beta 2 = 63:1), both being considerably greater than that observed with atenolol. Celiprolol, however, like atenolol, potentiated the bronchoconstrictor responses to histamine (3 micrograms/kg). Metabolic studies of rats and human urine failed to show significant amounts of potentially vasoactive metabolites. These data are consistent with celiprolol acting as both a beta 1- and beta 2- adrenoceptor partial agonist.",

In protocol 1, VFT was determined with 2-S, 50-Hz continuous pulses. Flecainide (n = 7) prolonged intraventricular conduction time (CT) and ventricular effective refractory period (ERP) and increased VFT significantly. Bretylium (n = 6) prolonged ERP slightly, but did not increase VFT significantly. Both D-sotalol (n = 6) and E-4031 (n = 6) prolonged ERP and increased VFT. In protocol 2, VFT was determined with the extrastimulus technique in dogs, with localized ventricular necrosis produced with protease. Flecainide (n = 10), D-sotalol (n = 8), and E-4031 (n = 8) restored VFT, which had been decreased by protease injection, to the baseline level, whereas bretylium (n = 8) did not. In protocol 3, the train pulse method with 100-Hz train pulses covering the vulnerable period was used in the same dogs used for protocol 2. Flecainide, bretylium, and D-sotalol increased VFT, but E-4031 did not. The antifibrillatory effects of class III drugs differ depending on the method of VFT determination. The present data suggest that the antifibrillatory effects of antiarrhythmic drugs should be assessed by different methods of VFT determination.", 
    "93": "The possibility that D-myo-inositol-1,2,6-triphosphate (PP56), which has shown some specificity for antagonism of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in vitro, may antagonize responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation was investigated in canine blood-perfused gracilis muscle in situ after pretreatment with irreversible alpha-adrenoceptor blockade by phenoxybenzamine and beta-adrenoceptor blockade by propranolol. Sympathetic nerve stimulation (10 Hz, 2 min) increased muscle perfusion pressure and evoked overflow of norepinephrine (NE) from the tissue. PP56 at 50 and 500 microM (calculated local arterial plasma concentrations) did not influence NE overflow but attenuated the late phase of the vasoconstrictor response to nerve stimulation and reduced the increase in perfusion pressure evoked by exogenous NPY. PP56 also induced vasodilatation per se, but had no effect on the vascular response to exogenous angiotensin II (AII) or the remaining vasoconstrictor response to exogenous NE. PP56 antagonizes late components in the nonadrenergic sympathetic vasoconstriction and vasoconstriction evoked by exogenous NPY, without influencing transmitter release. Because previous results with this and other models propose a role for NPY in mediating nonadrenergic vasoconstriction, we suggest that PP56 may antagonize effects of neuronally released NPY at the postjunctional level.",

However, new antihypertensive drugs are now widely used. These compounds may also prevent cardiovascular complications, but, as yet, this has not been proven. The clinical trials of the 1990s such as STOP II, CAPPP and NORDIL will test whether antihypertensive treatment with ACE-inhibitors and calcium-blockers are more effective than diuretics and beta-blockers in preventing cardiovascular complications. Also, a large-scale study (HOT) is being undertaken to examine how far diastolic blood pressure should be treated, and whether a small dose of aspirin has a protective effect when combined with good control of blood pressure. These studies will hopefully lead to better guidelines for the future treatment of hypertension.",

Immunoaffinity isolation may be the best solution to this analytical problem. This was tested for a model compound, the metabolite 4'-hydroxypropranolol sulfate (HOPS), which was effectively extracted from plasma by a column containing antibodies to the parent drug propranolol. The specificity was very high, giving little interference from the biological material in subsequent high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis with fluorometric detection. The method for HOPS was highly reproducible and provided a sensitivity of 1 ng/ml plasma. The technique was applied to measurements of HOPS in plasma after therapeutic doses of propranolol as well as to the individual enantiomers after chiral derivatization.",

Diastereoisomeric derivatives were resolved by HPLC (C8 column) with fluorescence detection (lambda ex = 235 nm and lambda em = 300 nm). Retention times of l- and d-sotalol derivatives were 13 and 15 min while that of the internal standard, S-(-)-atenolol, was 12.3 min. The detection limit of each enantiomer was 12.5 ng/ml using 1 ml of plasma or urine.

This method was found to be precise and accurate for the measurement of propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol concentrations in urine from pharmacokinetic investigations. This method represents the first assay for direct determination of 4-hydroxypropranolol enantiomers. The ability to easily measure 4-hydroxypropranolol enantiomers is valuable because the stereoselective disposition of propranolol is primarily due to stereoselective metabolism in the pathway responsible for generation of 4-hydroxypropranolol.",

Following denervation, TG activity in SCG decreased to 83% of the unoperated control value, whereas that of axotomized ganglia was 28% of control. Thus, TG activity was relatively unaffected when sympathetic ganglionic neurons were preserved, but was markedly reduced under conditions where neurons were degenerating. Addition of ACh (0.1 mM) to the medium during aerobic incubation stimulated TG activity more than 3-fold in denervated ganglia but had no effect on TG activity in axotomized ganglia. Similarly, the NE (0.05 mM)-induced decrease of TG activity observed in intact SCG was also seen following denervation (-49%) but not following axotomy. In denervated SCG, the stimulatory effects of ACh were virtually abolished by co-addition of the cholinergic antagonists, atropine or hexamethonium, while the suppressant effects of NE were blocked by the adrenergic antagonists, propranolol, prazosin or yohimbine. These results imply that transmitter-induced rapid changes in TG activity occur predominantly in ganglionic neurons. When the ganglia were depolarized by high KCl (50 mM), a significant increase in TG activity in each intact, denervated and axotomized SCG was seen with qualitatively similar manner, suggesting that high KCl-induced depolarization affects both neuronal and glial components in the SCG. The marked increase in ganglionic TG activity in response to GM1 (5 nM) and synthetic SC (0.02 mM) were lost in denervated SCG but only partially reduced in axotomized SCG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "100": "The chemotactic peptide fMLP (N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine) induced the production of platelet-activating factor (PAF) by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) incubated with cytochalasin B (CB). CoA-independent transacylase showed similar activity in both resting and stimulated PMN, and PAF production only occurred when lyso-PAF:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase had been converted into the high activity form. PAF formation was coincidental with an increase of the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), and with an enhanced formation of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol. Both fMLP-induced PAF production and the activation of lyso-PAF:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase were diminished by propranolol. Since several molecular species of phosphatidic acid (PA) produced an inhibition of both PAF production and acetyltransferase activation on intact cells, a portion of the inhibitory effect of propranolol was related to the accumulation of PA. Furthermore, whereas CB increased both the extent and the duration of the fMLP-induced [Ca2+]i transient, propranolol was found to inhibit the CB-induced increase of the [Ca2+]i transient. These data indicate that both the attenuation of [Ca2+]i transient and the accumulation of PA may operate as termination signals for PAF production by actin on lyso-PAF:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase.", 
    "101": "We have demonstrated previously that (-)isoproterenol triggers lipolysis in rat epididymal fat cells by stimulating both classical (beta 1, beta 2) and atypical beta-adrenoceptors. The contribution of the classical beta-adrenoceptors can be blocked by addition of 3 nM CGP12177(di-4-3[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]-(2-hydroxylpropoxy )1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one hydrochloride). At higher concentrations, CGP12177 triggers lipolysis also, but by stimulating atypical beta-adrenoceptors only. To find out whether (-)isoproterenol and CGP12177 stimulate similar atypical beta-adrenoceptors, we compared their interaction with recognised beta 3-adrenoceptor antagonists: CGP20712 (1-[2-((3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxy)phenoxy)ethylamino]-3-[4-(1-methyl- 4-trifluoromethyl-2-imidazolyl)phenoxy]-propan-2-ol) (beta 1-selective), ICI118551 [erythro-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3- (isopropylamine)-butan-2-ol] (beta 2-selective) and the stereoisomers as well as the racemic mixture of propranolol (non-beta 1/beta 2-subtype selective) and of metoprolol (beta 1-selective). There was a highly significant relationship (r = 0.93) between the potencies of these antagonists for inhibiting the lipolytic response to (-)isoproterenol (in the absence of classical beta-adrenoceptor stimulation) and CGP12177. In both cases, propranolol and metoprolol showed also the same degree of stereoselectivity. These findings suggest that (-)isoproterenol and CGP12177 stimulate the same type and/or form of atypical beta-adrenoceptors in rat epididymal adipocytes.", 
    "102": "A simultaneous screening method for atenolol, acebutolol, metoprolol, oxprenolol, alprenolol and propranolol by ion-pair chromatography with a column-switching technique was developed. The serum samples were purified using either liquid-liquid extraction or solid-phase extraction methods. The pretreatment of the samples consisted of hydrolysis and protein precipitation. The drug separation was on either octadecylsilica or polymer-based alkyl column material. Binary eluent mixtures containing methanol and a buffer solution with a quaternary ammonium salt as an ion-pair former were used. Detection of the compounds in liquid chromatographic analysis was based on ultraviolet spectra. The effects of methanol, two buffers and the ion-pair former on the retention of the compounds were studied. The determination limits ranged from nanograms to micrograms in the ion-pair chromatographic method, depending on the drug studied. Identification was based on the mass spectra or, if necessary, on selected-ion monitoring spectra of either the methylated or the acetylated compounds obtained by means of gas chromatography-electron impact or negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry. The detection limits for the identified compounds were in the picogram range. The matrix effect was strong, and this resulted in determination limits in the nanogram range with the scan method.", 
    "103": "beta-Adrenergic blocking agents are of therapeutic value in the treatment of migraine and various cardiovascular disorders (angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension). Owing to their sedative effect, they are also used as doping agents in sport. A characteristic feature of beta-blockers is the alkanolamine side-chain terminating in a secondary amino group. The pKa values vary from 9.2 to 9.8. Because some beta-blockers are hydrophilic and some lipophilic, simultaneous determination is difficult. In this work, a method based on micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MECC) was developed for the separation and determination of beta-blockers. The 0.08 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) solution contained 10 mM N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Ten parent beta-blockers in human urine could be separated in a single run and determined quantitatively by the internal standard (2,6-dimethylphenol) method. Neither endogenous compounds in urine nor caffeine and its metabolites interfered with the analysis. The clean-up procedure for urine consisted of a simple filtration through 0.5-microns PTFE membranes. The MECC method exhibited good repeatability and a linear range of 25-150 micrograms/ml. The method was applied to determination of oxprenolol in real samples.", 
    "104": "The pig heart grows at a maximal rate in the first 2-3 days of life due to a volume overload imposed on the heart at birth. Rates of ribosome formation and protein synthesis cannot be further accelerated during in vitro perfusion with agents that increase cyclic AMP, that bind to alpha 1-adrenergic receptors or that bind to angiotensin II receptors. Growth of the heart in vivo can be restrained by treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril maleate, or an angiotensin receptor antagonist, DuP 753. In the enalapril-treated heart, norepinephrine plus propranolol, but not angiotensin II, accelerated ribosome formation. Rapid growth of the left ventricle of pig heart during the first 10 days of life is due largely to eccentric hypertrophy.", 
    "105": "Experiments were carried out to elucidate the characteristics of regulation of cyclic AMP levels in intact myocardial cells. For this purpose, the influence of isoproterenol, a nonselective cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and carbachol on cyclic AMP levels was investigated in isolated rat cardiac myocytes. The extent of cyclic AMP accumulation induced by isoproterenol was much less than that produced by IBMX: submaximal concentrations of isoproterenol and IBMX elevated the cyclic AMP level 2.4- and 4.8-fold of the control level, respectively. Both agents in combination increased the cyclic AMP level markedly 48-fold. Carbachol inhibited the cyclic AMP accumulation induced by isoproterenol, IBMX and their combination by 30%, 60% and 80% of the respective response. The extent of inhibition produced by carbachol of the cyclic AMP accumulation induced by IBMX + isoproterenol was smaller than that caused by propranolol, and carbachol produced only a marginal additional inhibitory action to that of propranolol, implying that carbachol does not affect the process of cyclic AMP degradation. The present findings indicate that in intact cardiac myocytes the rate of cyclic AMP degradation catalyzed by PDE may be a crucial process of cyclic AMP turnover. This view is supported by the observations that the inhibitory action of carbachol on the effect of isoproterenol was less than that on the effect of IBMX, and that the inhibitory action of carbachol was markedly enhanced by the simultaneous presence of IBMX.", 
    "106": "The goal of our study was to assess whether the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coat protein gp120 induces functional alterations in astrocytes and microglia, known for their reactivity and involvement in most types of brain pathology. We hypothesized that gp120-induced anomalies in glial functions, if present, might be mediated by changes in the levels of intracellular messengers important for signal transduction, such as cAMP. Acute (10 min) exposure of cultured rat cortical astrocytes or microglia to 100 pM gp120 caused only a modest (50-60%), though statistically significant, elevation in cAMP levels, which was antagonized by the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol. More importantly, the protein substantially depressed [by 30% (astrocytes) and 50% (microglia)] the large increase in cAMP induced by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10 nM), without affecting that induced by direct adenylate cyclase stimulation by forskolin. Qualitatively similar results were obtained using a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive human glioma cell line. The depression of the beta-adrenergic response had functional consequences in both astrocytes and microglia. In astrocytes we studied the phosphorylation of the two major cytoskeletal proteins, vimentin and GFAP, which is normally stimulated by isoproterenol, and found that gp120 partially (40-50%) prevented such stimulation. In microglial cells, which are the major producers of inflammatory cytokines within the brain, gp120 partially antagonized the negative beta-adrenergic modulation of lipopolysaccharide (10 ng/ml)-induced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha. Our results suggest that, by interfering with the beta-adrenergic regulation of astrocytes and microglia, gp120 may alter astroglial \"reactivity\" and upset the delicate cytokine network responsible for the defense against viral and opportunistic infections.", 
    "107": "Receptor-specific or homologous desensitization of beta 2-adrenergic receptors is thought to be effected via phosphorylation of the receptor by the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK), followed by binding of beta-arrestin. We have generated stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell lines overexpressing either of the two regulatory proteins and also expressing low or high levels of beta 2-adrenergic receptors (approximately 80 and approximately 600 fmol/mg of membrane protein). In these cells, we studied the process of desensitization induced by the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. In cells expressing high levels of beta 2-adrenergic receptors, desensitization to high concentrations of isoproterenol (previously shown to be mediated by both beta ARK and protein kinase A) amounted to approximately 50% in control cells, approximately 80% in beta ARK-overexpressing cells, and approximately 90% in beta-arrestin-overexpressing cells. In cells expressing low levels of beta 2-adrenergic receptors, these values were approximately 50, approximately 60, and approximately 60%, respectively. Desensitization to low concentrations of isoproterenol (previously shown to be essentially protein kinase A-mediated and not receptor-specific, i.e. heterologous) was not affected by overexpression of either beta ARK or beta-arrestin. These data suggest that in cells expressing high levels of beta 2-adrenergic receptors, beta-arrestin and beta ARK become limiting for homologous receptor desensitization. They provide further support for the involvement of these two proteins in the regulation of beta 2-adrenergic receptor function.", 
    "108": "Effects of the sulphur-containing acidic amino acids (SAAs) cysteic acid (CA), homocysteic acid (HCA), cysteine sulphinic acid (CSA), homocysteine sulphinic acid (HCSA), and S-sulphocysteine (SC) on intracellular concentrations of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and cGMP ([cGMP]i) as well as their cytotoxic actions were investigated in cultured cerebral cortical neurons. The glutamate receptor subtype selective antagonists APV (D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate) acting on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and DNQX (6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) acting on non-NMDA receptors were employed to obtain information about the involvement of glutamate receptor subtypes in these actions of the SAAs. It was found that all SAAs exerted a cytotoxic action on the neurons. The ED50 values for CSA, CA, HCSA, and HCA were around 30 to 50 microM and that for SC was about 150 microM. The glutamate transport blocker L-aspartate-beta-hydroxamate increased the efficacy of CSA and CA but had no effect on the cytotoxic actions of the remaining SAAs. In case of CA, HCA, and SC the cytotoxicity could be prevented by APV alone and for HCSA, DNQX could block the toxic action. DNQX reduced the toxicity of HCA somewhat but the presence of APV was required for complete protection. CSA toxicity could only be blocked by the combination of APV and DNQX. All SAAs induced an increase in [cGMP]i and [Ca2+]i and with regard to [Ca2+]i SC was the most potent and CA the least potent SAA. The effect of all SAAs on [cGMP]i could be blocked by APV alone whereas DNQX had no effect except in the case of HCSA where the response was blocked completely and HCA where the response was inhibited by 75%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
