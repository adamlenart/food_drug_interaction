The pre-chromatographic sample preparation involved Extrelut column clean-up followed by liquid extraction of the organic extract into dilute acetic acid. Separation was on a Nucleosil ODS 3-microns column at 40 degrees C, with a phosphate buffer-methanol mobile phase. Detection was performed at +450 mV with an ESA electrochemical detector. Mepindolol was used as internal standard and quantitation was based on peak-area ratios. Total analysis time was 14 min per sample. The recovery rate of the assay was at least 70% for both compounds. A detection limit as low as 25 pg/ml, starting with 1 ml of plasma, was achieved. The day-to-day reproducibility and accuracy, checked with quality-control samples, demonstrated the reliability of this assay used by different analysts, on different chromatographic systems and over a long period of time.", 
    "1": "The efficacy and patient acceptance of transdermal clonidine applied once a week were assessed in 62 mild hypertensives previously controlled on a diuretic and/or beta-blocker in a general practice setting involving 18 general practitioners. Patients underwent 3-5 week wash-out period and those patients whose mean seated diastolic blood pressure returned to levels between 91-105 mmHg or increased by greater than 10 mmHg above the initial value, were titrated with transdermal clonidine (Catapres-TTS-1, 2, or 3) and maintained on the optimal dose for 3 months with monthly check-ups. Satisfactory response of blood pressure to levels below 90 mmHg or greater than 10 mmHg reduction from the wash-out level was obtained in 85% of patients who completed the titration phase; nine patients failed to achieve a satisfactory blood pressure control. There was no significant difference in blood pressure response between previous therapy and transdermal clonidine treatment. Systemic side effects were minimal. Eight patients withdrew because of local allergic contact dermatitis. This study confirms that transdermal clonidine is at least as effective in reducing blood pressure as diuretic and/or beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "2": "The receptors involved in the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-increasing action of dopamine (DA) in mouse lymphoid cells were determined by comparing the potencies of specific DA receptor and adrenoceptor antagonists to inhibit the cAMP response to DA and to isoproterenol. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol, pindolol and dichloroisoproterenol were the most potent inhibitors of the response to both DA and isoproterenol. Their potencies were 2-3 orders greater for the inhibition of DA than isoproterenol action. SCH 23390 (selective DA1 antagonist) and haloperidol (mixed DA1/DA2 antagonist) inhibited the DA action only at high concentrations (10(-5)-10(-4) M) which did not affect the response to isoproterenol. These results indicate that beta-adrenoceptors are involved in the DA-induced elevation of mouse lymphocyte cAMP.", 
    "3": "The beta-adrenergic receptor polypeptides in synaptic membranes of rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum have been identified using the photoaffinity label [125I]iodoazidobenzylpindolol. The major receptor polypeptides possess apparent molecular weights of 62,000 and 49,000 (cerebral cortex) or 59,000 and 46,000 (cerebellum). Treatment of the membranes with endoglycosidase F caused the receptor polypeptides from both tissues to exhibit lower apparent molecular weight (51,000) on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, indicating that beta-adrenergic receptors in mammalian brain are glycoproteins as are the receptors in peripheral tissues.", 
    "4": "Beta-adrenergic receptors have been purported to act as possible mediators in the lipolytic effect of somatostatin in vivo. Investigations with isolated rat adipocytes studying the lipolytic activity of somatostatin (1.7 x 10(-7) M), glucagon (8.1 x 10(-8 M) and norepinephrine (10(-6) M), have shown that the lipolytic effect stimulated by somatostatin is not altered by 10(-5) M propranolol (beta-antagonist); is significantly enhanced by 10(-5) M isoproterenol (beta-agonist) and is not altered by the addition of 10(-6) M phenoxybenzamine (alpha-antagonist) or 10(-6) M phenylephrine (alpha-agonist). Similar results were found when lipolysis was stimulated by glucagon, whereas the lipolytic effect stimulated by norepinephrine was blocked by propranolol. These results indicate that the direct lipolytic effect of somatostatin on isolated rat adipocytes does not seem to be mediated through mechanisms involved with adrenergic receptors.", 
    "5": "Intracoronary thrombi were found in 20 of 52 patients (38%) who had coronary angiography because of treatment-resistant unstable angina. Unrelated to the angiographic finding, eight patients (15%) sustained a myocardial infarction, and two died during their hospital stay. Only one patient (5%) with and six patients (19%) without intracoronary thrombi were stabilized and discharged from hospital. The remaining patients either had an aortocoronary bypass (n = 31) or transluminal balloon angioplasty (n = 13). These findings underline the importance of intracoronary thrombus formation in the pathogenesis of treatment-resistant unstable angina.", 
    "6": "The rationale for using intravenous nitrates in patients hospitalized with severe angina pectoris is that physiologic action is almost immediate. Many studies and clinical experience indicate that the use of this preparation results in a marked diminution of recurrent angina episodes in most patients. If adverse reactions such as severe hypotension or bradycardia occur, decreasing the dose or stopping it entirely corrects the problem. Intravenous nitroglycerin can be used in combination with other known antianginal agents, such as beta blockers and calcium antagonists. In clinical practice most patients are treated with nitrates and beta blockers or calcium antagonists because the combination of drugs may reduce ischemia and symptoms more than each drug used alone over a long period.", 
    "7": "The recently cloned human beta-adrenergic cDNA and several mutated forms have been expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes by injection of RNA made from the cDNA under the control of the bacteriophage SP6 promoter. The cDNA and gene of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor possess the unusual feature of having a second upstream ATG (-101 base pairs) and a 19-codon open reading frame 5' to the initiator methionine codon of the receptor (Kobilka, B. K., Dixon, R. A. F., Frielle, T., Dohlman, H. G., Bolanowski, M., Sigal, I. S., Yang-Feng, T. L., Francke, U., Caron, M. G., and Lefkowitz, R. J. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 46-50). RNA lacking this upstream AUG and open reading frame was translated approximately 10-fold more efficiently both in an in vitro rabbit reticulocyte system and in oocytes. Injected oocytes but not water injected controls expressed typical beta 2-adrenergic receptors as assessed by ligand binding (450 fmol/mg membrane protein) and catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase (approximately 20 fold). Moreover, these receptors displayed typical agonist-induced homologous desensitization when oocytes were incubated with isoproterenol at room temperature for 3-24 h. Among a series of mutations, truncations of the membrane-anchored core of the receptor eliminated receptor binding and cyclase stimulating activity. In contrast, disruption of one of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites or removal of the serine/threonine-rich carboxyl terminus had little or no effect on these functions or on the extent of agonist-induced desensitization relative to that observed with native receptor. These studies validate the beta 2-adrenergic nature of the cloned human beta-adrenergic cDNA, document the utility of the Xenopus oocyte system for studying functional and regulatory properties of receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase, and suggest the possibility that elements in the 5' untranslated region of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor RNA may regulate its translation in vivo.", 
    "8": "In human liver microsomal preparations the neurotoxic chemical N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and several of its analogs competitively inhibited bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase activity of cytochrome P450bufI. This enzyme is the target of the common genetic polymorphism of drug oxidation known as debrisoquine polymorphism. Bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase activity was detectable in rat brain tissue. The activity was inhibited by antisera raised against a rat liver cytochrome P450 called P450db1. Immunoblotting experiments revealed the presence of a protein in rat and human brain microsomes with the same electrophoretic properties as the liver enzyme. These data suggest that P450bufI may be involved in the metabolism and neurotoxicity of MPTP.", 
    "9": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) stimulates cGMP production in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes incubated in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (1mM). Half maximal activation was found at 10(-8)M ANP. Cellular cGMP concentrations of around 0.6 pmol/10(6) cells were elevated 4-6 fold by ANP (10(-6)M), 3-4 fold by carbachol (1mM) and around 10 fold by sodium nitroprusside (1mM). ANP had no effect on basal or isoprenaline-stimulated cAMP concentrations or on basal or noradrenaline-stimulated turnover of phosphatidylinositol. From these results we conclude that ANP receptors, coupled to particulate guanylate cyclase, exist in cardiac ventricular muscle. This indicates that ANP may also have a physiological action on ventricular muscle contractility during volume expansion.", 
    "10": "Responses of isolated preparations of longitudinal myometrium from the guinea-pig to fenoterol, salbutamol and isoprenaline were examined. Virgin adult guinea-pigs were treated (i) with oestradiol cypionate 20 micrograms/kg s.c. thrice weekly for two weeks; or (ii) as in (i) plus progesterone 3 mg/animal for the last four days. Other animals (diestrous; cycle days 6-10) were untreated. The order of potency of the agonists in inhibiting field stimulation-induced contractions of the preparations (isoprenaline greater than or equal to fenoterol greater than salbutamol) indicated interaction with beta 2-adrenoceptors. Oestrogen treatment enhanced the potency of isoprenaline 5-fold. Treatment with oestrogen plus progesterone enhanced the potency of all agonists 10- to 30-fold, and increased the mean maximum response to salbutamol. The mean pKD values for displacement by fenoterol of binding of (-)-[125I]cyanopindolol to membrane preparations from animals in both treatment groups were 5.57-5.92. These results raise the possibility that progesterone may enhance the coupling of beta 2-adrenoceptors to transduction mechanisms in the longitudinal myometrium from oestrogen-primed guinea-pigs.", 
    "11": "The racemic 3-O-sulfates of epinephrine and norepinephrine as well as 4-O-sulfoconjugated dopamine were synthesized, highly purified and investigated with respect to their beta-adrenoceptor affinities and relative potencies in the receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase system in isolated human mononuclear leukocytes. The receptor affinities of all catecholamine sulfates were reduced at least 1,000-fold when compared to those of the free catecholamines. Furthermore, catecholamine sulfoconjugates did not produce intracellular cAMP signals. In contrast to the sulfated catecholamine metabolites, the 3-O-methylated catecholamines metanephrine and normetanephrine were found to behave as endogenous beta-adrenoceptor-competing agents with lower beta-receptor affinities than the corresponding free catecholamines. No beta-receptor agonist activity in the adenylate cyclase system was found with metanephrine and normetanephrine. Our data provide direct evidence that sulfoconjugation renders catecholamines inactive as beta-receptor ligands and must thus be regarded as a mechanism to control adrenergic action at the prereceptor level by a buffering of the concentration of free catecholamines. The physiological significance of a potential role of 3-O-methylated catecholamines as endogenous beta-receptor antagonists has to be further clarified.", 
    "12": "Vasomotor headaches are commonly, especially in the international literature, classified under ordinary migraine. Since beta-blockers seem to be the drug of choice in the prevention of migraine, 30 patients were given placebo and three times 40 mg propranolol in a double-blind cross-over trial. Among 24 fully assessable sets of tests only four showed a decrease in the frequency of headaches by more than 50%. In three patients the frequency actually increased over the placebo effect.", 
    "13": "The stimulation of adrenoreceptors by epinephrine leads to an alteration in the Ca2+ homeostasis of rat submandibular cells. The relative contributions of alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors were assessed with specific adrenergic agents. Stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoreceptors resulted in enhanced unidirectional 45Ca2+ fluxes, while such effects following beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation, though suggestive, were equivocal. When the cytosolic Ca2+ level was followed in cells pre-loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent indicator Quin 2, clear results were observed. Both alpha 1- and beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation were capable of mobilizing intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ pools, as assessed by differential responses of cells incubated in media (+/-)-ethylene-glycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid. However, Ca2+ mobilization following alpha 1-adrenoreceptor stimulation was more rapid (initial rate approximately 4-5 X) and to a greater extent (approximately 2 X) than seen with beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation.", 
    "14": "Treatment of rat reticulocytes with isoproterenol resulted in dose- and time-dependent desensitization of adenylate cyclase to beta-adrenoceptor agonist stimulation. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase was possibly involved in this desensitization. Treatment of rat reticulocytes with a phorbol ester, tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA), also induced desensitization to beta-adrenoceptor agonists, indicating the possible involvement of protein kinase C. The addition of a beta-adrenoceptor agonist enhanced the desensitizing effect of dibutyryl cyclic AMP or TPA. T1/2 (time for induction of half maximal desensitization) was decreased from 30 to 2.5 min in accordance with an increase in the concentration of the agonist. The extent of the desensitization was also increased by addition of the agonist. The potency with which the increase was induced was compatible with the potency for binding of the agonist to beta-adrenoceptors (KD values). These results suggest that cyclic AMP- or phorbol ester-induced desensitization is enhanced by receptor occupation by beta-adrenoceptor agonists.", 
    "15": "Sequential exercise-gated cardiac blood pool scintigrams provide a noninvasive technique for evaluating the effect of therapeutic interventions on cardiac volumes and function only if both exercise periods are equivalent in the absence of an intervention. To assess whether they are indeed equivalent, 14 healthy subjects underwent gated blood pool scintigraphy during two maximal upright exercise periods separated by 60 min without changing position. Although resting cardiac output and blood pressure returned to base-line values 60 min after the first exercise period, mean resting heart rate was markedly higher (89.4 +/- 2.7 vs. 66.5 +/- 2.5 beats/min, P less than 0.001) and upright cardiac volumes lower [39.1 +/- 4.9 vs. 56.3 +/- 6.0 ml, P less than 0.001, for end-systolic volume (ESV) and 112.6 +/- 8.0 vs. 144.9 +/- 9.0 ml, P less than 0.001, for end-diastolic volume (EDV)] than before the first exercise period. These differences persisted during low levels of the subsequent exercise but not at high and maximum work loads. Cardiac volumes and heart rate 60 min after an identical exercise protocol in a second group of 22 subjects who received propranolol, 0.15 mg/kg iv, after their initial exercise, however, were the same as those preexercise. Thus higher sympathetic tone may be responsible for the persistently higher heart rate and decreased cardiac volumes after exercise, and the assumption that cardiac volumes and function are similar during two closely spaced sequential exercise studies is not always valid.", 
    "16": "The importance of gluconeogenic substrates (i.e., lactate, glycerol, and alanine) in the glycogen resynthesis observed in fasting rats after exhausting submaximal exercise [R.D. Fell et al. Am. J. Physiol. 238 (Regulatory Integrative Comp. Physiol. 7): R328-R332, 1980] was examined in muscles and liver in response to pharmacological alterations of gluconeogenic precursor flux. The minor role of lactate for glycogen resynthesis after prolonged submaximal exercise was confirmed by the insignificant accumulation of lactate neither in muscles nor in plasma. When the rate of lipolysis is reduced either by beta-blockade or by nicotinic acid injection, the replenishment of muscle glycogen persisted, suggesting that glycerol released by triglycerides hydrolysis did not play an important role in glycogen resynthesis. On the other hand, when pyruvate oxidation is enhanced by dichloroacetate (DCA), thus reducing plasma levels of lactate and alanine, glycogen resynthesis was completely blocked in liver and partly in some but not all muscles. This failure in total inhibition of glycogen resynthesis associated with the significant reduction of the plasma alanine level could be attributed to the possible stimulation of gluconeogenesis from alanine by DCA (R.A. Harris and D.W. Crabb. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 189: 364-371, 1978). The results could point out alanine as the major gluconeogenic substrate during recovery from exhaustive exercise in fasting conditions.", 
    "17": "We evaluated involvement of adrenergic receptors in the responses of the hepatic vasculature to reduction either of portal venous flow or hepatic arterial inflow. Portal vein occlusion caused an increase in hepatic arterial blood flow (HAF) and decreases in hepatic arterial pressure (HAP) and hepatic arterial vascular resistance (HAR) in the intact group. After pretreatment with either yohimbine or prazosin, but not propranolol, occlusion of the portal vein produced a greater decrease in HAP as compared with that in the intact group. No significant changes in HAF, HAR, or hepatic tissue blood flow (HTF) occurred after the treatment. These results indicate that the compensatory response of the hepatic arterial vasculature to altered portal blood flow (PVF) is regulated independently of the intrahepatic adrenergic receptors. Hepatic arterial occlusion caused a significant decrease in portal venous pressure, PVF, and HTF. Portal venous vascular resistance (PVR) was reduced slightly, but not significantly. After pretreatment with either yohimbine or prazosin, but not propranolol, occlusion of the hepatic artery produced an opposite effect: to increase PVF and significantly decrease PVR. These results indicate that intrahepatic alpha-adrenoceptors participate in the regulation of portal vascular tone to maintain portal vein pressure at a steady level, when inflow from the hepatic artery is reduced.", 
    "18": "A case of severe nonimmune hydrops fetalis caused by supraventricular tachycardia is presented. Maternal treatment with digoxin and the subsequent addition of verapamil and propranolol failed to be effective. Simultaneous measurement of maternal serum and cord blood digoxin levels showed insufficient transplacental digoxin transfer. Other modalities of treatment are discussed.", 
    "19": "The present study was aimed at investigating in rats whether a common mechanism might underlie the reversal of depressive-like behaviors by classical antidepressants and by GABA agonists such as muscimol. Blockade of GABA transmission with picrotoxin (1 mg/kg IP) abolished the muscimol (0.5-1 mg/kg)-induced reduction of immobility in the swimming test and the reversal of escape failures in the learned helplessness paradigm. Conversely, picrotoxin was found not to reduce the efficacy of imipramine-like drugs in these same animal models. The combination of muscimol and tricyclics given at subeffective doses resulted in behavioral changes that can be accounted for by an additive interaction between these two classes of drugs. These data confirm the antidepressant-like profile of GABA agonists but suggest that it is unlikely that the primary antidepressant mechanism of conventional antidepressants involves GABA-A receptors. In the swimming test, prazosin (2 mg/kg), an alpha adrenoceptor blocker, antagonized the reduction of immobility produced by both muscimol and imipramine-like drugs. In the learned helplessness paradigm, penbutolol (0.25-0.5 mg/kg) and, though to a lesser extent prazosin, counter-acted the reversal of escape failures caused by muscimol and imipramine. On the basis of these data, it is tempting to speculate that increased transmitter outflow at noradrenergic receptors may be an essential component in the mechanism of action of imipramine-like drugs but also of GABA agonists.", 
    "20": "High magnesium (Mg) diets induce diarrhea in chicks. Addition of 0.3, 0.5 or 0.9% Mg (as MgO) to a corn-soy basal diet caused a dose-related lower gut passage time (GPT) (the first appearance of colored markers from feed in excreta), with the threshold for catharsis being approximately the 0.3% addition. Supplementation of the high Mg diets with a water-absorbent clay did not change the chicks' GPT. The beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol (1.68 mg/kg body wt) or the alpha-adrenergic blocking agent phenoxybenzamine (0.28 mg/kg body wt) did not effect the GPT of chicks fed high Mg diets. However, both the muscarinic blocker methscopolamine (0.12 mg/kg body wt) and the serotonergic blocker methysergide (0.2 mg/kg body wt) resulted in a higher GPT of chicks fed high Mg diets compared to corn-soy fed control chicks. Analysis of the osmotic load of excreta or intestinal contents of high Mg-fed chicks showed no differences from osmotic loads of control-fed chicks. When the osmotic loads observed were partitioned into mineral cationic and anionic components, the Mg content was found to be higher in intestines of chicks, but this higher Mg was paralleled and/or surpassed by chloride (Cl) content. From these data the authors conclude that Mg-induced cartharsis is due not simply to the hyperosmotic effect of Mg per se but to neural or endocrine arcs that affect the secretion or absorption of Cl as well.", 
    "21": "The pineal gland is innervated by sympathetic neurons whose cell bodies are located in the superior cervical ganglia. This pathway, which carries information concerning environmental lighting to the gland, is important for maintaining a circadian rhythm in the activity of the pineal enzyme serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT). Lesioning this pathway blocks the normal nighttime increase in NAT activity. Following transplantation of the pineal gland to the anterior chamber of the eye, the gland becomes reinnervated by collateral sprouts of sympathetic neurons that innervate the iris. In addition, a day-night rhythm in NAT activity is restored to the transplanted glands (Moore, 1975; B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m et al., 1976). These findings raise the possibility that the neural regulation of pineal function may be restored to normal by collateral sprouts of foreign neurons. To determine whether this is the case, other aspects of the neural regulation of NAT activity were examined in transplanted and in situ pineal glands. When the dark period was extended into the normal light period, NAT activity decreased to daytime values in both groups, suggesting that, in both cases, darkness is only effective in maintaining high levels of NAT activity at certain times during the day-night cycle. In contrast to their similar responses to extended darkness, the 2 groups of pineal glands responded differently to a brief pulse of light during the dark period. While the light exposure caused a dramatic decrease in nighttime NAT activity in in situ pineal glands, it produced no change in this enzyme activity in transplanted glands.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "22": "Thrombolytic therapy given within the first 4 to 6 hours to patients with evolving acute MI appears to reduce in-hospital and 1-year mortality rates. In addition, patients who receive treatment in the first few hours may also benefit through improved residual left ventricular function, resulting from the preservation of ischemic myocardium. Newer agents that are more effective in lysing intracoronary thrombi are currently under development. The most promising is tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), which is being evaluated in a number of large multicenter trials, including the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) trial. In this study researchers are also comparing the additional value of early versus delayed coronary artery angioplasty and are evaluating a subset of patients randomly assigned to early beta-blocker therapy to assess the value of adjunctive pharmacologic therapy. In the future, it is likely that studies will be carried out to determine the usefulness of thrombolytic therapy given to patients by paramedics before hospitalization. Such a study is being planned in several communities. It is hoped that by means of prehospital therapy, it may be possible to treat a substantial group of patients with symptoms and electrocardiographic findings of acute MI before extensive left ventricular myocardial necrosis has occurred. If this goal can be realized, it may be possible to achieve a very substantial reduction in mortality resulting from acute MI. Initial experience with prehospital intravenous streptokinase therapy has already been reported from Jerusalem, Israel.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "The binding of catecholamines in human serum was determined by equilibrium dialysis at 37 degrees. For serum concentrations of 10-15 nM the bound fractions were 28.8 +/- 2.2%, 25.7 +/- 1.7% and 22.2 +/- 2.2% for (+/-)-isoproterenol (IPR), (+/-)-norepinephrine (NE) and (+/-)-epinephrine (EPI), respectively. At higher serum concentrations saturation occurred. Alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) possessed one high affinity binding site and approximately 10 low affinity sites. The catecholamines were bound to AAG with the same order of potency for both classes of binding sites: IPR (Kd1: 100 microM Kd2: 2.2 mM) greater than NE (Kd1: 120 microM, Kd2: 6.5 mM) greater than EPI (Kd1: 140 microM, Kd2: 14 mM). Human serum albumin (HSA) and lipoproteins (SLP) interacted with the catecholamines in a non-saturable manner. IPR showed the strongest and EPI the weakest association to both of these serum protein fractions. (-)-Propranolol was able to inhibit the binding of IPR in serum and to isolated AAG, but not to HSA or to SLP. The present results show that AAG is an important catecholamine-binding protein in human serum. AAG, but not HSA or SLP, possesses binding sites shared by adrenergic receptor stimulators and blockers.", 
    "24": "A \"specific bradycardic agent\" has direct negative chronotropic actions without producing other systemic or coronary hemodynamic alterations. UL-FS 49, a recently synthesized structural analog of verapamil without classical slow channel calcium blocking activity, is proposed as such an agent. The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the hemodynamic and electrocardiographic actions of UL-FS 49 (0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 mg/kg) and compare its effects with those of propranolol (0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 mg/kg) in conscious or isoflurane-anesthetized (with and without neuromuscular blockade by pancuronium) chronically instrumented dogs. In six groups, comprising 52 experiments, UL-FS 49 was found to be more efficacious than propranolol in reducing heart rate, although this agent did not block the hemodynamic response to isoproterenol. UL-FS 49 produced 45-50% reductions in heart rate in dogs with isoflurane-induced tachycardia as compared to 15 and 30% reductions following propranolol. Furthermore, few other hemodynamic alterations were produced by UL-FS 49 indicating the remarkable specificity of this drug for reducing heart rate. A \"specific bradycardic agent\" such as UL-FS 49 may be useful clinically during the perioperative period. Such a drug may be especially advantageous for patients with documented or suspected ischemic heart disease, those who cannot tolerate the side effects of beta adrenergic blockade, as well as patients requiring a greater reduction in heart rate than can be obtained with beta adrenergic receptor antagonists.", 
    "25": "The effect of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol on morbidity and mortality risk after acute myocardial infarction was studied relative to coronary anatomy and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction in a subset of 406 patients participating in a randomized study of 3,837 patients in the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT). Median follow-up for this subset of patients was 28 months. The mortality rate was 2% (2 of 100) in patients with 2- and 3-vessel coronary artery disease taking propranolol and 10% (12 of 126) in those taking placebo (p less than 0.02). In patients with 2- and 3-vessel coronary artery disease with decreased LV function (defined as ejection fraction less than 50%), no patient taking propranolol died, whereas 17% (7 of 42) taking placebo died (p less than 0.04). The salutary effect of propranolol on mortality in the larger BHAT after acute myocardial infarction also was evident in this population studied in regard to their coronary and LV anatomy and function.", 
    "26": "p,p'-DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane; 75 mg/kg) or corn oil was administered po to male Fischer 344N rats. Tremor was quantified 8 hr later by spectral analysis of whole body movements. The effect of sc injection of pharmacological challenges on the spectral profile of body movements was determined. The alpha antagonist phenoxybenzamine decreased the intensity of movements over most of the power spectra in animals exposed to DDT, but decreased spectral power only at lower frequencies in control subjects. The alpha-1 antagonist prazosin had similar effects in animals given DDT. The alpha-2 antagonist yohimbine and the beta antagonist propranolol produced lethality and increased the intensity of movements in animals administered DDT, without significantly affecting control animals. The alpha-2 agonist clonidine decreased the spectral profile over a wide range of frequencies in animals exposed to DDT, while depressing the spectral power of control animals only at higher frequencies. The dopamine antagonist haloperidol increased the intensity of movements in DDT-treated animals, without altering the spectral profile of controls. The dopamine agonist apomorphine induced stereotypy in control animals, but failed to significantly alter the power spectra in subjects given DDT. These data suggest a facilitatory and inhibitory role, respectively, for alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors in the modulation of DDT-induced tremor. Dopamine and beta receptors may be involved in the tonic inhibition of tremor produced by DDT.", 
    "27": "Previously, we found resting metabolic rate increased at high altitude but the mechanism and consequences of this increase were unclear. We sought to test the role of beta-sympathetic activation for increasing metabolic rate and the contribution of an increase in metabolic rate to raising total ventilation at altitude. Following baseline studies at sea level, two groups of six healthy male subjects received either placebo or propranolol (80 mg/8 h) for 3 days prior to ascent to Pikes Peak (4300 m) where treatment was continued for 15 days. O2 consumption increased in placebo-treated subjects with a rise of 20 +/- 5% (X +/- SEM) on day 1 and no change 0 +/- 7% in propranolol-treated subjects (difference between groups, P less than 0.05). The increase in total ventilation upon ascent was 28 +/- 2% in the placebo group vs 9 +/- 7% in the propranolol group (P less than 0.05) and was correlated with metabolic rate in individual subjects. Decreasing end-tidal PCO2, taken as an index of ventilatory acclimatization, was similar in both groups. Thus, beta-sympathetic activation appears to increase metabolic rate upon ascent to high altitude and lead to a proportionate elevation in total ventilation but does not alter ventilatory acclimatization.", 
    "28": "The interplay of heart rate variability, baroreceptor control of heart rate, and blood pressure (BP) variability was examined in chronically instrumented, unanesthetized, freely moving rats in which the efferent neural influences on heart rate were pharmacologically altered. In each rat, BP was recorded continuously for 90 minutes in the control condition and in one or more of the following conditions: 1) beta-adrenergic receptor blockade by propranolol, 1 mg/kg; 2) cholinergic blockade by atropine, 0.75 mg/kg, and 3) combined blockade by propranolol plus atropine. Each BP recording was analyzed beat-to-beat by a computer that calculated heart rate and BP variabilities, both expressed as variation coefficients. In addition, under each condition the sensitivity of the arterial baroreceptor control of heart rate was assessed by measuring the reflex changes in pulse interval in response to BP changes induced by bolus i.v. injections of phenylephrine and nitroprusside. As compared with the control condition, 1) propranolol (n = 10) reduced heart rate variability by 23 +/- 4% (p less than 0.01), only slightly impaired baroreceptor reflex sensitivity, and did not significantly modify BP variability (+11 +/- 7%); 2) atropine (n = 11) reduced heart rate variability by 30 +/- 7% (p less than 0.01), drastically impaired baroreceptor reflex sensitivity, and increased BP variability (+40 +/- 8%, p less than 0.01); 3) combined blockade (n = 10) caused variability and baroreceptor reflex changes similar to those induced by atropine alone. Thus, heart rate variability depends on both vagal and sympathetic influences. However, only the former component affects BP variability, that is, it plays an antioscillatory role.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "An elderly, mildly demented, hypertensive male patient developed hypersomnolence on administration of propranolol for treatment of hypertension; no other cause for hypersomnolence was detected. Upon replacement of propranolol with atenolol, he felt better but continued to be quite somnolent. When atenolol was discontinued, he reported to have lack of sleep. On readministration of subtherapeutic doses of the same beta-adrenergic blocking agents, he once again experienced excessive sleepiness. By discontinuing beta-blocking agents and introducing captopril, he felt much better, became pleasant and talkative, and blood pressure was well controlled. Beta antagonists are important drugs in the management of many cardiovascular problems. Propranolol, a lipophilic beta-blocking agent, and atenolol, a hydrophilic beta-blocking agent, are two of the major agents currently used clinically in the United States. Numerous neuropsychiatric side-effects of the beta-adrenergic blocking drugs have been reported, but hypersomnolence is not readily recognized as one of them.", 
    "30": "The cardiovascular effects of the administration of nifedipine and nifedipine combined with propranolol were examined in 15 monkeys during 0.75 and 1.25 MAC of anesthesia with isoflurane, enflurane, or halothane. Hemodynamic variables measured included heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), maximum rate of increase of the Left ventricular pressure (max LV dP/dt), and thermodilution cardiac output (CO). The infusion of nifedipine at a rate adequate to produce therapeutic blood levels during 0.75 MAC with each anesthetic decreased MAP and SVR, but had no effect on cardiac index (CI), max LV dP/dt, or HR. Increasing the anesthetic concentration from 0.75 to 1.25 MAC during nifedipine administration decreased HR and MAP in all groups and decreased CI with halothane and enflurane, but not with isoflurane. Addition of propranolol by infusion in amounts adequate to produce 75% beta-adrenergic blockade caused a further depression of CI, max LV dP/dt, HR, and MAP. However, the hemodynamic depression was significantly greater with halothane and enflurane than with isoflurane. Intravenous administration of calcium chloride (10 mg/kg) after calcium channel and beta-adrenergic blockade only partially reversed the hemodynamic depression that occurred with all three anesthetics. It was concluded that acute loading with nifedipine with and without propranolol exerts a greater cardiovascular depressant effect during enflurane or halothane anesthesia than during isoflurane anesthesia. The myocardial depressant effects of nifedipine and propranolol myocardial depressant effects of nifedipine and propranolol may be synergistic with the depressant effects of potent inhalation anesthetics.", 
    "31": "The effects of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) on gastric emptying of a saline solution was further investigated in six dogs prepared with gastric fistulas and chronic cerebroventricular guides and in four other dogs with chronic gastric fistulas and pancreatic (Herrera) cannulas. Intravenous infusion of CRF significantly inhibited gastric emptying whereas intracerebroventricular injection of CRF had no effect. Pharmacologic blockade of beta-adrenergic system by propranolol did not modify intravenous CRF induced delay in gastric emptying. Intravenous CRF did not influence basal pancreatic secretion whereas secretin infused stimulated bicarbonate secretion. These results indicate that intravenous but not intracerebroventricular administration of CRF inhibited gastric emptying of a saline solution in dogs. The inhibitory effect of intravenous CRF on gastric emptying is not mediated by the beta-adrenergic nervous system, and not secondary to the release of other peptides that affect both pancreatic secretion and gastric emptying such as cholecystokinin and peptide YY.", 
    "32": "Antihypertensive medications are all associated with adverse reactions, and the elderly patient may be particularly sensitive. In a large longitudinal follow up study in an aged population, beta-blockers were shown to have caused no greater impairment of cognitive function or mood when compared to a control population. alpha-Methyldopa did interfere with some measures of neuropsychological functioning.", 
    "33": "Effect of halothane on sinus rhythm was investigated using a direct perfusion technique of the canine SA node artery in situ. Halothane was dissolved in a fat emulsion and administered to the SA node artery in doses between 148.8 micrograms and 2976 micrograms. Both the solvent itself and a stabilizer of halothane produced no change in the heart rate. Halothane induced a biphasic chronotropic response in all doses: an initial sinus acceleration of 2 to 5 sec duration followed by a long-lasting sinus deceleration. Both responses were dose-related. The positive response was not substantially affected by prior administration of propranolol or tetrodotoxin or in reserpinized dogs. Atropine or tetrodotoxin also failed to cause any change in the negative response. Therefore, both responses were assumed to have resulted from a direct action of halothane on the SA node, but the detailed mechanism underlying the positive response remains to be further clarified.", 
    "34": "Lung endothelial binding sites of N-isopropyl-123I-p-iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) were assessed employing the principle of competitive binding assay adapted for in vivo measurement using a computer-scintillation camera technique. A noninvasive modification of the Chinard-Crone technique was applied to the study of pulmonary extraction. 123I-IMP, the test cellular tracer and 99Tcm-dextran the vascular reference tracer were used in dogs to determine the first pass pulmonary extraction of 123I-IMP. The lung extraction of 123I-IMP decreases progressively from 90 to 62% as the amount of propranolol (administered 10 min prior to the injection of 99Tcm-dextran) gradually increased from 0 to 20 mg. The dissociation constant of 123I-IMP lung binding sites reaction in the presence of propranolol was calculated by Scatchard plot and found to be 10 mg. The in vivo procedure described in this paper will enable us to develop a model for the assay of the binding sites in the lungs for amine and its influence in both health and disease.", 
    "35": "In the anaesthetised dog there is prolonged attenuation of cardiac vagal action following electrical stimulation of the cardiac sympathetic nerve or intravenous injection of neuropeptide Y (NPY). The effect survives alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade, and is not mimicked by exogenous noradrenaline. Guanethidine blocks the attenuation of cardiac vagal action following sympathetic stimulation but not after injection of NPY. It is suggested that NPY is released from cardiac sympathetic neurons with noradrenaline following activation of the sympathetic nerve and inhibits cardiac vagal action.", 
    "36": "Treatment of hypertension is changing rapidly because drugs with greater specificity are being developed and knowledge is evolving concerning factors that determine responses to available drugs. For almost a decade US physicians have relied on national guidelines called Stepped-Care. Step 1 calls for using either a diuretic or a beta blocker; in subsequent steps other drugs are added. Because of the new drugs and the new knowledge it is likely that Step 1 will soon be broadened to include many other drugs. The short-term changes in Step-1 will be based upon those factors now known to influence pressure responsiveness: age--young vs old; race--black vs white; type--renovascular vs essential; and severity--mild-to-moderate vs severe. In young hypertensives, much evidence suggests a dominant neurogenic component of central origin; therefore, a central sympatholytic drug or an alpha-beta receptor blocker seem to be preferable as firstline drugs. Hypertension, primarily systolic, in elderly patients responds well to diuretics or calcium channel blockers. Mild-to-moderate hypertension in blacks is particularly responsive to diuretics, while beta blockers are relatively ineffective. Renovascular hypertension is predominantly caused by increased angiotensin II, so converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is indicated in unilateral stenosis. The hallmark of severe hypertension is vasoconstriction, so a vasodilator (nifedipine, minoxidil, or an ACE inhibitor) is indicated as first treatment, not a diuretic or a beta blocker alone. Long term changes will depend on development of drugs with specificity for newly, or better defined, pressor mechanisms.",

    "38": "The release from a matrix (polyethylenmineral oilgel, Plastibase) with drug (bupranolol) in suspension can be controlled by a controlling layer of the same material which is saturated with the drug. Thus, after a burst period zero order release is reached from the laminate, before square root t-kinetics predominate. The duration of constant release may be extended with fillers in the controlling layer (glass beads, d less than 20 microns). Increasing the thickness of the controlling layer increases both duration of constant release and time to reach it, the latter to a lower extent.", 
    "39": "Tianeptine is a tricyclic agent provided with antidepressant activity in experimental models and in clinical trials. In vitro tianeptine and its two principal metabolites have no effects on monoamine uptake, release or neurotransmitter receptor binding. The biochemical effect of tianeptine in vivo after acute or repeated treatment indicates an enhanced serotonin uptake in cortex and hippocampus but not in mesencephalon, with no effect on noradrenaline or dopamine uptake. This enhanced serotonin uptake is not due to decrease in serotonin release, but is related to increase in the Vmax of the uptake carrier for serotonin. The fact that enhancers as well as inhibitors of serotonin uptake are provided with antidepressant activity challenge simple conclusion as to their mechanism of action. The possibility that increased serotonin uptake after repeated treatment may be related to the antidepressant activity exerted by these drugs, and drugs enhancing serotonin uptake might have antidepressant activity, with an earlier onset, is proposed.", 
    "40": "The efficacy of nitrosorbide, corinfar and obsidan in preventing myocardial ischemia, induced by exercise or intravenous dipyridamole, was evaluated in 20 coronary patients. Nitrosorbide was found to be the most effective, and obsidan, the least effective, drug in preventing the steal syndrome. It is suggested that the efficiency of anti-anginal drugs is based on their effect on coronary flow control as well as hemodynamic determinants of myocardial oxygen requirements. The dipyridamole test can be used for the assessment of the effects of antianginal agents.",

    "42": "1. The antiplatelet effects of a single oral dose of the calcium entry blocker diltiazem (60 mg), the beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol (40 mg), and their combination were studied in five healthy subjects. 2. Platelet aggregation and ATP release induced by adrenaline and ADP and ADP induced platelet thromboxane A2 generation were significantly inhibited (P less than 0.05) by either diltiazem or propranolol, although propranolol tended to have greater inhibitory effects on platelet function than diltiazem that did not reach statistical significance. 3. Combination therapy resulted in additive antiplatelet effects that were significantly (P less than 0.05) greater than either drug alone. 4. These data indicate that combined administration of a calcium entry blocker and a beta-adrenoceptor blocker results in additive inhibitory effects on platelet function. These effects may mediate part of the therapeutic efficacy of combination therapy in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "43": "The addition of propranolol to mexiletine may reduce the adverse effects of mexiletine and possibly increase its efficacy. We compared the cellular electrophysiologic effects of this combination with mexiletine and propranolol alone, over concentration ranges of 3.2 to 100 microM mexiletine and 0.80 to 25.0 microM propranolol, using standard microelectrode techniques and a stimulation frequency of 1.5 Hz. Mexiletine and propranolol both depressed the rate of rise of phase 0 (Vmax) with concentration-response curves of similar slope and a relative potency of 8:1, propranolol to mexiletine. Thus, combinations of 8:1 molar ratios of mexiletine to propranolol were assessed. The combination depressed Vmax to the same extent as mexiletine or propranolol alone. Mexiletine, propranolol and the combination all shortened action potential duration (APD) to the same extent. At low concentration mexiletine, propranolol and the combination shortened effective refractory period (ERP). At 25 microM mexiletine, this effect reversed and ERP began lengthening. The effect of the combination paralleled mexiletine while with propranolol alone the reversal did not occur until the highest concentration was reached. Mexiletine prolonged ERP relative to APD, an effect not shared by propranolol and attenuated with the combination (P less than 0.05). We conclude that combining propranolol with mexiletine does not alter any of the cellular electrophysiologic effects of mexiletine except the prolongation of ERP relative to APD. Although this may be an important antiarrhythmic effect, the extent by which in vivo concentrations of propranolol may reduce the clinical antiarrhythmic efficacy of mexiletine is likely to be negligible.", 
    "44": "This double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-period cross-over study was undertaken to evaluate the sustained-release characteristics of long-acting propranolol hydrochloride (Inderal LA, Ayerst Laboratories, New York, NY) 60 mg qd, to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of this formulation with conventional propranolol 20 mg tid, and to evaluate the proportionality of long-acting propranolol 60 mg (LA 60 mg) and long-acting propranolol 80 mg (LA 80 mg). Pharmacodynamic effects were evaluated in 34 healthy subjects by assessing heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and the product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure (double product) after exercise-induced tachycardia following both acute (day 1) and steady state (day 4) drug administration. The Cmax following administration of LA 60 mg was 9.5 and 11.4 ng/mL on days 1 and 4, respectively, compared with 18.8 and 20.0 ng/mL with 20 mg tid (P less than .0001). The tmax for LA 60 mg was significantly later (P less than .0001) than for conventional propranolol. Additionally, the apparent plasma half-life was significantly longer (P less than .0001) than with conventional propranolol. The LA 60-mg formulation was dose proportional to the LA 80-mg formulation. Pharmacodynamic evaluations showed no significant differences between LA 60 mg and 20 mg tid at any times tested with either acute or steady state dosing. This study demonstrates that LA 60 mg displays characteristics of a sustained-release formulation, is proportional with LA 80 mg, and produces pharmacodynamic effects that are similar to 20-mg tid dosing.", 
    "45": "Plasma pharmacokinetics of a single IV dl-propranolol dose (8 mg) were investigated in 12 obese subjects (mean +/- SD: 110.3 +/- 20.4 kg; 198.7 +/- 32.5% of ideal body weight) and compared with those of 12 healthy subjects (66.7 +/- 6.8 kg; 94.5 +/- 7.8% of ideal body weight). In obese subjects plasma alpha-1 glycoprotein acid concentrations and propranolol protein binding capacity did not differ significantly from control subjects. When compared with controls, obese subjects showed a significant increase (P less than .01) in AUC (161.0 +/- 67.0 vs 109.6 +/- 23.1 hr.micrograms/L), and significant decreases (P less than .01) in Vss (208.9 +/- 71.9 vs 318.6 +/- 91.8 L), V beta (234.3 +/- 70.4 vs 340.7 +/- 89.1 L), and total clearance (57.5 +/- 18.3 vs 75.9 +/- 15.4 L/hr). Elimination half-life was similar for the two populations (3.5 +/- 0.9 hr in obese subjects vs 3.1 +/- 0.9 hr in controls). Therefore, neither lipophilicity of propranolol nor drug plasma protein binding can explain these data. Altered hepatic function and tissue blood flow in obese subjects are proposed as an explanation for the decrease in total clearance and volume of distribution.", 
    "46": "To evaluate whether imidazole salicylate, a recently developed NSAID, can interfere with the antihypertensive effect of atenolol and to compare its action with that of indomethacin, 9 essential hypertensives, while on prolonged (more than 1 month) treatment with atenolol (100 mg qd) received, according to a double-blind cross-over study, imidazole salicylate (750 mg t.i.d.) or indomethacin (50 mg b.i.d. plus a placebo tablet) for 1 week, reverting the treatment after a 2-week wash-out period. While indomethacin addition significantly increased blood pressure, when compared to atenolol alone, imidazole salicylate did not change it. These data show that imidazole salicylate, unlike indomethacin, does not reduce the antihypertensive effect of atenolol.", 
    "47": "1. Using conventional microelectrode techniques for the intracellular recordings of the membrane potential, the effects of labetalol were studied on cardiac Purkinje, atrial and ventricular muscle fibres of the dog. 2. Labetalol (1-10 microM) reduced, in a concentration-dependent manner, the action potential amplitude (APA) and the maximum rate of rise of the action potential (Vmax) in Purkinje fibres. 3. The action potential duration (APD) was decreased in Purkinje fibres but significantly increased in ventricular fibres after small concentrations of labetalol (1-3 microM). The atrial fibres were not very sensitive to labetalol. 4. Depolarization of the cardiac Purkinje fibres by increasing the external potassium concentration (8-12 mM), potentiated the labetalol effects on APA and Vmax but blocked its effects on the APD. 5. The effects of labetalol on Vmax of Purkinje fibres were dependent on the frequency of stimulation. 6. The ratio of the effective refractory period to the APD was increased both in normally polarized and depolarized Purkinje fibres after treatment with labetalol (10 microM). 7. Labetalol (10 microM) shifted the membrane responsiveness curve of Purkinje fibres by about 10 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction. 8. The slow response obtained in K-depolarized, Ba-treated Purkinje fibres was not significantly affected by labetalol (10-100 microM). 9. It is suggested that labetalol can exert Class I and Class III antiarrhythmic actions in cardiac muscle of the dog in vitro.", 
    "48": "Noradrenaline induced changes in the distribution of blood flow in implanted tumour and normal liver tissue was measured using blood flow tracer microspheres. The ratio of embolised microspheres in tumour compared to normal tissue was determined before and after the intravenous infusion of noradrenaline, propranolol and a combination of the two drugs. The ratio was significantly decreased by noradrenaline alone but significantly increased when propranolol was added to the infusate. Propranolol had no effect on the ratio. The drug combination increased the tumour to normal ratio by approximately 69% and also doubled the proportion of microspheres entering the internal tumour circulation. This represents an enhanced relative blood supply to tumour and would provide a means of preferential carriage of blood borne cytotoxic agents to tumour tissue rather than normal tissue.", 
    "49": "A double-blind, stratified and randomized multicentre trial was carried out to compare the antihypertensive efficacy of nitrendipine with that of propranolol. The dose of nitrendipine was 5-20 mg b.d., and of propranolol, 40-120 mg b.d. With nitrendipine (N = 137), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) fell from 156 +/- 1 to 140 +/- 1 mmHg and from 101 +/- 0 to 89 +/- 1 mmHg respectively (mean +/- SEM) (P less than 0.0001). On propranolol (N = 138), SBP fell from 156 +/- 1 to 144 +/- 2 mmHg and DBP decreased from 101 +/- 0 to 91 +/- 1 mmHg (P less than 0.0001). In a subgroup of 11 patients on nitrendipine, mean 24-hour SBP dropped from 137 +/- 4 to 128 +/- 4 mmHg and DBP fell from 92 +/- 2 to 87 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than 0.01). On propranolol, mean 24-hour SBP and DBP were decreased from 142 +/- 4 to 128 = 4 mmHG (P less than 0.05) and from 89 +/- 2 to 84 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than 0.09), respectively. Plasma renin activity was not altered significantly by nitrendipine (N = 89), but was significantly reduced from 1.86 +/- 0.24 to 1.37 +/- 0.75 ng ml-1 h-1 by propranolol (N = 88, P less than 0.002). Plasma renin activity was inversely correlated with age, but was not related to the reduction of SBP or DBP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "The hypothesis that calcium channel blockers can potentiate and prolong the anti-nociceptive effects of opioids was tested. Forty-five men scheduled for aorto-coronary bypass operation received fentanyl according to their individual demands (haemodynamics, clinical parameters). The patients were allocated at random into three groups receiving either nimodipine 1.0 microgram kg-1 min-1 (Group 1, n = 15), nifedipine 0.70 microgram kg-1 min-1 (Group 2, n = 15), or no calcium channel blocker (Group 3, n = 15). Cerebral activity was monitored using a computerized spectral analysing system before and during the operation. The total amount of fentanyl required was significantly lower in the nimodipine group than the control group (-71%, P less than 0.001), whereas the nifedipine group did not differ from the control group. Quality of intra-operative anaesthesia was comparable in the three groups with respect to clinical observations (amnesia, sweat, tears, pupils), and the post-operative course was similar in all patients as well. Cerebral activity during the nimodipine-supplemented opioid anaesthesia was higher in the faster frequency bands (13-30 Hz). Power level in the beta range was most pronounced in Group 1, whereas power in the alpha range was similar in the calcium channel-blocker groups. The major conclusion was that nimodipine but not nifedipine administration can reduce fentanyl requirements during surgical procedures without influencing the quality of anaesthesia.", 
    "51": "The main aim of the trial was to determine whether drug treatment of mild hypertension (phase V diastolic pressure 90-109 mm Hg) reduced the rates of stroke, of death due to hypertension, and of coronary events, in men and women aged 35-64 years. A total of 17,354 patients was recruited, and 85,572 patient-years of observation accrued. Patients were randomly allocated at entry to take bendrofluazide or placebo, or propranolol or placebo. The stroke rate was reduced with treatment (60 strokes, vs 109 in the placebo groups), being 1.4 and 2.6 per 1,000 patient-years of observation, respectively (p less than 0.01), but overall rates of coronary events were not different (222 with treatment and 234 with placebos). The incidence of all cardiovascular events was reduced with treatment (286 events, vs 352 with placebos; p less than 0.05). For rates of mortality from all causes, treatment made no difference. Several post hoc analyses of subgroup results were performed. The all-cause mortality was reduced in men on treatment (157 deaths, vs 181 in placebo groups) but increased in women on treatment (91 deaths, vs 72 with placebos); this difference between the sexes was significant (p = 0.05). The reduction in stroke rate was greater with bendrofluazide than with propranolol (p = 0.002). The rate of strokes was reduced in both smokers and non-smokers taking bendrofluazide, but only in non-smokers taking propranolol; this difference between the drugs was significant (p = 0.03). The coronary-event rate was not reduced by bendrofluazide, whatever the smoking habit, nor in smokers taking propranolol, but it was reduced in non-smokers taking propranolol.

    "52": "Esmolol is an intravenous beta blocker with a short duration of action. The pharmacokinetics of esmolol and its acid metabolite, ASL-8123, were studied in nine patients who had stable, biopsy-proved Laennec's cirrhosis and in three normal volunteer controls. Kinetics were determined after a four-hour continuous infusion of esmolol at a rate of 200 micrograms/kg/min. Blood samples were collected during the infusions and at frequent intervals thereafter. The parameters studied were the steady state concentration, the total body clearance, the elimination half-life, the area under the curve, and the volume of distribution. No significant differences in any of these parameters were detected between control subjects and those with hepatic disease, for either esmolol or its acid metabolite. It is concluded from this study that Laennec's cirrhosis does not cause any change in the pharmacokinetics of esmolol or its major metabolite. Therefore, adjustments in dosage of esmolol are not required for patients with Laennec's cirrhosis.", 
    "53": "The comparative effects of contractile agonists and physiological stimulation of the tracheal and bronchial smooth muscle (BSM) response were studied isometrically in situ in five Basenji-greyhound (BG) and six mongrel dogs. Frequency-response curves generated by bilateral stimulation of the vagus nerves (0-20 Hz, 15-20 V, 2-ms duration) elicited greater maximal contraction in mongrel trachea (36.8 +/- 8.1 vs. 26.9 +/- 4.0 g/cm; P less than 0.02) and exhibited greater responsiveness in mongrel BSM (half-maximal response to electrical stimulation 3.0 +/- 1.1 vs. 7.0 +/- 0.5 Hz; P less than 0.05) compared with BG dogs. However, muscarinic sensitivity to intravenous methacholine (MCh) was substantially greater in BG dogs; MCh caused contraction greater than 1.5 g/cm at a mean dose of 3.0 X 10(-10) mol/kg for BG dogs compared with 5.1 X 10(-9) mol/kg for mongrel controls (P less than 0.03, Mann-Whitney rank-sum test). In contrast to the muscarinic response, the contractile response elicited by intravenous norepinephrine after beta-adrenergic blockade was similar in trachea and bronchus for both mongrel and BG dogs. Our data confirm previous in vitro demonstration of tracheal hyporesponsiveness in BG dogs and demonstrate that the contraction resulting from efferent parasympathetic stimulation is less in the BG than mongrel dogs. However, postsynaptic muscarinic responsiveness of BG BSM is substantially increased. We conclude that a component of airway responsiveness in BG dogs depends directly on contractile forces generated postsynaptically that are nongeometry dependent, postjunctional, and agonist specific.", 
    "54": "To investigate the effect of the autonomic nervous system on the thermic response to food ingestion, respiratory exchange measurements were performed on seven healthy young men for 1 h and 45 min before and 6 h after ingestion of a mixed meal, approximately 560 kcal, 53% carbohydrate, 30% fat, and 17% protein (control) and under the same conditions during infusion of either propranolol (80 micrograms/kg bolus and 1 microgram.kg-1.min-1), atropine (10 micrograms/kg and 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), or atropine plus propranolol. The postabsorptive resting metabolic rates were the same on each occasion and were slightly altered by drug treatment. The thermic responses to the meal were the same with the control and propranolol tests (9.3 +/- 0.9 and 9.2 +/- 0.5%, respectively) and were greater (P less than 0.001) than with atropine 3.6 +/- 0.6% and atropine plus propranolol 3.3 +/- 0.8%. Blockade of the sympathetic nervous system does not decrease the thermic response to food taken orally, whereas muscarinic receptor blockade does. Although some confounding effects of atropine might explain some of this decrease, our results suggest that the parasympathetic nervous system is involved in the thermic effect of food.", 
    "55": "To determine the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on the submaximal stress test after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 36 post-AMI patients performed their treadmill test on 2 separate days, with and without metoprolol, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study. Rest and peak submaximal exercise heart rate was diminished by 100 mg of metoprolol administered twice daily (from 84 +/- 3 to 68 +/- 2 beats/min, p less than 0.001, and from 126 +/- 3 to 97 +/- 2 beats/min, p less than 0.001, respectively) compared with placebo. Rest and peak submaximal systolic blood pressure was also decreased (from 121 +/- 3 to 108 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.001, and from 151 +/- 4 to 124 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Exercise-induced ST-segment depression of 1 mm or more from baseline occurred in 12 patients taking placebo. However, only 4 of these patients had ST depression when they exercised while taking metoprolol (p less than 0.05). Angina pectoris occurred in 4 patients taking placebo but in only 1 of these taking a beta-blocking drug. It is concluded that beta-blocking therapy renders the post-AMI submaximal stress test less sensitive for markers of exercise-induced ischemia than if the test is performed without the drug. Therefore, when using the prognostic information of published studies, it is important to define the conditions surrounding the exercise test.", 
    "56": "The antihypertensive efficacy and effect on maximal exercise performance of diltiazem was evaluated and compared with atenolol in patients specifically selected on the basis of their being young and physically active. Diltiazem (sustained-release preparation, 90 mg twice daily) was administered to 14 patients (aged 33 +/- 2 years) and atenolol (50 mg once daily) to 13 patients (aged 30 +/- 2 years) with essential hypertension in a 16-week randomized, double-blind, parallel study. The 2 drugs had comparable antihypertensive effects at rest, with mean decreases of 18 and 17 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) for supine and standing diastolic blood pressure (BP), respectively, during diltiazem treatment, and mean decreases of 21 and 18 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) during atenolol treatment. During maximal graded exercise testing, systolic BP, diastolic BP, heart rate and heart rate-BP product were significantly reduced by both drugs. However, the reductions in systolic BP, heart rate and heart rate-BP product during exercise were considerably greater (p less than 0.001) with atenolol than with diltiazem. Maximal exercise performance was essentially unchanged with diltiazem and slightly (3%, p less than 0.05) reduced with atenolol. Thus, diltiazem is effective and well-tolerated single therapy for young patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension who lead a physically active life style and compares favorably with atenolol.", 
    "57": "The effect of acetylcholine on the aconitine induced delayed afterdepolarisation and triggered electrical activities under nominally calcium free conditions were studied in frog atrium and ventricle. The changes in intracellular potassium activity were also examined. The aconitine induced delayed afterdepolarisation and triggered electrical activities in atrial muscles were transiently suppressed by acetylcholine. This inhibition was correlated with the time course of the development of hyperpolarisation in the resting membrane potential during acetylcholine application. Propranolol did not abolish the transient inhibition of delayed afterdepolarisation during continuous application of acetylcholine, whereas atropine completely inhibited this effect of acetylcholine. Intracellular potassium activity decreased with time after acetylcholine application, whereas the resting potential became hyperpolarised at an early stage, showing slow recovery thereafter. These results indicate that the transient inhibition of delayed afterdepolarisation by acetylcholine is associated with transient hyperpolarisation of the membrane potential, which is assumed to be caused by potassium accumulation or desensitisation of the muscarinic receptor, or both.", 
    "58": "A 63-year-old woman was treated medically for primary hyperparathyroidism because of a recent myocardial infarction. She received propranolol alone or combined with either cimetidine, calcitonin or disodium etidronate (EHDP). The treatment did not affect the elevated serum parathormone or urinary cyclic AMP levels, nor did it correct the elevated serum 1,25(OH)2D and the decreased serum 24,25(OH)2D levels in this patient. Propranolol combined with either cimetidine or with EHDP (600 mg/day) caused a mild decrease in the serum calcium level which, however, remained within the hypercalcemic range. Following surgery all parameters returned to normal. We conclude that the above medical regimens were incapable of correcting the hyperparathyroid condition in this patient.", 
    "59": "In view of existing reports documenting that \"in vitro\" norepinephrine (NE) contracts ring-shaped rat aortic preparations, whereas it relaxes arterial strips mounted in longitudinal fashion within an organ bath: it was decided to explore possible reasons which may account for such disparate actions of the same agonist on the same tissue. Isolated rings (circular preparations) obtained from rat thoracic aortae responded to increasing concentrations of NE with dose-dependent tonic enhancement, not significantly affected by the presence of indomethacin (10(-6)M); whereas, preincubation with phentolamine (10(-6)M), yohimbine (10(-7)M) or prazosin (10(-8)M), shifted significantly to the right points of the positive inotropic dose-response curve for NE. On the contrary longitudinally mounted preparations of rat aortic stips, reacted to increasing concentrations of NE with dose-dependent relaxation, an effect not modified by the presence of a beta-adrenoreceptor blocker, namely propranolol (10(-6)M). However, in presence of alpha-adrenoreceptor blockers, such as phentolamine (10(-6)M), yohimbine (10(-7)M) or prazosin (10(-8)M), the negative inotropic dose-response curve for NE was shifted to the right whereas in the presence of indomethacin (10(-6)M) or of tranylcypromine (2.5 x 10(-4)M), the NE-induced relaxation was either abolished or significantly displaced to the right, respectively. In another series of experiments the generation of labelled 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (the most important non-enzymatic metabolite of prostacyclin) by chopped rat aortae incubated for one hour with (1-14C)-arachidonic acid, was explored and found to be significantly enhanced by the delivery of NE (3 x 10(-6)M). The present evidence suggests that NE acting on alpha-adrenoreceptors, induces in longitudinal and in chopped arterial preparations, but not in aortic rings, an inhibitory relaxing factor, presumably produced by the endothelium. This factor is probably prostacyclin for the relaxing effects of the agonist were negatively influenced by indomethacin and by tranylcypromine, two known antagonists of PGI2 formation. In vascular rings (circular arterial preparations) the tonic stimulatory action of NE (not affected by preincubation with indomethacin) was the only evident inotropic effect of the agonist presumably because the extensive handling of the tissue as well as the anchoring procedure followed to mount arterial preparations within the bath for contractile recordings, may produce de-endothelization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "60": "Fetal sheep (n = 13) were chronically instrumented to measure temperatures in the maternal femoral artery (MAT), the amniotic fluid (AFT), the fetal brown adipose tissue (BFT) and the fetal arterial blood (DAT). Cooling loops were inserted into the amniotic cavity. In 4 fetuses osmotic minipumps delivering triiodothyronine (T3) were implanted subcutaneously. One to seven days after surgery the following results were obtained: 1) During control DAT was 0.59 +/- 0.2 degrees C (SD), BFT 0.60 +/- 0.24 degrees C and AFT 0.38 +/- 0.31 degrees C higher than MAT. T3 levels in treated fetuses were 3.4 +/- 1.5 micrograms/l. 2) Infusion of norepinephrine (NE) (5.2 +/- 0.9 micrograms/min per kg fetal body weight) with phentolamine (26.1 +/- 4.3 micrograms/min per kg) into a fetal vein did not change temperatures. 3) During cooling (-53 +/- 15 W) MAT decreased 0.45 +/- 0.3 degrees C, DAT 1.9 +/- 0.39 degrees C, BFT 1.61 +/- 0.52 degrees C and AFT 4.2 +/- 1.8 degrees C. 4) The amniotic fluid was cooled until steady state temperatures were achieved. Then propranolol (26.1 +/- 4.3 micrograms/min per kg) or suxamethonium (3 +/- 1 mg/kg) were introduced into the fetal vein. No consistent and significant changes of temperatures could be detected. It is concluded that 1) lowering the fetal core temperature by 1.6 - 1.9 degrees C and its ambient temperature (AFT) by 4.2 degrees C does not induce shivering or non-shivering thermogenesis suppressible by pharmacologic agents, 2) thermogenesis in fetal brown adipose tissue cannot be induced by NE (with or without supplemention of T3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "To determine the role of endogenous opioid peptides in the pulsatile release of gonadotropins and prolactin in the ovariectomized rat, the opiate receptor blocker, naloxone, was administered intravenously, and its effect on plasma FSH, LH and prolactin was determined by multiple sampling prior to and after injection. Naloxone produced a dose-related increase in plasma LH and to a lesser extent FSH and decreased prolactin levels in the experiment in which they were examined. Higher doses of naloxone produced a significant increase in plasma LH pulse amplitude and lengthened the interpulse interval with a consequent decrease in pulse frequency. Minimum values between pulses were also increased. There was no clear effect on FSH pulsations but pulses of prolactin were blocked. Intraventricular (third ventricle) injection of a specific anti beta endorphin antiserum (3 microliter) produced an initial decline followed by an elevation of LH but had no effect on plasma FSH. The normal rabbit serum control injections were without effect. It is hypothesized that initiation of LH pulses in the castrated rat may be related to a periodic removal of tonic beta endorphinergic tone.", 
    "62": "It has been shown that during centrifugation the modulating effect of cardioactive compounds, particularly adrenalin and obsidan, varies in similarity to that of Ca ions. The reactivity of the native actomyosin complex of the heart of white rats to such agents declines during centrifugation. This may be associated with changes in regulatory protein components through which the modulating effect of the above compounds is mediated. Differences in the reactivity to adrenalin and obsidan that persist after 2-month readaptation can be attributed to the heterogeneous recovery of properties of individual subunits of regulatory proteins.", 
    "63": "The onset and resolution of electrical and functional measures of regional myocardial ischemia were examined in nine conscious dogs during control exercise and exercise after beta-receptor blockade. The dogs had been instrumented with an ameroid constrictor and were studied when no regional dysfunction was evident at rest, although severe coronary stenosis or coronary occlusion with collateral circulation development was present. ST segment elevation was measured on subendocardial electrograms, and regional wall motion was studied by sonomicrometry. During control exercise, subendocardial myocardial blood flow in the ischemic zone, normalized to blood flow in the nonischemic zone, decreased. Subendocardial ST elevation increased slowly, was significantly different from control standing values by 2.5 minutes of exercise and returned quickly to control values within 5 minutes after exercise. Percent systolic wall thickening decreased rapidly, was significantly depressed by 1 minute of exercise and did not return to control values until 30 minutes after exercise. A second, identical exercise stress was performed on the same day after a single oral dose (1 mg/kg body weight) of atenolol. In the ischemic zone during exercise after atenolol compared with control exercise, normalized subendocardial myocardial blood flow was improved and significantly less ST elevation occurred, but the onset and resolution of ST elevation were not altered. Systolic wall dysfunction during exercise was significantly less after atenolol, and function returned toward preexercise values by 1 minute after exercise, even more rapidly than ST segment resolution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "64": "Cardiovascular drugs are often used in pregnancy for the treatment of maternal and fetal conditions. The complex physiologic changes occurring during pregnancy may significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of many drugs and, consequently, the toxicity and therapeutic response. Of special concern are the effects of maternal therapy on the fetus and the undesired translactal passage of drugs to newborns. Although the body of information regarding cardiovascular therapy in pregnancy is incomplete, some of the available data are summarized in this article.",

    "66": "An algorithm and computer program is presented that fits a largely non-parametric model to pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data; it is an extension of a recently proposed approach. A PK model relates dose to plasma concentrations (Cp), a link model relates plasma concentrations to the concentration in the effect site (Ce), a PD model relates Ce to the effect. Both the PK and the PD model are non-parametric, but the link model is parametric. The extension presented here allows modeling of PK/PD data arising from non-steady-state experiments after arbitrary dosage. In addition, several data sets from the same individual (or from different individuals) can now be analyzed simultaneously, assuming the same link model for all, but allowing either all the PD models to be the same, or all to be different.", 
    "67": "The effect of pretreatment with egg albumin was examined on the beta-adrenoceptors in guinea pig isolated trachea. Befunolol and carteolol acted as partial agonists and their pA2 values were significantly larger than their corresponding pD2 values in tracheae from both untreated guinea pigs and those treated with egg albumin, suggesting that the beta-adrenoceptors contain two different affinity sites. The Scatchard plot of specific [3H]befunolol binding showed two affinity sites of the receptor (high and low affinity sites) in tracheae from both untreated animals and those treated with egg albumin. The pKD values of befunolol for both low and high affinity sites were in agreement with their respective pD2 and pA2 values. The intrinsic activities of befunolol and carteolol and the pD2 values of the test drugs were decreased by the treatment with egg albumin. The treatment with egg albumin also decreased the total amount of the two affinity sites of the receptor without any change in affinity. The present results support the partial blockade of beta-adrenoceptors in asthma proposed by Szentivanyi.", 
    "68": "1. The diameter of, and blood flow in, the left circumflex coronary artery was measured in anaesthetized dogs and the carotid sinus reflex was stimulated by bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries (BCO) for 2 min. 2. The effect of BCO on coronary artery diameter and late diastolic coronary resistance was examined: (a) after bilateral vagotomy; (b) after vagotomy plus antagonism of beta-adrenoceptors with propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.); and (c) after vagotomy, antagonism of beta-adrenoceptors and antagonism of alpha-adrenoceptors with phentolamine (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.). 3. After vagotomy BCO increased mean arterial pressure (delta = 72 +/- 7 mmHg), heart rate (16 +/- 3 beats/min), coronary blood flow (37 +/- 11 ml/min) and coronary artery diameter (0.14 +/- 0.04 mm). Late diastolic coronary resistance initially fell (-0.26 +/- 0.13 mmHg min/ml at 30 s) but at the end of the 2 min occlusion it had returned to the baseline level (delta = 0.04 +/- 0.08 mmHg min/ml). 4. In the presence of propranolol BCO increased arterial pressure (28 +/- 12 mmHg), but did not alter heart rate (0.6 +/- 0.4 beats/min) or coronary blood flow (2 +/- 2 ml/min). There was a significant decrease in large artery diameter (-0.24 +/- 0.07 mm) and an increase in late diastolic coronary resistance (0.46 +/- 0.12 mmHg min/ml). A mechanical increase in afterload did not affect large coronary artery diameter or coronary resistance. 5. Antagonism of alpha-adrenoceptors abolished the reflex-induced constriction of the large coronary artery (delta = -0.02 +/- 0.02 mm) and the coronary resistance vessels (delta LDCR = -0.02 +/- 0.03 mmHg min ml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "We studied the cardiovascular profile of the new cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist bisoprolol in the conscious pig and compared this profile with that of propranolol. Acute i.v. administration of bisoprolol (16-1024 micrograms.kg-1) did not affect mean arterial blood pressure but caused dose-related decreases in cardiac output (from 8 to 17%; p less than 0.05) due to a negative chronotropic action (heart rate reduction ranging from 9 to 21%; p less than 0.05) as stroke volume was unaffected. Max LVdP/dt decreased (ranging from 18 to 27%; p less than 0.05) while left ventricular end-diastolic blood pressure (from 8.6 +/- 0.6 to 15 +/- 0.2 mmHg; p less than 0.05) and systemic vascular resistance (from 8 to 18%; p less than 0.05) increased. Propranolol in a dose-range from 25-300 micrograms.kg-1 produced strikingly similar changes. Bisoprolol was more effective in antagonizing the isoproterenol-induced responses of max LVdP/dt than those on either heart rate or diastolic arterial blood pressure, whereas propranolol caused equi-effective inhibitions of the responses of heart rate and max LVdP/dt. However, with propranolol also the inhibition of the diastolic arterial blood pressure was less marked than for the other parameters. Propranolol proved to be the more potent beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, as the isoproterenol dose ratios of all 3 parameters during beta-adrenoceptors blockade with propranolol exceeded those obtained with bisoprolol."
