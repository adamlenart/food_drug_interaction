We evaluated the association between baseline antihypertensive medications that may affect potassium levels (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2-blockers, loop/thiazide diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics) and hyperkalemia, defined by potassium >5 mEq/L and >5.5 mEq/L, over a 3-year time period in 194 456 outpatients in the Geisinger Health System, as well as actions taken after an episode of hyperkalemia. The proportions of patients with 0, <2, 2 to 4, and \u22654 potassium measurements per year were 20%, 58%, 16%, and 6%. Potassium levels >5 mEq/L and >5.5 mEq/L occurred in 10.8% and 2.3% of all patients over the 3-year period; among patients with \u22654 measurements per year, corresponding values were 39.4% and 14.6%. Most cases of hyperkalemia occurred only once during follow-up. The antihypertensive medication class most strongly associated with hyperkalemia was angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Among patients with a measurement of potassium >5.5 mEq/L, only 24% were seen by a nephrologist and 5.2% were seen by a dietician during the 3-year period. Short-term actions after a potassium measurement >5.5 mEq/L included emergency room visit (3.1% within 7 days), remeasurement of potassium (44.3% with 14 days), and change in a potassium-altering medication (26.4% within 60 days). The most common medication changes were discontinuation/dose reduction of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker or potassium-sparing diuretic, which occurred in 29.1% and 49.6% of people taking these medications, respectively. In conclusion, hyperkalemia is common. Future research may enable optimal renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor use with improved management of hyperkalemia.",

    "5": "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are controlled by 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) contributing to the steroid feedback regulation of the reproductive axis. In rodents, E2 exerts a negative feedback effect upon GnRH neurons throughout the estrus-diestrus phase of the ovarian cycle. The present study was undertaken to reveal the role of estrogen receptor subtypes in the mediation of the E2 signal and elucidate the downstream molecular machinery of suppression. The effect of E2 administration at low physiological concentration (10 pM) on GnRH neurons in acute brain slices obtained from metestrous GnRH-green fluorescent protein (GFP) mice was studied under paradigms of blocking or activating estrogen receptor subtypes and interfering with retrograde 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) signaling. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings revealed that E2 significantly diminished the frequency of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) in GnRH neurons (49.62 \u00b1 7.6%) which effect was abolished by application of the estrogen receptor (ER) \u03b1/\u03b2 blocker Faslodex (1 \u03bcM). Pretreatment of the brain slices with cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) inverse agonist AM251 (1 \u03bcM) and intracellularly applied endocannabinoid synthesis blocker THL (10 \u03bcM) significantly attenuated the effect of E2 on the sPSCs. E2 remained effective in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) indicating a direct action of E2 on GnRH cells. The ER\u03b2 specific agonist DPN (10 pM) also significantly decreased the frequency of miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs) in GnRH neurons. In addition, the suppressive effect of E2 was completely blocked by the selective ER\u03b2 antagonist PHTPP (1 \u03bcM) indicating that ER\u03b2 is required for the observed rapid effect of the E2. In contrast, the ER\u03b1 agonist PPT (10 pM) or the membrane-associated G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPR30) agonist G1 (10 pM) had no significant effect on the frequency of mPSCs in these neurons. AM251 and tetrahydrolipstatin (THL) significantly abolished the effect of E2 whereas AM251 eliminated the action of DPN on the mPSCs. These data suggest the involvement of the retrograde endocannabinoid mechanism in the rapid direct effect of E2. These results collectively indicate that estrogen receptor beta and 2-AG/CB1 signaling mechanisms are coupled and play an important role in the mediation of the negative estradiol feedback on GnRH neurons in acute slice preparation obtained from intact, metestrous mice.", 
    "6": "Severe paroxysmal sympathetic overactivity occurs in a subgroup of patients with acquired brain injuries including traumatic brain injury, hypoxia, infection and tumor-related complications. This condition is characterized by sudden increase of heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, body temperature and excessive diaphoresis. The episodes may be induced by external stimulation or may occur spontaneously. Frequent occurrence of this condition could result in secondary morbidities, therefore, should be diagnosed and managed insightfully. These symptoms could be confused with seizures or other medical conditions, leading to unnecessary treatment. Despite clinical significance of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH), brain tumor-induced PSH has not been studied nearly. In this report, two cases of the PSH in patients with brainstem-compressing benign tumors were introduced. The most useful pharmacologic agents were opioid (e.g., fentanyl patch) in preventing PSH attack, and nonselective \u03b2-blocker (e.g., propranolol) in relieving the symptoms. Clinical experiences of the rare cases of benign tumor-induced PSH can be helpful as an essential basis for further research.",

    "16": "Melatonin, a hormone secreted by the pineal gland, possesses multiple biological activities such as antitumor, antioxidant, and anti-ischemia. C-kit(+) cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) have emerged as a promising tool for the treatment of heart diseases. However, the senescence of CPCs due to pathological stimuli leads to the decline of CPCs' functions and regenerative potential. This study was conducted to demonstrate whether melatonin antagonizes the senescence of CPCs in response to oxidative stress. Here, we found that the melatonin treatment markedly inhibited the senescent characteristics of CPCs after exposed to sublethal concentration of H2 O2 , including the increase in senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal)-positive CPCs, senescence-associated heterochromatin loci (SAHF), secretory IL-6 level, and the upregulation of p53 and p21 proteins. Senescence-associated proliferation reduction was also attenuated by melatonin in CPCs. Luzindole, the melatonin membrane receptor blocker, may block the melatonin-mediated suppression of premature senescence in CPCs. Interestingly, we found that long noncoding RNA H19 and its derived miR-675 were downregulated by H2 O2 in CPCs, but melatonin treatment could counter this alteration. Furthermore, knockdown of H19 or miR-675 blocked antisenescence actions of melatonin on H2 O2 -treated CPCs. It was further verified that H19-derived miR-675 targeted at the 3'UTR of USP10, which resulted in the downregulation of p53 and p21 proteins. In summary, melatonin antagonized premature senescence of CPCs via H19/miR-675/USP10 pathway, which provides new insights into pharmacological actions and potential applications of melatonin on the senescence of CPCs.",

    "22": "What is the central question of this study? Thyroid dysfunction can have a major impact on pancreatic function. The influence of hyperthyroidism on insulin secretion remains controversial, and the precise mechanism of its effect has not yet been elucidated. What is the main finding and its importance? The results of this study demonstrate that hyperthyroidism leads to impaired insulin secretion. It appears that the defect in insulin secretion in the hyperthyroid state probably reflects a summation of different alterations, including decreased sensitivity of ATP-sensitive K(+) and L-type Ca(2+) channels of the \u03b2-cells and reduced \u03b2-cell mass. To clarify the mechanism underlying the effect of thyroid hormone excess on pancreatic insulin secretion and abnormal glucose tolerance induced by hyperthyroidism, we investigated the effect of hyperthyroidism on the pancreatic \u03b2-cell mass and two key components of the insulin secretory pathway, ATP-sensitive K(+) (KATP ) and L-type Ca(2+) channels. In control and levothyroxine-treated hyperthyroid rats, an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed, and the insulin secretion and content of the isolated islets were assayed. In order to determine the effect of hyperthyroidism on KATP and L-type Ca(2+) channels, isolated islets were exposed to specific pharmacological agents, including glibenclamide (KATP channel blocker), diazoxide (KATP channel opener) and nifedipine (L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker). Histomorphometric changes and histochemistry of the islet in both groups were compared. Our data indicated that plasma glucose and insulin concentrations during the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test in the hyperthyroid group were, respectively, higher and lower than in the control group. Insulin secretion and content of the hyperthyroid islets were reduced. The response of hyperthyroid islets to glibenclamide, diazoxide and nifedipine and the percentage change in insulin secretion were lower than those of the control islets. Despite the increase in weight and total volume of the pancreas, the volume of the islets and the total number of insulin-positive cells in hyperthyroid rats were reduced. Our data indicated that reduced insulin secretion in the hyperthyroid group might arise from reduced \u03b2-cell mass and an abnormality in some parts of the insulin secretory pathway, including KATP and L-type Ca(2+) channel function.", 
    "23": "Paediatric pharmaceutics has become an important topic, but currently, there is an incomplete knowledge of paediatric gastrointestinal physiology and adequate biopharmaceutical tools still have to be developed. The present study aimed to increase the understanding of oral drug absorption in paediatric populations by using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling and in vitro dissolution testing. The oral absorption of two model compounds, sotalol and paracetamol, was studied by collection of reported pharmacokinetic profiles from adult and paediatric subjects. A PBPK model based on input parameters collected from the literature was first developed and validated in adults before being extrapolated to paediatric age groups. The accuracy of the model simulations was assessed by comparison to the observed pharmacokinetic profiles, and in the case of discrepancy, further investigations were made via parameter sensitivity analysis and in vitro dissolution testing. The PBPK models accurately predicted sotalol and paracetamol exposure in adult populations. An accurate simulation was also obtained after model extrapolation to children older than 2 years of age. However, the simulation in infants and newborns resulted in a discrepancy, which was further analysed. Dissolution testing suggested no significant difference in the drug release rate between paediatric and adult age groups. In contrast, mean gastric emptying time seemed to be underestimated in infants and newborns, and optimisation of this input parameter improved the prediction of the model. Considering age-specific differences in gastrointestinal tract physiology should improve prediction of drug absorption in paediatric patients.",

Angina outcomes were heart rate at rest or peak, exercise duration, and time to angina onset.Seven articles were selected. There were 3747 patients: 2100 and 1647 were in the ivabradine and control groups, respectively. The ivabradine group had significantly longer exercise duration when they had been treated for at least 3 months, but not when treatment time was less than 3 months. Ivabradine significantly improved time to angina onset regardless of treatment duration. Control group type did not influence the effect of exercise duration (significant) or time to angina onset (significant).Compared with beta-blocker and placebo, ivabradine improved exercise duration and time to onset of angina in patients with stable angina.

Coronary artery aneurysms evolve dynamically over time, usually reaching a peak dimension by 6 weeks after illness onset. Almost all the morbidity and mortality occur in patients with giant aneurysms. Risk of myocardial infarction from coronary artery thrombosis is greatest in the first 2 years after illness onset. However, stenosis and occlusion progress over years. Indeed, Kawasaki disease is no longer a rare cause of acute coronary syndrome presenting in young adults.

    "27": "Background: Guidelines have special importance in medicine, however, it is questionable to what extent these recommendations are applied in daily care, and under which conditions claims data can be used for verification of guideline adherence. Method: Advantages and limitations of claims data for verification of guidelines compliance in the therapeutic area as well as the guidelines themselves were analysed and critically assessed. To substantiate these results, claims data of a major German health insurance fund (Techniker Krankenkasse) were analysed. Results: 104\u2009236 patients were identified. With certain limitations, claims data are useful for verifying guideline adherence; it could be shown that in pharmacotherapy the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker was used to the highest extent (70.5%). In contrast, only 56.4% of patients were treated with pure ACE inhibitors and ACE combined preparation. Conclusion: In order to validate guideline adherence by means of claims data analyses, a number of conditions relating to the database, the therapeutic area and the guidelines themselves have to be considered. Guideline recommendations, which, for example, are based on clinical data, cannot be reviewed by using claims data. Despite these limitations, claims data provide a suitable tool for reviewing selected guideline recommendations. They show that the current use of pharmacotherapy as well as clinical and diagnostic interventions might be increased in accordance with the guideline recommendations.",

Our previous studies show that living in an enriched environment (EE) providing complex stimuli confers an anticancer phenotype in mice mediated, in part by a specific neuroendocrine axis, with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as the key brain mediator. Here, we investigated how an EE modulated T-cell immunity and its role in the EE-induced anticancer effects. Our data demonstrated that CD8 T cells were required to mediate the anticancer effects of an EE in an orthotropic model of melanoma. In secondary lymphoid tissue (SLT), an EE induced early changes in the phenotype of T-cell populations, characterized by a decrease in the ratio of CD4 T helper to CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Overexpression of hypothalamic BDNF reproduced EE-induced T-cell phenotypes in SLT, whereas knockdown of hypothalamic BDNF inhibited EE-induced immune modulation in SLT. Both propranolol and mifepristone blocked the EE-associated modulation of CTLs in SLT, suggesting that both the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis were involved. Our results demonstrated that enhanced anticancer effect of an EE was mediated at least in part through modulation of T-cell immunity and provided support to the emerging concept of manipulating a single gene in the brain to improve cancer immunotherapy.

A premix of metoprolol tartrate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and filler (ratio 20/20/60, w/w) was granulated with demineralized water via twin screw granulation. After oven drying and milling, tablets were produced on a rotary Modul\u2122 P tablet press.

The torque was dominated by the number of kneading elements and throughput, whereas screw speed and filling degree only showed a minor influence on torque. Addition of screw mixing elements after a block of kneading elements improved the yield of the process before milling as it resulted in less oversized granules and also after milling as less fines were present. Temperature was also an important parameter to optimize as a higher temperature yielded less fines and positively influenced the aspect ratio. The shape of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose granules was comparable to that of immediate release formulations. Tensile strength and friability of tablets were not dependent on the process parameters. The use of starch as filler was not beneficial with regard to granule and tablet properties. Complete drug release was obtained after 16-20h and was independent of the design's parameters.",

The clinical development of NR2B NAMs would benefit from a translational pharmacodynamic biomarker that demonstrates brain penetration and functional inhibition of NR2B receptors in preclinical species and humans. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) is a translational measure that can be used to demonstrate pharmacodynamic effects across species. NMDA receptor channel blockers, such as ketamine and phencyclidine, increase the EEG gamma power band, which has been used as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in the development of NMDA receptor antagonists. However, detailed qEEG studies with ketamine or NR2B NAMs are lacking in nonhuman primates. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects on the qEEG power spectra of the NR2B NAMs traxoprodil (CP-101,606) and BMT-108908 in nonhuman primates, and to compare them to the NMDA receptor channel blockers, ketamine and lanicemine. Cynomolgus monkeys were surgically implanted with EEG radio-telemetry transmitters, and qEEG was measured after vehicle or drug administration. The relative power for a number of frequency bands was determined. Ketamine and lanicemine increased relative gamma power, whereas the NR2B NAMs traxoprodil and BMT-108908 had no effect. Robust decreases in beta power were elicited by ketamine, traxoprodil and BMT-108908; and these agents also produced decreases in alpha power and increases in delta power at the doses tested. These results suggest that measurement of power spectra in the beta and delta bands may represent a translational pharmacodynamic biomarker to demonstrate functional effects of NR2B NAMs. The results of these studies may help guide the selection of qEEG measures that can be incorporated into early clinical evaluation of NR2B NAMs in healthy humans.",

Triple-negative (TN) brain-metastatic cells were found to have increased \u03b22-adrenergic receptor mRNA and protein expression relative to TN primary cells. In response to \u03b22-adrenergic receptor activation, TN brain-metastatic cells also exhibited increased cell proliferation and migration relative to the control. These effects were abrogated by propranolol. Propranolol decreased \u03b22-adrenergic receptor-activated invasion. In\u00a0vivo, propranolol treatment of TN brain-metastatic cells decreased establishment of brain metastases.

E2 increased 12 and 15LO mRNA expression by 2-3 folds and elicited an acute 50% increase 12 and 15 hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) production. Neither estrogen receptor ER\u03b1 nor ER\u03b2-specific agonists were able to reproduce the induction of LO expression, but E2-induced expression was effectively blocked by ER non-specific and receptor subtype specific antagonists. Because 12 and 15HETE can increase reactive oxygen species in other cell types, we tested the possibility that E2 could raise ROS through LO. Indeed, E2 as well as the LO products 12 and 15HETE increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in VSMC. E2-dependent and HETE-induced ROS could be blocked by NAD (P) H-oxidase inhibitors and by the ER general antagonist ICI. E2-induced ROS was partially (\u223c50%) blocked by the LO inhibitor baicalein, but the LO blocker had no effect on 12 or 15HETE- induced ROS formation, thus suggesting that part of E2-dependent ROS generation resulted from E2-induced 12 and 15HETE. Collectively these findings unveil an unrecognized effect of E2 in human VSMC, to induce 12 and 15LO type 2 expression and activity and suggest that E2-dependent ROS formation in VSMC may be partially mediated by the induction of 12 and 15HETE.",

We used an atrial electrical remodeling model of the rabbit, subjected to rapid atrial pacing (RAP; 600\u00a0beats/min) for 2-4 weeks, leading to shortening of atrial effective refractory period (AERP). Intravenous administration of dl-sotalol (6\u00a0mg/kg), bepridil (1\u00a0mg/kg), amiodarone (10\u00a0mg/kg) or vernakalant (3\u00a0mg/kg) significantly prolonged the AERP both in the control and RAP rabbits.

In the SHIFT trial, ivabradine was shown to improve the outcome of patients with chronic HF, in sinus rhythm, with HR >70 b/min while on beta-blockers. Preliminary data have shown that this drug has a good safety profile and lowers effectively HR even during hospitalization due to worsening HF. However, further studies are warranted to understand if an earlier administration of ivabradine can lead to a better prognosis beyond symptom control and improved hemodynamics. In patients with atrial fibrillation and HF, the target is the restoration of sinus rhythm, alternatively rate control should be pursued with beta-blockers, amiodarone or digitalis, even if there is no clear evidence of an association between ventricular rate response in patients with atrial fibrillation at discharge after an HF hospitalization and major cardiovascular events. In this review, the studies that point to a role of HR both as a biomarker and a therapeutic target in patients with acute and chronic HF are described. In addition, the proportions of patients who do not reach target HR values at discharge after an acute decompensated HF episode or in the chronic phase are evaluated based on the Italian registries.",

    "88": "Despite the large differences in the epidemiology of hypertension across Europe, treatment strategies are similar for national populations of white European descent. However, hypertensive patients of African or South Asian ethnicity may require ethnic-specific approaches, as these population subgroups tend to have higher blood pressure at an earlier age that is more difficult to control, a higher occurrence of diabetes, and more target organ damage with earlier cardiovascular mortality. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the evidence on antihypertensive drug treatment in South Asian and African ethnicity patients. We used the Cochrane systematic review methodology to retrieve trials in electronic databases including CENTRAL, PubMed, and Embase from their inception through November 2015; and with handsearch. We retrieved 4596 reports that yielded 35 trials with 7 classes of antihypertensive drugs in 25,540 African ethnicity patients. Aside from the well-known blood pressure efficacy of calcium channel blockers and diuretics, with lesser effect of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, nebivolol was not more effective than placebo in reducing systolic blood pressure levels. Trials with morbidity and mortality outcomes indicated that lisinopril and losartan-based therapy were associated with a greater incidence of stroke and sudden death. Furthermore, 1581 reports yielded 16 randomized controlled trials with blood pressure outcomes in 1719 South Asian hypertensive patients. In contrast with the studies in African ethnicity patients, there were no significant differences in blood pressure lowering efficacy between drugs, and no trials available with mortality outcomes. In conclusion, in patients of African ethnicity, treatment initiated with ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker monotherapy was associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We found no evidence of different efficacy of antihypertensive drugs in South Asians, but there is a need for trials with morbidity and mortality outcomes. Screening for cardiovascular risk at a younger age, treating hypertension at lower thresholds, and new delivery models to find, treat and follow hypertensives in the community may help reduce the excess cardiovascular mortality in these high-risk groups.", 
    "89": "Fungi colonizing cadavers are capable of drug metabolism and may thus change the metabolite pattern or concentration of drugs in forensic postmortem samples. The purpose of this study was to check for the presence of such changes by searching fungi-specific metabolites of four model drugs (amitriptyline, metoprolol, mirtazapine, and zolpidem) in decomposed postmortem blood samples from 33 cases involving these drugs. After isolation and identification of fungal strains present in the samples, each isolate was incubated in Sabouraud medium at 25\u00b0C for up to 120h with each model drug. One part of the supernatants was directly analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), another after liquid-liquid extraction with chlorobutane and concentration. From 21 out of 33 decomposed postmortem blood samples (64%) a total of 30 different strains could be isolated, one from the class of Ascomycete and the rest belonging to 15 species from 8 different genera (number of species): Aspergillus (2), Botrytis (1), Candida (8), Fusarium (1), Mucor (1), Penicillium (1), and Rodothorula (1). In the in vitro studies, these microorganisms were found capable of N-demethylation and N-oxidation of amitriptyline and mirtazapine, O-demethylation followed by side chain oxidation of metoprolol as well as hydroxylation of all four-model drugs. In two of the postmortem blood samples, from which the fungi Aspergillus jensenii, Candida parapsilosis. and Mucor circinelloides had been isolated, a fungi-specific hydroxy zolpidem metabolite was detected. The presence of this metabolite in postmortem samples likely indicates postmortem fungal biodegradation.",

We examined the effects of systemic propranolol administration in mice undergoing a wide range of behavioral tests to determine more specifically which aspects of the memory consolidation and reconsolidation are impaired by propranolol. We found that propranolol (10 mg/kg) affected memory consolidation in non-aversive tasks (object recognition and object location) but not in moderately (Morris water maze (MWM) to highly (passive avoidance, conditioned taste aversion) aversive tasks. Further, propranolol impaired memory reconsolidation in the most and in the least aversive tasks, but not in the moderately aversive task, suggesting its amnesic effect was not related to task aversion. Moreover, in aquatic object recognition and location tasks in which animals were forced to behave (contrary to the classic versions of the tasks); propranolol did not impair memory reconsolidation. Taken together our results suggest that the memory impairment observed after propranolol administration may result from a modification of the emotional valence of the memory rather than a disruption of the contextual component of the memory trace. This is relevant to the use of propranolol to block memory reconsolidation in individuals with PTSD, as such a treatment would not erase the traumatic memory but only reduce the emotional valence associated with this event.",

In vitro CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibition by MET, HM and ODM study revealed that MET, HM and ODM were not inhibitors of CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam metabolism and CYP2D6-catalyzed dextromethorphan metabolism. However, DIM only met the criteria of >10% of the total drug related material and <25% of the parent using unbound concentrations. If CYP inhibition testing is solely based on metabolite exposure, DIM metabolite would probably not be considered.

SAN function and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of sodium channels and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel subunits were assessed in sham-operated rats, abdominal arterio-venous shunt (volume overload)-induced HF rats, and bisoprolol- treated HF rats. SAN cells of rats were isolated by laser capture microdissection. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was used to quantify mRNA expression of sodium channels and HCN channel subunits in SAN.

    "179": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial and multifaceted disease for which we currently have very little to offer since there is no curative therapy, with only limited disease-modifying drugs. Recent studies in AD mouse models that recapitulate the amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) pathology converge to demonstrate that it is possible to salvage cerebrovascular function with a variety of drugs and, particularly, therapies used to treat cardiovascular diseases such as hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. These drugs can reestablish dilatory function mediated by various endothelial and smooth muscle ion channels as well as nitric oxide availability, benefits that result in normalized brain perfusion. These cerebrovascular benefits would favor brain perfusion, which may help maintain neuronal function and, possibly, delay cognitive failure. However, restoring cerebrovascular function in AD mouse models was not necessarily accompanied by rescue of cognitive deficits related to spatial learning and memory. The results with cardiovascular therapies rather suggest that drugs originally designed to treat cardiovascular diseases that concurrently restore cerebrovascular and cognitive function do so through their pleiotropic effects. Specifically, recent findings suggest that these drugs act directly on brain cells and neuronal pathways involved in memory formation, hence, working simultaneously albeit independently on neuronal and vascular targets. These findings may help select medications for patients with cardiovascular diseases at risk of developing AD with increasing age. Further, they may identify molecular targets for recovering memory pathways that bear potential for new therapeutic avenues.",

Medications that increase the duration of opening of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptors are most consistently associated with tremor improvement. Interestingly, drugs that increase GABA availability have not been associated with improved tremor. Other mechanisms possibly associated with tremor improvement include antagonism of alpha-2 delta subunits associated with calcium channels, inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, and inhibition of the synaptic vesicle protein 2A. Drugs that block voltage-gaited sodium channels do not affect tremor. The ideal beta-adrenergic blocker requires B2 affinity (non-cardiac selective), has no sympathomimetic properties, does not require membrane stabilization properties, and may benefit from good central nervous system penetration.",

    "201": "The role of NO-ergic mechanisms in the realization of the respiratory effects of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta was investigated in acute experiments on anesthetized rats. To achieve this, we studied the effect of intravenous administration of IL-1beta during inhibition of NO-synthase by N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, a non-specific blocker of NO-synthase) on the parameters of breathing and the Hering-Breuer inspiratory-inhibitory reflex. It was shown that the effect of L-NAME eliminates the IL-1beta-dependent increase of the Hering-Breuer reflex, whereas effects on breathing pattern does not change: the increase in IL-1beta system-level evokes an increase in respiratory rate, tidal volume and lung ventilation. It is assumed that one of the mechanisms of enhance in the strength inspiratory-inhibitory reflex by increasing circulatory IL-1beta level is the increased glutamate-ergic transmission on pump-neurons induced by increase in nitric oxide synthesis in cerebrovascular endothelial cells. In conclusion, NO-ergic mechanisms participate in the modulation of the vagal respiratory reflexes during the development of the acute phase of systemic inflammation.", 
    "202": "Hyperglycemia and hypertension impair endothelial function in part through oxidative stress-activated poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). Biguanides and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) such as metformin and telmisartan have a vascular protective effect. We used cultured vascular endothelial cells (ECs), diabetic and hypertensive rodent models, and AMPK\u03b12-knockout mice to investigate whether metformin and telmisartan have a beneficial effect on the endothelium via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation of PARP1 and thus inhibition of PARP1 activity. The results showed that metformin and telmisartan, but not glipizide and metoprolol, activated AMPK, which phosphorylated PARP1 Ser-177 in cultured ECs and the vascular wall of rodent models. Experiments using phosphorylated/de-phosphorylated PARP1 mutants show that AMPK phosphorylation of PARP1 leads to decreased PARP1 activity and attenuated protein poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation), but increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity and silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) expression. Taken together, the data presented here suggest biguanides and ARBs have a beneficial effect on the vasculature by the cascade of AMPK phosphorylation of PARP1 to inhibit PARP1 activity and protein PARylation in ECs, thereby mitigating endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "203": "Recent large clinical trials have refuted earlier suggestions from the Joint National Committee 8 committee that less aggressive targets for blood pressure control were all that could be justified in most hypertensive patients. It now does appear that in fact \"lower is better,\" with blood pressure targets < 120/80 mm Hg appropriate for many hypertensive patients. Two drug combinations are often indicated as initial therapy if a 20/10 mm Hg or greater blood pressure reduction is necessary to reach target. Combinations consisting of \u03b2-blockers and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors have previously been deemed \"less effective,\" based on partially overlapping mechanisms of action and limited clinical trial evidence. Nebivolol is a vasodilating \u03b21-selective blocker and \u03b23- adrenoceptor agonist; \u03b23-adrenoceptor activation increases nitric oxide concentrations and thus explains the vasodilatory effect. A recent 8-week randomized trial (N=4,161) in individuals with stage 1-2 hypertension demonstrated that single-pill fixed dose combinations (FDC) of nebivolol and valsartan, an angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor blocker, were more effective in reducing blood pressure than the corresponding monotherapies, with comparable tolerability. In addition, an ABPM-biomarkers substudy from that trial (n=805) demonstrated that the FDC prevented a valsartan-induced increase in plasma renin activity, and that the nebivolol/valsartan 20/320 mg/day dose reduced plasma aldosterone concentration significantly more than valsartan 320 mg/day. This article will describe the properties of nebivolol that make it unique and separate it from other \u03b2-blockers, and will further support the pharmacological advantages of this particular combination.",

Additionally, ISO treatment produced a significant increase in the expression of myocardial CaMKII\u03b42 and CaMKII\u03b43 that were associated with significant elevation in myocardial caspase-3 protein expression. Histopathological examination of rats exposed to ISO treatment showed severe myocardial cell degeneration. ALS and/or CAV treatment significantly reduced the altered HW/BW ratio, serum CK-MB and Tn-T levels, PRA, and caspase-3 protein expression in hypertrophied rats, with maximal improvement in the combination group. These biochemical findings were supported by the histopathological examination of the heart tissue.

    "209": "The purpose of this work was to analyze the deformability properties of different timolol maleate (TM)-loaded transfersomes by extrusion. This was performed because elastic liposomes may contribute to the elevation of amount and rate of drug permeation through the corneal membrane. This paper describes the optimization of a transfersome formulation by use of Taguchi orthogonal experimental design and two different statistical analysis approaches were utilized. The amount of cholesterol (F1), the amount of edge-activator (F2), the distribution of the drug into the vesicle (F3), the addition of stearylamine (F4) and the type of edge-activator (F5) were selected as causal factors. The deformability index, the phosphorous recovery, the vesicle size, the polydispersity index, the zeta potential and percentage of drug entrapped were fixed as the dependent variables and these responses were evaluated for each formulation. Two different statistical analysis approaches were applied. The better statistical approach was determined by comparing their prediction errors, where regression analysis provided better optimized responses than marginal means. From the study, an optimized formulation of TM-loaded transfersomes was prepared and obtained for the proposed ophthalmic delivery for the treatment of open angle glaucoma. It was found that the lipid to surfactant ratio and type of surfactant are the main key factors for determining the flexibility of the bilayer of transfersomes. From in vitro permeation studies, we can conclude that TM-loaded transfersomes may enhance the corneal transmittance and improve the bioavailability of conventional TM delivery.", 
    "210": "Although the pathophysiological mechanisms of arterial hypertension are different in obese and lean patients, hypertension guidelines do not include specific recommendations for obesity-related hypertension and, therefore, there is a considerable uncertainty on which antihypertensive drugs should be used in this condition. Moreover, studies performed in general population suggested that some antihypertensive drugs may increase body weight, glycemia and LDL-cholesterol but it is unclear how this impact on drug choice in clinical practice in the treatment of obese hypertensive patients. Therefore, in order to identify current preferences of practitioners for obesity-related hypertension, in the present work we evaluated antihypertensive drug therapy in a cohort of 129 pharmacologically treated obese hypertensive patients (46 males and 83 females, aged 51.95\u2009\u00b1\u200910.1 years) that came to our observation for a nutritional consultation.",

In patients under single drug therapy, \u03b2-blockers, ACEIs and ARBs accounted each for about 25 % of prescriptions. The prevalence of use of \u03b2-blockers was about sixfold higher in females than males. Diuretics were virtually never used in monotherapy regimens but were used in more than 60 % of patients on dual antihypertensive therapy and in all patients assuming three or more drugs. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of use of any of the aforementioned drugs among patients with obesity of type I, II and III or between patients with or without metabolic syndrome.", 
    "213": "Our data show that no first choice protocol seems to be adopted in clinical practice for the treatment of obesity-related hypertension.

    "214": "The aim of this study was to develop, evaluate and compare extended release mini-matrices based on metoprolol tartrate (MPT) and either glyceryl behenate (GB) or glyceryl palmitostearate (GPS). Mini-matrices were produced by three different techniques: hot melt extrusion, compression of melt granulates and prilling. Hot-melt extrusion and compression of granules obtained from melted material proved to be reliable, robust and reproducible techniques with aim of obtaining extended release matrices. Prilling tended to be susceptible to increased melt viscosity. Direct compression was not applicable for mini-matrix production due to poor powder flow. In general MPT release from all matrices was affected by its loading and the size of the units/particles. Processing of GB-MPT mixtures by different techniques did not lead to different drug release rates and patterns, while in case of GPS differently obtained matrices provided diverse MPT release outcomes. Matrices based on GB tended to have higher porosity compared to ones composed of GPS and thus most of the GB-based formulations showed faster drug delivery. FT-IR analysis revealed no interactions between primary components used for matrix production and Raman mapping outlined uniform MPT distribution throughout the units. DSC and X-ray studies revealed significant changes in the crystallinity of glycerides after storage under room conditions (GPS samples) and at increased temperature (GB and GPS samples), which was correlated to the changes seen in drug release rate and pattern after storage. Media composition in general tended to insignificantly affect GB matrices, while in case of GPS matrices increasing the pH and presence of biorelevant compounds induced faster drug release.", 
    "215": "CKD is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Thus, patients with CKD often require treatment with cardiovascular drugs, such as antiplatelet, antihypertensive, anticoagulant, and lipid-lowering agents. There is significant interpatient variability in response to cardiovascular therapies, which contributes to risk for treatment failure or adverse drug effects. Pharmacogenomics offers the potential to optimize cardiovascular pharmacotherapy and improve outcomes in patients with CVD, although data in patients with concomitant CKD are limited. The drugs with the most pharmacogenomic evidence are warfarin, clopidogrel, and statins. There are also accumulating data for genetic contributions to \u03b2-blocker response. Guidelines are now available to assist with applying pharmacogenetic test results to optimize warfarin dosing, selection of antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention, and prediction of risk for statin-induced myopathy. Clinical data, such as age, body size, and kidney function have long been used to optimize drug prescribing. An increasing number of institutions are also implementing genetic testing to be considered in the context of important clinical factors to further personalize drug therapy for patients with CVD.",

Glaucoma refers to a group of related eye disorders that have in common an optic neuropathy associated with visual function loss. It is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide. Glaucoma can damage vision gradually so it may not be noticed until the disease is at an advanced stage. Early diagnosis and treatment can minimize or prevent optic nerve damage and limit glaucoma-related vision loss. Nowadays, research continues for the improvement of current medical treatment.", 
    "217": "An efficient chiral liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry method has been developed for the determination of metoprolol (MTP) and three of its major metabolites, namely O-desmethylmetoprolol (O-DMTP), \u03b1-hydroxymetoprolol (\u03b1-HMTP) and metoprolol acid (MTPA) in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents and effluents. The optimized analytical method has been validated with good quality parameters including resolution >1.3 and method quantification limits down to the ng/L range except for MTPA. On the basis of this newly developed analytical method, the stereochemistry of MTP and its metabolites was studied over time in effluent/sediment biotic and sterile microcosms under dark and light conditions and in influents and effluents of 5 different WWTPs. MTP stereoselective degradation was exclusively observed under biotic conditions, confirming the specificity of enantiomeric fraction variations to biodegradation processes. MTP was always biotransformed into MTPA with a (S)-enantiomer enrichment. The results of enantiomeric enrichment pointed the way for a quantitative assessment of in situ biodegradation processes due to a good fit (R(2)\u00a0>\u00a00.98) of the aerobic MTP biodegradation to the Rayleigh dependency in all the biotic microcosms and in WWTPs because both MTP enantiomers followed the same biodegradation kinetic profiles. These results demonstrate that enantiomeric fractionation constitutes a very interesting quantitative indicator of MTP biodegradation in WWTPs and probably in the environment.",

    "228": "The purpose of this study was to develop Carvedilol nanostructured lipid carriers (CAR-NLCs) using stearic acid and oleic acid as lipid, and to estimate the potential as oral delivery system for poorly water soluble drug. The particle-size analysis revealed that all the developed formulations were within the nanometer range. The EE and loading were found to be between 69.45-88.56% and 9.58-12.56%, respectively. The CAR-NLCopt showed spherical morphology with smooth surface under transmission electron microscope (TEM). The crystallization of the drug in NLC was investigated by powder X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and revealed that the drug was in an amorphous state in the NLC matrix. The ex vivo gut permeation study showed many folds increment in the permeation of CAR-NLCs compared to Carvedilol suspension (CAR-S). The oral bioavailability study of CAR was carried out using Wistar rats and relative bioavailability of CAR-NLCopt was found to be 3.95 fold increased in comparison with CAR-S. In vivo antihypertensive study in Wistar rats showed significant reduction in mean systolic BP by CAR-NLCopt vis-\u00e0-vis CAR-S (p\u2009<\u20090.05) owing to the drug absorption through lymphatic pathways. In conclusion, the NLC formulation remarkably improved the oral bioavailability of CAR and demonstrated a promising perspective for oral delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs. The promising findings in this investigation suggest the practicability of these systems for the enhancement of bioavailability of CAR."
