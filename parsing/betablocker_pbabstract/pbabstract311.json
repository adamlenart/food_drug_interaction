Therefore, the effect of beta-blocking with metoprolol for prevention of supraventricular arrhythmias (SVA) was investigated in a prospective and randomized trial. 200 patients after CABG were randomized in a drug and control group (average age 63.2 years, 154 male, 46 female). Patients of the drug group (n=100) were treated with metoprolol (1mg/kg/BW) beginning on day one after operation, whereas patients of the control group (n=100) received therapy only in case of occurrence of atrial fibrillation. ECG, blood pressure, and electrolyte concentrations were measured regularly until the tenth day after surgery. Reasons for exclusion were an ejection fraction (< 30%, SA- and AV-block or simultaneous application of epinephrine and metoprolol. There were no significant differences between the patients of drug and control group with respect to age, sex ejection fraction, previous medication, number and type of bypass grafts, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and perioperative ischemic events. However, a statistically significant difference was seen in the occurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias in both groups, 4 patients of the therapy group (4%) in contrast to 37 patients of the control (37%) developed supraventricular arrhythmias during the postoperative observation period (p<0.0001). Both groups differed in total time of hospital stay by 1.5 days (control group: 9.83+/-2.88 days; drug group: 8.42+/-2.81 days), which was statistically significant (p<0.05). All patients of the drug group could be discharged with a stable sinus rhythm, whereas 7 patients of the control group were discharged with persistent atrial fibrillation. The difference was statistically significant as well (p<0.01). Neither typical side effects of metoprolol, nor AV-blocks, bradycardia (f<60/min) or symptoms of low blood pressure could be observed. The conclusion of this trial is a recommendation for a preventive application of 50mg metoprolol/day after coronary artery bypass surgery, which can reduce the incidence of SVA as well as the hospital stay statistically significant.",

    "7": "During myocardial ischaemia the beta-adrenoceptor is activated, which contributes, at least partly, to cardiac arrhythmias via inducing [Ca2+]i oscillations. Since beta-adrenoceptor is negatively modulated by the kappa-opioid receptor in the heart, the present study attempted to determine if kappa-opioid receptor stimulation modulates the arrhythmogenic action of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation and to delineate the underlying mechanism. The effect of U50,488H, a selective kappa-opioid agonist, on arrhythmias in the isolated perfused rat heart subjected to low flow and 10(-6)mol/l norepinephrine (NE) were determined. Low flow induced arrhythmias, which were potentiated by NE, but not by 10(-6)mol/l U50,488H. The arrhythmia-potentiating effect of NE was antagonized by 10(-6)mol/l propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. U50,488H at 10(-6)mol/l also abolished the potentiation in arrhythmias by NE without affecting the arrhythmias induced by low flow. The anti-arrhythmic action of the kappa-opioid receptor agonist was abolished by 10(-6)mol/l nor-binaltorphimine, a selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonist, but not by 10(-7)mol/l calphostin C, an inhibitor of protein kinase C. Similarly, kappa-opioid receptor stimulation with U50,488H also abolished the NE-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations which are believed to cause cardiac arrhythmias, in ventricular myocytes. To determine whether the inhibitory actions of U50,488H against the effects of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation was via a cAMP-dependent or a cAMP-independent pathway, we determined the effects of U50,488H on NE-enhanced cAMP production and [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by either forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, or Bay K-8644, a selective L-type Ca2+ channel agonist, in the ventricular myocytes. We found that U50,488H abolished the effect of forskolin, but did not alter the effect of Bay K-8644, on [Ca2+]i oscillations in the ventricular myocyte. In addition, U50, 488H also attenuated significantly the NE-induced elevation in cAMP in the heart. The observations suggest that kappa-opioid receptor stimulation abolishes the effect of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation on arrhythmias and [Ca2+]i oscillation via a cAMP-dependent pathway. The finding may be useful for the prevention and treatment of ischaemic heart diseases.", 
    "8": "This study aimed to examine whether lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced increase in tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) gene transcription was regulated by beta-adrenoceptor activation and whether TNF-alpha and IL-6 gene transcription was regulated by angiotensin II in rat renal resident macrophage cells. The cells were transfected with a fusion gene with the 5'-flanking region of rat TNF-alpha or IL-6 genes linked to a luciferase coding sequence as a reporter. The stimulatory effect of LPS on TNF-alpha transcription was suppressed by isoproterenol (10(-8)-10(-5)M) in a dose-dependent manner, whereas IL-6 transcription was only decreased by the high concentration (10(-5)M) of isoproterenol. The addition of beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist (ICI118,551), but not a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist (atenolol), blocked the inhibitory effect of isoproterenol. By contrast, angiotensin II (10(-8)-10(-5)M) enhanced IL-6 gene transcription in the cells in a dose-dependent manner which was inhibited by type 1 angiotensin II receptor antagonist (CV11,974). TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion from the cells was altered with beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists (terbutaline, formoterol) and angiotensin II corresponding to changes of TNF-alpha and IL-6 gene transcription. Angiotensin II had no effect on TNF-alpha secretion and gene transcription. These findings suggested that beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist and angiotensin II potentially could influence renal immune function through the regulation of TNF-alpha and IL-6 gene transcription by the renal resident macrophage cells.", 
    "9": "Although buffer agents alone have failed to improve the success of resuscitation, we now examine the widely held concept that it is the combined effect of alkaline buffer and adrenergic agents that improves outcomes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In the present report, the effects of both CO(2)-consuming and CO(2)-generating buffer agents in combination with adrenergic vasopressor drugs were investigated. Ventricular fibrillation was electrically induced in Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 450 and 550 g. Precordial compression and mechanical ventilation were initiated after 8 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation. Animals were then randomized to receive bolus injections of either inorganic sodium bicarbonate buffer, organic tromethamine buffer, or saline placebo. The beta(1) adrenergic effects of epinephrine were blocked with esmolol. The vasopressor amine was injected 2 min after injection of the buffer agent. Electrical defibrillation was attempted at the end of 8 min of precordial compression. In 15 additional animals, the sequence of administration of the adrenergic vasopressor and buffer agents was reversed such that the adrenergic vasopressor was injected before the buffer agents. All animals were restored to spontaneous circulation. Both bicarbonate and tromethamine significantly decreased coronary perfusion pressure from 26 to 15 mm Hg and reduced the magnitude of the vasopressor effect of the adrenergic vasopressor. When the vasopressor preceded the buffer, declines in coronary perfusion pressure after administration of buffer agents were prevented. In each instance, however, greater impairment of postresuscitation myocardial function and decreased postresuscitation survival were observed after treatment with buffer agents.", 
    "10": "In a multicenter study, a long-term analysis was made of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of subcutaneous (s.c.) sumatriptan in the acute treatment of migraine attacks over a period of up to 18 months. A total of 2263 patients took part in the study, all able to perform their own acute treatment of migraine attacks at home by s.c. administration of 6 mg of sumatriptan. A headache diary was used by each patient to record the various migraine parameters before the injection and 1 h and 2 h after it. A total of 43,691 attacks were treated and analyzed during the study period from October 1991 to June 1993. Therapy was successful in 89.5% of attacks. Freedom from headache was achieved in 71.0% of cases. In 22.7% of the attacks a second injection was administered on recurrence of the headache; 82.9% of the patients achieved an intraindividual therapy success rate ranging from over 80% to 100%. In the course of treatment there was no change in either the therapy success rate or in the frequency of attacks. Some 4.9% of the patients withdrew from the study because of insufficient efficacy or adverse events. A total of 44.5% of patients reported adverse events, and these were rated serious in the case of 1.7%. S.c. administration of sumatriptan for acute migraine therapy is an effective treatment method, with reliable action, that can be used with good tolerability provided the contraindications are taken into account.", 
    "11": "Polypharmacy (the prescription of more than one therapy for a single patient) and subcutaneous (s.c.) sumatriptan tolerability were prospectively studied in 12,339 migraineurs, each followed for up to 1 year. Inclusion/exclusion criteria were minimal and mirrored United States Imitrex labeling. Drug usage and compliance monitoring were automatically interfaced with prescription refill. Concomitant drugs were used by 79% of patients, with analgesics, antidepressants, and sedatives used most commonly. No adverse interactions between sumatriptan and neurological drugs were found, possibly reflecting relative inability of the former to cross the blood-brain barrier. No difference in cardiovascular adverse events was associated with oral contraceptive use, which was more common than expected. No other drug class influenced adverse event probability, although sample sizes for these comparisons was sometimes <400 patients. This study confirms the prevalence of polypharmacy in migraine, identifies the drugs used, and concludes that, on a population basis, the tolerability of s.c. sumatriptan, when used according to labeled instructions, is unaffected by these concomitant drugs.",

    "26": "Different isoforms of the sodium/potassium adenosinetriphosphatase (Na,K-ATPase) alpha and beta subunits have been identified in mammals. The association of the various alpha and beta polypeptides results in distinct Na,K-ATPase isozymes with unique enzymatic properties. We studied the function of the Na,K-ATPase alpha4 isoform in Sf-9 cells using recombinant baculoviruses. When alpha4 and the Na pump beta1 subunit are coexpressed in the cells, Na, K-ATPase activity is induced. This activity is reflected by a ouabain-sensitive hydrolysis of ATP, by a Na(+)-dependent, K(+)-sensitive, and ouabain-inhibitable phosphorylation from ATP, and by the ouabain-inhibitable transport of K(+). Furthermore, the activity of alpha4 is inhibited by the P-type ATPase blocker vanadate but not by compounds that inhibit the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase or the gastric H,K-ATPase. The Na,K-ATPase alpha4 isoform is specifically expressed in the testis of the rat. The gonad also expresses the beta1 and beta3 subunits. In insect cells, the alpha4 polypeptide is able to form active complexes with either of these subunits. Characterization of the enzymatic properties of the alpha4beta1 and alpha4beta3 isozymes indicates that both Na,K-ATPases have similar kinetics to Na(+), K(+), ATP, and ouabain. The enzymatic properties of alpha4beta1 and alpha4beta3 are, however, distinct from the other Na pump isozymes. A Na, K-ATPase activity with similar properties as the alpha4-containing enzymes was found in rat testis. This Na,K-ATPase activity represents approximately 55% of the total enzyme of the gonad. These results show that the alpha4 polypeptide is a functional isoform of the Na,K-ATPase both in vitro and in the native tissue.", 
    "27": "Since the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and/or mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in the hippocampus have been implicated in cortisol feedback of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, abnormalities in those receptors might underlie the hyperactivity of the HPA axis described in patients with major depression. Animal studies have shown that long-term in-vivo treatment with antidepressants up-regulates hippocampal GR and/or MR, but it is not clear whether this up-regulation is evoked through a direct action of antidepressants on these receptors. We therefore examined the direct effects of long-term antidepressant treatment on GR binding and the levels of GR messenger RNA (mRNA) in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurones. The time course of the effects of the tricyclic antidepressants desipramine and amitriptyline on GR binding, as assessed by [3H]dexamethasone binding using RU 28362, a specific agonist for GR, showed a biphasic mode of stimulation: desipramine significantly increased the GR binding with 2-day exposure by 36% over that in controls and by 99% and 60% with 10- and 14-day exposures, respectively. Amitriptyline also led to a significant increase in GR binding, with peaks at 2 (by 60%) and 14 days of exposure (by 60%). The effects of 14-day treatment with desipramine required at least the first 4-day exposure, and the first 10-day exposure was required for the full effect. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the GR mRNA level was significantly increased by 14-day treatment with desipramine (+142% over control), amitriptyline (+108%), mianserin (+124%), paroxetine (+42%) and sulpiride (+92%), but not with haloperidol. Immunocytochemistry for GR revealed that 2- or 14-day treatment with desipramine significantly increased the number of GR-positive cells with dominant immunoreactivity in the nuclei of granule cell-like neurones or in perikarya of pyramidal cell- and granule cell-like neurones. These findings suggest that tricyclic antidepressants directly increase hippocampal GR by short-term (2-day) and long-term (14-day) exposure, and that the increase by long-term exposure is evoked commonly with different classes of antidepressants through transcriptional up-regulation of GR expression.", 
    "28": "Intraocular pressure (IOP) has been found to increase during microgravity. After peaking in the first few hours of orbital flight, IOP slowly decreases to a level that is slightly elevated above baseline IOP's. These modest elevations in IOP do not require treatment.

    "32": "A rapid method for determining the separation conditions for chiral resolution of eleven beta-blocking drug substances by capillary electrophoresis is described, using an experimental design approach. An acidic phosphate-triethanolamine buffer and an uncoated fused-silica capillary were used for all experiments. Several modified cyclodextrins were applied as chiral selectors: sulfobutyl ether beta-cyclodextrin (SBE-beta CD), dimethyl beta-cyclodextrin (DM-beta CD), carboxymethyl beta-cyclodextrin (CM-beta CD), and hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta CD). Two different fractional factorial experimental designs were applied: (1) a design examining four factors at three levels (3(4-2)) and (2) one examining three factors at two levels (2(3-1)). The factors studied were: type of cyclodextrin, cyclodextrin concentration, pH of the background electrolyte and percentage of organic modifier. Enough resolution for the separation of the enantiomers and even for their quantification was reached. The same scheme is proposed when a fast chiral separation method needs to be developed for other drug families.", 
    "33": "Cardiac after-load, neurohumoral reaction and the secondary cardiac hypertrophy were studied in six groups of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with abdominal aortic constriction. We found that abdominal aortic constriction above the renal arteries decreased the heart rate and cardiac output, and increased the pulse pressure. These abnormalities would return to normal after constriction ended. Captopril, propranolol and prazosin could reduce the increase of pulse pressure but still had decreased in cardiac output of rats with abdominal constriction. Aortic constriction also increased the aortic impedance and cardiac load but decreased aortic compliance. These changes could also be lessened by captopril, propranolol and prazosin. We have confirmed that aortic constriction can induce secondary cardiac hypertrophy, but the pathogenesis might be due to multiple factors.", 
    "34": "Asiaticoside (AS) derivatives were tested for potential protective effects against Abeta-induced cell death. Of the 28 AS derivatives tested, asiatic acid (AA), asiaticoside 6 (AS6), and SM2 showed strong inhibition of Abeta-induced death of B103 cells at 1 microM. The three AS derivatives were further tested for their effects on free radical injury and apoptosis. All three AS derivatives reduced H(2)O(2)-induced cell death and lowered intracellular free radical concentration, but AA showed the strongest protection. In contrast, SM2 was the most effective blocker of staurosporine-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that the three AS derivatives block Abeta toxicity by acting through different cellular mechanisms. When applied to hippocampal slices, AA, SM2, and AS6 did not alter n-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) or non-NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission, paired-pulse facilitation or induction of long-term potentiation in the field CA1. These results indicate that the three AS derivatives do not alter physiological properties of the hippocampus at the concentration that blocks Abeta-induced cell death. Therefore AS6, AA, and SM2 can be regarded as reasonable candidates for a therapeutic Alzheimer's disease drug that protects neurons from Abeta toxicity.",

Although a general framework for Wnt signalling has been elucidated, not all of the components have been identified. Here we describe a serine kinase, casein kinase I (CKI), which was isolated by expression cloning in Xenopus embryos. CKI reproduces several properties of Wnt signals, including generation of complete dorsal axes, stabilization of beta-catenin and induction of genes that are direct targets of Wnt signals. Dominant-negative forms of CKI and a pharmacological blocker of CKI inhibited Wnt signals in Xenopus. Inhibiting CKI in Caenorhabditis elegans generated worms with a mom phenotype, indicative of a loss of Wnt signals. In addition, CKI bound to and increased the phosphorylation of dishevelled, a known component of the Wnt pathway. These data indicate that CKI may be a conserved component of the Wnt pathway.",

    "41": "Using arterially perfused wedges of canine right ventricle (RV), we simultaneously recorded transmembrane action potentials from 2 epicardial and 1 endocardial sites, together with unipolar electrograms and a transmural ECG. Loss of the action potential dome in epicardium but not endocardium after exposure to pinacidil (2 to 5 micromol/L), a K(+) channel opener, or the combination of a Na(+) channel blocker (flecainide, 7 micromol/L) and acetylcholine (ACh, 2 to 3 micromol/L) resulted in an abbreviation of epicardial response and a transmural dispersion of repolarization, which caused an ST-segment elevation in the ECG. ACh facilitated loss of the action potential dome, whereas isoproterenol (0.1 to 1 micromol/L) restored the epicardial dome, thus reducing or eliminating the ST-segment elevation. Heterogeneous loss of the dome caused a marked dispersion of repolarization within the epicardium and transmurally, thus giving rise to phase 2 reentrant extrasystole, which precipitated ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Transient outward current (I(to)) block with 4-aminopyridine (1 to 2 mmol/L) or quinidine (5 micromol/L) restored the dome, normalized the ST segment, and prevented VT/VF. Conclusions-Depression or loss of the action potential dome in RV epicardium creates a transmural voltage gradient that may be responsible for the ST-segment elevation observed in the Brugada syndrome and other syndromes exhibiting similar ECG manifestations. Our results also demonstrate that extrasystolic activity due to phase 2 reentry can arise in the intact wall of the canine RV and serve as the trigger for VT/VF. Our data point to I(to) block (4-aminopyridine, quinidine) as an effective pharmacological treatment.",

    "43": "Cultured HUVECs were incubated with Ang II (from 10(-9) to 10(-6) mol/L) with or without candesartan and PD12319 (inhibitors of Ang II AT(1) and AT(2) receptors, respectively) for various times up to 4 hours. Total RNA was then extracted from HUVECs, and Northern blots were probed with a 1.9-kb ICAM-1 cDNA fragment. HUVEC supernatants were used to assess soluble ICAM-1 release by ELISA. Northern blot analysis detected a strong increase of ICAM-1 mRNA after 2-hour incubation with Ang II. The response was inhibited by candesartan. Soluble ICAM-1 release by HUVECs also increased (P<0. 002) after 2-hour Ang II stimulation. In vivo, Ang II (at an initial rate of 1.0 ng. kg(-1). min(-1), to be increased each 30 minutes by 2.0 ng. kg(-1). min(-1) to the final rate of 7.0 ng. kg(-1). min(-1)) was infused in 8 normotensive and 12 essential hypertensive individuals. In the latter, Ang II was reinfused after 4 weeks on either placebo (n=3), losartan (50 mg UID, n=5), or atenolol (50 mg UID, n=4) treatment. Plasma soluble ICAM-1 levels increased after Ang II infusion in hypertensives and normotensives (P<0.0001 after 90 minutes). Losartan reduced baseline soluble ICAM-1 levels (P<0.05) and Ang II-related ICAM-1 increments.",

    "45": "Uncoupling Protein 3 (UCP3), largely expressed in skeletal muscle, is modulated by cold, thyroid hormones, leptin, fasting-refeeding and exercise training among other factors in a tissue-specific manner. In brown adipose tissue, there is an increase in UCP3 levels after high-fat feeding and beta3-adrenergic agonist treatment. Controversial effects of these agents have been reported in skeletal muscle. The aim of this experimental trial was to evaluate the effect of high-fat feeding and beta3-adrenergic agent treatment on skeletal muscle UCP3 expression levels. Lean rats were fed a cafeteria diet for 30 days and found to have significantly higher fat stores and body weight than control rats at the end of the experimental period. When cafeteria-diet rats were daily i.p. injected with Tertatolol for 30 days; a decrease in total fat mass and body weight was found. Such an effect was not observed in fa/fa rats. Interestingly, gastrocnemius muscle UCP3 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in cafeteria-diet rats when compared to lean animals. Likewise, mitochondrial O2 consumption in gastrocnemius muscle was also significantly decreased (-31%) in cafeteria-diet rats as compared to the control group. It is suggested that the down-regulation of UCP3 gene expression together with the lower O2 consumption observed in high fat fed rats may be linked to lower fatty oxidation, which would promote triglyceride accumulation.", 
    "46": "We studied the use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with spectrofluorometric detection, using a solid-phase extraction for a simple, rapid and sensitive determination of plasma carvedilol levels in rats. Extracted aliquots were analyzed by HPLC, using a reversed-phase octadecyl silica column. The analytical mean recovery of carvedilol added to the blank plasma was 94.2%. The detection limit was 3.6 ng/ml in the plasma. The reproducibilities (C.V.) were 2.7-7.5% for the within-day assay, and 2.6-7.4% for the between-day assay, indicating that the method was effective for the determination of carvedilol plasma levels.", 
    "47": "The technique of automated in-tube solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) was evaluated for the determination of beta-blockers in urine and serum samples. In-tube SPME is an extraction technique for organic compounds in aqueous samples, in which analytes are extracted from the sample directly into an open tubular capillary by repeated draw/eject cycles of sample solution. LC/MS analyses of beta-blockers were initially performed by liquid injection onto a LC column. Nine beta-blockers tested in this study gave very simple ESI mass spectra, and strong signals corresponding to [M + H]+ were observed for all beta-blockers. The beta-blockers were separated with a Hypersil BDS C18 column using acetonitrile/methanol/water/acetic acid (15:15:70:1) as a mobile phase. To optimize the extraction of beta-blockers, several in-tube SPME parameters were examined. The optimum extraction conditions were 15 draw/eject cycles of 30 microL of sample in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) at a flow rate of 100 microL/min using an Omegawax 250 capillary (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA). The beta-blockers extracted by the capillary were easily desorbed by mobile-phase flow, and carryover of beta-blockers was not observed. Using in-tube SPME/LC/ESI-MS with selected ion monitoring, the calibration curves of beta-blockers were linear in the range from 2 to 100 ng/mL with correlation coefficients above 0.9982 (n = 18) and detection limits (S/N = 3) of 0.1-1.2 ng/mL. This method was successfully applied to the analysis of biological samples without interference peaks. The recoveries of beta-blockers spiked into human urine and serum samples were above 84 and 71%, respectively. A serum sample from a patient administrated propranolol was analyzed using this method and both propranolol and its metabolites were detected.", 
    "48": "Apoptosis as defined by contemporary science describes a form of cell death that involves discrete genetic and molecular programs, de novo protein expression and unique cellular phenotype. Evidence for the existence of apoptosis in the human heart has been reported in various cardiac diseases, including ischemic and non-ischemic heart failure, myocardial infarction and arrhythmias. Among the most potent stimuli that elicit cardiomyocyte apoptosis are: oxygen radicals (including NO), cytokines, (FAS/TNF alpha family of cytokines) and growth factors/energy deprivation. Several complex signal transduction pathways have been implicated in execution of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, including: Fas/TNF alpha receptors signaling, stress or mitogen activated protein kinases (SAPK/MAPK), sphingolipids metabolites (ceramide), G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling (G alpha i, G alpha q) and NF kappa B activation. Apoptosis of cardiac myocytes may contribute to progressive pump-failure, arrhythmias and cardiac remodeling. The recognition of numerous molecular targets associated with cardiomyocyte apoptosis that are amenable for pharmacologic manipulation, may provide novel therapeutic strategies for diverse cardiac ailments, as recently suggested by pharmacologic studies in experimental animals.",

S1319 (4-hydroxy-7-[1-(1-hydroxy-2-methylamino)ethyl]-1, 3-benzothiazol-2(3H)-one acetate), a novel non-catecholamine beta-adrenoceptor agonist, has been compared with isoprenaline, salbutamol and formoterol for activity in vitro on a range of beta-adrenoceptor containing preparations from guinea-pig. 2. S1319, like isoprenaline, salbutamol and formoterol, relaxed preparations of guinea-pig trachea (contracted by histamine) in a concentration-dependent manner. The relaxing activity of S1319 appeared to be more potent than that of isoprenaline and salbutamol, and similar to that of formoterol (pD2 values of 10.58+/-0.03 vs 7. 60+/-0.01, 7.50+/-0.01 and 10.52+/-0.04, respectively), and was blocked by the beta2-adrenoceptor selective antagonist (ICI 118,551). The intrinsic activity of S1319 was close to 1.0. 3. In the beta1-adrenoceptor containing preparations, guinea-pig right and left atria, a monophasic inotropic response of S1319 was observed. The pD2 value of S1319 for left atrial and right atrial inotropism was 6.70+/-0.15 and 7.81+/-0.01, respectively. 4. The selectivity ratio (trachea/left atrial inotropism) of S1319, formoterol, salbutamol and isoprenaline was 8523, 284, 4.8 and 0.45, respectively. The relative selectivity ratio of S1319 was 18743, 1858 and 30 times greater than that of isoprenaline, salbutamol and formoterol, respectively. 5. Relaxant responses of guinea-pig trachea to S1319 declined rapidly when the agonist was washed from the tissues, with complete recovery within 30 min. The duration of action of S1319 was similar to that of isoprenaline and less than that of salbutamol and formoterol. 6. In summary, S1319, a sponge-derived beta-adrenoceptor agonist, is a potent and selective beta2-adrenoceptor agonist with a short-duration of action in isolated guinea-pig tracheas.", 
    "50": "Nociceptin, an endogenous agonist of the opioid receptor-like(1) receptor, is expressed in the hypothalamus, where it is implicated in autonomic nervous system control. However, the central actions of nociceptin on sympathetic nerve activity have not been studied. We investigated the effect of intracerebroventricularly administered nociceptin (2-10 nmol) on blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) in conscious rats and sinoaortic-denervated (SAD) rats. Intracerebroventricularly administered nociceptin resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and HR in intact rats. RSNA decreased 31.5 +/- 2.1 and 19.9 +/- 5.0% at a dose of 2 and 5 nmol, respectively. In SAD rats, MAP, HR, and RSNA decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and the maximum responses were larger than those in intact rats. The decrease in HR induced by nociceptin was blocked by propranolol but not by atropine, which indicates that nociceptin is acting by inhibiting cardiac sympathetic outflow. These nociceptin-induced depressor and bradycardic responses were not antagonized by pretreatment with naloxone and nocistatin. These findings suggest that central nociceptin may have a functional role in regulating cardiovascular and sympathetic nervous systems.", 
    "51": "To study a cAMP-mediated signaling pathway in the regulation of amiloride-sensitive Na(+) transport in rat fetal distal lung epithelial cells, we measured an amiloride-sensitive short-circuit current (Na(+) transport). Forskolin, which increases the cytosolic cAMP concentration, stimulated the Na(+) transport. Forskolin also activated cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). A beta-adrenergic agonist and cAMP mimicked the forskolin action. PKA inhibitors KT-5720, H-8, and myristoylated PKA-inhibitory peptide amide-(14-22) did not influence the forskolin action. These results suggest that forskolin stimulates Na(+) transport through a PKA-independent pathway. Furthermore, forskolin increased tyrosine phosphorylation of approximately 70- to 80-, approximately 97-, and approximately 110- to 120-kDa proteins. Protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors (tyrphostin A23 and genistein) abolished the forskolin action. Moreover, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoate (a Cl(-)-channel blocker) prevented the stimulatory action of forskolin on Na(+) transport via abolishment of the forskolin-induced cell shrinkage and tyrosine phosphorylation. Based on these results, we conclude that forskolin (and cAMP) stimulates Na(+) transport in a PTK-dependent but not a PKA-dependent pathway by causing cell shrinkage, which activates PTK in rat fetal distal lung epithelial cells.", 
    "52": "The effect of beta-blockade on left ventricular (LV) remodeling, when added to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) after anterior myocardial infarction (MI), is incompletely understood. On day 2 after coronary ligation-induced anteroapical infarction, 17 sheep were randomized to ramipril (ACEI, n = 8) or ramipril and metoprolol (ACEI-beta, n = 9). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and 8 wk after MI to measure changes in LV end-diastolic, end-systolic, and stroke volume indexes, LV mass index, ejection fraction (EF), and regional percent intramyocardial circumferential shortening. (123)I-labeled m-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and fluorescent microspheres before and after adenosine were infused before death at 8 wk post-MI for quantitation of sympathetic innervation, blood flow, and blood flow reserve in adjacent and remote noninfarcted regions. Infarct size, regional blood flow, blood flow reserve, and the increase in LV mass and LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexes were similar between groups. However, EF fell less over the 8-wk study period in the ACEI-beta group (-13 +/- 11 vs. -22 +/- 4% in ACEI, P < 0.05). The ratio of adjacent to remote region (123)I-MIBG uptake was greater in ACEI-beta animals than in the ACEI group (0.93 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.86 +/- 0.07, P < 0.04). When added to ACE inhibition after transmural anteroapical MI, beta-blockade improves EF and adjacent regional sympathetic innervation but does not alter LV size.",

Over a 1-yr period, at each visit prior to initiation, at baseline initiation visit and at each follow-up visit, NYHA class, BP, HR, JVP, electrolytes, and renal function were obtained. Statistical analysis was performed using random effects regression approach.

Those with good functional status remained stable and those with poor functional status improved or remained stable. No baseline patient characteristic predicted improvement. The shortage of donor organ requires optimal use of medical regimens which may improve functional class while awaiting transplantation and which may delay the necessity for heart transplantation.

    "57": "Carvedilol (CAS 72956-09-3, Dilatrend) is a beta-blocker with additional vasodilating, antiproliferative and antioxidative properties. It is indicated for the treatment of high tension (HT), coronary artery disease (CAD) and congestive heart failure (CHF). Carvedilol has been investigated in numerous in vivo studies and thus comparisons of in vitro results to in vivo observations are possible. In this publication the results of studies on the in vitro absorption of carvedilol in a new model called BM-RIMO (Boehringer-Mannheim ring model) using porcine intestine are reported. In particular the influence of absorption enhancers and of pH and the existence of absorption windows were examined and the relevance of the obtained data for in vivo conditions was estimated. The main route of carvedilol absorption seemed to be transcellular. In vitro as well as in vivo absorption decreased within the intestine in the following order: jejunum > ileum > colon. The highest amount of in vitro absorption of carvedilol was achieved in the jejunum at a neutral pH. Enhancers such as bile and the mucoadhesive agent chitosan had opposite effects on the absorption of the compound. The results indicate that BM-RIMO is a simple, cheap and fast tool for the investigation of the influence of absorption enhancers, pH and different parts of intestine on absorption. For carvedilol the in vitro model tends to overestimate absorption in the colon, possibly because of the lack of faeces.", 
    "58": "A combined protein and pharmacophore model for cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) has been extended with a second pharmacophore in order to explain CYP2D6 catalyzed N-dealkylation reactions. A group of 14 experimentally verified N-dealkylation reactions form the basis of this second pharmacophore. The combined model can now accommodate both the usual hydroxylation and O-demethylation reactions catalyzed by CYP2D6, as well as the less common N-dealkylation reactions. The combined model now contains 72 metabolic pathways catalyzed by CYP2D6 in 51 substrates. The model was then used to predict the involvement of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of a \"test set\" of seven compounds. Molecular orbital calculations were used to suggest energetically favorable sites of metabolism, which were then examined using modeling techniques. The combined model correctly predicted 6 of the 8 observed metabolites. For the well-established CYP2D6 metabolic routes, the predictive value of the current combined protein and pharmacophore model is good. Except for the highly unusual metabolism of procainamide and ritonavir, the known metabolites not included in the development of the model were all predicted by the current model. Two possible metabolites have been predicted by the current model, which have not been detected experimentally. In these cases, the model may be able to guide experiments. P450 models, like the one presented here, have wide applications in the drug design process which will contribute to the prediction and elimination of polymorphic metabolism and drug-drug interactions.",

Tilisolol and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) were used as a model beta-blocker and a viscous polymer, respectively. After intracapsular, retrobulbar and palpebral conjunctival injections (50 microl) of tilisolol with 3% CMC into rabbits, drug concentrations in the tear fluid, blood, aqueous humor and vitreous body were determined by HPLC. Periocular injection (50 microl) of tilisolol with 3% CMC showed slight leakage of the drug in the tear fluid from the injection site. The viscous vehicle decreased the absorption rate constant of the drug from the injection site to systemic circulation compared with the buffer solution. It suggests that the viscous solution improved the retention of drug at both the injection site and in periocular tissues. Although the periocular injections with viscous vehicle (3% CMC) showed lower AUC in the aqueous humor than that observed in instillation, they showed comparable AUC in the vitreous humor. Compared to the results after the periocular injections with buffer solution, CMC increased the AUCs in the vitreous body 3.1-fold with retrobulbar injection and 1.4-fold with palpebral conjunctival injection, respectively. As a result, periocular injections with 3% CMC showed higher delivery of tilisolol to the vitreous body against the aqueous humor than the instillation and periocular injections with buffer solution.",

After intracapsular, retrobulbar and palpebral conjunctival injections of 150 microl and 50 microl fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-dextran, average molecular weight 11000), leakage of the dye into the tear fluid was dependent on the injection route and volume. After periocular injections (50 microl) of tilisolol, as a model beta-blocker, the concentrations in the tear fluid, blood, aqueous humor and vitreous body were determined by HPLC. Slight drug leakage was observed in the tear fluid after injections. The periocular injections showed a faster absorption and a higher area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in the plasma and a lower AUC in the aqueous humor than those observed in instillation. They also showed a higher ratio of AUC of tilisolol in the vitreous body to AUC in the aqueous humor than that observed in the instillation. Among the periocular injections, retrobulbar injection showed the highest concentrations in the plasma and the lowest in the aqueous humor and vitreous body, while intracapsular injection showed the lowest in the plasma and the highest in the aqueous humor and vitreous body. Although the periocular injections showed a rapid systemic absorption of drug by a rich topical vasculature, it might be an effective approach to deliver the drug to the periocular tissues and vitreous body.", 
    "62": "The aim of this study was both to investigate the effects of progressive inhibition of adrenergic neurons by increasing concentrations of guanethidine (0.1-10 microM) on the double-peaked vasoconstrictor responses to electrical periarterial nerve stimulation in the isolated and perfused canine splenic artery, and to clarify whether release of noradrenaline is presynaptically separate from release of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). Double-peaked vasoconstrictions (biphases of vasoconstrictions) were consistently observed under the conditions of 30-s trains of pulses at 1-10 Hz frequencies. Guanethidine, at a lower concentration (0.1 microM) did not modify the first (1st) phase vasoconstriction at low frequencies (1-2 Hz), but markedly inhibited the second (2nd) responses. On the other hand, it slightly but significantly inhibited the double-peaked vasoconstrictor responses at high frequencies (6-10 Hz). Furthermore, a 10-fold increase of concentration of guanethidine (1 microM) almost completely inhibited the 2nd phase responses at any frequencies used but did not completely inhibit the 1st phase response. A further increased concentration of guanethidine (10 microM) failed to enhance the 1 microM guanethidine-induced inhibition. The 1 microM guanethidine-resistant 1st phase responses at any frequencies used (1-10 Hz) were sensitive to tetrodotoxin (30 nM). Treatment with 0.1 microM prazosin did not modify the 1st phase response at any frequencies used in the 1 microM guanethidine-treated preparation. The responses remaining after 1 microM guanethidine and 0.1 microM prazosin were completely suppressed by a subsequent application of 1 microM alpha,beta-methylene ATP at any frequencies used. The results indicated that guanethidine, an adrenergic neuron blocker, may exert a dominant inhibitory effect on adrenergic rather than on purinergic components of sympathetic nerve co-transmission, indicating that guanethidine-sensitive mechanisms may mainly contribute to determine noradrenaline secretion from neurosecretory vesicles rather than ATP secretion.", 
    "63": "To better understand the link between fatty acid signaling and the pleiotropic effects of fatty acids in the pancreatic beta-cell, we investigated whether fatty acids regulate immediate-early response genes (IEGs) coding for transcription factors implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Palmitate and oleate, but not long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, caused a pronounced accumulation of c-fos and nur-77 mRNAs in beta-cells (INS cells) to an extent similar to that produced by the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The effect was dose dependent and occurred at concentrations between 0.1 and 0.5 mmol/l in the presence of 0.5% albumin. The action of the fatty acid occurred at the transcriptional level, and the mRNA accumulation displayed a bell-shaped kinetics with a maximal effect at 1 h. 2-Bromopalmitate was ineffective, indicating that fatty acids must be metabolized to cause their effect. Neither fatty acid was able to induce c-fos and nur-77 in PKC-downregulated cells or cells incubated in the presence of the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine or the Ca2+ chelator EGTA, suggesting involvement of the PKC and Ca2+ signaling pathways. Palmitate and oleate also increased c-fos protein expression and DNA binding activity of the transcription factor AP-1. Oleate, but not palmitate, increased [3H]thymidine incorporation in INS cells. Finally, both palmitate and oleate caused c-fos and nur-77 mRNA accumulation in isolated rat islets. It is suggested that IEG induction by the most abundant circulating fatty acids plays a role in the adaptive process of the beta-cell to hyperlipidemia. These results have implications for our understanding of obesity-associated diabetes and the link between fatty acids and tumorigenesis.", 
    "64": "1. The properties of beta-adrenoceptors mediating vascular relaxation in rat isolated carotid artery were investigated. Ring segments of arteries were preconstricted with the thromboxane A2 receptor agonist U-46619 and relaxation to beta-adrenoceptor agonists determined. 2. Isoprenaline produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of U-44619-constricted arteries. The concentration-response curve (CRC) to isoprenaline was shifted to the right by propranolol (1 microM) although the shift was less (105 fold; pA2, 8.02) than would be expected for an effect of isoprenaline at classical beta-adrenoceptors (300-1000 fold; pA2, 8.5-9). L-NAME (100 microM) significantly reduced responses to isoprenaline, lowering the slope of the CRC and reducing the maximum response. 3. The selective beta3-adrenoceptor agonists, BRL 37344 and ZD2079, also produced concentration-dependent relaxation of the arteries. L-NAME (100 microM) shifted the BRL 37344 CRC to the right 15 fold with no reduction in the slope or maximum response. L-NAME (100 microM) had no significant effect on the ZD2079 CRC. 4. In conclusion, relaxation to isoprenaline in rat carotid artery is inhibited by propranolol in a manner suggesting a mixed population of classical (beta1-/beta2-) and atypical (beta3-) adrenoceptors. The presence of beta3-adrenoceptors was confirmed by the relaxant effects of the selective beta3-adrenoceptor agonists BRL 37344 and ZD2079. L-NAME attenuated responses to both isoprenaline and the beta3-adrenoceptor agonist BRL 37344, suggesting a role for endothelial release of nitric oxide in beta-adrenoceptor mediated relaxation. However, the relaxant effect of BRL 37344 was attenuated by L-NAME to a lesser extent than that of isoprenaline. In addition, L-NAME had no effect on relaxation induced by ZD2079. These results suggest that there may be a differential contribution of endothelium to classical beta-and beta3-adrenoceptor-mediated effects, with endothelium contributing less to beta3-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation.", 
    "65": "Stress causes impaired performance on tests of creativity. Drugs that block beta-adrenergic receptors improve test performance in patients with test anxiety. Furthermore, catecholamine precursors (L-DOPA) reduce the flexibility of semantic networks. Our study investigated the effect of noradrenergic system modulation on cognitive flexibility in problem solving. Eighteen normal subjects undertook three problem solving tasks (number series, shape manipulation and anagrams) 45 min after propranolol, placebo and ephedrine. On the task that appeared to rely most heavily on cognitive flexibility (anagrams), subjects who were most able to solve these problems demonstrated significantly shorter solution times (logarithmic scores) after propranolol than after ephedrine. This suggested that the noradrenergic system exerts a modulatory effect on cognitive flexibility in problem solving.", 
    "66": "Aminopeptidase P and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) are responsible for the metabolism of exogenously administered bradykinin in the coronary circulation of the rat. It has been shown that ACE inhibitors decrease cytosolic enzyme release from the ischemic rat heart and reduce reperfusion-induced ventricular arrhythmias by increasing endogenous levels of bradykinin. It was hypothesized that the aminopeptidase P inhibitor apstatin could do the same. In an isolated perfused rat heart preparation subjected to global ischemia and reperfusion, both apstatin and ramiprilat (an ACE inhibitor) significantly decreased creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. The difference between the postischemia and preischemia levels of released CK was reduced 68% by apstatin and 68% by ramiprilat compared with control. The corresponding reductions in LDH release were 74% for apstatin and 81% for ramiprilat. A combination of the inhibitors was not significantly better than either one alone. Apstatin and ramiprilat also significantly reduced the duration of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation by 69 and 61%, respectively. The antiarrhythmic effect of apstatin was reversed by HOE140, a bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist, suggesting that apstatin is acting by potentiating endogenously formed bradykinin. The results demonstrate that the aminopeptidase P inhibitor apstatin is cardioprotective in this model of cardiac ischemia/ reperfusion injury.", 
    "67": "Elevated levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and von Willebrand factor (vWF), both markers indicative of endothelial function, are associated with hypertension. In a randomized open study we investigated the effect of antihypertensive treatment with the alpha-blocker doxazosin (n = 23) or the beta-blocker atenolol (n = 22) for 22 weeks on circulating levels of ET-1 and vWF in middle-aged men with essential hypertension. Blood pressure reduction was satisfactorily achieved with both drugs, although the decrease in the atenolol group was larger than that in the doxazosin group. A reduction in the levels of vWF occurred in both groups, being more pronounced in the alpha-blocker group compared with the decrease on beta blockers, p = 0.004 and p = 0.056, respectively. In the alpha-blocker group, there was a significant correlation (r = 0.50, p = 0.022) between the reduction in diastolic blood pressure and the decline in vWF. A highly significant decrease in plasma ET-1 was obtained during beta blockade (p = 0.007), whereas no significant change occurred within the alpha-blocker group. There was, however, no correlation between the decrease in blood pressure and the reduction in ET-1. The different favorable effects of alpha and beta blockers on endothelial function expressed as vWF and ET-1, could indicate that the effects are probably related not only to the blood pressure per se, but also to the different pharmacologic mechanisms of the drugs.", 
    "68": "To determine whether nitrate tolerance is attenuated on aortas isolated from rats treated in the long term with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, five groups of rats were studied in parallel. Group 1 received ramipril, 1 mg/ kg/day, p.o., for 6 weeks; group 2 received ramipril at the same dose for 4 weeks, and the last 2 weeks, a cotreatment with ramipril plus HOE 140 (a bradykinin B2 antagonist, 500 microg/ kg/day, s.c. injections); group 3 received losartan, 2 mg/kg/day, p.o., for 6 weeks; group 4 received losartan at the same dose, and the last 2 weeks, a cotreatment with losartan plus HOE 140; and group 5 served as control. Rings of thoracic aorta from these groups were studied in organ baths. After nitroglycerin preincubation (10 microM for 30 min) in vitro, the dose-response curves to nitroglycerin were significantly shifted to the right in the control group but not in group 1. This protective effect was partially present in group 3; it was completely abolished in groups 2 and 4. In groups 1 and 3, it also was abolished after nitric oxide synthase (cNOS) inhibition (L-NMMA incubation) or removal of the endothelium. Superoxide anion accumulation (assessed by lucigenin chemiluminescence) was increased by nitroglycerin incubation in the control group but not in groups 1 and 3. After in vivo exposure to nitroglycerin (50 mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily for 4 days), this protection against nitrate tolerance also was observed in groups 1 and 3. Thus long-term ACE inhibition prevents nitrate tolerance by an endothelium-dependent mechanism involving mainly an enhanced NO availability via B2-kinin receptor. This effect on the cNOS pathway seems to attenuate the superoxide anion accumulation induced by nitroglycerin exposure (probably via a downregulation of oxidative enzyme).", 
    "69": "In this study, we used the spontaneously beating, isolated rat right atrium as an in vitro model to study arrhythmogenic effects of electrical stimulation. A tetrapolar platinum electrode was used for stimulation and recording of atrial electrical activity at 36.5 degrees C (spontaneous rate, 4.9+/-0.3 Hz). A flutter-like pattern of arrhythmia was reproducibly induced by application of stimulus trains (250 pulses, 66.7 Hz). Arrhythmia was characterized by regular and very short cycle length (40-70 ms), each episode lasting from 3 s to >5 min. In control conditions, application of one to five pulse trains was sufficient to induce arrhythmia. However, atropine (but not propranolol) completely blocked arrhythmia induction (10-15 consecutive trains were ineffective). The ability of electrical stimulation to evoke arrhythmia was restored after atropine washout. A milder stimulation protocol (30 pulses, 50 Hz), which was unable to evoke arrhythmia in control conditions, was fully effective in the presence of 1 microM acetylcholine (ACh). Furthermore, a similar flutter-like pattern could be induced in isolated left atria in the presence of ACh. Our results point out an arrhythmogenic effect of neurally released ACh in the isolated right atrium on atrial electrical stimulation.",

    "71": "In six healthy volunteers the intestinal steady-state perfusion technique (triple lumen tubing system) was used for measuring the appearance of talinolol within the small intestine while the drug was infused intravenously. During four of the seven perfusions performed, the perfusion fluid was changed from a verapamil-free solution and talinolol appearance was measured while a R-verapamil-containing solution (565 micromol/L) was perfused.", 
    "72": "Talinolol was transported into the intestinal lumen up to a concentration gradient between lumen and blood of about 5.5:1. While perfusing the small intestine with a verapamil-free solution, the intestinal secretion rate of talinolol ranged from 1.94 to 6.62 microg/min per 30 cm length of the intestine (median values). Perfusion of a R-verapamil-containing perfusion fluid resulted in lower secretion rates (0.59 to 3.71 microg/30 cm x min), corresponding to 29% to 56% of the values obtained without verapamil supplied intraluminally.", 
    "73": "Intravenously administered talinolol is actively secreted into the human small intestine. This secretion is reduced by the intraluminal supply of the P-glycoprotein modulating drug R-verapamil. This gives further rationale for P-glycoprotein-mediated intestinal drug secretion as a cause for incomplete oral bioavailability and for drug interactions during intestinal absorption.",

A cardiologist was involved as a consultant or the attending physician in the care of 80% of HMO patients and 82% of FFS patients (P = .12). The treatment delay, time to electrocardiogram, use of thrombolytic agents, and door-to-needle times were almost identical. However, 56% of HMO patients and 51% of FFS patients used emergency transportation (P = .02); most of this difference was observed for patients with AMIs that occurred at night (60% vs 52%; P = .02). Health maintenance organization patients were somewhat more likely than FFS patients to receive aspirin therapy (88% vs 83%; P = .03) and beta-blocker therapy (73% vs 62%; P = .04); these differences were partly explained by a significantly larger proportion of younger physicians in HMOs who were more likely to order these drug therapies.

    "84": "Risk factor control has been shown to reduce the incidence of coronary events in patients with or without preceding infarction. Secondary prevention should therefore be borne in mind by every cardiologist. In order to test this concept and/or to promote secondary prevention in our country, the following survey was conducted by our working group for epidemiology and prevention. All interventional centres of the country (7 million inhabitants) were asked to report relevant data of 50 consecutive patients with PTCA in a structured questionnaire. Thirteen centres responded and we report the data of 650 patients. The mean proportion of women was 28%, the mean age 61.1 years and the mean stent rate 49.8%. The indications for PTCA varied widely: stable angina 10-74%, unstable angina 10-86%, primary PTCA 0-22%. The risk factor history was distributed as follows: diabetes 12-46% (mean 22.3%), hypertension 32-68% (mean 54.2%), current smoking 6-56% (mean 21.9%), and total cholesterol (TChol) > 200 mg/dl: 30-78% (mean 60.3%). Current lipid values were available for T chol. in 44-100% (mean 84.5%) and for LDL in 4-100% (mean 67.1%). Dietary counselling by a dietician was done in 4-100% of patients (mean 35.6%) Information concerning the hazards of smoking was given to 25-100% (mean 83.6%) of current smokers. Drug treatment at hospital discharge was as follows: 84-100% (mean 93.1%) received ASA, 24-74% (mean 49.8%) ticlopidine, 6-84% (mean 53.3%) nitrates, 34-82% (mean 60.2%) beta blockers, 10-70% (mean 39.5%) ACE inhibitors, 4-74% (mean 4 7.2%) lipid lowering drugs, 7-48% (mean 17.8%) calcium antagonists, 0-12% (mean 6.1%) digitalis and 0-28% (mean 13.6%) diuretics. Follow-up data were collected in 4 centres at 6 months post discharge and were available for 174 patients. Here we found an increase in the prescription of calcium antagonists, digitalis and statins. The following conclusions were drawn at a conference in which all centres participated: lipid values should be available for each patient at PTCA, dietary counselling should be initiated for every patient during hospitalisation (and continued by the family physician) and the national cardiac society should promote guidelines for the use of drugs in which the variation in use is too wide at present. It should be ensured that these guidelines are implemented not only in patients after AMI but also in those after PTCA.", 
    "85": "In 1998, nitric oxide (NO) was extensively explored. First studies demonstrating a beneficial effect of inhaled NO in patients with pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction and intractable heart failure were published. It was further shown, that, in patients with essential hypertension, impaired vasodilatation can be improved by vitamin C as an antioxidant, an effect that can be reversed by NO-synthase inhibition. Unlike arotinolol, which has no antioxidat effect, carvedilol is a beta- and alpha-blocker with antioxidative properties that may prevent the development of nitrate tolerance. In clinical cardiology, the main focus is on the prevention and therapy of coronary heart disease, heart failure and hypertension: a Task force report on the prevention of coronary heart disease in clinical practice. Proceedings on anticoagulant therapy and Guidelines for antithrombotic management were published in 1998. There is an agreement that in mild hypertension the decision how to treat should be based on the estimate of cardiovascular risk and not on an arbitrary blood pressure threshold. Diuretics and betablockers should be preferred unless they are contraindicated, or there are positive indications for other drug classes. Studies also strongly suggest that therapy with relatively small doses of two different classes of drugs is the effective way to treat the majority of patients and minimize side effects. In heart failure, the evidence for the current treatment with diuretics, ACE-inhibitors and digoxin, in selected patients, is well established.", 
    "86": "1 The possibility that the class III antiarrhythmic drugs clofilium and d-sotalol might affect delayed rectifier potassium channels at the level of their gating currents was assessed with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in guinea-pig isolated ventricular heart cells. 2 Clofilium (up to 20 microM) and d-sotalol (1 microM) did not decrease the Na current, the L-type Ca current or the background K current iKl, but significantly depressed the time-dependent delayed outward K current iK. 3 Clofilium partially decreased in a dose-dependent manner (1-20 microM) QON of intramembrane charge movements (ICM) elicited by a depolarizing pulse applied from a holding potential of -110 mV or following a 100 ms inactivating prepulse to -50 mV. D-sotalol (1 microM) also decreased QON. Channel density estimated from the clofilium-sensitive ICM closely matched that of the delayed rectifier channels. 4 Clofilium and d-sotalol decreased QOFF seen on repolarization in a dose- and voltage-dependent manner. The kinetics of the decay of the OFF gating currents were not affected, and only the fast phase was depressed. 5 In control conditions, QON availability with voltage was most of the time well described by two inactivating components. In the presence of clofilium and d-sotalol, a complex behaviour of QON availability was observed, unmasking additional components. The reactivation kinetics of QON after a 500 ms inactivating pulse to 0 mV was not affected. 6 We conclude that delayed rectifier K channels significantly contribute to QON and QOFF of ICM in guinea-pig ventricular heart cells, besides Na and Ca channels, and that clofilium and d-sotalol directly interact with these K channels proteins by affecting their gating properties.", 
    "87": "One of the major pathological features of Alzheimer's disease is the deposition of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta). Cellular toxicity has been shown to be associated with fibrillar forms of Abeta; preventing this fibril formation is therefore viewed as a possible method of slowing disease progression in Alzheimer's disease. With the use of a series of tetracyclic and carbazole-type compounds as inhibitors of Abeta fibril formation, we here describe a number of common structural features that seem to be associated with the inhibitory properties of these agents. Compounds such as carvedilol, rolitetracycline and daunomycin, which are shown to inhibit Abeta fibril formation, also prevent the formation of species of peptide that demonstrate biological activity in a human neuroblastoma cell line. Molecular modelling data suggest that these compounds have in common the ability to adopt a specific three-dimensional pharmacophore conformation that might be essential for binding to Abeta and preventing it from forming fibrils. Understanding such drug-peptide interactions might aid the development of disease-modifying agents.", 
    "88": "Preconditioning protects the heart from ischemic injury, but some of its effects are reversed by beta-adrenergic blockade.

    "89": "Isolated, crystalloid-perfused rabbit hearts underwent 1 hour of left anterior descending coronary artery ischemia followed by 1 hour of reperfusion. Before ischemia, six hearts received nipradilol, six received the nitric oxide donor L-arginine, four hearts received the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester before L-arginine, nine underwent ischemic preconditioning, and six received beta-blockade by esmolol before ischemic preconditioning. Seven hearts received no pretreatment (control). Action potential duration and ventricular pressure were measured. Infarct size was determined at the end of reperfusion.", 
    "90": "Both L-arginine and ischemic preconditioning prolonged action potential duration significantly at 60 minutes of reperfusion. Compared with control, infarct size was reduced by ischemic preconditioning (26%+/-4% versus 49%+/-3%, IPC versus control; p<0.01), L-arginine (24%+/-2%; p<0.01 versus control), and nipradilol (24%+/-2%; p<0.01 versus control).

    "92": "Many patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension initially receive beta-blocker monotherapy to control intraocular pressure (IOP), but some of these patients will require an additional IOP-lowering agent within 1 year. This active-controlled, double-masked, randomized, multicenter, 12-week study compared the effectiveness and tolerability of dorzolamide hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 2% TID with those of pilocarpine hydrochloride 2% QID as adjunctive therapy to timolol maleate ophthalmic gel-forming solution (TG) 0.5% QD as measured by changes in IOP and occurrence of adverse events. One hundred ninety-four patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension participated in this study. Their mean age was approximately 63 years. Slightly more than one half were white, and approximately one third were black. After a 3-week run-in period during which all patients received TG 0.5% QD, patients with an IOP of > or = 22 mm Hg at the morning trough measurement were randomly assigned to receive additional double-masked therapy with either dorzolamide or pilocarpine. The primary outcome measure was the mean change in IOP at the morning trough measurement from baseline to week 12. The secondary outcome measure was the mean change in IOP at the morning peak measurement from baseline to week 12. There was no significant difference in IOP-lowering effect between the 2 drugs at either morning trough or morning peak. The mean change in IOP at morning trough was -3.17 mm Hg (-12%) in patients receiving dorzolamide; it was -3.45 mm Hg (-13%) in patients receiving pilocarpine. The mean change in IOP at morning peak was -2.25 mm Hg (-10%) for patients who received dorzolamide and -2.51 mm Hg (-11%) for those who received pilocarpine. In the pilocarpine group, 62 (63%) patients experienced > or =1 adverse event compared with 35 (36%) patients in the dorzolamide group (P < 0.001). Twenty-one (21%) patients in the pilocarpine group discontinued treatment because of an adverse event compared with 2 (2%) patients in the dorzolamide group (P < 0.001). These results demonstrate that dorzolamide and pilocarpine were equally effective as adjunctive therapy in lowering IOP but that dorzolamide was better tolerated.", 
    "93": "The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of a calcium antagonist/beta-blocker fixed combination tablet used as first-line antihypertesnive therapy in comparison with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and placebo. Patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 110 mm Hg at the end of a 4-week run-in period) were randomly allocated to a double-blind, 12-week treatment with either a combination tablet of felodipine and metoprolol (Logimax), 5/50 mg daily (n = 321), enalapril, 10 mg daily (n = 321), or placebo (n = 304), with the possibility of doubling the dose after 4 or 8 weeks of treatment if needed (diastolic blood pressure remaining >90 mm Hg). The combined felodipine-metoprolol treatment controlled blood pressure (diastolic < or =90 mm Hg 24 h after dose) in 72% of patients after 12 weeks, as compared with 49% for enalapril and 30% for placebo. A dose adjustment was required in 38% of patients receiving the combination, in 63% of patients allocated to placebo, and 61% of enalapril-treated patients. The overall incidence of adverse events was 54.5% during felodipine-metoprolol treatment; the corresponding values for enalapril and placebo were 51.7% and 47.4%, respectively. Withdrawal of treatment due to adverse events occurred in 18 patients treated with the combination, in 10 patients on enalapril, and 12 patients on placebo. No significant change in patients' well-being was observed in either of the three study groups. These results show that a fixed combination tablet of felodipine and metoprolol allows to normalize blood pressure in a substantially larger fraction of patients than enalapril given alone. This improved efficacy is obtained without impairing the tolerability. The fixed-dose combination of felodipine and metoprolol, therefore, may become a valuable option to initiate antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "94": "L-Thyroxine (T4) is commonly prescribed medication for hypothyroidism in humans and animals. Overdose has generally resulted in limited symptomatology managed with sedatives and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists. We describe the largest acute T4 ingestion ever reported, which resulted in a profound thyrotoxicosis, resistant to treatment. A 34-y-old man ingested 900 (0.8 mg) tablets of veterinary T4 (720 mg) and was given 60 g of activated charcoal. He became lethargic on post-ingestion days 2 and 3; had vomiting, diaphoresis and insomnia on day 4; on day 5 he \"looked like he had too much coffee\", began \"using a lot of words\" and became agitated, assaultive and stopped speaking intelligibly; and on day 6 returned to the hospital combative and confused. He was diaphoretic, mydriatic, hyperreflexic, tremulous, with clear lungs and active bowel sounds, and received activated charcoal, haloperidol, diazepam, and phenobarbital, and was tracheally intubated. During hospitalization he was rehydrated, treated with propranolol and diazepam, but remained continuously tachycardic. On day 12 he became afebrile and his tachycardia resolved. Free T4 levels ranged from > 13 mcg/dL on day 6 to 1.2 mcg/dL on day 12. By discharge (day 15) he had lost 20 kilograms of body weight, but was clinically euthyroid 2 w later. This case suggests that large intentional T4 ingestions should be managed differently than current T4 overdose protocol.",

    "96": "With the rise in the field of neuroimmunomodulation research, there is increased recognition of the influence of the nervous system and neuropeptides in peripheral disease. The neuropeptide alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) is a neuroimmunomodulatory agent that modulates production of proinflammatory cytokines and inhibits peripheral inflammation via actions on CNS receptors. We examined whether central alpha-MSH operates by inhibiting activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) that is essential to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and development of inflammation in the periphery. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of nuclear extracts from the murine foot pad injected with TNF-alpha demonstrated that centrally administered alpha-MSH does inhibit NF-kappaB activation. Western blot analysis revealed that this inhibition was linked to central alpha-MSH-induced preservation of expression of IkappaBalpha protein in the peripheral tissue. The NF-kappaB and IkappaBalpha effects were inhibited in mice with spinal cord transection. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of the nonspecific beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol, and of a specific beta2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, likewise prevented these effects of central alpha-MSH; blockade of cholinergic, alpha-adrenergic, or beta1-adrenergic receptors did not. Centrally administered alpha-MSH inhibited peripheral NF-kappaB activation and IkappaBalpha degradation even in mice with nonfunctional melanocortin 1 receptors (MC1R). These findings indicate that alpha-MSH can act centrally to inhibit NF-kappaB activation in peripheral acute inflammation via a descending neural pathway. The pathway involves beta2-adrenergic receptors, but does not require activation of MC1R within the brain.",

Relat. 1996, 15, 403-409 comparing the performance of 14 logP predictors it was concluded that predictions of logP values were significantly better for simple organic molecules than for drugs. Since the publication of this benchmark study, a logP predictor, VLOGP, has been developed in our group. In the work presented here, VLOGP is used to assess the logP values of the same 48 drugs as included in the benchmark comparison. VLOGP returned 79.2% \"acceptable\", 18.6% \"disputable\", and only 2.2% \"unacceptable\" logP values. the \"acceptable\", \"disputable\", and \"unacceptable\" logP values from the 14 other predictors, respectively, ranged between 27.1% and 72.9%, 16.7% and 41.7%, and 2.2% and 37.5%. Further, VLOGP resulted in a much tighter fit (mean squared deviation, m.s.d., = 0.197) between experimental and calculated values of logP compared with the other 14 methods for which the m.s.d. ranged between 0.247 and 1.068. The major differentiation between VLOGP and other predictors is that its application domain, called Optimum Prediction Space (OPS), is quantitatively defined, i.e., the structures to which VLOGP model should not be applied for predicting logP can be identified. This process is automated by implementation of VLOGP in the TOPKAT package.", 
    "106": "This work tested the hypothesis that a stereospecific topical formulation could be used to engineer differential permeation rates for each enantiomer of an applied racemate across human skin in vitro. Racemic and enantiomerically pure R or S propranolol HCI were formulated with cellulose tris(3,5-dimethyl phenyl carbamate) (CDMPC) and applied to excised human skin using side-by-side Franz-type diffusion cells. When the pure enantiomers were used, there was a marked difference between the penetration rates of R and S propranolol (flux ratio: 2.06; P = 0.04). When racemic propranolol was used, the difference was reduced, although still statistically significant (flux ratio: 1.2; P = 0.08), particularly in view of the differential activities of the two enantiomers. Control experiments, in which no CDMPC was present, produced equal permeation rates. The results can be rationalised in terms of differential adsorption onto CDMPC within the vehicle, whereby S-propranolol is preferentially bound relative to R-propranolol. This causes an imbalance in the apparent donor phase concentrations that (in accordance with Fickian diffusion laws and thermodynamic activity) gives rise to differences in permeation rates. The diminished differential observed when the racemate was used, rather than individual enantiomers, is less easily rationalised. In this work, it was the permeation of the eutomer (S-propranolol) that was retarded, although the general principle of stereoselectively retarded skin permeation has been established.", 
    "107": "Recent evidence suggests the expression of a Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) in vascular endothelial cells. To elucidate the functional role of endothelial NCX, we studied Ca(2+) signaling and Ca(2+)-dependent activation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) at normal, physiological Na(+) gradients and after loading of endothelial cells with Na(+) ions using the ionophore monensin. Monensin-induced Na(+) loading markedly reduced Ca(2+) entry and, thus, steady-state levels of intracellular free Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) in thapsigargin-stimulated endothelial cells due to membrane depolarization. Despite this reduction of overall [Ca(2+)](i), Ca(2+)-dependent activation of eNOS was facilitated as indicated by a pronounced leftward shift of the Ca(2+) concentration response curve in monensin-treated cells. This facilitation of Ca(2+)-dependent activation of eNOS was strictly dependent on the presence of Na(+) ions during treatment of the cells with monensin. Na(+)-induced facilitation of eNOS activation was not due to a direct effect of Na(+) ions on the Ca(2+) sensitivity of the enzyme. Moreover, the effect of Na(+) was not related to Na(+) entry-induced membrane depolarization or suppression of Ca(2+) entry, since neither elevation of extracellular K(+) nor the Ca(2+) entry blocker 1-(beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl)-1H-imidazol e hydrochloride (SK&F 96365) mimicked the effects of Na(+) loading. The effects of monensin were completely blocked by 3', 4'-dichlorobenzamil, a potent and selective inhibitor of NCX, whereas the structural analog amiloride, which barely affects Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange, was ineffective. Consistent with a pivotal role of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange in Ca(2+)-dependent activation of eNOS, an NCX protein was detected in caveolin-rich membrane fractions containing both eNOS and caveolin-1. These results demonstrate for the first time a crucial role of cellular Na(+) gradients in regulation of eNOS activity and suggest that a tight functional interaction between endothelial NCX and eNOS may take place in caveolae.", 
    "108": "Clinical approaches to the prevention of the potentially catastrophic consequences of coronary ischemic phenomena such as unstable angina and suspected non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) differ across the world. In addition to prevailing physician beliefs in different societies, the level of access to catheterization laboratories largely determines whether an interventionist or conservative strategy is adopted. The Organization to Assess Strategies for Ischemic Syndromes (OASIS)--a prospective registry of approximately 8,000 patients with acute myocardial ischemia with no ST elevation, treated in 95 hospitals across 6 countries--furnished a unique window into regional differences in clinical management and the frequency and timing of invasive procedures (i.e., angiography, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [PTCA], and coronary artery bypass graft [CABG] surgery), as well as the outcomes of these trends. At 6 months after symptom onset, patients in the United States and Brazil, where the catheterization laboratory facilities are more accessible, underwent significantly (p <0.001) more angiography (69.4%), PTCA (23.6%), and CABG (25.2%) than in Canada and Australia, where the corresponding rates were 48.4%, 17.0%, and 16.8% (p <0.001), respectively; and in Hungary and Poland, where the respective rates were 23.5%, 5.8%, and 10.9% (p <0.001). This relatively aggressive approach led at 6 months to a more substantial decrease in refractory angina in the United States and Brazil than in Canada and Australia (20.4% vs 13.9%; p <0.001), but no improvement in rates of cardiovascular mortality and MI (10.5% versus 10.5%; p = 0.36). There was a significant (p < or = 0.012) increase in stroke, (1.9% vs 1.3%; p = 0.010) and major bleeding (1.9% vs 1.1%; p = 0.009) events. Furthermore, an inverse correlation emerged between baseline cardiovascular risk status and frequency of angiography and PTCA interventions preferentially for low-risk compared with high-risk patients. In concert with findings from other recent randomized trials, the OASIS Registry data suggest that although there are fewer hospital readmissions for unstable angina, there is a trend toward increased rates of death, MI, and stroke. These data urge a cautious approach to the use of invasive procedures in patients with unstable angina unless future trials demonstrate a clear benefit with an aggressive approach.", 
    "109": "The alkylating agent N-ethylameimide and the sulfhydryl group blocker p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (CPMA) inhibited in dose-dependent manner both basal activity of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and its activity stimulated by non-hormonal substances (forskolin, sodium fluoride, guanylilimidodiphosphate) in smooth muscles of the freshwater bivalve mollusk Anodonta cygnea. The double increase (from 30 to 60 min) in the time of preincubation of a sarcolemmal membrane fraction with ethylmaleimide and CPMA led to an essential increase in enzyme inhibition (especially for CPMA). 50 mM SH-containing reagent beta-mercaptoethanol (ME) partially restored the AC activity, inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide and CPMA, except when these two latter reagents were in high concentrations (1-10 and 0.5 mM, respectively). The data obtained point to the key role of cysteine SH-groups in regulation of the functional activity of proteins, components of the adenylyl cyclase system--AC and heterotrimeric G-proteins.", 
    "110": "This review article summarizes the long-term standard therapy for patients with myocardial infarction. The chronic therapy is able to significantly improve quality of life and survival of affected patients. Previous studies showed that in most western countries, the established standard therapy is not given to all patients who would benefit from chronic treatment. The essential parts of today's myocardial infarction treatment consists of effective beta-blockade, inhibition of the angiotensin-conversion enzyme, inhibition of platelet aggregation and lipid lowering agents. This article reviews the clinical benefits which may be expected from each of these therapeutic approaches. Newer, but not yet proven strategies, like blockade of the angiotensin receptor subtype 1 and treatment with antioxidative agents will be discussed.", 
    "111": "Carvedilol (CAR) is a vasodilating beta-blocker which also has antioxidant properties. CAR produces dose-related reduction in mortality in patients with congestive heart failure. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that CAR protects against doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with DOX, CAR, CAR+DOX, or atenolol (ATN)+DOX. DOX (cumulative dose, 15 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally, and CAR (30 mg/kg daily) or ATN (150 mg/kg daily) was administered orally. Three weeks after the completion of these treatments, cardiac performance and myocardial lipid peroxidation were assessed. Mortality was observed in the DOX (25%) and ATN+DOX (12.5%) groups. Compared with control rats, DOX significantly decreased systolic blood pressure (104+/-4 vs. 120+/-4 mmHg, P<0.05) and left ventricular fractional shortening (38.8+/-3.1 vs. 55.4+/-1.3%, P<0.01), and resulted in a significant accumulation of ascites (14.4+/-4.9 vs. 0 ml, P<0.01). CAR significantly prevented the cardiomyopathic changes caused by DOX, while ATN did not. The myocardial thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content was significantly higher in DOX-treated rats than in control rats (80.4+/-7.1 vs. 51.5+/-1.2 nmol/g heart, p<0.01). CAR prevented the increase in TBARS content (48.8+/-3.0 nmol/g heart, P<0.01 vs. DOX group), whereas ATN had no significant effect (74.3+/-5.2 nmol/g heart). CAR also significantly prevented the increase in both myocardial and plasma cholesterol concentrations caused by DOX. These data indicate that CAR protects against DOX-induced cardiomyopathy and that this effect may be attributed to the antioxidant and lipid-lowering properties of CAR, not to its beta-blocking property.", 
    "112": "An important but difficult task in the design of a clinical trial to compare time to failure between two treatment groups is determination of the number of patients required to achieve a specified power of the test. Because patients typically enter the trial serially and are followed until they fail or withdraw from the study or until the study is terminated, the power of the test depends on the accrual pattern, the noncompliance rate, and the withdrawal rate in addition to the actual survival distributions of the two groups. Incorporating interim analyses and the possibility of early stopping into the trial increases its complexity, and although normal approximations have been developed for computing the significance level of the test when the log-rank or other rank statistics are used, there are no reliable analytic approximations for evaluating the power of the test. This article presents methods, based on Monte Carlo simulations and recent advances in group sequential testing with time-to-event responses, to choose appropriate test statistics, compute power and sample size at specified alternatives, check the adequacy of commonly used normal approximations of the type I error probability, and assess the performance of different interim analysis strategies. It also presents two computer programs implementing these methods.", 
    "113": "Acute treatment with delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol [delta9-THC; 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg b.w. intravenously (i.v.)], the major psychoactive constituent of marijuana, produces a dose-related suppression of pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in ovariectomized rats. To determine whether delta9-THC produces this response by altering neurotransmitter and/or neuropeptide systems involved in the regulation of LH secretion, ovariectomized rats were pretreated with antagonists for dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, or opioid receptors, and the effect of delta9-THC on LH release was determined. Pretreatment with the D2 receptor antagonists butaclamol (1.0 mg/kg b.w., intraperitoneally) or pimozide [0.63 mg/kg, subcutaneously (s.c.)], the opioid receptor antagonists naloxone (1-4 mg/kg, i.v.) or naltrexone (2 mg/kg, i.v.), the noradrenergic alpha2-receptor antagonist idazoxan (10 microg/kg, i.v.), or the serotonin 5-HT(1C/2) receptor antagonist ritanserin (1 or 5 mg/kg b.w., i.p.), did not alter delta9-THC-induced inhibition of pulsatile LH secretion. Pretreatment with a relatively high dose of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol (6 mg/kg, i.v.) attenuated the ability of the low THC dose to inhibit LH release; however, lower doses of propranolol were without effect. Furthermore, the ability of a relatively nonspecific serotonin 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor antagonist pindolol (4 mg/kg, s.c.) or the specific 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (1 mg/kg, s.c.) to significantly attenuate THC-induced LH suppression indicates that activation of serotonergic 5-HT1A receptors may be an important mode by which THC causes inhibition of LH release in the ovariectomized rat.", 
    "114": "The effect of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) on the acid-base properties and on the solubility of a beta-blocker (pindolol) and of two benzodiazepines (diazepam and chlordiazepoxide) has been assessed. The study was performed by potentiometric and spectrophotometric determinations of the acidity constants and by spectrophotometric evaluation of the solubilities of the pharmaceutical drugs in aqueous solution and in solutions to which was added SDS with concentrations below and above the critical micelle concentration (cmc), at 25 degrees C and at an ionic strength 0.1 M (NaCl). The effect of the organized assemblies on the pKa values was quantified by the application of two theoretical models that differ in the inclusion of ionic exchange between positively charged species in solution. These models have allowed the determination of the binding constants for drug/micelle and yielded values in good agreement with those obtained by the solubility method, and in addition provide a more detailed picture of the effect of drug charge on its partition. The results can be taken to evidence different interaction modes of the drugs with the SDS micelles.",

LV diastolic filling was assessed by pulsed Doppler measurements of transmitral and pulmonary venous flow.",

This was supported by a decrease of E/A ratio (baseline vs 12 months: placebo, 1.06 +/- 0.40 to 0.96 +/- 0.29; metoprolol, 1.09 +/- 0.33 to 0.80 +/- 0.21; P =.05) and prolongation of the isovolumetric relaxation time in the metoprolol treated group (baseline vs 12 months: placebo, 83 +/- 19 ms to 95 +/- 20 ms; metoprolol, 82 +/- 23 ms to 117 +/- 22 ms; P =.01). The difference between mitral A wave and pulmonary venous flow reversal duration was significantly changed during follow-up (baseline vs 12 months: placebo, 22 +/- 11 ms to 24 +/- 11; metoprolol, 11 +/- 21 to 32 +/- 17 ms; P =.02). Patients with normal LV filling pattern at baseline in the metoprolol group preserved a normal LV filling pattern during the study, and patients with restrictive LV filling pattern in the metoprolol group had a nonrestrictive LV filling pattern develop. Maximal or near maximal changes of the diastolic Doppler measurements occurred by 3 months of follow-up, whereas a significant increase in LV ejection fraction was noted after 12 months treatment with metoprolol.", 
    "118": "Long-term treatment with the beta-blocking agent metoprolol seems to improve LV diastolic filling after acute MI. Less restrictive LV filling was noted during beta-blockade indicated by a significant prolongation of the mitral E deceleration time, which was predominantly noted in patients with restrictive LV filling. This observation might have prognostic implications because this LV filling pattern is known to be associated with poor outcome. The changes of LV diastolic filling occurred during the first 3 months, whereas systolic recovery was seen at up to 12 months of treatment.", 
    "119": "In this paper, we describe how user-adapted explanations about drug prescriptions can be generated from already existing data sources. We start by illustrating the two-step approach employed in the first version of the natural language generator and the limitations of generated texts, that we discovered through analytical and empirical evaluations. We claim that, although style refinement would be needed in these texts, particular care should be devoted to implementing some of the persuasion techniques that doctors employ in their explanations. This would require either thoroughly revising the text planning techniques employed or converting to a multistep generation architecture. We justify why we selected this second alternative and propose some heuristics to repair problems found in the first version of the generator. Some final considerations about the advantages of this approach and the possibility of generalizing it to other domains conclude the paper.",

These unmet goals are the reasons why new antihypertensive drugs are synthesized and tested in the clinical practice. This paper briefly mentions the goals of new antihypertensive agents and examines the main pharmacological and clinical features of new classes of antihypertensive drugs, such as angiotensin II receptor blockers, central agents, vasopeptidase inhibitors, and endothelin antagonists. The results of experimental and clinical studies with these new drugs are reviewed, emphasizing some advantages and potential disadvantages of these drugs compared with traditional antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "121": "Poly sodium N-undecyl leucine-leucine (poly SULL) is used as a diagnostic tool to investigate chiral molecular interactions via electrokinetic chromatography (EKC). Poly SULL has two chiral centers which are defined by two asymmetric carbons. Each chiral center of poly SULL can have two possible configurations (D or L). Consequently, four different optical configurations are possible within the surfactant molecule (L-L, D-D, L-D, and D-L). In this study, five chiral analytes of various charge states and hydrophobicities were used to investigate the role of electrostatic interactions and hydrophobicity on chiral recognition with polymeric dipeptide surfactants. These studies lead to a proposed hypothesis for interaction of the analytes with dipeptide surfactants. The hypothesis was tested and the contribution of the double chiral centers to this interaction was evaluated by use of two dipeptide surfactants in which one chiral amino acid is replaced by an achiral amino acid glycine, i.e., poly sodium N-undecyl L-leucine-glycine (poly L-SULG) and poly sodium N-undecyl L-glycine-leucine (poly L-SUGL). The results reported here provide new insights into the mechanism for chiral recognition of select chiral analytes by use of polymeric chiral surfactants.", 
    "122": "Previously, we reported that bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) block the enhancing effects of posttraining systemic or intrahippocampal glucocorticoid administration on memory for inhibitory avoidance training. The present study further examined the basis of this permissive influence of the BLA on hippocampal memory functioning. Immediate posttraining unilateral infusions of the specific glucocorticoid receptor agonist RU 28362 (11beta,17beta-dihydroxy-6, 21-dimethyl-17alpha-pregna-4,6-trien-20-yn-3-one; 3.0, 10.0, or 30.0 ng in 0.5 microliter) administered into the dorsal hippocampus of male Sprague-Dawley rats induced dose-dependent enhancement of 48-h inhibitory avoidance retention. Infusions of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (0.5 microgram in 0.2 microliter) into the ipsilateral, but not the contralateral, BLA 10 min prior to training blocked the hippocampal glucocorticoid effects on memory consolidation. Infusions of the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist atropine (0.5 microgram in 0.2 microliter) into either the ipsilateral or contralateral BLA before training did not block the hippocampal glucocorticoid effects. These findings provide further evidence that beta-adrenergic activity in the BLA is essential in enabling glucocorticoid-induced modulation of memory consolidation and are consistent with the hypothesis that the BLA regulates the strength of memory consolidation in other brain structures. The ipsilateral nature of the BLA-hippocampus interaction indicates that BLA influences on hippocampal memory processes are mediated through neural pathways rather than by influences by means of the activation of peripheral stress responses.", 
    "123": "The authors' recent experimental work has demonstrated that myocardial protection using continuous coronary perfusion with warm beta-blocker-enriched blood avoids myocardial ischaemia and minimizes myocardial oedema formation, thus completely preserving left ventricle function. The purpose of this clinical study was to compare this alternative technique in terms of structural and functional myocardial protection with the routinely used crystalloid Bretschneider cardioplegia. Sixty coronary artery surgery patients were randomized to receive either crystalloid cardioplegia or continuous coronary perfusion with warm blood enriched with the ultra-short acting beta-blocker esmolol. Cardiac function was evaluated using transoesophageal echocardiography (fractional area of contraction) and cardiac metabolism using arterial-coronary sinus lactate concentration difference (a - csD(LAC)). From left ventricular biopsies, the authors determined myocardial oedema, heat-shock-protein-70, intercellular-adhesion-molecule and actin pattern. Patients with crystalloid cardioplegia received 3.6 +/- 0.8 grafts during 64 +/- 20 min cross-clamp time (beta-blocker: 3.5 +/- 0.9 grafts during 68 +/- 22 min; NS). Following cross-clamp removal crystalloid cardioplegia hearts released significant lactate amounts (a- csD(LAC)) - 1.0 +/- 0.6 versus - 0.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/litre in beta-blocker hearts; P < 0.05). In crystalloid cardioplegia hearts, myocardial water content increased from 82.1 +/- 2.1% pre-cardiopulmonary bypass to 83.2 +/- 1.7% at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass (P < 0.05); in beta-blocker hearts myocardial water content remained unchanged (pre-cardiopulmonary bypass: 82.3 +/- 1.9%; end of cardiopulmonary bypass: 82.4 +/- 1.7%; NS). At the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, left ventricular biopsies of beta-blocker hearts showed less structural damage as determined by heat shock protein-70, intercellular adhesion molecule-I and deranged actin cross-striation pattern as compared with crystalloid cardioplegia hearts (P < 0.05). The post-cardiopulmonary bypass fractional area of contraction was similar in both groups (beta-blocker: 65 +/- 14%; crystalloid cardioplegia: 62 +/- 16%); however, beta-blocker patients required less inotropic stimulation (dopamine: beta-blocker: 2.9 +/- 2.5 versus crystalloid cardioplegia: 5.0 +/- 2.3 microg/kg per min; P < 0.05). The data suggest that continuous coronary perfusion with warm esmolol-enriched blood results in better myocardial protection compared with crystalloid cardioplegia. It is concluded that the concept of beta-blocker-induced cardiac surgical conditions may be a useful alternative for myocardial protection during coronary artery surgery.", 
    "124": "Steroid hormones exert their biological actions via intracellular receptors modulation of transcription. In addition, a number of molecular interactions, and the existence of membrane receptors in several tissues, support the hypothesis of nongenomic action of steroids. The androgens, 5alpha- and 5beta-dihydrotestosterone (0.1 to 100 microM), induce a rapid positive inotropism in the isolated left atrium of male Wistar rats whose time course of response might suggest that it is a non-genomic effect. However, the fact that the facilitation of contractility was inhibited by actinomycin D (5 microg/ml) and cycloheximide (10 microg/ml) indicates that a transcriptional component might play a role. The existence of a rapid functional genomic role would be somewhat surprising. However, rapid transcriptional mechanisms were also observed in certain cAMP-dependent responses. In the left atrium of rat, Rp-cAMPS (10 microM), a cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, antagonized 5alpha- but not 5beta-dihydrotestosterone-induced positive inotropism. The inhibition by Rp-cAMPS of isoproterenol- and forskolin-induced positive inotropism, and the fact that these cAMP-dependent effects were also inhibited by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, suggest that a cAMP-dependent transcriptional component may be partly involved in the positive inotropism induced by 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone. In addition, 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone might increase the basal adenylyl cyclase activity by acting on unoccupied beta-adrenoceptor-G-protein-adenylyl cyclase complexes, since the elicited inotropism was inhibited by a beta-blocker, atenolol (1 microM), a G-protein inhibitor, pertussis toxin (2 microg/ml, 3 h), and an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, dideoxy-adenosine (10 microM).", 
    "125": "The effect of 1alpha,25-dihydroxylumisterol3 (1alpha,25(OH)2lumisterol3) on insulin release from rat pancreatic beta-cells was measured to investigate the nongenomic action of vitamin D via the putative membrane vitamin D receptor (mVDR). 1Alpha,25(OH)2lumisterol3, a specific agonist of mVDR, dose-dependently augmented 16.7 mM glucose-induced insulin release from rat pancreatic islets and increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), though not increasing Ca2+ efficacy in the exocytotic system. These effects were completely abolished by an antagonist of mVDR, 1beta,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1beta,25(OH)2D3), or by a blocker of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, nitrendipine. Moreover, both [Ca2+]i elevation, caused by membrane depolarization, and sufficient intracellular glucose metabolism are required for the expression of these effects. 1Alpha,25(OH)2lumisterol3, therefore, has a rapid insulinotropic effect, through nongenomic signal transduction via mVDR, that would be dependent on the augmentation of Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels on the plasma membrane, being also linked to metabolic signals derived from glucose in pancreatic beta-cells. However, further investigations will be needed to discuss physiologically the meaning of insulinotropic effects of vitamin D through mVDR.", 
    "126": "After control of variceal bleeding, the risk of recurrent bleeding approaches 70%. In secondary prophylaxis, both endoscopic therapy (sclerotherapy or banding ligation) and pharmacotherapy (beta-blockers with or without isosorbide-5-mononitrate) are effective in reducing the rate of rebleeding. The effect on mortality is less striking and in some studies not significant. Although many randomized trials are published, we lack criteria for selection of the optimal therapy in the individual patient in routine daily practice. The designs of published studies are multiple, with differences in timing of randomization, severity and causes of liver disease, definitions of end-points such as rebleeding, duration of follow-up, etc. These variations in addition to variation in the natural history and treatment given in the control groups make comparisons between studies difficult. This review summarizes the endoscopic and pharmacological treatment for the secondary prevention of variceal bleeding.", 
    "127": "Immediate hypersensitivity reactions in the intestinal mucosa evoke active chloride secretion which enhances the elimination of luminal antigens. The prosecretory actions of histamine and other soluble mediators of anaphylaxis are mediated by submucosal neurons, as are the antisecretory actions of opioid antidiarrheal medications. We tested the hypothesis that the selective delta-opioid receptor agonist [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE) alters anaphylaxis-associated ileal anion secretion in vitro. Sheets of ileal mucosa with attached submucosa from guinea pigs sensitized to cow's milk were mounted in Ussing chambers under short-circuit conditions. Mucosal sheets responded to the serosal application of the milk protein, beta-lactoglobulin, with a rapid rise in transepithelial short-circuit current (Isc); in contrast, the egg protein, ovalbumin, was without effect. Pretreatment of tissues with the neuronal conduction blocker, saxitoxin, or the H1 histamine receptor antagonist, diphenhydramine, but not the opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone, significantly reduced mucosal responses to antigen. [D-Pen-2, D-Pen5]enkephalin (0.1 microM, serosal addition) decreased baseline Isc, but potentiated mucosal responses to antigen; its effects were abolished in tissues pretreated with naloxone. These results suggest that immediate hypersensitivity reactions in the guinea pig ileal mucosa are mediated by submucosal neural circuits that are phasically modulated by both mast cell products and opioids.", 
    "128": "The selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor citalopram (0-40 mg kg(-1), s.c., - 60 min) did not affect the male rat ejaculatory behavior, and there were no statistically significant effects of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexane carboxamide 3HCl (WAY-100635) (0.04-0.08 mg kg(-1), s.c., - 30 min). When combined, there was a marked, and statistically significant, prolongation of the ejaculation latency in comparison with saline treated controls, as well as in comparison with either drug by itself. This citalopram (10.0)/WAY-100635 (0.04)-induced effect was fully antagonized by the administration of the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist isamoltane (4.0 mg kg(-1)). There were no consistent effects on other aspects of the male rat sexual behavior, i.e., number of mounts and intromissions preceding ejaculation and the post-ejaculatory interval. Finally, the intromission latency was also markedly enhanced in animals receiving both citalopram and WAY-100635, and at the higher dose of WAY-100635 (0.08 mg kg(-1)) 7 out of 18 animals failed to initiate copulation. It is suggested that blockade of inhibitory 5-HT1A autoreceptors discloses inhibitory effects of the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor citalopram on male rat ejaculatory behavior mediated via stimulation of 5-HT1B receptors.", 
    "129": "Congenital aneurysms or diverticula of the left ventricle are rare findings that can be detected by both echocardiography and/or left ventricular angiography. We investigated 16 adult patients presenting either with left ventricular aneurysms (n = 8, mean age 33 +/- 12 years) or diverticula (n = 8, mean age 53 +/- 15 years). In 6 patients the first manifestation of the disease were ventricular arrhythmias, while in the remaining 10 patients the diagnosis was established after echocardiographic examination or cardiac catheterization in search of embolic events, valvular disease or atypical chest pain. In all patients ischaemic heart disease, dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy could be ruled out. Most of the aneurysms and diverticula were localized below the mitral valve. Patients underwent surgery (n = 1), implantation of cardioverter-defibrillator ICD (n = 2), radiofrequency catheter ablation (n = 1) or drug therapy with class III antiarrhythmics or beta-adrenergic blocking agents (n = 8). Four patients are receiving long-term anticoagulation.

    "131": "1. Chronic selective beta1-adrenoceptor (beta1AR) blocker treatment enhances the sensitivity of beta2-adrenoceptor (beta2AR) in human heart (Hall et al., 1990; 1991). To clarify the mechanism of the cross-sensitization between beta1AR and beta2AR, we determined whether the stimulatory G-protein (G(s)alpha) function is increased in atria from beta1AR-blocker treated patients compared with non-beta-blocked patients, and investigated whether this change is caused by an alteration of post-translational modification of Gsalpha protein. 2. G(s)alpha function was determined by reconstitution of human atrial G(s)alpha into S49 cyc- cell membranes. In the reconstitution system, GTPgammaS stimulated cyclic AMP generation in a dose-dependent manner. Upon 10(-4) M GTPgammaS stimulation, G(s)alpha activity in the beta1AR-blocker, atenolol, treated group (78.2+/-10. 3 pmol cyclic AMP mg(-1) min(-1) 10(-3)) was 65% higher than that in non-beta-blocked patients (47.3+/-6.3 pmol cyclic AMP mg(-1) min(-1) 10(-3), n=15, P=0.02). 3. Isoelectric point (pI) valu G(s)alpha were measured by two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-E) and the amount of each isoform quantified by image analysis of a Western blot of the gel using specific antibody. Multiple isoforms of G(s)alpha were detected by 2D-E with different pI values. There were no significant differences between the groups of patients in either pI values or the proportions of the acidic isoforms of G(s)alpha to the main basic form (n=12, P>0.05). 4. The results suggest that chronic beta1AR-blockade enhances Gsalpha function in human atrium, and this may account in part for the hypersensitivity of beta2AR and other Gs-coupled receptors during beta1AR-blockade. The increased G(s)alpha function is unlikely to be caused directly by blockade of protein kinase A phosphorylation of G(s)alpha protein.", 
    "132": "1. The relaxant effects of isoprenaline may result from activation of another beta-adrenoceptor subtype in addition to beta1 and beta2. This study evaluated the role of a third beta-adrenoceptor subtype, beta3, in beta-adrenoceptor-induced relaxation of rat thoracic aorta by isoprenaline. 2. Isoprenaline produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of phenylephrine pre-contracted rings of the thoracic aorta (pD2=7.46+/-0.15; Emax=85.9+/-3.4%), which was partially attenuated by endothelium removal (Emax=66.5+/-6.3%) and administration of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, L-NG-monomethyl arginine (L-NMMA) (Emax=61.3+/-7.9%). 3. In the presence of nadolol, a beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist, isoprenaline-induced relaxation persisted (Emax=55.6+/-5.3%), but occurred at higher concentrations (pD2=6.71+/-0.10) than in the absence of nadolol and lasted longer. 4. Similar relaxant effects were obtained with two beta3-adrenoceptor agonists: SR 58611 (a preferential beta3-adrenoceptor agonist), and CGP 12177 (a partial beta3-adrenoceptor with beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor antagonistic properties). SR 58611 caused concentration-dependent relaxation (pD2=5.24+/-0.07; Emax=59.5+/-3.7%), which was not modified by pre-treatment with nadolol but antagonized by SR 59230A, a beta3-adrenoceptor antagonist. The relaxation induced by SR 58611 was associated with a 1.7 fold increase in tissue cyclic GMP content. 5 Both relaxation and the cyclic GMP increase induced by SR 58611 were greatly reduced by endothelium removal and in the presence of L-NMMA. 6 We conclude that in the rat thoracic aorta, beta3-adrenoceptors are mainly located on endothelial cells, and act in conjuction with beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors to mediate relaxation through activation of an NO synthase pathway and subsequent increase in cyclic GMP levels.", 
    "133": "The putative beta4-adrenoceptor mediates positive inotropic effects, action potential shortening and arrhythmias in ferret ventricle. Here we compared the affinity of carvedilol at the putative beta4-adrenoceptor and beta1-adrenoceptor, activated by (+/-)-CGP 12177 and (-)-isoprenaline, respectively. In paced right ventricular preparations, carvedilol (0.01-10 micromol/l) was a simple competitive antagonist of the positive inotropic effects of (+/-)-CGP 12177 (slope of Schild-plot = 1.02, pK(B) = 6.8) and (-)-isoprenaline (slope of Schild-plot = 0.98, pK(B) = 8.1). Carvedilol also blocked putative beta4- and beta1-adrenoceptors of left ventricle, left atrium and sino-atrial pacemaker. Carvedilol therefore interacts with the putative beta4-adrenoceptor according to the law of mass action and may provide a lead in the development of putative beta4-adrenoceptor-selective antagonists.", 
    "134": "Some recent trials have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or beta blockers can improve left ventricular (LV) function and decrease LV mass in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC). We assessed the prevalence and predictors of patients with IDC that showed marked reverse remodeling (a decrease in LV end-diastolic dimension > or = 5 mm to a final LV end-diastolic dimension < or = 55 mm and an increase in percent LV fractional shortening > or = 5% to a final percent fractional shortening of > or = 25% and a decrease in LV mass > or = 10%) after 2 years of intensive therapy with ACE inhibitors and/or beta blockers. In 78 patients with IDC (mean age 51 +/- 14 years), the clinical, echocardiographic, hemodynamic, laboratory, and endomyocardial biopsy data were evaluated at diagnosis and serial echocardiography was performed for 2 years. After 2 years of therapy, 20 of 78 patients (26%) showed marked reverse remodeling. Multivariate analysis revealed that higher systolic blood pressure (135 +/- 17 vs 120 +/- 16 mm Hg, p <0.001) and lower pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (7 +/- 3 vs 12 +/- 8 mm Hg, p <0.01) at diagnosis were independent predictors of reverse remodeling. Then, we further analyzed the prognosis of these patients for a mean of 50 +/- 32 months; 5-year survival (p <0.02) and event-free rates (p = 0.001) were better in patients with reverse remodeling than in patients without reverse remodeling.", 
    "135": "This study provides data on post-hospitalization medication treatment trends for unstable angina between 1990 and 1995. We conducted an observational cohort study at the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System (VAPSHCS). Computerized records of hospital discharges and cardiac catheterizations were used to identify unstable angina diagnoses among veterans between 1990 and 1995. Discharge medications issued within 90 days after discharge were ascertained from computerized outpatient pharmacy records. Of the 1,100 veterans discharged with unstable angina, 885 (80%) filled a prescription through the VAPSHCS within 90 days after discharge. Neither use of aspirin nor use of beta blockers increased between 1990 and 1995: overall use averaged 76% for aspirin (78% of those without potential contraindications) and 32% for beta blockers (36% of those without potential contraindications). Use of non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists--primarily diltiazem--decreased from 57% to 40% (p <0.01), whereas use of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists increased from 12% to 26% (p <0.01). Thus, pharmacy records indicated that aspirin use was high although it was lower than expected, possibly due to ready availability outside the VAPSHCS pharmacy. The low frequency of beta-blocker use and the increasing reliance on dihydropyridine calcium antagonists through 1995 to treat unstable angina may be an opportunity to improve veteran care according to Agency for Health Care Policy Research recommendations.",

    "142": "All patients were initially treated with antithyroid drugs, and levothyroxine was added in 16 subjects to maintain euthyroidism. The median duration of drug treatment was 21 months. Ultimately, 24/33 patients (73%) received radioiodine following a trial of antithyroid drugs because of a) side effects of antithyroid medication (in 3 patients); b) inadequate response to medication (in 8 patients); and c) relapse (in 13 patients), which occurred at a median of 6 (range 1 to 16) months following cessation of drug therapy. Five patients required a second dose of radioiodine and 2 patients required 3 doses. Of the 24 patients treated with radioiodine, at last follow-up after the most recent treatment (median 18.5, range 3 to 55 months), 6 patients were euthyroid, 16 required thyroxine replacement, and 2 were-still, or again, hyperthyroid.", 
    "143": "In our population of children and adolescents, treatment of hyperthyroidism with antithyroid drugs frequently resulted in either side effects, inadequate response to medication or subsequent relapse, all of which led to radioiodine therapy. We conclude, therefore, that radioiodine could be considered as one of the first-line options in older children and adolescents with hyperthyroidism.", 
    "144": "The pharmacokinetics of celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, was characterized in beagle dogs. Celecoxib is extensively metabolized by dogs to a hydroxymethyl metabolite with subsequent oxidization to the carboxylic acid analog. There are at least two populations of dogs, distinguished by their capacity to eliminate celecoxib from plasma at either a fast or a slow rate after i.v. administration. Within a population of 242 animals, 45.0% were of the EM phenotype, 53.5% were of the PM phenotype, and 1.65% could not be adequately characterized. The mean (+/-S.D.) plasma elimination half-life and clearance of celecoxib were 1.72 +/- 0.79 h and 18.2 +/- 6.4 ml/min/kg for EM dogs and 5.18 +/- 1.29 h and 7.15 +/- 1.41 ml/min/kg for PM dogs. Hepatic microsomes from EM dogs metabolized celecoxib at a higher rate than microsomes from PM dogs. The cDNA for canine cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes, CYP2B11, CYP2C21, CYP2D15, and CYP3A12 were cloned and expressed in sf 9 insect cells. Three new variants of CYP2D15 as well as a novel variant of CYP3A12 were identified. Canine rCYP2D15 and its variants, but not CYP2B11, CYP2C21, and CYP3A12, readily metabolized celecoxib. Quinidine (a specific CYP2D inhibitor) prevented celecoxib metabolism in dog hepatic microsomes, providing evidence of a predominant role for the CYP2D subfamily in canine celecoxib metabolism. However, the lack of a correlation between celecoxib and bufuralol metabolism in hepatic EM or PM microsomes indicates that other CYP subfamilies besides CYP2D may contribute to the polymorphism in canine celecoxib metabolism.",

    "147": "The transfected Caco-2 cells formed a tight monolayer with TEER values and mannitol transport similar to the untransfected parent cell strain (wild type). However, the transfected cells (grown onto Millicell) reached maturity approximately 33% faster than the wild-type cells. Permeabilities of propranolol, nifedipine, testosterone, linopirdine, mannitol, and cephalexin were similar in transfected and wild-type Caco-2 cells. On the other hand, the transfected cells of early passages were much more metabolically active, and metabolized standard CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., testosterone and nifedipine) as much as 100 times faster than untransfected cells. In addition, metabolism of standard substrates was inhibitable by ketoconazole and TAO. Using comparable data, the transfected cells metabolized testosterone the fastest, followed by linopirdine and nifedipine (approximate ratio: 10:6:2). The metabolites of standard substrates were generally preferably excreted to the apical membrane.",
