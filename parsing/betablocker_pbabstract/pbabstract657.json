Intensified symptoms of intoxication and the possibility of overdose parallel the current fad of smoking \"freebase.\" We examined the \"cocaine reaction,\" an adrenergic storm affecting CNS, respiratory and cardiovascular systems, which may proceed to generalized collapse and death within minutes. The physiologic and pharmacologic mechanisms of the reaction are elaborated, and a logical algorithm of treatment is outlined. The psychodynamics of the \"armed\" cocaine personality is discussed, as is the proper psychological approach to these patients. A specific indicated technical and pharmacologic approach, as well as several caveats of therapy that have been clinically developed in the treatment of several hundred cases of cocaine overdose, are presented.", 
    "1": "Two out of four pigeons were successfully trained in an operant procedure to discriminate between the presence and absence of the effects induced by d-amphetamine (final dose: 1.6 mg/kg). The solvent (saline) or d-amphetamine was administered intramuscularly (IM) 30 min prior to training. Tests with other drugs and dosages indicated that l-amphetamine (ED50 = 0.55 mg/kg) and cocaine (ED50 = 1.05 mg/kg) fully generalized to d-amphetamine (ED50 = 0.35 mg/kg), whereas drugs such as p-hydroxy-amphetamine (1.6 and 3.2 mg/kg), morphine (1.5, 3.0 and, 6.0 mg/kg), and delta 9-THC (0.125, 0.25, and 0.50 mg/kg) failed to do so at the doses tested. Apomorphine (0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg) and LSD-25 (0.04 and 0.08 mg/kg) produced intermediate results. Pretreatment with haloperidol (dose range: 0.04 to 1.28 mg/kg), but not propranolol (10 and 20 mg/kg), attenuated significantly the d-amphetamine (1.6 mg/kg) stimulus effects. The two pigeons emitted predominantly d-amphetamine appropriate responses when the training dose (1.6 mg/kg) of d-amphetamine was tested on different occasions 15, 60, and 120 min after the administrations. One bird emitted mostly vehicle appropriate responses when tested 240 min after the d-amphetamine injection whereas the other bird performed d-amphetamine appropriate responses. Selection of the non-drug associated key occurred in the two birds when testing was carried out 480 min (8 hrs) after the administration of d-amphetamine.", 
    "2": "The effect of dopamine on coronary and systemic circulation was examined in an experimental study on dogs using catheterization and extracorporeal perfusion of the bypassing branch of the left coronary artery, and simultaneous recording of heart's vascular resistance as well as cardio- and hemodynamic patterns. Dopamine introduced into coronary perfusion flow caused a dilatation of coronary vessels, a reflex drop in arterial blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance, and changes in heart rate and intensity of cardiac contractions. Dopamine dosage should be about ten times as high to reproduce cardiodynamic and hemodynamic effects, comparable with the response to adrenaline and noradrenaline in terms of magnitude and pattern of development. Coronary vessels are dilated in two steps, through cholinergic activation and direct stimulation of beta-adrenoreactive systems. These two phases can be blocked by atropine and obsidan, respectively. After m-cholinergic and beta-adrenoreactive systems are blocked, dopamine produces a slight coronary vasoconstriction.", 
    "3": "1 Effects of propranolol and diltiazem on ganglionic transmission in the superior cervical ganglion of the guinea-pig were investigated with intracellular recording techniques. 2 Propranolol and diltiazem (5 X 10(-6)-10(-5) M) induced a transmission failure in the ganglion upon preganglionic nerve stimulation at high frequency (25-30 Hz) without affecting action potentials induced by direct stimulation of the soma membrane, or potentials induced by iontophoretically applied acetylecholine. 3 The results suggest that propranolol and diltiazem may act on preganglionic nerve terminals to inhibit Ca2+ influx in a frequency-dependent manner. These agents may depress excess sympathetic activity without much affecting normal ganglionic transmission.", 
    "4": "The possible modulatory role of the sympathetic nervous system on testosterone aromatization and 5 alpha reduction by rat pineal gland was examined in vitro. NE (10 microM) added to pineal organ cultures increased by 72% the conversion of [14C]testosterone into estradiol and depressed by 39 and 53% that into the 5 alpha-reduced metabolites 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (5-DHT) and 5 alpha-androstanediol (5 alpha-diol). Both effects of NE were negated by the addition of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol but not by the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine. Dibutyryl cAMP (0.1 mM) mimicked the effect of NE on pineal [14C]testosterone metabolism; it also mimicked the NE-induced inhibition of [14C]progesterone reduction to 5 alpha-pregnanedione and 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one by rat pineal gland explants. At the end of the dark phase of the daily photoperiod, pineal aromatization of testosterone was significantly higher, and 5 alpha reduction lower, than in rats killed at noon. Pineal glands obtained from rats subjected to superior cervical ganglionectomy 12 h earlier exhibited increased conversion of [14C]testosterone into estradiol, and depressed synthesis of 5 alpha-reduced metabolites, as compared with their respective sham-operated controls. 3 days after ganglionectomy a diminished testosterone aromatization was found. These results suggest that the increased release of NE from pineal sympathetic nerve endings stimulates testosterone aromatization and inhibits 5 alpha reduction via a beta-adrenoceptor.", 
    "5": "In the pithed normotensive rat the adrenoceptors involved in the hypertensive and tachycardic effects of the indirectly acting sympathomimetic agent tyramine and of electrical stimulation of the spinal cord (TH5-L4 or C7-Th1) were analyzed. The tools used for the identification of the adrenoceptors were the selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocking drug prazosin, the selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine, the beta-1 blocker atenolol and the selective beta-2 adrenoceptor blocking agent ICI 118,551. The participation of vascular alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the pressor response of tyramine was shown. The increase in blood pressure induced by electrical stimulation of the spinal cord (TH5-L4) was used to demonstrate that alpha-2 adrenoceptors were activated via ganglionic muscarinic receptors. The tachycardia evoked by electrical stimulation of the spinal cord (C7-Th1) was not influenced by beta-2 adrenoceptor blockade. It was enhanced, however, by the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine. It is hypothesized that activation of ganglionic nicotinic receptors leads to stimulation of the nearest varicosities interfering with alpha-1 adrenoceptors. However, activation of ganglionic muscarinic receptors may lead to an additional release of neurotransmitter in the more distant varicosities endowed with alpha-2 or beta-2 adrenoceptors.", 
    "6": "Beta-adrenergic receptor characteristics and adenylate cyclase responses to different stimuli were measured in lymphocyte membrane preparations of six normal control subjects and five allergic asthmatic patients with mild airways disease and increased bronchial reactivity to histamine and acetylcholine. The determinations were performed just before and 24 hr after inhalation challenge with house-dust mite antigen to investigate the influence of an allergen-induced asthmatic attack on the beta-adrenergic receptor system. Before the house-dust mite challenge, the lymphocyte membranes of the patients showed a normal receptor density, dissociation constant for (-)3H-dihydroalprenolol, and adenylate cyclase response to isoproterenol, guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate, (GppNHp) and NaF. After the allergen-induced asthmatic reaction, however, the beta-adrenergic receptor number in the patients was significantly reduced by 21%, while the basal adenylate cyclase activity and isoproterenol-, GppNHp-, and NaF-induced cyclic AMP responses were simultaneously reduced by about 40%. The allergen challenge had no significant effect on the lymphocyte membranes of the control subjects. These results suggest (1) that a reduced beta-adrenergic function is not an intrinsic component of allergic bronchial asthma but is rather the consequence of an active disease state, and (2) that next to changes in beta-adrenergic receptor number, alterations distal to the receptor may play an important role in the observed decrease in beta-adrenergic responsiveness.", 
    "7": "Adrenergic influence on iris pigmentation in newborn pigmented rabbits was studied. Selective adrenergic antagonists were used topically to determine whether they could inhibit iris pigmentation. Unilateral, topical administration of an alpha-adrenergic antagonist (thymoxamine hydrochloride 1/2%) was not associated with iris hypochromia. Adrenergic influence on iris stromal melanogenesis appears to be mediated by alpha-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "8": "Agonists that increase intracellular cAMP in bovine parathyroid cells ((l)-isoproterenol (ISO), dopamine, prostaglandin E2) as well as cAMP analogs (dibutyryl cAMP and 8-bromo-cAMP) stimulated the phosphorylation of 2 endogenous proteins with apparent molecular weights of 19K and 15K. The time course and concentration-dependence of ISO-stimulated phosphorylation in these cells correlated well with known effects of ISO on intracellular cAMP and PTH release. ISO-stimulated phosphorylation of these two proteins was rapidly reversed by (l)-propranolol. Although 2 mM extracellular calcium inhibited ISO-stimulated PTH secretion, it did not significantly affect the phosphorylation of the 19K and 15K bands. These results are consistent with a physiologic role for the phosphorylation of these proteins in agonist-stimulated PTH secretion in bovine parathyroid cells.", 
    "9": "In two pressure and volume overload models of canine right ventricular hypertrophy, we have demonstrated significant hypertrophy of both the left and the right ventricles. The extent of hypertrophy was correlated positively to the extent of the increase in plasma epinephrine in both volume and pressure overload models. Attenuation or ablation of plasma epinephrine through the administration of propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, or by denervation of the adrenal medulla prevented the hypertrophy process. No hemodynamic parameter was altered consistently in a parallel manner to hypertrophy. This is the first report of concurrent right and left ventricular hypertrophy in response to pressure or volume overload of the right ventricle. These studies further implicate epinephrine as a major trophic hormone of the heart.", 
    "10": "(1) When incremental infusions of drugs that increase blood pressure are given to human subjects to assess \"pressor responsiveness,\" only the lower part of the sigmoid dose-response curve can be obtained. (2) Fitting a quadratic function does not involve discarding data points, which is usually the case with a linear fit, and it provides a more satisfactory fit to the lower part of a sigmoid dose-response curve. (3) In the presence of a competitive antagonist, a pressor dose-response curve will be shifted to the right. In this situation the dose-response curves obtained before and after treatment with antagonist should be fitted simultaneously to a quadratic model in which the parallel shift is one of the parameters. (4) The use of quadratic fitting is illustrated by reference to clinical experiments to obtain the following three curves for drugs that modify peripheral alpha adrenoceptors: norepinephrine pressor response curves after placebo and doxazosin, an alpha 1 antagonist; norepinephrine pressor response curves after placebo, labetalol, and medroxalol (drugs with combined alpha 1 and beta blocking properties); and phenylephrine pressor response curves before and after prazosin. (5) Fitting a quadratic function is the appropriate initial step in the analysis of pressor dose-response curves in man.", 
    "11": "Beta-adrenergic blockade increases peripheral vascular resistances acutely and paradoxically lowers arterial blood pressure in most species but not in the rat. In this study the hypothesis has been tested of a significant participation of unopposed alpha-adrenergic mediated vasoconstriction following beta-adrenergic blockade in blood pressure regulation of conscious rats. Alpha-adrenergic blockade in propranolol-pretreated rats significantly decreased mean arterial blood pressure by 22%, heart rate by 20%, and total peripheral resistance by 14% when compared to rats treated only with propranolol, whereas cardiac output was similar in the two groups. A significant 28% reduction of coronary blood flow in rats treated with alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers, when compared to rats treated only with propranolol, is most likely related to phentolamine's indirect effects on the coronary vasculature. Cerebrovascular and renovascular resistances were similar in these groups. All changes reported were significant at the 95% confidence level. It is concluded that the mechanism of increased blood pressure following beta-adrenergic blockade in rats is related at least in part to unmasking of unopposed alpha-receptor tone, which, however, is minimal in the coronary, cerebral and renal circulations.", 
    "12": "Chronic migrainous neuralgia is not diagnosed as often as the periodic or \"cluster\" form of Horton's syndrome. The distinguishing features of chronic migrainous neuralgia, compared with the periodic variety, are the frequency and persistence of the attacks of hemicraniofacial pain and the intractability to medical management. Eight male patients ranging in age from 22 to 45 years received prompt, although transient, pain relief by blockade of the Gasserian ganglion on the side of their hemifacial pain with a local anesthetic. Prolonged relief was subsequently achieved by percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal ganglio-rhizolysis. There were no significant complications from this procedure. Review of the literature indicated that other ablative neurosurgical procedures, such as alcohol injection of the Gasserian ganglion and trigeminal rhizotomy by the subtemporal craniectomy approach, have relieved migrainous neuralgia, but with a greater risk and incidence of complications. The characteristic clinical features of migrainous neuralgia and the medical and surgical approaches to therapy are discussed.", 
    "13": "Central hemodynamic responses evoked by standardized hemorrhage (exsanguination of 20 ml x kg bwt-1) were followed during 2 h in cats with intact and blocked vascular beta 2-adrenoceptors using the 'selective' beta 2-blocker, ICI 118, 551. In the first 10 min after bleeding blood pressure and cardiac output (CO) decreased and total peripheral resistance (TPR) increased by the same amount in the 'intact' and beta 2-blocked animals. Whereas blood pressure later on reached approximately the same hypotension level in both groups, other hemodynamic variables were distinctly different. In the 'intact' animals there was a gradual, partial recovery of stroke volume (SV) and CO in the face of a restoration to control of TPR. In the beta 2-blocked animals TPR continued to increase in the face of a maintained low CO and declining SV. The lower SV in the latter group was ascribed to abolition of beta 2-adrenergic restoration of plasma volume via absorption of tissue fluid into the circulation. The gradual decline of TPR in the 'intact' animals was attributed to beta 2-adrenergic dilator interaction with constrictor influences on the resistance vessels. It is concluded that beta-adrenergic vascular control mechanisms help to improve nutritional tissue blood flow during hemorrhage by increasing plasma volume, and hence venous return and CO, and by decreasing TPR. These reflex, beta 2-adrenergic circulatory events are similar to those aimed at in current shock therapy by transfusion and vasodilator treatment.", 
    "14": "Hemorrhage is associated with absorption of extravascular fluid from skeletal muscle to blood in order to compensate for the loss of intravascular volume. Our previous studies have shown that this fluid gain is mainly linked to beta-adrenergic microvascular adjustments leading to decrease in capillary hydrostatic pressure and to precapillary 'sphincter' mediated increase in the capillary surface area available for fluid exchange. In the present study the importance of beta-adrenergic control of plasma volume in bleeding was confirmed by measurement of changes in plasma volume after graded hemorrhage in animals with intact and blocked vascular beta 2-adrenoceptors (i.v. administration of the 'selective' beta 2-blocking agent ICI 118, 551). With intact beta 2-adrenoceptors plasma volume was gradually restored after bleeding so that about 50% of the shed plasma volume (about 35% of the shed blood volume) had been compensated for at two hours after exsanguination of 20% as well as 40% of the blood volume. The corresponding figures in animals with blocked beta 2-adrenoceptors were only 14% of the shed plasma volume and 8% of the shed blood volume at both degrees of hemorrhage.", 
    "15": "A single blind randomized study on the effect of betablockers with (Pindolol = P, 0.4 mg i.v., n = 10) and without (Metoprolol = M, 5 mg i.v., n = 11) intrinsic sympathicomimetic activity (ISA) on local wall-motion abnormalities was performed in 21 patients with coronary heart disease in anterior wall hypokinesia. Before and 10 minutes after intravenous application of P or M strokes, volume index, cardiac index, heart rate, systolic and enddiastolic left-ventricular pressure were measured. The left-ventricular volumes were calculated biplane with the area-length method of Dodge and Sandler. Analysis of wall-motion disorders were performed by hemichord method measuring 7 hemiaxis and 1 long axis.", 
    "16": "Similar hemodynamic effects of both beta-blockers were found on LVEDP und LV-EDVI. Different effects were observed on heart rate and ejection fraction. With M heart rate and ejection fraction decreased, with P heart rate and ejection fraction increased significantly due to the intrinsic sympathicomimetic activity (ISA). Shortening of hypokinetic wall segments was improved by both P and M, shortening of non-hypokinetic contralateral segments, however, remained unchanged with P and decreased with M. With P shortening of chords was improved, whereas with M shortening of chords decreased. Our findings suggest that in therapy of patients with coronary heart disease differential use of beta-blocking agents with or without ISA has to be discussed.", 
    "17": "The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of dopamine on gastric antral motility in conscious dogs with gastric fistula, using intraluminal strain-gauge transducers. Infusion of bethanechol increased the motility with regard to both frequency and strength. Dopamine, an endogenous catecholamine, was used alone and in conjunction with selective blockade of adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. The stimulated antral motility was dose-dependently inhibited by dopamine. The effect was significantly blocked by the peripherally acting dopaminergic blocker domperidone. The alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phentolamine reduced the effect of dopamine to some extent, but the reduction was not of statistical significance. The dopamine-inhibited motility was not altered by the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker practolol or the beta 1 + beta 2-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol. This indicates that dopamine acts on gastric antral motility predominantly through dopaminergic receptors. beta-Adrenergic receptors, which are active in the impairment of gastric acid secretion, do not seem to be involved in the motility response. Dose-response investigations with five increasing doses of bethanechol and one dose of dopamine showed inhibition of a non-competitive type.", 
    "18": "The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of isoprenaline on gastric antral motility in conscious dogs with gastric fistula, using intraluminal strain-gauge transducers. Infusion of bethanechol increased the motility for both frequency and strength. Isoprenaline, a beta 1- and beta 2-agonist, was used alone and in conjunction with selective blockade of beta 1 and beta 2 receptors. The stimulated antral motility was dose-dependently inhibited by isoprenaline. The effect was significantly blocked by the beta 1 + beta 2-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol and by using in conjunction the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker practolol and the beta 2-adrenoceptor blocker H 35/25. H 35/25 and particularly practolol reduced the effect of isoprenaline to some extent, but the reduction was not of statistical significance. This indicates that isoprenaline acts on antral motility through both beta 2 and beta 1 receptors. Dose-response experiments with five logarithmically increasing doses of bethanechol and one dose of isoprenaline showed inhibition of a non-competitive type.", 
    "19": "1. The present work investigates in vitro the inhibitory dose-response curves to histamine, 4-methyl-histamine and 2-pyridylethylamine in depolarized (KCl 37 mM) uterus from estrogenous sensitized rats. 2. Dose-response curves for the various agonists were obtained in the absence and presence of selective histaminergic (clemizole and cimetidine) and adrenergic (propranolol and reserpine) blocking drugs. 3. Histamine and 4-methyl-histamine, but not 2-pyridylethylamine, produced dose-dependent relaxations of the uterus. 4. Neither clemizole nor propranolol displaced the inhibitory dose-response curves for histamine. 5. After adrenergic blockade with either propranolol or reserpine, cimetidine produced a rightward displacement of the dose-response curves to histamine. 6. Theses results suggest that the inhibitory effect of histamine is mediated through activation of H2 histamine uterine receptors.", 
    "20": "The connection between decreased concentration of HDL-cholesterol in the serum and increased risk of arteriosclerosis has attracted the attention to such sizes of influence which are able to decrease the HDL-cholesterol-concentration. In these cases the question is asked, whether the analytic reliability of the techniques which are at the disposal for the estimation of HDL-cholesterol is sufficient for the recognition of the changes of the concentration to be expected. To the sizes of influence belong medicaments which cannot be fancied away in the therapy of cardiovascular diseases; thus the beta-receptor blockers talinolol and propranolol. The examination of 118 cardiologically treated patients yields the result that there is no particular risk of the patients treated by means of these medicaments, since an essential decrease of the HDL-cholesterol-concentration could not be proved.", 
    "21": "Acute administration of the parasympathomimetic agent, bethanechol, at 2, 4, 8 and 12 mg/kg body wt, IP, induced drinking and increased urine output of rats in a dose-dependent fashion. The first significant increases in both water intake and urine output above that of controls occurred when 4 mg/kg was administered. The drinking and increased urine output in response to administration of 8 mg bethanechol/kg was inhibited by atropine sulfate (3 and 6 mg/kg, IP). In addition, the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol (6 mg/kg, IP, administered 30 min prior to treatment with bethanechol), inhibited bethanechol (8 mg/kg, IP)-induced drinking. Urine output, however, was unaffected by propranolol. Further, the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, inhibited significantly the drinking response, but not the increased urine output, accompanying administration of bethanechol (8 mg/kg). The effect of bethanechol and the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (25 micrograms/kg) separately and in combination, on water intake was also studied. Both compounds increased water intake but they exerted no interactive effect when administered simultaneously. Administration of bethanechol (8 mg/kg) to conscious rats was also accompanied by a significant reduction in both mean blood pressure and heart rate that reached minimal levels within 10 min after treatment. Both responses had returned to control level by one hr after treatment. These results suggest that bethanechol induces drinking in rats by way of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "22": "The bronchial effects of prenalterol, a selective inotropic beta-adrenoceptor agonist, were examined to see whether beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulation would produce bronchodilatation, or whether beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade could be demonstrated. In a first investigation 8 asthmatic patients were studied under standardized conditions in a double-blind, randomized, crossover comparison between i.v. doses of prenalterol and saline infusions. After the fourth dose of prenalterol/saline, 4 intravenous doses of terbutaline were given. All medication was given at 30 min intervals. In a second study in 7 of the previously studied patients, 5 increasing doses of prenalterol or saline were inhaled from a bird ventilator, and after the last dose 4 i.v. doses of terbutaline were given as before. Prenalterol and saline caused no change in FEV1 during the intravenous study. Terbutaline infusion produced a dose dependent increase in FEV1 which was not significantly altered after prenalterol treatment. In the inhalation study, in which a much larger dose was applied to the bronchial tree, there was no significant difference in FEV1, between the saline and prenalterol inhalations. However, prenalterol did show beta 2-blocking property, as the dose response curve of terbutaline was shifted to the right. The heart rate increased significantly and to the same degree during both the i.v. and inhaled prenalterol treatments. Thus, this study revealed no significant beta 2-blocking effect of therapeutic doses of i.v. prenalterol. However, when the drug was inhaled in a much higher dose, a beta 2-blocking effect on FEV1 was recorded. No significant beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated bronchodilator effect of prenalterol could be demonstrated.", 
    "23": "Prizidilol is a new antihypertensive agent reported to possess combined precapillary vasodilator and betareceptor-blocking properties. To clarify the profile of the acute effects of prizidilol in man, a variable dose study was performed in 8 patients with benign essential hypertension. Blood pressure, heart rate, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, plasma and urinary catecholamines and electrolytes were determined at short intervals before and up to 23 h after oral administration of placebo and prizidilol 150, 300 and 600 mg. The 4 studies were performed at weekly intervals according to a Latin square design. Prizidilol produced dose-dependent decreases in supine and upright blood pressure, with an initial change after about 2 h and maximal effects from 4 to 8 h after drug ingestion. Following a high dose of prizidilol, supine mean blood pressure (average 128 mmHg prior to treatment) was normalised (less than 107 mmHg) from 3 to 7 h and was still below predose level 23 h after ingestion. The only reported side effects were postural dizziness in 2 cases (corresponding to a fall in systolic upright blood pressure to less than 95 mmHg) and headache in one case. A biphasic variation in heart rate and plasma renin activity, with an early drop and a subsequent tendency to a slight rise, was observed after an intermediate or high dose of prizidilol. Plasma norepinephrine levels were increased by a high dose of prizidilol, while plasma epinephrine, aldosterone and plasma and urinary electrolytes were not consistently changed. Prizidilol in a a single oral dose appeared to be a potent antihypertensive agent. The profile of heart rate and plasma renin point to early dominance of beta-blockade followed by appearance of the concomitant vasodilator properties of prizidiol.", 
    "24": "The haemodynamic effects of prenalterol and dopamine were compared in 10 patients about 4 h after cardiac valve replacement during a phase of temporarily depressed myocardial function. The rate of infusion was adjusted to give similar increases in stroke volume with the two drugs (dopamine + 17% and prenalterol + 18%). Both drugs produced marked inotropic and chronotropic effects with significant increases in heart rate, cardiac output, arterial blood pressure, and left and right ventricular stroke work. The arterial blood pressure and the left ventricular stroke work increased significantly more with dopamine than with prenalterol, however. The systemic vascular resistance decreased significantly with prenalterol, whereas it was unchanged with dopamine. The effects of prenalterol could be traced after 90 min, whereas the effects of dopamine vanished within 15 min.", 
    "25": "An NMR spectroscopic method for the determination of isosorbide dinitrate, alone or together with alprenolol or propranolol, is described. Spectra are determined in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 containing maleic acid or 1,4-dinitrobenzene as internal standards. Both synthetic mixtures and commercial formulations were assayed, and the results were compared using compendial procedures.", 
    "26": "In seven male hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure (serum creatinine level 6.9 +/- 4.1 mg%) plasma catecholamine levels were in the same range as in five normotensive healthy volunteers. Treatment with the beta-receptor blocker metipranolol (2 x 20 mg/day orally for 2 weeks) significantly elevated plasma catecholamine levels in the hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure, but not in the healthy volunteers. Blood pressure and heart rate were reduced in both groups.", 
    "27": "A variety of drugs used in clinical practice may cause myopathy or interfere with neuromuscular transmission. The precise incidence of such disorders is not known, but it is almost certainly higher than is generally suspected. An important aspect of drug-induced muscular disorders is their reversibility if the offending agent is withdrawn, whereas failure to do so may lead to unnecessary morbidity. The study of drug effects on muscle provides a means of investigating the pathological reactions of muscle, and of producing experimental models of naturally occurring myopathies. Drug-induced myopathies may result from a direct toxic effect, which may be local when the drug is injected into a muscle or more diffuse when the drug is taken systemically, or may be secondary to electrolyte disturbances, muscle compression, ischaemia, neural activation or to the development of an immunological reaction directed against muscle. Repeated injections of antibiotics or drugs of addiction may lead to severe muscle fibrosis and contractures. A variety of drugs may cause an acute or subacute painful necrotising myopathy which may be associated with myoglobinuria, at times leading to acute renal failure. Clofibrate and epsilon aminocaproic acid are the drugs most frequently implicated, but a similar syndrome may occur in alcoholics and heroin addicts. Certain hypocholesterolaemic agents may induce myotonia by altering the sterol composition of the muscle cell membrane, while certain drugs including beta-adrenergic blockers and agonists, succinylcholine and diuretics may exacerbate or unmask pre-existing myotonia. In the syndrome of malignant hyperpyrexia, halothane, succinylcholine and various other agents may induce a potentially fatal state of muscular rigidity and hypermetabolism in susceptible individuals as a result of a defect in the calcium transport function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and possibly of other cellular membranes. In corticosteroid myopathy, which is the most common form of drug-induced myopathy, there is selective atrophy of type 2 muscle fibres and the primary metabolic effect is an inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis, although protein degradation is also increased. Chloroquine and a number of related drugs with amphiphilic cationic properties may induce lysosomal storage myopathy, which may be associated with cardiomyopathy and with a more widespread form of lipidosis.", 
    "28": "Isolated cardiac muscle cells from neonatal rat ventricular myocardium have both alpha- and beta-adrenergic, positive chronotropic responses, with sensitivity to applied adrenergic agents more than 100 times greater than the intact neonatal heart. These highly sensitive isolated single cells and small groups of cells also reveal partial agonist activity of the alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, and the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol. The most likely explanation for the high sensitivity is the lack of a desensitization process that could involve both a desensitization substance and changes in receptors. These experiments suggest that all adrenergic antagonists could possibly show partial agonist activity.", 
    "29": "The ability of a new exercise test accurately to detect the presence and severity of coronary heart disease has been examined in 206 patients with anginal pain, including patients on beta blockers or with concomitant cardiac lesions. From recordings of 13 electrocardiographic leads during exercise, the maximal rate of progression of ST segment depression relative to increased in heart rate (maximal ST/HR slope) was obtained and used as an index of myocardial ischaemia. The maximal ST/HR slope and results of coronary arteriography were independently obtained and the two sets of data compared the ranges of the maximal ST/HR slopes in the 38 patients with no significant disease, 49 with single vessel, 75 with double vessel, and 44 patients with triple vessel disease were different from each other and there was no overlap in the data between adjacent groups; there were no false positive, false negative, or indeterminate results. It is concluded that the maximal ST/HR slope can be used reliably to predict the presence of absence and severity of coronary heart disease in individual patients presenting with anginal pain in a hospital population.", 
    "30": "In a randomized, controlled study we found a significant decrease in pressure-rate (double) product and an improvement in exercise tolerance in patients with angina pectoris treated with pindolol. However, when patients were observed in a long-term double-blind crossover study, pindolol treatment did not produce a significant improvement in angina pectoris or exercise tolerance over placebo. Patients treated with placebo had a gradual improvement in exercise tolerance, possibly because of the training effect of multiple treadmill tests and increased daily walking. The individual patient response to pindolol varied, with some patients showing clinical improvement and decreased double product with exercise and some having no clinical improvement despite a similar decrease in double product. Angina occurred at a lower double product with exercise, suggesting that beta receptor blockade adversely affected other variables of myocardial oxygen demand or decreased coronary blood supply. This study illustrates the difficulties with patient variability and study design that are encountered in studies of beta blocker agents for angina pectoris.", 
    "31": "A number of isolated tissue and intact animal models were utilized to investigate in more detail the cardiovascular actions of N-phenylpiperazine (NPP), a known compound having adrenergic blocking properties. In isolated tissues its autonomic profile is characterized by alpha and beta adrenergic blocking activity. Compared to other beta receptor antagonists, NPP displays moderate in vitro beta-1 blockade in guinea-pig atria. Cumulative administration of NPP (0.1--0.3 mg/kg i.v.) in the intact dog also produces dose-dependent inhibition of myocardial contractility following isoproterenol administration. The oral antihypertensive potency of NPP in the deoxycorticosterone acetate hypertensive rat is compared with phenoxybenzamine and labetalol. Its profile is similar to labetalol but differs from phenoxybenzamine, causing a fall in blood pressure and a decrease in heart rate. Hemodynamic data obtained with NPP in the anesthetized animal reveal a complex cardiovascular profile involving the interactions of the sympathetic nervous system. Canine hind limb perfusion studies using cumulative doses (0.1--0.3 mg/kg i.v.) appear to preclude a direct vasodilator mechanism in the reserpinized-pretreated animal. In other studies, nonselective vasoconstrictor responses induced by exogenous administration of norepinephrine and lumbar sympathetic nerve stimulation are inhibited to the same degree by NPP (0.1--10 mg/kg i.v.) autonomic interactions with NPP in the nictitating membrane provide evidence for inhibition of neuronal catecholamine uptake and catecholamine release. From the data obtained in the present study, it is suggested that NPP has a predominant influence on the response of the sympathetic nervous system to provide a unique cardiovascular profile. The manner in which blood pressure is regulated by either direct or nonselective mechanisms will be discussed.", 
    "32": "The effects of adrenergic stimulation and suppression on somatostatin (SS), insulin, and glucagon release were studied in intact dogs. Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, significantly increased portal venous and arterial levels of SS and arterial levels of insulin and glucagon. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, significantly decreased portal venous SS and suppressed the isoproterenol-stimulated increases in the levels of SS, insulin, and glucagon. alpha-Adrenergic stimulation (propranolol plus epinephrine) decreased portal venous SS and arterial insulin. Phentolamine, and alpha-adrenergic antagonist, increased portal venous and arterial SS and arterial glucagon. These data suggest that in intact dogs, stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors enhances the release of SS, insulin, and glucagon, while stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors inhibits the release of SS and insulin without having a definitive effect on glucagon.", 
    "33": "The influence of timolol on aqueous humour production has been well documented, nevertheless it is unknown the real mechanism by which timolol produces this process. We have conceived the hypothesis that any alteration of natrium and kalium content following topical treatment of timolol was the main cause of the lowering rate of aqueous humour production. Therefore, we have examined the behaviour of Na+ and K+ amounts after topical administration of one eye of young rabbits with timolol. The experimentation has been conducted by photometer appliance. Our results show the absence of any imbalance between natrium and kalium content. The failure of our purpose indicates that Na+/K+ content does not play a main role in decreasing aqueous humour production by timolol.", 
    "34": "We have extended our previous observations on the effect of tranylcypromine (TCP) on intraocular pressure (IOP), following topical administration of catecholamines is normal and chemically denervated rabbit eyes. In normal eyes, TCP inhibits the hypotensive phase after topical norepinephrine (nE); less after epinephrine (E); and not at all after isoproterenol. In denervated eyes, the inhibitory effect of TCP on the hypotensive phase of nE and E is enhanced. Phenoxybenzamine (PBA), but not timolol maleate or indomethacin, blocks the effect of TCP on alpha-adrenergic induced hypotension. Prostacyclin-like activity was estimated by bioassay using ADP induced rat platelet aggregation. This activity is significantly reduced in the primary aqueous and in the iris after TCP but it is significantly increased in pooled data of aqueous samples after topical nE. We conclude that the inhibitory effect of TCP on the hypotensive phase after topical E and nE is the result of inhibition of prostacyclin synthesis and not of MAO inhibition nor blockade of alpha-receptors. It is possible that the normal production of prostacyclin by the iris and ciliary body maintains (lower) basal levels of IOP.", 
    "35": "Nadolol, a non-selective beta-blocker with a long duration of action, reportedly is devoid of membrane stabilizing action. Since such action is augmented by ischaemic conditions, it was of interest to investigate whether, in simulated ischaemia, a direct membrane effect of nadolol might be revealed. We have confirmed that in normoxia nadolol had no effects on intracellulary recorded potentials in isolated rabbit atrial or ventricular muscle at a concentration of 4.84 microM, but significantly reduced action potential amplitude and maximum rate of depolarisation at 14.5 microM. In Purkinje cells a small reduction of action potential amplitude was produced by 1.61 microM nadolol, but the effect was not increased by nadolol 4.84 microM. There were no drug-induced changes in action potential duration (APD), spontaneous frequency, conduction velocity, contractions, electrical threshold, effective refractory period or the maximum frequency at which a stimulus could be followed. Nadolol 14.5 microM did not reduce the positive inotropic effect of increasing extracellular calcium concentrations. Nadolol was 25 times less potent than procaine as a local anaesthetic on desheathed frog nerve. In a solution simulating ischaemia (8 mM KCl, 10 mM NaHCO3, gassed with 20% O2, pH 7.0) nadolol had a significant class 1 action on atrial muscle, however, even at 4.84 microM and reduced the shortening of APD caused by the solution. It is concluded that nadolol has no class 1, 3 or 4 antiarrhythmic activity in normoxia, but could have an additional protective effect in ischaemic myocardium against the arrhythmogenic factor of shortened APD.", 
    "36": "Previous work has identified an effect of circulating estrogens on the number of central adrenergic binding sites. We have further characterized this effect by performing the experiments in vitro and have taken advantage of a well-described hypothalamic preparation in which diethylstilbestrol (DES), is known to elevate cAMP levels through a pathway which involves adrenoreceptors. We show that DES induces a reciprocal change in the numbers of alpha- and beta-adrenergic binding sites in incubated hypothalami obtained from intact immature female rats as well as from ovariectomized adult rats. The alpha-adrenergic binding sites are reduced by 25-30% whereas the beta-adrenergic sites are increased by 60-100%. The effect is maximal at 3 h in vitro (20 microM DES) and largely reversible following a 2 h wash in the absence of DES. Using the change in beta-adrenergic binding sites as a probe, we were further able to show that estradiol (100 microM) and 2-hydroxyestradiol (50 microM) had no effect. Further, the effect of DES was not blocked by the anti-estrogens clomiphene or tamoxifen. Since DES is able to elevate beta-adrenergic binding sites in hypothalamus and amygdala (brain areas known to contain high levels of estrogen receptors) but has no effect in cerebellum, we conclude that we have observed an effect of DES not shared by estradiol but which may be confined to estrogen target areas of the brain.", 
    "37": "Basal glucose utilization by isolated rat adipocytes have been found to be increased ten times in the presence of certain preparations of albumin. In these conditions the effects of several adrenergic agonists and related compounds on glucose oxidation, lipolysis and triacylglycerol synthesis in isolated fat cells have been studied. Oxidation of D(1(-14)C) glucose in rat adipocytes was almost completely inhibited by norepinephrine and isoproterenol when added to incubated fat cells. Agents able to modify intracellular AMP cyclic levels by different mechanisms display a similar ability to imitate the effect of lipolytic agents. The inhibition of glucose oxidation due to norepinephrine and isoproterenol is partially reverted by propanolol. Under the same conditions in which norepinephrine and isoproterenol markedly reduced glucose conversion to 14CO2, they stimulated lipolysis and triacylglycerol synthesis and in this case propanolol also reverted those actions. However, in these experimental conditions, norepinephrine and isoproterenol did not raise cAMP levels 10 min after hormone addition. It is concluded from these data that glucose oxidation through hexose monophosphate shunt, activation of lipolysis and triacylglycerol synthesis in isolated rat fat cells by lipolytic agents occurs by a mechanism(s) that depend(s) on intracellular free fatty acids levels.", 
    "38": "1. The accumulation of [3H]methyltriphenylphosphonium by isolated fat-cells was used to estimate the membrane potential of mitochondria in situ. 2. Adrenaline caused a large decrease in the accumulation of [3H]methyltriphenylphosphonium. Mitochondria in fat-cells incubated in the presence of adrenaline had a very low calculated membrane potential. This effect was also given by isoprenaline (a beta-adrenergic agonist) and was blocked by propranolol (a beta-adrenergic antagonist). 3. The effect of isoprenaline could be partially antagonized by the use of media with high albumin concentrations. Addition of sodium oleate to saturate the fatty acid-binding sites on the albumin reversed this antagonism. 4. It is proposed that the decrease in the calculated mitochondrial membrane potential is due to the uncoupling effect of the non-esterified fatty acids released by the stimulation of lipolysis observed in the presence of beta-adrenergic agonists.", 
    "39": "The metabolism of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] in rat parotid acinar cells was investigated, particularly with regard to the effects of receptor-active agonists. Stimulation of cholinergic-muscarinic receptors with methacholine provoked a rapid disappearance of 40--50% of [32P]PtdIns(4,5)P2, but had no effect on PtdIns4P. Adrenaline, acting on alpha-adrenoceptors, and Substance P also stimulated net loss of PtdIns(4,5)P2. The beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline, and the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, failed to affect labelled PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns4P. By chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with excess EGTA, and by an experimental protocol that eliminates cellular Ca2+ release, it was demonstrated that the agonist-induced decrease in PtdIns(4,5)P2 is independent of both Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ release. These results may suggest that net PtdIns(4,5)P2 breakdown is an early event in the stimulus-response pathway of the parotid acinar cell and could be directly involved in the mechanism of agonist-induced Ca2+ release from the plasma membrane.", 
    "40": "1. The accumulation of [3H]methyltriphenylphosphonium by isolated fat-cells was used to estimate the membrane potential of mitochondria in situ. 2. An alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated decrease in the apparent accumulation of [3H]methyltriphenylphosphonium was observed. Methoxamine, clonidine and low concentrations of phenylephrine decreased the calculated mitochrondrial membrane potential without significantly raising cyclic AMP levels, adenylate cyclase activity or stimulating lipolysis. The agonist potency order was phenylephrine greater than methoxamine greater than clonidine. 3. The decrease in the calculated mitochondrial membrane potential caused by phenylephrine, clonidine and methoxamine was blocked by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist prazosin but not by yohimbine nor by the beta-antagonist propranolol. This suggests that the effect on the calculated mitochondrial membrane potential may be mediated by alpha 1-like receptors.", 
    "41": "The beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the splenic homogenates of control and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) treated rats were characterized. The specific binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) in the rat spleen were saturable and of high affinity and showed pharmacological specificity of splenic beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Following 6-OHDA treatment, the Bmax value for specific [3H](-)DHA binding to the rat spleen was significantly increased by 26 percent and 22 percent compared to control at 2 and 3 weeks without a change in the Kd. In contrast, there was a 38 percent decrease in the Bmax for [3H](-)QNB in the 6-Ohda treated rat spleen at 2 and 3 weeks respectively without a change in the Kd. The Bmax value at 5 weeks was significantly greater than that at 2 or 3 weeks. The splenic norepinephrine (NE) concentration was markedly reduced by the 6-OHDA treatment at 1 to 3 weeks, while there was a significant recovery in the splenic NE concentration at 5 weeks. Thus, our results strongly suggest that we are biochemically localizing muscarinic cholinergic receptors on the sympathetic nerves of the rat spleen and that the beta-adrenergic receptors of the spleen are localized postsynaptically.", 
    "42": "Negative control on the thyroid cyclic AMP system has been studied. The increase of cyclic AMP levels induced by TSH in dog thyroid slices and its consequent secretion were inhibited by norepinephrine. This effect was different from the previously described activation of cyclic AMP disposal by acetylcholine: it was not calcium-dependent, was observed in the presence of isobutyl methylxanthine and was not inhibited by atropine. The inhibitory action of norepinephrine was abolished by phentolamine but not by L-propranolol. Clonidine and epinephrine also markedly inhibited the elevation of cyclic AMP levels, but phenylephrine did not. The inhibitory effect of norepinephrine and clonidine was abolished by yohimbine but not by prazosin. These results suggest that the effect of adrenergic agents on dog thyroid follicular cells is mediated by alpha 2-receptors. Similar results were obtained on dog thyroid adenylate cyclase activity: norepinephrine diminished the activation of adenylate cyclase induced by TSH, in a sodium-dependent process. This inhibition was abolished by phentolamine and yohimbine, but not by L-propranolol and and prazosin. This shows that the negative alpha 2-adrenergic effect bears directly on adenylate cyclase.", 
    "43": "Recent experiments have demonstrated that direct and reflex sympathetic stimulation elicit coronary vasoconstriction when the inotropic and chronotropic effects are blocked with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. This vasoconstriction can be blocked with alpha-adrenergic blocking agents. Regional variations in the flow reduction produced by right (RSS) vs. left (LSS) stellate stimulation were delineated in this study. Open-chest pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs were given propranolol (1 mg/kg iv). Hearts were neurally decentralized and paced just above the spontaneous heart rate. Radiolabeled microspheres (15 +/- 2 micrometers) were injected into the left atrium before and during RSS (n = 11) or LSS (n = 11). RSS produced relatively little vasoconstriction confined to anterior left ventricle. In contrast, LSS produced significant vasoconstriction in all areas of the right and left ventricles. In the endocardial half of the left ventricle the flow decrease was uniformly distributed among the regions studied. In the epicardial half of the flow decrease was more pronounced in posterior than in anterior regions. No significant change occurred in the endo-epi ratios with RSS, but with LSS there was a significant change in three areas. The changes were related to regional variations in the degree of epicardial constriction. Thus RSS and LSS have differential effects (quantitatively) on regional coronary blood flow.", 
    "44": "In recent years we have noticed an increased number of severe ventricular tachyarrhythmias in children with structurally normal hearts. It is necessary to search for this condition specifically. Fainting fits caused by ventricular fibrillation or flutter with or without lengthening of the QT interval in the electrocardiogram are triggered by shock, fear or physical exertion. Distinguishing the condition from epilepsy can sometimes be difficult. Diagnosis in the case of a 14 year old boy with no history of genetic disorder could only be established with the aid of a 24-hour-ECG. Extended QT-times were observed here only in the higher heart frequency area. A 7 year old boy, initially given anti-convulsion therapy, showed QT-lengthening with ventricular extrasystoles only after repeated ECGs. His mother died suddenly following acoustic trauma. A 10 year old girl with no history of genetic disorder exhibited similar symptoms. On the basis of our observations we are of the opinion that a clear distinction into a genetically homogenous group with long QT-times, and one with a normal QT-interval, is not possible. Investigation of presumed epileptic cases by means of 24-hour-EEG-ECG in combination and ergometrics is recommended. Our patients were treated successfully with beta-blockers (propranolol).", 
    "45": "Airway resistance, FEV 1.0 and lung volumes were measured in 11 normal subjects before and after voluntary hyperventilation and after inhalation of salbutamol and hyperventilation. The measurements were repeated the following day two hours after taking 40 mg propranolol. Under propranolol there is only a minimal increase in inspiratory and expiratory resistance and no change in bronchoconstriction induced by hyperventilation, but the spasmolytic effect of salbutamol is reduced. Blockade of beta-receptors is without influence on airway irritability in subjects without bronchial asthma or chronic asthmatic bronchitis. Blockade of beta-receptors can however reduce the effect of beta-2-receptor stimulants.", 
    "46": "The effect of fatigue-induced stress and of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (phentolamine and propranolol) on plasma free fatty acids (FFA) level was studied in fed and 24 h fasted rabbits. The initial FFA level was significantly higher in the fasted animals than in the fed ones. In the fed control rabbits immediately after stress the FFA level did not change as compared with its initial level. In the fasted control animals directly after stress a marked decrease in the FFA level was observed as compared with its initial value. 15 and 30 min after fatigue-induced stress, both in the fed and fasted control rabbits, a decrease in the FFA level was recorded as compared to that immediately after stress. It was found that propranolol had no significant influence on the FFA level, both in the fed and fasted animals, and phentolamine produced a distinct increase in the FFA level in the fed rabbits only. Immediately after stress the FFA level in the fed propranolol-treated rabbits was unchanged, but in the fed phentolamine-treated animals it was markedly decreased. Directly after stress a decrease of the amount of FFA in the fasted adrenolytic-treated rabbits was recorded, 15 and 30 min after stress the FFA level decreased both in the fed and fasted adrenolytic-treated rabbits. However, this decrease was not as marked as in the fed and fasted control animals. The possible role of lactate and of catecholamines in the changes of plasma FFA concentration was discussed.", 
    "47": "The relationship between the blood flow pattern immediately following coronary artery occlusion and the resulting infarct 24 hours later was studied in dogs treated with isoproterenol (0.5 micrograms/kg/min for 2 hours) or with propranolol (2 mg/kg every 6 hours). The coronary artery of a closed chest dog was perfused via a special cannula with arterial blood. A 2-mm diameter plastic bead was introduced into the perfusate to embolize a coronary branch. One minute after occlusion, radiolabelled microspheres were injected into the perfusate. The dogs were then allowed to recover. 24 hours later the dogs were reanesthetized and their hearts removed. The hearts were sliced into 4 mm thick sections and the microsphere distribution was visualized by autoradiography of the tissue. Superimposition of developed autoradiographs and tracings of the infarct pattern of stained sections allowed direct comparison of the blood flow pattern immediately after occlusion to the eventual pattern of infarction. In all 8 control dogs, all 6 isoproterenol dogs and all 12 propranolol dogs the lateral borders of blood flow and infarction were superimposable indicating no lateral change in infarct size resulting from treatment. In the control group there was a subepicardial region of the ischemic zone which did not infarct (15.2 +/- 2.3% of the ischemic zone). Though isoproterenol did not significantly change the size of this zone, propranolol increased it to 35.9 +/- 6,5% (p less than 0.005) indicating vertical but not lateral salvage.", 
    "48": "Dopamine and isoprenaline have been examined for their effects on guinea-pig renal blood flow in vivo and on cAMP production in a mainly isolated glomeruli/blood vessel preparation in vitro. The renal vasodilatation caused by both of these drugs can be differentiated by the use of specific antagonists, sulpiride blocking the effects of dopamine, and propranolol the vasodilatation produced by isoprenaline. Similarly, both drugs stimulated cAMP production, isoprenaline being much more active than dopamine (1000X) in this respect. Again, the dopamine antagonist fluphenazine specifically inhibited the dopamine-induced cAMP increases whilst the beta blocker atenolol blocked the rise in cAMP due to isoprenaline but not that due to dopamine. Sulpiride although potently inhibiting dopamine-induced renal vasodilatation was without effect on dopamine-stimulated cAMP levels. This result is similar to that reported in the CNS where sulpiride blocks dopamine activity in a variety of tests but is without effect on the dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase. Two dopamine agonists, ADTN and SKF 38393 were tested, and in both preparations had potent dopaminergic activity although SKF 38393 exhibited characteristics of a partial agonist on the adenylate cyclase model.", 
    "49": "The neural origins of heart-rate responses to auditory and painful stimuli were studied in preweanling and neonatal rats. Bradycardia and tachycardia in response to auditory and painful stimuli were found to be mediated by the 10th cranial nerve. Bilateral vagotomy abolished both responses, as did the peripherally acting cholinergic antagonist methyl scopolamine. Neither peripheral sympathectomy with guanethidine nor beta adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol significantly altered the cardiac responses. Thus, both the tachycardia and bradycardia evoked by psychologically relevant stimuli appear to be under direct nervous system control exerted through cholinergic vagal efferents to the heart.", 
    "50": "The effect of cholinergic, alpha-adrenergic, and beta-adrenergic blockade on human pancreatic polypeptide (HPP) release has been tested in six normal subjects before and after a meal. The response to food was abolished by atropine and significantly enhanced by phentolamine and propranolol. The increase induced by phentolamine occurred during the primary phase 0-60 min after food, and that caused by propranolol was observed during the secondary phase 60-120 min postprandially. A radioimmunoassay for HPP, evaluated by accepted criteria of reliability, is described. Various fractions of the 125I-BPP tracer peak have been evaluated. Those of the central portion proved to be superior to the others because of the constant immunoreactivity and the constant incubation damage during the observation period. Serum and plasma samples were subject to different conditions of preservation before analysis of HPP. It is concluded that preservation with aprotinin heparin, collection in chilled tubes, or instant centrifugation and freezing does not improve the stability of HPP after sampling. The present study confirms a positive correlation between age and fasting HPP concentrations (R = 0.15, p = 0.05), but no difference in HPP levels between men and women has been demonstrated.", 
    "51": "The influence of intracardial injection of ethanol into the right atrium was studied in 10 unanaesthetized unrestrained cats. The initial effect of the injection was bradycardia with nonsignificant decreases in mean carotid artery pressure (APm) or increases in mean right atrial pressure (RAPm). The same was evident in HR and APm with animals pretreated with a beta-blocking agent. Bradycardia could not be introduced in atropinized cats or ones treated with atropine and beta-blocking agent. We conclude that bradycardia is elicited mainly by the influence of ethanol stimulating the vagal centres of the central nervous system (CNS), but the direct influence of ethanol to the heart cannot be excluded."
