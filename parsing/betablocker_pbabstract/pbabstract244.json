After liquid-liquid extraction of talinolol from physiological solution, electrokinetic injection was employed to improve the sensitivity. The use of a coated capillary was necessary to achieve stable and reproducible enantioseparations. A baseline separation of the talinolol enantiomers was achieved in less than 10 min using 100 mM phosphate solution as background electrolyte and pH 3.5, at the presence of 3.0 mM HDAS-beta-CD and at 20 degrees C. In addition, this analytical condition proved to be useful for the enantioseparation of a number of other beta-blocking agents such as alprenolol, atenolol, bisoprolol, celiprolol, metipranolol, oxprenolol, and sotalol. For determining talinolol, the method could be validated in terms of precision, accuracy and linearity, and was found to be suitable in determination of talinolol enantiomers in highly diluted samples obtained from in vitro experiments.", 
    "1": "Two amino acid-based alkenoxy micelle polymers were synthesized for this study. These include polysodium N-undecenoxy carbonyl-L-leucinate (poly-L-SUCL) and polysodium N-undecenoxy carbonyl-L-isoleucinate (poly-L-SUCIL). The polymerization time and concentration of the synthesized micelle polymers were optimized by (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) experiments. Detailed physicochemical properties ((1)H NMR, critical micelle concentration (CMC), optical rotation, partial specific volume, aggregation number, and polarity) were determined, and these molecular micelles were introduced as a pseudostationary phase in micellar electrokinetic chromatography to study the molecular recognition and to develop a method for simultaneous separation of eight chiral beta-blockers. It is found that poly-L-SUCL gives overall better chiral resolution and wider chiral window than poly-L-SUCIL. After optimizing the type of micelle polymer, injection size and temperature, simultaneous separation and enantioseparation of eight beta-blockers were achieved in less than 35 min. A comparison with the amide-type surfactants of the same polar head group and alkyl chain length showed that carbamate-type surfactants always work better than the corresponding amide-type surfactant.", 
    "2": "Recombinant chicken alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (alpha(1)-AGP) was prepared by the Escherichia coli expression system and completely deglycosylated alpha(1)-AGP (cd-alpha(1)-AGP) was obtained by treatments of native alpha(1)-AGP with a mixture of endoglycosidase and N-glycosidase. The average molecular masses of chicken alpha(1)-AGP, cd-alpha(1)-AGP and recombinant alpha(1)-AGP were estimated to be about 29 200, 21 700 and 20 700, respectively, by matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight-mass spectrometry. We compared the chiral recognition ability of chicken alpha(1)-AGP, cd-alpha(1)-AGP and recombinant alpha(1)-AGP using them as chiral selectors in capillary electrophoresis. The chicken alpha(1)-AGP showed higher resolution for eperisone, pindolol and tolperisone than cd-alpha(1)-AGP or recombinant alpha(1)-AGP. Recombinant alpha(1)-AGP still showed chiral recognition for three basic drugs tested. By addition of propranolol as a competitor in the separation solution in CE, no enantioseparations of three basic drugs were observed with chicken alpha(1)-AGP, cd-alpha(1)-AGP or recombinant alpha(1)-AGP. These results reveal that the protein domain of the chicken alpha(1)-AGP is responsible for the chiral recognition ability, and that the chiral recognition site(s) for basic drugs exists on the protein domain.",

The underlying pathology of transplant-associated GAVE (HSCT-GAVE) is poorly understood and an effective therapeutic strategy has not been established yet. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 230 consecutive allogeneic transplant recipients in our institution between January 1997 and June 2002. We identified five patients who developed HSCT-GAVE (2.2%). Four patients had bleeding from HSCT-GAVE and one patient had HSCT-GAVE discovered incidentally. The clinical features of these patients were similar in that they all received conditioning treatment with busulfan and had history of thrombotic microangiopathy. Furthermore, treatment with a beta-blocker apparently improved the outcome of HSCT-GAVE in three patients.",

Ischemic and viable myocardium was documented on Tl-201 SPECT in 190 patients (43%), of whom only 23% had angina and only 26% had positive exercise testing results. During a follow-up of 3.8 +/- 1.7 years, 36 patients died and survival curves were progressively divergent between patients with and those without ischemic and viable myocardium: at 5 years, the respective survival rates were 81% +/- 4% and 94% +/- 2% (P =.004). By multivariate analysis, the best independent predictors of death were large extent of necrosis (>25% of left ventricle on Tl-201 SPECT, P <.001) and ischemic and viable myocardium (P =.001).",

There is presently no consensus concerning a regimen of discontinuation before either rest or pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion imaging. Whether antianginal treatment affects diagnostic sensitivity and specificity is not well documented. Methods and results The effect of the three most commonly used antianginal drugs (nitroglycerin, 400 microg [NTG]; metoprolol, 50 mg [MET]; and amlodipine, 5 mg [AML]) on myocardial perfusion was tested in 49 patients (age, 63 +/- 8 years; 43 men) allocated prospectively to one of the treatments (NTG, n = 25; MET, n = 14; and AML, n = 10). All patients had documented coronary artery disease and were scheduled for elective percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were studied once on treatment and once off treatment with an interval of 1 to 3 weeks. For NTG, the measurements were performed on the same day with an interval of 1 hour. The MET and AML groups were also studied during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia (0.56 mg. kg(-1). min(-1) for 4 minutes). So that a quantitative value of myocardial perfusion in milliliters per gram per minute could be obtained, myocardial perfusion was quantified with nitrogen 13 ammonia positron emission tomography as an average of the midventricular perfusion in each of the 3 vascular territories. NTG treatment increased the overall resting perfusion (0.75 +/- 0.18 vs 0.86 +/- 0.22, P <.05), whereas resting perfusion was reduced after MET treatment (0.92 +/- 0.14 vs 0.82 +/- 0.17, P <.05). AML treatment did not alter resting perfusion (0.87 +/- 0.22 vs 0.87 +/- 0.23, P = NS). Dipyridamole-induced hyperemia was reduced after treatment with MET (2.02 +/- 0.66 vs l.57 +/- 0.52, P <.001), whereas the hyperemic response was unchanged after treatment with AML (1.54 +/- 0.49 vs 1.86 +/- 0.91, P = NS).", 
    "8": "Antianginal medication can alter both resting and hyperemic myocardial perfusion and might affect the ability to detect flow-limiting stenosis. NTG increases perfusion, MET reduces perfusion, and AML does not affect perfusion. Larger-scale trials are warranted to establish a consensus for optimal antianginal medication for patients undergoing perfusion imaging.", 
    "9": "Previously, we demonstrated that epinephrine induced the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 mRNA via beta-adrenoceptors in cultured human osteoblastic cells. IL-6 is well known to modulate bone metabolism by regulating the development and function of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Recently, restraint stress and intracerebroventricular injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) have been reported to induce the expression of IL-6 mRNA in peripheral organs in mice in which expression is mediated by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. To prove the physiological role of sympathetic nerves in bone metabolism in vivo, we examined by RT-PCR analysis the effects of restraint stress and intracerebroventricular injection of LPS on IL-6 mRNA expression in mouse calvaria. The expression of IL-6 mRNA in mouse calvaria was stimulated by either restraint stress (30 min) or intracerebroventricular injection of LPS (50 ng/mouse, 60 min). The treatment of mice with the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 100 mg x kg-1 x day-1 ip for 3 days) inhibited LPS (icv)-induced expression of IL-6 mRNA in their calvaria. The expression of IL-6 mRNA induced by the restraint stress was not influenced by 6-OHDA, which destroys noradrenergic nerve terminals. Furthermore, pretreatment with a beta-blocker, propranolol (15 or 25 mg/kg ip), inhibited both stress- and LPS-induced increases in the level of IL-6 mRNA, but pretreatment with an alpha-blocker, phentolamine (5 mg/kg sc), did not inhibit them in mouse calvaria. In addition, treatment of calvaria with isoprenaline or norepinephrine increased IL-6 synthesis in the organ culture system. These results indicate that in vivo adrenergic stimulation modulates the osteoblastic activity in mouse calvaria via noradrenergic nerve terminals.",

A 60-year-old man with pseudoexfoliative glaucoma had an uneventful viscocanalostomy in the right eye. On the first postoperative day, a 5.0 mm x 5.0 mm Descemet's membrane detachment was present in the superior nasal quadrant. The space between Descemet's membrane and the stroma was filled with a hemorrhage. The hemorrhage resorbed by 6 months postoperatively, and Descemet's membrane completely reattached without surgical manipulation. The final visual acuity dropped from 20/40 to 20/100, final intraocular pressure was 20 mm Hg with 1 medication, and a paracentral fibrinoid scar persisted 18 months after surgery. Hemorrhagic detachment of Descemet's membrane can cause visual acuity deterioration and should be recognized as a rare complication of viscocanalostomy.", 
    "11": "A simple and rapid fully automated bio-analytical method for the liquid chromatographic (LC) determination of sotalol in human plasma has been described. The method is based on the use of a new kind of porous silica restricted access material (RAM) with cation exchange properties for sample clean-up. 100 microl of plasma samples were directly injected into the precolumn coupled on-line to a reversed-phase column (RP-Select B) by means of column switching system. The plasma matrix was washed out for 10 min using a washing liquid composed of 2 mM lithium perchlorate and methanol (97:3; v/v). By rotation of the switching valve, the analytes were then eluted in back-flush mode for 2 min and transferred to the analytical column by the LC mobile phase constituted of a mixture of methanol and 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM 1-octanesulphonic acid sodium salt (20:80; v/v). The flow-rate was 1.0 ml/min and sotalol was detected using fluorescence detection at 235 and 300 nm as excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. The method was then validated using a new approach based on accuracy profile over a concentration range from 5 to 500 ng/ml. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 5 ng/ml and the total analysis time was 19 min.",

Propranolol data were also acquired using an acetate buffer (0.2 M) instead of water. The data were modeled for best agreement between calculated and experimental overloaded band profiles. The adsorption energy distribution was also derived and used for the selection of the best isotherm model. Widely different isotherm models were found to model best the data obtained for these compounds, convex upward (i.e. Langmuirian), convex downward (i.e. anti-Langmuirian), and S-shaped isotherms. Using the same sample size for all columns (loading factor, Lf approximately 10%), overloaded band profiles were recorded on four different columns packed with the same batch of Kromasil-C18 and five other columns packed with different batches of Kromasil-C18. These experimental band profiles were compared to the profile calculated from the isotherm measured by FA on the first column.

The integration with microfluidics permits a controlled elution of analytes from the membrane and their direct mass spectrometric analysis by electrospray ionisation MS. The desalting process is demonstrated with picomole amounts of propanolol, insulin and cytochrome c. Moreover, this stop-and-go desalting process is tolerant to high concentrations of urea, and to the presence of reductants such as dithiothreitol. This particular feature allowed the chemical tagging of cysteines in beta-lactoglobulin A with iodoacetamide. Finally, the integration of chemical tagging, on-chip desalting and MS microchip paves the way for the development of high-throughput analytical procedure for structural proteomics.",

The exact mechanism(s) triggering and involved in cervical ripening are unknown, though evidence for a role for sensory neurons and their contained neuropeptides is emerging. Moreover, an apparent increase in neuropeptide immunoreactive nerves occurs in the cervix during pregnancy, maternal serum estrogen levels rise at term and uterine cervix-related L6-S1 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons express estrogen receptor (ER) and neuropeptides. Thus, we sought to test the hypothesis that the neuropeptide substance P (SP) changes biosynthesis and release over pregnancy, that estrogen, acting via the ER pathway, increases synthesis of SP in DRG, and that SP is utilized in cervical ripening at late pregnancy. Using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and radioimmunoassay (RIA), we investigated coexpression of ER-alpha/beta and SP; differential expression of ER-alpha and -beta mRNA in DRG neurons; SP synthesis in DRG; and changes in SP concentration in the cervix, DRG and spinal cord over pregnancy. In addition, the effect of exogenous estrogen on SP synthesis in L6-S1 DRG of ovariectomized rats was examined. SP-immunoreactive neurons expressed ER-alpha and ER-beta. SP synthesis (expressed as beta-PPT mRNA label) was prominent in small DRG neurons. SP concentration increased in the L6-S1 DRG and spinal cord segments, with a peak at Day 20 of gestation, but decreased in the cervix during the first two trimesters, with a rise over the last trimester to Day 10 levels. SP and ER-alpha mRNA synthesis increased in DRG over pregnancy but ER-beta mRNA levels were largely unchanged. When ovariectomized rats were treated with exogenous estrogen, SP mRNA synthesis in the DRG increased in a dose-related manner, an effect blocked by ER blocker ICI 182 780. From these results, we postulate that synthesis of SP in L6-S1 DRG and utilization in the cervix increase over pregnancy and this synthesis is under influence of the estrogen-ER system, most likely ER-alpha. We postulate that SP may play a role in cervical ripening and, consequently in the birth process.",

These results may have been influenced by lead-time bias, in that AA may not have been entered into the older ACEI trials until late in their CHF course. Our goal was to use a prospective cohort study of 29,686 CHF patients within a single health system to examine the impact on AA mortality of administering ACEI and BB within the first year of CHF diagnosis. Pharmacy claims from 1995-1998 were available for 3353 newly diagnosed CHF patients (39.2% AA; N=1317) within the health maintenance organization. Rates of ACEI and BB use were 46.4% and 54.0%; 43.4% and 28.9%; and 40.7% and 18.6%, for Whites, AA, and other races, respectively. The relative risk reductions (RRR) for ACEI were 68.7%, P<.0001; 52.1%, P<.0001; and -36.3%, P=.56, for Whites, AA, and other races, respectively.

Age- and gender-adjusted survival rates for AA were significantly enhanced in those taking ACEI, BB, or a combination of the two: P<.001, P=.001, and P=.003, respectively. Although we could not control for selection bias, these data suggest that AA benefit from both ACEI and BB when treatment is initiated within the first year of CHF diagnosis.

A secondary aim was to determine the effect of this treatment on plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and to investigate the relationships between this adipocytokine and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance determined using the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA), echocardiographic measurements and analysis of plasma TNF-alpha concentration were carried out in 47 patients with DCM without diabetes mellitus before and after 6 months of beta-blocker therapy. A reduction in left ventricular dimensions and an associated increase in ejection fraction occurred with beta-blocker. The treatment resulted in a significant decrease in insulin resistance (HOMA index: Baseline, 2.73+/-3.36 vs, Month 6, 1.58+/-1.33, p=0.0347). Beta-blockade was also associated with a decrease in plasma TNF-alpha concentration although no significant relationship between this change and the improvement in insulin resistance was observed. Beta-blocker therapy in patients with DCM improved not only cardiac function, but also insulin resistance. The mechanism of the change in insulin function remains unclear, but may be related to improvements in left ventricular function or an attenuation of the inhibitory effect of reduction in TNF-alpha on insulin signaling.",

Synthetic DOPA-melanin was used in the studies and a UV spectrophotometric method was employed to determine the drugs. The studies of the kinetics of the formation of quinidine-melanin, disopyramide-melanin and metoprolol-melanin complexes indicate that for all the complexes investigated the maximum time to reach reaction equilibrium is 24 h. Binding parameters, i.e., the numbers of independent binding sites and the association constants were determined on the basis of the Scatchard plots. An analysis of the binding curves obtained supports our conclusion that both strong (n1) and weak (n2) binding sites are involved in the formation of the complexes investigated. The total numbers of binding sites in synthetic DOPA-melanin complexes with quinidine, disopyramide and metoprolol were 0.525, 0.493 and 0.387 micromol/mg, respectively. The quinidine-melanin complex is characterized by greater stability (K1 = 3.00 x 10(5) M(-1), K2 = 1.75 x 10(3) M(-1)) in comparison with biopolymer complexes with disopyramide (K1 = 1.12 x 10(4) M(-1), K2 = 6.04 x 10(2) M(-1)) and metoprolol (K1 = 1.42 x 10(4) M(-1), K2 = 7.89 x 10(2) M(-1)).

In vitro experiments were performed on corneas from albino rabbits which were mounted in a perfusion apparatus. The concentrations of the enhancers being tested were: Brij 78 1%, PS 1%, TA 1%, NMP 5%, NMP 10%. The safety of the enhancers being tested was assessed in vitro by determining their effects on corneal hydration and in vivo by means of a modified Draize test. Calculating the amount of drug permeated at different time points (90 and 180 min) we observed that TA, PS and NMP 5% significantly increased the cumulative amount of AC permeated after 90 min but only PS was effective after 180 min. TA, Brij 78 and PS were able to increase significantly the amount of TM permeated after 90 min but after 180 min only Brij 78 retained its effect. TA, Brij 78 and NMP 10% significantly increased the percent hydration levels (% HL) compared to the control while PS and NMP 5% did not affect % HL. The results of in vivo ocular tolerability studies showed that the enhancers which caused an in vitro increase of % HL produced in vivo conjunctival and/or corneal damages. The results of this study suggest that PS could be regarded as a potential corneal enhancer to increase the intraocular bioavailability of AC and TM.",

    "78": "The effect of thymoquinone (TQ), the main constituent of the volatile oil of black seed (Nigella sativa), on the guinea-pig isolated tracheal zig-zag preparation was investigated. TQ caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the tension of the tracheal smooth muscle precontracted by carbachol. The effects of TQ were significantly potentiated by pretreatment of the tracheal preparations with quinacrine, a phospholipase A2 inhibitor, nordihydroguiaretic acid, a lipoxygenase inhibitor and by pretreatment with methylene blue, an inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase. On the other hand, the effects of TQ were not influenced by pretreatment of the tracheal preparations with indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker or by the pretreatment with theophylline, an adenosine receptors antagonist TQ totally abolished the pressor effects of histamine and serotonin on the guinea-pig isolated tracheal and ileum smooth muscles. The results of the present study suggest that TQ induced relaxation of precontracted tracheal preparation is probably mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid metabolism and possibly by non-selective blocking of the histamine and serotonin receptors. This relaxant effect of TQ, further support the traditional use of black seeds either alone or in combination with honey to treat bronchial asthma.",

A significant difference was seen in stroke volume between these 2 drugs. The blood pressure lowering effect of atenolol was strongly related to cardiac output and heart rate reduction. The blood pressure lowering effect of nebivolol was related to a reduction in peripheral resistance and an increase in stroke volume with preservation of cardiac output. This preservation of cardiac output, together with a reduced peripheral resistance, may be potentially important in treating heart failure.",

Agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a nuclear hormone receptor that mediates anti-inflammatory actions of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and thiazolidinediones, have been therefore proposed as a potential treatment of AD. Experimental evidence suggests that cortical noradrenaline (NA) depletion due to degeneration of the locus ceruleus (LC) - a pathological hallmark of AD - plays a permissive role in the development of inflammation in AD. To study a possible relationship between NA depletion and PPARgamma-mediated suppression of inflammation we investigated the influence of NA on PPARgamma expression in murine primary cortical astrocytes and neurons. Incubation of astrocytes and neurons with 100 micro m NA resulted in an increase of PPARgamma mRNA as well as PPARgamma protein levels in both cell types. These effects were blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol but not by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine, suggesting that they might be mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors. Our results indicate for the first time that PPARgamma expression can be modulated by the cAMP signalling pathway, and suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of NA on brain cells may be partly mediated by increasing PPARgamma levels. Conversely, decreased NA due to LC cell death in AD may reduce endogenous PPARgamma expression and therefore potentiate neuroinflammatory processes.",

One of the most effective anticancer drugs is doxorubicin, but its value is limited by the risk of developing cardiomyopathy and ventricular arrhythmia. When applied to a network of periodically contracting cardiomyocytes in culture, doxorubicin induces rhythm disturbances. Using a novel rapid assay based on non-invasive ion-conductance microscopy we show that the beta-antagonist esmolol can restore rhythm in doxorubicin-treated cultures of cardiomyocytes.

    "99": "The antifungal activity of synthetic, nonchemotherapeutic compounds, antineoplastic agents and antibacterial drugs, such as sulphonamides, has been known since the early 20th century (1932). In this context, the term \"nonantifungal\" is taken to include a variety of compounds that are employed in the management of pathological conditions of nonfungal infectious etiology but have been shown to exhibit broad-spectrum antifungal activity. In this review, the antifungal properties of compounds such as chlorpromazine, proton pump inhibitors, antiarrhythmic agents, cholesterol-lowering agents, antineoplastic and immunosuppressive agents, antiparasitic drugs and antibiotics are described. Since fungi are eukaryotic cells, they share many pathways with human cells, thus increasing the probability of antifungal activity of \"nonfungal drugs\". The potential of these drugs for treatment of fungal infections has been investigated sporadically using the drugs alone or in combination with \"classic\" antifungal agents. A review of the literature, supplemented with a number of more recent investigations, suggests that some of these compounds enhance the activity of conventional antifungal agents, eliminate natural resistance to specific antifungal drugs (reversal of resistance) or exhibit strong activity against certain fungal strains in vitro and in animal models. The role of these agents in the epidemiology and in the clinical manifestations of fungal infections and the potential of certain drugs for treatment of invasive fungal infections require further investigation.", 
    "100": "Nebivolol is a highly selective beta(1) adrenoceptor blocker with additional vasodilating properties. Although it has been shown that the nebivolol-induced vasorelaxation is nitric oxide (NO) and cGMP dependent, the receptor that mediates these actions remains controversial, and serotonergic as well as beta-adrenergic pathways may be involved. Therefore, functional experiments investigating the receptor involved in nebivolol-induced vasorelaxation were performed in the rat aorta. Isolated aortic rings were exposed to cumulative concentrations of nebivolol. Nebivolol concentrations of 3 micromol/L and higher caused vasorelaxation, which was inhibited by the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor l-NNA (100 micromol/L), or by mechanical removal of the endothelium. Exposure of the vessel rings to the selective 5-HT(1A) antagonist NAN-190 (1 micromol/L) or the 5-HT(1/2) antagonist methysergide (1 micromol/L) did not influence nebivolol-induced vasorelaxation. Similarly, the incubation with the beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist butoxamine (50 micromol/L) did not prevent vasorelaxation. The selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist S-(-)-cyanopindolol (1 micromol/L), however, significantly counteracted the nebivolol-induced vasorelaxation. Furthermore, exposure of the aortic rings to cumulative concentrations of the beta(3) selective adrenoceptor agonist BRL37344 caused, like nebivolol, NO-dependent vasorelaxation that was antagonized by S-(-)-cyanopindolol. The results suggest that nebivolol-induced NO-dependent vasorelaxation is, at least in part, caused by a beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonistic effect.", 
    "101": "There is a high frequency of heart failure (HF) accompanied by an increased mortality risk for patients with diabetes. The poor prognosis of these patients has been explained by an underlying diabetic cardiomyopathy exacerbated by hypertension and ischemic heart disease. In these patients, activation of the sympathetic nervous system results in increased myocardial utilization of fatty acids and induction of fetal gene programs, decreasing myocardial function. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system results in myocardial remodeling. It is imperative for physicians to intercede early to stop the progression of HF, yet at least half of patients with left ventricular dysfunction remain undiagnosed and untreated until advanced disease causes disability. This delay is largely because of the asymptomatic nature of early HF, which necessitates more aggressive assessment of HF risk factors and early clinical signs. Utilization of beta-blockade, ACE inhibitors, or possibly angiotensin receptor blockers is essential in preventing remodeling with its associated decline in ventricular function. beta-Blockers not only prevent, but may also reverse, cardiac remodeling. Glycemic control may also play an important role in the therapy of diabetic HF. The adverse metabolic side effects that have been associated with beta-adrenergic inhibitors in the diabetic patient may be circumvented by use of a third-generation beta-blocker. Prophylactic utilization of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers to avoid, rather than await, the need to treat HF should be considered in high-risk diabetic patients.",

The women in the study were all 60 years old or older, were able to walk, had no cognitive impairment, and were living in the community (rather than living in a facility exclusively for older persons). A questionnaire was used that asked about falls within the 12 months prior to the interview, medications used in the previous 15 days, current and past health problems, and demographic characteristics. Women who were interviewed face-to-face also had their blood pressure checked. Two outcome variables were defined: (1) \"fallers,\" who had suffered one or more falls (contrasted with \"nonfallers\") and (2) \"recurrent fallers,\" who had had two or more falls (contrasted with those who had had one or no falls, called \"nonrecurrent fallers\").",

    "123": "Diabetic nephropathy is the most serious problem among current issues in nephrology, as 40% of the cases of end-stage renal disease are due to this entity. The close relationship between type 2 diabetes and hypertension makes the problem even more severe. The knowledge of the intrarenal effects of angiotensin II and the greater effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) on reducing albuminuria suggested in the past a trend toward preferable use of these drugs in diabetic nephropathy. The first relevant clinical trials yielded rather poor conclusions because of lack of blind randomization and short duration. Subsequent double-blind studies with adequate numbers of patients and sufficient duration underlined the importance of blood pressure (BP) control as well as the rather poor response of diabetic nephropathy to any treatment. In most of these studies, the changes in albuminuria or microalbuminuria were a substitute end point for the renal function. Three clinical trials using angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), planned specifically to monitor the progression of renal damage, have been recently published. They showed better renal protection by ARB, as compared with placebo or calcium channel blockers (CCB), beyond or independently of the BP reduction. Nevertheless, these recent trials, like the previous ones with similar results, invariably demonstrate slightly better control of BP in the groups of the active drug. Another issue is that the vast majority of the patients need so many nonstudy drugs to keep their pressure under control, that the isolation of advantageous effects of certain drugs seems unrealistic.", 
    "124": "Neurons, but not astrocytes, are known as the major source of Abeta, because astrocytes express low levels of putative beta-secretase (BACE). Astrocytes near senile plaque cores show enhanced levels of BACE protein expression, however, suggesting that astrocytes can contribute to Abeta production under pathological conditions. To investigate factors that stimulate BACE protein expression in astrocytes, we tested the effects of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on BACE protein expression in U373MG astrocytoma cells and primary astrocyte cultures from Tg2576 mouse brains. BACE protein expression and sAPPbeta production were dramatically increased, without changes in holo APP levels, following IFN-gamma treatment in both cell types. AG490, which is a blocker of IFN-gamma-induced STAT signaling, decreased IFN-gamma-induced BACE protein expression and sAPPbeta production in a dose-dependent manner. These results show that astrocytes are capable of expressing BACE and producing sAPPbeta in response to certain stimulating factors, and IFN-gamma is one such factor.", 
    "125": "In general, the failing human heart is characterized by a selective reduction in beta(1)-adrenoceptors (beta(1)-ARs) without change in beta(2)-AR density. Medical imaging techniques, either single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) with appropriate radioligands, offer the possibility of assessing beta-adrenoceptor density non-invasively in humans. To date, neither a SPECT nor a PET radioligand is available for the selective imaging of cardiac beta(1)-ARs. The aim of this study was to develop potential high affinity beta(1)-selective AR radioligands for the non-invasive in vivo imaging of the beta(1)-AR density in the human heart using SPECT or PET. A variety of racemic N-aryl-N'-[2-[3-aryloxy-2-hydroxy-propylamino]-ethyl]-urea derivatives and chain-elongated analogues, related to the established beta(1)-AR antagonist, ICI 89,406 8i, were synthesized. Competition studies using the non-selective AR ligand, [(125)I]iodocyanopindolol ([(125)I]ICYP), and ventricular membrane preparations of wild-type mice revealed nine ligands with higher beta(1)-AR affinities (up to 76-fold) and beta(1)-AR selectivities (up to 139-fold) than 8i. Mostly, these ligands possess a 2-substituted phenoxy group and a 4-substituted phenyl residue in contrast to the lead compound 8i. The non-radioactive counterparts of the desired SPECT- and PET-radiotracers were synthesized as reference compounds [e.g., 8f, 8g, 8h and 8l as the non-radioactive analogues of the radioiodinated SPECT radioligands, 8e and 8h as the non-radioactive compounds of C-11 labelled PET-tracers (C-11 in the methoxy group)]. The established library of high affinity beta(1)-selective AR antagonists was screened for chemical precursors for the radiosynthesis of the mentioned radioligands. Furthermore, the library consists of some comparison compounds that are unsubstituted, allyl- and alkyl-substituted or chain-elongated (e.g., 8a, 8j, 8o and 8r-t). Future steps will include radiolabelling and pharmacokinetic evaluation of the beta(1)-selective target compounds, which could be applied as sympathetic innervation agents for in vivo investigations and diagnostics in patients suffering from cardiac diseases like heart failure and ventricular arrhythmias.",

However, the expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) for beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors, but not for beta3-adrenoceptors, was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These results clearly suggest that not all beta-adrenoceptor mRNA expressed strictly reflect functional receptors in guinea-pig esophageal muscularis mucosae.",

Class II(a) recommendations for treating HF with abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction are spironolactone in patients with class IV symptoms, preserved renal function, and normal serum potassium; exercise training as an adjunctive approach to improve clinical status in ambulatory patients; an angiotensin receptor blocker in patients who cannot be given an ACE inhibitor because of cough, rash, altered taste sensation, or angioedema; and hydralazine plus nitrates in patients being treated with diuretics, a beta-blocker, and digoxin who cannot be given an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker because of hypotension or renal insufficiency. Patients with diastolic HF should be treated with cautious use of diuretics and with a beta-blocker. An ACE inhibitor should be added if HF persists or an angiotensin receptor blocker if the patient cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor because of cough, angioedema, rash, or altered taste sensation. Isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine should be added if HF persists. A calcium channel blocker should be added if HF persists. Digoxin should be avoided in diastolic HF if sinus rhythm is present.",

It has also been established that beta-blockers and dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blockers (DHPCCB) influence the autonomic nervous system. This study tested the hypothesis that QTc interval length is a predictor of the blood pressure reduction induced by beta1-selective beta-blockers or DHPCCB. The predictive values of pretreatment heart rate and of the heart rate change with therapy were also evaluated. The authors conducted an historical reanalysis of 5 clinical trials that looked at the antihypertensive effects of beta-blockers (nebivolol) or DHPCCB (amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine, nifedipine). Correlation and quintile analyses were performed to measure the association between QTc interval, heart rate, or heart rate change and therapeutic blood pressure response. Separate analyses were undertaken for beta-blockers and DHPCCB. Seventy-three and 98 hypertensive subjects respectively were included in the beta-blocker and DHPCCB analyses. QTc interval, pretreatment heart rate, and heart rate change with therapy were not associated with therapeutic blood pressure response. In this study, QTc interval length, pretreatment heart rate, and heart rate change with therapy were not good predictors of the blood pressure response to beta1-selective beta-blockers or DHPCCB in hypertensive subjects.",

Thus, the pharmacokinetics of acebutolol was investigated after oral administration of acebutolol (15 mg/kg) to control rabbits and rabbits with acute or chronic diabetes mellitus induced by alloxan. Kidney and liver functions were documented for acute and chronic diabetes mellitus groups based on plasma chemistry data. After oral administration of acebutolol to acute and chronic groups, the plasma concentrations appeared higher; As a result, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time infinity10575 and 8668 microg x h/mL for acute and chronic group, respectively. In comparison, the area was apparently smaller in the control group (i.e., 7132 microg x h/mL). The half-life in acute groups was significantly prolonged 8.45 h compared with the half-life in the control group (i.e., 6.30 h). Alteration in acebutolol pharmacokinetics was more pronounced in the acute group as evidenced by the significantly higher values the area under the plasma concentration time curve, absorption rate constant and maximum plasma concentration compared with chronic or control group. Therefore, these observations indicate that acebutolol pharmacokinetics may be affected in patients with diabetes mellitus, especially in the early stage of the disease.",

Based on insulin resistance and/or resultant hyperinsulinemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, lipid disorders and atherosclerotic vascular diseases are often seen in the same individuals. Lifestyle modification to reduce insulin resistance is very important to manage diabetic patients with hypertension. When the doctors use anti-hypertensive medication, we have to take care not to worsen glucose or lipid profiles. Taking recent guidelines from US, Japan and Europe into considerations, blood pressure of diabetic patients should be controlled below 130-135/80 mmHg. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists are commonly recommended as first-line medicine to choose. However, Ca-channel blockers, alpha 1-blockers, beta-blockers and diuretics are often needed to achieve the goal: preventing organ damage which would be the most important issue for diabetic patients.",

Hypertension appears to be a significant risk factor in the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy and should be rigorously controlled. The risk reductions were similar regardless of whether the hypertension was controlled with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or beta-blocker.", 
    "132": "Potentiometric approach enabling sensitive and reliable detection for a series of 20 autonomic beta-adrenergic ligands with the use of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) based liquid membrane electrode coatings in the normal-bore cation exchange HPLC and narrow-bore reversed phase HPLC system is presented. It was found that in both kinds of HPLC modes with a contemporary hybrid polymer-silica packings an application of electrodes containing a tetrakis(p-chlorophenyl)borate (TCPB) gives limits of detection below to 8.0x10(-7) mol l(-1) (injected concentrations). In case of highly hydrophobic beta-adrenergic drugs the use of binary aqueous mobile phases with high concentrations of acetonitrile (up to 25% v/v) shifting an observable detection limits (DL) down to 2.0x10(-8) mol l(-1), especially for electrodes with addition of trioctylated alpha-cyclodextrin. The characteristics of developed potentiometric detectors was established by proposed a quantitative structure-potentiometric response relationships (QSPRRs) for a series of diversified beta-adrenergic compounds and for a set of the PVC based electrodes using TCPB alone as well as in combination with trioctylated alpha-cyclodextrin, dibenzo-18-crown-6, or calix[6]arene hexaethylester as the neutral macrocycle ionophore.

Pharmacological evaluation of 5 and 6 were carried out using mouse ECG and isolated rat uterus models. Pretreatment of 5 (100 microg/kg, i.v.) and 6 (50 microg/kg, i.v.) antagonized isoprenaline (2 microg/kg, i.v.) induced tachycardia, similar to that of atenolol (CAS 29122-68-7, 20 microg/kg, i.v.) pretreatment in mouse ECG experiments as measured by R-R interval. Pretreatment of 5 and 6 blocked isoprenaline and adrenaline induced relaxation of isolated rat uterus (unprimed). Also the compounds 5 and 6 were subjected to in vitro beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptor binding assay using turkey erythrocyte membrane (beta1) and lung homogenate of rats (beta2). Both 5 and 6 showed beta-adrenergic receptor affinity comparable with that of propranolol (propranolol hydrochloride, CAS 318-98-9) with out selectivity to any one beta-adrenergic receptor.

    "153": "Circadian melatonin secretion is the best-known output signal from the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus that indicates internal conditions of the body. We have established a system that enables long-term monitoring of melatonin secretion by implanting a transverse microdialysis probe in or near the pineal gland in a freely moving mouse. This in vivo method enabled continuous measurement of melatonin secretion over a period of >20 days in individual CBA mice, with simultaneous recording of the locomotor activity. Pineal melatonin secretion was completely matched to the circadian change of locomotor activity, and for the light-induced phase shift, the shift of melatonin secretion was clearer than the shift of locomotor rhythm. This analysis allowed us to detect rhythm with a high sensitivity: two peaks of daily secretion were observed, with the first small peak at the day-night transition time and the second large peak at midnight. The large nighttime peak was suppressed by tetrodotoxin, a Na+ channel blocker, and enhanced by both phenylephrine and isoproterenol, alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists, whereas daytime melatonin levels were not affected by tetrodotoxin infusion. This finding suggests that, in CBA mice, melatonin release at night is activated by adrenergic signaling from the superior cervical ganglion, but the enhancement of melatonin during daytime is not mediated by neuronal signaling.", 
    "154": "In this in vitro study, the hypothesis that the beneficial effects of dietary genistein on bone are through the modulation of the bone marker synthesis by osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells was tested, and the possible roles of estrogen receptors in the actions of genistein on osteoblastic cells were also examined. Interleukin-6 production was decreased 40% to 60% in osteoblastic cells treated with genistein from either day 8-16 or day 12-16, at dietarily achievable concentrations (10(-10) to 10(-8) M) (P<0.05). The mRNA expression of osteoprotegerin increased about 140% in cells treated from with genistein day 4-8 at a concentration of 10(-8) M (P<0.05). The ratio of estrogen receptor-alpha to beta expression increased 10-fold from day 0 to 12 of culture (P<0.05). Correlating with this time-dependent variation in estrogen receptor expression, treatments of 17beta-estradiol and genistein had opposite dose patterns on the ratio of estrogen receptor-alpha to beta expression following treatment from day 4 to 6 compared to from day 0 to 2. The addition of ICI-182,780, an estrogen receptor blocker, reduced the inhibitory effect of genistein on IL-6 production by 30-50%. In summary, these findings suggest that the beneficial skeletal effects of genistein, at dietarily achievable levels, appear to be mediated, at least in part, by interleukin-6 and osteoprotegerin, and estrogen receptors play important roles in the inhibition of interleukin-6 synthesis by genistein in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells.", 
    "155": "Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are thought to be an effective tool in improving efficiency and outcomes of clinical practice. Physicians' adherence to guidelines is reported to be poor. We evaluated the relationship between generalizability of guidelines on hypertension and physicians' adherence to guidelines' recommendations for pharmacological treatment.", 
    "156": "We used the Sixth Joint National Committee's (JNC VI) guidelines on hypertension to evaluate our hypothesis. We evaluated the evidence from controlled clinical trials on which the JNC VI bases its recommendation, and compared the population enrolled in those trials with the American hypertensive population. Data on this population came from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey III.", 
    "157": "Twenty-three percent of the NHANES population had a diagnosis of hypertension, 11% had hypertension requiring drug treatment according to the JNC VI. Only half of the population requiring treatment would have been enrolled in at least two trials. Rate of adherence to CPG was 69%. We found a weak association between generalizability and physicians' adherence to guidelines. Baseline risk was the major determinant of the decision to treat.", 
    "158": "JNC VI guidelines may not be generalizable to their target population. We found a relatively poor adherence rate to these guidelines. Failing of completely taking into account the clinical characteristics of the patients may be partly responsible for this lack of adherence.", 
    "159": "Beta blocker treatment has emerged as an effective treatment modality for heart failure. Interestingly, beta-blockers can activate both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic pathways. Nevertheless, the mechanism for improved cardiac function seen with beta-blocker treatment remains largely unknown. Carvedilol is a non-selective beta-blocker with alpha-receptor blockade and antioxidant properties. We therefore studied the impact of the effects of carvedilol in an animal model of end-stage heart failure.", 
    "160": "To test whether chronic treatment with beta-blockade decreases apoptosis, we treated myopathic turkeys with two dosages of carvedilol, 1 mg/kg (DCM1) and 20 mg/kg (DCM20), for four weeks and compared them to non-treated DCM animals (DCM0) and to control turkeys (CON). Echocardiographic measurements showed that non-treated DCM animals had a significantly lower fractional shortening (FS) when compared to CON (68.73 +/- 1.37 vs. 18.76 +/- 0.59%, p < 0.001). Both doses of carvedilol significantly improved FS (33.83 +/- 10.11 and 27.73 +/- 6.18% vs. 18.76 +/- 0.59% for untreated DCM, p < 0.001). DCM left ventricles were characterized by a higher percentage of apoptotic nuclei when compared to CON (5.64 +/- 0.49 vs. 1.72 +/- 0.12%, respectively p < 0.001). Both doses of carvedilol significantly reduced the number of apoptotic nuclei (2.32 +/- 0.23% and 2.36 +/-6% 1 mg and 20 mg/kg respectively).", 
    "161": "Carvedilol improves ventricular function. Furthermore, treatment with carvedilol decreased the incidence of apoptosis in cardiac myocytes from failing hearts at both doses. These data suggest that the inhibition of apoptosis with carvedilol may lead to improvement in ventricular function and may underlie a beneficial effect of beta-blockade independent of heart rate lowering effects.", 
    "162": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhances the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) in macrophages, and stimulates production of prostaglandins that cause endothelial dysfunction in septic shock. In an effort to identify strategies for reducing LPS-inducible expression of COX-2, inhibitors of the phospholipases involved in LPS dependent over-expression of COX-2 were studied. LPS enhances expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein by activating sequentially phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), protein kinase C (PKC) and phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D (PC-PLD). This stimulates production of phosphatidic acid (PA), which increases expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein. Inhibition of PC-PLC by D609 (tricyclodecanoyl xanthogenate), and of PC-PLD activity by 1-butanol, reduced LPS-dependent over-production of PA and suppressed the increase of COX-2 mRNA and protein. Activation of PKC, normally seen in LPS-treated cells, was mimicked with phorbol myristic acid (PMA), and this also increased PA production and enhanced COX-2 expression. Propranolol inhibition of phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PPH) increased PA accumulation and enhanced LPS-dependent COX-2 protein synthesis. These results suggest that inhibitors of PC-PLC, PKC and PC-PLD, or activators of PPH could be useful in the management of LPS-induced overproduction of prostaglandins and of vascular dysfunction in septic shock.", 
    "163": "During the last years increasing evidence has indicated that patients at risk for coronary artery disease may benefit from beta-adrenergic blocking therapy in the perioperative setting. It has been demonstrated that even a relatively brief treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking drugs decreases the incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia. Even more important is the observation that this reduction in perioperative ischemic events ultimately results in a decrease in long term cardiac morbidity and mortality. Despite overwhelming evidence on the beneficial effects of beta-adrenergic blocking in patients with coronary artery disease, many clinicians still feel some reluctance to use this type of drugs in the perioperative period. We organized a meeting to search for the major objectives that keep anesthetists from implementing prophylactic beta blocking therapy in their daily clinical practice. In this brief review we summarize the results of this meeting and discuss the current knowledge on this subject.", 
    "164": "The aim of the Antihypertensive Treatment and Lipid Profile in a North of Sweden Efficacy Evaluation study was to compare the long-term effect of the commonly used inexpensive medication with a low-dose diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide), alone or in combination with a beta-adrenoceptor (atenolol), with that of more modern but also more expensive antihypertensive treatment with an angiotensin-II-receptor blocker (candesartan), alone or in combination with a calcium antagonist (felodipine), and to do so in newly diagnosed patients with primary hypertension. The objectives included comparisons of the effects on the glucose metabolism, lipoprotein metabolism, electrolytes, blood pressure, and subjective symptoms.",

    "166": "In an investigator-initiated study, we included 392 patients (mean age 55 years, 48% men); 370 patients (94%) had never been treated with antihypertensive drugs before the study. No patient was lost to follow-up.", 
    "167": "Both treatment regimens lowered blood pressure well (23/13 mmHg in the hydrochlorothiazide group and 21/13 mmHg in the candesartan group), with a majority of patients needing two drugs. Fasting levels of both serum insulin and plasma glucose increased in the hydrochlorothiazide group in contrast to unaffected levels in the candesartan group. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in nine patients during follow-up, in eight patients in the hydrochlorothiazide group (4.1%) and in one patient (0.5%) in the candesartan group (P = 0.030). Triglycerides increased and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol decreased more in the hydrochlorothiazide group than in the candesartan group. Both the low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein and the apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I ratios increased in the hydrochlorothiazide group. At 12 months, 18 patients in the hydrochlorothiazide group versus five in the candesartan group had a 'metabolic syndrome', as defined by the World Health Organization (P = 0.007) despite 1 year of active blood pressure-lowering therapy. There were less (P = 0.020) adverse events in the candesartan group, but no major differences in the subjective symptoms assessment profile. One subject in each group had a myocardial infarction.", 
    "168": "Antihypertensive treatment with a diuretic, if needed combined with a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, was associated with an aggravated metabolic profile; this was not so for patients treated with an angiotensin-II-receptor blocker, if needed combined with a calcium antagonist. An antihypertensive treatment strategy that costs more in the short run but has no metabolic adverse effects may have a health economic impact in the long term.", 
    "169": "Hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias commonly coexist in many patients. In this review, we will initially discuss arrhythmogenesis in hypertension, with particular emphasis on atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, whilst in the final part, we will focus our attention on the effects of anti-hypertensive therapies on supra-ventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and on sudden cardiac death prevention. Many patients with atrial fibrillation or frequent premature ventricular contractions have hypertension, and both need to be managed appropriately. Furthermore, hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy could cause a wide variety of ventricular arrhythmias, which could end in sudden cardiac arrest. Most anti-hypertensive therapies, such as the beta blockers or ACE inhibitors, by slowing or interrupting the progression towards atrial and ventricular remodelling might exert some anti-arrhythmic effect, thus reducing the risk of sudden cardiac death in these patients.", 
    "170": "An assay method for identification of metabolites from in vitro microsomal incubations was developed for use in the early stage of drug discovery. We have developed a practical approach which involves integrated sample generation, sample preparation, bioanalysis, and data handling to maximize sample throughput and speed up the process for identification of metabolites. The assay system consisted of a robotic liquid handler (Genesis workstation) to generate and process samples, PALLAS MetabolExpert software to predict possible metabolites, exact mass measurement via a tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QTOF-MS) coupled with liquid chromatography to analyze samples, MetaboLynx software to find potential metabolites and Advanced Chemistry Development/MS (ACD/MS) software to provide guidance to the most likely hypothetical metabolite chemical structures. For purposes of evaluating this new method, dextromethorphan, alprenolol, and propranolol were incubated separately for up to 60 minutes with rat and human hepatic microsomes. The incubation and sample preparation were carried out in 96-well plates using the Genesis workstation. The bioanalysis was performed by LC-MS/MS using QTOF with MetaboLynx software to find metabolites. Metabolic products formed in vitro by rat and human microsomes were separated using an analytical column C18 with gradient elution at flow rate of 250 micro l/min. The internal mass calibration was performed by continuous postcolumn infusion of Haloperidol. The mass spectra from incubations containing NADPH were compared to those without NADPH (control) using the MetaboLynx software to find potential metabolites. Finally, the MS/MS spectra were processed by the ACD/MS software to predict the chemical structure. MetaboLynx software successfully identified metabolites for each of the drugs studied by automatically discerning expected metabolites. Exact differences in masses between each metabolite and parent drug were measured from five replicate sample injections. All measured values are accurate to less than 0.001Da or 3.8 ppm with the standard deviation within 0.0015 Da, which allowed good prediction/confirmation of empirical formulae. Hypothetical chemical structures were achieved by the ACD/MS software and provided a useful tool to assist in prediction of the metabolic pathways of the drugs. The metabolites identified were in good agreement with previously published results for all three compounds. This new method will greatly enhance throughput, which in turn will facilitate our ability to rapidly provide this guidance to the synthetic chemist.",

Rheumatismal hyperthyroidism is characterised by inflammatory rheumatismal pain evoking, as in our patient, a rhizomelic pseudo-polyarthritis. The outcome, whatever the anti-thyroid treatment, is always good. The physiopathological mechanisms are unknown. They may be due to an attack of the antibodies against the synovial and/or cartilage structures, or to the effect of propranolol.",

    "175": "CYP2C19 is an important human drug-metabolizing enzyme that metabolizes a number of clinically used drugs including the antiulcer drug omeprazole, the anxiolytic drug diazepam, the beta-blocker propranolol, the antimalarial drug proguanil, certain antidepressants and barbiturates, and the prototype substrate S-mephenytoin. Previous studies show that compounds such as rifampicin and dexamethasone induce CYP2C19 both in vivo in humans and in vitro in human hepatocytes. This study examines the transcriptional regulation of CYP2C19. Analysis of the CYP2C19 promoter revealed a single constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) binding site (CAR-RE; -1891/-1876 bp) and a glucocorticoid-responsive element (GRE; -1750/-1736 bp). Gel-shift assays showed that CAR-RE binds CAR and pregnane X receptor (PXR). Cotransfection with hCAR, mCAR, or hPXR in HepG2 cells up-regulated transcription of CYP2C19 promoter constructs, whereas mutation of the -1891-bp CAR-RE abolished up-regulation. Expression with hCAR also up-regulated endogenous CYP2C19 mRNA content in HepG2 cells. Androstenol repressed the mCAR-mediated constitutive activation of the CYP2C19 promoter in HepG2 cells, whereas the potent mCAR ligand 1,4-bis[2-3,5-dichloropyridyloxyl)] benzene derepressed this response. Rifampicin produced a modest increase in promoter activity in cells cotransfected with hPXR. Dexamethasone activated the -2.7-kb CYP2C19 promoter constructs in HepG2 cells only in the presence of cotransfected glucocorticoid receptor (GR), whereas the GR antagonist mifepristone inhibits this response. Mutation of the GRE abolishes dexamethasone activation. This is the first study to identify nuclear receptor binding sites (CAR/PXR and GR) in the CYP2C19 promoter and to suggest that these receptors may up-regulate CYP2C19 constitutively and possibly its response to drugs.",

    "177": "A non-randomised Latin square to compare guideline implementation in two neighbouring health districts covering 180 general practices. Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of patients with asthma and angina were implemented actively in one district and passively disseminated in the other district. Outcome measures for asthma were smoking status and inhaler technique. For angina the outcome measures were: smoking status; blood pressure; aspirin prescribed, contraindicated or self-medicated; beta-blocker prescribed or contraindicated; routine hospital admission; prescribed drugs; self-reported change.", 
    "178": "There were improvements in all outcome criteria between baseline and follow-up audits, regardless of whether the guideline was actively implemented or passively disseminated. The estimated increase in the proportion of records complying with guidelines was 4% [95% confidence intervals (CI): 0, 8] and was higher in intervention than in control practices. Using only records not compliant at baseline, the corresponding difference was 15% (95% CI: 7, 24). The only significant improvement associated with active implementation was smoking status in angina patients. Both prescribing and hospital admission monthly totals changed during the period of the trial, but there was no significant difference between the pattern of changes in intervention and control districts. A significantly greater proportion of health professionals saw the intervention guideline compared with the control (75% versus 25%). There was a significant correlation between self-reported change and interventions steps (P < 0.05).",

    "180": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) constitutes a significant clinical issue due to its increasing prevalence in general population and still fatal prognosis. During last twenty years the significance of beta-blockers in the treatment of CHF has changed. It resulted from the hypothesis from 1975 that in the course of CHF it comes to the activation of sympathetic system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Authors presented the actual views on CHF pathogenesis, mechanisms of favourable action of beta-blockers in CHF and the data from clinical trials on effectiveness of beta-blockers in different stages of CHF (among the others in elderly patients and in comparison with other treatment). Nevertheless, there are still several questions related to beta-blockers treatment in patients with CHF waiting to be resolved. Although the number of patients with CHF treated with beta-blockers is still increasing, the usefulness of conclusions resulting from clinical trials--as it has been shown in IMPROVEMENT-HF--is still insufficient. In contrast, following the recommendations of ESC, AHA and the Section of Heart Failure of Polish Cardiology Association both beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors constitute two main groups of medications that should be undoubtedly used in patients with CHF."
