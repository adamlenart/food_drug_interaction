    "0": "The influence of catecholamines on growth hormone secretion has been difficult to establish previously, possibly because of the suppressive effect of the induced hyperglycemia on growth hormone concentrations. In this study, an adrenergic receptor control mechanism for human growth hormone (HGH) secretion was uncovered by studying the effects of alpha and beta receptor blockade on insulin-induced growth hormone elevations in volunteer subjects. Alpha adrenergic blockade with phentolamine during insulin hypoglycemia, 0.1 U/kg, inhibited growth hormon elevations to 30-50% of values in the same subjects during insulin hypoglycemia without adrenergic blockade. More complete inhibition by phentolamine could not be demonstrated at a lower dose of insulin (0.05 U/kg). Beta adrenergic blockade with propranolol during insulin hypoglycemia significantly enhanced HGH concentrations in paired experiments. The inhibiting effect of alpha adrenergic receptor blockade on HGH concentrations could not be attributed to differences in blood glucose or free fatty acid values; however, more prolonged hypoglycemia and lower plasma free fatty acid values may have been a factor in the greater HGH concentrations observed during beta blockade. In the absence of insulin induced hypoglycemia, neither alpha nor beta adrenergic receptor blockade had a detectable effect on HGH concentrations. Theophylline, an inhibitor of cyclic 3'5'-AMP phosphodiesterase activity, also failed to alter plasma HGH concentrations. These studies demonstrate a stimulatory effect of alpha receptors and a possible inhibitory effect of beta receptors on growth hormone secretion.", 
    "1": "Blockade of the adrenergic receptors or the injection of Bordetella pertussis vaccine prevented the normal hyperglycemic response of CFW mice to exogenous cyclic 3',5'-adenosine phosphate (3',5'-AMP). The cyclic nucleotide was also ineffective in offsetting the histamine hypersensitivity of the beta-adrenergically blocked and the pertussis-sensitized groups. These observations suggest that the autonomic malfunction occurs at a point(s) subsequent to release of 3',5'-AMP. Neither the hyperglycemic effect of epinephrine or 3',5'-AMP, or both, nor the histamine sensitivity of pertussis-pretreated animals was influenced by the subcutaneous administration of theophylline.", 
    "2": "1. The morphology of the smooth muscle of the rabbit portal vein and its innervation were studied with fluorescence and electron microscopy. Two layers of smooth muscle were observed in the tunica media: an inner layer of circularly arranged muscle cells and an outer layer consisting of bundles of smooth muscle cells arranged in a near longitudinal direction. The membranes of neighbouring smooth muscle cells were occasionally fused to form ;tight junctions'.2. Bundles of non-myelinated nerve fibres were observed in the adventitia, and between bundles and layers of smooth muscle cells in the media. Studies on longitudinal sections with fluorescence microscopy revealed a network of varicose noradrenergic axons.3. Electrical and mechanical activity was recorded from longitudinal strips of smooth muscle from the media of the vein with a sucrose-gap apparatus.4. The preparation was spontaneously active under minimal resting tension (less than 150 mg) and at temperatures above 28 degrees C. Slow depolarizations led to a burst of spikes (multi-spike complexes), which corresponded to rhythmic contractions. In 10% of preparations, the interval between multi-spike complexes showed a slower depolarization, suggesting the record was from a pace-maker region.5. The frequency of spontaneous activity (3-27 beats/min) was very sensitive to changes in temperature and tension.6. Noradrenaline in low doses (0.01 mug) caused an increase in frequency of the multi-spike complexes. Higher doses (0.1-0.3 mug) initiated continuous high-frequency spiking, while very high doses (0.6-2.0 mug) caused maintained depolarization.7. Responses to repetitive electrical stimulation of the vein were qualitatively similar to those in response to exogenous noradrenaline. The relation between the mechanical response and the various parameters of stimulation was consistent with the stimulation of sympathetic nerve fibres in the wall of the vein.8. The actions of isoprenaline, phentolamine and propranolol indicated the presence of alpha ;excitatory' and beta ;inhibitory' adrenotrophic receptors on the smooth muscle.", 
    "3": "1. Afferent discharges were observed in dissected filaments of nerves to the adrenal gland in the rabbit and cat.2. Systemic intravenous and close intra-arterial injections of (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline caused cessation or depression of the spontaneous firing rate.3. Intravenous injection of acetylcholine and electrical stimulation of the splanchnic nerve also depressed the afferent discharge rate.4. Modification of blood pressure levels by chemical and mechanical means did not modify the afferent discharge.5. Alpha blocking agents (ergotamine and phenoxybenzamine) blocked the effect of (-)-adrenaline on the firing rate. Beta blocking agents (dichloroisoprenaline and propranolol) were without effect.6. It is suggested that an afferent system is present in the adrenal gland. Within this system are chemosensitive receptors which may constitute the afferent limb of a local feed-back loop involved in adrenal catecholamine release."
