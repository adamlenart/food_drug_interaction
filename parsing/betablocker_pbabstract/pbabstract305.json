    "1": "Measurements of IOP were taken at baseline (pretreatment) and 2, 6, and 12 hours after instillation on treatment days 15, 30, 60, and 90. Mean sensitivity (MS) and mean defect (MD) values of perimetry before and after treatment and the effects of the three beta blockers on serum lipid profiles were determined. Ocular and systemic side effects were recorded.", 
    "2": "The most prominent IOP lowering effect was noted with metipranolol at 2 and 6 hours on day 15, and with timolol maleate at 12 hours on day 15 and at all hours of the subsequent days on which measurements were taken. Timolol maleate produced a significant decrease in IOP at 12 hours on day 15 compared with carteolol. There was not a statistically significant difference between the MS and MD values on perimetry before and after treatment for any treatment. There was a statistically significant decrease in levels of total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and a significant increase in triglyceride levels; these changes were observed for all treatments.", 
    "3": "The effects of the three medications were not statistically different from each other in terms of IOP reduction and visual field changes. Careful monitoring of blood lipid levels is necessary with long-term treatment with beta blockers, because these agents reduced serum levels of HDL and total cholesterol while increasing triglycerides. Such changes in lipid levels could lead to increased incidence of complications, particularly in patients with atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease.",

Following our previous results, we summarized that spontaneous ventricular defibrillation requires high level of intercellular coupling and synchronization, both of which depends on intracellular free Ca2+ concentration. We hypothesized that any antiarrhythmic compound that facilitates spontaneous defibrillation, including d-sotalol and tedisamil, should prevent intracellular free Ca2+ overload most likely by elevating cAMP level and enhancing cAMP-related Ca2+ uptake of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The aim of the present study was to examine the role of the SR uptake function in their effect against Ca2+ overload.",

The trials were assessed by at least two independent reviewers for inclusion, quality score, and data extraction. The reviewers located five studies with 117 participants. The data were poorly presented in these short-term studies and did not evidence any effect of beta-blockers as an adjunct to conventional antipsychotic medication. At present beta-blockers cannot be recommended in the treatment of schizophrenia, and schizophrenia treatment guidelines advocating use of beta-blockers should be revised.",

We investigated the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) at the application site of PRL and the role of these inflammatory chemical mediators in the occurrence of the skin reactions. PGE2 was found to be produced at the application site slightly after the accumulation of PRL released from the adhesive bandage in the patch test, and the amount of PGE2 increased continuously, with a peak value obtained at 24 h after application. The time-course changes resembled those of delta a* value, the index of erythema formation determined by colorimetric measurement, and edema formation. The production of PGE2 by dermal application of PRL was suppressed by local pretreatment with dexamethasone or indomethacin. However, no notable production of LTB4 was observed at the application site of PRL.",

Nevertheless, a cost saving per treated patient with respect to beta-blocker and ACE inhibitors was observed, mainly as a result of a change of preparations and a drop in drug company sales prices. When beginning of a new therapy with oral antidiabetics, the physicians increasingly used acarbose rather than less expensive sulphonylureas. A previous trend of increased use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics for antihypertensive treatment was maintained. In 1993 and 1994, the number of prescriptions and the prescription costs for lipid lowering drugs decreased compared to the values of the last six months of 1992. A global decrease in prescription use of drugs without proven efficacy observed in the first six months of 1993, did not persist.",

Cell viability, chromatin condensation, mitochondrial mass and activity, free radicals production were studied by microplate cold light cytometry. Moreover, relative cell number was evaluated by crystal violet colorimetric test. In addition, cell size and the expression of an apoptotic marker Apo2.7 were studied by flow cytometry.", 
    "24": "Timolol-BAC(+) induced a rapid decrease in cell viability ranging from 40% immediately after treatment to 85% 24h later. A small, significantly less important decrease in cell viability was also observed with all tested concentrations of timolol-BAC(-). 24h after treatment with 0.25% timolol-BAC(+), the relative cell number was reduced by 55% whereas it did not vary after 0.25% timolol -BAC(-) treatment. Only timolol-BAC(+) induced chromatin condensation, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and cell size reduction. Moreover, cells treated with timolol-BAC(+) overexpressed the apoptotic marker Apo2.7. Also reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was significantly more important after cell exposure to timolol-BAC(+).", 
    "25": "In our model of conjunctival cells in vitro, timolol-BAC(+) induced irreversible cytotoxic damage with some characteristics of apoptosis. The active compound of timolol-BAC(-) could be responsible for ROS production and for cell viability variations. Oxidative stress could also play a role in timolol-BAC(+)-induced toxicity. In vitro toxic effects of antiglaucoma drugs could, in part, explain some ocular surface disorders in long-term treated patients.", 
    "26": "The use of transdermal iontophoresis is a promising technique for the systemic delivery of water soluble and ionic drugs of relatively large molecular size. The present study investigates the skin pre-treatment with Azone (laurocapram) and iontophoresis on the pharmacodynamic effect of timolol maleate (TM) in vivo in albino rabbits. The pharmacodynamic effect of TM was evaluated by transdermal delivery and compared with an intravenous (i.v.) administration. Iontophoresis of TM (0.1 mg/ml) produced a significant inhibition in the isoprenaline (ISP)-induced tachycardia. Iontophoresis with higher concentration of TM (1 mg/ml) produced a 100% inhibition of the ISP induced tachycardia. Pre-treatment of skin with Azone (3% v/v emulsion) eliminated the lag time and prolonged the duration of action of iontophoresis from 4 to 6 h. The AUC of Azone treated group was significantly higher than that of the untreated group (P<0.05). Further, the AUC with iontophoretic delivery and pre-treatment of Azone was comparable to that of intravenous TM (30 microg/kg). In conclusion, iontophoresis in combination with Azone can increase the transdermal delivery of TM, whereby the required transport rate can be achieved with a lower drug concentration.", 
    "27": "The action of carvedilol, a vasodilating, beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, against lipid peroxidation has been the subject of many studies, but the results reported thus far are contradictory. In an attempt to define the antioxidant mechanism of carvedilol against lipid peroxidation, the dynamics of the action of carvedilol were studied in several oxidation systems. We investigated the reactivity of carvedilol toward radicals and its inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation induced by several kinds of initiating species such as azo compounds and metal ions in solution, micelles, membranes, and low-density lipoprotein. Carvedilol exerted poor reactivity toward phenoxyl, alkoxyl, and peroxyl radicals in acetonitrile solution nor did it show an appreciable antioxidant effect against either the peroxyl radical-induced oxidation of methyl linoleate in acetonitrile or against phosphatidylcholine liposomal membranes in aqueous suspension. Carvedilol completely inhibited the ferric ion-induced oxidation of methyl linoleate micelles by sequestering ferric ions, but not by reducing hydroperoxide. It was shown that carvedilol enhanced the oxidation of micelles induced by either methemoglobin or peroxyl radical. Carvedilol, which was added exogenously, did not suppress the oxidation of isolated low-density lipoprotein induced by peroxyl radical or cupric ion. These results show that carvedilol does not act as a radical-scavenging antioxidant, but that it does act most efficiently as an antioxidant against ferric ion-induced oxidation by sequestering ferric ion.", 
    "28": "The crystallisation conditions and the physicochemical properties of the modifications I and II of (R,S) propranolol hydrochloride were investigated. Detailed methods of preparation of the two forms were described. Data from FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, thermal analysis, solubility and dissolution studies were used for the identification and the characterisation of the two forms. The forms I and II were easily differentiated by their IR spectra, X-ray patterns and thermal behaviour. The two polymorphs were found to be enantiotropically related to each other. Their stability was followed at room temperature over a period of 1 year and under different conditions of temperature, grinding and compression to verify the tendency to solid solid transition and to study the existence range of the two forms. The equilibrium solubilities of the two polymorphs in n-octanol were determined as well as their dissolution profiles as pellets in aqueous medium. These studies showed that form I, the less thermodynamically stable, was more soluble (by more than 34%) and dissolved faster than form II in agreement with the thermodynamic rules (A. Burger, R. Ramberger, Mikrochim. Acta II (1979) 259-271).", 
    "29": "Although the majority of patients with depression respond well to their initial pharmacologic treatment, as many as 30% to 45% fail to achieve an adequate response. In addition to the more traditional lithium and thyroid hormone augmentation strategies, a number of new pharmacotherapeutic approaches are currently being used to help manage refractory depression, including the addition of another agent or a switch to another antidepressant. Augmentation and switching strategies are often selected in order to obtain a different neurochemical effect (e.g., adding a relatively noradrenergic agent to a relatively serotonergic antidepressant). In particular, several studies have suggested that depressed patients refractory to treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may show a good response to newer agents that have a pharmacologic profile distinct from the SSRIs. Furthermore, preliminary studies have shown that the addition of SSRIs to either noradrenergic drugs such as the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or dopaminergic agents may be efficacious, even though concerns about drug-drug interactions and tricyclic cardiac toxicity have limited the use of TCA-SSRI combinations. The introduction of reboxetine, a relatively selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, may increase the use of the latter therapeutic approach because of its improved safety profile compared with the TCAs. The review of treatment options for refractory depression that follows will outline the advantages, disadvantages, and level of support for a number of new treatment strategies.",

    "31": "In vitro results are inconclusive as to whether cilostazol is metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2D6 (CYP2D6). The goals of this study were (1) to assure the dose of quinidine and timing relative to cilostazol used in this study were adequate to cause inhibition of CYP2D6, (2) to evaluate carryover effects of quinidine administration, and (3) to evaluate the effect of CYP2D6 deficiency and administration of quinidine (a CYP2D6 inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics of a single 100 mg oral dose of cilostazol.", 
    "32": "This study was conducted as a single-centre, open-label, randomised sequence, 2-period, crossover pharmacokinetic trial. Water alone (treatment without quinidine) or two 200 mg oral doses of quinidine sulfate with water were administered 25 hours and 1 hour prior to a single 100 mg dose of cilostazol in period 1. Study participants were crossed over to opposite treatment in period 2. Metoprolol 25 mg, used as a positive control, was administered 1 hour after quinidine sulfate with water or using water alone to assess the magnitude of CYP2D6 inhibition by quinidine.", 
    "33": "22 healthy nonsmoking Caucasian (14 male and 8 female) volunteers participated in the study.", 
    "34": "Serial blood and urine samples were collected at predose and after cilostazol administration to characterise cilostazol and its metabolite pharmacokinetics. Additional plasma samples were taken to assess the pharmacokinetics of quinidine. Urine samples were collected to measure metoprolol and hydroxymetoprolol.", 
    "35": "Administration of metoprolol with quinidine caused a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in the urinary 4-hydroxymetoprolol/metoprolol ratio compared with administration of metoprolol alone (42-fold decrease, 0.065 vs 2.707). Hence, quinidine effectively converted extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 to poor metabolisers of CYP2D6. The 21-day washout period was adequate to have complete recovery from quinidine inhibition of CYP2D6. The analysis of variance demonstrated that the mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for cilostazol, both adjusted and unadjusted for the free fraction, was higher in the control group than in the quinidine group (p = 0.023). However, the time to Cmax (p = 0.669), the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC infinity; p = 0.133), and the apparent oral clearance (p = 0.135) were unchanged. The geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) comparing with quinidine (test) and without quinidine (reference) coadministration for Cmax and AUC infinity are 0.86 (0.77, 0.95) and 0.92 (0.84, 1.00), respectively. Similar patterns were observed for OPC-13015 and OPC-13213 with regard to Cmax, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration at time t, and AUC infinity (where determinable). The slight decrease in the systemic availability of cilostazol and its metabolites was thought to be a result of the increased gastrointestinal motility secondary to quinidine.", 
    "36": "Administration of quinidine sulfate 200 mg profoundly inhibited CYP2D6-mediated metabolism. The effects of quinidine inhibition of CYP2D6 metabolism were completely reversible during the 21-day washout period. Coadministration of quinidine with cilostazol had no substantial effect on cilostazol or its metabolites (OPC-13015 and OPC-13213). Hence, CYP2D6 does not have a significant contribution in the metabolic elimination of cilostazol.", 
    "37": "Memory for pain is an important research and clinical issue since patients ability to accurately recall pain plays a prominent role in medical practice. The purpose of this prospective study was to find out if patients, with an episode of chest pain due to suspected acute myocardial infarction could accurately retrieve the pain initially experienced at home and during the first day of hospitalization after 6 months. A total of 177 patients were included in this analysis. The patients rated their experience of pain on a numerical rating scale. The maximal pain at home was retrospectively assessed, thereafter pain assessments were made at several points of time after admission. After 6 months they were asked to recall the intensity of pain and once again rate it on the numerical rating scale. The results from the initial and 6-month registrations were compared. In general, patients rated their maximal intensity of chest pain as being higher at the 6-month recollection as compared with the assessments made during the initial hospitalization. In particular, in patients with a high level of emotional distress, there was a systematic overestimation of the pain intensity at recall.", 
    "38": "beta-Blockers are well documented to prolong life in patients after myocardial infarction (MI), yet patients who also have asthma are frequently and understandably denied this therapy. We reviewed the literature (via MEDLINE) for the past 35 years for beta-blocker-induced asthma, and reexamined potential beta-blocker use in the context of NIH guidelines for asthma classification and management. Because beta-blockers can cause fatal or life-threatening asthma, their use should be avoided in moderate to severe persistent asthmatics. Benefits of low-dose beta(1)-blockers (e.g. atenolol 50 mg daily) may outweigh risks in some patients with mild intermittent or well-controlled mild persistent asthma. Further study is needed to verify that low doses of beta(1)-blockers are effective in prolonging life after MI, and that use specifically in mild intermittent or mild persistent asthma per NIH classification is safe.", 
    "39": "To clarify the role of neural factors in the regulation of apolipoprotein (apo) A-IV expression in the small intestine, we investigated the effect of neural blockers on mRNA levels of apo A-IV in rat small intestine. Either ganglionic blocker (hexamethonium), cholinergic blocker (atropine) or beta-adrenergic blocker (propranolol) was infused intravenously to unrestrained conscious rats for 8 h, and then total RNA was isolated from the small intestine and analyzed using Northern hybridization. Apo A-IV mRNA levels in the ileum were significantly lower in hexamethonium- or atropine-infused rats than in saline- (control) or propranolol-infused rats. Immunoblot analysis showed no difference in plasma apo A-IV concentrations between hexamethonium- and saline-infused groups. The lower mRNA levels of apo A-IV in the ileum of hexamethonium-infused rats were observed even in bile-drained rats, indicating that the lower expression was not due to any changes in bile availability. The ileal apo A-IV mRNA levels were significantly higher in rats infused with lipid emulsion into the ileum than in rats infused with glucose-saline, and the concomitant infusion of intravenous hexamethonium did not affect the higher levels of apo A-IV mRNA. These results suggest that the basal expression of the ileal A-IV gene is at least partially regulated in a site-specific manner by cholinergic neurons.", 
    "40": "An enantioselective liquid chromatography method was developed for the simultaneous determination of propafenone (PPF) and 5-hydroxypropafenone (PPF-5OH) enantiomers in plasma. After liquid liquid extraction with dichloromethane, the enantiomers were resolved on a Chiralpak AD column using hexane-ethanol (88:12, v/v) plus 0.1% diethylamine as the mobile phase and monitored at 315 nm. Under these conditions the enantiomeric fractions of the drug and of its metabolite were analysed within 20 min. The extraction procedure resulted in absolute recoveries of 62.9 and 61.3% for (R)- and (S)-PPF, respectively, and of 57.6 and 56.5% for (R)- and (S)-PPF-5OH, respectively. This procedure was efficient in removing endogenous interferents as well the interference of an other PPF metabolite, N-despropylpropafenone (PPF-NOR). The calibration curves were linear over the concentration range 25-1250 ng/ml. Low values of the coefficients of variation were demonstrated for both within-day and between day assays. The method described in this paper allows the determination of PPF and PPF-5OH enantiomers at plasma levels as low as 25 ng/ml and can be used in clinical pharmacokinetic studies.", 
    "41": "The photostability of the beta-blocker drug Atenolol was evaluated at pH 9, 7.4 and 4.0. The drug was exposed to UVA-UVB radiations and the photoproducts were detected by reversed phase LC methods. The photodegradation was found to increase with the pH value decreasing. The major photodegradation product at pH 7.4 was identified as 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamide. The LC method developed for routine analyses (column: C-18 Alltima; mobile phase: TEA acetate (pH 4; 0.01 M)-acetonitrile 96:4) was found to be suitable for the stability indicating determination of Atenolol in pharmaceutical dosage forms.", 
    "42": "In at least one large study, the average time from arrival at the emergency department to arrival in the operating room was nearly 6 hours. That 30% of survivors will die in the same amount of time underscores the need for rapid diagnosis and treatment. In blunt thoracic aortic injury, beta-blockers have been shown to reduce the incidence of rupture, and their use is rarely contraindicated. A working knowledge of the mechanisms of injury likely to produce this lesion, commonly associated injuries, clinically relevant and easily recognizable chest film findings, and appropriate use of beta-blockade can have a significant impact on mortality. Any physician responsible for evaluation of trauma patients should be familiar with this information.", 
    "43": "The involvement of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) type 1 receptor in CRH-induced cardiac responses was studied in freely moving rats. Intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of 2 microg CRH under resting conditions resulted in a significant increase in heart rate (HR), but did not significantly affect the PQ interval of the electrocardiogram. This effect involves sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation, since CRH-treatment resulted in a marked increase in plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E), and sympathetic blockade by subcutaneously injected atenolol (1 mg/kg), a beta1-selective adrenergic antagonist, completely prevented the CRH-induced tachycardia. CRH infusion after sympathetic blockade resulted in an elongation of the PQ interval, indicating CRH-induced vagal activation. Gross locomotor activity (GA) was determined to study its possible indirect effects on cardiac activity. Although CRH induced a marked increase in GA, this effect followed the tachycardiac response, indicating that the HR response was not a consequence of increased locomotor activity, but was a direct effect of icv CRH. Treatment with CP-154,526 (icv, 10 or 25 microg), a selective CRH type 1 receptor antagonist, did not affect baseline HR, plasma NE and E, whereas it partially blocked the CRH-induced increase in HR, plasma NE and E levels. CP-154,526 treatment had no significant effects on baseline or CRH-induced changes in GA. These results indicate that CRH activates the sympathetic nervous system at least in part via the CRH type 1 receptor.", 
    "44": "Important parameters to consider when developing a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method are buffer type and concentration, and column geometry. In the work presented here the choice of buffer for the analysis of basic compounds using a polar embedded phase (HyPURITYtrade mark ADVANCE) is illustrated for the analysis of tricyclic antidepressants. Method transfer from a 4.6 mm i.d. column to a 2.1 mm i.d. column is demonstrated for the analysis of triazines and anabolic steroids and their metabolites, with no change in selectivity and with added speed of analysis. Analysis of eight beta-blockers is achieved in 65 seconds by using a short 30 x 4.6 mm C18 column.", 
    "45": "Low cerebral uptake of some therapeutic drugs can be enhanced by modulation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an ATP-driven drug efflux pump at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We investigated the possibility of increasing cerebral uptake of the beta-adrenergic ligands S-1'-[(18)F]-fluorocarazolol (FCAR) and [(11)C]-carazolol (CAR) in P-gp knockout mice (mdr1a (-/-)) and by modulation of P-gp with cyclosporin A (CsA) in rats. Specific and nonspecific binding of FCAR in the rat brain were doubled by CsA, while target/nontarget ratios and clearance from plasma (area under curve (AUC)) were not affected. Cerebral uptake of CAR in rats was much lower than FCAR and nonspecific. CsA increased this uptake 5-6-fold, not only due to P-gp modulation in the BBB but also to a 2-fold higher plasma AUC. In the CNS of mdr1a (-/-) mice, uptake of FCAR and CAR was, respectively, 2-fold and 3-fold higher than in mdr1a (+/+) mice. These results indicate that the cerebral uptake of beta-adrenoceptor ligands can be increased by administration of P-gp modulators such as CsA without affecting regional distribution in the brain. P-gp modulation could improve the count statistics in PET studies of the CNS.", 
    "46": "It has been proposed that two types of vitiligo exist from the physiological and clinical points of view. Nonsegmental-type vitiligo is associated with autoimmune diseases while segmental-type vitiligo results from the dysfunction of sympathetic nerves in the affected area. Using laser Doppler flowmetry and iontophoresis for cutaneous microcirculatory assessments, we evaluated these two types of vitiligo in regard to their physiological changes. Ten patients with facial stable stage segmental-type vitiligo and ten stable nonsegmental-type vitiligo patients were selected for this study. Our results revealed that a nearly threefold increase in cutaneous blood flow was noticed in segmental-type vitiligo as compared to contralateral normal skin. In contrast, a 1.4-1.5 times difference was found among nonsegmental-type vitiligo, lesion side clinically normal skin and contralateral normal skin. There was a significant increase in cutaneous alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor response in segmental-type vitiligo lesions. However, no change in plasma catecholamines or adrenoceptor densities on blood cells was noticed. Our findings suggest that a dysfunction of the sympathetic nerves exists in the affected skin and plays a role in the pathogenesis of segmental-type vitiligo.", 
    "47": "Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) are two methods to measure particle sizes in the order of 10 nm magnitude, which can be used to characterize reversed micellar systems, in this case reverse micelles consisting of lecithin and isopropyl myristate (IPM). In this study these micelles are loaded with different concentrations of the amphiphilic anti-glaucoma drug timolol maleate (TM). The PCS results are consistent with those yielded by SAXS, showing a decrease of particle size with higher TM concentration. In addition, SAXS is capable to give information about the particle shape. This kind of evaluation yields an ellipsoidal shape for micelles with low drug loads, which transform into nearly spherical micelles at higher drug concentrations.",

    "49": "The stereoselective pharmacokinetics of propafenone (PPF) and its active metabolite 5-hydroxypropafenone (5-OHP) as well as their glucuronide and sulfate conjugates have been investigated, in order to clarify the relationship between metabolism and stereoselective disposition of PPF in humans. After oral administration of 300 mg racemic PPF hydrochloride to 10 healthy Chinese subjects, the areas under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) for (S)-PPF were significantly higher (S/R ratio, 1.50+/-0.17) and the apparent oral clearance significantly lower (S/R ratio, 0.68+/-0.07) than those parameters for (R)-PPF. In contrast, the AUCs of PPF glucuronide (PPF-G) were lower for (S)-PPF-G than for the (R)-enantiomer (S/R ratio, 0.83+/-0.12). The partial clearance of (S)-PPF by glucuronidation pathway was lower than that of (R)-PPF and the enantiomeric ratio was 0.62+/-0.04. The t(max) values of PPF glucuronide diastereoisomers showed no statistically significant differences between each other, but were much shorter than the corresponding values of the parent drug, implying that glucuronidation may be the 'first-choice' pathway in presystemic metabolism of PPF. Glucuronidation of 5-OHP favored the (S)-enantiomer, whereas the sulfation showed a large preference for the (R)-enantiomer. After beta-glucuronidase hydrolysis, no significant differences were observed in AUCs between 5-OHP enantiomers (including unconjugated and conjugated 5-OHP). The results suggest that the significant difference in disposition between PPF enantiomers may be, at least in part attributed to stereoselective metabolism in the glucuronidation pathway.", 
    "50": "An original dosage form for oral delivery based on the encapsulation of both, lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, in poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) microparticles prepared either by the oil-in-water (o/w) or the water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) solvent evaporation method was developed. Microparticles were characterized in terms of morphology, size, encapsulation efficiency and drug release. The physical state of the drugs and the polymer was determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffractometry, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Nifedipine (calcium antagonist) and propranolol HCl (beta-blocker), used for the treatment of hypertension, were chosen as lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs. The microparticles were spherical with diameters in the range of 191-351 microm by the o/w-method, and in the range of 302-477 microm by the w/o/w-method. The encapsulation efficiency (EE) was 91% for nifedipine and 37% for propranolol HCl with the o/w-method, and 83% for nifedipine and 57% for propranolol HCl with the w/o/w-method. DSC and X-ray diffraction studies showed that PCL maintained its semi-crystalline structure, while the drugs were either dispersed or dissolved in the polymer. In vitro release studies revealed a controlled release of nifedipine and propranolol HCl from microparticles prepared by the o/w-method; a burst release of propranolol HCl was observed from microparticles prepared by the w/o/w-method. In conclusion, microparticles containing both a hydrophilic and a lipophilic drug were successfully prepared.", 
    "51": "The purpose of this study was to develop and characterize a functional air-interfaced primary culture of rabbit conjunctival epithelial cells grown on a permeable support for drug transport studies. Conjunctival epithelial cells from the pigmented rabbit were isolated, seeded at 1.2 x 10(6) cells cm(-2) on permeable Transwell filters, and cultured at the air interface using a modified PC-1 medium. Conjunctival epithelial cell layers showed a transepithelial resistance of 1.1+/-0.1 kOmega cm(2), a potential difference of 17.0+/-0.5 mV, and an equivalent short-circuit current (I(eq)) of 16.1+/-0.4 microA cm(-2). The I(eq) was reduced by 35% using 0.01 mM bumetanide, 66% using 0.1 mM ouabain, 46% using 2 mM barium chloride (all three in the basolateral fluid), and 63% using 0.3 mM NPAA in the apical fluid, consistent with active Cl(-)-secretion across the conjunctival epithelial barrier. Amiloride-sensitive Na(+) channels were absent. The permeability of the cell layers to polar solutes decreased with increased solute size, and the calculated equivalent pore size was about 8.0 nm. The Papp of beta-blockers varied with lipophilicity in a sigmoidal fashion. Uridine transport showed temperature sensitivity and directionality, favoring transport in the apical-to-basolateral direction. Apical L-carnosine uptake was reduced by 46% in the absence of an inwardly directed proton gradient, and lowering the temperature to 4 degrees C abolished direction-dependent L-carnosine uptake. Furthermore, uptake was inhibited by 73% using apical 10 mM glycyl sarcosine (a dipeptide transporter substrate) and by 60% using 1 mM L-valacyclovir (a dipeptide prodrug). In conclusion, a functional air-interfaced primary culture of rabbit conjunctival epithelial cell layers was established. This air-interfaced primary culture model may be useful for studying passive and active transport processes for ion and solute translocation in the mammalian conjunctival epithelial barrier in a defined experimental setting.",

Total exercise duration was significantly reduced by bisoprolol (-19.4 +/- 6.7%, P< 0.01) (mean +/- SEM) and by atenolol (-29.8 +/- 6.6%, P< 0.001), compared with placebo. Atenolol and bisoprolol were equally effective in lowering resting plasma renin activity, heart rate and systolic blood pressure. Resting and exercise stroke volume were significantly increased by both drugs, so that cardiac output was not significantly affected. Both drugs induced significant decreases in plasma-free fatty acid concentrations during recovery and blunted the exercise-induced increase. There were no significant relationships between the reduction of exercise duration and the haemodynamic changes or the degree of impairment of the exercise-induced increase in free fatty acid release resulting from beta-blockade.",

    "68": "Some studies suggest that beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasorelaxation is in part mediated through nitric oxide (NO) release. We wished to determine the contribution of the L-arginine / NO system to vasodilatation in response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation with isoprenaline or cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) elevation with forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP in vivo, using a rabbit femoral artery constant perfusion model. Baseline femoral artery pressure was similar in rabbits receiving isoprenaline, forskolin or dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Isoprenaline, forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP each decreased femoral artery pressure in a dose-dependent manner. The doses (mol kg(-1)) of isoprenaline, forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP which decreased pressure by 10% from baseline, expressed as a negative logarithm (-log ED(10)) were: 10.0+/-0.2, 9.5+/-0.1 and 4.9+/-0.1 respectively (P<0.0001 for each). Use of beta-adrenoceptor subtype-selective antagonists showed that the vascular response to isoprenaline was purely due to stimulation of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor subtype. Injection of 1 micromol kg(-1) N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) did not alter baseline pressure. However, it abolished the pressure response to isoprenaline (P<0.0001), and significantly attenuated the pressure responses to forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP: -log ED(10) values for forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, in the presence of L-NAME, were 7.9+/-0.1 and 3.5+/-0.3 respectively (P<0.0001 for each, as compared with values in the absence of L-NAME). These results indicate that beta(2)-adrenergic stimulation and cylic AMP elevation activate the L-arginine/NO system in rabbit femoral artery in vivo, and that NO generation contributes importantly to the changes in vascular tone induced by agents which modulate beta-adrenoceptors or cyclic AMP.", 
    "69": "Murine relapsing EAE can be profoundly suppressed by restraint stress (RST) administered beginning prior to neuroantigen immunization. This study determined what hormone pathway(s) mediate disease suppression. Our results showed that nadolol (NAD), a beta2-adrenergic antagonist, did not reverse the RST-induced suppression of EAE. However, administration of either RU486 or aminoglutethimide, which block the action of peripheral glucocorticoids, resulted in a partial reversal of EAE suppression. Administration of exogenous corticosterone mimicked the effects of RST, in terms of suppression of EAE, decrease in lymphoid cell numbers and decrease in Thl cytokine production. Therefore, the HPA axis plays a more profound role in the RST-induced suppression of EAE than does the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "70": "Rocky Mountain Kaiser Permanente has taken aggressive steps to ensure optimal treatment of all modifiable cardiac risk factors, especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, in patients with coronary artery disease. In this article, we are presenting (1) the basic rationale for our approach, (2) the critical steps translating philosophy into practice, and (3) justification for all health plans to pursue a similar course. The continuum of physician-directed disease management systems that have evolved in our region-one administered by cardiology nurses in the perihospitalization period and the other by pharmacists in the long-term, outpatient setting-is then detailed. Although the relatively short duration that our comprehensive systems have been in place precludes any assessment of their impact on cardiac death, coronary artery disease events, or coronary artery disease procedure rates, the improvements in intermediate surrogate outcomes are promising. Virtually all surveyed patients participating in our management systems have been \"very\" or \"extremely\" satisfied with their experience. The LDL-cholesterol screening rate in the approximately 2,500 participants in the programs to date has reached 97%. Of these patients, 84% have LDL cholesterol <130 mg/dL and 48% <100 mg/dL, and only 15% of those few with LDL cholesterol >130 mg/dL (2.5% overall) are currently not receiving lipid-lowering therapy. The proportions of patients on aspirin/antiplatelet and beta-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction are 97% and 92%, respectively. The lipid-screening and treatment rates, especially, represent significant improvement from our own baseline, and compare favorably with outcomes from other practice settings. In conclusion, health maintenance organizations have tremendous incentive and the unique opportunity and ability to develop systems to better manage large numbers of individuals with coronary artery disease.", 
    "71": "Despite clear and consistent clinical-trial evidence that secondary-prevention medical therapies reduce mortality in patients with established coronary artery disease, these therapies are underutilized in patients receiving conventional care. To address this issue, a Cardiac Hospitalization Atherosclerosis Management Program (CHAMP) focused on initiation of aspirin, cholesterol-lowering medication (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A [HMG-CoA] reductase inhibitor titrated to achieve low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol < 100 mg/dL), beta-blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor therapy in conjunction with diet and exercise counseling before hospital discharge in patients with established coronary artery disease was designed and implemented at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Medical Center starting in 1994. This treatment program was based on the hypothesis that initiation of therapy in the hospital setting would result in higher utilization rates both at the time of discharge and during longer-term follow-up. Implementation of this program involved the use of a focused treatment guideline, standardized admission orders, educational lectures by local thought leaders, and tracking/reporting of treatment rates. To assess the impact of the program, treatment rates and clinical outcome were compared in patients discharged in the 2-year periods before and after CHAMP was implemented. Hospital-based treatment protocols such as CHAMP have the potential to significantly increase treatment utilization of therapies previously demonstrated to improve survival and thus substantially improve the outcome of the 2 million patients diagnosed and hospitalized each year with coronary artery disease.",

In an intention-to-treat analysis, 309 subjects in both the bisoprolol and nifedipine retard treated group provided at least a baseline and a second quality of life assessment (82%). An excess of symptoms was observed in the nifedipine group for oedema of the legs, nocturia, constipation, racing heart and heart thumping. Fewer patients reported wheeze in the nifedipine group. For quality of life, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups after 8 weeks. However, when analysing the results of the last available assessment (usually at 24 weeks) there were significant (P < 0.05) improvements in tension/anxiety, anger/ hostility, vigour/activity, and confusion/bewilderment, assessed by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) in patients receiving bisoprolol in comparison to those receiving nifedipine retard.

Intravenous glucose tolerance tests, euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamps and serum lipid measurements were performed after 8 and 48 weeks of active treatment. After 48 weeks insulin sensitivity was reduced by 23% by atenolol while it remained unchanged during trandolapril treatment (+0.5%, P = 0.0010 for difference between treatments, ANCOVA). The effect on triglycerides (+22% vs -8.5%) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-13% vs +0.7%) also differed significantly between atenolol and trandolapril. Results after 8 weeks were similar. Glucose tolerance was not affected by either drug. Atenolol reduced diastolic blood pressure (DBP) better than trandolapril (-15.3 mm Hg vs -6.6 mm Hg for supine DBP after 48 weeks, P = 0.012).

    "77": "We recently reported that the leptin-induced increase in uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) mRNA in brown adipose tissue (BAT) is prevented by the denervation of BAT. We also reported that retinoic acid (RA) increases UCP1 mRNA in BAT. To extend these finding to UCP2 and UCP3 in BAT, we examined UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA after unilateral denervation of BAT, as well as after leptin, beta(3)-adrenergic agonist, RA, and glucocorticoid administration to rats. UCP3 mRNA was 20% less in the denervated compared with the intact BAT, whereas UCP2 mRNA was unchanged with denervation. The beta(3)-adrenergic agonist, CGP-12177 (0.75 mg/kg), increased UPC3 mRNA by 40% in the innervated and by 85% in the denervated BAT. Leptin (0.9 mg/day for 3 days) increased both UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA by 30% in the innervated and, surprisingly, in the denervated BAT. RA (7.5 mg/kg) increased UCP1 mRNA but decreased UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA by 50%, whereas methylprednisolone (65 mg/kg, two doses 24 h apart) suppressed all three uncoupling proteins by greater than 60%. The present findings indicate that: sympathetic innervation is necessary to maintain basal levels of UCP3 mRNA; beta(3)-adrenergic agonist stimulation induces UCP3 mRNA; leptin induces UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA and this induction is not dependent on sympathetic innervation; RA increases UCP1 but decreases UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA; and methylprednisolone suppresses UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 mRNA equally. These data suggest that there are distinct patterns of regulation between UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3, and there may be at least two modes by which leptin could modulate thermogenesis in BAT; first, by increasing sympathetic stimulation of BAT and induction of UCP1 mRNA and, secondly, by increasing UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA by a mechanism independent of sympathetic stimulation.",

Skin permeability predicted at steady state did not reach therapeutic concentrations, which indicated the need for appropriate chemical penetration enhancers or vehicles to overcome limiting factors.

Further, the permeability rates of ten beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (acebutolol, alprenolol, atenolol, labetalol, metoprolol, oxprenolol, pindolol, propranolol, timolol and tertatolol) across the TR146 cell culture model and porcine buccal mucosa were related to their lipophilicity (logD(oct; 7.4)) and capacity factor (k') and to their polar water accessible surface area (PWASA). For water, mannitol, testosterone and some of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, the permeability enhancement across the TR146 cell culture model in the presence of sodium glycocholate (GC) was determined. The mannitol and testosterone permeability across the TR146 cell culture model could be related to the permeability across porcine and human buccal mucosa. The permeability of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists across the TR146 cell culture model varied between 2.2 x 10(-6) cm/s (atenolol) and 165 x 10(-6) cm/s (metoprolol). For propranolol the cellular permeability value (P(c)) was lower than expected, probably due to accumulation in the TR146 cell layers. Limited correlation of permeability with k' was observed both for the TR146 cell culture model and the porcine buccal mucosa, although the porcine permeability values were approximately 100 times less than the values determined with the TR146 cell culture model. The permeability values were also found to decrease with increasing PWASA. The PWASA value seemed to be more predictable for permeability than k'. The presence of 12.5 mM GC increased the permeability only for the hydrophilic atenolol, which may help explain the mechanism for GC-induced enhancement. The present results indicate that the TR146 cell culture model can be used as an in vitro model for permeability studies and mechanistic studies of human buccal drug delivery of drugs with different lipophilicity.", 
    "94": "Since carvedilol has been claimed to possess antioxidative effects, this drug might affect functional responses, including nitric oxide (NO) generation, of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and macrophages. When we assessed the effects of carvedilol on PMN responses in vitro, we observed that carvedilol dose dependently modulated generation of superoxide ions by NADPH oxidase when induced by the formylpeptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or the phorbol ester phorbol myristate acetate. This effect was not coupled to diminished phospholipase C activity. In contrast to the effect on NADPH oxidase, neither the fMLP-elicited NO generation by PMN nor the response of the murine macrophage cell line J774 to lipopolysaccharide was affected. There was no evidence from cell-free assay systems that carvedilol is a scavenger for superoxide ions or NO. Moreover, carvedilol did not affect other reactions dependent on NO, e.g. spontaneous or fMLP-stimulated PMN migration or lipoxin A(4)-, fMLP-, or A23187-induced neutrophil cytotoxicity for human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Thus, these effects point to the possibility that carvedilol modulates the NADPH oxidase of PMN but leaves the nitric oxide synthase of phagocytes intact.",

This study determines the influence of autonomic tone on the filtered QRS (f-QRS) duration from SAECG by using pharmacologic autonomic blockade and exercise in healthy volunteers. Eleven healthy male volunteers were studied. Three protocols were designed to study the effects of exercise (Ex) under control conditions, beta adrenergic blockade or double blockade. SAECGs and heart rate variability (LF and HF: low and high frequency power, LF/HF ratio) were determined from Holter recordings. Ex significantly decreased the f-QRS duration and HF and significantly increased heart rate and LF/HF. Ex during beta adrenergic blockade significantly increased heart rate and decreased f-QRS duration and HF, but did not change LF/HF. Ex during double blockade did not affect the f-QRS duration, HF, or LF/HF. The changes in f-QRS duration induced during Ex, autonomic blockade, or both were inversely correlated with changes in heart rate and LF/HF and positively correlated with changes in HF. These data suggest that f-QRS duration in healthy subjects is shortened by Ex with increased sympathetic tone or decreased parasympathetic tone or the combination.",

Group II (n = 7) and group III (n = 8) received, respectively, 100 and 200 mg amiodarone orally twice a day for 6 weeks to 8 months. In vivo studies were performed under halothane anesthesia 14 h after the last administration of amiodarone. Three leads ECG, femoral blood pressure and left ventricular intramural monophasic action potentials (MAP) were continuously recorded. Bradycardia was obtained by clamping the sinus node and beta-blockade and the heart was driven by atrial pacing.

Under anesthesia, the QT interval was 14% larger in group III compared to group I at a paced cycle length (PCL) of 1500 ms (P < 0.05). This is consistent with the 10% increase in endocardial MAP duration in group III at the same PCL (P < 0.05). There was no significant increase in transmural dispersion of MAP duration. In group I, sotalol induced a significant reverse use-dependent increase in MAP duration. This effect was reduced in group II and completely suppressed in group III. Amiodarone prevented the sotalol-induced increase in transmural dispersion of ventricular repolarization which was 69 +/- 12 ms in untreated dogs, 41 +/- 8 ms in group II (P < 0.05) and 34 +/- 8 ms (P < 0.05) in group III at PCL = 1500 ms. Amiodarone also prevented the sotalol-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

    "114": "Lists of banned classes of doping agents are released by the International Olympic Committee, adopted by other sports authorities and updated regularly, including the substance classes stimulants, narcotics, diuretics, anabolic agents, peptide hormones, beta-blockers etc. There are different classes of restriction: anabolic and masking agents (anabolic steroids, diuretics etc.) are always banned for athletes regardless of their topical activity (training or competition) several substances are permitted with certain restrictions (caffeine below a cut-off value, or inhalation of some beta 2 agonists) beta-blockers are prohibited in competitions of certain sports disciplines the majority of the substances (stimulants, narcotics etc.) is prohibited during competitions, so that they do not have to be analysed in out-of-competition samples. A differentiation between training and competition period is impossible by means of hair analysis due to the uncertainty of (especially short-term) kinetic considerations related to hair growth. Therefore, the analytical identification of doping relevant substances in hair is not always a sufficient criterion for a doping offence and the identification of stimulants, beta-blockers etc. in hair would be entirely irrelevant. The most interesting target substances are certainly the anabolic agents, because their desired action (enhanced muscle strength) lasts longer than the excretion, leading to sophisticated procedures to circumvent positive analytical results in competition control. Besides the analysis of out-of-competition control samples, the long term detection of steroids in hair could provide complementary information. An analytical approach to the identification of exogenous steroids in hair requires consideration of the presence of many other steroids in the hair matrix interfering the analysis at trace levels, and of a limited chemical stability. The analysis of endogenous steroids in hair appears to be even more complicated, because the possibility of many biotransformation reactions from (into) other precursors (metabolites) has to be taken into account. Precursor substances of anabolic steroids (especially esters as application forms) are very promising analytical targets of hair analysis, because they can only be detected after an exogenous intake. The quantitative evaluation of active parent compounds like testosterone (which is actively involved in physiological processes of hair growth) in hair is still controversial. Clinical applications under reproducible conditions can be useful, but the biovariability of these parameters will probably prevent the definition of acceptable cut-off levels as a criterion of abuse.", 
    "115": "In this research we examined the mechanisms by which ethanol (EtOH) inhibits luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) release from incubated medial basal hypothalamic explants. EtOH (100 mM) stimulated the release of two inhibitory neurotransmitters: gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and beta-endorphin. EtOH also inhibited NO production, indicative of a suppression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. This inhibition was reversed by naltroxone (10(-8) M), a micro-opioid receptor blocker, indicating that the inhibition of NOS by EtOH is mediated by beta-endorphin. EtOH also blocked N-methyl-d-aspartic acid-induced LHRH release, but the blockade could not be reversed by either the GABA receptor blocker, bicuculline (10(-5) M), naltroxone (10(-8) M), or both inhibitors added together. However, increasing the concentration of naltrexone (10(-6) M) but not bicuculline (10(-4) M) reversed the inhibition. When we lowered the concentration of EtOH (50 mM), the EtOH-induced blockade of LHRH release could be reversed by either bicuculline (10(-5) M), naltroxone (10(-8) M), or the combination of the two blockers. Therefore, GABA is partially responsible for the blockade of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid-induced LHRH release. The block by GABA was exerted by inhibiting the activation of cyclooxygenase by NO, because it was reversed by prostaglandin E(2), the product of activation of cyclooxygenase. Because the inhibition caused by the higher concentration of EtOH could not be reduced by bicuculline (10(-4) M) but was blocked by naltroxone (10(-6) M), the action of alcohol can be accounted for by stimulation of beta-endorphin neurons that inhibit LHRH release by inhibition of activation of NOS and stimulation of GABA release.", 
    "116": "Cardiac sympathetic activation is one of the major and earlier changes observed in patients with heart failure.

These studies have involved almost 10,000 patients to date and have consistently shown that the long-term administration of beta-blockers is associated with a highly significant improvement in both left ventricular function and prognosis of the patients with heart failure. The evidence supporting the use of beta-blockers now equals or even surpasses that of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; therefore beta-blockers should be considered part of standard therapy. Issues that remain unclarified include the mechanisms through which beta-blockers may improve cardiac function and their tolerability and efficacy in specific groups of patients (such as those with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, severe heart failure, the elderly, or those with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction). It is not currently clear whether the pharmacologic differences between individual beta-blockers are clinically relevant. If they are, the potential for even greater benefit with certain agents exists. It is hoped that these issues will be clarified by the results of ongoing multicenter trials.",

In 7 of 12 comparisons of a beta-blocker with placebo, the beta-blocker was efficacious for control of resting heart rate, with evidence that the effect is drug specific, as nadolol and atenolol proved to be most efficacious. All 9 comparisons demonstrated good heart rate control with beta-blockers during exercise, although exercise tolerance was compromised in 3 of 9 comparisons.

The action of mibefradil on Ca(2+) channels is use- and steady-state-dependent and the binding site of mibefradil on L-type Ca(2+) channels is different from that of dihydropyridines. By using conventional whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp techniques, we showed that mibefradil has an inhibitory effect on both T- and L-type Ca(2+) currents in insulin-secreting cells. However, the effect on L-type Ca(2+) currents was time-dependent and poorly reversible in perforated patch-clamp experiments. By using mass spectrometry, we demonstrated that mibefradil accumulates inside cells, and furthermore, a metabolite of mibefradil was detected. Intracellular application of this metabolite selectively blocked the L-type Ca(2+) current, whereas mibefradil exerted no effect. This study demonstrates that mibefradil permeates into cells and is hydrolyzed to a metabolite that blocks L-type Ca(2+) channels specifically by acting at the inner side of the channel.",

Preliminary clinical studies have reported different phenotypic electrocardiographic patterns and different sensitivity to pacing or pharmacological therapy for each genotype. A transmural electrocardiogram and transmembrane action potentials from epicardial, M, and endocardial cells were simultaneously recorded from an arterially perfused wedge of canine left ventricle. Isoproterenol (100 nmol/L) in the presence of chromanol 293B (30 micromol/L), an I(Ks) blocker (LQT1 model), produced a preferential prolongation of M-cell action potential duration (APD), resulting in an increase in transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) and a broad-based T wave, as commonly seen in LQT1 patients. D-Sotalol (100 micromol/L), an I(Kr) blocker (LQT2 model), and ATX-II (20 nmol/L), an agent that augments late I(Na) (LQT3 model), also produced a preferential prolongation of M-cell APD, an increase in TDR, and low-amplitude T wave with a bifurcated appearance (LQT2), and late-appearing T wave (LQT3), respectively. APD-, QT-, and TDR-rate relations were much steeper in the LQT3 model than in either the LQT1 or LQT2 model, whereas the rate relations in the LQT1 and LQT2 models were both steeper than those under control conditions. Spontaneous and programmed electrical stimulation-induced torsade de pointes (TdP) were observed in all 3 models. Propranolol (1 micromol/L), a beta blocker, completely prevented the effect of isoproterenol to persistently or transiently increase TDR and to induce TdP in the LQT1 and LQT2 models, but facilitated TdP in the LQT3 model. Mexiletine, a class IB Na+ channel blocker, dose-dependently (2-20 micromol/L) abbreviated the QT and APD more in the LQT3 model, but decreased TDR and suppressed TdP in the 3 models.",

Bivariate analysis showed a significant correlation of hemoglobin A1c with neuropathy but not with patient age, duration of diabetes, alpha-blockers, beta-blockers or diuretics.

    "137": "The interrelationship between thyroid hormones and aldosterone has been examined in the regulation of rat colonic amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport which translocates Na+ through apical amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels and basolateral Na+, K+-ATPase. Electrogenic Na+ transport was measured in an Ussing chamber by the short-circuit current and identified by Na+ channel blocker amiloride. Na+-pumping activity of the basolateral Na+,K+-ATPase was investigated in nystatin-treated epithelium by measuring the equivalent short-circuit current after addition of mucosal Na+. The abundance of mRNA coding for alpha, beta and gamma subunits of the Na+ channel (rENaC) was estimated using Northern blot analysis. Hyperaldosteronism was induced by a low-salt diet and hypothyroidism by methimazole. The low-Na+ diet induced electrogenic Na+ transport in euthyroid rats but its effect was almost completely inhibited in hypothyroid animals even if the plasma concentration of aldosterone was high enough to stimulate this transport pathway both in euthyroid and hypothyroid rats. A kinetic study of the basolateral Na+,K+-ATPase revealed a decrease of Na+ transport capacity in hypothyroid rats kept on the low-Na+ diet in comparison with euthyroid animals fed the same diet. No significant differences in steady-state levels of alpha, beta and gamma rENaC mRNA were detected between euthyroid and hypothyroid rats. These data suggest that hypothyroidism decreases the efficacy of the basolateral Na+ pump but fails to inhibit it completely even though it inhibits the transepithelial electrogenic Na+ transport in response to aldosterone. We conclude that the permissive effect of thyroid hormones on the induction of electrogenic Na+ transport by aldosterone is localised beyond the transcriptional step of Na+ channel regulation.",

    "143": "Hypertension and ischemic heart disease are important precursors of heart failure. The prevention of progression to heart failure is a prime objective when treating patients with hypertension or ischemic heart disease. In patients with hypertension, treatment with either diuretics or beta-blockers reduces the risk of chronic heart failure. In patients with ischemic heart disease, beta-blocker therapy reduces the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and ensuing cardiac dysfunction. The beneficial effects of beta-blocker therapy may be greater in post-infarction patients who have impaired left ventricular function than in those patients without such impairment. When considering heart failure itself, the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been demonstrated in patients with mild-to-severe left ventricular dysfunction and their use is indicated for all stages of heart failure to reduce symptoms and retard further impairment of left ventricular function. Diuretics and digitalis offer relief from the symptoms of the disease, while positive inotropes are reserved for parenteral administration in end-stage heart failure, as a bridge to transplantation, or in acute exacerbations of the disease. Added to standard therapy, beta-blockade is of value in the treatment of heart failure, preventing further deterioration and improving hemodynamics, exercise tolerance, quality of life, and longterm prognosis.", 
    "144": "Activation of beta1-, beta2-, beta 3- and putative beta4-adrenoceptors modifies cardiac function. These receptors are usually coupled to Gs protein, but beta2- and beta3-adrenoceptors could also couple to Gi/o proteins. The mouse heart is used increasingly for studies of genetically disrupted or overexpressed proteins, including beta-adrenoceptor subtypes. We therefore investigated in contracting mouse left atria (2 Hz, 37 degrees C) if inactivation of Gi/o proteins with pertussis toxin modifies or uncovers effects mediated through beta-adrenoceptor subtypes. The negative inotropic effects of carbachol in atria exposed to catecholamine or high calcium (6.8 mmol/l) were assumed to be mediated through activation of muscarinic receptors coupled to Gi/o. We report conditions under which incubation of left atria with 200 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 24 h nearly abolished the carbachol responses. Although it has been reported that muscarinic receptor-mediated cardiodepression has an obligatory contribution of nitric oxide, the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (0.1-1 mmol/l) did not modify the negative inotropic effects of carbachol, inconsistent with an involvement of nitric oxide. The positive inotropic effects of (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline, mediated through beta1-adrenoceptors, were not affected by pertussis toxin. (-)-Adrenaline did not cause positive inotropic effects attributable to beta2-adrenoceptor-mediation, in the presence of CGP 20712A (300 nmol/l) to block beta1-adrenoceptors, in control atria or atria pretreated with pertussis toxin. The positive inotropic effects of (-)-CGP 12177 (1 micromol/l), a compound with agonist activity at the putative beta4-adrenoceptor, were unaffected by pertussis toxin. The beta3-adrenoceptor-selective agonist BRL 37344 (1 micromol/l), in the presence of (-)-propranolol (200 nmol/l), did not cause positive or negative inotropic effects in control and pertussis toxin-treated atria. In left atria obtained from mice injected with 150 microg/kg i.p. pertussis toxin which abolished carbachol-evoked cardiode-pression, the positive inotropic effects of (-)-adrenaline were antagonised by CGP 20712A. The beta2-adrenoceptor-selective antagonist ICI 118551 (50 nmol/l) did not cause additional blockade of the effects of high (-)-adrenaline concentrations in the presence of CGP 20712A, ruling out the involvement of beta2-adrenoceptors. The results with intraparenteral PTX validate our in vitro PTX method. We conclude that inhibition of murine Gi/o proteins does not alter atrial positive inotropic effects mediated through beta1- and putative beta4-adrenoceptors and does not reveal functional beta2- and beta3-adrenoceptors.", 
    "145": "This multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group study was designed to assess the efficacy and the safety of fixed low dose combination perindopril 2 mg/indapamide 0.625 mg (Per/Ind) versus atenolol 50 mg (Ate). After a 4-week placebo run-in, 446 hypertensive patients (mean age : 55.8 +/- 11.0 years) were randomised to receive Per/Ind or Ate for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measures were the changes in trough supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure (sSBP, sDBP) between baseline and the last observation. Equivalence was assessed in an intention-to-treat analysis using a two one-sided tests procedure. Per/Ind and Ate decreased sSBP by -20.5 mmHg and -20.1 mmHg, respectively; the 90% confidence interval [-2.3; 1.5] of the intertreatment difference (-0.4 mmHg) fell within the predefined equivalence interval [-8; +8 mmHg]. Similarly, the sDBP decreased by -15.1 mmHg (Per/Ind) and -16.2 mmHg (Ate) with an intertreatment difference of 1.1 mmHg whose 90% confidence interval [-0.1; 2.2 mmHg] fell within the predefined equivalence interval [-4; +4 mmHg]; thus antihypertensive efficacy of Per/Ind and Ate were equivalent (P <0.001). In patients older than 65, Per/Ind induces a statistically greater decrease in sSBP than Ate (P <0.05). Per/Ind was well tolerated. Further controlled studies are needed to confirm these results on a long-term period.", 
    "146": "The product of the LPP1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a membrane-associated enzyme that catalyzes the Mg(2+)-independent dephosphorylation of phosphatidate (PA), diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP), and lysophosphatidate (LPA). The LPP1-encoded lipid phosphatase was overexpressed 681-fold in Sf-9 insect cells and used to examine the enzymological properties of the enzyme using PA, DGPP, and LPA as substrates. The optimum pH values for PA phosphatase, DGPP phosphatase, and LPA phosphatase activities were 7. 5, 7.0, and 7.0, respectively. Divalent cations (Mn(2+), Co(2+), and Ca(2+)), NaF, heavy metals, propranolol, phenylglyoxal, and N-ethylmaleimide inhibited the PA phosphatase, DGPP phosphatase, and LPA phosphatase activities of the enzyme. The inhibitory effects of N-ethylmaleimide and phenylglyoxal on the LPP1-encoded enzyme were novel properties when compared with other Mg(2+)-independent lipid phosphate phosphatases from S. cerevisiae and mammalian cells. The LPP1-encoded enzyme exhibited saturation kinetics with respect to the surface concentrations of PA (K(m)=0.05 mol%), DGPP (K(m)=0.07 mol%), and LPA (K(m)=0.08 mol%). Based on specificity constants (V(max)/K(m)LPA (1.3 units/mg/mol%). DGPP (K(i)=0.12 mol%) was a competitive inhibitor with respect to PA, and PA (K(i)=0.12 mol%) was a competitive inhibitor with respect to DGPP. This suggested that the binding sites for these substrates were the same. The enzymological properties of the LPP1-encoded enzyme differed significantly from those of the S. cerevisiae DPP1-encoded lipid phosphatase, a related enzyme that also utilizes PA, DGPP, and LPA as substrates.",

In a second group of normal volunteers (n = 11), nipradilol (0.125% and 0.25%) and timolol (0. 5%) were compared for IOP lowering effects. After a single administration of 0.25% nipradilol, IOP, flare intensity in the anterior chamber, aqueous flow, uveoscleral outflow, tonographic outflow facility, and episcleral venous pressure were either directly measured or mathematically calculated. Topical nipradilol (0.25%) was administered to 24 patients with ocular hypertension twice daily for 8 weeks.",

A single instillation of both 0.25% nipradilol and 0.5% timolol reduced the IOP in normotensive human subjects to the same degree. A single instillation of 0.25% nipradilol decreased the aqueous flow rate in the treated eye by 20%. Nipradilol produced no significant effect in tonographic outflow facility or episcleral venous pressure, but uveoscleral outflow was increased. In patients with ocular hypertension, twice daily instillation of 0.25% nipradilol decreased IOP without tachyphylaxis for the 8 week test period.",

    "151": "ABSTRACT: Thirty-one million patients in the United States undergo surgical procedures every year. Approximately 10%-the majority of these with hypertension-are at an increased risk for perioperative and postoperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thus, hypertensive patients requiring surgery, especially the 2.1 million undergoing noncardiac procedures, should be evaluated carefully for the magnitude, and if severe, the cause of the hypertension. Additionally, their associated metabolic and cardiovascular status should be characterized and corrected with aggressive therapy. Hypertensive patients with known ischemic heart disease, those with multiple risk factors for ischemic heart disease (IHD), some with valvular heart disease, and those with congestive heart failure should be evaluated for their ability to perform the physical and social activities of everyday life, and, when necessary, have formal stress testing. Most studies suggest that blood pressures of 180/110 mm Hg or greater are associated with a greater risk for perioperative ischemic events. Therefore, the goals of blood pressure control should be to reduce the blood pressure without jeopardizing organ function. Antihypertensive medication should be administered until the time of surgery. beta-Receptor blockers should be instituted or continued in patients with angina and in some patients with congestive heart failure. Those without prior antihypertensive therapy might be best treated with beta-blocker therapy perioperatively as evidenced by the Multicenter Study of Perioperative Research Group with atenolol and those earlier studies with metoprolol. The risks of the surgery should be discussed with the patient so the risks can be weighed against the expected benefit. Studies suggest that perioperative risk for any patient, and especially patients with hypertension, are in part related to the adrenergic arousal before, during, and after the procedure as evidenced by the rise in heart rate and blood pressure, along with the liberation of clotting facators and increased risk for plaque rupture, coronary vasoplasm, and consequent myocardial infarction and fibrosis.", 
    "152": "The effects on the responses to coronary artery occlusion of a combined ACE/NEP inhibitor (Z13752A) were examined in anaesthetized dogs. A 1 h infusion of Z13752A (128 microgram kg(-1) min(-1) intravenously) decreased arterial blood pressure (by 11+/-3%; P<0. 05) and increased coronary blood flow (by 12+/-4%, P<0.05). There were no other significant haemodynamic changes. Z13752A inhibited both NEP and ACE enzymes both in dog plasma and in tissue (lung ACE; kidney NEP). Pressor responses to angiotensin I in vivo were inhibited and systemic vasodilator responses to bradykinin were potentiated. When the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 25 min, Z13752A markedly reduced the severity of the resultant ventricular arrhythmias. No ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurred (compared to 7/16 in the controls; P<0.05), and ventricular tachycardia (VT) was reduced (VT in 2/9 dogs treated with Z13752A cp. 16/16 of controls; episodes of VT 0.2+/-0.1 c.p. 10.7+/-3.3; P<0. 05). Reperfusion of the ischaemic myocardium led to VF in all control dogs but occurred less frequently in dogs given Z13752A (survival from the combined ischaemia-reperfusion insult 67% c.p. 0% in controls; P<0.05). Z13752A reduced two other indices of ischaemia severity; epicardial ST-segment elevation and inhomogeneity of electrical activation. These protective effects of Z13752A during ischaemia and reperfusion were abolished by the administration of icatibant (0.3 mg kg(-1), i.v.) a selective antagonist of bradykinin at B(2) receptors; the ischaemic changes in dogs given both icatibant and Z13752A were similar to those in the controls. We conclude that this ACE/NEP inhibitor is effective at reducing the consequences of coronary artery occlusion in this canine model and that this protection is primarily due to potentiation of released bradykinin.

    "153": "beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation was investigated in ring preparations of rat isolated thoracic aorta. Rings were pre-constricted with a sub-maximal concentration of noradrenaline (1 microM) and relaxant responses to cumulative concentrations of beta-adrenoceptor agonists obtained. The concentration-response curve (CRC) to isoprenaline was shifted to the right by propranolol (0.3 microM) with a steepening of the slope. Estimation of the magnitude of the shift from EC(50) values gave a pA(2) of 7.6. Selective beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists, CGP 20712A (0.1 microM) and ICI 118551 (0.1 microM), respectively, produced 4 and 14 fold shifts of the isoprenaline CRC. Atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonists also produced concentration-dependent relaxation of aortic rings. The order of potency of the beta-adrenoceptor agonists was (-log EC(50)): isoprenaline (6. 25)>cyanopindolol (5.59)>isoprenaline+propranolol (5.11)>CGP 12177A (4.40)>ZD 2079 (4.24)>ZM 215001 (4.07)>BRL 37344 (3.89). Relaxation to CGP 12177A and ZM 215001 was unaffected by propranolol (0.3 microM). SR 59230A (</=1 microM) and cyanopindolol (1 microM), beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonists, had no effect on the isoprenaline (in the presence of propranolol) or CGP 12177A CRCs. Bupranolol and CGP 20712A, at microM concentrations (beta(4)-adrenceptor antagonists), inhibited responses to isoprenaline (in the presence of propranolol) and CGP 12177A. In conclusion, atypical beta-adrenoceptors co-exist with beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors in rat aorta. Although non-conventional partial agonists and selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist cause relaxation, the vascular atypical beta-adrenoceptor does not appear to correspond to the beta(3)-adrenoceptor. There are, however, similarities with the putative beta(4)-adrenoceptor.",

    "156": "An 18-month, multicenter, double-masked, parallel, controlled study was conducted. Patients were randomized to brinzolamide two or three times daily or timolol 0.5% twice daily in a 2:2:1 ratio (n = 150, 153, and 75, respectively). Intraocular pressure was measured at 8:00 AM at eligibility and months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18. Efficacy was based on intraocular pressure reduction from baseline. Safety was also evaluated.", 
    "157": "All regimens produced clinically relevant and statistically significant (P<.05) intraocular pressure reductions from baseline. Mean changes in intraocular pressure trough measurements ranged from -2.7 to -3.9 mm Hg with brinzolamide twice-daily dosing and -2.8 to -3.8 mm Hg three times daily dosing compared with -4.7 to -5.6 mm Hg with timolol. The intraocular pressure reductions with brinzolamide two and three times daily were clinically and statistically equivalent. One hundred forty-four patients were discontinued from the study after randomization with the most common reasons being the occurrence of an adverse event (46), inadequate intraocular pressure control (23), patient decision unrelated to study medication (11), lost to follow-up (16), and noncompliance (9). Adverse events were nonserious and resolved without sequelae. There were no clinically relevant changes in safety parameters. Brinzolamide produced less ocular discomfort (burning/stinging) than timolol, and total carbonic anhydrase inhibition levels remained below that known to cause systemic side effects.",

    "159": "The relation between serotonin release and electrical activity was examined in the nucleus raphe magnus of rats anesthetized with pentobarbital. Serotonin levels were monitored through a carbon-fiber microelectrode by fast cyclic voltammetry (usually at 1 Hz). Single-cell firing was recorded through the same microelectrode, except during the voltammetry waveform and associated electrical artifact (totaling about 30 ms). Multi-barrel micropipettes incorporating the voltammetry electrode were used for iontophoresis of drugs. Cells were inhibited, excited or unaffected by noxious mechanical skin stimulation. These were respectively designated as off(M) cells, on(M) cells and neutral(M) cells, M denoting mechanical. During 3 min of pinching, serotonin slowly rose near seven of 14 on(M) cells and 26 of 46 off(M) cells; it fell near two off(M) cells; it was unchanged near all other cells, including six neutral(M) cells. On a finer spatiotemporal scale, near four of seven on(M) cells, 10 of 14 off(M) cells and 0 of four neutral(M) cells, average serotonin levels fell significantly within +/- 100 ms of spontaneous spikes. Lower serotonin may have caused the higher spike probability; the converse is theoretically unlikely, since delays between release and detection are estimated to exceed 100 ms. Increased serotonin and decreased firing were always seen following iontophoresis or intravenous injection (1 mg/kg) of the serotonin re-uptake inhibitor clomipramine (n = 7). Iontophoresis of +/- propranolol, whose serotonergic actions include antagonism and partial agonism at 5-HT1 receptors, also increased serotonin and decreased firing (n=4). Methiothepin (intravenous, 1 mg/kg), whose serotonergic actions include 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 antagonism, typically raised serotonin levels (four of five cells) and always blocked inhibition by clomipramine (n = 3). Iontophoresis of glutamate always lowered serotonin and increased firing (n = 4). Since serotonin levels and firing were usually inversely correlated, except near on(M) cells during pinch, we propose that serotonin is released from terminals of incoming nociceptive afferents. Prior neuroanatomical knowledge favors a midbrain origin for these afferents, while some of the drug findings suggest that their terminals possess inhibitory serotonergic autoreceptors, possibly of 5-HT1b subtype. The released serotonin could contribute to the inhibition of off(M) cells and excitation of on(M) cells by noxious stimulation, since inhibitory 5-HT1a receptors and excitatory 5-HT2 receptors, respectively, have previously been shown to dominate their serotonergic responses.", 
    "160": "To investigate the alterations of plasma endothelin-1(ET-1) in patients with congestive heart failure(CHF) and the effects of metoprolol on it, plasma ET-1 and norepinephrine(NE) were measured in 43 patients using radioimmunoassay and high-performance liquid chromatography methods. Twenty-four patients were treated with metoprolol plus the routine therapy while the others were received the routine therapy only. The findings were that levels of plasma ET-1 and NE increased before the treatment, and decreased after the treatment with metoprolol for 1 month. There was no alteration of plasma ET-1 or NE in the control group.", 
    "161": "The hydrophobic human beta 2 adrenergic receptor was produced in fusion to the hydrophilic maltose-binding protein (MalE) in Escherichia coli. Photoaffinity labeling with the adrenergic ligand [125I]cyanopindolole-diazirine indicated that the majority of the protein was proteolyzed in the intergenic region between the fusion partners after production in E. coli. The simple and fast genetics of the bacterium enabled us to engineer a linker with an increased proteolytic stability. The fusion protein produced in E. coli was fully functional with respect to binding of adrenergic ligands and coupling to stimulatory GTP-binding protein. The production level with 3 pmol receptor fusion protein per mg membrane protein in a crude membrane preparation was significantly higher than those reported for other beta 2 adrenergic receptor constructs in E. coli. After solubilization with dodecanoyl sucrose, the fusion protein was purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography on immobilized Ni2+ ions (binding to a C-terminal His6-tag) and on crosslinked amylose (binding to the MalE). In order to achieve higher production levels, the fusion protein preceded by an insect signal peptide was produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells. As expected, the production level with about 17 pmol receptor per mg membrane protein was higher in the insect cells than in E. coli. The receptor fusion protein produced in the insect cells bound adrenergic ligands and activated heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins with biochemical properties comparable to that of the unfused receptor.", 
    "162": "Hypertension is the most common reason for physician office visits. An estimated 43 to 50 million people in the United States have elevated blood pressure (BP). The prevalence of hypertension varies from a small percentage among individuals in their teens and 20s to more than 70% of the elderly (those > 75 years of age). The US Public Health Services (USPHS) has set a goal of having 50% of individuals with hypertension \"under control\"--that is, reducing their BP to < 140 mm Hg systolic and < 90 mm Hg diastolic--by the year 2000. Current information suggests that we will fall far short of reaching that goal. In the early 1990s, such levels had been achieved by only 27% of hypertensive Americans 18 to 74 years old and by only 20% of those > 75 years old. Is this a cause for concern? Is the goal defined by the USPHS justified? Should we push even harder to reach that goal, should we strive to do even better, or should we be satisfied? Since we are now in the era of evidence-based medicine, the only way to answer these questions is to review what we have learned from the many large, prospective, well-controlled, long-term clinical trials that have addressed these questions over the past 3 decades.", 
    "163": "General recommendations from US and international organizations indicate that an ideal approach to the therapy of hypertension should begin with lifestyle modifications, such as decreased salt and fat intake and a careful aerobic exercise program, with the therapeutic goal of a blood pressure (BP) < 140/90 mm Hg. The most recent guidelines recommend more rigorous targets for BP lowering in high-risk populations, such as those with hypertension and concomitant diabetes and/or renal disease with proteinuria. This chapter addresses hypertension in patients with diabetes as an example of a group at especially high risk. It reviews recent clinical trials that support more rigorous BP goals in such patients to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and considers the importance of combination therapy in achieving these goals.", 
    "164": "Migraine is one of the most common and misunderstood disease encountered in general medical practice. An estimated 23 million Americans suffer disabling migraines, yet only a minority are diagnosed (1,2). An even smaller percentage receive optimal care. Migraine extracts a significant personal, psychologic, social, and economic toll from migraineurs and their families. An estimated 150 million workdays are lost annually due to headache at an estimated cost of $6 to $17 billion (3,4). Recent advances in understanding of the pathophysiology and acute therapy provide the potential to markedly reduce the impact of migraine. Available abortive medications have efficacy rates as high as 80%, but only a minority of afflicted patients currently receive these therapies. While reducing headache pain, they also restore function, enabling an individual to return to work, family, and personal commitments (5). Future progress in migraine management resides in early identification and optimization of migraine treatment. This article focuses on diagnosis and treatment."
