Under selected experimental conditions, the consumption of oxygen by the mitochondria of the cardiac muscle in states S3 and S4, rate of production of energy by mitochondria (OPR), coefficient of oxidative phosphorylyzation (ADP:O), respiratory control index (RCI) as well as the effect on the specific activity of the cytochromoxidase marker of mitochondria (COX) were examined. It follows from the obtained results that in contrast to large doses of isoprenaline (10-50 mg.kg-1) producing necrosis and affecting metabolic processes, small doses of isoprenaline (2 mg.kg-1) in many parameters activate the bioenergetic activity of the cardiac mitochondria, which is only minimally changed in combination with the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker (FoA33).", 
    "1": "As the human cardiomyocyte expresses both beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors it is to be expected that the inhibition of one species of receptors can be counteracted by the other. This hypothesis was tested in 40 middle-aged men scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery. Half the patients had been treated with cardioselective beta 1 antagonists for more than three months while the 20 control patients had never been beta-blocked. The haemodynamic status after induction of a standardized fentanyl/midazolam anaesthesia and the sensitivity of the cardiovascular beta-adrenoceptors to isoprenaline titration were similar in both groups. In conclusion, patients chronically treated with cardioselective beta 1-blockers compensate for the perturbation to such a degree that their cardiovascular function is indistinguishable from patients who have never received beta-blockers.", 
    "2": "Although there is no known cure for essential tremor or Parkinson's disease (PD), medical treatment can often significantly reduce or eliminate functional disability. Mild essential tremor does not require treatment, and early treatment does not arrest or slow the natural progression in symptoms. When essential tremor interferes with daily activities, medical treatment options include beta blockers, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Because of the great variability in the presentation of PD, no single approach is appropriate for all patients. Levodopa is the mainstay of pharmacologic therapy for PD, although other agents are indicated for monotherapy or in combination with levodopa. These include traditional and newer dopamine agonists, amantadine, anticholinergics, selegiline, and an emerging class of agents called COMT inhibitors.", 
    "3": "Ocular perfusion is a critical factor in ischemic ocular diseases, and blood flow in the ophthalmic artery has a pronounced effect on perfusion. To evaluate the effects of dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist on ocular perfusion, we investigated the short-term effects of single oral doses of nicardipine (40 mg) and propranolol (40 mg) on the blood flow velocity in the ophthalmic artery, intraocular pressure (IOP), systemic blood pressure, and heart rate in nine healthy Japanese male volunteers in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study using color Doppler imaging. Parameters were evaluated before and 60 and 120 minutes after administration. Nicardipine significantly increased the maximum systolic velocity and time-averaged blood flow velocity compared with placebo without significant increase in the resistance index. Propranolol had no significant effects on Doppler parameters. Propranolol exhibited a great reduction in IOP from placebo values. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were significantly reduced by propranolol. Nicardipine significantly increased heart rate. These results suggest that nicardipine increased ophthalmic blood flow, but propranolol did not.", 
    "4": "This review discusses the circadian phase dependency in the anti-anginal effects and in the pharmacokinetics of drugs used in the treatment of coronary heart diseased patients. beta-receptor blocking agents seem mainly to reduce ischaemic events during daytime hours and are of therapeutic value in the morning hours which are the hours of high cardiovascular risk. Calcium channel blockers seem to be less effective in reducing ischaemic event during the night and early morning. However, the galenic formulation and the type of calcium channel blocker may play an important role. Whereas the effects of the anti-ischaemic properties of oral nitrates are well established, their influence of the circadian organization of cardiovascular events needs to be clarified. Only limited data are available concerning the circadian phase dependency in the dose-response relationship of anti-anginal drugs. Such data would be valuable for a better understanding of the need of a time-specified drug treatment which is based on the circadian phase dependency of cardiovascular events such as coronary infarction and angina pectoris attacks.", 
    "5": "A series of delta 2-isoxazoline derivatives structurally related to Broxaterol 1 and Falintolol 3 has been prepared and evaluated for their binding affinity to beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Among the tested compounds only the 3-isopropenyl anti derivative 4d is as active as the reference compounds. An electron-releasing group, probably operating through a pi-pi interaction, in the 3-position of the isoxazoline nucleus greatly enhances the affinity of the compounds. Conversely, the closest analogs of Broxaterol (3-bromo delta 2-isoxazolines 4a and 5a) are at least one order of magnitude less active than the model compound 1. Throughout the series of derivatives the anti stereoisomers are invariably more active than their syn counterparts.", 
    "6": "1. The reflex changes in the inotropic state of the left ventricle, measured as the dP/dt max (maximum rate of change of pressure), occurring in response to selective stimulation of the carotid and aortic body chemoreceptors by sodium cyanide, were studied in the cat anaesthetized with a mixture of chloralose and urethane. 2. The animals were artificially ventilated with an open pneumothorax. The heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were maintained constant. 3. With on-going central respiratory activity, stimulation of the carotid bodies caused an increase in respiratory movements. Variable changes in left ventricular dP/dt max occurred, the predominant response being an increase. The mean change was 8.3 +/- 2.9 % from a control value of 6850 +/- 450 mmHg s-1. Stimulation of the aortic bodies resulted in a smaller increase in respiration or no effect, but a significant increase occurred in left ventricular dP/dt max of 19.6 +/- 2.9 % from a control value of 6136 +/- 228 mmHg s-1. No significant changes in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure occurred in response to stimulation of either group of chemoreceptors. 4. Tests of chemoreceptor stimulations were repeated during temporary suppression of the secondary respiratory mechanisms: the central respiratory drive was suppressed reflexly by electrical stimulation of the central cut ends of both superior laryngeal nerves and lung stretch afferent activity was minimized by stopping artificial respiration. Carotid body stimulation again evoked variable responses, the predominant now being a reduction in left ventricular dP/dt max of 3.1 % from a control value of 5720 +/- 320 mmHg s-1, which was significantly different to that occurring during on-going spontaneous respiration. Aortic body stimulation caused an increase in left ventricular dP/dt max similar to the response during on-going spontaneous respiration. 5. The positive inotropic responses were mediated via the sympathetic nervous system, as indicated by their abolition as a result of intravenous injections of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, propranolol. 6. It is concluded that the carotid bodies exert a small variable effect on left ventricular dP/dt max, the predominant positive inotropic response being due to the concomitant neurogenic effects of the increase in respiration. In contrast, the positive inotropic response to excitation of the aortic chemoreceptors is not respiratory modulated.", 
    "7": "The effects of cyclopiazonic acid and thapsigargin, selective inhibitors of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump, on the platelet aggregation were investigated using washed rat platelets prepared by chromatography on Sepharose 2B columns. In Ca2+-free medium, cyclopiazonic acid and thapsigargin did not induce aggregation, but in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+, platelet aggregation was induced in a concentration-dependent manner. Cyclopiazonic acid- and thapsigargin-induced platelet aggregation was blocked by 1 mM Ni2+ but not by 100 microM indomethacin or 1 microM nifedipine. In aequorin-loaded platelets, cyclopiazonic acid and thapsigargin caused sustained elevation of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, an effect which was blocked by Ni2+, a non-selective Ca2+ channel blocker and SK&F 96365 (1-[beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenyl]-1H-imidazole hydrochloride), a putative receptor-operated Ca2+ channel antagonist. The above results indicated that both cyclopiazonic acid and thapsigargin induced platelet aggregation and elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, that extracellular Ca2+ was essential for cyclopiazonic acid- and thapsigargin-induced platelet aggregation, and that platelet aggregation may be associated with Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ store-activated Ca2+ channels.", 
    "8": "A 55-year-old man was admitted following an overdose of sustained-release verapamil (calcium channel blocker) and ordinary-release atenolol (beta-1 blocker). At admission, there was extreme bradycardia (20-25 beats min-1) and hypotension (systolic arterial pressure 40-50 mm Hg). To counteract the cardiovascular depression, prenalterol, dopamine, dobutamine, isoprenaline, adrenaline and noradrenaline were used. A satisfactory state was obtained with adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine infused at high rates. Cardiac output was then more than 101 min-1, with a very low total peripheral resistance. The infusion of the adrenergic agonists could be interrupted on day 3. Prolonged ventilator treatment was necessary but the patient recovered without sequelae. Treatment options for similar cases are outlined.", 
    "9": "Postmyocardial infarction (MI) survival has been steadily improving. This improvement has been due, in part, to the actions of the adjunctive medical therapies for the treatment of MI. Aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and lipid-lowering agents have been shown to improve survival in the treatment and secondary prevention of MI. Nitrates have beneficial effects as well. These medications complement the reperfusion strategies through different mechanisms. Other adjunctive medical therapies, namely magnesium, antiarrhythmic agents, and calcium-channel blockers, have not been shown to improve mortality with routine post-MI use despite their theoretical benefits.", 
    "10": "Over the last few years, Pichia pastoris has been developed into a powerful expression system for a multitude of foreign genes. Here, we demonstrate that the P. pastoris expression system has similar power to the baculovirus expression system in high-level production of two G-protein-coupled receptors, the mouse 5HT5A 5-hydroxtryptamine receptor and the human beta2-adrenergic receptor. Different expression plasmids were constructed in which the cDNAs of the two receptors were cloned under the transcriptional control of the highly inducible promoter of the P. pastoris alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) gene. In three expression plasmids, the receptors were fused to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor prepropeptide and also to the c-myc tag or the FLAG tag to permit immunological detection of the receptors. After transformation into P. pastoris strains KM71 and SMD 1163, recombinant clones were selected and tested for the production of the 5HT5A receptor and the beta2-adrenergic receptor by radioligand binding using [N-methyl-3H]lysergic acid diethylamide and [5,7-3H](-)CGP-12177 respectively. The production level of the 5HT5A receptor was improved by a factor of three by fusion with the alpha-factor prepropeptide. Also, the higher gene dosage resulting from multiple insertions of the expression cassette led to an improvement in production by a factor of two for both receptors. The addition of the adrenergic antagonist alprenolol to the culture medium had a positive effect on the number of specific binding sites detectable in clones producing the beta2-adrenergic receptor. For the 5HT5A receptor the addition of yohimbine resulted in a similar but smaller effect. Binding assays revealed that approx. 25 pmol of beta2-adrenergic receptor and approx. 40 pmol of 5HT5A receptor per mg of membrane protein in crude membrane preparations were produced. The pharmacological profiles for the heterologously produced receptors, estimated by ligand-displacement analysis using certain adrenergic and serotoninergic agonists and antagonists, were comparable with those reported for the receptors expressed in mammalian systems. Immunoblot analysis of the 5HT5A receptor revealed an apparent molecular mass about 20 kDa higher than expected from the amino acid sequence. Here, the Kex2 endopeptidase failed to process the alpha-factor leader correctly. Blocking glycosylation in vivo by tunicamycin or in vitro deglycosylation of membranes by endoglycosidase H resulted in correct processing. In contrast, the beta2-adrenergic receptor fusion to the alpha-factor leader was correctly processed by the internal Kex2 endopeptidase. The Kex2-processed beta2-adrenergic receptor was not glycosylated. In conclusion, the high-level production of the two receptors in P. pastoris will allow their purification in quantities sufficient for subsequent biophysical and structural studies.", 
    "11": "Autonomic dysreflexia has long been considered a sympathetically mediated phenomenon. Recent articles have reported the use of alpha blockers as a means of treatment. We report the case of a 20-year-old C5 American Spinal Injury Association A spinal cord injured patient who almost daily experienced symptoms of headache, facial flushing, and hypertension consistent with autonomic dysreflexia. These symptoms caused him frequent discomfort and anxiety. Despite an extensive workup, we were unable to identify a source of his dysreflexic episodes. After starting metoprolol 50 mg every night, however, these episodes stopped and the patient showed no adverse effects from the medication.", 
    "12": "Elevated endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels are found in atherosclerosis, myocardial ischemia, and heart failure, and are correlated with increased mortality rates. Contrary to expectations, elevations of endogenous ET-1 levels in transgenic mice are not associated with increases in arterial blood pressure or with vasospasm, although these effects can be observed after i.v. ET-1 administration. The aim of this study was to determine the regulatory effects of ET-1 on the expression of vasodilator beta-adrenergic receptors and their ability to activate adenylyl cyclase. Smooth-muscle cells were incubated with ET-1 (10(-7) mol/L) for 3 days. The density of ET-1 or beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites was determined using a radioligand binding procedure. Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured to assess any functional changes in the beta-adrenergic receptor density. ET-1 incubation reduced ET-1 binding sites by 70%. In contrast, the beta-adrenergic receptor density increased from 354 +/- 35 to 538 +/- 50 fmol/mg protein (p < 0.01; n = 7) after 3 days. ET-1 increased beta-adrenergic receptors dose-dependently. Incubation with ET-1 for different periods of time showed an initial decrease of 30% after 6 h of ET-1 incubation. However, after 24 h ET-1 induced an increase of beta-adrenergic receptors, reaching a maximal amount after 48 h. An increased stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptor-activated adenylyl cyclase was observed after 3-day ET-1 incubation compared to controls. These data demonstrate that chronic ET receptor activation by ET-1 results in a functionally significant increase in beta-adrenergic receptor density and adenylyl cyclase activity.", 
    "13": "Endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) plays a substantial role in activation of the endothelin (ET) system by cleaving the precursor, big ET-1, to the active peptide ET-1. The aim of this study was to investigate whether ECE-1 mRNA expression is modified in human cardiovascular disease. ECE-1 expression was related to echocardiographic data, drug treatment, age, sex, and NYHA heart failure classification. A quantitative PCR assay (qPCR) was established to measure ECE-1 mRNA in these samples. The ECE-1 measurements were normalized over a simultaneously performed GAPDH qPCR. The results indicate a higher ECE-1 expression level in atrial tissue samples of patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction compared with those who did not (ECE-1/GAPDH: 5.81 +/- 0.76 fg/ng; n = 21 vs. 3.20 +/- 0.51 fg/ng; n = 22; p = 0.007). The transverse diameter of the left atrium over 37 mm was associated with a lower ECE-1 expression (ECE-1/GAPDH: 3.11 +/- 0.69 fg/ng; n = 18 vs. 5.12 +/- 0.65 fg/ng; n = 25; p = 0.044). In assessing the drug treatment, decreased ECE-1 expression could be observed in patients who received a beta-blocker (ECE-1/GAPDH: 3.90 +/- 58 fg/ng; n = 31 vs. 5.81 +/- 0.76 fg/ng; n = 12; p = 0.077). These data suggest an involvement of the ET system is cardiovascular disease that may be clinically important.", 
    "14": "Sotalol is a beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drug, the clinical efficacy of which has been linked up to its negative chrono- and inotropic effects and its hypotensive action. In addition, beta-adrenolytic drugs are known to inhibit platelet aggregation in vitro possibly through lowering of calcium ions level. Here, we report that in rats sotalol at a dose of 10-20 mg/kg i.v., apart from hypotension, evokes instantaneous thrombolytic effect. This is associated with an increase in plasma level of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). In vitro, sotalol at a concentration of 1-100 microM inhibits thrombogenesis on surface of rabbit aorta endothelium superfused with blood. Sotalol also has a weak anti-aggregatory activity (IC50 approximately 500-1000 microM) in human platelet rich plasma (PRP). Since the thrombolytic and fibrinolytic but not hypotensive effects of sotalol were inhibited by cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, while its hypotensive but not thrombolytic potency was dimished by an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), we have linked up the sotalol-induced effects in vivo with the release of prostacyclin and nitric oxide. Our data point out to a possibility that prostacyclin and nitric oxide concomitantly released from endothelium and/or from other blood cells after administration of sotalol, may play different roles: prostacyclin may be responsible for fibrinolytic, thrombolytic and antithrombotic properties, while nitric oxide may take part in the mechanism of sotalol-induced hypotension.", 
    "15": "Stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/JNK) has been implicated in the signaling pathway that leads to cell death. Carvedilol, a new vasodilating beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with potent antioxidant activity, has been shown to convey a high degree of cardioprotection in a variety of experimental models of myocardial ischemia as well as in patients with congestive heart failure. The present study was designed to explore whether the cardioprotective effects of carvedilol involve inhibition of SAPK activation. Ex vivo ischemia (30 min)-reperfusion (60-120 min) of the rabbit heart resulted in 67% reduction of pressure-rate product, 45% necrosis of left ventricular tissue and 62% loss of myocardial creatine kinase (P < 0.01 vs. basal). SAPK levels in the perfused hearts increased markedly following reperfusion (5.6-fold increase, P < 0.01 vs. basal). Carvedilol, at 10 microM, administered at time of reperfusion, enhanced recovery of pressure-rate product by 61%, reduced necrotic size by 65% and decreased myocardial creatine kinase loss by 62% (P < 0.01 vs. vehicle). Carvedilol also inhibited reperfusion-induced activation of SAPK by 61% (P<0.01 vs. vehicle). Carvedilol, at 1 microM, displayed a trend of cardioprotection and inhibition of SAPK activation. Our results suggest that SAPK may play a role in ischemia/reperfusion-induced cardiac injury and inhibition of SAPK activation by carvedilol may contribute to its cardioprotective effects.", 
    "16": "Dramatic morphological, biochemical and cytological changes occur in parotid glands of rats and mice which have been treated with the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (Ipr). Changes include glandular hypertrophy, induction of tissue-specific proline-rich proteins (PRPs), increases in cAMP, and occurrence of polyploidy. Similar changes also occur after feeding mice polyphenolic compounds commonly referred to as tannins. Data are presented which show that changes in cell cycle proteins are due to stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor by either isoproterenol or tannin treatment of mice. Both p34cdc2 mRNA and protein levels were elevated dramatically after mice were treated. Induction of p34cdc2 occurred within 24 hrs. and was transient during treatment. The beta1-adrenergic receptor antagonist atenolol blocked both tissue-specific expression of proline-rich proteins and induction of p34cdc2. Coincident with the increase in p34cdc2, cyclin-dependent kinase complexes containing cyclins A and B increased forty- and ten-fold, respectively. These results show that in mouse parotid glands activation of the beta1-adrenergic receptor by either the administration of isoproterenol or ingestion of dietary tannins induces synthesis of p34cdc2 and most likely contributes to the occurrence of polyploidy.", 
    "17": "In several observational studies, patients prescribed calcium channel blockers had higher risks of cardiovascular diseases and mortality than those prescribed other antihypertensive medications. We explored these associations in the Nurses' Health Study.", 
    "18": "A total of 14 617 women who reported hypertension and regular use of diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, or a combination in 1988 were included in the analyses. Cardiovascular events and deaths were ascertained through May 1, 1994. We documented 234 cases of myocardial infarction. Calcium channel blocker monodrug users had an age-adjusted relative risk (RR) of myocardial infarction of 2.36 (95% CI, 1.43 to 3.91) compared with those prescribed thiazide diuretics. Women prescribed calcium channel blockers had a higher prevalence of ischemic heart disease. After adjustment for these and other coronary risk factors, the RR was 1.64 (95% CI, 0.97 to 2.77). Comparing the use of any calcium channel blocker (monodrug and multidrug users) with that of any other antihypertensive agent, the adjusted RR was 1.42 (95% CI, 1.01 to 2.01). An association between calcium channel blocker use and myocardial infarction was apparent among women who had ever smoked cigarettes (covariate-adjusted RR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.20 to 2.72) but not among never-smokers (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.48 to 1.84).", 
    "19": "In analyses adjusted only for age, we found a significant elevation in RR of total myocardial infarction among women who used calcium channel blockers compared with those who did not. After adjustment for comorbidity and other covariates, the RR was reduced. Whether the remaining observed elevated risk is real, or a result of residual confounding by indication, or chance, or a combination of the above cannot be evaluated with certainty on the basis of these observational data.", 
    "20": "Short-term injection of ferulinolol (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) produced dose-dependent bradycardia responses in pentobarbital-anesthetized Wistar rats, whereas it had no significant effects on the blood pressure. Ferulinolol markedly inhibited the tachycardia effects induced by (-)isoproterenol but did not show any blocking effect on the arterial pressor responses induced by (-)phenylephrine. These findings clearly suggested that ferulinolol had a beta-adrenergic blocking activity; nevertheless, it did not involve an alpha-adrenergic blocking action. In isolated guinea pig tissues, ferulinolol competitively antagonized (-)isoproterenol-induced positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of the atria and tracheal relaxation responses. The parallel shift to the right of the concentration-response curve of (-)isoproterenol suggested that ferulinolol was a beta-adrenoceptor-competitive antagonist. The apparent pA2 values for ferulinolol on right atria, left atria, and trachea were 7.62 +/- 0.05, 7.54 +/- 0.01, and 6.28 +/- 0.11, respectively. Ferulinolol was more potent on the atria than on tracheal tissues, demonstrating that it possessed beta1-adrenoceptor selectivity. The intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) of ferulinolol and propranolol were determined on isolated atria and trachea from reserpine-treated guinea pig. Propranolol caused significantly negative inotropic and chronotropic effects at > or =1 microM, whereas ferulinolol possessed fewer cardiodepressant activities than propranolol. In reserpine-treated tracheal strips, ferulinolol produced dose-dependent relaxant responses, but propranolol was without effectiveness. Preincubating the preparations with ICI 118,551 (0.1, 1.0, and 10 nM), a beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist, significantly shifted the concentration-relaxation curves of ferulinolol to a region of higher concentrations. These results implied that ferulinolol had a partial beta2-agonist activity. Further, binding characteristics of ferulinolol and various beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were evaluated in [3H]CGP-12177 binding to rat ventricular or lung membranes. The Ki values of ferulinolol, atenolol, metoprolol, and (-)propranolol were 103, 262, 123, and 0.23 nM, respectively, in ventricular membranes, and 2,412, 7,539, 2,186, and 0.72 nM, respectively, in lung membranes. In conclusion, ferulinolol was found to be a highly selective beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist with partial beta2-agonist activity but was devoid of alpha-adrenoceptor blocking action.", 
    "21": "We examined the action of levosimendan, a new Ca2+-sensitizing inodilator, on isolated porcine coronary arteries. Vessel rings were studied in isometric myographs. Arterial cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Levosimendan (10(-7)-10(-3) M) completely relaxed arteries preconstricted by prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha) with a pD2 (-logEC50) value of 3.99 +/- 0.05 (n = 6-9 in all experiments). Pretreatment with levosimendan also prevented contraction induced by PGF2alpha. The vasorelaxation produced by levosimendan (10(-7)-10(-3) M) was not attenuated by removal of the endothelium. Levosimendan (10(-7)-10(-3) M) relaxed contractions induced by 30 mM K+ as well as 80 mM K+, whereas the K+ channel opener levcromakalim selectively relaxed contraction induced by 30 mM K+. Neither the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin nor the beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol influenced levosimendan-induced vasorelaxation. The Ca2+-entry blocker isradipine failed to relax arteries precontracted by endothelin-1 in Ca2+-free/EGTA medium. However, levosimendan (10(-7)-3 x 10(-3) M) completely relaxed endothelin-1-induced contractions in this medium. Levosimendan potentiated the relaxant effect of a cAMP-stimulating drug, isoprenaline, but also that of nitroglycerin and isradipine. At a maximal effective concentration, it increased arterial tissue contents of cAMP twofold. In conclusion, levosimendan produces coronary vasorelaxation by a mechanism that seems to be endothelium independent and not mediated by K+ channel opening, Ca2+-entry blockade, release of cyclooxygenase products, or beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. Accumulation of cAMP may possibly participate in vasorelaxation at high concentrations of levosimendan, but a cAMP-independent mechanism seems to be involved at lower concentrations.", 
    "22": "The alpha-blockers prazosin and doxazosin reduce hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) and increase serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, whereas beta-blockers such as atenolol have the opposite effect. As HTG is associated with reduced fibrinolysis and hypercoagulability, we investigated the effects of doxazosin and atenolol on serum lipids and hemostatic factors in hypertensive men with an atherothrombogenic risk profile. The study was randomized and open, but blinded to investigator of biochemical results. Forty-five men (mean age, 44.5 years) with central obesity [median body-mass index (BMI), 28 kg/m2] and moderate hypertension [median diastolic blood pressure (DBP), 104.5 mm Hg] were treated with atenolol (n = 22) or doxazosin (n = 23) for 22 weeks, after which changes in between-group differences from baseline were estimated. After intervention, significant between-group differences in favor of doxazosin were found: lower triglycerides (p = 0.008) and higher HDL cholesterol (p = 0.036); furthermore, improvement of fibrinolysis: lower plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity (p = 0.012), higher tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity after venous occlusion (VO); and higher levels of serum D-dimer, both unstimulated (p = 0.0016) and after VO (p = 0.0032). In addition, lower levels of serum testosterone were found in the atenolol group (p = 0.0016). A profile with reduced HTG, increased HDL cholesterol, and improved fibrinolysis was obtained with doxazosin when compared with atenolol. Furthermore, the observed decrease in serum testosterone on atenolol treatment would rather favor long-term treatment with doxazosin in this study population.", 
    "23": "The combination of morphological atherosclerotic alterations of coronary vessels and disturbance of coronary vasomotor control of epicardial and resistance vessels determines the amount of myocardial oxygen supply. The endothelium plays a crucial role for functional alterations of the coronary vessels in patients with early atherosclerosis or risk factors for coronary artery disease. A therapy which aims to ameliorate endothelium-dependent vasodilator capacity improves myocardial perfusion in patients with coronary artery disease. Thereby, even in patients with angiographically normal or minimally diseased coronary vessels who develop myocardial ischemia due to microvascular disease, symptomatic improvement might be achieved. Control of coronary vasomotor tone and proliferation processes within the vessel wall are both determined by the redox equilibrium of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide radicals (O2-), induced by angiotensin II. Thus, vasomotor control and vessel wall proliferation is closely related to each other. Aim of a therapeutic intervention to enhance NO bioactivity is either to increase NO production in the endothelium or to decrease O2- production, which rapidly inactivates NO. NO bioactivity can be ameliorated by ACE-inhibitors, increase of shear stress on the endothelium by physical exercise, estrogens or L-arginine. For these therapies clinically an improvement of endothelial vasodilator function could be shown. In addition, improvement of endothelial vasodilator function can be achieved by a treatment which reduced oxidative stress in the vascular wall such as antioxidants and, especially, lipid lowering drugs. Endothelin-antagonists and angiotensin II receptor-blockers are promising to improve endothelial dysfunction. However, these therapies have to be validated. Most therapy strategies, which have shown to ameliorate endothelial dysfunction, are also able to improve prognosis of the patients. Whether endothelial dysfunction alone--without evidence of overt coronary atherosclerosis--is sufficient to justify a long-term therapy to improve prognosis, still has to be clarified.", 
    "24": "We have studied the regio- and stereoselectivity of ring-hydroxylation and N-desisopropylation of S(-)- and R(+)-propranolol, using dog liver microsomes and the expressed dog CYP2D15 in insect cells. In dog liver microsomes, 4-hydroxylation was the preferred pathway in S(-)-propranolol oxidation, while N-desisopropylation was the preferred pathway in R(+)-propranolol oxidation. S(-)-Propranolol was preferred over R(+)-propranolol as substrate for 4- and 5-hydroxylations, while R(+)-propranolol was the preferred substrate for N-desisopropylation at higher substrate concentrations. The expressed CYP2D15 had high catalytic activities toward 4-, 5-hydroxylation, as well as N-desisopropylation of both enantiomers. At the substrate concentrations used, 4-hydroxylation was the preferred pathway for the metabolism of both enantiomers, and S(-)-propranolol was the preferred substrate over R(+)-propranolol for all three monooxygenations catalyzed by CYP2D15. Anti-CYP2D15 peptide antibody strongly inhibited 4- and 5-hydroxylation of both enantiomers in dog liver microsomes, while it did not inhibit their N-desisopropylation. These findings suggest that CYP2D15 is highly responsible for the stereoselective 4- and 5-hydroxylations of propranolol in dog liver microsomes.",

    "26": "The antianginal efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine and diltiazem were compared in a double-blind randomized trial of 97 patients with angina resistant to atenolol alone. Both amlodipine and diltiazem significantly reduced the frequency of angina attacks (p <0.001) and glyceryl trinitrate consumption (p <0.05 to p <0.01). During Holter monitoring, both treatments reduced the overall frequency of ambulatory myocardial ischemia, although changes did not reach statistical significance. Exercise test parameters (total exercise time, time to angina, time to ST depression, and maximum ST depression) tended to improve with both treatments, but changes did not achieve statistical significance relative to baseline or to each other. Both drugs were generally well tolerated. Adverse events occurred in 15 patients in the amlodipine group (30%) and in 17 patients in the diltiazem group (36%), but patients taking diltiazem reported almost twice as many adverse events (30) patients taking amlodipine (18). Quality of life, as assessed by total Nottingham Health Profile Scores, was not significantly different between treatments. The addition of either once-daily amlodipine or twice-daily sustained release diltiazem improved symptoms in patients with angina resistant to atenolol alone, but diltiazem was associated with more frequent and more serious adverse events.", 
    "27": "Anginal patients who remain symptomatic despite optimally dosed beta blockade may also be given dihydropyridine calcium antagonists. This treatment regimen was examined in a double-blind parallel, randomized, controlled study in 147 patients with angina and positive bicycle exercise tests despite optimal beta blockade with atenolol (heart rate at rest <60 beats/min). Patients were randomized to atenolol and/or placebo (control), and atenolol and/or amlodipine. The main outcome measurement was exercise tolerance after 8 weeks compared with baseline. After 8 weeks, no significant differences in time to 0.1-mV ST-segment depression, time to chest pain, and time to end of exercise were observed. The number of patients with chest pain during exercise decreased significantly in the amlodipine group (p = 0.04 vs controls). The subgroup of patients with an early (<6 minutes) onset of chest pain at baseline showed a significant increase in time to chest pain after amlodipine (p = 0.0001 vs controls). In the amlodipine group, ST depression and rate-pressure product at submaximum comparable workload decreased to 0.4 mm (0.56) (p = 0.03 vs controls) and 1.223 (2.652) beats/ min x mm Hg (p = 0.01 vs controls). The number of patients in each group with adverse events was not different. The addition of amlodipine to the treatment of patients with myocardial ischemia, despite optimal beta blockade, is well tolerated and may lead to improvement in symptomatic anginal patients, who have a rapid onset of exercise-induced ischemia.", 
    "28": "Some noncompetitive inhibitors (e.g., ganglionic blockers) exhibit selectivity for the inhibition of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This study characterizes the mechanism of selective long-term inhibition of neuronal and muscle-neuronal chimeric nAChRs by bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl) sebacate (bis-TMP-10 or BTMPS), a bifunctional form of the potent ganglionic blocker tetramethylpiperidine. Long-term inhibition of neuronal nAChRs by bis-TMP-10 has been previously demonstrated to arise, at least in part, from the binding of the bis compound to neuronal beta-subunits. In this study, long-term inhibition is demonstrated to be dependent upon the presence of sequence element(s) within the pore-lining second transmembrane domain (tm2) of neuronal beta-subunits; however, the inhibitor binding site itself does not appear to be contained within the segment of the channel pore influenced by the membrane electric field. Specifically, our results imply that bis-TMP-10 interacts with an activation-sensitive element, the availability of which may be regulated by a sequence in the tm2 domain. Furthermore, we demonstrate a compound length requirement for long-term inhibition that would be consistent with binding to multiple sites located on the extracellular portion of the receptor.", 
    "29": "Tachycardia in the asthmatics and bronchitis patients is very frequently observed. Atenolol-beta 1 selective beta-blockers, have little lipophilicity and intrinsic sympathetic activity and relatively long acting. It is known that atenolol more then other beta-adrenergics decreases frequency of cardiac rhythm even in a doses which have not antiarrhythmic nor hypotensive action. Atenolol effect on airways resistance was studied in patients with chronic bronchitis and bronchial asthma determining the heart rate, pulse and atrial blood pressure and the vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume (FEV1%VC), value of maximal expiratory flow at 50% of VC(MEF50) thoracic gas volume (TGV) and bronchial resistance (Rt). A statistically significant difference in the measurements of heart rate and pulse but no rise of the airways resistance after 25-50 mg atenolol per day was observed.", 
    "30": "We compared the cardioprotective effects during experimental ischemia and reperfusion of beraprost sodium (beraprost), a prostacyclin analog, with those of propranolol and diltiazem. Coronary perfused guinea-pig right ventricular free wall preparations were subjected to 30 min no-flow ischemia with or without drugs, followed by 60 min reperfusion without drugs. In control preparations, decrease in contractile force and increase in resting tension were observed during the no-flow period. On reperfusion, contractile force returned to less than 50% of preischemic values. Beraprost, at 0.1 microM, showed no inotropic effect under normoxic condition and during the no-flow period, but significantly enhanced the recovery of contractile force after reperfusion to about 80% of control values. Propranolol (30 microM) or diltiazem (10 microM) produced similar enhancement of recovery of contractile force after reperfusion, but these two drugs decreased the contractile force under normoxic conditions to less than 20% of control values. Thus, the cardioprotective effect of beraprost was different from those of propranolol and diltiazem in that it was not accompanied by cardiosuppressive effects.", 
    "31": "Acute psychological stress of a first time parachute jump stimulated DHEA and cortisol secretion in healthy volunteers. A significant shift from cortisol to DHEA occurred during this stress exposure. This effect was more pronounced in subjects receiving the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol prior to the jump. In contrast, infusion of epinephrine (0.10 microgram/kg/min) or norepinephrine (0.15 microgram/kg/min) for 20 min neither affected DHEA plasma levels nor the DHEA/cortisol ratio. However, pretreatment with propranolol resulted in a significant increase of the DHEA/cortisol ratio upon infusion of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist epinephrine. These data demonstrate that during acute psychological stress stimulation of adrenal steroid release is accompanied by a shift towards DHEA. Augmentation of this effect by beta-adrenoceptor blockade indicates a beta-adrenoceptor-dependent mechanism affecting DHEA release.", 
    "32": "1. Drug-induced early afterdepolarizations (EAD) are considered to be the underlying mechanism of the polymorphic ventricular dysrhythmia torsades de pointes. Sotalol and disopyramide are well known to generate EAD. Therefore, it was of interest to study the effects of potassium channel activators, such as nicorandil, pinacidil and lemakalim, on those drug-induced EAD in spontaneously beating guinea-pig Purkinje fibres using the intracellular microelectrode technique. 2. Early afterdepolarizations induced by sotalol at concentrations of 80 and 160 micromol/L could be completely abolished by nicorandil at concentrations between 50 and 500 micromol/L. The extracellular K+ concentration was 2.7 mmol/L. 3. Disopyramide-induced EAD at concentrations of 10, 20 and 30 micromol/L in a Tyrode's solution containing 1.35 mmol/L K+ and these EAD were abolished by pinacidil (30 and 100 micromol/L) and lemakalim (10 and 30 micromol/L). 4. Early afterdepolarizations could be regenerated by superfusion of Purkinje fibres with K+ channel activator-free Tyrode's solution containing either sotalol or disopyramide. 5. Our results demonstrate that drug-induced EAD can be abolished by K+ channel activators and, therefore, may provide anti-arrhythmic effects in heart diseases.", 
    "33": "1. The present study was designed to compare and contrast the effects of 1 year's treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (captopril 25-100 mg daily) and beta-blockade (atenolol 50-100 mg daily) on hypertensive cardiac structure and function as well as the other established cardiovascular risk factors of high blood pressure (BP), lipid profile and blood glucose. 2. This was a prospective randomized open drug trial with blinded end-point echocardiographic and cardiac Doppler assessment in 37 subjects who had primary essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy of captopril (n = 20) versus atenolol (n = 17), adding hydrochlorothiazide if BP was not controlled by 1 month. Multiple time point measurements throughout the 1 year treatment period of the study were made of BP, echocardiographic parameters of cardiac structure and function, as well as lipid profile and blood glucose. 3. There were no significant between-group differences for captopril or atenolol with regard to BP (at baseline (mean +/- SD) 154.0/101.1 +/- 13.3/5.1 and 152.5/101.8 +/- 10.0/5.8 mmHg, respectively) which was normalized by 1 month (138.7/85.6 +/- 18.8/11.7 and 135.4/88.5 +/- 16.9/9.5 mmHg, respectively) in both treatment groups (both P < 0.01 vs baseline). Also, there were no between-group or within-group differences for any of the measures of left ventricular hypertrophy or systolic function throughout the 12 month treatment period; however, captopril alone significantly increased left ventricular early diastolic filling (P < 0.05 vs baseline) at most of the measured time points. Furthermore, there were no significant between- or within-group differences with regard to metabolic (lipids and glucose) profile over the 1 year treatment period of the present study. 4. Markers of cardiovascular risk, including BP, echocardiographic measures of left ventricular hypertrophy, lipid profile and blood glucose were not significantly different between therapies. Despite good BP control by 1 month, neither drug regimen regressed left ventricular hypertrophy. However, captopril significantly increased left ventricular early diastolic filling after 3 months of treatment.", 
    "34": "The treatment for asthma usually involves a combination of drugs used for bronchodilation and to treat underlying airway inflammation. When asthma is severe, the regimen used to treat asthma can become quite complicated, often using as many as 3 or 4 separate pharmacological agents. As patients with asthma get older, their medication regimen can become even more complex with the development of numerous other age-related diseases requiring their own list of medications. Diseases of the joints, diseases of the eye, cardiovascular disease, neurological disease and urological problems represent the most common conditions that patients develop, at times needing medications which might interfere with asthma management. Many of these diseases require the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, well known to provoke wheezing in patients with intrinsic asthma, and diseases of the eye and cardiovascular system frequently require use of beta-blockers which can cause or exacerbate asthma. Managing patients with asthma who have other diseases requires constant supervision of their medication usage and careful and cautious review of the entire list of medications at each presentation.", 
    "35": "Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia caused by atrioventricular re-entry is the most frequent arrhythmia in children of all age groups. It represents the most frequent clinical situation where antiarrhythmic drug therapy has to be considered in a child. Acute termination of an episode of tachycardia in all paediatric age groups is nowadays best achieved with an intravenous bolus injection of adenosine. Since the introduction of adenosine into clinical practice, the need to proceed to electrocardioversion has been limited to the infant (or in rare cases an older child) with severe cardiovascular collapse. In the haemodynamically stable infant or child, several other antiarrhythmic agents such as flecainide or propafenone can be used with relative safety and with a high probability of immediate success. The same is true for verapamil, although intravenous administration should be avoided in the first year of life. In newborns and in infants with first presentation of an episode of tachycardia, drug prophylaxis of recurrences is usually recommended for the whole of the first year of life. Prophylactic treatment may consist of oral digoxin as first choice, with a beta-blocker as an alternative. In an infant with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome it may be wise to avoid digoxin and to start treatment with a beta-blocker. Antiarrhythmic class Ic drugs such as propafenone or flecainide, and the class III agent sotalol, are widely used as the next steps of therapy when digoxin and beta-blockers fail to prevent recurrences. These agents are about equivalent with regard to their efficacy and risk profile. Amiodarone is considered to be an agent that should be reserved for use in situations when the tachycardia is refractory to the previously named agents. Older children may commence treatment with a beta-blocker and the subsequent steps of treatment are the same as those for infants. Curative catheter ablation of accessory pathways has been shown to be as efficient and well tolerated in the paediatric age group as it is in adults. This treatment option is nowadays quite often offered to older children. However, in infants and smaller children, ablation is used as a last resort. Rare forms of paediatric supraventricular tachycardia (other than atrioventricular re-entry through the atrioventricular node or accessory pathways) are occasionally difficult to treat and present special problems. For each of these arrhythmias, a specially tailored individual therapeutic approach is needed.", 
    "36": "According to the JNC-5, at least six classes of antihypertensive agents have been synthesized and currently recommended for initial antihypertensive therapy in the USA for elderly patients. Each class is safe and effective in reducing arterial pressure, each has its own specific mechanism(s) of action that suppress specific pressor mechanisms, and each has its own side-effects which may be overcome by substituting a drug from another class of agents. In the case of adrenergic inhibitors, more specific agents have been introduced over the years. Each succeeding new class has obviated certain adverse effects of an earlier class. In the case of alpha-adrenergic receptor inhibitors, this concept is of particular value with the alpha 1A-receptor inhibiting compounds. The alpha 1-adrenergic inhibitors have special value for elderly patients with BPH as both hypertension and the prostatic disease can be treated with one compound. The alpha 1A-antagonists may have particular value in those patients in whom further reduction of arterial pressure is not desired and this obviously includes the normotensive elderly patient and the hypertensive patient whose blood pressure is already well-controlled by other agents.", 
    "37": "We analysed the modulation of respiratory neurons by adrenaline or noradrenaline (NA) in a newborn rat brainstem-spinal cord preparation. Adrenaline or NA caused a dose-dependent depression of the respiratory rhythm and induced C4 spinal tonic discharges. The inhibitory effect of adrenaline (ED50=0.5 microM) on the respiratory rhythm was stronger than NA (ED50=5 microM). The adrenaline respiratory rhythm depression was partially blocked by the alpha1-antagonist prazosin or by the alpha2-antagonist yohimbine. The C4 tonic discharge elicited by adrenaline was blocked by the alpha1-antagonist prazosin. The direct effects of adrenaline on pre-inspiratory (Pre-I) neurons were examined in a synaptic blockade solution (low Ca), and fifty-six percent of Pre-I neurons were found to continue firing. In low-Ca solution, Pre-I neurons were excited (n=29 of 39) or depressed (n=5 of 39) by adrenaline, and excited by alpha1-agonist phenylephrine or depressed by alpha2-agonist clonidine. These results suggest that the respiratory rhythm depression under intact network conditions is mediated by some other inhibitory system. The inhibitory effect of adrenaline on the respiratory rhythm was partially blocked by the GABA(A)-antagonists bicuculline or picrotoxin, but not by the GABA(B)-antagonist phaclofen. The present results suggest that: (1) respiratory rhythm generation is more sensitive to adrenaline than NA through alpha-adrenergic action of adrenaline; (2) the activity of Pre-I neurons could be directly regulated by excitation via alpha1-receptors and inhibition via alpha2-receptors; and (3) the depression of the respiratory rhythm by adrenaline is partly mediated by GABA(A)ergic neurons.",

Dog microsomes showed stereoselective hydrolysis for propranolol prodrugs, but not those from human or rat. Interestingly, both subcellular fractions of Caco-2 cells showed remarkable R-enantioselectivity except acetyl propranolol. Enzyme kinetic experiments for each enantiomer of butyryl propranolol in microsomes revealed that dog possesses both low and high affinity hydrolases. Both Km and Vmax values in rat were largest among examined microsomes, while Vmax/Km was largest in man. Finally, it was shown that the carboxylesterases might contribute to the hydrolysis of propranolol prodrug in all species by inhibition experiments.",

    "42": "Thoracic aortic aneurysms are the main cardiovascular complication of Marfan's syndrome. Elastic tissue dystrophy of the ascending aorta is responsible for appearances of cystic medial necrosis in the major forms. Dilatation of the ascending aorta is progressive with time. The risk of dissection and rupture, an acute complication of Marfan's syndrome, is very high when the aortic dilatation reaches 60 mm, although dissection may be observed with dilatation of 50 mm. Aortic regurgitation is found in half the cases. Echocardiography, CT scan and MRI provide accurate assessment of the anatomy of the lesions and help in following up the dilatation. Betablocker therapy slows down the progression of the dilatation. Bentall's procedure was first described in 1968 with its technical variants for reimplantation of the coronary arteries: Cabrol's procedure, technique of periostal lean-to, the button technique, are major advances in the surgical treatment of ascending aortic aneurysms. The life expectancy is reported to be about 90% at 5 years and 75 to 80% at 10 years. Reoperation is sometimes necessary because of pseudo-aneurysms occurring as a late complication at the operation site or because of other aneurysms developing. Progress in the field of genetics is a hope for the future.", 
    "43": "Marfan's syndrome is a disease of collagen microfibrils, the essential composition of which, fibrillin, is defective. The coding gene of this large protein has been localised on chromosome 15 and partially cloned. Its mutation is transmitted in the autosomal dominant mode. It is common, affects many organs, especially those rich in collagen. They include the skeleton, the eye and cardiovascular system. The prognosis of these patients depends on the degree of cardiovascular involvement; the aorta is the principal site of the lesions, particularly the aortic root which tends to develop aneurysmal dilatation, then dissection, the main cause of premature death of these patients. Mitral valve prolapse giving rise to mitral regurgitation may also be observed. Much progress has been made is recent years in the management of Marfan's syndrome, especially in ultrasound follow-up of the aortic root and the definition of risk factors for dissection. In parallel, advances have been made in the treatment, both medical with the use of betablockers to try to slow progression to aneurysm, and surgical, in replacement of the aorta and aortic valve in time and under optimal conditions. Life expectancy is thereby significantly increased. Similar progress has been made to allow these patients to have a pregnancy, classically thought to carry a high risk of maternal death.",

Calcium channel blockers have been shown in vitro and in vivo to inhibit secretion and synthesis of extracellular matrix, including collagen, glycosaminoglycans, and fibronectin, as well as causing increased collagenase and anti transforming growth factor-beta activity. Calcium antagonists, including verapamil, are effective in stimulating the remodeling and degradation of extracellular matrix in tissue by altering the metabolic pathways of fibroblasts. Recently, a pilot study (1994) showed preliminary promising results in treating plaque caused by Peyronie's disease. This randomized single-blind placebo-based study (1994 to 1996) was undertaken to confirm the hypothesis.", 
    "45": "In this randomized single-blind study, 14 patients completed the study and were divided into two groups: the verapamil treatment group (n = 7) or the control saline group (n = 7). Verapamil or saline was injected directly into the Peyronie's plaque once a week for 6 months. Patients were evaluated before and after treatment with duplex ultrasound to confirm the extent of the lesion and to measure volume of the plaque, and by interview and mailed questionnaire 3 months after treatment. Patients being treated with oral calcium antagonists were excluded from the study.", 
    "46": "A decreased plaque volume was measured in 57% of the verapamil-treated men versus 28% in the control group (P <0.04). Penile curvature demonstrated an improvement trend of 37.71 +/- 9.3 degrees to 29.57 +/- 7.3 degrees in the verapamil-treated patients, but the difference was not significant (P <0.07). Plaque softening was noted in all patients treated with verapamil. There was significant objective improvement in plaque-associated penile narrowing in all patients in the verapamil group. Subjective plaque-associated erectile dysfunction (quality of erection) showed improvement in 42.87% of the verapamil group versus none in the control group (P <0.02). There was no local or systemic toxicity except for an occasional ecchymosis/bruise at the injection site.

    "48": "Diabetic patients have increased mortality following myocardial infarction. We review the evidence for benefit in diabetic patients, of the major drug groups used as secondary prevention. Beta blockers: meta-analyses suggest a reduction in mortality of 35% with beta blockers. Diabetic patients should receive beta blockers post myocardial infarction. In many patients, the benefits of beta blockers will outweigh relative contraindications. Aspirin: meta-analyses of antiplatelet therapy in high-risk subjects have shown substantial benefits. Aspirin should be prescribed for secondary prevention. Lipid lowering with statins: subgroup analyses of the major secondary prevention trials show substantial benefits across a wide range of baseline cholesterol and LDL levels. These drugs should be prescribed as secondary prevention to patients with diabetes whose total cholesterol is > 4.0 mmol(-1). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs): the few subgroup analyses that exist from ACEI trials suggest that diabetic and non-diabetic patients derive similar benefits. Diabetic subjects who have systolic dysfunction after myocardial infarction should receive ACEIs.

Based on the available evidence, there appears to be no one best anesthetic technique or agent. More importantly, the goals of intraoperative management are to avoid myocardial ischemia, which include preventing tachycardia, and maintaining normothermia and adequate hematocrit. Perioperative monitoring includes transesophageal echocardiography, pulmonary artery catheter and ST segment monitoring. Perioperative pharmacological treatment with alpha-2 agonists and beta-adrenergic blocking agents are associated with a reduced incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia and improved long-term survival, respectively. Future research will be required to determine whether prophylactic therapy or early treatment of perioperative myocardial ischemia will lead to improved outcome.", 
    "51": "Recent studies have revealed that lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) produces mechanical and metabolic derangements in perfused working rat hearts and Ca2+-overload in isolated cardiac myocytes. Thus, LPC possesses an ischemia-like effect on the heart. Therefore, a drug that possesses an anti-LPC action would protect or improve ischemia/reperfusion damage. We examined the effects of various anti-ischemic drugs on the Ca2+ overload induced by LPC. Our data suggest that a drug with high lipophilicity possesses a protective effect on cell injury induced by LPC, probably because of preservation of membrane integrity.",

Through modeling, possible binding sites for these agents were hypothesized to involve the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th helices of the beta2-AR, and these shared a common interaction site at Asp113 in helix 3. The different chemical structure of these three agents, however, showed binding to different binding sites (amino acids). This study therefore suggests that different beta-blocking potencies of these agents may be due to different chemical structure.", 
    "53": "The environmentally sensitive and cysteine reactive fluorescent probe, IANBD, was used to monitor ligand-induced structural changes in the beta2 adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) by fluorescent spectroscopy. We found that agonists caused a dose-dependent and reversible decrease in fluorescence from the purified IANBD-labeled beta2AR. This suggested that agonists promote a conformational change in the receptor that leads to an increase in the polarity of the environment around one or more IANBD labeled cysteines. The wildtype receptor contains eight free cysteines and mutagenesis and peptide mapping experiments have indicated that several of these sites are accessible for chemical derivatization. Thus, to identify the cysteine(s) involved in the agonist-induced change in fluorescence and thereby map agonist-induced conformational changes in the beta2AR, we generated a series of mutant receptors having limited numbers of cysteines available for fluorescent labeling. Fluorescence spectroscopy analysis of the purified and site-selectively IANBD-labeled mutants showed that IANBD labeled 125Cys and 285Cys are responsible for the observed changes in fluorescence consistent with movements of TM III and VI in response to agonist binding.", 
    "54": "Beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation of guinea-pig taenia caecum was investigated by studying the effects of BRL37344, CGP12177 and norepinephrine. These drugs caused graded relaxation of the guinea-pig taenia caecum. The concentration-response curves for these drugs were unaffected by propranolol, atenolol, butoxamine, prazosin, yohimbine and phentolamine. Bupranolol produced shifts of the concentration-response curves for these drugs. Schild regression analyses carried out for bupranolol against BRL37344, CGP12177 and norepinephrine gave pA2 values of 5.79, 5.61 and 5.53, respectively. CGP12177 and norepinephrine significantly increased cyclic AMP levels in this preparation. Bupranolol significantly decreased cyclic AMP levels elicited by CGP12177 and norepinephrine, whereas propranolol produced no effect. These results suggest that the relaxant responses to BRL37344, CGP12177 and norepinephrine in the guinea-pig taenia caecum are mediated by beta3-adrenoceptors.",

Instillations of 0.25 and 0.5% timoptic depot for 4 weeks did not appreciably change the intraocular pressure, no local or general side effects were noted. Hence, timoptic depot is a more convenient drug for glaucoma patients, remaining effective even after long use.", 
    "57": "Nasal vascular and secretory responses to local intra-arterial injection of acetylcholine (ACh) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and to electrical stimulation of the nasal parasympathetic nerve fibres were recorded in dogs anaesthetized with pentobarbital. The influence of pretreatment with atropine and propranolol and the nitric oxide synthetase (NOS) inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) was analysed. As a marker for NOS, NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry was studied in the sphenopalatine ganglion, trigeminal nerve and nasal mucosa. Local intra-arterial infusion of ACh and VIP evoked dose-dependent vasodilatation and nasal secretion which were not modified in the presence of L-NNA. The NO donor nitroprusside induced dose-dependent vasodilatation but no secretion. Atropine did not reduce the vasodilatation evoked by the parasympathetic nerve stimulation, but did reduce the secretory response by 55% (p < 0.05). During L-NNA infusion, the atropine-resistant vasodilatation evoked by parasympathetic nerve stimulation was reduced by a further 80% (p < 0.01) and the non-cholinergic secretory response was reduced by a further 30% (p < 0.05). Simultaneous infusion of the NO donor nitroprusside reversed the secretory response but not the vasodilator response to parasympathetic nerve stimulation. Histochemical studies revealed that NADPH-d activity was co-localized with VIP in parasympathetic axons. These observations suggest that NO could act as a non-cholinergic parasympathetic neurotransmitter in the vascular and secretory control of the dog nasal mucosa.", 
    "58": "This study assessed the relative involvement of the two bradykinin (Bk) receptors (B1 and B2) in the viscero-visceral hyper-reflexia (VVH) and plasma extravasation observed in an animal model of cystitis. The effects of the competitive receptor antagonists des-Arg9[Leu8]-Bk (B1) and HOE 140 (B2) were tested both in prophylactic (pre-inflammation administration) and therapeutic (post-inflammation administration) scenarios. Compared with control animals, des-Arg9[Leu8]-Bk had no effect on the hyper-reflexic response of the bladder to inflammation unless it was administered 5 h after inflammation. However, HOE 140 was able to attenuate the inflammation-induced viscero-visceral hyper-reflexia (VVH) at doses of 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg. This effect was apparent whether the drug was administered before, or after inflammation. In contrast, neither compound was effective in attenuating the intravesical plasma extravasation induced by turpentine. The data therefore suggest that the VVH and tissue inflammation responses are mediated via different mechanisms. In addition, the turpentine-induced VVH appears to be mediated, at least partially, by the B2 receptor in the early phase, with the B1 receptor only becoming important later.", 
    "59": "This study was performed to examine whether the direct topical application of isoproterenol to the cerebral cortex could modify the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and whether this effect could be blocked by Timolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist without a membrane stabilizing effect. After a craniotomy in each animal, a low-dose (10(-4) M, n = 6) or a high-dose (10(-3) M, n = 6) isoproterenol patch was placed on one cortex (Ipsilateral Cortex: IC) and a normal saline patch was placed on the other cortex (Control Cortex: CC). Another 6 animals were pretreated with Timolol 1.5 mg kg(-1) i.v. before the placement of high dose isoproterenol patches. The BBB transfer coefficient (Ki) was determined using 14C-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased after low- and high-dose isoproterenol patches. The low- and high-dose of isoproterenol increased Ki by 58% (IC: 5.94+/-2.02, CC: 3.77+/-1.75 microl g min(-1)) and 66% (IC: 6.97+/-3.66, CC: 4.19+/-2.48 microl g min(-1)) respectively when compared to that of the corresponding CC. Pretreatment with Timolol prevented the increase of the Ki by a high-dose of isoproterenol (IC: 5.33+/-1.88, CC: 5.66+/-1.72 microl g min(-1)). Our data demonstrate that a direct application of a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist to the brain parenchyma increased the permeability of the BBB, and that this effect could be prevented with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist.", 
    "60": "As an alternative to cardioplegic arrest, cardiac surgical conditions have been produced using beta-blocker-induced minimal myocardial contraction (MMC) during cardiopulmonary bypass. The technique of MMC involves the use of high-dose intravenous esmolol to suppress myocardial chronotropy and inotropy sufficiently to produce cardiac surgical conditions. The purpose of this study was to compare conventional crystalloid cardioplegic arrest with MMC in terms of ischemia avoidance, myocardial edema formation, and cardiac function.", 
    "61": "Twelve dogs were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. Six dogs were subjected to crystalloid cardioplegic arrest for 2 hours. Surgical conditions were produced in the other 6 dogs for 2 hours using intravenous esmolol without aortic clamping or cardioplegia. Arterial and coronary sinus lactate concentrations were determined as a gauge of myocardial ischemia. Myocardial water content was determined using microgravimetry and preload recruitable stroke work was determined using sonomicrometry and micromanometry.", 
    "62": "Significant lactate washout was demonstrated after cardioplegic arrest but not after MMC. Myocardial water content was significantly less during and after MMC compared with cardioplegic arrest (p < 0.05). Preload recruitable stroke work was decreased compared with baseline values in both groups (p < 0.05).", 
    "63": "In contrast to a previous study that involved 1 hour of MMC, in this study, ventricular function was decreased to the same extent as with cardioplegic arrest after 2 hours of MMC. This was attributed to the accumulation of ASL-8123, the primary metabolite of esmolol, which possesses beta-antagonist properties. Although postbypass ventricular function is similar in both groups, MMC appears to be superior in terms of ischemia avoidance and myocardial edema formation.", 
    "64": "The influence of the calcium channel blocker verapamil on the sensitivity of mouse fibrosarcoma cells of the line EMT-6 to treatment with Photofrin II (PII) or tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphine (TPPS4) and light has been assessed. Cells were treated with 1.5 microg/ml PII or 75 microg/ml TPPS4 overnight in the absence or presence of 50 microg/ml verapamil and subsequently exposed to light. Verapamil increased the sensitivity of the EMT-6 cells to PII-induced photoinactivation by a factor of 2. In contrast, verapamil decreased the sensitivity of the cells to TPPS4-induced photoinactivation by 50-60%. Both sensitizers were found to be located to a large extent in lysosomes as revealed by fluorescence microscopy and by photochemical inactivation of the lysosomal marker enzyme beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase. Verapamil increased the uptake of PII by 30% and reduced the uptake of TPPS4 by 20%. Furthermore, verapamil enhanced the binding and uptake of LDL by about 40%. In conclusion, the effects of verapamil-induced sensitization of EMT-6 cells treated with PII or TPPS4 and light can to a large extent be attributed to the modulatory effects of verapamil on endocytosis.", 
    "65": "Very large volumes of serum/plasma can be directly injected to a new extraction column based on particles with a biocompatible outer surface and C18 groups within the pores. The biocompatibility has been obtained by attaching the human plasma protein alpha 1-acid glycoprotein to the outer surface of the particles. The pores are small enough to exclude the plasma protein molecules. Atenolol and propranolol were extracted on the extraction column as ion-pair with octanesulfonic acid as the counterion. The same counterion was used in the analytical mobile phase. A strong improvement of the recovery can be obtained using octanesulfonic acid as counterion in the extraction mobile phase. The recovery of atenolol increased from about 53.5% to about 93.4% using octanesulfonic acid as counterion. The chromatographic performance was also strongly affected by chromatography of the basic drugs as ion-pair with octanesulfonic acid. The improvement was due to trapping in a smaller section of the extraction column and enrichment of the drug on top of the analytical column. The enrichment was due to the transfer of the analyte to the analytical column in a zone with high concentration of counterion. Furthermore, the sample zone is compressed during the migration on the analytical column. The compression effect was caused by the counterion zone, migrating in front of the sample zone, giving the analyte higher retention on the front side than on the back side of the sample zone. Displacement of protein bound drug (ibuprofen) by addition of octanoic acid, was tested in order to study the influence on the recovery and the effect on the chromatographic performance. The recovery was improved and the chromatographic performance was greatly improved. The improvement obtained on the separation efficiency of ibuprofen was due to enrichment on top of the analytical column and compression during the migration through the analytical column. The enrichment was caused by a reduction of pH in the sample--octanoic acid zone transferred from the extraction column. The octanoic acid zone migrated in front of the sample zone giving a lower pH in front of the ibuprofen zone than behind. Thus, higher retention occurred in front of than behind the sample zone, which gave rise to compression. The methods developed for atenolol, propranolol and ibuprofen could be used for the determination of serum/plasma concentrations after single doses of the drugs with very high accuracy and precision. Linear calibration graphs were obtained and the r values were > or = 0.9999.", 
    "66": "Release of secretory granules by rat RBL-2H3 mast cells is mediated primarily through activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and elevation of cytosolic free calcium ([Ca++]I). Here, we show that secretion was also dependent on the activation of a cholera toxin-sensitive phospholipase (PL) D in cells stimulated with thapsigargin. Wortmannin, LY294002, butanol, propranolol and Ro31-7549 inhibited responses to variety of secretagogues in a manner consistent with the notion that secretion was regulated by both PLD and PKC in a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-dependent manner. The effects of these inhibitors, however, were especially pronounced in cells activated by thapsigargin. This stimulant induced minimal stimulation of PLC but measurable activation of PLD, as assessed by formation of phosphatidylethanol in the presence of ethanol. The activation of PLD was suppressed by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and was dependent on a rise in [Ca++]i because thapsigargin failed to activate PLD and secretion when elevation of [Ca++]i was blocked. Treatment of cells with cholera toxin resulted in selective and similar enhancements in the activation of PLD and secretion by thapsigargin, whereas stimulation of PLC and PLA2 was unaffected. A role for PKC was indicated by the blockade of secretory response to thapsigargin by the PKC inhibitor Ro31-7549 and by the ability of the PKC agonist phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate to reverse the inhibition of secretion by inhibitors of PLD. Such results suggested that thapsigargin, by causing substantial increases in [Ca++]I, induced secondary signals via PLD and PKC that synergized a calcium signal for secretion.",

In normotensive rats, SCH 58261, at 10 mg/kg i.p., significantly (P < .05) inhibited hypotension and tachycardia induced by the A2A receptor agonist 2-hexynyl-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (0.01 mg/kg i.p.), but not the bradycardic effect caused by the A1 receptor agonist 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine (0.03 mg/kg i.p.). SCH 58261, when administered alone, at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg i.p., did not induce significant hemodynamic changes, but at 10 mg/kg i.p., it slightly increased both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (+19 +/- 3 and +16 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively; P < . 01) and heart rate (HR) (+85 +/- 5 beats/min; P < .01). These effects were inhibited by adrenergic blockade with propranolol (30 mg/kg i.p.) and phentolamine (10 mg/kg i.p.): -5 +/- 3 mm Hg on DBP and -12 +/- 11 beats/min on HR (P < .01). In spontaneously hypertensive rats, SCH 58261, at 3 and 10 mg/kg i.p., increased weakly both SBP (+19 +/- 5 mm Hg and +25 +/- 4 mm Hg) and DBP (+14 +/- 4 mm Hg and +23 +/- 4 mm Hg) vs. vehicle (P < .01) and HR (+45 +/- 17 and +64 +/- 18 beats/min vs. vehicle, respectively; P < .01). The data indicate that SCH 58261 retains A2A selective receptor antagonist properties in vivo. Its effect on cardiovascular sympathetic outflow further suggests that endogenous adenosine exerts a tonic vascular regulation through A2A receptors. Therefore, SCH 58261 can be a useful pharmacological tool for clarifying A2A-mediated cardiovascular actions of adenosine.",

One-hour exposure to cocaine did not alter Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity, as measured by the ouabain-sensitive component of rubidium uptake. Four days of cocaine resulted in an approximately 30% decrease in Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity. Western blot analyses demonstrated an approximately 25% decrease in levels of the beta-1 isoform, without changes in pump total alpha subunit levels. Treatment with dopamine type 1 or type 2 receptor agonists for the same period did not affect Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity. The serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor paroxetine caused an approximately 45% decrease in rubidium uptake after 4 days, whereas pump function was not altered after treatment with either the dopamine-selective reuptake blocker nomifensine or the norepinephrine-selective reuptake blocker desipramine. Chronic treatment with both cocaine and LY 278,584, a serotonin type 3 receptor antagonist, did not replicate the cocaine-associated decrease in pump function. Long-term cocaine exposure regulates expression and function of the Na+/K(+)-ATPase pump in neuronal-like cells; this regulation is mediated in part via the serotonin type 3 receptor.

To elucidate its electrophysiological and potential proarrhythmic effects relative to those of dl-sotalol in vivo, serial changes in ECGs, endocardial and epicardial monophasic action potential durations, and left and right ventricular pressures were measured simultaneously in pentobarbital-anesthetized open-chest dogs. Complete heart block was produced by the injection of 37% formaldehyde into the atrioventricular node. Intravenous administration of MS-551 produced prolongation of action potential duration at 90% repolarization time (APD90) immediately after the beginning of infusion and reached plateau at 10 min. MS-551 (1 mg/kg) caused 73 +/- 8% increase in APD90 and 28 +/- 5% increase in QTc at basic cycle length of 700 msec. The maximal prolongation of APD90 induced by 1 mg/kg MS-551 was 39% greater than that by the same dose of sotalol (P < .01). The dose-response curve of prolongation of ventricular effective refractory period produced by MS-551 was shifted significantly to the left compared with that induced by sotalol. The EC50 was 0.5 +/- 0.1 mg/kg and 1.2 +/- 0.2 mg/kg for MS-551 and sotalol, respectively (P < .05). When 0.5 mg/kg MS-551 doses were used, no ventricular arrhythmia was induced by stimulation at 200-msec basic cycle length. When 1.5 mg/kg sotalol was administered, 5 of 15 developed torsade de pointes, 2 of 15 developed ventricular fibrillation and 5 of 15 developed sustained ventricular tachycardia. The idioventricular rates and left ventricular pressures were reduced significantly by sotalol, not by MS-551. In conclusion, MS-551 is a potent class III antiarrhythmic agent that selectively prolongs repolarization in the ventricular myocardium and appears to be devoid of autonomic effects.

The patients were divided into three groups and received sotalol, propafenone, and procainamide, respectively. Before and after taking the drugs for 14 days, these patients received treadmill exercise test, 24 h Holter electrocardiogram, and tilt table test for evaluation of the exercise performance and the variability of ventricular rate (including the mean RR intervals, mRR, the standard deviation of RR intervals, SDRR, and the root mean square of the difference in successive RR intervals, rMSSD). All these antiarrhythmic drugs could suppress ventricular arrhythmia but only sotalol could significantly increase the exercise duration (374+/-50 to 476+/-55 s, P=0.02), and reduce the maximal heart rate (186+/-23 to 136+/-16 beats/min, P=0.01) during exercise test.

With head-up tilt, the mRR, SDRR and rMSSD all decreased significantly before drug therapy, and these changes were still present only after propafenone therapy. Therefore, comparisons among sotalol, propafenone and procainamide showed that sotalol increased the exercise performance and the variability of ventricular rate in patients who had chronic atrial fibrillation complicated with symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "116": "The therapeutical approach to arterial hypertension in the general population is now relatively well classified, whereas it remains a controversial problem in dialytic patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antihypertensive drugs used in dialytic patients in Piedmont and to identify correlations with other personal and clinical data. The authors analysed the data in the Piedmont Dialysis and Transplant Register concerning new patients admitted to dialysis during the period 1990-1995 (2,664 patients at 31/12/1995) and 1,373 patients who began dialysis during the period 1990-1993. A study of the antihypertensive drugs using in single and combined therapy over the five-year period shows major variations in the 45-65 year-old age bracket (increased ACE-inhibitors in single therapy, 15.5-25.6%, increased vasodilators in combined therapy, 15.3-21%). In patients aged > or = 65 years old a slight increase was found in the use of beta-blockers in monotherapy. Antihypertensive drugs at the 1st control (1990-1995 entries) appeared to be stable over the five-year period. From the 1,373 patients who started dialysis in the period 1990-1993, with at least three subsequent controls, the authors selected those hypertensive or normotensive patients receiving ACE-inhibitor therapy (best survival in general population) and compared their survival with that of patients receiving alternative antihypertensive treatment. No significant differences were found. The stability of the antihypertensive drugs taken by these patients over the past 5 years backs the hypothesis of a greater attention paid by nephrologists to the introduction of new drugs, both because of the frequent onset of collateral effects and owing to the special pharmacokinetics present in dialytic patients.", 
    "117": "Prolongation of the QT interval and increased QT dispersion have been proposed to be associated with arrhythmic risk after myocardial infarction. However, controversy remains regarding the prognostic value of ventricular repolarization abnormalities in the risk stratification of patients surviving acute myocardial infarction. HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVE: The QT interval is sensitive to myocardial ischaemia, and exercise-induced ischaemia may change the QT interval regionally, resulting in increased QT dispersion. This study examined whether there are abnormalities of ventricular repolarization during exercise and whether assessment of the exercise-induced changes in QT interval duration and dispersion would be able to differentiate patients at high risk from those at low risk of sudden cardiac death after myocardial infarction.", 
    "118": "Twenty-six post-myocardial infarction patients (mean age 54.5+/-8.9 years, 22 men) were retrospectively studied. Thirteen patients who died suddenly (SCD patients) during a follow-up of 39+/-6 months were compared to 13 patients who remained event-free, i.e. no ventricular tachyarrhythmias, no reinfarction, no by-pass (MI survivors). The two groups were pair-matched for age, gender, site of infarction, left ventricular ejection fraction and use of beta blocker. A further 13 patients with chest pain, normal coronary arteriograms and negative exercise test results were studied as controls. They were age and gender matched with the post-infarction patients. A 12-lead exercise ECG was recorded from each patient before, during and after exercise. QT and RR interval were measured on the exercise ECGs at each stage and QT dispersion was defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum QT intervals across the 12-lead ECG.", 
    "119": "There were no significant differences in RR, QT and QTc (Bazett's and Fridericia's correction) intervals, or QT dispersion between any groups before exercise. A significant difference in QT and QT dispersion was found at peak exercise between post-infarction patients and controls (P=0.03 and P=0.0001, respectively), but no difference was observed between SCD patients and MI survivors. The maximum QTc at peak exercise was longer in SCD patients compared with MI survivors (P=0.02) and a maximum QTc>440 ms (Bazett's correction) was common in SCD patients but not in MI survivors or controls (62%, 15%, 15%, P=0.01). The differences in QT, QTc or QT dispersion observed at peak exercise were no longer significant after exercise.", 
    "120": "Exercise-induced prolongation of the QTc interval differentiates patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death from those at low risk, whereas exercise-induced changes in QT dispersion failed to identify patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death after myocardial infarction.", 
    "121": "Effect of oxatomide on release and production of platelet-activating factor (PAF) in neutrophils obtained from asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients was investigated. Neutrophils were preincubated with or without oxatomide and stimulated with N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (f-MLP, 10 microM) for 15 min. PAF activity was detected by aggregation of washed guinea pig platelets. PAF activity released from asthmatic neutrophils without preincubation of oxatomide was 7.97[0.22] (mean[SEM], ng/10(7) cells) in supernatants and 33.4[0.26] in cell pellets. After preincubation with 10(-8), 10(-6), and 10(-4) M of oxatomide, PAF activity reduced to 6.77[0.37] (mean[SEM], ng/10(7) cells), 3.99[0.25], and 0.96[0.05] (n = 15) in the supernatants, and 22.4[0.31], 16.7[0.22], and 6.35[0.11] (n = 15) in the cell pellets, respectively. PAF activity in non-asthmatic neutrophils without preincubation of oxatomide was 6.35[0.12] (mean[SEM], ng/10(7) cells) in supernatants and 27.9[0.25] in cell pellets. After preincubation with 10(-8), 10(-6), and 10(-4) M of oxatomide, PAF activity reduced to 5.02[0.16] (mean [SEM], ng/10(7) cells), 3.96[0.11], and 0.94[0.03] (n = 10) in the supernatants, and 28.4[0.69], 13.78[0.17], and 2.88[0.27] (n = 10) in the cell pellets, respectively. Our results showed that preincubation with oxatomide caused a dose-dependent inhibition of intra- and extracellular PAF activity from asthmatic and non-asthmatic neutrophils in the same manner.", 
    "122": "The mechanisms by which beta adrenergic stimulation regulates phagocytosis of Candida albicans by human peripheral monocytes (HPM) are characterized. Isoproterenol (ISO) inhibits phagocytosis in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was blunted by propranolol, inhibitors of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase and verapamil, pointing to a participation of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites and calcium in the phenomenon. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (db-cAMP) also exerted the same inhibitory effect on phagocytosis. ISO interacts with beta adrenergic receptors of HPM increasing PGE2 and cAMP. We conclude that the mechanisms by which beta adrenergic stimulation regulates phagocytosis of Candida albicans by HPM appear to be secondary to beta adrenoceptor-mediated hydrolysis of AA accompanied by an increase in PGE2 generation and cAMP production. Both PGE2 and cAMP could act as mediators of the inhibitory action of beta agonists on the HPM-phagocytosis process.", 
    "123": "Hypertension frequently occurs during the immediate postoperative period in children after repair of aortic coarctation but may also occur after repair of other congenital heart defects. Nitroprusside has often been used to control blood pressure in this setting. Because hypertension after coarctation repair is frequently associated with elevations in catecholamines, esmolol, a short-acting beta-blocking agent, may be an effective alternative. Therefore we undertook the first systematic investigation to determine the efficacy and disposition of esmolol in pediatric patients with acute hypertension after cardiac operations.", 
    "124": "Twenty patients aged 1 month to 12 years (median 25.6 months) with acute hypertension after cardiac operations received esmolol in an opened-labeled trial. Esmolol was titrated to a blood pressure less than or equal to the 90th percentile for age.", 
    "125": "Ten patients had coarctation repair and the remaining patients underwent repair of other congenital heart defects. On final esmolol dose (mean +/- standard deviation dosage 700 +/- 232 microg/kg/min) there was a significant percent decrease in heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures from postoperative values. Esmolol dose was significantly associated with percent reduction in systolic blood pressure. Final esmolol dose and total body clearance were significantly higher in patients after coarctation repair. There were significant associations between esmolol dose and esmolol blood concentrations at steady state.", 
    "126": "The dosage required to control hypertension in patients after repair of aortic coarctation was higher than patients who underwent repair of other congenital heart defects. Esmolol was effective in controlling blood pressure in 19 of 20 patients without adverse effects.", 
    "127": "This report describes clinical, hemodynamic, and electrophysiologic characteristics of 18 consecutive survivors of sudden cardiac arrest due to idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) between 1986 and 1996. Long-term data in relation to the prescribed therapy are presented. The mean age of the 18 patients was 48 +/- 14 years (median 49). Electrophysiologic studies showed a low inducibility of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias in 4 patients (22%). Treatment consisted of class III agents, beta blockers, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. Two patients were discharged without any therapy. Therapy control was undertaken either by serial drug testing or by the empirical approach. Serious complications of therapy occurred in 2 patients: 1 patient experienced a proarrhythmic effect of antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and the other patient received multiple inadequate defibrillator discharges due to a defect in the transvenous lead. All but 1 patient (94%) remained free of recurrences of sudden cardiac arrest during a follow-up time of 45 +/- 29 months (median 41). One patient died 2 weeks after surviving cardiac arrest due to intractable VF while receiving sotalol treatment. Therapy guided by electrophysiologic studies did not have any impact on survival. Adverse effects or noncompliance led to discontinuation of drug therapy in 7 patients after a mean period of 31 +/- 30 months. Without any treatment 9 patients remained without recurrences over 45 +/- 33 months. Because of the absence of risk factors for arrhythmia recurrence and criteria to select therapy, randomized prospective studies are warranted to assess the optimal therapies in these young, ostensibly healthy patients.", 
    "128": "To compare the safety and efficacy of amiodarone and sotalol in the treatment of patients with recurrent symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF), 70 patients were entered into a randomized, double-blind study. Of these, 35 received amiodarone and 35 sotalol. There were no significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics between groups. Patients with ejection fraction < 40% or clinically significant heart disease were excluded. Patients randomized to amiodarone began with 800 to 1,600 mg/day for 7 to 14 days orally. After the initial loading phase, the drug dose was tapered to maintenance levels over 7 to 12 days; thereafter, therapy was generally maintained at a dosage of 200 mg/day. The sotalol dosage was 80 to 360 mg twice daily, as tolerated. Follow-up clinical evaluations were conducted at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months. The proportion of patients remaining in sinus rhythm on each agent was calculated for the 2 groups using the Kaplan-Meier method. Ten of the 35 patients who were taking amiodarone developed AF during the 12-month observation period, compared with 21 of the 35 who were taking sotalol (p = 0.008). No significant effect of sex, age, left atrial size, or type of AF could be detected that increased the risk of development of AF. We conclude that both amiodarone and sotalol can be used for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm in patients with recurrent symptomatic AF but that amiodarone is the more effective of the 2 drugs for this purpose.", 
    "129": "To evaluate the potential prognostic value of the circadian variation of QT intervals in predicting sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients after myocardial infarction (MI), 15 pairs of post-MI patients (15 died suddenly within 1 year after MI [SCD victims] and 15 remained event-free [MI survivors]) were studied (mean age 60 +/- 8 years; 24 men and 6 women). The pairs were matched for age, gender, infarct site, presence of Q wave, left ventricular ejection fraction, thrombolytic and beta-blocker therapy. Fourteen normal subjects served as controls (mean age 55 +/- 9 years; 12 men). A 24-hour Holter electrocardiographic (ECG) recording was obtained from each subject. All recordings were analyzed using a Holter ECG analyser. QT, RR, and heart rate-corrected QT intervals (QTc) were automatically calculated by the analyzer, and hourly and 24-hour mean values of each measurement were derived from each recording. There was a pronounced circadian variation in the QT interval in parallel with the trend in the RR interval in normal subjects and in MI survivors. Circadian variation in both indexes was blunted in SCD victims. The QT interval was significantly longer at night than during the day in normal subjects (388 +/- 28 vs 355 +/- 21 ms, p = 0.001) and in MI survivors (358 +/- 25 vs 346 +/- 15 ms, p = 0.008), but not in SCD victims (357 +/- 32 vs 350 +/- 31 ms, p = 0.6). The 24-hour mean value of the QT interval in SCD victims did not differ significantly from that in normal subjects or MI survivors. The QT interval at night was significantly shorter in SCD victims than in normal subjects (357 +/- 32 vs 388 +/- 28 ms, p = 0.02), but daytime values were similar. The QT interval in SCD victims did not differ significantly from that of MI survivors at any time. The QTc interval exhibited a small circadian variation in normal subjects. This variation was abolished in SCD victims and MI survivors. The 24-hour mean value of QTc was significantly longer in SCD victims than in normal subjects (424 +/- 25 vs 402 +/- 21 ms, p = 0.02), and in MI survivors (424 +/- 25 vs 404 +/- 32 ms, p < 0.05). The QTc interval of SCD victims differed from that of normal subjects during both the day (421 +/- 25 vs 400 +/- 17 ms, p = 0.02) and night (424 +/- 26 vs 403 +/- 23 ms, p = 0.03). Thus, blunted circadian variation in QT intervals, abolished circadian variation in QTc intervals, and prolonged QTc intervals may suggest an increased risk of SCD in patients after MI.", 
    "130": "The compound 2,3,5,6-Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP; Ligustrazine), a flavouring component and sweetness enhancer for beverages constitutes a commonly used food additive. Now we studied the effect of TMP on coronary artery dilation during ischemia: In our experiments we used isolated, Langendorff-perfused guinea pig hearts, arrested with K(+)-rich Normal Tyrode solution (in mM: NaCl 129.5, KCl 15, MgCl2 0.8, CaCl2 1.0, glucose 10), buffered with 10 mM HEPES to pH 7.4 at 37 degrees C, equilibrated with 100% O2. Ischemia was simulated by equimolar replacement of glucose by 2-deoxyglucose (DOG), an inhibitor of oxydative phosphorylation. We found that coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) decreased by 20 +/- 1.2 cm H2O (from initially 90 cm H2O; n = 6, +/- SEM) within 15 min from the onset of DOG. In the presence of 1 mM TMP the decrease in CPP was largely attenuated and CPP declined by 1.4 +/- 1.0 cm H2O (n = 6, +/- SEM; p < 0.01). In 2 out of the 6 TMP experiments even as light increase in CPP (< 2 cm H2O) could be seen. We conclude that TMP, a blocker of ATP-dependent K(+)-channels in pancreatic beta-cells and possibly in arterial smooth muscle cells, prevents coronary dilation in response to ischemia. The possible suppression of this vital mobilization of coronary reserve during ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease certainly merits further attention and may question the use of this compound as a food additive.", 
    "131": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep results in profound state-dependent alterations in heart rate. The present study describes a novel phenomenon of a primary deceleration in heart rate that is not preceded or followed by increases in heart rate or arterial blood pressure and occurs primarily during tonic REM sleep. The goals were to characterize the primary decelerations and to provide insights on the underlying central and peripheral autonomic mechanisms. Cats were chronically implanted with electrodes to record electroencephalogram, pontogeniculooccipital wave activity in lateral geniculate nucleus, hippocampal theta rhythm, electromyogram, electrooculogram, respiration (diaphragm), and electrocardiogram. Arterial blood pressure was monitored from a carotid artery catheter. R-R interval fluctuations were continuously tracked using customized software. The muscarinic blocking agent glycopyrrolate (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) and the beta-adrenergic blocking agent atenolol (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) were administered in alternating sequence with a 90- to 120-min interval. Glycopyrrolate immediately eliminated the decelerations during REM sleep. Atenolol alone had no effect on their frequency. These findings suggest that a change in the centrally induced pattern of autonomic activity to the heart is responsible for the primary decelerations, namely, a bursting of cardiac vagal efferent fiber activity.", 
    "132": "The role of receptor phosphorylation on the redistribution of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) in rat hearts during different phases of sepsis was investigated. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Changes in the distribution of beta-ARs in the sarcolemmal and light vesicle fractions were studied using (-)-[4,6-propyl-3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA). Phosphorylation of beta-ARs was studied by perfusing hearts with [32P]H3PO4 followed by identification of the phosphorylated beta-ARs with immunoprecipitation using anti-beta 1-AR antibody. The results show that septic rat hearts exhibit an initial hypercardiodynamic (9 h after CLP; early sepsis) and a subsequent hypocardiodynamic (18 h after CLP; late sepsis) state. [3H]DHA binding studies show that, during early sepsis, the maximum binding capacity (Bmax) was increased by 26% in sarcolemma but was decreased by 30% in light vesicles, whereas, during late sepsis, the Bmax was decreased by 39% in sarcolemma but increased by 31% in light vesicles. These data indicate that beta-ARs in the rat heart were externalized from light vesicles to sarcolemma during early sepsis but were internalized from surface membranes to intracellular sites during late sepsis. The immunoprecipitation studies reveal that the externalization of beta-ARs during early sepsis was coupled with a concomitant decrease (-28.5 to -30.6%, P < 0.01) in the receptor phosphorylation, whereas the internalization of beta-ARs during late sepsis was accompanied by a simultaneous increase (30.3 to 33.8%, P < 0.01) in the receptor phosphorylation. Because the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of beta 1-ARs regulate their functional coupling and may reflect their subcellular distribution, it is suggested that the increase in receptor phosphorylation seen in late sepsis leads to the receptor internalization observed in late sepsis; similarly, externalization of (dephosphorylated) receptors in early sepsis may give rise to the apparent decrease in sarcolemmal receptor phosphorylation observed during this interval.", 
    "133": "We examined the role of beta 2-adrenergic receptors (ARs) in modulating calcium homeostasis in rat ventricular myocytes. Zinterol (10 microM), an agonist with a 25-fold greater affinity for beta 2-ARs over beta 1-ARs, modestly enhanced L-type calcium current (ICa) magnitude by approximately 30% and modestly accelerated the rate of Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) decline (approximately 35%) but had little effect on the magnitude of the [Ca2+] transient (a nonsignificant 6% increase). However, 1 microM of the highly selective beta 1-AR antagonist CGP-20712A completely blocked the ICa increase induced by 10 microM zinterol. Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin (PTX) did not alter ICa enhancement by 10 microM zinterol, although it did abolish the ability of acetylcholine to block the forskolin-induced enhancement of ICa. Zinterol (10 microM) approximately doubled adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation, although one-half of this increase was blocked by CGP-20712A. In contrast, 1 microM of the nonselective beta-agonist isoproterenol increased cAMP production 15-fold. Thus we found no evidence that activation of beta 2-ARs modulates calcium homeostasis in rat ventricular myocytes, even after treatment with PTX.", 
    "134": "We investigated the frequency components of fluctuations in heart rate, arterial pressure, respiration, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in 11 healthy women using an autoregressive model and examined the relation among variables using Akaike's relative power contribution analysis with multivariate autoregressive model fitting. Power spectral analysis of MSNA revealed two peaks, with low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) components. The LF component of MSNA was a major determinant of the LF component of arterial pressure and R-R interval variability (0.70 +/- 0.07 and 0.18 +/- 0.05, respectively). The effect of the LF component of MSNA on arterial pressure showed no change in response to propranolol but was diminished (0.35 +/- 0.08) by phentolamine (P < 0.02). The effect of the LF component of MSNA on R-R interval was not altered by pharmacological sympathetic nerve blockade. The HF component of MSNA did not influence other variables but was influenced by R-R interval, arterial pressure, and respiration. These findings indicate that the LF component of MSNA reflects autonomic oscillations, whereas the HF component is passive and influenced by other cardiovascular variables.", 
    "135": "beta 1-Adrenergic receptors (beta 1-ARs) are key targets of sympathetic nervous system activity and play a major role in the beat-to-beat regulation of cardiac chronotropy and inotropy. We employed a beta 1-AR gene knockout model to test the hypothesis that beta 1-AR function is critical for maintenance of resting heart rate and baroreflex responsiveness and, on the basis of its important role in regulating chronotropy and inotropy, is also required for maximal exercise capacity. Using an awake unrestrained mouse model, we demonstrate that resting heart rate and blood pressure are normal in beta 1-AR knockouts and that the qualitative responses to baroreflex stimulation are intact. Chronotropic reserve in beta 1-AR knockouts is markedly limited, with peak heart rates approximately 200 beats/min less than wild types. During graded treadmill exercise, heart rate is significantly depressed in beta 1-AR knockouts at all work loads, but despite this limitation, there are no reductions in maximal exercise capacity or metabolic indexes. Thus, in mice, the beta 1-AR is not essential for either maintenance of resting heart rate or for maximally stressed cardiovascular performance.", 
    "136": "Our goal was to determine the contributions of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity to entropy measures of heart rate variability (HRV). We compared our results with two commonly used methods to analyze HRV: standard deviation (SDNN) and power spectral analysis (HF norm). Beat-by-beat analysis of R-R intervals was performed in conscious dogs. The R-R intervals were analyzed with approximate entropy (ApEn) and entropy of symbolic dynamics (SymDyn) to assess the effects of reducing system complexity. This was achieved by pharmacologically inhibiting sympathetic, parasympathetic, and total autonomic nervous system regulation of heart rate. Three conditions were examined: rest, standing, and systemic hypotension. At rest or standing, sympathetic inhibition (propranolol) had no effect on ApEn or SymDyn, whereas parasympathetic (atropine) and combined (propranolol + atropine) inhibition reduced both entropy measures to near zero. Systemic hypotension reduced both entropy measures in intact dogs. When hypotension was induced after sympathetic inhibition, ApEn was increased compared with hypotension alone, whereas parasympathetic inhibition with hypotension resulted in near-zero ApEn. Changes in the entropy measures of HRV were directionally similar to changes in SDNN and HF norm. These results indicate that the entropy of R-R intervals reflects parasympathetic modulation of heart rate.", 
    "137": "The prevalence and predisposing conditions for primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) were examined in The Framingham Study based on 16 years of follow-up of a cohort of 4182 men and women. The association with atypical chest pain and migraine headache was also investigated. Over the 16 years of follow-up there were 130 men and 171 women who developed primary RP. The prevalence in women (9.6%) was somewhat higher than in men (8.1%) and 81.4% of the RP was primary. Secondary RP was equally prevalent in men (18.6%) and women (19.7%). The most common causes of secondary RP were beta-blocker use (34.2%), carpal tunnel syndrome (10.5%) and rheumatoid arthritis (7.2%). Primary RP cases differed from noncases by having lower systolic blood pressure (p < or = 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.0001), and more coronary disease (p = 0.009), smoking (p < or = 0.01) and higher blood sugars (p < or = 0.009). Atypical chest pain was present more often than noted previously in The Framingham Study general population survey, and was equally prevalent in primary and secondary RP and in the two sexes. Associated migraine was more prevalent in women (14.4%) than men (5.0%). Vibrating tool use with associated RP occurred in 14.6%.", 
    "138": "1. We examined the relationships between membrane potential, intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i), and tension in muscles of the canine gastric fundus in response to nitrergic stimulation by NO donors and electrical field stimulation (EFS) of intrinsic enteric inhibitory neurons when adrenergic and cholinergic responses were blocked. 2. NO donors reduced [Ca2+]i and tension in a concentration-dependent manner. A close relationship was noted between these parameters. 3. In terms of the [Ca2+] vs. force relationship, relaxation responses to EFS differed from responses to NO donors. EFS resulted in smaller decreases in [Ca2+]i to produce a given relaxation compared with responses to NO donors. Thus, muscles stimulated with EFS were less sensitive to [Ca2+]i than muscles stimulated with exogenous NO. 4. When membrane potential, [Ca2+]i and tension were monitored simultaneously in the same muscles, a temporal dissociation was noted between the electrical responses and changes in [Ca2+]i and tension. Brief electrical responses were associated with more sustained changes in [Ca2+]i and tension. 5. Further dissociation between electrical and mechanical effects was noted. Changes in [Ca2+]i and tension caused by sodium nitroprusside and EFS were blocked by arginine analogues and by oxyhaemoglobin, but electrical responses were unaffected. 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4, 3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), an inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase, also blocked the effects of nitrergic stimulation on [Ca2+]i and tension, without affecting hyperpolarization. Thus, in the presence of continued hyperpolarization, the reductions in [Ca2+]i and tension caused by nitrergic stimulation were blocked. 6. Block of hyperpolarization in response to nitrergic stimulation with tetrapentylammonium chloride (TPEA) had relatively little effect on the [Ca2+]i and tension responses. Thus, hyperpolarization is not required for nitrergic effects on [Ca2+]i and tension. 7. In summary, reduction in [Ca2+]i and tension in response to nitrergic stimulation of the canine gastric fundus does not depend upon electrical hyperpolarization. Non-electrical mechanisms such as enhanced uptake of Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum or reduction in the Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus may be the primary mechanisms mediating nitrergic responses in these muscles.", 
    "139": "1. The whole-cell perforated-patch recording mode was used to record a Ca2+-dependent K+ current (IK(Ca)) in mouse betaTC-3 insulin-secreting cells. 2. Depolarizing voltage steps (to potentials where Ca2+ currents are activated) evoked a slowly activating, outward current, which exhibited a slow deactivation (in seconds) upon subsequent hyperpolarization. 3. This current was shown to increase with progressively longer depolarizing voltage steps. It could be reversibly abolished by the removal of Ca2+ from the external medium or by application of Ca2+ channel blockers, such as Cd2+ and nifedipine. It was concluded that the depolarization-evoked current was activated by Ca2+. 4. Variations in external K+ concentration led to shifts in the reversal potential of the Ca2+-dependent current as predicted by the Nernst equation for a K+-selective current. 5. The Ca2+-activated K+ current was insensitive to external TEA (10 mM), a concentration sufficient to block the large-conductance Ca2+-dependent (maxi-KCa) channel in beta-cells. It was also insensitive to apamin, tubocurarine and scyllatoxin (leiurotoxin I), specific blockers of small-conductance KCa channels. 6. The current was blocked by quinine, a non-specific KCa channel blocker and, surprisingly, by charybdotoxin (ChTX; 100 nM) but not iberiotoxin, a charybdotoxin analogue, which blocks the maxi-KCa channel. It was sensitive to block by clotrimazole and could be potently and reversibly potentiated by micromolar concentrations of niflumic acid. Thus, the current exhibited unique pharmacological characteristics, not conforming to the known KCa channel classes. 7. The ChTX-sensitive KCa channel was permeable to Tl+, K+, Rb+ and NH4+ but not Cs+ ions. 8. The ChTX-sensitive IK(Ca) could be activated by the muscarinic agonists in the presence or absence of external Ca2+, presumably by releasing Ca2+ from internal stores. 9. Acutely isolated porcine islet cells also exhibited a slow IK(Ca) resembling that described in betaTC-3 cells in kinetic properties, insensitivity to TEA (5 mM) and sensitivity to quinidine, an analogue of quinine. The porcine IK(Ca), however, was not sensitive to block by 100-200 nM ChTX. It is likely, that species differences account for pharmacological differences between the mouse and porcine slow IK(Ca).", 
    "140": "Some blockers of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors cause cardiostimulant effects through an atypical beta-adrenoceptor (putative beta4-adrenoceptor) that resembles the beta3-adrenoceptor. It is likely but not proven that the putative beta4-adrenoceptor is genetically distinct from the beta3-adrenoceptor. We therefore investigated whether or not the cardiac atypical beta-adrenoceptor could mediate agonist effects in mice lacking a functional beta3-adrenoceptor gene (beta3 KO). (-)-CGP 12177, a beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor blocker that causes agonist effects through both beta3-adrenoceptors and cardiac putative beta4-adrenoceptors, caused cardiostimulant effects that were not different in atria from wild-type (WT) mice and beta3 KO mice. The effects of (-)-CGP 12177 were resistant to blockade by (-)-propranolol (200 nM) but were blocked by (-)-bupranolol (1 microM) with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 15 nM in WT and 17 nM in beta3 KO. (-)-[3H]CGP 12177 labeled a similar density of the putative beta4-adrenoceptor in ventricular membranes from the hearts of both WT (Bmax = 52 fmol/mg protein) and beta3 KO (Bmax = 53 fmol/mg protein) mice. The affinity of (-)-[3H]CGP 12177 for the cardiac putative beta4-adrenoceptor was not different between WT (Kd = 46 nM) and beta3 KO (Kd= 40 nM). These results provide definitive evidence that the cardiac putative beta4-adrenoceptor is distinct from the beta3-adrenoceptor.", 
    "141": "Cardiovascular effects of nicardipine hydrochloride (NIC, CAS 54527-84-3, Perdipine), a calcium channel blocker, were investigated in anesthetized normal dogs and dogs with acute heart failure (AHF), and compared with those of nitroglycerin (NTG). In open-chest anesthetized dogs, NIC (0.1-10 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) dose-dependently increased cardiac output (CO) and coronary blood flow as well as decreased mean blood pressure (MBP). NIC had no effect on heart rate (HR) or maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (max. dp/dt). In contrast (0.1-10 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) decreased MBP, but did not change the other cardiovascular parameters. NIC and NTG did not prolong PQ, QRS or QTc intervals. In addition, NIC was effective in the presence of dobutamine. In the anesthetized dog model of ischemic AHF induced by coronary ligation, and ischemia/angiotensin II-induced AHF, NIC (1 and 3 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) increased CO and stroke volume, and reduced total peripheral resistance without decreasing HR or cardiac contractility. Furthermore, in the ischemia/angiotension II-induced AHF model, NIC decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). In contrast, NTG (1-10 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) decreased LVEDP in both AHF models; but did not increase CO. These results suggest that NIC improves hemodynamics in dogs with AHF mainly by reducing afterload without adversely affecting the cardiac contractility or conduction system, while NTG exerts its effect on AHF by reducing preload. NIC injection would thus appear to be beneficial in the treatment of AHF.", 
    "142": "The relationship between myogenin or MyoD expression and hypertrophy of the rat soleus produced either by clenbuterol and 3,3', 5-triiodo-L-thyronine (CT) treatment or by surgical overload was examined. Mature female rats were subjected to surgical overload of the right soleus with the left soleus serving as a control. Another group received the same surgical treatment but were administered CT. Soleus muscles were harvested 4 wk after surgical overload and weighed. Myosin heavy chain isoforms were separated by using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis while myogenin and MyoD expression were evaluated by Northern analysis. CT and functional overload increased soleus muscle weight. CT treatment induced the appearance of the fast type IIX myosin heavy chain isoform, depressed myogenin expression, and induced MyoD expression. However, functional overload did not alter myogenin or MyoD expression in CT-treated or non-CT-treated rats. Thus pharmacologically and surgically induced hypertrophy have differing effects on myogenin and MyoD expression, because their levels were associated with changes in myosin heavy chain composition (especially type IIX) rather than changes in muscle mass.", 
    "143": "This study was undertaken to evaluate the safety and efficacy of switching patients treated with timolol maleate to timolol hemihydrate. In patients with ocular hypertension or chronic open-angle glaucoma treated with beta-blockers for at least three months, we prescribed timolol maleate solution 0.5% given twice daily for one month. We then switched each patient to timolol hemihydrate solution 0.5% (Betimol, Ciba Vision Ophthalmics) given twice daily for three months. This study found over the first three months in 30 completed subjects, using a worse eye analysis, that the intraocular pressure changed from 18.3+/-2.1 mm Hg on timolol maleate to 18.8+/-2.3 mm Hg on timolol hemihydrate (P=0.10) 12 hours after dosing. There was no difference in the overall incidence of unsolicited anterior segment side effects between timolol maleate (4 cases) versus timolol hemihydrate (3 cases) (P=0.69). One patient exited the study because of pain and burning in both eyes while on timolol maleate. No patient was discontinued due to loss of intraocular pressure control after switching to timolol hemihydrate. It was concluded that switching from timolol maleate to timolol hemihydrate is safe and effective in maintaining control of the intraocular pressure.", 
    "144": "A case of long QT syndrome diagnosed in the early neonatal period is described. This full-term female baby had intermittent atrioventricular (AV) block and ventricular tachycardia detected antenatally at the gestational age of 26 weeks. Sinus rhythm with prolonged QT interval (QTc = 0.636 sec) was found soon after birth. She developed variable degree of AV block with alternating left and right bundle branch block, which suggested the presence of multilevel AV block. Her mother had no lupus autoantibodies. Auditory brain stem evoked potential was normal. Family study revealed QT prolongation in her grandmother. Her condition improved after pacemaker implantation and oral beta-blocker usage.", 
    "145": "In the present study the response of the type I inhibitor activity to isoproterenol was used as an indirect index both of cAMP generation and beta-adrenergic receptor reactivity. Our results suggest that nifedipine, after prolonged treatment, produces subsensitivity in beta-adrenergic transmission without changes in the basal level of cAMP. Administration of isoproterenol produced a dose-dependent decrease of the type I inhibitor activity (an endogenous inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, Walsh inhibitor) in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats. Prolonged treatment with nifedipine (5 mg kg-1 i.p., twice daily, 21 days) did not change the basal activity of the type I inhibitor, but markedly reduced the response of the type I inhibitor activity to isoproterenol. In the treated animals a significant decrease of the type I inhibitor was seen when isoproterenol was used in much higher doses than in control rats.", 
    "146": "Gastric acid secretion is suppressed, resulting in a significant rise in gastric pH, when conscious rats are exposed to hypoxia (Yamaji et al., 1996). When adrenal medullectomized rats were exposed to moderate (10.5% O2) hypoxia for 3 h, gastric acid secretion was restored to nearly the level in normoxia by the adrenal medullectomy. In severe (7.6% O2) hypoxia, the operation also caused an increase in the level of gastric acid output, although the extent was lower than that under 10.5% O2 hypoxic conditions. Gastric pH was normalized by the operation even with 7.6% O2 hypoxia. Similar results were obtained when reserpine, which causes an adrenergic discharge, was administered. When an alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocking agent, yohimbine, was administered, the inhibitory effect of 10.5% and 7.6% O2 hypoxia on gastric acid secretion was almost completely removed. However, neither prazosin (an alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker) nor propranolol (a beta-adrenoceptor blocker) showed any significant effects on gastric acid output in hypoxia. These results indicate that acute hypoxia stimulated the adrenergic response from the adrenal medulla, and that gastric acid secretion was consequently suppressed through alpha 2-adrenoceptor.", 
    "147": "To determine the efficacy of combined phacoemulsification--trabeculectomy in preventing early postoperative increases in intraocular pressure (IOP).", 
    "148": "Eighty patients were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Thirty-six patients with cataracts and uncontrolled glaucoma underwent combined phacoemulsification--trabeculectomy, and 44 patients with cataracts underwent phacoemulsification alone. The operations were performed in a standardized manner by one surgeon. IOP was measured at 4 hours, 1 day, and 7 days after surgery. The need for intervention (digital massage, medications) and the presence of complications were documented.", 
    "149": "Four hours after surgery, 5.5% of patients undergoing the combined procedure had IOPs greater than 30 mm Hg, compared with 22.7% of phacoemulsification patients (P < .05). No significant difference in IOP was found between the groups at postoperative day 1 or day 7.", 
    "150": "These results suggest that combined phacoemulsification-trabeculectomy protects against early postoperative elevations in IOP. This finding may influence the surgical management of cataracts in patients with poorly controlled glaucoma and significant compromise of visual field or optic nerve."
