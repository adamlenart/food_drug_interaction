    "0": "The distribution of periodate-positive glycoproteins was studied in parotid acinar cells of the rat after stimulation with the specific beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist prenalterol. After two weeks of daily injections, the majority of secretory granules were larger, less electron dense, and often exhibited a bipartite or pleomorphic PA-CrA-silver staining pattern. A great variation in the staining pattern of the secretory granules was seen among different cells but, within any individual cell, most granules displayed a similar pattern. The staining reaction suggests a mucoid transformation of the granules, or a reorganization of the glycoproteins within the granules. The variation among cells in the staining pattern of granules may suggest that there are different populations of acinar cells or of secretory granules.", 
    "1": "Forty-one patients (21 males and 20 females) suffering from arterial hypertension associated with peripheral and cerebral vascular distress were treated for a period of 60 days with an extempore combination of labetalol (an antihypertensive drug with an alpha- and beta-blocking action) and flunarizine (a calcium-antagonist). Changes in supine and standing arterial blood pressure and in supine heart rate were evaluated periodically. Haematological and urinary controls of a number of biomedical indices were performed in basal conditions and after 60 days. The combination was found to show a rapid efficacy in the entire patient group: both supine and standing systolic and diastolic blood were significantly reduced as early as the tenth day of treatment. No significant changes in heart rate were observed. The combination revealed neither orthostatic hypotensive effects nor side-effects of such a degree of severity as to require reduction of the dose or discontinuation of the treatment.", 
    "2": "The role of the presynaptic alpha and beta-adrenoceptors on the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity was studied in guinea pig atria depolarized with 50 mM K+. The presence of the beta-blocker propranolol (0.1 microM), alpha-blockers phentolamine (0.31 microM) or yohimbine (0.3 microM) or the alpha-agonist clonidine (0.1 microM) in the incubation medium did not affect tyrosine hydroxylase activation by 50 mM K+. On the contrary, the beta-agonist isoproterenol (0.012 microM) potentiated the activation produced by 50 mM K+, effect blocked by propranolol. Also the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 1-methyl-3-isobutyl-xanthine (100 microM), facilitated tyrosine hydroxylase activation by potassium. Isoproterenol might exert its facilitatory effect through the stimulation of presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors, activation of adenyl cyclase and consequent increase of the intraneuronal concentration of cAMP. Noradrenaline synthesis in guinea pig atria depolarized by K+ seems to be unrelated to the stimulation of presynaptic adrenoceptors and also independent of the regulation of neurotransmitter release.", 
    "3": "In summary, cimetidine is a potent inhibitor of liver microsomal activity, which may also decrease hepatic blood flow. Other effects of the drug include inhibition of gastric secretion and intrinsic toxic properties. These effects, combined with the common use of cimetidine in clinical practice, make the risk of adverse drug interactions a relatively frequent risk in the clinical setting. Although a multitude of interactions with cimetidine has been evaluated, many of these are incompletely described or understood. At the present time, a potentially significant alteration of absorption appears to exist with only ketoconazole, elemental iron, vitamin B12 (long-term therapy), and pancreatic enzyme supplements (increased activity). Significant metabolic inhibition or decreased excretion appears to exist with warfarin, propranolol, theophylline, phenytoin, quinidine, possibly lidocaine and procainamide, and certain benzodiazepines. Other potential, but less well ascertained interactions may involve the narcotic analgesics, caffeine, ethanol, pentobarbital, imipramine, chlormethiazole, and metronidazole. In these settings, the clinician must be aware of interaction potential, and astutely monitor the patient during combination therapy. Other data indicate that concomitant administration of antacids may reduce the absorption of cimetidine, that the drug may protect against the toxic effects of acetaminophen overdose, and that combination with certain other myelosuppressants may carry a significant risk. Thus, in regard to these reports, cimetidine is a drug with complex effects on the absorption, elimination, and toxicity of other drugs. When used in the setting of multiple drug therapy, the clinician must be alert to potentially increased or decreased effects of the drugs mentioned in this review. In addition, one must be aware that other hepatically metabolised agents not mentioned here may be affected by the addition of cimetidine therapy. Because of the therapeutic successes demonstrated in the treatment of various disorders with cimetidine, one cannot disregard this agent. Thus, the responsibility for understanding and monitoring for the complex effects of this drug falls with the practicing physician.", 
    "4": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is an important complication of essential hypertension. Some antihypertensive drugs have been shown to allow regression of cardiac hypertrophy, both in spontaneously hypertensive rats and in hypertensive patients. Recent results show that the agents which interfere with the functions of the sympathetic nervous system, converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists are effective in reducing arterial blood pressure and regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. The use of vasodilators and diuretics may under certain circumstances, however, even exacerbate cardiac hypertrophy. Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension does not appear to depend solely on reduction of arterial blood pressure. Other factors seem to modulate the myocardial response to antihypertensive treatment. Included among these mechanisms are neural, humoral, haemodynamic and biochemical factors. The available experimental data further suggest that some functional derangements and biochemical changes associated with hypertrophy may be reversed by antihypertensive treatment. There is, however, insufficient experience with human subjects to determine whether a reduction in left ventricular mass is associated with lower incidences of heart failure or mortality than may be achieved by adequate blood pressure control alone.",

From the results, 50 micrograms of mabuterol proved to be the optimal single dose in terms of effectiveness and tolerability. In a multicenter comparative study, asthmatic patients were treated with 50 or 75 micrograms of mabuterol twice a day for 6 weeks. From the results, 50 micrograms of mabuterol twice a day proved to be optimally effective and tolerable.", 
    "6": "The bronchodilating effect and other related pharmacological properties of dl-1-(4-amino-3-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-2-tert.-butylamino-etha nol hydrochloride (mabuterol) were studied in comparison with those of isoprenaline (isoproterenol), salbutamol and procaterol. In relaxing the isolated normal tracheal muscle in guinea pigs, mabuterol was more potent than isoprenaline and salbutamol, and the effect seemed to be due to the activation of beta-adrenoceptors because it was inhibited by propranolol. In anesthetized guinea pigs, mabuterol given i.v. was less potent but showed a longer duration of action than isoprenaline and salbutamol in inhibiting an increase in the bronchial resistance induced by acetylcholine, histamine and serotonin. When given intraduodenally, it was 1.9-7.8 times more potent than isoprenaline and salbutamol. In conscious guinea pigs, mabuterol given subcutaneously was less potent than isoprenaline and salbutamol in experimental asthma induced by acetylcholine, histamine and antigen, but 26-102 times more potent than the reference bronchodilators when given orally. Chronic oral treatment of mabuterol showed no significant change in the inhibitory effect on the experimental asthma and no development of tolerance was observed. In the maximum increase in the heart rate in conscious guinea pigs, mabuterol given orally was less potent than isoprenaline and salbutamol. Calculation of the selectivity ratio of the drugs for the bronchial muscle vs. cardiac muscle indicated that mabuterol was about 7.4 times more selective for the bronchial muscle than salbutamol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "The problems associated with the design and conduct of experiments involving surveys of human population sister chromatid exchange (SCE) frequencies are discussed. It is suggested that the problems of variation between culture occasions may be overcome by the rigid control of experimental conditions and the inclusion of the same negative controls (herein called \"base controls\") on all culture occasions. In addition, all experimental subjects are cultured, as far as possible, at the same time as controls drawn from the same population and matched for age (+/- 5 yr) and sex. Many factors in such surveys remain uncontrolled but the collection of data on potential environmental mutagen exposure in all subjects is suggested as a mechanism to measure and evaluate such factors. Data are reported on SCE frequencies in lymphocytes from patients receiving 4 separate drugs for chronic conditions. Using a square root transformation of SCE frequencies and the analysis of variance, there is clear evidence for a rise in SCE frequency in patients receiving sulphasalazine (SASP) and azathioprine (Aza). On the other hand, patients receiving atenolol or chlorpropamide show no evidence of a rise in SCE frequency.", 
    "8": "Adverse skin reactions due to betablocking agents are less frequent and severe since the 1974 \"practolol syndrome\". Psoriasiform, eczematous and lichenoid eruptions are the common manifestations with low-titres of auto-antibodies. The exact pathogenesis of these cutaneous reactions is unknown but an immunopharmacological mechanism is the probable cause in the majority of cases. The eruption may appear many months after the initiation of treatment and, in the case of practolol, was followed by sclerosis of the internal organs. Therefore, these cutaneous reactions must be recognised as a signal of possible high toxicity when observed with a high incidence in new betablocking agents.", 
    "9": "Beta-Adrenergic blocking drugs, by occupying beta receptors without stimulating adenylate cyclase, interfere with the physiologic responses mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. This property has led to their application in the cardiovascular disorders on which sympathetic tone either underlies or contributes to the pathogenesis of the process. Lipid solubility, selective beta-receptor blockade, and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity are three additional characteristics of beta blockers that modify the pharmacodynamics and pharmacologic effects of each agent. As the role of the sympathetic nervous system in the pathogenesis of heart disease is better defined, the development of beta blockers with particular pharmacologic profiles and fewer side effects may provide more specific treatment.", 
    "10": "Monotherapy with the calcium antagonists verapamil, nifedipine, nitrendipine or diltiazem was shown to have a good efficacy/tolerability ratio in the treatment of patients with essential hypertension and overall blood pressure responses were comparable as well as similar to those observed with betablockers and diuretics. The antihypertensive effects of the calcium antagonists were directly related to the patient's age, pretreatment blood pressure but indirectly to pretreatment renin. In intraindividual comparisons, antihypertensive responses with verapamil related directly to those obtained with diuretics but indirectly to those seen with betablocker monotherapy. Accordingly, calcium antagonists can be used as first line drugs particularly in older and low renin patients, to a large extent in place of a diuretic, while a betablocker is used primarily for the younger and high renin patients. This concept does not devalue the diuretics, but it may change the order to their use in treatment plan that is oriented towards cardioprotection.", 
    "11": "Experiences in combined use of beta-adrenergic stimulants and cardioselective beta-receptor blocker Talinolol are reported in 3 patients in Status Asthmaticus. High dose Aminophyllintreatment in these 3 severe cases was insufficient, in 1 case it had to be finished because of toxic side effects respectively. For adrenergic stimulation in two cases Orciprenalin i.v. was given initially, in one case Terbutalinsulfat i.v. By cardioselective adrenergic blockade with low dose Talinolol it became possible to prevent cardiotoxic side effects in preexisting tachycardia and premature ventricular contractions. This combination treatment was continued successfully with Terbutalin and Talinolol p.o.", 
    "12": "It was the aim of this study to investigate the effects of the betablocker carazolol (Suacron) on the birth process of the sow. The drug occupies the betareceptors in different organs without causing the stimulation of adrenaline which induces in part the stress reactions of the organism at these receptors. During delivery the stimulation of the betareceptors of the uterus causes a relaxation of the smooth muscles and, hence, prolongs parturition. It could be illustrated that the intravenous injection of the adrenaline-antagonist carazolol (0.5 mg i.e. 1 ml Suacron/50 kg b.w.) increased the contractions of the uterus sub partu in sows. In a double-blind-trial the same dose of the beta-blocker was administered to sows intramuscularly (n = 523). The rate of deliveries lasting six hours or more was reduced (11.0% vs. 14.5%) in the treated group in comparison with the control group (n = 543) that only received a salt solution. Additionally, the beta-blocker prophylaxis led to a reduced stillbirth rate (7.1% vs. 8.3%), caused less necessity for external aid (6.1% vs. 7.8%), decreased the use of oxytocine (28.9% vs. 34.8%) and managed to diminish the occurrence of puerperal disorders (15.5% vs. 19.5%). These beneficial effects on the farrowing are significant at the 5% level and particularly apparent in sows giving birth to the first litter.", 
    "13": "In theory, the pharmaceutical properties of beta-blockers would make their use in hypertension in pregnancy undesirable. Practically, however, these drugs are used more and more in pregnancy. This contradiction has been based on a whole number of clinical trials of which the results have been conflicting. This can be explained by the fact that many of these trials have not been carried out according to a scientific protocol for a trial of a drug. Only random studies are therefore analysed by this author. He concludes that beta-blockers can be used in pregnancy in some cases of hypertension.", 
    "14": "The aims of treatment in acute myocardial infarction are to limit evolving muscle necrosis, prevent heart failure, maintain electrical stability, and preserve the coronary circulation to avoid progressive or recurrent infarction. No single treatment achieves all these objectives. The rationale for the use of adrenoceptor blocking drugs is that they will oppose the effects of the increased sympathomimetic activity which follows acute infarction and which may adversely affect outcome. More is known of the clinical use of pure beta-blockade than of combined alpha- and beta-blockade with labetalol but in theory combined receptor blockade will produce additional beneficial effects over beta-blockade alone. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists have a theoretical role in limiting infarct size. They may reduce the oxygen deficit of jeopardised though potentially viable tissue, limiting infarct size by their favourable effect on heart rate, systolic pressure, contractility, and metabolic pathways. That beta-blockade reduces myocardial damage has been confirmed in animal studies. Studies in man using enzyme release or R wave scoring as indicators of infarct size also suggest that oral or intravenous beta-blockers after infarction encourage myocardial salvage. Few studies have been reported in which the effects of combined alpha- and beta-blockade on infarct size have been determined. The actions of a dual blocking agent are more complex and the outcome less predictable than from beta-blockade alone: the advantages of the beta-blocking component will be retained while the alpha-blocking component may conceivably further diminish oxygen demand by reducing systolic pressure and heart size. Less favourably, coronary perfusion pressure may also fall. It is apparent that further clinical studies are needed. Adrenergic blockade may be used to prevent or treat ventricular arrhythmias which develop after infarction in the face of heightened sympathetic tone and continued ischaemia. Clinical and experimental evidence points to the efficacy of beta-blockade in ischaemia-related arrhythmias, but beta-blockade alone is probably ineffective against arrhythmias arising during reperfusion. In experimental studies, alpha-blockers are effective against both forms of arrhythmia although the doses required for reperfusion effects may produce unacceptable hypotension in clinical use. It is possible that combined alpha- and beta-blockade may have broader antiarrhythmic activity than beta-blockers alone but present clinical data on the value of labetalol in controlling postinfarction arrhythmias are sparse.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "15": "Angina pectoris encompasses a clinically diverse group of syndromes in which the common factor is myocardial ischaemia resulting from an imbalance between oxygen requirement and delivery. Anginal pain is most frequently precipitated by exercise, but may occur without any apparent cause at rest. Fixed obstructions in the coronary vessels, often attended by thickening of the overlying coronary artery media, are the most frequent cause of ischaemic cardiac pain. The resulting myocardial fibrosis impairs efficient filling and emptying of the ventricles, further aggravating the functional embarrassment resulting from the reduced coronary blood flow. In stable coronary heart disease the increased energy demands during exercise are associated with the rapid development of a haemodynamic profile characteristic of acute left ventricular failure. This results in further substantial increases in pressure work, wall stress and oxygen consumption of the left ventricle. The reflex sympathoadrenal consequences of these primary haemodynamic changes lead to further mechanical and electrical embarrassment of the ischaemic heart. Increased stimulation of beta 1- and beta 2-receptors in the heart increases heart rate and contractility and thereby myocardial oxygen demand. Increased stimulation of alpha-receptors in the peripheral veins and arteries indirectly increases left ventricular oxygen demand still further by increasing preload and afterload, respectively. The reduced blood flow to the endocardium enhances its sensitivity to increased sympathoadrenal stimulation and facilitates initiation of arrhythmias. Blockade of all adrenergic activity, particularly in the myocardium, coronary arteries and peripheral blood vessels should, therefore, help alleviate the myocardial ischaemia. There is a rational argument for the use of alpha-blockade in coronary heart disease, particularly in conjunction with beta-blockade. Attenuation of the risk of coronary spasm and ventricular arrhythmias and reduction of pressure work and left ventricular afterload are amongst the potential attributes of alpha-blockade. Alone, however, their utility is severely limited by the risks of hypotension and reduction in coronary perfusion pressure and reflex oxygen-wasting tachycardia. Alone, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists have no place in the treatment of angina pectoris. beta-Adrenoceptor blocking drugs competitively inhibit catecholamines at both cardiac and peripheral vascular beta-adrenergic receptors. Their main advantage is that they reduce many of the important determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption, particularly by reducing the heart rate during exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "16": "Both beta- and alpha-adrenergic mechanisms are important in the control of blood pressure; alpha-mediated vasoconstriction is responsible for the regulation of vascular tone, and beta-mediated responses stimulate the heart directly and indirectly by liberating renin and affecting vascular smooth muscle tone. beta-Adrenergic blocking drugs have long been established in the treatment of hypertension. The development of drugs which combine this action with an alpha-blocking effect represents an additional mode of action to lower the blood pressure. Numerous studies have demonstrated that labetalol intravenously or orally gives a rapid fall of blood pressure in essential and renal hypertension. It has also been used intravenously in phaeochromocytoma, tetanus, clonidine withdrawal, and as an adjunct to halothane to produce hypotensive anaesthesia. Intravenously, labetalol is probably best given as a graded infusion or as repeated small bolus injections to assure a smooth fall of blood pressure. Many long term studies have shown it to be effective orally in prolonged treatment of hypertension with studies of over 5 years, showing that tolerance does not develop. Labetalol can be used in combination with diuretics and other drugs when necessary. It can be employed to control the blood pressure in all grades of hypertension. A dosage of 100mg twice daily will often be adequate to control mild hypertension and the use of even lower doses has been reported. However, the dosage can be markedly increased in severe hypertension and while such doses are relatively exceptional, several trials have employed over 2 g per day for the more resistant cases. Studies have demonstrated that blood pressure control with labetalol is equivalent to that with beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs plus vasodilators, or methyldopa. Labetalol has been used in patients with severe renal impairment and a number of studies suggest that it may now be the drug of choice in raised blood pressure of pregnancy. Side effects can be divided into those related to beta-blockade, those related to alpha-blockade and those not clearly related to either effect. It has been suggested that the side effects attributable to the beta-blocking component are less obtrusive than those seen with pure beta-blocking drugs without alpha-activity because the alpha-blockade modifies the consequences of beta-blockade. Heart failure has been reported, but for haemodynamic reasons would be expected to be less common; careful patient selection should avoid any risk. Similarly labetalol may worsen asthma even if the risks are probably less than with non-selective beta-blockade alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "17": "The cardinal haemodynamic disturbance in established hypertension is an increased total peripheral resistance and a subnormal blood flow, particularly during exercise. The spontaneously occurring changes in central haemodynamics have been followed in young males with essential hypertension over a 17-year period: a gradual increase in total peripheral resistance and blood pressure, and a gradual fall in cardiac output and stroke volume, have been demonstrated. Labetalol is a unique antihypertensive agent which induces both alpha- and beta-blockade. Numerous studies have shown that when labetalol is given intravenously to patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, blood pressure falls within a few minutes-partly due to reduction in cardiac output and heart rate and partly due to reduction in total peripheral resistance. In most series the average reduction in blood pressure was 17 to 22%, the reduction in total peripheral resistance 11 to 14%, and the reduction in cardiac output 2 to 10%. Thus, the reduction in cardiac output with labetalol is less than that seen after single-dose injection of beta-blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. After intravenous injection, the blood pressure-lowering effect is most marked in the upright position and during muscular exercise when cardiac output is usually significantly reduced. Labetalol reduces blood pressure in severe hypertension. Intravenous doses of 0.2 to 0.8 mg/kg bodyweight reduce blood pressure by approximately 20%. This hypotensive effect is partly due to a reduction in total peripheral resistance and partly due to a fall in cardiac index. When the reduction in blood pressure is gradual and moderate (less than 20%), it is mainly produced by a reduction in total peripheral resistance. During long term use labetalol induces haemodynamic changes rather similar to those seen after bolus injection. However, during prolonged use there is a tendency to normalisation in cardiac output and stroke volume; the sustained decrease in blood pressure is mainly due to a reduction in total peripheral resistance. In a recent 6-year follow-up study where 15 patients were studied before treatment and after 1 and 6 years on long term labetalol treatment, a tendency to normalisation of central haemodynamics was found. Over the years total peripheral resistance was gradually reduced by 15 to 20% at rest as well as during exercise. Stroke volume gradually increased and after 6 years of treatment was approximately 10% higher than the pretreatment value. This compensated for the reduced heart rate and no significant reduction in cardiac output was seen either during exercise or at rest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "18": "Several compounds of the chemical class arylethanolamines have been shown to possess combined alpha- or vasodilator and beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties. The first drug was labetalol (AH5158)[5-(1-hydroxy-2)1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl(amino)-ethyl (salicylamide)]. Others include medroxalol, bucindolol and YM-09538, which differ from labetalol either by the nature of the substitution on the primary benzene ring and/or on the terminal nitrogen. All of these drugs are non-selective beta-blockers, except for bucindolol whose selectivity has not been carefully defined. The rationale for the development of this group of drugs was the knowledge that blockade of one adrenoceptor subtype causes reflex stimulation of the other, i.e. vasoconstriction after nonspecific beta-blockade and tachycardia after alpha-blockade. Since both of these compensatory responses act to prevent a fall in blood pressure, a relatively weak blockade of both receptor types should act synergistically to produce a lowering of blood pressure with minimal physiological disturbance. Haemodynamic studies have confirmed that the additional alpha-blocking properties of labetalol produce a pattern of haemodynamic changes unlike that of propranolol and other simple beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. Peripheral vascular resistance, which falls acutely during the initial administration of the drug, tends to fall further during prolonged administration and the pulse rate tends to remain only slightly lower than pretreatment levels. In addition, at normal dose levels cardiac output is maintained by a compensatory increase in stroke volume. Thus, blood pressure is lowered largely by a reduction in vascular resistance, and although the heart rate falls significantly during exercise, the cardiac output is maintained by an increase in stroke volume. This pattern of events is different to that seen with beta-blocking agents which consistently reduce cardiac output during exercise. Currently labetalol is the only member of this group of drugs which is in established clinical use. Its antihypertensive efficacy has been confirmed in many studies and it has been shown to be effective in the management of both hypertensive emergencies and in the long term management of severe hypertension. It is particularly valuable in allowing a reduction in the number of drugs required for adequate blood pressure control. The early theoretical prediction that postural hypotension would occur with high doses is now acknowledged to be labetalol's major dose-limiting side effect. Most of the available pharmacokinetic data on labetalol were derived from studies which utilised a fluorimetric assay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "19": "The relation of in vitro lipophilicity, based on octanol:buffer partition ratio and on reverse-phase liquid chromatographic retention, to in vivo pharmacokinetics and central nervous system entry was evaluated for the beta-blockers propranolol, acebutolol, and sotalol. Anesthetized cats received single intravenous doses, following which plasma kinetics, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) kinetics and brain tissue uptake were determined over the next 4 h. Propranolol, by far the most lipophilic beta-blocker in vitro, had the highest in vivo metabolic clearance and volume of distribution (Vd), the most rapid entry into CSF, and the highest brain:plasma uptake ratio (38.0). Sotalol, the most hydrophilic drug in vitro, had the lowest in vivo clearance and Vd, the slowest CSF entry, and the lowest brain:plasma ratio (0.52). Acebutolol had slightly greater in vitro lipophilicity than sotalol, intermediate values of in vivo plasma kinetics and CSF entry rate, and a slightly greater brain:plasma uptake ratio (0.71). Thus, differences among beta-blockers in lipid solubility are associated with predictable differences in plasma kinetics, and rate of entry into CSF. Furthermore, the relative extent of entry into brain is lower for hydrophilic as opposed to lipophilic beta-blockers.", 
    "20": "A high pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with internal analogue standardization for the simultaneous determination of propafenone and 5-hydroxypropafenone in plasma is described.

With a sample volume of 1 ml the lower limit of detection for propafenone and 5-hydroxypropafenone is approximately 0.2 ng/ml, the limit of determination (precision limit 10%) is approximately 1 ng/ml. The variation coefficients decrease from approximately 10% in the low range to 6-9% for propafenone and 3-7% for 5-hydroxypropafenone at 2 ng/ml and above. For both substances a mean weighted relative error of 6% has to be expected.", 
    "21": "Indications and contraindications of the beta blocking drugs are reviewed as a method of preparation to sub total thyroidectomy in thyrotoxicosis. They allow a shorter preparation's time: a few days, until one or two weeks maximum. Major risks are cardiac failure, and altered response to stress. This technic is contraindicated in thyrocardiac disease, severe thyrotoxicosis and for patients over fifty years of age. The best beta blocking's criterion is exercise-induced tachycardia's reduction. The safety of this method allows its utilisation when social, medical or psychological environment requires a quick thyrotoxicosis' recovery.", 
    "22": "In two series of antiarrhythmic drugs tested, as the octanol/water partition coefficient increases so do the following: elimination from the body by biotransformation, first-pass biotransformation in the liver and gastrointestinal tract after oral administration, protein binding to some extent, and penetration into brain tissue. Patients receiving lipophilic beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs may experience more central nervous system side effects than those receiving hydrophilic beta blockers. Structural modification of a drug, guided by the concept of bioisosterism, may allow the disassociation of therapeutic from toxic activities. Alpha-1 acid glycoprotein is the major plasma protein that binds the basic antiarrhythmic drugs. Antiarrhythmic drug metabolites are generally more polar (less lipophilic) and less plasma protein-bound than the parent drugs.", 
    "23": "The heterogeneity of resuscitated patients at risk of recurrent cardiac arrest serves to make their management difficult and complex. It is logical that therapy should be tailored to each patient and certainly to the mechanism whereby sudden cardiac death occurred. It is important, also, to recognize that not all resuscitated victims are at high risk for recurrence and that aggressive interventions are not necessarily mandatory. In the patient with cardiac arrest related to transient myocardial ischemia, a direct approach toward relieving ischemia seems appropriate. Antiarrhythmic agents may have a role in the treatment of some patients, but to this date the efficacy of such therapy is speculative, at best. The development and testing of agents that have \"antifibrillatory\" properties seems a logical approach at this time. Clearly, efforts to lessen the mortality of patients who have been resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are important, not only for the particular patients themselves, but also in an effort to develop rational, prophylactic interventions for the large numbers of patients with coronary heart disease who are at risk for the development of sudden cardiac death.", 
    "24": "The major findings of the present study may be summarized as follows: Muscle strength, measured as maximal isokinetic torque and maximal dynamic muscle power, measured as the highest 5 s power output during a 30 s maximal cycle exercise test, were unaltered by beta-blockade. When maximal exercise was prolonged to 30-60 s, anaerobic endurance, measured both as average power during 30 s maximal cycle exercise and as static endurance time at 65% of maximal voluntary contraction force, was decreased by beta-blockade. On the other hand, anaerobic endurance measured as peak torque decline during 50 repeated maximal isokinetic contractions was unaffected by beta-blockade. Aerobic power, measured as maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) during cycle exercise, was decreased by beta-blockade. In addition, aerobic endurance was decreased by beta-blockade when measured as both time to fatigue during 10 min cycling and as time for a 2000 m run. When comparing the effects of beta 1-selective and non-selective beta-blockade on work capacity, no differences were demonstrated with regard to muscle strength, muscle power, and aerobic power (VO2max). Aerobic endurance was decreased to a greater extent by non-selective than by beta 1-selective blockade, when similar reductions in heart rate and VO2 max were attained. The difference in aerobic endurance between the two types of blockers indicates that factors other than an effect on oxygen transport, are responsible for the further reduction in endurance induced by the non-selective blockade. These factors are most likely local metabolic factors. Similarly, work capacity was reduced to a greater extent by non-selective than beta 1-selective blockade when similar reduction in blood pressure were attained by both drugs in hypertensive patients. Muscle G-6-P concentration was reduced by non-selective, but not by beta 1-selective blockade, suggesting a beta 2-mediated retardation of glycolysis. The effects of beta-blockade on VO2max and work capacity shown during acute administration persisted during long-term treatment.", 
    "25": "Two series of experiments were performed to determine whether nicergoline possesses an alpha-adrenergic blocking action on the lower urinary tract musculature in dogs and humans. One series consisted of in vivo studies of urethral pressure profile recordings in 19 female dogs, and their responses to adrenergic stimulation with noradrenaline or methoxamine, alone and following administration of nicergoline. The other series consisted of in vitro isometric studies of 61 strips of human prostate, and the establishment of dose response curves to nor-adrenaline alone and in the presence of various concentrations of nicergoline. In both sets of experiments clear evidence of an alpha-adrenergic blocking effect was obtained. From the in vitro experiments, the Kb of nicergoline was calculated as less than or equal to 9 X 10(-9) M.",

The patients were divided into 3 functional classes in terms of the gravity of coronary pathology, with the threshold power being 150-300, 450-600 and 750-900 kgm/min. Application of the test made it possible to establish that the status of extracardial regulation characterizes the functional component in the pathogenesis of CHD rather than the gravity of atherosclerotic lesions of the coronary artery, thereby permitting one to form the judgement about the latent reserve capacities of the heart.", 
    "27": "The cardiovascular effects of a new antihypertensive agent, prizidilol hydrochloride (SK&F 92657), have been evaluated in a group of 13 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, both at rest and during mental stress and isometric or dynamic exercise. After 6 weeks of therapy (200-300 mg of prizidilol b.i.d.) both systolic and diastolic blood pressure values at rest were significantly lower than those recorded before treatment and during placebo (with an average decrease of about 22/11 mm Hg in the supine position). Heart rate at rest was slightly reduced. Cardiovascular responses to dynamic exercise and mental stress were not prevented by prizidilol, but blood pressure and heart rate levels around which variation occurred were lowered to a significant extent. During isometric exercise prizidilol did not protect against a rise in diastolic blood pressure. Blood pressure and heart rate reduction both at rest and during stimulation were not related to plasma drug concentrations. Side-effects were very rare. It is concluded that prizidilol significantly reduces blood pressure both at rest and during mental stress and physical activity with only sight effects on heart rate, and with a very simple therapeutic scheme.", 
    "28": "A radioreceptor assay (RRA) for the assay of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in native human plasma is described. The hydrophilic antagonist 3H-CGP 12177 was used as the radioligand. In contrast to the hydrophobic radioligand 3H-dihydroalprenolol, which was investigated in parallel, the beta-adrenoceptor binding of 3H-CGP 12177 by rat reticulocyte membranes was found not to be affected by inclusion of increasing proportions (0-66% of incubation volume) of human plasma in the assay. Thus, solvent extraction of drug and/or active metabolites was not necessary to avoid binding of the radioligand tracer to plasma added in the RRA. The assay of unprocessed samples was possible. Drug concentrations in plasma after oral administration of propranolol (240 mg) or carteolol (30 mg) to 6 healthy volunteers were measured by the RRA and in parallel by a chemical method. The results from both methods agreed when the plasma concentration kinetics of propranolol were investigated (elimination half-life:3.9 h). In contrast, plasma concentrations of carteolol were consistently higher according to the RRA after oral administration of the drug. Identical concentrations, however, were found by the RRA and chemical method using plasma samples spiked with carteolol. Plasma concentrations of carteolol detected by the chemical method decline monoexponentially (elimination half-life: 5.4 h). A similar half-life of elimination for parent drug was found by the RRA (5.9 h), but an additional term describing the appearance of an active metabolite was necessary to account for the biphasic drug elimination (elimination half-life of metabolite: 17.3 h).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "The acute haemodynamic effects of increasing doses of parenterally administered prenalterol-a beta-adrenergic stimulating drug-were assessed in normal subjects by means of radionuclide ventriculography. Prenalterol induced dose-related increases in the left ventricular ejection fraction and the systolic pressure end-systolic volume ratio. Left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes decreased to the same extent accounting for an unchanged stroke volume. Cardiac output increased due to a rise in the heart rate. Systolic blood pressure increased, whereas diastolic and mean blood pressure remained unchanged. Calculated total peripheral resistance decreased significantly. The maximum effect of prenalterol on cardiac performance occurred with a dose of 18 to 36 micrograms/kg. Plasma concentrations of prenalterol showed large interindividual variations. In conclusion, prenalterol improves the pump function of the normal heart and causes a fall in peripheral vascular resistance, implying a reduction of the load on the heart. These effects may prove beneficial in the treatment of acute heart failure.", 
    "30": "The efficacy of once-daily bopindolol, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent with partial agonist activity, and of pindolol and atenolol in the treatment of essential hypertension has been compared. 369 patients were investigated in a double-blind parallel-group study. The treatment period was 10 weeks. Blood pressure normalisation (diastolic BP equal to or less than 90 mmHg) was to be achieved by a stepwise increase in the dose of the test drugs, and, if required, by addition of a diuretic. Normalisation of blood pressure was achieved in 71 to 76% of the subjects, with no significant differences between bopindolol, pindolol, and atenolol. Special attention was given to evaluation of side effects by using two methods for registration of all adverse events during the study. A low incidence of drug-induced side effects was observed, with no significant difference between bopindolol, pindolol, and atenolol. There was no evidence of unsuspected adverse reactions due to bopindolol.", 
    "31": "The effects on ventilation of the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol, and the relatively cardioselective beta-blocker, metoprolol, were compared in a randomized single-blind crossover study in 16 patients with asthma, bronchitis and emphysema (American Thoracic Society criteria). Group I had \"fixed\" airways disease with less than 20% improvement in FEV1 following inhaled salbutamol 5 mg by nebuliser. Group II had \"reversible\" obstruction, greater than 20% improvement. Bronchodilator therapy was withheld for 24 h with the exception of aerosols which were permitted until 12 h before study. After control observations on each of 2 study days, each patient received cumulative doses of propranolol (maximum 170 mg) and metoprolol (maximum 187.5 mg). Ventilatory function (FEV1, FVC, FEV1%) was assessed at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h. In Group I, 2 patients were unable to complete the study. One patient became dizzy with propranolol 70 mg but tolerated metoprolol 187.5 mg. One patient developed wheeze with propranolol 15 mg but tolerated metoprolol 187.5 mg. Metoprolol was tolerated in all 8 patients with \"fixed\" disease, although FEV1 was reduced by more than 30% in 1 patient. Three patients in Group II did not complete the study because of wheezing following propranolol 10 mg, metoprolol 37.5 mg; propranolol 17.5 mg, metoprolol 37.5 mg; propranolol 45 mg, tolerated metoprolol 187.5 mg respectively. Wheezing responded in all cases to inhaled isoprenaline. The response to either propranolol or metoprolol was unpredictable in patients with \"reversible\" disease. When wheezing occurred in this group, it developed following small, potentially subtherapeutic doses of each drug. Although metoprolol was better tolerated, the practical benefit of cardioselectivity in those patients with reversible airways disease was negligible.", 
    "32": "The relevance of the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) of beta-blocking compounds to the clinical therapeutics of acute myocardial infarction was evaluated in 20 patients with an uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction by comparing the haemodynamic effects of equivalent beta-blocking doses of propranolol (non-cardioselective; no ISA) and pindolol (non-cardioselective; 50% ISA). Consecutive eligible male patients admitted to a Coronary Care Unit were randomised following a 1 h control period to two separate studies. In Study 1 the short-term dose-response effects of propranolol (1-8 mg) or pindolol (0.1-0.8 mg) were assessed. In Study 2 comparison of the effects of single i.v. propranolol (8 mg) and pindolol (0.8 mg) doses was undertaken over 6 h. Haemodynamic variables and thermodilution cardiac output were subsequently recorded to compare the effects of each drug on the circulation. The plasma concentrations of propranolol and pindolol were in the recognised therapeutic range. Both drugs were clinically well-tolerated, the changes induced in haemodynamic variables following each drug demonstrated effective beta-blockade. Within the limits of the experimental protocol, these data did not suggest definite haemodynamic advantage for ISA of pindolol in acute myocardial infarction. These findings are perhaps due to sympathetic activation in acute myocardial infarction attenuating the haemodynamic impact of ISA.", 
    "33": "The International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension (IPPPSH), an international multicentre randomised double-blind trial, compares antihypertensive regimens containing a beta-blocker (oxprenolol) with regimens not containing a beta-blocker. The protocol was developed and the study started in 1977. 6,357 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were enrolled by the end of 1980. Patients have been treated in 6 countries for 3 to 5 years by 288 general practitioner and hospital out-patient centres. Follow-up was finished at the end of 1983 when 25,651 years of patient treatment had been completed. At entry patients had a diastolic pressure of 100-125 mmHg with no clinical evidence of cerebrovascular or ischaemic heart disease (W.H.O. Stages I and II hypertension). The study was designed to examine three main objectives: any influence of oxprenolol on the incidence of myocardial infarction and sudden death compared with antihypertensive therapy not containing a beta-blocker; the influence of cerebrovascular accidents in the same two groups; a comparison of the antihypertensive effectiveness, and the subjective and objective tolerability of the regimens. This paper summarises the objectives and methodology, and examines randomisation between the two treatment groups at entry into the IPPPSH.", 
    "34": "A patient with essential hypertension had a prolonged period of uncontrollable high blood pressure during therapy with the nonspecific beta-blocker nadolol. A subsequent challenge with the beta1-blocker atenolol caused a pressor response associated with diminished catecholamine release, impaired catecholamine clearance, loss of baroreflex response, and bradycardia. Beta-blocking drugs can lead to hypertension by causing fluid retention, reversal of catecholamine vasodilatation, or a direct pressor effect.", 
    "35": "Clinical-pharmacological investigations on interactions between cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents continuing, indometacin and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) were added to a monotherapy of talinolol in two groups of hypertensive outpatients. Both added drugs reduced slightly the blood pressure lowering effect of talinolol, but did not alter its negative chronotropic effect. Indometacin abolished a talinolol-induced increase in serum triglycerides and caused a small decrease in serum cholesterol. ASA diminished slightly blood glucose. Probably the observed interactions and side effects are not important practically.", 
    "36": "In six healthy volunteers pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction of metoprolol and nifedipine with cimetidine and ranitidine was investigated after 1 week of monotherapy with nifedipine and metoprolol and after 1 week each of combined treatment of these drugs with the H2-receptor antagonists. Ranitidine led to a 50% increase in mean peak plasma levels and in the area under the plasma level time curve (AUC) of metoprolol (p less than 0.05) and to an insignificant 30% rise in these parameters of nifedipine (p less than 0.05). Cimetidine increased metoprolol's peak plasma levels of AUC by about 60% (p less than 0.05) and those of nifedipine by 80% (p less than 0.05). Compared to monotherapy with metoprolol beta blocking activity measured by exercise induced tachycardia was not significantly stronger inhibited under the combined treatment of metoprolol with each of the two H2-receptor antagonists. On the other hand the antihypertensive effect of nifedipine was significantly increased during concurrent administration of cimetidine in seven hypertensive patients when compared with monotherapy.", 
    "37": "The occurrence of an anaphylactoid shock in a patient treated with beta-adrenergic blocking agents during a long time prior to surgery constitutes a high risk because beta-receptors are refractory to adrenergic substances and compensatory mechanisms are obtunded. The shock is characterized by severe hypotension and bradycardia, both resistant to adrenaline. These signs were observed in a patient treated with metoprolol for hypertension several months prior to surgery. The intravenous injection of an iodine containing contrast medium during general anaesthesia was followed by a lethal anaphylactoid shock resistant to adrenaline, atropine and isoprenaline. The treatment of the shock needs, besides adrenaline, massive vascular filling, high doses of beta-agonists and glucagon.", 
    "38": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute and long-term effects on blood pressure and hemodynamics both at rest and during acute exposure to loud noise of drugs with beta-adrenoceptor blocking and vasodilating properties. Prizidilol and carvedilol both act as nonselective beta-blocking and precapillary vasodilating compounds. Prizidilol (200 mg X 2) was compared to propranolol (80 mg X 2) plus hydralazine (25 mg X 2) and showed similar antihypertensive effect in a long-term double-blind randomized trial. Carvedilol was evaluated acutely with invasive (dye-dilution) and noninvasive (plethysmography) technique and showed an acute antihypertensive effect without causing a rise in TPR and with a decrease in regional resistance in the fore-arm. Acutely, carvedilol (25 mg and 50 mg) decreased blood pressure and regional resistance (50 mg) in contrast to propranolol (80 mg) which did not lower blood pressure acutely and caused an increase in regional resistance. In a long-term double-blind, randomized comparison, both propranolol (80 mg X 2) and carvedilol (25 mg X 2 and 50 mg X 2) showed a useful antihypertensive effect. After 29 days, however, it was still possible to demonstrate an acute decrease in resistance with carvedilol (50 mg) after tablet intake, indicating the vasodilating activity of this compound. When patients with essential hypertension were exposed to an even broad band noise (100 dBA), there was a rise in blood pressure due to an increase in TPR. Alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade (prazosin 2 mg) prevented the rise in TPR but blood pressure increased in spite of this due to a rise in CO. Moreover, nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade and alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade in combination (labetalol 200 mg) were unable to prevent the rise in blood pressure induced by noise. Finally, precapillary vasodilatation and beta-adrenoceptor blockade (prizidilol 400 mg) given as long-term treatment were also inefficient in preventing the noise-induced (105 dBA) rise in blood pressure. The absolute level of blood pressure obtained, however, was significantly lower than during placebo administration.", 
    "39": "Altogether 106 patients with stage II essential hypertension (EH) were treated for a long time (up to 3 years) with beta-blockers belonging to different classes. In some cases beta-blockers were administered in combination with vasodilators and/or a diuretic. In 66 patients, prolonged continuous treatment led to an appreciable drop in blood pressure (BP) due to the reduction of both the cardiac index and the total peripheral vascular resistance (TPVR), particularly in patients with stage IIB essential hypertension treated with a cardioselective beta-blocker tenormine or an alpha- and beta-blocker trandate. These patients showed a significant decrease in intramyocardial tension, in the thickness of the walls and mass of the myocardium. Regression of left ventricle hypertrophy depended not only on the hemodynamic factors that determine the decrease in the load of the myocardium by the volume or pressure but also on the neurohumoral effects (mainly due to the reduced adrenergic stimulation during treatment with beta-blockers). In 40 patients with stage IIB EH treated occasionally, BP appeared to approach the initial level after 2.5-3 years. Furthermore, these patients manifested an increase in the TPVR. The myocardial mass significantly rose, mainly at the expense of the thickening of the ventricular septum.", 
    "40": "The effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists were compared in various operant behavioral tasks, particularly intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS). Clenbuterol, salbutamol, and terbutaline all reduced responding by rats that lever-pressed for low stimulation intensities. The effects of clenbuterol in this test were completely reversed by propranolol, and those of salbutamol were partly reversed. Intermediate doses of clenbuterol and salbutamol slowed the initiation of rewarding brain stimulation in a shuttlebox but had little or no effect on the termination latencies. However, higher doses of both drugs lengthened the termination latencies. Motor activity was reduced at doses that attenuated ICSS responding. Complete tolerance occurred within 4 days to the effects of clenbuterol and salbutamol on lever-pressing ICSS and to the effects of clenbuterol on motor activity. The apparent performance deficits induced by these drugs were overcome by more intense motivation. For example, even at high doses, clenbuterol reduced ICSS lever-pressing only partially when animals bar-pressed for high rather than low stimulation intensities. Furthermore, all three drugs failed to alter Sidman avoidance responding at doses up to 100 times those that attenuated ICSS responding. It is concluded that although beta-adrenoceptor agonists cause apparent sedation in rats, this sedation is limited and shows rapid tolerance.", 
    "41": "Calcium antagonists, of which the best known are verapamil, nifedipine and diltiazem, are a powerful group of cardioactive agents with a clinical spectrum of indications rather similar to those of beta-adrenoceptor blockade, including angina of effort, angina at rest, hypertension and supraventricular tachycardias (nifedipine is ineffective for the latter). In angina caused by coronary spasm, calcium antagonists are preferred to beta-blockade. Calcium antagonists have a basically different mode of action from beta-adrenoceptor blockade, although both ultimately act on the free cytoplasmic calcium ion concentration. Critical differences between the calcium antagonists are dependent on the individual properties of the calcium antagonists concerned. Different binding sites on the sarcolemma have been identified for nifedipine-like agents and verapamil, but with a different interaction with the nifedipine site. None of these sites might be relevant to the binding of calcium antagonists to the tissue of their therapeutic site of action (arterial smooth muscle for all; atrioventricular node for verapamil and diltiazem). As a group, calcium antagonists cause vascular dilation and do not cause bronchial constriction, in contrast to the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. In many patients, these diverse properties allow safe combination of calcium antagonists and beta-adrenoceptor blockers if due care is observed, especially in the case of nifedipine. The clinical differences between the effects of various calcium antagonists reflect: (i) the greater vasodilator capacity of nifedipine, so that at a given concentration the afterload effect dominates over possible effects on the nodal or myocardial tissue; (ii) the greater inhibition of vagal tone by nifedipine than by verapamil or diltiazem; and (iii) the greater inhibition of the atrioventricular node by verapamil and diltiazem. In angina of effort, calcium antagonists are now becoming the agents of first choice in some centers. Experimental use of calcium antagonists include the possible prevention of ventricular fibrillation, the inhibition of ischemic injury, the prevention of catecholamine mediated injury to the myocardium and decreased arterial calcinosis.", 
    "42": "The effects of alpha 2-adrenergic stimulating agents (clonidine and guanabenz) and beta-adrenolytic agents (atenolol and propranolol) on the systemic arterial pressure, heart-rate, blood glucose level and intraocular pressure, as well as on the concentrations of glucose, Na+, K+ and Ca++ in the lens and aqueous and vitreous humours, are evaluated in the rabbit. alpha 2-adrenergic stimulating agents cause a significant increase of the glucose concentration in the blood, lens, aqueous and vitreous humours; whereas the beta-adrenolytic agents cause insignificant effects. Neither of the two drugs alters the concentration of Na+, K+ and Ca++ in the lens and aqueous and vitreous humours.", 
    "43": "The effect of bucindolol on pulse, blood pressure and airways resistance was studied in eight patients. One hour after 150 mg bucindolol, a significant decrease in supine, standing and post-exercise blood pressure was observed. No change in blood pressure occurred 10 to 14 h after doses ranging from 50-150 mg indicating that bucindolol has a relatively short duration of action. A dose related inhibition of exercise induced tachycardia was observed consistant with beta-receptor blocking activity. However, there was no change in the resting pulse indicating partial sympathomimetic activity. There was no increase in airways resistance at all doses of bucindolol. Serum creatine phosphokinase increased beyond normal limits in 3 out of 6 patients studied, probably due to a direct effect upon skeletal muscle.", 
    "44": "Previous studies have shown that the intrinsic heart rate (IHR) may undergo changes, e.g., decrease after long-term endurance training. The mechanism for this adaptation is not known. In this study, rats were subjected to long-term oral treatment with the beta receptor stimulating drug prenalterol. During the treatment period heart rates at rest and during submaximal exercise were measured. Heart rate after 30 min rest and also 2 min after exercise was higher in the treated animals, due to the beta stimulation. The treated rats had a significantly lower heart rate increase during exercise than untreated controls, consistent with a partial beta-blocking effect of the drug in states with a high endogenous sympathetic activity. Therefore, the animals were not trained but only exposed to the increased stimulation of cardiac beta receptors accomplished by the drug while at rest. After 25 weeks, prenalterol was withdrawn and the IHR was measured in situ after a denervation procedure. The treatment with prenalterol had not altered the IHR. Our previous results from training studies indicate that a heart rate increase above a certain level or the stimulation for a lower setting of the IHR as seen after endurance training. In this study chronic beta receptor stimulation with prenalterol did not influence the IHR, which supports that hypothesis.", 
    "45": "The structure-activity relationship between the acute nonspecific cardiovascular depressant effects of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs and their hydrophobic properties was evaluated experimentally for propranolol, pindolol, practolol, and atenolol, in the anaesthetized cat after preceding beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The LD50 values (geometric mean and range in mumol/kg i.v., each drug n = 5) for the nonspecific depression of max dp/dt were: 7.5 (5.6-9.1) for propranolol, 21 (15.5-28) for pindolol, 190 (115-290) for practolol, and 230 (170-400) for atenolol. The respective partition coefficients in octanol buffer (pH 7.0) as a measure of hydrophobicity were: propranolol 5.4, pindolol 0.20, practolol 0.025, and atenolol 0.0032. These experimental data showed a good fit into the regression equation obtained previously [18]. Practolol, in contrast, had a lower toxicity than calculated because of a pronounced intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), even after catecholamine depletion. The nonspecific cardiovascular toxicity of 15 other clinically used beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs were estimated from their respective octanol buffer partition coefficients. The fall of the diastolic blood pressure was representative of the toxicity of the compounds. It is concluded that the cardiovascular toxicity is lowest in compounds with low hydrophobicity and with distinct ISA.", 
    "46": "Following administration of 14C- and 2H-labelled propafenone hydrochloride (2-(2'-hydroxy-3'-propylaminopropoxy)-omega-phenyl-propiophenone hydrochloride) to beagle dogs, the metabolites were isolated from urine and bile and analysed by mass spectrometry. Reference substances were synthesized on the basis of the structures postulated from the mass spectra and compared with the substances isolated from the biological material. Propafenone was absorbed completely following i.d. administration and eliminated mainly with the bile. Within 28 h 10% of the dose was excreted with the urine and 87% with the bile. Propafenone was extensively metabolized. Less than 1% of the dose was recovered as unchanged substance in urine and bile. The urinary and biliary metabolites were almost exclusively conjugated. The main metabolite, accounting for more than 30% of the dose, was propafenone glucuronide, followed by conjugates of hydroxylated propafenone derivatives with glucuronic acid and sulphuric acid. 5-Hydroxy-propafenone, a propafenone derivative hydroxylated in the middle aromatic ring, and a derivative hydroxylated in the omega-phenyl ring each accounted for about 15% of the dose. Besides these monohydroxy metabolites, two other O-methylated catechol-like derivatives, substituted in the different aromatic rings were recovered. The remainder of the metabolic products identified were mainly substances resulting from degradation of the propoxyamine side chain.", 
    "47": "The effect of the new 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist nisoldipine on electrophysiological parameters was investigated in 10 patients who were pretreated with a beta-blocker. 9 patients received atenolol (75 mg/d) and 1 patient pindolol (15 mg/d) at least for three days prior to the electro-physiological study. Before and after the intravenous injection of nisoldipine (1.5 micrograms/kg body weight) the sinus node function (spontaneous sinus node cycle length, sinus node recovery time, rate corrected sinus node recovery time), the conduction times from the high right atrium to the apex of the right ventricle, and the refractoriness of the different compartments of the heart were assessed. Arterial blood pressure was measured with the cuff method. Nisoldipine induced a slight but significant increase of the heart rate without effecting the blood pressure significantly. All other measured electrophysiological parameters remained unaltered, especially the conduction time of the av node. It is concluded that concerning electrophysiology nisoldipine can safely be combined with beta-blockers because this calcium antagonist does not exert an electrophysiological effect.", 
    "48": "This report summarizes the clinical experiences in the treatment of preterm labor using the combination of hexoprenaline and the beta 1-antagonist metoprolol. We found a dose dependency in the antagonism of positive inotropic effects primarily induced by the beta-stimulator hexoprenaline. To verify the pharmacological properties of metoprolol in transplacental passage we evaluated the plasma concentration of metoprolol in umbilical cord blood. There is quite a low concentration of the beta-blocker nearly 24 h after the last course of administration. The beta 2-receptor density--determined by (+/-)-125-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding--and beta 2-receptor responsiveness--assessed by cyclic AMP response to isoprenaline stimulation--in lymphocytes derived from neonatal blood were also investigated. These results were compared with identical investigations in adult lymphocytes. The results indicate that in neonates beta 2-receptor density and responsiveness is significantly diminished in comparison to the adult controls. The present investigations induce a new concept for the estimation of concomitant fetal cardiovascular reactions under maternal beta-blockade.", 
    "49": "The effects of activated charcoal and ipecac syrup by mouth on cimetidine and pindolol absorption were studied in seven subjects, who had ingested 20 mg metoclopramide 1 h earlier, and compared with the adsorption capacity of charcoal in vitro. Activated charcoal, 50 g, given 5 min after 400 mg cimetidine + 10 mg pindolol, reduced their absorption by 99% or more, based on AUC0-48h and the 48-h urinary excretion of the drugs. Syrup of ipecac caused emesis on each occasion. On the average, ipecac reduced the absorption of cimetidine and pindolol by 75% and 60%, respectively. Based on studies in vitro it seems probable that the adsorbing capacity of charcoal for cimetidine but not for pindolol will be saturated if 50 g charcoal is given after an overdose of about 100 fold the therapeutic dose. Because the use of ipecac allowed an absorption of the drugs at least 30 fold that allowed by charcoal, the immediate administration of activated charcoal, without preceding lavage or emesis, should be considered in such poisonings where the adsorption capacity of high charcoal doses will not be saturated.", 
    "50": "In a double blind, placebo-controlled study the ventilatory effects of the beta 1-selective receptor blockers bisoprolol (EMD 33512) and metoprolol and their interactions with the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline were investigated in 8 asthmatic patients. Both beta-blockers, in all the doses given, caused a significant decrease in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Vital capacity (VC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were significantly decreased only after 10 mg bisoprolol. Terbutaline inhalation caused the same significant improvements in FEV1 and PEFR during placebo as during bisoprolol 10 mg, bisoprolol 20 mg and metoprolol 100 mg. Both beta-blockers caused equal changes in heart rate (HR) at rest. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) decreased significantly after bisoprolol 20 mg and metoprolol 100 mg, but not after bisoprolol 10 mg. Inhalation of terbutaline up to a dose of 3.5 mg had no influence on HR and BP. The results point to good beta 1-selectivity of bisoprolol 10 mg and 20 mg and metoprolol 100 mg in asthmatic patients. No correlation was found between the plasma levels of the beta-blockers and the changes in the ventilatory indices, HR or BP.", 
    "51": "The effects of single, consecutively increased, oral doses of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist bisoprolol (5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 mg) on blood pressure, heart rate and bronchomotor tone were investigated in an open acute trial with 16 patients suffering from angina pectoris due to coronary heart disease and reversible chronic obstructive bronchitis. Even the lowest dose of bisoprolol (5 mg) caused a marked, long-lasting reduction in blood pressure and heart rate. After doses exceeding 20 mg, the incidence of an exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect on heart rate (beta 1-blockade) increased with dose. At doses above 30 mg, bisoprolol showed incipient impairment of bronchomotor function (beta 2-blockade) in individual patients. It is concluded that bisoprolol exhibits high beta 1-selectivity, i.e. a wide beta 1/beta 2 split, since blockade of bronchial beta 2-receptors only occurred at doses well above the therapeutically relevant dose range. The results may not be applicable to chronic treatment.", 
    "52": "The synthesis of 14C-propafenone and 2H-propafenone (propafenone: 2-(2'-hydroxy-3'-propylamino-propoxy)-omega-phenyl-propiophenone hydrochloride) and some reference compounds is described. The thin-layer chromatographic, high-performance liquid and gas chromatographic properties of the substances are described. Propafenone and the reference substances were studied by mass spectrometry and compared with each other, with respect to structural elucidation of the metabolites. The chromatographic and mass spectrometric data (key ions) enables the metabolites of propafenone to be identified in biological material.", 
    "53": "The effects of acute i.p. administration of lithium (2 mmol/kg), diazepam (10 mg/kg) and dl-propranolol (2 mg/kg) on brain Na+-K+-ATPase activity in mice exposed to two stressful stimuli (cold and immobilization) were examined. In unstressed mice, lithium and propranolol did not affect the enzyme activity, while diazepam increased it. Interestingly, all the three drugs reversed the stress-induced increase in the brain Na+-K+-ATPase activity. The specificity of this action remains to be clarified.", 
    "54": "Ten patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) due to ischaemic heart disease treated with digitalis and diuretics were randomly allocated to oral treatment with prenalterol (100-200 mg daily in addition to their basal treatment) or to intensified treatment with diuretics in a cross-over trial. A wash-out period of 1-4 weeks was allowed between the two modes of treatment. Most of the patients demonstrated subjective improvement during prenalterol therapy, but this improvement could not be verified objectively by exercise test, echocardiography, chest X-ray or weight measurements. No serious side-effects of either mode of treatment were observed. Heart rate was significantly lower during exercise when the patients were treated with prenalterol than during the control periods or during intensified conventional treatment, indicating that prenalterol acts as a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker during exercise in this patient group. The results indicate that prenalterol is a partial beta-receptor agonist without superior beneficial effects compared to those of intensified conventional treatment in patients with chronic, severe CHF.", 
    "55": "Effects of nipradilol on proximal, middle and distal portions of left coronary arteries of the dog were investigated in vitro. Nipradilol (10(-7)-10(-3) M) produced a concentration-dependent relaxation in helical strips of isolated coronary artery under potassium contracture. The relaxation in the middle portions was most pronounced, it was 10% of the equimolar concentrations of nitroglycerin and significantly greater than that of propranolol. In the proximal portions of the coronary arteries, nipradilol (3 X 10(-8)-3 X 10(-7) M) showed a tendency to augment the contractile responses to norepinephrine; in the middle portions it reversed the relaxant responses to norepinephrine into contractile effects in a concentration-dependent manner. In distal portions, nipradilol significantly decreased the relaxant responses of the strips to norepinephrine. The findings demonstrate direct vasodilating and beta-adrenoceptor blocking actions of nipradilol in isolated coronary arteries of the dog.", 
    "56": "In a double-blind masked study with 100 young and healthy subjects we compared the influence of the beta-blocking agents timolol and metipranol on breakup time and their tolerance. While metipranolol provoked a slight burning sensation, timolol was well tolerated. Both beta-blockers, however, led to an equally enormous reduction in BUT in short-term observations.", 
    "57": "Two case reports are described, both breast carcinoma patients with metastatic disease. One of the patients had a dexamethasone dependent brain metastatic condition. The second patient suffered from high blood pressure, which was controlled with beta-blocker drugs. Both patients developed severe complications when treated with aminoglutethimide as a cancer hormonal therapy. The case reports are described and possible drug interaction mechanisms are discussed.", 
    "58": "The sensitivity of the prenalterol test has been evaluated in 21 patients with pseudoischaemic T waves and no documented organic heart disease. The sensitivity of the test (40 micrograms/kg i.v. in 3 min) was 90.4%. In comparison, the isoproterenol test, performed in 10 of these patients, showed a similar sensitivity but prenalterol had a lower positive chronotropic effect than isoproterenol (p less than 0.0005). The possible advantages of the introduction of the prenalterol test in clinical practice are analysed.", 
    "59": "The pharmacokinetics of butofilolol, a new beta-blocking drug, was studied in 6 healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of the unchanged drug were determined after a single 100-mg oral administration, and also during chronic treatment (100 mg/day for a week) and after the last dose. Maximum plasma concentrations were observed 2 to 3 h after drug administration and varied between the subjects (120 to 430 ng/ml). The apparent volumes of distribution were large, ranging between 200 I and 500 I, and the apparent clearances of elimination appeared to be intermediate between 40 and 70 l/h. Drug elimination in the urine (about 4% of administered dose) occurred by filtration, tubular secretion and pH-sensitive reabsorption following a non-linear process. However, pharmacokinetic parameters remained constant during chronic treatment, since urinary elimination of the parent drug was too low to influence its pharmacokinetic profile. In addition, a high correlation was found between plasma levels of butofilolol and the effect of the drug on resting heart rate, while a slight effect on diastolic blood pressure could be discerned.", 
    "60": "The pharmacokinetics of butofilolol, a new beta-blocking drug used in the treatment of hypertension, were investigated in 9 patients with varying degrees of renal impairment (creatinine clearance ranging from 65 ml/min to 6.6 ml/min). The drug was administered as a single oral 100-mg dose. Plasma and urine concentrations of the parent drug were measured. The pharmacokinetic parameters of butofilolol calculated from examination of patients with renal failure were compared to those obtained from healthy subjects. Renal failure was found to be associated with a marked increase of the areas under the plasma concentration-time curves of the parent drug whereas its elimination rate constant tended to increase, especially in severe renal failure. A highly significant relationship between the amounts of unchanged drug excreted in urine and the creatinine clearance was observed (r = 0.90, p less than 0.001). The higher plasma levels of the parent drug observed in renal failure might be due to a decrease in the first-pass hepatic extraction of the drug. But these changes in plasma clearance were probably counteracted by modification of the volume of distribution, so that the net result of these alterations was a slight increase in the elimination half-life.", 
    "61": "Potential changes in superior cervical ganglion cells evoked by 5-HT or the nicotinic agonist, dimethyl-phenyl piperazinium (DMPP), were recorded using the sucrose-gap method and a number of putative 5-HT antagonists tested for potency and selectivity. Selective blockade of 5-HT responses was produced by 5-HT itself and, in increasing order of potency, by cocaine, metoclopramide and quipazine. A non-selective blockade was observed with bufotenine and d-tubocurarine. Substances which had no effect on 5-HT responses included methysergide and other compounds related to LSD, cinanserin, cyproheptadine, phenylbiguanide and morphine. The results provide further information about the 5-HT receptor on sympathetic ganglion cells and support the view that this receptor is distinct from neuronal receptors in the myenteric plexus and on cholinergic nerve terminals.", 
    "62": "Pituitary glands and hypothalami from broiler fowl heads were incubated alone or together with dopamine, noradrenaline or monoaminergic drugs (apomorphine, pimozide, phentolamine, isoproterenol and propranolol). The basal release of both prolactin and growth hormone was not affected by any of these amines or aminergic drugs. The co-incubation of pituitary glands with whole hypothalami consistently stimulated prolactin and growth hormone secretion. Apomorphine inhibited hypothalamus-induced prolactin and growth hormone release and the response was blocked by pimozide. Noradrenaline markedly stimulated hypothalamus-induced prolactin release, an effect antagonised by phentolamine. Thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulated the release of prolactin and this stimulation was reversed, in a dose-related manner, by dopamine. TRH also increased the release of growth hormone, in the presence or absence of dopamine. These results demonstrate inhibitory dopaminergic effects on prolactin and growth hormone secretion and stimulatory noradrenergic effects on prolactin release. These aminergic effects may be mediated at pituitary and/or hypothalamic sites.", 
    "63": "Patients with essential hypertension were interviewed prior to entering therapeutic studies in general practice. Patients' age, sex and details of antihypertensive therapy (if any) were noted, as were their spontaneously reported symptoms. Complaints of cold extremities were highest in those taking a beta-blocker (4.1%). Those untreated or taking other therapies complained less often. Those patients taking a beta-blocker with ISA complained less often (3.1%) of cold extremities than those taking a beta-blocker without ISA (5.2%).", 
    "64": "Carvedilol (BM 14190) is a new compound with combined nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity, devoid of ISA, and a precapillary vasodilating effect. Its acute haemodynamic effects were studied by invasive techniques in 10 patients given 25 mg carvedilol and noninvasively in 10 patients given 25 mg and in 10 given 50 mg orally. All had essential hypertension. In the invasive study intraarterial blood pressure was measured and cardiac output was determined by the dye-dilution method using Cardio-Green as the indicator. Peripheral haemodynamics in all 30 patients were studied in the forearm using strain gauge plethysmography. Measurements were made at rest before and repeatedly for 90 minutes after oral administration of one capsule of 25 mg or 50 mg carvedilol. Significant reductions in the systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p less than 0.05-0.001) were observed in all groups. Cardiac output showed a small, non-significant decrease from 5.81/min to 5.1 l/min. Total peripheral resistance did not change, whereas resistance in the forearm fell by 16% (p less than 0.05). These findings are different from what would have been expected acutely after administration of a pure beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent. They indicate that carvedilol possesses vasodilating activity in addition to its beta-adrenoceptor blocking effect.", 
    "65": "In a randomised within-subject double-blind study, 7 healthy male volunteers, aged 32 to 40 years, received at rest intravenous infusions of 2 mg propranolol (devoid of partial agonist activity), 2 mg oxprenolol (with partial agonist activity) and placebo. Cuff blood pressure did not vary after any of the 3 treatments. The heart rate did not change after placebo, but fell in the first 5 min both after propranolol and oxprenolol (p less than 0.01); the rate was slightly lower after propranolol than oxprenolol (p less than 0.05). The heart rate remained lower after both beta-blockers than placebo from 5 to 60 min after the infusion (both p less than 0.01), but the difference between the two beta-blockers was no longer significant. Plasma cyclic AMP showed a peak rise at 2 and 3 min after oxprenolol, and remained unchanged at those times after propranolol and placebo. From the 5th to the 60th min after infusion, the cyclic AMP concentration was lower after both beta-blockers than placebo, and with a slightly but not significantly higher level on oxprenolol than propranolol. Plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline were higher after the beta-blockers compared to placebo. Oxprenolol evoked a smaller and non-significant rise in both catecholamines. That oxprenolol, unlike propranolol, causes a sudden rise in plasma cyclic AMP soon after an i.v. infusion may be due to its partial agonist activity.", 
    "66": "Serum levels of T4, T3 rT3 and resin T3 uptake were followed for 5 days in 40 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) allocated to early treatment either with alprenolol or placebo. There was a significant fall in T3 (P less than 0.05) and an increase in rT3 (P less than 0.05) without any significant difference between the alprenolol - (n = 19) and placebo - (n = 21) treated groups. The risk of missing a further 20% change in se-T3 and se-rT3 after alprenolol compared to placebo treatment (beta) was less than 0.10 and less than 0.50, respectively. In patients with a severe clinical course, the fall in T3 and increase in rT3 was significantly greater than in patients without complications. No change in T4 was observed either with respect to the clinical course nor following alprenolol. The data suggest that alprenolol can be given in the acute phase of myocardial infarction without causing any additional disturbance in the serum levels of T3 and T4.", 
    "67": "Pigeon erythrocytes were carefully washed in an isotonic neutral buffer, devoid of potassium, and the rate of passive unidirectional efflux of potassium from the cells into a K+-free medium was measured after 20 min, at 40 degrees C. Isoproterenol inhibits K+-efflux by 35-45%, at a cell concentration of 1%; the isoproterenol effect is mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors. Cyclic AMP mimics the effect of isoproterenol, but at 4-5 orders of magnitude higher concentrations. Cyclic AMP increases 20-fold the phosphorylation of purified cell membranes by [gamma 32P]ATP.", 
    "68": "Following removal of a skin patch from each hind limb of a series of adult newts, the limbs were explanted into small dishes of Holtfreter solution containing various combinations of test drugs. Later, the amount of wound epithelium that formed on each limb was determined using a planimeter on wound tracings obtained with the aid of a drawing tube-equipped microscope. All three (-)-catecholamines tested inhibited migration with the following order of effectiveness: isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine. The effect was stereospecific with (-)-isoproterenol clearly more effective than the (+)-isomer. Propranolol, a beta antagonist, blocked the effect of (-)-isoproterenol while the alpha antagonist, phentolamine, was less effective. One hour in (-)-isoproterenol inhibited migration to the same degree as continuous exposure for the 6 hr most experiments were allowed to run. Taken together, the data suggest that catecholamines exert their effect on epidermal cell migration via beta 2 adrenergic receptors on the cell surface, a binding site which implicates cAMP in the chain of events.", 
    "69": "Using pregnant Wistar rats a comparative study was carried out, which was aimed to investigate the effect of long-term tocolysis (second half of gestation) with fenoterol alone as well as in combination with the cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol (Beloc) upon the level of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in maternal pulmonal, myocardial and myometrial tissue and in the myocardium of the fetuses. Radioimmunologic assessment of cyclic AMP tissue concentrations was used to obtain a parameter for beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. During treatment with fenoterol alone a significant rise of cyclic-AMP could be observed in all tissues, fetal myocardium showing the most pronounced rise. When combining fenoterol and metoprolol no derangement of the desired therapeutical beta 2-effect upon myometrium and lung could be found. Cyclic-AMP concentration in the maternal myocardium, however, was reduced significantly after combination therapy as compared to the monotherapy group, stressing the cardioprotective effect of metoprolol during beta 2-mimetic therapy, which yet has been demonstrated by means of other experimental models. As a similar tendency could be found in fetal myocardium, the conclusion may be drawn that combining metoprolol with fenoterol exerts also a fetal cardioprotection during beta 2-mimetic therapy of pregnant individuals. Furthermore possible effects of this combined therapy upon fetal beta-adrenergic reactions in general are discussed in this study.", 
    "70": "Dopaminergic agonists which act on adenylate cyclase-linked dopamine receptor sites (D1-type) (dopamine, apomorphine and ADTN) induced a dose-dependent increase in the incorporation of L-fucose and D-mannose into glycoproteins of hippocampal, striatal and cortical slices of rat and mouse brain, whilst in rat liver slices dopamine failed to elicit such alterations in protein glycosylation. Testing in slices of rat hippocampus dopaminergic agonists with selective affinity to D2-receptors (bromocriptine, ergometrine) no changes in sugar incorporation into glycoproteins of rat hippocampus were observed. Dopamine stimulated L-fucose incorporation into rat hippocampal glycoproteins was inhibited to a different degree, but almost incompletely by dopamine receptor antagonists like haloperidol, D-butaclamol, promazine and alpha-flupenthixol, whilst chloropromazine and the selective D2-receptor antagonist sulpiride were without any effects. Also serotonin receptor antagonists (cinanserine) and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (pindolol, alprenolol, practolol) failed to interfere with this dopamine action. But D,L-propranolol enhanced dopamine stimulated glycosylation of rat hippocampal proteins in an additive synergistic manner. This effect appeared to be not related to the antagonistic action of propranolol on beta-adrenergic receptor sites. From our results it is concluded that interactions with dopamine receptor sites (D1-type) is only one part of the mechanism triggering dopamine stimulated glycosylation of brain proteins in vitro.", 
    "71": "More than 40 drugs are known to increase muscle relaxation, to aggravate myasthenia gravis, or to induce myasthenic syndromes in \"normal\" individuals with or without a known impaired safety factor. Many of these drugs have been known for a long time. In the last ten years some other drugs have been added to the long list: Penicillamine, beta-adrenergic blockers, carnitine, some antibiotics, lithium carbonate, catharactics containing magnesium salts, etc. An immunological basis for the penicillamine-induced myasthenia gravis is generally approved, but there may be other examples such as trimethadione and phenytoin. The knowledge of these possible side effects is important for the interpretation of unwanted effects, particularly diplopia and other mild myasthenic symptoms.", 
    "72": "Systolic time intervals (STI) were measured at rest before and after an exercise training programme in 37 patients with ischemic heart disease; 17 patients were treated with a beta-blocking drug (BB-group) and 20 were not (nBB-group). After the training period peak oxygen uptake had increased by 37% in the BB-patients and by 41% in the nBB-group. During the training period electromechanical systole (QS2) and pre-ejection period (PEP), when corrected for heart rate, shortened significantly in all 37 patients. Left ventricular ejection time (LVET) increased but when corrected for heart rate no significant changes occurred. The ratio of PEP/LVET decreased significantly. The changes in STI were similar in the patients treated with beta-blocking drugs than in those without such treatment. The changes in STI in both groups suggest that left ventricular function improves during the training period and that beta-adrenergic blockade does not alter this outcome.", 
    "73": "The 3-aminobutane homolog (HMDA) of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) was synthesized and compared to MDA for acute pharmacologic/toxicologic properties in mice. The lethality of intraperitoneal doses of HMDA equalled or exceeded that of MDA, depending on whether mice were grouped or isolated after dosing. All deaths with HMDA occurred by 6 hours, while many were delayed to 6-24 hours for MDA, particularly in the aggregated condition. Rather similar response patterns were seen for the N-methylated derivatives of MDA and HMDA. Catecholaminergic receptor blockers, haloperidol, propranolol and phenoxybenzamine, which previously were found protective against MDA lethality, were ineffective against HMDA. However, phenoxybenzamine supplemented a protective action of phenobarbital toward HMDA lethality. The dose-related pattern of locomotor activity effects of HMDA differed from the one seen for MDA, which has been suggested to characterize hallucinogenic agents. Thus, HMDA differs qualitatively in actions from MDA and tends to be more toxic acutely for mice.", 
    "74": "54 healthy volunteers took part in 3 placebo controlled double-blind trials designed partly as crossover, partly as parallel group studies. The long-acting (elimination half-life greater than 24 h) test drugs diazepam (DIA 5; 10 mg) and flurazepam (FLU 30 mg) were compared to the short-acting drugs (elimination half-life less than 12 h) lormetazepam (LOR 1.5; 2 mg) and mepindolol sulfate (MEP 10 mg; betablocker) following acute or subchronic application. Alcohol (ALC; 0.4-0.8 per mill blood ALC concentration) was used as a compound interfering with the test drugs. Measurements with the driving simulator TS2 were taken at different times between 1 h and 15 h p.a.", 
    "75": "Subchronic use of FLU causes significant impairment of driving performance the next morning in contrast to LOR which even increases the driving ability. The ALC potentiating effect of LOR is larger than that of DIA after acute intake. MEP acts like placebo but reduces blood pressure and heart rate. Interaction of LOR and ALC in the evening does not result in a prolonged hangover effect which could disturb driving performance the next morning.", 
    "76": "Short-acting benzodiazepines without active metabolites have a profound advantage over those with long-acting accumulating characteristics in respect to matutinal car driving ability, if those drugs are used as nighttime hypnotics. These results highlight the necessity of screening hypnotic and tranquilizing drugs concerning their influence on car driving performance at different times after intake and under conditions of interactions with psychotropic drugs, especially alcohol. In view of future methodological requirements a revised model of driving simulation is presented. It is based on a coherent description of the system \"driver-vehicle environment\" at the level of visual conditions, vehicle behaviour and driver performance. Preliminary data are shown.", 
    "77": "A group of dopamine antagonists have been studied for their ability to suppress the intraocular pressure (IOP) recovery rate of rabbits infused with hypertonic saline. All dopamine antagonists examined were either equipotent or more potent than beta-adrenergic blocker, timolol, to lower the IOP in the following order: haloperidol greater than moperone = trifluperidol greater than clofluperol = pipamperone = lenperone = timolol. Contrary to timolol, haloperidol, moperone and trifluperidol relaxed histamine pretreated guinea pig tracheal muscle at doses as low as 0.03-1.0 microgram/ml, whereas cardiac contractility and heart rate were little suppressed at doses up to 3 micrograms/ml. Since dopamine antagonists do not block the beta-adrenergic receptors and the ophthalmic dose required to lower IOP is only a small fraction of the antipsychotic doses, it is concluded that dopamine antagonists could be used for glaucoma treatment with little noticeable side effects, if any.", 
    "78": "A case of severe amitriptyline poisoning with grade IV coma, seizures, bradycardia and hypotension who did not respond to dopamine was successfully treated with prenalterol, a new cardioselective beta-agonist. The case is discussed with respect to plasma concentrations of dopamine, prenalterol and amitriptyline. Prenalterol, hydrocortisone and insulin may be useful as inotropic agents in tricyclic poisoning where dopamine fails to provide an adequate response.", 
    "79": "Three different doses (50, 100 and 200 mg) of prizidilol hydrochloride (SK&F 92657), a novel antihypertensive agent with vasodilating and beta-adrenoreceptor blocking properties, were given to three (n = 5) groups of essential hypertensive patients in order to evaluate hypotensive dose-response relationship of the drug and its beta-adrenoreceptor blocking properties. Irrespective of the dose given, acute administration of prizidilol did not effectively decrease blood pressure; however after one-week of treatment prizidilol was effective in reducing blood pressure at both the 100 and the 200 mg b.i.d. schedules. At these doses the drug decreased resting heart rate and plasma renin activity for the first 4-6 h after both acute and steady-state dosing. Similarly postdynamic exercise tachycardia was reduced to a significant extent by the drug; after acute administration this effect lasted 2 h with the lowest dose and 4 h with the highest one. After chronic administration this effect lasted up to 10 h for both the 100 and 200 mg doses. These data indicate that: chronic prizidilol treatment can achieve a satisfactory control of blood pressure in patients with mild-moderate essential hypertension; when prizidilol is administered chronically in hypertensive patients, an equally effective control of blood pressure can be obtained with either a 200 mg b.i.d. or a 100 mg b.i.d. schedule; prizidilol possesses beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties in man which can contribute to its pharmacodynamic activity."
