    "20": "A dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis represents a prominent finding in major depression, possibly related to a dysfunction of the corticosteroid receptor system. Antidepressants are involved in the restoration of the altered feed-back mechanism of the HPA-axis, probably via normalization of corticosteroid receptor functions. Since Hypericum perforatum has antidepressive properties, we here examined its putative actions on glucocorticosteroid receptor mRNA levels in human blood cells as a peripheral model for neuroendocrine effects in human brain cells. Our data show that Hypericum (LI 160) affects the cellular mRNA levels of both, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-\u03b1 and its inhibitory counterpart, the GR-\u03b2, at clinically-relevant concentrations. Under these conditions, a bimodal effect was observed. Dose-response studies suggest a rather small effective concentration range and time-effect data show a primary and transient up-regulation of GR-\u03b1 mRNA levels and a down-regulation of GR-\u03b2 mRNA levels after 16\u00a0h of treatment. The sodium channel blocker benzamil neutralized the effects of Hypericum, pointing to an at least partial mechanism of action via this pathway. In conclusion, Hypericum treatment differentially affects GR-mRNA levels in the human system. Our data suggest a bimodal effect on GR, resulting in a time-and dose-related modification of GR-mediated cellular effects. Such a mechanism has been alleged as an important way of action for a number of antidepressants. It is the first time that a specific effect on both receptors, especially on the subtype of GR-\u03b2, is shown under antidepressive treatment in a human system under in vitro conditions.",

However, in 10 to 15% of cases such as segmental and multifocal IH, locations in the periocular, airway and perineal areas, or complications of ulceration, treatment is necessary. Moreover, the risk of permanent scarring and disfigurement associated with IH, even if involution is complete, has been increasingly recognized as a rationale for treatment. Treatments for IH currently include topical, intralesional, systemic therapies, laser and surgical modalities depending on the clinical scenario. However, clinicians must carefully weigh the risks and benefits for each treatment.

    "29": "Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is the most popular method for assessing the fractal characteristics of heart rate (HR). Traditionally, short-term and long-term scale coefficients, \u03b1(1) and \u03b1(2), are calculated from DFA. We recently showed that the traditional approach oversimplifies a more complex phenomenon better represented by a continuous spectrum of scale coefficients. In this paper we present a DFA based method for describing the HR fractal dynamics with a temporal spectrum of scale exponents, \u03b1(t), rather than by a model of lumped parameters, \u03b1(1) and \u03b1(2). Since \u03b1(t) is a function of the temporal scale, its interpretation is facilitated when conditions with different mean HR are compared. In this work, we reanalyze HR data, collected by our group in previous studies, by applying the proposed \u03b1(t) spectrum. We quantify the effects of gender, ageing, posture and activity level, and the alterations induced by exposure to high and very-high altitude hypoxia, on \u03b1(t). Most of the results may be interpreted in terms of changes of cardiac autonomic regulation, and indicate clearly that the new proposed DFA spectrum provides a more faithful and interpretable description of the HR fractal dynamics than traditional \u03b1(1) and \u03b1(2) scale coefficients.",

    "45": "INTRODUCTION.\u2003High-dose insulin therapy, along with glucose supplementation, has emerged as an effective treatment for severe beta-blocker and calcium channel-blocker poisoning. We review the experimental data and clinical experience that suggests high-dose insulin is superior to conventional therapies for these poisonings. PRESENTATION AND GENERAL MANAGEMENT.\u2003Hypotension, bradycardia, decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and cardiogenic shock are characteristic features of beta-blocker and calcium-channel blocker poisoning. Initial treatment is primarily supportive and includes saline fluid resuscitation which is essential to correct vasodilation and low cardiac filling pressures. Conventional therapies such as atropine, glucagon and calcium often fail to improve hemodynamic status in severely poisoned patients. Catecholamines can increase blood pressure and heart rate, but they also increase SVR which may result in decreases in cardiac output and perfusion of vascular beds. The increased myocardial oxygen demand that results from catecholamines and vasopressors may be deleterious in the setting of hypotension and decreased coronary perfusion. METHODS. The Medline, Embase, Toxnet, and Google Scholar databases were searched for the years 1975-2010 using the terms: high-dose insulin, hyperinsulinemia-euglycemia, beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker, toxicology, poisoning, antidote, toxin-induced cardiovascular shock, and overdose. In addition, a manual search of the Abstracts of the North American Congress of Clinical Toxicology and the Congress of the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists published in Clinical Toxicology for the years 1996-2010 was undertaken. These searches identified 485 articles of which 72 were considered relevant. MECHANISMS OF HIGH-DOSE INSULIN BENEFIT. There are three main mechanisms of benefit: increased inotropy, increased intracellular glucose transport, and vascular dilatation. EFFICACY OF HIGH-DOSE INSULIN. Animal models have shown high-dose insulin to be superior to calcium salts, glucagon, epinephrine, and vasopressin in terms of survival. Currently, there are no published controlled clinical trials in humans, but a review of case reports and case series supports the use of high-dose insulin as an initial therapy. HIGH-DOSE INSULIN TREATMENT PROTOCOLS.\u2003When first introduced, insulin doses were cautiously initiated at 0.5 U/kg bolus followed by a 0.5-1 U/kg/h continuous infusion due to concern for hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalances. With increasing clinical experience and the publication of animal studies, high-dose insulin dosing recommendations have been increased to 1 U/kg insulin bolus followed by a 1-10 U/kg/h continuous infusion. Although the optimal regimen is still to be determined, bolus doses up to 10 U/kg and continuous infusions as high as 22 U/kg/h have been administered with good outcomes and minimal adverse events. ADVERSE EFFECTS OF HIGH-DOSE INSULIN.\u2003The major anticipated adverse events associated with high-dose insulin are hypoglycemia and hypokalemia. Glucose concentrations must be monitored regularly and supplementation of glucose will likely be required throughout therapy and for up to 24 h after discontinuation of high-dose insulin. The change in serum potassium concentrations reflects a shifting of potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space rather than a decrease in total body stores. CONCLUSIONS.\u2003While more clinical data are needed, animal studies and human case reports demonstrate that high-dose insulin (1-10 U/kg/hour) is a superior treatment in terms of safety and survival in both beta-blocker and calcium-channel blocker poisoning. High-dose insulin should be considered initial therapy in these poisonings.",

The results showed that under all of the assembly conditions considered the growth of the films is nonlinear. The thickness of the PAA layers increases as the pH of the assembling solutions decreases, whereas the adsorption of CHI is almost unaffected by the pH conditions. The comparison of the thickness obtained by D-QCM and by ellipsometry has allowed us to calculate the water content of the films, showing that the multilayers are highly hydrated, with an average water content higher than 20%. The analysis of D-QCM data has provided high-frequency values of the complex shear modulus that are in the megapascal range and shows a transition from mainly viscous to mainly elastic behavior for the added PAA layers, depending on the pH. The monomer surface density in each layer (obtained from the combination of ellipsometry and differential refractive index measurements) indicated that the monomer density depends on the assembly conditions. It was found that the adsorption kinetics is a bimodal process, with characteristic times that depend on the number and nature of the layers. Finally, the possibility of using of these multilayers as a drug storage and delivery system has been evaluated.",

The peptides comprise endogenous FMRFa, present in the western Atlantic clam Sunray Venus, and FIRFa, present in cephalopods, as well as non-endogenous ones for comparison. The interaction is investigated by automated docking. The resulting key hASIC1a-FMRFa complex, set in a lipidic POPC (=1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) membrane surrounded by H(2) O and Na(+) -neutralized, was also investigated by molecular dynamics. It was observed that all investigated peptides become encapsulated into the ion channel, on one side by the thumb and finger of a subunit, and, on the opposite side, by the knuckle and \u03b2-ball of a second subunit. The third subunit is not involved. This is much the same binding site that was disclosed previously by both a similar computational approach, and electrophysiological and binding experiments for the hASIC1a ion channel-blocker tarantula toxin PCTX1.

    "61": "In leukemia patients, stress and anxiety were suggested to predict poorer prognosis. Oncological patients experience ample physiological and psychological stress, potentially leading to increased secretion of stress factors, including epinephrine, corticosteroids, and prostaglandins. Here we tested whether environmental stress and these stress factors impact survival of leukemia-challenged rats, and studied mediating mechanisms. F344 rats were administered with a miniscule dose of 60 CRNK-16 leukemia cells, and were subjected to intermittent forced swim stress or to administration of physiologically relevant doses of epinephrine, prostaglandin-E(2) or corticosterone. Stress and each stress factor, and/or their combinations, doubled mortality rates when acutely applied simultaneously with, or two or six days after tumor challenge. Acute administration of the \u03b2-adrenergic blocker nadolol diminished the effects of environmental stress, without affecting baseline survival rates. Prolonged \u03b2-adrenergic blockade or COX inhibition (using etodolac) also increased baseline survival rates, possibly by blocking tumor-related or normal levels of catecholamines and prostaglandins. Searching for mediating mechanisms, we found that each of the stress factors transiently suppressed NK activity against CRNK-16 and YAC-1 lines on a per NK basis. In contrast, the direct effects of stress factors on CRNK-16 proliferation, vitality, and VEGF secretion could not explain or even contradicted the in vivo survival findings. Overall, it seems that environmental stress, epinephrine, and prostaglandins promote leukemia progression in rats, potentially through suppressing cell mediated immunity. Thus, patients with hematological malignancies, which often exhibit diminished NK activity, may benefit from extended \u03b2-blockade and COX inhibition.", 
    "62": "Foci of fibrosis, footprints of cardiomyocyte necrosis, are scattered throughout the failing myocardium and are a major component to its pathologic remodeling. Understanding pathogenic mechanisms contributing to hormone-mediated necrosis is therefore fundamental to developing cardioprotective strategies. In this context, a mitochondriocentric signal-transducer-effector pathway to necrosis is emerging. Our first objective, using cardiomyocytes and subsarcolemmal mitochondria (SSM) harvested from rats receiving a 4-week aldosterone/salt treatment (ALDOST), was to identify the major components of this pathway. Second, to validate this pathway, we used mitochondria-targeted pharmaceutical interventions as cardioprotective strategies using 4-week cotreatment with either carvedilol (Carv) or nebivolol (Nebiv). Compared with controls, we found the 4-week ALDOST to be accompanied by elevated cardiomyocyte free [Ca(2+)]i and SSM free [Ca(2+)]m; increased H(2)O(2) production and 8-isoprostane in SSM, cardiac tissue, and plasma; and enhanced opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and myocardial scarring. Increments in the antioxidant capacity augmented by increased cytosolic free [Zn(2+)]i were overwhelmed. Cotreatment with either Carv or Nebiv attenuated [Ca(2+)]i and [Ca(2+)]m overloading, prevented oxidative stress, and reduced mPTP opening while augmenting [Zn(2+)]i and conferring cardioprotection. Thus, major components of the mitochondriocentric signal-transducer-effector pathway to cardiomyocyte necrosis seen with ALDOST include intracellular Ca overloading coupled to oxidative stress and mPTP opening. This subcellular pathway can be favorably regulated by Carv or Nebiv cotreatment to salvage cardiomyocytes and prevent fibrosis.",

    "69": "Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) acts as an endogenous gaseous transmitter in the central nervous system and plays important roles in regulating cardiovascular function. The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) is a putative critical central region in the control of sympathetic vasomotor tone and plays an important role in the baroreflex by integrating the inputs from a variety of visceral and somatic stimuli. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that H(2)S decreases sympathetic vasomotor tone through ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K(ATP)) in the RVLM. The arterial blood pressure (ABP), heart rate (HR), and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) of anesthetized rats were recorded. Bilateral microinjections of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS; 4, 8, and 16 mM, 50 nl), an H(2)S donor, into the RVLM decreased ABP, HR, and RSNA in a dose-dependent manner. Preinjection of glibenclamide (40 \u03bcM, 50 nl), a K(ATP) channel blocker, abolished the sympathoinhibitory effects of NaHS (8 mM, 50 nl). Preinjection of a nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor, N(\u03c9)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (200 \u03bcM, 50 nl) partially inhibited the sympathoinhibitory effects of NaHS. Prior microinjection of 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-4-(2-[trifluoromethyl]phenyl)pyridine-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester (Bay K8644) (1 \u03bcM, 50 nl), an agonist of Ca(2+) channels, did not alter the effects of NaHS. Infusion of hydroxylamine (30 mM, 50 nl), a cystathionine \u03b2-synthase inhibitor, increased ABP, HR, and RSNA. Taken together, these findings suggest that exogenous H(2)S in the RVLM inhibits sympathetic vasomotor tone by opening K(ATP) channels. Nitric-oxide signaling may partially be involved in the sympathoinhibitory effect of H(2)S in the RVLM.",

The aims of the present study were to 1) investigate how the stimulation parameters of the CCM signal and the location of stimulus delivery influence the contractile response, 2) characterise the effect of CCM on ventricular electrophysiology, and 3) investigate the potential physiological mechanisms underlying these acute inotropic and electrophysiological effects. Experiments were conducted in isolated rabbit hearts with simultaneous measurement of ventricular contractility and monophasic action potential duration (MAPD). Biphasic square wave pulses were applied to the left ventricle, timed to coincide with the absolute refractory period. CCM mediated responses were assessed over a range of signal amplitudes (2-30 mA), durations (2-15 ms) and delays from the activation of the locally recorded monophasic action potential (0-30 ms). Responses were assessed during perfusion with the \u03b21-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol (1.8 \u03bcM) and HMR 1556 (500 nM), an inhibitor of the slow delayed rectifying potassium current. Norepinephrine content was collected and assessed by ELISA from samples of coronary effluent collected during CCM. CCM induced a significant increase in left ventricular pressure (LVP) in a manner dependent upon the amplitude and duration of the CCM signal but independent of the delay of the stimulus within the action potential plateau and was associated with an increase in norepinephrine in coronary effluent (Mean: 46\u00b19 pg/ml). CCM promoted a shortening of MAPD-90% close to the site of stimulation (-19\u00b13%) but had no effect on those recorded at distant sites (0\u00b11%). The increase in LVP (4.7\u00b11.8 vs. 0.7\u00b10.9%, P<0.01) and shortening of local MAPD-90% (-15\u00b13 vs. 1\u00b11%, P<0.01) was abolished with metoprolol. Perfusion with HMR 1556 caused a significant inhibition of local MAPD shortening (-27\u00b12 vs. -21\u00b13 ms, P<0.05). CCM is associated with a shortening of ventricular MAPD in a manner dependent upon \u03b2-adrenoceptor stimulation resulting from catecholamine release, a finding which may be of clinical significance in regard to the development of malignant ventricular arrhythmias.

    "82": "A major challenge in current cardiology is to predict who will die suddenly from ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular arrhythmias are the most common cause of sudden cardiac death, occurring in about 1-2:1,000 inhabitants yearly, and is most frequently due to coronary artery disease. Patients with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias can be offered medical treatment and ultimately an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) is currently the main risk stratification tool used to select patients for ICD therapy. However, EF is insufficient in predicting arrhythmic risk. A number of techniques have been presented to improve arrhythmic risk stratification without having reached clinical utility. Conduction abnormalities and dispersion of action potential duration forms the substrate for malignant ventricular arrhythmias in infarcted tissue as in several cardiomyopathies. The ability to assess electrical dispersion in patients noninvasively has been limited. Myocardial strain by echocardiography has been presented as an accurate tool for assessing myocardial function and timing.

Primary outcomes were rate of decline in measured glomerular filtration rate and a composite of a decrease in glomerular filtration rate by >50% or >25 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), requirement for dialysis, transplantation, or death. Intention-to-treat analyses showed no evidence of a BP effect on either the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate or the clinical composite outcome.

    "88": "The 17th century London neuroanatomical school headed by Thomas Willis provided us with the first identifiable images of the sympathetic nervous system. Nineteenth century giants of European physiology (Bernard, Waller and Brown-Sequard) identified these as the 'pressor nerves'. Von Euler's demonstration that the sympathetic transmitter was noradrenaline brought the field into the modern era. The development of ganglion-blocking drugs by Paton, whose name this review commemorates, allowed comprehensive pharmacological antagonism of this system in patients. With the development of contemporary techniques for recording from human sympathetic nerves and quantifying rates of noradrenaline release, the sympathetic nervous system became accessible to clinical scientists investigating possible contributions to cardiovascular and other diseases. Sympathetic nervous system responses typically are regionally differentiated, with activation in one outflow sometimes accompanying no change or sympathetic inhibition in another. Regional sympathetic activity is best studied in humans by recording from postganglionic sympathetic efferents (multi-unit or single-fibre recording) and by isotope dilution-derived measurement of organ-specific noradrenaline release to plasma from sympathetic nerves (regional 'noradrenaline spillover'). With the application of these techniques, evidence has been assembled in the past three decades which indicates that sympathetic nervous system activation is crucial in the development of cardiovascular disorders, most notably heart failure and essential hypertension. An important goal for clinical scientists is translation of knowledge of pathophysiology, such as this, into better treatment for patients. The achievement of this 'mechanisms to management' transition is mature in cardiac failure, with knowledge of cardiac neural pathophysiology having led to introduction of \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, an effective therapy. Perhaps we are now on the cusp of effective translation in patients with essential hypertension, with recent successful testing of selective catheter-based renal sympathetic nerve ablation in patients with resistant hypertension, an intervention firmly based on prior demonstration in them of activation of the renal sympathetic outflow.",

    "96": "The interaction of two drugs of small molecular size, propranolol and tetracaine, and the membrane-perturbing peptide melittin with a phospholipid bilayer supported on a SiO2 surface was studied with the quartz crystal microbalance. All three bioactive compounds interacted with the lipid bilayer and changed its viscoelastic properties. Adsorbed mass of the compounds was analyzed with a viscoelastic model as a function of the concentration of the compounds in the aqueous phase, as well as the effect of the compounds on the bilayer viscoelasticity. The analysis was based on the interpretation of the impedance of the crystal, utilizing the 5th, 7th and 9th overtone of the fundamental 5 MHz resonance frequency.", 
    "97": "A sensitive and efficient method was developed for the determination of atenolol in human urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Atenolol and metoprolol (internal standard, IS) were extracted from human urine with a mixture of chloroform and butanol at basic pH with liquid-liquid extraction. The extracts were derivatized with N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) and analyzed by GC-MS using a capillary column. The standard curve was linear (r = 0.99) over the concentration range of 50-750 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-day precision, expressed as the relative standard deviation were less than 5.0%, and accuracy (relative error) was better than 7.0%. The analytical recovery of atenolol from human urine has averaged 91%. The limit of quantification was 50 ng/mL. Also, the method was successfully applied to a patient with hypertension who had been given an oral tablet of 50 mg atenolol.", 
    "98": "According to the convincing evidence, a decline in mortality rate has been achieved with beta-blockers in patients with an acute myocardial infarction and in post-infarction follow-up. In fact, there has been a clear reduction of sudden coronary death. The necessary condition for the efficiency of beta-blockers is an early use. They are also a medication of choice for angina after an infarction. The objective of this work was to evaluate the use of beta-blockers after a myocardial infarction in various clinical states and to eliminate doubts concerning their prescription.", 
    "99": "Even in conditions considered contraindications for administration of beta blockers such as old age, diabetes, non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, arterial disease, heart insufficiency; ventricular arrhythmias, renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and depression, patients benefit from beta blockers when they are given along with a right choice of the medication and a regular followup of the patient. Preference is given to cardioselective beta blockers in patients with diabetes or lung disease. Beta-blockers do not cause long-term lipid alterations. Therefore, the matter of clinically significant alterations of lipids or blood glucose levels should not need further consideration as a problem of the treatment of diabetics.", 
    "100": "Investigations have proved that the use of beta-blockers reduces the development of cerebrovascular accidents, heart insufficiency and hypertension. Despite strong arguments and numerous recommendations, beta-blockers have not been accepted to a sufficient extent as an integral part of treatment of acute coronary syndrome and related diseases, to the detriment of many lost lives and in spite of favourable pharmaco-economic aspect.", 
    "101": "Cardiovascular diseases and their treatment pose a great challenge. Many instances of cardiovascular disease occur in the early morning hours. Hence, the objective of this study was to develop a time-controlled release formulation of metoprolol succinate based on a pulsatile multiparticulate (pellets) drug delivery system. The formulation was intended to be administered in the evening at 22:00 hours to evaluate symptoms of cardiovascular disease that are experienced in the early morning hours (from 04:00 to 06:00). Drug layering followed by a swelling layer and finally by an insoluble coat application was done using a Sanmour fluid bed processor. Metoprolol succinate layered on sugar pellets (74% w/w) layered with 20% (w/w) ion doshion resin P-547 and coated with 15% (w/w) ethocel with the addition of 20% castor oil showed a lag time of 4 h and was then followed a sigmoidal release pattern with more than 95% drug having been released by the 10(th) h.",

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging revealed asymmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy with mid-ventricular obstruction and an apical aneurysm. His coronary angiography was normal, and his ventricular tachycardia was induced by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without ischemia. Apical aneurysmectomy, left ventricular reconstruction, and cryoablation at the rim of the aneurysm were performed. Fifteen days after the operation, an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted. The postoperative course was uneventful, and ventricular tachyarrhythmia did not recur during 18 months of follow-up.", 
    "103": "The X-ray crystal structure of the turkey \u03b2-adrenoceptor has recently been determined. However, mutations were introduced into the native receptor that was essential for structure determination. These may cause alterations to the receptor pharmacology. It is therefore essential to understand the effects of these mutations on the pharmacological characteristics of the receptor. This study examined the pharmacological effects of both the m23 mutations and the \u03b236 deletions, both alone and then in combination in the \u03b236-m23 mutant used in the crystallisation and structure determination of the turkey \u03b2-adrenoceptor. Stable CHO-K1 cell lines were made of each of the receptor mutants and the affinity and efficacy of ligands assessed by (3)H-CGP 12177 whole cell ligand binding, (3)H-cAMP accumulation, and CRE-SPAP gene transcription assays. The m23 mutations reduced affinity for agonists, partial agonists and neutral antagonists by about tenfold whilst the \u03b236 deletions alone had no effect on ligand affinity. Both sets of changes appeared to reduce the agonist activation of the receptor. Both the m23 and the \u03b236 receptors retained two active agonist-induced receptor conformations similar to that of the original t\u03b2trunc receptor. The combined \u03b236-m23 receptor bound ligands with similar affinity to the m23 receptor; however, agonist activation was only observed with a few agonists including the catecholamines. Although the combination of mutations severely reduced the activation ability, the final crystallised receptor (\u03b236-m23) was still a fully functional receptor capable of binding agonist and antagonist ligands and activating intracellular agonist responses.", 
    "104": "Statins are frequently used as chronic therapy for reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, but there has been less emphasis on the role of statins in the perioperative period. This review evaluates data regarding statin use in vascular and noncardiac surgery, the use of statins in combination with \u03b2-blockers in the perioperative period, perioperative statin use in patients already treated with statins, and the safety of statin therapy in the perioperative period. Current recommendations state that patients who are prescribed statins as chronic therapy should continue treatment in the perioperative period, but data suggest that there may be benefit from the use of perioperative statins in a wider population.", 
    "105": "PURPOSE. The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and place in therapy of nebivolol are reviewed. SUMMARY. Nebivolol, a third-generation, highly \u03b2(1)-specific \u03b2-blocker, is labeled for the treatment of hypertension in the United States. In addition to its \u03b2-blocking effects, nebivolol has been shown to increase endothelin-dependent nitric oxide, giving it a unique peripheral vasodilatory action. Nebivolol is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme 2D6. In patients with heart failure, certain \u03b2-blockers antagonize excessive adrenergic stimulation and can slow the progression of the disease. Clinical trials have compared nebivolol at target dosages of 5 and 10 mg once daily with placebo and, in small trials, with carvedilol in the treatment of adults with chronic heart failure. Nebivolol appears to have beneficial effects in patients with heart failure, including improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular volumes, and exercise capacity. In addition, the Study of the Effects of Nebivolol Intervention on Outcomes and Rehospitalisation in Seniors with Heart Failure showed a reduction in morbidity and mortality after treatment with nebivolol when compared with placebo, though this effect appeared to be less than that of other \u03b2-blockers currently recommended for the treatment of heart failure. Nebivolol was well tolerated in all clinical trials, with the most frequently reported adverse events including bradycardia, hypotension, and dizziness. To date, no large clinical trials have compared nebivolol with currently recommended \u03b2-blockers in patients with heart failure. CONCLUSION. Nebivolol has beneficial effects in heart failure but cannot be considered equivalent to other currently accepted therapies.", 
    "106": "Statins decrease postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) if given before cardiac surgery. However, whether early administration of statins after surgery decreases the risk of postoperative AF is unknown. The association of early reinstitution of postoperative statin therapy within 48 hours to the occurrence of postoperative AF was studied in propensity-adjusted analyses of 200 consecutive patients in sinus rhythm who had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting with or without valve surgery. Postoperative AF occurred in 36 patients (18%). Of 52 patients who received a statin early after surgery, 4 (7.7%) developed AF compared to 32 (28%) of 148 patients who did not (p = 0.043). In the propensity-adjusted analyses, early postoperative statin treatment was associated with a significantly lower occurrence of AF (odds ratio 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.15 to 0.99), irrespective of concomitant \u03b2-blocker therapy. The length of stay was shorter for the patients who received early postoperative statins (median 6.1 days, interquartile range 4 to 7, vs 7.8 days, interquartile range 5 to 8; p = 0.0031). In conclusion, of preoperative statin users undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with or without valve surgery, early postoperative reinstitution of statins was associated with a lower occurrence of postoperative AF and a shorter length of stay. Early postoperative statin therapy might be a feasible and safe method of reducing postoperative AF.", 
    "107": "The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity in both well and under-resourced settings. Maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications of the HDP are concentrated among, but not limited to, women with pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is a systemic disorder of endothelial cell dysfunction and as such, blood pressure (BP) treatment is but one aspect of its management. The most appropriate BP threshold and goal of antihypertensive treatment are controversial. Variation between international guidelines has more to do with differences in opinion rather than differences in published data. For women with severe hypertension [defined as a sustained systolic BP (sBP) of \u2265160 mmHg and/or a diastolic BP (dBP) of \u2265110 mmHg], there is consensus that antihypertensive therapy should be given to lower the maternal risk of central nervous system complications. The bulk of the evidence relates to parenteral hydralazine and labetalol, or to oral calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine capsules. There is, however, no consensus regarding management of non-severe hypertension (defined as a sBP of 140-159 mmHg or a dBP of 90-109 mmHg), because the relevant randomized trials have been underpowered to define the maternal and perinatal benefits and risks. Although antihypertensive therapy may decrease the occurrence of BP values of 160-170/100-110 mmHg, therapy may also impair fetal growth. The potential benefits and risks do not seem to be associated with any particular drug or drug class. Oral labetalol and methyldopa are used most commonly, but many different \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockers and calcium channel blockers have been studied in clinical trials.", 
    "108": "In our recent studies, the reversal of the enantiomer migration order (EMO) was observed with heptakis (2,3-dimethyl-6-sulfo)-\u03b2-CD (HDMS-\u03b2-CD) when aqueous electrolyte was changed with nonaqueous electrolyte in CE. One-dimensional rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments prevailed that an inclusion complex was formed between the analyte and the chiral selector in the aqueous buffer, whereas an external complex resulted when a methanolic electrolyte was employed. In the case of the similarly substituted heptakis (2,3-diacetyl-6-sulfo)-\u03b2-CD (HDAS-\u03b2-CD), the external complex was observed in the aqueous buffer but an inclusion complex was formed in methanolic electrolyte. In contrast to heptakis (2,3-dimethyl-6-sulfo)-\u03b2-CD, no reversal of the enantiomer migration order was observed with HDAS-\u03b2-CD. In the present study, further mechanisms of enantioselective recognition and separation of propranolol enantiomers with HDAS-\u03b2-CD were investigated by using different techniques of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry. To the best of our knowledge, enantioselective nuclear Overhauser effect was observed for the first time in this study.", 
    "109": "Lipid implants prepared by melting and casting offer a great potential for advanced drug delivery. However, care must be taken with respect to the solid state of the lipid(s) and potential changes thereof during storage. Generally, a thermal aftertreatment is required. However, little is known about the impact of the curing time and temperature on drug release. The aim of this study was to better understand the importance of these parameters for different types of implants containing propranolol hydrochloride. Hydrogenated cottonseed oil and hydrogenated soybean oil were used as matrix formers. The implants were characterized with respect to their in vitro release kinetics, water uptake, thermal properties, and morphology. On the basis of these experimental results, a mechanistic mathematical model was used to gain further insight into the underlying mass transport mechanisms. Both the curing time and the temperature strongly affected the resulting drug release patterns. Importantly, in most cases, these effects could not be attributed to polymorph transformations but to changes in the implants' microstructure. The size of the lipid particles depended on both the curing time and the temperature, and determined the size of the pores/channels through which water and drug diffuse. The importance of this aspect is often underestimated.", 
    "110": "Observations available for patients with acute heart failure (HF) show conflicting results, and the prognostic role of anaemia ascertained on hospital admission is not well defined. We investigated the database of the Italian Survey on Acute Heart Failure (IS-AHF) to analyze prevalence, factors associated with and the prognostic role of anaemia (defined as haemoglobin < 12 g/dl) in patients hospitalized for acute HF with either depressed or preserved (>40%) ejection fraction (EF). The median haemoglobin level of the 2,318 patients considered in this analysis was 13 g/dl (inter-quartile range 11.5-14.3). The prevalence of anaemia was 31%. Patients who had anaemia were older, more frequently female gender, hospitalized for a chronic destabilized HF, had higher prevalence of preserved EF, hyponatremia, elevated troponin and other comorbidities (including diabetes, peripheral artery disease, chronic renal failure) than those who did not have anaemia. During the hospital stay, they were treated with higher doses of diuretics, and more frequently required mechanical ventilation and ultrafiltration, and less frequently received ACEi/ARB, aldosterone blockers and beta-blockers at hospital discharge. In-hospital mortality was 12.1 and 5.3% in patients with and without anaemia, respectively (p < 0.0001). In the multivariable analysis, anaemia was a significant independent predictor of in-hospital mortality apart from age, low systolic blood pressure, impaired renal function, elevated troponin assay, the non use of beta-blocker and the requirement of inotropic drug. In conclusion, anaemia diagnosed at hospital admission for acute HF is a frequent comorbidity with meaningful implications on the clinical management and prognosis both in patients with reduced and preserved EF.",

We summed the doses of all dispensed drugs per person during a defined time frame. We calculated the PDD (= total dose divided by the number of days) and expressed them as the PDD:DDD ratio (= amount of DDD per day and person).",

The average prescribed dosage of each drug class remained unchanged, even if the patients had previously received another antihypertensive drug with another PDD:DDD ratio. For example, if patients were switched from a beta-blocker to an ACEI, the PDD:DDD ratio increased, on average, from 0.79 to 2.17. Vice versa, the ratio decreased for patients with a drug change from an ACEI to a beta-blocker from 2.06 to 0.75.",

    "115": "Drug-seeking behavior is maintained by encounters with drug-associated cues. Preventing retrieval of drug-associated memories that these cues provoke would therefore limit relapse susceptibility; however, little is known regarding the mechanisms of retrieval. Here, we show that \u03b2-adrenergic receptor activation is necessary for the retrieval of a cocaine-associated memory. Using a conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure, rats were conditioned to associate one chamber, but not another, with cocaine. When administered before a CPP trial, propranolol, but not saline, prevented retrieval of a cocaine-associated CPP. In subsequent drug-free trials, rats previously treated with propranolol continued to show a retrieval deficit, as no CPP was evident. This retrieval deficit was long lasting and robust, as the CPP did not re-emerge during a test for spontaneous recovery 14 days later or reinstate following a priming injection of cocaine. Moreover, the peripheral \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist sotalol did not affect retrieval. Thus, retrieval of cocaine-associated memories is mediated by norepinephrine acting at central \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. Our findings support the use of propranolol, a commonly prescribed \u03b2-blocker, as an adjunct to exposure therapy for the treatment of addiction by preventing retrieval of drug-associated memories during and long after treatment, and by providing protection against relapse.",

Serum markers of neurohumoral activation [brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)], endothelin-1 (ET-1), noradrenaline (NA), and echocardiographic parameters of left ventricle-function were determined at hospital admission and the day before discharge. Using SDF imaging, MFI was evaluated at both time-points in semi-quantitative vessel categories (small: 10-25 \u03bcm; medium: 26-50 \u03bcm; and large: 51-100 \u03bcm). At admission, increased serum levels of BNP, NA, and ET-1 and a severely reduced MFI were observed in association with ADHF.

Cx43-expression in AF was significantly higher in patients receiving metoprolol, while Cx40 expression was unaffected by metoprolol treatment.

    "131": "The present study was aimed at investigating the effect and the possible mechanism of idebenone on endogenous glutamate release in nerve terminals of rat cerebral cortex (synaptosomes). Idebenone inhibited the release of glutamate that was evoked by exposing synaptosomes to the K(+) channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and this phenomenon was concentration dependent. Inhibition of glutamate release by idebenone was prevented by chelating extracellular Ca(2+), or by the vesicular transporter inhibitor bafilomycin A1, but was insensitive to DL-threo-beta-benzyl-oxyaspartate, a glutamate transporter inhibitor. Idebenone decreased the depolarization-induced increase in the cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](C)),whereas it did not alter the resting synaptosomal membrane potential or 4-AP-mediated depolarization. The inhibitory effect of idebenone on evoked glutamate release was prevented by blocking the Ca(v)2.2 (N-type) and Ca(v)2.1 (P/Q-type) channels, but not by blocking intracellular Ca(2+) release or Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange. Furthermore, the idebenone effect on 4-AP-evoked Ca(2+) influx and glutamate release was completely abolished by the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors, H89 and KT5720. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that idebenone inhibits glutamate release from rat cortical synaptosomes and this effect is linked to a decrease in [Ca(2+)](C) contributed by Ca(2+) entry through presynaptic voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels and to the suppression of PKA signaling cascade.",

Here we report a label-free biosensor whole cell assay with microfluidics to determine ligand-directed desensitization of the \u03b2(2)AR. Together with mechanistic deconvolution using small molecule inhibitors, the receptor desensitization and resensitization patterns under the short-term agonist exposure manifested the long-acting agonism of salmeterol, and differentiated the mechanisms of agonist-directed desensitization between a full agonist epinephrine and a partial agonist pindolol.

High dose insulin/glucose (ING), and more recently intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE), have been proposed as potentially beneficial therapies in beta blocker intoxication. We compare efficacy of the novel antidotes ING, with ILE, in a rabbit model of combined enteric/intravenous propranolol toxicity. Methods. Sedated, mechanically ventilated and invasively monitored New Zealand White rabbits underwent mini-laparotomy and enterostomy formation with 40\u2009mg/kg propranolol instilled into the proximal small bowel. At 30 minutes propranolol infusion was commenced at 4\u2009mg/kg/hr and continued to a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 50% baseline MAP. Animals were resuscitated with insulin at 3\u2009U/kg plus 0.5\u2009g/kg glucose (ING group), or 10\u2009mL/kg 20% Intralipid (ILE group). Results. Rate pressure product (RPP; RPP\u2009=\u2009heart rate \u00d7 mean arterial pressure) was greatest in the ING group at 60 minutes (P < .05). A trend toward greater heart rate was observed in the ING group (P = .06). No difference was observed in survival between groups (4/5 ING versus 2/5 ILE; P = .524). Conclusions. High dose insulin resulted in greater rate pressure product compared with lipid emulsion in this rabbit model of severe enteric/intravenous propranolol toxicity.", 
    "136": "The \u03b2(1)-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(1)AR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor whose inactive state structure was determined using a thermostabilized mutant (\u03b2(1)AR-M23). However, it was not thought to be in a fully inactivated state because there was no salt bridge between Arg139 and Glu285 linking the cytoplasmic ends of transmembrane helices 3 and 6 (the R(3.50) - D/E(6.30) \"ionic lock\"). Here we compare eight new structures of \u03b2(1)AR-M23, determined from crystallographically independent molecules in four different crystals with three different antagonists bound. These structures are all in the inactive R state and show clear electron density for cytoplasmic loop 3 linking transmembrane helices 5 and 6 that had not been seen previously. Despite significantly different crystal packing interactions, there are only two distinct conformations of the cytoplasmic end of helix 6, bent and straight. In the bent conformation, the Arg139-Glu285 salt bridge is present, as in the crystal structure of dark-state rhodopsin. The straight conformation, observed in previously solved structures of \u03b2-receptors, results in the ends of helices 3 and 6 being too far apart for the ionic lock to form. In the bent conformation, the R(3.50)-E(6.30) distance is significantly longer than in rhodopsin, suggesting that the interaction is also weaker, which could explain the high basal activity in \u03b2(1)AR compared to rhodopsin. Many mutations that increase the constitutive activity of G-protein-coupled receptors are found in the bent region at the cytoplasmic end of helix 6, supporting the idea that this region plays an important role in receptor activation.",

The presence of BNP > 141 pg/ml in combination with systolic blood pressure < 130 mmHg and left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% identified a group of patients at high risk for drug interruption (interruption frequency = 83%, 95% CI: 55-95%).",

The probability for initiating an average patient with the study drugs varied widely in age-sex-adjusted models at the hospital and physician levels.

    "146": "We recently showed that the bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) blocker icatibant (Icat) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone (Ros) exerted anti-inflammatory effects in renal tubular cells exposed to a diabetic milieu. This study aims to explore whether these effects can be translated to an experimental model of type 2 diabetic nephropathy (DN). db/db mice and their nondiabetic db/m littermates underwent sham operation or uninephrectomy (Unx) at 10 weeks and received vehicle (Veh), metformin (Met), Icat, Ros, or Icat plus Ros for 8 weeks before killing. Among the db/db group with Unx, mice that received Icat or Ros had significantly lower serum creatinine and albuminuria, which was further reduced when Icat and Ros were given in combination. These beneficial effects were not observed in the Met group that achieved similar glycemic control as Ros-treated animals. Likewise, the severity of reactive glomerular and proximal tubular hypertrophy, glomerulosclerosis, interstitial injury, cortical F4/80 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin immunostaining, and CCL-2, ICAM-1 and TGF-\u03b2 overexpression were all attenuated by Icat and Ros, and these effects were enhanced when both agents were combined. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the proximal tubular expression of CCL-2 (inflammation) and TGF-\u03b2 (fibrosis). Treatment with Icat was associated with decreased B2R, but increased, B1R expression, which was exaggerated in Unx animals. At the signaling level, Icat and Ros reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and STAT1 activation, respectively. Our results suggest a deleterious role of the kallikrein-kinin system in murine-accelerated DN, which can be ameliorated by the B2R blocker Icat and enhanced by the addition of Ros. This calls for further evaluation of this novel therapeutic approach in more animal models of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "147": "After cardiac injury, activated cardiac myofibroblasts can influence tissue electrophysiology. Because mechanical coupling through adherens junctions provides a route for intercellular communication, we tested the hypothesis that myofibroblasts exert tonic contractile forces on the cardiomyocytes and affect electric propagation via a process of mechanoelectric feedback.", 
    "148": "The role of mechanoelectric feedback was examined in transforming growth factor-\u03b2-treated monolayers of cocultured myofibroblasts and neonatal rat ventricular cells by inhibiting myofibroblast contraction and blocking mechanosensitive channels. Untreated (control) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2-treated (fibrotic) anisotropic monolayers were optically mapped for electrophysiological comparison. Longitudinal conduction velocity, transverse conduction velocity, and normalized action potential upstroke velocity (dV/dt(max)) significantly decreased in fibrotic monolayers (14.4 \u00b1 0.7 cm/s [mean \u00b1 SEM], 4.1 \u00b1 0.3 cm/s [n=53], and 3.1 \u00b1 0.2% per ms [n=14], respectively) compared with control monolayers (27.2 \u00b1 0.8 cm/s, 8.5 \u00b1 0.4 cm/s [n=40], and 4.9 \u00b1 0.1% per ms [n=12], respectively). Application of the excitation-contraction uncoupler blebbistatin or the mechanosensitive channel blocker gadolinium or streptomycin dramatically increased longitudinal conduction velocity, transverse conduction velocity, and dV/dt(max) in fibrotic monolayers (35.9 \u00b1 1.5 cm/s, 10.3 \u00b1 0.6 cm/s [n=17], and 4.5 \u00b1 0.1% per ms [n=14], respectively). Similar results were observed with connexin43-silenced cardiac myofibroblasts. Spiral-wave induction in fibrotic monolayers also decreased after the aforementioned treatments. Finally, traction force measurements of individual myofibroblasts showed a significant increase with transforming growth factor-\u03b2, a decrease with blebbistatin, and no change with mechanosensitive channel blockers.",

    "150": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the vasodilating \u03b2-blocker nebivolol and the cardioselective \u03b2-blocker metoprolol succinate on aortic blood pressure and left ventricular wall thickness. We conducted a randomized, double-blind study on 80 hypertensive patients. The patients received either 5 mg of nebivolol or 50 to 100 mg of metoprolol succinate daily for 1 year. Their heart rate, central and brachial blood pressures, mean arterial pressure, augmentation index, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, and left ventricular wall thickness were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. Nebivolol and metoprolol significantly reduced heart rate, brachial blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure to the same degree. However, reductions in central systolic and diastolic blood pressures, central pulse pressure, and left ventricular wall thickness were significant only in the nebivolol group. The change in left ventricular septal wall thickness was significantly correlated with central systolic blood pressure change (r=0.41; P=0.001) and with central pulse pressure change (r=0.32; P=0.01). No significant changes in augmentation index or carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity were detected in either treatment group. This proof-of-principle study provides evidence to suggest that \u03b2-blockers with vasodilating properties may offer advantages over conventional \u03b2-blockers in antihypertensive therapy; however, this remains to be tested in a larger trial.", 
    "151": "In the heart, nitric oxide (NO) modulates contractile function; however, the mechanisms responsible for this effect are incompletely understood. NO can elicit effects via a variety of mechanisms including S-nitrosylation and stimulation of cGMP synthesis by soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). sGC is a heterodimer comprised of a \u03b2(1)- and an \u03b1(1)- or \u03b1(2)-subunit. sGC\u03b1(1)\u03b2(1) is the predominant isoform in the heart. To characterize the role of sGC in the regulation of cardiac contractile function by NO, we compared left ventricular cardiac myocytes (CM) isolated from adult mice deficient in the sGC \u03b1(1)-subunit (sGC\u03b1(1)(-/-)) and from wild-type (WT) mice. Sarcomere shortening under basal conditions was less in sGC\u03b1(1)(-/-) CM than in WT CM. To activate endogenous NO synthesis from NO synthase 3, CM were incubated with the \u03b2(3)-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(3)-AR) agonist BRL 37344. BRL 37344 decreased cardiac contractility in WT CM but not in sGC\u03b1(1)(-/-) myocytes. Administration of spermine NONOate, an NO donor compound, did not affect sarcomeric shortening in CM of either genotype; however, in the presence of isoproterenol, addition of spermine NONOate reduced sarcomere shortening in WT but not in sGC\u03b1(1)(-/-) CM. Neither BRL 37344 nor spermine NONOate altered calcium handling in CM of either genotype. These findings suggest that sGC\u03b1(1) exerts a positive inotropic effect under basal conditions, as well as mediates the negative inotropic effect of \u03b2(3)-AR signaling. Additionally, our work demonstrates that sGC\u03b1(1)\u03b2(1) is required for NO to depress \u03b2(1)/\u03b2(2)-AR-stimulated cardiac contractility and that this modulation is independent of changes in calcium handling.", 
    "152": "To study the potential interactions of naringin (NAR), talinolol (TAL) and protein-energy undernutrition (PEU) in the absorption process of saquinavir (SQV), perfusion experiments were performed in the small intestine of rats at different SQV concentrations. The results obtained demonstrated that SQV intestinal absorption was described by simultaneous passive diffusion (k(dif) = 3.44 hr) and saturable absorption (V(ma) = 127.31 \u03bcM/hr; K(ma) = 10.50 \u03bcM) together with a capacity-limited efflux (V(ms) = 270.53 \u03bcM/hr; K(ms) = 23.44 \u03bcM). The competitive inhibition constants of NAR on the SQV input and efflux processes were [IC50](a) = 3.98 \u03bcM and [IC50](s) = 5.00 \u03bcM, respectively. NAR significantly decreased (23-29%; p < 0.05) or kept unaltered the absorption rate constant (k(a) ) of SQV in function of the concentration of both compounds administered. Finally, SQV k(a) significantly increased in PEU status (around 1.8 times) when the drug was perfused either in the presence (p < 0.05) or in the absence (p < 0.01) of NAR. The variations of SQV k(a) when the antiretroviral drug is co-administered with NAR and/or TAL reinforce their interaction in the absorptive process. Malnutrition may result in altered SQV absorption, and further studies are strongly recommended to analyse the impact of this finding on the pharmacokinetic drug profile.", 
    "153": "The \u03b2(3)-adrenegic receptor (\u03b2(3)-AR) selectivity over \u03b2(1)- and \u03b2(2)-ARs has been the most important aspect for successful therapeutic agents for obesity and type-II diabetes, as the concomitant activation of \u03b2(1)- and \u03b2(2)-ARs would lead to undesirable side effects, such as increased heart rate. In order to explore the structural basis for the \u03b2-AR subtype selectivity of agonists and anatagonists, a three-dimensional structure of until date unresolved \u03b2(3)-AR has been modeled, compared with the resolved X-ray structures of \u03b2(1)- and \u03b2(2)-ARs, and used to study its stereoselective binding with until-date known diverse classes of representative agonists and antagonist. The obtained binding structures and calculated prime molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding free energies consistently reveal that while the subtype selectivity is strongly governed by the residues present in the extracellular ends of TM3, TM5, TM6, TM7 helices and of the ECL2 domain, the binding affinity is governed by the conserved residues present in the deep pocket limiting the degree of conformational and rotational freedoms to the bound ligand. The study demonstrates that the key structural requirements for the \u03b2(3)-selectivity are: (i) a negatively ionizable group (NIG) for direct interaction with \u03b2(3)-specific residue R315(6.58), (ii) a linker (9-10 \u00c5 length) between the protonated amine and NIG, and (iii) a substituted aryl ring directly attached to the \u03b2-hydroxyl carbon. The new computational insights acquired in this study are expected to be valuable in structure-based rational design of high-affinity agonists and antagonists with pronounced \u03b2(3)-selectivity for successful therapeutic agents for type-II diabetes and obesity.",

Only the area under the MSE curve for scale 6 to 20 (Area(6-20)) showed the strongest predictive power between survival (n\u200a=\u200a34) and mortality (n\u200a=\u200a6) groups among all the parameters.

We conducted a pharmacoepidemiologic study to examine the incidence of insomnia in hypertensive patients by using a post-marketing surveillance database. The insomnia onset was defined as the time of first prescription of hypnotics. The insomnia incidence rate in hypertensive patients under antihypertensive therapy was 0.77/100 person-years. The median insomnia onset date was 5 weeks. The insomnia type in 50.2% of the patients was difficulty in initiating sleep. We assessed the factors contributing to insomnia by using a nested case-control design. We selected 10 time-matched controls for every case. The hypotensive effect induced by antihypertensive therapy on the case group was lesser than that on the control group (p<0.01). The odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using multivariate conditional logistic regression. The factors contributing to insomnia onset were \u03b1 blockers (OR, 2.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-4.98), \u03b2 blockers (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.99-2.39), and calcium channel blockers (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.90) compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; female sex (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.27-2.44); complication of gastric/duodenal disorders (OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.14-4.86) or musculoskeletal system/connective tissue disorders (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.23-4.79); and concomitant antihypertensive therapy (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.31-0.63).

Treatment of osteoporosis in such cases is essentially the same as that for primary osteoporosis, but it is important to be aware of the interference between osteoporosis treatment and the drugs used for the lifestyle-related diseases. Raloxifene, bisphosphonates and activated vitamin D are commonly used for treatment of osteoporosis, and they are reported to have a positive effect on atherosclerosis. Beta-blocker use, particularly selective beta-blocker, is associated with reduced fracture risk. Statin is also reported to stimulate bone formation via bone morphogenetic protein-2 expression, but their clinical utility has not yet been confirmed.

    "166": "Proinflammatory cytokines produced by immune cells destroy pancreatic beta cells in type 1 diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate the cytokine network and its effects in insulin-secreting cells. INS1E cells were exposed to different combinations of proinflammatory cytokines. Cytokine toxicity was estimated by MTT assay and caspase activation measurements. The NF\u03baB-iNOS pathway was analyzed by a SEAP reporter gene assay, Western-blotting and nitrite measurements. Gene expression analyses of ER stress markers, Chop and Bip, were performed by real-time RT-PCR. Cytokines tested in this study, namely IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3, had deleterious effects on beta cell viability. The most potent toxicity exhibited IL-1\u03b2 and its combinations with other cytokines. The toxic effects of IL-1\u03b2 towards cell viability, caspase activation and iNOS activity were dependent on nitric oxide and abolished by an iNOS blocker. IL-1\u03b2 was the strongest inducer of the NF\u03baB activation. An iNOS blocker inhibited IL-1\u03b2-mediated NF\u03baB activation in the first, initial phase of cytokine action, but did not affect significantly NF\u03baB activation after prolonged incubation. Interestingly iNOS protein expression was induced predominantly by IL-1\u03b2 and decreased in the presence of an iNOS blocker in the case of a short time exposure. The changes in the expression of ER stress markers were also almost exclusively dependent on the IL-1\u03b2 presence and counteracted by iNOS blockade. Thus cytokine-induced beta cell death is primarily IL-1\u03b2 mediated with a NO-independent enhancement by TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3.

The magnitude of individual changes from baseline were greater in females than in males (34 \u00b1 8 vs 21 \u00b1 12 ms, P < .05). In each gender, QTc and serum sotalol concentration strongly correlated (r = .93, P < .001). An upward shift of the regression line in females indicates a longer QTc at any concentration level. Males had greater body weight and body surface area than females (P < .05) but neither correlated with QTc or predicted QTc prolongation. The univariate analysis indicated that the single predictor for the greater QTc prolongation was female gender.", 
    "178": "Females had greater QTc prolongation than males following sotalol administration. This enhanced response to drug action may explain the higher incidence of drug-induced TdP seen in females.", 
    "179": "Increasing evidence shows a marked beneficial effect with \u03b2-blockers in heart dysfunction via scavenging reactive oxygen species. Previously we showed that chronic treatment with either timolol or propranolol possessed similar beneficial effects for heart function in male rats as age increased, whereas only timolol exerted similar benefits in female rats. Therefore, in this study, we aimed first to examine the cellular bases for age-related alterations in excitation-contraction coupling in ventricular myocytes from female rats and, second, to investigate the hypothesis that age-related changes in [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis and receptor-mediated system can be prevented with chronic timolol treatment. Chronic timolol treatment of 3-month-old female rats abolished age-related decrease in left ventricular developed pressure and the attenuated responses to \u03b2-adrenoreceptor stimulation. It also normalized the altered parameters of [Ca(2+)](i) transients, decreased Ca(2+) loading of sarcoplasmic reticulum and increased basal [Ca(2+)](i), and decreased L-type Ca(2+) currents in 12-month-old female rats compared with the 3-month-old group. Adenylyl cyclase activity, \u03b2-adrenoreceptor affinity to its agonist, and \u03b2-adrenoreceptor density of the 12-month-old group are normalized to those of the 3-month-old group. Moreover, timolol treatment prevented dysfunction of the antioxidant system, including increased lipid peroxidation, decreased ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione, and decreased activities of thioredoxin reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, in the left ventricle of hearts from the 12-month-old group. Our data confirmed that aging-related early myocardial impairment is primarily related to a dysfunctional antioxidant system and impairment of Ca(2+) homeostasis, which can be prevented with chronic timolol treatment.",

IOP was controled at 3 months, and the visual field at 6 months during a 30-month follow-up period.", 
    "182": "In the first 24 months of follow-up there was no statistically significant difference in percentage of eyes with successfully regulated IOP. At 27th and 30th month, in the group primarily treated with medicaments a statistically significant higher percentage of successfully regulated IOP was observed in 98%, and 96% of the eyes, respectively, while in the group primarily treated with ALT the decline in the percentage of successfully regulated IOP was observed in 78% and 76% of the eyes, (chi2-test, p = 0.002, p = 0.140). Both therapy groups showed stability of perimetry findings without statistically significant difference in the values of mean deviation (MD) index until the end of the monitoring period. The dynamics of change in MD index value showed a statistically significant greater decline in this parameter in subjects who had been primarily treated with medications during the last six months of follow-up, (two-factor analysis of variance with a repeated measurement, factor of time x type of therapy, p = 0.030).",

    "184": "Curcumin has wound healing attributes mediated through a plethora of biological activities that in general are not ascribed to specific receptors. Recently, we have demonstrated that intravenous administration of curcumin limits burn injury progression in a rat model. As decreased microvascular perfusion is a central element of burn injury progression, we hypothesized that curcumin may induce vasodilation in peripheral arterioles, to improve perfusion. Using mucosal microcirculation as an in situ assay, cheek pouch tissue was exteriorized in anesthetized (phentobarbital 70\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) intraperitoneal) male hamsters (N=60) to observe the terminal feed arterioles (\u223c8\u2009\u03bcm diameter) and the immediately upstream arcade arterioles (\u223c20\u2009\u03bcm). Curcumin (10(-12)-10(-4)\u2009mol\u2009l(-1)) was applied dose-wise (micropipette, 60\u2009seconds). Subnanomolar curcumin dilated, whereas micromolar doses constricted, the arterioles. For the terminal arteriole: vasodilation logEC(50) -10.3\u00b10.2, peak dilation +39\u00b11%; vasconstriction logEC(50) -8.0\u00b10.4, peak constriction -14\u00b12%. Simultaneous atropine (muscarinic antagonist) or PD142893 (endothelin antagonist) had no effect. Propranolol (\u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-Ad) antagonist) enhanced constriction by removing the vasodilation response to curcumin. Phentolamine (\u03b1-adrenergic receptor (\u03b1-Ad) antagonist) enhanced dilation to curcumin by removing the vasoconstriction response. Thus, the curcumin vasomotor activity on microcirculation was \u03b1-Ad and \u03b2-Ad receptor-dependent and its net vasoactive effect was concentration- and time-dependent.", 
    "185": "The aim of this study was to examine the occurrence of endogenous oscillations of Per1, Per2, Bmal1 and Rev-erb\u03b1 genes in rat pineal explants and to investigate their regulation by adrenergic ligands. Our results show a significant and sustained rhythm of Per2,Bmal1 and Rev-erb\u03b1 gene expression for up to 48 h in cultured pineal gland with a pattern similar to that observed in vivo. By contrast, the rhythms of Per1 and Aa-nat, the rate-limiting enzyme for melatonin synthesis, were strongly attenuated after 24 h in culture. Addition of the exogenous adrenergic agonist isoproterenol on cultured pineal glands induced a short-term increase in mRNA levels of Per1 and Aa-nat, but not those of Per2,Bmal1 and Rev-erb\u03b1. This study demonstrates that the rat pineal gland hosts a circadian oscillator as evidenced by the sustained, noradrenergic-independent, endogenous oscillations of Per2, Bmal1 and Rev-erb\u03b1 mRNA levels in cultured tissues. Only expression of Per1 was stimulated by adrenergic ligands suggesting that, in vivo, the adrenergic input could synchronize the pineal clock by acting selectively on Per1.", 
    "186": "Psychosocial stress is associated with altered immune function and development of psychological disorders including anxiety and depression. Here we show that repeated social defeat in mice increased c-Fos staining in brain regions associated with fear and threat appraisal and promoted anxiety-like behavior in a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor-dependent manner. Repeated social defeat also significantly increased the number of CD11b(+)/CD45(high)/Ly6C(high) macrophages that trafficked to the brain. In addition, several inflammatory markers were increased on the surface of microglia (CD14, CD86, and TLR4) and macrophages (CD14 and CD86) after social defeat. Repeated social defeat also increased the presence of deramified microglia in the medial amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Moreover, mRNA analysis of microglia indicated that repeated social defeat increased levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and reduced levels of glucocorticoid responsive genes [glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) and FK506 binding protein-51 (FKBP51)]. The stress-dependent changes in microglia and macrophages were prevented by propranolol, a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Microglia isolated from socially defeated mice and cultured ex vivo produced markedly higher levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide compared with microglia from control mice. Last, repeated social defeat increased c-Fos activation in IL-1 receptor type-1-deficient mice, but did not promote anxiety-like behavior or microglia activation in the absence of functional IL-1 receptor type-1. These findings indicate that repeated social defeat-induced anxiety-like behavior and enhanced reactivity of microglia was dependent on activation of \u03b2-adrenergic and IL-1 receptors.", 
    "187": "Use of norepinephrine to increase blood pressure in septic animals has been associated with increased efficiency of hepatic mitochondrial respiration. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the same effect could be reproduced in isolated hepatic mitochondria after prolonged in vivo exposure to faecal peritonitis. Eighteen pigs were randomized to 27\u2009h of faecal peritonitis and to a control condition (n\u2009=\u20099 each group). At the end, hepatic mitochondria were isolated and incubated for one hour with either norepinephrine or placebo, with and without pretreatment with the specific receptor antagonists prazosin and yohimbine. Mitochondrial state 3 and state 4 respiration were measured for respiratory chain complexes I and II, and state 3 for complex IV using high-resolution respirometry, and respiratory control ratios were calculated. Additionally, skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration was evaluated after incubation with norepinephrine and dobutamine with and without the respective antagonists (atenolol, propranolol and phentolamine for dobutamine). Faecal peritonitis was characterized by decreasing blood pressure and stroke volume, and maintained systemic oxygen consumption. Neither faecal peritonitis nor any of the drugs or drug combinations had measurable effects on hepatic or skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration. Norepinephrine did not improve the efficiency of complex I- and complex II-dependent isolated hepatic mitochondrial respiration [respiratory control ratio (RCR) complex I: 5.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3 (placebo) vs. 5.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6 (norepinephrine) in controls and 2.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1 (placebo) vs. 2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 (norepinephrine) in septic animals; RCR complex II: 3.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0 (placebo) vs. 3.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 (norepinephrine) in controls; 2.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6 (placebo) vs. 2.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 (norepinephrine) in septic animals]. Prolonged faecal peritonitis did not affect either hepatic or skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration. Subsequent incubation of isolated mitochondria with norepinephrine and dobutamine did not significantly influence their respiration.",

Human liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (hL-FABP) expressed in human proximal tubules, but not rodents, participates in intracellular FFA metabolism and exerts anti-oxidative effects on the progression of tubulointerstitial damage. We examined whether tubular enhancement of this anti-oxidative action modulates the progression of glomerular damage in immune-mediated GN in hL-FABP chromosomal gene transgenic (Tg) mice.",

The mice were also treated with an angiotensin type II receptor blocker (ARB).", 
    "190": "The urinary protein level in Tg mice decreased significantly during the acute phase (~Day 5). Tg mice survived for a significantly longer time than WT mice, with an attenuation of tubulointerstitial damage score and expression of each tubulointerstitial damage marker observed at Day 7. Expression of inflammatory cytokines on Day 7 was higher in WT mice than Tg mice and correlated strongly with PPAR\u03b3 expression in WT mice, but not in Tg mice. Interestingly, Tg mice showed insufficient PMN influx at 3 and 6 h, with simultaneous elevation of urinary L-FABP and reduction in HNE expression. The two strains of mice showed different types of glomerular damage, with mild mesangial proliferation in Tg mice and severe endothelial swelling with vascular thrombosis in WT mice. The glomerular damage in Tg mice was improved by administration of an ARB.",

    "192": "Propranolol has become first-line therapy for the treatment of infantile hemangiomas in many centers. Of 302 children with hemangiomas seen at the University of North Carolina from 2008 through 2010, 15.6% were treated with oral propranolol alone, 5.6% with topical timolol (a propranolol derivative) alone, and 2.3% with both. The use of these agents increased over time from 7% of patients seen in 2008 to 54% of patients first seen in 2010. Starting doses of propranolol ranged from 0.25 to 1 mg/kg/d, with target doses of 1 to 4 mg/kg/d. Serious side effects, noted in 6/54 (10.9%) patients, included somnolence, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and mottling of extremities.The authors confirm the variation in use of propranolol for vascular lesions and extend experience with timolol. They suggest daily home monitoring of patients for the first 2 weeks of initiating or increasing doses. Frequent feeding of infants and young children on this drug is recommended.", 
    "193": "A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether prophylactic therapy with antioxidant vitamins reduces the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF). One hundred and fifty-four papers were found using the reported search, of which five were judged to represent the best evidence to answer the question. The authors, journal, date, country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results were tabulated. Four of the five studies found antioxidant vitamins to significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative AF. Two of the studies show that prophylactic treatment with adjuvant vitamin C and \u03b2-blockers is more effective than \u03b2-blocker therapy alone. The quality of these studies was assessed using a Jadad scoring system, which identified four of the studies to be of low and one to be of high methodological quality. We conclude that although preliminary evidence suggests that prophylactic antioxidant vitamins may be effective in reducing the incidence of postoperative AF, there is a lack of high-quality data. Additional large-scale, adequately powered clinical studies are warranted before antioxidant vitamins can be considered for routine use in this setting.", 
    "194": "Glaucoma is the second most common cause of world blindness (following cataract) with estimated cases reaching 79.6 million by 2020. Although the etiology of glaucoma is multi-factorial, intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only modifiable factor in glaucoma management proven to alter the natural course of the disease. Among various classes of IOP-lowering medications currently available, alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists are used either as monotherapy, as second-line therapy, or in fixed combination with beta-blockers. Non-selective adrenergic agonists such as epinephrine and dipivefrin are infrequently used today for the treatment of glaucoma or ocular hypertension, and have been replaced by the alpha-2-selective agonists. The use of apraclonidine for IOP reduction in glaucoma or OHT is limited due to a high rate of follicular conjunctivitis. The alpha-2-selective agonist in use today is brimonidine. The brimonidine-purite formulations are preferred to brimonidine-benzalkonium chloride (BAC) formulations due better tolerability while maintaining similar efficacy. Brimonidine is also effective when used in combination with a beta-blocker. Using brimonidine-timolol fixed combination (BTFC) as first-line therapy has an added potential for neuroprotection. This would be a valuable strategy for glaucoma treatment, for patients who are intolerant of prostaglandin analogs, or for patients where prostaglandin analogues are contraindicated as first-line therapy, such as in patients with inflammatory glaucoma."
