    "0": "Bronchial hyperreactivity is studied for the evaluation of airways' response to stimuli that provoke bronchoconstriction in hyperreactive subjects. Exercise is often used, especially in children. This method in simple, sufficiently tolerated and reproducible. The inhalation of ultrasonically-nebulized distilled water is a simple, reproducible and rapid to perform in the majority of adult patients test; in childhood it is poorly inquired. Pharmacological tests (with histamine or methacholine) have a greater sensitivity and reproducibility. Aspecific bronchoprovocation with methacholine is a diagnostic method that allows the diagnosis of bronchial hyperreactivity in asymptomatic subjects with asthma, recurrent cough and recurrent bronchopneumonia.", 
    "1": "Several haemostatic and metabolic variables were monitored during insulin stress tests (ISTs), which were preceded by placebo, nadolol or propranolol ingestion for 10 days. Nadolol administration blocked the rise in plasma factor VIII: RAg concentrations, but no significant changes were observed in platelet aggregation/thromboxane A2 release. Propranolol administration reduced the significance, but not the magnitude, of the plasma factor VIII:Rag rise and also marginally inhibited platelet aggregation/TXA2 release. Both nadolol and propranolol inhibited the hypokalaemia of hypoglycaemia and retarded the recovery of plasma glucose concentrations, probably by inhibiting lipolysis (as indicated by serum nonesterified fatty acid concentrations). Both nadolol and propranolol often masked and delayed the onset of the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. Beta-blockers may exert beneficial effects by modifying haemostatic variables and by preventing hypokalaemia during stressful situations, such as hypoglycaemia or myocardial infarction, both in diabetics and in non-diabetics. However, any benefit must be balanced against the risk of masking, and possibly increasing the incidence of, hypoglycaemia in diabetics.", 
    "2": "The importance of cardiovascular system involvement in hyperthyroidism has been recognized for many years. In the middle-aged and elderly patient, often with mild but prolonged elevation of plasma thyroid hormones, symptoms and signs of heart failure and complicating atrial fibrillation may dominate the clinical picture and mask the more classical endocrine manifestations of the disease. Pitfalls in diagnosis and the importance of early recognition and treatment are discussed. Despite experimental evidence for a short-term inotropic action of thyroid hormone excess, clinical data support the existence of a reversible cardiomyopathy in hyperthyroidism with impaired contractile reserve. Enhanced myocardial performance at rest primarily reflects the peripheral actions of thyroid hormone excess. Most, if not all, of the cardiac abnormalities return to normal once a euthyroid state has been achieved, although atrial fibrillation may persist in a minority. Optimum treatment requires rapid and definitive antithyroid therapy, usually using a large dose of radio-iodine, and rapid control of heart failure. Systemic anticoagulation is indicated in the presence of atrial fibrillation and should be continued until sinus rhythm has been present for at least three months, either spontaneously or after cardioversion.", 
    "3": "The antianginal efficacy of slow-release metoprolol (SRM) alone and associated to a transdermal therapeutic system containing nitroglycerin (TTS-TNG), was investigated in 10 patients with chronic, stable exertional angina and angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease, by means of a double blind, cross-over trial. Each patient performed a symptom-limited exercise test 4 and 24 hours after single blind placebo on day 1, and double blind SRM (200 mg) alone or SRM plus TTS-TNG, on days 3 and 5, in a randomized sequence. The protocol of Redwood was employed. Compared to the beta-blocker alone, the combined administration of SRM and TTS-TNG was associated to a significant increase in mean exercise duration 4 hours (528 +/- 180 vs 412 +/- 110 sec.; p less than 0.001) and 24 hours (432 +/- 115 vs 391 +/- 100 sec.; p less than 0.05) after drug administration. A significant increase in mean total work performance 4 hours (4626 +/- 1070 vs 3272 +/- 803 kgm; p less than 0.01) and 24 hours (3445 +/- 1045 vs 2941 +/- 773 kgm; p less than 0.01) after drug administration was observed as well. During placebo all the tests were stopped due to angina associated with ST depression greater than or equal to 1 mm. Conversely, the test was terminated due to fatigue by 8 patients at 4 hours and 5 patients at 24 hours after combined therapy, and respectively by 5 and 1 patient after SRM alone. No side effects were observed after the administration of SRM alone, whereas 5 patients complained of mild headache after SRM and TTS-TNG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "Several partial beta-agonists such as TA-064, prenalterol, ICI 89,963 and ICI 119,033 possess pronounced positive inotropic effects but induce only limited activation of myocardial adenylate cyclase; this results in low cyclic AMP levels. Partial agonists, as compared to isoproterenol, need high receptor occupancy for maximal physiological response, and demonstrate inadequate coupling between receptor and adenylate cyclase. However, the biochemical mechanisms which generate the final biological effects originating from cyclic AMP are tissue-specific, and for that reason, can maintain a pronounced positive inotropic action. Clinical data with TA-064 and prenalterol have established positive inotropic effects without significant changes in heart rate. Partial beta-agonists with diminished cyclic AMP may be less arrhythmogenic than full beta-agonists. The clinical importance of partial beta-1-agonists remains to be established, particularly with relevance to long-term exposure and inherent beta blockade.", 
    "5": "The effects of combining diltiazem, a calcium channel blocking agent, with beta adrenergic blockade were evaluated in 11 patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. All patients had stable angina pectoris and were receiving oral beta blocking therapy. Symptomatic, metabolic, coronary and systemic haemodynamic responses were monitored at rest and during atrial pacing. Following the administration of diltiazem, resting arterial blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance and heart rate fell significantly with no adverse effects on left ventricular function. During pacing diltiazem produced significant decreases in rate-pressure product and myocardial oxygen consumption. As a consequence there was a significant increase in mean pacing time to angina from 151 +/- 42 to 406 +/- 72 s (P less than 0.001). Concomitantly, myocardial lactate extraction was improved significantly from mean lactate production of -2 +/- 12% to mean lactate extraction of 12 +/- 7% (P less than 0.05). This study indicates that intravenous diltiazem can be administered to patients receiving chronic oral beta blockade without adverse haemodynamic effects and that combination therapy has significant beneficial effects in coronary artery disease.", 
    "6": "Some derivatives of 2-(3-amino-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenoxymethyl isoxazole possess beta- and alpha-adrenoblocking activity. 3-Methyl-4-chlor-5-(3-isopropylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenoxymethyl isoxazole hydrochloride (compound OF-4452) is the most active of the compounds studied. As to the beta-adrenoblocking activity, this compound given in vivo and in vitro compares very favourably with propranolol, oxprenolol and labetalol, in particular; as regards the alpha-adrenoblocking action, it is not inferior to the latter drug. Compound OF-4452 has a partial agonist activity and nonspecific membrane-stabilizing action. It displays antifibrillatory and antiarrhythmic activity as well.", 
    "7": "Zoapatle aqueous crude extract (ZACE) obtained from Montanoa tomentosa (M.t.) inhibits the in vitro spontaneous contractility pattern of rat uterine tissue. The opposite effect was observed with ZACE from Montanoa frutescens (M.f.) in the same preparation. Both plant extracts, M.t. and M.f., increased the in vitro spontaneous contractility pattern in the uterine guinea pig assay. In depolarized uterine tissue, propranolol (beta-blocker) inhibited the relaxing effect induced by M.t.. Atropine (cholinergic antagonist) abolished the increase in uterus contractility produced by the presence of M.f.", 
    "8": "The role of putative neurotransmitters of the central nervous system in the central gastric antisecretory effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was investigated in pylorus-ligated rats. Pretreatment of the rats with an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) prevented the antisecretory effect of the i.c.v. administration of PGE2, whereas pretreatment with 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine (5,6-DHT) plus p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) had no effect. I.c.v.-administered phentolamine and idazoxan antagonized the inhibition of gastric secretion induced by i.c.v. PGE2, whereas prazosin, propranolol and sulpiride injected via the same route were ineffective. Diphenhydramine, cimetidine, naloxone and theophylline, all administered i.c.v., did not modify the antisecretory effect of i.c.v. PGE2. The results suggest that an activation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the brain is involved in the central gastric antisecretory effect of PGE2, whereas neither central 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors, alpha 1- or beta-adrenoceptors, D2-dopamine receptors, histamine or opioid receptors nor adenosine seem to play any role here.", 
    "9": "The effect of xamoterol and (-)-isoprenaline have been compared for their activity at beta-adrenoceptor sites in a number of in vitro cardiac and smooth muscle preparations. Xamoterol produced weak positive chronotropic effects in guinea-pig, rat and cat atria (intrinsic activity less than 0.55, (-)-isoprenaline = 1). Positive inotropic effects were obtained in driven left atria of the cat but were absent in guinea-pig left atrial and right ventricular strip preparations. Agonistic effects were due to beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulation. Xamoterol was without beta-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibitory effects in guinea-pig ileal, tracheal and uterine preparations and in the rat vas deferens and oestrogen-primed uterus. Weak beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation was obtained in progesterone-primed rat uteri. Xamoterol produced non-specific inhibitory effects in guinea-pig ileal and tracheal preparations. Xamoterol acted as a competitive antagonist at beta 1-(pA2 range = 7.4 to 7.8) and beta 2-adrenoceptors (pA2 range 5.2 to 6.2) and displaced [125I]-iodocyanopindolol from guinea-pig left atrial (pKD = 7.25) and uterine (pKD 5.24) membrane preparations. It is concluded that xamoterol displays a selective affinity for beta 1-adrenoceptors. Although its partial agonistic actions are more evident at beta 1-adrenoceptor sites, like prenalterol, xamoterol displays a degree of tissue rather than receptor-dependent selectivity.", 
    "10": "In previous studies racemic bucindolol was found to reverse the effects of pentobarbital-induced heart failure in anesthetized dogs. Reductions of right ventricular contractile force (RVCF), left ventricular (LV) dp/dt, and aortic blood flow (ABF) serve as indicators of depressed cardiac function in this model. In this study, racemic bucindolol (0.25 mumol/kg +0.25 mumol/kg/hr) again evoked pronounced and sustained stimulant effects on these depressed parameters. l-Bucindolol (0.125 mumol/kg +0.125 mumol/kg/hr) was a more effective stimulator of cardiac function than d-bucindolol in this model. l-Bucindolol elicited maximal increases in RVCF, ABF, LV dp/dt and heart rate of 66, 19, 30 and 11%, respectively. In comparison, d-bucindolol maximally increased these parameters only 20, 14, 12 and 4%, respectively. Total peripheral resistance was reduced 29% by l-bucindolol and 19% by d-bucindolol. The responses to l-bucindolol and racemic bucindolol were essentially the same. The myocardial stimulation and vasodilation profile derived from l-bucindolol (at one-half the molar dose of bucindolol) suggests the possible preference for its use in clinical management of congestive heart failure over bucindolol, the racemic compound. The results further suggest that l-bucindolol could also be used to treat hypertensive patients with depressed cardiac function.", 
    "11": "The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of somatostatin on gastric acid secretion and gastric antral motility in conscious dogs with gastric fistula. Infusion of bethanechol stimulated dose-dependently acid secretion, whereas the frequency and strength of antral motility was maintained at a high level. Somatostatin inhibited dose-dependently the stimulated acid secretion, whereas the effect on antral motility was more complex, acting especially on the amplitude of the contractions. The effects of somatostatin were not altered by using alpha-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic blocking drugs. The dose-response kinetics with four doses of bethanechol with and without somatostatin showed inhibition of a non-competitive type for gastric acid secretion and of a competitive type for antral motility with regard to amplitude.", 
    "12": "Pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs were pretreated centrally with either metoprolol, a selective beta1 antagonist, or ICI 118,551, a selective beta2 antagonist, prior to a continuous digoxin infusion (2.5 micrograms/kg/min, i.v.). Both agents produced depressant effects on hemodynamic parameters upon central administration. Metoprolol (1, 3 and 5 mg, i.c.v.) significantly increased the lethal dose of digoxin in a non-dose dependent manner, but these protective effects were not evident upon peripheral administration of the drug (5 mg). This protective effect was not due to local anesthetic properties of metoprolol since pretreatment with lidocaine did not alter the toxicity of digoxin. Central beta2 blockade by ICI 118,551 did not alter the doses of digoxin to ventricular arrhythmias or death. These results suggest that beta receptors are not directly involved in the cardiotoxic actions of digoxin. Metoprolol's effects may be attributed to non-specific central depressant activity.", 
    "13": "In unanesthetized and unrestrained rats, microinjection of L-glutamate into the posterior hypothalamus produced hypertension and tachycardia. These cardiovascular responses were mostly accompanied with behavioral excitation such as searching the cage, rearing and sniffing. The cardiovascular responses elicited by L-glutamate were attenuated by prior injection with propranolol and hexamethonium but not with glutamate diethylester, phentolamine and atropine. The behavioral responses to L-glutamate were suppressed by propranolol, hexamethonium and phentolamine. These results suggest that catecholaminergic and/or cholinergic systems in the posterior hypothalamus may be involved in the mediation of the cardiovascular and behavioral responses induced by L-glutamate.", 
    "14": "The autonomic and antihypertensive activities of amosulalol (YM-09538) were studied in conscious rats. Single oral administration of amosulalol antagonized the phenylephrine-induced pressor and isoproterenol-induced positive chronotropic responses with DR10 values of 11.5 and 13.6 mg/kg in pithed rats, respectively, indicating that the compound inhibits both alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenoceptors to almost the same extent in agreement with previously reported results in vitro. Amosulalol was approximately 50 times less potent than prazosin and 12 times more potent than labetalol at alpha 1-adrenoceptors, and it was approximately as effective as labetalol and 2 times more potent than propranolol at beta 1-adrenoceptors. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), renal hypertensive rats and DOCA/salt hypertensive rats, a single oral administration of amosulalol (3-30 mg/kg) lowered acutely systolic blood pressure with a duration of over 6 hr and was found to be approximately 50 times less potent than prazosin and 3 times more potent than labetalol in lowering blood pressure. Propranolol did not cause such an immediate hypotensive effect. Amosulalol and labetalol did not increase heart rate, whereas prazosin induced a tachycardia in the hypertensive rats. Repeated oral administrations of amosulalol and labetalol (50 mg/kg/day, b.i.d., for 12 weeks) produced not only an antihypertensive effect without evidence of tolerance, but also reductions in plasma renin activity (PRA) and heart rate in SHR with established hypertension. We conclude that alpha-adrenoceptor blockade by amosulalol might account for its antihypertensive activity and that its beta-adrenoceptor blockade might inhibit reflexogenic increases in heart rate and PRA due to the reduction in blood pressure.", 
    "15": "The pharmacological properties of beta-adrenoceptors in rat ascites hepatoma cells were compared with those in normal rat liver cells which were cultured for 24 hr after collagenase digestion. Adenylate cyclases in the homogenates of cultured normal rat liver cells and rat ascites hepatoma cells, AH44, AH66, AH109A, AH130 and AH7974, were all activated by isoproterenol or NaF to different degrees. The enzyme in rat liver cells was activated by several beta 2-agonists but those in all hepatoma cells hardly responded. Furthermore, salbutamol, a beta 2-partial agonist, antagonized the cyclase activation by isoproterenol in AH130 cells. The Kact value of isoproterenol for the activation of adenylate cyclase in AH130 cells was smaller than that in rat liver cells. A comparison of the Ki values of beta-antagonists for the inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated cyclase activity shows that while the Ki values of propranolol and butoxamine in AH130 cells were similar to those in rat liver cells, a significant difference was observed in the values for beta 1-selective antagonists between AH130 cells and rat liver cells. The Ki values of metoprolol and atenolol for AH130 cells were 137- and 90-fold lower, respectively, than for normal rat liver cells. From these findings, it is strongly suggested that beta-adrenoceptors in rat ascites hepatoma cells including AH130 cells have similar properties to the mammalian beta 1-receptor.", 
    "16": "The effect of sympathetic nervous activity on rectal motility induced by pelvic nerve stimulation (PNS) was studied in anaesthetized cats. Division of the sympathetic lumbar colonic and hypogastric nerves or alpha-adrenoreceptor blockade, both of which reduced rectal tone, also reversed a predominantly relaxatory pelvic nerve response into a pure contraction. Contractions to pelvic nerve stimulation were reduced by simultaneous lumbar colonic nerve stimulation. This lumbar colonic nerve-induced inhibition was augmented by alpha-adrenoceptor blockade and abolished by beta-blockade. Close intra-arterial injection of a beta-adrenergic agonist reduced contractions to PNS, while an alpha-adrenergic agonist had no effect. Stimulation of the hypogastric nerves enhanced rectal contractions to simultaneous PNS. The apparent similarity with the arrangement of extrinsic nervous control of the internal anal sphincter suggests that the rectum is functionally involved in continence mechanisms.", 
    "17": "The haemodynamic effects of enflurane (1.7% and 3.4% expiratory concentrations) were investigated in sheep (n = 6) pretreated with an infusion of metoprolol (0.2 mg X kg-1 X h-1 for 5 days) and in control animals (n = 6). Chloralose was used as basal anaesthetic. A 90 s apnoea period was included in the experiment to evaluate further the possible side-effects of long-term metoprolol treatment in combination with enflurane anaesthesia. MAC 1.0 for enflurane in the sheep was found at 1.45% end-tidal concentration by separate measurements. Before enflurane administration, the only significant differences between the two groups of animals were a lower systemic vascular resistance and a higher stroke volume during metoprolol treatment. Enflurane abolished these discrepancies in a dose-dependent fashion and similar cardiovascular depression was observed in both groups of animals at 3.4% expiratory concentration of enflurane. Metoprolol did not significantly affect the hypertensive response to apnoea during chloralose anaesthesia alone. At enflurane 1.7% expiratory concentration the apnoea response was small and only the metoprolol-treated animals showed a significant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. We conclude that 5 days of pretreatment with metoprolol in the sheep model does not significantly impair cardiovascular performance during enflurane anaesthesia.", 
    "18": "Urinary epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been demonstrated recently to originate from the kidneys. The present study was undertaken to investigate the adrenergic and cholinergic influence on secretion of renal EGF. beta-Adrenergic agonists increased the level of urinary EGF, while propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, decreased basal and beta-adrenergic stimulated total output of urinary EGF. Acetylcholine and the anticholinergic agent atropine had no effect on the output of EGF in urine. Also chemical sympathectomy induced by 6-hydroxydopamine reduced the urinary output of EGF. None of the experimental groups had a median serum concentration above the detection limit of the assay. The present study shows that secretion of renal EGF is under the influence of the sympathetic nervous system and release of EGF is stimulated by activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the kidneys.", 
    "19": "ICI 118,551, 5 to 80 mg orally, did not significantly alter resting heart rate or blood pressure. In doses less than 40 mg the reduction in exercise tachycardia was under 10 beats/min. ICI 118,551, 10 to 40 mg, did not appear to reduce the maximum rise in systolic pressure with isoprenaline but did attenuate the changes in diastolic pressure, forearm blood flow and finger tremor. It also attenuated the isoprenaline-induced changes in serum glucose, insulin and potassium. On these observed changes, the effect of ICI 118,551 20 mg was similar to that of 40 mg and of propranolol 10 mg, but greater than that of atenolol 25 mg. An isoprenaline tachycardia was attenuated by all doses of ICI 118,551 studied. After atropine (0.04 mg/kg) ICI 118,551 20 mg still significantly reduced the effects of isoprenaline suggesting that functional beta 2-adrenoceptors may be present in the human heart. In doses less than 40 mg, ICI 118,551 appears to be a selective and competitive antagonist of beta 2-adrenoceptors in man.", 
    "20": "To account for a 40% lowering of the systemic clearance of lignocaine by propranolol treatment it has been proposed that propranolol reduces liver blood flow by 25% and causes a 50% decrease in the intrinsic clearance of lignocaine by enzyme inhibition. In theory, the contribution of direct enzyme inhibition is best evaluated using oral administration of lignocaine when models of hepatic drug clearance predict that propranolol could increase the AUCpo of lignocaine by 100-140%. This hypothesis was tested in six healthy men who received 200 mg lignocaine HCl X H2O orally with and without propranolol pre-treatment (80 mg twice daily for 3 days). Propranolol treatment increased the mean plasma AUCpo of lignocaine by 113 +/- 58 s.d.% (P less than 0.005); it increased the peak plasma lignocaine concentration by 79 +/- 50 s.d.% (P less than 0.025) and it prolonged the elimination half-life of lignocaine by 20 +/- 13 s.d.% (P less than 0.05). Propranolol treatment lowered indocyanine green clearance by 11 +/- 15 s.d.%, but this change was not significant statistically. These experimental results are in accord with the theoretical predictions suggesting that propranolol lowers the systemic clearance of lignocaine mainly by direct inhibition of its metabolism rather than by a lowering of the hepatic blood flow.", 
    "21": "beta-adrenergic receptors were measured in cerebral microvessels of gerbils and rats after ligature of the right or left common carotid artery. The results indicate a decrease in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in brain microvessels of both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. This event may reflect altered patterns of the neuronal regulation of brain microvasculature and may be related to cerebrovascular alterations which are concomitant with ischemia. Furthermore, the results show that the decrease in beta-receptor density is more pronounced in the left hemisphere, independently on the side of carotid occlusion. This finding suggests that microvessel function in the left side of the brain is more vulnerable to hypoxia effects.", 
    "22": "Beta-adrenoceptor blockade (beta-blocker) has recently been introduced for use in treating hypertension of pregnancy. The aim of this investigation is to determine the effects of beta-blocker (alprenolol and labetalol) on parturition and on the fetal cardiovascular and metabolic system in normotensive pregnant rats. The continuous administration of alprenolol to pregnant Wistar rats revealed the following: a small placenta intrauterine growth retardation delayed parturition intrauterine death (21.8%) morbidity (30.3%) and, hypoglycemia of neonates. In the cases which received the administration of both labetalol and alprenolol, the growth of fetuses was retarded. However, there was twice as much growth retardation of the fetuses treated with alprenolol. No other abnormalities were observed. The administration of alprenolol in pregnant rat uteri (in vitro) resulted in stimulation of myometrial contractility (oxytocic reaction) and lowered the c-AMP levels in the bath medium. However, when labetalol was administered, uterine activity was reduced in a dose-dependent manner (tocolytic reaction) with a concurrent rise in c-AMP levels in the bath medium. The effect of alprenolol on rat uterine blood flow using the thermocouple method resulted in a decrease of 18-30 percent but with labetalol there was only a slight decrease (0-5%).", 
    "23": "To assess the role of hepatic autoregulation in defense against hypoglycemia, we compared the effects of complete blockade of glucose counterregulation with those of blockade of only neurohumoral counterregulation during moderate (approximately 50 mg/dl) and severe (approximately 30 mg/dl) hypoglycemia induced by physiologic hyperinsulinemia during subcutaneous infusion of insulin in normal volunteers. Compared with observations in control experiments, neurohumoral counterregulatory blockade (somatostatin, propranolol, phentolamine, and metyrapone), during which identical moderate hypoglycemia was achieved using the glucose clamp technique, resulted in suppressed glucose production (0.62 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.56 +/- 0.07 mg/kg per min at 12 h, P less than 0.01) and augmented glucose utilization (2.17 +/- 0.18 vs. 1.57 +/- 0.07 mg/kg per min at 12 h, P less than 0.01). Complete blockade of counterregulation (neurohumoral blockade plus prevention of hypoglycemia) did not further enhance the suppressive effects of insulin on glucose production. However, when severe hypoglycemia was induced during neurohumoral counterregulatory blockade, glucose production was nearly two times greater (1.05 +/- 0.05 mg/kg per min at 9 h) than that observed during complete counterregulatory blockade (0.58 +/- 0.08 mg/kg per min at 9 h, P less than 0.01) and that observed during mere neurohumoral blockade with moderate hypoglycemia (0.59 +/- 0.06 mg/kg per min at 9 h, P less than 0.01). These results demonstrate that glucose counterregulation involves both neurohumoral and hepatic autoregulatory components: neurohumoral factors, which require only moderate hypoglycemia for their activation, augment glucose production and reduce glucose utilization; hepatic autoregulation requires severe hypoglycemia for its activation and may thus serve as an emergency system to protect the brain when other counterregulatory factors fail to prevent threatening hypoglycemia.", 
    "24": "To assess the direct and indirect effects of the commonly used calcium entry blockers (CEB) upon the major determinants of isovolumic left ventricular relaxation, we administered equidepressant intracoronary (IC, n = 7) and equihypotensive intravenous (n = 12) dosages of diltiazem (16 +/- 3 SE micrograms/kg IC and 63 +/- 9 micrograms/kg i.v.), verapamil (10 +/- 2 and 57 +/- 5 micrograms/kg), and nifedipine (1 +/- 0.1 and 8 +/- 0.3 micrograms/kg) to preinstrumented awake dogs with normal ventricular function. The time constant of left ventricle (LV) relaxation, analyzed by two methods (T1, from the linear relation of the natural logarithm of LV pressure and time; T2, from the linear relation of LV pressure and negative high fidelity LV pressure), was significantly and equivalently prolonged by IC diltiazem (T1 + 48%, P less than 0.02), verapamil (T1 + 43%, P less than 0.001), and nifedipine (T1 + 30%, P less than 0.03). Lesser amounts of each CEB that did not affect rate of LV pressure development or extent of shortening produced no change in T1 or T2. By contrast, intravenous calcium entry blockade either produced no significant change (diltiazem and verapamil) or shortened (nifedipine T1 - 18%, P less than 0.01) LV isovolumic relaxation. However, after beta adrenergic blockade with propranolol (2 mg/kg i.v., n = 6) no change in ventricular relaxation was observed during nifedipine and the time constant was significantly prolonged by verapamil (T1 + 15%, P less than 0.05). We conclude that calcium entry blockade directly impairs normal left ventricular relaxation: This effect is closely linked to the negative inotropic properties of these drugs. The prolongation of isovolumic relaxation produced by calcium blockade is attenuated or even reversed by reflex sympathetic stimulation and favorably altered loading conditions during systemic administration.", 
    "25": "The effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (d,l-propranolol or timolol, 30 micrograms in 2 microL of isotonic saline) on the increased renal sympathetic nerve activity and decreased urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) responses to stressful environmental stimulation (air jet to head) in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were examined. Before i.c.v. d,l-propranolol or timolol, air stress increased renal activity (68% from 10.6 +/- 2.1 and 63% from 8.2 +/- 0.9 integrator resets/min respectively). In contrast, after i.c.v. d,l-propranolol or timolol in the same conscious SHR, air stress had no effect on renal sympathetic nerve activity (+7% from 8.1 +/- 1.7 and +7% from 5.5 +/- 1.0 integrator resets/min respectively). Air stress decreased UNaV in conscious SHR given i.c.v. saline vehicle (25% from 2.8 +/- 0.5 microEq/min/100 g body weight), but had no effect on effective renal plasma flow or glomerular filtration rate. In contrast, after i.c.v. d,l-propranolol or timolol, air stress had no effect on UNaV (0% from 2.8 +/- 0.5 and +9% from 3.3 +/- 0.3 microEq/min/100 g body weight respectively). Mean arterial pressure increased similarly during air stress with i.c.v. saline-vehicle or beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists. Intravenous administration of the same doses of d,l-propranolol or timolol did not prevent the increased renal sympathetic nerve activity or decreased UNaV responses resulting from air stress. These results suggest that central nervous system beta-adrenergic receptors mediate the increased renal sympathetic nerve activity and decreased UNaV responses resulting from stressful environmental stimulation in conscious SHR.", 
    "26": "The effects of oral nifedipine on left ventricular (LV) diastolic function were assessed in 14 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who had symptoms despite therapy with beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs and nitrates. Rest and exercise gated radionuclide ventriculography was performed before and a mean of 13 days after the addition of oral nifedipine (80 to 120 mg/day) to baseline medication. Ejection fraction did not increase in any patient during exercise. The addition of nifedipine slightly improved the LV ejection fraction response to exercise (control, 49 +/- 8% rest vs 44 +/- 9% exercise; nifedipine, 47 +/- 6% vs 48 +/- 8%). With nifedipine treatment, diastolic function improved, with a decrease in the time to peak filling rate (PFR) at rest (from 174 +/- 34 to 152 +/- 31 ms, p less than 0.005) and an increase in PFR with exercise (from 2.5 +/- 0.6 to 3.4 +/- 0.7 end-diastolic volume/s, p less than 0.0005). Using the ratio of PFR/peak ejection rate as a variable, preferential improvement of diastolic over systolic function occurred during exercise (1.03 +/- 0.29 baseline vs 1.4 +/- 0.43 with nifedipine, p less than 0.01). Duration of exercise increased by a mean of 21% with nifedipine (from 454 +/- 150 to 550 +/- 159 seconds, p less than 0.005); all 14 patients were limited by angina pectoris at baseline, whereas only 5 patients were limited by angina pectoris after nifedipine treatment. This study shows that global LV diastolic function is improved by oral nifedipine treatment both at rest and during exercise in patients on maximally tolerated doses of beta-adrenoreceptor blockers and nitrates, and is associated with improvement of symptoms and exercise tolerances.", 
    "27": "During 10 years of clinical use involving almost 3 million patient-years, acebutolol has become established as a remarkably safe and well-tolerated beta-blocking agent, effective in treating essential hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias. The existence of a long-lived active metabolite (diacetolol) confers a 24-hour duration of action, which permits effective use of a once-daily regimen, particularly for hypertension. Acebutolol has low lipid solubility and low protein binding; the former property reduces the risk of central side effects, and the latter means that displacement interactions with other drugs are unlikely. Because acebutolol and its metabolite normally have both renal and hepatic excretion pathways, an alternative pathway is available should either be compromised through disease. Acebutolol is cardioselective, and clinical use has borne out the low incidence of bronchospasm in patients with impaired lung function. The possession of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) leads to only modest reductions in cardiac output, which in turn reduces the chance of excessive bradycardia and the likelihood of precipitating heart failure. A combination of selectivity and ISA may be responsible for the low incidence of tiredness and cold extremities observed with acebutolol compared with other beta blockers. The unique pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic profile of acebutolol confers several therapeutic advantages and may be responsible for the generally low level of side effects experienced in clinical use.", 
    "28": "Several drugs used for antihypertensive therapy may interact with lipoprotein metabolism and increase associated coronary risk factors. Beta-blocker monotherapy with cardioselective or noncardioselective beta blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) usually increases serum triglyceride and decreases the concentration of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), especially HDL2 cholesterol. With the exception of the noncardioselective beta blocker sotalol, beta-blocker therapy has little influence on the serum total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations. The magnitude of these changes in serum lipids does not significantly differ between cardioselective and noncardioselective beta blockers. Two beta blockers possessing ISA, acebutolol and pindolol, did not increase serum triglycerides and serum total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol. Acebutolol produced a nonsignificant decrease in HDL cholesterol level. Pindolol, with marked ISA, exhibited the most favorable lipid profile, increasing serum HDL cholesterol and the ratio of HDL cholesterol to total cholesterol. The concentration of apolipoprotein A-I increased slightly during pindolol therapy. Beta blockers, with the exception of pindolol, decrease the concentration of serum free fatty acids. Beta-blocker therapy has little influence on the adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity, but lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activity may increase during pindolol therapy. Thus beta-blocking drugs possessing ISA, such as acebutolol and pindolol, might be desirable choices as antihypertensive agents, since they do not appear to produce adverse effects on the lipid profile.", 
    "29": "Data from three multicenter controlled clinical trials of acebutolol carried out in the United States were reviewed to determine the efficacy and safety of acebutolol in patients greater than or equal to 65 years and in black patients. In 54 elderly patients, acebutolol decreased diastolic blood pressure by 12.8 mm Hg, and 86.5% were classified as responders. Acebutolol was superior to placebo, propranolol, and hydrochlorothiazide in terms of response rate. In 56 black patients, acebutolol decreased diastolic blood pressure by 8.5 mm Hg, and 53% were classified as responders. Acebutolol was superior to placebo and propranolol but not as effective as hydrochlorothiazide in terms of response rate. Acebutolol was well tolerated in both patient populations.", 
    "30": "A comparison of once-daily and twice-daily regimens of treatments with a beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent, acebutolol, was carried out in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Following an initial placebo phase, all patients entered an open 9-week period during which the dose of acebutolol, given on a twice-daily basis to all patients, was titrated to reduce seated diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg or to decrease it by at least 10 mm Hg. After a further 4-week maintenance period, patients whose blood pressure had been successfully controlled entered a 3-month double-blind study in which they were randomly divided into three groups: those receiving continuation of twice-daily treatment (n = 47); those receiving once-daily treatment (using the same total daily dose as in the earlier twice-daily phase (n = 97); and those receiving placebo twice daily (n = 48). By the end of the study, 78% of the once-daily treatment group were still under control, a result similar to that of 72% in the twice-daily treatment group. In contrast, only 39% of the placebo patients remained under control. Moreover, the blood pressure in this group was significantly higher than in the other two groups. Acebutolol is an efficacious antihypertensive agent when used on a once-daily basis.", 
    "31": "In a multicenter, double-blind comparison of acebutolol and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure, 95 to 114 mm Hg) in 182 and 178 patients, respectively, each agent reduced systolic and diastolic pressures to a similar significant degree: acebutolol, 15.9 and 14.9 mm Hg; hydrochlorothiazide, 15.2 and 13.3 mm Hg (p less than 0.001 vs baseline). Acebutolol significantly reduced heart rate by 8.9 bpm at the end of dose titration (p = 0.001), with no further decrease seen during maintenance. Fourteen patients on each treatment regimen were discontinued from the study because of side effects. However, significantly more hydrochlorothiazide patients experienced side effects of arrhythmia, anorexia, and flatulence; in addition, more hydrochlorothiazide patients developed abnormal levels of serum glucose, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, serum potassium, and chloride. In a single-center study of patients who remained hypertensive while receiving diuretics, six of nine patients receiving acebutolol concomitantly with a diuretic responded (seated diastolic blood pressure reduced below 90 mm Hg), whereas no patients receiving placebo and diuretic concomitantly responded (p less than 0.01). Patients taking both acebutolol and diuretic had significant reductions in diastolic blood pressure (11 mm Hg) and heart rate (16 bpm) compared with those taking diuretic alone (p less than 0.05, less than 0.01) and those taking both placebo and diuretic (p less than 0.05). No significant side effects were noted. Acebutolol is as effective as hydrochlorothiazide as monotherapy for mild to moderate essential hypertension and, in addition, is effective when added to a diuretic in patients who remain hypertensive while taking diuretics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "Two double-blind multicenter studies compared acebutolol with placebo (acebutolol, N = 121; placebo, N = 116) and with propranolol (acebutolol, N = 186; propranolol, N = 190) in essential hypertension. Acebutolol significantly reduced mean sitting diastolic blood pressure from 99.2 +/- 0.3 mm Hg at baseline to 89.1 +/- 0.9 mm Hg at the end of dose titration (p = 0.001). Significantly more acebutolol patients (65%) achieved therapeutic goal than did placebo patients (28%, p less than 0.01). The reduction in heart rate in acebutolol-treated patients (9.2 bpm) was greater than in placebo-treated patients (1.2 bpm, p = 0.001). The incidence of side effects and the number of patients discontinued because of side effects did not significantly differ between acebutolol and placebo. Acebutolol and propranolol produced comparable reductions in diastolic, systolic, and mean arterial blood pressures (p less than 0.001). At equipotent doses the 13% decrease in heart rate in patients receiving acebutolol was significantly less than the 17% decrease in propranolol patients (p = 0.02). The number of patients experiencing central nervous system (CNS) side effects while receiving acebutolol (N = 50) was significantly less than with propranolol (N = 75, p = 0.001), and significantly fewer acebutolol patients (N = 11) were discontinued because of side effects compared with propranolol patients (N = 29, p less than 0.01). Laboratory, ECG, or chest X-ray results did not differ for acebutolol, placebo, or propranolol. Acebutolol appears to be safe and effective in the management of mild to moderately severe essential hypertension and is better tolerated than propranolol in terms of CNS side effects, with a significantly lesser effect on heart rate.", 
    "33": "The effect of acebutolol on left ventricular performance was examined by various noninvasive means in three studies. M-mode echocardiographic measurements were made in 21 patients with coronary artery disease who were receiving placebo, acebutolol, and propranolol in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study. In these patients with normal or near-normal resting left ventricular function, neither drug induced depression of left ventricular function. In 26 patients with chronic angina pectoris receiving acebutolol under double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions, gated (equilibrium) myocardial blood pool imaging using red blood cells labeled with technetium 99m showed acebutolol to have no clinically significant negative effect on left ventricular performance at rest or during supine bicycle exercise. Acebutolol at effective antianginal doses modestly improved resting global and regional myocardial function. In 13 patients with stable angina pectoris, single-pass studies of left ventricular function with indium 113 under double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions similarly showed acebutolol to have no clinically significant negative inotropic effects. In conclusion, acebutolol is safe for use in patients with coronary disease and a wide range of ejection fractions but, as with all beta blockers, should be used cautiously in patients with markedly reduced resting left ventricular function.", 
    "34": "The hemodynamic effects of acebutolol were studied in six patients with ischemic heart disease. The changes in heart rate, cardiac output, and arterial blood pressure were determined after intravenous administration of six increasing doses of acebutolol to a cumulative dose of 0.64 mg/kg. After the sixth dose of acebutolol, cardiac output and heart rate were reduced 15% and 8%, respectively. Pulmonary artery pressure was increased by 4 mm Hg. Arterial blood pressure was not changed significantly. The effects of graded doses of acebutolol on heart rate and cardiac output were compared with earlier obtained results after atenolol (0.19 mg/kg), pindolol (0.025 mg/kg), practolol (0.64 mg/kg), and propranolol (0.19 mg/kg). The effects of increasing doses of acebutolol and practolol were very similar and significantly different from the effects of the other three drugs in spite having been administered at equipotent doses. The hemodynamic effects of acebutolol support the hypothesis that the hemodynamic response to beta-adrenoceptor antagonist drugs at rest is determined primarily by the degree of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, whereas beta-1 selectivity does not modify the central hemodynamic response.", 
    "35": "Acebutolol, a new beta-blocking agent, possesses the ancillary pharmacologic properties of cardioselectivity and partial agonist and membrane-stabilizing activities. Compared to propranolol at equipotent doses, acebutolol produces less bronchoconstriction and preserves the bronchodilator response to isoprenaline. Similarly, acebutolol has less of an effect on peripheral vascular hemodynamics than does propranolol. Because of partial agonist activity, acebutolol produces a lesser reduction in heart rate and cardiac output than do propranolol and atenolol and has been found to have minimal effects on lipoprotein metabolism. Acebutolol may be the only beta-blocking agent that demonstrates some membrane-stabilizing activity at clinically achievable plasma concentrations. The ancillary pharmacologic properties of cardioselectivity and partial agonist activity are distinct and offer definite advantages to selected patients, particularly patients with respiratory disease, in whom cardioselective acebutolol, particularly at low doses, can minimize patient risk. The ancillary property of membrane-stabilizing activity may also guide therapy in selected patients.", 
    "36": "The clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of acebutolol are summarized. Acebutolol and its longer-acting metabolite, diacetolol, are rapidly absorbed into the circulation from the gastrointestinal tract, and their bioavailability, unlike that of propranolol and metoprolol, is not significantly altered by whether the patient has recently eaten. Acebutolol is extensively metabolized by the liver, and elimination pathways involve approximately 30% to 40% through renal excretion and 50% to 60% by nonrenal mechanisms, including the bile and direct passage through the intestinal wall. The decreased hepatic metabolism and renal clearance rates seen in elderly patients may lead to the accumulation of both acebutolol and its metabolite, as has been reported with propranolol. In studies conducted to ascertain acebutolol's possible effect on common concurrently administered medications, the drug did not significantly alter either serum digoxin levels or serum insulin levels in diabetic patients treated with tolbutamide, nor did it change prothrombin time in patients treated with sodium warfarin.", 
    "37": "The beta-blocking potency of three doses of acebutolol (100, 200, and 600 mg three times a day) has been compared to that of propranolol (30, 60, and 180 mg three times a day) in a double-blind crossover study in 10 healthy volunteers (seven men, three women). On the basis of reduction in resting and exercise heart rates, propranolol was three to four times more potent than acebutolol on a milligram-for-milligram basis. Plasma levels showed large interindividual variation for both agents. Plasma levels were weakly correlated with the degree of beta blockade for both acebutolol (r = 0.333, p less than 0.001) and propranolol (r = 0.381, p less than 0.01). Dose and percent beta blockade were more strongly correlated (propranolol, r = 0.503, p less than 0.001; acebutolol, r = 0.574, p less than 0.001). In 11 patients (10 men, one woman) with coronary artery disease, acebutolol at 1 mg/kg infused over 15 minutes decreased heart rate and slowed conduction, increased the refractoriness of the atrioventricular node without a significant change in the atrial refractoriness, and at plasma levels greater than or equal to 1000 ng/ml slowed His-Purkinje conduction. The comparative potency data suggest that the magnitude of the decrease in the resting and exercise-induced changes in heart rate and double product, in relation to dose of acebutolol, provides quantitative indices for judging adequacy by beta blockade in clinical therapeutics. The use of plasma drug levels, however, does not appear to be helpful in judging the adequacy of beta blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "Studies in various animal models have shown acebutolol to be a relatively cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent possessing both partial agonist and membrane-stabilizing activities. The latter property may not be significant at clinically used doses. Acebutolol has both antihypertensive and antiarrhythmic effects. As with beta blockers in general, the antihypertensive mechanism of acebutolol is not known. The antiarrhythmic activity of acebutolol may be related to beta blockade. Acebutolol is relatively hydrophilic and does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, a fact that may be clinically significant in reducing the frequency and severity of central nervous system adverse effects. The pharmacologic profile of diacetolol, acebutolol's major metabolite, is similar to that of the parent compound in beta-blocking potency, cardioselectivity, and partial agonist activity. Diacetolol, however, does not possess membrane-stabilizing activity.", 
    "39": "To determine if intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) is associated with a hemodynamic advantage over non-ISA beta blockade, 17 patients with ischemic heart disease underwent resting echocardiography and symptom-limited stress radionuclide angiography on three occasions: control, pindolol (with ISA), 10 mg twice a day, and propranolol, 40 mg four times a day, in a nonrandomized design. In six patients with normal resting ejection fraction (EF) (mean = 57 +/- 4%), neither drug was associated with a significant hemodynamic improvement over control. In 11 patients with reduced resting EF (mean = 37 +/- 9%), pindolol was associated with a higher EF and peak velocity of circumferential fiber shortening at rest compared with propranolol but not control. On maximal exertion, pindolol was associated with a higher EF than that during control but was similar to propranolol. These observed beneficial effects on pindolol appear primarily to be related to the partial beta agonist activity which this agent possesses.", 
    "40": "Over the past decade we have witnessed a metamorphosis in the treatment of hypertension. First, nonpharmacological modalities are employed and are followed by a stepped-care program with pharmacological entities including diuretic, beta-adrenergic receptor blocking, antiadrenergic, angiotensin-inhibiting, and vasodilating agents. Precisely how beta-adrenergic blocking drugs reduce arterial pressure still remains to be elucidated, and we still do not understand precisely how the diuretics, direct-acting smooth muscle relaxants, or even the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors work. Nevertheless, it is clear that clinical studies directed toward these questions as well as toward other new classes of antihypertensive agents (including how the calcium-entry blockers, serotonin inhibitors, and others affect vascular smooth muscle contractility) should provide continued enlightenment as to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of essential hypertension.", 
    "41": "A new series of catecholamines has been prepared in which the N-alkyl substituent of dl-epinephrine or dl-isoproterenol has been extended by a methylene chain terminated by a hydroxyl group or derived functionality (e.g., carbamate or ester). These functionalized catecholamines (congeners) and model compounds were prepared with the goal of eventual attachment to polymeric carrier molecules. The beta-adrenergic agonist activity of the derivatives was evaluated in vitro by measuring the intracellular accumulation of cyclic AMP in S49 mouse lymphoma cells and by the displacement of iodocyanopindolol (ICYP). A n-butylcarbamate derivative (compound 15) was the most active compound in this series with a potency 190 times greater than dl-isoproterenol in the S49 assay. The biological results indicate that minor modifications in structure in the N-alkyl substituent of the catecholamine can influence the pharmacologic activity.", 
    "42": "A novel series of N-aminoalkyl congeners and model derivatives of norepinephrine has been synthesized. Compounds that were structurally related to epinephrine were prepared from fully protected intermediates. Alternatively, isoproterenol-related compounds were synthesized via reductive amination of preformed methyl ketone derivatives with norepinephrine. The beta-adrenergic activities of these new compounds were assessed through measurement of intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation in S49 mouse lymphoma cells and displacement of iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) from membrane preparations. Congeners that contained an underivatized primary amine function exhibited virtually no activity in these assays. However, when this amine function was acylated (e.g., to an amide, carbamate, urea, sulfonamide, etc.), the products exhibited generally increased beta-adrenergic activity, which was, however, strongly dependent on the nature of the acylating group and also the length of the spacer. In particular, a benzyl carbamate derivative containing a branched, seven-carbon spacer group was 40 times more potent than isoproterenol in the in vitro S49 assay.", 
    "43": "Dietary sodium restriction is increasingly regarded as important in the prevention and treatment of essential hypertension. However, low-sodium diets are frequently considered unpalatable and therefore unfeasible. The objectives of this study were to determine (a) whether hypertensives, treated and untreated, differ in saltiness taste perception from age-matched normotensive controls and (b) whether sodium reduction can be accomplished by substituting another taste stimulus without reducing apparent saltiness and palatability. Subjects included 72 hypertensives, 44 to 69 years old, divided among three treatment groups; 25 age-matched normotensive controls; and an additional 21 normotensives, 20 to 43 years old, to provide an age continuum for evaluating age effects. Taste responses were measured in terms of saltiness intensity and preference using tomato juice varying systematically in sodium chloride and citric acid content. No significant differences were found between normotensives and hypertensives. No significant effects were associated with blood pressure status, therapeutic regimen, age, sex, race, or anthropometric measurements. Both sodium chloride and citric acid were main effects for saltiness, allowing a trade-off between salt and acid. Addition of citric acid permitted 50% reduction of sodium content in tomato juice without disturbing palatability criteria. Results provide a model for modifying other processed foods.", 
    "44": "Data from the BHAT and the Norwegian timolol trail indicate that beta-blocking agents may provide significant benefit for the post-MI patient--regardless of the location of the infarct or the presence or absence of symptoms (ventricular arrhythmias) or risk factors (heart failure). Despite the lack of data, there is general agreement that beta blockers should be continued for at least 1 to 2 years after infarction in patients who are otherwise asymptomatic, and that these drugs should be continued indefinitely in post-MI patients with angina or hypertension who have no contraindications to beta blockers.", 
    "45": "The authors present three cases of patients with neuroleptic-induced akathisia who were successfully treated with nadolol, a peripherally acting beta blocker. They discuss the potential implications of this finding.", 
    "46": "The responsiveness of adenylyl cyclase during avian myogenesis in vitro has been examined. Measurements of cyclic AMP generation in intact cells revealed that the precursor myoblast is highly responsive to prostaglandin E1 (11-fold maximum stimulation); whereas its response to isoproterenol is much smaller (2-fold). From the onset of terminal differentiation, responsiveness to the beta-adrenergic agonist increases progressively, reaching a 5.5-fold maximum response by 96 hr of culture. In contrast, there is little change in the cell population's responsiveness to prostaglandin E1. The rise in catecholamine responsiveness is consistent with previously reported increases in beta-receptors accompanying differentiation. DL-propranolol blocks the response of myoblasts and myotubes to 10(-6) M isoproterenol with the same half maximal inhibition value of 1 X 10(-8) mol. The results also suggest a change in the adrenergic character of the receptors and/or coupling to adenylyl cyclase as myoblasts differentiate. First the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine (10(-7)-10(-4) mol) inhibits the myoblast's response but enhances that of the myotube. Second, the potency ratios for the responses to isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine shift from 1.1:1.0:1.0 in the myoblast to 3.3:2.1:1.0 in the myotube. The findings are discussed with reference to the role of prostaglandins in the positive control of muscle differentiation and the changes in the catecholamine-responsive adenylyl cyclase system as an aspect of the expression of the muscle phenotype.", 
    "47": "Three forms of carotid sinus hypersensitivity are recognized clinically (cardio-inhibitory, vasodepressor, and mixed). The cardio-inhibitory form has been managed successfully with pacemaker therapy. The vasodepressor element has been difficult to manage clinically whether in its pure form or in combination with the cardio-inhibitory type. We review the various pharmacologic methods previously reported and present our experience with a new pharmacologic alternative, which is the combined use of ephedrine and propranolol to induce unopposed alpha stimulation.", 
    "48": "Hypokalaemia may be produced in man by intravenous adrenaline infusion, or as a result of pathological disturbances which have led to a high plasma adrenaline concentration. With isolated human leucocytes used as a cellular model, adrenaline at concentrations at and above 9 nmol/l increases the influx of rubidium (a model for potassium flux) into cells, with a simultaneous efflux of sodium. There is no effect on Na+,K+-ATPase activity in lysed leucocytes. Use of the adrenoceptor blockers timolol and atenolol shows that the demonstrated effect of adrenaline on coupled active transport of ions is mediated by beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "49": "Dopamine increased the slow inward current in the cardiac preparation after blocking (with tetrodotoxin) or eliminating (with Na+-free perfusion) of the \"fast Na+ channel\". Dopamine was, however, ineffective, if the \"slow channel\" was blocked (by MnCl2 or D-600) or eliminated (by Ca2+ free perfusion). This adrenaline-like effect of dopamine was prevented by beta-adrenergic blockade (pindolol) and was not modified by previous depletion of tissue catecholamine stores (pretreatment with reserpine). Our data suggest that dopamine affects cardiac electrogenesis through beta-adrenergic receptors and any dopamine-induced noradrenaline release may be only of secondary importance beside this direct agonistic effect.", 
    "50": "The effects of d1-2-(3'-t-butylamino-2'-hydroxypropylthio)-4-(5'-carbamoyl-2'-thi enyl) thiazole hydrochloride (S-596) were evaluated in 9 normal volunteers. Exercise echocardiography was performed in the semi-supine position before and 2, 4 and 24 hours after the oral administration of 15 mg of S-596. Two hours after administration, resting heart rate was unchanged, compared with control, but systolic blood pressure at rest was slightly decreased (114 +/- 6 vs 106 +/- 10 mmHg, p less than 0.05). Left ventricular dimensions were unchanged, but shortening fraction was increased in the resting state (30.3 +/- 4.6 vs 33.1 +/- 4.8%, p less than 0.05). During exercise on oral S-596, heart rate and systolic blood pressure responses were reduced (127 +/- 11 in control vs 108 +/- 6 beats/min on S-596, 198 +/- 25 vs 168 +/- 23 mmHg, p less than 0.001 and 0.05, respectively). Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was not significantly altered by S-596 compared with the preceding control exercise test; however, end-systolic dimension was significantly larger after beta blockade with S-596 (2.6 +/- 0.4 vs 3.0 +/- 0.4 cm, p less than 0.05). Shortening fraction and cardiac output decreased significantly (43.7 +/- 3.7 vs 40.0 +/- 5.7%, 9.5 +/- 1.4 vs 8.4 +/- 1.3 L/min, p less than 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). These effects of S-596 were maximal at 2 hours after oral administration with reduced response of heart rate to exercise lasting for 24 hours. Compared with the effects of propranolol (30 mg, given orally) in the same subjects, beta-adrenergic blockade during exercise with S-596 was equivalent to or greater than that of propranolol. Thus, S-596 has little, if any, effect on resting left ventricular performance, but demonstrates potent negative chronotropic and inotropic effects during exercise in normal human subjects. Its beta-adrenergic blocking action also has long acting properties, especially its chronotropic effect.", 
    "51": "The hemodynamic effects of the dihydropyridine derivative Bay k 8644, a new calcium agonist with positive inotropic actions, were studied in instrumented conscious dogs before and after beta adrenergic blockade with propranolol. Intravenous Bay k 8644 (2, 4, 8 and 20 micrograms/kg/min) produced dose-related increases in arterial and left ventricular systolic pressures and myocardial contractility (+dP/dt; % segment shortening). Coronary blood flow velocity was increased at higher doses. Prior administration of propranolol produced no significant alteration of the hemodynamic effects of Bay k 8644. Increases in arterial and left ventricular pressures produced by Bay k 8644 were controlled by intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside with resulting enhancement of positive inotropic effects. The results demonstrate that the hemodynamic responses to this novel calcium agonist with positive inotropic properties are not mediated via beta adrenergic mechanisms and control of increases in arterial pressure lead to enhanced regional contractility.", 
    "52": "APP 201-533 [3-amino-6-methyl-5-phenyl-2(1H)-pyridinone] was investigated in vivo in anesthetized and unanesthetized dogs and pithed open-chest cats and in vitro in guinea pig atria and papillary muscles, skinned muscle fibers from pig hearts, and rat myocardium. Left ventricular dP/dt was increased in anesthetized dogs after intravenous injection of 0.2 and 2 mg/kg APP 201-533 (34 +/- 3 and 132 +/- 28%, respectively) and in unanesthetized dogs after oral doses of 1.5-7.5 mg/kg (34 +/- 11-138 +/- 43%). The substance induced moderate tachycardia. Large intraduodenal doses of APP 201-533 reduced afterload in anesthetized dogs. The compound does not seem to act either by stimulation of alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors or histamine receptors or by liberation of catecholamines. APP 201-533 up to 10(-5) M had no electrophysiological effect on normal action potentials in guinea pig papillary muscles. A phosphodiesterase-inhibiting activity (IC50 = 1.6 X 10(-4) M) may be responsible for the positive inotropic action. Another key to the mechanism of action may be based on our observation of a shift of the relationship between cardiac force and intracellular Ca2+ concentration. In contrast to amrinone and ouabain, APP 201-533 increases Ca2+ sensitivity of the myocardial contractile structures.", 
    "53": "In 12 patients with primary hypertension (World Health Organization stage 2) inadequately controlled by chronic standard triple therapy, hydralazine was replaced by felodipine, a new vasodilating dihydropyridine derivative, and the acute effects of the drug on central and renal hemodynamics were monitored. Following baseline measurements, an oral solution of felodipine (0.075-0.1 mg/kg) was given. Fifteen minutes after intake of felodipine, a significant hypotensive response was observed, and the maximal response (23% reduction of mean arterial pressure) occurred after 30 min. There was a linear relationship between the changes in mean arterial pressure and log plasma concentration of felodipine. Cardiac output (dye dilution) increased during maximal blood pressure reduction, from 5.3 +/- 1.0 to 6.6 +/- 2.4 L/min (p less than 0.01), partly because of increased heart rate from 57 +/- 4 to 65 +/- 9.1 beats/min (p less than 0.01) and partly because of increased stroke volume from 93 +/- 14 to 104 +/- 33 ml (p less than 0.05). Renal plasma flow (para-aminohippuric acid clearance) increased significantly (p less than 0.05) from 343 +/- 138 to 391 +/- 154 ml/min, while glomerular filtration rate ([51Cr]EDTA clearance) did not change. Arteriovenous noradrenaline difference increased 36% during felodipine therapy, when corrected for blood flow increase. We conclude that felodipine is a calcium inhibitor with potent vasodilating properties.", 
    "54": "Mepindolol is a newly developed beta-adrenergic blocking agent reported to counteract the chronotropic effect of catecholamines, with only little effect on contractility. This study was designed to assess whether or not mepindolol is effective in reducing infarct size. Accordingly, 16 rats, serving as controls, underwent coronary artery occlusion and did not receive any treatment; an additional 19 were treated with mepindolol (1 mg/kg s.c. t.i.d.) for 48 h. Finally, a third group (n = 18) underwent sham operation. Forty-eight hours later, infarct size was calculated from left ventricular creatine phosphokinase activity and found to average 52.4 +/- 7.8% (mean +/- SEM) of the left ventricle in control rats and 35.6 +/- 5.4% in treated rats (p less than 0.05). Left ventricular phospholipid content averaged 0.79 +/- 0.08 microgram P/mg protein in sham-operated rats and 0.61 +/- 0.04 microgram P/mg protein in control animals. In contrast, in mepindolol-treated rats, phospholipid concentration was 0.70 +/- 0.04 microgram P/mg protein (p less than 0.05), this suggesting a protective effect of the drug on ischemia-induced phospholipid degradation. The long-term effect of mepindolol on left ventricular hydroxyproline concentration was assessed 21 days post-coronary occlusion. Infarct size calculated by this method was 30.2 +/- 4.8% of left ventricle in 21 control animals and 18.2 +/- 4.2% in 28 treated rats (p less than 0.05), indicating that, as for the acute necrosis, the extent of scar development after coronary artery occlusion can be reduced by mepindolol.", 
    "55": "The mechanism of the vasodilator action of bunitrolol was investigated in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. When injected intraarterially, bunitrolol increased blood flow through the femoral arterial bed more effectively than that through the vascular bed of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). The former is rich in alpha-adrenoceptors and tonically controlled by the sympathetic nerves, whereas the latter is not. Intraarterial prazosin increased femoral flow but not LAD flow, whereas intraarterial nitrendipine increased equieffectively both femoral and LAD flows. In the saphenous arterial bed of dogs that also underwent spinal anesthesia and received atropine and nadolol, intravenous bunitrolol suppressed more effectively vasoconstrictor responses to saphenous nerve stimulation than those to intraarterial norepinephrine. These effects of bunitrolol were similar to those of prazosin and dissimilar to those of yohimbine. In similarly treated dogs, bunitrolol suppressed more effectively increases in mean systemic arterial pressure in response to methoxamine than those to B-HT 920. From these results, it was concluded that an alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking action is mainly involved in the acute vasodilator effect of bunitrolol. This action may also contribute to the decrease in total peripheral resistance seen in hypertensive patients treated chronically with bunitrolol.", 
    "56": "Vmax of the action potential upstroke in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers was studied in the presence of seven class I antiarrhythmic drugs--lidocaine (4 micrograms/ml), mexiletine (4 micrograms/ml), propranolol (0.9 micrograms/ml), procainamide (30 micrograms/ml), quinidine (5 micrograms/ml), flecainide (4 micrograms/ml), and disopyramide (3.1 micrograms/ml)--at constant cycle lengths (CCL) and after abrupt changes in cycle length (ACCL). The time constant of Vmax recovery after ACCL at a basic cycle length of 500 ms was 0.09 +/- 0.01 s for lidocaine, 0.18 +/- 0.03 s for mexiletine, 1.35 +/- 0.20 s for propranolol, 4.4 +/- 0.8 s for procainamide, 8.3 +/- 1.2 s for quinidine, 11.0 +/- 0.9 s for flecainide, and 37.9 +/- 9.4 s for disopyramide. These values were similar to those reported by others in guinea pig papillary muscle, and, with the exception of flecainide, conformed to the scheme proposed by Courtney (J Mol Cell Cardiol 1980; 12:1273-86) based on the molecular weight and lipid solubility hypothesis. Each drug altered the Vmax differently at CCL from after ACCL at the same diastolic intervals. The magnitude of these differences and the range of diastolic intervals at which they were present varied among different drugs. These observations explain differences in the drug effects on the Vmax of the regularly and prematurely occurring depolarizations. In the presence of lidocaine and mexiletine, the recovery kinetics of Vmax were not altered by CCL within the 300-1,500-ms range, and the magnitude of Vmax depression was not influenced by action potential duration within the 200-270-ms range.", 
    "57": "The effects of five antihypertensive agents on lipid biosynthesis from [1-14C]oleate were studied in rat liver minces. At a level of 1 mM, propranolol and prazosin increased the incorporation of [14C]oleate into diglycerides and cholesteryl esters by two- to fourfold and increased total phospholipid labeling by 20-30%. Chlorthalidone and metoprolol at 1 mM also stimulated the incorporation of [14C]oleate into phospholipids and diglycerides (20-50%) but did not affect its incorporation into triglycerides or cholesteryl esters. All four of the compounds statistically significantly inhibited the incorporation of [14C]oleate into phosphatidylcholine by 12-37% but stimulated incorporation into phosphatidylinositol by 17-95%. Nadolol differed from the other compounds in that it did not show selective effects but rather inhibited the incorporation of [14C]oleate into all lipid classes by approximately 50%. The data are discussed in terms of possible mechanisms involved in the lipid synthesis patterns and suggest the possibility that plasma lipid/lipoprotein changes observed in patients undergoing antihypertensive therapy may reflect, in part, altered hepatic lipid synthesis.", 
    "58": "Various antihypertensive agents were studied in vitro to determine their effects on cholesterol esterification by arterial ACAT (acylCoA:cholesterol acyltransferase; E.C. 2.3.1.26) and on the activity of plasma LCAT (lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase; E.C. 2.3.1.43). Propranolol inhibited ACAT in normal rat aorta, atheromatous rabbit aorta, and in isolated microsomes from atheromatous rabbit aorta, and in isolated microsomes from atheromatous rabbit aorta. Inhibition reached 50% in microsomes at approximately 0.8 mM. Metoprolol, prazosin, and chlorthalidone also inhibited microsomal ACAT, but to a lesser extent than propranolol; nadolol had no effect on the enzyme. Propranolol, metoprolol, prazosin, and chlorthalidone also inhibited LCAT in human plasma, whereas nadolol showed no inhibitory effect. Fifty percent inhibition occurred at 2 mM with prazosin and chlorthalidone and at 4-5 mM with propranolol. Metoprolol showed a weak dose-dependent inhibition that ranged from 2 to 10% over the concentration range 0.5-5 mM. The data suggest a mechanistic basis for altered lipoprotein profiles observed clinically with certain antihypertensive therapies and suggest that a direct effect of beta-blockers on arterial wall metabolism may account for their recognized ability to reduce the development of experimental atherosclerosis and to improve survival in post-myocardial infarction patients.", 
    "59": "We compared the responses to noradrenaline, serotonin, and potassium of isolated intramyocardial (flow-regulating) coronary and mesenteric resistance vessels of similar internal diameter (approximately 200 microns) from Wistar rats. The coronary but not the mesenteric resistance vessels had spontaneous basal tone, which was reduced by elimination of extracellular calcium, by increasing the extracellular potassium concentration up to 22 mM, and by stimulation of coronary vessels with noradrenaline. Noradrenaline always caused contraction of mesenteric resistance vessels and in coronary vessels after incubation with propranolol (3 X 10(-6) M). The noradrenaline and potassium concentration-response characteristics of the mesenteric resistance vessels were modulated by perivascular adrenergic nerve terminals, whereas no influence of nerve terminals could be shown in the coronary resistance vessels. The sensitivity of mesenteric vascular smooth muscle to noradrenaline [concentration required to give half maximal response (EC50) approximately 0.4 X 10(-6) M] and serotonin (EC50 approximately 0.3 X 10(-6) M) was higher (p less than 0.001) than the sensitivity of coronary smooth muscle (EC50 values 1.6 X 10(-6) and 1.3 X 10(-6) M, respectively). The potassium sensitivity of the coronary smooth muscle (EC50 approximately 35 mM) was higher than that of the mesenteric smooth muscle (EC50 approximately 41 mM; p less than 0.01). The respective maximal noradrenaline and serotonin responses relative to the maximal potassium response were 35 and 55% in the coronary and 127 and 120% in the mesenteric resistance vessels (p less than 0.001).", 
    "60": "Incubation of enzymatically dissociated cardiac myocytes with carbachol leads to a time- and concentration-dependent loss of beta-receptors assayable with [3H]CGP-12177. This loss is due to a redistribution of beta-receptors from the plasma membrane to a cytosol-derived vesicular fraction, consistent with an internalization process. The carbachol effects are not influenced by gallamine or oxotremorine which interact with the high-affinity (M2) muscarinic receptors. These results suggest that carbachol-induced desensitization is secondary to activation of protein kinase C by diacylglycerols generated through M1 receptor-linked phosphoinositide hydrolysis.", 
    "61": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are useful antihypertensive agents. Enalapril maleate is a new ACE inhibitor with actions similar to those of captopril but with fewer side-effects. A study was conducted on 19 black South Africans with mild or moderate essential hypertension; enalapril was compared with propranolol as monotherapy or together with hydrochlorothiazide in a 1-year randomized, double-blind, parallel study. Neither enalapril nor propranolol alone produced consistent, significant reductions in blood pressure. There were no significant differences between the blood pressure responses to enalapril and to propranolol (either with or without hydrochlorothiazide). It is concluded that neither enalapril nor propranolol is effective as monotherapy in the treatment of hypertension in South African blacks, but that both require the addition of a thiazide diuretic.", 
    "62": "Eleven physically active men with systemic hypertension were studied after 5 weeks of treatment with placebo, atenolol or propranolol. A double-blind, crossover randomized design was used. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), physical performance capacity, rate of perceived exertion and blood lactate concentrations were measured during rest, exercise to exhaustion and postexercise, at 8 and 24 hours after intake of the last dose. Blood pressure at rest and during exercise was similarly decreased with both drugs (8 and 24 hours), and there was no difference between 8 and 24 hours with any of the treatments. Heart rate (8 hours) was decreased similarly by both drugs, but after 24 hours, HR at increased workloads (above 120 watts) was higher with atenolol compared with propranolol. Maximal HR was lower with propranolol than atenolol at both 8 and 24 hours. Maximal exercise loads (8 and 24 hours) were 231 and 232 watts with placebo, 211 and 212 with propranolol and 228 and 227 with atenolol. That is, maximal workload was decreased with propranolol compared with placebo and atenolol at both 8 and 24 hours. No difference was found between placebo and atenolol at either 8 or 24 hours. The rate of perceived exertion values were higher with propranolol than atenolol. Blood lactate concentrations did not differ according to treatments. The results indicate that atenolol, when given in a dose that decreases resting and exercise BP to the same extent as propranolol, limits physical performance less than propranolol.", 
    "63": "The effect of selective and nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade on the thermoregulatory responses of 11 physically active, healthy, young adult men was studied during 2-hour block-stepping in heat. The trial consisted of 3 periods of 6 days each during which propranolol (160 mg/day), atenolol (100 mg) or matching placebo was administered in a randomized, double-blind crossover fashion. Propranolol and atenolol induced similar, significant (p less than 0.001) increases in subjective ratings of perceived exertion. The mechanism of this increased fatigue was not evident from the documented alterations in serum electrolyte, blood glucose and blood lactate levels or ventilatory parameters. Propranolol did, however, induce a postexercise delayed serum-potassium reversion. Although rectal and mean skin temperature responses were essentially unaltered by beta-adrenoceptor blockade during block-stepping, an increased total sweat loss was observed with propranolol (p less than 0.01 versus placebo) and to a lesser degree with atenolol (p = not significant versus placebo). This indicates that persons receiving beta-adrenoceptor blockers have an increased need to adhere to a strict fluid-replacement regimen during exercise. This potentially adverse response was minimal with atenolol in contrast to propranolol, and this in turn suggests the use of beta1-selective adrenoceptor blockers during prolonged exercise when adequate fluid replacement is not possible.", 
    "64": "Twenty-five highly trained runners with a maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) of 64.7 +/- 4.3 ml . kg-1. min-1 were administered clinically equivalent doses of a nonselective (propranolol) and a cardioselective (atenolol) beta-blocking agent as well as a placebo. The subjects performed a horizontal treadmill test on the eighth day and a 10-km track race on the tenth day of each treatment. Beta blockade decreased submaximal heart rate and propranolol caused the largest decrease. Beta blockade caused a decrease in maximal heart rate, VO2 max, maximal ventilation, maximal respiratory exchange ratio and treadmill time. Propranolol caused a greater decrease than atenolol in each of these values. The 10-km race times were significantly slower during beta blockade, and propranolol race times were significantly slower than atenolol race times. It is concluded that the performance of highly trained distance runners is significantly altered by beta-adrenergic blockade and that nonselective agents reduce performance to a greater extent than cardioselective agents.", 
    "65": "A study was undertaken to determine if normal healthy subjects can increase their endurance capacity consequent to endurance training during chronic beta-adrenergic blockade. Forty-seven subjects, 17 to 34 years of age, were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments (placebo, propranolol, 160 mg/day, and atenolol, 100 mg/day) and then completed a 15-week aerobic exercise training program. All groups reduced their submaximal steady-state heart rates consequent to training; submaximal oxygen uptake was slightly reduced; submaximal stroke volume was increased only in the placebo and atenolol groups; submaximal cardiac output was generally lower; and arterial-mixed venous oxygen difference was increased after training in all 3 groups, suggesting decreased muscle blood flow and increased oxidative capacity. Maximal oxygen uptake and maximal treadmill time were increased in all 3 groups after training. However, while still on medication the atenolol group had significantly greater increases in maximal oxygen uptake and maximal treadmill time compared with the propranolol group. Because most patients will remain on medication, these results suggest a distinct advantage for cardioselective blocking agents. It is concluded that beta-adrenergic blockade does not reduce the ability of normal healthy subjects to gain the benefits associated with cardiorespiratory endurance training.", 
    "66": "Forty-seven healthy male subjects, 17 to 34 years old, completed a test to exhaustion on a motor-driven treadmill to determine their maximal oxygen uptake. A second test was administered 2 days later during which the subject walked for 20 to 25 minutes at a steady-state level representing 60% of the maximal oxygen uptake as determined in the first test. The grade was then increased every 2 minutes until the subject reached the state of exhaustion. After the second test, the subjects were randomly assigned, in a double-blind manner, to either placebo, propranolol (160 mg/day), or atenolol (100 mg/day) treatment for 7 days. Exactly 1 week from the time of the second test, and 3 hours after the last medication, the subjects completed the final exercise test using the same treadmill protocol administered in the second test. Heart rate and systolic blood pressure at rest and during submaximal steady-state exercise were significantly reduced by both drugs, whereas diastolic pressure was unaffected. During submaximal steady-state exercise, cardiac output was reduced in both the placebo and atenolol groups, stroke volume was increased in both atenolol and propranolol groups, oxygen uptake was reduced in the atenolol group, pulmonary ventilation was reduced in both propranolol and atenolol groups, and the respiratory exchange ratio remained unchanged. With maximal exercise, treadmill time was significantly reduced with propranolol, pulmonary ventilation and heart rate were reduced significantly with both drugs, but maximal oxygen uptake remained unchanged. Thus, beta blockade does not appear to limit ability to exercise. However, there appears to be a significant advantage to using a cardioselective rather than a nonselective beta-blocking agent.", 
    "67": "Beta-adrenergic blockade using intravenous propranolol was evaluated as a countermeasure for bedrest-induced cardiovascular deconditioning. After propranolol administration, tolerance to a maximal lower body negative pressure (LBNP) test after bed rest improved to at least the -70 mm Hg level; following this, there was a sharp decrease in tolerance time. Propranolol decreased mean tolerance time by 36% (17.7 +/- 2.4 to 11.5 +/- 2.3 minutes) before bed rest, and by only half as much (16.6%) after bed rest (14.4 +/- 2.2 to 12.0 +/- 2.3 minutes). Systemic vascular resistance was maintained and even slightly increased after propranolol despite a decrease in cardiac output, indicating beta 2-adrenergic blockade. Heart rates at all levels of LBNP were lower during beta blockade, yet increases occurred with successive LBNP steps, both before and after bed rest, indicating withdrawal of parasympathetic nervous system influences. Results support the use of propranolol in small dosages as a countermeasure after bed rest, and the findings may also be extrapolated to space-flight deconditioning.", 
    "68": "Although it is well accepted that treatment with beta-blocking drugs impairs endurance exercise capacity acutely, whether a trained state can be achieved while receiving long-term beta-blocker therapy is controversial. The apparent attenuation of training reported in some studies has given rise to the theory that adrenergic stimulation represents a unifying mechanism by which endurance training effects are produced. This theory is supported by studies of long-term beta-agonist infusions that show apparent training responses. To assess the role of beta-adrenergic stimulation produced by exercise in the development of cardiovascular training effects, 39 healthy men were assigned in a random, double-blind fashion to receive oral propranolol, atenolol or matched placebo. Drug doses were titrated individually to minimize the heart rate response to submaximal exercise (dose ranges: atenolol, 50 to 200 mg/day; propranolol, 160 to 320 mg/day). After beginning chronic drug administration, all subjects participated in an intense, supervised 6-week exercise training program (5 days/week, 45 min/day, at least 75% peak heart rate). Adherence to training was monitored by daily supervision; compliance to the medication regimen was assessed by weekly pill counts, medication diaries and plasma drug assay. Maximal exercise testing was performed before and after training. Peak oxygen consumption increased significantly with training in all 3 groups, whether comparisons were made in the presence or absence of medication. The magnitude of change in oxygen consumption did not differ between groups (F = 0.12, p greater than 0.88). Similarly, peak work rate and duration of work increased in all 3 groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "During normal exercise the myocardium, skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue all participate in the metabolic response to exercise. Beta-blockade, by impairing this biochemical-metabolic response at several levels, limits the capacity for maximal exercise. The relevant effects of beta blockade may include hypoglycemia, impaired mobilization of free fatty acids and decreased breakdown of glycogen in skeletal muscle. The organs responsible for these metabolic changes are the liver (blood sugar), adipose tissue (blood free fatty acids) and skeletal muscle. Most of the metabolic beta-adrenergic receptors are thought to be beta 2 in nature. Two populations of receptors (mixed beta 1 and beta 2) may explain some controversial findings. Overall, the data suggest that cardioselective agents may have less effect than nonselective agents in producing metabolic impairment during sustained exercise.", 
    "70": "Human skeletal muscle contains 2 muscle fiber types: slow twitch (type I) and fast twitch (type II). They have different profiles including their biochemical, metabolic, O2 diffusion, microcirculatory and neuromotor characteristics. The slow twitch fiber represents endurance, high combustive potential and recruitment during moderate activity; in contrast, the fast twitch represents explosiveness, force, high capacity for phosphate splitting and lactate formation, but is more fatiguable. A muscle rich in slow twitch fibers is confined to low peripheral resistance at rest and during exercise, higher exercise leg blood flow and higher maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max). During graded exercise lactate has been shown to be a good marker for the metabolic and circulatory characteristics of the contracting muscle and the exercise intensity (W) eliciting a blood lactate concentration of 4 mmol/liter-1 [(WOBLA) from onset of blood lactate accumulation] integrated for peripheral metabolic, neuromotor and central circulatory potentials both in health and disease. It is well known that a blood lactate level greater than 4 mmol/liter-1 represents a major increase in sympathetic tone and is incompatible with endurance or prolonged exercise. With prolonged exercise and sympathetic regulation both circulation and metabolism adapt. Adipose tissue is stimulated and fatty acids are released. Muscle tissue lipoprotein lipase activity is enhanced; that is, there is increased utilization of blood triglycerides for local lipolysis in the capillary bed of the contracting muscle. Both mechanisms will increase fatty acid availability and induce a \"glycogen-sparing effect\" resulting in a reduced respiratory exchange ratio. Studies have shown that both the magnitude of the initial glycogen stores and these adaptive responses will determine performance time. With age, changes take place in heart rate regulation, neuromotor control and muscle fibers. Thus VO2 max is decreased, but partly compensated for by a fast motor unit and fiber loss leading to a muscle more rich in slow twitch fibers--an \"endurance training-like effect.\" Relative endurance is also increased with age; however, lactate metabolism is still a critical feature. The OBLA concept describes capacity for both occupational and leisure-time physical activity.", 
    "71": "Exercise training effects occur in man after chronic exposure to aerobic exercise, which should be defined quantitatively to permit a precise mechanistic understanding. Exercise adaptations result from circulatory and metabolic changes that involve altered responsiveness to neurohumoral transmitters at the receptor level. The adrenergic mechanisms are most important and are linked to new understandings of the adrenergic receptor and its coupling with biochemical processes in the cell. The adrenergic receptor is a specialized protein in the cell membrane linked to the catalytic moiety of the enzyme adenylate cyclase by a coupling protein controlled by guanine nucleotides. The sensitivity of this receptor mechanism may be altered by exposure to agonists and antagonists and by circulatory and metabolic diseases. The effects of beta- adrenergic blockers on exercise adaptation and the clinical sequelae are emphasized.", 
    "72": "Administration of beta blockers decreases tachycardia during exercise. In this regard, the effects of cardioselective drugs are similar to those of noncardioselective drugs. Beta blockers with partial agonist activity, however, may produce a lesser decrease in tachycardia during exercise. Cardioselective beta blockers have significantly less effect than noncardioselective drugs on isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. This may result from 2 factors: the failure of cardioselective drugs to block a beta 2 receptor-mediated vasodilator reflex tachycardia and their failure to block cardiac chronotropic beta 2 receptors. Exercise increases plasma catecholamine concentrations and the increases are larger in the presence of beta blockers. Cardioselective beta blockers produce larger increases. There is evidence for attenuation of exercise conditioning by beta blockers and this effect is probably shared by cardioselective and noncardioselective drugs. Beta blockers produce regulatory increases in beta receptor density, and physical training may do the opposite. The interaction between these 2 processes remains to be defined.", 
    "73": "Fifty-nine male volunteers with stable coronary artery disease underwent 1 year of supervised exercise and were compared with 69 similar control patients. Both groups underwent exercise tests initially and at 1 year to determine maximal oxygen uptake. Initial and 1-year tests were performed with patients off all cardiac medications including beta blockers. Although patients had been randomized to exercise intervention, administration of beta blockers was at the prerogative of their physicians. Thirty-seven percent of the trained group and 39% of the control group were taking beta blockers during the year of study. Regardless of whether or not beta blockers were administered, patients in the exercise intervention group had a significant increase in aerobic capacity and improvement in the other hemodynamic markers of training compared with control subjects. Of the trained patients, those on beta blockers were able to comply with the exercise regimen as well as those not taking beta blockers.", 
    "74": "Training bradycardia during autonomic blockade has been studied in rats and humans. The heart rate after autonomic blockade (intrinsic heart rate) is also lowered as a part of the adaptation to training. However, this nonautonomic component of the cardiac adaptation requires a long duration of intense endurance training to appear. This is in contrast to the autonomic component of the training bradycardia. From animal studies we have concluded that even if the training bradycardia is due to an adaptation within the heart itself, the adrenergic nerves are important for the development of a slow intrinsic heart rate. Neither the beta-receptor stimulation nor the degree of the heart rate increase during exercise is the main stimulus for the development of a training-induced bradycardia. Well-trained bicyclists had an intrinsic heart rate 20 beats lower than untrained normal control subjects. The heart rate at rest and the maximal heart rate were also on an average 20 beats lower for the bicyclists. There was no significant difference between propranolol and the beta 1 selective metoprolol in this study regarding their effects on heart rate and on deterioration of the maximal oxygen consumption after blockade. This deterioration was more marked in the well-trained than in the sedentary group. Based upon studies both in normal subjects and patients a careful rating of symptoms including physical exertion, fatigue or pain in the legs, dyspnea and chest pain using a Borg scale is recommended during exercise testing with beta blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "Beta-adrenoceptor blockade produces a well-established constellation of hemodynamic effects at rest and during exercise. The beneficial clinical response in patients with hypertension and angina pectoris relates directly to these hemodynamic effects. A number of molecular modifications have accomplished more selective or additional circulatory effects designed to improve the efficacy and reduce the adverse effects of these drugs. In considering further clinical application of these agents, new data relating to the role of the sympathetic nervous system in the response to exercise, in the control of heart rate and in the progression of the syndrome of heart failure must be considered.", 
    "76": "Activation of the sympathetic nervous system has traditionally been regarded as an important compensatory mechanism that helps to maintain myocardial contractility in severe heart failure. Recent findings suggest that increased catecholamine levels are linked to decreased beta-adrenergic receptor density and myocardial damage. Thus, rather than aiding the failing heart, increased myocardial exposure to catecholamines may actually contribute to further deterioration in myocardial function. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may ameliorate these harmful effects and paradoxically result in improved ventricular performance."
