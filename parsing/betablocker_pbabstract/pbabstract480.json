This phenomenon gave reason to assume that these high concentrations in the pigmented structures of the eye might be related to melanin binding. According to literature a series of drugs, e.g. chloroquine, rifampicine, chlorpromazine, benzodiazepines, and also beta-adrenoceptor antagonists exhibit melanin-binding properties. By means of autoradiography it could be demonstrated in pigmented mice that after iv and po administration 14C-labelled bisoprolol was selectively bound to the melanin-containing parts of the eye, irrespective of the mode of administration. Since the melanin-bound radioactivity could be extracted from the eye of mice and was eliminated with a t1/2 of approx. 7 days, the melanin binding of bisoprolol is considered to be reversible. Other beta-blocking agents like timolol and befunolol used already for a long time in the therapy of glaucoma have been reported to bind specifically to the melanin of the eye, and show comparable long half-lives, similar to bisoprolol. Usually, autoradiographic studies on drug distribution are performed with albino animals. This leads to a lack of information on melanin binding and may result in misinterpretation concerning the retention of substances, especially in pigmented compartments of the eye. Therefore, in autoradiographic studies of new investigational drugs during preclinical development, one should use both pigmented and albino animals.", 
    "1": "In order to search for effective antimyocardial ischemic agents, fourteen new 3-[4-[(3-alkylamino-2-hydroxy)propoxy]phenyl(benzyl)]-substituted 4(3H)-quinazolinones (II) were synthesized. Substituted o-aminobenzoic acids used as the starting materials were allowed to react with acetic anhydride and then p-amino-phenol (method A), or with N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)formamide (method B), or with thionyl chloride and then N-(4-hydroxybenzyl)formamide (method C) to form 3-[(4-hydroxyphenyl(benzyl)]-substituted 4(3H)-quinazolinones (III). The intermediate III reacted with epichlorohydrin to form the epoxides (IV). The reaction of IV with an excess of isopropylamine or tert-butylamine in boiling chloroform gave the desired products. Of all the compounds synthesized, compounds II3-5 and II13 were found to increase the tolerance of mice to hypoxia. Further evaluation is in progress.", 
    "2": "beta-adrenergic blocking drugs reduce myocardial oxygen consumption, chiefly by reducing heart rate as the principal basis for their efficacy in ischaemic heart disease. Regardless of the presence of associated properties, beta, selectivity, partial agonist activity, all beta-blocking drugs have been found efficacious in the treatment of angina pectoris, both alone and in combination with drugs such as nitrates and calcium antagonists. Holter monitoring has demonstrated beta blockers also reduce the incidence of silent ischaemia. Finally, they are established in the treatment of acute infarction and secondary prevention of recurrences. There are inherent disadvantages of inhibition of the beta sympathetic, most notably the precipitation of asthma and heart failure in susceptible subjects. Recently, combined-action beta-blocking drugs have been developed, i.e. combining beta blockade with peripheral vasodilator activity, either by alpha 1, blockade, beta 2 stimulation or a direct effect independent of either receptor. They have a more favourable haemodynamic profile and, while initial studies are promising, it is not yet clear whether this will be translated into improved clinical benefit in ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "3": "Combinations of beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents and vasodilators have been widely used because of their favorable hemodynamic actions and their high efficacy. In comparison with the free combination of the two active principles, substances that combine vasodilation and beta-blockade in a single molecule may lead to a simplification of therapy and thus to an improvement in compliance. Substances that show clear beta-blocking and vasodilating actions at therapeutic doses have already been introduced to therapy or are in an advanced stage of clinical development. The vasodilating action of amosulalol, carvedilol and labetalol is achieved by blockade of the alpha 1-receptors. In contrast, partial agonistic action on beta 2-receptors is responsible for the vasodilatation with dilevalol. This mechanism probably also plays an important role in the vasodilatation induced by celiprolol. While classical beta-blocker lead to a rise in peripheral resistance and to a marked fall in cardiac output, peripheral resistance falls during treatment with vasodilating beta-blockers. The cardiac output is either only slightly reduced or virtually unchanged. Surprisingly, three months' treatment with the vasodilating beta-blocker bucindolol in patients with severe heart failure led to a rise in cardiac output and in ejection fraction and to a reduction of the heart rate and pulmonary wedge pressure. An improvement of left-ventricular function was also obtained on administration of carvedilol in patients with coronary heart disease. Theoretically, it is conceivable that substances with additional alpha 1-blocking actions, such as labetalol, carvediolol or amosulalol, or with partial agonistic activity such as celiprolol or dilevalol, would have a clearly more favourable effect on the blood lipid profile than the classical beta-blocking agents. Initial results appear to confirm this, but final conclusions will only be possible when the results of prospective comparative studies are available.", 
    "4": "By subcutaneous insertion of osmotic minipumps leading to continuous infusion of l-adrenaline, we were able to induce hypertension in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto strain (WKY) rats which was shown to be completely reversible by application of the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist carvedilol. No consistent effect of adrenaline on heart rate could be observed. At least in rat heart, adrenaline replaced the original neurotransmitter noradrenaline in amine storage sites, the sum of all catecholamines remaining unchanged. By comparing tissue concentrations of endogenous amines of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and stroke-prone-SHR (SHR-SP) to the corresponding levels of their normotensive controls of the Wistar-Kyoto strain, we detected various differences in amine handling during the development of high blood pressure. Significant increases of adrenal gland catecholamines at the ages of 8 and 14 weeks are accompanied by striking alterations of catecholamine (CA) storage in other peripheral organs like the heart and kidneys. Most prominent increases, as compared to controls, were found in adrenaline concentrations in heart and kidney at all ages studied, with levels two to four times higher than the respective WKY concentrations. The results are compatible with a permissive role of adrenaline as a cotransmitter in the initiation and/or maintenance of hypertension. After incorporation into endogenous amine storage vesicles, e.g., of the heart, adrenaline is probably released, together with noradrenaline, upon nerve stimulation. By stimulating presynaptic beta 2-adrenoceptors, adrenaline is able to facilitate noradrenaline release and to enhance noradrenergic vasoconstriction. The resulting increase of peripheral sympathetic tone may be responsible for the pathogenesis of rat genetic and human essential hypertension, as well as for the triggering of myocardial infarction. The blockade of presynaptic beta-receptors is supposed to represent an important mechanism of action of non-selective beta-blocking agents. In the case of carvedilol, this effect is supported by additional antagonism at vascular alpha-adrenoceptors, leading to vasodilation.", 
    "5": "The effect of a pre-treatment with the chelator MgNa2EDTA (0.5 mg.kg-1 i.v.) on the influencing of cardiac contractility by Trimepranol (0.3 mg.kg-1 i.v.) was studied in rabbits in vivo under pentobarbital anaesthesia in the conditions of the spontaneous and paced heart rates and compared with the effects of the administration of the chelator MgNa2EDTA (0.5 mg.kg-1 i.v.) alone. The administration of the chelator alone induced especially commencing with the end of the first hour of observation, a progressive decrease in the left ventricular dP/dtmax. both in the paced heart (max. 67.0 % in the 170th min) and in the nonpaced heart conditions (max. 60.9 % in the 180th min). The administration of Trimepranol (120 min after the pre-treatment with the chelator) resulted in a pronounced increase in a negative inotropic effect (max. 43.1% in the paced and 35.3 % in the non-paced heart, always in the 130th min, i.e., 10 min after the administration of the beta-blocker), which was in most intervals significantly different from the values of dP/dtmax. after the administration of the chelator alone. A significant increase in the negative inotropic effect was manifested also by deaths of a number of experimental animals before the end of observation. On the basis of the results obtained, it is possible to assume that the combination of the administration of MgNa2EDTA with beta-blockers may especially result in an increase in the cardiodepressive action and in an occurrence of adverse effects on the hemodynamics of the organism.", 
    "6": "The objective of this study was to determine the rate-limiting layer(s) in the penetration of ocular hypotensive beta blockers across the corneal epithelium in the pigmented rabbit. The beta blockers studied were, in order of increasing lipophilicity, atenolol, timolol, levobunolol, and betaxolol. Corneal drug penetration was evaluated over 240 min using the isolated pigmented rabbit cornea in the modified Ussing chamber. Reversed phase HPLC was the analytical methodology. The cornea was preexposed to 20-100 microM digitonin for 15 min in an attempt to strip off selective layers of the corneal epithelium. The corneal epithelium offered no resistance to the penetration of the very lipophilic betaxolol. The major resistance to the corneal penetration of the moderately lipophilic timolol and levobunolol was in the superficial cell layers of the corneal epithelium. For the hydrophilic atenolol, the resistance to corneal drug penetration appeared to extend across all corneal epithelial cell layers. The above findings suggest that the number of corneal epithelial cell layers limiting the corneal penetration of ocularly administered drugs is inversely related to drug lipophilicity.",

The relaxation was inhibited with metoprolol and methylene blue, but not inhibited with yohimbine and indomethacin. 3. NE (10(-5) M) significantly elevated tissue c-GMP levels in segments with endothelium. 4. These studies suggest that the vascular relaxation by high doses of NE is mediated by the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) induced by the stimulation of beta 1-adrenoceptor.", 
    "8": "The pharmacokinetics of the beta 1-selective adrenergic antagonist (R,S)-celiprolol has been studied after oral administration of 200 mg celiprolol-HCl to 8 healthy volunteers and 8 patients with various degrees of impaired renal function. No significant difference was found between the two enantiomers in the control group or in the patients. In healthy volunteers an average of 9.8% of the dose of R-(+)-celiprolol and 9.5% of S-(-)-celiprolol was recovered unchanged in the urine. Renal impairment reduced the urinary excretion of both enantiomers to the same extent according to the severity of the uraemia, producing higher AUCs. Nevertheless, the terminal half-lives of the R- and S-enantiomers were not significantly different between the groups. Dosage reduction in patients with renal impairment does not seem to be necessary.", 
    "9": "The plasma concentration-time curve of the hydrolysis product of bopindolol has been investigated in 14 patients with cirrhosis and in 15 healthy volunteers given a single oral dose of 2 mg bopindolol. Cirrhosis was confirmed by history and clinical examination or liver biopsy. The time to maximum concentration, maximum concentration and AUC of hydrolyzed bopindolol were similar in the patients and controls. However, the elimination half-life was 6.0 h in controls and 9.5 h in cirrhotics. Antipyrine clearance was markedly decreased in patients with cirrhosis, but no correlation was found with the pharmacokinetic parameters of hydrolysed bopindolol. Although the AUC was not significantly altered in patients with cirrhosis, the longer half-life of hydrolysed bopindolol suggests impairment of its disposition in liver disease, which could lead to significant accumulation of drug during chronic dosing.", 
    "10": "A great number of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs are now available for clinical use which show great differences with respect to their pharmacokinetic properties. Bioavailability might be low because of a low absorption rate after oral application in the case of hydrophilic drugs like atenolol or might be low because of a high first-pass effect in the liver in the case of metoprolol or propranolol. Plasma levels of these latter drugs may vary considerably and inhibition of their oxidative metabolism by cimetidine may lead to an increase of peak plasma concentrations. In general, lipophilic beta-blockers are metabolized in the liver whereas hydrophilic agents are eliminated in the kidneys as unchanged drugs. Dose has to be adjusted according to renal function in the case of atenolol, carteolol, nadolol, sotalol and acebutolol, which is transformed into the active metabolite diacetolol. Drugs like bisoprolol, betaxolol and pindolol are eliminated via the liver and the kidneys. Bisoprolol, for example, shows a balanced clearance as it is eliminated to about 50% in the liver and 50% via the kidneys. Failure of one clearance organ (liver, kidney) leads to a maximally twofold increase in plasma half-life of bisoprolol. Being aware of the observation that some drugs show a long terminal half-life, it has been demonstrated that plasma levels correlate to duration of action. This is of major importance for the treatment of coronary heart disease as a once-daily dose should be active for 24 h.", 
    "11": "Several beta-adrenoceptor blockers with various ancillary properties besides beta-receptor blockade are now available for clinical use. In the treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris, and certain types of cardiac arrhythmia the therapeutic benefit is mediated by beta 1-receptor blockade, whereas the blockade of beta 2-adrenoceptors does usually not contribute to the therapeutic efficacy and is rather associated with adverse reactions. Accordingly, all properties other than beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade should be considered as ancillary properties. The following properties of beta-blockers and the therapeutic relevance of these properties are to be discussed, together with pertinent examples of the drugs involved: beta 1-receptor selectivity and the degree of beta 2-receptor blockade; intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA); duration of action (to be discussed in connection with the pharmacokinetic properties in Prof. Borchard's presentation); lipophilicity, brain penetration and CNS side effects, and cardioprotective properties (secondary prevention following myocardial infarction). Most of these properties have been investigated in full detail and a wide variety of compounds possessing one or more of these properties have been introduced. With respect to the future, beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity remains an interesting issue, although it is difficult to imagine that compounds which are even more beta 1-selective than bisoprolol can be developed. The cardioprotective activity of beta-blockers deserves further investigations, in particular with respect to the underlying mechanisms. Finally, many new beta-blockers are now becoming available with an additional vasodilator component which may be caused by different mechanisms, like 'direct' vasodilation, beta 2-receptor agonism, alpha-adrenoceptor blockade, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. The various mechanisms and possible clinical relevance will be discussed.", 
    "12": "In healthy volunteers a 14-day treatment with the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist xamoterol (2 x 200 mg/day) desensitized beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated physiological effects, but did not affect beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated effects; in contrast, a 9-day treatment with the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist procaterol (2 x 50 micrograms/day) desensitized beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated physiological effects, but did not affect beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated effects suggesting that in general in man long-term treatment with beta-adrenoceptor agonists down-regulates beta-adrenoceptors, but in a beta-adrenoceptor subtype-selective manner. Similarly, in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting chronic treatment with different beta-adrenoceptor antagonists without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity subtype-selectively up-regulated beta-adrenoceptors: non-selective antagonists (propranolol, sotalol) increased both cardiac beta 1- and cardiac, saphenous vein and lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors, whereas beta 1-selective antagonists (metoprolol, atenolol, bisoprolol) increased only cardiac beta 1-, but not cardiac, saphenous vein or lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors. Such a subtype-selective modulation of human beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors should be taken into consideration when treating patients chronically with beta-adrenoceptor agonists and/or antagonists.", 
    "13": "Although they have been in use for over 20 years, the antihypertensive mode of action of beta-blocking drugs remains a matter for debate. Blood pressure falls with beta-blockers that have beta 1-selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and membrane activity, but not those with a high level of pure beta-stimulation. Several suggestions have been made to explain this effect; a direct action on the central nervous system, adrenergic neurone blocking, perhaps via pre-synaptic beta 2-receptors, anti-renin activity, an increase of vasodilator prostaglandins, effects secondary to reduced cardiac output, and resetting of baroreceptors secondary to reduced pressor peaks to various pressor stimuli from the reduction in cardiac activity consequent to beta-blockade. There are also beta-blocking drugs which additionally have direct action to reduce peripheral resistance, via beta 2-mediated vasodilation, an alpha-blocking action or a direct vasodilator activity. Most attention has been given to a possible correlation to the effect of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs on the blood pressure and renin levels. Several investigations have found patients with high renin levels respond best, normal renin patients respond less well and low renin patients relatively poorly. However, others have not found a clear relationship.", 
    "14": "We have investigated the possibility that direct cellular effects may mediate the action of EPI to lower the IOP. To do this, cultured HTM and SCE cells were grown as monolayers over a millipore-filter support structure. The monolayers were exposed to various adrenergic agonists and antagonists while flow of the perfusate (DME + 5% FBS) was measured using a specially-designed computer-linked apparatus. Exposure of the cells to 10(-5) M EPI for around 2 hours led to a rapid twofold increase in HC which gradually declines over the next 12 hours. Continuous exposure of either cell type (ie, HTM or SCE cells) to EPI or ISO resulted in a four- to eightfold increase with a maximal effect measured around 10 hours and a half maximal effect at 2.5 hours. Administration of c-AMP alone gave similar responses. In agreement with clinical studies, timolol blocks EPI's effect completely while betaxolol acted as a partial antagonist. These findings suggest that the cellular changes and the increase in HC are mediated by a beta-2 receptor. There are many similarities between the responses observed using our in vitro system and the IOP-lowering response observed in vivo after the topical application of EPI (eg, concentration, time course, duration, and magnitude). The clinical implications of these preliminary results are discussed and it is proposed that the described in vitro system may be useful to select new adrenergic drugs for glaucoma therapy.", 
    "15": "We performed a prospective, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 20 young healthy female volunteers. We evaluated both the cardiovascular and IOP effects of both timolol maleate and apraclonidine hydrochloride. In addition, we evaluated the plasma levels of various apraclonidine concentrations. We utilized 0.5% timolol and both the 0.25% and 0.50% concentrations of apraclonidine. Both timolol and apraclonidine lowered IOP comparably. Timolol lowered the resting pulse rate and blunted exercise-induced tachycardia. Apraclonidine did not affect blood pressure or heart rate any differently than placebo. We detected plasma levels of apraclonidine in many individuals for up to 8 hours. These serum levels were variable and did not appear to relate to the quantity of IOP lowering.", 
    "16": "In 30 hypertensives with angina pectoris the acute action of beta-blockers Celiprolol and Metoprolol on the global and coronary haemodynamics was tested within cardiac catheter diagnostics. In accordance with no long-term effects Metoprolol acts negatively inotrope, chronotrope as well as pre- and post-load increasing. Celiprolol lowered the pre- and postload, and increased the cardiac output, but did not influence the heart rate. Both medicaments increased coronary flow and myocardiac oxygen consumption. From the mentioned effects important conclusions for therapy with both Beta-blockers can be derived.", 
    "17": "The evaluation of cardiac function alone from pressure and volume data can lead to misinterpretations. By linking of pressure and volume data a variety of new parameters can be calculated. Computer techniques allow the evaluation not only of cardiac work, but also of acceleration work and the efficiency of heart power. As an example of double blind study with CHD patients the measurement of such parameters under invasive diagnostics is demonstrated, facilitating a detailed evaluation of cardiac function.", 
    "18": "Changes in coronary vasomotor tone of large epicardial coronary arteries today can be assessed quite accurately by exact measurements of coronary diameters applying computer assisted systems. The effect of various vasodilators (nitrates, calcium antagonists, EDRF-dependent compounds) was tested in this way. It appears that normal coronary artery segments reach a maximum of dilator reserve with an increase of luminal diameter of approximately 30-40%; different patterns of kinetics were, however, encountered. beta-Blocking agents, both non-selective (propranolol) and selective (atenolol), were found to lead to a gradual vasoconstriction, i.e., a decrease in diameter by approximately 20-25% over 20 min, an effect which is overcome by nitrates. New beta-blocking compounds with vasodilator properties, such as celiprolol, show no constriction. The vasoconstrictor effect of propranolol and atenolol may not only be due to the decrease of flow following the drop in myocardial oxygen consumption, but could also reflect an unopposed alpha-adrenergic tone. The clinical aspects of this observation are discussed.", 
    "19": "Increased heart rate is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Elevated heart rate is due to increased sympathetic activity and/or decreased parasympathetic activity. In placebo-controlled trials beta-blockers are known to reduce mortality as well as morbidity and these effects are most evident among patients with elevated heart rate. Studies on circadian variation have demonstrated that there is an increased sympathetic activity in the morning as well as a more frequent onset of ischemic attacked including acute myocardial infarction and sudden death. There seems to be a close relationship between increased sympathetic activity and the onset of ischemic events which can be prevented by prophylactic institution of a beta-blocker.", 
    "20": "Myocardial ischemia and infarction are the most common substrates for life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that enhanced activity of the sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in the genesis of ischemia-related arrhythmias. In animal experiments, beta-blockers display significant antifibrillatory effects during the acute phase of myocardial ischemia. Preconditions for their antifibrillatory effects are high serum- and tissue-concentrations, and absence of a significant partial agonist activity. During the delayed phase of ischemic arrhythmias which starts 6-8 h after coronary occlusion, beta-blockers gain significance as antiarrhythmic and potentially antifibrillatory drugs, if sympathetic activity is enhanced. The presently available evidence suggests that the potentially antifibrillatory effects of beta-blockers are at least one of the major mechanisms by which these drugs may decrease mortality when given prophylactically in patients after myocardial infarction. However, it remains to be explained why beta-blockers, in a great number of prospective randomized trials, have reduced the incidence of sudden death only by an average of about 30%. This may be the result of their \"specific\" mechanisms acting in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia with enhanced adrenergic tone, whereas in the remaining patients other mechanisms such as a chronic arrhythmogenic substrate may be operative. A clearer separation of these various mechanisms seems mandatory in order to allow a more specific \"targeted\" administration of beta-blockers. This is the more important since none of the available prospective studies that used antiarrhythmic agents has shown an improvement of prognosis, but, instead showed a worsening of the mortality rate.", 
    "21": "156 patients with hypertension II stage according to the WHO classification and left ventricular hypertrophy proved by echocardiographic examination were treated in the course of one year with various class beta-blockers. At the end of the first month of treatment the thickness of the interventricular wall, of the posterior wall and of the left ventricular muscular mass does not change. Till the end of the 6th month the thickness of all these three decreases (p less than 0.0001). The additional decrease at the end of the 12-ve month of treatment is insignificant to that at the 6th month. The mean percentage decrease is greater by treatment with beta-blockers without inner sympathomimetic activity than with beta-blockers with such activity. There is no difference in relation to the cardioselectivity of the drug. Till the end of the 12-ve month of treatment the left ventricular muscular mass becomes normal in 35.9% of the patients on the background of normalized arterial pressure. In 6.4% of the patients the left ventricular muscular mass does not change in spite of the decrease of the arterial pressure. The percentage reduction of the left ventricular muscular mass correlates with the percentage decrease of the systolic (r = 0.603), diastolic (r = 0.457) arterial pressure and the heart rate (r = 0.636).",

Specifically, we have examined the distribution of beta-adrenoceptors in lung and the influence of age, the epithelium, respiratory viruses and inflammation associated with asthma on airway smooth muscle beta-adrenoceptor function. Sites of action, beta 2-selectivity, efficacy and tolerance are also examined in relation to the use of beta 2-agonists in man. In addition, alpha-adrenoceptor function in airway smooth muscle has been reviewed, with some emphasis on comparing observations made in airway smooth muscle with those in animal models.", 
    "23": "Patients surviving acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may experience several clinical events (reinfarction, congestive heart failure, sudden death) still responsible for high mortality rates. AMI early complicated by residual angina, left ventricular dysfunction, or malignant arrhythmias has a worse prognosis. Secondary prevention of myocardial infarction and death has been the end point of many clinical trials in the past two decades. It is well known that beta blockers prevent sudden death if administered chronically after AMI. Meta-analysis of controlled randomized trials demonstrated a significant reduction in reinfarction and vascular death with long-term antiplatelet treatment. Oral anticoagulants prevent fatal and non-fatal reinfarction and show a trend towards lower mortality rates, though treated patients have a higher incidence of haemorrhagic events, particularly stroke. Early administration of heparin gave contradictory results on short-term prevention of myocardial infarction and death after AMI. Data on long-term heparin therapy point out a significant reduction in recurrent AMI and a trend towards a decrease in general mortality.", 
    "24": "Following a 4-week placebo period, 19 patients (12 male, average age 62.3 years) with chronic stable angina pectoris and a positive exercise test were treated with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists bopindolol at increasing doses of 0.5, 1 and 2 mg, each being given once daily for 4 weeks. For the final 4 weeks of the study, active treatment was replaced by placebo. Maximum tolerated exercise (bicycle ergometry, performed 24 h after drug administration) increased dose-dependently from 519 +/- 59 s (baseline) to 758 +/- 95 s with 2 mg (p less than 0.001) and fell again to 508 +/- 48 s (placebo). The frequency of anginal attacks also fell dose-dependently from an average of 5.4 per week (baseline) to 0.5 with 2 mg (p less than 0.001) and rose again to 5.1 per week when active treatment was stopped.", 
    "25": "To assess the regression of cardiac hypertrophy during long-term (12 years) antihypertensive treatment, the following parameters were determined in 93 patients with essential hypertension: SV1 + RV5 by electrocardiography (ECG), and septal wall (SW) and posterior wall (PW) thickness by echocardiography (UCG). The patients were treated with a thiazide diuretic alone (group 1), thiazide + beta-blocker (group 2), thiazide + methyldopa or nifedipine (group 3) or nifedipine or methyldopa alone (group 4). The blood pressure decreased gradually within 6 months of treatment. According to ECG, regression of left ventricular hypertrophy occurred during the initial 7 years in all groups, whereas in the subsequent 5 years, statistically significant regression was found only in the patients treated with thiazide + other drugs (group 3). By UCG, which was taken only at the 7th and 12th year, regression was detectable during the last 5 years in all groups. The apparent incidence of regression of hypertrophy was lower in the thiazide-alone group (group 1) than in the thiazide + beta-blocker group (group 2), most likely due to mild hypertension in group 1. A cardiovascular accident (nonfatal myocardial infarction) occurred only in 1 patient. We conclude that during long-term antihypertensive treatment, persistent, progressive reversal of cardiac hypertrophy takes place.", 
    "26": "Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta blockers) are a well-established first-line treatment for hypertension, but they have been associated with unwanted symptoms including cold extremities, lethargy, and nightmares. Ketanserin is a serotonin S2-receptor antagonist that has previously been shown to reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients by reducing systemic vascular resistance. Hypertensive patients whose sitting diastolic blood pressure was greater than or equal to 95 mmHg, despite at least 4 weeks therapy with an optimal dose of beta blocker, were selected for the study. The beta-blocker dose remained constant throughout the study, but patients were randomly allocated to receive ketanserin 20 mg twice daily, ketanserin 40 mg twice daily, or bendrofluazide 5 mg each morning plus placebo at night in addition to the beta-blocker therapy. One hundred and forty two patients completed the symptom questionnaire at randomization and after 12 weeks treatment. The treatment groups were well matched for age, sex, weight, and blood pressure. Blood pressure was reduced significantly by all treatments, and there were no between-group differences. Bendrofluazide adversely affected alertness (p less than 0.05) and concentration (p less than 0.01) whereas ketanserin had no significant effect and the ketanserin 20 mg twice daily group had better concentration than the bendrofluazide group (p less than 0.05). Ketanserin treatment reduced the incidence of nightmares (p less than 0.05 for 20 mg twice daily and 40 mg twice daily) and was an improvement over bendrofluazide treatment in this respect (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The effects of isoprenaline on the release of transmitter substances from perivascular adrenergic nerves were estimated from the excitatory junction potential (ejp) and outflow of noradrenaline in the dog mesenteric vein. 2. Isoprenaline increased the ejp amplitude and decreased the evoked release of noradrenaline. Yohimbine potentiated the former and converted the latter to an increased outflow. 3. Therefore, stimulation of prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor by isoprenaline increases the release of noradrenaline from perivascular adrenergic nerves. 4. Possible involvement of prejunctional alpha-adrenoceptors in the isoprenaline-induced modulation of transmitter release was also suggested.",

    "30": "Benzodiazepines are commonly encountered in both psychiatric and chemical dependency treatment settings. However, in the chemical dependency setting, benzodiazepines are most frequently used as secondary drugs of abuse, and are most often found within a polydrug use pattern. Benzodiazepine use by the drug-abusing population consists of the combined use of benzodiazepines with other psychoactive drugs. They are used to medicate cocaine toxicity, as a secondary or tertiary drug to boost the effects of alcohol or heroin, and by those who have developed tolerance and dependence to sedative-hypnotic drugs. The presence of an anxiety disorder, a family history of addiction, or benzodiazepine polydrug use will significantly affect the type of withdrawal a patient will experience and its treatment course.

Adrenaline (0.25-1 microgram/kg), noradrenaline (0.125-0.5 microgram/kg) and dopamine (25-100 micrograms/kg) given in the conscious dog with chronic atrio-ventricular block after beta-adrenoceptor blockade, increased ventricular cycle length (VCL) and mean blood pressure (MBP). 2. Atropine (muscarinic receptor blocker) reduced the catecholamine-induced effects on VCL without modifying their hypertensive effects. 3. Phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine (alpha-adrenoceptor blockers) only decreased the effects of adrenaline on VCL but suppressed those of noradrenaline and dopamine. They only reduced the effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline on MBP, but reversed that of dopamine. 4. Yohimbine (alpha-adrenoceptor blocker) suppressed the catecholamine-induced effects on VCL, and reduced strongly the hypertensive effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline and reversed that of dopamine. 5. Thus, these results show the existence of negative chronotropic postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors in the ventricles.",

A high concentration of (+)- and (-)-propranolol, 10(-5) M, also inhibited the maximal combined response to electrical stimulation and isoprenaline. 3.

Clinical examination and blood tests were performed before and 12 weeks after withdrawal of beta-adrenoceptor-blockade, which had lasted for an average of 3 y. No effect was found on blood pressure. There was a significant increase in heart rate of 12%. Total cholesterol declined by 9%, high density lipoprotein (HDL-cholesterol) increased by 12%, and triglycerides decreased by 6%. The triglyceride dependent factors, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and factor VII-phospholipid complex, were not affected.",

There was wide inter-individual variability in peak plasma ICI 141,292 concentrations (Cmax) but no significant difference was found between mean Cmax after a single dose (44.3 ng.ml-1) and after 12 doses (37.4 ng.ml-1). The mean observed time to peak plasma ICI 141,292 concentration (tmax) after a single dose (1.61 h) did not differ significantly from that after 12 doses (1.75 h). On several occasions an analytically significant second peak in ICI 141,292 plasma concentration was observed. Following the peak(s), the plasma concentrations declined biphasically and a mean terminal phase plasma half-life (t1/2) of 28.3 (range 10.2-84.8) h was calculated after a single dose. The inter-individual variability in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve to 24 h AUC (0-24) was 54 fold but there was no significant difference between AUC (0-24) after a single dose (mean 226.0 ng.h.ml-1) and AUC (0-24) after 12 consecutive doses of ICI 141,292 (mean 232.4 ng.h.ml-1). The results show that consecutive daily administration of 12 oral doses of ICI 141,292 (200 mg) does not result in significant accumulation of drug in elderly subjects with moderate renal impairment.", 
    "35": "The selective 5-HT1A receptor ligand ipsapirone (IPS) caused dose-related hypothermia in humans. The response was attenuated by the nonselective 5-HT1/2 receptor antagonist metergoline and was completely antagonized by the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist pindolol, which interacts stereoselectively with the 5-HT1A receptor. The selective beta 1-adrenergic antagonist betaxolol had no effect. The findings indicate that IPS-induced hypothermia specifically involves activation of (presynaptic) 5-HT1A receptors. Therefore, the hypothermic response to IPS may provide a convenient in vivo paradigma to assess the function of the presynaptic 5-HT receptor in affective disorders and its involvement in the effects of psychotropic drugs.",

In experiments with dog heart ex vivo, the rise in the cardiac rate associated with an increase in dP/dtmax and left ventricular pressure (LVP) correlated with changes in the beta-adrenoceptor densities as measured by the binding of 3H-Dihydroalprenolol (DHA). A significant change in the beta-adrenoceptor densities was observed when cryptosin was incubated with guinea pig and dog heart sarcolemmal membranes in vitro. Analysis of the binding of 3H-DHA in post-cryptosin treated membranes indicated a non-specific type of interaction of cryptosin with mammalian cardiac beta-adrenoceptors.",

    "38": "It has been shown that a paradoxical pressor response to a beta-blocker occurs in rats given an alpha-blocker. The dual-isotope microsphere technique was used to investigate the hemodynamic changes that accompany the pressor response to propranolol in phentolamine-treated, urethane-anesthetized rats. Rats were divided into four groups (n = 8 per group): group I received 10 min of saline infusion; group II received intravenous infusion of phentolamine (300 micrograms/kg/min) for 10 min; group III received intravenous injection of propranolol (100 micrograms/kg) after 20 min of phentolamine infusion, and group IV received intravenous injection of saline after 20 min of phentolamine infusion. In groups I and IV, saline did not cause any significant hemodynamic changes. In group II, phentolamine decreased the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) by 34 +/- 3 mm Hg and 0.28 +/- 0.07 mm Hg/min/ml, respectively. Arterial conductances in the skeletal muscle and skin were increased to 157 and 165% of control values, respectively. Cardiac output and conductances in other tissues and organs were not significantly affected. In rats given phentolamine (group III), propranolol raised MAP (+40 +/- 2 mm Hg) by increasing TPR (+0.41 +/- 0.03 mm Hg/min/ml). Vascular conductances in the skeletal muscle, skin and kidneys were decreased to 38, 57 and 69% of control values, respectively. Conductances in other tissues and organs were not significantly affected. Our results show that propranolol raised MAP by increasing flow resistance, primarily via the reversal of the vasodilator effects of phentolamine in the muscle and skin.", 
    "39": "Since exogenous dopamine is commonly used to treat patients of cardiovascular failure, its action on the histamine-sensitized airways is critical for asthmatic subjects. In this study, in vitro canine airway smooth muscle preparation were employed to investigate whether histamine-treatment affects the responsiveness of airway smooth muscle to dopamine. The results of our study demonstrate that, at dopamine tachyphylaxis of canine tracheal smooth muscle, histamine treatment could recover the contraction to dopamine. In the muscle strips sensitized with histamine, the dopamine-induced contraction was decreased by the antagonist to alpha 2-adrenoceptors and increased by the antagonist to beta 1-adrenoceptors. It is concluded that histamine can modulate the dopamine response of canine tracheal smooth muscle by sensitizing, transiently, multiple receptors in the muscle which are responsible for the contractile response to dopamine.", 
    "40": "1. Acute myocardial ischaemia provokes sensitization of the adenylate cyclase system. This sensitization could be differentiated in a receptor-linked and an enzyme-linked sensitization. The increase in the number of beta-adrenoceptors in the plasma membranes was observed already after 15 min of global ischaemia (50 +/- 2 to 67 +/- 6 fmol mg-1 protein) and persisted after 50 min of ischaemia. The maximally isoprenaline-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity rose from 66 +/- 7 to 100 +/- 10 pmol cAMP min-1 mg-1 protein after 15 min of global ischaemia indicating the receptor-mediated sensitization of the beta-adrenergic system. However, after 50 min of ischaemia the isoprenaline-stimulated adenylate cyclase was reduced by about 50% despite the continuous increase of beta-adrenoceptors in the plasma membranes. 2. Additionally direct stimulation of the adenylate cyclase by forskolin revealed an increased enzyme activity after 15 min of global ischaemia (300 +/- 20 vs 378 +/- 25 pmol cAMP min-1 mg-1). Prolonged periods of ischaemia, however, caused a decline of the total adenylate cyclase activity (232 +/- 24 pmol cAMP min-1 mg-1 protein). This demonstrates an enzyme-specific sensitization of the adenylate cyclase, which in contrast to the rise in beta-adrenoceptors is only transient. This enzyme-specific sensitization or the late inactivation of the enzyme occur independently of receptor activation and cannot be prevented by beta-adrenoceptor blockade (10(-6) M alprenolol) prior to the ischaemic insult.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "In 21 patients undergoing open heart surgery the effects of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol and sotalol and the calcium antagonist nifedipine (alone or in combination) on right atrial beta-adrenoceptor density and G protein expression were studied. The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists increased both right atrial beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor density; this increase was not affected by nifedipine. There was no correlation between beta-adrenoceptor density and expression of the G protein subunit Gs alpha suggesting independent regulation of the gene expression for G proteins and their coupled receptors.", 
    "42": "In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting chronic beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist treatment increased right atrial beta 1-adrenoceptor number, did not affect beta 2-adrenoceptor number and decreased muscarinic M2-receptor number. Concomitantly, the M2-receptor-mediated negative inotropic effect of carbachol was reduced, while the beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated positive inotropic effect of noradrenaline was not altered. The beta 2- adrenoceptor mediated positive inotropic effect of procaterol, however, was markedly enhanced. We conclude that chronic beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist treatment increases beta 1-adrenoceptor number, sensitizes beta 2-adrenoceptor function and desensitizes M2-receptor function in the human heart.", 
    "43": "The purpose of the study was in comparison of drug use in the treatment of coronary disease or hypertension in the random selected representative population sample of Warsaw and Tarnobrzeg province . In the study women and men aged 35 to 64 years were included according to POL-MONICA studies. Among 2646 subjects studied in Warsaw 23% used drugs whereas among 2722 subjects from the Tarnobrzeg province the drug users represented 12.1%. The most frequently used drugs in the treatment of coronary disease were nitrates, curantyl and beta-blockers. The drug use in subjects with coronary disease (DDD/1000 inhabitants/day) was 4.5-fold higher in Warsaw than in the Tarnobrzeg province . The most frequently drug used in treatment of hypertension in Warsaw were beta-blockers and diuretics, whereas in the Tarnobrzeg province among men diuretic and composed drug preparations; women in the last region used frequently composed drug preparations and smooth muscle relaxants. The relationship between the use of particular drug groups and the region was significant in women. The hypotensic drug use in Warsaw was twice as high as in the Tarnobrzeg voivodship despite similar frequency of hypertension in both regions.", 
    "44": "The aim of these studies was to determine whether phosphodiesterase inhibition by enoximone is able to regulate differentially beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor (AR)-mediated inotropic effects. Strips of human right atrial myocardium were stimulated with noradrenaline plus ICI 118,551 (selective beta 1-AR stimulation) or adrenaline plus CGP 20,712A (selective beta 2-AR stimulation). Concentration-effect curves were determined in the absence or presence of enoximone. Enoximone alone was shown to produce dose-related positive inotropic effects. In tissues from beta 1-blocker-treated patients, enoximone potentiated the responses to both beta 1-AR and beta 2-AR stimulation. There was a fall in -log EC50 (mol/l) of 0.7 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- SEM; n = 6) for beta 1-AR stimulation and of 0.6 +/- 0.1 (n = 10) for beta 2-AR stimulation. The potentiation of beta 2-AR responses in non-beta-blocker-treated patients was similar with a fall in -log EC50 (mol/l) of 0.5 +/- 0.1 (n = 6). The extent of potentiation was not significantly different between beta 1-AR and beta 2-AR stimulation, nor between beta 1-blocker-treated patients and non-beta-blocker-treated patients. Further experiments showed that the potentiation by enoximone of the effects of catecholamines was unaltered by diazoxide (n = 6). Enoximone thus causes positive inotropic effects and potentiates the effects of catecholamines acting through both beta 1- and beta 2-AR. These actions are consistent with inhibition of cyclic AMP hydrolysis. The potentiation of the effects of catecholamines by phosphodiesterase inhibition appears unaltered by prior patient therapy with beta 1 blockers.", 
    "45": "The properties of beta-adrenoceptors present on the cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells were studied by radioligand binding. These cell contain a high density of beta-adrenoceptors (approximately 16,000 receptors/cell) having high affinity (Kd 18 pM) for 125I-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP). Competition binding experiments suggested the presence of more than two subtype of beta-adrenoceptors. 25% of the total population of receptors was found to be of beta 1-type. The remaining 75% represented a mixed population containing what is suggested to be a mixture of beta 2- and atypical beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "46": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that changes in right ventricular pressure (PRV) are responsible in part for the altered breathing frequency (f) during pulmonary gas embolism (PGE). PGE was induced by infusing air into the femoral vein of alpha-chloralose anesthetized dogs. Respiratory flow pattern was recorded and analyzed in relation to PRV changes induced resulting from PGE. The rise of PRV, whether induced by PGE, by pulmonary artery occlusion, or by acute elevation of pulmonary arterial blood flow, was consistently associated with increased f. Breathing frequency rose principally through reduction of expiratory duration (TE). The inspiratory duration (TI) was shortened somewhat and the fractional inspiratory cycle, TI/(TE + TI), increased. The relationships between PRV and f were altered by changes of PRV resulting from the administration of histamine antagonist, by beta-adrenergic blockade, beta-adrenergic stimulation, and by changing pulmonary arterial blood flow. The responses did not occur after bilateral cervical vagotomy. These results demonstrate that f during PGE is partially regulated in response to changes in PRV and is mediated through the vagal afferent.", 
    "47": "Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) could improve mean arterial pressure (MAP), myocardial contractile parameters (+/- dp/dtmax, Vpm and Vmax) and increase plasma epinephrine level significantly at 10 min after TRH administration in hemorrhagic shock rabbits, but the action of TRH on MAP and the myocardial contractility did not appear in rabbits pre-treated with reserpine (4 mg/kg, 24 h pre-treatment, i.v.). TRH had no effects on myocardial contractility and MAP at 20 and 30 min after administration to rabbits pre-treated with beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol (1 mg/kg, 1 h before TRH injection i.v.), but it did exert effects on these parameters in rabbits pre-treated with alpha-adrenergic blocker phenoxybenzamine. Experiments in vitro showed that, although TRH (10(-4) M/L) had no direct effect on heart, left atrium and aortic strip, it did potentiate the inotropic effects of isoprenaline and dopamine on the left atrium. These results suggested that antishock effect of TRH is related to adrenergic system. TRH stimulates sympathomedullary system to secrete epinephrine and sensitize the beta-receptors, but not alpha-receptors. Thus, TRH improves cardiac contractility, cardiac output and hemodynamics during hemorrhagic shock. The sensitization of the beta- and dopamine receptors played an important role in producing direct peripheral actions of TRH.", 
    "48": "The effects of prolonged (21 day) oral administration of the antidepressants paroxetine (0.9 to 8.9 mg/kg/day) and amitriptyline (2.7 to 27 mg/kg/day), on rat brain cortical beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor numbers and affinities were investigated using [3H]-CGP 12177. Although amitriptyline, 27 mg/kg, caused a significant (p less than 0.05) 20% reduction in the number of beta 1-adrenoceptors, paroxetine, at doses up to 8.9 mg/kg p.o., did not influence binding of [3H]-CGP 12177 to cortical beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptors. This study with paroxetine provides further evidence that the down-regulation of central beta 1-adrenoceptors in rat brain after repeated administration is not a property of all antidepressant drugs.", 
    "49": "Catecholamines play an essential role in the activation of the cardiovascular system and in the regulation of energy metabolism in a variety of physiological conditions. Many of these effects are mediated through beta-adrenoceptors located on cell membranes. Binding of catecholamines to beta-adrenoceptor increases the concentration of intracellular cyclic AMP which in turn activates protein kinase A. This enzyme phosphorylates a number of other intracellular enzymes influencing cell metabolism and functions. The primary structures of the receptor and its topography in the cell membrane as well as its binding domains have been partially clarified. In studies of the human beta-adrenergic receptors blood lymphocytes have mostly been used as model cells. These cells carry receptors of mainly the beta 2-subtype. The adequacy of this model system has been demonstrated in several studies. In clinical work receptor assays have had limited use until now. However, studies on the pathophysiology of the adrenergic system in several diseases have revealed that receptor alterations may constitute an important factor in the disease process. Measurements of adrenergic receptors may also have increasing usefulness in determining optimal drug concentrations. Our own studies have primarily focused on physiological adjustments in the beta-adrenergic system during acute or prolonged physical exercise as well as receptor changes in heart failure, muscle diseases and the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. We have also explored receptor dynamics during therapy with beta-blocking agents. These studies, briefly reviewed in this communication, have led to the following conclusions: (1) High aerobic capacity is associated with an increased density and ability of lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptors to respond to catecholamines. (2) Both short-and long-term physical exercise induce a rapid up-regulation and more effective functioning of lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptors. (3) Administration of beta-blocking drugs is associated with a subnormal exercise-induced up-regulation and decreased functioning of the lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptors. (4) The exercise-provoked up-regulation and improved functioning of beta-adrenoceptors is blunted in heart failure patients. (5) Patients with Duchenne-type of muscular dystrophy have a reduced number of lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptors. (6) In chronic alcoholics the lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptor level is subnormal but during abrupt ethanol withdrawal a rapid increase in the number and functioning of the receptors to a normal level takes place. This sequence of events may lead to a condition of relative adrenergic hypersensitivity.", 
    "50": "Nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers have been reported to affect endothelium-dependent responses in isolated blood vessels in the following ways: (a) cause endothelium-augmented direct relaxations; (b) facilitate the endothelium-dependent relaxations evoked by alpha 2-adrenergic activation, or by acetylcholine; (c) augment the intraluminal release of vasodilator prostanoids, and (d) inhibit endothelium-dependent contractions to anoxia. Important species differences exist in terms of the endothelium-dependent effects of the compounds. If they were to occur in the intact organism, the endothelium-dependent effects of the beta-adrenergic blockers could help to explain their vasodilator properties.", 
    "51": "Hippocampal tissue transplanted into the anterior chamber of the eye offers a unique system in which development can be studied in the absence of the noradrenergic innervation. This system was used to determine the extent to which noradrenergic innervation regulates the development of adrenergic receptors. In addition to examining single denervated transplants, transplants grown with innervation from the superior cervical ganglia of the host rat or from locus coeruleus cotransplants were also examined to determine whether the source of norepinephrine and extent of innervation in oculo regulate the development and density of adrenergic receptors. In vitro autoradiographic analysis of ligand binding to both alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors with 125I-BE 2254 and 125I-pindolol, respectively, was used to characterize adrenergic receptors in the intraocular transplants. Quantitative analysis of the receptors showed an up-regulation of both alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors in tissue grown in the absence of norepinephrine, but in general there was not a high degree of correlation between norepinephrine content and receptor density. Although high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of catecholamines revealed higher than normal amounts of norepinephrine in hippocampal transplants innervated by the superior cervical ganglia or a locus coeruleus cotransplant, the density of alpha 1 and beta receptors was quite comparable with values found in the literature for normal adult hippocampus. These results suggest that the relationship between receptor number and density of innervation may differ significantly from what is observed in response to pharmacological manipulation of norepinephrine systems in the adult brain.", 
    "52": "The past decade saw the emergence of sclerotherapy and vasoactive pharmacologic agents as alternatives to surgery in the prevention and treatment of variceal haemorrhage. Despite encouraging results from clinical trials with regard to the prevention of rebleeding, these modalities of therapy have made no major impact on survival. This failure to alter radically the clinical outcome results from the fact that in many patients with cirrhosis death is primarily related to the degree of hepatic decompensation rather than the prevention or control of variceal bleeding. Advances in our knowledge of vasoactive mediators, receptor function, and altered vascular reactivity have provided increased insight into the circulatory disturbances that characterise cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Earlier and more aggressive pharmacologic intervention with single or combination drug therapy may inhibit fibrogenesis, reduce portal vascular resistance, and improve liver function and therefore provide effective prophylaxis against variceal haemorrhage. The emergence of reliable prognostic indices for variceal bleeding should help identify patients at risk who would benefit from prophylaxis with either drugs or sclerotherapy. Transplantation will be increasingly considered in the patient at high risk of recurrent bleeding before the stage of severe hepatic decompensation (the risks of the transplant then become very much greater), as the definitive means for reducing mortality in cirrhosis and portal hypertension.", 
    "53": "beta-Adrenergic receptors on isolated human lymphocytes were enumerated using 125I-cyanopindolol (125I-CYP), after a 90-min exposure to 50 mumols/l l-isoproterenol in vitro. No change in receptor density could be shown in assays performed at 37 degrees C, although a 40% reduction was apparent in binding studies carried out at 4 degrees C. In contrast, beta-adrenergic receptors on lymphocytes from mild asthmatics after a 3-week course of oral terbutaline showed a 40% reduction in receptor density regardless of the assay temperature, in addition to a 2.5-fold reduction in the receptor affinity for isoproterenol. The data are consistent with reports that a fraction of receptors are sequestered during short-term exposure to agonists. Sequestered receptors may or may not be detected by radioligand binding assays depending on the ligand of choice, temperature of the binding assay and duration of prior exposure to the agonist. After extended exposure to an agonist in vivo, the number of surface receptors was reduced, and sequestered receptors were not present, presumably as a result of degradation.", 
    "54": "A randomized, double blind clinical trial included 40 hypertension patients of both sexes, aged 18-70 years, with diastolic blood pressure persistently above 100 (13.33 kPa) and below 120 mm Hg (15.99 kPa). After a run-in period on placebo, one half of them was treated with bopindolol (single daily dose 1-3 mg), and the other half with metoprolol (100-300 mg daily in two divided doses). After 4 weeks of formal trial both beta blockaders had significantly decreased the elevated arterial pressure, e.g. the mean arterial pressure in the bopindolol group dropped from an average of 129.1 +/- 6.9 (17.20 +/- 0.92) to 111.6 +/- 6.1 mm Hg (14.87 +/- 0.81 kPa) or by 13.6% and in the metoprolol group from 129.8 +/- 7.1 (17.30 +/- 0.94 kPa) to 114.5 +/- 6.4 mm Hg (15.26 +/- 0.85 kPa) or by 11.8% (p less than 0.02). After 12 weeks the mean pressure was ulteriorly lowered to some 104.3 mm Hg (13.90 kPa) on bopindolol and to some 106.0 mm Hg (14.12 kPa) on metoprolol. The heart rate was expectedly slowed down, from an average of 95 to 69 b.p.m. with bopindolol (27.4% decrease, p less than 0.001) and from 99 to 67 b.p.m. with metoprolol (32.3% decrease, p less than 0.001). The other parameters, including the laboratory results did not change appreciably during this study. Clinically relevant side-effects were not registered, and the observed between-group differences did not reach the level of statistical significance. It is concluded that bopindolol and metoprolol are beta-adrenergic blockaders of comparable antihypertensive efficacy.", 
    "55": "A double-blind cross-over study was carried out on 15 glaucoma patients so as to verify the effects of three the beta blockers, beta-1 selective betaxolol, non-selective timolol and befunolol an agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity on the heart rate, monitored by a Holter apparatus, and with the blood pressure measured in standing and supine positions before and after eight days of topical therapy. The results showed that timolol induced a significant decrease in minimum heart rate (-4.2 +/- 2.9) (p less than 0.001) and in diastolic blood pressure in standing position (-8.0 +/- 12.5 mmHg) (p less than 0.05), betaxolol decreased systolic pressure in orthostatism (-7.5 +/- 12.3 mmHg) and in clinostatism (-12.1 +/- 16.2 mmHg) and diastolic pressure in orthostatism (-6.25 +/- 9.4 mmHg) (p less than 0.05). Befunolol alone did not alter the heart rate or blood pressure.", 
    "56": "Peripheral sympathetic nerve terminals in many tissues, but not all, are endowed with beta-adrenoceptors. Activation of these result in an enhancement of noradrenaline release evoked by electrical nerve stimulation. These so-called presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors are possibly located on the outer surface of the varicosity of the noradrenergic nerves. A postsynaptic location, however, is also a possibility. The presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors appear to be of the beta 2-adrenoceptor subtype. However, specific classification is lacking. The stereospecificity of the beta-adrenoceptors is controversial. These receptors are not activated by noradrenaline released from sympathetic nerves. Adrenaline derived from the adrenal medulla may be the physiological activator. Either circulating adrenaline or adrenaline taken up by sympathetic nerve terminals and then released as a cotransmitter with noradrenaline activates the presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors. In the latter case, a \"positive\" feedback\" loop may be formed.", 
    "57": "Experimental animal studies have demonstrated a number of receptor localizations on specific cortical afferents and neurons. The present study of human posterior cingulate cortex evaluates the laminar distributions of particular receptors and their likely association with components of the neuropil. Coverslip autoradiographic and single grain counting techniques were used followed by heterogeneity analysis in which the layer of peak binding and an index of heterogeneity were determined for each ligand. The index was calculated by determining specific binding by layer as a percentage of binding in all layers. The differences from an absolutely homogeneous distribution, i.e. 11.1% for each of nine layers, were subtracted and the absolute laminar differences summed to form the index. High indices of over 15 reflected heterogeneous binding patterns in neocortex. The binding of ligands for muscarinic acetylcholine, serotonin, opioid, GABA and beta adrenoceptors was evaluated. Pirenzepine binding peaked in layer II of area 23a but was extremely homogeneous with an index of heterogeneity of 8.9. In contrast, oxotremorine-M binding had a peak in layer IIIc and an index of 16.4, while AF-DX 116 binding peaked in layer IIIa-b and had an index of 30.6. Of the ligands for serotonin uptake and receptor binding paroxetine binding was evenly distributed in layers I-III and had a low index of heterogeneity of 9.8. Ketanserin binding was also homogeneous and, since it had an index of 8.9, this pattern was virtually the same as that for paroxetine. In contrast, serotonin and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin binding peaked in layer II and had very high indices of 20.8 and 50.3, respectively, suggesting only a limited association with that of the paroxetine distribution. Finally, there were three layers which contained peaks in binding for ligands for opioid, GABA and beta adrenoceptors. Firstly, layer Ia had peak dynorphin-A binding, the latter of which had an index of 22.6. Secondly, Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol and 2-D-penicillamine-5-D-penicillamine-enkephalin binding peaked in layer II and had indices of 8.6 and 17.4, respectively. Thirdly, muscimol and (-)-cyanopindolol binding peaked in layer IIIa-b and had indices of 29.6 and 11.1, respectively. When viewed in the context of experimental animal studies, it is likely that heterogeneities in oxotremorine-M and paroxetine binding are associated with the termination of the thalamic and raphe nuclei, respectively. While serotonin 2 receptors are co-distributed with serotonin uptake sites, serotonin 1A receptors have a significant mismatch with these sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "58": "We have recently assigned a major stimulatory role to the brain catecholamines (CA) via alpha 1 and beta receptors on CRH-ACTH secretion, e.g. in the physiological response to stress. In the present study, we explored the possible participation in this regulation of post-synaptic alpha 2 receptors in free moving rats, one week after CA denervation of the hypothalamus by bilateral neurotoxic lesions of the noradrenergic ascending brain stem bundles (NAB). Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of clonidine (alpha 2 agonist; 1 nmol) induced a 3 fold rise of ACTH release (measured by RIA) above vehicle (PBS) injected controls (p less than 0.001). This stimulatory effect was completely reversed by an i.c.v. pretreatment with the alpha 2 antagonist idazoxan (10 nmol; without action by itself), whereas it was only slightly affected by an i.c.v. pretreatment with a combination of an alpha 1 and beta blocker (prazosin + propranolol; 5/5 nmol; p greater than 0.1). The results strongly suggest the participation of alpha 2 post-synaptic receptors in the central catecholaminergic activation of ACTH secretion.", 
    "59": "Nitrogen balance was studied in 5 bulls fed a concentrated diet containing 0 or 4 ppm cimaterol. Cimaterol increased nitrogen retention, mainly by reducing urinary nitrogen excretion due to decreased body protein degradation. There was a tendency for reduced nitrogen utilization efficiency when treatment was prolonged.", 
    "60": "Intrahippocampal cell suspension grafts, prepared from the locus coeruleus region of rat fetuses, have previously been shown to retard seizure development in rats made hypersensitive to hippocampal kindling by a lesion of the forebrain noradrenergic system. The objective of the present study was to provide evidence that the seizure-suppressant effect elicited by the grafts is mediated via noradrenergic mechanisms. Two groups of rats received 6-hydroxydopamine in the lateral ventricle and then bilateral intrahippocampal locus coeruleus grafts. After 3 months, the grafted animals and a group of normal rats were subjected to hippocampal kindling. One group of grafted animals and the normal rats were injected intraperitoneally with the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor blocker idazoxan before each kindling stimulation. The other grafted rats received vehicle injections. The development of seizures was significantly faster in the grafted and normal rats that had been given idazoxan than in the grafted rats that had not been subjected to alpha-2 receptor blockade. Our data suggest that the seizure-suppressant action exerted by grafts of fetal locus coeruleus in hippocampal kindling is mediated via noradrenergic mechanisms, most likely via activation of postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoreceptors.", 
    "61": "Beta blockers inhibit corneal re-epithelialization. This may be due to beta-2 receptor controlled mechanisms. To investigate this possibility we performed a randomized, double-masked study involving 60 rabbit iatrogenic induced corneal ulcers produced with iodine vapour. Two beta specific drug compounds were tested, namely, betaxolol hydrochloride 0.25% (Alcon) (beta 1) and L132-468 (Sandoz, Basel) 0.25% (beta 2), and phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) as control. There was no statistical difference in the wound healing rates among all groups at 24 hours but there were significant differences at 48 hours (p less than 0.01). At 72 hours, the L132-468 treated groups showed significantly less healing than the betaxolol hydrochloride treated group. The PBS-treated group was healed at this time. By 20th post burning day, SEM revealed that betaxolol hydrochloride treated corneas were completely healed with normal epithelial microvilli. The L132-468 treated corneas were also healed but desquamation and abnormal cells were observed. In conclusion, beta-2 blockers inhibit corneal re-epithelialization more potently than beta-1 blockers.", 
    "62": "The paper examines the effect of different adrenergic agents influencing both the neuronal unit of the adrenergic transmitter system and its alpha- and beta-receptor components on the ADP-induced platelet aggregation. A considerable inhibition of the platelet aggregation is found under conditions of post-reserpine adrenergic block (16.06%, p less than 0.001) and blocking of the beta 1-adrenergic receptors with practolol, applied independently (45.06%, p less than 0.001) and prior to the treatment of the rats with dobutamine--beta 1-adrenoreceptor agonist (52.20%, p less than 0.001). The stimulation of these receptors with dobutamine accelerates the platelet aggregation by 41.04% (p less than 0.001). No changes in the platelet aggregation are found after treatment with phenoxybenzamine (nonselective alpha adrenergic blocker) and salbutamol (beta 2-adrenergic agonist). It may be concluded that the ADP-induced platelet aggregation depends to a certain extent on the functional state of the neuronal and beta-adrenoreceptor unit of the adrenergic transmitter system and possibly also on the metabolic processes connected with them.", 
    "63": "Long-term glycaemic control measured by glycosylated haemoglobin concentration was compared in hypertensive NIDD's taking placebo, alpha-blockers, beta-blockers (alone and in combination) and an ACE inhibitor (enalapril) each for 4 months. Alpha-blockade caused no deterioration in long-term glycaemic control in NIDD's. Beta-blockers caused a deterioration in glycaemic control in NIDD's (with some adverse effects on lipid profile). This was especially apparent with the lipophilic beta-blocker P. Concurrent use of an alpha-blocker with a beta-blocker prevents the deterioration due to beta-blockade. The ACE inhibitor, enalapril caused an improvement in long-term glycaemic control without alteration of lipid control in NIDD's.", 
    "64": "A prospective population study of women in Gothenburg, Sweden, showed an increased risk of developing diabetes in women taking diuretics or beta-blockers as antihypertensive agents compared to other women. The risk seemed to be still higher, if the combination of diuretics and beta-blockers was used. The same observation was made also when the study was confined to hypertensive women indicating that not only the hypertensive state but also the antihypertensive drugs per se may be a risk factor for developing diabetes. This possibility is further strengthened by the fact that, as far as diabetes type II is concerned, the hypertensive state in most cases precedes the development of diabetes, while only few subjects with diabetes type II develop arterial hypertension. We could only study the possible diabetic effect of diuretics and beta-blockers. It must, however, be of great interest to study alpha-blockers, calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors in the same way. If one or more of these new substances will prove not to be diabetogenic, this will be a very important factor in our choice of first drug in the treatment of arterial hypertension.", 
    "65": "Non-selective and to a lesser extent selective beta-blockers are known to slightly deteriorate glucose metabolism. This may be of clinical relevance, since patients with essential hypertension suffer from reduced insulin-sensitivity and some studies showed an increased incidence of diabetes type II with beta-blocker-treated hypertensive patients. However, it is not clear whether this effect is due to hypertension per se or in addition by antihypertensive treatment. The possible mechanisms by which beta-blockers influence carbohydrate metabolism are discussed. Insulin secretion is inhibited by beta-blockers in vitro. However, no effect is seen in vivo in man. Hepatic glucose production in theory may be influenced, but no effect is demonstrable. Muscular glucose uptake could be reduced; some data exist showing reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity, although there are controversial results. In conclusion, a deterioration of carbohydrate metabolism by beta-blockers is established, the mechanism whereby remains obscure.", 
    "66": "The treatment of hypertension has been associated with a reduction of stroke by nearly a half but with little or no effect on the incidence of heart attack. Hypotheses to account for this discrepancy include the short duration of the trials, the differential effects on initial subsets according to age, sex and smoking status, the adverse effects of antihypertensive agents, the excessive lowering hypothesis and the common causal link hypothesis. Each of these hypotheses is examined in this paper.", 
    "67": "This paper deals with some changes at the cardiac and aortic levels observed in normotensive rats and in hypertensive rats and turkeys by using two different beta-blockers, namely propranolol and oxprenolol. Chronic treatment with propranolol induced in the heart of normotensive rats a shift in the ventricular myosin pattern toward the \"slow\" V2 and V3 isoforms which are characterized by a reduced oxygen consumption. Oxprenolol treatment did not modify the blood pressure levels in the renal hypertensive rats nor in the spontaneously hypertensive turkeys. Nevertheless, in both experimental models a substantial modification of the media and intima, respectively, took place. In untreated hypertensive and normal rats the thickness of the aortic media was significantly higher than that of the treated ones, therefore suggesting a direct effect of oxprenolol on the smooth muscle cells of the aortic media. In the spontaneously hypertensive turkeys the atherosclerotic plaques appeared to be more frequent and thicker than those found in the oxprenolol-treated animals. These two experiments demonstrate that beta-blockers can prevent the development of hypertrophy of the media and decrease both the incidence and severity of intimal proliferations independently of blood pressure control. It therefore appears that the well-known myocardial protective effect played by beta-blockers, which mainly consists of a reduced myocardial oxygen consumption, is certainly obtained by reducing blood pressure and heart rate but also by changing the contractile protein pattern. In addition, an indirect myocardial protective effect could be exerted by beta-blockers at the vascular level by preventing medial hypertrophy and the development of atherosclerosis.", 
    "68": "Theoretical and experimental data coupled with findings from several studies, showing the beneficial effect of beta-blocking therapy in reducing the risk of death and re-infarction among infarct patients (secondary cardioprotection), suggested that beta-blockers could reduce the incidence of coronary events also in hypertensive patients with no clinical evidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (primary cardioprotection). In order to evaluate the primary cardioprotective potential of beta-blockers as compared to diuretics in the treatment of hypertension, some large-scale, randomized, prospective studies were set up in the middle and late 1970s. The results of three of these trials, the MRC, the IPPPSH and the HAPPHY studies, were negative or non-conclusive and somehow conflicting. None of them showed any difference between beta-blockers and diuretics in reducing the incidence of CHD, but the MRC and the IPPPSH studies suggested that beta-blockers were better than diuretics in male non-smokers. However, the HAPPHY study did not confirm such a hypothesis. More recently, two studies, the Clatterbridge study (retrospective, non-controlled) and the MAPHY study (prospective, controlled) gave positive results about the primary cardioprotective effect of beta-blockers. In particular, the MAPHY study demonstrated that starting antihypertensive treatment with the beta1-selective beta-blocker metoprolol instead of a thiazide diuretic led to lower total and cardiovascular mortality, mainly by reducing fatal CHD and fatal stroke. Although more evidence is needed, the primary cardioprotective effect demonstrated with metoprolol in the MAPHY study might have important implications for clinical practice and public health.", 
    "69": "The diverse effects of the catecholamines (CA) epinephine and norepinephrine are mediated by a family of specific receptors (adrenergic receptors, AR). The beta-AR is a glycoprotein present in the membrane of a number of cell types. This receptor is closely associated with at least two other proteins (Gs and adenylate cyclase enzyme, AC) to form the beta-AR complex. The beta-AR recognizes the CA and is coupled to Gs which stimulates the effector enzyme AC. This enzyme converts ATP to cAMP and is the effector of the beta-AR complex. Thus the beta-AR is a G-coupled receptor which acts by raising intracellular levels of cAMP. The beta-AR is an important site of regulatory modifications through a variety of mechanisms. The best characterized is known as homologous desensitization: when the receptor is exposed to repeated stimulus by the agonist (CA), its responsiveness wanes, probably to compensate this potentially dangerous overstimulation. The gene for mammalian beta2-AR has been recently cloned and the predicted amino-acid sequence now opens the field to identification of the protein structures involved in receptor functions. The beta2-AR protein is characterized by the presence of seven membrane spanning regions. Study of the structure, function and regulation of the beta-AR will extend our knowledge of the role of beta-AR in pathological conditions and suggest new therapeutic approaches.", 
    "70": "Mouse erythroblastoma cells were used as a model system to study sensitivity and regulation of the beta-adrenergic system during DMSO-induced differentiation from the proerythroblast to the normoblast stage. Differentiation was characterized by a initial marked increase in hormonal sensitivity lasting 24 to 40 h followed by a gradual loss of beta-adrenergic responsiveness. These changes are mainly due to a rapid but transient increase in receptor density (4 fold) and a marked shift of the membrane concentrations of the transmembrane signalling proteins Gs and Gi. The Gs to Gi ratio changed from 1:7 in native MEL cells to 2:1 in differentiated cells. By contrast, fusion experiments between rat reticulocytes and and MEL cells indicated that cytosolic factors, while not prominently involved in the regulation of the beta-adrenergic system of differentiating MEL cells, may be responsible for the rapid loss of cyclase activity during reticulocyte maturation, the last step in red cell formation.", 
    "71": "Radioligand binding studies have been developed to determine pharmacologic receptor characteristics in vitro. With this assay, not only the number and dissociation constant (KD) can be studied, but also the interaction of agonists with the receptor. We used this method to study a new beta 2-sympathicomimetic drug, tulobuterol (1-(0-chlorophenyl)-2-butylamino-ethanol hydrochloride). Two sets of experiments were performed. One set of experiments investigated the effects of tulobuterol and terbutaline in chronic administration, while the second set compared the beta-adrenoceptor-stimulating properties of tulobuterol with terbutaline and salbutamol. The effects of 10 days' administration of tulobuterol and terbutaline on beta-adrenergic characteristics in rats were assessed biochemically by means of radioligand binding studies on pulmonary membranes and functionally using isolated tracheal spirals. It was found that: (1) In vivo treatment with both drugs induced a reduction of the number of beta-adrenoceptors bound by 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA); however, tulobuterol also induced an increased affinity for beta-adrenoceptor binding. (2) Tulobuterol induced a significant increase in the sensitization of tracheal smooth muscle, facilitating the relaxation of airway smooth muscle. The inhibition of 3H-DHA binding with the three drugs was best fit in a two-binding site model, showing high- and low-affinity binding sites. The high-affinity sites had similar KD values for terbutaline and tulobuterol (1.6 x 10(7) and 1.5 x 10(-7), respectively). The high-affinity sites for salbutamol had a higher KD value (9.4 x 10(-7), suggesting a lower affinity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "The pharmacology of salmeterol hydroxynaphthoate (SALM) has been investigated in respiratory tissues in vitro and in animal models in vivo. In guinea pig trachea and human bronchial smooth muscle, SALM was more potent than isoprenaline (ISO), salbutamol (SALB), and clenbuterol (CLEN). The duration of action was greater than 7 h, whereas that for ISO, SALB, and CLEN was 2, 11, and 45 min, respectively. The sustained activity of SALM was reversed by sotalol, but was reestablished when the beta-blocker was removed. SALM was greater than 3000-fold weaker than ISO in cardiac tissues, indicating high beta 2-adrenoceptor selectivity. In the conscious guinea pig, aerosolized SALM, SALB, and CLEN caused dose-related bronchodilatation. The activity of SALM persisted for at least 6 h, compared with less than 2 h for SALB and CLEN. SALM is also a potent inhibitor of mediator release from human lung, this effect being sustained for up to 20 hours. In guinea pig airways in vivo, SALM inhibited histamine-induced plasma protein extravasation for approximately 8 h. Salmeterol is a potent and selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist with a unique profile of action. It induces persistent bronchodilatation, sustained suppression of mediator release, and long-lasting inhibition of edema formation. This combination of properties may represent an important new advance in the treatment of bronchial asthma.", 
    "73": "We investigated the effect of respiratory-burst stimulants on beta-2 adrenoceptors in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL). Pre-incubation of PMNL with these substances did not affect the number or affinity of the receptors but desensitized them, as shown by the \"right-shift\" in (-)-isoproterenol competition isotherms. H-7, an established protein kinase C inhibitor, and nimesulide, a new putative inhibitor of this enzyme, blunted both superoxide anion production and beta-2 adrenoceptor desensitization. A positive correlation was found between superoxide anion generation and the \"right-shift\" in isoproterenol competition isotherm (r = 0.92; p less than 0.01). Desensitization of beta-2 adrenoceptors was not due to superoxide anions per se since incubation of PMNL with superoxide anion scavengers (superoxide dismutase and catalase) did not modify the results.", 
    "74": "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to study the effects of acute and chronic administration of carvedilol in essential hypertension, with special emphasis on renal haemodynamics and function. Acute administration of a single dose of 50 mg carvedilol reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure without inducing reflex tachycardia. Renal blood flow was preserved; accordingly, renal vascular resistance was significantly reduced. A significant reduction in the glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction was observed. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone values were not changed. Chronic carvedilol treatment produced a significant fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, PRA and plasma aldosterone. Renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction also remained unchanged; renal vascular resistance decreased significantly. It is concluded that carvedilol possesses definite antihypertensive and renal vasodilating properties, both acutely and after chronic treatment.", 
    "75": "A 20-year follow-up study of central hemodynamics in essential hypertension at rest and during exercise in 61 men with uncomplicated essential hypertension has clearly shown that hemodynamic disturbances depend on the age of the subjects and the severity of the hypertensive state and that a shift in the hemodynamic alterations take place over time. During 10- and 20-year follow-up, central hemodynamics changed towards a low cardiac-index (CI)-high total peripheral-resistance index (TPRI) pattern. With increasing age there was a gradual reduction in CI as well as stroke index (SI). The arteriovenous oxygen difference increased, particularly during exercise. The 20-year treatment with conventional drugs (beta-blockers and/or diuretics) did not prevent a marked increase in TPRI and a marked reduction in CI and SI in subjects initially 40-49 years of age. In recent years, beta-blockers with vasodilating activity have been introduced in the treatment of hypertension (labetalol, prizidilol, dilevalol and carvedilol). The hemodynamic effects of these compounds clearly differ from the changes induced during acute and chronic conventional beta-blocking treatment. In contrast to usual beta-blockers, these drugs reduce TPRI acutely and the reductions they produce in heart rate (HR) and CI are considerably lower. Our long-term data on labetalol (n = 15), prizidilol (n = 15) and dilevalol (n = 17) indicate a persistent reduction in TPRI and little or no decrease in exercise CI. Long-term data on carvedilol are not yet available. Approximately 70% of patients with mild to moderately severe essential hypertension achieved normal blood pressure during chronic treatment on beta-blockers with vasodilating activity.", 
    "76": "Carvedilol and nitrendipine were given for 12 weeks in a double-blind study to 81 elderly patients (greater than or equal to 60 years) with essential hypertension. The effects on blood pressure were measured (Riva Rocci) before medication and after 2 h with the patient in a lying and standing position after 4 weeks of placebo therapy as well as after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment. Carvedilol (25 mg/o.d.) reduced blood pressure measured in the supine and erect position very successfully, similar to the reduction achieved with nitrendipine (20 mg/o.d.), without influencing the pulse rate. Both substances were well tolerated. Carvedilol is an alternative substance for lowering high blood pressure in elderly hypertensive patients.", 
    "77": "A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial of 8 weeks' duration was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of once-daily carvedilol with that of twice-daily labetalol in patients with essential hypertension. A total of 61 patients (13 women and 48 men) aged 26-64 years (mean +/- SEM = 49.6 +/- 1.3 years) were enrolled. All patients had mild to moderate hypertension, defined as diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95-114 mm Hg at the end of a 1- to 2-week single-blind placebo period. In all, 30 patients received carvedilol (25 mg once daily) and 31 received labetalol (200 mg twice daily). The initial dose could be doubled for both treatment groups at day 29 if the DBP was greater than 90 mmHg on days 28 and 29. Hemodynamic parameters, including supine and standing DBP, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and heart rate (HR), were measured and safety was evaluated at baseline and at days 14, 28, and 56 at the end of the dosing interval. In all, 3 patients on carvedilol and 4 patients on labetalol required upward dose titration after 1 month. At the end of the trial, 26 of 30 carvedilol-treated patients and 27 of 31 labetalol-treated patients (87% of each group) had a supine DBP of less than or equal to 90 mm Hg. On day 56, mean decreases in supine DBP, SBP, and HR in the carvedilol group were 18.5 and 23.4 mm Hg and 11 beats/min, respectively, from baseline values of 101.6 and 163.8 mm Hg and 80 beats/min, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The hypotensive effect, safety, and optimal dose were investigated. In all, 23 untreated patients (16 men and 7 women; average age, 56.4 +/- 2.5 years) made up the monotherapy group and 19 diuretic-treated patients (11 men and 8 women; average age, 56.4 +/- 2.5 years) comprised the combined therapy group. All subjects had an initial blood pressure (BP) of greater than 160/95 mmHg and were started on 5 mg/day oral carvedilol. The dose was gradually increased to a maximum of 20 mg/day, or until either the BP was reduced to less than 149/89 mmHg or the reduction in mean BP was greater than 13 mmHg compared with baseline levels. The total study period was 8 weeks. With monotherapy, the BP and heart rate decreased significantly from 167/102 to 150/94 mmHg and from 81 to 74 beats/min, respectively. With combined therapy, the BP and heart rate fell significantly from 176/103 to 142/85 mmHg and from 81 to 70 beats/min, respectively. Responders were defined as subjects with a BP of less than or equal to 149/89 mmHg or those showing a fall of greater than or equal to 13 mmHg in mean BP.

A total of 18 patients entered the baseline study phase, during which they received 25 mg HCTZ once daily for 4 weeks; 16 of these patients (8 men and 8 women) entered the combination treatment phase. All patients had a supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg prior to receiving the first dose of combination treatment. Combination treatment consisted of 25 mg HCTZ plus 12.5 mg carvedilol once daily for 2 days, followed by a forced titration of the carvedilol dose to 25 mg for 7 days. After 2 days of 12.5 mg carvedilol plus 25 mg HCTZ once daily, mean trough blood pressure was reduced as compared with baseline values. Of 16 patients, 6 (38%) achieved a trough supine DBP of less than 90 mm Hg.

After a placebo run-in phase of 2 weeks, 131 patients received 25 mg HCTZ o.d. for 4 weeks. In all, 122 patients were transferred to the double-blind phase, in which 25 mg carvedilol or 50 mg atenolol was randomly added to HCTZ. After an additional 6 weeks of treatment, 112 patients were evaluable for efficacy (C/HCTZ group, n = 54; A/HCTZ group, n = 58). Blood pressure was measured and the heart rate was counted before medication, at 2-week intervals throughout the trial, and 2 h after medication on the 1st and the last day of the combination treatment period. Serum lipids were measured in addition to routine laboratory variables. A therapeutic response was defined as a reduction in supine and standing diastolic blood pressure to values of less than 90 mm Hg. In a relatively low number of patients (6 of 131), a response as defined above was achieved with HCTZ alone. This may be accounted for by the fact that patients were required to have a diastolic blood pressure of at least 100 mg Hg and by the relatively short period of monotherapy. The two groups of patients receiving different combination treatments were well matched for demographic data and blood pressure values before the adjunct was added. In both groups there was a marked additional blood pressure decrease on the initiation of combined treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Responders at 4 weeks (DBP, less than 90 mmHg) terminated the study. Nonresponders continued the study. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) was added at 25 mg o.d. for a further 6 weeks. The median blood pressure decreased under monotherapy with carvedilol (n = 59) from 167/105 at baseline to 155/94 mmHg after 4 weeks, and in the atenolol group (n = 59) it decreased from 168/105 to 162/97 mmHg. The patients who received carvedilol in combination with HCTZ and were evaluated for efficacy (n = 38) showed a decrease in SBP/DBP from 156/97 at the end of monotherapy to 145/88 mmHg after 10 weeks; the combination of atenolol with HCTZ (n = 44) reduced BP from 162/97 to 147/88. Both carvedilol and atenolol were safe when given either alone or in combination with HCTZ. In conclusion, after long-term administration, 25 mg carvedilol o.d. and 50 mg atenolol o.d. significantly reduced both SBP and DBP over 24 h.

The subjects were 18 men and 18 women, 20 with hypertension and 16 normotensives with other conditions requiring carvedilol treatment. They were aged from 31 to 79 years and were given a daily dose of 5-20 mg carvedilol (average, 9.7 mg/day) for 12 weeks.

Smaller changes in blood pressure and heart rate were seen in the normotensive subjects, with the fall in systolic pressure being significant (from 143 +/- 3 to 135 +/- 2 mm Hg, P less than 0.01). There were no significant changes in the overall serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and phospholipid levels. In the subgroup with a pretreatment serum triglyceride level of greater than 150 mg/dl, a significant fall of 52.1 mg/dl was seen (P less than 0.05). Lipoprotein analysis showed a significant fall in alpha-lipoprotein levels (P less than 0.05).

In the first study the pharmacokinetics and clinical response were compared between 21 patients greater than 65 years of age and 8 patients aged 35-50 years). The peak blood levels, time to maximal concentration, area under the curve, half-life and trough level of the drug with chronic administration did not differ. The clinical responses to the drug were similar, with a greater fall in systolic blood pressure in the older group. However the initial systolic blood pressure in the older group was higher. Carvedilol was compared with metoprolol, pindolol and nitrendipine in elderly patients. The responses to carvedilol were at least equal to those obtained with the other drugs. Control was achieved in the three studies with once-daily therapy. There was no significant postural hypotensive effect. A feature of all studies was the large number of patients who responded to carvedilol. The side-effect profile of the drug was acceptable; headache and dizziness were more common than with placebo or the comparison drugs and were frequently associated. There were no adverse biochemical effects and the lipid profile was not altered. Carvedilol is an effective antihypertensive drug that lowers blood pressure equally well in the young and the old.",

Heart rate, aortic pressure, mean coronary sinus pressure and coronary flow (thermodilution) were measured and coronary resistance and the rate-pressure product were calculated before and 25 min after injection. Carvedilol significantly (P less than 0.05) lowered the heart rate (mean, 76 to 69 beats/min), aortic pressure (mean, 153/80-135/72 mm Hg), rate-pressure product (mean, 117-93 mm Hg/min), and coronary flow (mean, 114-94 ml/min). Coronary resistance (mean, 0.97-1.07 mm Hg x min/ml) and coronary flow related to the rate-pressure product (mean, 1.0-1.02 ml/mm Hg) showed no significant change after carvedilol treatment. Propranolol lowered the heart rate (mean, 76-64/min; P less than 0.05) and rate-pressure product (mean, 109-96 mm Hg/min; not significant). Aortic pressure (mean, 145/72-147/74 mm Hg), coronary flow (mean 109-101 ml/min), coronary resistance (mean, 1.1-1.2 mm Hg x min/ml), and coronary flow related to the rate-pressure product (mean, 1.12-1.19 ml/mm Hg) showed no significant change after propranolol administration. Following single application, carvedilol lowered the rate-pressure product more markedly than did propranolol on account of its acute blood-pressure-lowering effect. No differences in the hemodynamic effects of carvedilol and propranolol were found. Neither drug seems to influence the adaption of coronary flow to myocardial oxygen demand.", 
    "85": "We studied the effects of oral carvedilol (20 mg/day) on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and CBF autoregulation in ten previous stroke patients with hypertension. Measurement of CBF was done by the argon inhalation method. CBF autoregulation was also studied by the (A-V)O2 method after stepwise reduction in systemic blood pressure. After 1 week of carvedilol administration, the mean arterial blood pressure showed an 18% decrease, with no significant changes in CBF, CBF autoregulation, or other cerebral circulation parameters. From these findings, it can be said that carvedilol is a potent antihypertensive agent that does not affect cerebral circulation parameters.", 
    "86": "The effects of a beta-blocker, carvedilol, on peripheral hemodynamics and hemorheologic parameters were evaluated in 11 geriatric patients with essential hypertension [3 men and 8 women aged 62-79 years (mean, 68.6 years)]. Carvedilol was given orally after breakfast at a dose of 10 or 20 mg daily for 8 weeks. Peripheral hemodynamics, the common carotid arterial flow, and hemorheologic parameters were determined twice prior to administration and after 4 and 8 weeks of carvedilol treatment. The common carotid arterial flow was determined using the pulsed Doppler method. Peripheral hemodynamics were assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography. The hemorheologic parameters assessed include erythrocyte aggregation, erythrocyte deformability, plasma viscosity, whole-blood hematocrit, and platelet function tests. Erythrocyte aggregation was measured using an Erythrocyte Aggregometer MA-1 (Myrenne, USA), taking a high shear rate of 600 s-1 and a low shear rate of 3 s-1 as the indices. Statistical comparisons of values before and after carvedilol administration were made using the paired Student's t-test. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were decreased by carvedilol. The common carotid arterial flow was increased, and peripheral hemodynamics were improved by carvedilol. Erythrocyte aggregation (measured at both a high and a low shear rate) and plasma viscosity were decreased, erythrocyte deformability was increased, and levels of circulating platelet aggregates were also improved by carvedilol. This improvement of hemorheologic variables may contribute to prevention of the initiation and progression of thrombosis and atherosclerosis in geriatric patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "87": "The racemic compound carvedilol is a multiple-action oral antihypertensive drug that exhibits both vasodilator and non-selective beta-adrenergic blocking activities. The effects of the levorotatory S-enantiomer [S(-)-CARV] are vasodilatation and beta-blockade. The R(+)-enantiomer [R(+)-CARV] is a pure vasodilating agent. Quantitative determination of the enantiomers in human plasma by HPLC was carried out after formation of diastereoisomers with the chiral reagent 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate (GITC). The pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers were studied following i.v. (12.5 mg in 1 h) and p.o. (50 mg) administration of racemic carvedilol in ten healthy male subjects according to a randomized crossover design. The AUCs of S(-)-CARV were significantly lower than those of R(+)-CARV after both i.v. and p.o. administration. The systemic clearance of the two enantiomers was significantly different, whereas half-lives and apparent distribution volumes were comparable. Following p.o. administration, the absolute bioavailability (31.1% and 15.1%, respectively) and maximal plasma concentrations of R(+)-CARV were twice those of S(-)-CARV. A similar difference was found in the half-lives. A close correlation existed between enantiomeric ratios after i.v. and after p.o. administration, demonstrating slight intraindividual variability. The preferential systemic clearance of the S(-)-enantiomer suggests stereoselective hepatic metabolism of carvedilol, becoming especially apparent after p.o. administration. The small intrasubject variability in enantiomer ratios indicates a relatively constant relation of beta-blockade to vasodilation during chronic treatment.", 
    "88": "The racemic compound carvedilol possesses two complementary pharmacological effects, vasodilation and beta-blockade. The R- and S-enantiomers of carvedilol and the racemate were investigated with respect to the beta-blocking, vasodilating, and hypotensive actions. In agreement with results obtained with other beta-blockers, only the S-enantiomer of carvedilol exerts beta-blocking effects. In contrast, no substantial difference between the enantiomers could be seen with respect to alpha-blockade. The greater hypotensive activity of S-carvedilol may be attributed to beta-blockade, which inhibits counter-regulatory mechanisms provoked by vasodilation. From these results it is concluded that there is a rationale for using carvedilol as the racemate. Using the S-enantiomer would lead to relatively strong beta-blockade with only a weak vasodilating effect. The R-enantiomer alone would act only as a hypotensive agent without beta-blockade."
