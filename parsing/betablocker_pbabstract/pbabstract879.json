    "0": "The lateral saphenous vein of dogs was perfused at constant flow with autologous arterial blood, and perfusion and femoral vein pressures were monitored; changes in the difference between these pressures were due to changes in venomotor activity. Injection of isoproterenol into the perfusate caused the vein to dilate. The amount of dilatation depended on smooth muscle tension in the wall of the vein before injection. When this was minimal (after sympathectomy), isoproterenol had no effect. During venoconstriction produced by electrical stimulation of the lumbar sympathetic chain or by the infusion of venoconstrictor drugs, the dilating action of 0.1 mg of isoproterenol was measured. Expressed as a percentage of the initial constriction caused by sympathetic stimulation, 5-hydroxytryptamine, or 1 M potassium chloride, the extent of the dilatation was 86.7+/-4.3 (SE of mean), 79.7+/-4.2, and 87.7+/-3.2, respectively. With norepinephrine and epinephrine infusions, the isoproterenol dilatations were less (65.1+/-9.0 and 55.2+/-7.2, respectively), consistent with the stimulant action of these agents on both alpha and beta receptors; such action was confirmed by comparing the responses to nerve stimulation and infusions of norepinephrine and epinephrine before and after betareceptor blockade. The venoconstriction caused by sympathetic stimulation and by infusions of norepinephrine and epinephrine was greatly enhanced by cooling the vein (decreasing perfusate temperature), but the dilating action of isoproterenol appeared to be insensitive to changes in temperature. The data suggest that beta receptors are specific entities and, when maximally stimulated, are capable of causing a venous relaxation that is proportional to the initial degree of tension in the vein wall.", 
    "1": "1. Angiotensin (200-500 ng, intravenously) produced a biphasic pressor response accompanied by reflex bradycardia in rats anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone. In pithed rats and in anaesthetized animals treated with a ganglion blocking agent there was a similar pressor response but an increase in the heart rate which was coincident with the second phase of the pressor response. In pithed preparations an increase in cardiac contractile force accompanied the heart rate changes.2. Acute or chronic adrenalectomy did not alter the pressor responses and chronotropic effect of angiotensin in the pithed rat. Propranolol abolished the chronotropic and inotropic action of angiotensin, but left the biphasic pressor response unaltered. Bethanidine, or pretreatment with reserpine, altered the pressor response to a simple rise, and also abolished the chronotropic action of angiotensin. Phentolamine also abolished the second pressor component. Desmethylimipramine produced a marked potentiation of the cardiovascular effects of angiotensin at all dose levels tested (10-500 ng).3. It is concluded that in the rat only large doses of angiotensin are capable of indirectly stimulating the sympathetic nerves either at the site of their ganglionic cells or their post-ganglionic nerve ending.", 
    "2": "A cardio-selective beta-adrenergic blocking agent (I.C.I. 50172), which has been studied both in normal subjects and in patients with angina pectoris during and after a standardized work test, produced a significant increase in the exercise tolerance of the patients. These favourable effects are comparable with those of propranolol.One patient with severe bronchial asthma and coronary insufficiency treated with I.C.I. 50172 improved and his respiratory function was not impaired.", 
    "3": "1. (+)-propranolol and (+/-)-propranolol are comparable in their potency as a local anaesthetic on the intact and desheathed frog sciatic nerve.2. (+/-)-propranolol is much more potent than (+)-propranolol as a beta-receptor blocking agent and also more effective than the latter in protecting guinea-pigs against ouabain-induced ventricular fibrillation.3. In isolated rabbit atria (-)-, (+)- and (+/-)-propranolol, and I.C.I. 50172, which has hardly any local anaesthetic activity, greatly reduce the rate of rise of the intracellularly recorded action potential at concentrations which have no significant effect on electrical threshold, contractions, spontaneous frequency, maximum driving frequency, repolarization time or conduction velocity."
