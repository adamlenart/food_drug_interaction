At recruitment, all women underwent endothelial function testing (intracoronary acetylcholine) during catheterization. Patients were followed up for >10 years. Angiography was repeated at the end of the follow-up in 37 patients. At recruitment, 22 patients developed diffuse vasoconstriction during acetylcholine in the absence of identifiable focal coronary spasm (acetylcholine-positive group). The remaining 20 patients showed vasodilation (acetylcholine-negative group). At the end of follow-up, in the acetylcholine-positive group, 1 patient developed cardiac death, 13 still complained of chest pain, and 8 had remission of symptoms. In the acetylcholine-negative group, all patients showed complete resolution of chest pain beginning 6 to 36 months after baseline assessment. Angiography showed development of coronary artery disease in the 13 symptomatic patients in the acetylcholine-positive group.",

    "9": "Aldosterone blockade has been shown to be effective in reducing total mortality as well as hospitalization for heart failure in patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction (SLVD) due to chronic heart failure and in patients with SLVD post acute myocardial infarction. The evidence for the effectiveness of aldosterone blockade in chronic heart failure comes from the randomized aldactone evaluation study (RALES) while that for patients post infarction from the eplerenone post acute myocardial infarction efficacy and survival study (EPHESUS). These studies suggest that mineralocorticoid receptor activation remains important despite the use of an angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocking (ARB) agent and a beta blocker. Increasing evidence suggest that aldosterone blockade has important effects not only on the kidney but on ventricular remodeling, myocardial fibrosis, autonomic balance, fibrinolysis, oxidative stress, and activation of the NF-kappaB and AP-1 signaling pathways. The results of these studies in patients with SLVD has important implications not only for patients with chronic heart failure and post infarction but also for the therapy of patients with essential hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "10": "Minoxidil is a direct vasodilator introduced in the early 1970s for the treatment of hypertension. It is capable of reducing blood pressure in most persons with resistant hypertension where therapy has failed with multidrug regimens. Minoxidil's effect can be limited because of an increase in pulse rate and/or sodium (and water) retention. The latter may prove quite debilitating in some patients. Thus, minoxidil is generally administered with both a diuretic and an agent that can keep pulse rate in check, such as a beta blocker or a combined alpha-beta blocker. The prominent tachycardia with minoxidil can aggravate myocardial ischemia and, if long-standing, leads to left ventricular hypertrophy. Minoxidil has a particularly annoying side effect of hypertrichosis that may limit its use, particularly among women. Minoxidil use is infrequently associated with the idiosyncratic onset of a pericardial effusion. If a patient's hypertension is severe enough to warrant minoxidil therapy, a hypertension specialist should probably become involved in the patient's care. The use of this medication should be limited in view of the availability of effective agents with fewer side effects. There is, however, a place for minoxidil in the treatment of resistant hypertension especially in patients with advanced renal disease.",

A total of 434 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to placebo or to one of four doses of propranolol CR (80, 120, 160, or 640 mg/d). At baseline, the mean morning blood pressures were similar in each treatment group and averaged 152/101 mm Hg. After 8 weeks of treatment, morning diastolic blood pressure, the primary efficacy measurement, was significantly reduced from baseline in placebo (-6.98 mm Hg) and all propranolol groups (p<0.001). The decreases ranged from 10.1 mm Hg in the 80-mg/d group to 11.0 mm Hg in the 120-mg/d group and were significantly larger than placebo in the 120-, 160-, and 640-mg/d groups (p<0.05). Blood pressure measured in the evening (trough) demonstrated similar antihypertensive efficacy. Heart rate and rate-pressure product were reduced in a dose-related manner by propranolol CR. The formulation was well tolerated with only fatigue and dizziness being reported more frequently than in the placebo group. Propranolol CR is an effective antihypertensive formulation that may reduce blood pressure during the morning period of maximum cardiovascular risk.",

Hydroxypropyl betaCD (HPbetaCD) and partially methylated betaCD (PMbetaCD) were used as penetration enhancers for BPL. The formation of inclusion complex of BPL with these cyclodextrins (CDs) was characterized in solution and solid states by phase solubility, X-ray diffractometry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses. The effect of CDs on the permeation enhancement of BPL through rat skin was studied using side-by-side diffusion cells and pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). CDs were employed at different concentrations with 0.4% (w/v) BPL as well as with excess quantity of BPL (1.0%, w/v) that CDs could not complex all the BPL and the drug was in the form of an aqueous suspension. The permeation of BPL from its aqueous suspension (0.4%, w/v) significantly increased when CDs were used at low concentrations (up to 2 and 5%, w/v concentration for HPbetaCD and PMbetaCD, respectively) (P < 0.01). At higher CD concentrations, the permeation of BPL decreased; and both CDs at 10% (w/w), showed similar flux values to that of control (no enhancer, P > 0.05). The permeation of BPL from its 1.0% (w/v) aqueous suspension increased with increase in concentration of CD up to 10% (w/v) for HPbetaCD and PMbetaCD. At 10% (w/v) concentration of HPbetaCD and PMbetaCD, the flux of BPL from its 1.0% aqueous suspension increased 3.8- and 4.6-fold (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). The permeation data of skin pretreatment with CDs indicate that HPbetaCD had no effect on the skin, whereas PMbetaCD significantly reduced the skin barrier for BPL, as shown by 1.7-fold increase in the flux by PMbetaCD pretreatment (P < 0.001). Overall, both HPbetaCD and PMbetaCD were found to be suitable for improving the solubility and penetration enhancement of BPL.",

This summary report presents a number of recent studies addressing these important issues.", 
    "36": "Hypertension frequently coexists with diabetes mellitus, occurring twice as frequently in diabetic as in nondiabetic persons. It accounts for up to 75% of added cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in people with diabetes, contributing significantly to the overall morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population. Patients with hypertension are two times more prone to have diabetes than are normotensive persons. Hypertension substantially increases the risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, retinopathy, and nephropathy. In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension usually clusters with the other components of the cardiometabolic syndrome, such as microalbuminuria, central obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypercoagulation, increased inflammation, and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). In type 1 diabetes, hypertension often occurs subsequent to the development of diabetic nephropathy. Hypertension in people with diabetes is characterized by volume expansion, increased salt sensitivity, isolated systolic blood pressure (BP) elevation, loss of the nocturnal dipping of BP and pulse, and increased propensity toward orthostatic hypotension and albuminuria. Among the treatment strategies tested in hypertensive diabetic persons, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol lowering to less than 100 mg/dL and aggressive BP control to less than 130/80 mm Hg have proven effective in CVD risk reduction. The combination of two or more drugs is usually necessary to achieve the target BP.", 
    "37": "Most of the deleterious effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) on blood pressure (BP), cardiovascular remodeling, and atherosclerosis are mediated by Ang II type 1 (AT1)-receptor activation. This explains why Ang-II-decreasing or blocking drugs have been successful in decreasing global cardiovascular morbimortality in patients with cardiac complications. However, in primary or secondary stroke prevention trials in patients with low cardiac risk, b-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), which decrease Ang II formation, seem to be less protective than thiazides and dihydropyridines, which increase Ang II. When compared with a beta-blocker, an Ang II-increasing AT1-receptor blocker better protects against stroke but not against cardiac events, whereas an ACEI gives the same protection against both cardiac and cerebral events. This dissociation between blood-pressure-independent cardiac and cerebral protection between b-blockers or ACEIs versus AT1-blockers in patients with low cardiac risk can be best explained if, besides the beneficial vascular effect of AT1-receptor blunting, there is evidence of a beneficial effect of non-AT1-receptor activation. In this review, we present experimental evidence for AT2- and AT4-receptor-mediated brain-anti-ischemic mechanisms and propose a direct comparison of AT1-blockers with ACEIs to prove the clinical effectiveness of non-AT1-mediated mechanisms in stroke prevention, particularly in patients with a higher risk for stroke than for cardiac complications.", 
    "38": "We previously reported that vitamin E prevents apoptosis in neurons during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). In this paper, we analyzed the effects of antihypertensives as well as vitamin E, which were added to neuron cultures after reoxygenation (20% O2) following hypoxia (1% O2). When added after hypoxia before reoxygenation, vitamin E conferred significant protection to neuronal cells. It was also shown that vitamin E conferred complete protection from neural cell death when added hypoxia and again before reoxygenation. At higher concentrations of vitamin E, strong neuroprotection was observed. Moreover, we verified that pretreatment with either amlodipine, carvedilol or dipyridamole consistently prevented cell death during hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R). On the other hand, nilvadipine, a dihydropyridine-type calcium entry blocker, had no apparent effect on neuroprotection during H/R. The order of neuroprotective potency was vitamin E > dipyridamole > carvedilol > or = amlodipine > nilvadipine. In parallel experiments, we examined whether these antihypertensive agents were more effective when combined with vitamin E and dipyridamole. The results suggested that in our in vitro model system, antioxidants were the most important agents for the reduction of oxygen-free radical damage in cortical neurons. These findings suggest that amlodipine and carvedilol, with their antioxidant properties and antihypertensive activity, would be useful to inhibit neuronal cell death in the treatment of cerebrovascular stroke and neurodegenerative diseases in hypertensive patients.",

Phase-solubility studies demonstrated the ability of beta-cyclodextrins to complex with carvedilol and increase drug solubility. The structure of inclusion complex was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy and 1H NMR, 13C NMR measurements in solution. The solid inclusion was characterised by infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and element analysis. These experimental results confirmed the existence of 1:2 inclusion complex of carvedilol with beta-cyclodextrin, the formation constant of complex was determined by the fluorescence method. Molecular modeling predicted the energy-minimized structure of the complex.", 
    "40": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) activation on metabolism in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. The protein synthesis and total protein content of cardiomyocytes were determined by [(3)H]-leucine incorporation and BCA protein content assay. Cardiomyocyte glucose uptake was measured by [(3)H]-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake analysis. Adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation was detected by Western blot. The results showed that sustained stimulation with isoproterenol (ISO), a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, had no effect on [(3)H]-leucine incorporation and total protein content in cardiomyocytes. With beta-AR activation by ISO or NE (pretreated with a selective blocker of the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor prazosin) for 48 h, both the glucose uptake and AMPK phosphorylation increased significantly compared with unstimulated cardiomyocytes. These results suggest that although sustained beta-AR activation has no effect on cardiomyocyte protein metabolism, glucose uptake and AMPK activity are increased significantly. The role of these beta-AR activation-induced changes in cardiac hypertrophy remains to be further investigated.", 
    "41": "Using positron emission tomography and the selective 5-HT1A receptor radioligand [11C]WAY100635, we previously demonstrated a preferential occupancy of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, compared to postsynaptic receptors by pindolol in healthy volunteers. We have speculated that preferential occupancy may be clinically important for the purported actions of pindolol in accelerating the antidepressant effects of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In this study, we have examined the preferential occupancy by pindolol of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, following three different pindolol regimes (10 mg single dose, 2.5 mg t.i.d., and 5 mg t.i.d., in 15 depressed patients on SSRIs. In addition, seven healthy volunteers were examined following a single 10 mg dose of pindolol. We found a preferential occupancy of 22.6+/-7.7% following a single dose of 10 mg of pindolol, in the healthy volunteers, which was attenuated in depressed patients on the same dose of pindolol to 2.9+/-10.8% (Student's t=3.94, df=12, p=0.002). In addition, we found a significant negative correlation between the degree of preferential occupancy and the severity of depression as assessed by the Hamilton depression rating score (HAM-D), Spearman's rho=-0.728, N=14, p=0.003, in the depressed sample. A possible mechanism underlying preferential occupancy and the attenuation of this phenomenon in depressed patients on SSRIs may include changes in the proportion of high affinity 5-HT1A sites in the autoreceptor region of the midbrain raphe. Speculatively, the degree of preferential occupancy may serve as a surrogate marker for depression, or the pharmacological effects of antidepressants.", 
    "42": "This study provides novel data on the regional hemodynamic effects of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activator, GI 262570 [(S)-2-(2-benzoylphenylamino)-3-[4-[2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-2-oxazol-4-yl)ethoxy]phenyl]propionic acid], in conscious, male Sprague-Dawley rats. Administration of GI 262570 twice daily for 4 days caused a slowly developing, modest fall in mean arterial blood pressure, associated with a progressive, hyperemic hindquarters vasodilatation, but with no consistent changes in renal or mesenteric hemodynamics. The hindquarters vasodilator effect of GI 262570 was not inhibited by the beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118551 ((+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl) amino]-2-butanol hydrochloride), and was still apparent in the presence of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine. Neither the latter, nor antagonism of angiotensin (AT1) and endothelin (ETA and ETB) receptors unmasked vasodilator responses to GI 262570 in the renal or mesenteric vascular beds. In the presence of GI 262570, vasodilator responses to acetylcholine and vasoconstrictor responses to methoxamine were normal. Furthermore, the cardiovascular responses to nonselective nitric-oxide synthase inhibition were not influenced by GI 262570. Collectively, these results indicate that the vasodilator action of GI 262570 is specific to the hindquarters vascular bed (of those studied), does not involve alpha- or beta2-adrenoceptors, and is not associated with a change in basal or stimulated nitric oxide release.", 
    "43": "Thyroidectomy (TX) is no longer the preferred choice for the therapy of hyperthyroid Graves' disease but is an alternative in patients who are noncompliant with or have reactions to antithyroid drugs, have moderate to severe ophthalmopathy, have large goiters, or who refuse (131)I therapy and/or long-term antithyroid drug therapy. Seventeen clinically and biochemically severely thyrotoxic patients (16 female, mean age of 35 yr), all but one with large goiters, underwent TX after rapid preparation. The potent inhibitors of the deiodination of T(4) to T(3), iopanoic acid (IOP) (500 mg twice a day) and dexamethasone (DEX) (1 mg twice a day), were given with propylthiouracil or methimazole, when possible, and beta-blockers. Thyroid function tests were obtained before treatment and at TX. All patients were thyrotoxic (mean +/- SE: T(4), 21.6 +/- 1.2 micro g/dl; free T(4) index (FTI), 10.3 +/- 0.8; total T(3), 510 +/- 48 ng/dl). IOP and DEX rapidly lowered T(3) values (P < 0.0001; total T(3), 147 +/- 13 ng/dl) with a smaller but significant (P < 0.05) decrease in T(4)/FTI (T(4), 17.9 +/- 1.3 micro g/dl; FTI, 7.9 +/- 0.6). All patients were clinically euthyroid before surgery. None developed hypoparathyroidism, laryngeal nerve damage, or worsening of ophthalmopathy after surgery. The restoration of hyperthyroid Graves' disease to euthyroidism is rapidly accomplished with IOP and DEX, beta-blockers, and, when possible, antithyroid drugs. This is especially relevant in noncompliant patients with large goiters.", 
    "44": "Literature suggests the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta in the renal injury that follows chronic ureteric obstruction. SMAD proteins and the JNK1 cascade are essential components of TGF-beta signaling machinery, and recent data suggest cooperative interaction between JNK1 and SMAD proteins in TGF-beta-mediated gene expression. We used a rat model of chronic unilateral ureteric obstruction to study the effects of candesartan, an AT(1A)-receptor blocker, on tissue morphology and the activities of JNK1 and SMAD2 protein in the kidney. Ureteric obstruction for 28 days leads to interstitial fibrosis, tubule atrophy, and marked activation of SMAD2 and JNK1, without significant change in p38 kinase or ERK. Candesartan treatment, however, attenuated the chronic tubulointerstitial injury in obstructed kidneys and was associated with significant preservation of kidney tissue mass. Furthermore, treatment with candesartan diminished JNK1 activity and downregulated SMAD2 protein and activity in obstructed kidneys. In conclusion, obstructed kidneys showed chronic tubulointerstitial injury, which was associated with JNK1 and SMAD2 activation. The renoprotective effects afforded by AT(1A)-receptor blockade in obstructive uropathy are consistent with attenuation of JNK1- and SMAD2-mediated renal injury.",

Thiazides have to be given in the first line an antihypertensive treatment to the patients, especially if they are old, or have a great risk for a cardiovascular complication (stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy). In the case of natrium-retention (diabetes, obesity, nephropathy), the treatment without diuretics is not effective. Thiazides make stronger the effects especially of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta receptor blockers. The newer diuretics--with fewer side effects--have very likely extrarenal way of effects, so their long time application seems very favourable.", 
    "47": "Coronary artery fistula between a coronary artery and a cardiac chamber is a rare condition, especially when multiple fistulas communicate with the left ventricle. Herein we report a case of an elderly woman with multiple diffuse coronary artery-left ventricular fistulas diagnosed by angiography. Since the coronary artery-cardiac chamber communications were multiple and diffuse neither surgery nor transcatheter coil occlusion was considered in this case.", 
    "48": "In order to elucidate a putative role of neurally derived noradrenaline in the thymus development, and in maintenance of adult thymus structure, sexually immature male rats (21-day-old at the beginning of treatment) and young adult animals (75-day-old on the beginning of treatment) were treated with the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (0.40 mg/100 g BW/day, s.c.) for 15 consecutive days, and their thymuses were analyzed stereologically. The effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockade were much more pronounced in sexually immature than in adult rats. In immature propranolol-treated rats the thymus size and volumes of both the main compartments (cortex and medulla) were significantly decreased reflecting, at least partly, a reduction in the overall number of thymocytes. Furthermore, in both the cortical subcompartments (outer and deep cortex) the mean diameter of thymocytes was increased. However, in adult rats exposed to propranolol treatment, only the volume of interlobular connective tissue was enlarged, whereas in the outer part of the cortex the mean thymocyte diameter was increased. These results indicate that the lack of sympathetic input (via beta-adrenoceptors) during the prepubertal period of development diminishes the normal thymus growth and/or accelerates the thymic involution that starts at puberty, immediately after its maximum size is reached, while it is less significant for the maintenance of the thymus size and structure in adults. Additionally, they suggest that distinct cell types, as well as thymocyte subsets, are sensitive to lack of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated influences in sexually immature and adult rats.", 
    "49": "We investigated whether carvedilol protects against experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) attributing to antioxidant properties. Acute EAM was induced by porcine cardiac myosin in Lewis rats. We orally administered a vehicle, various dosages of carvedilol, metoprolol, or propranolol to rats with EAM for 3 weeks. Three beta-blockers decreased heart rates to the same extent. Carvedilol, but not metoprolol or propranolol, markedly reduced the severity of myocarditis at the two different dosages. Only carvedilol decreased the myocardial protein carbonyl contents, and also decreased the myocardial thiobarbituric acid reactive substance products in rats with EAM. Accordingly, carvedilol protects against acute EAM in rats, and this superior cardioprotective effect of carvedilol to metoprolol and propranolol may be due to the antioxidant properties in addition to the hemodynamic modifications.", 
    "50": "Fibroblasts possess receptors for compounds released during ischemia, including bradykinin. The aims of the present study were to investigate tyrosine kinase and p38 MAP kinase signalling in heart derived myofibroblasts in response to bradykinin and preconditioning ischemia. Fibroblasts from neonatal rat hearts were subjected to pharmacological agents and/or simulated ischemia. Cell viability was measured by the conversion of a tetrazolium salt to its formazan derivative. Preconditioning with 30 min of simulated ischemia followed by 30 min recovery resulted in an 85.4% +/- 7.8% increase in cell survival above that of cells treated with prolonged ischemia alone. Cells treated with bradykinin showed a 35% +/- 7.9 increase in cell survival after lethal ischemia. The B2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140 blocked the protective effect of bradykinin, but did not block preconditioning. The K(ATP) channel blocker glibenclamide and the mitochondria specific K(ATP) blocker 5, hydroxydecanoate, abolished the cytoprotection induced by both preconditioning and bradykinin. The non specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein also abolished the cytoprotection. Effective blockade of cytoprotection was obtained with K(ATP) channel blockers and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor when these compounds were given prior to the preconditioning stimulus and not during the lethal insult. The stress activated protein kinase p38 MAP kinase was investigated by Western blotting and by the use of a specific inhibitor (SB203580). Preconditioning reduced phospho-p38 MAP kinase; in contrast, bradykinin administration markedly increased phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. SB203580 protected cells from lethal simulated ischemia. In conclusion, cell survival-signalling pathways activated by bradykinin or simulated ischemia in heart fibroblasts protect via the opening of K(ATP) channels and are independent of the stress-activated p38 MAP kinase and/or related to inhibition of this kinase.", 
    "51": "An immune-neuroendocrine interaction that is mediated via beta2-adrenergic receptors has been demonstrated previously. Dopexamine is a substance with strong beta2-adrenergic effects and is used in the treatment of critically ill patients. We therefore investigated the effect of dopexamine infusion on survival and cellular immune functions during systemic inflammation. Sepsis (CLP) was induced in male NMRI mice that received either 0.9% saline, dopexamine (0.05 mg/kg/hour ip, DPX), the selective beta2-adrenergic antagonist ICI 118.551 (0.5 mg/kg ip every 12 hours, ICI) or a combination of both drugs. 48 hours after onset of sepsis, survival rate, splenocyte apoptosis, splenocyte proliferation, splenocyte IL-2, IL-6 and IFN-gamma release, and leukocyte distribution were monitored. Dopexamine increased splenocyte apoptosis and normalized the distribution of circulating lymphocytes but did not affect sepsis-induced mortality. ICI 118.551 induced a dramatic increase of mortality paralleled by a decreased splenocyte proliferation and the strongest increase in splenocyte apoptosis. Co-administration of dopexamine abolished the ICI 118.551-induced alterations but this effect seemed to be mediated via a pathway other than adrenergic beta2-receptors. We conclude that dopexamine modulates cellular immune functions during systemic inflammation and that different receptor systems are involved in the mediation of this process. Furthermore, the immunomodulatory effect of beta2-adrenergic blockade was demonstrated.", 
    "52": "Nadolol, a beta-blocker used in the management of hypertension and angina pectoris, has three chiral centers and is currently marketed as an equal mixture of its four stereoisomers. Resolution of three of the four stereoisomers of nadolol was obtained previously by HPLC, with a complete separation of the most active enantiomer (RSR)-nadolol, on a column packed with perphenyl carbamoylated beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) immobilized onto silica gel. In this study, continuous separation of the target enantiomer of (RSR)-nadolol from its racemic mixture (which is a ternary mixture in the chromatographic system) was studied by non-linear SMB chromatography. Different regions of (2, 3) and (1, 2) complete separation regime were determined in the (m2, m3) region and the effect of non-linearity such as overall feed concentration and component composition on the separation performances was investigated. A direct simulation approach has been proposed to simulate the SMB separation performance for the pseudo-binary mixture of nadolol. The simulation was conducted on the basis of a shortcut method constituted only of the weak-key and strong-key components. The performance of the cyclic steady-state behavior of the SMB unit was predicted reasonably well. It was also discussed quantitatively that the complete separation region obtained from the shortcut method is a subset of the true complete separation region and the optimal separation conditions obtained differed slightly from the \"true\" separation.",

Clinical control at the first month was achieved in 78.3% and 71% of cases respectively (p=0.05). No statistical differences existed between groups for systemic adverse events. Four patients on brimonidine discontinued treatment due to local side effects. In the dorzolamide group, two patients left the treatment referring itching and three others left due to ocular allergy.",

    "57": "In anaesthetized female rats, the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline was intravenously infused (20 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) for 30 min or the ascending cervical sympathetic nerve trunk was intermittently stimulated (50 Hz, 1 s every tenth second) on one side for 30 min. The incorporation of [3H]leucine into trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-insoluble material was used as an index of protein synthesis. In response to isoprenaline, the [3H]leucine incorporation increased by 79% in the parotid glands and by 82% in the submandibular glands. The neuronal type NO-synthase inhibitor N-PLA, reduced (P < 0.001) this response to 26% and 20%, respectively. Sympathetic stimulation under alpha-adrenoceptor blockade increased the [3H]leucine incorporation by 192% in the parotid glands and by 35% in the submandibular glands. N-PLA reduced the corresponding percentage figures to 86% (P < 0.01) and 8% (P < 0.05). When tested in the parotid glands, the non-selective NO-synthase inhibitor L-NAME reduced (P < 0.01) the nerve-evoked response to 91%. The increase in [3H]leucine incorporation in response to sympathetic stimulation under beta-adrenoceptor blockade was not affected by N-PLA in the parotid (139% versus 144%) and submandibular glands (39% versus 34%). In non-stimulated glands, the [3H]leucine incorporation was not influenced by the NO-synthase inhibitors. In conclusion, beta-adrenoceptor mediated salivary gland protein synthesis is largely dependent on NO generation by neuronal type NO-synthase, most likely of parenchymal origin.",

Oxysterol-resistant HL60 cells were generated by continuous exposure to three different oxysterols-25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC), 7-beta-hydroxycholesterol (7beta-OHC) and 7-keto-cholesterol (7kappa-C). We investigated the effects of 25-OHC, 7beta-OHC, 7kappa-C and the apoptotic agent staurosporine on these cells. The effect of the calcium channel blocker nifedipine on oxysterol cytotoxicity was also investigated. Differential display and real-time PCR were used to quantitate gene expression of oxysterol-sensitive and -resistant cells. Our results demonstrate that resistance to the cytotoxic effects of oxysterols is relatively specific to the type of oxysterol, and that the cytotoxicity of 25-OHC but not that of 7beta-OHC and 7kappa-C, appears to occur by a calcium dependent mechanism. Oxysterol-resistant cells demonstrated no significant difference in the expression of several genes previously implicated in oxysterol resistance, but expressed the bcl-2 gene at significantly lower levels than those observed in control cells. We identified three novel genes differentially expressed in resistant cells when compared to HL60 control cells. Taken together, the results of this study reveal potentially novel mechanisms of oxysterol cytotoxicity and resistance, and indicate that cytotoxicity of 25-OHC, 7beta-OHC and 7kappa-C occur by independent, yet overlapping mechanisms.",

Intravenous injection of eugenosedin-A significantly caused dose-dependent decreases in the mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The effects of eugenosedin-A-decreased blood pressure and heart rate in SHR were more potent than in WKY. In in vitro experiments, eugenosedin-A competitively antagonized the serotonin-, norepinephrine- and clonidine-induced vasocontraction in a concentration-dependent manner in isolated thoracic aorta of WKY and SHR. We also observed that eugenosedin-A competitively antagonized the isoproterenol-induced positive inotropic effects in a concentration-dependent manner in the isolated left atrium of WKY and SHR. These findings clearly suggested that eugenosedin-A possesses alpha1/alpha2, beta1 and 5-HT2A receptor-blocking activities. The order of pA2 values in isolated tissues of WKY was 5-HT2A > alpha1/alpha2 > beta1. However, the order of pA2 values in isolated tissues of SHR was alpha1/alpha2 > 5-HT2A > beta1. Similarly, we found that the in vitro functional activity of eugenosedin-A is quite different between WKY and SHR. On the other hand, in the isolated rabbit ear artery sensitized with 16 mmol/l K+, eugenosedin-A antagonized 5-nonyloxytryptamine- and serotonin-induced vasocontractions, indicating that it also blocked 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptors. In radioligand binding experiments, eugenosedin-A had significant binding affinities on alpha1/alpha2, beta1, 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptors. Finally, we suggest that the hypotensive effects of eugenosedin-A can be attributed to its multiple actions on the blockade of 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, alpha and beta1 receptors in both WKY and SHR strains.",

Therefore, in the present study, tracheal responsiveness to isoprenaline and also beta-adrenergic receptor blockade were studied in sensitized guinea pigs. An experimental model of asthma was induced in guinea pigs by sensitization of animals with injection and inhalation of ovalbumin (OA). The responses of tracheal chains of sensitized and control animals to cumulative concentrations of isoprenaline (I) in the absence and presence of 10 nmol/l propranolol were measured, and the effective concentration of I causing 50% of maximum response (EC50 I) was obtained. The propranolol blockade (CR - 1) was calculated by: (post-propranolol EC50 I/EC50 I) - 1. Tracheal responses of sensitized and control animals to cumulative concentrations of methacholine (M) were also measured and EC50 M were obtained. The tracheal responses of sensitized guinea pig to isoprenaline was significantly higher than that of the control animals (EC50 I for sensitized and control animals were 0.24 +/- 0.04 and 0.58 +/- 0.07 micromol/l, respectively; p < 0.001). The beta-adrenergic receptor blockade by propranolol (CR - 1) was also significantly higher in sensitized guinea pigs than that of the control animals (p < 0.001).

Specific binding of [(3)H]-CGP12177 comprised 80 +/- 0.2% (n = 11) and 94 +/- 0.2% (n = 16) of the total binding in washed heart and lung homogenates, respectively. Concentration-dependent displacement of [(3)H]-CGP12177 binding from beta-adrenoceptors in both preparations was observed with nine different beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Levobetaxolol, betaxolol, CGP-20712A, levobunolol, and timolol yielded bi-phasic (two-site-fit) competition curves in the heart, while CGP-20712A, ICI-118551 and levobunolol produced bi-phasic curves in the lung preparation. The high-affinity component of [(3)H]-CGP12177 binding in the heart and lung reflected binding to beta(1)-receptors and beta(2)-receptors, respectively. The binding inhibition parameters (IC(50)s) for displacement of [(3)H]-CGP12177 from these predominantly high-affinity sites were: levobetaxolol (24.9 +/- 1.6 nM heart, 4810 +/- 367 nM lung), racemic betaxolol (37.9 +/- 8.7 mM heart; 8840 +/- 424 mM lung), CGP-20712A (4.6 +/- 0.9 nM heart; 171,000 +/- 109,000 nM lung), ICI-118551 (9230 +/- 3240 nM heart; 2.9 +/- 0.6 nM lung), levobunolol (42 +/- 15 nM heart, 0.3 +/- 0.2 nM lung), (l)-timolol (3.1 nM heart, 2.9 +/- 1.5 nM lung), ICI-215001 (5840 +/- 114 nM heart; 26100 +/- 3200 nM lung), BRL-37344 (83,300 +/- 2660 nM heart; 13,200 +/- 1250 lung).

We observed non-stimulated (basal water absorption, BWA) water flux through the isolated pelvic patch in vitro in Japanese tree frog (Hyla japonica). We found that water flux through non-stimulated skin from the pelvic patch was greater in males than females. This water flux was confirmed as BWA by observing no effect following the in vitro administration of propranolol and [adamantaneacetyl(1), O-Et-D-Tyr(2), Val(1), aminobutyryl(6), Arg(8, 9)] vasopressin, which are a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist and a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, respectively. We further examined this phenomenon following gonadectomy, treatment with sex hormones (E2, 17beta-estradiol; TP, testosterone propionate), estrogenic chemicals (BPA, bisphenol A; MTX, methoxychlor) or prolactin (PRL, a hormone regulated by sex hormones that has osmoregulatory activity). Ovariectomy increased BWA in females. Injection (in vivo treatment) of E2 or PRL reduced BWA in males, whereas TP injection increased BWA in females. However, the in vitro addition of E2, TP, or PRL to the Ringer's solution on the serosal side of the ventral skin patch did not alter BWA. Subsequently, we injected (in vivo treatment) BPA or MTX, environmental chemical contaminants with known hormonal actions in mammals. Injection of BPA or MTX reduced BWA in males as observed following treatment with E2. These results provide the first evidence of sexual dimorphism in BWA through the isolated pelvic patch. The gonad appears essential for observed sexual dimorphism in BWA, and we hypothesize that sex hormones regulate the release of PRL, that in turn influences BWA indirectly. E2 is known to exert a specific stimulatory effect on PRL secretion. In addition, we have observed that some endocrine disrupting contaminants also eliminate the sexual dimorphism in BWA observed in the Japanese tree frog.",

Drugs were found to bind negligibly or reversibly or were retained on the liposome surface. Cationic amphiphilic drugs fell into the last class and correlated with drugs that induce phospholipidosis in vivo. To a first approximation, a single-site model yielded apparent binding affinities that adequately described a drug's dose-dependent binding to liposome surfaces. Affinities ranged at least 1000-fold within the drug panel. A liposome's drug-binding capacity and affinity depended on both the lipid headgroup and the drug's structure. Although a drug's charge state generally dominated whether or not it remained bound to the liposome, subtle structural differences between members of certain drug families led to them having widely differing binding affinities. A comparison between the dissociation of drugs from liposome surfaces by Biacore and the lipid retention measurements determined by a parallel artificial membrane permeability assay was drawn.

We failed to observe any significant changes in the microcirculatory parameters in patients with stage III EH. Treatment with prolonged action metoprolol led to increase in the number of patients with normocirculatory type of microcirculation primarily due to the decrease in the prevalence of hyperemic type. We conclude that prolonged action metoprolol does not alter microcirculation in patients with EF.

The present study evaluates beta(2)-AR mRNA level, number, subtype and the cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) response to isoproterenol (iso) in the human airway epithelial cell lines 16HBE14o(-), Calu-3 and A549, using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), radioligand binding studies, [(3)H]-radioimmunoassay and immunocytochemical staining. After 4-5 days in culture, all three cell types produced beta(2)-AR mRNA and protein at a magnitude of gene expression levels Calu-3>or=16HBE14o(-)>A549, whereas control cells Cos-1 and Caco-2 were negative. The beta(2)-AR adenylate cyclase system was highly expressed and functional in the human airway epithelial cells Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-). The mean beta(2)-AR density (B(max)), equilibrium dissociation constant (K(D)), and the percentage of beta-AR subtypes assessed by radioligand binding were approximately 9908+/-1127 and 6423+/-895 binding sites/cell, 32+/-2.7 pM and 25+/-1.1 pM, and approximately 100% in Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-)cells, respectively. However, in the alveolar cell type A549 the cell surface beta(2)-AR was virtually undetectable by (-)-[(125)I]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding. Stimulation of cultured cells with (-)-isoproterenol enhanced the basal cyclic AMP accumulation only in Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-) cells, which was blocked by the beta(2)-selective antagonist ICI 118,551, but not by the beta(1)-selective antagonist CGP 20712A, confirming functional coupling of the beta(2)-AR to adenylate cyclase in these cells. Immunocytochemical staining localised the receptor on the cell membrane and the cytoplasm in Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-) cells, while it was confined to the cytoplasm only in A549 cells. In conclusion, the beta(2)-AR expression and its functional coupling to adenylyl cyclase was very high in the human airway epithelial cells Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-), but not in A549, suggesting that the cell lines Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-) present suitable models to study function and regulation of the beta-adrenoceptor signalling in the respiratory system.",

Erythrocyte surface architectonics was studied by phase-contrast microscopy. Fixation in 0.5% solution of glutar aldehyde was used, preparation \"squashed drop\" was prepared. In all preparations adrenalin hydrochloride and obzidan were used in equimolar final concentrations of 4.10(-5) M. The mean morphologic index of transformation that reflects the shift to stomatocytosis or to echinocytosis was estimated to characterize integrally erythrocyte surface architectonics. The cytoskeleton was studied by the modified method of Chentosov's et al. The integral optic density was evaluated on imaging analyzer of Ista-Videotest company (St-Petersburg).", 
    "159": "In healthy persons there was a correlation between erythrocyte surface architectonics and cytoskeleton under modulation of adrenergic system. Adrenalin-induced decrease of cytoskeletal proteins correlated with the shift to stomatocytosis. In NABA erythrocyte surface architectonics was characterized by a pronounced shift to stomatocytosis. This shift was accompanied with the most pronounced decrease of cytoskeletal proteins and it reduced in remission. In ABA manifestation of the shift was minimal and did not depend on the phase of the disease. In ABA no changes in erythrocyte surface architectonics in the presence of adrenalin were revealed. In the same conditions a decrease in cytoskeletal proteins was found.", 
    "160": "A correlation was found between erythrocyte surface architectonics and cytoskeleton in healthy persons. In ABA, under modulation of adrenergic system by adrenalin dissociation was revealed between receptor and cytoskeletal mechanisms of cell form induction. This dissociation does not depend on the phase of the disease and is thought to be one of the important postreceptor disorders typical for this variant of the disease.",

OP-41483alpha-CD restored the ability of 10(-3) M terbutaline to stimulate alveolar fluid clearance. The effect of OP-41483alpha-CD was consistent with the effect of atenolol, a beta(1)-adrenergic antagonist. The effect of OP-41483alpha-CD on alveolar fluid clearance was unchanged in lungs inflated with nitrogen. Prostaglandin E (PGE)(1) and PGE(2) analogues had similar effects to OP-41483alpha-CD on alveolar fluid clearance.",

The relative risk of cancer associated with beta-blocker use was estimated using a Cox model adjusted on gender and age. Ever- vs never-use of beta-blockers and duration of exposure to the drug were analyzed as time-dependent variables. In addition, the standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated using the corresponding age- and gender-adjusted cancer incidences in the French general population.",

During the follow-up period, representing 8,466 person-years, incident cancer cases were 15 and 59 in beta-blocker ever-users versus never-users, respectively. Using the Cox model, the overall relative risk of cancer was 0.51 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.29-0.90) in the beta-blocker ever-users versus never-users (p=0.02), with a 6% decrease per year of use (95% CI: 1%-12%; p=0.03).

    "169": "Certain physiological changes caused by aerobic exercise can alter the pharmacokinetics of some drugs. A systematic review of the pharmacokinetic changes that can affect drugs as a result of aerobic exercise is provided. Eleven commonly used drugs are reviewed for their potential interaction with exercising patients. Serum concentrations of two beta-blocking agents, atenolol and propranolol, and one antibiotic, doxycycline, have shown to increase as a result of exercise. No pharmacokinetic changes have been found in exercising patients taking carvedilol or verapamil. Patients who exercise after taking digoxin experience a decreased digoxin serum concentration with an increased skeletal muscle concentration. The clearance of theophylline has been shown to decrease resulting in an increase in plasma half-life during exercise. The risk of hypoglycaemia may increase when patients with diabetes mellitus inject insulin into a muscle just prior to exercising that muscle. Increasing physical activity in patients taking warfarin has been shown to decrease the international normalised ratio. Much is still unknown regarding the interactions that exist between exercise and drug therapy. More studies need to be completed in this area before definite conclusions are made and clinical relevance can be established. Clinicians should be aware that the potential for such interactions exists, especially for drugs with a narrow therapeutic range and in patients who participate in extreme sporting activities.", 
    "170": "Long-term use of drugs that suppress aqueous humor formation, such as timolol and dorzolamide, or that redirect aqueous humor outflow from the trabecular meshwork, such as prostaglandin F2alpha analogues, could cause underperfusion of the trabecular meshwork and a secondary decrease in outflow facility. We investigated the mechanism of suppression of aqueous humor formation by timolol in monkey eyes by measuring aqueous humor ascorbate levels. We also determined whether suppression of aqueous humor formation with and without redirection of aqueous humor away from the trabecular meshwork could lead to a subsequent reduction in outflow facility, and whether this reduction was correlated with increased fibronectin levels in anterior chamber aqueous humor. In cynomolgus monkeys, unilateral dose/aqueous humor formation response curves were generated for timolol, dorzolamide, and a combination of timolol + dorzolamide. Aqueous humor formation and/or outflow facility were measured in both eyes after approximately four days, four weeks and seven weeks of twice daily treatment with 3.5 microg timolol + 1.0 mg dorzolamide to one eye and 30% DMSO to the other. In some monkeys, 5 microg prostaglandin F2alpha-isopropyl ester (PG) was added to timolol + dorzolamide for 4-week treatments. Intraocular pressure and corneal endothelial transfer coefficients (k(a)) were also measured at four weeks. Aqueous humor fibronectin levels were determined in four monkeys after approximately 9.5 weeks of timolol + dorzolamide treatment. Aqueous humor formation, intraocular pressure, and aqueous humor ascorbate levels were also determined in rhesus monkeys at baseline and after a single unilateral topical administration of 25 microg timolol. Compared to baseline for the same eye, aqueous humor formation was significantly decreased in treated eyes at all doses of timolol and at 1.8 and 4 mg dorzolamide. Compared to the opposite control eye, aqueous humor formation was lower in treated eyes after 3.5 and 5 microg timolol and after all doses of dorzolamide. Aqueous humor formation after treatment with 3.5 microg timolol + 1.0 mg dorzolamide was decreased in treated vs. control eyes, after four days and was suppressed in both treated and control eyes after four weeks of treatment, but not when PG was added. There was no difference in k(a) values with or without the addition of PG. Intraocular pressure was significantly lower in both treated and control eyes vs. baseline after approximately 6.5 weeks treatment with timolol + dorzolamide when taken 2 hr after the last dose and after approximately 3.5 weeks treatment with timolol + dorzolamide + PG when measured 6 hr after the last dose. Outflow facility after treatment with timolol + dorzolamide was unchanged after four days, tended to be lower in the treated vs. control eyes after four and seven weeks, and was significantly lower in treated vs. control eyes after four weeks treatment with timolol + dorzolamide + PG (0.352 +/- 0.052 vs. 0.515 +/- 0.096 microl min(-1) mmHg(-1), p < or = 0.02). Both treated vs. control eye aqueous humor fibronectin levels were below the level of detection for our assay (0.01 microg ml(-1)). The 25 microg timolol dose decreased ipsilateral, but not contralateral intraocular pressure (12.6 +/- 1.7 vs. 15.2 +/- 0.9; p < 0.05) and aqueous humor formation (1.40 +/- 0.08 vs. 2.03 +/- 0.09 microg ml(-1), p < or = 0.01). There was no difference in anterior chamber ascorbate levels in treated vs. control eyes or compared to their respective baselines. Our findings indicate that timolol affects neither ciliary epithelial transport of ascorbate nor aqueous fibronectin levels. Our data also indicate that decreasing aqueous humor formation over a period of time can lead to reduction in outflow facility, particularly when combined with therapy that redirects aqueous from the trabecular meshwork. Future intraocular pressure-lowering therapies for glaucoma may better be directed at enhancing flow through the trabecular pathway as opposed to decreasing aqueous humor formation or rerouting aqueous humor away from the trabecular meshwork.", 
    "171": "Many polymorphisms have been described for the genes encoding the beta 1, beta 2, and alpha 2c-adrenoceptors that result in altered signaling and/or regulatory properties of the receptors. Several studies have investigated whether these properties affect the cardiovascular function of these receptors in mice or in humans, but have yielded mixed results. Some studies suggest that adrenoceptor polymorphisms might alter the risk for heart failure and the response to treatment with beta-blockers. However, the complex haplotypes resulting from combinations of individual polymorphisms have not yet been investigated, and firm conclusions or recommendations cannot be made because of the low patient numbers in each of the study programs.",

The methodological quality of the majority of trials was unsatisfactory. The principal shortcomings were high dropout rates and insufficient reporting and handling of this problem in the analysis. Overall, the 26 placebo-controlled trials showed clear short-term effects of propranolol over placebo. Due to the lack of studies with long-term follow up, it is unclear whether these effects are stable after stopping propranolol. The 47 comparisons with calcium antagonists, other beta-blockers, and a variety of other drugs did not yield any clear-cut differences. Sample size was, however, insufficient in most trials to establish equivalence.",

    "179": "Cardiac surgery results in significant impairment of beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) function and is a cause of depressed myocardial function after surgery. We previously demonstrated that acute administration of beta AR blocker during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in an animal model of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery attenuates beta AR desensitization, whereas chronic oral beta-blockade therapy in patients undergoing CABG surgery does not prevent it. Therefore we hypothesized that acute administration of metoprolol during CABG surgery would prevent acute myocardial beta AR desensitization. A placebo-controlled initial phase (n = 72) was performed whereby patients were randomized to either metoprolol 10 mg or placebo immediately before CPB. Then a second dose-finding study was performed where patients received 20 mg (n = 20) or 30 mg (n = 20) of metoprolol. Hemodynamic monitoring, atrial membrane adenylyl cyclase activity, atrial beta AR density, and postoperative outcomes were measured. All groups showed similar decreases in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (13%-24%). Cardiac output remained similar in all 4 groups throughout the intraoperative and postoperative period. In addition, patients receiving metoprolol 20 or 30 mg had less supraventricular arrhythmias 24 h postoperatively compared with patients receiving metoprolol 10 mg or placebo. Therefore, unlike our previous animal model of CABG surgery, metoprolol did not attenuate myocardial beta AR desensitization.", 
    "180": "We investigated whether IV metoprolol given during cardiac surgery attenuates myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) desensitization. Although metoprolol did not reduce beta AR desensitization, the incidence of supraventricular arrhythmias was reduced by 75% in patients receiving 20 mg or 30 mg metoprolol.", 
    "181": "The present study was carried out to determine whether beneficial effects of carvedilol in congestive heart failure (CHF) are mediated via its beta-adrenergic blocking, antioxidant, and/or alpha-adrenergic blocking action. Rabbits with heart failure induced by rapid cardiac pacing were randomized to receive subcutaneous carvedilol, metoprolol, propranolol plus doxazosin, or placebo pellets for 8 wk and compared with sham-operated rabbits without pacing. We found rapid cardiac pacing produced clinical heart failure, left ventricular dilation, and decline of left ventricular fractional shortening. This was associated with an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, decrease in left ventricular first derivative of left ventricular pressure, and myocyte hypertrophy. Tissue oxidative stress measured by GSH/GSSG was increased in the heart with increased oxidation product of mitochondrial DNA, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine, increase of Bax, decrease of Bcl-2, and increase of apoptotic myocytes as measured by anti-single-stranded DNA monoclonal antibody. Administration of carvedilol and metoprolol, which had no effect in sham animals, attenuated cardiac ventricular remodeling, cardiac hypertrophy, oxidative stress, and myocyte apoptosis in CHF. In contrast, propranolol plus doxazosin, which has less antioxidant effects, produced smaller effects on left ventricular function and myocyte apoptosis. In all animals, GSH/GSSG correlated significantly with changes of left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (r = -0.678, P < 0.0001), fractional shortening (r = 0.706, P < 0.0001), and apoptotic myocytes (r = -0.473, P = 0.0001). Thus our findings suggest antioxidant and antiapoptotic actions of carvedilol and metoprolol are important determinants of clinical beneficial effects of beta-receptors in the treatment of CHF.", 
    "182": "We characterized the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking property of mexiletine, a class Ib antiarrhythmic drug, on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing cloned human beta1-, beta2-, and beta3-adrenoceptors. In radioligand binding experiments, mexiletine (10 microM-1 mM) concentration-dependently displaced the specific binding of [125I]cyanopindolol to human beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors in the membrane fraction of the cells. High concentration (100 microM-1 mM) of mexiletine partially displaced the specific binding of [125I]cyanopindolol to human beta3-adrenoceptor. On the other hand, high concentration (300 microM and 1 mM) of lidocaine, another class Ib antiarrhythmic drug, partially displaced the specific binding of [125I]cyanopindolol to human beta1-adrenoceptor, whereas it did not affect the specific binding of [125I]cyanopindolol to human beta2- and beta3-adrenoceptors. Mexiletine (5, 50, and 500 microM) reduces basal adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) level and isoprenaline-induced cAMP accumulation on CHO cells stably expressing cloned human beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors. Lidocaine (10 and 100 microM and 1 mM) tend to reduce basal cAMP level on CHO cells stably expressing cloned human beta1-adrenoceptors, whereas the drug did not reduce the isoprenaline-induced cAMP accumulation on CHO cells stably expressing cloned human beta1-, beta2-, and beta3-adrenoceptors. Mexiletine and lidocaine have no effect on forskolin (0.1, 1, and 3 microM)-induced cAMP accumulation. These results demonstrate that mexiletine blocks the binding of agonists to beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors, and thereby attenuates the agonist-induced cAMP accumulation, and that the action of mexiletine as an antagonist of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors is independent of its antiarrhythmic property.", 
    "183": "The Losartan Intervention For End point reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study showed superiority of losartan over atenolol for reduction of composite risk of cardiovascular death, stroke, and myocardial infarction in hypertensives with left ventricular hypertrophy. We compared hazard ratios (HR) in 4287 and 685 participants who reported intakes of 1-7 and >8 drinks/week at baseline, respectively, with those in 4216 abstainers, adjusting for gender, age, smoking, exercise, and race. Within categories, clinical baseline characteristics, numbers randomized to losartan and atenolol, and blood pressure (BP) lowering were similar on the drug regimens. Overall BP control (<140/90 mmHg) at end of follow-up was similar in the categories. Composite end point rate was lower with 1-7 (24/1000 years; HR 0.87, P<0.05) and >8 drinks/week (26/1000 years; HR 0.80, NS) than in abstainers (27/1000 years). Myocardial infarction risk was reduced in both drinking categories (HR 0.76, P<0.05 and HR 0.29, P<0.001, respectively), while stroke risk tended to increase with >8 drinks/week (HR 1.21, NS). Composite risk was significantly reduced with losartan compared to atenolol only in abstainers (HR 0.81 95% confidence interval, CI (0.68, 0.96), P<0.05), while benefits for stroke risk reduction were similar among participants consuming 1-7 drinks/week (HR 0.73, P<0.05) and abstainers (HR 0.72, P<0.01). Despite different treatment benefits, alcohol-treatment interactions were nonsignificant. In conclusion, moderate alcohol consumption does not change the marked stroke risk reduction with losartan compared to atenolol in high-risk hypertensives. Alcohol reduces the risk of myocardial infarction, while the risk of stroke tends to increase with high intake.", 
    "184": "To assess the influence of age on changes in left ventricular (LV) mass and geometry during antihypertensive treatment, we related age to clinical and echocardiographic findings before and after 4 years of antihypertensive treatment in a subset of 560 hypertensive patients without known concurrent disease in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study, which randomized patients to blinded losartan- or atenolol-based treatment. Patients >/=65 years (older group) included more women and patients with isolated systolic hypertension or albuminuria (all P<0.05). Compared to patients <65 years, older patients had higher pulse pressure, LV mass, and prevalence of concentric hypertrophy at baseline (78 vs 69 mmHg, 234 vs 224 g, and 28 vs 16%, respectively, all P<0.01), while the mean blood pressure did not differ. Over 4 years, reductions in LV mass and the mean blood pressure were similar in both groups, but older patients more often had residual hypertrophy (31 vs 15%, P<0.001) with a preponderance of eccentric geometry. In multivariate analysis of 4-year change in LV mass controlling for baseline mass, larger hypertrophy reduction was associated with losartan treatment, while age, gender, body mass index, and 4-year change in pulse pressure and albuminuria did not enter (Multiple R (2)=0.40, P<0.001). Thus, in up-to-80-year-old hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, age did not significantly attenuate hypertrophy reduction during antihypertensive treatment, although residual hypertrophy was more prevalent in older patients as a consequence of higher initial LV mass.", 
    "185": "Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide. Although there is no cure for this chronic disease, medical treatment is aimed at reducing levels of intraocular pressure (IOP) using ocular hypotensive agents. Very often, patients require more than one IOP-reducing drug, resulting in complex medication regimens that may be difficult to maintain and that can lead to non-compliance. A fixed-combination (FC) ophthalmic solution consisting of the prostaglandin, latanoprost (0.005%), and the beta-blocker, timolol (0.5%), is now available. The primary mechanism of action of latanoprost is to increase uveoscleral outflow whereas timolol lowers IOP levels by decreasing the formation of aqueous humor in the ciliary epithelium. Due to the unique mechanism of action of latanoprost, once-daily dosing of one drop of FC latanoprost/timolol results in additional IOP reduction compared with either drug administered separately. FC latanoprost/timolol is well-tolerated and has a safety profile similar to that of its individual components. This combination drug provides a safe, effective and convenient alternative for the treatment of patients with elevated IOP levels uncontrolled with monotherapy.", 
    "186": "Nebivolol is a vasodilating beta-blocker, which can be distinguished from other beta-blockers by its haemodynamic profile. It combines beta-adrenergic blocking activity with a vasodilating effect mediated by the endothelial L-arginine nitric oxide (NO) pathway. The blood pressure lowering effect of nebivolol is linked to a reduction in peripheral resistance and an increase in stroke volume and preservation of cardiac output. The effects of nebivolol have been compared with other beta-blockers and also with other classes of antihypertensive agents. In general, response rates to treatment are higher and the frequency and severity of adverse events are either comparable or lower with nebivolol. Endothelium-derived NO is important in the regulation of large arterial stiffness, which in turn is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Therefore, antihypertensive drugs, such as nebivolol, that also improve endothelial function and decrease arterial stiffness, may contribute to a reduction in cardiovascular risk.", 
    "187": "Initial diagnosis of cavernous transformation of the portal vein (portal cavernoma) is rarely made in adults. Its main clinical manifestation is upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to variceal bleeding. More rarely, diagnosis is made from obstructive jaundice. In children, this condition is frequently associated to prehepatic portal hypertension and congenital anomalies, the most frequent of which are atrial septal defects or malformations of the biliary tract or of the inferior vena cava. We describe here a case of a 23-year-old female presenting with massive hematemesis due to the presence of esophageal and small intestinal varices. She had a cavernous transformation of the portal vein with prehepatic portal hypertension associated with heretofore unreported malformations such as right pulmonary hypoplasia, cardiac dextroposition, and right renal ectopia. A unifying hypothesis (e.g. an intrauterine vascular insult) to explain the pathogenesis of these defects seems unlikely. Appropriate tests failed to identify specific functional abnormalities in these organs. Although she bled more than once, the combination of sclerotherapy and beta-blockers has been, thus far, able to control the major clinical consequences of this disease.",

The indisputably effective measures include cessation of smoking, blood pressure control with appropriate medications, a Mediterranean diet, maritime omega-3 fatty acids, endurance sports, statin-based lipid management (LDL < 100 mg/dl, triglycerides < 200 mg/dl), a target BMI of 18.5-25, optimized diabetes management, use of platelet aggregation inhibitors, beta blockers and ACE inhibitors. Hormone replacement therapy or vitamin supplementation has been identified as ineffective or mildly dangerous. Other measures have either not become established, or only poorly so. Currently, implementation of the effective measures leaves much to be desired.

    "189": "In the present study, the susceptibility of knockout interleukin-6 (IL-6(-/-)) mice to various convulsant stimuli has been evaluated and compared with other three related mice strains. Animals were treated with chemical convulsants impairing the gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission [pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), picrotoxin, bicuculline, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM)], enhancing glutamatergic neurotransmission [N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3 hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) and kainic acid (KA)] or a K(+)channel blocker [4-aminopyridine (4-AP)]. The behavioural changes of such convulsant stimuli on IL-6(-/-) were observed and compared with those observed in C57, IL-6(+/+) and DBA/2 mice. The occurrence of clonic and/or tonic seizures was scored and statistically analysed to observe possible differences on seizure susceptibility. The IL-6(-/-) mice exhibited significantly higher seizure susceptibility to PTZ, beta-CCM, DMCM, NMDA, AMPA and KA than did the other mice strains, with the exception of DBA/2 mice. This study demonstrates that IL-6(-/-) mice possess an increased susceptibility to some convulsant stimuli. In particular, the major convulsant effects produced by NMDA, AMPA and KA suggest that the excitatory amino acid system is more active in the central nervous system (CNS) of IL-6(-/-) mice. The present data suggest that IL-6(-/-) mice might be a valid novel epileptic model for the study of pathophysiology and pharmacology of epileptic seizures.",

By Kaplan-Meier analysis the cumulative probability of achieving efficacy success (> or = 20% IOP decrease from baseline) was 33% at 6 months and 23% at 1 year after adding a third medication (Group A), and 43% at 6 months and 18% at 1 year after adding a fourth medication (Group B). Combining both efficacy and safety outcomes decreased the cumulative probability of success to 27% and 14% in Group A, and 31% and 14% for Group B, at 6 months and 1 year respectively.", 
    "197": "Addition of a third and fourth antiglaucoma medication produces a clinically significant reduction in IOP in about 40 to 60% of patients at any single time point. However, the cumulative probability of success including safety outcomes is relatively poor at 6 months and 1 year. This suggests that adding another antiglaucoma medication to a regimen of two or three medications frequently does not achieve a significant (> or = 20%) fall in IOP.", 
    "198": "The purpose of this review was to describe important developments in the selection of beta-blockers in heart failure.", 
    "199": "The superiority of carvedilol over metoprolol tartrate in one clinical trial is demonstrated, and multiple studies investigated the potential mechanisms of benefit. Current practice patterns still demonstrate the importance of understanding barriers to the effective use of beta-blocking agents.", 
    "200": "There are continued refinements in the choice of beta-blockers in heart failure, but clearly an important remaining challenge is to modify health care delivery in an effort to maximize adherence to guidelines."
