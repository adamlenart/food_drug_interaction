    "0": "Norepinephrine, epinephrine, and histamine cause a rapid increase in the concentration of adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) in a tumor astrocyte cell line derived from a primary culture of a human glioblastoma multiforme. The catecholamine-induced increase in cAMP is dependent on the cell density, being far greater in cells in the log phase of growth than in cells near terminal density. The response to norepinephrine is inhibited 50% by 0.01 muM propranolol, a blocking agent of beta-adrenergic receptors. In contrast, the effect of histamine on cAMP concentration varies only slightly from log-phase growth to terminal density, and is not inhibited by 10 muM propranolol. The results suggest that astrocytoma cells have independent receptors for catecholamines and histamine. Further, if the astrocytoma cell is an adequate model of the normal glial cell, these results suggest that astrocytes in human cerebral cortex may be sensitive to norepinephrine and histamine.", 
    "1": "Guinea-pig colon was shown to contain both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. Isoprenaline-induced relaxation was mediated by beta-adrenoceptors alone whilst that produced by phenylephrine was mediated by both alpha- and beta- adrenoceptors.", 
    "2": "1. The blood flow to the splenic artery of dogs anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone was measured under constant pressure perfusion with the animal's own blood led from the femoral artery.2. Immediately after release of occlusion there was a rapid increase of inflow rate above the pre-occlusion level which then oscillated up and down. In a majority of cases such oscillatory responses continued for a while but progressively diminished during a period of about 6 min.3. This post-occlusive oscillatory response was not modified by either neural or autonomic receptor blocking agents such as tetrodotoxin, guanethidine, phentolamine, propranolol, atropine and methysergide.4. In the cases with a relatively short-lasting response, the selective administration of adenosine into the splenic artery caused a distinct enhancement of the oscillation.5. These results suggest that adenosine may play an important role in the post-occlusive oscillatory response of the splenic circulation.", 
    "3": "The addition of a hypertonic bathing medium to duck erythrocytes results in an initial instantaneous phase of osmotic shrinkage and, when the [K](o) of the hypertonic solution is larger than \"normal,\" in a second, more prolonged phase, the volume regulatory phase. During the latter, which also requires extracellular Na, the cells swell until they approach their initial isotonic volume. The increase in cell volume during the volume regulatory phase is accomplished by a gain in the cell content of K, Cl, and H(2)O. There is also a smaller increase in the Na content of the cell. Potassium is accumulated against an electrochemical gradient and is therefore actively transported into the cell. This accumulation is associated with an increase, although dissimilar, in both K influx and efflux. Changes in cell size during the volume regulatory phase are not altered by 10(-4)M ouabain, although this concentration of ouabain does change the cellular cation content. The response is independent of any effect of norepinephrine. The changes in cell size during the volume regulatory phase are discussed as the product of a volume controlling mechanism identical in principle to the one reported in the previous paper which controls cell volume in hypotonic media. Similarly, this mechanism can regulate cell size, when the Na-K exchange, ouabain-inhibitable pump mechanism is blocked.", 
    "4": "1. Propranolol, in doses of 25-100 mug/kg, blocks contractions of the nictitating membrane to nerve stimulation but not to injected noradrenaline.2. This adrenergic neurone blocking action of propranolol is antagonized by amphetamine.3. It is also reversed by raising the dose of propranolol to amounts exceeding 0.5 mg/kg.4. Still larger amounts potentiate the responses of the nictitating membrane to both submaximal stimulation of the cervical sympathetic nerve and to injected noradrenaline.5. The (+) isomer of propranolol produced adrenergic nerve blockade and some degree of hypotension without blocking cardiac beta-adrenoceptors.6. The relevance of adrenergic neurone blockade to the hypotensive effect of propranolol is discussed.", 
    "5": "1. Neurones in the supraoptic nucleus were examined for their responsiveness to microiontophoretically applied monoamines and cholinomimetic agents. One hundred and sixty-one of the 749 neurones recorded were antidromically identified as neurosecretory cells.2. The monoamines, dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin, reduced the activity of all cells which responded.3. Reduction in activity following noradrenaline administration was antagonized by the beta-adrenergic blocking agent MJ-1999 and potentiated by desmethylimipramine.4. Acetylcholine produced either a decrease or an increase in activity of responsive cells with depression the predominant result. Both the depressant and the excitatory response to acetylcholine were seen in individual neurosecretory cells which were depressed by noradrenaline.5. Application of acetyl-beta-methylcholine and carbaminoylcholine consistently resulted in depression of all responsive cells, while nicotine excited the majority of responsive cells. Both types of response were observed on the same neurosecretory cell.6. The depressant response was antagonized by the muscarinic blocking agent atropine while the excitatory response was antagonized by the nicotinic blocking agent dihydro-beta-erythroidine. Responses to acetylcholine were potentiated by the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine.7. The data indicate that noradrenaline-containing terminals on these neurosecretory cells are likely to inhibit their discharge rate, while the presumed cholinergic terminals might function as either excitatory or inhibitory, depending on the receptor activated.8. These results support the hypothesis that ADH release is related to the neuronal activity of the supraoptic neurosecretory cell."
