    "4": "Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was measured in slice preparations of the Fallopian tube fimbria, using videomicroscopy with a high-speed (500 Hz) camera in guinea pigs that were treated with \u03b2-oestradiol benzoate (\u03b2E2B) and medroxy progesterone (mPRG). In non-ovulating guinea pigs at 4 weeks of age, the CBF of the fimbria was high (17.8 Hz). In sexually mature guinea pigs (12-16 weeks of age) with constant ovulation, the CBF varied from 12 Hz to 16 Hz. The in vivo administration of both ICI-182,780 (a blocker of \u03b2E2 receptors) and mifepristone (a blocker of PRG receptors) induced high CBF (17.4 Hz). The administration of \u03b2E2B at a low (3.2 mg/kg/day) or high (32 mg/kg/day) dose decreased the CBF to 14.5 Hz or 11 Hz, respectively. ICI-182,780 abolished the \u03b2E2B-induced changes in CBF and decreased CBF to 12 Hz. The administration of mPRG (6.4 mg/kg/day) decreased CBF to 12.5 Hz. Mifepristone abolished this mPRG-induced decrease in CBF and maintained the CBF at 15 Hz. However, administering both \u03b2E2B and mPRG increased CBF to 17.5 Hz, suggesting that \u03b2E2B inhibits mPRG actions and vice versa. To confirm the interactions between \u03b2E2B and mPRG, we administered both \u03b2E2B and mPRG to guinea pigs that were pretreated for 1.5 days with either mPRG (6.4 mg/kg/day) or \u03b2E2B (3.2 mg/kg/day). Prior treatment with \u03b2E2B or mPRG prevented the increase in CBF that was otherwise by \u03b2E2B plus mPRG, and maintained the CBF at 14.5 Hz or 13 Hz, respectively. The administration of \u03b2E2B plus mPRG still induced the expression of PRG receptors, indicating that the highest CBF is not the result of no expression of the receptors. In the beating cilia of the fimbria, the signals that are activated by the \u03b2E2 and PRG receptors are proposed to antagonize each other in regulating the frequency.",

Subsequently, patients with left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction < or = 35%, NYHA class III-IV and QRS interval > or =120 msec were assigned to CRT. Both CRT and NO-CRT patients underwent a long-term follow-up of 7 years (1193.98 +/- 924 days), while efforts to up titrate the carvedilol dose were continued during the second phase (471 + 310 days). Phase 1 was completed by 84 patients (79%), and 15 (18%) underwent CRT. The mean carvedilol dose in the CRT group was 19.0 +/- 17.8 mg, against 32.7 +/- 19.1 mg in the remaining 69 patients (P = 0.018). At the end of phase 2, CRT patients presented a significantly greater variation of increasing in the carvedilol dose than NO-CRT patients (+20.0 +/- 19.8 mg vs. -0.3 +/- 20.5 mg; P = 0.015), a greater NYHA class reduction (-0.8 +/- 0.6 vs. -0.2 +/- 0.7; P = 0.011), and a greater increase in LV ejection fraction (10.8 +/- 9 vs. 3.1 +/- 6.1; P = 0.018).",

Propranolol has a blocking effect on the sodium current (\"membrane-stabilizing\" effect), and it has been hypothesized that the efficacy of nadolol might be due to a similar effect. Accordingly, we used whole-cell patch-clamp recording to assess propranolol, nadolol, and metoprolol block of wild-type or mutant cardiac sodium channels (Nav1.5) coexpressed with \u03b21 subunit in tsA201 cells. Nadolol had a \u223c20% non-use-dependent blocking effect on peak sodium current and no effect on the persistent current evoked by the LQT3 mutant A1330D, whereas propranolol blocked Nav1.5 in a use-dependent manner and reduced A1330D persistent current. Metoprolol had no effect on either the peak or persistent current. Analysis of the biophysical properties of the channel revealed that both nadolol and propranolol cause hyperpolarizing shifts on voltage dependence of activation and steady-state inactivation, whereas metoprolol shifts only the activation curve. These results provide partial explanation for the differences between nadolol and metoprolol but do not explain the similar clinical efficacy of nadolol and propranolol.",

To assess differences in age of onset, hypertension duration, type of drug, treatment compliance, and salt-free diet compliance between patients with stroke and myocardial infarction. Patients and Methods. The study was conducted in 3 hospitals in Baghdad between June 2010 and June 2011. First group includes 81 stroke patients (36 females and 45 males), age ranges between (33-82 years). Second group includes 110 myocardial infarction patients (46 females and 64 males), ages ranges from (23-76 years). Results. Salt-free diet noncompliance was seen in 69% and 62% of Myocardial infarction and stroke groups, respectively. Silent hypertension was seen in 6.3% and 19.7% of myocardial infarction and stroke groups, respectively. Noncompliant on antihypertensive therapy was seen in 61%, 71%, and 48% of the total, myocardial infarction, and stroke groups, respectively. The drug type was 24% angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, 18.8% combined drugs, 16.2% Beta Blocker, 11% angiotensin 11 receptor blocker, 10.4% calcium channel blocker and 7.3% diuretic. In stroke group, the commonest drug was 23% angiotensin converting inhibitor and the least (5%) was angiotensin receptor blocker. In myocardial infarction group, the commonest drug was 25% Angiotensin Converting Inhibitor and the least (8%) was diuretic. Discussion and Conclusion. Silent hypertension was high in Iraq. Salt-free diet noncompliance was high in both groups; drug noncompliance was significantly higher in patients with myocardial infarction.

    "24": "Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) is a significant risk factor for the development of glaucoma. Timolol maleate is a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent and it is used for the treatment of glaucoma in order to reduce the elevated IOP that is characteristic of this eye disease. Systemic toxicity from topical timolol occurs more frequently than local toxicity and can affect the pulmonary, cardiac and central nervous systems. The objective of the present study, therefore, was to formulate multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) liposomal preparations of timolol maleate using their advantage of being less toxic compared with non-liposome-based drugs to be applied topically and to evaluate the in vivo performance of the prepared liposomes to extend the time of reduced IOP of glaucomatous rabbit's eye measured using a standard Shiotz tonometer. The encapsulation efficiency of MLVs was measured using a spectrophotometric technique. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to monitor the effects of timolol maleate in the absence and presence of cholesterol on liposome thermal behaviour. Positively charged MLVs of timolol in the presence of a lower amount of cholesterol (DPPC(7):Chol(2):Timolol(2):SA(1) molar ratio) were found to be superior compared with other formulations in extending the ocular hypotensive effect approximately for 1 week (160 h) which encourages its physiological effectiveness. The increase of the cholesterol molar ratio in the prepared liposomal formulations serves to decrease the permeability of the lipid bilayer that is manifested by a low rate of drug release, an increased percentage of entrapment efficiency and a consequently lower bioavailability.", 
    "25": "The compatibility of fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF) in drug permeation studies employing the phospholipid vesicle-based permeation assay (PVPA) model was confirmed by a set of different integrity indicators. Neither calcein permeability nor electrical resistance were found significantly changed indicating unaffected barrier tightness. Furthermore, the release of phospholipid from the barriers in contact with FaSSIF was negligible, although sodium taurocholate disappeared from the donor - possibly due to transfer into the barrier. Visual examination of the barrier structure by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) revealed no changes. The model drugs, cimetidine, nadolol, ketoprofen and griseofulvin showed either slightly enhanced or unchanged permeability values in the presence of FaSSIF. This may be attributed to micellar encapsulation and/or slight changes in barrier characteristics. Particularly for poorly soluble drugs, FaSSIF appeared favourable in terms of markedly improved recovery. Moreover, utilisation of BSA in the receiver compartment seems to augment this beneficial effect on recovery rate. It is likely that this experimental set-up affords better sink conditions in the receiver phase, which results in higher fluxes. Overall, a combination of FaSSIF in the donor phase and BSA in the receiver phase facilitates improved experimental output.", 
    "26": "The recent years have brought about a marked increase in the number of people suffering from carbohydrate metabolism disturbances. This is primarily due to adverse changes in lifestyle, which consists of an improper diet, rich in simple carbohydrates and fats, and low physical activity. An increasing number of patients with diabetes resulted in the growth of a number of individuals suffering from diabetes-related complications, including cardiovascular diseases. Although, the first line treatment of cardiovascular disorders are beta-blockers, for many years their use in diabetic patients was questioned to the extent that diabetes was one of the major contraindication to these agents. These concerns stemmed primarily from the proven negative impact of first generation beta-blockers on carbohydrate metabolism. The aim of this study was to summarize the possibility of beta-blocker applications in type 2 diabetic patients suffering from cardiovascular disorders, which, in a non-diabetic population, are commonly treated with these agents, taking into account the diversity between various classes of beta-blockers. On the basis of published clinical trials and meta-analyses we discuss the impact of this group of agents on the development of new-onset diabetes, worsening of existing diabetes control, and the development and progression of diabetes-induced complications.",

She had instilled her topical timolol maleate approximately 30 minutes prior to each of these episodes. Topical timolol was discontinued and the conduction abnormality resolved. She was diagnosed as having intermittent sinus bradycardia with intermittent atrioventricular block, likely induced by topical beta-blocker therapy. Topical timolol maleate is an effective treatment for ocular hypertension, acting by reducing aqueous fluid production. However, it can induce systemic side effects and should be used with caution in patients with, or predisposed to, cardiac or respiratory depression.", 
    "28": "Autonomic dysfunction, including baroreceptor attenuation and sympathetic activation, has been reported in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and has been associated with increased mortality. We tested the hypotheses that exercise training (ET) in post-MI patients would normalize arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), and long-term ET would maintain the benefits in BRS and MSNA. Twenty-eight patients after 1 month of uncomplicated MI were randomly assigned to 2 groups, ET (MI-ET) and untrained. A normal control group was also studied. ET consisted of three 60-minute exercise sessions per week for 6 months. We evaluated MSNA (microneurography), blood pressure (automatic oscillometric method), heart rate (ECG), and spectral analysis of RR interval, systolic arterial pressure (SAP), and MSNA. Baroreflex gain of SAP-RR interval and SAP-MSNA were calculated using the \u03b1-index. At 3 to 5 days and 1 month after MI, MSNA and low-frequency SAP were significantly higher and BRS significantly lower in MI patients when compared with the normal control group. ET significantly decreased MSNA (bursts per 100 heartbeats) and the low-frequency component of SAP and significantly increased the low-frequency component of MSNA and BRS of the RR interval and MSNA. These changes were so marked that the differences between patients with MI and the normal control group were no longer observed after ET. MSNA and BRS in the MI-untrained group did not change from baseline over the same time period. ET normalizes BRS, low-frequency SAP, and MSNA in patients with MI. These improvements in autonomic control are maintained by long-term ET. These findings highlight the clinical importance of this nonpharmacological therapy based on ET in the long-term treatment of patients with MI.", 
    "29": "The interaction between human serum albumin (HSA) and two drugs - amlodipine and propranolol - was investigated using fluorescence, UV absorption and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. In addition, the binding site was established by applying molecular modeling technique. Fluorescence data suggest that amlodipine will quench the intrinsic fluorescence of HSA; whereas propranolol enhances the fluorescence of HSA. The binding constants for the interaction of amlodipine and propranolol with HSA were found to be 3.63\u00d710(5)M(-1) and 2.29\u00d710(4)M(-1), respectively. The percentage of secondary structure feature of each one of the HSA-bound drugs, i.e. the \u03b1-helix content, was estimated empirically by circular dichroism. The results indicated that amlodipine causes an increase, and that propranolol leads to a decrease in \u03b1-helix content of HSA. The spectroscopic analysis indicates that the binding mechanisms of the two drugs are different from each other. The data obtained by the molecular modeling study indicated that these drugs bind, with different affinity, to different sites located in subdomain IIA and IIIA.", 
    "30": "This review provides a systematic overview of the influence of the third generation beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on vascular and/or endothelial function at a cellular level as well as of the advantages of their application in hypertension, heart failure and coronary artery disease. Drugs antagonizing the beta-adrenoceptors have been in use for the treatment of hypertension for decades. In systolic heart failure and post-myocardial infarction, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were proven to be effective in decreasing the number of deaths and improving morbidity. However, betaadrenoceptor antagonists are a heterogeneous drug group, consisting of agents with different selectivity for adrenoceptors and/or additional effects in heart and peripheral circulation. Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists comprise a multitude of different agents, which may have additional properties exceeding the pure receptor blockade. These features may provide additional benefit in the treatment of hypertension. The third generation drug nebivolol exerts a nitric oxide-mediated vasodilating activity which has positive effects on intima and media thickness and arterial rigidity, a major risk factor in cardiovascular disease. Moreover, anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative properties have been detected for carvedilol and nebivolol, contributing to their additional value in treatment of hypertension and heart failure.",

    "36": "Cardiac fibroblasts are exposed to both cyclic strain and interstitial fluid flow in the myocardium. The balance of these stimuli is affected by fibrotic scarring, during which the fibroblasts transition to a myofibroblast phenotype. The present study investigates the mechanisms by which cardiac fibroblasts seeded in three-dimensional (3D) collagen gels differentiate between strain and fluid flow. Neonatal cardiac fibroblast-seeded 3D collagen gels were exposed to interstitial flow and/or cyclic strain and message levels of collagens type I and III, transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) were assessed. Flow was found to significantly increase and strain to decrease expression of myofibroblast markers. Corresponding immunofluorescence indicated that flow and strain differentially regulated \u03b1-SMA protein expression. The effect of flow was inhibited by exposure to losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker, and by introduction of shRNA constructs limiting AT1R expression. Blocking of TGF-\u03b2 also inhibited the myofibroblast transition, suggesting that flow-mediated cell signaling involved both AT1R and TGF-\u03b21. Reduced smad2 phosphorylation in response to cyclic strain suggested that TGF-\u03b2 is part of the mechanism by which cardiac fibroblasts differentiate between strain-induced and flow-induced mechanical stress. Our experiments show that fluid flow and mechanical deformation have distinct effects on cardiac fibroblast phenotype. Our data suggest a mechanism in which fluid flow directly acts on AT1R and causes increased TGF-\u03b21 expression, whereas cyclic strain reduces activation of smad proteins. These results have relevance to the pathogenesis and treatment of heart failure.",

Retention factors with ALS are strongly correlated with those with SDS. This is shown by the R2=0.79 for all eleven analytes and an R2=0.992 for specifically the non-hydrogen bonding (NHB) analytes. However, ALS displays different selectivity than SDS for hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) solutes (R2 of 0.74 and 0.88, respectively). ALS is degraded to less surface active compounds in acidic solution. These less surface-active compounds are more compatible with the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). ALS has a half-life of 48 min at pH 4. ALS has the potential to couple micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) with the ESI-MS. ALS can be used as a pseudostationary phase for a high efficiency separation and later acid hydrolyzed to enable an ESI-MS analysis.",

After data processing and pattern recognition, Sheng-mai injection showed better efficacy than the other two drugs in accordance with not only visual observation from PLS-DA scores plots but also the number of abnormal endogenous compounds restored to the normal level. Further studies showed that Sheng-mai injection could normalize the level of plasma endothelin-1, the index related to cardiovascular diseases and sleep disorders, which verified the results of metabonomics. Finally, the regulated metabolites and related metabolic pathways were analyzed, and it was supposed that the effects of Sheng-mai injection involved in the alternation of energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acids metabolism, and so on.

Beta-blocker administration is critical because of its negative inotropic effect. Ivabradine is a selective HR-lowering agent that exclusively inhibits the I(f) current in sinoatrial node cells without having any effect on cardiac contractility or atrioventricular conduction. A total of 120 patients were randomized to oral premedication with ivabradine 15 mg or metoprolol 50 mg. HR and blood pressure (BP) were measured before the administration of premedication and immediately before coronary computed tomographic angiography. The mean time between premedication administration and follow-up was 108 \u00b1 21.5 minutes for ivabradine and 110 \u00b1 22.2 minutes for metoprolol (p = NS). When comparing groups, there were no significant differences in reduction of HR (-11.83 \u00b1 8.6 vs -13.20 \u00b1 7.8 beats/min, p = NS) and diastolic BP (-5.05 \u00b1 14.2 mm Hg vs -4.08 \u00b1 10.8 mm Hg, p = NS), whereas the decrease of systolic BP was significantly lower in patients who received ivabradine compared to those in the metoprolol group (-3.95 \u00b1 13.6 vs -13.65 \u00b1 17.3 mm Hg, p <0.001).

The p-MCA-induced insulin secretion and rise in [Ca\u00b2\u207a]i were markedly inhibited in the absence of extracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a or in the presence of an L-type Ca\u00b2\u207a channel blocker nimodipine. These results suggested that p-MCA increased Ca\u00b2\u207a influx via the L-type Ca\u00b2\u207a channels. Diazoxide, an ATP-sensitive K\u207a channel opener, did not alter p-MCA-induced insulin secretion, nor [Ca\u00b2\u207a]i response.

The current research work, therefore, entails formulation development of liquid self-nano-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS) to enhance the bioavailability of carvedilol by facilitating its transport via lymphatic circulation. The formulation constituents, i.e. lipids, surfactants, and co-surfactants, were selected on the basis of solubility studies. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed to embark upon the selection of blend of lipidic (i.e. Capmul PG8) and hydrophilic components (i.e. Cremophor EL as surfactant and Transcutol HP as co-surfactant) for efficient and robust formulation of SNEDDS. The SNEDDS, systematically optimized employing a central composite design (CCD), were evaluated for various response variables viz drug release parameters, emulsification time, emulsion droplet size, and mean dissolution time. In vitro drug release studies depicted that the release from SNEDDS systems followed a non-Fickian kinetic behavior. The TEM imaging of the optimized formulation affirmed the uniform shape and nano size of the system. Accelerated studies of the optimized formulation indicated high stability of the formulation for 6 months. The in situ perfusion studies carried out in wistar rats construed several fold augmentation in the permeability and absorption potential of the optimized formulation vis-\u00e0-vis marketed formulation. Thus, the present studies ratified the potential of SNEDDS in augmenting the oral bioavailability of BCS class II drugs.",

Atenolol significantly reduced all the harmonic proportions of the pulse wave, while captopril and losartan significantly increased the first and fourth harmonic proportions.

    "74": "Recent clinical evidence revealed that the use of beta-blockers such as propranolol, prior to diagnosis or concurrently with chemotherapy, could increase relapse-free and overall survival in breast cancer patients. We therefore hypothesized that propranolol may be able to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy either through direct effects on cancer cells or via anti-angiogenic mechanisms. In vitro proliferation assay showed that propranolol (from 50-100 \u03bcM) induces dose-dependent anti-proliferative effects in a panel of 9 human cancer and \"normal\" cell lines. Matrigel assays revealed that propranolol displays potent anti-angiogenic properties at non-toxic concentrations (less than 50 \u03bcM) but exert no vascular-disrupting activity. Combining chemotherapeutic drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or paclitaxel, with propranolol at the lowest effective concentration resulted in synergistic, additive or antagonistic effects on cell proliferation in vitro depending on the cell type and the dose of chemotherapy used. Interestingly, breast cancer and vascular endothelial cells were among the most responsive to these combinations. Furthermore, Matrigel assays indicated that low concentrations of propranolol (10 - 50 \u03bcM) potentiated the anti-angiogenic effects of 5-FU and paclitaxel. Using an orthotopic xenograft model of triple-negative breast cancer, based on s.c injection of luciferase-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells in the mammary fat pad of nude mice, we showed that propranolol, when used alone, induced only transient anti-tumor effects, if at all, and did not increase median survival. However, the combination of propranolol with chemotherapy resulted in more profound and sustained anti-tumor effects and significantly increased the survival benefits induced by chemotherapy alone (+19% and +79% in median survival for the combination as compared with 5-FU alone and paclitaxel alone, respectively; p less than 0.05). Collectively our results show that propranolol can potentiate the anti-angiogenic effects and anti-tumor efficacy of chemotherapy. The current study, together with retrospective clinical data, strongly suggests that the use of propranolol concurrently with chemotherapy may improve the outcome of breast cancer patients, thus providing a strong rationale for the evaluation of this drug combination in prospective clinical studies.",

The DMS gas-phase separation was able to resolve the isomeric metabolites with separation times on the order of milliseconds instead of minutes which is typically required when using pre-ionization chromatographic separation methods. Direct separation of isomeric metabolites from the complex tissue extract was confirmed by implementing a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation prior to the DMS-MS analysis to pre-separate the species of interest. The ability to separate isomeric exogenous metabolites directly from a complex tissue extract is expected to facilitate the drug development process by increasing analytical throughput without the requirement for pre-ionization cleanup or separation strategies.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of propranolol, a nonselective \u03b2-receptor antagonist, on the skeletal system of mature male rats and on the development of bone changes induced by glucocorticoid (prednisolone) administration. The experiments were performed on 24-week-old male Wistar rats. The effects of prednisolone 21-hemisuccinate sodium salt (7 mg/kg, sc daily) or/and propranolol hydrochloride (10 mg/kg, ip daily) administered for 4 weeks on the skeletal system were studied. Bone and bone mineral mass in the tibia, femur and L-4 vertebra, length and diameter of the long bones, mechanical properties of tibial metaphysis, femoral diaphysis and femoral neck, bone histomorphometric parameters and turnover markers in serum were determined. Prednisolone-induced unfavorable skeletal changes led to disorders in bone mechanical properties. Propranolol not only did not improve bone parameters, but even caused deleterious effects on the skeletal system. Concurrent administration of propranolol with prednisolone did not counteract the changes induced by prednisolone. The results of this study may help to understand the equivocal results of human studies on the effects of \u03b2-blockers on the skeletal system.

Chronic aluminium chloride treatment also significantly increased acetylcholinesterase activity and the aluminium concentration in brain compared to sham. Chronic administration of carvedilol (2.5 and 5 mg/kg, po) daily to rats for a period of 6 weeks significantly improved the memory performance tasks of rats in the Morris water maze test, attenuated oxidative stress (reduced lipid peroxidation, nitrite concentration and restored reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione S-transferase activity), decreased acetylcholinesterase activity and aluminium concentration in aluminium-treated rats compared to control rats (p < 0.05).

    "80": "Recent researches have indicated a role for antihypertensive drugs including alpha- or beta-blockers in the prevention of bone loss. Some epidemiological studies reported the protective effects of those agents on fracture risk. However, there is limited information on the association with those agents especially at the mechanism of action. In the present study, we investigated the effects of doxazosin, an alpha-blocker that is clinically used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) along with antihypertensive medication, on the osteogenic stem cell differentiation. We found that doxazosin increased osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells, detected by Alizarin red S staining and calcein. Doxazosin not only induced expression of alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen, osteopontin, and osteocalcin, it also resulted in increased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), a MAP kinase involved in osteoblastic differentiation. Treatment with U0126, a MAP kinase inhibitor, significantly blocked doxazosin-induced osteoblastic differentiation. Unrelated to activation of osteogenic differentiation by doxazosin, we found that there were no significant changes in adipogenic differentiation or in the expression of adipose-specific genes, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3, aP2, or LPL. In this report, we suggest that doxazosin has the ability to increase osteogenic cell differentiation via ERK1/2 activation in osteogenic differentiation of adult stem cells, which supports the protective effects of antihypertensive drug on fracture risk and according to our data doxazosin might be useful for application in the field of bone metabolism.",

    "95": "The airway smooth muscle (ASM) layer within the airway wall modulates airway diameter and distensibility. Even in the relaxed state, the ASM layer possesses finite stiffness and limits the extent of airway distension by the radial force generated by parenchymal tethers and transmural pressure. Airway stiffness has often been attributed to passive elements, such as the extracellular matrix in the lamina reticularis, adventitia, and the smooth muscle layer that cannot be rapidly modulated by drug intervention such as ASM relaxation by \u03b2-agonists. In this study, we describe a calcium-sensitive component of ASM stiffness mediated through the Rho-kinase signaling pathway. The stiffness of ovine tracheal smooth muscle was assessed in the relaxed state under the following conditions: 1) in physiological saline solution (Krebs solution) with normal calcium concentration; 2) in calcium-free Krebs with 2 mM EGTA; 3) in Krebs with calcium entry blocker (SKF-96365); 4) in Krebs with myosin light chain kinase inhibitor (ML-7); and 5) in Krebs with Rho-kinase inhibitor (Y-27632). It was found that a substantial portion of the passive stiffness could be abolished when intracellular calcium was removed; this calcium-sensitive stiffness appeared to stem from intracellular source and was not sensitive to ML-7 inhibition of myosin light chain phosphorylation, but was sensitive to Y-27632 inhibition of Rho kinase. The results suggest that airway stiffness can be readily modulated by targeting the calcium-sensitive component of the passive stiffness within the muscle layer.",

BK \u03b21-KO mice were more sensitive to LPS-induced mortality compared with wild-type mice. After LPS (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), BK \u03b21-KO mice had a more rapid fall in heart rate and blood pressure (measured by radiotelemetry), shorter latency to mortality, and higher mortality rate than wild-type mice. Twenty-two hours after LPS treatment, wild-type and BK \u03b21-KO mice had reduced norepinephrine reactivity and impaired constrictor responses to the BK channel blocker paxilline in mesenteric arteries in vitro and higher iNOS expression in the heart, but not in mesenteric arteries. Endotoxemic BK \u03b21-KO mice also showed more severe lung and intestinal injury, higher myeloperoxidase activity and polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration in lung and liver. Endotoxemic BK \u03b21-KO mice had higher plasma tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin 6 levels at 22 hours, but not 6 hours post-LPS. Exaggerated mortality in BK \u03b21-KO mice also occurred in the cecal ligation/puncture model of septic shock. Reduced vascular BK channel function does not protect against hypotension in the early stage of septic shock; in the later stage, smooth muscle BK channel deficiency enhances organ damage and mortality.",

There was one death and one stroke, and 4 cases were of relapsing Takotsubo after a new seizure. Takotsubo syndrome may induce cardiac arrhythmias. A near-SUDEP (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy) was reported in one patient. Animal models of SUDEP have shown similar cardiac lesions to those seen in Takotsubo syndrome, and strengthen the hypothesis of a link between these conditions.

The use of quantitative waveform measures (QWM) which measure the frequency and fractal dimension of the VF electrocardiogram have shown success in predicting response to defibrillatory shock in animal models. Patients in cardiac arrest are often taking medications affecting adrenergic activity such as the beta blocker metoprolol and the combined alpha and beta blocker, labetalol. How this exposure might alter the QWM and ROSC rates is not known.

ECG was recorded at 1000Hz for 7min of untreated VF. Closed chest compressions were then begun and after 1min a 200J shock was delivered. Resuscitation was continued with repeat defibrillation shocks as indicated for 15min or until ROSC was achieved (defined: systolic BP>60 for 10min). The Fourier frequency spectra, AMSA and DFA measures from VF onset to 7min were calculated using custom MATLAB routines.

Labetalol produced an even greater reduction in frequencies in these intervals. The decline in AMSA was similar in all three groups over the first 3min. From 3 to 7min the metoprolol group was significantly lower than the control group (p<0.001) and the labetalol group was lower still (p<0.001). The DFA demonstrated little difference between the control and metoprolol groups, but showed a linear increase over 7min in the labetalol group (p<0.001 vs compared to control and metoprolol groups). ROSC was noted in 2/10 in the control group, 7/8 in metoprolol group and 2/7 in the labetalol group. The frequentist analysis of ROSC showed a relative risk (RR) of ROSC of 4.4 when comparing control to metoprolol animals and 1.4 comparing control to labetalol animals.", 
    "113": "Metoprolol results in a reduction in frequencies in the Fourier spectrum of VF as compared with controls. There is a further decrease in frequencies with labetalol. The AMSA reflects this reduction in frequencies with lower AMSA values from 3 to 7min of VF. The DFA demonstrates consistent changes with labetalol treated animals over the 7min, but the metoprolol treated animals do not differ from the controls. The marked improvement in ROSC seen with metoprolol (RR 4.4) is unexpected and is not seen in labetalol treated animals.

We investigated the pharmacological mechanism of the antidepressant-like effect of tipepidine in the forced swimming test in rats. A catecholamine-depleting agent, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT; 300 mg/kg, s.c.), was given 6h before the first injection and with the last injection of tipepidine (40 mg/kg, i.p.). A serotonin (5-HT)-depleting agent, p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA; 350 mg/kg, i.p.), was given 72 h and 48 h before the pretest session. The dopamine D(1) receptor antagonist, SCH23390 (0.02 mg/kg, s.c.) was given 15min before each of the three injections of tipepidine. The dopamine D(2) receptor antagonist raclopride (0.2mg/kg, s.c.), the alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (1mg/kg, i.p.), the alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (2mg/kg, i.p.) and the beta adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (2mg/kg, i.p.) were given 30 min before each of the three injections of tipepidine. AMPT, but not PCPA, significantly inhibited the immobility time-reducing effect of tipepidine in the forced swimming test. Furthermore, the effect of tipepidine was significantly inhibited by SCH23390 and yohimbine. However, raclopride, prazosin, and propranolol failed to block the effect of tipepidine. The results suggest that the antidepressant-like effect of tipepidine in the forced swimming test may be due at least in part to the effects of dopamine and noradrenaline released at the dopamine D(1) receptor and alpha 2 adrenoceptor, respectively.",

Therapy duration was planned for 4 to 6 months; if there was significant relapse, the period of treatment was extended. The mean age of 55 patients at the beginning of the treatment was 6 months (52.7% <4 mos, 30.9% 4-9 mos, 16.3% >9 mos). Thirteen patients (21.7%) showed a reaction possibly due to the medication, but we did not observe any life-threatening adverse effects.

The initially administered dosage was adjusted to the increase of weight in 21 patients (38.2%), but most did not require a dosage adjustment despite somatic growth. Mean duration of treatment was 6 months; younger patients needed longer treatment periods. Response to treatment was favorable; eight (14.5%) showed total regression and 46 (83.4%) partial regression, and one (1.8%) had no response. Propranolol is an efficacious therapy for severe IH.

Response to treatment was evaluated by rating serial medical photographs taken 1, 2, and 6 months after initiation of treatment. Degree of clinical improvement in overall appearance (including color and size) was rated as follows: worse or stable (0), slight (<25%), moderate (25-50%), good (50-75%), or excellent (>75%). A second assessment was done using a 100-mm visual analog scale to rate improvement at 6 months. Pre and post-treatment imaging was available for several patients. Twelve pairs of infants with IH were analyzed. At 1 month, clinical improvement in the propranolol group was moderate to good in all patients. In the prednisone group, only one patient had moderate improvement, with others showing slight (7/12) or no improvement or stabilization (3/12) from baseline and one case worsening. At 6 months, the propranolol group showed good to excellent response in all cases, whereas nine in the prednisone group showed slight to moderate response. Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging correlated with the clinical improvement in the cases in which it was performed. No major side effects were observed in either group. Propranolol appears superior to oral prednisone in inducing more-rapid and greater clinical improvement in this study.

The dominant pathway of BAT thermogenesis occurs through the \u03b2(3)-adrenergic receptor. In this study, we investigated the role of the \u03b2(3)-adrenergic system in BAT thermogenesis during arousal from hibernation both in vitro and in vivo. Syrian hamsters in the hibernation group contained BAT that was significantly greater in overall mass, total protein, and thermogenic uncoupling protein-1 than BAT from the warm-acclimated group. Although the ability of the \u03b2(3)-agonist CL316,243 to induce BAT thermogenesis at 36\u00b0C was no different between the hibernation and warm-acclimated groups, its maximum ratio over the basal value at 12\u00b0C in the hibernation group was significantly larger than that in the warm-acclimated group. Forskolin stimulation at 12\u00b0C produced equivalent BAT responses in these two groups. In vivo thermogenesis was assessed with the arousal time determined by the time course of BAT temperature or heart rate. Stimulation of BAT by CL316,243 significantly shortened the time of arousal from hibernation compared with that induced by vehicle alone, and it also induced arousal in deep hibernating animals. The \u03b2(3)-antagonist SR59230A inhibited arousal from hibernation either in part or completely. These results suggest that BAT in hibernating animals has potent thermogenic activity with a highly effective \u03b2(3)-receptor mechanism at lower temperatures.",

To obtain more evidence for the role of these variants in BP regulation, we studied their association with BP responses to four different antihypertensive drug monotherapies. We selected 19 single-nucleotide variants based on data from five GWASs. The study group consisted of more than 200 hypertensive Finnish men from the GENRES study. Ambulatory BP responses to 4-week treatments with losartan, bisoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine were the primary targets of the study. Secondarily, baseline indicators of the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were studied. After correction for multiple comparisons, the variant rs6749447 in the STK39 gene was significantly associated with BP responses. Thus, the minor rs6749447 allele was associated with a lower systolic and diastolic BP response to losartan (P=0.0005 and 0.0002, respectively). rs6749447 minor allele homozygotes had marginally higher serum aldosterone/plasma renin activity (PRA) ratios (P=0.04) than those without this allele. In a replication study on aldosterone and renin levels, another cohort of hypertensive patients (n=311) showed a similar trend. When the two cohorts were combined, the aldosterone level (P=0.02) and the aldosterone/PRA ratio (P=0.01) were higher in subjects homozygous for the minor rs6749447 allele than in other subjects. The present study shows that pharmacogenetic approaches may provide evidence that complements systematic genome-wide strategies by identifying gene loci that not only affect the BP level but also might modify its response to pharmacologic interventions.",

Director Jay Cohn, building on his expertise in hypertension and hemodynamics, led many creative and committed investigators in the exploration of the mechanisms responsible for increased sensitivity to afterload in heart failure. The neurohormonal hypothesis of heart failure led to the development of several pharmacologic tools, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, and, later, angiotensin-receptor blockers. By the late 1990s, it was understood that neurohormonal antagonists could prevent the progression of left ventricular remodeling and favorably influence the natural history of heart failure. Neurohormonal blockers are now considered standard therapy. Issues remain to be addressed, including early identification and treatment of patients at risk.",

Both sympathetic overdrive and increased heart rate are predictors of poor long-term outcome in patients with HF. Pharmacologic agents that partially inhibit sympathetic activity, such as beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, effectively reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic HF. In contrast, modulation of parasympathetic activation as a potential therapy for HF has received only limited attention because of its inherent complex cardiovascular effects. This review examines results of experimental animal studies that provide support for the possible use of electrical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) as a long-term therapy for the treatment of chronic HF. The review also addresses the effects of VNS on potential modifiers of the HF state, including proinflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide elaboration, and myocardial expression of gap junction proteins.

Metoprolol, an anti-hypertensive drug, was subjected to hydrolysis (acidic, alkaline and neutral), oxidation, photolysis and thermal stress, as per ICH-specified conditions. The drug showed extensive degradation under oxidative and hydrolysis (acid and base) stress conditions. However, it was stable to thermal, neutral and photolysis stress conditions. A total of 14 degradation products were observed and the chromatographic separation of the drug and its degradation products was achieved on a C(18) column (4.6 \u00d7 250 mm, 5 \u00b5m). To characterize degradation products, initially the mass spectral fragmentation pathway of the drug was established with the help of MS/MS, MS(n) and accurate mass measurements. Similarly, fragmentation pattern and accurate masses of the degradation products were established by subjecting them to LC-MS/QTOF analysis. Structure elucidation of degradation products was achieved by comparing their fragmentation pattern with that of the drug. The degradation products DP(2) (m/z 153) and DP(14) (m/z 236) were matched with impurity B, listed in European Pharmacopoeia and British Pharmacopoeia, and impurity I, respectively. The LC-MS method was validated with respect to specificity, linearity, accuracy and precision.", 
    "134": "The role of histamine as a newly recognized sympathetic neurotransmitter has been presented previously, and its postsynaptic effects greatly depended on the activities of sympathetic nerves. Cardiac sympathetic nerves become overactivated under acute myocardial ischemic conditions and release neurotransmitters in large amounts, inducing ventricular arrhythmia. Therefore, it is proposed that cardiac sympathetic histamine, in addition to norepinephrine, may have a significant arrhythmogenic effect. To test this hypothesis, we observed the release of cardiac sympathetic histamine and associated ventricular arrhythmogenesis that was induced by acute ischemia in isolated mouse hearts. Mast cell-deficient mice (MCDM) and histidine decarboxylase knockout (HDC(-/-)) mice were used to exclude the potential involvement of mast cells. Electrical field stimulation and acute ischemia-reperfusion evoked chemical sympathectomy-sensitive histamine release from the hearts of both MCDM and wild-type (WT) mice but not from HDC(-/-) mice. The release of histamine from the hearts of MCDM and WT mice was associated with the development of acute ischemia-induced ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. The incidence and duration of induced ventricular arrhythmias were found to decrease in the presence of the selective histamine H(2) receptor antagonist famotidine. Additionally, the released histamine facilitated the arrhythmogenic effect of simultaneously released norepinephrine. We conclude that, under acute ischemic conditions, cardiac sympathetic histamine released by overactive sympathetic nerve terminals plays a certain arrhythmogenic role via H(2) receptors. These findings provided novel insight into the pathophysiological roles of sympathetic histamine, which may be a new therapeutic target for acute ischemia-induced arrhythmias.",

In view of a constantly ageing population and increasingly frequent polypharmacotherapy, identification of potentially tremor-inducing drugs may help generating risk profiles for individual patients. Drug-induced tremor has often been seen as a complication of antipsychotic therapy, but its occurrence has also been described in response to a great diversity of compounds such as antidepressants, sympathomimetics, antiarrhythmics, antiepileptics and other drugs. The present article presents a synopsis of the most prevalent tremor-inducing drugs as well as strategies to overcome drug-induced tremor, either by replacement of the causative drug or by symptomatic therapies.", 
    "136": "Infantile haemangiomas (IH) are the most commonly occurring benign tumours of infancy, which may lead to considerable morbidity, such as amblyopia, ulceration and airway obstruction, depending on localization. Until recently, treatment was difficult: high-dose systemic glucocorticoids had limited effect and serious side effects. In 2008, the effectiveness of the beta-blocker propranolol for infantile haemangiomas was discovered; by now there is extensive worldwide experience. Data from the literature and from our own patient cohort (n = 132) confirm the remarkable efficacy of propranolol in complicated IH, without significant adverse effects. Propranolol is most effective in the proliferation phase of IH in children under 6 months of age. Timely referral of patients with potentially function-threatening or life-changing IH to a specialised multidisciplinary centre is therefore essential. Pending controlled studies, propranolol appears to have become the first choice treatment in complicated IH.", 
    "137": "Oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) is a model for human retinopathy of prematurity. In mice with OIR, beta-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) blockade with propranolol has been shown to ameliorate different aspects of retinal dysfunction in response to hypoxia. In the present study, we used the OIR model to investigate the role of distinct \u03b2-ARs on retinal proangiogenic factors, pathogenic neovascularization and electroretinographic responses. Our results demonstrate that \u03b2(2) -AR blockade with ICI 118,551 decreases retinal levels of proangiogenic factors and reduces pathogenic neovascularization, whereas \u03b2(1) - and \u03b2(3) -AR antagonists do not. Determination of retinal protein kinase A activity is indicative of the fact that \u03b2-AR blockers are indeed effective at the receptor level. In addition, the specificity of ICI 118,551 on retinal angiogenesis has been demonstrated by the finding that in mouse retinal explants, \u03b2(2) -AR silencing prevents ICI 118,551 effects on hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor accumulation. In OIR mice, ICI 118,551 is effective in increasing electroretinographic responses suggesting that activation of \u03b2(2) -ARs constitutes an important part of the retinal response to hypoxia. Lastly, immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that \u03b2(2) -ARs are localized to several retinal cells, particularly to M\u00fcller cells suggesting the possibility that \u03b2(2) -ARs play a role in regulating vascular endothelial growth factor production by these cells. The present results suggest that pathogenic angiogenesis, a key change in many hypoxic/ischemic vision-threatening retinal diseases, depends at least in part on \u03b2(2) -AR activity and indicate that \u03b2(2) -AR blockade can be effective against retinal angiogenesis.",

The elder brother was diagnosed with LVNC at the age of 4 months; by that time he had developed severe heart failure with metabolic decompensation. He died at 12 months of age due to intractable heart failure despite pharmacological therapy with diuretics, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and a beta-blocker.

This was an observational study, including a total of 200 consecutive patients already under glaucoma medication in two Swiss tertiary glaucoma clinics (Geneva and Bern). Personal characteristics, presence of systemic disease, compliance with glaucoma medication, attitude to the ophthalmologist, and glaucoma-related attitudes were ascertained by means of a predetermined questionnaire with 40 questions. Patients were subsequently assessed for the ability to correctly instil placebo eye drops. Non-compliance with glaucoma medication was defined as omitting more than two doses a week as reported by the patient. Logistic regression was used to evaluate how patient characteristics and knowledge about the disease were related to compliance. Overall, 81% (n\u00a0=\u00a0162) of patients reported to be compliant. Forgetfulness was the most frequently cited reason for non-compliance with dosing regimen (63%). Although 90.5% (n\u00a0=\u00a0181) of patients believed glaucoma medication to be efficient, only 28% (n\u00a0=\u00a056) could correctly define glaucoma. Factors positively associated with compliance were 'knowledge of glaucoma' [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 4.77 (95% CI 1.36-16.70)] and 'getting help for administration of drops' [OR 2.95 (1.25-6.94)]. These findings indicate that despite the comparatively high compliance rate among glaucoma patients, knowledge of glaucoma remains poor in long-term glaucoma sufferers.

Intruder rats that were defeated by a dominant resident conspecific exhibited a rapid increase in abdominal temperature by up to 2.0\u200a \u00b0C. In these defeated rats, we found that expression of Fos, a marker of neuronal activation, was increased in the rostral medullary raphe region centered in the rostral raphe pallidus and adjacent raphe magnus nuclei. In this region, Fos expression was observed in a large population of neurons expressing vesicular glutamate transporter\u20033 (VGLUT3), which are known as sympathetic premotor neurons controlling non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and thermoregulatory constriction of skin blood vessels, and also in a small population of tryptophan hydroxylase-positive serotonergic neurons. Intraperitoneal injection of diazepam, an anxiolytic agent, but not indomethacin, an antipyretic, significantly reduced both the stress-induced hyperthermia and Fos expression in these medullary raphe neuronal populations. Systemic blockade of \u03b23 -adrenoreceptors, which are abundantly expressed in BAT, also attenuated the stress-induced hyperthermia. These results suggest that psychological stress signals activate VGLUT3-expressing medullary raphe sympathetic premotor neurons, which then drive hyperthermic effector responses including BAT thermogenesis through \u03b2(3) -adrenoreceptors."
