Prolongation of the QT interval is considered as the best biomarker for predicting the torsadogenic risk of a new chemical entity. Because of the difficulty assessing the risk for TdP during drug development, we evaluated the metabolic phenotype for predicting QT prolongation induced by sparfloxacin, and elucidated the metabolic pathway related to the QT prolongation. We performed electrocardiography analysis and liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy-based metabolic profiling of plasma samples obtained from 15 guinea pigs after administration of sparfloxacin at doses of 33.3, 100, and 300 mg/kg. Principal component analysis and partial least squares modelling were conducted to select the metabolites that substantially contributed to the prediction of QT prolongation. QTc increased significantly with increasing dose (r\u200a=\u200a0.93). From the PLS analysis, the key metabolites that showed the highest variable importance in the projection values (>1.5) were selected, identified, and used to determine the metabolic network. In particular, cytidine-5'-diphosphate (CDP), deoxycorticosterone, L-aspartic acid and stearic acid were found to be final metabolomic phenotypes for the prediction of QT prolongation. Metabolomic phenotypes for predicting drug-induced QT prolongation of sparfloxacin were developed and can be applied to cardiac toxicity screening of other drugs. In addition, this integrative pharmacometabolomic approach would serve as a good tool for predicting pharmacodynamic or toxicological effects caused by changes in dose.",

We have investigated the effect of melatonin and its analog 5-methoxycarbonylamino-N-acetyltryptamine, 5-MCA-NAT, on \u03b2\u2082/\u03b1(2A)-adrenergic receptor mRNA as well as protein expression in cultured rabbit nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemical assays revealed a significant \u03b2\u2082-adrenergic receptor downregulation as well as \u03b1(2A)-adrenergic receptor up-regulation of treated cells (P < 0.001, maximal significant effect). In addition, we have studied the effect of these drugs upon the ocular hypotensive action of a nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (timolol) and a selective \u03b1\u2082-adrenergic receptor agonist (brimonidine) in normotensive rabbits. Intraocular pressure (IOP) experiments showed that the administration of timolol in rabbits pretreated with melatonin or 5-MCA-NAT evoked an additional IOP reduction of 14.02% \u00b1 5.8% or 16.75% \u00b1 5.48% (P < 0.01) in comparison with rabbits treated with timolol alone for 24 hours. Concerning brimonidine hypotensive action, an additional IOP reduction of 29.26% \u00b1 5.21% or 39.07% \u00b1 5.81% (P < 0.001) was observed in rabbits pretreated with melatonin or 5-MCA-NAT when compared with animals treated with brimonidine alone for 24 hours. Additionally, a sustained potentiating effect of a single dose of 5-MCA-NAT was seen in rabbits treated with brimonidine once daily for up 4 days (extra IOP decrease of 15.57% \u00b1 5.15%, P < 0.05, compared with brimonidine alone).

HPMC was also investigated as a component in the double layer tablet as base layer. Drug release was complicated compared with EC as the base layer in the double layer tablet due to the great swelling ability of HPMC. HPMC's larger swilling let it form a big cap to retard the drug release, which could significantly affect the drug release with a large ratio of the base layer to the drug layer; furthermore increasing the quality of 10%-40% of the base layer and the proportion of HPMC could reduce the initial burst release.",

Fearful of the antithyroid drugs' side effects, the patient was treated with a beta-blocker (propranolol, 80-20\u2009mg/day). As hyperthyroidism progressively worsened, the patient underwent total thyroidectomy. We hypothesized that NY-ESO-1 shared partial homology with thyroid autoantigens (the so-called molecular mimicry mechanism) and that at least one pair of homologous sequences contained amino acid sequence binding motifs to a restricted number of HLA molecules. We used BLAST software to search amino acid sequence homologies between NY-ESO-1 and thyroid autoantigens (thyrotropin receptor [TSH-R], thyroperoxidase, and thyroglobulin), and the HLA ligand/motif database to look for HLA/T-cell receptor binding motifs in the regions of NY-ESO-1 and thyroid autoantigens that were homologous. We found 15 epitopic regions of NY-ESO-1 homologous to 15 regions of thyroid autoantigens, some of which epitopic: 5 of TSH-R, 8 of thyroglobulin, and 2 of thyroperoxidase.

The authors included only randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trials of perioperatively administered \u03b2-blockers (ie, during the pre-, intra- and/or postoperative period) in patients with at least 1 risk factor for coronary artery disease undergoing NCS. The endpoints of these trials had to include all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI) and/or stroke. The authors identified 8 English-language publications, involving 11,180 patients, which fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Perioperative \u03b2-blocker therapy was associated with a significant decrease in patient risk of developing MI (relative risk [RR] = 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-0.86) but a significant increase in risk of developing stroke (RR = 2.17; 95% CI, 1.35-3.50) versus placebo, resulting in a nonsignificant decrease in overall mortality (RR = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.60-1.36). Indirect comparisons demonstrated that perioperative atenolol therapy was associated with lower mortality and incidence of MI. \u03b2-blocker therapy initiated >1 week before surgery was associated with improved postoperative mortality. Perioperative \u03b2-blocker treatment of patients undergoing NCS increases the incidence of stroke but decreases the incidence of MI, leading to a nonsignificant decrease in mortality.

    "31": "Systemic hypertension is highly prevalent in stable coronary artery disease, a pervasive comorbidity complicating the diagnostic performance and interpretation of non-invasive provocative tests in chest pain patients because of the ischaemic signals generated, despite normal or near normal coronary arteries, by hearts structurally readapted by long-term exposure to raised systemic blood pressure. Additional and unresolved problems posed by arterial hypertension in patients with stable coronary artery disease regard the benefits of antihypertensive treatment due to reports of irrelevant, if not detrimental, effect of blood pressure (BP) lowering in averting coronary relapses as well as the lack of association between BP levels and incident coronary events in survivors from acute myocardial infarction. Uncertainties extend to BP-independent cardioprotective effects of antihypertensive drugs, although the efficacy of renin-angiotensin system blockers in the long-term prevention of cardiovascular events in stable coronary artery disease patients has been shown by several studies, particularly when combined with amlodipine, a dihydropiridine calcium channel blocker. In contrast, the long-term effect of beta-blockers, the antihypertensive class most used in that clinical category, is not supported by strong evidence except that generated in patients with systolic dysfunction and early postmyocardial infarction recovery periods.", 
    "32": "The widely reported stimulation of the cardiac Na(+)-K(+) pump by protein kinase A (PKA) should oppose other effects of PKA to increase contractility of the normal heart. It should also reduce harmful raised myocyte Na(+) levels in heart failure, yet blockade of the \u03b21 adrenergic receptor (AR), coupled to PKA signalling, is beneficial. We treated rabbits with the \u03b21 AR antagonist metoprolol to modulate PKA activity and studied cardiac myocytes ex vivo. Metoprolol increased electrogenic pump current (Ip) in voltage clamped myocytes and reduced glutathionylation of the \u03b21 pump subunit, an oxidative modification causally related to pump inhibition. Activation of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin to enhance cAMP synthesis or inclusion of the catalytic subunit of PKA in patch pipette solutions abolished the increase in Ip in voltage clamped myocytes induced by treatment with metoprolol, supporting cAMP/PKA-mediated pump inhibition. Metoprolol reduced myocardial PKA and protein kinase C (PKC) activities, reduced coimmunoprecipitation of cytosolic p47(phox) and membranous p22(phox) NADPH oxidase subunits and reduced myocardial O2(\u2022-)-sensitive dihydroethidium fluorescence. Treatment also enhanced coimmunoprecipitation of the \u03b21 pump subunit with glutaredoxin 1 that catalyses de-glutathionylation. Since angiotensin II induces PKC-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase, we examined the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with captopril. This treatment had no effect on PKA activity but reduced the activity of PKC, reduced \u03b21 subunit glutathionylation and increased Ip. The PKA-induced Na(+)-K(+) pump inhibition we report should act with other mechanisms that enhance contractility of the normal heart but accentuate the harmful effects of raised cytosolic Na(+) in the failing heart. This scheme is consistent with the efficacy of \u03b21 AR blockade in the treatment of heart failure.",

An increasing number of studies indicate that chronic stress can accelerate tumor growth, but its role in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) progression is not well understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of chronic restraint stress (CRS) on CRC cell growth in nude mice and the possible underlying mechanisms. In this study, we showed that CRS increased the levels of plasma catecholamines including epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE), and stimulated the growth of CRC cell-derived tumors in vivo. Treatment with the adrenoceptor (AR) antagonists phentolamine (PHE, \u03b1-AR antagonist) and propranolol (PRO, \u03b2-AR antagonist) significantly inhibited the CRS-enhanced CRC cell growth in nude mice. In addition, the stress hormones E and NE remarkably enhanced CRC cell proliferation and viability in culture, as well as tumor growth in vivo. These effects were antagonized by the AR antagonists PHE and PRO, indicating that the stress hormone-induced CRC cell proliferation is AR dependent. We also observed that the \u03b2-AR antagonists atenolol (ATE, \u03b21- AR antagonist) and ICI 118,551 (ICI, \u03b22- AR antagonist) inhibited tumor cell proliferation and decreased the stress hormone-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases-1/2 (ERK1/2) in vitro and in vivo. The ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 also blocked the function of the stress hormone, suggesting the involvement of ERK1/2 in the tumor-promoting effect of CRS.

The relationships among previous antianginal use, clinical characteristics on presentation, and in-hospital management and outcomes were examined. Beta blockers were the most commonly used agents, and there was a significant decline in the use of nitrates over time. Compared with patients not on any antianginal therapy before presentation, those on treatment were more likely to be older, female, and have a history of hypertension, diabetes, previous angina, and myocardial infarction; they were less likely to present with positive biomarkers (all p <0.001). Patients not on antianginal therapy before presentation were more likely to undergo coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention and less likely to have recurrent ischemia during hospitalization (all p <0.001).

Previous antianginal use was independently associated with a lower use of coronary angiography in hospital.",

    "71": "Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Many pharmacologic therapies are available that aim to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease but there is significant inter-individual variation in drug response, including both efficacy and toxicity. Pharmacogenetics aims to personalize medication choice and dosage to ensure that maximum clinical benefit is achieved whilst side effects are minimized. Over the past decade, our knowledge of pharmacogenetics in cardiovascular therapies has increased significantly. The anticoagulant warfarin represents the most advanced application of pharmacogenetics in cardiovascular medicine. Prospective randomized clinical trials are currently underway utilizing dosing algorithms that incorporate genetic polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C9 and vitamin k epoxide reductase (VKORC1) to determine warfarin dosages. Polymorphisms in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 account for approximately 40\u00a0% of the variance in warfarin dose. There is currently significant controversy with regards to pharmacogenetic testing in anti-platelet therapy. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by aspirin in vitro has been associated with polymorphisms in the cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-1 gene. However, COX-1 polymorphisms did not affect clinical outcomes in patients prescribed aspirin therapy. Similarly, CYP2C19 polymorphisms have been associated with clopidogrel resistance in vitro, and have shown an association with stent thrombosis, but not with other cardiovascular outcomes in a consistent manner. Response to statins has been associated with polymorphisms in the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), apolipoprotein E (APOE), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, calmin (CLMN) and apolipoprotein-CI (APOC1) genes. Although these genes contribute to the variation in lipid levels during statin therapy, their effects on cardiovascular outcomes requires further investigation. Polymorphisms in the solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B1 (SLCO1B1) gene is associated with increased statin exposure and simvastatin-induced myopathy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists (\u03b2-blockers) are medications that are important in the management of hypertension and heart failure. Insertion and deletion polymorphisms in the ACE gene are associated with elevated and reduced serum levels of ACE, respectively. No significant association was reported between the polymorphism and blood pressure reduction in patients treated with perindopril. However, a pharmacogenetic score incorporating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the bradykinin type 1 receptor gene and angiotensin-II type I receptor gene predicted those most likely to benefit and suffer harm from perindopril therapy. Pharmacogenetic studies into \u03b2-blocker therapy have focused on variations in the \u03b21-adrenoceptor gene and CYP2D6, but results have been inconsistent. Pharmacogenetic testing for ACE inhibitor and \u03b2-blocker therapy is not currently used in clinical practice. Despite extensive research, no pharmacogenetic tests are currently in clinical practice for cardiovascular medicines. Much of the research remains in the discovery phase, with researchers struggling to demonstrate clinical utility and validity. This is a problem seen in many areas of therapeutics and is because of many factors, including poor study design, inadequate sample sizes, lack of replication, and heterogeneity amongst patient populations and phenotypes. In order to progress pharmacogenetics in cardiovascular therapies, researchers need to utilize next-generation sequencing technologies, develop clear phenotype definitions and engage in multi-center collaborations, not only to obtain larger sample sizes but to replicate associations and confirm results across different ethnic groups.", 
    "72": "This paper describes the development and application of a multi-residue chiral liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry method for simultaneous enantiomeric profiling of 18 chiral pharmaceuticals and their active metabolites (belonging to several therapeutic classes including analgesics, psychiatric drugs, antibiotics, cardiovascular drugs and \u03b2-agonists) in surface water and wastewater. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time an enantiomeric method including such a high number of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites has been reported. Some of the pharmaceuticals have never been studied before in environmental matrices. Among them are timolol, betaxolol, carazolol and clenbuterol. A monitoring programme of the Guadalquivir River basin (South Spain), including 24 sampling sites and five wastewater treatment plants along the basin, revealed that enantiomeric composition of studied pharmaceuticals is dependent on compound and sampling site. Several compounds such as ibuprofen, atenolol, sotalol and metoprolol were frequently found as racemic mixtures. On the other hand, fluoxetine, propranolol and albuterol were found to be enriched with one enantiomer. Such an outcome might be of significant environmental relevance as two enantiomers of the same chiral compound might reveal different ecotoxicity. For example, propranolol was enriched with S(-)-enantiomer, which is known to be more toxic to Pimephales promelas than R(+)-propranolol. Fluoxetine was found to be enriched with S(+)-enantiomer, which is more toxic to P. promelas than R(-)-fluoxetine.",

Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic agent, a multichannel blocker (Ca++, Na+, and K+), and a noncompetitive \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic blocker in cardiac cells. The present study aimed to determine whether amiodarone was protective against experimentally induced cecal ligation and puncture sepsis in rat lung tissue. The relationship between its probable protective effect and antioxidant/anticytokine action biochemically and histopathologically was also examined. Five groups of rats were used, each composed of 20 rats: (1) the sham-operated control group; (2) the CLP group; (3) the 25-mg/kg amiodarone-treated control healthy group; (4) the 50-mg/kg amiodarone-treated CLP group; and (5) the 50-mg/kg amiodarone-treated CLP group. A CLP polymicrobial sepsis model was applied to the rats. All groups were sacrificed 16 h later, and lung and blood samples were analyzed histopathologically and biochemically. Twenty-five and 50 mg/kg amiodarone decreased the level of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 in serum and 8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 level in lung tissue. They increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and levels of total glutathione in lung tissues of rats. Histopathological scores and examinations were in accordance with the biochemical results. Histopathological analysis revealed significant differences in inflammation scores between the sepsis group and the other groups. The CLP + amiodarone 50 mg/kg group had the lowest inflammation score among CLP groups. Our results indicate that administration of amiodarone prevented oxidative stress and cytokine action and protected lung tissue during sepsis cascade.",

The objective of this cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary referral center was to examine the association between SDB and exercise testing outcomes independent of body mass index (BMI) and other cardiopulmonary risk factors. Between January 1, 2005 and January 1, 2010, 1,424 adults underwent exercise testing and within 6 months before first-time diagnostic polysomnography. Subjects were categorized by apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) into 4 groups: <5, 5 to 14, 15 to 29, and \u226530. A logistic regression model incorporated age, gender, BMI, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, beta-blocker use, and cardiac and pulmonary disease as covariates. The primary variable of interest was functional aerobic capacity (FAC). Mean age was 56.4 \u00b1 12.4 years; 75% were men. Mean BMI was 32.4 \u00b1 7.1 kg/m\u00b2, and mean AHI 19.5 \u00b1 22.1 per hour. On multivariate analysis, AHI as a continuous variable showed a negative correlation with FAC (R\u00b2adj\u00a0= 0.30, p <0.001) and postexercise SBP (R\u00b2adj\u00a0= 0.23, p\u00a0= 0.03), and positively correlated with resting and peak DBP (R\u00b2adj\u00a0= 0.09, p\u00a0= 0.01 and R\u00b2adj\u00a0= 0.09, p\u00a0= 0.04 respectively). When comparing patients with severe SDB (AHI \u226530) with those without SDB (AHI <5), FAC and heart rate recovery were significantly lower, and resting, peak, and postexercise DBP were higher in those with severe apnea (all p <0.05), after accounting for confounders. In conclusion, SDB severity was associated with reduced FAC and increased resting and peak DBP. Even after accounting for confounders, severe SDB was associated with attenuated FAC, impaired heart rate recovery, and higher resting, peak, and postexercise DBP.",

In atrial isolated myocytes, also under \u03b2-stimulation, L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)) density and intracellular Ca(2+)-transient amplitude were decreased by MI, by 35 and 41%, respectively, and the frequency of spontaneous depolarizations (SDs) was substantially increased. MI increased atrial myocyte size and capacity, and markedly decreased transverse-tubule density. In non-MI hearts perfused with ISO, the I(CaL)-blocker nifedipine, at a concentration (0.02 \u00b5M) causing an equivalent I(CaL) reduction (35%) to that from the MI, did not affect AF susceptibility, and decreased APD.",

Increased susceptibility to AF by MI, under \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation, may result from associated production of atrial APD alternans and SDs, since steady-state APD and global CV were unchanged under these conditions, and may be unrelated to the associated reduction in whole-cell ICaL. Future studies may clarify potential contributions of local conduction changes, and cellular and subcellular mechanisms of alternans, to the increased AF susceptibility.",

In the in vivo analysis of carotid artery single-injection method, [(3) H]propranolol uptake by the retina was greater than that of an internal reference compound, and was reduced by several organic cations. In the in vitro uptake study, TR-iBRB2 cells, an in vitro model of the inner BRB, showed a time-, concentration-, pH- and temperature-dependent [(3) H]propranolol uptake, suggesting the involvement of a carrier-mediated transport process in the influx of propranolol across the inner BRB. In the inhibition study, various organic cations, including drugs and candidates for the treatment of the retinal diseases, inhibited the [(3) H]propranolol uptake by TR-iBRB2 cells with no significant effects by the substrates and inhibitors of well-characterized organic cation transporters, suggesting that the influx transport of propranolol is performed by a novel transporter at the inner BRB. An analysis of the relationship between the inhibitory effect and the lipophilicity of inhibitors suggests a lipophilicity-dependent inhibitory effect of amines on the [(3) H]propranolol uptake by TR-iBRB2 cells.

However, changes of covariates over the 10-year follow-up were much stronger determinants. Specifically, incident myocardial infarction, new beta-blocker medication, and increased cardiac parameters (left atrial diameter, LV end-diastolic diameter, and LV mass index) were associated with increasing BNP, NT-proBNP, or both, whereas increased heart rate, haematocrit, and body mass index (BMI) were associated with decreasing BNP and NT-proBNP (all P < 0.05).",

Recovery of left ventricular function to normal is expected regardless of early therapy. Although the prognosis is generally favorable, monitoring for early dangerous complications is essential.

However, few studies have compared its efficacy and safety with those of the widely used \u03b2-blocker carvedilol in Japanese patients with CHF. We designed a confirmatory trial of bisoprolol using carvedilol as a control drug; however, the trial was discontinued after an off-label use of bisoprolol was approved during the study. Bisoprolol and carvedilol were administered for 32 weeks in 31 and 28 patients, respectively. The mean maintenance doses of bisoprolol and carvedilol were 3.3 and 13.6 mg/day, respectively, and the mean durations of treatment were 188.2 and 172.9 days, respectively. Heart-rate changes were similar in both groups.

The cumulative event-free rate for a composite of cardiovascular death or admissions to hospital for worsening of CHF was 92.4 % and 94.7 % in the bisoprolol and carvedilol groups, respectively. Overall, 90.3 % and 85.7 % of patients were titrated up to the maintenance doses of bisoprolol and carvedilol, respectively.

Here, we describe a 67-year-old woman who presented with complaint of dyspepsia and without a significant medical history, for whom PVA was incidentally diagnosed. The initial upper abdominal ultrasound revealed marked dilatation of the main portal vein, and subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography with angiography revealed a large aneurysm arising from the extrahepatic troncus portion of the portal vein, as well as gastroesophageal varices.

Transgenic hAPPSL (n = 33) and non-transgenic (n = 30) male mice (4-5 months) were subjected to unilateral cortical photothrombosis and treated with the non-selective calcium channel blocker bepridil (50 mg/kg, p.o., once a day) or vehicle for 28 days, starting administration 2 days after the operation. Animals were then perfused for histological analysis of infarct size, A\u03b2 and calcium accumulation in the thalamus. Cortical photothrombosis resulted in a small infarct, which was associated with atypical A\u03b2 and calcium accumulation in the ipsilateral thalamus. Transgenic mice had significantly smaller infarct volumes than non-transgenic littermates (P<0.05) and ischemia-induced rodent A\u03b2 accumulation in the thalamus was lower in transgenic mice compared to non-transgenic mice (P<0.01). Bepridil decreased calcium load in the thalamus (P<0.01). The present data suggest less pronounced primary and secondary pathology in hAPPSL transgenic mice after ischemic cortical injury.

    "123": "Therapeutic targeting of the beta-adrenergic receptors has recently shown remarkable efficacy in the treatment of benign vascular tumors such as infantile hemangiomas. As infantile hemangiomas are reported to express high levels of beta adrenergic receptors, we examined the expression of these receptors on more aggressive vascular tumors such as hemangioendotheliomas and angiosarcomas, revealing beta 1, 2, and 3 receptors were indeed present and therefore aggressive vascular tumors may similarly show increased susceptibility to the inhibitory effects of beta blockade. Using a panel of hemangioendothelioma and angiosarcoma cell lines, we demonstrate that beta adrenergic inhibition blocks cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in a dose dependent manner. Beta blockade is selective for vascular tumor cells over normal endothelial cells and synergistically effective when combined with standard chemotherapeutic or cytotoxic agents. We demonstrate that inhibition of beta adrenergic signaling induces large scale changes in the global gene expression patterns of vascular tumors, including alterations in the expression of established cell cycle and apoptotic regulators. Using in vivo tumor models we demonstrate that beta blockade shows remarkable efficacy as a single agent in reducing the growth of angiosarcoma tumors. In summary, these experiments demonstrate the selective cytotoxicity and tumor suppressive ability of beta adrenergic inhibition on malignant vascular tumors and have laid the groundwork for a promising treatment of angiosarcomas in humans.", 
    "124": "FOXO1 is involved in glucocorticoid- and sepsis-induced muscle wasting, in part reflecting regulation of atrogin-1 and MuRF1. Mechanisms influencing FOXO1 expression in muscle wasting are poorly understood. We hypothesized that the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b2/\u03b4 (PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4) upregulates muscle FOXO1 expression and activity with a downstream upregulation of atrogin-1 and MuRF1 expression during sepsis and glucocorticoid treatment and that inhibition of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 activity can prevent muscle wasting. We found that activation of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 in cultured myotubes increased FOXO1 activity, atrogin-1 and MuRF1 expression, protein degradation and myotube atrophy. Treatment of myotubes with dexamethasone increased PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 expression and activity. Dexamethasone-induced FOXO1 activation and atrogin-1 and MuRF1 expression, protein degradation, and myotube atrophy were inhibited by PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 blocker or siRNA. Importantly, muscle wasting induced in rats by dexamethasone or sepsis was prevented by treatment with a PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 inhibitor. The present results suggest that PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 regulates FOXO1 activation in glucocorticoid- and sepsis-induced muscle wasting and that treatment with a PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 inhibitor may ameliorate loss of muscle mass in these conditions.", 
    "125": "Objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate preoperative predictors of systolic and diastolic heart failure in patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) and (2) to describe the prognostic implications of systolic and diastolic heart failure in these patients. The onset of heart failure after orthotopic LT remains poorly understood. Data were obtained for all LT recipients between January 2000 and December 2010. The primary outcome was post-LT heart failure: systolic (ejection fraction\u2009\u2264\u200950%), diastolic, or mixed heart failure. Patients underwent echocardiographic evaluation before and after LT. Pretransplant variables were evaluated as predictors of heart failure with Cox proportional hazards model. 970 LT recipients were followed for 5.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4 years. Ninety-eight patients (10.1%) developed heart failure in the posttransplant period. There were 67 systolic (6.9%), 24 diastolic (2.5%), and 7 mixed systolic/diastolic (0.7%) heart failures. Etiology was ischemic in 18 (18.4%), tachycardia-induced in 8 (8.2%), valvular in 7 (7.1%), alcohol-related in 4 (4.1%), hypertensive heart disease in 3 (3.1%), and nonischemic in majority of patients (59.2%). Pretransplant grade 3 diastolic dysfunction, diabetes, hypertension, mean arterial pressure\u2009\u2264\u200965 mm Hg, mean pulmonary artery pressure\u2009\u2265\u200930 mm Hg, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure\u2009\u2265\u200915 mm Hg, hemodialysis, brain natriuretic peptide level and QT interval\u2009>\u2009450 ms were found to be predictive for the development of new-onset systolic heart failure. However beta-blocker use before LT and tacrolimus after LT were associated with reduced development of new-onset systolic heart failure. In conclusion, pretransplant risk factors, hemodynamic variables, and echocardiographic variables are important predictors of post-LT heart failure. In patients undergoing LT, postoperative onset of systolic or diastolic heart failure was found to be an independent predictor of mortality.", 
    "126": "Fat mass may be modulated by the number of brown-like adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT) in humans and rodents. Bone remodeling is dependent on systemic energy metabolism and, with age, bone remodeling becomes uncoupled and brown adipose tissue (BAT) function declines. To test the interaction between BAT and bone, we employed Misty (m/m) mice, which were reported be deficient in BAT. We found that Misty mice have accelerated age-related trabecular bone loss and impaired brown fat function (including reduced temperature, lower expression of Pgc1a, and less sympathetic innervation compared to wild-type (+/\u2009+)). Despite reduced BAT function, Misty mice had normal core body temperature, suggesting heat is produced from other sources. Indeed, upon acute cold exposure (4\u00b0C for 6 hours), inguinal WAT from Misty mice compensated for BAT dysfunction by increasing expression of Acadl, Pgc1a, Dio2, and other thermogenic genes. Interestingly, acute cold exposure also decreased Runx2 and increased Rankl expression in Misty bone, but only Runx2 was decreased in wild-type. Browning of WAT is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and, if present at room temperature, could impact bone metabolism. To test whether SNS activity could be responsible for accelerated trabecular bone loss, we treated wild-type and Misty mice with the \u03b2-blocker, propranolol. As predicted, propranolol slowed trabecular bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) loss in the distal femur of Misty mice without affecting wild-type. Finally, the Misty mutation (a truncation of DOCK7) also has a significant cell-autonomous role. We found DOCK7 expression in whole bone and osteoblasts. Primary osteoblast differentiation from Misty calvaria was impaired, demonstrating a novel role for DOCK7 in bone remodeling. Despite the multifaceted effects of the Misty mutation, we have shown that impaired brown fat function leads to altered SNS activity and bone loss, and for the first time that cold exposure negatively affects bone remodeling.", 
    "127": "Bone remodeling allows the conservation of normal bone mass despite constant changes in internal and external environments. The adaptation of the skeleton to these various stimuli leads credence to the notion that bone remodeling is a true homeostatic function, and as such is under the control of specific centers in the central nervous system (CNS). Hypothalamic and brainstem centers, as well as the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), have been identified as regulators of bone remodeling. However, the nature of the afferent CNS stimuli that may modulate CNS centers involved in the control of bone remodeling, with the exception of leptin, remains unclear. Based on the partial efficacy of exercise and mechanical stimulation regimens to prevent microgravity-induced bone loss and the known alterations in vestibular functions associated with space flights, we hypothesized that inner ear vestibular signals may contribute to the regulation of bone remodeling. Using an established model of bilateral vestibular lesions and microtomographic and histomorphometric bone analyses, we show here that induction of bilateral vestibular lesion in rats generates significant bone loss, which is restricted to weight-bearing bones and associated with a significant reduction in bone formation, as observed in rats under microgravity conditions. Importantly, this bone loss was not associated with reduced locomotor activity or metabolic abnormalities, was accompanied with molecular signs of increased sympathetic outflow, and could be prevented by the \u03b2-blocker propranolol. Collectively, these data suggest that the homeostatic process of bone remodeling has a vestibulosympathetic regulatory component and that vestibular system pathologies might be accompanied by bone fragility.", 
    "128": "In order to examine the reversibility of heart failure due to myocardial infarction (MI) by \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockade, 12 weeks infarcted rats were treated with or without metoprolol (50 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. The depressed left ventricular (LV) systolic pressure, positive and negative rates of changes in pressure development, ejection fraction, fractional shortening and cardiac output, as well as increased LV end-diastolic pressure in 20 weeks MI animals were partially reversed by metoprolol. MI-induced decreases in septum (systolic) thickness as well as increase in LV posterior wall thickness and LV internal diameter were partially or fully reversible by metoprolol. Treatment of MI animals with metoprolol partially reversed the elevated levels of plasma norepinephrine and dopamine without affecting the elevated levels of epinephrine. Although sarcoplasmic reticular (SR) Ca(2+)-uptake, as well as protein content for SR Ca(2+)-pump and phospholamban, were reduced in the infarcted hearts; these changes were partially reversible with metoprolol. Depressed myofibrillar Ca(2+)-stimulated ATPase activity, as well as mRNA levels for SR Ca(2+)-pump, phospholamban and \u03b1-myosin heavy chain, were unaffected whereas increased mRNA level for \u03b2-myosin heavy chain was partially reversed by metoprolol. The results suggest that partial improvement of cardiac performance by \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockade at advanced stages of heart failure may be due to partial reversal of changes in SR Ca(2+)-pump function whereas partial to complete reverse cardiac remodeling may be due to partial reduction in the elevated levels of plasma catecholamines.",

In spite of proven benefits of hypertension treatment, blood pressure control rates are poor, even in high-income countries with virtually full-access to therapies.

Strategies to improve blood pressure control include the prompt shift from monotherapy to combination therapy, the initial treatment with a two-drug combination, and the use of fixed-dose combinations in a single pill. Currently, preferred combinations include a renin-angiotensin blocker, either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin-receptor blocker plus a calcium channel blocker or a diuretic.

However, we do not fully understand the mechanisms that underlie embryonic cardiovascular short- or long-term responses to hypoxia in most species. We therefore measured cardiac growth and function in snapping turtle embryos incubated under normoxic (N21; 21% O\u2082) or chronic hypoxic conditions (H10; 10% O\u2082). We determined heart rate (fH) and mean arterial pressure (Pm) in acute normoxic (21% O\u2082) and acute hypoxic (10% O\u2082) conditions, as well as embryonic responses to cholinergic, adrenergic, and ganglionic pharmacological blockade. Compared with N21 embryos, chronic H10 embryos had smaller bodies and relatively larger hearts and were hypotensive, tachycardic, and following autonomic neural blockade showed reduced intrinsic fH at 90% of incubation. Unlike other reptile embryos, cholinergic and ganglionic receptor blockade both increased fH. \u03b2-Adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol decreased fH, and \u03b1-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine decreased Pm. We also measured cardiac mRNA expression. Cholinergic tone was reduced in H10 embryos, but cholinergic receptor (Chrm2) mRNA levels were unchanged. However, expression of adrenergic receptor mRNA (Adrb1, Adra1a, Adra2c) and growth factor mRNA (Igf1, Igf2, Igf2r, Pdgfb) was lowered in H10 embryos. Hypoxia altered the balance between cholinergic receptors, \u03b1-adrenoreceptor and \u03b2-adrenoreceptor function, which was reflected in altered intrinsic fH and adrenergic receptor mRNA levels.

    "148": "In young healthy humans, sympathetic vasoconstriction is markedly blunted during exercise to optimize blood flow to the metabolically active muscle. This phenomenon known as functional sympatholysis is impaired in hypertensive humans and rats by angiotensin II-dependent mechanisms, involving oxidative stress and inactivation of nitric oxide (NO). Nebivolol is a \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blocker that has NO-dependent vasodilatory and antioxidant properties. We therefore asked whether nebivolol would restore functional sympatholysis in hypertensive humans. In 21 subjects with stage 1 hypertension, we measured muscle oxygenation and forearm blood flow responses to reflex increases in sympathetic nerve activity evoked by lower body negative pressure at rest, and during rhythmic handgrip exercise at baseline, after 12 weeks of nebivolol (5-20 mg/d) or metoprolol (100-300 mg/d), using a double-blind crossover design. We found that nebivolol had no effect on lower body negative pressure-induced decreases in oxygenation and forearm blood flow in resting forearm (from -29\u00b15% to -30\u00b15% and from -29\u00b13% to -29\u00b13%, respectively; P=NS). However, nebivolol attenuated the lower body negative pressure-induced reduction in oxygenation and forearm blood flow in exercising forearm (from -14\u00b14% to -1\u00b15% and from -15\u00b12% to -6\u00b12%, respectively; both P<0.05). This effect of nebivolol on oxygenation and forearm blood flow in exercising forearm was not observed with metoprolol in the same subjects, despite a similar reduction in blood pressure. Nebivolol had no effect on sympathetic nerve activity at rest or during handgrip, suggesting a direct effect on vascular function. Thus, our data demonstrate that nebivolol restored functional sympatholysis in hypertensive humans by a mechanism that does not involve \u03b21-adrenergic receptors.

    "149": "\u03b22 Adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) is a kind of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which transduce a wide range of extracellular signals into intracellular messages responsible for the regulation of diverse cell functions. Because of their functional ubiquity, GPCR is one of the most important drug targets in pharmaceutical industry. Although recent crystallographic studies provided both the active and the inactive states of some families of GPCRs, the influence of lipid composition of bilayer membrane on their activation is still poorly understood. In this work, we address the influence of lipid composition on the structural stability of GPCR, performing molecular dynamics simulations of three kinds of states: apo-, and agonist epinephrine-, or antagonist alprenolol-bound \u03b22AR. These three kinds of \u03b22ARs were embedded in four types of lipid membranes: (i) pure palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidyl-choline (POPC), (ii) POPC/cholesterol (CHL), (iii) POPC/CHL/GM1 (GM1 ganglioside), (iv) POPC/palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (POPE)/CHL/sphingomyeline (SM). The side chains of Lys267(6.29) and Asp331(7.58) showed different conformations among the three states in all types of lipid membranes. The distances between Lys267(6.29) and Asp331(7.58) of apo- and alprenolol-bound \u03b22ARs are smaller than that of the epinephrine-bound \u03b22AR. In contrast, \u03b22ARs in POPC/CHL bilayer were unstable in which the salt bridge; i.e., ionic lock, was not formed between Arg131(3.50) and Glu268(6.30). We have also examined the distribution of lipid molecules. A stable hydrophobic interaction between CHL and \u03b22AR was observed at transmembrane helix5 in POPC/CHL/GM1 and POPC/POPE/CHL/SM membranes. These results suggest that the lipid composition strongly affects the conformation of GPCR and essentially concerns the GPCR activation.",

It plays a central role in integrating signals from metabolism, energy homeostasis, cell cycle, and stress response. Aberrant PI3K/mTOR activation is commonly observed in diseases such as cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Accordingly, we developed common feature binding hypotheses for a set of 6 potent mTOR antagonists. The generated models were validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. To gain better insight into ligand-mTOR interactions, a homology model for the kinase domain of mTOR was built using the crystallographic structure of PI3K\u03b3 as template. The optimal pharmacophore model was further improved based on detailed docking studies of potent training compound in the homology model. The modified binding model was employed as 3D search query to screen our in-house-built database of established drugs.

It was typified according to two parameters: i) the information carried by HP given SAP changes within the same heart cycle (i.e. 0-step-ahead information) describing immediate effects of SAP variations on HP; ii) the rate of increase of the information carried by HP given SAP changes as a function of the temporal distance, k, between the conditioning SAP pattern and future HP value (i.e. the rate of increase of k-step-ahead information with k) describing short-term effects of SAP modifications on HP. Both parameters were found under vagal control. Indeed, i) 0-step-ahead information suggested that HP and SAP variabilities were significantly coupled from SAP to HP at baseline and after the reduction of the inhibitory effect of sympathetic control on vagal influences performed through the administration of propranolol or clonidine; and ii) during vagal blockade induced by atropine or combined vagal and sympathetic blockade induced by the administration of propranolol after atropine k-step-ahead information reached a level incompatible with coupled HP and SAP dynamics regardless of k. In addition, it was found that the 0-step-ahead information at baseline and after propranolol and the rate of increase of k-step-ahead information with k at baseline could be exclusively explained in terms of linear HP-SAP interactions. Conversely, the same parameters after clonidine suggested the raise of nonlinear mechanisms probably unveiled by the central sympathetic blockade. Comparison with more traditional parameters describing the HP-SAP variability relation such as baroreflex sensitivity and squared HP-SAP coherence confirmed the complementary value of the proposed information domain analysis.",

    "187": "Individual trial data from BEAUTIFUL and SHIFT were pooled to evaluate the effect of ivabradine on the outcomes in patients with LV dysfunction and heart rate \u2265 70 b.p.m. The pooled population (n = 11 897; baseline age 62.3 \u00b1 10.4 years, heart rate 79.6 \u00b1 9.2 b.p.m., and LV ejection fraction 30.3 \u00b1 5.6%) was well treated according to current recommendations (87% beta-blockers, 90% renin-angiotensin system inhibitors). Median follow-up was 21 months. Treatment with ivabradine was associated with a 13% relative risk reduction for the composite of cardiovascular mortality or HF hospitalization (P < 0.001 vs. placebo); this was driven by HF hospitalizations (19%, P < 0.001). There were also significant relative risk reductions for the composite of cardiovascular mortality, HF hospitalizations, or myocardial infarction (MI) hospitalization (15%, P < 0.001); cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal MI (10%, P = 0.023); and MI hospitalization (23%, P = 0.009). Similar results were found in patients with differing clinical profiles. Ivabradine was well tolerated.",

    "189": "Beta-blockers (BB) and statins (S) independently have been shown to reduce perioperative mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) in patients undergoing vascular surgery. In this study we evaluated the benefits of adding aspirin (A) to BB and S (ABBS), with/without angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) on postoperative outcome in high-risk patients undergoing major vascular surgery.", 
    "190": "Analysis of consecutive patients undergoing elective vascular surgery at the University of Michigan Cardiovascular Center was performed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done using cardiac risk index [Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), cerebral vascular disease, renal dysfunction, congestive heart failure, and major surgery]; pulmonary disease; and A, BB, S (ABBS)\u00b1ACE-I use. Baseline clinical characteristics and medication were adjusted using propensity scores. Endpoints were bleeding, 30-day MI, stroke, and 12-month mortality.", 
    "191": "Between 2003 and 2010, 4,149 arterial procedures were performed, 819 of which were risk stratified as RCRI\u22653. The incidence of MI was 3-fold lower (2.5% vs. 7.8%, OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15-0.61, P=0.001) in ABBS\u00b1ACE-I (n=513) as compared with non-ABBS\u00b1ACE-I (n=306). The 12-month mortality was 8-fold lower in ABBS\u00b1ACE-I as compared non-ABBS\u00b1ACE-I (5.9% vs. 37.5%, HR 0.13, 95% CI 0.08-0.20, P<0.0001). After adjustment for the propensity to use various therapies, A (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.24-0.53, P<0.0001), BB (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43-1.0, P=0.05), and S (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.25-0.53, P<0.0001) remained associated with improved 12-month survival. ACE-I use (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54-1.19, P=0.27) was not predictive. Aspirin did not predict severe/moderate bleeding.", 
    "192": "In high-risk patients undergoing major vascular surgery, ABBS therapy has superior 30-day and 12-month risk reduction benefits for MI, stroke, and mortality as compared with A, BB, or S independently. ACE-I did not demonstrate additional risk-reduction benefits.", 
    "193": "Although systemic hypertension is closely associated with aortic aneurysm (AA) formation, there are many patients with AA without hypertension. In these patients, an inflammation-mediated progression of aneurysmal disease is likely responsible for AA growth and eventual rupture. Unfortunately, there remains no reproducible and durable small animal model of aortic aneurysmal disease, the development of which would enable the investigation of the pathophysiology of this vexing condition. The first aim was to establish a useful wild-type mouse model of AA with low mortality. The second aim was to use this model to assess the protective effect of azelnidipine, a new calcium channel blocker, against the progression of the AA independent of its antihypertensive effect.", 
    "194": "Angiotensin II and \u03b2-aminopropionitrile (a lysyl oxidase inhibitor) were administrated subcutaneously in 7-week-old C57BL/6J mice using an osmotic minipump for 4 weeks to generate a wild-type mouse model of AA. Concurrently, azelnidipine (a calcium channel blocker) or a placebo was administrated orally for 4 weeks. Mice were humanely killed and assessed at the end of the 4 weeks of pharmacologic manipulation.", 
    "195": "The combined infusion of angiotensin II and \u03b2-aminopropionitrile induced degenerative aneurysm of the thoracic and/or abdominal aorta (11/12; 92%). The majority of aneurysms were located in the distal aortic arch and suprarenal abdominal aorta. Although there was no difference in systolic blood pressure between the control and azelnidipine-treated groups, azelnidipine significantly reduced the incidence of AA (2/11; 18%). Azelnidipine treatment reduced the pathologic findings normally associated with aneurysm formation within the aortic wall. Azelnidipine also reduced the number of macrophage antigen-3 (MAC-3)-positive cells in the periaortic adipose tissue and reduced the gene expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 within the aortic wall.", 
    "196": "This study demonstrates that combined treatment with angiotensin II and \u03b2-aminopropionitrile induces degenerative AAs in wild-type mice, and azelnidipine prevents aneurysm progression via its anti-inflammatory effect.",

    "198": "The SPE method was used to extract the analytes and IS from human plasma. The chromatographic resolution of AMD, ATL and corresponding IS was achieved using an isocratic flow on a C18 column. The total chromatographic run time was 3 min. A linear response function was established for the range of concentrations 50-8000 pg/ml and 10-800 ng/ml for AMD and ATL, respectively, in human plasma.", 
    "199": "The intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision values for AMD and ATL met the acceptance as per regulatory guidelines. The validated assay was applied to a fixed-dose combination of AMD and ATL (Adopin-AT(\u00ae)) PK study in humans.",

    "201": "Discrete spots selected for droplet-based sampling and automated sample queue generation, for both the autosampler and MS, were enabled by using in-house developed software. In addition, co-registration of spatially resolved sampling positions and HPLC-MS information to generate heat maps of compounds monitored for subsequent data analysis was also available in the software. The system was evaluated with whole-body thin tissue sections from propranolol-dosed rats.",

    "204": "In this prospective, observer-masked, crossover study, 21 POAG patients with untreated intraocular pressure (IOP) >21\u2009mmHg were treated for 6 weeks with timolol 0.5%. Subsequently, we measured inferior temporal retinal artery blood flow in the left eye with subjects seated and then while reclined for 30\u2009min using the Canon Laser Blood Flowmeter. Subjects with a change in retinal blood flow in response to posture change outside of the range previously found in healthy subjects were designated as having RVD and randomized to either D/T or B/T for 6 weeks and re-tested. This was followed by treatment with the opposite medication.", 
    "205": "Seven of the 21 subjects demonstrated RVD in response to posture change following timolol 0.5%. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that lower sOPP was the main determinant of RVD (P=0.033). After treatment with D/T, all 7 converted from RVD to normal RVA status (P=0.001). Four of 6 subjects showed a similar return to normal RVA following B/T (P=0.066). Mid-morning sOPP was 41.1\u00b15.5\u2009mmHg post-timolol, 46.3\u00b16.5\u2009mmHg post-D/T, and 38.6\u00b16.0\u2009mmHg post-B/T (D/T vs. B/T, P=0.026).", 
    "206": "D/T significantly improved RVA in POAG patients exhibiting RVD while on timolol 0.5% alone. D/T also increased sOPP compared to B/T. There was no significant difference (P=0.37) between D/T and B/T in improving RVA.", 
    "207": "High dose insulin (HDI) has proven superior to glucagon and catecholamines in the treatment of poison-induced cardiogenic shock (PICS) in previous animal studies. Standard recommendations for dosing of insulin vary and the optimal dose of HDI in PICS has not been established. Our hypothesis was a dose of 10 U/kg/hr of HDI would be superior to 1 U/kg/hr with cardiac output (CO) as our primary outcome measure in pigs with propranolol-induced PICS.", 
    "208": "This was a blinded, prospective, randomized trial with 4 arms consisting of 4 pigs in each arm. The arms were as follows: placebo (P), 1 U/kg/hr (HDI-1), 5 U/kg/hr (HDI-5), and 10 U/kg/hr (HDI-10). Cardiogenic shock was induced with a bolus of 0.5 mg/kg of propranolol followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/min until the point of toxicity, defined as 0.75 x (HR x MAP) was reached. At this point the propranolol infusion was decreased to 0.125 mg/kg/min and a 20 mL/kg bolus of normal saline (NS) was administered. The protocol was continued for 6 hours or until the animals died.", 
    "209": "2 pigs died in the P arm, 1 pig died each in the HDI-1 and HDI-5 arms, and all pigs lived in the HDI-10 arm. There was a statistically significant difference in dose by time interaction on CO of 1.13 L/min over the 6 hr study period (p = < 0.001). There was also a statistically significant difference in dose by time interaction on MAP, HR, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). No statistically significant difference was found between any of the arms regarding glucose utilization.", 
    "210": "HDI was statistically and clinically significantly superior to placebo in this propranolol model of PICS. Furthermore a dose response over time was found where CO increased corresponding to increases in doses of HDI."
