    "0": "Propafenone is a potent antiarrhythmic agent effective in either supraventricular or ventricular tachyarrhythmias. For proper utilisation, some important pharmacological aspects must be considered, such as nonlinear pharmacokinetics, inability in some patients (poor debrisoquine metabolisers) to oxidise the drug in the liver, existence of at least one active metabolite (5-hydroxy-propafenone) and ability to exert a slight beta-blocking activity. Like all the other antiarrhythmic drugs, propafenone may be associated with adverse effects and may exert proarrhythmic effects. For this reason, its usage must be based on a careful analysis of the risk-benefit ratio, by considering the patient's profile as well as the characteristics of the arrhythmia and its prognostic significance. Propafenone appears to be very effective, and has a favourable risk-benefit profile in the treatment of all supra-ventricular arrhythmias. Particularly, it is effective in converting atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm and in preventing atrial fibrillation recurrences, and is very effective in the pharmacological control of the arrhythmias of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Propafenone is also effective in suppressing ventricular premature complexes and nonsustained ventricular tachycardias. However, because of potential proarrhythmic effects, its use in these arrhythmias must be considered after a careful analysis of the risk-benefit profile, which could be favourable in some patients, but less favourable in others (e.g. patients with coronary artery disease and ventricular dysfunction). In malignant ventricular arrhythmias, further studies are needed to define the limitations of antiarrhythmic drugs in comparison with non-pharmacological treatments, mainly cardioverter/defibrillators. At present, like the other class I antiarrhythmic agents, propafenone does not seem to be a first choice prophylactic agent for malignant ventricular arrhythmias, although more data from controlled studies are needed.",

    "2": "The study was designed as a random-order, double-blinded comparison of 2 parallel treatment groups. Fifty patients with early primary open angle glaucoma or high intraocular pressure were included. The treatment lasted 4 weeks, on the basis of 1 drop twice daily. Diurnal I.O.P. curve was assessed with 4 measurements from 8.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. before and after treatment. The 8.30 a.m. measure of the final assessment of I.O.P. curve was established prior to morning medication. The mean values of the 4 measures were compared.", 
    "3": "Both treatments reduced IOP by a comparable amount: 4.25 +/- 1.2 mmHg (mean +/- SD) for carteolol and 4.69 +/- 1.9 mmHg for timolol. The decrease of IOP was found at every time of assessment, without any significant difference between treatments. Both eye drops were very well tolerated.",

    "5": "d-1 sotalol is one of the most effective antiarrhythmic agents currently available for ventricular tachyarrhythmias, but the recommended infusion rate of 10-20 min is too slow for rapid pharmacological termination of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or for use during cardiac arrest. The safety of the drug and time lag from its rapid administration to onset of significant effects on ventricular refractoriness is unknown. One hundred and nine patients with a history of spontaneous and inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were studied. d-1 sotalol (1.5 mg.kg-1) was infused over 5 min in the first 57 patients (mean age 61 +/- 13 years, mean ejection fraction 37 +/- 15%, range 15-70%). d-1 sotalol was then given over 1 min in the next 52 patients (mean age 61 +/- 12 years, mean ejection fraction 35 +/- 11%, range 18-58%). The time course of change in right ventricular effective refractory period (RVERP) was measured in 15 consecutive patients following the 5 min infusion and in all 52 patients following the bolus injection. Following the 5 min infusion, RVERP increased rapidly from a baseline of 231 +/- 17 ms, reaching a plateau of 268 +/- 23 ms at 10 min. Following the 1 min injection, RVERP increased virtually immediately from a baseline of 237 +/- 25 ms to reach a plateau of 271 +/- 31 ms at 5 min. Two patients (one in each group) developed symptomatic hypotension; both responded to volume replacement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "Short-term fluctuations in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were analysed in a group of twelve males with essential hypertension. Indirect finger BP was measured by a Finapres device. The effect of a 7-day administration of a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker, acebutolol (400 mg/day), was studied in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Compared with placebo, acebutolol caused a significant decrease in BP and HR. In addition, the standard deviation (SD) of BP and HR were reduced after acebutolol in the standing position. Spectral analysis of fluctuations in BP showed a reduction in the variability underlying the SD changes of BP and HR. This reduction predominated in the mid frequency (MF) region corresponding to Mayer waves. This effect was marked for HR since the MF component for standing HR after acebutolol was 46% the placebo level. The average reduction in MF component for standing Systolic BP (SBP) was 36%. No significant correlation was found between the Mayer wave reduction and the systolic, diastolic BP or HR lowering effect of acebutolol. No significant changes in the gain of the transfer function between MF SBP and HR fluctuations in the standing position were observed. The reduced MF component of HR and BP variability after acebutolol could be due to a peripheral cardiac and non-cardiac sympatholytic effect of chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "7": "Membrane permeation-controlled transdermal drug delivery systems were prepared using the natural polymer, chitosan. An adhesive sealing technique was used to construct the devices. Propranolol hydrochloride was selected as the model drug for the present study. Chitosan membranes with different permeability to propranolol hydrochloride obtained by controlled cross-linking with glutaraldehyde were used to regulate the drug release in the devices. Chitosan gel was used as the drug reservoir. The ability of these devices to deliver the drug while supported on rabbit pinna skin was tested by conducting in vitro studies in modified Franz diffusion cells. The drug release profiles showed that the drug delivery is completely controlled by the devices. The rate of drug release was found to be dependent on the type of membrane used.", 
    "8": "Acute respiratory alkalosis (hyperventilation) occurs in clinical settings associated with electrolyte-induced complications such as cardiac arrhythmias (such as myocardial infarction, sepsis, hypoxemia, cocaine abuse). To evaluate the direction, magnitude and mechanisms of plasma potassium changes, acute respiratory alkalosis was induced by voluntary hyperventilation for 20 (18 and 36 liter/min) and 35 minutes (18 liter/min). The plasma potassium response to acute respiratory alkalosis was compared to time control, isocapnic and isobicarbonatemic (hypocapnic) hyperventilation as well as beta- and alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade by timolol and phentolamine. Hypocapnic hypobicarbonatemic hyperventilation (standard acute respiratory alkalosis) at 18 or 36 liter/min (delta PCO2-16 and -22.5 mm Hg, respectively) resulted in significant increases in plasma potassium (ca + 0.3 mmol/liter) and catecholamine concentrations. During recovery (post-hyperventilation), a ventilation-rate-dependent hypokalemic overshoot was observed. Alpha-adrenoreceptor blockade obliterated, and beta-adrenoreceptor blockade enhanced the hyperkalemic response. The hyperkalemic response was prevented under isocapnic and isobicarbonatemic hypocapnic hyperventilation. During these conditions, plasma catecholamine concentrations did not change. In conclusion, acute respiratory alkalosis results in a clinically significant increase in plasma potassium. The hyperkalemic response is mediated by enhanced alpha-adrenergic activity and counterregulated partly by beta-adrenergic stimulation. The increased catecholamine concentrations are accounted for by the decrease in plasma bicarbonate.", 
    "9": "Adrenaline infusion of 0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 in healthy volunteers results in an increase of hepatic glucose production, an increase of the absolute number of occupied beta-adrenoceptors and specific changes in metabolism. To compare these effects with the changes induced by an endogenous catecholamine release, we investigated healthy volunteers during cycle ergometry. After fasting at least 14 h seven healthy subjects exercised for 90 min at an intensity of 20% below their individual anaerobic threshold. The rate of glucose production as well as the turnover rates of alanine and leucine were calculated using stable isotope tracers. High and low affinity beta-adrenergic binding sites on lymphocytes were determined by an equilibrium binding assay with (-)125 Iodocyanopindolol. After 90 min of cycling the rate of appearance of glucose increased significantly from means of 2.0 (SD 0.2) to 2.65 (SD 0.50) mg.kg-1.min-1 with unchanged blood concentrations of glucose and lactate. The flux of the amino acids alanine and leucine decreased significantly from means of 0.91 (SD 0.21) to 0.62 (SD 0.14) mg.kg-1.min-1 and from 0.40 (SD 0.05) to 0.32 (SD 0.04) mg.kg-1.min-1, respectively. The mean free fatty acid concentration increased significantly from 0.65 (SD 0.33) to 1.27 (SD 0.45) mmol.l-1 during the endurance trial. The increase of glucose turnover and the decrease of amino acid flux point to a metabolic shift towards enhanced utilization of free fatty acids. Adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations showed a moderate but significant increase from means of 0.61 (SD 0.20) to 0.99 (SD 0.36) nmol.l-1 and from 2.27 (SD 0.75) to 3.46 (SD 0.38) nmol.l-1, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "We evaluated the prognosis among consecutive patients hospitalized for acute chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in relation to whether they were on chronic treatment with beta-blockers at onset of symptoms or not. In all, 3,504 patients were included in the analyses, of whom 936 (27%) were on chronic beta-blockade. Of the patients on beta-blockade, 25% developed AMI as compared with 21% of the remaining patients (p > 0.2). The mortality during the first 28 days was 7% in patients on chronic beta-blockade as compared with 5% in those not on beta-blockade (p > 0.2). When correcting for differences at baseline, chronic treatment with beta-blockers did not significantly influence the outcome.", 
    "11": "Basing on ECG findings, the authors compare hemodynamic effects of a single dose of isadrin, obsidan and spesicor in patients with coronary heart disease complicated by bundle-branch block. Isadrin improves left ventricular contractility, reduces pulmonary hypertension and right heart overload. Obsidan and spesicor aggravate the existing hemodynamic disorders in the above patients.", 
    "12": "The aim of this study was to determine whether changes in the transport of drugs into the brain could be determined by in vivo intracerebral microdialysis. Atenolol was used as a model drug to determine blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport characteristics. In rats, unilateral opening of the blood-brain barrier was achieved by infusion of hyperosmolar mannitol (25%, w/v) into the left internal carotid artery. BBB transport, expressed as the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) of atenolol in brain extracellular fluid over plasma, was three times higher for the mannitol treated hemisphere as compared with the contralateral brain or after infusion of saline, being (mean +/- SEM) 0.094 +/- 0.024 (n = 16), 0.029 +/- 0.007 (n = 12) and 0.030 +/- 0.009 (n = 12) respectively. Further evaluation of the data indicated that for experiments performed in the morning the mannitol infusion had little effect on the extent of transport of atenolol into the brain, while in the afternoon BBB transport was about 10-fold higher than in the contralateral and saline group. The mean \"afternoon\" ratios +/- SEM were 0.155 +/- 0.038 (n = 8), 0.012 +/- 0.003 (n = 6) and 0.018 +/- 0.006 (n = 6) respectively. It is concluded that intracerebral microdialysis is capable of revealing changes in BBB transport and regional and time-dependent differences in drug levels can be demonstrated with the use of this technique.", 
    "13": "Until recently neither the extent of antihypertensive drug usage in Iceland nor its distribution among drug classes was known. Of the 1,145 men aged 70-84 years alive in 1991, 834 participated in a study carried out by Hjartnavernd, the Heart Association. A history of hypertension or the presence of high blood pressure when measured at the Associations institute were found in 429 men, of whom 157 were on medication for hypertension alone: 95 on single drug treatment, 49 on two drugs, and five on three drugs, no information being available for the remaining eight. The most widely used drugs were diuretics or beta-blockers, of which diuretics apparently yielded better results. Of combined regiments, that of beta-blockers and diuretics was by far the most common, followed by ACE- (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors and diuretics, and beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. Thus, both medical and economic factors suggest that diuretics should be used in this age group.", 
    "14": "Previous studies have suggested that racial differences may exist in beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responsiveness. However, no clear conclusions can be drawn based on these studies because of the confounding effect of the parasympathetic nervous system on responses to isoproterenol bolus doses. In this study, we blocked the effects of the parasympathetic nervous system with atropine, to determine whether racial differences exist in sensitivity to beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation and blockade. Sixteen healthy black and white men participated in the study. Atropine was administered before all studies to induce parasympathetic blockade. Isoproterenol sensitivity studies and treadmill exercise were then performed in the with and without beta-adrenoceptor blockade by propranolol. Responses measured included heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and tremor. The average isoproterenol dose producing a 25-beat/min increase in HR was more than twofold higher in blacks than in whites (3.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.4 micrograms, respectively, p < 0.05). There were no racial differences in response to beta-adrenoreceptor blockade. Our results showed that during parasympathetic blockade blacks were less sensitive to the chronotropic effects of isoproterenol than whites. We conclude that these response differences are due to greater beta-adrenoceptor sensitivity in whites than in blacks.", 
    "15": "The effects of isradipine and atenolol on platelet function and fibrinolytic activity were studied in 10 male patients with mild untreated hypertension. After a 2-week placebo run-in period, the volunteers were randomized to either isradipine 2.5 mg twice daily or atenolol 100 mg daily for a 6-month period. Those initially receiving isradipine then received atenolol and vice versa. After each therapy regimen, blood was drawn at rest and 1 h after exercise during a maximum exercise test. Platelet activity in vivo was estimated as release of B-TG and PF-4. Fibrinolytic activity was estimated as the fast-acting inhibitor against tissue plasminogen activator usually termed PAI-1. During atenolol and isradipine therapy, blood pressure (BP) was equally reduced (p < 0.05). Heart rate (HR) decreased during atenolol treatment but was not changed by isradipine. Platelet activity in vivo estimated as B-TG and PF-4 decreased irrespective of therapy (p < 0.02). During atenolol, as during placebo therapy, exercise resulted in a significant increase in platelet activity, as shown by an increase in B-TG (p < 0.02) and in PF-4 (p < 0.01). Such increase was not observed during isradipine treatment. Both treatments tended to improve fibrinolysis, as shown by a decrease in PAI, 1 h after exercise. Reducing BP with isradipine or atenolol results in a similar decrease in platelet activity and PAI-level, tested at rest and 1 h after rest, respectively. During exercise, platelet activity increased during atenolol treatment; such change did not occur during isradipine treatment.", 
    "16": "We investigated the effect of angiotensin II (AII) on cardiac refractoriness in muscle trabeculae isolated from adult rat ventricle. Strength-interval curves were initially obtained under control conditions and after exposure of the muscle to Tyrode's solution containing 10(-9) M AII. AII displaced the strength-interval curves to the left. The minimal current intensity needed to elicit a propagated response was reduced by AII for all intervals used. The effect of AII was not influenced by propranolol 10(-6) M or phentolamine 10(-7) M but was blocked by 250 microM DuP 753. No change in resting potential was observed with 10(-9) M AII, but action potential duration at 50% APD50 of its amplitude was reduced by 25% and conduction velocity was appreciably decreased (41%). The effect of the peptide on APD was blocked by DuP 753. Spontaneous discharges of APs were elicited by a single stimulus in fibers exposed to 10(-9) M AII, supporting the view that AII has an arrhythmogenic action.", 
    "17": "Nonselective beta-blockers may reduce exercise performance, not only through hemodynamic but also through metabolic effects. During prolonged physical exertion, lipolysis induced by plasma epinephrine occurs through beta-adrenoceptors of adipocytes. Therefore, beta-blockade may reduce release of free fatty acids (FFA) from adipocytes and consequently the energy supply for muscle cells. In this single-blind study, we compared the metabolic effects of atenolol with those of doxazosin, an alpha 1-blocker, during exercise in 26 young volunteers (age 20-35 years). All subjects performed an exercise test on a bicycle ergometer 5 h after consuming a standard breakfast. The starting workload of 50 W was increased by 30 W every 3 min until maximal heart rate (HR) was achieved; after a 2-min recovery period at 50 W the test was continued for 15 min at 60% maximal workload. Before and at the end of the test, blood samples were taken for glucose, lactate, and FFA determination. After 1 week, the test was repeated; the volunteers randomly received atenolol or doxazosin for 2 days before the second test. Exercise performance, plasma glucose, and lactate were not affected by either drug. The concentration of FFA was unchanged in subjects treated with doxazosin but was significantly reduced after the test in subjects treated with atenolol. Our data demonstrate that neither doxazosin nor atenolol impairs exercise performance in young volunteers. Atenolol reduces plasma FFA concentration possibly by inhibiting lipolysis. Doxazosin, in contrast, does not alter this parameter. Therefore, doxazosin may be a antihypertensive drug of potential benefit in treatment of hypertensive patients engaging in sports or undergoing a program of physical training.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "We previously demonstrated that right atrial strips from patients treated with beta 1-selective antagonists exhibit sensitization of beta 2-adrenergic responses in vitro. We also showed that cardiac beta 2-adrenergic sensitization can be induced in normal subjects prospectively by beta 1-blocker treatment. To determine whether such cross-talk could be induced in vitro, we studied beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasorelaxation in deendothelialized rings of human coronary artery from patients undergoing cardiac transplantation. After incubation with 10 microM phenoxybenzamine for 1 h, concentration-effect curves were determined to norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EPI), with or without 300 nM CGP 20712A (a beta 1-selective antagonist), 50 nM ICI 118551 (a beta 2-selective antagonist), or both antagonists. Both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic components to vasorelaxation were detected. Other rings were incubated for 16 h with either 1 microM NE (a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist) or 300 nM CGP 20712A, or both. After washout, concentration-effect curves were determined to EPI in the presence of 300 nM CGP 20712A (beta 2-adrenergic responses). No differences in beta 2-adrenergic vasorelaxation were noted after prolonged incubation with either CGP 20712A or the combination of CGP 20712A and NE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "NMR methods were developed for the determination of the racemate composition in nadolol raw materials. With high-field instruments (400 MHz or greater) the racemate ratio may be determined by the relative heights of the t-butyl peaks, which are well enough resolved for this determination. For lower field spectrometers, the t-butyl peaks are not resolved. An NMR method has been developed which involves preparation of the tribenzoate derivative of the drug. Seven lots of nadolol raw material, as well as several standards, were analysed for their racemate content. Three lots of raw material did not meet the USP limits of 40-60% for racemate A. Of these, two were granular in appearance and were found to vary markedly in racemate composition in successive analyses. The results for all the materials of uniform content agree very well with those from the HPLC method, as well as for the USP IR method using the absorbance at the corrected wavelength.", 
    "20": "A conventional patch clamp amplifier was used to test the feasibility of measuring whole-cell ionic currents under voltage clamp conditions from beta-cells in intact mouse islets of Langerhans perifused with bicarbonate Krebs buffer at 37 degrees C. Cells impaled with a high resistance microelectrode (ca. 0.150 G omega) were identified as beta-cells by the characteristic burst pattern of electrical activity induced by 11 mM glucose. Voltage-dependent outward K+ currents were enhanced by glucose both in the presence and absence of physiological bicarbonate buffer and also by bicarbonate regardless of the presence or absence of glucose. For comparison with the usual patch clamp protocol, similar measurements were made from single rat beta-cells at room temperature; glucose did not enhance the outward currents in these cells. Voltage-dependent inward currents were recorded in the presence of tetraethylammonium (TEA), an effective blocker of the K+ channels known to be present in the beta-cell membrane. Inward currents exhibited a fast component with activation-inactivation kinetics and a delayed component with a rather slow inactivation; inward currents were dependent on Ca2+ in the extracellular solution. These results suggest the presence of either two types of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels or a single type with fast and slow inactivation. We conclude that it is feasible to use a single intracellular microelectrode to measure voltage-gated membrane currents in the beta-cell within the intact islet at 37 degrees C, under conditions that support normal glucose-induced insulin secretion and that glucose enhances an as yet unidentified voltage-dependent outward K+ current.", 
    "21": "Twelve healthy male volunteers cycled to exhaustion at a workload corresponding to 70% of maximal aerobic power after administration of 80 mg of the beta 1+2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol and after administration of placebo by mouth. Exercise times until exhaustion were 39 +/- 7 and 86 +/- 7 min in the propranolol and placebo groups, respectively. Muscle inosine 5'-monophosphate content was significantly increased above resting levels at exhaustion after placebo. At exhaustion after propranolol, inosine 5'-monophosphate was not increased significantly and was lower than at exhaustion after placebo. No changes in ATP and the total adenine nucleotide content during exercise were found in the two tests. Muscle glycogen content was significantly reduced at exhaustion after placebo as well as after propranolol, but the levels were still significantly higher at exhaustion after propranolol than after placebo. No evidence for a shift in glycogen utilization among types I, IIa, and IIb fibers after propranolol was found. The results show that neither an imbalance between ATP utilization and ATP regeneration nor premature glycogen depletion, either in the whole muscle or in specific muscle fiber types, provides a satisfactory explanation for the premature fatigue during endurance exercise after propranolol.", 
    "22": "In catfish hepatocytes (Ictalurus punctatus) alpha 1-adrenergic activation by epinephrine or norepinephrine increased cytosol Ca2+ concentration. This effect was inhibited by alpha 1-adrenergic antagonists with the potency order WB4101 > benoxathian > or = 5-methylurapidil > phentolamine > (+)niguldipine. Pretreatment with the irreversible antagonist, chloroethylclonidine, reduced the alpha 1-adrenergic effect. alpha 1-Adrenergic stimulation also increased the resynthesis of phosphatidylinositol in whole cells. In liver membranes, a relatively small (33 fmol/mg of protein) number of sites with high affinity (Kd 100 pM) for the radioligand [125I]HEAT was detected. Binding competition experiments showed the following orders of potency: (1) for agonists, oxymetazoline > epinephrine > or = norepinephrine > methoxamine; (2) for antagonists, prazosin > WB4101 > benoxathian > or = 5-methylurapidil > phentolamine > (+)niguldipine. Membrane pretreatment with chloroethylclonidine markedly reduced [125I]HEAT binding. Good correlation was observed between the radioligand binding studies and the functional data with isolated cells. The present data suggest that the alpha 1-adrenoceptor present in catfish liver cells belongs to the alpha 1B subtype.", 
    "23": "1. Contribution of cyclic GMP generation to the relaxation by nipradilol of vascular smooth muscle was studied in the isolated rabbit aorta contracted by phenylephrine (10(-7) M) or prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha, 3 x 10(-6) M). 2. Nipradilol-induced relaxation in both contractions and increase in cyclic GMP content were inhibited by methylene blue (10(-5) M). 3. The relations between the increase in cyclic GMP and the relaxation produced by nipradilol and nitroglycerin were fitted to sigmoid curves. The increase in cyclic GMP at 50% relaxation by nipradilol was smaller than that by nitroglycerin (1.2-fold increase as against 3-fold increase). 4. These results suggest a smaller contribution of cyclic GMP generation through activation of soluble guanylate cyclase to nipradilol-induced relaxation in the rabbit aorta.", 
    "24": "Although it has been recognised that alterations in gastrointestinal motility, whether induced by physiological or pathological processes, have significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of orally administered drugs, this subject has received inappropriately little attention. Studies relating to this topic have focused on healthy volunteers and animals and have largely been confined to the effects of single drug doses. There is limited information about the effects of disease on pharmacokinetics under steady-state conditions. Changes in gastrointestinal motility may affect the pharmacokinetics of orally administered drugs by altering the rate of delivery, bioavailability or mucosal absorption of the drug. In general the rate of absorption and time taken to achieve maximal plasma concentrations for well absorbed drugs may be modified by changes in gastrointestinal motility, but overall bioavailability is not usually affected. In these cases the therapeutic and clinical effects of the alteration in pharmacokinetics will, therefore, depend on which parameters are important for the action of the drug. For poorly absorbed drugs both the rate of absorption and bioavailability are likely to be altered by changes in gastrointestinal motility. However, the complex effects of food and disease, as well as the properties and formulation of any drug (solubility, ease of dispersion, delayed release formulation) often make the prediction of the magnitude, or even the direction, of any effect difficult to predict. Drugs with direct effects on gastrointestinal motility may influence their own patterns of absorption. In patients with gastrointestinal motility disorders, drugs administered in a controlled release formulation, or those with poor bioavailability, are most likely to have a poorly predictable therapeutic effect. Care should be taken to ensure that the formulation of the drug, its timing of administration in relation to meals and the use of coadministered drugs optimise, or at least ensure consistent absorption.", 
    "25": "The effects on sleep of atenolol and clonidine were compared in 8 hypertensive men (mean age 46.9 years, range 16-56 years) without prior history of sleep disturbances. Polygraphic sleep recordings were performed at baseline (NO) and after a single oral dose of atenolol (100 mg) or clonidine (0.15 mg) at 6:00 pm at a 48-hour interval in a double-blind randomized crossover protocol. Both medications lowered arterial pressure to a similar extent. The subjective quality of sleep was judged satisfactory after both medications, the number of patients reporting dreams decreased from 5 (NO) to 1 after each treatment night. Total sleep time decreased slightly but not significantly after atenolol (440 +/- 63 min vs 474 +/- 47 min at baseline). Sleep latency was not affected after atenolol but significantly decreased after clonidine (16.9 +/- 21.6 vs 28.6 +/- 16.6 at baseline, p < 0.02). Although rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep time decreased after atenolol (71 +/- 30 min vs 95 +/- 30 min at baseline, p < 0.05), the percentage of REM sleep was unchanged (22 +/- 7% vs 23 +/- 5%). In contrast, clonidine strikingly reduced both REM sleep time (54 +/- 28 min vs 95 +/- 30 min at baseline, p < 0.002) and percentage of REM sleep (14 +/- 6% vs 23 +/- 5%, p < 0.0005). Thus atenolol tends to decrease total sleep time but does not affect the normal architecture of sleep, clonidine has a marked hypnotic effect, similar to that of some sedative medications and significantly reduces REM sleep.", 
    "26": "The changes occurring in the collagen content in the residual myocardium after infarction have been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to determine the changes in the collagen content in the right and left ventricular muscle of chronically infarcted hearts. Male albino rats were submitted to ligature of the left coronary artery to produce infarction (Inf). Controls underwent a sham surgery (Sh). Inf rats were divided into groups designed to receive chronic therapy with propranolol (Prop, 1 g/l, n = 10) or hydralazine (Hydr, 0.125 g/l, n = 10) dissolved in the drinking water. One group of Inf rats (n = 12) and the Sh group (n = 10) received no treatment. The animals were killed 1 month after surgery to obtain the cardiac wet weights and to determine protein and hydroxyproline (OH-Pro) concentrations in the right ventricle (RV) free wall and in the left ventricular remaining muscle (LV), including the interventricular septum. Inf determined a 42% increase of the RV weight to body weight ratio (Sh = 0.57 +/- 0.04 mg/g; Inf = 0.81 +/- 0.06 mg/g; p < 0.05) and a 64% increase of OH-Pro concentration (Sh = 450 +/- 25 micrograms/g; Inf = 738 +/- 32 micrograms/g; p < 0.05). In Inf hearts the LV OH-Pro concentration increased similarly as in the RV. No effect of drug therapy was observed in the LV. In the RV however, propranolol reduced the hypertrophy and the OH-Pro concentration by the same amount (around 30%). Hydr on the other hand reduced OH-Pro and tended to increase hypertrophy. We conclude that a similar collagen deposition occurs in the myocardium of both ventricles after infarction in rats. Prop and Hydr were able to partially reduce this collagen increase in the right but not in the left ventricle.", 
    "27": "We functionally expressed alpha 2-adrenergic, beta 2-adrenergic, and delta-opioid receptors in Xenopus laevis oocytes. We detected receptor function as changes in currents carried by adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated chloride channels provided by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and recorded by two-electrode voltage clamp. Co-application of forskolin and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) or IBMX alone produced currents with a reversal potential indicative of chloride ions only in oocytes previously injected with mRNA encoding CFTR. Isoproterenol produced concentration-dependent responses in oocytes injected with mRNA encoding beta 2-adrenergic receptors and CFTR, and co-administration of propranolol antagonized these responses. Similarly, the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist UK14304 increased IBMX-induced currents only in oocytes injected with mRNA encoding alpha 2-adrenergic receptors and CFTR, and idazoxan antagonized these enhancements. The delta-opioid agonist DADLE produced concentration-related, naloxone-reversible increases in IBMX- and forskolin-induced currents only in oocytes injected with mRNA encoding delta-opioid receptors and CFTR. In oocytes co-injected with alpha 2, beta 2, and CFTR mRNAs, isobolographic analysis revealed an additive interaction between alpha 2- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors. These studies establish the oocyte as a cell system for studying the interactions among cAMP-modulating G protein-coupled receptors and provide another example of alternative coupling of alpha 2-adrenergic and delta-opioid receptors to G proteins, possibly Gs proteins, other than Gi proteins.", 
    "28": "A large number of studies have shown the prognosis after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to be favorably affected by treatment with beta blockers. Whether such treatment also will have a favorable effect on the prognosis in patients in whom AMI was not confirmed has not been shown. A study was undertaken at Sahlgren's Hospital, G\u00f6teborg, to determine risk indicators for death and prognosis among 1,443 patients in whom AMI was not confirmed and who survived hospitalization in relation to whether or not beta blockers were prescribed at discharge. One-year mortality was determined and p values were corrected for differences at baseline. Of the 1,443 patients who participated in the analyses, 44% were prescribed beta blockers. They differed from the remaining patients by younger age, predominance of men, a more frequent history of AMI, angina pectoris, and hypertension, and a less frequent history of congestive heart failure. Patients in whom beta blockers were prescribed had a 1-year mortality of 6% compared with 16% in those not on beta blockers (p < 0.001). The difference was similar in various subgroups according to clinical history.", 
    "29": "During the past 25 years recommendations for treating hypertension have evolved from a stepped-care approach to monotherapy or sequential monotherapy as experience has been gained and new antihypertensive agents have been introduced. In an effort to develop a disease management strategy for hypertension, we investigated the prescribing patterns of initial medication therapy for newly treated hypertensive patients.", 
    "30": "We examined paid claims data of an open-panel HMO located in the midwest. Charts from 377 patients with newly treated hypertension from a group of 12,242 hypertensive patients in a health insurance population of 85,066 persons were studied. The type of medication regimen received by patients newly treated for hypertension during an 18-month period was categorized into monotherapy, sequential monotherapy, stepped care, and initial treatment with multiple agents. With monotherapy, the class of medication was also reported. Associations between use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, or beta-blockers and presence of comorbid conditions were reported.", 
    "31": "Fifty-five percent of patients received monotherapy, 22 percent received stepped care, and 18 percent received sequential monotherapy. Of those 208 patients receiving monotherapy, 30 percent were prescribed a calcium channel blocker, 22 percent an ACE inhibitor, and 14 percent a beta-blocker. No customization of treatment for comorbid conditions was noted.", 
    "32": "Physicians attempt to treat patients' hypertension with monotherapy. In the majority of cases, they have used either a calcium channel blocker or ACE inhibitor as initial monotherapy. Costs for treating hypertension could be reduced and care improved if thiazide diuretics, a combination of potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics, or beta-blockers were used more frequently as initial monotherapy.", 
    "33": "Carvedilol is an antihypertensive agent which displays unselective beta-blocking, alpha 1-blocking and antioxidant properties. It is primarily metabolized by the liver and excreted via the biliary system. The compound is highly lipophilic and strongly bound to plasma proteins. Consequently, there is no elimination during hemodialysis. The efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profile of carvedilol titrated to effect were investigated in an open clinical trial in 15 long-term hemodialysis patients with arterial hypertension over a period of 12 weeks. The drug was administered only on days without dialysis. After a wash-out phase of one week, carvedilol was started in a dose of 12.5 mg per day. All 15 patients were titrated according to the antihypertensive effect to a daily dose of 25 mg of carvedilol. Carvedilol was effective in lowering blood pressure in hemodialysis patients (RR systolic: 170 +/- 11 vs. 144 +/- 9 mmHg; RR diastolic: 98 +/- 10 vs. 85 +/- 10 mmHg). The pharmacokinetic parameters of carvedilol and its active metabolite M2, assessed in 12 of the 15 patients, were not influenced by the lack of renal function or intermittend haemodialysis. In particular, there was no accumulation of carvedilol or its metabolite M2. In terms of side effects, three patients had to be withdrawn from the trial, because of hypoglycemia (n = 1), insufficient blood pressure control (n = 1) and prolonged hypotension (n = 1). Taken together, these results indicate that carvedilol is a safe and efficacious antihypertensive agent which can be used in patients maintained by maintenance dialysis treatment.",

Baseline tension control and echocardiogram and each three months after starting therapy during the two phases of the study were performed. Thickness of the interventricular septum and posterior left ventricular wall in mm, left ventricular mass index in g/m2 were determined.", 
    "36": "The baseline septum was 15 +/- 3.3 mm, 14.6 +/- 3.1 mm at 9 months and 14.5 +/- 2.9 mm at 18 months, the posterior wall was 14.1 +/- 3.1 mm at baseline, 13.7 +/- 2.9 mm at 9 months and 13.6 +/- 2.9 mm at 18 months. The left ventricular mass index was 153 +/- 45 g/m2 at baseline, 146 +/- 36 g/m2 at 9 months and 144 +/- 39 g/m2 at 18 months. The antihypertensive efficacy at rest and under exertion was similar for the two doses of chlortalidone.",

    "38": "The mechanisms of digoxin-induced ventricular arrhythmias were studied in vivo using a novel experimental model. Anesthetized guinea pigs were instrumented with custom-made electrode catheters which enabled the monitoring and recording of right atrial, right ventricular, and His bundle electrograms, midmyocardial monophasic action potentials (MAP), and systemic arterial blood pressure. Intravenous digoxin induced ventricular arrhythmias ranging from ventricular premature contractions (VPCs) to ventricular fibrillation (VF). These were associated with delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) observed on the MAP recordings. The severity of the arrhythmias depended on the dose of digoxin. Short bursts of ventricular pacing neither terminated nor suppressed episodes of ventricular tachycardias (VTs). A direct relationship existed between the paced ventricular cycle length and the coupling interval between the last paced beat and the first ectopic beat (r = 0.913, P < 0.001, n = 10) and between the amplitude of the DADs and the pacing rate (r = 0.972, P < 0.05, n = 7). The increased contractility (LV dp/dt) and heart rate evoked by isoproterenol (0.1 microgram/kg) did not induce DADs in the absence of digoxin. Verapamil terminated the digoxin-induced VTs in 15 of 16 animals and abolished the associated DADs in 7 of 7 animals. Adenosine terminated the VTs in 15 of 19 animals and abolished the DADs in 8 of 10 animals. Digoxin induced VT in only 1 of 6 animals treated with reserpine (5 + 5 mg/kg) 24 and 48h prior to experimentation. However, subsequent intravenous isoproterenol (0.2 micrograms/kg) induced VT and DADs, both of which were abolished by verapamil, in all 6 animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "Urapidil is a vasodilator acting on peripheral vessels by alpha-1 adrenoceptor blockade, and on central nervous system by alphaadrenoceptor blockade on the tractus solitarius nuclei and stimulation of serotoninergic receptors. Its hepatic metabolism and central action explain the absence of rebound effect when treatment is stopped. Urapidil is an arterial and venous vasodilator in systemic and pulmonary circulation. Therefore urapidil decreases systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures and left and right ventricular preload. These effects are accompanied by moderate effects on heart rate, and increased cardiac output in patients with heart failure. Some adverse effects observed with other vasodilators are absent (increased intracranial pressure and intrapulmonary shunt, negative inotropic effect, tachycardia). IV urapidil is used to treat systemic arterial hypertension perioperatively and hypertensive emergencies. Moreover urapidil has been administered to treat pulmonary artery hypertension in chronic pulmonary disease. Its haemodynamic effects seem proportional to the basal activity of alpha-adrenoceptors. Therefore, wide individual variations in active doses are observed from 12.5 to 50 mg as i.v. bolus in adults. Thereafter i.v. continuous administration or oral treatment may be necessary, depending on the cause of hypertension.", 
    "40": "A multicenter randomized controlled trial was performed to compare antihypertensive effects and tolerance of captopril monotherapy with those of reference drugs from three other main groups of antihypertensive drugs: propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine. The trial included 345 males with essential hypertension stage I-II by WHO criteria. Evaluable patients after 8 months of treatment comprised 85.8%. 8-month monotherapy with captopril, nifedipine, hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol was completed by 53.49%, 75.28%, 45.78% of patients, respectively. An antihypertensive effect was reached in 57.97% of patients on monotherapy. Normalization of arterial pressure took place in 51.3%. The 4 drugs in the given doses produced a significant and similar effect in relation to the action on arterial pressure (absolute value). As for individual effects (complete and partial), captopril and propranolol were equal, nifedipine was more beneficial than hydrochlorothiazide. Side effects in captopril monotherapy arose 1.5-2 times less frequently than in response to propranolol or nifedipine and were similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "41": "The hemodynamic changes of metoprolol (Met, 50 mg.kg-1.d-1, po, 3 wk) withdrawal for 1 day and the effects of nifedipine (Nif) and m-nifedipine (m-Nif) on these changes were observed in pressure overload hypertrophy in rats by abdominal aortic constriction for 4 wk. Both Nif and m-Nif (10 mg.kg-1.d-1, respectively, po, 3 wk) significantly attenuated the increase of MAP (from 14.3 +/- 2.3 to 12.9 +/- 2.3 and 11.3 +/- 2.4 kPa, respectively, n = 6-7, P < 0.05) and decrease the abnormal development of systolic function of left ventricle after Met withdrawal. Radioreceptor assay indicates that Nif and m-Nif can prevent the up-regulation of myocardium beta-receptors in left ventricular hypertrophy and large dose of Met exposure for a long time. These results suggest that calcium antagonists administered with beta-blockers can prevent beta-receptor blocker withdrawal syndrome.",

    "43": "Rats were submitted to 110 dB white noise exposure for 1, and 6 hours and brain alpha 1, beta 1 and benzodiazepine receptor binding was evaluated with selective ligands. An increase in cerebral benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) concentration, without any significant change in affinity constant, occurred after the 6 h treatment; no change was observed in adrenergic receptor binding at any period of exposure. Both diazepam and clonazepam pre-treatment reversed the effects of noise on CBR binding, confirming a role of these receptors in the response to noise stress. Furthermore, these benzodiazepine agonists influenced the response of cardiac and aortic tissues, which are known to be changed by stress exposure. Diazepam and clonazepam pre-treatment protected cardiac tissue from the effects of 6h noise stress, and a potentiation of aortic responses was detected, although at different times of exposure. The differences between the responses of these peripheral tissues to benzodiazepine treatment suggest that the expression depends on the tissue examined and the period of exposure.", 
    "44": "The aim of the present study was to ascertain the comparative efficacy of cyclandelate, a migraine prophylactic with calcium overload blocking properties, versus propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker, and placebo. Based on different statistical analysis procedures (including time series analysis) a responder and nonresponder evaluation for cyclandelate and propranolol was performed. In addition, an attempt was made to identify the dose relationship of the various drugs on headache parameters. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study 84 patients were treated in a placebo run-in phase (4 weeks). The patients were then randomized by the statistical criterion of placebo responder and nonresponder to either the cyclandelate or the propranolol group. The total treatment period included a low-dosage phase (8 weeks) and high-dosage phase (8 weeks). All patients kept a headache diary before, during and after treatment. The data were assessed by time series analysis (ARIMA), as well as by analysis of variance and nonparametric statistics. Based on ARIMA statistics, 39.3% of the patients showed a significant improvement of migraine during treatment with cyclandelate compared with 29.4% placed on propranolol. Higher doses of cyclandelate and propranolol were more effective. Using the qualitative response-criterion of a 50% reduction in migraine symptoms, cyclandelate showed a response in 67.9% and propranolol in 41.2% of all cases. It can therefore be concluded that cyclandelate as well as propranolol are two comparable substances in the prophylactic treatment of migraine, with cyclandelate showing fewer side effects.", 
    "45": "In sum, systolic dysfunction of the ventricle associated with left ventricular outlet obstruction and often with mitral valve regurgitation may be improved by myotomy, myomectomy, mitral valve replacement, and perhaps by the creation of left bundle branch block via DDD right ventricular pacing. Diastolic dysfunction of the ventricle may be improved by prolonging the diastolic filling period, shortening the isovolumic relaxation period with calcium channel blocking drugs, or perhaps by altering the atrioventricular activation time with a DDD pacemaker. The symptoms and complications of associated arrhythmias may be improved by medication, particularly with beta-blockers, which tend to stabilize the atrial rhythm and perhaps the ventricular rhythms. In treating patients with demonstrated ventricular arrhythmias, other antiarrhythmic agents may be helpful. (Table II summarizes the abnormalities, causes, and treatments of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.) Epicardial coronary atherosclerosis is not rare in these patients, and arteriographic confirmation may lead to improvement by surgical bypass treatment. Since stroke volume is nearly fixed, cardiac output depends very much on heart rate. For this reason, each patient needs to receive the appropriate dosage of medications to achieve the optimal heart rate for his or her own physiologic state.",

During the follow-up (one year duration) were evaluated on I, III, VI and XII months the number and tolerance of the atrial fibrillation recurrences, cardiac and/or noncardiac side effects. The patients with more than two recurrences in the same follow-up interval withdrew from the study. In each patient 14 clinical and laboratory variables were evaluated.", 
    "48": "After 12 months were arrhythmia-free respectively 70% of Group A patients, 60% of Group B patients, 27% of Group C patients. Univariate analysis showed that treatment with F was related to decrease of atrial fibrillation recurrences (one recurrence 67%, two recurrences 81%, three recurrences 81%), treatment with S was related to decrease of recurrences (two recurrences 59%); the variable most significantly related to the risk of arrhythmia recurrence is the higher value of basal cardiac rate (one recurrence t = 2.15, two t = 2.22, three t = 2.96, four t = 2.06). There was not statistically significant difference in maintenance of sinus rhythm at the end of the follow-up between the groups of patients on F and S (p = 0.163); treatment efficacy was significantly higher than P (p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that treatment with F and S decreases the risk of arrhythmia recurrence respectively of 85% and 76% versus placebo at the end of the follow-up. The incidence of cardiac and/or noncardiac side effects was not clinically significant.", 
    "49": "F and S are both effective and safe for prevention of PAF, with 70% and 60% respectively of patients arrhythmia-free after 12 months of treatment. Side effects were common, but clinically significant adverse events were uncommon.

    "50": "The enantiomers of alprenolol, metoprolol, and propranolol have been separated on an enantioselective cellulase column and analysed using a fully automated HPLC system involving coupled column chromatography and fluorescence detection. The assays had sufficient selectivity and sensitivity to investigate the disposition of these beta 2-receptor antagonists in blood and brain extracellular fluid of rats. A cellulase column was used as the first column to separate the enantiomers giving separation factors between 2.9 and 4.3. After the separation, the enantiomers were trapped on two small precolumns by the use of a switching valve and were then introduced on an achiral C18 analytical column by eluting the small columns backward. The enantiomers in blood and brain tissue dialysates were analysed by direct injection of 8 microliters samples. The limit of quantitation was 0.025-0.4 micrograms/ml of the different enantiomers. Plasma samples were analysed after a simple extraction procedure. The intraassay precision of the lowest quality control plasma samples (0.2-0.8 micrograms rac-drug/ml) was 4-8% for the different enantiomers.", 
    "51": "The positive inotropic agents, including beta-adrenergic receptor agonists and PDE III inhibitors, are reviewed to explain their mechanisms of action, pharmacology, and clinical usage. New cardiotonic drugs, such as dopexamine and dobutamine (beta-adrenergic receptor agonists) and amrinone, milrinone, and enoximone (PDE III inhibitors), have important roles for the treatment of perioperative acute heart failure or acute deterioration of congestive heart failure. PDE III inhibitors have important roles as effective inodilator agents, and understanding their actions, pharmacology, and appropriate usage is important. Nicardipine, the first dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker available for intravenous use, represents an arterial-specific vasodilator that offers an important therapeutic approach to treat perioperative hypertension.", 
    "52": "Norepinephrine is known to act as a neuromodulator in the cerebellar cortex because it can increase the effect of neurotransmitters such as GABA. This neuromodulatory effect of NE is a possible substrate for an effect of NE on cerebellar plasticity. Cerebellar plasticity can be examined by studying the learning of motor skills. A rod walking paradigm is used in our laboratory for such investigations. Learning of this rod walking task is impaired in rats that are depleted of central stores of NE and in rats that have received the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. In addition, in aged rats there is a correlation between the loss of beta-adrenergic receptor mediated neuromodulatory actions of NE in the cerebellum with a decreased ability to learn the rod walking task. Taken together this information supports a role for NE in cerebellar plasticity and suggest that the beta-adrenergic receptor is important for this plasticity.", 
    "53": "In a previous study of propranolol poisoning, glucagon and milrinone significantly increased cardiac output, but the improvement caused by glucagon was almost entirely due to the chronotropic effect. This study investigates the combined effect of glucagon, in a dose not inducing tachycardia, and milrinone on beta-blocker poisoning. Following the administration of 10 mg/kg propranolol IV over ten minutes, dogs (N = 20) were divided into four treatment groups, group S (saline), group G (glucagon 2.5 micrograms/kg), group M (milrinone 100 micrograms/kg), and group G + M (glucagon 2.5 micrograms/kg plus milrinone 100 micrograms/kg). Hemodynamic parameters were observed over the next thirty minutes. Heart rate, cardiac output, and mean arterial pressure were decreased in all groups after the administration of propranolol. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and stroke volume recovered to the baseline values in group G + M. However, heart rate in group G + M showed a significant increase versus the other three groups. In a canine model of severe propranolol poisoning, the combined effect of glucagon 2.5 micrograms/kg and milrinone 100 micrograms/kg brought about a significant hemodynamic improvement, but it was accompanied by an excessive increase of heart rate. Combined therapy of milrinone and glucagon may not be preferable therapy in beta-blocker poisoning in the canine model.", 
    "54": "A single causative mechanism for development of hypoglycemia unawareness in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is not yet apparent. Reduced adrenergic sensitivity may be part of the explanation. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of hypoglycemia on beta-adrenergic sensitivity. Ten healthy male subjects (age 19-23 years) gave informed consent to take part in the study. They were hospitalized overnight at the University Hospital of Troms\u00f8, Department of Clinical Research, on two occasions. Isoprenaline and metoprolol sensitivity tests were performed the morning after hospitalization: once after an intravenous (iv) injection of placebo (0.9% NaCl), and once after an iv injection of insulin (0.15 IU insulin/kg body weight) to induce hypoglycemia. The dose of isoprenaline needed to increase heart rate (HR) by 25 beats per minute (bpm) (I25), and the dose of metoprolol (M-12.5) needed to inhibit I25 with 50% or 12.5 bpm, when injected simultaneously, were used as determinants of isoprenaline and metoprolol sensitivity. In this study, there was a significant (p < 0.05) increase both in I25 and M-12.5 after hypoglycemia. The dose-response curve of isoprenaline/HR was significantly shifted to the right after hypoglycemia. This study shows that acute hypoglycemia induces a reduction in beta-adrenergic sensitivity, and it supports the hypothesis of reduced beta-adrenergic sensitivity as an important pathophysiological mechanism in hypoglycemia unawareness in IDDM.",

    "56": "The effects of long-term exposure (7 wk) to hyperinsulinaemia on insulin sensitivity were studied in female rats. The rats were made hyperinsulinaemic by implantation of osmotic minipumps that were changed once a week. Elevated adrenergic activity and secretion of glucocorticoids were controlled by another minipump with propranolol and adrenalectomy with corticosterone substitution, respectively. This resulted in hyperinsulinaemia and moderate hypoglycaemia, the latter probably counteracted by overeating and increased glucagon secretion, as indicated by increased body weight and lower liver glycogen contents, respectively. Euglycaemic, hyperinsulinaemic clamp measurements showed a significantly higher glucose disposal rate (P < 0.05) in the hyperinsulinaemic rats 18.8 +/- 1.1 mg kg-1 min-1 compared with the control groups 14.6 +/- 0.4 and 15.4 +/- 0.9 mg kg-1 min-1. Insulin stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose as well as glycogen synthesis was measured in the extensor digitorum longus muscle, the red and white part of the gastrocnemius, the soleus muscle, the liver and in parametrial, retroperitoneal, and inguinal adipose tissue. No differences were found between the groups in the insulin response of the 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Glycogen synthesis was significantly elevated in all muscles in the insulin treated compared with the control rats but no differences were found in the liver. Capillary density was significantly elevated per unit muscle surface area in the soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles of the insulin-exposed rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "57": "The influence of propranolol, isoprenaline, papaverine and caffeine on basal tone and contractile responses to spasmogens (oxytocin, KCl) was investigated in the presence and the absence of external calcium in estrogen-treated rat uterus. Isoprenaline, papaverine and caffeine relaxed precontracted uterus and caffeine also decreased the basal tone of uterine muscle in calcium-containing or calcium-free solution. Propranolol had a dual activity in calcium-free medium: lower concentrations contracted the sustained contraction elicited by oxytocin, whereas the highest concentration partially relaxed it. In calcium-containing solution the highest dose of propranolol partially inhibited KCl-induced contractions.", 
    "58": "The interaction of antiparasitic drugs with the polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 was studied in human liver microsomes. Of ten different drugs tested, three quinolines, oxamniquine, primaquine and chloroquine inhibited microsomal CYP2D6-catalysed formation of 1'hydroxybufuralol at concentrations that might have clinical consequences in drug use. These drugs inhibited competitively bufuralol metabolism with Ki values of 22, 23 and 15 microM, respectively, indicative of high affinity for the CYP2D6-active site. The results imply that oxamniquine, primaquine and chloroquine could be substrates of cytochrome P4502 D6 or that they are potent non-substrate inhibitors of the enzyme similar to quinidine. In either case, the inhibition of CYP2D6 by these agents could lead to interference with in vivo population-phenotyping procedures in the tropical regions where treatment with the drugs is common.", 
    "59": "We have assessed the propensity of beta-adrenoceptor blockers to cause muscle cramps and to raise the serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level in 78 patients with essential hypertension. After a control period, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA; propranolol, metoprolol or arotinolol) was administered for three months. Thereafter, the patients were randomised to receive a beta-adrenoceptor blocker with ISA (pindolol or carteolol) for three months or a beta-adrenoceptor blocker without ISA for a further three months. This pattern was continued until all beta-adrenoceptor blockers had been given. At the end of each period, CPK and CPK-MB levels were measured. Of the 78 subjects, muscle cramps occurred in 27 during treatment with pindolol and 32 during treatment with carteolol. No complaints were made by subjects treated with propranolol and arotinolol, but muscle cramps were reported in 2 treated with metoprolol. While muscle cramps were caused both by pindolol and carteolol in 16 subjects, they were caused by either of these drugs in the remainder of the subjects. Muscle cramp occurred mainly in the calves when the patients were in bed at night. Serum CPK and CPK-MB levels increased significantly during treatment with pindolol (control period vs pindolol, CPK = 96 vs 133 IU.ml-1, CPK-MB = 14 vs 18 IU.ml-1) or carteolol (CPK = 117 IU.ml-1, CPK-MB = 18 IU.ml-1) while the levels during treatment with propranolol, arotinolol and metoprolol did not change from those in the control period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "60": "Freshly isolated hepatocytes of the clawed toad, Xenopus laevis, were cultured for at least 3 days. The viability of the cells was characterized using staining and biochemical methods. In particular, the glucose and glycogen balance was tested. After culture for 16-20 hrs, the cells were subjected to hormonal treatment. Both adrenaline and arginine vasotocin stimulated the release of glucose in a dose dependent manner. 10(-6) M concentrations were strongly effective. The determination of the glycogen balance made it clear that the glucose release is mainly due to glycogenolysis. Using receptor antagonists and agonists, it has been shown that the effect of adrenaline is clearly mediated by beta-type receptors. Arginine vasotocin stimulated glycogenolysis via a type of receptor which is similar to the V2-receptor of mammals. This means that cAMP is involved in the response to both types of hormones which is in contrast to that which is known about the effect of nonapeptides on the liver of mammals.", 
    "61": "The present study investigated the effects of intrahippocampal amphetamine on memory retention and the role of hippocampal norepinephrine (NE) in memory consolidation in rats. One-way inhibitory avoidance learning paradigm was adopted. Animals were trained to avoid the foot shock. The latency to step into the shock compartment was recorded as the retention measure. The ceiling score (full retention) was 600 s. Results indicated that intra-hippocampal injections of amphetamine produced a dose-dependent enhancement of memory retention with doses at 0.6 micrograms and 1.6 micrograms reaching a significant effect. The beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol, at a dose which did not affect retention alone (80 ng), antagonized the memory-enhancing effect of amphetamine. Along with this memory-enhancing effect, amphetamine also elevated the level of NE release, and this effect was significant in animals not showing a full retention score (nonresponders) than in animals showing a full retention score (responders), as assayed by in vivo microdialysis. Within the control group, the responders also had a higher level of NE than the nonresponders. All these results are probably due to the fact that responders have a higher level of NE release than nonresponders. The effect of amphetamine on NE release is, therefore, not as obvious in responders. These results together support our hypothesis that NE plays a facilitatory role in the memory process and amphetamine enhances retention performance, at least in part, through facilitation of hippocampal NE release.", 
    "62": "Antihypertensive treatment has been shown to slow down the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with time. This has been most extensively studied in patients with diabetic nephropathy and, to some extent, with other forms of renal disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has been shown to be more effective in this regard than conventional antihypertensive therapy. This important aspect of antihypertensive treatment has not been studied previously in patients with essential hypertension. Preliminary results regarding the effects of two different antihypertensive therapies on the loss of GFR with time, determined with 51Cr-EDTA clearance after 6, 12, and 24 months of treatment, are presented here. The GFR was assessed in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial in 257 patients with essential hypertension. All had a normal renal function, and none had diabetes mellitus or glucosuria. The two therapeutic modalities were the ACE inhibitor cilazapril and the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent atenolol. Both therapies were equally effective in lowering the systolic blood pressure. However, atenolol was slightly but significantly more effective in lowering the diastolic blood pressure after 6, 12, and 24 months. The decline in GFR with time was significantly smaller with cilazapril than with atenolol. After 6 months, the reduction in GFR was 1.0 (cilazapril) vs. 4.0 (atenolol) ml/min x 1.73 m2 (p < 0.01). After 12 months the corresponding changes were 2.0 vs. 4.5 ml/min x 1.73 m2 (p < 0.05) and after 24 months 3.0 vs. 4.0 ml/min x 1.73 m2 (n.s.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Studies on the effect of antihypertensive agents on resistance arteries in hypertensive patients have in the past yielded inconclusive results regarding the ability of these drugs to induce a regression toward normal of either the structure or the function of these critically important vessels. We have recently compared the effects of the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril and of the beta blocker atenolol on the structure and the function of subcutaneous resistance arteries of essential hypertensive patients. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either cilazapril or atenolol for a period of 2 years. The blood pressure was normalized for the duration of the trial by both drugs. The media-to-lumen ratio of resistance arteries, which was significantly increased in all hypertensive patients before starting treatment, was normalized by the 2-year treatment with cilazapril, whereas treatment with atenolol did not result in any change in this vascular parameter. Treatment with cilazapril also returned to normal the contractile responses to several vasoconstrictors, particularly endothelin 1. Endothelium-dependent relaxation responses of blood vessels to acetylcholine were abnormal in hypertensive patients and improved in the cilazapril-treated patients, but remained unchanged in the atenolol-treated ones. We conclude that treatment with the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril corrects in part the vascular remodeling and the functional abnormalities of resistance arteries of hypertensive patients, whereas treatment with the beta blocker atenolol does not. These results may indicate that treatment with cilazapril and perhaps with other angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitors as well may improve the clinical outcome in hypertension by inducing a regression of abnormal resistance vessel structure and function.", 
    "64": "This study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of two different beta-blockers, metoprolol (beta 1-selective) and nipradilol (nonselective) for the treatment of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The New York Heart Association functional class improved in the metoprolol group (n = 9) and the nipradilol group (n = 9), but not in the control group who received conventional therapy (n = 8). The left ventricular ejection fraction increased in both the beta-blocker groups (p < 0.01, p < 0.05). Lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors were upregulated in the nipradilol group (p < 0.01). Cardiac events were less common in both the beta-blocker groups than in the control group (both p < 0.05). Thus, nipradilol improved symptoms and cardiac function with a favorable effect on sympathoneuronal activity as well as metoprolol in patients with DCM. Therefore, beta 1-selectivity is not essential to achieve therapeutic efficacy with beta-blockade therapy for DCM.", 
    "65": "Rats infused centrally with bombesin become hypothermic at normal ambient temperatures when acutely deprived of food, but not while allowed unrestrained access to food. Ad lib-fed rats, tested at normal ambient temperatures, become hypothermic after receiving intracerebroventricular (ICV) bombesin when they have ventromedial hypothalamic lesions or when administered insulin or 2-deoxy-D-glucose peripherally. All of these conditions have been linked to reductions of sympathetic nervous system activity to brown adipose tissue (BAT), a major thermogenic mechanism of many homeotherms. A between group design was used to examine the effects of ICV bombesin infusions on the response to peripheral injections of a) the sympathetic ganglionic blocker chlorisondamine (2.5 mg/kg, IP) in ad lib-fed rats, b) the nonspecific beta-agonist isoproterenol (30 mg/kg, IP) in food-deprived rats, and c) the combination of isoproterenol and chlorisondamine in ad lib-fed rats. Ad lib-fed rats receiving ICV bombesin (100 ng/5 microliters), in combination with peripheral chlorisondamine injection, became hypothermic 60 min postbombesin administration (-2.84 +/- 0.33 degrees C), while ad lib-fed rats receiving ICV bombesin infusion and peripheral injections of saline did not (-0.08 +/- 0.37 degrees C). Isoproterenol blocked hyperthermia in ad lib-fed rats injected with chlorisondamine and ICV bombesin. Food-derived rats receiving ICV bombesin infusion and peripheral saline injection exhibited hypothermia 60 min postbombesin administration (-2.51 +/- 0.29 degrees C). Peripheral injections of isoproterenol prevented bombesin-induced hypothermia in food-deprived rats. These data suggest that bombesin induces hypothermia at normal ambient temperatures when the sympathetic nervous system drive to BAT cannot be (or is not) activated.", 
    "66": "Two experiments were carried out in the albino rat to investigate the role of brain adrenergic systems in DNA remodeling. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were given an intraventricular microinjection of an adrenergic drug or vehicle followed 2 h later by the intraventricular injection of 50 microCi of [3H-methyl]thymidine. The rats were sacrificed 0.5 h after the injection of the radioactive tracer. The rate of DNA synthesis was determined by measuring the amount of radioactive precursor incorporated into the DNA extracted from homogenates of several brain areas. In Experiment 1, at time 0 rats received the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine (5 micrograms), the beta antagonist propranolol (10 micrograms), the alpha agonist phenylephrine (1 microgram), the beta agonist isoproterenol (12.5 micrograms), or the vehicle. The latter decreased UBDS in neocortex, and increased it in the septum, neostriatum, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and rest of the brain. The alpha and beta agonists and antagonists induced several significant effects, depending on the brain region. In Experiment 2, rats were bilaterally lesioned in the dorsal noradrenergic bundle (DNB) by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine or were sham lesioned. One week later, at time 0 they were given the alpha agonist phenylephrine (1 microgram), the beta agonist isoproterenol (12.5 micrograms), or the vehicle. The DNB-lesioned rats showed a higher UBDS in the hippocampus, neocortex, and hypothalamus, which was reversed by the alpha or the beta agonist. The results suggest an influence of the DNB, probably as a tonic inhibitor of UBDS in the hippocampus and the hypothalamus which, in turn, are likely to be mediated by beta- and alpha-adrenergic receptors. In addition, a phasic inhibitory effect seems to be mediated by beta and alpha receptors in the neocortex, and by beta receptors in the cerebellum. A modulatory role of central adrenergic systems on unscheduled brain DNA synthesis may be inferred from these findings.", 
    "67": "Possible involvement that the pressor and positive chronotropic effects of endothelin-3 (ET-3) administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) participate in the central beta-adrenoceptor has been studied in urethane anesthetized rats. ET-3 administered i.c.v. at dose of 50 pmol elicited the increase in blood pressure and heart rate over a long duration, but a dose of 30 pmol had a minimal effect. These cardiovascular responses to ET-3 were significantly reduced by intravenous pretreatment with pentolinium, ganglionic blocking agent, and phentolamine, alpha-blocker. Also pressor responses to ET-3 were abolished dose-dependently by i.c.v. pretreatment with propranolol at a dose of 1 mumol, nonselective beta-blocker and ICI 118551, beta 2-selective adrenoceptor blocker, but not by i.c.v. pretreatment with metoprolol, atenolol, beta 1-selective blocker, procaine and phentolamine. These results suggest that ET-3 may play a role in cardiovascular regulation through the activation of the sympathetic nervous system involved in the central beta 2-adrenoceptor system.", 
    "68": "The ability of dobutamine to precondition the isolated rat heart against postischemic contractile dysfunction was assessed. Hearts were perfused with varying concentrations of dobutamine for 5 min followed by a 5 min \"washout\" period and 30 min of global ischemia. The hearts were reperfused for 30 min to assess postischemic function. Dobutamine improved postischemic developed pressure, +dp/dt, heart rate x developed pressure, end diastolic pressure, and coronary flow in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentration of dobutamine showing the maximum protective effect was 10(-6)M. Propranolol administered with dobutamine significantly attenuated the protective effect. The results indicate that transient treatment with dobutamine can precondition the rat heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury. The mechanism of protection appears to involve beta-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "69": "The effect of ascorbic acid on the availability of propranolol has been examined. After oral administration of propranolol 80 mg with or without ascorbic acid pretreatment (2 g), the plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of propranolol and its metabolites, 4-hydroxy-propranolol and propranolol-conjugated, were determined by HPLC. Compared to controls, vitamin C decreased the maximum concentration of propranolol from 463 to 334 nmol.l-1, and the area under the propranolol concentration-time curve (from 0 to 24 hours) from 3.13 to 1.96 mumol.l-1.h. The time to reach maximum propranolol concentration was increased from 1.9 to 2.7. The total amount of drug recovered in urine has also significantly diminished (from 12.6 to 4.29 mg). No change in elimination rate was observed, indicating that ascorbic acid had affected both the absorption process and the first pass metabolism. The heart-rate decreased less when propranolol was administered with ascorbic acid in comparison to control subjects, although this interaction has little biological importance.", 
    "70": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the central effects of single doses of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol and the calcium antagonist nifedipine retard, alone and in combination, in normal subjects. Twelve normal males received single oral doses of atenolol 100 mg, nifedipine retard 20 mg, atenolol 100 mg and nifedipine retard 20 mg in combination, diazepam 5 mg (active control), and each of two matching placebos in a double-blind, randomised fashion. Psychomotor performance was assessed using digit symbol substitution, letter cancellation (LCT), continuous attention, choice reaction time, finger tapping, immediate recall and short-term memory. Two flash fusion and critical flicker fusion thresholds were measured and subjective assessments made using visual analogue scales (VAS). Diazepam 5 mg significantly worsened LCT scores at 4h, significantly impaired alertness at 2 h and 4 h, and tended to increase reaction time and impair continuous attention and physiological measurements. Atenolol 100 mg alone significantly reduced alertness at 2 h and 4 h, and also tended to impair physiological measurements. Nifedipine retard 20 mg produced no significant psychomotor effects. Combined atenolol and nifedipine retard administration produced a small but significant improvement in continuous attention and a reduction in body sway, with no adverse effects being evident on performance or subjective awareness. The results suggest that no significant adverse effects on psychomotor performance are produced by single doses of atenolol 100 mg and nifedipine retard 20 mg when given together in normal subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "The effects of a Finnish sauna on propranolol pharmacokinetics and on the pharmacodynamics of propranolol and captopril were studied in healthy, young volunteers (2 males, 6 females) in a double-blind, cross-over trial. The subjects received single oral doses of placebo, propranolol (40 mg) or captopril (12.5 mg) in sauna and control sessions at a one-week interval. The sauna sessions consisted of three repetitive 10-min stays in a sauna (85-100 degrees C, relative humidity 25-35%) separated by two 5-min rest periods in a cool room. Sauna bathing started 35, 50 and 65 min after ingestion of the drugs. Venous blood for plasma propranolol measurement were collected before and 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 min and 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 24 h after drug intake. The sauna significantly increased the maximum concentration (Cmax 41 vs. 28 ng.ml-1) of propranolol and the mean plasma propranolol concentration 60 and 90 min, and 2 and 3 h after drug administration. It also significantly increased the AUC0-5h (119 vs 71 micrograms.h.l-1) of propranolol from 0 to 5 hours tmax, t1/2 beta and AUC0-24h of propranolol did not differ between the control and sauna sessions. The higher propranolol levels during and after the cessation of sauna bathing did not lead to significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate compared to the control period. Captopril had no major effects on these parameters during the post-sauna phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "The effects of the beta 1-selective beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol on physiological responses, exercise capacity and gas exchange parameters were measured in healthy men using different graded bicycle exercise protocols on separate days before and following administration of 200 mg controlled-release metoprolol. Eleven men performed in randomised order maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing on 50-W/6-min stage, 50-W/3-min stage and ramp (15-W/min-1) protocols. Peak heart rate and peak heart rate-blood pressure products were similar on all exercise protocols, and were significantly reduced by metoprolol. Submaximal and peak oxygen consumption were similar before and following beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Depending on the exercise protocol applied, an insignificant decrease of 4-10% in maximal cumulated exercise capacity (work-rate x time integral) was observed following administration of metoprolol. It is concluded that in healthy men evaluated with different exercise protocols the beta 1-selective controlled-release beta-adrenoceptor blocker metoprolol does not influence exercise capacity despite a marked reduction of heart rate and rate-pressure product.", 
    "73": "Several drugs possess a chiral structure, i.e. they contain one or more stereogenic centres in their molecule. While naturally occurring active principles usually contain a single enantiomer, most chiral drugs produced by chemical synthesis are used in the form of racemic mixtures of two or more diastereoisomers. These stereoisomers (including enantiomers) may interact in different ways with biological structures and, therefore, may exhibit widely different pharmacokinetic properties. In the pharmaceutical industry, partly in response to increasing demands raised by regulatory authorities, these considerations justify the current trend to develop the single enantiomer characterized by the most favourable profile of activity (eutomer). The availability of new chemical and analytical technologies facilitates stereoselective synthetic processes and separation of individual enantiomers from racemic mixtures. Any decision to develop a drug as a single enantiomer, however, should be made only after careful evaluation of the cost-benefit ratio, i.e. when the advantages of the eutomer in terms of efficacy and tolerability outweigh the associated increase in production and development costs with respect to the racemic drug. This article takes into consideration synthetic procedures and pharmacological profiles for a number of chiral drugs in therapeutic use (naproxen, labetalol, and warfarin) or selected for clinical development, such as the beta-blocker dilevalol or the mucokinetic agent 3'-hydroxyfarrerol. These examples demonstrate that the kinetic, pharmacological and toxicological properties of individual enantiomers need to be clearly characterized before any decision can be made concerning the development of a chiral drug. The choice of preferentially developing a single enantiomer should be based on careful consideration of production and development costs and actual therapeutic advantages especially in terms of improved safety.", 
    "74": "In thiopentone-anesthetized mature pigs (n = 7), local intra-arterial infusion of the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists terbutaline and salbutamol and the beta 3-agonist BRL 37344 induced dose-dependent increases in nasal arterial blood flow (BF) and volume of the nasal mucosa (reflecting capacitance vessel function). Increases were also found in the laser Doppler flowmeter signal, reflecting superficial mucosal BF. In contrast to terbutaline and salbutamol, BRL 37344 showed marked effects on volume. Pretreatment with the beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol significantly reduced the vasodilatory effects of terbutaline and salbutamol, whereas the BF increase evoked by BRL 37344 was not affected. Exogenous noradrenaline (NA) induced in vitro dose-dependent contractions of human nasal mucosa biopsies obtained from patients with non-allergic chronic rhinitis (n = 21) or non-allergic nasal polyposis (NANP, n = 16). On a molar basis, the contractile effect of NA was significantly greater in nasal mucosa samples without histological abnormalities when compared to biopsies with abundant inflammatory cells and edema within the submucosa. In the presence of propranolol, the vasoconstrictor effect of NA was significantly enhanced in biopsies with abundant inflammatory cells obtained from patients with NANP (P < 0.01). This observation suggests the possible occurrence of a beta 2 hyper-reactivity in the nasal mucosa of patients with NANP. After precontraction in a Krebs-Ringer solution with 50 nM K+, all nasal biopsies studied showed dose-dependent relaxation to terbutaline, salbutamol and BRL 37344. This relaxant effect was markedly reduced after pretreatment with propranolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "Experimental Chagas' disease (45 to 90 days post-infection) showed serious cardiac alterations in the contractility and in the pharmacological response to beta adrenergic receptors in normal and T. cruzi infected mice (post-acute phase). Chagasic infection did not change the beta receptors density (78.591 +/- 3.125 fmol/mg protein and 73.647 +/- 2.194 fmol/mg protein for controls) but their affinity was significantly diminished (Kd = 7.299 +/- 0.426 significantly diminished (Kd = 7.299 +/- 0.426 nM and Kd = 3.759 +/- 0.212 nM for the control) p < 0.001. This results demonstrate that the alterations in pharmacological response previously reported in chagasic myocardium are related to a significantly less beta cardiac receptor affinity. During this experimental period serious cardiac cell alterations take place and functional consequences will be detected in the chronic phase.", 
    "76": "Treatment of atrial fibrillation aims to convert it to sinus rhythm and maintain this rhythm after conversion, to reduce ventricular frequency when fibrillation is not converted and to prevent systemic embolies. Conversion to sinus rhythm is achieved with electrical cardioversion or with intravenous antiarrhythmic drugs (Lanatoside C, amiodarone or beta blockers). The most useful drugs to maintain sinus rhythm are amiodarone, quinidine alone or associated to verapamil, sotalol and propafenone. The best drug used to control cardiac frequency in a rapid atrial fibrillation is digitalis. However, when there is a decrease in vagal tone and an increase in sympathetic activity, digitalis losses its effectiveness and a betablocker or a calcium blocker must be added. Electrical cardioversion is the treatment of choice for atrial fibrillation of Wolff Parkinson White syndrome. When there is a rapid, symptomatic and uncontrollable atrial fibrillation, electrical ablation of atrio-ventricular junction and the implantation of a definitive pacemaker is the treatment of choice. Lately, a new procedure has been devised, called of the labyrinth, that can re-establish sinus rhythm, atrial contraction and atrio ventricular conduction. The embolic risk of atrial fibrillation depends on its etiology and the decision to anticoagulate must balance the risks and benefits of this treatment.", 
    "77": "Specific agonists and antagonists for alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors were used to determine an alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated action of adrenaline on the rate of sterol synthesis from [14C]acetate in freshly isolated human mononuclear leukocytes. In the presence of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol (1 microM), adrenaline (100 microM) and noradrenaline (100 microM) suppressed sterol synthesis by 36% and 38%, respectively, suggesting an action via alpha-adrenoceptors. The catecholamine effect could be mimicked by alpha 2-selective beta-phenethylamines including alpha-methylnoradrenaline, but not by imidazolines. alpha 1-Selective agonists like phenylephrine and methoxamine had no effect on the pathway. Accordingly, the effects of adrenaline and the alpha 2-selective agonist alpha-methylnoradrenaline on sterol synthesis were attenuated by the unselective alpha-antagonist phentolamine and the selective alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine, but not by the alpha 1-antagonist prazosin. The results provide evidence that catecholamines can affect sterol synthesis in human mononuclear leukocytes by stimulating alpha-adrenoceptors of the alpha 2-subtype.", 
    "78": "The effect of electrical stimulation of the cervical sympathetic nerve on choroidal blood flow in the cat was investigated. Flow at various sites in 30 pentobarbital-anesthetized cats was continuously measured trans-sclerally using a laser Doppler flowmeter. Changes in either direction, increases and decreases, occurred in response to electrical stimulation of the peripheral cut end of the cervical sympathetic nerve. These changes in flow appeared to depend on the site of choroidal blood flow measurement, as decreases were seen at sites with a high baseline blood flow and increases at sites with a low baseline level. Both types of response were reduced when the cats were treated with the alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist phentolamine, but not by treatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. The decrease in choroidal blood flow elicited by cervical sympathetic nerve stimulation appears to be mediated via the vasoconstrictor fibers in that nerve. A choroidal blood flow increase may occur as a secondary effect following vasoconstriction of the arterioles elicited by cervical sympathetic nerve stimulation, producing a passive net increase in choroidal blood flow.", 
    "79": "In chloralose-anesthetized cats, rapid distension of the urinary bladder with warm (37 degrees C) normal saline (50-60 ml) causes an increase in blood pressure and contraction of the spleen. This response is due to peripheral vasoconstriction. In this experiment, the evidence of direct involvement of the spleen, as well as splenic and splanchnic sympathetic efferent activity on the viscerovascular reflexes, was investigated by pharmacological and electrophysiological (single unit preparation) means and analysis. The viscerovascular reflexes induced by urinary bladder distension remained unaffected by propranolol, but phentolamine, guanethidine sulfate, and hexamethonium completely antagonized the reflex vasopressor response. All these results with these blocking agents show that sympathetic nerves are actively involved in the reflex responses to distension of the urinary bladder with activation at the postganglionic level involving alpha-adrenoceptors and thereby the release of catecholamines. It is thus evident that the same mechanisms operate in the case of reflex elevation of blood pressure and contraction of the spleen. After bilateral denervation of the splanchnic sympathetic nerves, bladder distension failed to produce a reflex response. The efferent activity from the splanchnic and splenic sympathetic nerves in producing a reflex rise in blood pressure was recorded for direct evidence. The significant increase of asynchronous spontaneous discharge rate in the splanchnic and splenic sympathetic nerves was found along with a rise in blood pressure during bladder distension. On the basis of this study, it may be suggested that the spleen as well as splenic and splanchnic sympathetic nerves play an important role in the control of viscerovascular reflexes.", 
    "80": "Adrenoceptors are involved in the control of the activity of the autonomic nervous system and especially the sympathetic nervous system. Activation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors decreases sympathetic tone whereas their blockade has an opposite effect. However, previous investigations have shown that yohimbine (a potent alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist) increases salivary secretion through activation of cholinergic pathways. The aim of the present experiment was to investigate the involvement of both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic system in several pharmacological effects of yohimbine. For this purpose, salivary secretion and various endocrino-metabolic parameters (noradrenaline and insulin secretions, lipomobilization) were evaluated in conscious fasting dogs before and after blockade of either the sympathetic (with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist agent nadolol) or the parasympathetic (with the anticholinergic agent atropine) systems. Yohimbine alone (0.4 mg.kg-1, i.v.) increased within 5-15 minutes, plasma noradrenaline (600%), insulin levels (300%), free-fatty acids (79%) and salivary secretion (143%). Atropine (0.2 mg.kg-1, i.v.) suppressed yohimbine-induced salivary secretion (90%) but did not significantly modify the yohimbine induced changes in noradrenaline (312%), insulin (277%) and free-fatty acids (102%) plasma levels. Administration of nadolol (1 mg.kg-1, i.v.) did not change the magnitude of the increase in both noradrenaline plasma levels (550%) and salivary secretion (300%) induced by yohimbine. However, nadolol totally blunted the increase in insulin (15%) and free-fatty acids (4%) plasma levels. These results show that yohimbine-induced increase in salivary secretion is a cholinergic effect whereas the increase in insulin and free fatty acids can be explained by an increase in sympathetic tone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "81": "The proarrhythmic effects of 3-hydroxy-hydroquinidine (3-OH-HQ) and quinidine were compared in a canine model of QT-dependent ventricular arrhythmias. Eight hypokalemic ([K+] < or = 3.2 mmol/l) dogs with AV block (around 45 bpm) were given either drug in a randomized order at 2-day intervals. Each drug was given as two 1 hour doses, with a bolus (low dose: 5 mg/kg or high dose: 10 mg/kg) plus infusion (25 or 50 micrograms/kg/min) protocol. Propranolol infusion was combined with a third hour of the high dose infusion. Electrophysiologic measurements were performed at baseline and 30 minutes after the beginning of each dose and propranolol infusion, and proarrhythmic events were recorded 30 minutes before and during the experiment. Neither drugs altered the ventricular cycle length. Quinidine and 3-OH-HQ prolonged the QT interval similarly and significantly when paced at 60 bpm after the low dose (+39 +/- 18 and +28 +/- 22 msec, respectively) and after the high dose (+51 +/- 29 and +50 +/- 22 msec). Quinidine was more arrhythmogenic than 3-OH-HQ: 7/8 dogs (p < or = 0.05) developed ventricular arrhythmias (isolated, repetitive ventricular beats, or polymorphic ventricular tachycardias) during quinidine infusion (low dose: 4 dogs) compared to 3/8 dogs (NS) during 3-OH-HQ infusion (low dose: 1 dog). Addition of propranolol-induced bradycardia (around 30 bpm) caused torsades de pointes (wave burst arrhythmias) or polymorphic ventricular tachycardias after both drugs (in 3 dogs after quinidine and in 2 dogs after 3-OH-HQ). Thus 3-OH-HQ was slightly less arrhythmogenic than quinidine in this model of torsades de pointes, but the addition of an extra favouring factor (bradycardia) reduced that difference.", 
    "82": "Behind the classic beta 1 and beta 2-adrenoceptors, recent molecular and pharmacological studies have described a new receptor, called the beta 3-adrenoceptor, in various mammalian tissues (brown and white adipose tissue, digestive smooth muscle). Few authors have investigated the putative existence of the beta 3-adrenoceptor in the cardiovascular system. This paper reviews the available data. In vitro studies show that beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists (BRL 37344, CGP 12177) induce a relaxation of fragments of rat carotid artery which is not antagonized by propranolol. In dogs, these drugs elicit a decrease in blood pressure due to peripheral vasodilation and an increase in heart rate which is of baroreflex origin. The vasodilating effects are mainly observed in cutaneous and adipose tissue vessels and cannot be explained by any known transductional mechanism. Activation of this vascular beta 3-adrenoceptor requires higher doses of catecholamines than for beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptors. In humans, the cardiovascular effects of beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists are explained by the activation of beta 1- or beta 2 (and not beta 3-)-adrenoceptors. These studies suggest the presence of vascular (but not cardiac) beta 3-adrenoceptors in dogs. In other species, including man, the presence of such cardiac beta 3-adrenoceptors remains to be resolved. Their physiological relevance remains unknown.", 
    "83": "Beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) belong to the large multigenic family of receptors coupled to GTP-binding proteins. Three subtypes have been identified: beta 1-, beta 2- and beta 3-AR. Much of the work delineating the precise pharmacological comparison of the three beta-ARs has come from investigations with stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO cells). This review discusses the structure and function of beta 3-AR in various species and presents new findings on a number of beta 3-AR ligands including carazolol, tertatolol and CL 316,243 which were found to be selective and potent beta 3-AR agonists and ZD 2079 and salmeterol which appear to display full but non-subtype selective agonistic activity. Species-related variations of the beta 3-AR pharmacology have been shown for propranolol and bupranolol. With the ongoing characterization of the beta 3-AR at the molecular and cellular level, and with the advent of computer-assisted molecular modelling to aid in the determination of the three-dimensional structure of the receptor, it is thought that novel beta 3-AR compounds will become available with improved selectivity and potency.", 
    "84": "Thirty-three ocular hypertensive patients (21 with primary open angle glaucoma and 12 glaucoma suspects) were randomly assigned to receive either timolol, levobunolol or betaxolol in one eye. Pulsatile ocular blood flow (POBF) was measured before treatment (baseline) and 2 hours after drop administration. After 1 week of regular twice-daily dosage, POBF was measured again both immediately before and 2 hours after drop instillation. All measurements were made by an investigator masked to treatment. POBF increased by 11% (p = 0.09) at week 0 after levobunolol administration, and by 22% (p = 0.20) at week 1 before drop administration compared with baseline. It dropped by 23% and 25% (p = 0.04 and 0.06, respectively) before and after betaxolol administration at week 1. Although POBF was reduced in the timolol group, this change was not significant. These results can not be explained uniformly by changes in intraocular pressure or blood pressure. The relevance of these measurements to visual function in glaucoma is not known.", 
    "85": "Although the combined administration of atenolol and nifedipine has been shown to be effective in the treatment of angina pectoris the optimum dosage level of the combination has not yet been established. A double-blind, randomly assigned three period cross-over study was carried out therefore to investigate the effects of different daily doses of a fixed combination of 50 mg atenolol and 20 mg sustained-release nifedipine per capsule. Twenty-one patients with stable angina pectoris were randomized, after a 2-week run-in period, to receive treatment for 4 weeks with either 1 capsule twice daily (A), 2 capsules in the morning and 1 in the evening (B), or 2 capsules twice daily (C). A treadmill exercise tolerance test was performed together with a clinical evaluation after the run-in and each of the three treatment periods. Analysis of the results from the 19 patients who completed the study revealed there were no significant differences between the three treatment periods with respect to the general exercise test parameters, number of anginal attacks per week or nitrate consumption. Few side-effects were reported and were only mild in nature. On these findings, therefore, there would appear to be little justification for increasing the dose of the combination above the equivalent of treatment A.", 
    "86": "Substance P (SP) increased aldosterone secretion of rat adrenal slices, but not of isolated zona glomerulosa cells, and this effect was annulled by two specific antagonist of SP (SP-A). Both tissue preparations displayed an aldosterone secretory response to isoprenaline (IP) that was blocked by l-alprenolol (AL). AL reversed the aldosterone response of adrenal slices to IP, SP, or IP plus SP, whereas SP-A only suppressed that to SP. Quarters of adrenocortical autotransplants, which are completely deprived of chromaffin cells, showed an aldosterone response to IP, but not to SP. These findings suggest that the mechanism underlying the aldosterone secretagogue action of SP probably involves the stimulation of catecholamine release by adrenal medulla chromaffin cells.", 
    "87": "Previous investigations have shown that the adhesion of T. cruzi plasma membrane vesicles (PMV) to monolayers of host cell myoblasts and to immobilized heart muscle sarcolemma membranes (PAM) on polyacrylamide beads is mediated by the interaction of T. cruzi attachment sites with the muscarinic cholinergic and beta-adrenergic receptors of the host cell membrane. It has also been shown that this interaction is blunted by the specific antagonists of the mammalian receptors atropine and propranol, respectively. In the studies reported here, PAM also rapidly attached to swimming T. cruzi trypomastigotes in a complex, concentration-dependent fashion and binding isotherms showed that the equilibrium between free and bound PAM is rapidly reached within 2 minutes of incubation in physiologically balanced salt solutions. In this time frame, trypomastigote cAMP levels are significantly reduced from steady state values within 30 seconds of the addition of PAM in a buffer system containing a diesterase inhibitor. Maximal attenuation of cAMP levels was measured between 1 and 2 minutes of the addition of PAM to T. cruzi trypomastigotes. The degree of cAMP level attenuation was reduced by blocking PAM attachment with either atropine or propranol. On the basis of these results we propose that a likely pathway for the negative parasite signal generated upon adhesion of host muscle cell membranes to the surface of the flagellates is from the parasite's surface attachment sites directly to a Pertussis toxin sensitive inhibitory protein Gi, thereby blunting adenyl cyclase activity and cAMP formation.", 
    "88": "1. The effects of catecholestrogens 2-hydroxyestradiol (2-OH E2, 0.6-30 microM), 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-OH E2, 1-30 microM) and 2-methoxyestradiol (2-MeO E2, 0.6-30 microM) on rat uterine contraction induced by KCl (60 mM), have been assayed. 2. All drugs assayed relaxed the tonic-contraction induced by KCl in a concentration-dependent way. The EC50s were: 4.4 +/- 0.5, 4.2 +/- 0.3 and 8.5 +/- 0.7 microM for 2-MeO E2, 2-OH E2 and 4-OH E2, respectively. This relaxing effect was counteracted by CaCl2 (1-10 mM) but not by the calcium channel agonist Bay k 8644 (1 nM-1 microM). 3. The effect of 2-MeO E2 is not modified by propranolol (1 microM), cycloheximide (35 microM), actinomycin D (4 microM), alpha-difluoromethyl-ornithine (10 mM) or genistein (10 microM). Nor did cycloheximide (35 microM) or actinomycin D (4 microM) modify the relaxing effect of 2-OH E2 and 4-OH E2. Propranolol (1 microM) significantly increased the effect of 4-OH E2 but not the effect of 2-OH E2. 4. Our results suggest that the relaxing effect of catecholestrogens in the rat uterus is a non-genomic effect and could be related to inhibition of extracellular calcium entry.", 
    "89": "1. In rat parotid acini, amiloride inhibited the secretion of amylase and the efflux of calcium and rubidium in response to carbamylcholine and to norepinephrine. 2. Amiloride competitively inhibited the binding of [3H]N-methylscopolamine and [3H] is thus a competitive antagonist of muscarinic and norepinephrine alpha-adrenergic receptors. 3. Amiloride did not affect the response to substance P with respect to secretion or ion movements. 4. Thus the Na+/H+ antiporter is not involved in the short-term regulation of amylase secretion and calcium and potassium movements in rat parotid gland function.", 
    "90": "Prostanoid receptors regulating the contractility of strips of myometrium obtained from nonpregnant ewes during the breeding season were classified pharmacologically. Natural prostanoids, receptor-type selective synthetic analogues, and selective antagonists were used where available. The natural prostanoids PGD2, PGE2, and PGF2 alpha were equipotent in causing contractions (pD2 values of 6.9, 6.7, and 6.9, respectively) but were 100 times less potent than oxytocin (pD2 = 9.2). The synthetic prostanoids iloprost (pD2 = 8.3), GR63799x (pD2 = 7.0), cloprostenol (pD2 = 6.8), and U46619 (pD2 = 6.2) also caused contractions. The effects of iloprost, but not of GR63799x, were blocked by the selective EP1 antagonist AH 6809. This suggests the presence of both EP1 and EP3 receptors. The similar potencies of cloprostenol and PGF2 alpha suggest the presence of FP receptors. Although the potency of the TP agonist U46619 was relatively low, its effects were blocked by the selective TP antagonist L 670596 (pKB = 8.4), an observation consistent with the presence of TP receptors. Thus, all currently recognized excitatory prostanoid receptors (EP1, EP3, FP and TP) appeared to be present. Contractions induced by cloprostenol and KCl could be inhibited by the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline (pD2 = 8.8 against cloprostenol) and the Ca(2+)-channel blocker, D600 (pD2 = 6.3 against cloprostenol), but a number of relaxant prostanoids, BW245c, ZK110841, AH13205 and cicaprost, could not produce inhibition. These results suggest that DP, EP2 and IP receptors do not regulate contractility under these conditions.", 
    "91": "The effect of the nitric oxide (NO) donor SIN-1 (3-morpholino-sydnonimine) on the calcium current (ICa) was examined in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. SIN-1 had little effect on basal ICa. After moderate stimulation of ICa with 10 nM isoproterenol (ISO), 10 microM SIN-1 caused either stimulation or inhibition of ICa; 100 microM SIN-1 consistently caused inhibition. SIN-1 (1-100 microM) inhibited ICa equally following considerable enhancement of ICa by either 1 microM ISO or 100 microM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a nonspecific phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor. SIN-1 (100 microM) also inhibited ICa equally following enhancement by either 10 microM pipette adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) or hydrolysis-resistant 8-bromo-cAMP. Thus the inhibitory effect of SIN-1 appears independent of PDEs. Addition of LY-83583 (a blocker of guanylate cyclase) to the pipette or superfusion with KT-5823 [a blocker of the guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase] suppressed the inhibitory effect of SIN-1. We conclude that NO is an important modulator of beta-adrenergic effects on ICa and that the mechanism of NO inhibition of ICa in mammalian cardiac cells involves the cGMP-dependent protein kinase.", 
    "92": "Experiments were designed to determine how isoproterenol affects the cell membrane potential of smooth muscle cells of the canine saphenous vein. Measurements of membrane potential were performed using glass microelectrodes. Isoproterenol (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) caused sustained, concentration-dependent membrane hyperpolarizations in tissues with and without endothelium. ICI 118,551 (a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist), but not atenolol (a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist), abolished the hyperpolarization to isoproterenol. Forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, produced sustained hyperpolarizations, which were not mimicked by 1,9-dideoxyforskolin. Incubation with either ouabain or extracellular K(+)-free solution did not inhibit the electrical response to isoproterenol. Glibenclamide (a selective ATP-sensitive K+ channel antagonist) attenuated the hyperpolarizations induced by either isoproterenol or forskolin, whereas charybdotoxin (an inhibitor of large conductance Ca(++)-activated K+ channels) did not. These findings suggest that isoproterenol opens ATP-sensitive K+ channels indirectly through activation of adenylate cyclase in the smooth muscle of the canine saphenous vein. The adrenergic receptor involved belongs to the beta 2-adrenoceptor subtype.", 
    "93": "Carvedilol, Doxazosin and Moxonidine are rather novel antihypertensive substances, which belong to \"beta-adrenoceptor-antagonists\", \"alpha 1-adrenoceptor-antagonists\" and \"antisympathotonic substances\" respectively. Besides its nonselective beta-adrenoceptor-antagonistic activity, Carvedilol possesses smooth vascular relaxant and alpha 1-antagonistic effects. Since beta-adrenoceptor-antagonists are, together with diuretics, the only antihypertensives for which a decrease in mortality rate has been verified, Carvedilol by its site of action also belongs to that antihypertensive family. Many investigations have shown that the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-antagonist Doxazosin is as effective in blood pressure lowering as other antihypertensive substances and has only a few side effects. With respect to the hypotensive action, the antisympathotonic substance Moxonidine is as effective as Clonidine is, but side effects occur 50% less in comparison to Clonidine. The 3 substances enlarge the antihypertensive therapy. However, mortality studies are required to test their comparability to the other first line antihypertensive substances.", 
    "94": "Using high-resolution duplex scanning it is possible to evaluate the blood flow velocity in the central retinal artery of the eye. Four different patient groups were studied with this technique: normals, diabetics with a decreased flow, diabetics with an increased flow and vascular patients with a decreased flow. The eyes of these patients were then treated with topical timolol and the flow measured again. An increase in the flow was found in three of the four groups. This increased flow velocity may be due to a vasodilatory effect of timolol. The results are presented and discussed.", 
    "95": "A multicenter, controlled, open, randomized trial of antihypertensive and life quality (LQ) effects of monotherapy with captopril vs propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide and nifedipine included 345 males aged 35-60 years with mild and moderate hypertension. The results of 8-month treatment provided the conclusions: the drugs were much alike by antihypertensive efficacy, LQ parameters proved more beneficial in the group on captopril than those on nifedipine and propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide failed to improve life quality, captopril is an effective and safe antihypertensive drug superior to the drugs of 3 other antihypertensive drug groups by positively affecting LQ.", 
    "96": "This paper is the written version of the conference that under the same title was presented in the XXX Congreso Nacional de la Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Cardiolog\u00eda. In the paper, the use of the most recent antihypertensive drugs is advocated as first line therapy. The defence is based in cardiac and non cardiac considerations. Among the former, there are certain advantages of the new drugs in areas as regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and improvement of coronary flow and coronary reserve. Among the non cardiac considerations there are some metabolic factors (non adverse effect on the lipid profile), as well as a positive effect on some endocrine-metabolic cascades like the insulin-resistance syndrome and a very important role in certain special situations as coexistence with other diseases and individual characteristics of the patient (pregnancy or elderly for example).", 
    "97": "Diuretics have increasingly come to be used for the treatment of arterial hypertension over the last few decades. Although their precise active mechanism is unknown, it is supposed that their usefulness as antihypertensive is a product mainly of their effect on the transport of ions across the cell wall, which reduces peripheral vascular resistance. The adverse metabolic effects of diuretics can be minimized by prescribing the lowest doses presently recommended, or by administering potassium salts or a potassium-retain diuretic. The antihypertensive action of beta blockers is similar to that of diuretics and other antihypertensive drugs, and again, their active mechanism is poorly understood. There are several contraindications for prescribing beta blockers, as well as side effects that must be considered before starting treatment. Well-controlled studies on large cohorts have demonstrated the usefulness of both diuretics and beta blockers in preventing the cardiovascular complications of hypertension. These studies have also allowed the medical profession to designate indications for using these drugs in various segments of the population defined by factors of age and race. Given the proved therapeutic efficacy of diuretics and beta blockers, as well as economic considerations, these drugs should be considered first-choice options for the arterial hypertension."
