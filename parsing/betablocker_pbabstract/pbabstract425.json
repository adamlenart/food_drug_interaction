    "0": "The present study investigated the effects of celiprolol a novel beta 1-antagonist with partial beta 2-agonist activity on the human failing heart. Experiments were performed on isolated electrically driven atrial and ventricular cardiac preparations and in membrane preparations from the left ventricles of nine patients (four with dilated cardiomyopathy; five with ischemic cardiomyopathy) undergoing cardiac transplantation for terminal heart failure. Celiprolol produced a negative inotropic effect in atrial and ventricular heart muscle. However, in the presence of forskolin--which activates the catalyst of the adenylate cyclase-or the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor milrinone, celiprolol produced concentration-dependent positive inotropic effects and positive lusitropic effects. Experiments with the beta 1-and beta 2-selective antagonists CGP 207.12A and ICI 118.551, respectively, suggest that the positive inotropic response is mediated by beta 2-adrenoceptors. In radioligand binding experiments, a selectivity of 15.7 [-Gpp(NH)p] or 23.9 [+Gpp(NH)p] as judged from the Ki values--of binding to beta 2-adrenoceptors was measured in the failing human ventricular myocardium. Competition curves with celiprolol alone and in the presence of the guanine nucleotide Gpp(NH)p revealed no evidence for agonist activity at beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptors. It is concluded that amplification of the cAMP response is able to unmask partial agonist activity of celiprolol in the failing human heart at beta 2-adrenoceptors. The inotropic measurements are a more sensitive approach than radioligand binding studies. Whether the pharmacological profile of celiprolol will be useful in conditions like heart failure is questionable with respect to the potential downregulation of beta 2-adrenoceptors by its partial agonist activity.", 
    "1": "The electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of H 234/09 (Almokalant), a novel class II antiarrhythmic agent, were studied in the anesthetized dog. H 234/09 (1.0 mumol/kg i.v.) significantly prolonged the atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods, the ventricular monophasic action potential duration, and the paced QT interval. At this dose, atrial, ventricular, and atrioventricular conduction was not affected, aortic blood pressure was not changed, and contractile force was transiently increased. The effects on cardiac repolarization and refractoriness induced by H 234/09 were both larger and more long lasting than the effects observed after quinidine (11.8 mumol/kg) and (+)-sotalol (9.7 mumol/kg). However, both quinidine and (+)-sotalol significantly reduced the aortic blood pressure and (+)-sotalol also decreased cardiac contractility. The effect of H 234/09 on atrial refractoriness was very little influenced by the paced heart rate and was twice as large as the corresponding effect in the ventricle. In conclusion, H 234/09 has electrophysiological properties suggestive of a class III antiarrhythmic. H 234/09 may have a favorable therapeutic profile compared to both quinidine and (+)-sotalol, especially for the treatment of atrial arrhythmias.", 
    "2": "We analyzed the reproducibility and sensitivity of noninvasive estimates of cardiovascular performance (impedance cardiography and systolic time intervals) to detect and describe the inodilatory responses to isoprenaline (ISO) and their attenuation by transdermally applied mepindolol. The responses to 5-min intravenous (i.v.) infusions of 1 microgram/min ISO in 9 young male healthy volunteers were evaluated repeatedly before and at the end of chronic treatments with daily applied TSD skin patches for transdermal drug delivery with either mepindolol or placebo (double-blind randomized cross-over design). ISO caused a clear increase in mean heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), maximum velocity of impedance changes, estimated stroke volume (SV), and the Heather index, and a reduction in diastolic BP (DBP), estimated systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and a shortening of all systolic time intervals (STIs). These responses were effectively blunted at the end of 1-week treatment with mepindolol TSD patches. Despite overall good agreement of the mean baseline data (under placebo), their within-subject reproducibility nevertheless was too weak to guarantee adequate power to detect small changes under active treatment. Reproducibility of the ISO responses was quite poor, although in a method-independent way. The methods used allowed us to describe the cardiac and vascular components of the ISO responses with adequate detail. Transdermally delivered mepindolol was shown to block ISO responses effectively, but the overall variability of the responses was too large to detect slight changes in them, although the methods in themselves did not appear to be the main cause of this lack of sensitivity.", 
    "3": "The properties of the low threshold Ca current (ICaT) in bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) isolated atrial cardiomyocytes were studied using the whole-cell recording patch-clamp technique and compared with those of the high threshold Ca current (ICaL). In 91% of atrial cells we observed both ICaT and ICaL when collagenase and trypsin were used to dissociate the cells. But when pronase was used, only 30% of the cells exhibited ICaT. ICaT was never found in ventricular cells. ICaT could be investigated more easily when ICaL was inhibited by Cd ions (50 microM). Its kinetics were unchanged by substituting Ba for Ca, or in the presence of high concentrations of Ba. Both ICaT and ICaL exhibited reduced inactivation after high depolarizing prepulses. ICaT was found to be sensitive to dihydropyridines: 1 microM nifedipine decreased this current while 1 microM BAY K 8644 increased it; this occurred without significant variations in the steady-state inactivation curve. ICaT was more sensitive than ICaL to alpha 1-adrenergic and P2-purinergic stimulations, while ICaL was more sensitive to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Isoproterenol was still able to increase ICaT in the presence of high intracellular cAMP. Both currents were increased by 1 microM ouabain (although ICaL only transiently) and decreased by 10 microM ouabain. It is concluded that the two types of Ca channels can be observed in bullfrog atrial cells and that they are specifically altered by pharmacological agents and neuromediators. This may have implications for cardiac behavior.", 
    "4": "In choosing the optimum antihypertensive agent for an individual patient, various factors should be considered. Demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race) and the circadian pattern of blood pressure elevation may influence the response to therapy. Concomitant therapy for coexisting medical disorders must be evaluated for possible drug interactions. Calcium channel blockers, which can be used in any age group, may be particularly useful in hypertensive patients with certain concurrent conditions (e.g., coronary artery disease, migraine, or gastrointestinal motility disorders). Life-style, including occupation and leisure-time activities, may contraindicate the use of certain drugs in a particular patient. It also may be necessary to consider the economic status of the patient, particularly in the elderly, who often have limited disposable income. Since to a great extent successful therapeutic management of hypertension depends on patient compliance, reduced frequency of dosing (i.e., once or twice daily) is desirable. The clustering of morbid events in the hours immediately following awakening highlights the need for therapy that provides 24-hour control, thereby ensuring adequate pharmacodynamic effects during that crucial period. The challenge is to select the most appropriate first-line agent (diuretic, beta blocker, calcium channel blocker, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) for a particular patient.", 
    "5": "beta 2-Adrenoceptor agonists possess antidepressant-like activity in animals and man, but their peripheral side-effects prevent their therapeutic use. Atypical beta-adrenoceptors have not been demonstrated in the central nervous system, but are known to exist in peripheral tissues such as the rat colon. We have now studied the antidepressant-like effects in rodents of a new selective atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonist, SR 58611A. SR 58611A was active with minimal effective doses of 0.1-0.3 mg kg-1 i.p. in several models (antagonism of the hypothermia induced by apomorphine and reserpine; potentiation of the toxicity produced by yohimbine; reversal of learned helplessness), but was inactive in the tests of reserpine-induced ptosis and behavioural despair. The antidepressant-like effect of SR 58611A was not antagonised by selective beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists, but was blocked by high doses of the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, propranolol and alprenolol. Unlike beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists, SR 58611A did not reduce locomotor activity or increase water intake at doses up to 10 mg kg-1. Therefore, SR 58611A may represent the prototype of a new class of antidepressant compounds.", 
    "6": "The influence of osmotic stimulation on the density of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites in the rat supraoptic nucleus (SON) was studied by quantitative autoradiography using 125I-cyanopindolol (ICYP). Increased density of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites was observed in osmotically stimulated rats and also after the suppression of neuronal activation by rehydration of animals. This was mainly due to a significant increase in the concentration of beta 2 binding sites. The overexpression of beta-adrenoceptors occurred concomitantly with nuclear expansion in SON astrocytes. Moreover, the higher concentration of beta-adrenoceptors observed in the ventral portion of the SON largely coincided with the area that showed intense GFAP-immunostaining. These results provide indirect evidence of an astrocytic location of beta-adrenoceptors and also of beta-adrenergic mediation in the structural and functional changes of SON astrocytes.", 
    "7": "The effects of flecainide on electrophysiologic parameters and arrhythmias in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome were reviewed. Acute administration of flecainide blocks conduction across the accessory pathway in the anterograde direction in 40% and in the retrograde direction in 50% of cases and markedly prolongs refractoriness in the remaining cases. Flecainide has a lesser effect on refractoriness of the His-Purkinje system, atrium, ventricle, and atrioventricular node. Flecainide terminates atrioventricular tachycardia in greater than 80% of cases when given intravenously, and oral therapy prevents clinical recurrences in greater than 60% of cases, but may occasionally result in incessant tachycardia. Long-term efficacy is predicted by abolition of conduction across the accessory pathway or prevention of tachycardia induction at acute electrophysiologic testing. Concomitant administration of a beta-adrenoreceptor blocker results in greater long-term efficacy. Administered during preexcited atrial fibrillation, flecainide consistently slows the ventricular response and converts the majority of cases to sinus rhythm. Serious ventricular proarrhythmia is seen almost exclusively in patients with structural cardiac disease. Flecainide is a useful drug for the acute and chronic control of tachycardia in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.", 
    "8": "We investigated the effect of sex hormones on the sex-dependent response of rat kidney ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity to cadmium (Cd) administration and the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in mediating stimulation of the liver enzyme by the metal. The response of renal ODC to Cd, which occurs in intact adult males but not in females, is also detectable in prepubertal and castrated males. Upon treatment with 17 beta-estradiol, the basal levels of enzyme activity in intact or castrated adult males were enhanced and Cd administration failed to increase them further. In adult females the kidney enzyme became responsive after ovariectomy. Also, in prepubertal females renal ODC was induced by Cd, and this was prevented by treatment with 17 beta-estradiol. Under the same conditions, changes in the levels of Cd accumulation within the kidney, that might account for variations in the response of ODC activity, did not occur. Cd caused an increase in renin activity starting minutes after its injection. Captopril, which specifically inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, prevented completely the induction of liver ODC by this metal; stimulation of the enzyme by Co was not affected by the drug. A similar inhibitory effect was exerted by propranolol. Adrenalectomy had no influence on the response of hepatic ODC to Cd; the decarboxylase was unaffected by aldosterone administration. It is suggested that Cd may induce liver ODC through the increase in angiotensin II following stimulation of renin by the metal.", 
    "9": "A 1.57kb BamH1 fragment containing a full-length human debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase cytochrome P450 (CYP2D6) cDNA was inserted into the BglII site of the yeast expression plasmid pMA91 and the resulting recombinant plasmid, PELT1, introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH22. Microsomes prepared from AH22/pELT1 cells gave an absorption maximum at 448 nm and a P450 content of 67 +/- 31 pmol/mg of microsomal protein. No P450 was detectable in microsomes prepared from AH22/pMA91 control cells. A western blot of microsomes prepared from yeast transformed with pELT1 were probed with a monoclonal antibody to CYP2D6 and revealed a strong band with a molecular mass consistent with that of CYP2D6 from human liver microsomes. No corresponding band was observed with microsomes from control yeast transformed with pMA91 alone. Microsomes from AH22/pELT cells showed catalytic activity towards metoprolol (alpha-hydroxylation and O-demethylation, 0.17 and 0.78 nmol/mg protein/h, respectively); and towards sparteine (2- and 5-dehydrogenation, 1.82 and 0.59 nmol/mg protein/h, respectively). The inhibition of metoprolol metabolism by quinidine (Qd) was 200 times more potent than that of quinine (Qn), both for alpha-hydroxylation (Qd IC50 = 0.05 microM; Qn IC50 = 4 microM) and O-demethylation (Qd IC50 = 0.05 microM; Qn IC50 = 4 microM). Negligible metabolism of tolbutamide and S-mephenytoin, substrates of the 2C sub-family, and of p-nitrophenol, a substrate of CYP2E1, was detected, although a trace of the N-deethylated metabolite of lignocaine, thought to be metabolised by CYP3A4, was detected with microsomes from CYP2D6-expressing yeast cells. The results indicate that yeast cells containing human CYP2D6 cDNA express a functionally active form of the enzyme, the immunochemical and catalytic properties of which are consistent with those of human liver.", 
    "10": "[3H]Dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) specific binding (determined by the difference in the presence and absence of 20 microM (-)isoprenaline) to rat colon membranes was saturable (Bmax = 39.6 fmol/mg protein), of high affinity (Kd = 0.87 nM) and stereospecific (IC50 330 and 3510 nM for (-)- and (+)isoprenaline, respectively); the Hill coefficient was close to one, indicating binding homogeneity. [3H]DHA (0.6 nM) specific binding was potently inhibited (Ki range 1.9-3.3 nM) by the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists pindolol, alprenolol, but not by the non-adrenergic compounds 5-hydroxytryptamine, 8-hydroxydipropylaminotetraline, methysergide, dopamine and verapamil (Ki greater than 10,000 nM). The selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists CGP 20,712A and ICI 118,551 resulted in biphasic competition binding curves, whose low and high affinity components were compatible with two populations of binding sites accounting for about 75 (beta 2) and 25% (beta 1) of total sites. The relative competing potencies of reference adrenergic agonists also suggested a prevalence of beta 2-adrenergic sites. The new agonists phenylethanolaminotetralines (PEATs), highly selective for the atypical beta-adrenoceptors whose abundance in rat colon has been confirmed by comprehensive functional studies, had variable affinity for the [3H]DHA-labelled sites depending on chirality, but with no substantial correlation with their pharmacological potency. Only 40% of [3H]DHA binding, at a concentration about 10 times its Kd for high affinity sites (beta 1 and beta 2), was prevented by saturating concentrations of isoprenaline. Under this condition, the representative PEAT, SR 58611A, highly potent and selective for atypical beta-adrenoceptors in functional tests, and its pharmacologically inactive enantiomer, both inhibited the residual binding equipotently. In conclusion, [3H]DHA binding did not detect atypical beta-adrenoceptor sites in rat colon membranes, most probably because of its weaker affinity for them than for the coexisting beta 1 and beta 2 sites. PEAT stereoisomers proved essential for assessing both the stereospecificity and the functional significance of this atypical binding and to compare their affinity for [3H]DHA-labelled sites and pharmacological potency.", 
    "11": "The ligand binding of beta-adrenergic receptors was characterized in the omental, subcutaneous and popliteal adipose tissue depots in the sheep, and the lumbar and parametrial depots in the rat. Displacement of [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP) binding to sheep adipose tissue membranes by the beta-adrenergic antagonists CGP 20712A and ICI 118,551 (beta 1- and beta 2-antagonists, respectively) suggested only a single ligand binding site predominantly beta 2 in character in all three depots, but revealed differences in affinity for these ligands between depots. Lactation increased beta-receptor ligand binding in subcutaneous and omental but not popliteal sheep adipose tissue depots, but had no effect on beta-adrenergic receptor affinities for CGP 20712A and ICI 118,551 in the three sheep adipose tissue depots studied. In rat adipocyte membranes, displacement of [125I]ICYP by CGP 20712A and ICI 118,551 was biphasic, indicating high and low affinity sites; displacement profiles differed markedly between lumbar and parametrial depots, the former having a preponderance of beta 1-like receptors and the latter a preponderance of beta 2-like receptors. The properties of the beta-adrenergic receptor binding site thus show species and depot specific differences.", 
    "12": "Possible modulatory actions of endogenous neurotransmitters on long-term potentiation (LTP) were investigated in the fimbria-CA3 pathway of rat hippocampal slices. Bath application of atropine (10 microM), but neither timolol (10 microM) nor D,L-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionate (AP3, 100 microM), significantly attenuated LTP induced by 20 pulses of 50 Hz stimulation. When stronger stimulation (3 trains of 100 Hz, 100 pulses) was used for the induction of LTP, timolol significantly attenuated LTP, but atropine and AP3 did not. These results suggest that, under specified conditions, endogenous acetylcholine through muscarinic receptors, and noradrenaline through beta-adrenergic receptors may modulate the generation of LTP in the fimbria-CA3 pathway. Metabotropic glutamate receptors may be involved not in the generation of LTP but in low-frequency synaptic transmission, since 300-1,000 microM AP3 greatly reduced, or abolished synaptic transmission in this pathway.", 
    "13": "Application of 1 microM N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) either immediately before or following tetanic stimulation inhibits the induction of CA1 hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). We have examined the effect of trans-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (ACPD), norepinephrine and acetylcholine on this NMDA-mediated LTP inhibition using extracellular recordings from in vitro rat hippocampal slices. When NMDA is accompanied by 100 microM ACPD or 10 microM norepinephrine, the block of LTP is overcome. The norepinephrine effect is mimicked by phenylephrine and methoxamine and is blocked by phentolamine and prazosin suggesting the involvement of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "14": "Three subtypes of alpha 2 adrenergic receptors have been identified in the human and rat. The subtype located on human chromosome 2 (alpha 2-C2) is unique in that it is expressed mainly in the peripheral tissues and lacks sites for N-linked glycosylation. We isolated the gene encoding the mouse homolog of the human alpha 2-C2 adrenergic receptor (M alpha 2-2H). The deduced amino acid sequence of the M alpha 2-2H shows 82% and 96% identity to the human alpha 2-C2 and the rat RNG alpha 2 adrenergic receptors, respectively. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the M alpha 2-2H was encoded by a single copy gene and was distinct from the mouse homologs of the alpha 2-C4 and alpha 2-C10 adrenergic receptors. When expressed in COS-7 cells, the M alpha 2-2H exhibited a pharmacological profile similar to the human alpha 2-C2 and rat RNG alpha 2 receptors.", 
    "15": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a potent activator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The hypothalamus seems to be the most important site of action of IL-1 on the HPA axis, inducing corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) secretion. Catecholamines are important modulators of CRF secretion. In turn, IL-1 stimulates catecholamine release from the hypothalamus. In the present study, we examined the possible involvement of hypothalamic catecholamines in the effect of IL-1 beta on hypothalamic CRF secretion, by using an in vitro rat hypothalami continuous perifusion system. Neither in vivo pretreatment with an inhibitor of catecholamine synthesis nor in vitro exposure to alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (phenoxybenzamine or propranolol, respectively) nor combination of both treatments altered the effect of IL-1 on CRF secretion from superfused hypothalami. These data indicate that catecholamines are not involved in the in vitro stimulatory action of IL-1 on hypothalamic CRF secretion.", 
    "16": "We investigated the beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated effects of atrial and ventricular effective refractory period (ERP), SA node pacemaker activity, and AV conductivity induced by sympathetic nerve stimulation or epinephrine infusion in anesthetized dogs. A beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551 up to 100 micrograms/kg, i.v., inhibited the positive chronotropic and dromotropic responses to sympathetic stimulation but did not shorten the atrial or ventricular ERP, ICI 118,551 also attenuated the positive chronotropic and dromotropic responses and the shortening of atrial ERP in response to epinephrine but not the shortening of ventricular ERP. A selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol, inhibited each electrical cardiac response to sympathetic stimulation and epinephrine infusion in a similar manner. These results suggest that beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated electrical cardiac responses to endogenous catecholamines also exist in addition to the predominant beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated responses, and that the order of the proportion of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated cardiac effects was SA node pacemaker activity much greater than AV conductivity = atrial ERP much greater than ventricular ERP in the dog heart.", 
    "17": "A review over adrenergic transmembrane signalling in human heart muscle cells, changes in this signalling in patients with heart failure and the influence of medical treatment of heart failure, is presented. In heart failure, the myocardial contractibility is decreased, although the plasma level of catecholamines is elevated. This can be due to changes in the transmembrane signalling. In heart failure, the numbers of beta-receptors are decreased, the amount of Gs-protein is probably unchanged and the amount of Gi-protein is probably increased. Changes in signalling are described in more detail in patients with heart failure based on idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), where a selective down regulation of beta 1-receptors is seen. In heart failure of other origin, there is probably a concomitant reduction in beta 1- and beta 2-receptors. The selective regulation in patients with DCM, can be based on autoantibodies. A 30% reduction in maximal response on selective beta 2 stimulation is additionally seen in patients with DCM, probably based on an increase in the amount of Gi-protein. beta-antagonists increase and beta-agonists decrease the numbers of beta-receptors. The regulation is selective when selective antagonists and agonists are used, and nonselective when nonselective drugs are used. How other drugs affect the transmembrane signalling is still to be elucidated.", 
    "18": "The antihypertensive agent labetalol is a mixture of two racemates. We report reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) methodology for the separation of the four stereoisomers of labetalol via derivatization with the chiral reagent (4S-cis)-2,2-dimethyl-5-isothiocyanato-4-phenyl-1,3-dioxane. The derivatives were separated on octadecylsilane columns with a methanol-ammonium phosphate buffer mixture as mobile phase. Separations of the diastereomeric forms of labetalol were achieved with the non-chiral derivatizing reagents benzyl isothiocyanate and 1-naphthalenemethyl isothiocyanate. In all cases the derivatives of the R,S/S,R forms eluted before those of the R,R/S,S forms. Isothiocyanates may have general utility in stereoisomer separations of amines by HPLC.", 
    "19": "The effect on food intake of adrenergic agonists administered into the third cerebral ventricle was studied in Zucker fatty and lean rats. The alpha 2 agonist, clonidine, produced a larger dose-related increase in food intake in lean rats than in the fatty rats. Dose-response curves show similar sensitivity, but decreased responsiveness in the lean animal. The beta 2 adrenergic agonist, salbutamol, produced similar food effect in obese and lean rats reducing food intake in the lean rats at the highest dose (300 nmol), and in the fatty rats at the two highest doses. The effects were small in both groups. The beta 3 agonist, BRL 37344, ([4-(2-((2-hydroxy-2-(3-chlorophenyl)ethyl)amino)-propyl)-phenoxy acetate]) produced a larger dose-related decrease in food intake in the fatty rat than in the lean rats. Dose-response curves showed that sensitivity of beta-receptors was similar, but the lean animals were less responsive. The beta-adrenergic blocking drug propranolol blocked the anorectic effect of BRL 37344 in the fatty rat. These studies suggest that in the fatty rat, the alpha 2 receptor system is tonically more active and the beta 3 receptor system tonically less active, a relationship that would explain the hyperphagia and development of obesity in these animals.", 
    "20": "Modulation of beta 3-adrenergic receptor (beta 3AR) expression by dexamethasone was investigated in the murine 3T3-F442A adipocytic cell line. In untreated cells, a major population of binding sites (62,000-114,000 sites/cell) of low affinity for (-)-[3H] CGP12177 and (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol (corresponding to the beta 3AR subtype) was present along with a minor population (6,500-8,000 sites/cell) of sites of high affinity for the radioligands (corresponding to a mixture of the beta 1 and beta 2AR subtypes). Long-term exposure of the cells to 250 nM dexamethasone led to a sharp decrease in beta 3AR density (less than 5,000 sites/cell) which paralleled a diminished potency of the beta 3AR-selective agonists BRL37344 and CGP12177 to stimulate the production of intracellular cAMP. Analysis of RNA by polymerase chain reaction and nuclear run-on assays indicated that dexamethasone inhibited the synthesis of beta 3AR mRNA, resulting in 4-8-fold decrease in the steady-state levels of this mRNA. The down-regulation of beta 3AR protein and cellular mRNA appeared to be mediated by the receptor for glucocorticoids as assessed by the antagonistic action of the anti-glucocorticoid RU38486.", 
    "21": "To determine the contribution of interleukin 1 (IL-1) on ischemic brain edema formation, the effect of recombinant human interleukin 1 beta (rhIL-1 beta), or zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) as an IL-1 blocker, on brain edema was studied in rats. The animals were subjected to 60 min of ischemia in a middle cerebral artery occlusion model. Immediately after reperfusion, rhIL-1 beta at a dose of 10 ng/2 microliters, or ZnPP at doses of 1 and 10 micrograms/2 microliters were topically applied into lateral cerebroventricle. In rhIL-1 beta-treated rats, ischemic brain edema formation was significantly increased in the dorsal and ventral areas of the caudate putamen 24 h after reperfusion, compared to that of vehicle-treated control rats. Furthermore, in ZnPP-treated rats, brain edema was decreased in both caudate-putamen areas. This suggests that IL-1 plays an important role in pathogenesis for post-ischemic brain edema.", 
    "22": "Acute administration of corticoids is a potent stimulus of GH secretion in man. To ascertain their mechanism and point of action as well as the suitability of this novel test in the diagnosis of GH-deficient states, normal controls and GH-deficient children were studied. They were selected based on auxological criteria and the GH response to provocative stimuli. The GH-deficient children presented a blunted GH (mean +/- SEM; microgram/L) discharge after insulin-induced hypoglycemia (2.9 +/- 0.4), propranolol-exercise (7.4 +/- 1.5), and clonidine (6.5 +/- 0.8) compared with values in the normal children (7.2 +/- 2.2, 15.8 +/- 2.4, and 15.6 +/- 1.8, respectively). As expected, GH-releasing hormone (GHRH)-induced GH discharge in GH-deficient children (33.2 +/- 4.9) was similar to that in the control children (35.1 +/- 6.0). Administration of 2 mg/m2 body surface dexamethasone, iv, to normal children induced, 3 h later, a mean GH peak of 14.1 +/- 1.2 micrograms/L. This was significantly higher that the corticoid-induced GH peak in GH-deficient children (6.7 +/- 1.1 micrograms/L). The corticoid-induced areas under the secretory curve were 1130 +/- 55 and 616 +/- 54 for the control and GH-deficient children, respectively. GH release in children after dexamethasone administration followed the pattern previously described for adults, i.e. there were no modifications of basal GH levels in the first 2 h, the GH peak appeared around the third hour, and the GH levels remained increased until the fourth hour after dexamethasone administration. Individually considered, practically all control children, but only 2 of 12 GH-deficient children, presented a dexamethasone-induced GH peak over the 10 micrograms/L level. In both normal and GH-deficient patients, corticoids appeared just as potent a stimulus as propranolol-exercise and clonidine, and more potent than hypoglycemia. This new stimulus showed a pattern similar to that of the hypothalamic stimuli, but clearly different with respect to the pituitary one (GHRH), suggesting that corticoids activate GH secretion by acting at hypothalamic level. In conclusion, acute administration of corticoids could be a suitable test in the diagnostic armamentaria of GH-deficient states.", 
    "23": "The circadian rhythm of core body temperature (BTc), with maxima during the day and minima at night, is normally coupled with the sleep-wake cycle. Pineal melatonin secretion occurs contemporaneously during the nighttime hours and is mediated by the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors during darkness. The hypothesis that nocturnal melatonin secretion may be involved in the regulation of the human circadian BTc rhythm was examined. The temporal relationship between melatonin and the circadian BTc rhythm was characterized in 12 young women, normally entrained to the light-dark cycle. Melatonin levels were manipulated through the administration of exogenous melatonin (2.5 mg, orally) during the daytime (n = 6) or suppression of endogenous nocturnal melatonin secretion by the beta-adrenergic antagonist atenolol (100 mg; n = 6) in double blind placebo-controlled experiments conducted during 2 consecutive days. Serum melatonin levels and BTc were monitored at 20- and 10-min intervals, respectively. In a nightshift worker the temporal relationship between the circadian rhythm of melatonin and BTc was investigated before and after entrainment to a reversed wake-sleep cycle. Our data show that in normally entrained subjects, the time course and amplitude of nocturnal melatonin secretion were temporally coupled with the decline of BTc (r = 0.97; P less than 0.00001). The same occurred in the nightshift worker, both during the dissociation and after entrainment to the reversed sleep-wake cycle. Compared with placebo, administration of melatonin significantly reduced daytime BTc (P less than 0.01), and the suppression of melatonin (by atenolol) attenuated the nocturnal decline of BTc (P less than 0.01). Cosinor analysis showed that the amplitude of the circadian BTc rhythm was reduced by about 40% in response to both daytime melatonin administration (P less than 0.05) and nocturnal melatonin suppression (P less than 0.02). In conclusion, circadian rhythms of melatonin and BTc are inversely coupled. The demonstrated hypothermic properties of melatonin are accountable for the generation of at least 40% of the amplitude of the circadian BTc rhythm. Manipulation of melatonin levels might be clinically useful to resynchronize the BTc rhythm under conditions of BTc rhythm desynchronization.", 
    "24": "Myocardial ischemia is considered to be a possible stimulus for development of the coronary collateral circulation. We therefore hypothesized that chronic reduction of myocardial oxygen demand to lessen ischemia would attenuate coronary collateral development over an 8-week period using left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) ameroid-induced constriction in pigs.", 
    "25": "Collateral development was assessed by myocardial blood flow (radioactive microspheres) and left ventricular regional function (sonomicrometer dimension gauges). beta-Adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol (160 or 320 mg b.i.d.p.o.) was initiated in 15 animals 1 day after surgery. Compared with 16 untreated animals, beta-adrenoceptor antagonism was documented in the treated group by 1) pharmacological stimulation with isoproterenol, 2) physiological stimulation during graded treadmill exercise, and 3) repeated long-term biotelemetry recordings of oxygen demand (heart rate and blood pressure) and regional myocardial function. In addition to pharmacological and physiological verification of beta-blockade, biotelemetry showed that, compared with the untreated animals, propranolol significantly reduced the daily number, individual duration, and severity of events representing myocardial dysfunction. This suggests that in the beta-blocked group, little if any ischemia was present throughout the first 5 weeks when collateral growth occurs. Transmural myocardial blood flow (expressed as a ratio of flow in the LCx region to the nonoccluded region of the left ventricle) and systolic wall thickening in the LCx region were determined at rest and during treadmill exercise (240 beats per minute) 31-38 days (5 weeks) and 60-67 days (8 weeks) after surgery. Propranolol was withdrawn 3 days before flow and function determinations and was resumed immediately after testing. Blood flow ratios at 5 weeks decreased similarly from rest to exercise in the untreated (0.83 +/- 0.04 to 0.60 +/- 0.05, p less than 0.05) and beta-blockade group (0.82 +/- 0.09 to 0.57 +/- 0.10, p less than 0.05). Systolic wall thickening from rest to exercise was attenuated to the same degree in the untreated (59 +/- 6% to 38 +/- 6%, p less than 0.05) and beta-blockade group (50 +/- 8% to 30 +/- 5%, p less than 0.05). Similar flow and function responses were observed in both groups at 8 weeks.",

    "27": "During atrial flutter, double potentials may be recorded at specific sites in the atria. It has been suggested that double potentials represent sequential activations at the center of the reentrant circuit. An alternative hypothesis is that double potentials represent electrical activity in an area of slow conduction. Understanding their mechanism is important because double potentials have been considered a possible indicator of target sites for catheter ablation.", 
    "28": "We systematically studied double potentials in our canine model of atrial flutter produced by right atrial crush injury using a 64-channel computerized mapping system with 56 electrodes on the right atrium in seven mongrel dogs under general anesthesia. Activation maps were recorded during sinus rhythm before and after crush injury, during rapid pacing above and below the crush injury, and during sustained atrial flutter, entrainment of atrial flutter, and termination of atrial flutter induced with D-sotalol (2 mg/kg). During sinus rhythm before crush injury, activation was uniform, and double potentials were not recorded in any dog. After crush injury, activation proceeded up to and around the crush injury, and narrowly split double potentials were recorded in two of seven dogs. During rapid pacing above and below the crush injury, double potentials were recorded in five dogs. During 14 episodes of atrial flutter (mean cycle length, 140 +/- 16 msec), double potentials were recorded at electrodes along the crush injury. The activation time of the early x component of the double potentials (25 +/- 13 msec) was similar to that of adjacent electrodes above the crush injury (24 +/- 11 msec), and the activation time of the late y component (89 +/- 13 msec) was similar to that of adjacent electrodes below the crush injury (91 +/- 14 msec). The timing of the x and y components was dependent on the location of the recording electrode, with x and y widely spaced at the end of the crush injury near the area of earliest atrial activation during atrial flutter, more equally timed at the center of the crush injury, and more closely timed at the end of the crush injury opposite the area of earliest activation. During transient entrainment, double potentials were accelerated to the pacing rate, but their activation time relative to adjacent electrodes was maintained. During abrupt termination of atrial flutter, the early x component of the double potential was always recorded, but the late y component was not, because of conduction block below the posterior end of the crush injury.", 
    "29": "This study has shown in our canine model of atrial flutter that double potentials are recorded from the center of the reentrant circuit and that they represent sequential activations as the reentrant wave front passes on either side of the crush injury.",

    "31": "In a crossover study, 12 patients with mild to moderate hypertension were given placebo, captopril (12.5 to 50 mg three times a day), and nadolol (20 to 160 mg once a day) to control the resting diastolic blood pressure to a nearly identical degree (p less than 0.0001) (106.1 +/- 4 placebo, 89.6 +/- 8 captopril, 89.8 +/- 7 nadolol). Both drugs lowered (p less than 0.0004) systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and during exercise. However, systolic blood pressure lowering during exercise was more pronounced (p less than 0.05) with nadolol than with captopril (difference of 6 mmHg, 16 mmHg, and 21 mmHg at 5.0, 7.0, and 9.0 metabolic equivalents (METS) respectively). Heart rate was lower (p less than 0.05) at rest and during exercise with nadolol as compared with placebo and with captopril. These data imply different mechanisms of action of the two drugs at rest and during exercise and may help in selection of drug therapy in special patient subsets.", 
    "32": "To study the efficacy of medical treatment for preventing syncopal recurrences in patients affected by tilt-induced neurally mediated syncope, a randomized placebo-treatment prospective study was performed in 30 patients (10 men and 20 women, mean age 42 +/- 21 years) who had syncope reproduced in 2 consecutive head-up tilt-table tests without pharmacologic intervention (n = 20) or during isoproterenol infusion (n = 10). Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups: 15 to placebo, and 15 to drug therapy (determined on the basis of serial pharmacologic tilting tests). Therapy was either atenolol (n = 7), dihydroergotamine (n = 2), domperidone (n = 2), cafedrine (n = 1), or elastic compression stockings, alone or in association with drugs (n = 3). During a mean of 10 +/- 7 months of follow-up, syncope recurred in 3 patients (20%) in the treatment group and in 4 (27%) in the placebo group; actuarial rates of absence of syncopal recurrences after 20 months were 70 and 67%, respectively. Thus, the outcome of either treated or untreated patients was favorable (with a low recurrence rate of syncope), and the usefulness of tilting-guided medical therapy remains uncertain.", 
    "33": "The role of endogenous calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the nonadrenergic noncholinergic depressor response to spinal cord stimulation was studied in the pithed rat in vivo. Pithed rats were given hexamethonium (2 mg/kg per minute i.v.) to block autonomic outflow, and mean blood pressure was artificially maintained at approximately 100 mm Hg with methoxamine (10-15 micrograms/kg per minute i.v.). Electrical stimulation of the spinal cord at the level of the lower thoracic vertebra (T9-12) caused a fall in blood pressure in a frequency-dependent (0.5-10 Hz), voltage-dependent (2.5-50 V), and pulse duration-dependent (0.25-8 msec) manner. The heart rate did not change during the depressor response. The depressor response was long lasting, and the maximum response was elicited by stimulation at 4-6 Hz. The neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (100 micrograms/kg i.v.) abolished the depressor response to spinal cord stimulation, whereas treatment with propranolol (0.5 mg/kg per minute i.v.), atropine (0.05 mg/kg per minute i.v.), or a combination of pyrilamine (0.5 mg/kg per minute i.v.) and cimetidine (0.5 mg/kg per minute i.v.) did not affect the response. In pithed rats treated with capsaicin (total dose of 500 mg/kg s.c.), spinal cord stimulation caused a slight depressor response. Exogenous CGRP, but not acetylcholine, isoproterenol, histamine, or substance P, caused a sustained fall in blood pressure that mimicked the spinal cord stimulation-induced depressor response. Continuous infusion of CGRP[8-37] (60 nmol/kg per minute i.v.), a CGRP receptor antagonist, markedly inhibited the depressor responses not only to spinal cord stimulation but also to exogenous CGRP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "We present a case treated with aprindine and metoprolol combined with a DDD type pacemaker for repetitive monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. A 50-year-old man was admitted because of palpitation and near syncope attack. Electrocardiogram showed repetitive monomorphic ventricular tachycardias (RBBB LAD type) and R-R interval of about 440 msec and I degree A-V block in sinus rhythm. Electrophysiologic study disclosed that overdrive pacing in HRA suppressed ventricular tachycardias. Left ventriculography revealed a dilated left ventricular and decreased contractility. Antiarrhythmic agents such as quinidine sulfate, procainamide, disopyramide, mexiletine, lidocaine and propranolol were not effective. But, the combination of propranolol and aprindine decreased the rate of the ventricular tachycardia. With aprindine 60 mg/day and metoprolol 60 mg/day combined with the atrioventricular sequential pacing at 85/min, ventricular tachycardia completely disappeared.", 
    "35": "The effects of dl-propranolol on the behaviour of adult male CD1 mice were examined after acute intraperitoneal injection (1.5 and 6 mg/kg) and after administration for 10-13 days in the drinking fluid at 12.4 mg/l (1.9 mg/kg daily) and 24.9 mg/l (4.6 mg/kg daily). The behaviour of each mouse was examined by ethological procedures during 5 min social encounters with an untreated partner in an aversive and a less aversive situation, an unfamiliar neutral cage and the animals' home cage. The behaviour of each mouse also was monitored for 5 min in the light-dark box. In the acute studies, behavioural observations commenced at 30 min after the injection. In the light-dark box, propranolol, after acute administration, increased the number of transitions between the light and dark compartments and increased scanning in the light area but propranolol had no significant effect after subchronic administration. In the home cage, propranolol significantly increased social investigation during social encounters and reduced exploratory activity at all doses tested, after both acute and subchronic administration. In the neutral cage, propranolol, after acute administration, increased digging of the sawdust and decreased exploratory activity at both dose levels, while at the largest dose it also increased social investigation. In the neutral cage, propranolol, given by subchronic administration, increased aggressive behaviour as well as social investigation and digging of the sawdust at both dose levels, while reducing non-social exploratory activity. The largest dose of propranolol also increased investigation of the substrate. These results indicate that propranolol increased reactivity to normal environmental and social stimuli, in addition to its anxiolytic profile of behavioural effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "1. The effects of chronic administration of antihypertensive drugs on the vasodilator response mediated by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-containing nerves were investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. A 7 week period of antihypertensive treatment with captopril, nicardipine or propranolol during the developmental phase (8-15 weeks of age) significantly lowered the mean blood pressure of SHR when compared with non-treated SHR. 3. The mesenteric vascular beds isolated from SHR, which were chronically administered with captopril, propranolol or nicardipine, were perfused with Krebs' solution containing 7 mumol/L methoxamine to produce active tone and 5 mumol/L guanethidine to block adrenergic neurotransmission. 4. In the mesenteric vascular bed with active tone, perivascular nerve stimulation (PNS; 0.5-8 Hz) caused a frequency-dependent vasodilator response that was abolished by 100 nmol/L tetrodotoxin (neurotoxin) or 1 mumol/L CGRP (8-37), a CGRP receptor antagonist. 5. CGRP-containing nerve-mediated vasodilator responses were significantly greater in captopril-treated SHR and significantly smaller in nicardipine-treated SHR than in non-treated SHR. There was no difference between the response between propranolol-treated SHR and non-treated SHR. 6. These results suggest that chronic treatment with captopril reverses the reduced neurogenic vasodilation mediated by CGRP-containing nerves in SHR.",

    "38": "Effects of timolol (0.5%) and carteolol (2%) on ocular pulsatile blood flow (PBF) were studied in healthy adult volunteers. PBF was measured with the BFA system, analyzing the ocular pressure waves. Each drug was instilled in one eye and PBF was measured in both eyes before and fifteen minutes after the instillation. In each drug, the PBF change between the two measurements was evaluated with a control study, which was performed in the same manner with physiological saline solution. In the non-instilled eyes, both timolol (n = 6) and carteolol (n = 9) had no significant change on PBF. In the instilled eyes, timolol (n = 6) caused no significant change, whereas carteolol (n = 9) increased PBF significantly. The range of the BFA system measurement error was within 4.7 +/- 2.4 microliters/min (P = 95%). Taking the error into account in each instilled eye, timolol (n = 6) increased PBF in 3 eyes and decreased it in 3 eyes, while carteolol (n = 9) increased PBF in 7 eyes, did not change it in one eye and decreased it in one eye. It is thought the effect of carteolol to increase PBF may be explained by endothelium-dependent relaxing factor (EDRF).", 
    "39": "The central nervous system (CNS) may play a larger role than previously thought in the development of ventricular fibrillation after coronary artery occlusion. The probability of ventricular fibrillation after complete, permanent occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery was 52% in conscious control pigs. After the administration into the lateral cerebral ventricle of tyrosine, the amino acid precursor of the catecholamine neurotransmitters, 100% of the animals developed ventricular fibrillation. After tyrosine plus propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, only 9% of pigs developed ventricular fibrillation. Treatment with propranolol alone did not affect the outcome. Catecholamine synthesis in the CNS may be associated with the development of ventricular fibrillation after coronary artery occlusion.", 
    "40": "Endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), through its inhibitory second messenger guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP), inhibits renin release in vitro. To determine whether EDRF affects renin in vivo, we tested whether EDRF synthesis inhibition could stimulate renin secretion in intact rats. Because EDRF synthesis inhibition increases blood pressure and consequently withdraws sympathetic activity (both renin inhibitory signals), we also studied the effect of L-N omega-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) when renal perfusion pressure was controlled and during beta-adrenergic blockade. Mean blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and plasma renin activity (PRA) were measured in anesthetized rats before and after EDRF synthesis inhibition by a 10 mg/kg body wt bolus of L-NAME. L-NAME decreased PRA by 67% [from 11.0 +/- 2.7 to 3.7 +/- 0.8 ng angiotensin I (ANG I).ml-1.h-1, n = 12; P less than 0.001], increased BP by 20 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than 0.001), and decreased HR from 332 +/- 8 to 312 +/- 9 beats/min (P less than 0.005). We repeated our experiment in rats instrumented with an intra-aortic balloon catheter to control renal perfusion pressure and pretreated with propranolol to eliminate the beta-adrenergic effect.

    "41": "To determine if differences exist between Chinese and white subjects in their response to atropine and if the intrinsic heart rate and the autonomic contribution to the heart differ between the two races, eight white and eight Chinese males were studied. In all subjects the heart rate decreased after the first dose of atropine (0.003 mg/kg) with no difference in the bradycardia between the two races. However, as further doses were administered, the heart rate increased in both groups, resulting in a significantly (p less than 0.05) greater increase in Chinese subjects than in white subjects. The increase in heart rate for each nanogram per milliliter of atropine was 2.8-fold higher (p less than 0.05) in the Chinese subjects (19.24 +/- 4.41 beats/min) compared with white subjects (6.83 +/- 1.62 beats/min). There was no difference in the intrinsic heart rate, in the relative vagal contribution, or in relative sympathetic contribution to the heart rate between the Chinese and white subjects. These data indicate that Chinese subjects are more sensitive to the effect of atropine, which is not related to the contribution of autonomic tone to the heart.", 
    "42": "The mechanisms by which the epithelium affects reactivity of guinea pig trachealis to agonists were examined using the isolated, perfused trachea preparation. Contractile agonists (acetylcholine, methacholine, carbachol or histamine) were more potent when applied to the serosal (extraluminal, EL) surface compared to the mucosal (intraluminal, IL) surface, and the IL maximum responses to these agents were smaller. In epithelium-denuded tracheae, IL reactivity to the agonists was increased to the EL level. Physostigmine (10(-7) M) increased the EL and IL potency of acetylcholine to that of carbachol (+/- epithelium), and elevated the IL acetylcholine maximum response (+ epithelium); the relative role of epithelial acetylcholinesterase could not be defined. Indomethacin (3 x 10(-6) M) increased, in an epithelium-dependent manner, the IL acetylcholine, carbachol and histamine maximum responses to the EL level. Phentolamine plus propranolol (both 10(-6) M) potentiated the IL maximum response to methacholine, Isoproterenol also was more potent extraluminally than intraluminally, and the EL and IL maximum responses were similar. IL isoproterenol reactivity was elevated to the EL level in rubbed tracheae. Corticosterone (5 x 10(-5) M) potentiated EL and IL responses to isoproterenol (+/- epithelium); the relative role of epithelial extraneuronal uptake could not be delineated. The epithelium reduces reactivity to mucosally applied drugs by acting as a diffusion barrier. In addition, responses to mucosally administered contractile agonists are inhibited by a physiological antagonism caused by modulatory prostanoids, catecholamines and, possibly, epithelium-derived relaxing factor.", 
    "43": "The maternal-fetal disposition of labetalol, a combined alpha-1 and beta adrenergic blocker, and its pharmacodynamics in pregnancy are not well understood. This study describes the pharmacokinetics, cardiovascular and metabolic effects of labetalol in the mother and in utero fetus after a 100-mg maternal i.v. bolus administration, in the chronically instrumented pregnant sheep. Labetalol shows a triexponential decline in the mother with a total body clearance of 30.8 +/- 3.83 ml/min/kg, an apparent steady-state volume of distribution (nonparametric) of 3.02 +/- 0.18 liters/kg and terminal elimination half-life of 2.79 +/- 0.66 hr. These estimates are similar to the reported values in pregnant women. Labetalol rapidly crosses the sheep placenta. The peak fetal plasma concentration was 33.7 +/- 5.8 ng/ml, the fetal exposure to labetalol as calculated by the fetal to maternal area under the curve ratio was 14.37 +/- 1.54% and the apparent fetal elimination half-life was 3.71 +/- 0.5 hr. Labetalol persists in the amniotic and fetal tracheal fluids up to 24 hr with concentrations reaching 2- to 4 times the fetal plasma concentration. Whereas there were no significant maternal or fetal cardiovascular effects, some very significant metabolic effects were observed, including fetal and maternal lactic acidosis and hyperglycemia. Lactic acid accumulates in the fetal blood and amniotic fluid with peak concentrations (6.0 +/- 0.31 and 5.5 +/- 0.26 mM, respectively) showing a more than 300% increase over control values. The exact mechanism by which labetalol causes these metabolic effects is not clear, but it may involve its partial beta-2 agonist activity.", 
    "44": "Histopathologic study of the gastric wall of mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni was carried out at 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks post-infection (p.i.). The gastric vascular structures were more sensitive to injury with the progression of liver disease than the glandular cells, with marked submucosal edema and thickening of submucosal and subserosal vessels. By transmission electron microscopy, the mucosal microvessels had thickened basement membrane and conspicuous endothelial cells with granular cytoplasm thrown into numerous intraluminal microprojections and with increased number and size of pinocytotic vesicles. When propranolol was administered orally as 20 mg/kg daily doses for two weeks at 6, 10, 14 and 18 weeks p.i., a striking regression of gastro vascular and micro-vascular changes has been observed, particularly with early drug therapy. Based on the present study, it can be concluded that \"structural autoregulation\" of gastric vasculature to the emerging portal hypertension in chronic murine schistosomiasis mansoni, is a dynamic process that could be reversed by propranolol therapy. This response could, possibly, improve gastric mucosal perfusion and functional abnormalities which may predispose the gastric mucosa to severe damage or hemorrhage.", 
    "45": "Although labetalol (LAB), the combination of an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agent, is thought to be effective and safe for the control of postoperative hypertension, no study has focused on changes in left ventricular (LV) function when this drug was used to control postoperative hypertension. Therefore, this study determined the effects of LAB on hemodynamics and LV function assessed by 2D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in 17 patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery who experienced a postoperative hypertensive episode. Postoperatively, patients were transferred while still intubated and under fentanyl sedation to the postanesthesia care unit where a TEE probe was inserted to provide a short-axis view of the LV. When their systolic blood pressure increased above 165 mmHg for more than 4 minutes, LAB was given in a dose of 0.75 mg/kg IV, over 2 minutes. If the blood pressure was not lowered to within 10% of the preoperative values, additional doses of LAB were given. Control of hypertension was obtained in all patients and was associated with a significant decrease in heart rate (90 +/- 19 to 70 + 13 bpm), cardiac index (4.52 +/- 1.65 to 3.36 +/- 1.55 L/min/m2), and mixed venous oxygen saturation (73 +/- 10 to 63 +/- 10%). With the lower blood pressure, end-diastolic area increased, indicating myocardial depression. In conclusion, LAB can be used to effectively control hypertension during the early postoperative period after abdominal aortic surgery. However, the reduction of blood pressure is achieved principally by the negative inotropic effect of LAB, which predominates over its vasodilator action.", 
    "46": "We report the cases of four patients with secondary left ventricular hypertrophy (three due to hypertension and one to aortic stenosis) in whom Doppler echocardiography showed dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and marked impairment of diastolic filling. Each patient derived marked symptomatic benefit from treatment with either a beta-blocker (atenolol) or calcium antagonist (verapamil). Repeat Doppler studies in three patients revealed a substantial improvement in systolic and diastolic flow abnormalities. Ventricular outflow tract obstruction should be recognized as occurring in a subgroup of patients with secondary left ventricular hypertrophy, and its presence should be sought by Doppler echocardiography before embarking on therapy. Negatively inotropic or positively lusitropic agents such as beta-blockers and rate-limiting calcium antagonists appear to be logical therapy for this condition.",

The bone nature of the cells was established by assaying for specific bone protein, the osteonectin, and the parathormone receptor, an osteoblast marker. Administration of interleukin-1 alpha to cultured osteoblasts produce an increase in cellular proliferation as suggested by 3H-thymidine incorporation and cell growth studies. Interleukin-1 alpha also affected collagen synthesis confirming its potential role on bone-formation and resorption processes.", 
    "48": "The dosage of urinary catecholamines and their metabolites is a main element of diagnosis in the research of a pheochromocytoma in patients with high blood pressure. The literature reports high values of these compounds in patients treated with labetalol (an alpha/beta-blocker). An analytical interference has been evoked to explain these misleading results, which have not been observed with other beta-blockers. The goal of this work was to look for this eventual analytical interference in the dosage of urinary metanephrine by reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection, in patients with high blood pressure. Eighteen hypertensive patients, 52 +/- 14 years old, were included in the study. In 8 patients, a dosage of metanephrine, normetanephrine and creatinine on a 24 hours urine sample was performed before (D1) and 24 hours after (D3) the prescription of labetalol (200 mg twice a day). In the other group, labetalol was not prescribed but dosage was made in the same conditions. Urinary excretion of these compounds (metanephrine+normetanephrine) divided by urinary creatinine was not modified in the treated group (0.16 +/- 0.08 vs 0.14 +/- 0.04), nor in the reference group (0.17 +/- 0.08 vs 0.17 +/- 0.08). This study shows that administration of labetalol in patients with essential hypertension does not interfere with urinary metanephrine and normetanephrine determination after 48 hours of treatment. This implies that research for a pheochromocytoma is possible in patients with hypertension and receiving labetalol, by using reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled with an electrochemical detector for the dosage of urinary metanephrine and normetanephrine.", 
    "49": "The high incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy shows the great interest in understanding the pathophysiology of this process. Many reports suggest the role of catecholamines in generating left ventricular hypertrophy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of labetalol on myocardial norepinephrine content in hypertensive subjects with left ventricular hypertrophy by using an isotopic norepinephrine marker, the 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG). Eight male and female hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy were investigated after a 30 day placebo period. Resting, ambulatory and effort blood pressure was measured. Echocardiographic parameters allowed measure of left ventricular mass index according to Devereux. And we considered left ventricular hypertrophy as left ventricular mass index greater than 120 g/m2. Cardiac and mediastinal radioactivity is detected 4 h after a 4 mCi i.v. injection of 123I-MIBG and MIBG myocardial uptake is definite as the cardiac/mediastinal ratio (N : 1.78 +/- 0.19). All subjects received at the beginning of the study (D0) 2 tablets of labetalol 200 mg, increased to 4 tablets if diastolic blood pressure during follow-up remained above 95 mmHg. Patients again underwent these explorations after 3 months of treatment (D90). Labetalol decreases in considerable manner MIBG myocardial uptake as it has been shown that it decreases tissular norepinephrine content in experimental studies. Therefore, MIBG myocardial uptake seems to be a reliable tool in evaluating drugs effect on cardiac sympathetic nervous system.",

    "52": "Effects of adenosine and nucleotides on the release of previously stored [3H]-noradrenaline were studied in rabbit brain cortex slices. The slices were stimulated twice, in most experiments by 6 electrical field pulses delivered at 100 Hz. Adenosine and the nucleotides AMP, ADP, ATP, AMPS, ADP beta S, ATP gamma S, beta,gamma-imido-ATP and beta,gamma-methylene-ATP all reduced the evoked overflow of tritiated compounds. For purines for which concentration-response curves were determined, the order of potency was adenosine greater than ATP approximately ATP gamma S approximately beta,gamma-imido-ATP approximately ADP greater than beta,gamma-methylene-ATP. AMP 30 mumol/l and AMPS 30 mumol/l were approximately equieffective with 30 mumol/l of adenosine and ATP gamma S, and ADP beta S 30 mumol/l was approximately equieffective with 30 mumol/l of ADP. alpha,beta-Methylene-ADP, 2-methylthio-ATP, UTP and GTP gamma S did not change the evoked overflow of tritium. alpha,beta-Methylene-ATP caused an increase; however, the increase was small and became significant only after 59 min of exposure to alpha,beta-methylene-ATP or when the slices were stimulated by 30 pulses, 10 Hz. Neither adenosine deaminase (100 U/l) nor the blocker of 5'-nucleotidase, alpha,beta-methylene-ADP (10 mumol/l), attenuated the inhibition caused by ATP, ATP gamma S and beta,gamma-methylene-ATP, despite the fact that adenosine deaminase abolished the effect of adenosine. 8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX, 10 nmol/l) shifted the concentration-response curves of adenosine, ATP gamma S, beta,gamma-imido-ATP and beta,gamma-methylene-ATP to the right by very similar degrees. 8-(p-Sulphophenyl)-theophylline (30 and 300 mumol/l) also markedly antagonized the inhibition produced by ATP gamma S. alpha,beta-Methylene-ATP (10 and 30 mumol/l) and suramin (100 mumol/l) did not modify the effects of adenosine, ATP gamma S and beta,gamma-methylene-ATP. It is concluded that nucleotides themselves can inhibit the release of noradrenaline in the rabbit brain cortex. The nucleotides and adenosine seem to act at the same site, i.e., the A1 subtype of the P1-purinoceptor. The results support the notion that metabolically stable, phosphate chain-modified nucleotides such as ATP gamma S, beta,gamma-imido-ATP and beta,gamma-methylene-ATP can be potent P1 agonists. No evidence was found for presynaptic P2x-, P2y- or P3-purinoceptors.", 
    "53": "N-nitrosooxprenolol (NO-oxprenolol) might be formed in the stomach of patients taking the beta-adrenergic blocking drug, oxprenolol. This nitroso derivative has previously been shown to induce DNA damage and repair in both rat and human cultured hepatocytes. The results of the present study show that in the presence of co-cultured rat hepatocytes, 0.03 mM NO-oxprenolol produced a significant increase in the frequency of 6-thioguanine-resistant but not of ouabain-resistant mutants. No mutagenic activity was detected in the absence of metabolic activation. In mice, NO-oxprenolol (1 g/kg) increased the incidence of micronucleated cells in the liver but not in the bone marrow and the spleen. These results suggest that NO-oxprenolol, consistent with its chemical nature of nitrosamine, is biotransformed into short-lived reactive species.", 
    "54": "In patients with mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVP) various electrophysiological abnormalities occur. There are convergent opinions concerning QT distance variability and the influence of autonomic nervous system on ventricular repolarization in this syndrome. In 38 MVP patients (group I) and 24 subjects without this abnormality (group II) ecg was recorded during transvenous right atrial pacing at baseline, after ajmaline administration and after pharmacological autonomic blockade (atropine + propranolol). The following ventricular repolarization parameters were analysed: QTe (distance to the end of T wave), JTe (distance between J point and the end of T wave--so called \"pure repolarization\"), QTdys (repolarization dispersion) and the corrected QTc.QTe during 90/min right atrial pacing was significantly shorter than QTc in both groups. QTc was abnormally prolonged (above 440 msec) in MVP group. Ajmaline administration prolonged QTe in group II only, whereas autonomic blockade resulted in marked shortening of QTe in MVP group. QTdys was significantly prolonged only after ajmaline administration in group II. Based on above results, the following conclusions are made: 1) Right atrial pacing technique may be used for calculating standardized QT distance, an alternative to corrected QT. 2) Ajmaline test is useless in ventricular repolarization estimations in MVP patients. 3) In MVP patients the influence of adrenergic system on ventricular repolarization at rest appears to be greater than in non-MVP subjects.", 
    "55": "The aim of the present study was to further investigate the role of the adrenergic system on insulin action using the euglycemic clamp technique. Whole-body glucose metabolism (GM) was calculated as the glucose infusion rate for maintaining euglycemia under insulin infusion and used as an indicator of insulin sensitivity. Euglycemic clamps were performed in adrenodemedullated, epinephrine-treated, phentolamine-treated (alpha-blockade), propranolol-treated (beta-blockade), and epinephrine plus phentolamine and/or propranolol-treated rats. The following results were obtained at an insulin level of approximately 80 mU/l. GM in adrenodemedullated rats (13.97 +/- 0.98 mg/kg/min) was significantly higher than that of the control rats (10.26 +/- 0.50 mg/kg/min, P less than 0.01). GM in epinephrine-treated rats (1.7 mg/kg body weight/h) was 2.12 +/- 0.49 mg/kg/min (P less than 0.001 vs. control). Dose-response curves for phentolamine and propranolol established maximally effective doses (3.0 mg and 12 mg/kg body weight/h, respectively). Using these doses, GM in epinephrine plus phentolamine-treated rats (4.90 +/- 0.39 mg/kg/min) was significantly higher than that of epinephrine alone and GM in epinephrine and propranolol-treated rats (4.49 +/- 0.47 mg/kg/min) was also significantly higher than that of the epinephrine alone. GM in the epinephrine plus both propranolol and phentolamine (5.94 +/- 0.45 mg/kg/min) was significantly higher than that of the epinephrine alone, but not different from either treatment alone and was not additive. Neither phentolamine alone (9.48 +/- 1.45 mg/kg/min), propranolol alone (10.36 +/- 0.55 mg/kg/min) or the combination of blockades (11.14 +/- 0.65 mg/kg/min) had any effect on GM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "This paper reports the case of a woman, who underwent surgery because of cholelithiasis, with intraoperative finding of prehepatic portal hypertension from portal vein thrombosis (\"portal cavernoma\") with healthy liver, later confirmed by angiographic studies. This rare pathologic association carries a higher risk of major operative complications; therefore the Authors agree with the general belief that, for these cases, biliary tract surgery should be as simple and safe as possible. In the case of preoperative diagnosis of biliary disease associated with portal cavernoma, should a surgical approach on the biliary tract be required, we agree on the advisability of performing a shunting procedure before any kind of biliary surgery. In case of variceal bleeding endoscopic sclerotherapy will be the first choice; surgical procedures (shunting) should be seen as a second choice in case of rebleeding after sclerotherapy.", 
    "57": "The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that bradycardia in exercise-trained rats results from decreased intrinsic automaticity of the sinoatrial (SA) node and/or alterations in the responsiveness of the beta-receptors of atrial pacemaker cells. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into exercise trained (ET) and sedentary (SED) groups. ET rats underwent a 12-16 wk program of progressive treadmill training, during which time the SED rats were cage confined. In vivo, resting heart rates were significantly less (P less than 0.05) in ET rats (301 +/- 8 bpm) compared with the SED group (320 +/- 6 bpm). In vitro experiments were conducted on atria isolated from ET and SED rats, and the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol was used to investigate cardiac adrenergic control of chronotropic mechanisms in spontaneously beating right atria and inotropic mechanisms in electrically paced (1 Hz) left atria. There were no significant differences between ET and SED cardiac preparations in either the efficacy (maximal response) or potency (EC50) of isoproterenol dose-response relationships for chronotropic or inotropic responses. Intrinsic right atrial beating frequency, measured in the presence of beta-adrenoceptor block by propranolol and cholinergic muscarinic block by atropine, was lower in ET rats. We conclude that training-induced bradycardia in rats is related, at least in part, to alterations in intrinsic automaticity of SA nodal pacemaker tissue, but does not appear to be associated with changes in the properties of the beta 1-adrenoceptors or their affiliated signal transduction mechanisms in either SA pacemaker cells or atrial myocytes.",

This treatment caused a dramatic increase in the level of cystatin S (a cysteine proteinase inhibitor belonging to family 2 of cystatin superfamily) in enlarged submandibular glands. 2. Immunochemical analysis using antibody against rat cystatin S and electrophoretic analysis confirmed that the protein induced by papain was identical to that induced by isoproterenol. 3. Induction of the cystatin S in the submandibular glands by oral administration of papain suggested a biological response which plays a role in preventing injury exogenous proteinase.", 
    "59": "This study was designed to compare flunarizine, a cerebro-specific calcium channel antagonist, and propranolol in the prophylaxis of migraine with or without aura. Following a 1 month single-blind placebo baseline period, 94 patients were equitably randomised under double-blind conditions to take flunarizine 10 mg daily or propranolol 80 mg twice daily for 4 months. Both treatments led to a significant reduction in the frequency of migraines and use of rescue analgesics with a significantly greater decrease in number of attacks for flunarizine after 1 and 4 months. Neither treatment affected the severity nor duration of migraines. Overall, 67% of flunarizine patients and 51% of propranolol patients responded positively. Propranolol significantly reduced blood pressure and heart rate; flunarizine had no effect on cardiovascular function. Weight gain was noted with both treatments. Flunarizine is at least as effective as propranolol in the prophylactic treatment of migraine and may have a better safety profile.", 
    "60": "1. The actions and mechanisms of action of novel analogues of sotalol which prolong cardiac action potentials were investigated in guinea-pig and rabbit isolated ventricular cells. 2. In guinea-pig and rabbit cells the compounds significantly prolonged action potential duration at 20% and 90% repolarization levels without affecting resting membrane potential. In guinea-pig but not rabbit cells there was an increase in action potential amplitude and in rabbit cells there was no change in the shape or position of the 'notch' in the action potential. 3. Possible mechanisms of action were studied in more detail in the case of compound II (1-(4-methanesulphonamidophenoxy)-3-(N-methyl 3,4 dichlorophenylethylamino)-2-propanol). Prolongation of action potential duration continued to occur in the presence of nisoldipine, and calcium currents recorded under voltage-clamp conditions were not reduced by compound II (1 microM). Action potential prolongation by compound II was also unaffected in the presence of 10 microM tetrodotoxin. 4. Compound II (1 microM) did not influence IK1 assessed from the current during ramp changes in membrane potential (20 mV s-1) over the range -90 to -10 mV. 5. Compound II (1 microM) blocked time-dependent delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) activated by step depolarizations and recorded as an outward tail following repolarization. When a submaximal concentration (50 nM) was applied there was no change in the apparent reversal potential of IK.6. Submaximal concentrations of compound II were without effect on activation of IK with time at a membrane potential of + 40 mV, and no changes were detected in the time constants of the two components of IK decay over the range of potentials - 60 to 0 mV. Compound 11 (50 nM) appeared to cause a small shift in the activation of IK with membrane potential (an apparent shift of approximately 10mV in the depolarizing direction at the mid-point of the curve).7. Log dose-response curves for action potential prolongation and for blockade of IK by compound II were similar. The IC50 for compound II was approximately 30 nM.8. It is concluded that this novel series of compounds prolongs action potential duration, and that in the case of compound II the evidence supports a potent selective effect on the time-dependent potassium current IK, an effect which can account for this prolongation.", 
    "61": "The benzopyran-derivative bimakalim is an ATP-dependent potassium channel activator that has been shown to be a potent arterial vasodilator in anesthetized pigs. In the present study we evaluated the cardiovascular profile of bimakalim in normal conscious animals and conscious animals with chronic left ventricular dysfunction and compared the results to those obtained with nicorandil. In normal conscious pigs, bimakalim (37.5-300 ng/kg/min, n = 6) and nicorandil (10-80 micrograms/kg/min, n = 8) increased cardiac output from 2.7 +/- 0.1 l/min to 3.8 +/- 0.2 l/min and from 2.7 +/- 0.1 l/min to 3.9 +/- 0.3 l/min (both p less than .05) due to increases in heart rate (up to 62 +/- 14% and 74 +/- 9%, respectively, both p less than .05). The mean arterial blood pressure decreased gradually from 104 +/- 4 mmHg to 91 +/- 5 mmHg with bimakalim and from 98 +/- 3 mmHg to 84 +/- 5 mmHg with nicorandil (both p less than .05), due to similar decreases in systemic vascular resistance. LVdP/dtmax also increased with both drugs (up to 48 +/- 11% and 69 +/- 7%, respectively, p less than .05), but left ventricular end-diastolic pressure remained unchanged with bimakalim, while it gradually decreased from 9 +/- 1 mmHg to 5 +/- 1 mmHg (p less than .05) with nicorandil. In pigs with a 3- to 4-week-old myocardial infarction, the vasodilator responses to bimakalim (n = 8) and nicorandil (n = 9) were not affected, but the increases in heart rate and LVdP/dtmax were attenuated compared to the effects in the normal animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "62": "Felodipine is a vascular-selective, dihydropyridine calcium antagonist previously investigated as a conventional tablet formulation administered twice daily. More recently considerable experience has been gained with an extended release (ER) formulation which has the convenience of once daily administration. Felodipine ER has been well studied in patients with essential hypertension. As monotherapy in mild to moderate essential hypertension, felodipine ER is at least as effective in reducing blood pressure as other calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, diuretics and ACE inhibitors, with some results favouring felodipine ER at a statistically significant level at the dosages used. It is also effective combined with controlled release metoprolol or enalapril in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. In patients with more severe forms of essential hypertension uncontrolled by beta-blocker and/or diuretic therapy, felodipine ER was effective as an 'add-on' therapy in placebo-controlled trials, and, at the dosages used, more effective than either sustained release nifedipine or nitrendipine. Felodipine produces effective control of blood pressure without negative effects on cardiac performance. In addition to its antihypertensive action, results suggest that felodipine therapy is associated with significant regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. Furthermore, it appears suitable for use in patients with concomitant diabetes, renal dysfunction or asthma, and is also being investigated for use in patients with congestive heart failure or angina pectoris. Felodipine ER is an effective drug for the treatment of all grades of essential hypertension, and can be used both as monotherapy and in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Further clinical experience should fully establish the long term tolerability of felodipine ER and consequently its place in therapy relative to other accepted antihypertensive drugs. However, with the convenience of once daily administration, felodipine ER is a worthwhile innovation in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "63": "A placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study was undertaken in 10 normal subjects to examine the effects of arotinolol (10 mg bid), a nonselective beta blocker with alpha-blocking activity, on exercise capacity and hormone levels during exercise after a 2-week treatment period. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) and blood lactic acid concentration (LA) were measured during progressive exercise testing. An exercise intensity equivalent to 4 mmol/l of LA was used for the constant workload exercise test. Humoral factors were measured after 20 minutes of constant workload exercise. The administration of arotinolol significantly decreased systolic blood pressure and heart rate at rest and during exercise, but diastolic blood pressure did not change. No significant difference was found between arotinolol and placebo with regard to VO2 max and maximal workload. Plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (PAC), and norepinephrine (NE) levels at rest and during exercise did not differ between the two treatments. In contrast, plasma epinephrine (EN) levels at rest and during exercise were significantly greater with arotinolol. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) at rest did not differ between the two treatments. However, exercise caused a significant increase in ANP after arotinolol treatment. These findings suggest that arotinolol decreases blood pressure and heart rate without affecting exercise capacity.", 
    "64": "We examined the importance of a long plasma half-life (t1/2) on the antianginal effects of beta-blockade by comparing equivalent doses of once-daily atenolol 100 mg (t1/2 6-8 h) and betaxolol 20 mg (t1/2 20-22 h) in a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study of 20 patients with stable angina pectoris. At 20 h postdose, heart rate (HR) was lower with betaxolol than with atenolol whereas blood pressure (BP) was equally reduced by both drugs. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory HR recording demonstrated that this difference existed for the last 6 h of the dosage cycle. During treadmill exercise, HR remained lower with betaxolol than with atenolol and exercise time was significantly prolonged only by betaxolol. With placebo, radionuclide ventriculography demonstrated that left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreased during exercise. Betaxolol, but not atenolol, significantly attenuated the exercise-induced decrease in EF. Thus, the long plasma t1/2 of betaxolol is associated with a reduction in exercise-induced ischemia when tested toward the end of the 24-h dosage cycle. Plasma t1/2 therefore is of clinical relevance to the antianginal, but not antihypertensive, actions of beta-blockers.", 
    "65": "Eight hundred seventy-six men and women with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95-115 mm Hg during a 4-week placebo period were included in a multicenter trial; 479 patients had previously been treated for hypertension. The patients were randomized to receive isradipine or metoprolol; both groups were comparable for age, weight, height, smoking habits, and duration of hypertension. By the end of the placebo period, 79 patients did not fulfill the final entry criteria and were withdrawn. The isradipine group consisted of 398 patients (164 women and 234 men), and the metoprolol group consisted of 399 patients (173 women and 226 men). The initial dose of isradipine was 1.25 mg twice daily (b.i.d.), and the initial dose of metoprolol was 50 mg b.i.d.; the doses were doubled after 4 weeks if DBP had not decreased to less than or equal to 90 mm Hg. After 8 weeks, the isradipine group began combination therapy with metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. and the metoprolol group began combination therapy with isradipine 1.25 mg b.i.d. if DBP was not less than or equal to 90 mm Hg. After 8 weeks monotherapy, mean BP (MBP) was reduced by 13/11 mm Hg (161/104 to 148/93) in the isradipine group and by 15/12 mm Hg (160/103 to 145/91) in the metoprolol group. Monotherapy with isradipine normalized DBP to less than or equal to 90 mm Hg in 52% with a mean dose of 4.26 mg daily, and monotherapy with metoprolol normalized DBP in 58% with a mean dose of 155 mg daily.1+", 
    "66": "During a double-blind, randomized study in hypertensive patients, changes in blood pressure (BP) and in plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels during treatment with celiprolol were compared with those occurring during nifedipine treatment. Fifty-three patients (28 men and 25 women) with mild-to-moderate hypertension, aged 20-64 years, were studied. After a 1-month placebo run-in period, patients were randomly assigned to receive either nifedipine (40 mg daily) or celiprolol (200 mg daily) each time using a double dummy technique. After 6 weeks, dosages of each drug could be doubled. Both drugs caused similar reductions in blood pressure but after 12 weeks treatment, the percentage of decrease in diastolic BP (DBP) was more pronounced (p less than 0.01) in the nifedipine group (-18%) than in the celiprolol group (-12%). After 6 weeks, there were no differences in plasma lipids between the two treatment groups. However, the changes after 12 weeks treatment were different (p less than 0.05) between the groups, leading to lower levels of plasma esterified cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apoprotein AI, AII, and B in the celiprolol group. Plasma lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activity (LCAT) was not modified, suggesting that reverse cholesterol transport was not affected by the drugs. In both treatment groups, a significant positive relationship was observed between changes in LDL cholesterol and apoprotein B. As compared with nifedipine, celiprolol after 12-week therapy had a rather favorable plasma lipid profile. The clinical relevance of such findings, in terms of prevention of cardiovascular complications, has yet to be established.", 
    "67": "The antihypertensive and hemodynamic effects of lisinopril and atenolol were evaluated in 21 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic performances were assessed prior to and following treatment by first-pass radionuclide cineangiography at rest and during peak upright bicycle exercise. Both lisinopril and atenolol treatment significantly reduced the blood pressure. Lisinopril therapy was associated with a reduction in systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes but no change in stroke volume, cardiac output, peak ejection rate, peak filling rate, time to peak ejection rate, or time to peak filling rate. In contrast, atenolol therapy was associated with an increase in end-diastolic volume and stroke volume but no change in cardiac output; the left ventricular peak ejection and peak filling rates were decreased by atenolol treatment. Although both lisinopril and atenolol each significantly reduced the blood pressure, lisinopril had no effect on left ventricular systolic or diastolic performance; in contrast, atenolol decreased both systolic and diastolic parameters of ventricular performance. Left ventricular function may be affected in significantly different ways despite apparent similarities in blood pressure control in patients who respond to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition or beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Differences in hemodynamic response to an antihypertensive agent may be important in the selection of a drug for the treatment of subsets of patients with cardiac function abnormalities.", 
    "68": "To examine whether stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors may affect the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in the rat heart, norepinephrine (NE) and the alpha-adrenergic agonist norfenephrine were used. NE was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion in awake rats for 3 days. It stimulated the activity of cardiac glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD), the first and regulating enzyme of the oxidative PPP, in a dose-dependent manner. With the highest dose (0.2 mg.kg-1.hr-1), there was also a time-dependent enhancement. The increase observed after 48 hours was attenuated partially by the beta-receptor blocker metoprolol and the alpha-receptor blocker prazosin. It was entirely abolished when both drugs were administered. Carvedilol, a beta-adrenergic blocker and vasodilator with alpha 1-blocking activity (0.5 mg.kg-1.hr-1), prevented the NE-induced increase in cardiac G-6-PD activity, in functional parameters (heart rate, left ventricular systolic pressure, and left ventricular dP/dtmax), and in the heart weight/body weight ratio. The alpha-adrenergic stimulator norfenephrine increased myocardial G-6-PD activity; prazosin prevented this stimulation. NE and norfenephrine also elevated the available pool of cardiac 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate. G-6-PD activity was enhanced in cardiac myocytes freshly isolated from the left ventricle of rats that had received NE infusion for 3 days (12.3 +/- 1.4 units/g protein) compared with control rats (1.5 +/- 0.4 units/g protein). The activity of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, one of the enzymes in the oxidative PPP, was elevated only moderately from 12.7 +/- 0.7 to 19.1 +/- 1.4 units/g protein. Combined alpha- and beta-receptor blockade with carvedilol attenuated these effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "Metabolic effects of pindolol and propranolol were investigated in a randomised study of double-blind, double-dummy design in 39 Caucasians with newly detected hypertension. Each active treatment period was 6 months long. A euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp test was done to measure insulin sensitivity, and i.v. glucose tolerance was investigated with insulin determinations. Lipoprotein concentrations were quantified and lipoprotein lipase activities were determined in muscle and adipose tissue and in plasma after heparin injection. The blood pressure was significantly reduced by both regimes. The insulin sensitivity index was decreased by 34% during propranolol treatment and by 17% during pindolol treatment. The insulin concentrations in plasma were elevated at the end of the i.v. glucose tolerance test but were not high enough to compensate for the insulin resistance, so HbA1c and glucose concentrations were increased. A significant reduction of lipoprotein lipase activity in skeletal muscle during propranolol treatment probably explains the pronounced increase in serum triglyceride concentration during propranolol treatment despite lower free fatty acids and higher lipoprotein lipase activity in adipose tissue. These changes of lipoprotein lipase activity were not correlated to the changes in insulin sensitivity. In summary, the metabolic effects were significantly less pronounced with pindolol than with propranolol, which probably can be ascribed to the agonistic effect of pindolol on beta 2 adrenoceptors.",

All patients were completely studied, including coronary angiography and endomyocardial biopsy to exclude ischemic heart disease and active myocarditis. Four pts (6%) did not tolerate the first test dosage of metoprolol and twenty-two patients were excluded from analysis because of inadequate follow-up or because they were enrolled in an international trial.

    "75": "The major focus of this paper is the characterization and quantification of rat cardiomyocyte, cell-surface beta-adrenergic receptors labelled with the hydrophilic radioligand [3H]CGP-12177. The ventricular cardiomyocytes used in these experiments have previously been extensively studied in our laboratory and confirmed to be functionally compatible with similar cells in vivo. Specific binding of [3H]CGP was stereospecific, saturable and of high affinity. Binding of [3H]CGP was also readily reversible, demonstrated appropriate drug specificity and positively correlated with increasing cell concentrations. The potency of the beta 1-antagonist atenolol was almost 100 times higher than that of the beta 2-antagonist ICI-118.551 in binding to the [3H]CGP binding site. This preparation appears ideal for the investigation of beta-adrenergic receptor regulation in heart cells. Indeed, our initial experiments show clearly that pharmacological concentrations of isoproterenol, and norepinephrine, can reduce (down-regulate) the number of specific [3H]CGP binding sites. This result is in agreement with many other reports on similar experiments in a variety of cell types. However, physiologically relevant concentrations of these two agonists (1-100 nM) do not induce down-regulation of the beta-adrenergic receptors in short-term (2 h) incubations. Nevertheless, the high-affinity receptors that we have described mediate a contractile response to isoproterenol in the nanomolar concentration range (EC50 = 3.6 +/- 0.3 nM). This is approximately 300 times lower than the concentration needed to produce down-regulation. Thus, our data indicate that short-term down-regulation of cardiomyocyte beta-adrenergic receptors can only be observed with high, pharmacological concentrations of isoproterenol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We induced mild pulmonary congestion by inflation of a balloon placed in the left atrium, and maintained the left atrial pressure (Pla) at 10 mmHg for 30 minutes with continuous monitoring of lung resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn). Furthermore, we determined the provocative concentration of ACh producing 100% increase in RL (PC100-ACh), before and during balloon inflation. In animals with propranolol pretreatment, but not in animals without propranolol pretreatment, mild pulmonary congestion caused slight increase in RL (N.S.) and significant decrease in Cdyn (p less than 0.01) and PC 100-ACh (p less than 0.01). Cutting of bilateral vagal nerves partially inhibited the decrease of PC100-ACh, but pretreatment with either phenoxybenzamine, indomethacin, AA-861 or OKY-046 had not effect. These results suggest that blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors and the vagal reflex, but not of alpha-adrenergic receptors or arachidonates, contributes to bronchial hyperresponsiveness during acute pulmonary congestion.", 
    "77": "Hypertension is a known risk factor in the genesis of coronary artery disease. However, the effect of pre-existing hypertension on the long-term mortality in patients with established coronary heart disease is not clear. The present cohort study analysed the influence of baseline mild to moderate treated hypertension in cases of known coronary heart disease with cardiac mortality as end point. Data from a cohort of 511 patients including 266 normotensives and 245 controlled hypertensives was analysed over a follow-up period of 9 to 11 years. The baseline data were identical regarding other major risk factors like age, gender, smoking, diabetes, cholesterol levels and congestive heart failure on univariate analysis. There were more cases of myocardial infarction in the normotensive group. The number of patients receiving beta-blockers or aspirin were similar in both groups. However, more patients in the hypertensive group received nifedipine. Actuarial analysis of survival showed that mortality was the same in both groups with an overall cardiac mortality of 65 (26.5%) in the hypertensive group and 86 (32.3%) in the normotensive group (P greater than 0.1). The survival curves also showed no significant difference in mortality at any point in time (logrank test = 2.37, P greater than 0.1). Analysis of mortality after adjusting for myocardial infarction at first presentation also showed no significant difference. These data indicate that in patients with coronary heart disease the presence of mild to moderate hypertension does not add to the risk of cardiac mortality.",

In the ACE group, despite a tendency towards improvement, glucose uptake during the euglycaemic insulin clamp procedure did not change significantly from the baseline value of 4.0(0.5-12.9) mg/kg/min, values at 6 and 12 months being 4.8(1.3-14.7) and 4.4(1.5-9.8) mg/kg/min, respectively: the corresponding values for the beta group were 4.2(1.1-15.3), 3.6(1.2-8.9) and 4.0(1.5-12.0) mg/kg/min. The 22Na efflux rate constant, both baseline and follow-up values, was similar in both groups, and unrelated to insulin sensitivity. Owing to the surprisingly great variation in peripheral glucose uptake, the subgroup with values below the median for the population as a whole (4.9 mg/kg/min) was evaluated separately: those switched to captopril treatment manifested a 60% improvement in glucose disposal at 6 months and persisting at 12 months, the respective values being 2.1(0.5-4.8) (baseline), 3.5(1.3-6.3) and 3.4(1.5-6.1) mg/kg/min, (P = 0.012). The body mass index (BMI) was not significantly affected. Values for BMI, peripheral insulin and triglycerides were higher in the subgroup with glucose disposal below the median than in the subgroup with values above the median. Correlation between BMI and glucose uptake was highly significant (r = -0.75, P = 0.0001). The present findings suggest that captopril may be a better alternative than beta-blockers for treating the highly insulin-resistant, glucose-intolerant patients, predominantly to be found among the overweight.",

Its potency on the airways of normal subjects was identical with that of placebo. A study was carried out to determine the potential of BPPA to cause bronchoconstriction in mild asthmatics (FEV1 greater than or equal to 60% predicted) with normal IOP. 2. Twelve nonsmoking outpatients who bronchoconstricted to 0.25 or 0.50% of timolol eye drops (fall in FEV1 23.33 +/- 1.20% (mean +/- s.e. mean), range 16-30) were investigated in this double-masked, randomized, 3-period, crossover study. On three different occasions six incremental concentrations of BPPA (range: 0.1-2%; maximum cumulative concentration 4%), timolol (0.1-1%; 2%), and placebo were administered bilaterally until bronchoconstriction (decrease in FEV1 greater than or equal to 20% and in specific airway conductance (sGaw) greater than or equal to 35% simultaneously) or the maximum cumulative concentration was reached. 3. Airway response was measured as change in FEV1 and sGaw and dose-response curves to timolol, BPPA and placebo were performed. IOP was measured 3 h after the highest concentration of each study day. 4. Timolol caused dose-dependent falls in FEV1 and sGaw as well as clinical symptoms of respiratory distress in all subjects. The median cumulative concentrations of timolol required to decrease FEV1 by 20% and sGaw by 35% were 0.98% and 1.53%. Neither placebo (P greater than 0.05) nor BPPA (P greater than 0.05) caused a significant change in sGaw.

    "84": "Gastric, intestinal and colonic absorption rates of a series of eleven beta-blockers (alprenolol hydrochloride, atenolol, bunolol hydrochloride, penbutolol sulphate, pronethalol hydrochloride, metoprolol, oxprenolol, bevantolol, bufuralol, propranolol hydrochloride and timolol maleate) were estimated using Doluisio's method. The gastric absorption rate was very low and the absorption rate constant could not be assessed accurately in all cases. In the small intestine, the absorption rate constants, Ka, at pH 6.2 ranged between 0.38 h-1 for atenolol and 4.28 h-1 for penbutolol. In the colon, the rate of drug absorption at pH 7.5 ranged between 0.12 h-1 for atenolol and 2.15 h-1 for penbutolol. In most cases, colonic absorption rate constants were of the same order as those obtained in the small intestine, demonstrating the good penetrability through colonic membrane of the series studied. The relationship between absorption rate constants found in the small intestine and colon and the partition constant ([1/Rf]-1), was studied for this non-homologous series of beta-blocker drugs. In both cases, the functional hyperbolic absorption model proposed by Wagner and Sedman [1973] was the most representative.", 
    "85": "Three doses of porcine brain natriuretic peptide (pBNP-32) were tested in regards to the extinction of active avoidance behavior following injection into the lateral brain ventricle in rats. This peptide delayed the extinction of the active avoidance reflex in a dose-dependent manner. To clarify the involvement of transmitters in the action of the peptide, the animals were pretreated with different receptor blockers in doses that did not affect the behavior of the animals in this learning paradigm. Dopaminergic, cholinergic, and alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers effectively blocked the delaying action of pBNP-32, whereas GABAergic, serotoninergic, and opiateergic blockers were ineffective. The data suggest that the delaying action of pBNP-32 on the extinction of active avoidance behavior is mediated via dopaminergic and alpha- and beta-adrenergic neuromediations.", 
    "86": "The first step in olfactory transduction is the recognition of odor molecules by membrane bound receptors belonging to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors; other members of this family are involved in neurotransmission. Based on the considerable homology between individual members of this family, we have investigated the ability of well-known neurotransmitter antagonists to block the olfactory response. Adrenergic and muscarinic antagonists were found to block some odor induced currents (45-55%) with an IC50 between 15 and 75 microM. By contrast, antagonists of glutamate and GABA receptors, which do not belong to this receptor superfamily, were ineffective. These results suggest that further pharmacological analysis may be useful for characterizing and classifying the family of odor receptors.", 
    "87": "The effects of ketanserin, a specific serotonin2-receptor agonist, and celiprolol, a new, highly cardioselective beta 1 blocker with partial beta 2 agonist activity and peripheral vasodilating properties, on left ventricular (LV) structure and function were assessed in 60 older hypertensive patients (greater than 55 years) with clinical LV hypertrophy (LV mass index greater than 130 g/m2). The patients were studied using echocardiography after 1 month of placebo treatment, and 6 and 18 months of monotherapy with active drug. Ketanserin and celiprolol lowered blood pressure to normal levels. Heart rate did not change with ketanserin and fell moderately (-5%) with celiprolol (p less than .001). Regression of LV hypertrophy was achieved with the use of either medication (p less than .0001), although the magnitude of reduction in LV mass was greater with celiprolol at both 6 months (-10% vs -5%, p = .001) and 18 months (-13% vs -7%, p = .002). While LV volume did not change with either drug, celiprolol tended to decrease it, resulting in a 5% reduction in cardiac index (p = .01), which was associated with mild bradycardia. Ketanserin did not change LV ejection fraction, whereas celiprolol caused a slight (1.5%) long-term improvement (p = .003). Systolic wall stress and total peripheral resistance decreased with both agents (p less than .01), with no between-group differences. In conclusion, anti-hypertensive treatment of older persons with ketanserin or celiprolol achieves regression of LV hypertrophy without associated deleterious effects on LV function.", 
    "88": "The effect of inhaled salmeterol xinafoate, a long acting beta 2 agonist, on exercise induced asthma was studied in a double blind, crossover, and placebo controlled trial. Thirteen asthmatic children with a fall of at least 15% in their forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) after a standard exercise test on a motorised treadmill, on separate days performed the same test 1, 5, and 9 hours after a single dose of 50 micrograms salmeterol or placebo. FEV1 was measured before treatment, and before and for 30 minutes after each exercise test. After placebo the number of children with exercise induced asthma was: 10 at 1 hour, 11 at 5 hours, and 12 at 9 hours. Salmeterol prevented exercise induced asthma in all 13 children studied, at 1, 5, and 9 hours. Mean maximum falls in FEV1 after exercise were at 1 hour: salmeterol 2.7% and placebo 24.6%, 5 hours: salmeterol 5.3% and placebo 22.7%; and 9 hours: salmeterol 3.4% and placebo 26.6%. After salmeterol the mean increase in FEV1 was 17.8% at 1 hour, 19.6% at 5 hours, and 19.2% at 9 hours. Inhaled salmeterol prevents exercise induced asthma and produces significant bronchodilatation for at least 9 hours.", 
    "89": "Mechanisms responsible for the positive inotropic effects of dopexamine were investigated in 8 halothane-anesthetized horses. The hemodynamic effects of increasing infusions of dopexamine (5, 10, 15 micrograms/kg of body weight/min) were determined before and after sequential administration of specific antagonists. Using glycopyrrolate and chlorisondamine, and atenolol and ICI 118,551, muscarinic and nicotinic ganglionic, and beta 1, and beta 2-adrenergic receptor blockade, respectively, was induced. Dopexamine infusions induced increase in heart rate, cardiac output, systolic and mean arterial blood pressure, and maximal rate of left ventricular pressure development (+dP/dtmax). Right atrial pressure and systemic vascular resistance decreased. Parasympathetic and ganglionic blockade attenuated cardiac output, systolic and mean aortic blood pressures, and +dP/dtmax responses to dopexamine infusion. Dopexamine-induced increase in heart rate was potentiated by parasympathetic and ganglionic blockade. beta 1-Adrenergic receptor blockade decreased heart rate, cardiac output, arterial blood pressure, and +dP/dtmax from baseline values and markedly reduced the response to dopexamine infusion. beta 2-Adrenergic receptor blockade induced further decrease in hemodynamic variables from baseline values and completely abolished the cardiostimulatory effects of dopexamine on +dP/dtmax. These data indicate that baroreflex activity, beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor stimulation may be an important cause of dopexamine's positive inotropic effects in horses.", 
    "90": "Regional left ventricular function associated with consecutive ischemic periods of 2, 2, 5, 10, and 2 min was recorded by ultrasonic technique in pentobarbital-anesthetized pigs. All systolic and diastolic derangements first appeared after 5 min of ischemia, and all worsened after 10 min of ischemia. Percent systolic segment length shortening reached nadirs 23 (17-29)% (P less than 0.001) and 54 (45-65)% (P less than 0.001) below baseline 30 min after 5 and 10 min of ischemia. During reperfusion all recorded systolic and diastolic variables transiently recovered and then deteriorated with a closely similar time course. This covariance indicates that systolic and diastolic derangements are causally related, and because diastolic compliance was preserved in stunned myocardium we conclude that all derangements largely result from reduced systolic tension development. Transient postischemic hypercontractility followed all occlusions and was not attenuated by beta-blockade and not mimicked by hyperemia alone. Postischemic hypercontractility was greatly enhanced in stunned myocardium, and we hypothesize that more pronounced and sustained postischemic elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration explains this observation.", 
    "91": "The effects of epanolol (a new selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist), diltiazem and placebo were compared in a group of 16 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. Each patient received each treatment in random order. Diltiazem reduced weekly angina attack rate from 7.2 (95% CI 3.9-10.5) to 3.9 (1.9-5.9) (P less than 0.01), whereas a lesser reduction was observed after epanolol. Both drugs produced a small but significant (P less than 0.05) increase in treadmill exercise time (placebo 474 s (374-574), epanolol 527 s (431-623) and diltiazem 554 s (462-646). However, aerobic work capacity, assessed by peak achieved oxygen consumption, was not different from the placebo value of 21.2 (18.0-24.4) ml.min-1.kg-1, and clearly subnormal when compared to age- and sex-matched controls (33.0 (30.1-35.9) ml.min-1.kg-1). Ventilatory abnormalities and increased lactate levels on active treatment were observed at peak exercise only. We conclude that the cardiodepressant effects of both active drugs limit blood supply to working skeletal muscle, and that chest pain may be replaced by dyspnoea or fatigue as the limiting factors to exercise.", 
    "92": "In patients with chronic heart failure cardiac beta-1 adrenoceptors are reduced, whereas beta-2 adrenoceptor changes vary depending on the etiology of the disease. Beta Adrenoceptor agonists can be used for short-term inotropic support in chronic heart failure; their clinical efficacy might depend on which beta adrenoceptor subtype(s) mediates their positive inotropic effect. Thus, the beta adrenoceptor subtype(s) involved in the positive inotropic effects of clinically used beta adrenoceptor agonists was characterized on isolated electrically driven human right atria by the use of the selective beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712 A (300 nmol/l) and/or the selective beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (30 nmol/l). Epinine evoked positive inotropic effects through stimulation of beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors to about the same degree, whereas dobutamine acted mainly at beta-1 adrenoceptors but had a significant beta-2 adrenoceptor component. Both agonists were full agonists causing the same maximum increase in contractile force (Emax) as did isoprenaline or Ca++ (Emax = 1.0). In contrast, denopamine was a partial selective beta-1 adrenoceptor agonist (Emax = 0.75-0.85). Dopamine was in the presence of uptake1-blockade (by 5 mumol/l phenoxybenzamine) a partial agonist (Emax = 0.60-0.70) acting selectively at beta-1 adrenoceptors; in the absence of uptake1-blockade, however, dopamine was a full agonist, indicating that part of its positive inotropic effect is indirect via the release of endogenous noradrenaline. Xamoterol did not exert positive inotropic effects, but concentration-dependently slightly decreased basal force of contraction.", 
    "93": "Beta blockade constitutes efficient therapy for stable angina pectoris. The effects of lowering blood pressure and heart rate with such treatment are not always desired. Epanolol is a beta 1-selective partial agonist with minor effects on blood pressure and heart rate at rest. Atenolol is a pure beta 1-selective antagonist with more pronounced effects on blood pressure and heart rate at rest. The effects of epanolol, 200 mg o.d., and atenolol, 100 mg o.d., were compared in 173 middle-aged patients with stable angina pectoris in a randomized, double-blind, parallel group-controlled study for one year. No significant differences were shown in angina attack rate, nitrate consumption, or exercise performance. Resting heart rate and blood pressure were significantly lower on atenolol. Epanolol tended to be better tolerated than atenolol, as shown by visual analogue scales of well-being, activity, energy, and warm extremities, further supported by fewer reports on possible adverse reactions. In conclusion, epanolol appears to be as effective as atenolol and better tolerated in patients with stable angina pectoris.", 
    "94": "Dexmedetomidine (DM) was studied in the isolated dog heart in the form of a Starling heart-lung preparation, (HLP). Hearts were subjected to increased loading by (a) increasing cardiac output, and (b) increasing systemic resistance. Results are depicted by cardiac function curves, prepared by plotting left atrial pressure against either systemic cardiac output or mean arterial pressure. DM, given in divided doses up to 44 micrograms, had no effect on heart rate or cardiac function, nor did injection of 0.5 mg of atipamezole, a selective alpha 2-antagonist. Additional injections of very large doses of DM, up to 4,444 micrograms, caused an increase in heart rate and a leftward shift of the function curves, ie, positive chronotropic and inotropic effects. Plasma catecholamine levels increased markedly between the 444 micrograms and the 4,444 micrograms cumulative doses of DM. Administration of 1 mg of prazosin had no effect, but 1 mg of propranolol returned the rate to baseline and markedly shifted function curves to the right and depressed their slopes. Thus, whereas low doses (corresponding to between 1 and 30 micrograms/kg in intact animals) of DM, given acutely IV, have been shown to depress cardiac function in intact and denervated dogs, this effect is not due to a direct effect on the myocardium. High doses, far beyond doses maximally effective in intact animals and man, release catecholamines from cardiac stores. Plasma DM levels after low doses in the HLP were between 1 to 10 times those seen in intact animals and human volunteers after the usual doses given clinically for their central effects. Because DM caused no myocardial depressant effect in the isolated, blood-perfused canine HLP, decreases in cardiac function seen after this drug is given to intact and autonomically denervated dogs must be due to factor(s) other than a direct action on the myocardium.", 
    "95": "The physiologic mechanism that underlies the epinephrine-induced increase in facility of outflow (C) in glaucomatous human eyes and normal primate eyes is not completely understood. In this study, a recently developed in vitro human eye perfusion model was used to simultaneously monitor facility and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) changes in response to epinephrine (EPI). In this system, EPI (2.5 x 10(-5) mol/l) resulted in a maximal 44% increase in C, with an ED50 occurring at approximately 8 x 10(-6) mol/l. The C-increasing effect of 10(-5) mol/l EPI was unaffected by 10(-6) mol/l phentolamine. However, it was completely blocked in the presence of 10(-6) mol/l timolol or 2 x 10(-7) mol/l ICI118,551, suggesting the involvement of beta-2 adrenergic receptors. In biochemical studies, 10(-5) mol/l EPI induced a 12- to 14-fold increase in cyclic AMP in the perfusate of treated eyes. This increase was blocked by ICI118,551. In isolated intact human trabecular tissue, a 10 min incubation with 10(-5) EPI stimulated cyclic AMP by a factor of 2.7 over control levels. After 90 min, cyclic AMP levels were increased 4.2 fold over control levels. Collectively, these results show that the intraocular pressure lowering effect of EPI in the human eye is mediated, at least in part, by an increase in facility of outflow. Furthermore, the facility increase appears to be mediated by beta-2 adrenergic receptors and is correlated in time with increased cyclic AMP production.", 
    "96": "A previous study found that the electrophysiological response to ischemia is altered in hypertrophic myocardium, resulting in prolonged transmural activation time (TAT) associated with induction of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.

    "97": "Anesthetized open-chest dogs underwent 3 hours of uninterrupted circumflex coronary occlusion. During atrial drive, TAT was recorded between endocardial and epicardial bipolar pairs on the same multipolar plunge needle placed in nonischemic and ischemic zones, documented by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. TAT and VT induced by up to three extrastimuli were studied during hypertension (control), during normotension produced most frequently by nitroprusside infusion (3-6 micrograms/kg/min), and during further hypertension most frequently produced by phenylephrine infusion (1-5 micrograms/kg/min). Twenty-five dogs with chronic hypertension and LVH (group 1) produced by a single-kidney renal clamp mechanism and 15 control dogs were studied. In the latter, neither intervention altered TAT, and no VT was inducible. In group 1, however, nitroprusside reversibly prolonged TAT within the ischemic zone (mean +/- SEM, 31 +/- 3 to 34 +/- 3 msec, p less than 0.005) and cycle length of induced VT (204 +/- 19 to 240 +/- 17 msec, p less than 0.01). Phenylephrine reversibly shortened both TAT in the ischemic zone (33 +/- 2 to 28 +/- 2 msec, p less than 0.05) and cycle length of VT (219 +/- 17 to 165 +/- 11 msec, p less than 0.025). Cycle length of VT and TAT were dissociated from blood pressure elevation in two dogs with LVH; when blood pressure was elevated by sympathetic nerve stimulation, cycle length of VT and TAT were prolonged. In 11 dogs with LVH (group 2), prolongation of TAT with nitroprusside infusion was prevented by intravenous metoprolol (1.0 mg/kg). Of 12 dogs with LVH and inducible VT (group 3), seven still had VT inducible after metoprolol, but the cycle length of VT was still prolonged with nitroprusside infusion.", 
    "98": "These results suggest that 1) TAT in acutely ischemic LVH was uniquely responsive to hemodynamic influences, an effect prevented by beta-blockade with metoprolol, and 2) the cycle length of VT was also uniquely regulated by hemodynamic influences but not blocked by metoprolol.",

The mean arterial blood pressure during the hypotensive period was 58.7 +/- 0.7 (mean +/- SEM) and 61.8 +/- 0.4 mm Hg for esmolol and SNP, respectively (P less than 0.001). In addition, 40% +/- 4% of the observed values in the esmolol group and 53% +/- 3% in the SNP group were outside the target range for mean arterial blood pressure (difference significant at P less than 0.05), and a greater proportion of the deviations were above 65 mm Hg in the SNP group than in the esmolol group (0.64 vs 0.46, respectively, P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "100": "The effects of exercise on regional myocardial blood flow and function were examined in the presence and absence of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in 10 adult conscious dogs with severe left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy induced by aortic banding in puppies, which increased the LV weight/body weight ratio by 87%. Exercise at the most intense level studied increased LV systolic (+87 +/- 8 mm Hg) and end-diastolic (+28 +/- 5 mm Hg) pressures, systolic (+85 +/- 12 g/cm2) and diastolic (+49 +/- 11 g/cm2) wall stresses, and subepicardial wall thickening (+0.18 +/- 0.05 mm) but reduced subendocardial wall thickening (-0.45 +/- 0.12 mm) and full wall thickening (-0.42 +/- 0.13 mm). This was associated with a fall in the subendocardial/subepicardial (endo/epi) blood flow ratio to 0.87 +/- 0.06 from 1.24 +/- 0.08. Subendocardial dysfunction persisted during recovery, at a time when transmural blood flow distribution returned to baseline, suggesting myocardial stunning. At the least intense level of exercise studied, the endo/epi blood flow ratio did not fall (1.27 +/- 0.14), but increases in heart rate (+73 +/- 8 beats per minute) and LV systolic (+35 +/- 8 g/cm2) and diastolic (+27 +/- 3 g/cm2) wall stresses were observed, and subendocardial wall thickening fell significantly (-0.21 +/- 0.08 mm, p less than 0.05). With anticipation of exercise, subendocardial wall thickening was not changed. However, subendocardial dysfunction was even evident after 10 beats, i.e., the first 3 seconds of exercise, at a time when LV pressures and stresses had not increased. After beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol, the most intense level of exercise was associated with lesser increases in systolic and diastolic LV wall stresses, heart rate, and LV dP/dt, and the endo/epi blood flow ratio was no longer reduced below unity (1.17 +/- 0.09). In addition, there were no decreases in subendocardial or full wall thickening, and myocardial stunning was no longer observed. Thus, the subendocardial hypoperfusion and depression in subendocardial wall thickening observed during exercise in dogs with LV hypertrophy was prevented by pretreatment with beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Furthermore, the subendocardial dysfunction occurred rapidly, before alterations in LV systolic or diastolic wall stress or an alteration in the endo/epi blood flow ratio.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

In the non-contracting soleus fibres there was a post-tetanic increase in mean resting potential (from -82.2 +/- 7.1 (S.D.) to -91.6 +/- 8.7 mV) which was similar to that in contracting fibres (from -83.02 +/- 6.1 to -91.3 +/- 7.3 mV). In both types of fibres the hyperpolarizing responses (HRs) were evidently due to increased sodium pump activity since they could be abolished by the addition of ouabain (1 x 10(-4) M) to the bathing fluid. 3. The beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, completely suppressed HRs in the non-contracting fibres and produced moderate reductions in the contracting ones. The alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, phentolamine, had no effect on the contracting fibres and only a modest, inhibitory, one on the non-contracting fibres. 4. On the basis of the above drug actions it appeared that catecholamines were necessary for the full development of HRs in contracting and non-contracting fibres; noradrenaline, released from intramuscular sympathetic nerve endings, may have been involved. 5. The increased sodium pump activity in the non-contracting fibres would serve to moderate the rise in interstitial [K+] caused by K+ efflux from the contracting fibres. By preventing passive depolarization, due to the rise in interstitial [K+], the sodium pump would also maintain the availability of non-contracting fibres for subsequent recruitment."
