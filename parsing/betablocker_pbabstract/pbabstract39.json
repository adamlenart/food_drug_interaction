In this work, a smart strategy that combines three-way liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data with second-order calibration method based on alternating trilinear decomposition (ATLD) algorithm was developed for simultaneous determination of ten \u03b2-blockers in human urine and plasma samples. This flexible strategy proved to be a useful tool to solve the problems of overlapped peaks and uncalibrated interferences encountered in quantitative LC-MS, and made the multi-targeted interference-free qualitative and quantitative analysis of \u03b2-blockers in complex matrices possible. The limits of detection were in the range of 2.0\u00d710(-5)-6.2\u00d710(-3) \u03bcg mL(-1), and the average recoveries were between 90 and 110% with standard deviations and average relative prediction errors less than 10%, indicating that the strategy could provide satisfactory prediction results for ten \u03b2-blockers in human urine and plasma samples only using liquid chromatography hyphenated single-quadrupole mass spectrometer in full scan mode. To further confirm the feasibility and reliability of the proposed method, the same batch samples were analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method. T-test demonstrated that there are no significant differences between the prediction results of the two methods. Considering the advantages of fast, low-cost, high sensitivity, and no need of complicated chromatographic and tandem mass spectrometric conditions optimization, the proposed strategy is expected to be extended as an attractive alternative method to quantify analyte(s) of interest in complex systems such as cells, biological fluids, food, environment, pharmaceuticals and other complex samples.",

CA was performed within 30 days after the first documented VT in 75 (25%) patients (group 1), between 1 month and 1 year in 84 (28%) patients (group 2), and >1 year after the first VT occurrence in 141 (47%) patients (group 3).

    "11": "Although ophthalmic timolol is generally well tolerated, a significant fraction of topically administered timolol can be systemically absorbed. We investigated the effect of the strong CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine on the pharmacokinetics of timolol after ophthalmic administration. In a four-phase crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers ingested either paroxetine (20 mg) or placebo daily for 3 days. In phases 1-2, timolol 0.1% gel, and in phases 3-4, timolol 0.5% drops were administered to both eyes. Paroxetine increased the plasma concentrations of timolol with both timolol formulations to a similar degree. The geometric mean ratio (95% confidence interval) of timolol peak concentration was 1.53-fold (1.23-1.91) with 0.1% timolol and 1.49-fold (0.94-2.36) with 0.5% timolol, and that of timolol area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to 12 hours was 1.61-fold (1.26- to 2.06-fold) and 1.78-fold (1.21-2.62), respectively. During paroxetine administration, six subjects on 0.5% timolol drops, but none on 0.1% timolol gel, had plasma timolol concentrations exceeding 0.7 ng/ml, which can cause systemic adverse effects in patients at risk. There was a positive correlation between the AUC from time 0 to 13 hours of paroxetine and the placebo phase AUC from time 0 to infinity of timolol after timolol 0.5% drops (P < 0.05), and a nonsignificant trend after timolol 0.1% gel, consistent with the role of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of both agents. In the orthostatic test, heart rate immediately after upright standing was significantly lower (P < 0.05) during the paroxetine phase than during the placebo phase at 1 and 3 hours after 0.5% timolol dosing. In conclusion, paroxetine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors can have a clinically important interaction with ophthalmic timolol, particularly when patients are using 0.5% timolol formulations.",

    "17": "Reactivity to a reward is affected by prior experience with different reinforcer values of that reward, a phenomenon known as incentive relativity. Incentive relativity can be studied via the consummatory successive negative contrast (cSNC) paradigm, in which acceptance of 4% sucrose is assessed in animals that had been exposed to 32% sucrose. These downshifted animals usually exhibit significantly less sucrose acceptance than animals that always received the 4% sucrose solution. In previous work, we found that exploration of a novel open field (OF) before the first trial with the downshifted solution attenuated the contrast effect. The goal of the present experiments was to expand the knowledge on the effects of OF exposure on cSNC. We evaluated the effect OF exposure before the second downshift trial and assessed the mediational role of the adrenergic system in the effects of OF during the first and second trial of cSNC. The results indicate that OF applied before the first or second downshift trials exert opposite effects and that the adrenergic system is involved in the acquisition and consolidation of the OF information.", 
    "18": "Considerable progress has been made over the last few decades in the management of clinically stable coronary heart disease (SCHD), including improvements in interventions (e.g., percutaneous revascularization), pharmacological management, and risk factor control (e.g., smoking, diet, activity level, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension). Although \u03b2 blockers have long been used for the treatment of SCHD, their efficacy was established in the era before widespread use of reperfusion interventions, modern medical therapy (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers), or preventive treatments (e.g., aspirin, statins). On the basis of these older data, \u03b2 blockers are assumed beneficial, and their use has been extrapolated beyond patients with heart failure and previous myocardial infarction, which provided the best evidence for efficacy. However, there are no randomized clinical trials demonstrating that \u03b2 blockers decrease clinical events in patients with SCHD in the modern era. Furthermore, these agents are associated with weight gain, problems with glycemic control, fatigue, and bronchospasm, underscoring the fact that their use is not without risk. In conclusion, data are currently lacking to support the widespread use of \u03b2 blockers for all SCHD patients, but contemporary data suggest that they be reserved for a well-defined high-risk group of patients with evidence of ongoing ischemia, left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, and perhaps some arrhythmias.", 
    "19": "There exist a number of mechanisms to clear xenobiotics from human circulation. For cationic drugs, clearance is performed by human organic cation transporters 1 and 2 (hOCT1 and hOCT2), which are expressed in the liver and kidney, respectively. Given the prevalence of patients taking cardiovascular drugs, the present review focuses on the elimination of circulating cardiovascular drugs by organic cation transporters (OCTs). A significant number of cardiovascular drugs compete for transport by OCT1 or OCT2, introducing the potential to alter the pharmacokinetic profile of other concomitantly administered medications. The OCT system thereby represents an important site of drug-drug interactions.",

Epinephrine increased the rate of agglutination, which attested to predominance of \u03b11-adrenoceptors. Propranolol enhanced the effect of epinephrine, while histidine and mildronate reduced it. Hence, endogenous modulators of adrenoceptors can modify adrenoreactivity of erythrocytes and probably other cells, and erythrocytes can serve as indicator of instant adrenoreactivity of body cells.",

Structural and chemical differences have been identified within these classes, especially among the calcium channel blockers and, to a lesser extent, among the thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics. However, it has been more difficult to demonstrate that these differences translate into differential effects with respect to either the surrogate endpoint of blood pressure reduction or, more importantly, hypertension-related cardiovascular complications.

The gastrointestinal simulator (GIS), a multicompartment in vitro dissolution apparatus, was developed to evaluate in vivo drug dissolution. A gastric-emptying rate along with transit rate are key factors to evaluate in vivo drug dissolution and, hence, drug absorption. Dissolution tests with the GIS were performed with Biopharmaceutical Classification System class I drugs at five different gastric-emptying rates in the fasted state. Computational models were used to determine in vivo gastric-emptying time for propranolol and metoprolol based on the GIS dissolution results. Those were compared with published clinical data to determine the gastric half-emptying time. In conclusion, the GIS is a practical tool to assess dissolution properties and can improve IVIVC.",

    "55": "Thyroiditis is a general term that encompasses several clinical disorders characterized by inflammation of the thyroid gland. The most common is Hashimoto thyroiditis; patients typically present with a nontender goiter, hypothyroidism, and an elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody level. Treatment with levothyroxine ameliorates the hypothyroidism and may reduce goiter size. Postpartum thyroiditis is transient or persistent thyroid dysfunction that occurs within one year of childbirth, miscarriage, or medical abortion. Release of preformed thyroid hormone into the bloodstream may result in hyperthyroidism. This may be followed by transient or permanent hypothyroidism as a result of depletion of thyroid hormone stores and destruction of thyroid hormone-producing cells. Patients should be monitored for changes in thyroid function. Beta blockers can treat symptoms in the initial hyperthyroid phase; in the subsequent hypothyroid phase, levothyroxine should be considered in women with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 mIU per L, or in women with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 4 to 10 mIU per L who are symptomatic or desire fertility. Subacute thyroiditis is a transient thyrotoxic state characterized by anterior neck pain, suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone, and low radioactive iodine uptake on thyroid scanning. Many cases of subacute thyroiditis follow an upper respiratory viral illness, which is thought to trigger an inflammatory destruction of thyroid follicles. In most cases, the thyroid gland spontaneously resumes normal thyroid hormone production after several months. Treatment with high-dose acetylsalicylic acid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is directed toward relief of thyroid pain.",

The study group was divided into 3 groups: cirrhotic, noncirrhotic, and control. Then, the CCMP group was created according to the diagnostic criteria. Latent CCMP was diagnosed in the presence of prolonged-QTc along with a minor criterion (tachycardia). Manifest CCMP was diagnosed in the presence of at least 2 major criteria (prolonged-QTc along with abnormal echocardiographic findings). Moreover, in this study, the risk factors for CCMP were investigated.",

None of the patients with CCMP had severe cardiac symptoms, but they were already using some cardioprotective drugs such as propanolol and spironolactone. As risk factors for CCMP, pediatric end-stage liver disease scores, Child-Pugh scores, and ascites grades were found to be significant for the determination of CCMP. The most important risk factor was ascites severity (P\u200a=\u200a0.001, odds ratio 9.4).",

C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a control (CON), high calorie (HIGH) or low calorie (LOW) diet for 12 weeks. In each group, mice were treated with vehicle (VEH) or propranolol. The number of adipocytes per area bone marrow was increased in LOWVEH and HIGHVEH mice compared with CONVEH mice, which was attenuated by propranolol. Isoproterenol increased lipid droplet accumulation and adipogenic marker gene expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and mouse BMSCs, which were blocked by propranolol. Conditioned medium obtained from MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts suppressed adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, which was significantly attenuated by treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with isoproterenol.

In the present study, we investigated the potential renoprotective effect and underlying mechanisms of carvedilol, a non-specific \u03b2-adrenergic blocker using rat model of potassium dichromate-induced nephrotoxicity. Rats were pretreated with carvedilol (10mg/kg) for 21days. A single subcutaneous injection of potassium dichromate (15mg/kg, s.c.) resulted in a significant increase in the levels of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, markers related to oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, apoptosis and inflammation accompanied with histopathological changes in kidney tissues. Exploration of the underlying renoprotective mechanisms of carvedilol revealed that carvedilol attenuated nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB (p65) in kidney tissues. The serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 and the renal expression of iNOS and tissue nitrites were significantly decreased in carvedilol plus potassium dichromate administered rats. Carvedilol pretreatment significantly attenuated the potassium dichromate-induced DNA damage, decreased the p53, Bax and cleaved caspase-3 expression and increased the Bcl-2 expression. Moreover, pretreatment with carvedilol significantly restored the renal tissue antioxidant and mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities and decreased the elevated lipid peroxidation biomarkers to normal. These results were further supported and confirmed by histopathological findings. In conclusion, the findings of the present study demonstrated that carvedilol is an effective chemoprotectant against potassium dichromate-induced nephrotoxicity in rats.",

Our knowledge has advanced greatly in the last one hundred years. There are, however, certain empirical phenomena that may lead us to question the wisdom of our prevailing treatment algorithm. Three extreme but iatrogenically possible haemodynamic states exist. Firstly, inappropriately low venous return; secondly, overzealous arteriolar constriction; and finally, misguided inotropy and chronotropy. Following an unsuccessful fluid challenge, it would be logical to first set the venous tone, then set the cardiac rate and contractility, and finally set the peripheral vascular resistance. It is hypothesized that a combination of dihydroergotamine, milrinone and esmolol should be superior to a combination of noradrenaline and dobutamine for surviving sepsis.", 
    "81": "Limited evidence is available on the extent and frequency by which antihypertensive treatment lowers office blood pressure (BP) in white-coat hypertension (WCH). Data are even more scanty and discrepant on the corresponding effect on ambulatory BP (ABP). In the hypertensive patients of the European Lacidipine Study on Atherosclerosis (ELSA), office and ABP were measured before treatment and at 6-month (office BP) or 12-month (ABP) intervals during the 4-year administration of calcium channel blocker-based or \u03b2-blocker-based treatment. The two groups were pooled and data were analyzed separately in patients with both office and ABP elevation (n=1670; sustained hypertension) or WCH (n=251; office BP elevation only). In sustained hypertension, office and 24-hour mean systolic BP were both markedly reduced through the treatment period, the mean change being -20.0\u00b112.5 and -10.1\u00b111.0 mm Hg, respectively (P<0.0001 for both). In striking contrast, in WCH the office BP reduction was almost as marked as in sustained hypertension (-19.1\u00b111.2 mm Hg; P<0.0001), whereas 24-hour systolic BP values showed no fall or a slight progressive significant increase, its mean change during treatment being 1.6\u00b18.6 mm Hg (P=0.007). Lowering of office BP occurred at a lower treatment intensity in WCH than in sustained hypertension. Similar findings were obtained for diastolic BP. In WCH, antihypertensive treatment should not be expected to have a lowering effect on ABP, even when office BP undergoes a concomitant marked and persistent reduction. The consequence of this contrasting effect on the incidence of hypertension-related outcomes remains to be established.",

Whether \u03b2-ARs contribute to impaired coronary vasodilation seen with healthy aging is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of \u03b2-ARs in coronary exercise hyperemia in healthy humans. Six young men (26 \u00b1 1 yr) and seven older men (67 \u00b1 4 yr) performed isometric handgrip exercise at 30% maximal voluntary contraction for 2 min after receiving intravenous propranolol, a \u03b2-AR antagonist, and no treatment. Isoproterenol, a \u03b2-AR agonist, was infused to confirm the \u03b2-AR blockade. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored continuously, and coronary blood flow velocity (CBV, left anterior descending artery) was measured by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography. Older men had an attenuated \u0394CBV to isometric exercise (3.8 \u00b1 1.3 vs. 9.7 \u00b1 2.1 cm/s, P = 0.02) compared with young men.

Furthermore, testosterone-induced aromatase phosphotyrosine levels increased at 10 min, 30 min and 1 h, whereas 1,25D3 increased the longevity of the testosterone effect to 6 h and 24 h. Within 18-24 h of treatment, 1,25D3 markedly enhanced testosterone-induced 17beta-estradiol secretion. Additionally, pre-treatment with a calcium channel blocker nifedipine or an intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM reduced 1,25D3 and testosterone-induced 17beta-estradiol secretion. Groups that underwent testosterone treatment exhibited significantly increased estradiol receptor beta expression levels, which were not affected by 1,25D3. Neither testosterone nor 1,25D3 altered 1,25D3 receptor expression.

    "96": "Endothelial dysfunction is a critical initiator for developing diabetic vascular complications. Substantial clinical and experimental evidence suggests that aldosterone plays a crucial role in its pathogenesis. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blocker, spironolactone, on diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction and address the underlying mechanism(s) involved in this setting. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) to rats and spironolactone was orally administered (50\u00a0mg/kg/day). Our results showed a marked increase in aortic malondialdehyde (MDA) level and upregulation of the catalytic NADPH oxidase subunit, NOX2 gene expression alongside reducing catalase enzyme capacity, and the serum nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability in diabetic rats. This was associated with a significant reduction in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) immunoreactivity and gene expression in diabetic aorta. The transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) protein and the MR gene expression levels were significantly increased in the diabetic rat aorta. Moreover, the diabetic aorta showed a marked impairment in acetylcholine-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation. Additionally, spironolactone significantly inhibited the elevated MDA, TGF-\u03b2, NOX2, and MR levels alongside correcting the dysregulated eNOS expression and the defective antioxidant function as well as NO bioavailability. Spironolactone markedly reversed the impaired endothelial function in the diabetic aorta. Collectively, our study demonstrates that spironolactone ameliorated the vascular dysfunction of diabetic aorta, at least partially via its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects alongside correcting the dysregulated eNOS and TGF-\u03b2 expression. Thus, blockade of MR may represent a useful therapeutic approach against diabetic vasculopathy.", 
    "97": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by poorly reversible airflow limitation, with an abnormal pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response to tobacco smoking. Systemic inflammation promotes atherosclerosis, to treat the complications of which beta-blockers are paramount. In the COPD setting, however, the use of beta-blockers has been limited by fears that they could adversely affect lung function. However, by controlling adrenergic drive and reducing the heart rate, beta-blockers could reduce the risk of arrhythmias and sudden death among COPD patients. Thus, beta-blocker use is strongly supported by evidence in COPD patients with history of myocardial infarction, but warrants consideration in other cardiovascular comorbidities. Studies specifically designed to ascertain the role of beta-blockers in patients with COPD with cardiovascular conditions are still needed, because the majority of the current evidence is based on retrospective observational studies.",

We then provided experimental evidence of crystallin aggregation and its induction by timolol using different spectroscopic measurements. Turbidimetric measurements as well as ThT fluorescence data indicated that timolol induce extent of crystallin amyloid formation. The kinetic of protein aggregation was also changed in presence of increasing concentrations of the drug suggesting that long-term drug administration may contribute to the development of cataract.

Enantiomeric separation of the four \u03b2-blockers was a result of more than one type of interaction between solutes and CSP. Besides hydrogen bonding, there was another type interaction that was independent of solvent polarity and responsible for enantiomeric selectivity, such as - interactions. Both the groups close to the chiral centers and the substituent groups on the phenyl rings, which were far away from the chiral centers, could contribute to the good separation. The separations of the four \u03b2-blocker enantiomers were all enthalpy driven process.

The lowest test concentration (4\u00d710(-9) M) was chosen to reflect an environmentally relevant exposure situation. Furthermore concentration dependent effects were investigated. Therefore a series of concentrations higher than the environmentally relevant range were used (10- and 100-fold). Diclofenac significantly induced all chosen biomarkers already at the environmentally relevant concentration indicating that biotransformation and elimination occur via the pathways under investigation. Estrogenic potential of this substance was demonstrated by VTG up-regulation as well. Metoprolol was either less effective than diclofenac or metabolized using different pathways. Key enzymes of the xenobiotic metabolism were less (CYP1A, GST) or not (MDRP) induced and a mild increase in vtg mRNA was detected only for 4\u00d710(-8) M.

    "107": "Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are triggers of cardiac arrhythmia driven by L-type Ca(2+) current (ICaL) reactivation or sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange. In large mammals the positive action potential plateau promotes ICaL reactivation, and the current paradigm holds that cardiac EAD dynamics are dominated by interaction between ICaL and the repolarizing K(+) currents. However, EADs are also frequent in the rapidly repolarizing mouse action potential, which should not readily permit ICaL reactivation. This suggests that murine EADs exhibit unique dynamics, which are key for interpreting arrhythmia mechanisms in this ubiquitous model organism. We investigated these dynamics in myocytes from arrhythmia-susceptible calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta C (CaMKII\u03b4C)-overexpressing mice (Tg), and via computational simulations.",

These EADs were abolished by caffeine and tetrodotoxin (but not ranolazine), suggesting that sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release and Na(+) current (INa), but not late INa, are required for EAD initiation. Simulations suggest that potentiated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange shape late action potential repolarization to favor nonequilibrium reactivation of INa and thereby drive the EAD upstroke. Action potential clamp experiments suggest that lidocaine eliminates virtually all inward current elicited by EADs, and that this effect occurs at concentrations (40-60 \u03bcmol/L) for which lidocaine remains specific for inactivated Na(+) channels. This strongly suggests that previously inactive channels are recruited during the EAD upstroke, and that nonequilibrium INa dynamics underlie murine EADs.",

There is a paucity of data on the long-term sequelae of persistent hypertension in children, but it is known that children with hypertension have evidence of end organ damage and are at risk of hypertension into adulthood. The prevalence of hypertension in children is rising, most likely due to a concurrent rise in obesity rates. In children with hypertension, non-pharmacological measures are often recommended as first-line therapy, but a significant proportion of children will eventually require pharmacological treatment to reduce blood pressure, especially those with evidence of end organ damage at presentation or during follow-up.

KCNQ/Kv7 channels are closely associated with memory and the KCNQ/Kv7 channel activator flupirtine represents neuroprotective effects. This study aims to test whether KCNQ/Kv7 channel activation prevents acute stress-induced impairments of spatial memory retrieval and hippocampal LTP. Rats were placed on an elevated platform in the middle of a bright room for 30 min to evoke acute stress. The expression of KCNQ/Kv7 subunits was analyzed at 1, 3 and 12 h after stress by Western blotting. Spatial memory was examined by the Morris water maze (MWM) and the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in the hippocampal CA1 area was recorded in vivo. Acute stress transiently decreased the expression of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 in the hippocampus. Acute stress impaired the spatial memory retrieval and hippocampal LTP, the KCNQ/Kv7 channel activator flupirtine prevented the impairments, and the protective effects of flupirtine were blocked by XE-991 (10,10-bis(4-Pyridinylmethyl)-9(10H)-anthracenone), a selective KCNQ channel blocker. Furthermore, acute stress decreased the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) at Ser9 in the hippocampus, and flupirtine inhibited the reduction. These results suggest that the KCNQ/Kv7 channels may be a potential target for protecting both hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial memory retrieval from acute stress influences.",

Here, we show the osteogenic potential of CAFG as an alternative for anabolic therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis by stimulating bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin mechanism. CAFG supplementation improved trabecular micro-architecture of the long bones, increased biomechanical strength parameters of the vertebra and femur and decreased bone turnover markers better than genistein. Oral administration of CAFG to osteopenic ovariectomized mice increased osteoprogenitor cells in the bone marrow and increased the expression of osteogenic genes in femur and show new bone formation without uterine hyperplasia. CAFG increased mRNA expression of osteoprotegerin in bone and inhibited osteoclast activation by inhibiting the expression of skeletal osteoclastogenic genes. CAFG is also an effective accelerant for chondrogenesis and has stimulatory effect on the repair of cortical bone after drill-hole injury at the tissue, cell and gene level in mouse femur. At cellular levels, CAFG stimulated osteoblast proliferation, survival and differentiation. Signal transduction inhibitors in osteoblast demonstrated involvement of p-38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway stimulated by BMP2 to initiate Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling to reduce phosphorylation of GSK3-\u03b2 and subsequent nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin. Osteogenic effects were abrogated by Dkk1, Wnt-receptor blocker and FH535, inhibitor of TCF-complex by reduction in \u03b2-catenin levels. CAFG modulated MSC responsiveness to BMP2, which promoted osteoblast differentiation via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin mechanism. CAFG at 1\u2009mg/kg(/)day dose in ovariectomy mice (human dose \u223c0.081\u2009mg/kg) led to enhanced bone formation, reduced bone resorption and bone turnover better than well-known phytoestrogen genistein.

    "130": "Heart attack (myocardial infarction) is a highly prevalent entity worldwide. Widespread implementation of reperfusion strategies has dramatically reduced the mortality associated with infarction. Paradoxically, the mortality reduction has significantly increased the incidence of chronic heart failure (HF). Treatment of HF, once present, represents a huge socioeconomic burden on individuals and healthcare systems. The possibility of preventing rather than treating post-infarction HF would be of paramount importance. Given that infarct size is the main determinant of adverse post-infarction outcomes (including chronic HF), therapies able to reduce infarct size are needed. The single administration of intravenous metoprolol before reperfusion has been recently shown to reduce infarct size and reduce the cases of chronic HF in a proof-of-concept trial. If confirmed in larger trials, this low-cost therapy is expected to have a major health and socioeconomic impact.",

The antioxidant ascorbic acid is known to improve function in the diabetic rat heart. We tested whether a combination of ascorbic acid and metoprolol treatment would improve function further than each drug individually. Control and streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar rats were treated with metoprolol (15 mg\u00b7(kg body mass)(-1)\u00b7day(-1), via an osmotic pump) and (or) ascorbic acid (1000 mg\u00b7(kg body mass)(-1)\u00b7day(-1), via their drinking water). To study the effect of treatment on the development of dysfunction, we examined time points before (5 weeks diabetic) and after (7 weeks diabetic) development of overt systolic dysfunction. Echocardiography and working-heart-perfusion were used to assess cardiac function. Blood and tissue samples were collected to assess the severity of disease and oxidative stress. While both drugs improved function, only ascorbic acid had effects on oxidative damage. Combination treatment had a more pronounced improvement in function. Our \u03b2-blocker + antioxidant treatment strategy focused on oxidative stress, not diabetes specifically; therefore, it may prove useful in other diseases where oxidative stress contributes to the pathology.", 
    "132": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, which is composed of four members encoded by distinct genes (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4). The genes undergo transactivation or transrepression under specific mechanisms that lead to the induction or repression of target gene expression. As is the case with other nuclear receptors, all four PPAR isoforms contain five or six structural regions in four functional domains; namely, A/B, C, D, and E/F. PPARs have many functions, particularly functions involving control of vascular tone, inflammation, and energy homeostasis, and are, therefore, important targets for hypertension, obesity, obesity-induced inflammation, and metabolic syndrome in general. Hence, PPARs also represent drug targets, and PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 agonists are used clinically in the treatment of dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively. Because of their pleiotropic effects, they have been identified as active in a number of diseases and are targets for the development of a broad range of therapies for a variety of diseases. It is likely that the range of PPAR\u03b3 agonist therapeutic actions will result in novel approaches to lifestyle and other diseases. The combination of PPARs with reagents or with other cardiovascular drugs, such as diuretics and angiotensin II receptor blockers, should be studied. This article provides a review of PPAR isoform characteristics, a discussion of progress in our understanding of the biological actions of PPARs, and a summary of PPAR agonist development for patient management. We also include a summary of the experimental and clinical evidence obtained from animal studies and clinical trials conducted to evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of PPAR agonists in the treatment of lifestyle-related diseases.",

The scaffolding protein A-kinase anchoring protein 79/150 (AKAP5) is a key regulator of myocardial signalling by \u03b2-ARs. We examined the function of AKAP5 in regulating cardiac haemodynamics and size, and the role of \u03b2-ARs and Ca(2+)-regulated intracellular signalling pathways in this phenomenon.",

AKAP5(-/-) mice exhibited enhanced signs of cardiac dilatation and dysfunction that progressed with age. Infusions of isoprenaline worsened cardiac haemodynamics in wild-type (WT) mice only, but increased the ratio of heart-to-body weight equally in WT and in AKAP5(-/-) mice. Mechanistically, loss of AKAP5 was associated with enhanced activity of cardiac calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) and calcineurin (CaN) as indexed by nuclear factor of activated T-cell-luciferase activity. Loss of AKAP5 interfered with the recycling of cardiac \u03b21-ARs, which was mediated in part by CaN binding to AKAP5. Carvedilol reversed cardiac hypertrophy and haemodynamic deficiencies in AKAP5(-/-) mice by normalizing the activities of cardiac CaN and CaMKII.",

Retrospective design consisted of 114 patients (mean age 66) undergoing elective total knee arthroplasty, including 84 patients with chronic hypertension, and they were divided as group I (n = 37), ACEI/ARB continued; group II (n = 23), ACEI/ARB withdrawn; group III (n = 24), \u03b2-blocker/calcium channel blocker continued; and group IV (n = 30), without hypertension (control). Primary end points are systolic blood pressures (SBPs) and mean arterial blood pressures (MAPs) at 0, 30, 60, and 90 minutes postinduction, incidence of hypotension (SBP <85 mm Hg), and ephedrine requirements. Repeated measurements were analyzed using generalized estimating equations controlling for baseline characteristics and accounting for correlations. Logistic regression was used for remaining variables. Hypotension occurred more frequently (P = .02) in group I (30%) versus groups II-IV (9%, 13%, 3%). Ephedrine use was increased (P < .001) in group I (51%) compared with groups II-IV (26%, 17%, 7%). Group I had lower mean SBPs compared with group II (110 vs. 120; P = .0045) and group IV (110 vs. 119; P = .0013). Lower mean MAPs were found in group I versus group II (74 vs. 81, P = .001) and group IV (74 vs. 80; P = .001). Group I had an increased odds of receiving ephedrine versus group IV (odds ratio, 16.27; 95% confidence interval, 3.10-85.41; P = .001). No adverse clinical events were recorded.

During this time, some novel chiral selectors were reported and applied to improve the enantioseparation of \u03b2-blocker drugs and structurally related compounds. These chiral selectors include CDs and their derivatives, macrocyclic antibiotics, tartrate complexs, the monolithic molecularly imprinted polymer, and the polymeric surfactants. In addition, this article summarizes the methodological improvements for enhancing sensitivity in chiral analysis of \u03b2-blockers and structurally related compounds by CE.

Recently, Angiotensin II type I receptor blockers such as candesartan have attracted attention for their potential anti-fibrotic activity. We examined whether candesartan could attenuate tumor proliferation and fibrosis through the interaction between gastric cancer cell line (MKN45) cells and human peritoneal mesothelial cells. Candesartan significantly reduced TGF-\u03b21 expression and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-like change, while tumor proliferation and stromal fibrosis were impaired. Targeting the Angiotensin II signaling pathway may therefore be an efficient strategy for treatment of tumor proliferation and fibrosis.", 
    "158": "Cocaine abuse is associated with cardiovascular complications that include chest pain and myocardial infarction. Traditional therapy for these conditions includes a \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist. However, guidelines released in 2008 recommended against this treatment option because of the prevailing theory that cocaine will potentiate vasospasm secondary to unopposed \u03b1-adrenergic effects. Subsequently, further evidence and updated guidelines have become available, debunking this claim. Current literature is limited but suggests that \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists are harmful. Although case reports support a detrimental effect of \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists, the anecdotal data are inconsistent, and the conclusions from case studies are overruled by larger studies. The pharmacology, pathophysiology, and literature on the use of \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists in association with cocaine are reviewed. Future studies that focus on outcomes and different pharmacologic profiles of \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists are needed.",

Studying the efficacy of potential interventions in clinical populations is challenging, creating a need for paradigms within which candidate reconsolidation-blocking interventions can be readily tested. We used videos of biologically prepared conditioned stimuli (tarantulas) to test the efficacy of propranolol in blocking reconsolidation of conditioned fear in healthy young adults. Strong differential conditioning, measured by skin conductance, was observed among a screened subset of participants during acquisition. However, subsequent propranolol failed to reduce reactivity to the reactivated conditioned stimulus. These results are consistent with other recent findings and point to a need for testing other candidate drugs.", 
    "160": "We hypothesized that chronic inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) delays the progression of hypertension and attenuates cardiac hypertrophy by up-regulating anti-inflammatory cytokines, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs), decreasing nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) p65 and NAD(P)H oxidase activities, as well as restoring the neurotransmitters balance in the PVN of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Adult normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and SHR rats received bilateral PVN infusion of a TNF-\u03b1 blocker (pentoxifylline or etanercept) or vehicle for 4weeks. SHR rats showed higher mean arterial pressure and cardiac hypertrophy compared with WKY rats, as indicated by increased whole heart weight/body weight ratio, whole heart weight/tibia length ratio, left ventricular weight/tibia length ratio, and cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and beta-myosin heavy chain (\u03b2-MHC) mRNA expressions. Compared with WKY rats, SHR rats had higher PVN levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, PICs, the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), NF-\u03baB p65 activity, mRNA expressions of NOX-2 and NOX-4, and lower PVN levels of IL-10 and 67-kDa isoform of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD67), and higher plasma norepinephrine. PVN infusion of pentoxifylline or etanercept attenuated all these changes in SHR rats. These findings suggest that SHR rats have an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, as well as an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the PVN; and chronic inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 in the PVN delays the progression of hypertension by restoring the balances of neurotransmitters and cytokines in the PVN, and attenuating PVN NF-\u03baB p65 activity and oxidative stress, thereby attenuating hypertension-induced sympathetic hyperactivity and cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "161": "Recent studies have identified that high glucose-induced renal tubular cell damage. We previously demonstrated that high glucose treatment induced oxidative stress in human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs), and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers reduce high glucose-induced oxidative stress in RPTEC possibly via blockade of intracellular as well as extracellular AT1 receptor. However, exact roles of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and AT1 receptor on high glucose-induced renal tubular function remain unclear. N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG), concentrations of TNF-\u03b1/angiotensin II and p22(phox) protein levels after high glucose treatment with or without AT1 receptor blocker or thalidomide, an inhibitor of TNF-\u03b1 protein synthesis, were measured in immortalized human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK2 cells). AT1 receptor knockdown was performed with AT1 receptor small interfering RNA (siRNA). High glucose treatment (30\u2009mM) significantly increased NAG release, TNF-\u03b1/angiotensin II concentrations in cell media and p22(phox) protein levels compared with those in regular glucose medium (5.6\u2009mM). Candesartan, an AT1R blocker, showed a significant reduction on high glucose-induced NAG release, TNF-\u03b1 concentrations and p22(phox) protein levels in HK2 cells. In addition, significant decreases of NAG release, TNF-\u03b1 concentrations and p22(phox) protein levels in HK2 cells were observed in high glucose-treated group with thalidomide. AT1R knockdown with siRNA markedly reversed high glucose, angiotensin II or TNF-\u03b1-induced p22(phox) protein levels in HK2 cells. TNF-\u03b1 may be involved in high glucose-induced renal tubular damage in HK2 cells possibly via AT1 receptor signaling.", 
    "162": "Serotonin (5-HT) has been shown to participate in prolactin secretion through a complex process resulting in both positive and negative effects. Estrogen has also been recognized as being involved in this serotonergic effect on prolactin release. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess whether estradiol modulates serotonergic involvement in prolactin secretion though 5-HT1A and/or 5-HT2A/2C receptors. Ovariectomized female Wistar rats, treated for 2 weeks with estrogen to induce a hyperprolactinemic status (hyperestrogenic rats) or with sunflower oil vehicle (hypoestrogenic rats), were injected daily with normal saline solution or 6-chloro-2-(1-piperazinyl)pyrazine (MK-212), an 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist, for 4 days. Other groups of ovariectomized animals received 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) or pindolol, an agonist and antagonist of the 5-HT1A receptor respectively, on the last day of treatment with estrogen or vehicle. Prolactin levels were compared among groups in each experiment under the distinct drug treatments. MK-212 was found to increase prolactin concentrations both in hyper- and hypoestrogenic females compared to controls (p<0.05). In contrast, prolactin levels remained similar to those of controls both in hyperestrogenic animals treated with 8-OH-DPAT and pindolol and in hypoestrogenic rats administered the same treatments. In conclusion, our findings indicate the involvement of 5-HT2A/2C receptors on prolactin release through serotonergic pathways in female animals, especially in hyperestrogenic states.",

Thirty-one patients with IHs were administered propranolol and were assessed by ultrasound before treatment, 3 mo after treatment and at the end of treatment. Longitudinal and transverse diameters, as well as thickness of hemangiomas measured by clinical observation differed significantly (p < 0.05) from measurements obtained by ultrasound. Ultrasound also revealed that longitudinal and transverse diameters, thickness, vascular density, blood flow velocity (arterial and venous) and arterial peak systolic blood flow velocity of hemangiomas were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) after treatment compared with before treatment. The resistive index and systolic/diastolic blood flow velocity in IHs were significantly higher (p < 0.05) after treatment than before treatment. In conclusion, ultrasound can evaluate the efficacy of propranolol at the termination of therapy.",

In this study, we aim to investigate the effects of \u03b23-adrenoceptor activation on the interactions of adrenoceptors and angiotensin II receptors in aged apolipoprotein E gene knockout (ApoE(-/-)) mouse lung. Ten wild type C57BL/6J mice were included as normal control, 40 ApoE(-/-) mice were randomly divided into hyperlipidemia model (saline), low dose and high dose \u03b23-adrenoceptor agonist and \u03b23-adrenoceptor antagonist groups. After 26 weeks of high-fat diet, treatments were given for 12 weeks. Total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were examined by an automatic biochemical analyzer. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot were used to analyze the mRNA and protein expression of \u03b11A-, \u03b11B-, \u03b12A-, \u03b21-, \u03b22-, \u03b23-adrenoceptors and angiotensin II type 1 and type 2 receptors in lung. We found that \u03b23-adrenoceptor agonist could decrease TG, TC and LDL-C in aged ApoE(-/-) mice (P<0.01) and down-regulate the expressions of \u03b11A-, \u03b12A-adrenoceptors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor which were significantly increased in model mice (P<0.01, P<0.05). Compared with model mice, \u03b11B-, \u03b21-, \u03b22-, \u03b23-adrenoceptors and angiotensin II type 2 receptor expressions were increased in \u03b23-adrenoceptor agonist-treat mice (P<0.01, P<0.05). These findings suggest that the expressions of adrenoceptors and angiotensin II receptors in lung are regulated towards adverse directions after taking \u03b23-adrenoceptor agonist, which shows there are interactions between \u03b23-adrenoceptor and other adrenoceptor subtypes and angiotensin II receptors. These interactions may play a protective role in lung under condition of hyperlipidemia.",

The capsule is assembled using a semi-permeable capsule shell with contents including nanosuspension drying powder, mannitol and Plasdone S-630. The physical characteristics of semi-permeable capsule walls were compared among different coating solutions under different temperature. The composition of the coating solution and drying temperature appeared to be important for the formation of the shells. Carvedilol nanosuspension was prepared by precipitation-ultrasonication technique and was further lyophilized. Response surface methodology was used to investigate the influence of factors on the responses. The optimized formulation displayed complete drug delivery and zero-order release rate. The TEM and particle size analysis indicated that the morphology of the resultant nanoparticle in the capsule was spherical shaped with a mean size of 252\u00b119 nm. The in vivo test in beagle dogs demonstrated that the relative bioavailability of the novel system was 203.5% in comparison to that of the marketed preparation. The capsule successfully controlled the release of carvedilol and the fluctuation of plasma concentration was minimized. The system is a promising strategy to improve the oral bioavailability for poorly soluble drugs and preparing it into elementary osmotic pump conveniently.",

Although a group of potential VGSC inhibitors have been reported from tarantula venoms, little is known about the mechanism of their interaction with VGSCs. In this study, we showed that hainantoxin-IV (\u03b2-TRTX-Hn2a, HNTX-IV in brief), a 35-residue peptide from Ornithoctonus hainana venom, preferentially inhibited rNav1.2, rNav1.3 and hNav1.7 compared with rNav1.4 and hNav1.5. hNav1.7 was the most sensitive to HNTX-IV (IC50\u223c21nM). In contrast to many other tarantula toxins that affect VGSCs, HNTX-IV at subsaturating concentrations did not alter activation and inactivation kinetics in the physiological range of voltages, while very large depolarization above +70mV could partially activate toxin-bound hNav1.7 channel, indicating that HNTX-IV acts as a gating modifier rather than a pore blocker. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the toxin bound to site 4, which was located on the extracellular S3-S4 linker of hNav1.7 domain II. Mutants E753Q, D816N and E818Q of hNav1.7 decreased toxin affinity for hNav1.7 by 2.0-, 3.3- and 130-fold, respectively. In silico docking indicated that a three-toed claw substructure formed by residues with close contacts in the interface between HNTX-IV and hNav1.7 domain II stabilized the toxin-channel complex, impeding movement of the domain II voltage sensor and inhibiting hNav1.7 activation. Our data provide structural details for structure-based drug design and a useful template for the design of highly selective inhibitors of a specific subtype of VGSCs.",

    "187": "Adrenaline (Adr) is known to directly or indirectly modulate bone cell activity under physiological and pathological conditions. Osteoblasts play a major role in bone formation, employing intracellular Ca(2+) as a second messenger to modulate hormonal responses and as a cofactor for mineralization. Voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels (VDCCs) mediate the influx of Ca(2+) in response to membrane depolarization. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Adr on VDCC currents in osteoblasts using a patch-clamp recording method. Application of 1 mM Adr facilitated VDCC currents in a concentration-dependent manner. Pre-treatment with b receptor antagonist propranolol blocked Adr-induced facilitation of VDCC currents carried by Ba(2+) (IBa). These results indicate that Adr-induced facilitation of IBa was mediated by b receptors in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells. To our knowledge, the data presented here demonstrate for the first time that Adr facilitates VDCCs in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells.", 
    "188": "The burden of cardiovascular disease is expected to escalate in developing countries. However, studies and guidelines concerning atrial fibrillation (AF) are restricted to the developed world.", 
    "189": "To assess the treatment modalities of AF in South Africa.", 
    "190": "A cross-sectional, observational, multicentre, national registry of the treatment of 302 patients with AF was conducted from February 2010 to March 2011. Specific drug use for rate or rhythm control, as well as drug use for stroke prevention, was surveyed. Events during the 12 months prior to the survey were also characterised, including non-drug treatments, resource utilisation and complications.", 
    "191": "The single most prevalent clinical characteristic was hypertension (65.9%). Rhythm control was being pursued in 109 patients (36.1%) with class Ic and class III antiarrhythmic agents, while rate control, mainly with beta-blockers, was pursued in the remainder of the patients. Concomitant use of other cardiovascular drugs was high, and 75.2% of patients were on warfarin for stroke prevention. There was a high burden of AF-related morbidity during the preceding year, with 32.5% reporting a history of heart failure, 8.3% a stroke and 5.3% a transient ischaemic attack. Therapeutic success, as defined by either the presence of sinus rhythm or rate-controlled AF, was achieved in 86.8% as judged clinically by the treating physician, but in only 70.2% according to the electrocardiogram criterion of heart rate \u226480 bpm.", 
    "192": "There were no striking differences from previously reported registries worldwide. The lack of application of strict rate control criteria is highlighted.", 
    "193": "We report seven cases of successful treatment of acute migraine symptoms using beta blocker eye drops. The literature on beta blockers for acute migraine is reviewed. Oral beta blocker medication is not effective for acute migraine treatment. This is likely due to a relatively slow rate of achieving therapeutic plasma levels when taken orally. Topical beta blocker eye drops achieve therapeutic plasma levels within minutes of ocular administration which may explain their apparent effectiveness in relief of acute migraine symptoms.", 
    "194": "To evaluate the effect of treatment for 3 years with a dorzolamide/timolol (1%/0.5%) fixed combination (DTFC) on visual field progression in patients with open-angle glaucoma.", 
    "195": "A total of 14 consecutive patients were enrolled who had been previously treated with monotherapy or any combination of a beta blocker, carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, and/or prostaglandin analog for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG; n=4) or normal-tension glaucoma (NTG; n=10).", 
    "196": "Patients were switched to DTFC from their prior glaucoma therapy. The IOP was measured at intervals of 4-6 weeks, and the visual fields were examined at least twice a year for 3 years. The annual change of mean deviation (MD slope) was used to quantify visual field loss.", 
    "197": "The mean MD value was -5.9\u00b15.0 dB at baseline; it was -5.6\u00b14.8 dB at 12 months, -5.9\u00b15.0 dB at 24 months, and -5.6\u00b15.1 dB at 36 months after switching. The mean MD slope was -0.2\u00b10.8 dB/year before switching and 0.3\u00b11.3 dB/year from baseline to 1 year, -0.3\u00b11.1 dB/year from 1-2 years, and 0.3\u00b10.9 dB/year from 2-3 years after switching. The mean MD slope from baseline to 36 months was correlated with the IOP reduction rate at 36 months after switching. Visual field progression was associated with the IOP reduction rate at 12 months after switching.", 
    "198": "Switching to DTFC from prior glaucoma therapy improved the MD slope for at least 3 years. Reduction of the IOP after switching to DTFC was effective for delaying visual field progression. Although our study was not nonrandomized and was small in scale, the findings suggest that DTFC might have a beneficial effect on the visual fields in patients with open-angle glaucoma.", 
    "199": "Acute intraoperative heart failure (HF) is a rare but often fatal complication of liver transplant surgery. Little is known about the clinical course or predictive variables. Our aims were to provide a detailed clinical description and conduct a systematic search for characteristics associated with intraoperative HF.", 
    "200": "A matched case-control study of adults undergoing primary liver transplant from 2009 to 2011 was conducted. Cases showed new onset HF with an ejection fraction less than 50% during liver transplant surgery. Controls were recipients without signs or symptoms of HF. Matching was based on: age, sex, model for end-stage liver disease at the time of transplant, type 2 diabetes, and \u03b2-blocker use. Conditional logistic regression analyses were conducted.", 
    "201": "From 2009 to 2011, seven (3%) of 256 recipients developed intraoperative HF with one resulting death. All survivors regained normal systolic function within 6 months of surgery. Decreasing preoperative serum sodium (odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.94; P = 0.039) and increasing number of units of packed red blood cells transfused intraoperatively (odds ratio=1.2, 95% confidence interval, 1.001-1.467, P = 0.048) were associated with HF.", 
    "202": "No preoperative echocardiographic parameter predicted HF in affected patients. Two possible explanations are: our patients suffered from stress cardiomyopathy and therefore had no evidence of impaired contraction before the event or echocardiographic predictors of HF were masked by circulatory changes in patients with cirrhosis. Lower serum sodium and more red blood cell transfusions were associated with intraoperative HF. Lower mortality of our intraoperative cases compared to others may be influenced by earlier diagnosis and intervention.", 
    "203": "TO IMPROVE SINUS RHYTHM CONVERSION, THE COX MAZE III PROCEDURE WITH NARROW MAZES (WIDTH: \u22643.0 cm) was performed in combination with left atrial volume reduction.", 
    "204": "From October 2007 to April 2013, 87 patients with atrial fibrillation (paroxysmal in 3, persistent in 14, and permanent in 70) underwent the Cox maze procedure concomitant with another cardiac procedure. They were followed-up with serial electrocardiographic and echocardiographic studies. We used 24-hour Holter monitoring tests to evaluate postoperatively symptomatic patients.", 
    "205": "At the mean follow-up time of 36.4 months, 81 patients (94.2%) had sinus rhythm and two were on anti-arrhythmic medication (one on a beta-blocker and the other on amiodarone). Five patients (5.8%) with postoperative recurrent and persistent atrial fibrillation never experienced sinus rhythm conversion; however, they did not require any medication for rate control. On postoperative echocardiography, the left atrial A waves were more frequently observed after concomitant mitral valve repair than after concomitant mitral valve replacement (82.4% vs. 40.4%, respectively; p<0.001).", 
    "206": "For the Cox maze procedure, narrow mazes and atrial volume reduction resulted in excellent sinus rhythm conversion without the preventive use of anti-arrhythmic drugs, and they did not affect the presence of the left atrial A waves on echocardiography.", 
    "207": "Prolonged and dispersed left-ventricular (LV) contraction is present in patients with long-QT syndrome (LQTS). Electrical and mechanical abnormalities appear most pronounced in symptomatic individuals. We focus on the 'electromechanical window' (EMW; duration of LV-mechanical systole minus QT interval) in patients with genotyped LQTS. Profound EMW negativity heralds torsades de pointes in animal models of drug-induced LQTS.", 
    "208": "We included 244 LQTS patients from three centres, of whom 97 had experienced arrhythmic events. Seventy-six matched healthy individuals served as controls. QT interval was subtracted from the duration of Q-onset to aortic-valve closure (QAoC) midline assessed non-invasively by continuous-wave echocardiography, measured in the same beat. Electromechanical window was positive in controls but negative in LQTS patients (22 \u00b1 19 vs. -43 \u00b1 46 ms; P < 0.0001), being even more negative in symptomatic than event-free patients (-67 \u00b1 42 vs. -27 \u00b1 41 ms; P < 0.0001). QT, QTc, and QAoC were longer in LQTS subjects (451 \u00b1 57, 465 \u00b1 50, and 408 \u00b1 37 ms, P < 0.0001). Electromechanical window was a better discriminator of patients with previous arrhythmic events than resting QTc (AUC 0.77 (95% CI, 0.71-0.83) and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.65-0.78); P = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, EMW predicted arrhythmic events independently of QTc (odds ratio 1.25; 95% CI, 1.11-1.40; P = 0.001). Adding EMW to QTc for risk assessment led to a net reclassification improvement of 13.3% (P = 0.03). No EMW differences were found between the three major LQTS genotypes.", 
    "209": "Patients with genotype-positive LQTS express EMW negativity, which is most pronounced in patients with documented arrhythmic events.", 
    "210": "Adenylyl cyclase (AC) is a key signalling enzyme for many GPCRs and catalyses the conversion of ATP to cAMP which, in turn, is a crucial determinant of many biological responses. \u03b2-Adrenoceptor agonists are prescribed as bronchodilators for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and it is commonly assumed that they elicit their actions via AC-dependent production of cAMP. However, empirical evidence in support of this is lacking and the exact mechanism by which these drugs acts remains elusive. This is partly due to the existence of at least 10 different isoforms of AC and the absence of any truly selective pharmacological inhibitors. Here, we have used genetically modified mice and model systems to establish the role of AC isoforms in the airway responses to \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonists.", 
    "211": "Receptors mediating responses to \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonists in airway smooth muscle (ASM) and sensory nerve were identified in isolated tissue systems. Expression of mRNA for the AC isoforms in ASM and neurones was determined by qPCR. Functional responses were assessed in AC isoform KO mice and wild-type controls.", 
    "212": "Airway and vagal tissue expressed mRNA for various isoforms of AC. AC6 was the most prominent isoform. Responses to \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonists in tissues from AC6 KO mice were virtually abolished.", 
    "213": "AC6 played a critical role in relaxation of ASM to \u03b21 -adrenoceptor agonists and in modulation of sensory nerves by \u03b21-3 -adrenoceptor agonists. These results further unravel the signalling pathway of this extensively prescribed class of medicine."
