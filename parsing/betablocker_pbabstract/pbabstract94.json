Patients were evaluated for clinical risk factors (age>70 years, histories of MI, angina, diabetes mellitus, stroke, renal failure, heart failure and pulmonary disease), DSE, statin and beta-blocker use. The main outcome was a composite of perioperative mortality and MI within 30 days of surgery.", 
    "3": "Perioperative mortality or MI occurred in 51 (8.9%) patients. The incidence of the composite endpoint was significantly lower in statin users compared to nonusers (3.7% vs. 11.0%; crude odds ratio (OR): 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.13-0.74; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). After correcting for other covariates, the association between statin use and reduced incidence of the composite endpoint remained unchanged (OR: 0.24,95% CI: 0.10-0.70; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Beta-blocker use was also associated with a significant reduction in the composite endpoint (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.11-0.54). Patients using a combination of statins and beta-blockers appeared to be at lower risk for the composite endpoint across multiple cardiac risk strata; particularly patients with 3 or more risk factors experienced significantly lower perioperative events.",

    "5": "Anti-arrhythmic drugs have narrow therapeutic ranges and typically can engender harmful side effects. The intrapericardial (IP) delivery of anti-arrhythmic agents proposes to achieve higher myocardial levels while minimizing plasma concentrations, thus diminishing systemic side effects. Furthermore, IP delivery enables concentrations at the target site to be more precisely controlled. Our study objective was to compare the relative cardiac effects of intrapericardial administration of metoprolol to standard intravenous (IV) delivery in a swine surgical model. In order to answer the question of how IP metoprolol affects sinus tachycardia, atrial electrophysiology, and pharmacokinetics compared with IV delivery, a medial sternotomy was performed on 21 swine that were divided into three groups: (1) After inducing sinus tachycardia, metoprolol boluses were delivered IP (n = 4) or IV (n = 4); (2) metoprolol was administered either IP (n = 3) or IV (n = 3) with saline controls (n = 3), and electrophysiologic data were collected; (3) metoprolol levels were tracked both in the blood (IV, n = 2) and pericardial (IP, n = 2) fluid. After either IP or IV delivery of metoprolol, heart rates were lowered significantly to 70% and 73% of control rate, respectively. The therapeutic effect of IV-administered metoprolol was considerably reduced after 1 h but was sustained longer in the IP group. Additionally, ventricular contractility and mean arterial pressure parameters were significantly lower in IV-treated animals but were nearly unaffected in IP-treated animals. With IP administration, the elimination half-life of metoprolol in pericardial fluid was 14.4 min with negligible accumulations in the plasma, whereas with IV delivery, the elimination half-life in plasma was 11.1 min with negligible amounts found in the pericardial fluid. The targeted intrapericardial delivery of metoprolol effectively lowers heart rates for sustained periods of time, with minimal effect on either ventricular contractility or mean arterial pressure. We did not observe dramatic changes in induced atrial fibrillation times or refractory periods using this model.",

    "8": "The corrected QT interval (QTc) measured 2 weeks after ovariectomy was not significantly different from that in the time-matched control rabbits. After 2 weeks of HRT, the QTc in the ovariectomized rabbits treated with estradiol alone (group E) was not significantly different from that in the control (group C); whereas in the ovariectomized rabbits treated with estradiol plus progesterone (group E + P), it was significantly shorter than those in groups E (P < .05) and C (P < .01), respectively. The corrected Tpeak-end interval (Tpec), an indicator of global dispersion of ventricular repolarization, was also significantly reduced in group E + P compared with that of group C (P < .01). In group E, d,l-sotalol-induced prolongation of QTc and the rate and the severity of arrhythmias were significantly higher, while the dose of sotalol to initiate arrhythmias was significantly lower than those in groups C or E + P, respectively (P < .05 or P < .01).",

Patients were randomly allocated to ivabradine or placebo, superimposed on background therapy for HF. Complete echocardiographic data at baseline and 8 months were available for 411 patients (ivabradine 208, placebo 203). Treatment with ivabradine reduced LVESVI (primary substudy endpoint) vs. placebo [-7.0 \u00b1 16.3 vs. -0.9 \u00b1 17.1 mL/m(2); difference (SE), -5.8 (1.6), 95% CI -8.8 to -2.7, P< 0.001]. The reduction in LVESVI was independent of beta-blocker use, HF aetiology, and baseline LVEF.

Adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: a normal control group, a hypertensive control group and a propranolol treatment group (n=9). After 4 weeks of propranolol treatment, intracavernous pressure (ICP) responses to electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerves were evaluated. The expression of IGFBP-3 and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mRNA and protein in the rat cavernous tissue were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. The concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the cavernous tissue was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cavernosal pressure in response to cavernous nerve stimulation was decreased 4 weeks after propranolol treatment (P<0.01, compared to the hypertensive control group). IGFBP-3 mRNA and protein expression was increased in the propranolol treatment group compared to the hypertensive control group (P<0.01), whereas IGF-1 expression was decreased in the propranolol treatment group compared to the hypertensive control group (P<0.01). In addition, cavernous cGMP concentration was decreased in the propranolol treatment group compared to the hypertensive control group (P<0.01). Taken together, these results suggest that the upregulation of IGFBP-3 may play a role in the development of ED in hypertensive rats.",

Baseline assessment of central visual function included high-contrast visual acuity and Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity. Binocular integrated visual fields were derived from monocular Humphrey Field Analyzer plots. Rate ratios (RR) for falls and injurious falls with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were based on negative binomial regression models.", 
    "16": "During the 1-year follow-up, 31 (44%) participants experienced at least one fall and 22 (31%) experienced falls that resulted in an injury. Greater visual impairment was associated with increased falls rate, independent of age and gender. In a multivariate model, more extensive field loss in the inferior region was associated with higher rate of falls (RR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.32) and falls with injury (RR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.98), adjusted for all other vision measures and potential confounding factors. Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and superior field loss were not associated with the rate of falls; topical beta-blocker use was also not associated with increased falls risk.", 
    "17": "Falls are common among older adults with glaucoma and occur more frequently in those with greater visual impairment, particularly in the inferior field region. This finding highlights the importance of the inferior visual field region in falls risk and assists in identifying older adults with glaucoma at risk of future falls, for whom potential interventions should be targeted.", 
    "18": "The predictive role of hyponatremia has been tested in acute and chronic heart failure. Sodium level is inversely related with renin-angiotensin-aldersterone system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous activity but important issues remain unresolved. Our aim was to define the level of hyponatremia able to predict 1-year outcomes and investigate the relation between sodium levels and mortality and the effect of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on this relation.",

We studied all consecutive chronic dialysis patients aged\u226566 years who initiated dialysis between 1 July 1991 and 31 July 2007. Patients were divided into three groups according to new medication use after the initiation of chronic dialysis. The three groups were patients initiated on beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and statins only. Patients in the beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker groups could also be concurrently receiving a statin.

Compared to statin-only use, beta-blocker use was not associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92-1.23]. As expected, calcium channel blocker use was also not associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes (aHR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79-1.06). Among all subgroup analyses by beta-blocker attributes, only high-dose beta-blocker therapy was associated with better cardiovascular outcomes as compared to low-dose beta-blockers (aHR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29-0.88).",

    "26": "Barth syndrome (BTHS) is a mitochondrial myopathy characterized by reports of exercise intolerance. We sought to determine if 1) BTHS leads to abnormalities of skeletal muscle O(2) extraction/utilization and 2) exercise intolerance in BTHS is related to impaired O(2) extraction/utilization, impaired cardiac function, or both. Participants with BTHS (age: 17 \u00b1 5 yr, n = 15) and control participants (age: 13 \u00b1 4 yr, n = 9) underwent graded exercise testing on a cycle ergometer with continuous ECG and metabolic measurements. Echocardiography was performed at rest and at peak exercise. Near-infrared spectroscopy of the vastus lateralis muscle was continuously recorded for measurements of skeletal muscle O(2) extraction. Adjusting for age, peak O(2) consumption (16.5 \u00b1 4.0 vs. 39.5 \u00b1 12.3 ml\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1), P < 0.001) and peak work rate (58 \u00b1 19 vs. 166 \u00b1 60 W, P < 0.001) were significantly lower in BTHS than control participants. The percent increase from rest to peak exercise in ejection fraction (BTHS: 3 \u00b1 10 vs. control: 19 \u00b1 4%, P < 0.01) was blunted in BTHS compared with control participants. The muscle tissue O(2) saturation change from rest to peak exercise was paradoxically opposite (BTHS: 8 \u00b1 16 vs. control: -5 \u00b1 9, P < 0.01), and the deoxyhemoglobin change was blunted (BTHS: 0 \u00b1 12 vs. control: 10 \u00b1 8, P < 0.09) in BTHS compared with control participants, indicating impaired skeletal muscle extraction in BTHS. In conclusion, severe exercise intolerance in BTHS is due to both cardiac and skeletal muscle impairments that are consistent with cardiac and skeletal mitochondrial myopathy. These findings provide further insight to the pathophysiology of BTHS.", 
    "27": "Cell membrane phospholipids, like phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P(2)], can regulate epithelial Na channel (ENaC) activity. Gender differences in lung ENaC expression have also been demonstrated. However, the effects in vivo on alveolar fluid clearance are uncertain. Thus PI(4,5)P(2) effects on alveolar fluid clearance were studied in male and female rats. An isosmolar 5% albumin solution was intrapulmonary instilled; alveolar fluid clearance was studied for 1 h. Female rats had a 37 \u00b1 19% higher baseline alveolar fluid clearance than male rats. Bilateral ovariectomy attenuated this gender difference. Compared with controls, PI(4,5)P(2) instillation (300 \u03bcM) increased alveolar fluid clearance by \u223c93% in both genders. Amiloride or the specific \u03b1ENaC small-interfering RNA inhibited baseline and PI(4,5)P(2)-stimulated alveolar fluid clearance in both genders, indicating a dependence on amiloride-sensitive pathways. The fraction of amiloride inhibition was greater in PI(4,5)P(2)-instilled rats (male: 64 \u00b1 10%; female: 70 \u00b1 11%) than in controls (male: 30 \u00b1 6%; female: 44 \u00b1 8%). PI(4,5)P(2) instillation lacked additional alveolar fluid clearance stimulation above that of terbutaline, nor did propranolol inhibit alveolar fluid clearance after PI(4,5)P(2) instillation, indicating that PI(4,5)P(2) stimulation was not secondary to endogenous \u03b2-adrenoceptor activation. PI(4,5)P(2) amine instillation resulted in an intermediate alveolar fluid clearance stimulation, suggesting that, to reach maximal alveolar fluid clearance stimulation, PI(4,5)P(2) must reside in cell membranes. In summary, PI(4,5)P(2) instillation upregulated in vivo alveolar fluid clearance similar to short-term \u03b2-adrenoceptor upregulation of alveolar fluid clearance. PI(4,5)P(2) stimulation was mediated partly by increased amiloride-sensitive Na transport. There exist important gender-related effects suggesting a female advantage that may have clinical implications for resolution of acute lung injury.",

    "38": "Heart failure was induced in 35 female rabbits by rapid ventricular pacing, resulting in a significant decrease of ejection fraction. Thirty-four rabbits were sham-operated. In 17 of 35 CHF-rabbits and 20 of 34 'sham'-rabbits, amiodarone (50 mg/kg/day) was fed for 6 weeks. Eight monophasic action potentials and a simultaneously recorded 12-lead electrocardiogram showed prolongation of QT-interval and action potential duration (APD(90)) in all failing hearts (P< 0.05). Amiodarone pre-treatment led to a prolongation of APD(90) (+19 ms) as compared with sham-controlled hearts but showed only a marginal effect on APD(90) in failing hearts. Infusion of sotalol (50-100 \u00b5M) led to a significant prolongation of APD(90) in sham and a further prolongation of APD(90) in failing hearts [+55 ms (50 \u00b5M); +70 ms (100 \u00b5M); P< 0.01 as compared with sham hearts]. Sotalol led to a triangular action potential configuration in sham and failing hearts, whereas amiodarone did not cause triangularization but caused a rapid phase-III repolarization. Moreover, amiodarone did not increase dispersion of repolarization either in sham or in failing hearts. Infusion of sotalol led to a significant increase in dispersion of repolarization in sham (+29 ms) and a further increase in failing hearts (+67 ms; P< 0.05).",

    "40": "A prominent aqueous cavity is formed by the junction of three identical subunits in the excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) family. To investigate the effect of this structure on the interaction of ligands with the transporter, we recorded currents in voltage-clamped Xenopus oocytes expressing EAATs and used concentration jumps to measure binding and unbinding rates of a high-affinity aspartate analog that competitively blocks transport (\u03b2-2-fluorenyl-aspartylamide; 2-FAA). The binding rates of the blocker were approximately one order of magnitude slower than l-Glu and were not significantly different for EAAT1, EAAT2, or EAAT3, but 2-FAA exhibited higher affinity for the neuronal transporter EAAT3 as a result of a slower dissociation rate. Unexpectedly, the rate of recovery from block was increased by l-Glu in a saturable and concentration-dependent manner, ruling out a first-order mechanism and suggesting that following unbinding, there is a significant probability of ligand rebinding to the same or neighboring subunits within a trimer. Consistent with such a mechanism, coexpression of wild-type subunits with mutant (R447C) subunits that do not bind glutamate or 2-FAA also increased the unblocking rate. The data suggest that electrostatic and steric factors result in an effective dissociation rate that is approximately sevenfold slower than the microscopic subunit unbinding rate. The quaternary structure, which has been conserved through evolution, is expected to increase the transporters' capture efficiency by increasing the probability that following unbinding, a ligand will rebind as opposed to being lost to diffusion.",

The diagnosis is made based on reproducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias including bidirectional VT and polymorphic VT during exercise testings. Two causative genes of CPVT have been identified: RYR2, encoding the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) Ca(2+) release channel, and CASQ2, encoding cardiac calsequestrin. A mutation in RYR2 or CASQ2 is identified in approximately 60% of patients with CPVT. Mutations in these two genes destabilize the RyR2 Ca(2+) release channel complex in sarcoplasmic reticulum and result in spontaneous Ca(2+) release through RyR2 channels leading to delayed after depolarization, triggered activity, and bidirectional/polymorphic VT.

Circulation. 2008;117:e350 However, painful shocks can trigger further adrenergic stress and arrhythmias, and deaths have occurred despite appropriate ICD shocks. Treatment with \u03b2-adrenergic blockers reduces arrhythmia burden and mortality, but is not completely effective. The beneficial effects of Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil in combination with \u03b2-blocker have been reported, but the role of verapamil has not been well assessed. Because Ca(2+) leakage through ryanodine channel is a common mechanism of CPVT, ryanodine channel block may have a therapeutic effect. We discovered that flecainide directly inhibits RyR2 channels and prevent CPVT. Left cardiac sympathetic denervation may be an effective alternative treatment in combination with ICD, especially for patients whose arrhythmias are not controlled by drug therapies.",

It is shown that highly efficient LC separations like those obtained with sub-2 \u03bcm porous and 2.7 \u03bcm superficially porous particles (UHPLC) produce significantly higher T(f)-values than the corresponding separation based on 3 \u03bcm porous particles (HPLC) when the same amount of sample is injected. Still UHPLC separations provide a better resolution to adjacent peaks. Expressions have been derived that describe how the T(f)-value changes with particle size or number of theoretical plates. Expressions have also been derived that can be used to scale the injection volume based on particle size or number of theoretical plates to maintain the T(f)-value when translating a HPLC separation to the corresponding UHPLC separation. An aspect that has been ignored in previous publications. Finally, data obtained from columns with different age/condition indicate that T(f)-values should be complemented by a peak width measure to provide a more objective quality measure.",

The present study attempted to clarify mechanisms of \u03b2-AR up-regulation using mouse cerebral cortical neurons continuously exposed to nadolol (10 nM), a non-selective \u03b2-AR antagonist, for 24 h. Nadolol dose-dependently induced both subtypes of \u03b2-ARs, \u03b2\u2081- and \u03b2\u2082-ARs, which were not suppressed by protein A kinase inhibition with KT5720. On the other hand, blockade of \u03b1\u2081-ARs, which are immunohistochemically confirmed to be co-localized with \u03b2-ARs in the same neurons, significantly inhibited only \u03b2\u2081-AR up-regulation and the expression of \u03b2\u2082-ARs did not alter. In addition, phenylephrine, an agonist specific to \u03b1\u2081-ARs up-regulated \u03b2\u2081-ARs, but not \u03b2\u2082-ARs. Under the conditions with \u03b2-AR up-regulation, the level of phosphorylated protein kinase C\u03b1 (pPKC\u03b1) increased, which is significantly suppressed by prazosin, an \u03b11-AR antagonist. Furthermore, nadolol decreased the degradation of mRNA of \u03b2\u2081-ARs, but not \u03b2\u2082-ARs. These results indicate that the nadolol-induced \u03b2\u2081-AR up-regulation is mediated via PKC-relating pathway via \u03b1\u2081-AR activation with stabilizing \u03b2\u2081-AR mRNA and that the increased expression of \u03b2\u2082-ARs is regulated by pathways different from those for \u03b2\u2081-AR expression.",

We investigated the effects of this classification on all-cause mortality in 1,285 patients from the Evaluation of the Methods and Management of Acute Coronary Events (EMMACE)-2 registry. There were 528 deaths (6.6-year all-cause mortality 41.1%). Survival was greatest in the cTnI \u2264 0.06-\u03bcg/L subgroup at 30 days (p = 0.005), 6 months (p = 0.015), 1 year (p = 0.002), and 6.6 years (p = 0.045). After adjustment there was no significant difference in survival between the cTnI >0.06- to < 0.5-\u03bcg/L and \u2265 0.5-\u03bcg/L subgroups.

To this end, this study evaluated a new series of red-emitting ligands for the human \u03b2-adrenoceptor family. Upon the basis of the orthosteric ligands propranolol, alprenolol, and pindolol, the synthesized linker-modified congeners were coupled to the commercially available fluorophore BODIPY 630/650-X.

On the first day, isoproterenol-induced [Ca2+]i changes as compared to cirazolin-induced ones were characterized by greater amplitude and lesser impulse duration over the entire range of physiological concentrations used. These differences were negligible after 3 days and kinetic differences were practically absent after 6 days of cultivation. The agonist-induced [Ca2+]i changes in proliferating and differentiated cells differed significantly: in the process of cell growth in culture, the amplitude of calcium response increased, the duration of impulse signal decreased and the sensitivity to adrenergic agonists increased.

DESIGN. The authors reviewed autonomic testing data and medical records for patients aged 18 years and younger who underwent testing between 1993 and 2007 and who had adequate clinical data. Relevance of test results to clinical symptoms was ranked on a 3-point scale. Treatments were noted and their benefit ranked on a 5-point scale. RESULTS. Among 142 pediatric patients identified, postural tachycardia syndrome was most common (71%) while orthostatic hypotension was rare (5%). Testing provided relevant information regarding the patient's symptoms in 88% of the cases. Beta-blockers were the most commonly prescribed medication (59%); 73% improved. CONCLUSIONS. Postural tachycardia syndrome was common in this large pediatric population, whereas orthostatic hypotension was infrequent.

The generation of HO decreased with increasing pH within the range of 6.0-9.0 at the Fe(III)-to-citrate ratio of 10:50 (10(-6)M). However, when the concentration of citrate increased to 1.5 \u00d7 10(-4)M, the formation rate of HO increased in the order of pH 9.0<3.0<7.0<4.0<5.0. The pH-dependent HO production was governed by the stability of Fe(II)/Fe(II)-citrate and the amount of O(2)(-) in the solution. Propranolol can be efficiently photodegraded in Fe(III)-citrate system at pH 7.0 with pseudo-first-order constant 3.1 \u00d7 10(-4)s(-1). HO was verified to be the main reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for the photodegradation of propranolol. The presence of metal ions inhibited the Fe(III)-cit-induced photodegradation in the order of Mn(2+)>Cu(2+)>Ca(2+)>Mg(2+). Both humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) markedly suppressed the degradation of propranolol. Moreover, the iron in Fe(III)-citrate system was reused by a simple addition of citrate to the reaction solution. By GC-MS analysis, the photoproducts of the propranolol were identified and the degradation pathway was proposed. This work suggests that Fe(III)-citrate complexes are good alternative for the advanced treatment of organic pollutants at neutral pH in aqueous solution.",

This study is aimed to elucidate the role of \u03b2(3)-AR in the regulation of atrial fibrillation (AF), especially its role in rapid pacing-induced atrial electrical remodeling in rabbits. The rapid atrial pacing model was established by embedding electrodes in the right atrium pacing at a speed of 600 beats per minute. The protein level of \u03b2(3)-AR in the atria was found significantly upregulated by western blot. The atrial effective refractory period (AERP) and its rate adaptation were decreased after pacing which were further shortened by BRL37344, a selective \u03b2(3)-AR agonist, leading to the increase of AF inducibility and duration. Similarly, \u03b2(3)-AR activation induced time-dependent shortening of action potential duration (APD), together with decrease of L-type calcium current (I(Ca,L)) and increase of inward rectifier potassium current (I(K1)) and transient outward potassium current (I(to)) in rapid pacing atrial myocytes. Meanwhile, all the effects were abolished by specific \u03b2(3)-AR antagonist, SR59230A.

ARB therapy did not alter insulin sensitivity [5.2 (2.7) pre-treatment and 4.6 (1.6) post-treatment] compared with placebo therapy [6.1 (2.9) pre-treatment and 5.3 (2.7) post-treatment; P value not significant], but did improve the HOMA-B compared with placebo therapy (P=0.05). ARB therapy also did not change endothelial function [RH-PAT, 2.15 (0.7) pre-treatment and 2.11 (0.7) post-treatment] compared with placebo therapy [RH-PAT, 1.81 (0.5) pre-treatment and 1.76 (0.7) post-treatment; P value not significant]. Markers of inflammation and oxidative stress were not significantly changed by ARB therapy. In conclusion, ARB therapy did not alter peripheral insulin sensitivity or endothelial function in this cohort of patients with essential hypertension, abdominal obesity and impaired fasting glucose, but did improve pancreatic \u03b2-cell function.", 
    "93": "In men, muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) is positively related to total peripheral resistance (TPR) and inversely related to cardiac output (CO). However, this relationship was not observed in young women. We aimed to investigate whether simultaneous \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation offsets this balance in young women. Furthermore, we aimed to examine whether the ability of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptors to offset the transduction of MSNA into vasoconstrictor tone was lost in postmenopausal women. We measured MSNA (peroneal microneurography), arterial pressure (brachial line), CO (Modelflow), TPR and changes in forearm vascular conductance (FVC) to increasing doses of noradrenaline (NA; 2, 4 and 8 ng (100 ml)(-1) min(-1)) before and after systemic \u03b2-blockade with propranolol in 17 young men, 17 young women and 15 postmenopausal (PM) women. The percentage and absolute change in FVC to the last two doses of NA were greater during \u03b2-blockade in young women (P < 0.05), whereas the change in FVC was similar before and during \u03b2-blockade in young men and PM women (P > 0.05). Before \u03b2-blockade there was no relationship of MSNA to TPR or mean arterial pressure (MAP) in young women. Following \u03b2-blockade, MSNA became positively related to TPR (r = 0.59, P < 0.05) and MAP (r = 0.58, P < 0.05). In the PM women and young men, MSNA was positively associated with TPR. \u03b2-Blockade had no effect on this relationship. Our data suggest that the \u03b2-adrenergic receptors offset \u03b1-adrenergic vasoconstriction in young women but not young men or PM women. These findings may explain in part the tendency for blood pressure to rise after menopause in women.", 
    "94": "Hemangiomas are benign neoplasms of the vasculature frequently encountered in children. Several studies have shown that these tumors are characterized by excessive angiogenesis. Although benign, the lesions can present with complications, and may thus require treatment. There are multiple therapeutic options available for patients with problematic or life threatening hemangiomas, some of which have serious side effects. Randomized clinical trials and evidence-based studies on the efficacy of these treatments is still lacking. The recognition that excessive angiogenesis underlies hemangiogenesis offers an opportunity for the development of safer therapeutic strategies that are based on the inhibition of angiogenesis. We review medical therapies currently employed in the management of hemangiomas and the role of angiogenesis inhibition in hemangioma therapy.", 
    "95": "Medial degeneration is a key feature of aneurysm disease and aortic dissection. In a murine aneurysm model we investigated the structural and functional characteristics of aortic wall degeneration in adult fibulin-4 deficient mice and the potential therapeutic role of the angiotensin (Ang) II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonist losartan in preventing aortic media degeneration. Adult mice with 2-fold (heterozygous Fibulin-4(+/R)) and 4-fold (homozygous Fibulin-4(R/R)) reduced expression of fibulin-4 displayed the histological features of cystic media degeneration as found in patients with aneurysm or dissection, including elastin fiber fragmentation, loss of smooth muscle cells, and deposition of ground substance in the extracellular matrix of the aortic media. The aortic contractile capacity, determined by isometric force measurements, was diminished, and was associated with dysregulation of contractile genes as shown by aortic transcriptome analysis. These structural and functional alterations were accompanied by upregulation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in aortas from fibulin-4 deficient mice, as identified by genome-scaled network analysis as well as by immunohistochemical staining for phosphorylated Smad2, an intracellular mediator of TGF-\u03b2. Tissue levels of Ang II, a regulator of TGF-\u03b2 signaling, were increased. Prenatal treatment with the AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan, which blunts TGF-\u03b2 signaling, prevented elastic fiber fragmentation in the aortic media of newborn Fibulin-4(R/R) mice. Postnatal losartan treatment reduced haemodynamic stress and improved lifespan of homozygous knockdown fibulin-4 animals, but did not affect aortic vessel wall structure. In conclusion, the AT(1) receptor blocker losartan can prevent aortic media degeneration in a non-Marfan syndrome aneurysm mouse model. In established aortic aneurysms, losartan does not affect aortic architecture, but does improve survival. These findings may extend the potential therapeutic application of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system to the preventive treatment of aneurysm disease.",

In N, O and N + O, all values remained normal. In renal cortex of P, p22phox and nitrotyrosine abundance as well as H(2)O(2) levels were higher and extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC SOD) was lower versus normal kidneys. N, O and N + O normalized p22phox, H(2)O(2) and EC SOD and increased Mn SOD above normal. The cortical neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) \u03b2 abundance increased in P and this was prevented by N, O and N + O.",

There was no additive benefit of N + O since each drug effectively prevented injury, but a combination may be beneficial where protection is incomplete with each drug. The increased nNOS\u03b2 protein seen early in the course of the CKD may contribute to the evolving GS.",

In the presence of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (DEHP) and tris-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP) in the membrane phase, the three \u03b2-blockers showed completely different transport behaviors which enabled highly selective separation of the drugs. Each \u03b2-blocker migrated from 3 mL of sample solutions, through a thin layer of specific organic solvent immobilized in the pores of a porous hollow fiber, and into a 15 \u03bcL acidic aqueous acceptor solution present inside the lumen of the fiber. The influences of fundamental parameters affecting the transport of target drugs including type of ion carrier for selective separation of each drug and its concentration in the membrane phase, extraction voltage, time of transport, pH of donor and acceptor phases, stirring speed of donor phase and salt effect were studied and optimized. After microextraction process, the extracts were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Under optimal conditions, ATE was selectively extracted from different saliva samples with recovery of 37%, which corresponded to preconcentration factor of 74. A good linearity was achieved for calibration curve with a coefficient of determination higher than 0.997.

Ulceration is one of the main complications of HOI, and active treatment is usually required to manage pain, potential scarring, and occasionally bleeding and infection. Since the discovery that oral propranolol is an effective treatment for complicated HOI, it has been replacing systemic corticosteroids as first-line therapy, and early recommendations for treatment protocols have been devised. We report the successful treatment of six children with recalcitrant ulcerated HOI using propranolol. In all cases, complete, rapid healing occurred. Two children experienced recurrence of ulceration after ceasing propranolol, but this was rapidly controlled by restarting treatment. No adverse effects were encountered. We propose that ulceration in HOI is an indication for propranolol treatment if more conservative therapies have failed.",

In this study, we evaluated the effect of propranolol in 12 infants with hemangioma. Twelve infants (9 girls) with a median age of 4.5 months were included in the study. All of the patients in the study group received short-term (1-9 weeks, median: 4 weeks) systemic corticosteroids as a first-line therapy. All patients received propranolol 2 mg/kg/day, divided into three doses. They were treated in an inpatient setting for the first 72 hours of the treatment. Vital signs, blood pressure and blood glucose were monitored. Propranolol treatment was given for 4-9 months (median: 5 months). In the study group, regression rate of the mean dimension of the lesion was 38% +/- 15 (range 15%-50, median 45%) at the 2nd month of therapy. Over 9 months, which was the maximum follow-up period, the regression rate of the mean dimension of the lesion was 55% +/- 31 (range 20%-80, median 50%). One patient had transient bradycardia, which improved spontaneously. No other side effect was observed in the study population. Propranolol appears to be an effective drug for infantile hemangiomas with good clinical tolerance. We suggest that propranolol is the preferable drug as the first-line therapy for infantile hemangiomas.",

A metabolite of angiotensin (Ang) II, Ang-(1-7), has been shown to exhibit cardiovascular effects that are in opposition to that of Ang II. However, the action of Ang-(1-7) on sympathetic outflow and baroreflex function is not well understood, especially in CHF. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of intracerebroventricular infusion of Ang-(1-7) on baroreflex control of heart rate and renal sympathetic nerve activity in conscious rabbits with CHF. We hypothesized that central Ang-(1-7) would improve baroreflex function in CHF. Ang-(1-7) (2 nmol/1 \u03bcL per hour) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (1 \u03bcL per hour) was infused by an osmotic minipump for 4 days in sham and pacing-induced CHF rabbits (n=3 to 6 per group). Ang-(1-7) treatment had no effects in sham rabbits but reduced heart rate and increased baroreflex gain (7.4\u00b11.5 versus 2.5\u00b10.4 bpm/mm Hg; P<0.05) in CHF rabbits. The Ang-(1-7) antagonist A779 (8 nmol/1 \u03bcL per hour) blocked the improvement in baroreflex gain in CHF. Baroreflex gain increased in CHF+Ang-(1-7) animals when only the vagus was allowed to modulate baroreflex control by acute treatment with the \u03b2-1 antagonist metoprolol, indicating increased vagal tone. Baseline renal sympathetic nerve activity was significantly lower, and baroreflex control of renal sympathetic nerve activity was enhanced in CHF rabbits receiving Ang-(1-7). These data suggest that augmentation of central Ang-(1-7) inhibits sympathetic outflow and increases vagal outflow in CHF, thus contributing to enhanced baroreflex gain in this disease state.",

    "178": "In cardiac surgery, agents are needed to produce temporary cardiac arrest (cardioplegia).

The (25) MgPMC(16) (porphyrin adducts of cyclohexil fullerene-C60) is known as a nanoparticle which has a cardioprotective effect when the heart is subjected to stressful conditions. In this study, we aimed to confirm the deleterious effects of ESM overdose on cardiac mitochondria and identify any protective effects of (25) MgPMC(16) in male Wistar rats. Esmolol 100 mg kg(-1) (LD50 = 71 mg kg(-1) ) was injected intravenously (i.v.) into tail vein to induce cardiac arrest. This dose was obtained from an ESM dose-response curve which induces at least 80% arrest in rats. (25) MgPMC(16) at three different doses (45, 90 and 224 mg kg(-1) ) was injected i.v. as pretreatment, eight hours before ESM injection. (25) MgCl(2) or (24) MgPMC(16) were used as controls. Following cardiac arrest, the heart was removed and the mitochondria extracted. Mitochondrial viability and the adenosine 5'-diphosphate sodium salt hydrate/Adenosine 5'-triphosphate disodium salt hydrate (ADP/ATP) ratio were measured as biomarkers of mitochondrial function. Results indicate that (25) MgPMC(16) caused a significant increase in mitochondrial viability and decrease in ADP/ATP ratio. No significant changes were seen with (24) MgPMC(16) or (25) MgCl(2) . It is concluded that cardiac arrest induced by ESM overdose leads to a significant decrease in mitochondrial viability and their ATP levels, whereas pretreatment by (25) MgPMC(16) can protect mitochondria by increasing ATP level through liberation of Mg into cells and the improvement of hypoxia.",

After emergency defibrillation, conventional treatment options included long-term hospitalization for later cardioverter-defibrillator implantation, or installation of an external defibrillator with subsequent home telemetry. On the basis of the infant's body dimensions, we decided that an epicardial implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was feasible and the best option. We performed a median sternotomy and placed a Vitality\u00ae implantable cardioverter-defibrillator with a 25-cm defibrillator coil and a 35-cm bipolar ventricular lead.

    "185": "Contraction of airway smooth muscle (ASM) plays an important role in the regulation of air flow and is potentially involved in the pathophysiology of certain respiratory diseases. Extracellular nucleotides regulate ASM contraction via purinergic receptors, but the signaling mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Uridine adenosine tetraphosphate (Up(4)A) contains both pyrimidine and purine moieties, which are known to potentially activate P2X and P2Y receptors. Both P2X and P2Y receptors have been identified in the lung, including airway epithelial cells and ASM. We report here a study of purinergic signaling in the respiratory system, with a focus on the effect of Up(4)A on ASM contraction. Up(4)A induced contraction of rat isolated trachea and extrapulmonary bronchi as well as human intrapulmonary bronchioles. Up(4)A-induced contraction was blocked by di-inosine pentaphosphate, a P2X antagonist, but not by suramin, a nonselective P2 antagonist. Up(4)A-induced contraction was also attenuated by \u03b1,\u03b2-methylene-ATP-mediated P2X receptor desensitization. Several P2X receptors were detected at the mRNA level: P2X1, P2X4, P2X6, and P2X7, and to a lesser extent P2X3. Furthermore, the Up(4)A response was inhibited by removal of extracellular Ca(2+) and by the presence of the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, nifedipine, or the Rho-associated kinase inhibitor, H1152. We conclude that Up(4)A stimulates ASM contraction, and the underlying signaling mechanism appears to involve P2X (most likely P2X1) receptors, extracellular Ca(2+) entry via L-type Ca(2+) channels, and Ca(2+) sensitization through the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase pathway.

Carvedilol has been the most effective beta-blocker in the treatment of the systolic heart failure. Carvedilol is a non-selective \u03b2- and \u03b1-blocker enantiomer with antioxidant effects that are attributed to its carbazole moiety.

The latter carry specific IgE antibodies on their surface. If mast cells get activated, mediators (mainly histamine) are released which induce a visible skin reaction (wheal and erythema).[nl]Skin tests are indicated, if an immediate type allergic disease is suspected. Systemic anaphylactic reactions at skin testing are very rare. However, it is necessary to take them into account and to provide emergency treatment. Relative contraindications comprise skin diseases in the test area, poor general condition and insufficiently treated severe asthma. If tests are used, which have a higher risk for a systemic anaphylactic reaction, pregnancy or beta-blocker therapy, are further contraindications.[nl]Skin test application does not depend on patient age. However, in pre-school age tests are reluctantly performed. It is essential to consider the half-life of drugs which may interfere with the test result, and which have to be discontinued early enough before testing. After anaphylactic reactions there may be a refractory period. Therefore, tests should not be done within the first week after such reactions. Skin prick tests are the procedures of first choice, intradermal tests are more sensitive than prick tests. Skin tests are performed at the flexor side of the forearm. As intradermal tests are more inconvenient, testing can be also done at a less susceptible site of the body (upper back).[nl]It is recommended to use standardized test extracts. However, if standardised extracts are not available or do not yield suitable test results, one may switch to other preparations. If the patient shows a positive reaction to a non-standardized substance, control tests should be performed in healthy subjects in order to exclude an unspecific reaction.[nl]The reaction is read after 15 to 20 min. Skin tests are regarded positive if the mean wheal diameter is \u2265 3 mm at the prick test, and \u2265 5 mm at the intradermal test.[nl]Skin test results may be negative although patients are allergic.

It is known that \u03b2-adrenoblockers used separately decrease platelet aggregation and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce P-selectin expression as well. Low-molecular-weight heparin decreases the concentrations of prothrombin fragments, D-dimers; orally administered anticoagulants reduce the concentrations of interleukin 6, von Willebrand factor, intercellular adhesion molecules, fibrinogen 1+2 and increases the concentration of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Both anticoagulants reduce the levels of VII:C factors and thrombin-antithrombin III complex. The use of aspirin together with clopidogrel reduces the concentration of intercellular adhesion and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecules and expression of P-selectins; however, these concentrations do not vary while using aspirin alone. The treatment with ACE inhibitors together with calcium antagonists and \u03b2-adrenoblockers decreases activated partial thromboplastin time, concentrations of D-dimers, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, vascular cell adhesion molecules, CD63 and expression of L- and P-selectins. While analyzing the effect of abovementioned agents, it is necessary to mention that data reported by different authors are not consistent.

The encoded proteins of 402 (\u03b2(1)AR), 397 (\u03b2(2)AR) and 434 (\u03b2(3)AR) amino acids were homologous to other vertebrate \u03b2ARs, and displayed the characteristic seven transmembrane helices of G Protein-coupled receptors. Motifs and amino acids shown to be important for ligand binding were conserved in the fathead minnow receptors. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed the expression of all receptors to be highest in the heart and lowest in the ovary. However, the \u03b2(1)AR was the predominant subtype in the heart (70%), and \u03b2(3)AR the predominant subtype in the ovary (53%). In the brain, \u03b2(1)AR expression was about 200-fold higher than that of \u03b2(2)- and \u03b2(3)AR, whereas in the liver, \u03b2(2)AR expression was about 20-fold and 100-fold higher than \u03b2(3)- and \u03b2(1)AR expression, respectively. Receptor gene expression was modulated by exposure to propranolol (0.001-1mg/L) for 21 days, but not in a consistent, concentration-related manner. These results show that the fathead minnow has a beta-adrenergic receptor repertoire similar to that of mammals, with the molecular signatures required for ligand binding. An exogenous ligand, the beta-blocker propranolol, is able to alter the expression profile of these receptors, although the functional relevance of such changes remains to be determined.

    "248": "Acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) is a primary acid sensor in the peripheral and central nervous system. It has been implicated as a novel therapeutic target for a broad range of pathophysiological conditions including pain, ischemic stroke, depression, and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. The only known selective blocker of ASIC1a is \u03c0-TRTX-Pc1a (PcTx1), a disulfide-rich 40-residue peptide isolated from spider venom. \u03c0-TRTX-Pc1a is an effective analgesic in rodent models of acute pain and it provides neuroprotection in a mouse model of ischemic stroke. Thus, understanding the molecular basis of the \u03c0-TRTX-Pc1a-ASIC1a interaction should facilitate development of therapeutically useful ASIC1a blockers. We therefore developed an efficient bacterial expression system to produce a panel of \u03c0-TRTX-Pc1a mutants for probing structure-activity relationships as well as isotopically labeled toxin for determination of its solution structure and dynamics. We demonstrate that the toxin pharmacophore resides in a \u03b2-hairpin loop that was revealed to be mobile over a wide range of time scales using molecular dynamics simulations in combination with NMR spin relaxation and relaxation dispersion measurements. The toxin-receptor interaction was modeled by in silico docking of the toxin structure onto a homology model of rat ASIC1a in a restraints-driven approach that was designed to take account of the dynamics of the toxin pharmacophore and the consequent remodeling of side-chain conformations upon receptor binding. The resulting model reveals new insights into the mechanism of action of \u03c0-TRTX-Pc1a and provides an experimentally validated template for the rational design of therapeutically useful \u03c0-TRTX-Pc1a mimetics.",

Here we analyze the effect of fasting duration on levels of BG to determine the minimal fasting duration to achieve comparable BG levels to conventional fasting measurements. We used data of a cross-sectional study on primary care patients, performed in October 2005. We included 28,024 individuals (age-range 18-99 years; 63% women) without known diabetes mellitus and without missing data for BG and fasting status. We computed general linear models, adjusting for age, sex, time of blood withdrawal, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, total- and HDL-cholesterol, physical activity, smoking, intake of beta-blocker and alcohol. We tested the intra-individual variability with respect to fasting status. Overall, the mean BG differed only slightly between individuals fasting \u2265 8 h and those fasting <8 h (men: 5.1 \u00b1 0.8 mmol/L versus 5.2 \u00b1 1.2 mmol/L; women: 4.9 \u00b1 0.7 mmol/L, 5.0 \u00b1 1.0 mmol/L). After 3 h of fasting differences of BG diminished in men to -0.08 mmol/L (95%-CI: -0.15; -0.01 mmol/L), in women to -0.07 mmol/L (-0.12; -0.03 mmol/L) compared to individuals fasting \u2265 8 h. Noteworthy, age, time of day of blood withdrawal, physical activity, and intake of hard liquor influenced BG levels considerably. Our data challenge the necessity for a fasting duration of \u2265 8 h when measuring blood glucose, suggesting a random sampling or a fasting duration of 3 h as sufficient. Rather, our study indicates that essentially more effort on the assessment of additional external/internal factors on BG levels is necessary.", 
    "251": "Reducing stress is important in preventing sudden death in patients with cardiovascular disease, as stressful events may cause autonomic imbalance and trigger fatal arrhythmias. Since chewing has been shown to inhibit stress-induced neuronal responses in the hypothalamus, we hypothesized that chewing could ameliorate stress-induced autonomic imbalance and prevent arrhythmias. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed changes in radiotelemetered electrocardiograms in rats that were allowed to chew a wooden stick during a 1-h period of immobilization stress. Chewing significantly reduced the occurrence of ventricular premature beats (VPBs) and complex ventricular ectopy after immobilization and prevented stress-induced prolongation of the QT interval of VPBs throughout the 10-h experimental period. It also prevented prolongation of the QRS complex and fluctuations in the QT interval in normal sinus rhythm beats preceding VPBs during both immobilization and in the poststress period. Fast Fourier transform-based spectral analysis of heart-rate variability further showed that chewing significantly inhibited the stress-induced increase in the power ratio of low-to-high frequency activity (LF/HF: a marker of sympathetic activity) during immobilization and in addition was associated with blunting of the stress-induced increase in plasma noradrenaline observed at the termination of immobilization. Similar suppressive effects on the occurrence of VPBs and the LF/HF were observed in rats that were administered the \u03b2-adrenergic blocker propranolol before immobilization. These results indicate that chewing can ameliorate sympathetic hyperactivity during stress and prevent poststress arrhythmias and suggest that chewing may provide a nonpharmacological and cost-effective treatment option for patients with a high risk of stress-induced fatal arrhythmia.",

In both states, we found that CH/\u03c0 hydrogen bonds were present. Subtle changes in the binding pocket between the active and inactive states of \u03b2(2)AR were observed. Comparison of the CH/\u03c0 networks in both states suggests that the networks differ at the \u03b2(2)AR core. Recombination of the CH/\u03c0 hydrogen bonds occurred during conversion between the two states. We suggest that CH/\u03c0 hydrogen bonds play a key role in ligand recognition and conversion between the active and inactive states."
