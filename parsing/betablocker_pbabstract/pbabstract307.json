With the use of a tethering system, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse interval (PI) were continuously recorded for periods up to 3 wk in Swiss mice. The day-to-day variation of MAP and PI was stable from 5 days after surgery. Within each mouse (n = 9), MAP and PI varied by 21+/-6 mm Hg and 17+/-4 ms around their respective 24-h averages (97+/-3 mm Hg and 89+/-3 ms). Over 24-h periods, MAP and PI were bimodally distributed and clustered around two preferential states. Short-term variability of MAP and PI was compared between the resting (control) and active states using spectral analysis. In resting conditions, variability of MAP was mainly confined to frequencies <1 Hz, whereas variability of PI was predominantly linked to the respiration cycle (3-6 Hz). In the active state, MAP power increased in the 0.08- to 3-Hz range, whereas PI power fell in the 0.08- to 0.4-Hz range. In both conditions, coherence between MAP and PI was high at 0.4 Hz with MAP leading the PI fluctuations by 0.3-0.4 s, suggesting that reflex coupling between MAP and PI occurred at the same frequency range as in rats. Short-term variability of MAP and PI was studied after intravenous injection of autonomic blockers. Compared with the resting control state, MAP fell and PI increased after ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium. Comparable responses of MAP were obtained with the alpha-blocker prazosin, whereas the beta-blocker metoprolol increased PI similarly. Muscarinic blockade with atropine did not significantly alter steady-state levels of MAP and PI. Both hexamethonium and prazosin decreased MAP variability in the 0.08- to 1-Hz range. In contrast, after hexamethonium and metoprolol, PI variability increased in the 0.4- to 3-Hz range. Atropine had no effect on MAP fluctuations but decreased those of PI in the 0.08- to 1-Hz range. These data indicate that, in mice, blood pressure and its variability are predominantly under sympathetic control, whereas both vagal and sympathetic nerves control PI variability. Blockade of endogenous nitric oxide formation by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester increased MAP variability specifically in the 0.08- to 0.4-Hz range, suggesting a role of nitric oxide in buffering blood pressure fluctuations.", 
    "1": "Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated that the very low-frequency (VLF: 0-0.25 Hz) and low-frequency (LF: 0.25-0.8 Hz) power of arterial pressure variability (APV) are related to vasomotor reactivity in response to control signals from the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) via the sympathetic system in the rat. The present study evaluated the differences in the dynamic property of central vasomotor control between spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Experiments were carried out in 10- to 12-wk-old rats that were anesthetized with continuous infusion of pentobarbital sodium, paralyzed with pancuronium, and maintained on mechanical ventilation. We found that SHR exhibited significantly higher arterial pressure (AP), heart rate (HR), and VLF, LF, and high-frequency (0.8-2.4 Hz) power of APV than WKY under resting state. Broad-band electrical stimulation of the RVLM elicited parallel APV in the VLF and LF ranges in both rat strains. The evoked APV and transfer magnitude of the APV to stimulus spike rate variability (RVLM-AP magnitude) were significantly higher in SHR, especially in the LF range. The response frequency of central vasomotor control, represented by the high-cut frequency of RVLM-AP magnitude, was also extended in SHR. The disparity in RVLM-AP transfer magnitude between SHR and WKY became virtually absent after combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade by phentolamine and propranolol. These results suggest that the dynamic control of RVLM on AP reactivity is enhanced in SHR, in which the adrenergic system may play a major role.", 
    "2": "Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion commonly occurs in critically ill patients and may lead to the development of remote organ injury, frequently involving the lungs. In the present study, alveolar liquid clearance was studied in ventilated, anesthetized rats subjected to 45 min of intestinal ischemia followed by 3 h of reperfusion. An isosmolar 5% albumin solution was instilled into the lungs, and alveolar liquid clearance was measured from the increase in alveolar protein concentration as water was reabsorbed over 45 min. Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion resulted in a 76% increase in alveolar liquid clearance compared with the control value (P < 0.05). The stimulated alveolar liquid clearance seen after intestinal ischemia-reperfusion was not inhibited by propranolol, indicating stimulation through a noncatecholamine-dependent pathway. Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion did not result in increased intracellular cAMP levels. Amiloride inhibited similar fractions in animals subjected to ischemia-reperfusion and control animals. Administration of a neutralizing polyclonal anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody before induction of intestinal ischemia completely inhibited the increased alveolar liquid clearance observed after intestinal ischemia-reperfusion. In conclusion, our results suggest that intestinal ischemia-reperfusion in rats leads to stimulation of alveolar liquid clearance and that this stimulation is mediated, at least in part, by a tumor necrosis factor-alpha-dependent mechanism.", 
    "3": "Behavioural responses which included psychological tests and cold pressor test as a stress test were studied in 20 mild to moderate hypertensives of both sexes, excluding smokers, alcoholics, secondary hypertensives and patients of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Subjects were put on 2 weeks of placebo washout period followed by 6 weeks of treatment with atenolol. Following treatment with atenolol they showed no significant alteration in the scores of psychological tests which included Weschler adult intelligence scale for orientation, while showing significant depression in the rise of heart rate, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure following cold pressor test. On further analysis, the results showed that hypertensives on placebo had lower scores of memory and attention test as compared to normotensive controls. Besides this, hypertensives on placebo had higher rise of heart rate and systolic blood pressure as compared to normotensive controls after cold pressor test.", 
    "4": "New guidelines for managing heart failure urge physicians to identify patients likely to benefit from therapy, obtain an echocardiogram to measure the ejection fraction, and, in patients with systolic dysfunction (i.e., an ejection fraction < or = 40%), institute therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a beta-blocker if at all possible. Digoxin and diuretics can relieve symptoms but do not affect the mortality rate. Spironolactone in low nondiuretic doses may reduce mortality when added to baseline drug regimens. The proper role of angiotensin II receptor blocking agents has yet to be determined.", 
    "5": "Homology models of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) have identified serine 304 as an active-site residue and implicated a putative role for this residue in substrate enantioselectivity and the differential inhibition of enzyme activity by the diastereoisomers quinine and quinidine. The role of serine 304 in selectivity is thought to be achieved through a preferential hydrogen-bond interaction between the hydroxyl group of the residue and one of the stereoisomers of each ligand. We have tested this hypothesis by substituting serine 304 with alanine, a non-hydrogen-bonding residue, and compared the properties of the wild-type and mutant enzymes in microsomes prepared from yeast cells expressing the appropriate cDNA-derived enzyme. The Ser(304)Ala substitution did not alter the enantioselective oxidation of metoprolol; the O-demethylation reaction remained R-(+)-enantioselective (wild-type, R/S, 1.7; mutant, R/S, 1.6), whereas alpha-hydroxylation remained S-(-)-enantioselective (wild-type and mutant, R/S, 0.7). Similarly, the selective oxidation of the R-(+) and S-(-) enantiomers of propranolol to the major 4-hydroxy metabolite was identical with both wild-type and mutant forms of the enzyme (R/S 0.9), although the formation of minor metabolites (5-hydroxy and deisopropylpropranolol) did show some slight alteration in enantioselectivity. The differential inhibition of enzyme activity by quinine and quinidine was also identical with both forms of CYP2D6, the IC(50) values for each enzyme being approx. 10 microM and 0.1 microM for quinine and quinidine, respectively. The kinetics of formation of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol and 4-hydroxydebrisoquine by wild-type and the Ser(304)Ala mutant was also very similar. However, modest changes in the regioselective oxidation of metoprolol and debrisoquine were observed with the Ser(304)Ala mutant. The regio- and enantioselective oxidation of an analogue of metoprolol, in which the hydroxyl group attached to the chiral carbon was replaced by a methyl moiety, was again identical with both wild-type and Ser(304)Ala mutant. However, the observed selectivity was the reverse of that observed with metoprolol. Collectively, these data indicate that Ser(304) is unlikely to be a key ligand-binding residue, although the residue may indeed be located in the active-site cavity. The reversal of selectivity with the methyl analogue of metoprolol indicates that the hydroxyl group attached to the chiral centre of ligands, such as metoprolol, is important in defining the enzyme's selective properties, and that a hydrogen-bonding residue, other than Ser(304), may be involved in this interaction. Current homology models of the active site of CYP2D6 that predict a hydrogen-bond interaction between Ser(304) and specific ligands will need to be re-evaluated, and other candidate residues capable of such an interaction nominated and tested by site-directed mutagenesis studies.", 
    "6": "Except for a small subset of patients with angina whose survival is improved with coronary artery bypass surgery, chronic stable angina can be appropriately managed with medical therapy in the vast majority of patients. Drug therapy includes aspirin, beta-adrenergic blockers, cholesterol-lowering agents and other anti-ischemic drugs that can ameliorate angina and improve the patient's quality of life. Understanding how and when to use these medicines involves knowledge of the mechanisms of these drugs as well as familiarity with the literature supporting their efficacy in various patient populations.", 
    "7": "Continuing advances in the knowledge of the pathophysiology of portal hypertension result in the progressive expansion of the spectrum of drugs with a potential role for clinical practice, with objectives that now tend to include the prevention of the enlargement or even the development of esophageal varices. This systematic review summarizes the evidence of efficacy of drug therapy for portal hypertension and draws recommendations for clinical practice. Although there is not yet enough evidence to support the treatment for the prevention of the development or enlargement of varices, nonselective beta-blockers are the first-choice therapy to prevent the first bleeding in patients with medium or large-sized varices and rebleeding in patients surviving a bleeding episode. The clinical role of isosorbide-5-mononitrate either alone or in association with beta-blockers still remains unsettled. Vasoactive drugs are generally effective and safe in controlling acute variceal bleeding, although the evidence is not equivalent for each of them.", 
    "8": "An original procedure was developed to simultaneously test beta2-agonists (salbutamol and clenbuterol) and beta-blockers (atenolol, acebutolol, pindolol, betaxolol, propranolol, timolol, sotalol, metoprolol, tertatolol, bisoprolol, labetalol and oxprenolol) in both human and animal hair. After decontamination with methylene chloride (2 times, 2 min), a 200 mg hair strand is pulverized in a ball mill. Then, a 100 mg portion is incubated overnight in 2 mL 0.1 N HCl, at 56 degrees C, in the presence of carteolol, which was used as an internal standard. After neutralization of the acid phase with 0.1 N NaOH, a 2 mL bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.6) is added to the preparation, which is then purified by solid-phase extraction with Isolute C18 columns. Drugs are derivatized using a mixture of trimethylboroxine-ethyl acetate for 15 min at 80 degrees C to form methaneboronate derivatives. Drugs are detected using GC/MS on an HP 6890-5973 system. A 4 microL portion of the derivatized extract is injected using a pulsed mode in a 30 m HP5 MS capillary column. Linearity was observed for all compounds in the range 25 pg/mg to 10 ng/mg. Limits of detection were in the range 2 to 10 pg/mg. At 1 ng/mg, recoveries were in the range from 37 to 100%, with a within-run precision of 5.9 to 14.1% (n = 8). The application of the method can be documented by the following examples: (1) Hair from asthmatic patients (n - 11), including two cases of asthma deaths, tested positive for salbutamol in the range of 27 to 210 pg/mg. (2) A 24-year-old swimmer who tested positive in urine for salbutamnol denied the results. Hair analysis confirmed salbutamol exposure, with a concentration of 71 pg/mg. (3) A shooting specialist was assumed to chronically use metoprolol (100 mg/daily during some periods). Hair concentration of metoprolol was 8.41 ng/mg. (4) An archery specialist was assumed to chronically use sotalol (80 mg/daily, during some periods). Hair concentration of sotalol was 261 pg/mg. (5) Hair from two calves revealed chronic exposure to clenbuterol, which was used to increase the mass of the animals at a concentration of 30 and 48 pg/mg.", 
    "9": "We report here four children (three girls, one boy) with head tremor followed longitudinally, ages 15 months to 11 years, with follow-up over 1 to 8 years. Each demonstrated onset of head tremor between the ages of 5 and 10 months. In each case head tremor was characterized by a predominant \"yes-yes\" or \"no-no\" movement of the head. In two of the children the movement was slightly skewed with chin movement toward the shoulder. Oscillations were at a frequency of about 1 to 2 Hz. They were accentuated when sitting upright without head support, increased at times of movement, and dissipated while lying flat or sleeping. The children were unable to voluntarily suppress the action and did not experience any sensation of movement. Three of the children had shuddering spells prior to onset of head tremor. Two children have developed mild dystonic posturing of the legs when intently concentrating. Their general and neurologic examinations were normal. Normal investigations included brain magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, urine amino acids and organic acids screening, serum lactate, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibodies, and ceruloplasmin and copper levels. A family history of tremor was present in two children, maternal epilepsy in one child, and infantile shuddering occurred in the father of one child. Therapy included trials of selective and nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers, alpha-adrenergic agonists, anticholinergics, anticonvulsants, and amantadine. One child responded well to both timolol and trihexyphenidyl. A second child responded moderately to primidone. Two have not been treated. Two have had head tremor spontaneously remit. We conclude from this small series of children with head tremor that it can evolve from a prior history of shuddering spells, occurs in the context of a positive family history of tremor, and can be accompanied by the development of a mild dystonia. Therapeutic response is variable to multiple agents. Spontaneous remission occurs, suggesting a benign course.", 
    "10": "Roxindole, a DA D2 receptor agonist (2-16 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent increase in percentage antinociception. The effect which was blocked by DA D2 antagonist (-)sulpiride (50 mg/kg) and 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (-) pindolol (5 mg/kg). Roxindole (4 and 8 mg/kg) reversed both naloxone (20 mg/kg)-induced hyperalgesia and reserpine (2 mg/kg)-induced hyperalgesia. This reversal was sensitive to blockade by both (-)sulpiride (50 mg/kg) and (-) pindolol (5 mg/kg). The present study suggests that roxindole-induced antinociception is mediated by postsynaptic DA D2 and 5-HT1A receptors.", 
    "11": "Stimulation of perivascular nerve terminals leads to a release of various neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, epinephrine, acetylcholine, nitric oxide, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Because some of these substances have been shown to cause smooth muscle hyperpolarization by direct or endothelium-dependent mechanisms, we hypothesized that the liberation of 1 or more of these transmitters may lead to neurogenic hyperpolarization in arterial muscle cells. The present study was designed to determine the presence or absence of neurogenic hyperpolarization and, if present, its underlying mechanisms in isolated rat mesenteric resistance arteries, through the use of conventional microelectrode techniques. The experiments were performed under the combined blockade of alpha-adrenoceptors and purinoceptors with phentolamine and suramin to eliminate depolarizing responses to nerve stimulation. Under these conditions, perivascular nerve stimulation (5 Hz, 30 seconds) evoked smooth muscle hyperpolarization (-3.3+/-0.3 mV, n=15), which was abolished by tetrodotoxin, indicating the neurogenic origin of the response. This neurogenic hyperpolarization was resistant to atropine, nitro-L-arginine, or CGRP8-37, a CGRP antagonist, but was abolished by guanethidine and beta-blocker propranolol. This hyperpolarization was also abolished by glibenclamide, an ATP-sensitive K(+) channel (K(ATP)) blocker, but was unaffected by apamin, a Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel blocker. In separate experiments, exogenous norepinephrine caused glibenclamide-sensitive hyperpolarization in the presence of phentolamine. On the other hand, norepinephrine-induced depolarization in the absence of phentolamine was enhanced by propranolol. These findings suggest that neurally released catecholamines cause membrane hyperpolarization through the activation of K(ATP) by beta-adrenoceptors. Such hyperpolarization may play an important role in the control of arterial membrane potential by opposing alpha-adrenergic depolarization.", 
    "12": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays an important role in cardiac remodeling through stimulation of proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) production in cardiac fibroblasts. Integrins are a family of transmembrane receptors that mediate the attachment of cells to ECM. We hypothesized that Ang II regulation of integrins further contributes to its role in cardiac remodeling. We cultured adult rat cardiac fibroblasts with and without Ang II (100 nmol/L) to determine the effects on mRNA and protein levels of integrins, as well as alpha-actinin and other cytoskeletal proteins that link to integrins at the site of focal adhesions. Ang II was also added in the presence of irbesartan (10 micromol/L), a specific Ang II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonist, or PD 123319 (10 micromol/L), a specific Ang II type 2 receptor antagonist. To investigate the function of these integrins, we determined the effects of blocking antibodies on Ang II-induced adhesion to ECM. We also treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with an AT(1) receptor blocker, losartan, or with hydralazine to investigate integrin and alpha-actinin expression in treated and untreated SHR. Ang II enhanced alpha(v), beta(1), beta(3), and beta(5) integrins; osteopontin; and alpha-actinin mRNA and protein levels in cardiac fibroblasts. All of these effects were inhibited by irbesartan but not by PD 123319. Pretreatment of cardiac fibroblasts with Ang II enhanced cell attachment to ECM proteins and induced focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation. Blocking antibodies to beta(3) and alpha(v)beta(5) attenuated Ang II-induced adhesion. In SHR, ventricular alpha(v) and beta(5) integrin expression and alpha-actinin were increased compared with those in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Although both losartan and hydralazine lowered mean arterial pressure and decreased peripheral vascular resistance, only losartan attenuated the increased integrin, alpha-actinin, fibronectin laminin, and osteopontin expression and the increased left ventricular mass (as determined with echocardiography). Hydralzine had none of these effects. Although both agents attenuated beta-myosin heavy chain expression, a marker of hypertrophy, losartan had a greater effect. These results suggest that integrins and alpha-actinin are upregulated by Ang II and in left ventricular hypertrophy and that the block of expression of these proteins through inhibition of the AT(1) receptor is associated with attenuation of the hypertrophic response. Ang II induces integrin and alpha-actinin expression in cardiac fibroblasts that is associated with adhesion and left ventricular hypertrophy and blocked through inhibition of the AT(1) receptor.", 
    "13": "beta(1)-Integrins play an important role for adhesion and spreading of human smooth muscle cells. In the present study we examined the influence of angiotensin II and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB on beta(1)-integrin-dependent functions of human smooth muscle cells obtained from iliac arteries. Treatment of these cells with PDGF-BB (20 ng/mL) and Angiotensin II (1 micromol/L) did not change beta(1)-integrin expression up to 48 hours as analyzed by flow cytometry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. beta(1)-integrins predominantly mediated adhesion of human smooth muscle cells to collagen I (79.7+/-4.4%, P<0.01) and fibronectin (66. 6+/-2.4%, P<0.01). Treatment of smooth muscle cells with Angiotensin II (1 micromol/L) and PDGF-BB (20 ng/mL) significantly increased the adhesion to collagen I by 56.5% and 44.3%, respectively, and to fibronectin by 49.6% and 36.4%, respectively (all P<0.05). Angiotensin II-induced effects were mediated by the AT(1) receptor. The PDGF-BB mediated increase of adhesion was inhibited in the presence of genestein, a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor and by protein kinase C downregulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Spreading of smooth muscle cells also was beta(1)-integrin dependent on collagen I and alpha(5)beta(1)-integrin dependent on fibronectin. Angiotensin II and PDGF-BB increased cell spreading on fibronectin up to 276% and 318%, respectively, and on collagen I up to 133% and 138% (all P<0.05). These increases were significantly inhibited by blocking antibodies against beta(1)-integrin, alpha(5)-integrin on fibronectin, the AT(1) receptor blocker irbesartan, and genestein. The present data demonstrate that angiotensin II and as well PDGF-BB enhance beta(1)-integrin-dependent adhesion and spreading of human vascular smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, the experiments with PDGF suggest an involvement of protein kinase C activation leading to these enhanced effects.", 
    "14": "beta-Blockers are widely used for hypertension treatment but must be taken daily. We have developed a novel beta-blocker by targeting beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)-AR) mRNA with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (beta(1)-AS-ODN). A single intravenous injection of beta(1)-AS-ODN significantly reduced cardiac contractility and blood pressure (38+/-5 mm Hg, P<0.05) in spontaneously hypertensive rats for 3 weeks. In the present study, we improved the antihypertensive effect of beta(1)-AS-ODN by delivery with the cationic liposomes DOTAP/DOPE and studied its impact on the peripheral renin-angiotensin system. Five charge ratios (+/-) of liposome/ODN from 0 to 3.5 were tested to deliver 0. 5 mg/kg beta(1)-AS-ODN intravenously in spontaneously hypertensive rats (n=30). On the basis of the magnitude and duration of hypotension, 2.5 was determined to be the optimal charge ratio, which decreased blood pressure by up to 35 mm Hg for 20 to 33 days (P<0.05). The effects were specific for beta(1)-AR, because radioligand binding assay and quantitative autoradiography showed a 35% reduction in beta(1)-AR levels in kidney but no change in beta(2)-AR. beta(1)-AS-ODN diminished the preprorenin mRNA levels in renal cortex by 37% 4 days after administration. This transient effect was followed by a delayed yet marked diminution of plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin II levels on days 10 and 17 (P<0.01). The results show that beta(1)-AS-ODN has an effective long-term antihypertensive effect up to 33 days with a single intravenous injection. The mechanism appears to be through reduced beta(1)-AR number specifically and reduced cardiac contractility. The inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is probably a second mechanism to produce the sustained antihypertensive effect of beta(1)-AS-ODN.", 
    "15": "Prior studies have demonstrated that sympathetic tone may influence the effects of adenosine on His-Purkinje automaticity, and that enhanced vagal tone may influence its effects on the sinus node. However, the interaction between autonomic tone and the effects of adenosine on the sinus node in humans remains unknown. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the interaction between different states of autonomic tone and the bradycardiac response of the sinus node to adenosine. In 11 patients without structural heart disease who underwent a clinically indicated electrophysiology procedure, the sinus cycle length was measured before and after a 12-mg bolus of adenosine in the baseline state, during an infusion of 2 mcg/min of isoproterenol, after the administration of 0.2 mg/kg of propranolol, and again after the administration of 0.04 mg/kg of atropine. Adenosine significantly lengthened the sinus cycle length in the baseline state (760 +/- 165 vs 909 +/- 188 ms, P < 0.05), during isoproterenol infusion (516 +/- 67 vs 766 +/- 146 ms, P < 0.05), after propranolol (850 +/- 153 vs 914 +/- 143 ms, P < 0.05) and after the combination of propranolol and atropine (662 +/- 76 vs 801 +/- 121 ms, P < 0.05). The degree of lengthening in sinus cycle length was significantly greater (P < 0.05) during isoproterenol infusion (253 +/- 157 ms, or 51% +/- 40%) than in the baseline state (149 +/- 85 ms, or 20% +/- 12%), after propranolol (68 +/- 53 ms, or 8% +/- 8%), and after propranolol and atropine (140 +/- 110 ms, or 21% +/- 18%). The negative chronotropic effect of adenosine is influenced by autonomic tone. The effect of adenosine on the sinus node is accentuated by beta-adrenergic stimulation and unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade or combined beta-adrenergic and cholinergic blockade.", 
    "16": "At present, the use of calcium antagonists for the secondary prevention of cardiac events following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) is not recommended. This advice is based on several large mortality studies using short-acting calcium antagonists in the absence of coronary reperfusion therapy. Even in these studies, discrepancies between the different pharmacological classes of calcium antagonists were recognised. When separated from the dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, the rate-lowering calcium antagonists, verapamil and diltiazem, do appear to provide some benefit in reduction of recurrent MI. Three large trials using verapamil post-MI demonstrated a significant reduction in reinfarction with a favourable trend towards reducing death as well. Similarly, the effects of diltiazem post-MI have been evaluated in 3 large trials. In 2 earlier trials, diltiazem lessened cardiac events in patients with nonQ-wave infarctions and those without pulmonary congestion upon presentation. Overall, there was a significant benefit in lessening reinfarction with no effect on mortality. The recently completed Incomplete Infarction Trial of European Research Collaborators Evaluating Prognosis Post-Infarction (INTERCEPT) trial found that sustained-release diltiazem given after thrombolytic therapy for acute MI lessened cardiac events by 23% (a nonsignificant difference) without worsening congestive symptoms. Overall, there is adequate data to support the use of heart-rate-lowering calcium antagonists for secondary prevention post-MI provided the patient is intolerant of beta-blocker therapy. These trials are reviewed in detail, and suggestions for clinical practice are provided in this article.", 
    "17": "Nebivolol is a recently developed beta-blocker provided with vasodilator properties. Because the mechanism of the putative endothelium-dependent effect of this beta-adrenoceptor blocker has not been completely elucidated, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of nebivolol on an isolated resistance vascular bed and on cell messengers and constitutive nitric-oxide synthase activity (cNOS) in endothelial cells. Experiments were carried out using the rat mesenteric vascular bed and cultured bovine coronary postcapillary venular endothelial cells from bovine heart (CVEC). In mesenteric vascular bed preconstricted by 30 microM noradrenaline and 0.3 microM U46619, dl-nebivolol induced a concentration-dependent relaxing effect at concentrations between 3 and 30 microM; this effect was changed to a concentration-dependent vasoconstrictor response either in endothelium-denuded preparations or in intact preparations pretreated with 100 microM N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester plus 3 microM indomethacin. The vasorelaxant effect of dl-nebivolol in preconstricted preparations was completely blocked by pretreatment either with the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 (1 microM) or with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (1 microM) for 30 min. The cellular level of the inositol trisphosphate metabolite inositol monophosphate in coronary postcapillary venular endothelial cells was not affected by dl-nebivolol in the concentration range 100 nM to 1 microM, but it was concentration dependently increased after exposure for 15 min to 10 and 30 microM dl-nebivolol. The activity of cNOS was almost doubled after a 5-min exposure to 10 microM dl-nebivolol and was significantly impaired by thapsigargin and N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester treatment, although it was unaffected by N(omega)-nitro-D-arginine methyl ester. These findings demonstrate that nebivolol, in micromolar concentrations, induces vasorelaxation through activation of inositol phosphate metabolism and stimulation of cNOS activity in endothelial cells.", 
    "18": "At supratherapeutic doses (2- to 5-fold), the T-type Ca(2+) antagonist mibefradil modifies the T/U wave of the human ECG. In this study, we show that this effect is observed in conscious monkeys and is duplicated by verapamil or diltiazem. We then evaluate the proarrhythmic risk of such alterations of cardiac repolarization by examining the actions of mibefradil on cardiac action potentials (APs). In isolated cardiomyocytes from guinea pigs or humans, mibefradil dose dependently shortens the plateau of the AP; this effect is similar to other Ca(2+) antagonists and opposite to drugs having class III antiarrhythmic properties. The metabolites of mibefradil, singly or in combination, also shorten APs. In isolated rabbit hearts, noncardiodepressant concentrations of mibefradil have no effect on monophasic action potentials (MAPs), whereas cardiodepressant levels produce a slight nonsignificant lengthening. In hearts of open-chest bradycardic dogs, mibefradil has no effect on MAP dispersion or on QT interval and shortens MAPs slightly; although high doses produce atrioventricular block, likely through Ca(2+) antagonism, arrhythmias are never observed. In contrast, d-sotalol lengthens QT interval and MAPs, increases dispersion, and produces arrhythmias. Together, these in vitro and in vivo results suggest that mibefradil carries no proarrhythmic risk despite changes in T/U wave morphology. Although these changes resemble those observed with class III compounds, they also are seen with nonproarrhythmic compounds such as verapamil and diltiazem. In conclusion, the classical models used in the present study could not link the changes in T/U wave morphology produced by mibefradil and verapamil to any experimental marker of proarrhythmic liability.", 
    "19": "Recent investigations have shown that antihypertensive drug treatment leads to enhanced myocardial beta-adrenoceptor sensitivity. This study was therefore conducted to establish whether or not such hypersensitivity might trigger myocardial arrhythmia subsequent to adrenaline exposure. Adult male Wistar rats (n = 6 per group) were treated with either placebo (vehicle), metoprolol (2.40 mg.kg-1.day-1), timolol (0.075 mg.kg-1.day-1), verapamil (5.50 mg.kg-1.day-1) or enalapril (0.50 mg.kg-1.day-1) for 20 consecutive days. Hearts were excised and perfused ad modum Langendorff in the presence of an adrenaline gradient (0-300 nM) for 20 min with either 3.0 mM or 5.9 mM of potassium in the perfusion buffer. Adrenaline threshold concentration (ATC, nanomolar) at myocardial fibrillation was recorded, as well as tissue cAMP contents, beta-adrenoceptor number, G-protein levels and signalling effector enzyme activities. The main findings were: (1) ATC and cAMP levels were affected in hearts perfused with low-concentration potassium buffer only. In terms of ATC, the beneficial effect of each drug regimen appeared to be in the rank order of: placebo = enalapril > verapamil > timolol > metoprolol. There was an inverse correlation between ATC and myocardial cAMP contents at the start of fibrillation; (2) Subsequent to fibrillation, beta-adrenoceptor number, hormone-elicited adenylate cyclase activities and Gs alpha:Gi2 alpha-ratio were no different from preperfusion values; (3) Significant inverse correlations between beta 1-adrenoceptor numbers and ATC were observed. We conclude that alterations in beta-adrenoceptor number, G proteins and cAMP induced by antihypertensive drugs are predictive of the myocardial sensitivity to adrenaline in terms of time to continuous and irrevocable fibrillation.",

Treatment with ADM (5 mg/kg) or VCR (3 mg/kg) alone, as well as with AR-1, AR-2 or AR-3 (50 mg/kg) alone, had no effect on tumor growth.

Tests of antagonism of stimulus control were conducted using the 5-HT1A antagonists (+/-)-pindolol and WAY-100635, and the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist pirenperone. In rats trained with 5-MeO-DMT, pindolol and WAY-100635 both produced a significant degree of antagonism of stimulus control, but pirenperone was much less effective. Likewise, the full generalization of 5-MeO-DMT to the selective 5-HT1A agonist [+/-]-8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin was blocked by WAY-100635, but unaffected by pirenperone. In contrast, the partial generalization of 5-MeO-DMT to the 5-HT2 agonist DOM was completely antagonized by pirenperone, but was unaffected by WAY-100635. Similarly, in rats trained with (-)-DOM, pirenperone completely blocked stimulus control, but WAY-100635 was inactive. The results obtained in rats trained with (-)-DOM and tested with 5-MeO-DMT were more complex. Although the intraperitoneal route had been used for both training drugs, a significant degree of generalization of (-)-DOM to 5-MeO-DMT was seen only when the latter drug was administered subcutaneously. Furthermore, when the previously effective dose of pirenperone was given in combination with 5-MeO-DMT (s.c.), complete suppression of responding resulted. However, the combination of pirenperone and WAY-100635 given prior to 5-MeO-DMT restored responding in (-)-DOM-trained rats, and provided evidence of antagonism of the partial substitution of 5-MeO-DMT for (-)-DOM. The present data indicate that 5-MeO-DMT-induced stimulus control is mediated primarily by interactions with 5-HT1A receptors. In addition, however, the present findings suggest that 5-MeO-DMT induces a compound stimulus that includes an element mediated by interactions with a 5-HT2 receptors. The latter component is not essential for 5-MeO-DMT-induced stimulus control, but is revealed in animals tested or trained with a 5-HT2-selective agonist such as (-)-DOM. Based upon the present data, we conclude that 5-MeO-DMT differs from DOM with respect to the serotonergic element that mediates stimulus control in the rat, but that it shares with DOM a functionally significant interaction with 5-HT2 receptors.", 
    "38": "Hormone-sensitive lipase catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the release of fatty acids from triacylglycerol-rich lipid storage droplets of adipocytes, which contain the body's major energy reserves. Hormonal stimulation of cAMP formation and the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase leads to the phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase and a large increase in lipolysis in adipocytes. By contrast, phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase by the kinase in vitro results in a comparatively minor increase in catalytic activity. In this study, we investigate the basis for this discrepancy by using immunofluorescence microscopy to locate hormone-sensitive lipase in lipolytically stimulated and unstimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In unstimulated cells, hormone-sensitive lipase is diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol. Upon stimulation of cells with the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, hormone-sensitive lipase translocates from the cytosol to the surfaces of intracellular lipid droplets concomitant with the onset of lipolysis, as measured by the release of glycerol to the culture medium. Both hormone-sensitive lipase translocation and lipolysis are reversed by the incubation of cells with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol. The treatment of cells with cycloheximide fails to inhibit lipase translocation or lipolysis, indicating that the synthesis of nascent proteins is not required. Cytochalasin D and nocodazole used singly and in combination also failed to have a major effect, thus suggesting that the polymerization of microfilaments and microtubules and the formation of intermediate filament networks is unnecessary. Hormone-sensitive lipase translocation and lipolysis were inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide and a combination of deoxyglucose and sodium azide. We propose that the major consequence of the phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase following the lipolytic stimulation of adipocytes is the translocation of the lipase from the cytosol to the surfaces of lipid storage droplets.",

In ventricular tissue, at 35-36 degrees C, phenylephrine, in the presence of propranolol, produced a sustained negative inotropic response with no change in the time course of contraction and relaxation. These effects were greatly reduced at 22-23 degrees C. Isoproterenol produced marked positive inotropic responses accompanied by shortening of the time required for relaxation. In isolated ventricular myocytes, phenylephrine, in the presence of propranolol, significantly increased the L-type Ca2+ channel current (I(Ca)) at 35-36 degrees C, but the effect was small at 22-23 degrees C. Isoproterenol increased I(Ca) similarly at both temperatures.

    "57": "Calcitonin, one of the calcium-regulating hormones, is known to have diverse biological effects including those on the gastrointestinal tract. In this organ, the hormone is reported to inhibit gastric acid secretion, gastric motility, and gastrin secretion and to stimulate release of somatostatin, thereby exerting antiulcer and antilesion effects on stress-induced as well as other types of experimental gastric ulcers or lesions. This fact prompted us to examine changes in serum calcitonin concentration during the development of stress-induced gastric lesions in rats. DA rats were constrained in a stress cage after a 24-h fast and then immersed in 24 degrees C water to the level of the xiphoid process for 2 or 5 h. Serum calcitonin concentrations in stressed rats were significantly lower than those in control rats. To investigate the mechanism of the decline in serum calcitonin level under stress in these rats, we conducted a time-course study of serum calcitonin concentration and ionized calcium level during water-immersion stress, lasting 2 h, and during 4 h following release from the stress. Water immersion caused a remarkable decrease in serum calcitonin concentration as early as at 30 min. After release from stress, serum calcitonin concentration gradually recovered. The ionized calcium level in the blood did not change significantly throughout the experimental period. Furthermore, to examine if the sympathetic nerve system was involved in the stress-induced change of serum calcitonin concentration, alpha- and beta-receptor antagonists were administered intraperitoneally before stress exposure. Administration of alpha-receptor antagonist at a low dose that did not have any effect on serum calcitonin concentration in a preliminary study, restored the decline of serum calcitonin level, whereas beta-receptor antagonist did not. These results suggest that stress-provoked decrease of serum calcitonin concentration may be mediated not by a change of ionized calcium level but by alteration of sympathetic nerve activity (particularly via the alpha-receptor).",

The reactions are carried out in buffered aqueous solution. The quantum yield of the CL from the copper ion/H2O2 system is increased by a factor of 2(-10) in the presence of carazolol. The CL spectra from the carazolol/copper ion/H2O2 system are spread through the full visible region and four emission bands are shown at maxima 480-500, 580, 640 and 700 nm. The excitation spectrum obtained from the above mentioned system shows the main maxima at around 273, 310 and 340 nm (lambda obs = 365 nm).

    "64": "In order to find some treatments for respiratory failure caused by pulmonary edema, we investigated the mechanism of neurogenic pulmonary edema. Previously, stimulation of sympathetic nerves caused an increase in pulmonary vascular permeability, possibly due to neuropeptide Y. Neuropeptide Y injected into the trachea increased lung vascular permeability dose-dependently, the ED50 of which was 0.3-1 nM. Such an effect remained even after treatment with reserpine, as well as in the presence of alpha- and beta-blockers. And norepinephrine enhanced the effect of neuropeptide Y on lung vascular permeability. These responses were almost similar to those obtained by stimulation of sympathetic nerves. Furthermore, neuropeptide Y, in fibrin-induced pulmonary edema, was localized in alveolar macrophages and alveolar spaces, amounting to approximately 200 nM in edema fluid. The value was significantly greater than that obtained in hydrostatic pulmonary edema by 10-30 times. Peptide YY, an analogue of neuropeptide Y, had no action on lung vascular permeability, whereas the effect of neuropeptide Y was inhibited by pretreatment with neuropeptide Y- 13-36, an antagonist for Y3-recetor subtype. These results suggested that neuropeptide Y enhances the lung vascular permeability via Y3-recetor subtype. Neuropeptide Y- 13-36, in fibrin-induced pulmonary edema, decreased a ratio of protein concentration in edema fluid to that in serum, indicating that neuropeptide Y actually acts a role in the development of neurogenic pulmonary edema, via an increase in lung vascular permeability.", 
    "65": "We deduced the three dimensional structures of transmembrane regions in human beta adrenoceptors by computer simulating using the 2D electron density maps of bacteriorhodopsin and frog rhodopsin as templates. The deduced membrane-spanning helical regions, their arrangements and axes to the membrane plain were different between two models. Typical beta adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, and long-lasting beta antagonist, bopindolol, were docked in these models. The receptor-antagonist interactions were different between both models, in which the 3, 4, 5 and 6th transmembrane domains might participate in the antagonists-binding in both models, however, the amino acid residues in the domains contributing to the binding might be different between models. Propranolol and bopindolol have high affinity to beta 1 and beta 2 subtypes, but low affinity to beta 3 subtype. The simulated receptor-antagonist relationships could account, in part, for the selectivity of the antagonists to the beta subtypes.",

The atypical beta-adrenoceptors are present in gastric fundus, duodenum and ileum of guinea pig. In the presence of propranolol (1 microM) or atenolol (100 microM) plus butoxamine (100 microM), bupranolol caused a concentration-dependent rightward shift of the concentration-response curves for catecholamines and beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists. There was not a significant difference of pA2 values for bupranolol against these agonists between gastric fundus, duodenum and ileum of guinea pig. These results suggest that guinea pig gastric fundus, duodenum and ileum relaxation are mediated predominantly by an atypical beta-adrenoceptor population whereas the classical beta 1- or/and beta 2-adrenoceptors play a subordinate function role and that the receptors of three tissues are pharmacological identified by functional approaches.

A small decrease in IFN-gamma production and an increase in IL-10, IL-4, and IL-5 production were also observed with norepinephrine. Terbutaline induced similar alterations in the type-1/type-2 cytokine balance compared with EPI, indicating that the beta(2)adrenergic receptor is involved in these cytokine alterations. Furthermore, these cytokine alterations were blocked by propranolol. Finally, IL-12p70 prevented the cytokine alterations, suggesting that the mechanism of beta-adrenergic-induced cytokine alterations involves a decrease in IL-12.",

    "72": "The mechanisms of structure selective and enantioselective retentions of amines and acids on two chiral stationary phases based on wild type cellobiohydrolase I (CBH I) and its mutant D214N have been investigated. All the amino alcohols tested had an enantioselective site that overlaps with the catalytically active site of CBH I, whereas the enantioselectivity of prilocaine was not affected by the mutation. The hydroxyl group of the amino alcohols did not seem to be an important contributor to the total binding strength whereas a bromo substituent in the aromatic ring promotes a high enantioselectivity (alpha=7.05). Interestingly, the chiral recognition site of the acid warfarin overlaps with the binding site of the amino alcohols. Di-p-toluoyltartaric acid and dibenzoyltartaric acid were strongly retained probably due to electrostatic attraction, but no enantioselectivity was observed. The difference in retention characteristics for the amino alcohols on the two stationary phases was strongly pH-dependent. A change in elution order of different amino alcohols occurred when changing the pH from 5.0 to 7.0. The difference between the two phases was lower at low pH. The retention times could also be affected by ionic strength and by use of cellobiose as a mobile phase additive but no indication of ion-pair retention of the amines was observed, when adding hexanesulphonate as counter ion to the mobile phase. The temperature dependence of the retention of the enantiomers of propranolol at pH 7.0 on the mutant D214N was similar to what was earlier observed on the wild type CBH I at lower pH.", 
    "73": "To report a case of marked hypotension resulting from the concomitant use of low-dose carvedilol and intravenous dobutamine.", 
    "74": "A 54-year-old white man with severe heart failure was placed on carvedilol 3.125 mg orally twice a day; three days later the dosage was increased to 6.25 mg orally twice a day. His symptoms of heart failure worsened with increasing fluid retention, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. He was admitted for treatment of decompensated heart failure with intravenous dobutamine. With each increase in intravenous dobutamine, systolic blood pressure fell. Dobutamine was discontinued when systolic blood pressure reached 56 mm Hg. In a subsequent admission for decompensated heart failure, when the patient was not taking carvedilol, he was treated with intravenous dobutamine and systolic blood pressure increased.", 
    "75": "Although carvedilol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist, at low doses it is a selective beta1-adrenergic antagonist. Dobutamine is a beta1-, beta2-, and alpha1-adrenergic agonist. Typically, patients with heart failure treated with intravenous dobutamine have a small increase in systolic blood pressure. We propose that the drop in blood pressure with dobutamine in this patient was caused by a fall in systemic vascular resistance due to vascular beta2-adrenergic receptor activation. The normal increase in cardiac output was partially blocked by selective beta1-adrenergic blockade at low doses of carvedilol.", 
    "76": "Beta-adrenergic blockade with carvedilol is now common therapy for patients with congestive heart failure. Intravenous dobutamine is often used when these patients have worsening heart failure. Recognition that treatment with dobutamine in patients taking low doses of carvedilol may result in hypotension is important for appropriate monitoring and therapy.", 
    "77": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of administering bisoprolol compared with nitrendipine on the duration of the exercise tolerated by male and female patients, aged 18-65 years, having mild to moderate hypertension and taking regular exercise. In this double-blind, randomized prospective study, 96 patients (85 men and 11 women, 48+/-10 years) formed two groups: 49 in the bisoprolol group, and 47 in the nitrendipine group. After a washout period of 14 days, either 10 mg of bisoprolol or 20 mg of nitrendipine was given daily over a treatment period of 12 weeks. During the treatment period, the stability of the physical training was monitored weekly by using a questionnaire. The results of two maximal triangular exercise tolerance tests (ETTs) on an ergometric bicycle performed at D0 under placebo and at D84 under active treatment were compared. No statistical difference was observed between both groups, concerning age, gender, morphologic characteristics, resting cardiovascular parameters, or physical training. Both groups maintained the same training level throughout the study. No significant differences between the groups were noted for duration of ETT [D0 892+/-284 s, D84, 919+/-267 s (NS) vs. D0 929+/-290 s, D84 904+/-324 s (NS)], or maximal work load [D0 190+/-49 W, D84 197+/-48 W (NS) vs. D0 198+/-49 W, D84 196+/-55 W (NS)]. On the other hand, both groups differed in maximal systolic blood pressure [D0 239+/-24 mm Hg, D84 215+/-22 mm Hg (p<0.001) vs. D0 237+/-24 mm Hg, D84 222+/-27 mm Hg (p<0.05)] (p = 0.05), and maximal pulse rate during exercise [141+/-18 vs. 163+/-17] (p<0.001), albeit not in maximal diastolic blood pressure [D0 113+/-13 mm Hg, D84 106+/-17 mm Hg (p<0.05) vs. D0 112+/-13 mm Hg, D84 104+/-15 mm Hg (p<0.05)]. The patient's own perception of the maximal effort (Borg scale) was not significantly different in either of the groups (placebo vs. treatment). Overall, in a population of hypertensive patients taking regular exercise, long-term treatment with bisoprolol produced no significant changes in the duration of peak effort, maximal workload, or the effort perceived by the patients themselves. The effects of regular exercise were comparable in both groups (bisoprolol or nitrendipine). Because previous studies have shown that dihydropyridines do not modify exercise performance in hypertensive patients, it may be concluded that the antihypertensive therapy with bisoprolol is well tolerated in a population of active hypertensive patients during dynamic exercise.", 
    "78": "Calcium channel and beta-adrenoceptor blockade have proved highly useful in antihypertensive therapy. Studies of the mechanisms of action of vanidipinedilol that combine these effects within a single molecule are described here. Intravenous injection of vanidipinedilol (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent hypotensive and bradycardic responses, significantly different from nifedipine-induced (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) hypotensive and reflex tachycardic effects in pentobarbital-anesthetized Wistar rats. A single oral administration of vanidipinedilol at doses of 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg dose-dependently reduced blood pressure with a decrease in heart rate in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). In the isolated Wistar rat atrium, vanidipinedilol (10(-7), 10(-6), and 10(-5) M) competitively antagonized the (-)isoproterenol-induced positive chronotropic and inotropic effects and inhibited the increase in heart rate induced by Ca2+ (3.0-9.0 mM) in a concentration-dependent manner. The parallel shift to the right of the concentration-response curve of (-)isoproterenol and CaCl2 suggested that vanidipinedilol possessed beta-adrenoceptor-blocking and calcium entry-blocking activities. On tracheal strips of reserpinized guinea pig, cumulative doses of vanidipinedilol (10(-10) to 3x10(-6) M) produced dose-dependent relaxant responses. Preincubating the preparation with ICI 118,551 (10(-10), 10(-9), 10(-8) M), a beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist, shifted the vanidipinedilol concentration-relaxation curve significantly to a region of higher concentrations. These results implied that vanidipinedilol had a partial beta2-agonist activity. In the isolated thoracic aorta of rat, vanidipinedilol had a potent effect inhibiting high-K+-induced contractions. KCI-induced intracellular calcium changes of blood vessel smooth muscle cell (A7r5 cell lines) determined by laser cytometry also was decreased after administration of vanidipinedilol (10(-8), 10(-7), 10(-6) M). Furthermore, the binding characteristics of vanidipinedilol and various antagonists were evaluated in [3H]CGP-12177 binding to ventricle and lung and [3H]nitrendipine binding to cerebral cortex membranes in rats. The order of potency of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist activity against [3H]CGP-12177 binding was (-)propranolol (pKi, 8.59 for beta1 and 8.09 for beta2) > vanidipinedilol (pKi, 7.09 for beta1 and 6.64 for beta2) > atenolol (pKi, 6.58 for beta1 and 5.12 for beta2). The order of potency of calcium channel antagonist activity against [3H]nitrendipine binding was nifedipine (pKi, 9.36) > vanidipinedilol (pKi, 8.07). The ratio of beta1-adrenergic-blocking/calcium entry-blocking selectivity is 0.1 and indicated that vanidipinedilol revealed more in calcium entry-blocking than in beta-adrenergic-blocking activities. It has been suggested that vanidipinedilol-induced smooth muscle relaxation may involve decreased entry of Ca2+ and partial beta2-agonist activities. In conclusion, vanidipinedilol is a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with calcium channel blocking and partial beta2-agonist associated vasorelaxant and tracheal relaxant activities. Particularly, the vasodilator effects of vanidipinedilol are attributed to a synergism of its calcium entry blocking and partial beta2-agonist activities in the blood vessel. A sustained bradycardic effect results from beta-adrenoceptor blocking and calcium entry blocking, which blunts the sympathetic activation-associated reflex tachycardia in the heart.", 
    "79": "Bucindolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that has additional vasodilating properties. Because some beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists such as cyanopindolol are used as 5-HT1A/5-HT1B receptor antagonists, we tested the hypothesis that bucindolol can interact with 5-HT receptors. Both in vitro and in vivo methods were used to examine the interaction of bucindolol with 5-HT receptors relevant to the cardiovascular system-the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2B receptors-and with alpha1-adrenergic receptors. In binding studies, bucindolol displayed high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor (Ki, 11 nM), modest affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor (Ki, 382 nM), and no measurable affinity for the 5-HT1D receptor; binding affinity for the 5-HT2B receptor was not studied. Bucindolol also displayed significant binding affinity (Ki, 69 nM) for the alpha1-adrenergic receptors. Alpha1-Adrenergic receptor antagonist activity was confirmed by the ability of bucindolol (1 mg/kg) to act as a competitive antagonist against 0.01-30 microg/kg phenylephrine-induced pressor responses in conscious rats. In conscious permanently instrumented rats, bucindolol (0.1-3.0 mg/kg, i.v.) did not cause bradycardia similar to that elicited by the 5-HT1A-receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (3-300 microg/kg, i.v.), nor did bucindolol (1 mg/kg) block the 8-OH-DPAT-induced bradycardia. Bucindolol (10(-9)-10(-5) M) did not cause relaxation in the PGF2alpha-contracted, endothelium-intact porcine coronary artery, nor did bucindolol (10(-5) M) block 5-HT-induced coronary artery relaxation, indicating that bucindolol does not have significant interactions at the 5-HT1D receptor. Bucindolol also displayed no agonist activity at the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptor (endothelium-denuded rat thoracic aorta and rat stomach fundus, respectively), but did act as a weak 5-HT2A-receptor antagonist (-log K(B) [M] = 5.4+/-0.1) and 5-HT2B-receptor antagonist (-log K(B) [M] = 7.8+/-0.1). Thus, these data suggest that bucindolol lacks the ability to activate the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2B receptor, but can block alpha1-adrenergic receptors and act as a weak 5-HT2A- and 5-HT2B-receptor antagonist. The relevance of these serotoninergic effects as it pertains to the mechanism of bucindolol-induced vasodilation is unknown.", 
    "80": "The colocolonic inhibitory reflex is characterized by inhibition of proximal colonic motility induced by distal colonic distension. The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms of this reflex, in vivo, using an isolated loop of canine colon. In five beagle dogs, motility was recorded from an exteriorized colonic loop via a serosal strain gauge connected to a digital data logger and chart recorder. Inflation of a balloon in the distal colon resulted in inhibition of motility in the isolated loop. Inhibition of motor activity persisted following injection of propranolol (100 microg/kg intravenously), a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, but was abolished following administration of the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (200 microg/kg intravenously). This study confirms that the colocolonic inhibitory reflex is mediated via the extrinsic nerves to the colon. As the reflex was abolished by alpha2-, but not beta-adrenoceptor blockade, this indicates that the reflex pathway involves alpha2-adrenoceptors.",

Obtaining proper airway control requires thoughtful organization and planning, and necessitates a thorough working knowledge of the drugs or medications employed. Because there are so many agents available, expertise in airway pharmacology has become essential. The emergency physician who is well versed in the uses, and the physiologic effects, contraindications, and alternatives of drugs administered is both providing immediate intervention and positively affecting patient outcome, which is certainly a goal worth achieving.",

Both male and female rats up-regulated the levels of both beta3-AR and leptin mRNA in response to 15 day cafeteria diet feeding. Noradrenaline- and isoprenaline-induced lipolysis were significantly increased in fat cells from control females compared to their male counterparts. CGP12177A stimulation resulted in significantly higher glycerol release in fat cells from cafeteria diet-fed female rats, whereas there were no differences due to dietary treatment in male rats. The maximal lipolytic response of forskolin (stimulating adenylyl cyclase) and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (cyclic AMP analogous) was not affected by sex or cafeteria diet feeding.", 
    "86": "Cafeteria diet feeding brings about higher excess body weight and impaired adipose tissue lipolytic activity in female rats compared to male rats. Thus, the higher levels of beta3-AR mRNA induced by cafeteria feeding are not indicative per se of an increase of the lipolytic response of the adipocytes. The changes seen in other adrenoceptor subtypes (beta1 and beta2) may be more determinant of the overall lipolytic response of adipocytes.", 
    "87": "The use of neuroleptics in the acute management of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is controversial and may be detrimental to recovery. The following case report describes a patient developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) secondary to the use of haloperidol given to control the patient's agitation. The patient began to exhibit symptoms consistent with NMS (high fever, dystonia, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and decerebrate posturing) shortly after administration of the haloperidol. Upon transfer to a rehabilitation hospital, the symptoms persisted. When NMS is suspected, the first intervention is to remove the offending agent; thus, the administration of haloperidol was suspended, and the patient was placed on Amantadine and propranolol. Amantadine was used to increase the availability of dopamine to the mid-brain region, and the propranolol was used to control the fever, which was believed to be central in origin. The patient was able to complete his rehabilitation with no further incidence of fever or agitation. The patient met or exceeded all short-term physical therapy goals and was able to complete most of the neuropsychological tasks presented. The patient returned home 38 days after admission to the rehabilitation hospital and was able to perform most activities of daily living. At the 6-months follow-up visit, the patient was considering entrance into an adult vocational school.", 
    "88": "When light is presented unexpectedly at night to rats, melatonin production and secretion is acutely inhibited and the time of onset of production on the subsequent night is altered. In a series of experiments, we examined the effects of 6-12 hr light (200 lux) at night on melatonin metabolite excretion (6-sulphatoxymelatonin, aMT.6S). During the light exposure, we administered isoproterenol to stimulate endogenous production of melatonin by the pineal gland to determine if replacement of melatonin would block any phase shifting effects of the light. Exposure to 6 hr of light either during the first or second half of the night suppressed aMT.6S excretion during the light treatment and delayed the onset of melatonin secretion by 3.7 +/- 0.6 and 2.5 +/- 0.6 hr, respectively, compared to a change of 0.5 +/- 0.1 hr in animals maintained in darkness. Twelve hours light exposure (i.e. one night of continuous light) suppressed aMT.6S excretion completely and resulted in a delay in the onset the next night of 2.1 +/- 0.7 hr. When propranolol (10 mg/kg) was administered at 2-hr intervals during darkness, aMT.6S excretion was suppressed throughout the night, but on the subsequent release into constant darkness the onset of excretion was not delayed (0.6 +/- 0.1 hr delay). Administration of isoproterenol (10 mg/kg) to animals in constant light, at the time of expected lights off (CT12), and 5 hr later (CT17) resulted in an increase in melatonin production and aMT.6S excretion that was similar in duration and amount to the control night. The stimulation of endogenous melatonin production failed to block the phase shifting effects of the light exposure and, in fact, appeared to potentiate the delay at least on the first night (4.2 +/- 0.9 hr). The timing of the release into constant darkness following the light treatment had an unexpected effect on melatonin production on the cycle after treatment. Thus, animals exposed to 12 hr light and released into darkness at the normal time of lights off as above had a delay of about 2 hr and excreted 71 +/- 18% of the aMT.6S excreted on a control night. Animals released into darkness at the expected time of lights on failed to excrete more than 20 pmol/hr(i.e. no onset of excretion could be determined) at any time on the first subjective night after light treatment, which was no different from the excretion during the light treatment. On the next subjective night, the onset was delayed as expected and the amount of aMT.6S produced was restored. Treatment with isoproterenol at CT12 and CT17 failed to affect either the amount of aMT.6S excreted on the first subjective night after light treatment or the phase delay on the second night after treatment. The failure to produce melatonin on the first subjective night after 12 hr light exposure and release into darkness at CTO was not due to failure at the level of the pineal gland since injection ofisoproterenol at CT12 and CT17 on the first subjective night after light restored the normal amount of melatonin production. These results suggest that the absence of melatonin during light stimulation at night is not responsible for the phase delay in melatonin production and excretion on subsequent nights. The basis of the failure of the rats to commence melatonin production following 12 hr extended light exposure followed immediately by continuous darkness is not known.", 
    "89": "With the exception of the use of ECG to screen patients for blunt cardiac injury, recent advances in the diagnosis of thoracic trauma involve new technology. Use of surgeon-performed pericardial and pleural ultrasound for the detection of tamponade or hemothorax, TEE or spiral CT to diagnose rupture of the thoracic aorta, and thoracoscopy to evaluate a hemothorax or the integrity of the left hemidiaphragm are all standard techniques in modern trauma centers. In terms of treatment, emergency center thoracotomy is performed more selectively and with the adjunct of staple closure for cardiac wounds. Pulmonotomy is used selectively to control deep lobar hemorrhage and to avoid the need for an emergent lobectomy. Finally, nonoperative management of an intimal tear of the thoracic aorta or delayed operative management of a full-thickness tear in the patient with multiple injuries, using beta-blocker-induced relative hypotension, is rapidly becoming the standard of care throughout the United States.", 
    "90": "Terazosin, a water-soluble alpha 1 antagonist that can be administered in high doses intraventricularly was used to study the relationship between brain alpha 1 adrenoceptor neurotransmission and behavioral activation in the mouse. The antagonist was found to produce a dose-dependent, complete inhibition of motor activity and catalepsy which were reversed preferentially by coinfusion of an alpha 1 agonist (phenylephrine) compared to a D1 (SKF38393) or a D2 agonist, (quinpirole). Blockade of central beta-1 (betaxolol), alpha-2 (RX821002) or beta-2 (ICI 118551) adrenoceptors had smaller or non-significant effects. Terazosin's selectivity for alpha 1 receptors versus dopaminergic receptors was verified under the present conditions by showing that the intraventricularly administered antagonist protected striatal and cerebral cortical alpha 1 receptors but not striatal or cortical D1 receptors from in vivo alkylation by N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1, 2-dihydroxyquinoline. That its effect was due to blockade of brain rather than peripheral receptors was shown by the finding that intraperitoneal doses of terazosin three to 66 times greater than the maximal intraventricular dose produced less behavioral inhibition. Intraventricular terazosin also produced hypothermia and a reduced respiratory rate suggestive of a reduced sympathetic outflow. However, external heat did not affect the inactivity, and captopril, a hypotensive agent, did not mimic it. Terazosin did not impair performance on a horizontal wire test or the ability to make co-ordinated movements in a swim test suggesting that its activity-reducing effect was not due to sedation and may have a motivational or sensory gating component. It is concluded that central alpha 1-noradrenergic neurotransmission is required for behavioral activation to environmental change in the mouse and may operate on sensorimotor and motivational processes.", 
    "91": "The effects of the methanolic extract of Acanthus montanus on different smooth muscle preparations have been investigated. The extract (6.25-100 microg/ml) produced a concentration-dependent relaxation and inhibition of the spontaneous contraction of the rabbit jejunum which was reversed by CaCl2 (0.1-1mM). This effect of the extract was not blocked by propranolol (3 x 10(-7) M) but partially antagonised by phentolamine (10(-6)-3 x 10(-6) M), procaine (10(-3) M) and methylene blue (10(-5) M). The extract also caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of the KCl-precontracted taenia coli of the guinea-pig which was partially blocked by propranolol (3 x 10(-5) M) that completely blocked isoprenaline (10(-8)-3 x 10(-4) M) relaxation of the tissue. Methylene blue (10(-5) M) and procaine (10(-3) M) completely blocked the direct relaxant effects of the extract and isoprenaline on the guinea-pig taenia coli. The extract (0.1-1mg/ml) shifted the concentration-response curves of CaCl2 to the right in a concentration-dependent manner on the guinea-pig taenia coli. These effects of the extract suggest a non specific smooth muscle relaxant activity.", 
    "92": "Hypertension following coronary artery bypass grafting is not uncommon, especially in patients having good left ventricular function. It is often accompanied by tachycardia. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of esmolol in the treatment of tachycardia and hypertension immediately following cardiopulmonary bypass and to study other haemodynamic effects of esmolol. Thirty patients undergoing elective [corrected] coronary artery bypass grafting were included in this prospective study. Morphine-based anaesthetic technique along-with standard bypass techniques were used in all the patients. The study was performed in the operating room about 30-45 minutes after the termination of cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients having a heart rate of more than 90 bpm and systolic blood pressure of more than 130 mm Hg without any inotropic support were included and randomly assigned to esmolol or control group. Esmolol was administered in a bolus dose of 500 micrograms/kg followed by infusion of upto 100 micrograms/kg/min. The patients in the control group were administered comparable volumes of normal saline. Baseline haemodynamic measurements were obtained just before the administration of esmolol or normal saline and were repeated after 5, 10, 15, 30 and 45 min. The baseline measurement in both the groups showed that patients were maintaining a state of hyperdynamic circulation with high systolic blood pressure (esmolol group 148 +/- 15 mm Hg, control group 140 +/- 8 mm Hg; p = NS), heart rate (esmolol group 128 +/- 17 bpm, control group 127 +/- 17 bpm; p = NS) and cardiac index (esmolol group 3.1 +/- 1 L/min/m2, control group 3.3 +/- 0.5 L/min/m2; p = NS). Esmolol decreased systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), heart rate (p < 0.01) and cardiac index (p < 0.05) at five minutes. These changes persisted throughout the study period. The left ventricular stroke work index decreased at five minutes (p < 0.05) and remained so till 30 minutes. The maximum fall in heart rate (15%) and systolic blood pressure (16%) was observed at 45 minutes. There were no haemodynamic changes in the control group except that cardiac index, stroke volume and left ventricular stroke work index increased at five minutes. We conclude that esmolol lowers the indices of cardiovascular work in patients who demonstrated hyperdynamic circulation. This was achieved by decreasing the heart rate and systolic blood pressure which was accompanied by decrease in cardiac index and left ventricular stroke work index.", 
    "93": "Calcium channel blockers and ACE-inhibitors are among the most common drugs prescribed for the initial treatment of hypertension. While their ability to control surrogate outcomes, such as blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy, is proven, there is limited evidence of their prevention of major cardiovascular events, including mortality. The aim of our work was to assess the use of these drugs in Italy in comparison with beta-blockers and diuretics. We examined the consumption of the four main antihypertensive classes of drugs (beta-blockers, diuretics, calcium channel blockers and ACE- inhibitors). In-hospitalization data from the GIFA (Gruppo Italiano di Farmacoepidemiologia nell'Anziano) database were used. During the period from 1988 to 1995, the most frequently prescribed antihypertensive drugs were calcium channel blockers (47%) followed by diuretics (37%), ACE-inhibitors (33%) and beta-blockers (5.5%). Changes over time in the use of these drugs were analysed: ACE-inhibitors had the greatest increase in use over time. Calcium channel blockers, ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers were usually prescribed to the youngest patients (aged <65 years), while diuretics to the oldest. Calcium channel blockers were prescribed to 60% of patients with myocardial infarction and to 55% of those with congestive heart failure. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the Italian physicians very often prescribe drugs like calcium channel blockers and ACE-inhibitors. Among these pharmacological agents, enalapril (twice per day) and slow release calcium channel blockers are the most frequently prescribed drugs.", 
    "94": "Prolonged treatment with the beta(2)-adrenergic agonist clenbuterol (0.25 mg kg(-1) s.c. once daily for 10 days) produced a reduction of the relaxant response and cAMP production mediated by stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors in oestrogen-treated rat uterus. Substantial decreases in the relaxant effect of isoproterenol is observed in uterine rings precontracted with 50 mM KCl from clenbuterol-treated rats. The recovery of the relaxant response was also studied and significant differences were seen between acute and prolonged treatment with clenbuterol (P<0.05 vs control). In contrast the relaxant effect of forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine was similar in untreated or treated rats. Sodium fluoride also showed a relaxant response which was not affected by the treatment with clenbuterol. The radioligand studies showed a reduction in the number of beta-adrenoreceptors after acute and prolonged treatment with clenbuterol in rat uterus. These results suggest that prolonged treatment with clenbuterol caused a desensitization of the relaxant uterine response through beta(2)-adrenoceptors and also showed differences in the recovery of the relaxant response depending on the duration of treatment.", 
    "95": "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) leads to an excessive stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system that may result in tachycardia and malignant arrhythmias in the postresuscitation phase. The attenuation of this reaction by a specific bradycardic agent has not been compared to beta-blockade and placebo. After 4 min of ventricular fibrillation, and 3 min of CPR, 21 pigs were randomized to receive 45 microg/kg epinephrine in combination with either a specific bradycardic agent (0.5 mg/kg zatebradine; n = 7), or a beta-blocker (1 mg/kg esmolol; n = 7), or placebo (normal saline; n = 7). Two minutes after drug administration, defibrillation was performed to restore spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Hemodynamic variables, left ventricular contractility, right ventricular function, and myocardial blood flow were studied at prearrest, and for 3 h after ROSC. In comparison with esmolol and placebo, zatebradine resulted in a significant reduction in heart rate during the postresuscitation period, and reduced the number of premature ventricular contractions in the first 5 min after ROSC. This reduction in heart rate was associated with a significantly higher right ventricular ejection fraction, stroke volume, and endocardial/epicardial perfusion ratio at 5 min after ROSC. In comparison with placebo, esmolol administration decreased heart rate only moderately, but significantly reduced right ventricular stroke volume and cardiac output at 5 min after ROSC. Although only one dose and only one administration pattern of zatebradine has been investigated, we conclude that zatebradine administration during CPR effectively reduced heart rate without compromising myocardial contractility during the postresuscitation phase in pigs.",

Patients underwent IOP diurnal curve testing on timolol maleate twice daily alone and, 2 months later, following the addition of apraclonidine 0.5% three times daily. Statistical analysis of the IOP at each time point was by an unpaired t-test between groups. A paired t-test was used to evaluate the reduction in IOP from baseline within groups after the addition of apraclonidine.", 
    "98": "On timolol maleate alone, exfoliation patients had a higher mean IOP at 06:00 and 10:00 hours as well as a higher peak, range and standard deviation of the IOP compared with primary open-angle glaucoma patients (p < 0.05). Following the addition of apraclonidine the mean, peak and range of IOP were statistically similar between groups and only the standard deviations remained higher in the exfoliation glaucoma group (p < 0.001). The mean diurnal IOP after apraclonidine was added was 20.5 +/- 7.0 mmHg in the exfoliation glaucoma group and 20.0 +/- 3.4 mmHg in the primary open-angle glaucoma group, which was not significantly different between groups (p = 0.73).",

Here we describe a new methodology for monitoring the fluctuations of cAMP in living cells. By tagging the cAMP effector protein kinase A with two suitable green fluorescent protein mutants, we have generated a probe in which the fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the two fluorescent moieties is dependent on the levels of cAMP. This new methodology opens the way to the elucidation of the biochemistry of cAMP in vivo.", 
    "101": "The aims of this study were first to investigate the effect of topical instillation of the 5-HT(1A)receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT on intraocular pressure (IOP) in normotensive rabbits and second to establish whether the drug reaches the aqueous humour of treated and contralateral eyes at concentrations sufficient to activate ciliary epithelial 5-HT(1A)receptors. Following topical unilateral instillation of (+/-), (+) or (-)8-OH-DPAT, the IOP of rabbits was measured using an applanation tonometer. For the penetration study, [(3)H]8-OH-DPAT was instilled into one eye of each rabbit. Animals were killed after 30 min and the radioactive content of treated and contralateral ocular tissues was assessed. Administration of (+/-)8-OH-DPAT caused dose-dependent decreases in IOP in treated eyes of rabbits during the light and dark. The full 5-HT(1A)agonist (+)8-OH-DPAT was shown to be a more effective hypotensive agent than the partial agonist (-)8-OH-DPAT. The effect of (+/-)8-OH-DPAT on IOP was blocked by pretreatment with pindolol, a mixed 5-HT(1A)antagonist/beta-blocker, but not by the specific beta-blocker betaxolol. After instillation of [(3)H]8-OH-DPAT, peak levels of radioactivity were found in the cornea, followed by similar amounts in the iris-ciliary body and aqueous. There was negligible radioactivity present in tissues of the contralateral eye. This study demonstrates that topical administration of the 5-HT(1A)agonist 8-OH-DPAT dose-dependently decreases IOP in normotensive rabbits during the light and dark. The action of 8-OH-DPAT is presumably local to the anterior uvea as IOP was reduced only in treated eyes and [(3)H]8-OH-DPAT failed to reach the contralateral eye after unilateral instillation. Moreover, since 5-HT(1A)receptors are located in the rabbit ciliary epithelium and the effect of 8-OH-DPAT is blocked by a recognized 5-HT(1A)antagonist, the mechanisms of action of 8-OH-DPAT may well involve a decreased secretion of aqueous humour.", 
    "102": "These results support our hypothesis that class III compounds, with a positive inotropic effect, increase intercellular coupling and synchronization, mainly by preventing intracellular Ca overload. They act as defibrillating compound, similar to cAMP and adrenaline, most probably due to their so called sympathomimetic effect. In our opinion, their cardioprotective effects, resembling cardioversion, are not related to their ability to prolong APD and ERP. Moreover, we suggest that any compound that possesses these sympathomimetic effects, but without inducing the arrhythmogenic prolongation of APD, may exhibit a potent, safety and more efficient antiarrhythmic - defibrillating ability.", 
    "103": "The effect of nipradilol on the isoproterelol-induced depression of contractions of the soleus muscle of the anesthetized cats was studied. Isoproterenol (0.3 microg/kg) injected intravenously decreased the tension and degree of fusion of incomplete tetanic contractions of the soleus muscle of the anesthetized cats. The effect of isoproterenol was blocked by nipradilol (> or = 3 microg/kg), desnitro-nipradilol (> or = 10 microg/kg) and propranolol (> or = 10 microg/kg), but not by nitroglycerin (10-100 microg/kg). Nipradilol (30 microg/kg) and desnitronipradilol (300 microg/kg) almost completely antagonized the depressor effects of isoproterenol. These results coupled with evidence that nipradilol does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier indicate that nipradilol exerts an anti-tremor action by blocking peripheral beta2-adrenoceptors.",

PS was done in prospective multicentric study between November 1, 1996 and December 31, 1996. 23 hospitals from various parts of Slovakia participated in this study.

TLT was performed in a statistically significantly smaller proportion of patients older than 65 years compared to patients 65 years of age and younger (20.9% vs 41.2%, p < or = 0.01). Females were treated with TLT statistically significantly less frequently than males (24.5% vs 35.1%, p < or = 0.05). The major cause for not performing the TLT was late arrival to hospital (in 32.1% patients). Betablockers were administered to a total of 42.9% of patients during EHP. Betablockers received only 3.6% of patients intravenously (!) and only 39.3% of patients orally. Treatment with oral betablockers was performed in a statistically significantly smaller proportion of patients older than 65 years compared to patients 65 years of age and younger (27.4% vs 49.7%, p < or = 0.01). Up to 49.1% of patients in EHP were treated with ACE inhibitors, however, left ventricular ejection fraction < 40% warranting feasibility of this treatment was achieved only in 26.7% of patients. Nitrates were administered to 62% of patients in EHP, of this number intravenously to 37.4% of patients. Calcium channel blockers were given only to 7.3% of patients. Treatment with heparin was performed in 90.9% of patients. 14.3% of patients received during EHP antiarrhythmics of class I and 2.7% of patients of class III.

Some results are relatively encouraging, however, others can not be a reason for satisfaction. The fact, that in Slovakia, adequate number of patients with AMI receive acetylosalicylic acid (Anopyrin) and that Slovakia belongs to countries with the smallest proportion of patients with AMI treated with calcium channel blockers and antiarrhythmics during EHP is encouraging. On the other hand, the use of TLT and betablockers is dissatisfactory. Requirement to increase the proportion of thrombolysed patients with AMI and the necessity for substantially more frequent use of betablockers, especially intravenous, in EHP in these patients result from these findings. In Slovakia, inadequately large proportion of patients with AMI is treated with ACE inhibitors, heparin, and partially also nitrates administered per os during EHP. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",

Weight loss has been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure in overweight individuals. The purpose of this study was to show the impact of a weight loss intervention on overall medication requirements for obese, hypertensive patients. This was a substudy of the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) study. HOT study patients who had a body mass index > or =27 kg/m2 were randomized to receive either the weight loss intervention, which included dietary counseling and group support, or to serve as the control group. Patients' weights and number of medication steps (per HOT protocol) required to achieve target diastolic blood pressure were measured at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months. Patients in the weight loss group lost significantly more weight than the control group only at 6 months (-3.2+/-4.3 v. -1.8+/-2.7 kg [mean +/- SD] for weight loss group versus control, respectively, P = .05). The weight loss group tended to regain weight after the first 6 months of the study. However, patients in the weight loss group used a significantly fewer number of medication steps than the control group at all time intervals except 3 months. Weight loss appears to be a useful tool in blood pressure management in patients who require medication to control their blood pressure.",

Each individual flare-up was treated successfully, but the patient began to show equivocal signs of primary open-angle glaucoma (PDAG). She is currently treated prophylactically for POAG with a beta-blocker. No etiologic factor was identified in this patient.

    "113": "Beyond increased cAMP synthesis, calcium influx has been involved in signal transduction triggered by the gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), the main regulator of Sertoli cells functions. In order to delineate a possible involvement of calcium in the regulation of proteoglycan synthesis, we have examined the effect of low-voltage-activated calcium channel blocker verapamil on both [(35)S]-sulfate and [(3)H]-glucosamine incorporation into proteoglycan molecules neosynthesized by cultured Sertoli cells from 20-day-old rats. Verapamil induced a dose- and time-dependent decrease in labeling of both secreted and cell-associated proteoglycans, as determined by quantitative solid-phase assay. This effect was mimicked by the addition of the calcium chelator EGTA, suggesting that verapamil effect resulted from the inhibition of transmembrane calcium influx. The decrease in apparent proteoglycan synthesis appeared to be attributable primarily to a lowering of the glycanation process, as shown by experiments using an exogenous acceptor for glycosaminoglycan synthesis. Moreover, verapamil induced a decrease in relative proportion of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the cell layer. Pulse-chase kinetics demonstrated that verapamil also altered proteoglycan catabolism, leading to glycosaminoglycan retention in the cell layer and inhibiting the proteoglycan desulfation step. We conclude that intracellular calcium is essential to maintain Sertoli cell proteoglycan expression and could thus be involved in the repression of Sertoli cell cAMP-dependent syntheses such as estradiol production.",

The binding and displacement of DL-[3H]propranolol hydrochloride ([3H]propranolol) and L-[propyl-2,3, -3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]dihydroalprenolol), beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, were studied with isolated rat red blood cells, their membranes and ghosts. The binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol and L-quinuclidinyl-[phenyl-4-3H]-benzylate ([3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate), a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, was studied with cerebral cortex membranes. The ligand-receptor interaction corresponded to that for a model of two pools of receptors in the same effector system, with the binding of two ligand molecules to the receptors and was described by the following equation: b=[(B(m1)A(2))/(K(d1)(2)+A(2))]+[(B(m2)A(2))/(K(d2)(2)+A(2))]. The parameters of [3H]propranolol binding to beta-adrenoceptors were as follows: K(d1)=0.74 nM, K(d2)=14.40 nM, B(m1)=24 unit/cell, and B(m2)=263 unit/cell for native red blood cells from rats; K(d1)=0.70 nM, K(d2)=19.59 nM, B(m1)=9 fmol/mg protein, and B(m2)=39 fmol/mg protein for blood ghosts.

    "115": "We investigated the mechanisms of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) inhibition on transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha)-induced DNA synthesis and proliferation in primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes. TGF-alpha (1.0 ng/ml) produced a 4.2-fold elevation of DNA synthesis during 3 h of culture and a 1. 2-fold increase in nucleus number (proliferation) during 4 h of culture. TGF-beta1 dose dependently inhibited the TGF-alpha-induced hepatocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation: half-maximal inhibition occurred at a TGF-beta1 concentration of 0.08 ng/ml. The inhibitory effects of 1.0 ng/ml TGF-beta1 were almost completely reversed by adenylate cyclase inhibitors, 2,4-dideoxyadenosine (10(-6) M), and somatostatin (3 x 10(-7) M), or by a specific inhibitor of protein kinase A, H-89 (N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride; 10(-7) M). In addition, while TGF-alpha did not affect the basal cellular adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) levels, TGF-beta1 was found to produce dose-dependent increases in cellular cAMP levels. The cAMP-elevating effects of TGF-beta1 were also reversed by 2,4-dideoxyadenosine (10(-6) M), and somatostatin (3 x 10(-7) M), but not by H-89 (10(-7) M). The present results suggest that the specific mechanisms involved in the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 on TGF-alpha-induced hepatocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation are via stimulation of adenylate cyclase, which increases intracellular cAMP and subsequently activates protein kinase A.", 
    "116": "Electrical stimulation of the preganglionic superior cervical nerve produced a frequency-dependent vasoconstrictor response in the anterior choroidal blood vessels of the eye of anesthetized rats. Systemic administration of phentolamine (5 mg kg(-1)) reversed the vasoconstriction to a vasodilator response. This sympathetic-evoked vasodilation was not antagonized by inhibition of nitric oxide synthase with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (20 mg kg(-1)) or by inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase with indomethacin (20 mg kg(-1)). Intravenous administration of propranolol (1 mg kg(-1)), as well as selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists atenolol (3 mg kg(-1)), timolol (0.3 mg kg(-1)), and betaxolol (0.1 mg kg(-1)), totally abolished the sympathetic nerve evoked ocular vasodilation. In contrast, the selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI-118, 551 ((+/-)-1-[2, 3-(Dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2- butanol) (0.3 mg kg(-1), i.v.), was without effect. These results support the conclusion that the residual sympathetic ocular vasodilation observed in the rat anterior choroid after alpha-adrenoceptor blockade is mediated exclusively by neurogenic release of norepinephrine acting on vascular beta(1)-adrenoceptors.",

During a mean+/-SD follow-up period of 685+/-360 days, 114 patients died (25.6%), with 75 deaths classified as arrhythmic (17.0%) and 28 as nonarrhythmic (6.3%) cardiac deaths. Several traditional and fractal measures of R-R interval variability were significant univariate predictors of all-cause mortality. Reduced short-term scaling exponent alpha(1) was the most powerful R-R interval variability measure as a predictor of all-cause mortality (alpha(1) <0.75, relative risk 3.0, 95% confidence interval 2.5 to 4.2, P<0.001). It remained an independent predictor of death (P<0.001) after adjustment for other postinfarction risk markers, such as age, ejection fraction, NYHA class, and medication. Reduced alpha(1) predicted both arrhythmic death (P<0.001) and nonarrhythmic cardiac death (P<0.001).",

    "120": "The present review scrutinizes the recommendations of many guidelines to use beta-blockers and diuretics as first-line therapy in hypertension. These recommendations were ostensibly based on multiple prospective randomized trials attesting to a reduction of morbidity and mortality with both beta-blockers and diuretics in monotherapy as well as in combination. Although diuretic-based therapy has been shown to prevent strokes (and, to a lesser extent, heart attacks, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality), no such data are available for beta-blockers. To the contrary, a recent metaanalysis documented that although blood pressure was lowered significantly by beta-blockers, this drug class was ineffective in preventing coronary heart disease, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (odds ratio 1.01, 0.98, and 1.05, respectively). Patients who received a combination of beta-blockers and diuretics fared consistently worse than those taking diuretics alone. Although diuretics have an unparalleled track record of safety and efficacy, the recent findings suggesting that long-term use increased the risk for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is of concern. Over the past decade, an association between RCC and diuretic therapy has been documented in nine case control studies (odds ratio 1.55, confidence interval [CI] 1.42-1.71). In three cohort studies, diuretic therapy was associated with a greater than twofold increased risk of RCC. The risk of RCC increased with cumulative diuretic doses. In the elderly, a low-dose diuretic probably remains a good choice for antihypertensive therapy; however, in middle-aged patients, particularly in women, diuretics should be avoided for the long-term treatment of hypertension. Sweeping recommendations for the use of beta-blockers and diuretics as preferred therapeutic strategies are inappropriate and a more sophisticated drug therapy regimen is often needed.", 
    "121": "We have measured the effect of a bolus dose of esmolol 80 mg i.v. on heart rate, and systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP) and mean (MAP) arterial pressures during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). We also assessed seizure duration using both the cuff method and two-lead EEG. We studied 20 patients in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-patient blocked randomized study. No patient was receiving psychotherapeutic drugs or had cardiovascular disease. Esmolol significantly reduced heart rate, SAP and MAP before the stimulus, and also significantly reduced the increases in these variables during the convulsion, compared with placebo. However, seizure duration was also significantly reduced, possibly making ECT less effective. The reduction in seizure duration was 5.83 s when monitored clinically and 9.9 s when measured by the EEG. Because of the reduction in seizure duration, routine administration of esmolol is not advisable because it may interfere with the efficacy of ECT, but administration of esmolol during ECT could be useful to reduce tachycardia and hypertension in high-risk patients.", 
    "122": "The optimal approach to the adolescent with syncope relies on a good working knowledge of its varied etiology; specifically, knowledge of the most common and generally benign type, vasovagal syncope, as well as the important distinguishing characteristics of the more serious and life threatening forms of cardiac syncope. A thorough history and physical examination are the cornerstones of investigation and will suggest the diagnosis in the vast majority of cases. Screening electrocardiography complements the history and physical, and is important in ruling out symptomatic arrhythmias impossible to diagnose by history and physical alone. Extensive invasive testing is usually unnecessary. Vasovagal syncope generally responds to reassurance and avoidance of precipitating triggers and positional changes. Beta blocker therapy is usually the first line of pharmacologic therapy. Treatment for other forms of syncope should be directed at the suspected underlying cause.", 
    "123": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a target-organ response to chronic pressure or volume overload, is associated with its own independent risks of death in patients with hypertension. Numerous studies have shown that LVH increases the risk of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, stroke or transient ischemic attack, all-cause deaths, and sudden death. Although the mechanisms by which LVH develops are incompletely understood, the renin-angiotensin system may play an important role. All major classes of antihypertensive agents (calcium channel blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) can cause LVH regression but not all to the same degree. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may provide the most pronounced reduction in left ventricular mass per millimeter of mercury of blood pressure reduction. In addition, animal studies and human trials show promise for the regression of LVH with the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Because ARBs act specifically on the AT(1) receptor, angiotensin II can exert its favorable effects on cell growth inhibition through the AT(2) receptor. One small study that compared the ARB valsartan with atenolol found significant regression of LVH with the ARB by 8 months of treatment.",

The comparison was done with an oxidative stress model of cells treated with 0.001-0.000001% hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)).

Cell viability fell down after 24h exposure to 0.001% H(2)O( 2) whereas it was not modified at lower concentrations. 24h after treatment with 0.25% timolol-BAC(+), the relative cell number was reduced by 55% whereas it did not vary after 0.25% timolol-BAC(-) treatment. Only timolol-BAC(+) induced chromatin condensation and cell size reduction. Moreover, cells treated with timolol-BAC(+) overexpressed the apoptotic marker Apo2.7. Both timolol-BAC(+) and BAC(-) induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production which was significantly more important when 0.25% or 0.4% timolol-BAC(+) were applied.

    "132": "Carvedilol is an antihypertensive drug with properties that may be potentially beneficial for kidney graft recipients. The purpose of the study was to investigate if progression of an established chronic rejection may be attenuated or reversed by carvedilol. An open, single-centre, phase II, pilot study, with a 2-yr follow-up, was performed in 25 kidney graft recipients with chronic rejection or accelerated transplant atherosclerosis. Seventeen patients had stable graft function assessed by serum creatinine levels. Eight patients withdrew from the study due to lack of efficacy (increase in serum creatinine 174-477 micromol/L (46-191%) from the initial levels). However. these patients had higher serum creatinine levels and proteinuria already at the start of the study. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as heart rate, were stable in all study patients. Low density lipoprotein (LDL)/high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio decreased from 4.7 +/- 1.9 at 1 month to 3.5 +/- 1.2 at 18 months (p < 0.05), and MDA plasma levels decreased from 0.714 +/- 0.119 to 0.493 +/- 0.073 micromol/L after 3 months of carvedilol treatment (p < 0.05). No attenuation of progression of chronic graft rejection by carvedilol treatment was observed in the study. It is suggested that the process of chronic rejection could not be reversed by carvedilol because the patients included in the study already had severe morphological and functional changes of the graft. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that carvedilol provides a good control of blood pressure in renal transplanted patients. Carvedilol treatment had a beneficial effect on lipid pattern and reduced lipid oxidation, but there was no obvious effect on progression of chronic rejection.",

Separation of the enantiomers as diastereomers was achieved by reversed-phase HPLC within 30 min using Inertsil C8 column. This method allowed determination of 0.05% of either enantiomer in the presence of its stereoisomer and method validation showed adequate linearity over the required range. Owing to the reaction condition during the derivatization with (-)-menthyl chloroformate, the possibility of racemization had to be established. Different ratios of (S)-(-)-metoprolol and (R)-(+)-metoprolol were prepared. Enantiomeric separation of these mixtures took place on a chiralcel OD column or, after derivatization with (-)-menthyl chloroformate, on a C8 column. The results from the these two independent separation systems were compared with trace racemization and were in very good agreement. No racemization was found during the experiment.", 
    "134": "Optimum conditions of chiral derivatization reaction of beta-blockers acebutolol, arotinolol, beta-xolol, bisoprolol, celiprolol, metoprolol and pindolol) with (-)-menthyl chloroformate were investigated for the resolution by HPLC. With more than 30 times molar excess of (-)-menthyl chloroformate chiral derivatization reactions were completed within one hour at room temperature except arotinolol and celiprolol. Diastereomeric derivatives of beta-blockers were well resolved on the ODS column using acetonitrile-methanol-water as a mobile phase.", 
    "135": "In many species arrhythmias induced by myocardial ischaemia appear to be in part dependent upon cardiac sympathetic nerves. However, previous experiments in rats did not suggest that myocardial or other catecholamines are involved in ischaemic arrhythmogenesis in this species. The aim of this study was to investigate this further using transplanted hearts.", 
    "136": "We transplanted 'donated' hearts onto the abdominal aorta of recipient rats and, at varying periods after transplantation, subjected donated and recipient hearts to occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Donated and recipient hearts were tested at various times after transplantation for responsiveness to drugs acting upon aspects of the autonomic nervous system. The intention of this latter study was to assess the status of innervation and receptors simultaneously in both donated and recipient hearts.", 
    "137": "Donated (transplanted) hearts showed responses consistent with denervation and receptor supersensitivity. Changes varied with the duration of the transplant. Over the same period recipient hearts did not change in responsiveness to drugs. When subjected to coronary artery occlusion, transplanted hearts responded to occlusion with the same frequency and severity of arrhythmias as recipient and other control hearts, regardless of the duration of transplant, or sensitivity to drugs.", 
    "138": "The results of these experiments suggest that cardiac innervation is not an important factor in the genesis of ischaemia-induced arrhythmias in rats.", 
    "139": "To seek direct evidence for a cause-effect relation between sympathetic activation and arrhythmogenesis.", 
    "140": "Rats underwent open-chest surgery with either coronary artery occlusion or sham operation, and were studied 8 weeks later using in situ heart perfusion and nerve stimulation methods.", 
    "141": "Infarcted rats showed cardiac functional impairment and increased heart and lung weight. The extent of these changes correlated well with infarct size (IS). In in situ perfused hearts, sympathetic nerve stimulation (2 and 4 Hz, 45 s duration) induced a frequency-dependent release of norepinephrine (NE). NE release was lower in MI than that in control groups. In hearts with large IS (> or = 40%, n = 19) ventricular arrhythmias were rare at baseline, but nerve stimulation evoked the onset of ventricular premature beats (95%), tachycardia (37%) and fibrillation (26%), IS and stimulation frequency were key determinants for the inducibility of arrhythmias. Lower K- concentration enhanced arrhythmia inducibility. beta-blockade inhibited the frequency of arrhythmias produced by nerve stimulation.", 
    "142": "In infarcted rat hearts sympathetic activation is a potent trigger for the onset of ventricular tachyarrhythmias.", 
    "143": "The present study was designed to examine regional differences in the response of alpha 1 adrenoceptor stimulation in the canine ventricle.", 
    "144": "Standard microelectrode techniques were used to record transmembrane action potentials from epicardial, M cell, and endocardial as well as Purkinje fiber preparations isolated from the canine left ventricle.", 
    "145": "Phenylephrine (0.1-10 microM+ propranolol 0.2 microM) and methoxamine (1-10 microM) produced dose- and rate-dependent prolongation of action potential duration (APD90) in Purkinje fibers (P < 0.05, at 0.1-10 microM, BCL = 0.5-2 s), but an abbreviation of APD90 in tissues from the M region (P < 0.05, at 10 microM, BCL = 0.5-2 s). At slow pacing rates (> or = 2 s), phenylephrine (1 microM) exerted a small, significant (P < 0.05) prolongation of APD90 in epicardium and endocardium which returned to control values when the concentration was increased to 10 microM. The amplitude of phase 1 of the action potential in M and epicardial cells was significantly increased by phenylephrine at concentrations of 10 microM (P < 0.05). Prazosin (1 microM), a nonspecific alpha 1 antagonist, reversed these effects of phenylephrine (10 microM) and methoxamine (10 microM) on APD90 and the action potential notch. The alpha 1b-antagonist, chloroethylclonidine (0.1-1.0 microM), but not the alpha 1a-antagonist, WB-4101 (0.1-1.0 microM), reversed the APD-abbreviating effect of methoxamine in the M cell.", 
    "146": "Our results demonstrate striking regional differences in the electrophysiological response of the four canine ventricular cell types to alpha 1 adrenergic agonists. Our data provide support for the hypothesis that different adrenoceptor subtypes underlie the opposite response of M cells (alpha 1b-APD abbreviation) and Purkinje fibers (alpha 1a-APD prolongation) to alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation.", 
    "147": "The receptors and neurotransmitter pathways that may participate in the inhibitory action of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) on prolactin release during late pregnancy and lactation in rats were studied. Administration of the 5HT synthesis inhibitor, p-chlorophenylalanine, to late pregnant rats induced a significant increase in serum prolactin concentrations at 17:00 h on day 19 of pregnancy that was partially blocked by injections of the 5HT precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan, or the 5HT agonists, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin hydrobromide (S1a), 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (S2) and N-(3-chlorophenyl)imidodicarbonimide diamide HCl (S3), but not by RU 24969 (S1b) or 1-meta-(chlorophenyl)-piperazine-2-HCl (S1a-2c). The 5HT neurotoxins, fenfluramine and p-chloroamphetamine, which selectively destroy fine axon serotoninergic fibres but not coarse ones, prevented the increase in circulating prolactin observed at 18:00 h on pro-oestrus and on day 21 of pregnancy, but did not modify serum prolactin concentrations at 17:00 h on day 19 of pregnancy. Administration of the adrenergic antagonists, metoprolol or prazosin, also prevented the stimulatory effects of p-chlorophenylalanine or ketanserin in pregnant rats on day 19 (17:00 h) or on days 10-12 (16:30 h) in lactating rats separated from their litters. Administration of p-chlorophenylalanine to pregnant rats on day 19 reduced dopamine concentrations in the arcuate nucleus and in the anterior hypothalamus and noradrenaline concentrations in the anterior hypothalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These results indicate that the inhibitory actions of 5HT on prolactin release in pregnant and lactating rats are mediated by S1a, S2a and S3 receptors and by the coarse axon serotoninergic fibres. In addition, the inhibitory actions of 5HT may modulate the action of a stimulatory adrenergic pathway, as well as the concentrations of noradrenaline and dopamine in different hypothalamic areas, which, in turn, particularly arcuate nucleus dopamine, regulate prolactin release.", 
    "148": "Carvedilol, an antihypertensive drug with activity on adrenoceptors as well as on calcium channel activity, has recently been introduced. In the present study we investigated whether carvedilol interacts with the cytotoxicity induced by irradiation in vitro as well as in vivo. A daily injection of carvedilol in clinically relevant concentrations (3 mg/kg subcutaneously), 4 days before and 3 days after a single radiation dose of 20 Gy significantly decreased the inflammatory reaction in the rat lung, evaluated as number of inflammatory cells in the perivascular area. The density of mast cells was also slightly reduced. In vitro studies revealed that carvedilol caused different radio-protective effects, dependent on dose (1-7 Gy) used and cell line studied. The effects were especially pronounced in a malignant mesothelioma cell line (P-31), and somewhat less evident in a prostatic carcinoma cell line (PC-3). No significant effect was seen in a highly radiosensitive small cell lung cancer cell line (U-1690). Thus, carvedilol may under some circumstances interact with radiation-induced tissue reactions, most probably by a direct interaction at the cellular level. The specific explanation to the differences in sensitivity to carvedilol remains to be evaluated, but the known antioxidative properties and/or scavenging of free radicals of carvedilol may be a plausible mechanism of action. Secondary induced alterations in inflammatory response may also be considered. It is suggested that a potential interaction between drugs such as carvedilol and irradiation should be considered for clinical practice.", 
    "149": "The aim of this study was to examine the effects of both angiotensin II type I receptor antagonism using losartan (LOS) and beta-receptor blockade by metoprolol (MP) in isoproterenol-induced cardiac injury in the rat. Two weeks after isoproterenol (ISO) application, 90 ISO and 30 control (CTRL) rats were examined. ISO rats were treated for two weeks with either LOS, MP, or vehicle (n = 30 each group). Compared to CTRL, ISO induced left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), fibrosis, and overexpression of extracellular matrix proteins. LOS significantly attenuated these changes. MP only reduced LVH, but exerted no effect on structural alterations. LV end-diastolic and mean right atrial pressures were significantly increased in the ISO group and normalized in the LOS and MP group. Mean aortic blood flow velocity was significantly decreased in the ISO group and unaltered in the LOS and MP group versus CTRL. Blood pressure was decreased in ISO and LOS rats. MP treatment had no effect on blood pressure, but significantly lowered heart rate. Isoproterenol induced mild heart failure. Losartan and metoprolol applications in ISO-treated rats were highly effective in attenuating hemodynamic alterations and LVH. Early application of losartan 24 hours after isoproterenol-induced cardiac injury revealed significant beneficial effects on myocardial structure.", 
    "150": "A novel clonal cell line transfected with the delta-opioid receptor (delta-OR) encoding gene was used to study agonist-activated regulation of cell proliferation. In this cell line, endogenous beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2-ARs) are coexpressed with the exogenous delta-ORs. Upon individual acute treatments with morphine and procaterol (a selective beta2-AR agonist), both the delta-OR and beta2-AR are coupled to differential modulation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in accord with the classical second messenger response patterns to these agonists in the normal cellular settings of the receptors. But chronic morphine activation of the delta-OR inhibits cellular proliferation, while chronic procaterol activation of the beta2-AR stimulates it. Chronic treatment with the individual agonists is accompanied by differential activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) isozymes, extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The findings suggest that chronic beta2-AR activation stimulates proliferation by interacting with the ERK signalling cascade independent of a cAMP-mediated pathway. In contrast to treatment with individual agonists, chronic dual agonist treatment suppresses procaterol-induced stimulation of ERK activity and stimulation of proliferation indicating that a cross-regulatory interaction occurs between the delta-OR and beta2-AR signalling systems in the cells under these conditions.", 
    "151": "Although several studies have demonstrated the presence of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in nerves supplying the mammalian adrenal cortex, its function in this tissue remains unclear, with reports of both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on aldosterone secretion apparently depending on the tissue preparation used. In the present study the effects of NPY on rat adrenal capsular tissue were investigated. NPY significantly stimulated aldosterone secretion in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was abolished by atenolol, a beta1-adrenergic antagonist. NPY also stimulated the release of catecholamines from intact rat adrenal capsular tissue with the same dose-dependent relationship as the stimulation of aldosterone release. These observations suggest that the actions of NPY may be mediated by the local release of catecholamines from chromaffin cells within adrenal capsular tissue, as we have previously described for vasoactive intestinal peptide. The second part of this study concerned the NPY receptor subtype mediating the actions of NPY on the adrenal cortex. It was found that peptide YY stimulated aldosterone release with a comparable potency to NPY, whereas pancreatic polypeptide (PP) was without effect. The Y1 selective NPY analog Leu31Pro34NPY had a greater effect on aldosterone release than the Y2 selective analog NPY18-36. Studies using the specific Y1 receptor antagonist BIBP 3226 showed significant attenuation of the aldosterone response to NPY, but no effect on the response to added norepinephrine. Binding studies carried out using [125I]NPY revealed the presence of a single population of NPY-binding sites with a Kd of 12.25 nmol/liter and a binding capacity of 623 fmol/mg protein. Competition studies revealed displacement of [125I]NPY specific binding by NPY, peptide YY, and Leu31Pro34NPY, but not by other peptides. Messenger RNA analysis revealed the presence of messenger RNA coding for both the Y1 receptor and the Y4 receptor, but not the other subtypes. Taken together these data suggest that the effects of NPY on the rat adrenal cortex are mediated by the Y1 receptor subtype."
