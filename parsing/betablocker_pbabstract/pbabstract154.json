There is potential for transport of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from agricultural fields to adjacent surface waters via tile drainage systems. In this study, liquid municipal biosolids (LMB) (total solids=11,933 mg L(-1)), supplemented with selected PPCPs and the fluorescent dye tracer rhodamine WT (RWT), were applied to tile drained fields using two land application approaches. Objectives included evaluating the relative benefits of land application practices with respect to reducing PPCP loadings to tile drains, evaluating PPCP persistence in tile water, and determining whether rhodamine WT can be used to estimate PPCP mass loads in tile. The PPCPs examined included an antibacterial agent used in personal care products (triclosan), a metabolite of nicotine (cotinine), and a variety of drugs including two sulfonamide antimicrobials (sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole), a beta-blocker (atenolol), an anti-epileptic (carbamazepine), an antidepressant (fluoxetine), analgesic/anti-inflammatories (acetaminophen, naproxen, ibuprofen), and a lipid-regulator (gemfibrozil). Maximum observed PPCP concentrations in the spiked LMB were about 10(3) ng g(-1) dry weight. PPCPs were shown to move rapidly via soil macropores to tile drains within minutes of the land application. Maximum observed PPCP concentrations in tile effluent associated with the LMB application-induced tile flow event were approximately 10(1) to 10(3) ng L(-1). PPCP mass loads, for the application-induced tile-hydrograph event, were significantly (p<0.1) higher for surface spreading over non-tilled soil (incorporation tillage occurring 20 h post-application), relative to aerating soil immediately prior to surface spreading using an AerWay slurry deposition system. PPCP concentrations that were detected above the limit of quantitation (LOQ) in tile water during several precipitation-induced tile flow events that occurred post-application, included: triclosan (max. approximately 1.5 x 10(2) ng L(-1)), carbamazepine (max. approximately 7 x 10(1) ng L(-1)), atenolol (max approximately 4 x 10(1) ng L(-1)), and cotinine (max approximately 2 x 10(1) ng L(-1)). In spite of their presence in biosolids, the other PPCPs were not observed above LOQ concentrations during these events. PPCP concentrations were predicted from RWT concentrations over a 40 day study period. Tile mass loads as a percent of PPCP mass applied to soil ranged from 4.2%+/-SD of 9.2% to 7.1%+/-10.9% for the AerWay system and surface spreading plus incorporation treatments, respectively.", 
    "1": "We have investigated the role of nitric oxide (NO) in relaxations to beta-adrenoceptor agonists in mesenteric artery from wild-type (WT) and NO synthase-3 knockout (NOS-3-KO) mice. Isoprenaline, formoterol and BRL 37344 ((R(),R())-(+/-)-4-[2-[(2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl)amino]propyl]phenoxyacetic acid) were chosen as non-selective and beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonists, respectively. Atenolol, ICI 118,551 ((+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol hydrochloride) and SR59230A (1-(2-ethylphenoxy)-3-[[(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthalenyl]amino]-(2S)-2-propanol hydrochloride) were chosen as selective beta(1)-, beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonists, respectively. Experiments employing isoprenaline were carried out in the presence of prazosin (0.1 microM). Isoprenaline produced relaxations with a potency of 5.68+/-0.36 (-log M, n=6) in WT mice. Relaxations to isoprenaline were blocked by atenolol (10 microM) and were absent in vessels from NOS-3-KO animals. Formoterol produced relaxations with two components. ICI 118,551 (1 microM) abolished relaxations to low concentrations of formoterol (0.1-10 microM), but failed to affect relaxations to formoterol (100 microM). In NOS-3-KO mice only the highest concentration of formoterol (100 microM) produced relaxations: the relaxation was resistant to all of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists employed. BRL 37344 (5.75+/-0.28, n=9) was approximately equipotent with isoprenaline but produced a smaller degree of relaxation, in WT mice. SR59230A (1 microM) abolished relaxations to BRL 37344 in WT mice. In NOS-3-KO mice, BRL 37344 produced concentration-dependent relaxations which were abolished by SR59230A. It is concluded that the predominant beta-adrenoceptor mediating relaxations in mouse mesenteric artery is beta(1), and relaxations involve NOS-3. In addition, beta(3)-adrenoceptors mediate smaller relaxations at least partly independent of NOS-3, and beta(2)-adrenoceptors may mediate smaller relaxations dependent on NOS-3.",

The occurrence of myocardial infarction in myeloproliferative disease is mostly attributed to coronary thrombosis due to hyperviscosity and thrombocytosis. We presented three cases of acute myocardial infarction associated with polycythemia vera in one patient (male, age 33 years) and essential thrombocytosis in two patients (male, ages 36 and 46 years). None of the patients had diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or a positive family history. One patient with early presentation received thrombolytic therapy, and all the patients were treated with aspirin, beta-blocker, angiotensin 2 receptor blocker, statin, low-molecular-weight heparin, parenteral nitrate, and clopidogrel for acute coronary syndrome, and hydroxyurea for essential thrombocytosis. Control angiographies showed patent coronary arteries in all the cases.", 
    "10": "The cardiac manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are numerous. Impairments of right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary vascular disease are well known to complicate the clinical course of COPD and correlate inversely with survival. The pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular disease in COPD is likely multifactorial and related to alterations in gas exchange and vascular biology, as well as structural changes of the pulmonary vasculature and mechanical factors. Several modalities currently exist for the assessment of pulmonary vascular disease in COPD, but right heart catheterization remains the gold standard. Although no specific therapy other than oxygen has been generally accepted for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in this population, there has been renewed interest in specific pulmonary vasodilators. The coexistence of COPD and coronary artery disease occurs frequently. This association is likely related to shared risk factors as well as similar pathogenic mechanisms, such as systemic inflammation. Management strategies for the care of patients with COPD and coronary artery disease are similar to those without COPD, but care must be given to address their respiratory limitations. Arrhythmias occur frequently in patients with COPD, but are rarely fatal and can generally be treated medically. Use of beta-blockers in the management of cardiac disease, while a theoretical concern in patients with increased airway resistance, is generally safe with the use of cardioselective agents.", 
    "11": "Calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling regulates insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells. STIM1 has been proposed to function as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) sensor regulating store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE). Here we studied the translocation of EYFP-STIM1 in response to ER calcium depletion in mouse insulinoma MIN6 cells by fluorescent microscopy. While in resting cells EYFP-STIM1 is co-localized with an ER marker, in thapsigargin (Tg)-stimulated cells it occupied highly defined areas of the peri-PM space in punctae adjacent to, but not entirely coincident with the ER. Co-staining with fluorescent phalloidin revealed that EYFP-STIM1 punctae was located in actin-poor areas. Use of the SOCE blocker in MIN6 cells, 2-aminoethoxy diphenylborate (2-APB), prevented store depletion-dependent translocation of EYFP-STIM1 to the PM in a concentration-dependent (3.75-100muM) and reversible manner. TIRF microscopy revealed that 2-APB treatment led to the reversible disappearance of peri-PM EYFP-STIM1 punctae, while the ER structure in this compartment remained grossly unaffected. We conclude from this data that in these cells EYFP-STIM1 is delivered to a peri-PM location from the ER upon store depletion and this trafficking is reversibly blocked by 2-APB.", 
    "12": "A new method for rapid separation and sensitive detection of beta-blockers by pressure-assisted capillary electrochromatography (pCEC) with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) using silica-based monolithic column was studied in this paper. The proposed method has been confirmed to be very powerful since the fast mass transfer property and good permeability of silica monolithic column was used in this pCEC-ESI-MS system. In this work, a silica monolithic column was prepared with sol-gel method for simultaneous fast separation of beta-blockers. Furthermore, in order to obtain the highly selective and sensitive result of pCEC-ESI-MS, both the CEC separation and MS detection parameters were optimized in detail. Under the optimized conditions, namely 80% acetonitrile and 20% 20 mmol/L ammonium acetate (pH 6.0) as the mobile phase, 20 kV and 8 bar as the separation voltage and the assisted pressure, isopropanol/water (1:1, v/v) containing 7.5 mmol/L acetic acid as the sheath liquid, and 3 microL/min as the flow rate of sheath liquid, seven beta-blockers were well separated within 11 min with detection limits in the range of 0.15-0.80 ng/mL (defined as S/N=3). The recoveries of spiked urine samples of these beta-blockers were between 86.3 and 103% with the RSDs lower than 8.0%. The real samples from some male volunteers were successfully analyzed and confirmed with the proposed method. Comparing with GC-MS or LC-MS, the new method has some superiority (such as fast analysis capacity and simple pretreatment) in clinical practice and doping control.", 
    "13": "A 63-year-old woman, who had been treated with 20 mg of paroxetine and 0.5 mg of alprazolam daily for 1 year and with 50 mg of metoprolol daily for 15 days, presented to a facility elsewhere with presyncope and complete atrioventricular block. Three days after her initial presentation and cessation of metoprolol treatment, she was transferred to our clinic to be considered for permanent pacemaker implantation. Paroxetine treatment was discontinued on day 1 and atrioventricular block resolved on day 5, which was confirmed with a 24-hour Holter recording. No bradyarrhythmia was induced with similar doses of either metoprolol or paroxetine alone. At 2- and 3-year follow-up, the patient was still free of bradyarrhythmia documented with electrocardiography and 24-hour Holter recordings. To our knowledge, we report the first case of complete atrioventricular block associated with coadministration of paroxetine and metoprolol. Increasing physicians' awareness of drug-induced severe bradyarrhythmia might prevent unnecessary implantation of permanent pacemakers.", 
    "14": "Esophageal cancer is the sixth leading causes of cancer-related death in the world. It is suggested that beta-adrenoceptor is involved in the control of cell proliferation, but its role in the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer remains unknown. We therefore studied the role of beta-adrenergic signaling in the regulation of growth of an esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma cell line HKESC-1. Results showed that both beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors were expressed in HKESC-1 cells. Stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors with epinephrine significantly increased HKESC-1 cell proliferation accompanied by elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP levels, which were abolished by beta(1)- or beta(2)-selective antagonists. Epinephrine also increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation as well as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and cytosolic phospholipase A(2) expression, which were blocked by beta(1)- or beta(2)-selective antagonists. Moreover, epinephrine increased cyclin D(1), cyclin E(2), cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-4, CDK-6, and E(2)F-1 expression and retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation at Ser807/811, all of which were abrogated by beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist. Furthermore, epinephrine increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1 and -2 in a beta(2)-adrenoceptor-, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)-, and COX-2-dependent manner. MEK or COX-2 inhibitor also significantly inhibited HKESC-1 cell proliferation induced by epinephrine. Collectively, we demonstrate that epinephrine stimulates esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma cell proliferation via beta-adrenoceptor-dependent transactivation of ERK/COX-2 pathway. Stimulation of beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors also elicits a differential response on the expression of cell cycle regulators. These novel findings may shed new light on the understanding of beta-adrenergic signaling in the control of esophageal cancer cell growth.", 
    "15": "A novel elementary osmotic pump tablet was developed. The system uses the core of drug-resin complexes (DRCs) loaded with propranolol hydrochloride (PNH) for time-controlled delivery. In traditional osmotic pump tablets (OPTs), the lag time was always minimized. However, in the DRCs osmotic pump tablet (DRCOPT), the lag time was increased to achieve the time-controlled delivery. The quantity of osmotic agent in the core and channeling agent in the coating solution as well as weight gain were confirmed to be essential for the release behavior. A spherical symmetric design was applied to the optimization of the DRCOPT. The optimal formulation mainly consisted of DRC 100 mg, polyethyleneoxide (N80) 182 mg, and NaCl 30 mg. The ratio of cellulose acetate (CA)/polyethylene glycol 4000 was 15:3 (w/w) in coating solution, and the weight gain was 8%. The release behavior of the optimal DRCOPT was evaluated in media with different pH, rotation speeds, and ionic strength. It was found to generate a 2-h lag time, to deliver PNH at a rate of zero order from 2 h to 14 h in the medium of NaCl 0.15 mol/l, and the cumulative release at 24 h was 94%. Drug relee was independent of pH and rotation speed, but was proportional to ionic strength. In summary, the lag time could be used in therapeutic regimens with the characteristics of chronotherapy because of the lag time and provides a new concept for the development of osmotic pumps.", 
    "16": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of R- and S-carvedilol in routinely treated Japanese patients with heart failure. We measured peak and trough blood concentrations at steady state following repeated oral administration to 24 patients. The blood concentration of S-carvedilol with potent beta-blocking activity was lower than that of R-carvedilol. The mean oral clearance (CL/F) of R- and S-carvedilol was not altered by CYP2D6*10, UGT2B7*3, and the etiology of heart failure. In addition, the CL/F values of enantiomers were not correlated with age, creatinine clearance, and plasma concentrations of alpha1-acid glycoprotein and brain natriuretic peptide. On the other hand, the mean CL/F values of R- and S-carvedilol in patients with heart failure were 0.89 and 1.52 l/h/kg, respectively, considerably lower than those estimated previously in healthy subjects. These results suggested that the pharmacokinetics of R- and S-carvedilol was altered significantly by heart failure.", 
    "17": "We have established an ocular pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model for a beta-adrenergic antagonist, timolol, after instillation into rabbits. Timolol concentrations were determined by HPLC in the tear fluid, aqueous humor, cornea, and iris-ciliary body after instillation or ocular injection into the anterior chamber of the eye in rabbits. In addition, intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement was performed after instillation of timolol by a telemetry system, which was able to obtain detailed IOP data automatically. The PK/PD parameters were estimated by fitting the concentration-time profiles and the ocular hypotensive effect-time profiles using MULTI (RUNGE) program. The PK model consisted of six compartments and the PD model included aqueous humor dynamics based on an action mechanism of timolol, which causes lowering of IOP by suppressing aqueous humor production. The PK/PD model described well the concentration-time profiles and the ocular hypotensive effect-time profiles after instillation of timolol. This study is the first trial to develop an ocular PK/PD model for timolol after instillation. This model can predict both the drug concentrations in various ocular tissues and the ocular hypotensive effect after instillation of timolol.",

On the basis of this study, we compared the pharmacological properties of SPFF and its enantiomers ((-)-SPFF and (+)-SPFF) in guinea pigs taking isoprenaline or salbutamol (SAB) as referenced drugs. For the relaxation of both normal and precontracted trachea strips in vitro, (-)-SPFF was found more potent than (+/-)-SPFF or (+)-SPFF. Moreover, we confirmed that the bronchodilator effect of (-)- and (+)-enantiomers were due to activation of the beta2-adrenoceptor because this effect was antagonized by a specific beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI-118551, with similar pA2 values to those of (+/-)-SPFF. Radioligand binding assay revealed that affinity of (-)-enantiomer to beta2-adrenoceptor was 6 and 164 fold greater than that of (+/-)- and (+)-SPFF, respectively. In addition, isomeric difference of overall selectivity between (-)-SPFF and (+)-SPFF was 10.7 fold for lung versus atria. (-)-SPFF displayed almost the same protective effect against bronchospasm induced by histamine-acetylcholine aerosol in conscious guinea pigs as (+/-)-SPFF did. However, the latent time of (+)-SPFF (1 mg.kg(-1)) was significantly shorter than that of (+/-)- and (-)-SPFF at the same doses. Finally, in the inhibition of histamine-induced increase of pulmonary resistance (RL) in anesthetized guinea pigs, (-)-SPFF was 1.3 and 3.5 times more potent than (+/-)- and (+)-SPFF. Correspondingly, in inhibiting the decrease of pulmonary compliance (CL) , the potencies of (-)- and (+)-enantiomers were approximately equivalent to that of (+/-)-SPFF. Furthermore, a study on the long-lasting action of the test drugs had shown that the effects of (-)-SPFF (30 microg.kg(-1)), (+/-)-SPFF (30 microg.kg(-1)) and (+)-SPFF (100 microg.kg(-1)) in inhibiting the increase of RL all lasted for 4 h. Nevertheless, the effects of (-)- and (+)-enantiomers were slightly lower 4 h after intraduodenal administration in inhibiting the decrease of CL. In conclusion, (-)-SPFF may be beneficial for the treatment of asthma because of its more potent efficacy and higher adrenoceptor affinity than (+/-)- or (+)-SPFF.", 
    "19": "Beta blockers remain underused in elderly patients with heart failure. Age is not a contraindication to beta blockers. The SENIORS study confirmed that beta blockers are both efficacious and well tolerated in elderly people with heart failure, regardless of their ejection fraction. Because adverse effects may be both more frequent and more serious in the elderly, prescription protocols must be strictly applied. Patients in stable NYHA stages II or III may begin beta blocker treatment, at least 1 month after any decompensation. The initial dose must be as low as possible (1.25 mg/d for bisoprolol and nebivolol). Doses must be increased very progressively and stages longer than 15 days may be necessary. The objective is to reach the target dose (10mg/d for bisoprolol and nebivolol), given the dose-response effect that exists for beta blockers in elderly people with heart failure. In the case of low blood pressure, antihypertensive treatments must be reduced or stopped (for example, nitrate derivatives or calcium channel blockers). A reduction in the dosage of any diuretic dosage and finally of the beta blocker may follow, if necessary. Should bradycardia occur, any anti-bradycardia treatments (such as digoxin or amiodarone) must be reduced or stopped before the beta blocker dosage is reduced.",

    "24": "Several factors have been incriminated in the genesis of diabetic nephropathy. To elucidate their interplay, we have used a hypertensive, obese, diabetic rat model with nephropathy (SHR/NDmcr-cp) that mimics human type 2 diabetes. This model is characterized by hypertension, obesity with the metabolic syndrome, diabetes with insulin resistance, and intrarenal advanced glycation end product (AGE) accumulation. In order to achieve renoprotection, which was evaluated by histology and albuminuria, various therapeutic approaches were used: caloric restriction, antihypertensive agents (angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB] and calcium channel blocker), lipid- (bezafibrate) or glucose-lowering (insulin and pioglitazone) agents, and cobalt chloride (a hypoxia-inducible factor activator). Altogether, renoprotection is not necessarily associated with blood pressure or glycemic control. By contrast, it is almost always associated with decreased AGE formation, with the exception of insulin, which induces hyperinsulinemia, eventually leading to an overproduction of transforming growth factor-beta. AGE formation is reduced directly by in vitro active compounds (e.g., ARBs) or indirectly by in vitro inactive compounds (e.g., pioglitazone and cobalt). In the latter cases, AGE reduction may reflect a decreased oxidative stress as it is concomitant with a marked reduction of oxidative stress markers. It remains to be seen whether the renoprotection offered by these various approaches may be additive.", 
    "25": "The preoperative evaluation serves several purposes for the gynecologist. Patients with previously undiagnosed, or incompletely managed, medical concerns are identified and appropriate treatment initiated. In women with known medical concerns, the surgeon can anticipate problems and plan for appropriate postoperative care. In certain cases, the preoperative evaluation identifies medical conditions that are unstable enough to adversely affect the postoperative outcome, and appropriate referral for medical management can be made. One of the most important aspects of the evaluation is the identification of women at high risk for cardiovascular complications. A stepwise approach is useful to identify those women who may proceed to surgery and those who need further testing. Much of the preoperative evaluation of the woman with pulmonary disease can be done during the history and physical examination without additional testing. Deep venous thrombosis is a significant concern in gynecologic surgery; appropriate identification of the woman at risk is important, with initiation of prophylaxis occurring shortly after the surgery concludes. Many women undergoing gynecologic surgery have diabetes. Careful management of diabetes in the perioperative period has become more germane, with evidence of improved outcomes as tight control is achieved. Much of the preoperative evaluation falls easily into the purview of the gynecologist, with advice presented as to when medical consultation should be considered.",

    "30": "Heterologous expression systems have increased the feasibility of developing selective ligands to target nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes. However, the alpha6 subunit, a component in nAChRs that mediates some of the reinforcing effects of nicotine, is not easily expressed in systems such as the Xenopus oocyte. Certain aspects of alpha6-containing receptor pharmacology have been studied by using chimeric subunits containing the alpha6 ligand-binding domain. However, these chimeras would not be sensitive to an alpha6-selective channel blocker; therefore we developed an alpha6 chimera (alpha4/6) that has the transmembrane and intracellular domains of alpha6 and the extracellular domain of alpha4. We examined the pharmacological properties of alpha4/6-containing receptors and other important nAChR subtypes, including alpha7, alpha4beta2, alpha4beta4, alpha3beta4, alpha3beta2, and alpha3beta2beta3, as well as receptors containing alpha6/3 and alpha6/4 chimeras. Our data show that the absence or presence of the beta4 subunit is an important factor for sensitivity to the ganglionic blocker mecamylamine, and that dihydro-beta-erythroidine is most effective on subtypes containing the alpha4 subunit extracellular domain. Receptors containing the alpha6/4 subunit are sensitive to alpha-conotoxin PIA, while receptors containing the reciprocal alpha4/6 chimera are insensitive. In experiments with novel antagonists of nicotine-evoked dopamine release, the alpha4/6 chimera indicated that structural rigidity was a key element of compounds that could result in selectivity for noncompetitive inhibition of alpha6-containing receptors. Our data extend the information available on prototypical nAChR antagonists, and establish the alpha4/6 chimera as a useful new tool for screening drugs as selective nAChR antagonists.",

Emerging evidence indicates that, for patients with dementia, the risks associated with atypical antipsychotics may outweigh the benefits except for patients with severe agitation who require short-term chemical restraint. We then discuss the importance of a careful assessment to rule out potentially reversible factors contributing to DRA. Finally, we summarize the evidence supporting the use of medications other than antipsychotics to treat DRA. There is wide variability in the levels of evidence supporting the use of non-antipsychotic medication for the treatment of DRA. The best evidence currently exists for cholinesterase inhibitors and serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitor antidepressants. Emerging reports suggest that numerous other medications, for example, antiepileptics, lithium, anxiolytics, analgesics, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, cannabinoid receptor agonists and hormonal agents, may prove to be viable alternatives to antipsychotics for the treatment of severe DRA and more research is urgently needed to help assess the effectiveness of these agents. A comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment and treatment plan is likely the most effective way to manage DRA.", 
    "38": "Our previous study demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) protects against gastric ischemia-reperfusion (GI-R) injury, but it is still unknown whether angiotensin II (Ang II) in the PVN plays a role in the development of GI-R. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Ang II in the PVN on GI-R injury. GI-R injury was induced in rats by clamping the celiac artery for 30 min, and then reperfusing for 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h or 24 h, respectively. A cannula was inserted into the unilateral PVN for microinjection of Ang II. The extent of gastric mucosal damage was determined by gross and histological methods. We found that microinjection of pharmacological doses of Ang II (3, 30, and 300 ng) into the PVN dose-dependently inhibited GI-R injury, and that Ang II (30 ng) markedly attenuated GI-R injury at 1 h and 3 h after reperfusion. The effect of Ang II was prevented by pretreatment with the Ang II AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (5 microg) into the lateral cerebral ventricle. Furthermore, the protective effect of Ang II on GI-R injury was abolished by propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.) or disconnection of the nerves innervating the adrenal glands, was augmented by sympathectomy or phentolamine (1 mg/kg, i.v.), and was not affected by subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or atropine (1 mg/kg, i.v.). These results indicate that the PVN is a responsive site for central Ang II-induced protection against GI-R injury. The central effects of Ang II are mediated by AT1 receptors in the PVN, and the peripheral effects by a sympathetic-adrenal gland/beta-adrenoceptor pathway.",

The first featured a rhodopsin-like second extracellular loop, which interfered with ligand docking and with the orientation of several residues in the binding pocket. The second featured a second extracellular loop built completely de novo, which afforded a more accurate model of the binding pocket and a better docking of the ligand. Furthermore, incorporating available biochemical and computational data to the model by correcting the conformation of a single residue lining the binding pocket --Phe290(6.52)--, resulted in significantly improved docking poses.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers reduce mortality and should be administered to all patients unless contraindicated. Diuretics are indicated for symptomatic patients as needed for volume overload. Aldosterone antagonists and direct-acting vasodilators, such as isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine, may improve mortality in selected patients. Angiotensin receptor blockers can be used as an alternative therapy for patients intolerant of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and in some patients who are persistently symptomatic.

    "72": "The present study was designed to determine the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins (PG) in the stimulatory action of clenbuterol, a selective beta(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis under basal and social crowding stress conditions. Clenbuterol given i.c.v. (10 microg) or i.p. (0.2 mg/kg) considerably increased ACTH and corticosterone secretion. A selective beta(2)-receptor antagonist compound ICI 118551 and non-selective beta-receptor antagonist propranolol given by either route reduced the stimulatory action of clenbuterol. Crowding stress (21 rats in a cage for 7) for 3-7 days significantly reduced the i.c.v. clenbuterol-induced ACTH and corticosterone secretion and i.p. clenbuterol-elicited ACTH secretion. L-NAME, mainly endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) blocker, stronger than L-NNA, a neuronal NOS blocker, reduced the clenbuterol-evoked ACTH and corticosterone secretion in control rats but did not significantly alter this secretion already reduced by crowding stress. Piroxicam, predominantly constitutive cyclooxygenase (COX-1) inhibitor, given i.p. significantly diminished the i.p. clenbuterol-induced ACTH and corticosterone secretion in control rats and tended to reverse the reduction of ACTH secretion by crowding stress. These results indicate that clenbuterol, a selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, is much stronger stimulator of the HPA axis than isoprenaline, a non-selective beta-receptor agonist. Social crowding stress reduces to a larger extent the HPA response to beta(2)-receptor stimulation. Likewise, in the HPA axis stimulation via beta(2)-adrenoceptors endogenous NO and prostaglandins are significantly involved. Beta2-adrenoceptor is a dominant functional subtype of beta-receptor in the stimulatory and modulatory signals regulating the HPA axis activity under basal and social stress conditions.", 
    "73": "With the advent of numerous candidate drugs for therapy in cystic fibrosis (CF), there is an urgent need for easily interpretable assays for testing their therapeutic value. Defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) abolished beta-adrenergic but not cholinergic sweating in CF. Therefore, the beta-adrenergic response of the sweat gland may serve both as an in vivo diagnostic tool for CF and as a quantitative assay for testing the efficacy of new drugs designed to restore CFTR function in CF. Hence, with the objective of defining optimal conditions for stimulating beta-adrenergic sweating, we have investigated the components and pharmacology of sweat secretion using cell cultures and intact sweat glands. We studied the electrical responses and ionic mechanisms involved in beta-adrenergic and cholinergic sweating. We also tested the efficacy of different beta-adrenergic agonists. Our results indicated that in normal subjects the cholinergic secretory response is mediated by activation of Ca(2+)-dependent Cl(-) conductance as well as K(+) conductances. In contrast, the beta-adrenergic secretory response is mediated exclusively by activation of a cAMP-dependent CFTR Cl(-) conductance without a concurrent activation of a K(+) conductance. Thus, the electrochemical driving forces generated by beta-adrenergic agonists are significantly smaller compared with those generated by cholinergic agonists, which in turn reflects in smaller beta-adrenergic secretory responses compared with cholinergic secretory responses. Furthermore, the beta-adrenergic agonists, isoproprenaline and salbutamol, induced sweat secretion only when applied in combination with an adenylyl cyclase activator (forskolin) or a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, aminophylline or theophylline). We surmise that to obtain consistent beta-adrenergic sweat responses, levels of intracellular cAMP above that achievable with a beta-adrenergic agonist alone are essential. beta-Adrenergic secretion can be stimulated in vivo by concurrent iontophoresis of these drugs in normal, but not in CF, subjects.", 
    "74": "The effects of noradrenaline (NA) on the inhibitory responses to GABA were studied in vivo in neurons of the vestibular nuclei of the rat using extracellular recordings of single unit electrical activity and a microiontophoretic technique of drug application in loco. NA application influenced GABA-evoked inhibitions in 82% of tested neurons, depressing them in 42% and enhancing them in 40% of cases. The more frequent action of NA on GABA responses was depressive in lateral and superior vestibular nuclei (50% of neurons) and enhancing in the remaining nuclei (56% of neurons). The most intense effect of NA application was the enhancement of GABA responses induced in a population of lateral vestibular nucleus neurons, characterized by a background firing rate significantly higher than that of other units. The alpha(2) noradrenergic receptor agonist clonidine mimicked the enhancing action of NA on GABA responses; this action was blocked by application of the specific alpha(2) antagonist yohimbine. The beta adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induced either depressive or enhancing effects on GABA responses; the former more than the latter were totally or partially blocked by application of the beta antagonist timolol. It is concluded that NA enhances GABA responses by acting on noradrenergic alpha(2) and to a lesser extent beta receptors, whereas depressive action involves beta receptors only. These results confirm the hypothesis that the noradrenergic system participates in the regulation of the vestibulospinal and the vestibulo-ocular reflexes and suggest that conspicuous changes of NA content in brain due to aging or stress could lead to a deterioration in the mechanisms of normal vestibular function.",

We studied 148 consecutive patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < or = 45%), who underwent electrical CV for AF in our department. The patients had New York Heart Association heart failure ranging from class II to IV. The overall CV success rate was 71%. We relied on univariate and multivariate regression and sought variables influencing success rate. Conversion success did not correlate with New York Heart Association class. Instead, we found that the greatest predictor was the degree of heart failure treatment. Patients receiving beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotension receptor blockers, plus mineralocorticoid receptor blockers had the greatest chance for conversion success.

    "81": "Although it has been known that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) release is regulated through muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR), the mechanism by which this neurotransmitter regulates atrial ANP release is largely unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that K(+)(ACh) channels mediate the action of mAChR on atrial myocyte ANP release. Experiments were performed in perfused beating rabbit atria. Carbachol (CCh), an agonist of cardiac mAChR, increased atrial myocyte ANP release concomitantly with a decrease in stroke volume and intra-atrial pulse pressure in a concentration-dependent manner. Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, decreased ANP release concomitantly with an increase in cAMP and mechanical dynamics. In the presence of isoproterenol, the CCh-induced increase in ANP release and decrease in cAMP efflux levels and mechanical dynamics were able to be repeated. The CCh-induced changes were blocked by selective M(2) mAChR antagonists. Tertiapin, a selective G-protein-gated K(+)(ACh) channel blocker, attenuated the CCh-induced increase in ANP release and decrease in mechanical dynamics in a concentration-dependent manner, but without a significant effect on the CCh-induced decrease in cAMP efflux levels. The CCh-induced changes in ANP release and atrial dynamics were inhibited in the atria from pertussis toxin-pretreated rabbits. These findings demonstrate that G-protein-gated K(+)(ACh) channels regulate atrial myocyte ANP release. The present study also shows that mAChR and adrenoceptors have opposing roles in the regulation of ANP release.",

Members were included if they were (1) aged >or= 18 years, (2) continuously enrolled with the same commercial plan from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2005, (3) had any medical claims for hospitalization for ACS defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes 410.xx (acute myocardial infarction) or 411.1 (intermediate coronary syndrome) during the sample identification period from July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2004, and (4) had no medical claims for ACS hospitalizations from January 1, 2003, through June 30, 2003, in any of 10 diagnosis fields on an inpatient hospital claim. Pharmacy claims for ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, and statins were obtained for 18 months following each index date, defined as the earliest ACS diagnosis date during the identification period. Utilization was defined as the member having at least 1 pharmacy claim within each class from index date to 3 months post-index date. Five time periods were examined to assess therapy: - 180 to 0 days (6 months prior), 0 to 90 days (3 months), 0 to 180 days (6 months), 0 to 365 days (12 months), and 0 to 548 days (18 months) following the index date. ACE inhibitors and ARBs were considered together (i.e., a patient had to have at least 1 pharmacy claim for an ACE inhibitor or an ARB). Logistic regression analyses were used to predict use of the 3 drug classes for patients with different clinical (diagnosis and prior use) and demographic (sex and age) characteristics.",

Nearly 65% of the sample patients were men (n = 734 men and n = 401 women), with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 63.8 (SD 13.1) years. Of the 1,135 members with ACS, 588 (51.8%) had at least 1 pharmacy claim for an ACE inhibitor or ARB, 725 (63.9%) for a beta-blocker, and 710 (62.6%) for a statin during the 3-month follow-up period; receipt of at least 1 prescription in all 3 classes was found in 339 (29.9%) of patients. Patients who were aged < 45 years, 65-79 years, and e 80 years were significantly less likely than patients aged 45-64 years to receive statins (P < 0.05). In addition, patients who were aged e 80 years were significantly less likely to receive ACE inhibitors/ARBs (P = 0.003), beta-blockers (P < 0.001), or all 3 classes (P = 0.002). Women were less likely than men to receive statins (P = 0.004) and all 3 drug classes (P = 0.012). Patients with intermediate coronary syndrome were significantly less likely than those with acute myocardial infarction to receive any of the study drugs (P < 0.001). Those patients who had used ACE inhibitors/ARBs, beta-blockers, statins, and all 3 drug classes during the 6 months prior to the index diagnosis of ACS were more likely than those without prior use (odds ratios of 12.2, 9.4, 8.3, and 4.9, respectively, P < 0.001) to have these medications continued after ACS diagnosis.",

    "87": "In amyloid-beta (Abeta)-stimulated microglial cells, blockade of chloride intracellular ion channel 1 (CLIC1) reverts the increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha and nitric oxide (NO) production and results in neuroprotection of cocultured neurons. This effect could be of therapeutic efficacy in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where microglial activation may contribute to neurodegeneration, but it could reduce Abeta phagocytosis, which could facilitate amyloid plaque removal. Here, we analyzed the CLIC1 blockade effect on Abeta-stimulated mononuclear phagocytosis. In the microglial cell line BV-2, Abeta25-35 treatment enhanced fluorescent bead phagocytosis, which persisted also in the presence of IAA-94, a CLIC1 channel blocker. The same result was obtained in rat primary microglia and in BV2 cells, where CLIC1 expression had been knocked down with a plasmid producing small interfering RNAs. To address specifically the issue of Abeta phagocytosis, we treated BV-2 cells with biotinylated Abeta1-42 and measured intracellular amyloid by morphometric analysis. IAA-94-treated cells showed an increased Abeta phagocytosis after 24 hr and efficient degradation of ingested material after 72 hr. In addition, we tested Abeta1-42 phagocytosis in adult rat peritoneal macrophages. Also, these cells actively phagocytosed Abeta1-42 in the presence of IAA-94. However, the increased expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), stimulated by Abeta, was reverted by IAA-94. In parallel, a decrease in NO release was detected. These results suggest that blockade of CLIC1 stimulates Abeta phagocytosis in mononuclear phagocytes while inhibiting the induction of iNOS and further point to CLIC1 as a possible therapeutic target in AD.", 
    "88": "Conservative treatment of coronary heart disease is the therapeutic mainstay and includes various measures aimed at achieving a general reduction of risks. Giving up smoking is associated with a reduction of cardiovascular events of up to 50%. Physical endurance training as part of a rehabilitation program reduces cardiac mortality in CHD patients by approximately 30%, and, according to the most recent data, in selected patients represents an alternative to interventional measures. An appropriate diet can further reduce the risk of a cardiovascular event occurring. Acetylsalicylic acid, statins, ACE-blockers and beta-blockers are today standard medical treatment. Regrettably, however, considerable deficits in the implementation of the above measures for secondary prevention still persist.",

However, it is well recognized that responses to a beta-blocker are variable among patients with HF. Numerous studies now suggest that genetic polymorphisms may contribute to variability in responses to a beta-blocker, including left ventricular ejection fraction improvement, survival, and hospitalization due to HF exacerbation. This review summarizes the pharmacogenetic data for beta-blockers in patients with HF and discusses the potential implications of beta-blocker pharmacogenetics for HF patients.", 
    "90": "The endothelium plays a key role in the development of atherogenesis and its inflammatory and proliferative status influences the progression of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of two beta blockers such as nebivolol and atenolol on gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) following an oxidant stimulus. HUVECs were incubated with nebivolol or atenolol (10 micromol/L) for 24 hours and oxidative stress was induced by the addition of oxidized (ox)-LDL. Ox-LDL upregulated adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, ICAM-2, ICAM-3, E-selectin, and P-selectin); proteins linked to inflammation (IL-6 and TNFalpha), thrombotic state (tissue factor, PAI-1 and uPA), hypertension such as endothelin-1 (ET-1), and vascular remodeling such as metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9) and protease inhibitor (TIMP-1). The exposure of HUVECs to nebivolol, but not to atenolol, reduced these genes upregulated by oxidative stress both in terms of protein and RNA expression. The known antioxidant properties of the third generation beta blocker nebivolol seem to account to the observed differences seen when compared to atenolol and support the specific potential protective role of this beta blocker on the expression of a number of genes involved in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis.",

In addition, whereas PP amplification (PP, mm Hg) decreased with atenolol therapy (from 10 +/- 1 to 7 +/- 1, P < 0.01), it increased with nebivolol therapy (from 8 +/- 1 to 14 +/- 3, P < 0.01). Atenolol reduced heart rate to a greater extent than nebivolol did (14 +/- 3/min reduction by atenolol vs. 8 +/- 2/min reduction by nebivolol, P < 0.05). There was no difference between the two treatments in respect of the effect on transit time.", 
    "94": "The beta-blockers, atenolol and nebivolol, have a similar effect in reducing arterial stiffness in the large elastic aorta, largely secondary to BP reduction. Nebivolol, in contrast to atenolol, has an effect on small muscular arteries, increasing PP amplification and reducing wave reflection, possibly because of increased levels of nitric oxide (NO). Such ancillary properties may impart important distinct hemodynamic effects, and therefore beta-blockers cannot be regarded as a homogeneous group.",

Restricting analyses to the first two follow-ups to ensure highest statistical power, age >65 and diabetes were associated with higher PP/SVi at baseline and throughout follow-ups; black participants and women had baseline PP/SVi mean values comparable with those of their counterparts, showed blunted PP/SVi reduction after 1 year, but differences became smaller and not statistically significant at year 2 follow-up. Losartan- or atenolol-based treatments were associated with comparable reduction of PP/SVi. At year 2 follow-up, reduced PP/SVi was associated with greater reductions in mean blood pressure (BP) and heart rate and greater increase in SVi, but not with lower LV mass; RWT was lower with lower PP/SVi at year 2 follow-up.",

Patients at participating hospitals of Get with The Guidelines-CAD, a hospital performance improvement program, were entered into a registry. Factors associated with discharge lipid-lowering therapy prescription were identified and the effect of in-hospital low-density lipoprotein cholesterol measurement on therapy prescription was evaluated. A total of 98,880 patients were enrolled at 405 hospitals. At discharge, lipid-lowering therapy was prescribed in 84.7% of patients and was associated with percutaneous coronary intervention and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, aspirin, and beta-blocker therapies at discharge, but not cardiac rehabilitation referral or coronary artery bypass grafting (all p<0.0001). After adjustment for patient characteristics, men were more likely (odds ratio [OR] 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18 to 1.29; p<0.0001) and patients with heart failure were less likely to be prescribed lipid-lowering therapy (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.69, p<0.0001).

The NO-releasing beta-blocker nebivolol is a racemic mixture of D/L-enantiomers that displays negative inotropic as well as direct vasodilating activity. The in vivo antiatherogenic activity of therapeutic doses of the beta-blocker with antioxidant properties carvedilol (12.5mg/day) or nebivolol (5mg/day) was tested in cholesterol-fed rabbits. Animals received a 1% cholesterol-rich diet alone (controls) or mixed with drugs (treated animals) for 8 weeks. While it did not affect hyperlipidemia, nebivolol inhibited the development of atherosclerosis, expressed as computer-assisted imaging analysis of aortic area covered by lesions (23.3+/-4.1% in treated vs 38.2+/-6.4% in control animals, p<0.01). Differently, in our experimental condition of therapeutic drug doses, this antiatherogenic effect did not reach statistical significance in rabbits treated with carvedilol (32.5+/-5.1% aortic area covered by lesions, p=NS vs controls). Plasma nitrates increased in rabbits treated with nebivolol while both beta-blockers reduced LDL oxidation. Moreover, nebivolol induced a consistent increase of endothelial reactivity and aortic eNOS expression compared with control animals (p<0.05) and those receiving carvedilol (p<0.05). Since NO may exert beneficial effects in atherosclerosis, a NO-dependent mechanism could explain this data.

In order to simultaneously separate all analytes, Tris-H3PO4 solution was applied containing titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) as BGEs. The effects of important factors, such as concentration of TiO2 NPs, optimum pH, run buffer concentration, and separation voltage, were investigated so as to achieve best CE separation.

Given that GSK-3beta is known to modulate the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), we investigated the role of mPTP in the cardioprotective effect of morphine and the GSK-3beta inhibitor SB216763 [SB; 3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione] during ischemia-reperfusion. Both morphine (0.3 mg/kg) and SB (0.6 mg/kg) reduced infarct size in a model of regional myocardial ischemia-reperfusion in rats (13 +/- 1 and 14 +/- 3% of the area at risk versus 33 +/- 4% in controls; p < 0.05). Morphine and SB protected the ischemic myocardium against Ca(2+)-induced mPTP opening as demonstrated by the increased capacity of mitochondria to retain Ca(2+) when they were isolated from the ischemic zone 10 min after the onset of reperfusion (59 +/- 8 and 66 +/- 3 versus 29.5 +/- 6 nmol Ca(2+)/mg x protein, respectively; p < 0.05). This was associated with a restoration of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation parameters. In isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes subjected to anoxia-reoxygenation, morphine (2 microM), SB (3 microM), and the direct mPTP inhibitor cyclosporine A (3 microM) delayed mPTP opening as assessed by the calcein loading Co(2+)-quenching technique. This was accompanied by an increase in cell survival as measured by nuclear staining with propidium iodide. These in vitro effects of morphine on inhibition of mPTP opening during anoxia-reoxygenation were suppressed by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) inhibitor wortmannin (0.1 microM). These data indicate that the infarct-limiting effect of morphine and SB is linked by a cause-effect relationship, which leads to an increased mitochondrial resistance and inhibition of mPTP opening through the PI3-kinase pathway and subsequent inactivation of GSK-3beta.",

The presence of beta2 receptors on skeletal muscles and increased diaphragm contractility in vitro with salbutamol predict a significant effect that has not been confirmed, in vivo in non-fatigued diaphragm or in clinical studies using standard bronchodilator dosages. Therefore, we infused salbutamol at a higher dosage (23.3 microg/min) used clinically for treatment of respiratory emergencies, while measuring directly the length, shortening and EMG activation of costal and crural diaphragm, parasternal intercostal and transversus abdominis muscles, in 10 awake canines. At this salbutamol dosage, ventilation and tidal volume increased significantly during both resting and CO2-stimulated breathing. Salbutamol elicited significant increases in respiratory muscle shortening with much smaller increases in EMG activity, so the proportionally greater muscle shortening per unit EMG showed increased muscle contractility. The effects of salbutamol were not extinguished by inspiratory flow resistance or fluid challenge but were reversed specifically by the beta-blocker, propranolol. This study demonstrates that, in sufficient intravenous dosage, the beta-agonist salbutamol elicits increased ventilation and a beta2 receptor-mediated increase in contractility of respiratory muscles.",

Water flow through the membrane was measured gravimetrically in bladder sac preparations. Dobutamine had no effect on basal water transport, but partially inhibited transport stimulated by vasopressin. Similarly, dobutamine exerted no influence on the hydrosmotic response to 8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP, but interfered with the response to phosphodiesterase inhibitor 1-methyl-3-isobutyl-xanthine. These results demonstrate that this catecholamine may inhibit vasopressin-stimulated water transport at a site prior to cAMP formation. The use of propranolol was ineffective in blocking the effect of dobutamine on transport stimulated by vasopressin, indicating that beta-adrenoceptors play no role in this effect. On the other hand, phentolamine significantly reduced the effect of dobutamine, indicating the involvement of alpha-adrenoceptors in such event. Rauwolscine also inhibited the effect of dobutamine, pointing to the specific contribution of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptors to this effect. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that dobutamine inhibits vasopressin-stimulated water transport in toad bladders through a mechanism mediated by the stimulation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, thus suggesting that such a drug may exert a direct cellular effect on membrane permeability to water in transporting epithelia. The current study may provide a better understanding of the effects of dobutamine on renal function by contributing towards the elucidation of its action mechanism.",

    "135": "A steady state one-dimensional flow analysis was performed, utilising Newton's third law of motion. Five different clinical scenarios were evaluated: (1) effect of aortic curvature; (2) effect of beta-blockers, (3) effect of patient size, (4) forces on a Marfan's aorta, and (5) site of entry flap in aortic dissection.", 
    "136": "Aortic curvature increases the forces exerted on the ascending aorta by a factor of over 10-fold. Aortic curvature can cause patients with a systolic blood pressure of 8 0mmHg to have greater forces exerted on their aorta despite smaller diameters and lower cardiac outputs, than patients with systolic blood pressures of 120 mmHg. In normal diameter aortas, beta-blockers have minimal effect compared with aortic curvature. Aortic curvature may help to explain why normal diameter aortas can dissect, and also that the point of the entry tear may be potentially predictable. Aortic curvature has major effects on the forces exerted on the aorta in patients with Marfan's syndrome.", 
    "137": "Aortic curvature is relatively more important that aortic diameter, blood pressure, cardiac output, beta-blocker use, and patient size with regard to the force acting on the aortic wall. This may explain why some patients with normal diameter ascending aortas with or without Marfan's syndrome develop type A dissections and aneurysms. Aortic curvature may also help to explain the site of entry tear in acute type A dissection. Further clinical study is needed to validate this study's finding.", 
    "138": "Recent evidence shows that pink grapefruit juice, which is a recommended dietary addition that contains high amounts of the antioxidant flavonoid naringenin, prolongs the corrected QT (QT(c)), a noninvasive electrophysiological marker of spatial myocardial repolarization, and does so by inhibiting the rapid component of the delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Kr)). Prompted by the observation that all class III antiarrhythmic drugs inhibit this current, thereby sometimes provoking torsades de pointes, we compared the effects of a liter of freshly squeezed pink grapefruit juice with those of 2 commonly used class III antiarrhythmics amiodarone and sotalol on the major noninvasive markers of temporal variability in myocardial repolarization used to stratify the risk of sudden death from malignant ventricular arrhythmias. In 32 subjects, 10 with postischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, 12 with hypertensive cardiomyopathy, and 10 healthy, we assessed QT(c) and QT variability index (QTVI) after administration of fresh pink grapefruit juice, placebo, amiodarone, or sotalol. After pink grapefruit juice and sotalol, all these indexes increased significantly from values observed after placebo (P<0.05) and from values after amiodarone (P<0.05). Conversely, after amiodarone, QT(c), but not QTVI, increased significantly from values after placebo (P<0.05). Presumably because of its high naringenin glycoside content, pink grapefruit juice prolongs cardiac repolarization and concurrently increases temporal cardiac repolarization dispersion. The potential proarrhythmic actions of pink grapefruit juice might be of concern in patients with major myocardial structural disorders.",

He was followed up for 5 years. Significant improvement of psychiatric conditions and persistence of normal left ventricular function were obtained with combination treatment. beta-Blockers and ACE inhibitors may allow resumption of clozapine in refractory schizophrenia in whom it was withdrawn for cardiotoxicity.

Although the principal mechanics of MC seem to be relatively clear there are still open questions regarding the long-term clearance of particles. Therefore, we have developed a new set-up based on embryonic chicken trachea (ECT) to investigate mucociliary particle clearance in more detail. ECT was placed in an incubation chamber after carbon particles were applied and tracked using optical microscopy. The aim of the study was to validate this model by investigating the impact of temperature, humidity and drugs on particle transport rates. Particles were transported reproducibly along the trachea and clearance velocity (2.39 +/- 0.25) mm/min was found to be in accordance to data reported in literature. Variation in temperature resulted in significantly reduced MC: (0.40 +/- 0.12) mm/min (20 degrees C); (0.42 +/- 0.10) mm/min (45 degrees C). Decreasing humidity (99-60%) had no significant effect on MC, whereas reduction to 20% humidity showed a significant influence on particle clearance. The use of different cilio- and muco-active drugs (propranolol, terbutalin, N-acetylcysteine) resulted in altered MC according to the pharmacological effect of the substances: a concentration dependent decrease of MC was found for Propranolol. From our results we conclude that this model can be employed to investigate MC of particles in more detail. Hence, the model may help to understand and identify decisive physico-chemical parameters for MC and to answer open questions regarding the long-term clearance phenomenon.", 
    "159": "The vertebrate skeleton is richly innervated with adrenergic and peptidergic nerve terminals, and these play important roles in bone remodeling. Recent studies have generally shown that increased sympathetic nervous activity causes bone loss via an increase in bone resorption and a decrease in bone formation. Increased bone resorption is based on the stimulation of both osteoclast formation and osteoclast activity. These effects are associated with beta(2)-adrenergic activity toward both osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells. Such findings indicate that beta-blockers may be effective against osteoporosis, in which case there is increased sympathetic activity. This review summarizes evidence obtained both in vitro and in vivo implicating sympathetic neuron action in bone resorption.",

MMFs comprising of PHCl with Eudragit 100 (EUD100) and Chitosan (CHT), i.e. films with drug and polymers of opposing solubilities were successfully prepared (PHCl:EUD100:CHT; 1:10:0.5) and demonstrated uniform and reproducible drug content (100.71+/-2.66%), thickness (0.442+/-0.030 mm), mucoadhesivity (401.40+/-30.73 mN) and a controlled drug release profile. Drug release followed Higuchi's square-root model. Maximum swelling of the films occurred after 1h and 28.26% of the films eroded during the 8-h test period. Mechanical testing revealed that the MMFs displayed a greater abrasion resistance, were more elastic and also required more energy to break, rendering them tougher and more suitable for buccal delivery than the monopolymeric PHCl:EUD100 film. The inclusion of CHT to the film led to a more porous surface morphology. The surface pH of the films remained constant at neutral pH. This study confirmed the potential of the above MMFs as a promising candidate for buccal delivery of PHCl.",

The cells were treated with NTG (0.1-10 micromol/L) alone or concurrent incubation with different nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors. Nitric oxide (NO) production was measured by using a commercial NO kit. Cell proliferation was measured by 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation.

The increment of NO production was also correlated with the upregulation of osteoblastic markers in HBMSC cultures.

Betaxolol (10-20 mg/day) was given for 4 weeks, its efficacy was assessed by office blood pressure (BP) measurements, 24-hour BP and ECG monitoring and standard exercise test. At the end of the study significant lowering of systolic and diastolic BP was noted by 11,8 +/- 2,47 (p=0,001) and 7,8 +/- 1,68 mm Hg (p=0,001), respectively. Heart rate (HR) at rest lowered by 19,8 +/- 1,96 beats/min (p=0,0001). At analysis of individual reaction of patients to treatment with betaxolol it turned out that decrease of BP and HR was variable, but their distribution in the group did not differ significantly from normal. Hypotensive activity and influence on HR were confirmed by results of all instrumental investigations. No significant differences were revealed in dynamics of systolic and diastolic BP both at rest and at effort between patients with different genotypes of polymorphic marker Gly389Arg of ADRB1 gene. Compared with carriers of genotype Ser/Ser carriers of genotype Ser/Pro of polymorphic marker Pro34Ser of Cyp2D6 gene had significantly more pronounced decrease of HR at the background of treatment with betaxolol: - 32,6 +/- 4,77 and - 18,4 +/- 2,01 beats/min (p=0,023) at rest and - 30,1 +/- 3,05 and - 24,0 +/- 2,59 beats/min (p=0,043) at maximal exercise, respectively. These patients had also more pronounced lowering of diastolic BP at maximal work load and more pronounced increase of exercise duration at the background of treatment. Thus efficacy of betaxolol in patients with hypertension was associated solely with genotype of polymorphic marker Ser34Pro of CYP2D6 gene. In patients having in genotype Pro allele of polymorphic marker Pro34Ser of CYP2D6 gene therapy with betaxolol is more effective, than in homozygote carriers of Ser allele. This can be related to low rate of metabolism of the preparation in these patients.",

Histologic analysis showed that SHR had a lower capillary-to-fiber ratio in the skeletal muscle (WKY 1.74 +/- 0.08 and SHR 1.40 +/- 0.06, P < 0.01). Capillary volume density-to-fiber volume density ratio in the left ventricle of SHR was also reduced (WKY 0.55 +/- 0.09 and SHR 0.42 +/- 0.09, P < 0.01). The animals were treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril, the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1) receptor antagonist losartan, the beta-blocker atenolol, or the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, resulting in similar reductions in systolic blood pressure (19.8%, 19.1%, 17.4%, and 18.2%, respectively, P > 0.05). Atenolol did not induce any change in functional capillary density of SHR. Losartan and nifedipine completely reversed functional capillary rarefaction in both muscle and cutaneous tissues, whereas enalapril significantly increased functional capillary density only in the skin. The skeletal muscle capillary-to-fiber ratio was normalized by enalapril, losartan, and nifedipine. Treatments with enalapril or losartan normalized the cardiac structural capillary rarefaction of SHRs, whereas atenolol and nifedipine had no effect. Our results suggest that different pharmacologic classes of antihypertensive drugs with similar effect on blood pressure differ in terms of their effect on the microcirculation.",

This characterization is followed by application of the LCA-SP for separation of beta-blockers, phenylethylamines (PEAs), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Using the optimum mobile phase operating conditions (pH 3.0-4.5, 10 mM ammonium acetate, 85% v/v ACN), a comparison of the chromatographic ability of the aminopropyl silica phase vs. the LCA-bonded phase was conducted. The results showed improved selectivity for all test analytes using the latter phase. For example, the CEC-MS of beta-blockers demonstrated that the LCA-bonded phase provides separation of six out of seven beta-blockers, whereas the amino silica phase provides four peaks of several co-eluting beta-blockers. For the CEC-MS analysis of PEAs, the LCA-bonded phase showed improved resolution and different selectivity as compared to the aminopropyl phase. An evaluation of the retention trends for PEAs on both phases suggested that the PEAs were retained based on varying degree of hydroxyl substitution on the aromatic ring. In addition, the MS characterization shows several PEAs fragment in the electrospray either by loss of an alkyl group and/or by loss of H2O. Finally, the LCA-bonded phase displayed significantly higher separation selectivity for PAHs and PCBs as compared to the amino silica phase.",

    "180": "A total of 165 questionnaires were analyzed. Most participants were nephrologists (93.2%). There was a preference for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in at least two of the cases. Only 57.2% of the physicians were correct in choosing beta-blockers as the first-line drugs for patients with ischemic coronary disease. Moreover, 66.2% chose ACE inhibitors as the first-line drugs for patients with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria. About 5% of the physicians did not follow the current recommendations for the use of ACE inhibitors in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. The most controversial question concerned the first-line drug for advanced chronic kidney disease. Most physicians were correct in choosing calcium channel blockers and avoiding ACE inhibitors in renovascular hypertension in the case of a patient with a single functioning kidney.",

    "182": "Beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) blockade is a standard therapy for cardiac failure and ischemia. G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) desensitize betaARs, suggesting that genetic GRK variants might modify outcomes in these syndromes. Re-sequencing of GRK2 and GRK5 revealed a nonsynonymous polymorphism of GRK5, common in African Americans, in which leucine is substituted for glutamine at position 41. GRK5-Leu41 uncoupled isoproterenol-stimulated responses more effectively than did GRK5-Gln41 in transfected cells and transgenic mice, and, like pharmacological betaAR blockade, GRK5-Leu41 protected against experimental catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy. Human association studies showed a pharmacogenomic interaction between GRK5-Leu41 and beta-blocker treatment, in which the presence of the GRK5-Leu41 polymorphism was associated with decreased mortality in African Americans with heart failure or cardiac ischemia. In 375 prospectively followed African-American subjects with heart failure, GRK5-Leu41 protected against death or cardiac transplantation. Enhanced betaAR desensitization of excessive catecholamine signaling by GRK5-Leu41 provides a 'genetic beta-blockade' that improves survival in African Americans with heart failure, suggesting a reason for conflicting results of beta-blocker clinical trials in this population.", 
    "183": "We have previously reported that landiolol, an ultra-short-acting beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist, does not alter the anaesthetic effects of isoflurane. Here, we investigated the influence of propranolol on the electroencephalographic (EEG) effects and minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of isoflurane.",

The inhalation concentration was decreased to 0.5% and maintained for 25 min, before being returned to 2%, and maintained for a further 25 min. End-tidal isoflurane concentrations and spectral edge frequencies were recorded. Pharmacodynamic analysis was performed using a sigmoidal inhibitory maximal effect model for spectral edge frequency vs effect-site concentration. After measurement of the EEG effect, MAC was determined using the dew-claw clamp technique, in which movement in response to clamping is recorded. After completion of control measurements, a propranolol 4 mg bolus followed by an infusion (2 mg h(-1)) was started. After a 30 min stabilization period, the inhalation concentration of isoflurane was varied as in the control period and MAC was re-assessed.",

We evaluated the hypothesis that the addition of an aldosterone receptor antagonist to an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin II type 1 (AT-1) receptor blocker (ARB) (triple RAAS blockade) may provide an additional benefit compared with an ACE inhibitor and ARB (double RAAS blockade).",

    "195": "There are evidence suggesting that the function of adrenergic receptor is affected in the amygdala of animals with anxiety-like behavior. However, beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) subtypes, consisting of three subtypes, exert different effects on anxiety regulation. In order to determine the function of the beta1-AR subtype in anxiety-like behavior, we investigated the change of beta1-AR expression by immunostaining in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of rats treated by conditional fear training. The results indicated that the level of beta1-AR was significantly increased in the BLA of fear-conditioned animals as compared that of controls. In animal behavioral tests, animals treated with selective beta1-AR antagonist metoprolol before conditional fear training exhibited a significant attenuation of anxiety-like behavior characterized by increased percentage of time spent and percentage of entries in the open arms, and increased number of head-dips in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test compared with the animals treated with only saline. Furthermore, the rats pretreated with metoprolol in the conditional fear training significantly decreased the freezing behavior in the test compared with the controls. The results suggested that the beta1-AR played an important role in anxiety-like behavior, and inhibition of the beta1-AR in the BLA could produce anxiolytic effect.",

    "201": "The syncope is a clinical entity characterized by sudden and transient loss of consciousness and postural tone, with a quick and complete recovery. The syncope is frequent in children and adolescents. The most common cause is neurocardiogenic (vasovagal), which has a benign evolution. Other causes may be neurological, cardiac and metabolic diseases, with a variable prognosis, which may come to be severe and potentially lethal. Evaluation of the syncope is mainly based on present clinical history, and on a detailed clinical examination. Basic complementary exams may help on the diagnosis, as a glycemia test, determination of electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium), a hemogram and an electrocardiogram. The Tilt Test is \"the\" test to confirm the neurocardiogenic syncope. Treatment is indicated in syncopes with recurrent episodes or with risk of physical lesions. Prevention and education are indicated for all patients. Specific treatment should be individually given to each patient. In the case of neurocardiogenic syncope, beta-blockers, alpha-adrenergic stimulants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and fludrocortisone are used. In the frequently recurrent neurocardiogenic syncope, when preventive actions are not enough or there is risk of lesions in consequence of falls, beta-blockers, alpha-adrenergic stimulants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and fludrocortisone are used, as well as a pacemaker for severe cases non-responsive to pharmacological treatment.",

    "203": "Beta2-adrenergic receptors are expressed on different cell types in the lung, including respiratory epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages. The aim of the current study was to determine the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in the regulation of lung inflammation induced by instillation via the airways of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (a constituent of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA) (a component of the gram-positive bacterial cell wall). Mice inhaled the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol or saline 30 minutes before and 3 hours after intranasal LPS or LTA administration. LPS and LTA induced a profound inflammatory response in the lungs as reflected by an influx of neutrophils and the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Propranolol inhalation resulted in enhanced LPS-induced lung inflammation, which was reflected by a stronger secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 into BALF and by enhanced coagulation activation (thrombin-antithrombin complexes). In LTA-induced lung inflammation, propranolol did not influence cytokine release but potentiated activation of coagulation. Propranolol did not alter neutrophil recruitment in either model. This study suggests that beta-adrenergic receptors, which are widely expressed in the lungs, serve as negative regulators of pulmonary cytokine release and coagulation induced by LPS and less so during LTA-induced pulmonary inflammation.",
