    "0": "In vitro exposure of rat cerebrocortical slices to microM concentrations of serotonin (5HT) results in an increased response of adenylate cyclase to isoproterenol (ISO). No change in the affinity of the beta-adrenoceptor toward the agonist was found after 5HT exposure when measuring ISO displacement of [3H]CGP 12177 binding. A similar increase of adenylate cyclase response was also found when using VIP as a stimulatory agent. The dose-response curve of adenylate cyclase to the GTP analogue, GppNHp, was modified by 5HT, which promotes a significantly higher maximal response without altering the potency of GppNHp. Forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was not affected by 5HT. Serotonergic 5HT2 receptors are involved in the sensitization of adenylate cyclase to GppNHp, since the selective 5HT2 antagonist ketanserin inhibits the effect of 5HT, whereas the 5HT2 agonist DOI mimics 5HT. The involvement of 5HT2 receptor-coupled activation of protein kinase C is also demonstrated: direct protein kinase C activators such as phorbol esters and s,n-dioctanoylglycerol behave in the same manner as 5HT, while the protein kinase C inhibitor CGP 41251 prevents 5HT from increasing adenylate cyclase responsiveness to GppNHp. Moreover, in vitro exposure of cortical slices to 5HT results in reduced inhibition of adenylate cyclase by somatostatin. Since no change was observed at the receptor level and in the direct stimulation of the catalytic subunit of the enzyme, we propose that 5HT might accomplish the sensitization of adenylate cyclase through protein kinase C by inactivating the inhibitory coupling protein Gi and facilitating the interaction of the exogenous GppNHp with the stimulatory coupling protein Gs.", 
    "1": "Although the haemodynamic effects of catecholamines on the rat left ventricle have been investigated extensively, only few systematic in vivo studies have been performed on the right ventricle. The aim was to examine the acute effects of noradrenaline and isoproterenol on rat right ventricular function.", 
    "2": "Haemodynamic variables were measured during acute, 20 minute infusion of noradrenaline (0.1 mg.kg-1 x h-1) or isoproterenol (12 micrograms.kg-1 x h-1) in female Sprague Dawley rats. To estimate the contribution of alpha and beta receptor stimulation to these effects, eight rats each were infused with prazosin (0.1 mg.kg-1 x h-1), metoprolol (1.0 mg.kg-1 x h-1), or the alpha and beta antagonist carvedilol (0.5 and 1.0 mg.kg-1 x h-1) alone and in combination with noradrenaline or isoproterenol.", 
    "3": "Noradrenaline and isoproterenol increased right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) from 30.3 (SEM 0.5) (n = 32) to 72.7(2.7) (n = 24) and 72.3(4.4) (n = 8) mm Hg, right ventricular (RV) dP/dtmax from 1848(70.3) to 4058(301) and 3612(366) mm Hg.s-1, and heart rate from 329(6) to 371(6) and 420(8) beats.min-1, respectively. Metoprolol completely prevented the isoproterenol induced haemodynamic changes, but neither metoprolol nor prazosin was able to significantly affect the pressure effect of noradrenaline (noradrenaline + metoprolol: 67.3(6.9) mm Hg, noradrenaline + prazosin: 67.0(3.8) mm Hg). The combination of both blockers, however, prevented the noradrenaline induced rise in RVSP (noradrenaline + metoprolol + prazosin: 36.5(5.1), and noradrenaline + prazosin + metoprolol: 30.0(1.2) mm Hg). Carvedilol (1.0 mg.kg-1 x h-1) significantly attenuated the noradrenaline induced RVSP increase (39.1(3.0) mm Hg), but not to the control range. Metoprolol or carvedilol completely prevented the noradrenaline elicited increases in heart rate (254(7) and 287(20) min-1) and RVdP/dtmax, but prazosin alone had no effect on the heart rate and RVdP/dtmax increase. Thus beta receptor blockade alone failed to significantly influence the noradrenaline induced increase of RVSP despite prevention of the increase in heart rate and RVdP/dtmax. Prazosin had a significant effect on RVSP only in combination with metoprolol.", 
    "4": "The combined effect of both alpha and beta blockade exceeds the pure addition of the single effects in the rat right ventricle. Moreover, we speculate that the failure to reduce the noradrenaline induced increase in RVSP by either alpha or beta blockade alone is due to the stimulation of the receptor that is not affected by the respective blocker.", 
    "5": "This experiment examines whether the thermoregulatory ability of obese Zucker rats is comparable to that of lean rats following treatment with beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists in a cold (-8 degrees C) environment. Half-maximal doses of the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol (ISO) produced net thermolytic (heat loss) effects in both obese and lean rats in an operant lever pressing for radiant heat task. ISO increased the demand for heat, but posttest colonic temperature (Tc) decreased. A low dose of propranolol (100 micrograms/kg) normalized thermoregulatory behavior, Tc, and thermal balance when coadministered with ISO. Activation of thermogenesis with the selective beta 3-agonist BRL 35135 (BRL) reduced heat influx by both obese and lean rats at doses between 2 and 10 micrograms/kg, but no dose-response effects were evident within this range. Posttest Tc and thermal balance indicated no thermolytic effects. No evidence was found for a beta 2-component in the BRL response when a supramaximal dose (40 micrograms/kg) was tested with the selective beta 2-antagonist ICI 118551 (1 mg/kg). These data show that, despite a higher baseline demand for heat, the obese Zucker rat responds to the thermogenic effects of BRL and the thermolytic effects of ISO as does the lean rat.", 
    "6": "Nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers (propranolol and nadolol) are effective in preventing initial variceal hemorrhage, although their influence on improving survival is less dramatic. There is no role for either sclerotherapy or prophylactic portosystemic shunts for the prevention of initial variceal hemorrhage. Both endoscopic therapy (sclerotherapy, esophageal variceal ligation) and nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers are effective in reducing the risk of recurrent bleeding related to portal hypertension; however, there are significant numbers of failures with both approaches, and the effect on survival is less impressive. Randomized controlled trials evaluating each of these therapeutic options are reviewed in this article.", 
    "7": "1. The vasoconstrictor effects of noradrenaline applied to the intimal and adventitial surfaces of perfused segments of rat tail artery in the presence and absence of endothelium were studied. 2. Noradrenaline was about six times more potent as a vasoconstrictor when applied to the intimal than to the adventitial surface. Cocaine (25 mumol/L) enhanced responses to adventitial noradrenaline to a greater extent than those to intimal noradrenaline. A high concentration of propranolol (1 mumol/L) had a similar effect. 3. The vasoconstriction elicited by adventitial noradrenaline declined from a peak whereas that to intimal noradrenaline remained steady. A low concentration of propranolol (0.1 mumol/L) abolished the decline in the response to adventitial noradrenaline. 4. The alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin (1 nmol/L) and idazoxan (100 nmol/L) significantly reduced responses to intimal and adventitial noradrenaline in the presence or absence of endothelium. 5. Removal of endothelium enhanced responses to intimal but not adventitial noradrenaline. Idazoxan produced a significantly greater reduction of responses to noradrenaline in the absence than in the presence of endothelium, and was more effective against intimal than adventitial noradrenaline. Similar effects were produced by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME (30 mumol/L). 6. It was concluded that noradrenaline acts on both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors to produce vasoconstriction: the alpha 1-adrenoceptors appear to be uniformly distributed, whereas alpha 2-adrenoceptors are located nearer the intima. Intimal noradrenaline also acts on endothelial alpha 2-adrenoceptors to release EDRF which counteracts the vasoconstrictor action of noradrenaline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "1. Adhesion of neutrophils to vascular endothelium plays an important role in inflammation and thrombosis. Modulation of adhesion may be therapeutic in these conditions. 2. A flow model was used to quantify adhesion of neutrophils to human cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells. The time course of the neutrophil response to activation by N-formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fMLP, 10(-7) M) was studied and the inhibitory effects of the calcium-channel blockers, nitrendipine and nifedipine, were investigated. 3. Neutrophils adhered firmly to the endothelial cells without rolling, but initial attachment was highly dependent on shear stress; doubling the stress from 0.05 to 0.1Pa decreased the number of neutrophils adhering by over 80%. 4. Adhesion rapidly increased after activation of neutrophils by fMLP, peaking at 1-3 min post-treatment, and then decreased over the next 10-12 min. A monoclonal antibody to the beta 2-integrin component CD18 inhibited adhesion by over 80% for activated or unactivated cells. 5. The Ca-channel blocker, nitrendipine, but not nifedipine, significantly inhibited the fMLP-induced increase of adhesion in a dose-dependent manner (10(-8) to 10(-6) M). Dihydropyridines may be useful agents for modifying neutrophil function.", 
    "9": "1. The relaxant effects of Zeneca ZD7114, BRL37344 (putative beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists) and various phenylethylamine-based agonists were studied in isolated ileum of the rat where tone was increased with carbachol (0.5 microM). Agonist-induced relaxation.was measured under equilibrium conditions with alpha-, beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors inhibited. 2. Relaxant responses were obtained to isoprenaline, noradrenaline, and BRL37344, although, the efficacy of this latter agent was significantly.lower than that of isoprenaline. Salbutamol caused weak relaxation (< 20%) at high concentrations (10 microM) and ZD7114 was without significant relaxant effect even at high concentrations (10 microM). 3. Relaxant responses to isoprenaline and BRL37344 were weakly antagonized by high concentrations of (+/-)-propranolol (10 and 100 microM) yielding pKB values of 5.7 with isoprenaline as the agonist and 5.5 with BRL37344 as the agonist. 4. The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, (+/-)-alprenolol (1-100 microM) caused competitive antagonism of the relaxant responses to isoprenaline (pA2 value = 6.5). A similar pKB value was obtained when BRL37344 was used as the agonist (6.4). 5. Relaxant effects of isoprenaline and BRL37344 were also antagonized by ZD7114 (1-100 microM) yielding pA2 and pKB values of 6.3 and 6.7 respectively. 6. The low potencies of (+/-)-propranolol and (+/-)-alprenolol as antagonists of the relaxant responses to isoprenaline and BRL37344 indicate that both the agonists and antagonists employed in the current study may interact with beta 3-adrenoceptors in the rat isolated ileum. Contrary to the previous findings in guinea-pig ileum, where BRL37344 and ZD7114 were full agonists, in the current study, BRL37344 was a partial agonist and ZD7114 an antagonist at the beta 3-adrenoceptor in rat ileum.", 
    "10": "Radioligand binding studies were performed to investigate total beta-adrenoceptor density (Bmax) and beta 1 and beta 2 subtype distribution in left ventricular biopsies obtained from 8 prospective transplant donors serving as controls and from 143 patients with different degrees of heart failure (NYHA class II to IV) undergoing aortic or mitral valve surgery due to aortic or mitral stenosis, aortic or mitral regurgitation, as well as combined aortic or mitral valve lesions (stenosis and regurgitation). In 13 other patients, heart failure was due to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (N = 6, NYHA III), tetralogy of Fallot (N = 4, NYHA III), or Becker's muscular dystrophy (N = 3, NYHA IV). Bmax was assessed by (-)-(125I)-iodocyanopindolol used as radioligand. Competition experiments with the highly selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712A were performed for determination of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor subtypes. In biopsies taken from transplant donors, the Bmax was found to be 70.1 +/- 5.8 fmol/mg protein. In all groups investigated the extent of total beta-adrenoceptor downregulation was related to the degree of heart failure. The decrease in Bmax was found to be about 20% (NYHA II), 45% (NYHA III), and 60% (NYHA IV) when compared with controls. There was no significant difference in the reduction of total beta-adrenoceptor density between isolated aortic or mitral valve diseases and combined valve lesions. Independent of the degree of heart failure, selective downregulation of the beta 1 subtype was found in patients with isolated or combined aortic valve diseases, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and Becker's muscular dystrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "The current studies were designed to evaluate the effectiveness of beta-adrenergic antagonists on opiate withdrawal symptoms utilizing a variety of paradigms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were made moderately dependent on morphine with daily incremental injections. Both the nonselective beta-antagonist propranolol and the selective beta 1-antagonist atenolol, in the dose range of 5 to 20 mg/kg, were found to significantly reduce many of the somatic responses to either naloxone-precipitated or abstinence-induced withdrawal from morphine. In addition, propranolol (10 mg/kg) significantly reduced a withdrawal-induced conditioned place aversion, while atenolol was effective only at the highest dose tested (20 mg/kg). These data indicate that beta-adrenergic antagonists might be effective in the treatment of opiate addictions.", 
    "12": "Intense neurohormonal activation is characteristic of heart failure and contributes to the progression of ventricular dysfunction in this syndrome. Drugs that diminish neurohormonal arousal have a beneficial effect upon morbidity and mortality in chronic heart failure. The pathophysiology of neurohormonal activation in chronic heart failure is reviewed in this article to provide a basis for understanding intervention with agents that block the actions of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic systems. Also covered is the description of the pharmacologic actions of these two classes of drugs and patient outcomes associated with their use.", 
    "13": "Propionate (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 mumol.kg BW-1 x min-1 for 30 min) was infused i.v. to investigate the physiological effects of propionate on insulin and glucagon responses in sheep. An i.v. propionate infusion (32 mumol.kg BW-1 x min-1 for 30 min) with adrenergic and cholinergic blockades was also conducted to clarify the role of autonomic innervation in the control of propionate-induced insulin and glucagon responses. In the experiment in which we studied responses to propionate infusion, the concentrations of plasma insulin and glucagon during propionate infusion increased (P < .05) from the preinfusion concentrations at infusion rates of > 4 and 8 mumol.kg BW-1 x min-1, respectively. The incremental response areas of plasma insulin and glucagon during propionate infusion increased (P < .05) at infusion rates of > 16 and 32 mumol.kg BW-1 x min-1, respectively. In the experiment studying the effects of adrenergic and cholinergic blockades on responses to propionate, the insulin incremental response area during propionate infusion was suppressed (P < .05) by atropine infusion but it was not influenced by phentolamine, propranolol, or hexamethonium infusions. The glucagon response area was suppressed (P < .05) by phentolamine infusion, but it was not influenced by propranolol, atropine, or hexamethonium infusions. It is concluded that in sheep 1) propionate may have a physiological role in stimulating insulin and glucagon responses, 2) the propionate-induced insulin response is partly due to the parasympathetic nervous system through activation of a muscarinic receptor, and 3) the propionate-induced glucagon response is stimulated by adrenergic alpha-receptors.", 
    "14": "A case of deglutition syncope of 20 years' duration in a patient without cardiac or esophageal disease is presented. The therapeutic efficacy of beta-blockade is documented by symptomatic improvement, repeat esophageal balloon inflation and tilt-table testing. This suggests the Bezold-Jarisch reflex or sympathetic nervous system may be involved in the pathogenesis of deglutition syncope.", 
    "15": "With respect to the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors (ARs), the beta 3-AR induces specific physiological effects in a few target tissues and exhibits atypical pharmacological properties that distinguish it unambiguously from its counterparts. Therefore, the beta 3-AR represents a suitable model to study the molecular mechanism responsible for receptor subtype selectivity and specificity. Potent beta 3-AR ligands newly characterized in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the beta 3-AR were also evaluated in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing beta 1- and beta 2-ARs and were classified into three groups according to their pharmacological properties. Among the beta 1/beta 2/beta 3 agonists BRL 37344 and LY 79771 exhibit beta 3 selectivity in stimulating adenylyl cyclase; among the beta 1/beta 2 antagonists displaying beta 3 agonistic effects ICI 201651 exhibits beta 3-AR binding selectivity, whereas among the beta 1/beta 2/beta 3 antagonist class bupranolol is the most efficient (but not selective) beta 3-AR antagonist. The structures of these ligands were simulated and compared using computer-generated molecular modeling. Structure-activity relationship analysis indicates that potent or selective beta 3-AR compounds, in addition to possessing a pharmacophore common to all beta-AR ligands, contain a long and bulky alkylamine substituent moiety, which is able to adopt and exchange extended and stacked conformations. Computerized three-dimensional models of the beta 1-, beta 2-, and beta 3-AR binding sites show that more bulky amino acid side chains point inside the groove of the beta 1 and beta 2 sites, compared with the beta 3 site, in a region implicated in signal processing. The long alkylamine chain of compounds behaving as beta 1/beta 2 antagonists and beta 3 agonists may thus adopt either a stacked conformation in the encumbered beta 1- and beta 2-AR sites, leading to antagonistic effects, or an extended conformation in the less encumbered beta 3 site, thus interacting with specific residues implicated in signal transduction.", 
    "16": "We studied the regulation of beta-adrenergic receptor (AR) subtypes co-existing in rat C6 glioma cells to clarify the importance of subtype ratio in responses to catecholamines. Radioligand binding studies with [125I]-cyanopindolol showed that beta 1- and beta 2-ARs co-existed in this cell line in approximately an 80:20 ratio. Norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EPI) were equally potent in increasing cAMP accumulation, consistent with a primarily beta 1-response, although both beta 1- and beta 2-components of the response could be isolated using selective agonists (NE and zinterol), and antagonists (CGP 20712A and ICI 118,551). Little or no evidence of beta 3-ARs could be found in this cell line. Treatment of cells with 500 nM dexamethasone (DEX) for 48 hr increased the proportion of beta 2-ARs (20 to 60%). However, a reciprocal decrease in beta 1-ARs resulted in no change in total beta-ARs. Studies on the time-(12 to 72 hr) and concentration- (5 nM to 5000 nM) dependence of DEX treatment showed that increases in beta 2-ARs were closely linked to decreases in beta 1-ARs with little or no change in total receptor density observed at any time or in any concentration studied. Treatment with DEX also increased beta 2- and decreased beta 1-mediated cAMP responses, but did not alter the response to the nonselective agonist, isoproterenol. Northern blot analysis showed a 2- to 3-fold increase in beta 2-AR mRNA, but no change in beta 1-AR mRNA, after exposure to 50 or 500 nM DEX for 48 hr. Surprisingly, after DEX treatment, NE and EPI were still equally potent in activating cAMP accumulation, although responses to the beta 2-selective agonist, zinterol, were increased. These studies show a close reciprocal regulation by DEX of the relative proportions of beta 1- and beta 2-AR subtypes in C6 cells. The functional significance of the changing subtype ratios does not appear to be related to catecholamine responsiveness.", 
    "17": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the mechanisms of the renin secretion response to the angiotensin II (AII) receptor type 1 (AT1) antagonist losartan (DuP 753) in anesthetized rabbits. All receptor blockade with losartan (4 mg/kg bolus and 2 mg/kg/hr i.v.) decreased blood pressure (BP) and increased plasma renin activity (PRA) and heart rate (HR) significantly, whereas the beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (0.02 mg/kg/min i.v.) caused significant reductions in these parameters. Atenolol blocked HR and PRA responses but not the effect of losartan on BP. Cyclooxygenase inhibition with indomethacin (5 mg/kg bolus and 40 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) did not result in significant effects, and the coadministration of indomethacin and losartan resulted in a greater PRA effect than with losartan alone. These results preclude the involvement of prostaglandins, such as PGE2 and PGI2, in the renin response to losartan. The PRA response to atenolol alone suggests that renin release in anesthetized rabbits is under tonic control by beta adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, the discrepancy in the PRA responses to equipotent hypotensive doses of hydralazine and losartan indicates that beta adrenoceptor activation in the kidney, probably the result of blockade of AII-mediated inhibition of renin secretion, contributes to the renin-releasing effect of the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan.", 
    "18": "The increased incidence and prevalence of congestive heart failure place a high priority on novel treatment strategies. Left ventricular ejection fraction remains the single most valuable measurement providing both diagnostic and prognostic insights. The most systematic approach to heart failure involves an objective assessment of functional disability, to include exercise tests such as a 6-minute walk under standardized conditions. Left ventricular dysfunction incites a host of neurohumoral compensations that are of fundamental importance in the heart failure syndrome expression. Both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator neurohormones are stimulated and provide new therapeutic opportunities. The therapeutic approach to heart failure begins with a strong emphasis on prevention, patient education, and self-participation in therapy with respect to both its monitoring and adjustment. Diuretics remain a mainstay of therapy but, in the face of severe heart failure, may become ineffectual, requiring constant infusion of loop-active diuretics, combination diuretics, or diuretics in association with concomitant low-dose dopamine infusion. Vasodilator therapy has been an important advance: combination hydralazine and nitrate therapy was initially shown to be efficacious in improving survival, and more recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, in the form of enalapril, have shown incremental benefit on survival over this combination. Interestingly, there is now evidence from both SOLVD and SAVE to demonstrate an unexpected and, as yet, unexplained reduction in the frequency of both unstable angina and myocardial infarction. Although, on balance, the weight of evidence concerning the long-term efficacy of inotropic agents has been disappointing, especially as it relates to their unfavorable effects on survival, recent information on vesnarinone, an agent with a complex and diversified mechanism of action, suggests that with appropriate doses, improved symptoms and survival are possible. A substantial amount of new information from randomized placebo-controlled trials attests to the symptomatic relief, hemodynamic improvement, and gain in exercise performance achieved by digoxin. A long-term survival study is ongoing to assess its effects on mortality. beta-Blockers, especially metoprolol, appear beneficial in some patients with heart failure, possibly related to their reduction in sympathetic nervous activity and restoration of beta-receptor population, with resultant improved contractile performance, enhanced myocardial relaxation, and overall increase in cardiac efficiency. Based on available evidence, the best contemporary approach to treatment involves the use of ACE inhibitors coupled with diuretic therapy, either continuous or intermittent, to relieve central or peripheral congestion. The addition of digoxin or a hydralazine nitrate combination is a logical next step, with commencement of low-dose beta-blocker a reasonable option.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "19": "Downregulation of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density does not occur in a spatially uniform distribution in patients with congestive heart failure. Rather, it results primarily from loss of receptors in the subendocardium. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, beta 1-receptors have been found to be downregulated selectively. These observations suggest that considerable transmural heterogeneity in the distribution of beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes exists in the failing human heart. The present study was designed to test this hypothesis.", 
    "20": "We used quantitative autoradiography of radioligand binding sites to measure the distribution of beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes in transmural sections of left ventricular myocardium obtained from cardiac transplant patients with ischemic (n = 13) and idiopathic dilated (n = 12) cardiomyopathy and from 4 subjects with no history of cognitive heart failure. Analysis of radioligand binding isotherms revealed a significant reduction in total beta-adrenergic receptor density in hearts of patients with ischemic and idiopathic cardiomyopathy (20.3 +/- 1.9 and 18.2 +/- 2.0 fmol/mg protein, respectively, versus 40.0 +/- 11.4 in control subjects; P < .01 for both). Loss of the beta 1-subtype accounted for 86% of the total reduction in beta-receptor density in failing hearts. Despite the significant decreases in overall tissue receptor content, the densities of total beta-receptors and beta-receptor subtypes in subepicardial myocytes were equivalent in failing and control hearts. However, in contrast to control hearts, in which the transmural distribution of total and beta 1-receptors was uniform (endocardial: epicardial receptor density ratios, 0.97 +/- 0.14 and 1.0 +/- 0.2, respectively), hearts of patients with ischemic and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy had significantly lower total beta-receptor and beta 1-receptor densities in the subendocardium (ratios, 0.66 +/- 0.06 and 0.46 +/- 0.09 for total and beta 1-receptors, respectively, in ischemic cardiomyopathy and 0.60 +/- 0.08 and 0.52 +/- 0.11 in dilated cardiomyopathy; P < .001 for all values compared with a ratio of 1). Thus, beta 1: beta 2 receptor density ratios were markedly decreased in the subendocardium of ischemic and idiopathic dilated left ventricles compared with control hearts.",

    "22": "The protective effects of carvedilol, a new beta-adrenergic receptor blocker and vasodilating antihypertensive agent, against oxygen free radical-mediated injury were studied in cultured bovine endothelial cells and compared with five other beta-blockers. Carvedilol dose-dependently inhibited oxygen radical-induced lipid peroxidation (50% inhibition at 2.6 mumol/L) and glutathione depletion (50% inhibition at 1.8 mumol/L) in the cells. Under the same conditions, other beta-blockers--propranolol, labetalol, pindolol, atenolol, and celiprolol--had only mild or no effect. Moreover, carvedilol protected against oxygen radical--mediated cell damage, as assessed by cellular lactate dehydrogenase release, with a 50% inhibition at 4.1 mumol/L and increased the cell survival in a dose-dependent manner, whereas other beta-blockers had mild or no effects. Pretreatment of the cells with carvedilol for 7 days significantly enhanced the protective effects of carvedilol. Using 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane as a trapping agent, the spin adduct in cell lipids was monitored by electron paramagnetic resonance. Carvedilol dose-dependently decreased the intensity of the free radical signals, indicating its free radical-scavenging ability. The prevention of oxidative injury to endothelial cells might potentially contribute to the clinical beneficial effects of carvedilol as an antihypertensive agent.", 
    "23": "The effects of levamisole on the guinea-pig atrial preparation were determined. At 3 micrograms/ml, levamisole and lignocaine prevented electrically induced arrhythmia in 3 and 5 out of 5 preparations respectively. It was concluded that levamisole at the therapeutic anthelmintic dose would not abolish clinical atrial arrhythmia. Levamisole even at 3 micrograms/ml had definite salutary effect on the hypodynamic state induced by continuous electrical stimulation. The dose-related positive inotropic effect of levamisole 5-200 micrograms/ml was not antagonised by practolol but was absent in atria from reserpinized animals. Therefore, cAMP may not be involved in the positive inotropic effect. Levamisole antagonised verapamil-induced negative inotropic effect and no positive inotropic effect was observed when the Ca2+ content of the Ringer-Locke solution was below normal. These suggested that Ca2+ must be involved in the inotropic effect. The negative chronotropic effect due to levamisole was not antagonised by hexamethonium but was antagonised by atropine, thus indicating that stimulation of M1 or M2 receptors in the atria may be responsible.", 
    "24": "Studies in fasted, anaesthetized rats have shown that adrenaline and nicotine-induced hyperglycaemia is mediated via activation of beta-adrenoceptors. The hyperglycaemic response to nicotine is different from that of adrenaline in that, unlike adrenaline hyperglycaemia, nicotine hyperglycaemia is characterized by a long latent period, delayed attainment of peak of response and sustained hyperglycaemia throughout the 120 minutes post-injection observation. Comparison with previous studies in dogs showed that different receptors are involved in nicotine hyperglycaemia in fasted dogs and fasted rats.", 
    "25": "Dependence of protein N-glycosylation on capillary endothelial cell proliferation has been studied. Amphomycin, a potent N-glycosylation inhibitor, inhibited capillary endothelial cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. beta-Agonist isoproterenol as well as other intracellular cAMP enhancing agents, viz. cholera toxin, prostaglandin E1 and 8Br-cAMP, also enhanced capillary endothelial cell proliferation. In addition to cell proliferation, isoproterenol also enhanced protein glycosylation in these cells. Isoproterenol effect was mediated by beta-adrenoreceptors, as it got reduced on pre-treatment of cells with either atenolol or ICI 118, 551 or propranolol. Furthermore, isoproterenol stimulation of protein glycosylation by exogenous dolichyl monophosphate and its inhibition by tunicamycin (GlcNAc-1P transferase inhibitor) supported the concept that isoproterenol specifically stimulated protein N-glycosylation event(s) in the cell.", 
    "26": "Substance P, given intrathecally at the second (T2) or ninth (T9) thoracic level in the anesthetized rat, increased heart rate, arterial pressure and circulating catecholamines. At T9 in adrenalectomized animals and at T2 in intact animals, the cardioacceleration was more abrupt than in intact animals injected at T9 suggesting that the adrenals are not necessary for the cardiovascular responses and that the adrenals may have released a factor which slows the neurally mediated cardioacceleration. As opioids are co-released with catecholamines from the adrenals, naloxone (10 mg/kg i.v.) or nalorphine HCl (which does not cross the blood-brain barrier; 10 mg/kg s.c.) was given 5 min before administration of substance P at T9 in intact rats. In both groups the cardioacceleration was similar to that elicited in adrenalectomized animals, indicating that the adrenal factor was opioid and that its action was peripheral rather than central. When propranolol (10 mg/kg i.v.) was given 3 or 15 min before, substance P increased arterial pressure but heart rate was unchanged, indicating that the opioid factor was not slowing the cardioacceleration by a direct effect on the heart. The results indicate that intrathecal administration of substance P produces a neurally mediated increase in arterial pressure and heart rate and induces the release of an adrenal opioid factor which slows the neurally-mediated cardioacceleration by an action in the periphery. This indicates a functional interaction between humoral and neural sympathetic mechanisms regulating the cardiovascular system.", 
    "27": "Cocaine is a potent sympathomimetic drug that can provoke lethal cardiac events. Cocaine-induced alterations in autonomic balance, particularly during myocardial ischemia, could contribute significantly to these adverse reactions. To test this hypothesis, we produced a 2-min left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) occlusion in unanesthetized mongrel dogs (n = 7) instrumented to measure left ventricular pressure (LVP), ventricular electrogram, and coronary blood flow (CBF) with and without various doses of cocaine (0.0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg). At least 24 h elapsed between cocaine doses, which were given in random order. Time series analysis of heart rate (HR) variability was used as an index of cardiac vagal tone (0.24-1.04 Hz). Cocaine elicited dose-dependent increases in HR that were accompanied by corresponding decreases in cardiac vagal tone. The peak response was achieved approximately 1 min after cocaine was given and returned to precocaine values 15 (0.5 and 1 mg/kg), 30 (2 mg/kg), or 60 (4 mg/kg) min later. Myocardial ischemia elicited significant increases in HR and reductions in cardiac vagal tone that were accentuated by cocaine (1, 2, and 4 mg/kg); e.g., cocaine (2 mg/kg) elicited a greater HR (control 119.3 +/- 5.9, occlusion 149.7 +/- 9.6; cocaine 144 +/- 11.9, occlusion 178.3 +/- 10.4 beats/min) and vagal tone (control 5.6 +/- 0.7, occlusion 2.6 +/- 0.3; cocaine 5.2 +/- 0.7, occlusion 1.3 +/- 0.5 ln s2) response to 2-min coronary occlusion. beta-Adrenoceptor blockade (propranolol HCl 1 mg/kg) attenuated the HR response but elicited greater reduction (lower values were achieved) in vagal tone during coronary artery occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "The acute and short-term responses to bisoprolol and to atenolol on systemic and renal hemodynamics and on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) were compared in a randomized double-blind cross-over study including 14 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After a 4-week placebo period, the patients received either bisoprolol (10 mg once daily, o.d.) or atenolol (100 mg o.d.) for 4 weeks and were switched to the other drug after a new 4-week placebo period. Cardiac output (CO) was measured by Doppler echography, and renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured by constant infusion techniques using [123I]iodohippurate and [51Cr]EDTA, respectively. Bisoprolol and atenolol decreased diurnal and nocturnal blood pressure (BP). Both drugs decreased heart rate (HR) and BP both acutely and after 4 weeks. During short-term treatment, CO was maintained with bisoprolol but reduced by atenolol (by 17%). RBF decreased after the first drug intake (by 9 and 12%, respectively) but returned to its baseline value after 4 weeks, so that calculated renal vascular resistance (RVR) was reduced (by 12 and 15%, respectively). Overall, GFR was not affected by treatment. Bisoprolol and atenolol are effective antihypertensive agents that preserve renal hemodynamics during short-term treatment.", 
    "29": "In order to determine the efficacy of type 1C agents (flecainide, encainide, propafenone) in patients with atrial fibrillation who have failed to maintain sinus rhythm with type 1A agents (quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide), 147 patients, that were admitted into the John Dempsey Hospital with new or recurrent atrial fibrillation between 1987-1991, were studied retrospectively. Out of the total, 29 patients converted spontaneously to sinus rhythm, 14 patients were left in atrial fibrillation, and 104 patients were given a type 1A antiarrhythmic. Sixty-five of these patients remained in sinus rhythm (54% converted on drug alone, 46% required electrical cardioversion) for at least 6 months. Of the remaining 39 patients, 28 were given a type 1C antiarrhythmic; 13 were successfully converted (61% chemical, 39% electrical) to and remained in sinus rhythm for at least 6 months; the remaining 15 either failed to convert or reverted to atrial fibrillation. New onset atrial fibrillation had a significantly lower incidence of congestive heart failure (10%) than recurrent atrial fibrillation (33%; P < 0.01). No differences in digoxin, beta blocker use, or other clinical characteristics were seen either between type 1A or type 1C successes or failures. Similarly, echocardiographic dimensions did not predict success or failure with either class of agent. In conclusion, type 1C antiarrhythmics for suppression of recurrent atrial fibrillation represent a reasonable therapeutic alternative for suppression of atrial fibrillation in patients who have failed type 1A agents. Prognostic factors predicting success or failure remain undetermined.", 
    "30": "A randomized trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of amiodarone versus metoprolol or no antiarrhythmic treatment to suppress asymptomatic ectopic activity and improve survival in patients who have had myocardial infarction with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20 to 45% and > or = 3 ventricular premature complexes per hour (pairs or runs). Patients (n = 368) were randomly assigned to receive amiodarone 200 mg/day (n = 115) 10 to 60 days after the acute episode, and metoprolol 100 to 200 mg/day (n = 130) or no antiarrhythmic therapy (n = 123). After a median follow-up of 2.8 years, mortality in the amiodarone-treated patients (3.5 +/- 2% SEM) did not differ significantly from that of untreated control subjects (7.7 +/- 2.5%, p = 0.19), but was lower than that in the metoprolol group (15.4 +/- 3.5%, p = 0.006). Patients treated with metoprolol had twice the mortality seen in control subjects, even though the differences were not statistically significant. Holter studies performed at 1, 6 and 12 months showed that both amiodarone and metoprolol were equally effective in reducing heart rate, whereas only amiodarone significantly reduced ectopic activity (p < 0.0001). Thus, long-term treatment with amiodarone was clearly safe in patients with an ejection fraction of 20 to 45%, was effective in suppressing arrhythmias, and was associated with a lower mortality than metoprolol; corroboration is required in a larger trial.", 
    "31": "The influence of a newly developed alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, HV723 (alpha-ethyl-3,4,5-trimethoxy-alpha-(3-((2-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)ethyl)-ami no)- propyl) benzeneacetonitrile fumarate), on the positive inotropic effect and acceleration of phosphoinositide hydrolysis induced by phenylephrine via alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the presence of bupranolol (0.3 microM) was studied in the rabbit ventricular muscle: (1) HV723 at low concentrations (1-100 pM) attenuated the maximal inotropic response by 15-20% without altering the pD2 value for and [3H]inositol monophosphate accumulation induced by phenylephrine. The inhibitory action of HV723 (1-100 pM) showed a close resemblance to that of a selective alpha 1A antagonist, (+)-niguldipine. (2) HV723 (> or = 1 nM) shifted the concentration-response curve for phenylephrine to the right and downwards in association with a partial inhibition (42.5%) of [3H]inositol monophosphate accumulation. The IC50 values of HV723 for the inhibition of the inotropic response and phosphoinositide hydrolysis were approximately equal to the Kilow value determined by displacement of [3H]prazosin-specific binding. The mode of the inhibitory action of HV723 (> or = 1 nM) resembled that of another alpha 1A antagonist, WB 4101. These results indicate that HV723 shows a differential antagonistic action on the alpha 1A-mediated responses depending on the concentration: HV723 (1-100 pM) selectively inhibits the (+)-niguldipine-sensitive subclass to lead to a decrease in the maximal inotropic response with no change in phosphoinositide hydrolysis; HV723 (> or = 1 nM) may antagonize the WB 4101-sensitive subtype coupled to acceleration of phosphoinositide hydrolysis.", 
    "32": "Nucleus paragigantocellularis stimulation potentiates the medial perforant path population spike in the dentate gyrus via beta-receptor activation. In this study, the same paragigantocellularis stimulation preceding lateral olfactory tract pulses depressed the lateral perforant path mediated synaptic potential in dentate gyrus. Depression of the lateral olfactory tract input was blocked by a beta-antagonist. These in vivo results confirm in vitro reports that norepinephrine induces potentiation of medial perforant path input and depression of lateral perforant path input to dentate gyrus.", 
    "33": "Several studies have demonstrated that class I antiarrhythmic drugs do not reduce, and may increase, sudden cardiac death mortality and total cardiac mortality. Because of this, alternative drug choices for antiarrhythmic therapy are necessary. Amiodarone has been demonstrated to be an important and effective antiarrhythmic agent, as has sotalol. The purpose of this article is to review the various indications and possible benefits of the empiric use of these 2 antiarrhythmic agents.", 
    "34": "In both the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) and the Electrophysiologic Study Versus Electrocardiographic Monitoring (ESVEM) trial, class I antiarrhythmic drugs did not appear to perform well, although in the latter trial the class III agent sotalol performed better than 6 class I agents. The results have led some to conclude that class III drugs are now preferred for treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. However, there are a number of reasons why such a conclusion may not be fully justified on the basis of these 2 trials. The data do suggest a need for a critical appraisal and reorientation of drug therapy of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "35": "Sodium channel blockers and class III antiarrhythmic compounds, as well as beta blockers, have been used in preventing recurrences of sudden cardiac death. In recent years, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) have been used increasingly, but no data from randomized trials comparing antiarrhythmic drug and ICD therapy have been reported in this setting. In 1987, the Cardiac Arrest Study Hamburg (CASH), a prospective, randomized trial, was initiated to compare metoprolol, amiodarone, propafenone, and ICD implantation in patients surviving sudden cardiac death due to documented ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation. The details of the study design and preliminary results are presented herein. The primary endpoint of the study is total mortality. The data reviewed in March 1992, representing a mean follow-up period of 11 months, indicated no significant differences among patients randomized to metoprolol, amiodarone, and ICDs. However, there was a significantly higher total mortality and cardiac arrest recurrence in patients randomized to propafenone compared with those randomized to the ICD treatment limb. The study continues with the deletion of the propafenone treatment limb.", 
    "36": "A sensitive, stereospecific high-performance liquid chromatographic assay for oxprenolol enantiomers in rat plasma was developed, using a chiral derivatization agent. Racemic oxprenolol and the internal standard (racemic propranolol) are extracted with dichloromethane after alkalinization of the plasma. Quantitation of R(+)- and S(-)-oxprenolol is based on derivatization with the chiral agent S(-)-1-(1-naphthyl)-ethyl isocyanate, followed by chromatographic separation on a C18 reversed-phase column, with fluorometric detection (excitation at 226 nm, emission at 333 nm). The assay is reproducible as judged by a coefficient of variation of less than 17.5% for both enantiomers at all concentrations used. Preliminary experiments in the rat demonstrate that the method is sufficiently sensitive for pharmacokinetic studies in that species.", 
    "37": "Among the drugs recommended to prevent recurrences of atrial fibrillation after external electric shock, antiarrhythmic agents of classes Ia (quinidine, disopyramide), Ic (cibenzoline, flecainide, propafenone) and III (sotalol) seem to have the same effectiveness in maintaining the sinus rhythm in about 50 percent of the cases after 6 months and one year. Amiodarone, seldom used as first-line treatment, appears to be the most effective drug. The percentage of side-effects requiring discontinuation of treatment is the same for all drugs (about 10 percent). All these drugs have potential proarrhythmic effects. In case of recurrence electric shocks can be repeated in some special cases. The therapeutic strategy according to the clinical context (atrial fibrillation of vagal nerve or catecholergic origin, normal or altered left ventricular function) is discussed.", 
    "38": "The 27 amino acid residue polypeptide omega-conotoxin GVIA, from venom of the cone shell Conus geographus, blocks neuronal voltage-activated calcium channels at picomolar concentrations. The three-dimensional structure in aqueous solution of synthetic omega-conotoxin has been determined from two-dimensional 1H n.m.r. data recorded at 600 MHz. Structural constraints consisting of interproton distances inferred from NOEs and dihedral angles from spin-spin coupling constants were used as input for distance geometry calculations with the program DSPACE. The structures were then refined using back-calculation of NOESY spectra. The family of structures obtained in this way is well defined by the n.m.r. data, the best 12 structures having pairwise root-mean-square differences of 0.68 (+/- 0.15) A over the backbone heavy atoms (N, C alpha and C) and 1.15 (+/- 0.17) A over all heavy-atoms. The molecule adopts a compact structure consisting of a small, triple-stranded, anti-parallel beta-sheet and several reverse turns. All three tyrosine residues are located on the molecular surface, which is noteworthy for its abundance of side-chain hydroxyl groups. There is no negatively charged group in conotoxin, but the five positively charged groups are distributed in three small patches on the surface, one of which, made up of the ammonium moieties of the N terminus and Lys2, may contribute to the receptor-binding surface of the molecule. An isomer of conotoxin with the same amino acid sequence, but different disulfide pairings, has also been investigated. Its structure is less well ordered than that of native conotoxin and it shows significant heterogeneity, probably as a result of cis-trans isomerism preceding hydroxyproline residues.", 
    "39": "The substrate stereoselectivity and enantiomer/enantiomer interaction of (S)- and (R)- propranolol for the formation of their metabolites were investigated in rat liver microsomal fractions. The enantiomers of primary metabolites of propranolol, 4-, 5-, 7-hydroxy- and N-desisopropyl-propranolol were separated and assayed by an HPLC method employing a chiral ovomucoid column. Regioselective substrate stereoselectivity (R < S for 4- and 5-hydroxylations; R > S for 7-hydroxylation; R = S for N-desisopropylation) was observed in the formation of propranolol metabolites when the individual enantiomers or a racemic mixture of propranolol were used as substrates. Concentration-dependent metabolic inhibition of propranolol enantiomers by their optical isomers was also observed. In addition, the inhibition of propranolol 4-, 5- and 7-hydroxylations between the enantiomers showed a typical competitive nature. These findings suggested that the propranolol enantiomers competed for the same enzyme, probably a cytochrome P450 isozyme in the CYP2D subfamily.", 
    "40": "The venom of the scorpion Androctonus mauretanicus mauretanicus contains a toxin--P05--which is structurally and functionally similar to scorpion leiurotoxin I (87% sequence identity), a blocker of the apamin-sensitive Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels. P05, a 31-residue polypeptide cross-linked by three disulfide bridges, also possesses binding and physiological properties similar to those of the bee venom toxin apamin (18 residues, two disulfides). However, the amino acid sequences of these two polypeptides are dissimilar, except for a common Arg-Arg-Cys-Gln motif which is located on an alpha-helix. P05-NH2, a synthetic analog of P05, unlike native P05, was found to bind irreversibly to the apamin receptor. The solution structure of P05-NH2 has been solved by conventional two-dimensional NMR techniques followed by distance geometry and energy minimization. The obtained conformation is composed of two and an half turns of alpha-helix (residues 5-14) connected by a tight turn to a two-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet (sequences 17-22 and 25-29). This beta-sheet has a right-handed twist as usual for such secondary structures. The beta-turn connecting the two strands belongs to type II'. This structure is homologous to all scorpion toxin structures known so far as well as to insect defensins. The three arginines known to be involved in the pharmacological activity, i.e., Arg6, Arg7, and Arg13, are all located on the solvent-exposed side of the helix and form a positively charged surface which includes Gln9. The calculated electrostatic potential is highly asymmetric with the greatest positive potential centered on the Arg-rich alpha-helix side.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "Fifty-eight healthy, normolipidemic adult men participated in a prospective, masked, randomized crossover study designed to compare the effects of two topical nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonists, carteolol and timolol, on plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Two eight-week treatment periods were separated by an eight-week drug-free period. Carteolol 1.0% or timolol 0.5% was used, one drop twice daily, in both eyes without nasolacrimal occlusion. Fresh plasma was assayed for levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoproteins A-I and B-100. With indistinguishable effects on intraocular pressure, carteolol and timolol induced different (P = .013) decrements in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Carteolol treatment decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 3.3% (-0.04 mmol/l) and raised the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 4.0% (0.15 unit); timolol treatment decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 8.0% (-0.10 mmol/l) and raised the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 10.0% (0.37 unit). There was no differential drug effect on the other lipid variables measured. Ocular nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist therapy can produce clinically relevant decrements in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in healthy men.", 
    "42": "The effects of a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent with (pindolol) and without (propranolol) intrinsic sympathomimetic activity properties, compared with placebo-controlled conditions, on metabolic and cardiorespiratory function during long-duration (2 hours) physical activity were examined. After initial cardiorespiratory testing, subjects performed 2-hour walks at 25 and 45% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) under each of the following 3 treatments: pindolol, propranolol and placebo. Medication distribution was randomized and double-blinded. A supine resting blood pressure and electrocardiogram were obtained before each exercise trial. Oxygen consumption, heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output and blood pressure were determined after 5 minutes of quiet sitting and every 30 minutes during each 2-hour exercise trial. Cardiac output was not significantly different at rest or during exercise, comparing pindolol and propranolol with placebo conditions. Cardiac output tended to decrease over time earlier during propranolol treatment for the 25% VO2max trials in trained normotensive subjects than for the other treatments. Cardiac output decreased at approximately the same time across treatments during the 45% VO2max trials in trained normotensive and untrained hypertensive groups. Finally, owing to the observation that a reduction in cardiac output was delayed or prevented in trained normotensive subjects when compared with that in untrained hypertensives while exercising at 25% VO2max, developing a subject's cardiovascular fitness level may be important in the maintenance of cardiac output during extended periods of low-to-moderate physical activities while under the influence of beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "43": "Antihypertensive drugs may affect serum lipoprotein levels in mixed populations but data in hyperlipidemic patients are scanty. Atenolol versus celiprolol effects on serum lipoproteins were compared in 159 hyperlipoproteinemic hypertensive patients. This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, positive-controlled multicenter trial with centralized lipoprotein laboratory and diet constancy monitoring. Blood pressure reduction and serum lipoprotein and apoprotein levels were monitored for 3 months. Both drugs reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Atenolol had greater effects than celiprolol on diastolic pressure, but effects on systolic blood pressure were not different. Patients receiving atenolol had lower serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and higher low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios, whereas patients treated with celiprolol showed no contrasting changes. These differences in lipoprotein levels between drug treatment groups were statistically significant at weeks 9 and 12. The difference between drug treatments was also significant if the values of the 9- and 12-week visits were averaged. Patients taking atenolol had statistically significantly higher serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and apoprotein B at 9 weeks. These divergent directional changes were consistent throughout and statistically significantly different between drugs.", 
    "44": "The inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport by isoprenaline, a mixed beta-adrenergic-receptor (AR) agonist, is well documented in rat adipocytes. Since it has been described that rat adipocytes possess not only beta 1- and beta 2- but also beta 3-ARs, the influence of various subtype-selective beta-AR agonists and antagonists on 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) transport was assessed in order to characterize the beta-AR subtype involved in the adrenergic counter-regulation of the insulin effect. The stimulation of 2-DG transport by insulin was counteracted, in a dose-dependent manner, by all the beta-AR agonists tested, and the magnitude of the inhibition followed the rank order: BRL 37344 > isoprenaline = noradrenaline > dobutamine = procaterol. The same rank order of potency was obtained for lipolysis activation. This is not in accordance with the pharmacological definition of a beta 1- or a beta 2-adrenergic effect, but agrees with the pharmacological pattern of a beta 3-adrenergic effect. The inhibitory effect of the beta 3-agonist BRL 37344 on insulin-stimulated 2-DG transport was not reversed by either the selective beta 1-antagonist ICI 89406 or the beta 2-antagonist ICI 118551. In addition, neither of these beta-antagonists was able to block the isoprenaline and noradrenaline effects, supporting major beta 3-adrenoceptor-subtype involvement in the adrenergic inhibition of insulin-stimulated 2-DG transport. Like isoprenaline, BRL 37344 inhibited (60% inhibition) insulin-stimulated glucose transport only when adenosine deaminase was present in the assay. Furthermore, the maximal inhibitory effects of isoprenaline and BRL 37344 were not additive, and were both dependent on albumin concentration in the incubation medium: they increased when the albumin concentration decreased in the medium from 3.5 to 1%. To conclude, the similarities between isoprenaline and BRL 37344 action on insulin-stimulated 2-DG transport, the poor efficacy of the beta 1-/beta 2-agonists and the lack of effect of selective beta 1- and beta 2-antagonists are compelling arguments to support the important role of beta 3-adrenoceptors in the adrenergic inhibition of glucose transport in rat adipocytes.",

    "50": "The effect of a receptor-mediated Ca2+ entry blocker, 1-(beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl)-1H-imidazole hydrochloride (SK&F 96365), on a secretagogue-induced secretory response and Ca2+ dynamics was examined in isolated acini of rat pancreas. SK & F 96365 inhibited the secretory response induced by 100 pM cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) or 3 microM ethanaminium, 2-[(aminocarbonyl)oxy]-N,N,N-trimethyl,-chloride (carbachol) in isolated incubated acini up to 73.2 +/- 6.1% or 70.3 +/- 3.8% with IC50 of 47.7 microM or 42.0 microM, respectively. The inhibitory effect of SK&F 96365 on the time courses of CCK-8-induced amylase release and [Ca2+]c (cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration) elevation was further examined in isolated perifused acini or isolated acini loaded with Fura-2. In the 100 pM CCK-8-stimulated preparation, 30 microM SK&F 96365 partly, and 100 microM SK&F 96365 completely, inhibited the sustained plateau phase, but did not inhibit the initial phase of the Ca2+ and secretory responses. In the 5 pM CCK-8-stimulated preparation; (a) 30 microM SK&F 96365 reduced the frequency of the [Ca2+]c oscillations, but caused little, if any, changes in the secretory response; (b) 100 microM SK&F 96365 transformed the oscillatory [Ca2+]c dynamics to a transient increase followed by a gradual decay and caused a significant inhibition of the sustained secretory response. These results indicate that the sustained responses to secretagogues are dependent on a receptor-mediated Ca2+ entry which can selectively be blocked by SK&F 96365 in rat pancreatic acini.", 
    "51": "alpha-Methyl-para-tyrosine, co-administered with imipramine to rats at a dose that only partially inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase, has been found to prevent completely the decrease of dopamine D1 receptor function. The present report shows that, in the same experimental conditions, alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine significantly antagonized the capacity of imipramine to prevent the development of learned helplessness behavior in rats. This suggests that a catecholaminergic mechanism is crucial in determining the effect of imipramine on the development of learned helplessness behavior. alpha-Methyl-para-tyrosine co-administration also prevented imipramine-induced down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptor function.",

Therefore, in the last several years the effect of antihypertensive medications on the quality of life has been examined all over the world. The terminological and methodical problems at the field of quality of life resulted in difficulties regarding the comparison of the results of different working groups. This review is focused on the results of randomised, double-blind studies. We found that ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and selective beta blockers have the most beneficial effect on the quality of life.", 
    "53": "In the previous report, we had shown that blockade and enhancement of GABAA receptors in the DMH of rats increased or decreased the level of anxiety, respectively, as measured by the elevated plus-maze test. The present study was conducted to assess the effects of enhancing GABAA neurotransmission in the DMH of rats on the physiological concomitants of anxiety such as increases in heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels while the animals were placed on the elevated plus-maze. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were equipped with arterial and venous catheters and stereotaxically implanted with microinjection cannulae in the cardiostimulatory region of the DMH where injection of bicuculline methiodide (BMI) elicited increases in heart rate under anesthesia. After recovery, rats were injected with either saline or the GABAA agonist muscimol and their HR, BP and plasma NE responses were measured when confined in the open or the closed arm of the elevated plus-maze. Injection of muscimol into the DMH reduced the increases seen in HR, BP and plasma NE when the rats were confined to either the closed or the open arms in addition to decreasing 'anxiety' in the plus-maze. Injection of muscimol into the areas of the hypothalamus surrounding the DMH did not significantly affect the changes in HR, BP and plasma NE in the plus-maze. Blocking the changes in HR and BP elicited by microinjecting GABAergic drugs into the DMH of rats, with systemic injections of a combination of atropine and the beta-blocker atenolol, did not block the behavioral effects of the GABAergic drugs in the plus-maze test.", 
    "54": "We have recently identified several naturally occurring variants of the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR). One of these polymorphisms, which is relatively uncommon, is a mutation occurring in the fourth transmembrane spanning domain, with Ile substituted for Thr at amino acid 164 within the proposed ligand binding pocket. This mutation is adjacent to Ser165 which has been predicted to interact with the beta-carbon hydroxyl group of adrenergic ligands. To determine the functional significance of this variant, we constructed by site-directed techniques a mutated beta 2AR (Ile164) with this substitution and expressed it in CHW-1102 cells. In the presence of guanine nucleotide, Ile164 displayed a lower binding affinity for epinephrine as compared with the wild-type beta 2AR (Ki = 1450 +/- 79 versus 368 +/- 39 nM; p < 0.001). A similarly decreased affinity was found with the catecholamines isoproterenol and norepinephrine, but not with dobutamine or dopamine which lack hydroxyl groups on their beta-carbons. In addition, antagonists without aromatic ring polar substituents displayed a decreased affinity for the mutated receptor. In agonist competition experiments conducted in the absence of guanine nucleotide, Ile164 failed to exhibit detectable high affinity binding, suggesting an impairment in the formation of the agonist-receptor-Gs complex. Consistent with this finding, functional coupling to Gs as determined in adenylyl cyclase assays was significantly (approximately 50%) depressed with Ile164 under both basal and agonist-stimulated conditions. beta 2AR sequestration, which is also triggered by agonist binding, was also found to be approximately 65% reduced in the Ile164 polymorphism. This study represents the first characterization of a naturally occurring mutation of a human adrenergic receptor. Our findings generally support the hypothesized role of this region of the receptor for ligand binding and receptor activation, as well as for establishing critical interactions for overall receptor conformation.",

Eating was followed by prominent changes of systolic cardiovascular function: a rise of heart rate (+7, 95% CI: 4 to 9 beats min(-1)), systolic BP (+5, CI: 1 to 8 mmHg), a drop of diastolic BP (-6, CI:-9 to -3 mmHg), shortening of the pre-ejection period PEP (-11, CI: -13 to -9 ms) and electromechanical systole QS2c (-13, CI: -17 to -8 ms), a rise of the estimated cardiac output CO (+1.3, CI: 1.0 to 1.6 1 min(-1)) and a reduction of the calculated total peripheral resistance TPR (-306, CI: -389 to -222 dyn s cm(-5)). 3. Eating was also followed by an increase of the non-renal clearance of sorbitol (as a measure of hepatic blood flow) and this change was larger than proportional to the increase of CO. The plasma renin activity rose after the meal but the venous plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations were not affected. 4. The postprandial effects peaked over the first 1-2 h after the meal but remained well detectable up to 4 h after eating. 5. The administration of 50 mg atenolol before the meal reduced the postprandial effects to the same extent as the atenolol effects in the fasting state. This lack of interaction (or mere arithmetic additivity) indicates that the efferent beta1-adrenergic tone does not play a predominant role in the modulation of postprandial cardiovascular changes.", 
    "56": "The uniquely high concentration of beta 1-adrenoceptor mRNA (beta 1-mRNA) in the pineal gland provides a model for the regulation of GTP-binding protein (G-protein)-linked receptor gene expression within a functioning endocrine gland. By Northern analysis it has been shown that a nocturnal up-regulation of beta 1-mRNA in the rat pineal results in a 2.6-fold increase in mRNA levels at the middark phase (2400 h) compared with those at the midlight phase (1200 h). This increase is blocked by administration of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol before the onset of darkness. In vitro studies of beta 1-mRNA expression in organ-cultured pineals has confirmed beta-adrenoceptor-linked up-regulation of beta 1-mRNA. Treatment of cultured pineals with the second messenger drugs forskolin and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate produced mRNA responses that were again consistent with a primary role of beta-adrenoceptors in the up-regulation of beta 1-mRNA. Nuclear run-on analysis showed that the acute up-regulation of mRNA was mediated largely through a transcriptional mechanism. An additional novel mode of regulation of beta 1-mRNA was also identified; the protein synthesis inhibitors anisomycin and cycloheximide, but not puromycin and emetine, elicited an acute increase in beta 1-mRNA in cultured pineals that was not transcriptionally mediated. The mechanism underlying this mode of regulation is discussed with relation to control of the cellular immediate early gene c-fos. The facility to examine both physiological and in vitro changes in beta 1-mRNA expression in the pineal will provide further insight into the complexity that is apparent for the molecular regulation of G-protein-coupled receptors.", 
    "57": "We investigated the importance of calcium (Ca2+) influx in increasing the steady state concentrations of mRNAs coding for the pituitary peptides PRL, alpha, and TSH, LH, and FSH beta-subunits. Adult female rat pituitaries were dissociated, plated for 48 h, then inserted into perifusion chambers. Secretory responses were measured after 2 and 22 h of perifusion, and after 24 h, the cells were recovered, total RNA was extracted, and mRNAs were assayed by dot blot hybridization. The first experiment examined the effect of the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil (100 microM) on the stimulatory action of pulsatile TRH (4 nM; 60-min interval) or GnRH (100 pM; 60-min interval) on pituitary mRNAs. TRH pulses induced a significant increase (49-56%) in PRL, alpha, and TSH beta mRNAs. Similarly, GnRH pulses stimulated a rise in alpha (64%) and FSH beta (50%) mRNAs, but not LH beta. The effects of pulsatile TRH or GnRH were eliminated when verapamil was added to the medium, suggesting that Ca2+ influx is critical to the stimulatory action of TRH or GnRH. The second experiment examined the effect of pulsatile vs. continuous increases in intracellular Ca2+ on pituitary mRNA expression. Pulsatile Ca2+ signals were produced by giving 60-min pulses of 50 mM KCl, Bay K 8644 (10 microM), or Bay K 8644 (10 microM; in the presence of 10 mM KCl in the injectate) and vehicle pulses to controls. Continuous increases in intracellular Ca2+ were induced by perifusion with medium containing the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (20 microM), and these groups were compared to that receiving continuous verapamil. Pulsatile increases in Ca2+ influx (KCl or Bay K 8644) stimulated significant elevations in all mRNAs studied (36-74% increase vs. controls), with the exception of TSH beta. The magnitude of the mRNA responses to pulsatile Ca2+ (vs. controls) was similar to that observed after TRH and GnRH pulses. In contrast, only LH beta was increased by A23187 (42% increase vs. controls; P < 0.05). PRL and alpha mRNAs were selectively diminished by A23187 (57% and 83% decreases vs. controls, respectively; P < 0.05) and verapamil (67% and 60%; P < 0.05). The data show that expression of these pituitary genes is regulated by Ca2+ and that a pulsatile Ca2+ signal is required to stimulate PRL, alpha, and FSH beta (but not LH beta).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "58": "At night a more effective attenuation of sympathetic activity by acute and chronic propranolol was observed. Single use of the drug in other daytime was accompanied by irregular changes in the neuronal control of heart activities. This irregularity was intensified after repeated treatment of beta-adrenoblocker and led to the stable increase of the sympathetic tone in the morning and day hours.", 
    "59": "Variability of paradoxical jet flow in a case of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with midventricular obstruction was examined. Propranolol decreased both peak diastolic paradoxical jet flow velocity and peak systolic velocity at the narrowing portion. Nitroglycerin decreased peak diastolic paradoxical jet flow velocity with an increase in peak systolic velocity at the narrowing portion. Thus the diastolic paradoxical jet flow is dynamic as well as the abnormal systolic flow; however, changes in these abnormal flow dynamics may not be necessarily in the same direction. Doppler echocardiography should be useful in assessing effects of interventions on the flow dynamics in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with midventricular obstruction.", 
    "60": "The aim was to investigate the responses of the left ventricular (LV) end-systolic pressure-diameter relationship (ESPDR) to acute pressure overload. ESPDRs were made by 2-min ascending and descending aortic constrictions before and after administration of propranolol and atropine sulphate (both 0.2 mg kg-1 i.v.) in eight open-chest dogs with the pericardium preserved. LV anterior-posterior diameter was measured with ultrasonic crystals. In the ascending aortic constriction, end-diastolic pressure (EDP) and end-diastolic diameter (EDD) were unchanged and ESPDR shifted to the left. In the descending aortic constriction, EDP and EDD increased from 6.8 +/- 0.7 to 8.8 +/- 0.9 mmHg (P < 0.01) and from 32.7 +/- 1.4 to 34.5 +/- 1.6 mm (P < 0.05) and ESPDR shifted to the right. After administration of propranolol and atropine sulphate, cases having smaller changes in EDD during 2 min constriction (0.3 +/- 0.3 mm in all cases of ascending, 0.3 +/- 0.2 mm in four cases of descending aorta) showed a leftward shift of ESPDR. The remaining four cases of descending aortic constriction with larger changes in EDD (1.8 +/- 0.8 mm, P < 0.05) showed a rightward shift of ESPDR. An inverse curvilinear correlation was found between percentage changes in EDD and in the slopes. These results suggest that the responses in ESPDR to acute pressure overload were determined by not only changes in the contractile state but also the interplay between adaptation to acute pressure overload (the Anrep effect) and pre-load.", 
    "61": "To test the hypothesis that native high-altitude residents have less beta-sympathetic and more parasympathetic tone than newcomers, we compared the effects of beta-sympathetic and parasympathetic blockade in 10 Tibetan and 9 Han acclimatized male residents of Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region, China (elevation 3,658 m). Each subject was studied during cycle ergometer exercise at 70, 132, and 191 W after placebo (normal saline), beta-sympathetic (propranolol, 0.2 mg/kg iv), or parasympathetic (atropine, 0.04 mg/kg iv) blockade in random order on different days. At rest, the fall in resting heart rate with propranolol and the rise with atropine were equal in Tibetan and Han subjects. During exercise, the fall in heart rate with propranolol relative to placebo values was greater in the Han than in the Tibetan group, whereas the rise in heart rate with atropine was greater in the Tibetans. Propranolol or atropine administration did not change minute ventilation per unit O2 consumption in either group. At the highest level of exercise on the placebo day, the Tibetans achieved a higher work load and level of O2 consumption than the Han subjects. Propranolol or atropine reduced O2 consumption and work load similarly in the two groups at the highest exercise level. The results supported our hypothesis that native Tibetan residents of high altitude exhibit more para-sympathetic and less beta-sympathetic tone during exercise. Neither relatively greater parasympathetic nor less sympathetic activation appeared implicated in the greater exercise capacity of Tibetans compared with that of acclimatized newcomer residents of high altitude.", 
    "62": "Previous studies showing that propranolol upregulates beta-adrenergic receptors and protects against myocardial ischemia led us to hypothesize that preburn propranolol would protect against postburn cardiac dysfunction. Guinea pigs were treated with propranolol 3 mg/kg/day for 14 days, then deeply anesthetized and subjected to a 45% 3 degrees scald burn; eight guinea pigs treated with propranolol served as the control group (group 1). Burned guinea pigs were resuscitated with Ringer's lactate given as either 4 ml (group 2, N = 8), 6 ml (group 3, N = 10), or 8 ml (group 4, N = 6) per kg/% burn. Guinea pigs treated for 14 days with vehicle (water) were subjected to either sham burn (non-propranolol control, group 5, N = 10) or burn and treatment (group 6, N = 10) as described for group 2. Fluid resuscitation in non-propranolol-treated guinea pigs failed to overcome burn-induced cardiac deficits, as indicated by significantly lower left ventricular pressure, 86 +/- 2 versus 62 +/- 3 mm Hg; +dP/dt max, 1365 +/- 43 versus 1110 +/- 44 mm Hg/sec; -dP/dt max, 1184 +/- 31 versus 881 +/- 40 mm Hg/sec, p < 0.001. Burn-mediated cardiac defects occurred in all propranolol-treated guinea pigs regardless of the fluid volume given. Our data show that (1) propranolol did not protect against burn-induced cardiac dysfunction, and (2) chronic beta-adrenergic blockade increases postburn fluid requirements for maintenance of cardiodynamic stability and for survival.",

A spectral frequency domain analysis was used for the estimation of heart rate variability characteristics. Thirty-six patients, mean age 49 +/- 17 years, with a history of recurrent syncope and positive tilt testing were involved in the study. All patients received oral propranolol (five patients also had a dual chamber inhibited DDI pacemaker implanted) for a mean time 12 +/- 6 months. One patient complained of syncope during this follow-up. The tilt test repeated in 29 patients during follow-up was negative in 28. In 20 patients treatment was discontinued for 4 days and a new tilt test was then performed. Eleven of these 20 patients (55%) had a positive test (P < 0.001 compared with the group in which treatment was continued). In the group of 11 patients in whom the tilt test became positive again after medical treatment had been withdrawn (mean age 43 +/- 20 years) and in 11 asymptomatic controls (mean age 52 +/- 19 years), with no history of syncope and negative tilt testing, the heart rate variability was assessed. The increase in the low frequency component from rest to the maximum value of heart rate variability during tilt testing was higher in the vasovagal group than in the controls (2.6 +/- 1.2 vs 1.5 +/- 0.7 P = 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "64": "1. The hyperalgesic activities in rats of bradykinin, carrageenin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were investigated in a model of mechanical hyperalgesia. 2. Bradykinin and carrageenin evoked dose-dependent hyperalgesia with maximum responses of similar magnitude to responses to LPS (1 and 5 micrograms). 3. Hoe 140, an antagonist of BK2 receptors, inhibited in a dose-dependent manner hyperalgesic responses to bradykinin, carrageenin and LPS (1 microgram) but not responses to LPS (5 micrograms), prostaglandin E2, dopamine, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8. 4. Responses to bradykinin and LPS (1 and 5 micrograms) were inhibited by the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin and by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol. The effects of indomethacin and atenolol were additive: their combination abolished responses to bradykinin and LPS (1 microgram) and markedly attenuated the response to LPS (5 micrograms). 5. Antiserum neutralizing endogenous TNF alpha abolished the response to bradykinin whereas antisera neutralizing endogenous IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8 each partially inhibited the response. The combination of antisera neutralizing endogenous IL-1 beta+IL-8 or IL-6+IL-8 abolished the response to bradykinin. 6. Antisera neutralizing endogenous TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8 each partially inhibited responses to LPS (1 and 5 micrograms). Increasing the dose of antiserum to TNF alpha or giving a combination of antisera to IL-1 beta+IL-8 or IL-6+IL-8 further inhibited responses to LPS (1 and 5 micrograms). 7. These data show that bradykinin can initiate the cascade of cytokine release that mediates hyperalgesic responses to carrageenin and endotoxin (1 microgram). The lack of effect of Hoe 140 on hyperalgesic responses to LPS (5 microgram) suggests that the release of hyperalgesic cytokines can be initiated independently of bradykinin BK2 receptors.", 
    "65": "1. The aim of the experiments was to examined the effects of beta-adrenoceptor activation on twitch and tetanic contractions in fast- and slow-twitch mammalian skeletal muscle fibres. Isometric force was recorded from bundles of intact fibres isolated from the normal and denervated slow-twitch soleus and normal fast-twitch sternomastoid muscles of the rat. 2. Terbutaline (10 microM), a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, induced an average 15% potentiation of peak twitch and peak tetanic force in normal soleus fibres and abbreviated twitch and tetanic relaxation. In white- and red-sternomastoid fibres, 10 microM terbutaline potentiated peak twitch force by about 7% and slowed twitch relaxation. 3. The potentiation of twitches and tetani by terbutaline was quantitatively similar in normal and denervated soleus fibres. However, in contrast to the normal soleus, terbutaline slowed twitch relaxation and had no effect on tetanic relaxation in denervated soleus fibres. 4. Adrenaline (10 microM) increased peak tetanic force by about 7% in both normal and denervated soleus fibres. 5. Exposure to (+/-)-propranolol (0.1 microM), a general beta-adrenoceptor blocker, completely abolished the tetanus potentiation by terbutaline. 6. Dibutyryl-cyclic AMP (2 mM) mimicked the effects of 10 microM terbutaline on peak tetanic force and tetanic relaxation in normal and denervated soleus fibres. Dibutyryl-cyclic AMP also potentiated peak twitch force in denervated soleus fibres but only after a brief period of twitch depression: the twitch depression might be due to butyrate. 7. The results suggest that the increase in peak twitch and tetanic force and abbreviation of tetanic relaxation induced by terbutaline depend on the activation of beta-adrenoceptors and a consequent increase in the myoplasmic cyclic AMP concentration.", 
    "66": "1. Experiments have been performed to investigate the cardiovascular actions in the rat of SCA40, a novel potassium channel opener which is a potent relaxant of guinea-pig airway smooth muscle in vivo and in vitro. 2. SCA40 (0.01-30 microM) caused a complete and concentration-dependent relaxation of rat isolated thoracic aorta contracted with 20 mM KCl but failed to inhibit completely the spasmogenic effects of 80 mM KCl. 3. The ATP-sensitive K(+)-channel blocker, glibenclamide (3 microM), failed to antagonize the relaxant action of SCA40 on 20 mM KCl-contracted rat isolated thoracic aorta. 4. SCA40 (0.001-100 microM) had dual effects on rat isolated atria. At low concentrations, SCA40 produced a concentration-dependent decrease in the rate and force of contractions. At higher concentrations (greater than 1 microM) SCA40 induced concentration-dependent increases of atrial rate and force. 5. In vivo, in normotensive Wistar rats, SCA40 elicited a dose-dependent (1-100 micrograms kg-1) decrease in mean arterial pressure which was accompanied by a moderate dose-dependent increase in heart rate. SCA40 (100 micrograms kg-1) had a slightly greater hypotensive effect than cromakalim (100 micrograms kg-1) but the duration of the hypotension was longer with cromakalim than with SCA40. 6. The hypotensive effect of SCA40 was not reduced by propranolol, atropine, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or glibenclamide. 7. It is concluded that the mechanism by with SCA40 relaxes vascular smooth muscle in vitro and in vivo involves activation of K(+)-channels distinct from glibenclamide-sensitive ATP-sensitive K(+)-channels.", 
    "67": "Fluvastatin sodium (Lescol) is the first synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)-reductase inhibitor to be studied extensively in humans. Absorption of fluvastatin is complete and unaffected by the presence of food. Systemic exposure is limited because of extensive sequestration by the liver and/or first-pass metabolism, a plasma half-life of approximately 30 min, no circulating active metabolites, and no accumulation of drug during chronic dosing. Approximately 95% of a single dose of fluvastatin is excreted via the biliary route with less than 2% as the parent compound. Studies investigating the effect of food on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics have demonstrated marked reductions in the rate of bioavailability (Cmax) of 40% to 60%. A comparison of drug administration with the evening meal or at bedtime revealed no significant differences in either the extent of bioavailability (area under the curve; AUC) or pharmacodynamic effect [reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)]. Relative to the general population, plasma fluvastatin concentrations do not vary as a function of either age or gender. Administration of a single 40-mg dose to a patient population with hepatic insufficiency resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in both AUC and Cmax. Drug interaction studies with fluvastatin and cholestyramine (CME) demonstrated a lower rate and extent of fluvastatin bioavailability; no impact on efficacy was demonstrated when CME was given 4 h before fluvastatin dosing in clinical trials. Interaction studies with niacin and propranolol demonstrated no effects on fluvastatin plasma levels, and fluvastatin administered to a patient population chronically receiving digoxin had no effect on the AUC of digoxin compared with controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A total of 29 additional patients received only oral d-sotalol, (400-600 mg.day-1). Acute success of antiarrhythmic therapy was defined as suppression of inducible sustained VT/VF. The overall success rate of IV d-sotalol was 38% (32/84) after a mean of 4.3 drugs failed to suppress inducibility. A 78% success rate (31/40) was demonstrated in patients who were also assessed after oral d-sotalol. Torsade de pointes type VT was seen in one patient. After 1 year, only 16% of patients with a positive EPS had a recurrence compared to 43% of patients with a negative EPS (P < 0.05). Estimated survival rates were 95 and 88% after 1 and 2 years of follow-up, respectively. Only five of 56 patients discontinued d-sotalol therapy because of adverse effects. IV d-sotalol appears to be an effective antiarrhythmic agent. Its long-term efficacy is predictable on the basis of therapy guided by electrophysiologic testing in patients with refractory ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The efficacy of d-sotalol seems comparable to that reported for d,l-sotalol.",

Efficacy predictions were most frequent with sotalol therapy. During long-term follow-up of the 296 patients discharged on a drug predicted to be effective, there were 151 recurrences of an arrhythmic event; there were no differences in actuarial rates of arrhythmia recurrence between EPS and HM. With multivariate testing of 14 variables, only sotalol therapy and absence of prior antiarrhythmic therapy were associated with a significant reduction in risk of arrhythmia recurrence.", 
    "70": "In the chronically-instrumented animal and the isolated blood perfused heart, atrial re-entry via a fixed path around an anatomic obstacle has been described and is terminated by the class III antiarrhythmic agent d-sotalol. The precise mechanism by which d-sotalol terminates this arrhythmia is not known. In the present study, right atrial (RA) activation sequences in the isolated, coronary artery perfused canine heart (n = 5) during episodes of sustained flutter and drug administration were determined. A fixed array of bipolar electrodes was used to record endocardial electrograms from 96 sites on the RA simultaneously. Maps of all control flutters showed that the rhythm was due to persistent circus movement of the impulse around the tricuspid valve ring. d-Sotalol was effective in terminating atrial re-entry in this model. In all episodes, block of the excitatory impulse in a specific region of the re-entrant circuit accompanied these terminations. However, the events preceding the occurrence of block of the impulse were not similar. Two different modes of termination are described. The class III antiarrhythmic agent d-sotalol can terminate atrial re-entry in several ways. In one mode, complete conduction block of the re-entering impulse within the fixed path occurs to terminate the rhythm. In the other mode, interruption of the original re-entrant circuit occurs when there is failure of a lateral boundary. In both modes cycle length (CL) oscillations are observed.",

The goal was to test the hypothesis that alterations in beta-adrenergic binding were more likely to be found in subjects with evidence of depressive disorders. [125I]pindolol binding in frontal cortex was found to be significantly lower in the group committing suicide compared to the matched controls (21.1 +/- 1.1 fmol/mg protein vs. 24.8 +/- 0.8 fmol/mg protein, p < .02).

    "72": "Since many chiral pharmaceutical excipients, such as cellulose polymers and cyclodextrins, are used as stationary phases for the separation of enantiomers by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), it is hypothesized that one enantiomer of a chiral drug will be released faster than the other from a pharmaceutical formulation containing a racemic drug and a chiral excipient. The mechanism of such an event may arise from preferential intermolecular interaction between the chiral excipient and one of the enantiomers. To test this hypothesis, the release of the enantiomers of propranolol hydrochloride into water from formulations containing the chiral excipients, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) or beta-cyclodextrin, was investigated by stereospecific HPLC analysis of the dissolved concentrations of each of the enantiomers from the formulations. The release of the enantiomers of propranolol hydrochloride from the formulations containing HPMC, although variable, was found to be stereoselective. However, the release of propranolol hydrochloride enantiomers from the beta-cyclodextrin complex was found to be non-stereoselective.",

It has been suggested that the plasma concentration associated with QTc prolongation (a measure of the Class III action) is much greater than that associated with beta-blockade. Therefore, sotalol is categorized as a Class III antiarrhythmic agent. The 1-isomer is responsible for the beta-blocking activity, whereas both isomers have Class III properties. After oral dosing in fasting patients with normal renal function, sotalol is > 90 percent absorbed, achieves peak serum concentrations in 2-4 h, is excreted unchanged 80-90 percent in the urine, has a volume of distribution of 1-2 L/kg, and has an elimination half-life of about 12 h. Sotalol is effective in patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias that have been refractory to other conventional antiarrhythmic drugs.

    "79": "Using an in vitro culture system, we investigated the effects of five antiglaucoma drugs on growth and morphologic characteristics of bovine trabecular meshwork cells. Epinephrine hydrochloride (55-550 microM) and pilocarpine hydrochloride (0.8-16 mM), when added to the cultures for 3 days, inhibited trabecular cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. The lowest concentration at which the inhibitory effect was observed was 109 microM and 0.8 mM, respectively, for epinephrine and pilocarpine. Dipivefrin hydrochloride (26-260 microM), timolol maleate (116-1160 microM), and levobunolol hydrochloride (150-1500 microM) were also added to the cells for 3 days. These drugs caused a reduction in cell density, respectively, at concentrations higher than 103, 460, and 616 microM. Cell elongation was seen in cultures treated with epinephrine and dipivefrin, whereas levobunolol and timolol induced the cells to adopt a rounded appearance. Cells that had been exposed to pilocarpine were enlarged with numerous vacuoles. By scanning electron microscopic techniques, epinephrine, timolol, and levobunolol were found to retard the phagocytosis of latex beads by trabecular meshwork cells. Immunostaining with the use of antibodies to vimentin and actin revealed disorganization and condensation of cytoskeletal fibers in trabecular meshwork cells after treatment with epinephrine and dipivefrin. Little change was seen with comparable concentrations of a preservative, benzalkonium chloride, and a vehicle, Liquifilm tears. These results showed that antiglaucoma drugs, depending on their concentrations, may profoundly influence the growth and activity of trabecular meshwork cells.", 
    "80": "A prospective, randomized, observer-marked study was conducted to compare corneal endothelial and intraocular pressure (IOP) changes after cataract surgery with the viscoelastic agents Amvisc Plus and Viscoat. Forty-nine patients (50 eyes) who had uncomplicated phacoemulsification and implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens were randomly assigned to either Amvisc Plus (25 eyes) or Viscoat (25 eyes) groups. Surgical technique was rigidly standardized in all cases. No significant difference in endothelial parameters or postoperative IOPs measured at 24 hours, one week, and two months was detected by analysis of variance between the Amvisc Plus and the Viscoat groups. Visualization was difficult with Viscoat because of its tendency to retain bubbles. Phacoemulsification energy was related to a loss of endothelial density, regardless of the viscoelastic used. The postoperative beta blocker may have contributed to the lower average postoperative IOP than has been reported.",

    "82": "The MRC trial was a random control comparison of placebo treatment with two active drug regimens: atenolol 50 mg daily and a combined tablet containing hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and amiloride 2.5 mg. The trial was based on 226 general practices in the U.K. Its primary purpose was to determine whether hypotensive drug treatment in men and women aged 65-74 with systolic pressure in the range 160-209 mmHg and with diastolic pressure below 115 mmHg reduced stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD) and all-cause mortality. A secondary objective was to determine whether outcome differed with the two forms of active treatment. 4,396 patients were randomized: 50% to placebo; 25% each to the two forms of treatment. During the following 5.8 years 25,000 patient-years of experience accumulated. Blood pressure fell in the placebo group, larger falls occurred with the two active treatments. Active treatment (diuretic and beta-blocker groups combined) reduced stroke by 25% (95% CI 3 to 42%), CHD by 19% (-2% to 36%, p = 0.08), cardiovascular events by 17% (2% to 29%). Benefits were clearest for the diuretic regime: a 31% reduction of stroke events, a 44% reduction of CHD and a 35% reduction of cardiovascular events--all significant.", 
    "83": "Isolated systolic hypertension has a higher prevalence with age and an associated excess cardiovascular risk. The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) was a randomized, prospective, double blind clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of a antihypertensive regimen based on low dose diuretic therapy in reducing the five year combined incidence of fatal and nonfatal stroke. SHEP demonstrated a significant 36% reduction in stroke incidence. Also, 27% reduction in coronary heart disease incidence and a 32% reduction in major cardiovascular disease incidence were achieved. The benefits accrued to all subgroups identified based on baseline age, race, sex, blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, and ECG abnormalities. A low-dose diuretic regimen should be the initial treatment of choice for most hypertensive patients, based on demonstrated reduction in risk for major cardiovascular events, its safety, acceptance by patients, and low cost.", 
    "84": "Ninety-seven women with moderate to severe preeclampsia (PE) were allocated at random to labetalol or hydralazine treatment. Of these, 22 women with severe PE gave birth to neonates with VLBW (very low birth weight < or = 1500 g). Seven were allocated to labetalol treatment (Group A), eight to hydralazine treatment (Group B) and seven women received both drugs due to poor blood pressure control with a single drug therapy (Group C). No difference in cesarean section rate or in the indication for operative delivery could be seen. Gestational age was 29.9 weeks (25.4-32.5) in Group A, 28.6 weeks (26.6-33.4) in Group B and 27.3 weeks (26.7-31.1) in Group C (median and range). Birth weight did not differ between groups and 13 of the 22 infants weighed below 1000 g. There was a tendency to lower Apgar scores at five minutes in the hydralazine group. Time spent in the neonatal intensive care unit did not differ between groups. Five of the 11 neonates with gestational age (GA) < or = 28 weeks and three of the seven neonates in GA 29-30 weeks died. Neither the number of infants requiring intermittent positive pressure ventilation or duration of O2- treatment, nor number of infants with respiratory distress syndrome differed between groups. We did not find any difference in the outcome of the VLBW infants when the hypertensive mother had been treated with either hydralazine or labetalol.", 
    "85": "Hemodynamic and autonomic mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular defense reaction elicited by electrical stimulation of the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray region were evaluated in pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. Stimulation of this area produced transient increases in mean arterial pressure and more sustained increases in heart rate, hindlimb blood flow, and plasma catecholamine levels. The pressor component of the defense reaction was due entirely to increased total peripheral vascular resistance; elevations in cardiac output occurred only at the end of the stimulation period when blood pressure had returned to resting values. The hindlimb vasodilatory response included distinct early and late components. The late component was produced by epinephrine-mediated activation of beta 2-receptors because it was abolished by bilateral adrenalectomy or treatment with butoxamine, a beta 2-receptor selective antagonist. In contrast, the early component was only partially reduced by adrenalectomy or butoxamine treatment. During conditions of constant flow provided by a pump-perfused hindlimb preparation, the early hindlimb vasodilatory response was eliminated and a neurogenic vasoconstrictor response revealed. This finding suggests that the early hindlimb blood flow response may result from shunting of blood from highly vasoconstricted vascular beds to relatively less constricted hindlimb vasculature.", 
    "86": "The role of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) in determining resting arteriolar tone and vasodilator reactivity was assessed in superfused, hamster microcirculatory beds studied via intravital microscopy. Under resting conditions, the selective KATP blocker, glibenclamide, produced concentration-dependent vasoconstriction in both the cheek pouch and the cremaster muscle. Concentration-related constriction of cheek pouch arterioles was also observed with tetrapentylammonium, although this agent appeared to have toxic effects on the microcirculation. Glibenclamide (2 microM) abolished arteriolar vasodilation to cromakalim and pinacidil over a concentration range (10 nM-1 microM) in which these agents are selective KATP agonists and also significantly inhibited adenosine-, carbacyclin-, and isoproterenol-induced vasodilation. In contrast, responses to other vasodilators were not significantly affected [methacholine, forskolin, and dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)] or only slightly depressed (sodium nitroprusside). Thus the activity of KATP determines, in part, resting arteriolar tone in the hamster. Furthermore, vasodilators like adenosine, beta-adrenergic agonists, and prostacyclin appear to act through these ion channels by a mechanism that may not involve cAMP.", 
    "87": "The present study was undertaken to determine the hemodynamic responses associated with stimulation of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 21) were instrumented with guide cannulas directed bilaterally at the PVN, with an electromagnetic flow probe placed on the ascending aorta and with femoral venous and arterial catheters. Bicuculline methiodide (BMI, 2 mM) was infused bilaterally (100 nl/20 min) into the PVN region before and after treatment with the beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, metoprolol bitartrate (2 mg/kg iv) or the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, prazosin hydrochloride (2 mg/kg iv). Infusion of BMI into the PVN increased mean arterial pressure by 17 +/- 2 mmHg, and heart rate rose by 91 +/- 8 beats/min. Cardiac index increased 17 +/- 3%, whereas total peripheral resistance index was not altered significantly. After metoprolol treatment, the mean arterial pressure response to BMI was similar to control (16 +/- 2 mmHg), but the tachycardia was reduced significantly (10 +/- 4 beats/min). In addition, the blood flow response was changed qualitatively. Total peripheral resistance increased 13 +/- 3%, whereas the cardiac index response was abolished (1 +/- 2%). After prazosin treatment, BMI administration into the PVN failed to increase arterial pressure (-1 +/- 4 mmHg). Nevertheless, the BMI infusion was associated with significant hemodynamic effects. Total peripheral resistance index decreased (-24 +/- 6%), whereas cardiac index and stroke volume index increased 34 +/- 8 and 17 +/- 5%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "88": "The changes in pulmonary artery (PA) tone that develop during hypoxia are complex and appear to involve multiple vasoregulatory pathways. This study was designed to identify the phases of the response to severe hypoxia in isolated segments of rat PA and to evaluate the mechanisms involved. Exposure of preconstricted PA segments to severe hypoxia (i.e., PO2 < 3 Torr) resulted in transient relaxation followed by vigorous hypoxic vasoconstriction (HVC), which averaged 0.26 +/- 0.02 g (or 43.9 +/- 3.7% of the maximal force developed in response to phenylephrine). HVC was followed by sustained and nearly complete inhibition of existing tone. The first two phases of the response were endothelium dependent and could be blocked by nonspecific inhibitors of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) activity and by 500 microM N omega-nitro-L-arginine, a specific inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) formation. The transient early relaxation could also be inhibited by superoxide dismutase (50 U/ml). In contrast, the late relaxation phase was neither endothelium dependent nor could it be blocked by inhibitors of EDRF/NO activity. Rat PA segments were relaxed by pinacidil and lemakalim, both of which activate ATP-sensitive potassium channels. Preincubation with glibenclamide, a selective inhibitor of these channels, blocked this response and also reduced late hypoxic vasodilation by nearly 40% (P < 0.001). These findings demonstrate that the response of rat PA to hypoxia involves both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent components. The initial relaxation results from enhanced EDRF/NO activity, which is likely due to diminished breakdown by superoxide radicals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "89": "During acute respiratory alkalosis, myocardial contractility initially increases but then declines toward control levels. To elucidate the mechanism of this response, two parallel strategies were adopted: isovolumic left ventricular developed pressure (DP) and intracellular pH (pHi) were measured in isolated ferret hearts using 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and isometric developed tension (DT) and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) were measured in ferret papillary muscles using microinjected fura 2 salt. When hypocapnia was induced by sudden introduction of perfusate equilibrated with 2% CO2 (from 5% CO2 in control), DP increased to a maximum of 120 +/- 3% (SE; n = 7) of control within 40 s. Afterward, DP decreased toward control levels, reaching a new steady state in 2-3 min. In contrast, pHi increased from control (7.11 +/- 0.01) only after 30 s of hypocapnia and reached a peak of 7.25 +/- 0.02 between 80 and 100 s. Thus pHi lagged behind contractility. In contrast to pHi, [Ca2+]i changed in parallel with DT: when DT reached a maximum (251 +/- 63% of control; n = 5) during hypocapnia, the amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients also peaked (190 +/- 22% of control; n = 5). A simulation of contractile force based on our measurements of pHi and [Ca2+]i, along with published Ca(2+)-tension relations, described adequately the changes in developed force during hypocapnia. These results indicate that the biphasic changes in [Ca2+]i, coupled with an out-of-phase change in pHi, underlie the biphasic response of myocardial contractility to hypocapnia.", 
    "90": "A genetic model of airway hyperreactivity has been described in which strains of mice are hyperresponsive (A/J) or hyporesponsive (C3H/HeJ) to intravenous acetylcholine challenge. To determine the mechanism of this differential responsiveness, we compared beta 2-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptor properties and their coupling to guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) in peripheral lung membrane fractions from these strains. No significant differences were found between the strains with regard to beta 2-adrenergic or muscarinic receptor density or antagonist affinity. No strain difference was found in beta 2-adrenergic receptor affinity for isoproterenol in the presence or absence of the nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide 5'-guanylimidodiphosphate [Gpp(NH)p]. In contrast, affinity of the high-affinity carbachol binding site of muscarinic receptors was threefold greater in A/J lung compared with C3H/HeJ lung (pKH = 7.34 +/- 0.16 vs. 6.79 +/- 0.06, respectively, P < 0.05). In the presence of Gpp(NH)p, this affinity was decreased sevenfold in A/J lung but was not significantly affected in C3H/HeJ lung, suggesting that muscarinic receptors in A/J lung are more effectively coupled to G proteins. Levels of Gs alpha and Gi alpha proteins in peripheral lung were significantly greater in the A/J strain compared with the C3H/HeJ strain (40 and 20% greater, respectively). These studies suggest that airway hyperreactivity in A/J mice is not associated with alterations in beta 2-adrenoceptors, but may be a result of enhanced muscarinic receptor signal transduction due to increased agonist affinity for muscarinic receptors and upregulation of G protein levels.", 
    "91": "In amphibian liver, signal transduction of [Arg8]vasotocin (AVT), a \"classical\" Ca(2+)-dependent hormone in rat liver, is mediated via the generation of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and not via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3]. In isolated hepatocytes from axolotl, hormones that stimulated cAMP formation (the order of efficacy was glucagon > isoprenaline > epinephrine > or = AVT) also provoked a pronounced increase in cytosolic Ca2+, as indicated from changes in fura 2 fluorescence. 8-Bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate at 100 microM was as potent as maximally effective concentrations of glucagon. Ins(1,4,5)P3 mobilized Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum of saponin-permeabilized axolotl hepatocytes with a half-maximal effect at 0.65 microM, as did GTP (20 microM), even in the absence of polyethylene glycol. However, the hormonally induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ was not due to a mobilization of the cation from internal stores by Ins(1,4,5)P3, but to an increased inflow from the extracellular medium. We conclude that in axolotl liver, in contrast to rat liver, hormones stimulate the production of cAMP that, in addition to stimulating processes such as glycogenolysis, also regulates the opening of an ion gate in the plasma membrane, which allows the inflow of Ca2+. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of a second messenger-operated Ca2+ channel in a splanchnic tissue.", 
    "92": "The myocardial response to catecholamines is significantly diminished in many types of shock or heart failure. The guinea pig heart is an ideal model for the study of shock, as it is relatively inexpensive, and the cardiovascular system of the guinea pig most closely resembles that of the human. Using this model, we have developed techniques to characterize and quantitate changes in beta-adrenergic receptors (beta AR) in the guinea pig heart after burn injury. Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the optimum binding conditions, e.g., incubation time and conditions, protein concentrations, rinsing, etc. Additional experiments were conducted using agonists and antagonists to characterize the rank order of potency and stereospecificity of the beta AR. Crude membrane preparations (50 micrograms/250 microliters) from sham-burned and burned hearts were incubated with 8-10 concentrations of 125I-cyanopindolol (10-450 pM) at 37 degrees C for 1 hr. Under these conditions, binding assays were linear with respect to protein concentration and time. Alprenolol (10 microM) was used to determine nonspecific binding. The membrane preparations used in this study bound both agonists and antagonists with a rank order of potency and stereospecificity characteristic of a beta-adrenergic receptor. Finally, agonist competition curves were performed with isoproterenol in the presence and absence of Gpp(NH)p to determine receptor regulation by the Gs protein. Analysis using computer-assisted techniques suggests that the fraction of high-affinity beta-receptors is significantly reduced after burn injury (41.2 +/- 4.7%) compared to sham-burned controls (54 +/- 2%, P < or = 0.023).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In the first study, hemodynamic variables were evaluated both during sinus rhythm and after the induction of atrial fibrillation. Sotalol (160 or 240 mg/day) was administered for 6 to 7 days and the study was then repeated with the same methods.", 
    "97": "The drug significantly diminished heart rate during both sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation. During sinus rhythm, sotalol did not change systemic pressures and significantly increased left and right ventricular end-diastolic, left and right atrial and pulmonary pressures. Cardiac index decreased, whereas stroke volume was unchanged after the drug. Ejection fraction and left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes evaluated by echocardiography were unchanged after sotalol. During atrial fibrillation, the drug had less evident effects on cardiac function. Left ventricular end-diastolic, left atrial and pulmonary pressures did not increase significantly.", 
    "98": "The hemodynamic changes induced by oral sotalol appear to be mainly related to an involvement of ventricular distensibility; this effect is less evident during atrial fibrillation than during sinus rhythm. In patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation without heart failure treated with oral sotalol, a recurrence of the tachyarrhythmia is hemodynamically well tolerated.", 
    "99": "A murine model of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection was used to examine the roles of catecholamines and corticosterone in the restraint stress-induced suppression of viral immunity. Treatment of C57BL/6 mice with RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, reversed the stress-induced diminution of cellularity in response to local HSV infection. Treatment of mice with both nadolol, a peripherally acting beta-adrenergic antagonist, and RU486 completely reversed the restraint stress-induced suppression of HSV-specific CTL activation. These findings demonstrate that both corticosterone and catecholamine-mediated mechanisms are operative in the stress-induced suppression of anti-viral cellular immunity.", 
    "100": "This study investigated the correlation between changes in hepatic hemodynamics and esophageal variceal pressure--measured with a noninvasive, pressure-sensitive endoscopic gauge--in 37 portal-hypertensive cirrhotic patients receiving propranolol (0.15 mg/kg, intravenously; n = 21) or placebo (n = 16) under strict double-blind conditions. Placebo administration had no effect on hepatic venous pressure gradient, azygos blood flow or variceal pressure. Propranolol caused a significant reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient (from 19.6 +/- 1 to 17.3 +/- 1 mm Hg, p < 0.001), azygos blood flow (from 0.61 +/- 0.06 to 0.39 +/- 0.03 L/min, p < 0.001) and variceal pressure (from 13.1 +/- 0.9 to 10.2 +/- 0.9 mm Hg, p < 0.001). In eight patients (propranolol nonresponders) hepatic venous pressure gradient was not modified or decreased by less than 10% after propranolol (mean change, -4.1 +/- 1.6%). However, we found no significant differences between propranolol responders and nonresponders with regard to the decrease in variceal pressure (3.3 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.3 +/- 1.4 mm Hg) and azygos blood flow (0.23 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.21 +/- 0.07 L/min). As expected, in most propranolol responders (11 of 13), reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient was accompanied by a similar response in variceal pressure (> 10% decrease). However, among propranolol nonresponders, in terms of reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient, four out of eight patients had decreases greater than 10% in variceal pressure. The results of this study confirm that reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient by propranolol is associated with a significant decrease in variceal pressure and azygos blood flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Glucagon, adrenaline, and dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP), individually or in combination, activated glycogenolysis in the isolated hepatocytes. The alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine did not increase glycogen breakdown. The action of adrenaline was abolished upon treatment of hepatocytes with a combination of the hormone and propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker. The effects of glucagon, adrenaline, and dibutyryl cAMP on glycogenolysis were not additive. Either hormone induced an increase in the concentration of cAMP. The activities of dephosphophosphorylase kinase and phosphorylase a were stimulated by each hormone or Bt2cAMP. It appears likely that glucagon and adrenaline serve as physiological regulators of hepatic glycogen breakdown during embryogenesis in chickens.",

The effects of this spray or placebo were assessed in 16 patients with effort-induced angina in a blinded, randomized, cross-over design study that compared placebo with intranasal propranolol spray (5 mg/puff) 15 minutes before exercise on a treadmill (Bruce protocol). One week later, each patient, acting as his/her own control, received the alternative treatment and repeated exercise. Mean plasma propranolol level with active therapy was 20 ng/ml. Patients with active spray demonstrated a significant increase in total exercise time than patients taking placebo (530 +/- 197 vs 460 +/- 177 seconds, p = 0.05), an increase in the time to 1 mm ST-segment depression on the electrocardiogram (384 +/- 202 vs 327 +/- 144 seconds, p < 0.05), and an increase in time to onset of angina (452 +/- 149 vs 363 +/- 175 seconds, p = 0.0005). There was a blunting of maximal exercise heart rate with active therapy compared with placebo (120 +/- 13 vs 133 +/- 17 beats/min, p < 0.01), blunting of maximal exercise systolic blood pressure (185 +/- 22 vs 194 +/- 21 mm Hg, p < 0.05), and blunting of peak double product (p < 0.0005), with more modest effects on resting heart rate. Propranolol spray is an effective approach for providing immediate beta blockade and improving exercise tolerance in patients with angina pectoris.", 
    "108": "Mitral annular calcium (MAC) is a condition that often occurs in patients with systemic hypertension. To evaluate the effectiveness of nifedipine in preventing MAC, 223 patients with systemic hypertension of recent onset and without MAC were selected and randomly enrolled in 3 groups: group 1 (76 patients) received nifedipine; group 2 (72 patients) received enalapril; and group 3 (75 patients) received atenolol. After 5 years, these treatments significantly reduced systolic (p < 0.001) and diastolic (p < 0.05) blood pressure (BP) in 3 treated groups. M-mode echocardiography revealed MAC only in 2 patients in the nifedipine group (2.6%), in 13 in the enalapril group (18%) and in 15 in the atenolol group (20%). The degree of MAC was mild (< 5 mm) in the 2 patients in group 1, in 5 of the 13 in group 2, and in 6 of the 15 in the group 3, whereas it was severe (> 5 mm) in the remaining 8 in the enalapril group and in the other 9 in the atenolol group. There was also a significant correlation in the degree of MAC, left atrial enlargement and mitral regurgitation. In addition, atrial fibrillation and atrioventricular conduction defects were associated with severe MAC. These results indicate that nifedipine is an effective drug both in the long-term management of systemic hypertension and in preventing or delaying MAC.", 
    "109": "The effect of norepinephrine (NE) upon human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) production by 6-8 week gestation placental explants has been investigated. NE (5 micrograms/ml) enhanced hCG secretion significantly from the second day of treatment. The stimulatory effect of NE on hCG secretion could be abolished by the alpha 1-receptor specific antagonist prazosin (10(-4) M) and partly diminished by the beta 1-receptor specific antagonist atenolol (10(-4) M), but was not influenced by the alpha 2-receptor specific antagonist yohimbine (10(-4) M). The involvement of the alpha-receptor in the regulation of hCG secretion was further confirmed by addition of the alpha-receptor agonist clonidine (10(-6) M) which had a similar stimulatory effect on hCG release but the effect was antagonized by both prazosin and yohimbine. Further study showed that NE induced a significant increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production by trophoblast tissue. Cyclic AMP secretion in the NE-treated group was fivefold higher than that of the control group. Both the protein kinase C (PKC) specific activator 1-deoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) and the PKC non-specific activator phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) had a stimulatory effect on hCG secretion, while the PKC inhibitor, 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-piperazine (H7) diminished the hCG secretion stimulated by NE. The effect of NE was blocked by the voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker nifedipine but not by the voltage-independent calcium channel blocker gadolinium chloride (GdCl3). On the other hand, anti-gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) IgG and the GnRH antagonist (D-Phe2, D-Trp6)-GnRH did not influence the stimulatory effect of NE on hCG release. The results indicate that NE regulates hCG production in human first trimester trophoblast tissue. The effect of NE was mainly mediated by alpha 1 and partly by beta 1 receptors. Cyclic AMP, the PKC signal transduction pathway and the voltage-dependent calcium channels were involved in NE action."
