It has been shown that the nebivolol-induced vasorelaxation is nitric oxide (NO) dependent. The serine/ threonine protein kinase Akt phosphorylates endothelial cell NO synthase (eNOS) and enhances the ability of eNOS to generate NO. Previous studies have shown that the release of NO from the endothelium may be ascribed to the modulation of different types of K(+) channels. The current study was designed to determine whether K(+) channels or phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt may affect vasorelaxation induced by nebivolol in different rat arteries.",

During contraction by KCl (60 mmol/L) or phenylephrine (PE; 10(-6) mol/L; femoral artery and renal artery were precontracted by 10(-5) mol/L), the effect of nebivolol (10(-7)-10(- 5) mol/L) was obtained in the presence of different potassium channel, PI3K/Akt, or NOS inhibitors.",

The effect of nebivolol was concentration dependent. The exposure of the vessel rings to a selective inhibitor of PI3K wortmannin (5 x 10(-7) mol/L) or a selective inhibitor of Akt (1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate, 10(-5) mol/L) did not influence nebivolol-induced vasorelaxation. Similarly, K(+) channels blockers, iberiotoxin (100 nmol/L), glibenclamide (0.1 mmol/L), 4-aminopyridine (1 mmol/L), or BaCl(2) (1 mmol/L) had no influence on the relaxation of nebivolol in arteries precontracted by PE.",

    "4": "In patients with hypertension, beta blockade decreases muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA; micrographic technique) expressed in burst frequency (burst/min) but does not affect MSNA expressed in burst incidence (burst/100 heart beats), because reductions in blood pressure (BP) upon each diastole continue to deactivate the arterial baroreceptors, but at a slower heart rate (HR). We studied the effects of oral beta blockade on MSNA and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) in normal participants. Bisoprolol (5 mg, 1 week) was administered in 10 healthy young adults, using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study design. The beat-to-beat mean RR interval (RR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) series were analyzed by power spectral analysis and power computation over the very low frequency (VLF), low frequency, and high frequency (HF) bands. Baroreflex sensitivity was computed from SBP and RR cross-analysis, using time and frequency domain methods. Bisoprolol increased RR (P < .0005), decreased mean SBP and diastolic blood pressure values (P < .01), did not change the SBP and RR powers, except for RR power in VLF (P < .02) and SBP power in HF (P < .03). The MSNA variability (P > .13) and respiratory pattern (P = .84) did not change from placebo to bisoprolol condition. The bisoprolol-induced bradycardia was associated with higher burst/100 heart beats (P < .05) and bisoprolol did not affect burst/min (P = .80). Time domain BRS estimates were increased after bisoprolol (P < .05), while frequency domain ones did not change (P > .1). Oral bisoprolol induces differential effects on sympathetic burst frequency and incidence in normal participants. Peripheral sympathetic outflow over time is preserved as a result of an increased burst incidence, in the presence of a slower HR. Unchanged BP and HR and MSNA variability suggests that the larger burst incidence is not due to sympathetic activation.", 
    "5": "Lung cancer has a strong etiologic association with cigarette smoking. Nicotine, a major component in tobacco smoke, functions as a survival agonist that inhibits apoptosis following various stresses. However, the mechanism of action remains elusive. Mcl-1, a major antiapoptotic protein of the Bcl2 family, is extensively expressed in both small cell and non-small cell lung cancer cells, suggesting that Mcl-1 may be a therapeutic target of patients with lung cancer. Here, we found that nicotine induces Mcl-1 phosphorylation through activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in association with increased chemoresistance of human lung cancer cells. Since nicotine stimulates Mcl-1 phosphorylation and survival in cells expressing wild-type but has no such effects in cells expressing T163A Mcl-1 mutant, this indicates that nicotine induces Mcl-1 phosphorylation exclusively at the T163 site and that phosphorylation of Mcl-1 at T163 is required for nicotine-induced survival. Mechanistically, nicotine-induced Mcl-1 phosphorylation significantly enhances the half-life of Mcl-1, which renders Mcl-1 a long-term survival activity. Specific depletion of Mcl-1 by RNA interference blocks nicotine-stimulated survival and enhances apoptotic cell death. Thus, nicotine-enhanced survival of lung cancer cells may occur through activation of Mcl-1 by phosphorylation at T163 site, which may contribute to development of human lung cancer and/or chemoresistance.", 
    "6": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the best prophylaxis for AF prior to CABG. In this double-blind randomized study, 240 consecutive patients underwent elective CABG. They were then divided randomly into three groups to receive propranolol (n = 80), amiodarone (n = 80), or both drugs (n = 80). All groups received their medications from preoperative day 7 to post-CABG day 5. The patients were well matched for age, sex, risk factors, comorbidities, ejection fraction, and cardioplegic technique. Post-CABG AF developed in 22 patients (9.2%) of whom 13 (16.3%) had received propranolol, 5 (6.3%) had received amiodarone, and 4 (5%) had received both drugs. The difference between the propranolol group and the other two groups was statistically significant (P= 0.02), but that between the amiodarone and amiodarone + propranolol group was not significant. Age was a significant predictor of post-CABG AF (P= 0.034). Other factors such as diabetes, sex, hyperlipidemia, smoking, hypertension, family history, cerebrovascular accidents, left atrial size, and ejection fraction were not significant predictors of post-CABG AF. Preoperative amiodarone or amiodarone with propranolol were more effective than propranolol in reducing the frequency of AF. There was a strong relationship between age and the development of AF.

TSH-producing adenoma (TSHoma) of the pituitary gland - the main differential diagnosis - was excluded by cranial MRI and laboratory tests. Familial thyroid hormone resistance (Refetoff syndrome) was suspected and could be confirmed by detection of a pathogenic mutation within the beta-thyroidhormone receptor gene.

Patients were grouped into strata by mean HR, and the relationship between the primary end point and mean HR was analyzed with Mantel-Haenszel ordinal chi(2) tests. Higher intrinsic (unpaced) HR was associated with greater risk of achieving the primary end point of death or heart failure hospitalization (P<0.001). Of patients with a mean HR <75 bpm, 5.8% died or were hospitalized for heart failure, whereas 20.9% with a mean HR >90 bpm achieved the same end point, a 3.6-fold difference (P<0.0001). In a multivariate model with the use of Cox regression, HR was a significant predictor with a hazard ratio of 1.34 (P=0.0001; 95% confidence interval, 1.19 to 1.50), as were age, New York Heart Association functional class, and percent right ventricular pacing, but it was independent of gender and beta-blocker dosing.

    "16": "The International Verapamil SR-Trandolapril Study (INVEST), a randomized trial of 22,576 predominantly elderly patients with an average 2.7-year follow-up, compared a calcium antagonist-led strategy (verapamil SR plus trandolapril) with a beta-blocker-led strategy (atenolol plus hydrochlorothiazide) for hypertension treatment and prevention of cardiovascular outcomes in coronary artery disease patients. Patients received individualized dose and drug titration following a flexible, multi-drug, guideline-based treatment algorithm, with the objective of achieving optimal blood pressure (BP) control individualized for comorbidities (e.g., diabetes). The primary outcome (PO) was first occurrence of death (all-cause), nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke. The strategies resulted in significant and very similar BP reduction, with approximately 70% of patients in both strategies achieving BP control (<140/90 mmHg). Increasing number of office visits with BP in control was associated with reduced risk of the PO. Overall, there was no difference in the PO comparing the strategies; however, new-onset diabetes occurred more frequently in those assigned the atenolol strategy. This report summarizes findings from INVEST and puts them in perspective with our current state of knowledge derived from other large hypertension treatment trials. INVEST findings support that BP reduction is important for prevention of adverse cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and selection of antihypertensive agents should be based on patient comorbidities and other risk factors (e.g., risk for diabetes) and not necessarily that any one drug be given to all.",

    "33": "The long history of the beta-adrenergic receptor blockers for the treatment of hypertension is fraught with many controversies. The first compound had severe untoward effects preventing their use until propranolol was introduced. It was found effective for treatment of angina pectoris since not all patients with hypertension responded to monotherapy with a meaningful reduction of pressure. Nevertheless, the beta-blockers were most effective in: younger patients, especially with hyperkinetic circulation; with co-morbid diseases (e.g. coronary arterial disease with or without prior myocardial infarction); or when used with a diuretic. Subsequently with the advent of meta-analysis to evaluate more generalized experience, controversy resumed with statements made to exclude beta-blockers for initial hypertensive therapy. Support for this argument was gained with reports of patients developing 'dysglycemia' with treatment. However, exclusion of any one therapeutic class for a multifactorial disease such as hypertension seems unrealistic. Meta-analysis confounded this conclusion since inadequate numbers of patients having specific clinical and biological characteristics were included (especially young patients). This is particularly important at this time when third-party reimbursement procedures are particularly relevant and when the primary care physician must deal with the individual patient. The NICE report has introduced specific thinking along these lines. In-and-of itself, its recommendations are reasonable, but current articles continue to suggest that the 'older' beta-blockers should be excluded from national guidelines for initial antihypertensive therapy. Personally, I disagree; and, no doubt, controversy will continue.",

Out of desperation and frustration, health care providers extrapolated from asthma to COPD, and standard asthma therapy was adopted without evidence for efficacy. In recent years, we have gained a better understanding of the pathophysiologic differences between asthma and COPD, and prospective controlled trials have provided a rationale for therapy. Smoking cessation is critically important, both as primary prevention and as an effective way to slow the decrease in lung function in patients with established disease. beta(2)-Adrenergic and anticholinergic agonists improve lung function and relieve symptoms in most patients. Tiotropium improves exercise tolerance and quality of life and reduces exacerbations and hospitalizations. The increase in lung function seen with tiotropium is sustained with continued use over at least 3 to 4 years. Inhaled corticosteroids decrease exacerbations and improve quality of life, and their effect seems greatest in patients with lower lung function and in exacerbation-prone patients. There is no evidence that inhaled corticosteroids alone affect mortality, despite the reduction in exacerbations and increased risk of pneumonia. In some patient populations, inhaled fluticasone, salmeterol, or the combination might slow the rate of loss of lung function. Rather than reflexively using effective asthma therapy in the patient with COPD, current and future therapy for COPD is increasingly evidence based and targeted to specific inflammatory pathways that are important in patients with COPD.",

    "53": "We found that RalA is the predominant isoform expressed in pancreatic islets and insulin-secreting cell lines. Silencing of this GTPase in INS-1E cells by RNA interference led to a decrease in secretagogue-induced insulin release. Real-time measurements by fluorescence resonance energy transfer revealed that RalA activation in response to secretagogues occurs within 3-5 min and reaches a plateau after 10-15 min. The activation of the GTPase is triggered by increases in intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP and is prevented by the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel blocker Nifedipine and by the protein kinase A inhibitor H89. Defective insulin release in cells lacking RalA is associated with a decrease in the secretory granules docked at the plasma membrane detected by Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence microscopy and with a strong impairment in Phospholipase D1 activation in response to secretagogues. RalA was found to be activated by RalGDS and to be severely hampered upon silencing of this GDP/GTP exchange factor. Accordingly, INS-1E cells lacking RalGDS displayed a reduction in hormone secretion induced by secretagogues and in the number of insulin-containing granules docked at the plasma membrane.", 
    "54": "Taken together, our data indicate that RalA activation elicited by the exchange factor RalGDS in response to a rise in intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP controls hormone release from pancreatic beta-cell by coordinating the execution of different events in the secretory pathway.", 
    "55": "Although randomized controlled trials show that long-term beta-blocker use post acute myocardial infarction (AMI) reduces mortality and subsequent cardiovascular events, and that increased compliance lowers mortality, there is limited published research on the effects of long-term beta-blocker compliance in observational community settings. The authors retrospectively study the effect of beta -blocker compliance on mortality and repeat reinfarction using claims records from a major health insurer of all patients who were discharged alive after AMI between January 2003 and June 2004, covered by that health insurer's prescription drug coverage, and prescribed beta-blockers (n = 3923). Using Cox proportional hazards regressions, they estimate both survival and AMI-free survival rates by compliance quartile. Both survival and AMI-free survival rates diverge rapidly and are robust to adjustments for demographics, DxCG risk score, and other baseline risk factors. Results suggest that patients whose post-AMI compliance with beta-blocker therapy is above average experience lower mortality and reinfarction. This is especially true for high-risk patients.", 
    "56": "The G-protein-linked receptor, proteinase-activated receptor-4 (PAR(4)) is activated by proteinases released into the joint during inflammation. It is unclear whether PAR(4) has a pro- or anti-nociceptive effect and whether it directly affects nerve activity. In this study, we examined the expression of PAR(4) in joints and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and whether activation of PAR(4) has an effect on nociception in normal rat knee joints. Electrophysiological recordings were made from joint primary afferents in male Wistar rats during both nonnoxious and noxious rotations of the knee. Afferent firing rate was recorded for 15 min post close intra-arterial injection of 10(-9)-10(-5) mol of the PAR(4) activating peptide, AYPGKF-NH(2), or the inactive peptide, YAPGKF-NH(2) (100 mul bolus). Rats were either naive or pretreated with the selective PAR(4) antagonist, pepducin P4pal-10, the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) antagonist, SB366791, or the bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist, HOE140. Immunofluorescence experiments showed extensive PAR(4) expression in the knee joint and in sensory neurons projecting from the joint. AYPGKF-NH(2) significantly increased joint afferent firing during nonnoxious and noxious rotation of the knee. The inactive control peptide, YAPGKF-NH(2) was without effect. Systemic pretreatment with the PAR(4) antagonist, pepducin P4pal-10, inhibited the AYPGKF-NH(2)-induced increase in firing rate. Pretreatment with HOE140, but not SB366791, also blocked this increase in firing rate. These data reveal that in normal rat knee joints, PAR(4) activation increases joint primary afferent activity in response to mechanical stimuli. This PAR(4)-induced sensitization is TRPV1-independent but involves B(2) receptor activation, suggesting a role for kinins in this process.",

These dendrimers react with the neutral form of carteolol (an ocular anti-hypertensive drug used to treat glaucoma) to afford ion pair (saline) species. The solubility in water of these charged dendrimers depends on the generation considered: generation 0 (3 carteolol) is well soluble, whereas generation 1 (6 carteolol) and generation 2 (12 carteolol) are poorly soluble. These dendrimers have been tested in vivo, as vehicle for ocular drug delivery of carteolol to rabbits.", 
    "58": "This study focused on the occurrence and fate of four beta-blockers (atenolol, sotalol, metoprolol, propranolol) in wastewater and surface water. Measured concentrations were compared with predicted concentrations using an implementation of the geo-referenced model GREAT-ER for the Glatt Valley Watershed (Switzerland). Particularly, the question was addressed how measured and simulated data could complement each other for the exposure assessment of human pharmaceuticals and other micropollutants entering surface water through wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Concentrations in the Glatt River ranged from <LOQ to 83 ng L(-1) with the highest concentrations found for atenolol. Higher loads were measured on days with combined sewer overflow events during high flow conditions. GREAT-ER was able to predict spatially resolved river concentrations based on average consumption and excretion data, removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and dissipation and degradation processes in surface water within a factor of 2. These results indicate that modelling might be sufficient to estimate daily average exposure concentrations for compounds that are either recalcitrant or whose degradation and sorption behaviour can be predicted with confidence based on laboratory experiments. Chemical measurements, in contrast, should be reserved for assessing point sources, investigating mechanisms which lead to short-term temporal fluctuations in compound loads, and determining in-situ degradation rates in conjunction with modelling.",

Postoperative AF occurred in 588 (30%) patients and led to longer length of stay in the intensive care unit versus those without AF (5.1+7.6 days versus 2.5+2.3 days, p < 0.0001). Patients with a past history of AF had a 5 times higher risk of postoperative AF (odds ratio 5.1; 95% confidence interval 3.4 to 7.7; p < 0.0001). AF occurred in 31% of patients taking statins versus 29% of the others (p = 0.49). In multivariable analysis, statins were not associated with AF (odds ratio (OR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7 to 1.2; p = 0.59).

    "64": "Nicotinic cholinergic receptors mediate autonomic transmission at ganglia. However, whether different subtypes of nicotinic cholinergic receptors expressed in autonomic ganglia elicit distinct roles in mediating sympathetic and parasympathetic regulations remain to be defined. In this study, we observed that different subtypes of nicotinic receptors were responsible for the sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular responses. In urethane anesthetized mice, intravenous injection with cytisine, a non-selective nicotinic agonist, induced a brief but pronounced decrease in heart rate, followed by increases in heart rate and arterial blood pressure. The bradycardic response was blocked by atropine, and the pressor response was blocked by prazosin, confirming that these responses were parasympathetic and sympathetic activities, respectively. Hexamethonium, a ganglionic blocker, blocked both sympathetic and parasympathetic responses. Pretreatment with methyllycaconitine citrate, a selective alpha7 nicotinic receptor antagonist, significantly attenuated cytisine-induced sympathetic response with little effect on the parasympathetic response. In contrast, pretreatment with dihydro-beta-erythroidine hydrobromide, a selective alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor antagonist, blocked cytisine-induced parasympathetic response but not the sympathetic response. Pretreatment with dihydro-beta-erythroidine hydrobromide also blocked baroreflex associated parasympathetic bradycardic response. Moreover, treatment with nicotine induced a bradycardic response without a significant pressor response, which was also attenuated by dihydro-beta-erythroidine hydrobromide. Collectively, these data suggest that different nicotinic receptors play distinct roles in sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia. Specifically, activations of alpha7 and alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptors are involved in cytisine-induced cardiovascular sympathetic and parasympathetic responses, respectively.",

Genotype was determined at 5 positions of ADRB2 previously reported as polymorphic. Potential influences of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the promoter region (-367, -47) and coding block (46, 79, 491) of ADRB2 on beta(2)-adrenoceptor expression were investigated.",

There was no influence of genotype on beta(2)-adrenoceptor expression for any of the polymorphisms studied except at position 491. The polymorphism at position 491C>T, leading to a change from thr to ile at amino acid 164, is uncommon.

    "69": "Phencyclidine is an N-methyl d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blocker that has been reported to induce neuronal apoptosis during development and schizophrenia-like behaviors in rats later in life. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been shown to prevent neuronal death caused by NMDAR blockade, but the precise mechanism is unknown. This study examined the role of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways in BDNF protection of PCP-induced apoptosis in corticostriatal organotypic cultures. It was observed that BDNF inhibited PCP-induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent fashion. BDNF effectively prevented PCP-induced inhibition of the ERK and PI-3K/Akt pathways and suppressed GSK-3beta activation. Blockade of either PI-3K/Akt or ERK activation abolished BDNF protection. Western blot analysis revealed that the PI-3K inhibitor LY294002 prevented the stimulating effect of BDNF on the PI-3K/Akt pathway, but had no effect on the ERK pathway. Similarly, the ERK inhibitor PD98059 prevented the stimulating effect of BDNF on the ERK pathway, but not the PI-3K/Akt pathway. Co-application of LY294002 and PD98059 had no additional effect on BDNF-evoked activation of Akt or ERK. However, concurrent exposure to PD98059 and LY294002 caused much greater inhibition of BDNF-evoked phosphorylation of GSK-3beta at serine 9 than did LY294002 alone. Finally, either BDNF or GSK-3beta inhibition prevented PCP-induced suppression of cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. These data demonstrate that the protective effect of BDNF against PCP-induced apoptosis is mediated by parallel activation of the PI-3K/Akt and ERK pathways, most likely involves inhibition of GSK-3beta and activation of CREB.",

Fourteen normotensive healthy persons served as controls. Six M-mode echocardiographic measurements (transducer was turned off and on again each time) were performed.", 
    "72": "The probability of misclassifying a person with LVH (> 130 g/m(2)) as having normal LVM or vice versa was calculated as a function of the number of measurements. The probability was high for single measurements, but was substantially reduced by performing six repeated measurements. Thus, the risk of misclassification was reduced from 20% to 6% in persons with LVM of 120 g/m(2) or 140 g/m(2) and from 13% to 1% in persons with LVM of 115 or 145 g/m(2). However, for persons whose LVM were close to 130 g/m(2), the probability for misclassifications remained high 20% despite repeated measurements.",

    "74": "Many guidelines recommended strict blood pressure (BP) control to prevent cardiovascular events. However, BP control in a substantial majority of hypertensives remains to be insufficient. We have determined the trends of BP control of the same patients during 15 years in a hypertension clinic. One hundred three patients (age 32-91, mean 68 +/- 11 years in 2006), who were followed at our hypertension clinic between 1991-2006, were retrospectively investigated. We compared the clinical characteristics of the patients in 2006 to those in 1991, 1996, and 2001, using the averaged BP determined at two occasions of each year for our analysis. The average BP decreased from 144 +/- 17/87 +/- 10 mmHg to 132 +/- 12/75 +/- 10 mmHg (p < 0.01) during the 15 years between 1991 and 2006. When good BP control was defined as < 140/90 mmHg, the rate of patients with good BP control increased from 35% in 1991 to 45% in 1996, to 54% in 2001 (p < 0.01 vs. 1991), and to 72% in 2006 (p < 0.01 vs. 1991). The number of anti-hypertensive drugs used in 2006 significantly increased compared to those in 1991, 1996, and 2001. More specifically, the use of diuretics and alpha-blockers increased significantly during this period. Results suggest that BP control improved in the 15 years studied, and the increased use of the anti-hypertensive drugs, as well as the increased awareness of the importance of strict BP control, seems to have contributed to improve the BP control.", 
    "75": "\u03b2-Adrenergic receptor blockers (\u03b2-blockers) are applied to treat high blood pressure, ischemic heart disease, and heart rhythm disturbances. Due to their widespread use and limited human metabolism, \u03b2-blockers are widely detected in sewage effluents and surface waters. \u03b2-Adrenergic receptors have been characterized in fish and other aquatic animals, so it can be expected that physiological processes regulated by these receptors in wild animals may be affected by the presence of \u03b2-blockers. Because ecotoxicological data on \u03b2-blockers are scarce, it was decided to choose the \u03b2-blocker atenolol as a case study pharmaceutical within the project ERAPharm. A starting point for the assessment of potential environmental risks was the European guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use. In Phase I of the risk assessment, the initial predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of atenolol in surface water (500\u2009ng L\u22121) exceeded the action limit of 10\u2009ng L\u22121. Thus, a Phase II risk assessment was conducted showing acceptable risks for surface water, for groundwater, and for aquatic microorganisms. Furthermore, atenolol showed a low potential for bioaccumulation as indicated by its low lipophilicity (log KOW\u2009=\u20090.16), a low potential for exposure of the terrestrial compartment via sludge (log KOC\u2009=\u20092.17), and a low affinity for sorption to the sediment. Thus, the risk assessment according to Phase II-Tier A did not reveal any unacceptable risk for atenolol. Beyond the requirements of the guideline, additional data on effects and fate were generated within ERAPharm. A 2-generation reproduction test with the waterflea Daphnia magna resulted in the most sensitive no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) of 1.8\u2009mg L\u22121. However, even with this NOEC, a risk quotient of 0.003 was calculated, which is still well below the risk threshold limit of 1. Additional studies confirm the outcome of the environmental risk assessment according to EMEA/CHMP (2006). However, atenolol should not be considered as representative for other \u03b2-blockers, such as metoprolol, oxprenolol, and propranolol, some of which show significantly different physicochemical characteristics and varying toxicological profiles in mammalian studies.",

    "94": "The Ca(2+)-dependent facilitation (CDF) of L-type Ca(2+) channels, a major mechanism for force-frequency relationship of cardiac contraction, is mediated by Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). Recently, CaMKII was shown to be activated by methionine oxidation. We investigated whether oxidation-dependent CaMKII activation is involved in the regulation of L-type Ca(2+) currents (I(Ca,L)) by H(2)O(2) and whether Ca(2+) is required in this process. Using patch clamp, I(Ca)(,L) was measured in rat ventricular myocytes. H(2)O(2) induced an increase in I(Ca,L) amplitude and slowed inactivation of I(Ca)(,L). This oxidation-dependent facilitation (ODF) of I(Ca)(,L) was abolished by a CaMKII blocker KN-93, but not by its inactive analog KN-92, indicating that CaMKII is involved in ODF. ODF was not affected by replacement of external Ca(2+) with Ba(2+) or presence of EGTA in the internal solutions. However, ODF was abolished by adding BAPTA to the internal solution or by depleting sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) stores using caffeine and thapsigargin. Alkaline phosphatase, beta-iminoadenosine 5'-triphosphate (AMP-PNP), an autophosphorylation inhibitor autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide (AIP), or a catalytic domain blocker (CaM-KIINtide) did not affect ODF. In conclusion, oxidation-dependent facilitation of L-type Ca(2+) channels is mediated by oxidation-dependent CaMKII activation, in which local Ca(2+) increases induced by SR Ca(2+) release is required.", 
    "95": "In previous work we described six point mutations that thermostabilised the turkey beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (tbeta(1)AR). The thermostable mutant, tbeta(1)AR-m23, had an apparent T(m) 21 degrees C higher than the native protein when solubilized in dodecylmaltoside (DDM) and, in addition, was significantly more stable in short chain detergents, which allowed its crystallization and structure determination. Identification of thermostabilizing mutations in tbeta(1)AR was performed by systematic mutagenesis followed by expressing and assaying each of the 318 mutants for their thermostability. This is time-consuming, so to facilitate studies on related receptors, we have studied the transferability of these mutations to the human adrenergic receptors, hbeta(1)AR and hbeta(2)AR, which have, respectively, 76% and 59% sequence identity to tbeta(2)AR, excluding the N- and C-termini. Thermostability assays revealed that hbeta(1)AR was much more unstable than tbeta(2)AR, whereas hbeta(2)AR was more stable than tbeta(1)AR. Addition of the 6 thermostabilizing mutations in tbeta(2)AR-m23 into both hbeta(2)AR and hbeta(2)AR increased their apparent T(m)s by 17 degrees C and 11 degrees C, respectively. In addition, the mutations affected the global conformation of the human receptors so that they were predominantly in the antagonist bound form, as was originally observed for tbeta(2)AR-m23. Thus, once thermostabilizing mutations have been identified in one G protein-coupled receptor, stabilization of close members within the subfamily is rapidly obtainable.", 
    "96": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) are consist of central obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension. Previous studies have reported possible association of migraine and MetS were reviewed. Migraine is a prevalent disabling disorder and have been regarded as an episodic and functional disorder. However, recent evidence suggests that in some cases, the disease may follow a chronic and progressive course. On the basis of available evidence, obesity is considered to be associated with migraine frequency and progression. The association between diabetes and migraine is unclear. Similarly, association of migraine with hypertension is also unclear. Female migraineurs commonly have an unfavorable cholesterol profile, i.e. one with high total cholesterol and low HDL levels. Obesity can be considered as a proinflammatory state in which increased inflammatory mediators, vascular hyperreactivity, plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) concentrations and decreased adiponectin concentrations are observed. These alterations can cause an increase in the frequency of migraine attacks developed of central sensitization, and thereafter, chronic migraine. Migraine and obesity may share some neurobiological abnormalities. Orexins modulate both pain and metabolism. Dysfunction in the orexin pathways seems to be a risk factor for both conditions. The methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene exhibit polymorphism. C677Tmutation in the MTHFR gene and the D-allele of the ACE gene are the shared risk factors for the development of migraine and cardiovascular disease. Certain beta-blockers, Ca blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angionten II receptor blocker (ARB) have excellent efficacy in migraine prophylaxis. The pharmacological mechanism of these agents do not seem to stand on their antihypertensive effect, but the other mechanism of action. Appropriate meal, sleep, and exercise are important for the management of MetS and migraine headaches.", 
    "97": "Beta blockers (beta-adrenoceptor blockers) are known to be used for the prophylactic treatment of migraine. The improvement of migraine in the patients who recieved propranolol for angina pectoris revealed the effectiveness of propranolol in migraine prophylaxis. Many clinical trials have confirmed that propranolol is effective in the prophylactic treatment of migraine. Other beta-blocking drugs, namely nadolol, metoprolol, atenolol, timolol and bisoprolol, have also been demonstrated to be effective in the prophylaxis of migraine. In contrast, several beta blockers with intrinsic sympathetic activity (ISA), such as alprenolol, oxprenolol, pindolol and acebutolol, have not been demonstrated to be effective in migraine prophylaxis. In this review, we have descrived the pharmacologic background and pharmacokinetics of the beta blockers that demonstrated a prophylactic effect for migraine will be described. We have also reviewed the results of clinical trials of beta-blocking drugs for migraine.", 
    "98": "The launch of triptans has significantly changed the treatment of migraine, leading to great improvement in the quality of life (QOL) of migraine patients. In routine clinical settings, few patients present with migraine attacks that clearly deviate from the typical frequency and severity of migraine, and migraine that is difficult to control with acute-phase treatment alone is frequently encountered. Under these circumstances, the importance of prophylactic therapy, including lifestyle guidance and drug treatment, has attracted attention. However, in Japan, only a small number of prophylactics are currently indicated for migraine, and the available options are insufficient. In this study, I have outlined the prophylactic strategies for migraine, including lifestyle guidance, on the basis of literature published in Europe and North America. In addition, I have presented my clinical experiences and research reports to introduce cases of migraine for which prophylactic therapy was indicated, to hypothesize the mechanisms of the prophylatic activity of specific drugs (e.g., anti-convulsants, anti-depressants, beta-blockers, AII antagonists, Ca channel blockers, leukotriene receptor antagonists, statins, anti-herpes zoster virus drugs) for their prophylactic effect on migraine, and to determine drug regimens.",

Use of Xal-Ease made it significantly less likely that the subject would need someone to help with drop instillation (6.9% vs 18.1%, respectively; p<0.001) and reduced the problem of the tip of the bottle touching the eye (3.2% vs 35.6%, respectively; p<0.001). Reported compliance rates were very high and similar across groups during both treatment periods. After 1 month of use during both treatment periods, more than 70% of subjects reported global satisfaction with Xal-Ease to their physicians.

Adrenergic activity is regulated in part by prejunctional alpha(2C)-adrenergic receptors (ARs), which exhibit genetic variation in humans. Bucindolol is a novel beta-AR blocking agent that also lowers systemic norepinephrine and thus is also a sympatholytic agent. This study investigated whether alpha(2C)-AR polymorphisms affect sympatholytic effects of bucindolol in patients with heart failure.",

Patients who were alpha(2C) Del carriers (heterozygotes or homozygotes) exhibited a much greater sympatholytic response to bucindolol (decrease in norepinephrine at 3 months of 153+/-57 pg/mL, P=0.012 compared with placebo versus decrease of 50+/-13 pg/mL in alpha(2C) wild type, P=0.0005 versus placebo; P=0.010 by interaction test). alpha(2C) Del carriers had no evidence of a favorable survival benefit from bucindolol (mortality compared with placebo hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.57 to 2.08; P=0.80), whereas bucindolol-treated subjects who were wild type for the alpha(2C)-AR had a 30% reduction in mortality (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.96; P=0.025).",

    "110": "Transepithelial Na(+) transport through epithelial Na(+) channels (ENaC) on the apical membrane and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity on the basolateral membrane of distal lung epithelial cells are critical for alveolar fluid clearance. Acute exposure to beta-adrenergic agonists stimulates lung fluid clearance by increasing Na(+) transport. We investigated the effects of chronic exposure to the beta(2)-adrenergic agonist terbutaline on the transepithelial Na(+) transport in rat fetal distal lung epithelia (FDLE). FDLE monolayers exposed to 10(-4) M terbutaline for 48 h had significantly increased propanolol-blockable transepithelial total and amiloride-sensitive short-circuit current (I(sc)); however, when these chronically exposed monolayers were acutely exposed to additional beta-agonists and intracellular cAMP upregulators, there was no further increase in I(sc). Monolayers exposed to terbutaline for >48 h had I(sc) similar to control cells. Ouabain-sensitive Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity was increased in 48-h terbutaline-exposed FDLE whose apical membranes were permeabilized with nystatin. In contrast, terbutaline did not increase amiloride-sensitive apical membrane I(sc) in FDLE whose basolateral membranes were permeabilized with nystatin. Terbutaline treatment did not affect alpha-, beta-, or gamma-ENaC mRNA or alpha-ENaC protein steady-state levels, but increased total cellular levels and rate of synthesis of alpha(1)-Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase protein in FDLE in the absence of any change in alpha(1)-Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase mRNA. Total cellular beta(1)-Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase mRNA and protein levels were not affected by terbutaline. These data suggest that FDLE have different responses from adult type II epithelial cells when chronically exposed to terbutaline, and their increased transepithelial Na(+) transport occurs via a posttranscriptional increase in alpha(1)-Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase expression.", 
    "111": "The stability of metoprolol tartrate tablets packaged in original high density polyethylene containers and repackaged in USP Class A unit-dose blister packs was investigated. Studies were conducted at 25 degrees C/60% relative humidity (RH) for 52 weeks and at 40 degrees C/75% RH for 13 weeks. The potency, dissolution, water content, loss on drying and hardness of the drug products were analyzed. Results indicated no differences in the stability between the tablets in both packages stored under 25 degrees C/60% RH. No difference in potency was found in both packages under either condition. However, a significant weight increase due to moisture uptake was observed for the repackaged tablets stored under 40 degrees C/75% RH. The weight increase was accompanied by a decrease in tablet hardness (6.5-0 kp) and a increase in dissolution rate (51-92%) in 5 min. Near-infrared (NIR) chemical imaging also monitored moisture uptake of the tablet non-invasively through the package. The observed changes in product stability may adversely affect the products bioavailability profile, even though the potency of the active drug remained within USP specification range of 90-110%. Study results suggest product quality can be negatively impacted even when using USP Class A repackaging materials.", 
    "112": "Waxy corn, Hylon VII, and common corn starches were hydroxypropylated to low and high levels, and their sustained release properties and matrix characteristics were studied. Hydroxypropylation had a stronger impact on Hylon VII and common corn starch matrices than on waxy corn ones, suggesting that the behavior of starch tablet was dominated by its amylose content. The introduction of hydroxypropyl groups increased the water holding capacity of all starches and resulted in more fluid-like and softer matrices with increased chain mobility for amylose-containing starches. There was a decrease in the tablet porosity and in the storage modulus of swollen tablets of Hylon VII and common corn starches after hydroxypropylation. Microscopic analyses revealed smoother and less porous tablet structure upon hydroxypropylation of all starches. Hydroxypropylation improved the sustained release ability of amylose-containing starch matrices, and conferred additional resistance to the hydrolytic action of pancreatin under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. However, hydroxypropylation had a detrimental impact on drug release from waxy corn starch matrices.", 
    "113": "In this work we have compared three analytical techniques (ELISA, GC-MS, and LC-MS) for the analysis of 16 beta-blockers: acebutolol, alprenolol, atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, carteolol, labetalol, metipranolol, metoprolol, nadolol, oxprenolol, pindolol, propranolol, sotalol, timolol, and bupranolol. Several sample-preparation methods were optimized for each technique and enabled compounds of interest to be extracted from small urine samples (1-2.5 mL). The results enabled us to assess the possibilities and the sensitivity of each technique for application to doping tests. ELISA, whose selectivity is very poor and sensitivity the lowest one, is, nevertheless, useful as a rapid screening method. GC/MS and LC/MS provide confirmation procedures with the identification and quantification of the beta-blockers with good sensitivity, accuracy, precision. The LC-MS analytical procedure allows the determination of the target analytes in the lower ng/mL range (0.53-2.23 ng/mL). The methodology was applied to the analysis of beta-blockers in different urines.",

The associations between the lowest VE/VCO(2) ratio, maximal oxygen uptake (peak VO(2)), the VE/VCO(2) slope, and major events (death or transplantation) were evaluated using proportional hazards analysis; adequacy of the predictive models was assessed using Akaike information criterion (AIC) weights. There were 147 major adverse events. In multivariate analysis, the lowest VE/VCO(2) ratio (higher ratio associated with greater risk) was similar to the VE/VCO(2) slope in predicting risk (hazard ratios [HR] per unit increment 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.4, and 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.7, respectively; P < .01), followed by peak VO(2) (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4, P=.01). Patients exhibiting abnormalities for all 3 responses had an 11.6-fold higher risk. The AIC weight for the 3 variables combined (0.94) was higher than any single response or any combination of 2.

    "117": "A new mechanistic model of drug release by osmotic pumping and diffusion from pellets coated with a semipermeable film developing pores created by the leaching of water-soluble compounds initially present in the coating, has been developed. The model describes dynamically all the main processes occurring during release, i.e. the inflow of solvent driven by the difference in osmotic pressure across the coating film, dissolution of the drug, swelling of the pellet due to mass accumulation, the build-up of hydrostatic pressure inside the pellet, and the outflow of the dissolved drug through the pores. The model was validated by comparison with the release profile of single metoprolol succinate pellets coated with a film made of ethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose (80:20). This system was chosen as it was shown that the release mechanism was osmotic pumping, and that the release occurred through small pores created in the coating by hydroxypropyl cellulose leaching. Insight into the release process was obtained via dose release experiments performed at different osmotic pressures of the release medium, single-pellet release experiments, and a study of the coating before and after immersion in the release medium using scanning electron microscopy. The good agreement found between the predicted release and the experimental data confirmed the validity of the model and its prediction capacity. The model can be used to calculate important variables, e.g. the drug concentration profile in a pore and the pressure build-up inside the pellet.", 
    "118": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the cardiovascular activity of Scorpaena plumieri venom in both in vivo and in vitro models. In anesthetized rats, doses of the venom (14-216 microg protein/kg) induced a transient increase in the mean arterial pressure. However at higher dose (338 microg protein/kg) this effect was followed by a sudden hypotension and the animal evolved to death. The heart rate was temporarily increased and followed by bradycardia using doses > or =108 microg/kg. In isolated rat hearts the crude venom (5-80 microg protein) produced dose-dependent positive ventricular chronotropic, inotropic, lusitropic and coronary vasoconstriction responses. Partial purification of an active fraction (CF, cardiovascular fraction) which reproduced the cardiovascular effects induced by crude venom on isolated hearts was achieved by conventional gel filtration chromatography. Adrenergic blockades, prazosin and propranolol, significantly attenuated these responses. The coronary vasoconstriction response to CF was also attenuated by chemical endothelium denudation. In conclusion, the data showed that S. plumieri fish venom induces disorders in the cardiovascular system. It also suggests that alpha(1) and beta-adrenergic receptors, and the vascular endothelium, are involved at least partially, in these cardiac effects.",

The electrophoretic conditions previously optimized were as follows: an uncoated fused-silica capillary, 4% w/v carboxymethyl-beta-CD in 25 mmol/L triethylamine/phosphoric acid (H(3)PO(4)) buffer at pH 9 as running electrolyte and 17 kV of voltage. UV detection was carried out at 208 nm. Liquid-liquid extraction using diethyl ether: ethyl acetate (1:1 v/v) as extractor solvent was employed for sample preparation. The calibration curves were linear over the concentration range of 0.25-10.0 microg/mL for each 4-OH-Prop enantiomer and 0.10-10.0 microg/mL for each Prop enantiomer (r>or=0.995). Within-day and between-day relative standard deviations and relative errors for precision and accuracy were lower than 15% for all the enantiomers. Finally, the validated method was used to evaluate Prop biotransformation in its mammalian metabolite 4-OH-Prop by some selected endophytic fungi. The screening of five strains of endophytic fungi was performed and all of them could biotransform Prop to some extent. Specifically, Glomerella cingulata (VA1) biotransformed 47.8% of (-)-(S)-Prop to (-)-(S)-4-OH-Prop with no formation of (+)-(R)-4-OH-Prop in 72 h of incubation.", 
    "124": "An increase in short-term blood pressure (BP) variability is a characteristic feature of hypertensive patients, especially in elderly patients. There is increasing evidence that large BP variability aggravates hypertensive target organ damage and is an independent risk factor for the cardiovascular events in elderly hypertensive patients. However, little is known about the underlying mechanism. We have created a rat model of a combination of hypertension and large BP variability by performing sinoaortic denervation (SAD) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). SAD aggravates left ventricular (LV)/myocyte hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis to a greater extent and impairs LV systolic function without changing mean BP in SHR. SAD upregulates cardiac monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and transforming growth factor-beta, and induces macrophage infiltration. Cardiac angiotensinogen expression is increased and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor is activated by SAD. A subdepressor dose of angiotensin receptor blocker abolishes SAD-induced inflammatory changes and cardiac remodeling and subsequently prevents systolic dysfunction in SHR+SAD. Accordingly, it is suggested that cardiac inflammation via activation of the cardiac angiotensin II system would play a role in the aggravation of cardiac remodeling and dysfunction in hypertensives with large BP variability.",

Coronary angiography was performed less often in patients with lower CrC [Delta: -16%, CI: (-31%, -1%)]. At discharge, nearly all patients received either an antiplatelet agent or warfarin regardless of CrC [Delta: -1%, CI: (-3%, 1%)]. Discharge use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers was comparable [Delta: 7%, CI: (-1%, 15%)]. beta-blockers [Delta: -9%, CI: (-17%, -1%)] and lipid-lowering drugs (LLDs) [Delta: -7%, CI: (-13%, -1%)] were used less frequently in patients with lower CrC. In multivariate analyses, decreased CrC predicted lower coronary angiography and LLD use, but not lower beta-blocker use at discharge.",

    "129": "Heart failure is a syndrome characterized initially by left ventricular dysfunction that triggers countermeasures aimed to restore cardiac output. These responses are compensatory at first but eventually become part of the disease process itself leading to further worsening cardiac function. Among these responses is the activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that provides inotropic support to the failing heart increasing stroke volume, and peripheral vasoconstriction to maintain mean arterial perfusion pressure, but eventually accelerates disease progression affecting survival. Activation of SNS has been attributed to withdrawal of normal restraining influences and enhancement of excitatory inputs including changes in: 1) peripheral baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes; 2) chemical mediators that control sympathetic outflow; and 3) central integratory sites. The interface between the sympathetic fibers and the cardiovascular system is formed by the adrenergic receptors (ARs). Dysregulation of cardiac beta(1)-AR signaling and transduction are key features of heart failure progression. In contrast, cardiac beta(2)-ARs and alpha(1)-ARs may function in a compensatory fashion to maintain cardiac inotropy. Adrenergic receptor polymorphisms may have an impact on the adaptive mechanisms, susceptibilities, and pharmacological responses of SNS. The beta-AR blockers and the inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis form the mainstay of current medical management of chronic heart failure. Conversely, central sympatholytics have proved harmful, whereas sympathomimetic inotropes are still used in selected patients with hemodynamic instability. This review summarizes the changes in SNS in heart failure and examines how modulation of SNS activity may affect morbidity and mortality from this syndrome.",

Introduction of DMHT (0.1 mM) from the cis-side of membrane blocked the amphotericin B-created conductance in symmetric solution of 100 mM KCI by 84 +/- 2%. The conductance of one-sided amphotericin B channels remained unaffected, when DMHT was introduced separately to the opposite trans-side of membrane. The kinetics of amphotericin B channels inhibition with DMHT showed no cooperativity allowing to expect that negatively charged ionogenic groups of these channels formed one DMHT binding site per channel as the slope of blocking rate determined in double-log coordinates was 1.5. Relatively high pK of binding with amphotericin B channels (5.13) suggests that this site provides high-affinity interaction with DMHT. The comparative analysis of inhibition kinetics with the other blockers of amphotericin B channels--tetraethylammonium and tetramethylammonium has proved that DMHT is a comparable though much more potent substitute for both tetraalkylammonia. Hence, the DMHT was proposed as a novel powerful blocker for cation-selective channels with the size of the pore ranging between 0.28 nm and 0.385 nm.",

Uncontrolled hypertension promotes the initiation and perpetuation of AF through atrial remodeling. Experimental evidence has demonstrated the important role of the renin-angiotensin system in atrial remodeling. Retrospective analysis of several large clinical trials and small prospective trials suggests the beneficial role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in preventing the onset and recurrence of AF in different populations. Several large prospective trials with longer follow-up periods are in progress. These trials may provide definitive evidence for the use of these agents in the prevention of AF.", 
    "140": "In patients with hypertension, pressure overload leads to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), myocardial fibrosis, and impaired diastolic filling without systolic dysfunction. Presently, diastolic heart failure accounts for about 50% of the heart failure population. Fatigue, dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, and peripheral edema are common presenting complaints. As a group, patients with diastolic heart failure are older and predominantly female. Diuretics are effective for treating congestive symptoms. beta Blockers and heart rate-lowering calcium blockers show benefit in smaller studies but have not been evaluated in definitive clinical trials. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers reduce blood pressure, LVH, and myocardial fibrosis; however, long-term studies with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers demonstrate little effect on symptoms or survival, and inconsistent effects on heart failure hospitalization. At present, evidence-based treatment includes antihypertensive therapy to reduce progression from hypertension to heart failure.

    "141": "Sepsis, despite recent therapeutic progress, still carries unacceptably high mortality rates. The adrenergic system, a key modulator of organ function and cardiovascular homeostasis, could be an interesting new therapeutic target for septic shock. Beta-adrenergic regulation of the immune function in sepsis is complex and is time dependent. However, beta2 activation as well as beta1 blockade seems to downregulate proinflammatory response by modulating the cytokine production profile. beta1 blockade improves cardiovascular homeostasis in septic animals, by lowering myocardial oxygen consumption without altering organ perfusion, and perhaps by restoring normal cardiovascular variability. Beta-blockers could also be of interest in the systemic catabolic response to sepsis, as they oppose epinephrine which is known to promote hyperglycemia, lipid and protein catabolism. The role of beta-blockers in coagulation is less clear cut. They could have a favorable role in the septic pro-coagulant state, as beta1 blockade may reduce platelet aggregation and normalize the depressed fibrinolytic status induced by adrenergic stimulation. Therefore, beta1 blockade as well as beta2 activation improves sepsis-induced immune, cardiovascular and coagulation dysfunctions. Beta2 blocking, however, seems beneficial in the metabolic field. Enough evidence has been accumulated in the literature to propose beta-adrenergic modulation, beta1 blockade and beta2 activation in particular, as new promising therapeutic targets for septic dyshomeostasis, modulating favorably immune, cardiovascular, metabolic and coagulation systems.",

Hydrophilic propranolol hydrochloride (PHCl) and lipophilic propranolol base (PB) were used as model drugs. All tested parameters, that is formulation composition, drug characteristics and testing conditions, influenced skin permeability and skin retention. A trend was observed showing that the skin permeation as well as skin retention decreases with the amount of phosphatidyl choline in the formulations for both tested model drugs (micelles > transfersomes > liposomes > microemulsion). The lipophilic model drug had higher skin permeability especially when incorporated into the systems containing mainly hydrophilic excipients. Skin retention, however, was not affected by the drug hydrophilicity to the same extent as skin permeability. Occlusion increased both skin retention and skin permeation for both model drugs.",

    "148": "In this study, different approaches were used to assess and overcome the severe effects of interference from the sample matrix from different types of sludges and wastewater on the analysis of nine beta-blockers and the beta sympathomimetic clenbuterol. The partitioning of the target compounds into sludge was investigated in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in both Canada and Germany to evaluate whether this is an important mechanism for removal from sewage. Due to ion suppression in the electro spray interface, absolute recoveries were for certain compounds even lower than 20%. By using surrogate standards, acceptable relative recoveries of >75% were achieved for WWTP influents and effluents and for sludges. These matrix effects underline the need to use appropriate surrogate standards to aid in analyte quantitation. Using the developed methods, beta-blockers were detected at concentrations up to 2 microg/L in WWTP effluents, with metoprolol, sotalol, and atenolol present as the dominant compounds. Removal rates within WWTPs were highly inconsistent and ranged from 1-69%. Propranolol showed the greatest degree of partitioning into sludge with solid/water partition coefficients of one order of magnitude higher than those for all other compounds. However, even for propranolol, sorption did not contribute significantly to the overall elimination in WWTPs. It is likely that the removal of beta-blockers during waste water treatment can be attributed primarily to microbial biodegradation.",

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) subtypes induce complications in diabetes. In a previous study, we found that glyceraldehyde-derived AGE (AGE-2) and glycolaldehyde-derived AGE (AGE-3) at 100 microg/ml induced the expressions of ICAM-1 and CD40 on monocytes and the production of interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. beta(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation has been demonstrated to modulate the production of inflammatory mediators. In the present study, we found that norepinephrine, epinephrine and isoproterenol inhibited AGE-2- and AGE-3-induced adhesion expression and cytokine production in a concentration-dependent manner. The action of these catecholamines was antagonized by beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, but not by alpha(1)-, alpha(2)- and beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist. beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists, salbutanol and terbutaline inhibited AGE-2- and AGE-3-induced adhesion expression and cytokine production, but alpha(1)-, alpha(2)- and beta(1)-adrenoceptor agonist had no effect, indicating that the stimulation of beta(2)-adrenoceptor might improve AGEs-initiated complications in diabetes.",

A 43-year-old woman presented with weight loss of more than 5 kg within one month, heat intolerance, and increased sweating. For the past month, she had been troubled by intermittent symptoms of vomiting, thirst, and constipation. On examination, she had tachycardia with no signs of dehydration.

We report the case of a 67-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer without a history of cardiac arrhythmia or ischemic heart disease who developed supraventricular tachycardia. The symptoms had started immediately after gemcitabine treatment. The arrhythmia responded poorly to common treatment and was eventually controlled by oral propranolol five days after admission. The present case suggests that supraventricular tachycardia may be triggered by gemcitabine even without underlying significant heart disease and may be resistant to conventional therapy.", 
    "178": "Testosterone (T), the principal androgen secreted by the testes, can have antiseizure effects. Some of these effects may be mediated by T's metabolites. T is metabolized to 3alpha-androstanediol (3alpha-diol). T, but not 3alpha-diol, binds androgen receptor. We investigated effects of 3alpha-diol (1 mg/kg, SC) and/or an androgen receptor blocker (flutamide 10 mg, SC), 1 hour prior to administration of pentylenetetrazol (85 mg/kg, IP). Juvenile male rats administered 3alpha-diol had less seizure activity than those administered vehicle. Flutamide had no effects. T is aromatized to 17beta-estradiol (E(2)), which, like 3alpha-diol, acts at estrogen receptors (ERs). Selective estrogen receptor modulators that favor ERalpha (propyl pyrazole triol, 17alpha-E(2)) or ERbeta (diarylpropionitrile, coumestrol, 3alpha-diol), or both (17beta-E(2)), were administered (0.1 mg/kg, SC) to juvenile male rats 1 hour before pentylenetetrazol. Estrogens with activity at ERbeta, but not those selective for ERalpha, produced antiseizure effects. Actions at ERbeta may underlie some antiseizure effects of T's metabolites.",

In hepatic microsomes, levels of oxidation activities were similar between the two monkey species, and substrate enantioselectivity (R-PL<S-PL) was observed in the formation of 5-OH-PL and/or NDP. Kinetic experiments revealed that the formation of all metabolites was biphasic in cynomolgus monkeys, whereas only the formation of NDP was biphasic in marmosets. Inhibition experiments employing human CYP antibodies and chemical inhibitors suggested that mainly CYP2D enzymes and partially CYP1A and 2C enzymes are involved in the oxidation of PL in both monkey liver microsomes. In small intestinal microsomes, activity levels were much higher in cynomolgus monkeys than in marmosets and humans and reversed substrate enantioselectivity (R-PL>S-PL) was seen in the formation of NDP in cynomolgus monkeys and humans and in the formation of 5-OH-PL in marmosets. The formation of the three metabolites in cynomolgus monkeys and the formation of NDP in marmosets were biphasic, while the formation of 4-OH-PL in humans was monophasic. From the inhibition experiments using CYP antibodies, CYP2C9 and 2C19 were thought to be involved as N-deisopropylases and CYP2D6 and 3A4 as 4-hydroxylases in human small intestine. Furthermore, CYP1A, 2C and 3A enzymes could be involved in cynomolgus monkeys and CYP2C and 3A enzymes in marmosets. These results indicate that the oxidative profile of PL in hepatic and small intestinal microsomes differ considerably among cynomolgus monkeys, marmosets and humans.", 
    "180": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is chronic arterial occlusive disease of the lower extremities caused by atherosclerosis whose prevalence increases with age. Only one-half of women with PAD are symptomatic. Symptomatic and asymptomatic women with PAD are at increased risk for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and mortality from coronary artery disease. Modifiable risk factors that predispose women to PAD include active cigarette smoking, passive smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, increased plasma homocysteine levels and hypothyroidism. With regard to management, women who smoke should be encouraged to quit and referred to a smoking cessation program. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism require treatment. Statins reduce the incidence of intermittent claudication and improve exercise duration until the onset of intermittent claudication in women with PAD and hypercholesterolemia. Anti-platelet drugs such as aspirin or especially clopidogrel, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins should be given to all women with PAD. Beta blockers are recommended if coronary artery disease is present. Exercise rehabilitation programs and cilostazol increase exercise time until intermittent claudication develops. Chelation therapy should be avoided as it is ineffective. Indications for lower extremity percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or bypass surgery in women are (1) incapacitating claudication interfering with work or lifestyle; and (2) limb salvage in women with limb-threatening ischemia as manifested by rest pain, non-healing ulcers, and/or infection or gangrene. Future research includes investigation of mechanisms underlying why women have a higher risk of graft failure and major amputation.", 
    "181": "Hypertension in the elderly is associated with increased occurrence rates of sodium sensitivity, isolated systolic hypertension, and 'white coat effect'. Arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction also increase with age. These factors should be considered in selecting antihypertensive therapy. The prime objective of this therapy is to prevent stroke. The findings of controlled trials show that there should be no cut-off age for treatment. A holistic program for controlling cardiovascular risks should be fully discussed with the patient, including evaluation to exclude underlying causes of secondary hypertension, and implementation of lifestyle measures. The choice of antihypertensive drug therapy is influenced by concomitant disease and previous medication history, but will typically include a thiazide diuretic as the first-line agent; to this will be added an angiotensin inhibitor and/or a calcium channel blocker. Beta blockers are not generally recommended, in part because they do not combat the effects of increased arterial stiffness. The hypertension-hypotension syndrome requires case-specific management. Drug-resistant hypertension is important to differentiate from faulty compliance with medication. Patients resistant to third-line drug therapy may benefit from treatment with extended-release isosorbide mononitrate. A trial of spironolactone may also be worthwhile.",

Time-course experiments with approximately 10mg L(-1) of initial pharmaceutical concentration resulted in percent degradations above 80% after 6h of incubation. Oxidation of pharmaceuticals was only observed under DBQ redox cycling conditions. A similar degradation pattern was observed when CBZP was added at the environmentally relevant concentration of 50 microg L(-1). Depletion of DBQ due to the attack of oxidizing agents was assumed to be the main limiting factor of pharmaceutical degradation. The main degradation products, that resulted to be pharmaceutical hydroxylated derivatives, were structurally elucidated.

    "196": "The hypothesis proposed is that heart failure (HF) is associated with a reactive hyperadrenergic state that increases circulating plasma free fatty acids (FFAs), which leads to impaired glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. We propose that increased FFA-induced mitochondrial uncoupling and substantial oxygen wastage is closely associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species, inflammatory markers, and the development of insulin resistance. The therapeutic aims of metabolic therapy are as follows: 1) to decrease hyperadrenergic drive; 2) to inhibit lipotoxicity and glucotoxicity; and 3) to increase glucose uptake by muscle. These aims are achieved, respectively, by the following: 1) the use of beta-adrenergic blockade and all measures that relieve the mechanical load on the heart; 2) the use of drugs that inhibit fatty acid oxidation (trimetazidine, perhexiline), although without clinical evidence that the heart is their major site of action in HF; and 3) increase of the transport of glucose into the cells by exercise and metformin. Of these measures, only data concerning the reduction of mortality as the result of exercise are available. Of all the other measures, there are substantial positive data on the use of trimetazidine that demonstrate metabolic and clinical benefit with almost no side effects, but data from a large outcome trial are lacking. Our data suggest a major extracardiac site of trimetazidine action. Ranolazine, which inhibits the late sodium inward current, requires testing in human HF. Insulin to reduce hyperglycemia and FFAs is untested in HF, with incretins such as glucagon-like peptide-1 on the horizon. Other future therapies may include malonyl-coenzyme A regulators to inhibit fatty acid oxidation, fish oil omega-3, and activators of protein kinase C-epsilon.", 
    "197": "We studied the release of propranolol hydrochloride (PHCl), a water-soluble amphiphilic drug, from monoolein (MO)/water and phytantriol/water systems.", 
    "198": "We related the dissolution profiles with phase behavior and viscosity of the different liquid crystalline phases. Diolein has been added aiming to stabilize the cubic phases and thus preventing formation of less viscous (lamellar) phases.", 
    "199": "Formulations display first-order release rates and diffusion release mechanism. Some formulations (mostly MO) were close to zero-order release in the first 120 minutes.", 
    "200": "Release mechanism can be influenced by phase changes during dissolution.", 
    "201": "Both MO and phytantriol show good potential to be used for propranolol hydrochloride sustained drug release.", 
    "202": "To explore the effect of Danhong Injection (DHI) on platelet activation and inflammatory factors in patients of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) after intervention therapy.", 
    "203": "One hundred ACS patients were randomly assigned to the DHI group and the control group equally. Both were treated with the conventional treatment, including aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-receptor blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, etc. for 2 weeks after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and to the patients in the DHI group, intravenous dripping of DHI was given simultaneously. Fasting venous blood of patients were collected before PCI and on the next morning of PCI to determine the platelet activation indices, expression of CD62p and receptor complex of glucose protein (GP) II b/III a by flow cytometry; plasma fibrinogen C (FIB-C) by scattering turbidimetry, and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) with emulsoid immuno-enhancing turbidimetric test kit. The outcomes were compared with those determined in 40 healthy persons for control.", 
    "204": "Serum levels of CD62p, GP II b/III a, FIB-C and hs-CRP in ACS patients were significantly higher than those in the healthy control (all P<0.01), and those were significantly higher after PCI than before PCI (P <0.05 or P<0.01). After being treated for 2 weeks, the 4 platelet activation indices were lowered to different extent in both groups, but the lowering in the DHI group was more significant than that in the control group (P<0.05).", 
    "205": "DHI can inhibit the platelet activation and inflammatory reaction in ACS patients after PCI."
