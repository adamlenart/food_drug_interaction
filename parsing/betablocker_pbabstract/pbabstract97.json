    "1": "The 251 consecutive AMI patients administered angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) or angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) were retrospectively investigated and divided into 2 groups: treated without \u03b2-blockers (no-\u03b2-blocker group, n=80) or treated with \u03b2-blockers before discharge (\u03b2-blocker group, n=171; carvedilol [n=91] or bisoprolol [n=80]). The doses of RAS-Is used for patients in the no-\u03b2-blocker group were at least double those used in the \u03b2-blocker group. No significant differences between the 2 groups were observed with regard to baseline characteristics. After a 12-month follow-up, the survival and cardiac event-free rates in the \u03b2-blocker group were significantly higher than those in the no-\u03b2-blocker group. The percent change in blood pressure did not significantly differ between the 2 groups, but the levels of brain natriuretic peptide, metalloproteinase-2, and metalloproteinase-9 and the left ventricular ejection fraction improved significantly in the \u03b2-blocker group compared with the no-\u03b2-blocker group. Regarding the 2 \u03b2-blockers, carvedilol treatment produced more favorable outcomes than bisoprolol.", 
    "2": "The data suggest that treatment with RAS-I in combination with \u03b2-blocker is more effective for patients after AMI than treatment with RAS-I alone.", 
    "3": "Raised levels of blood pressure result from the complex interplay of environmental and genetic factors. The complexity of blood pressure control mechanisms has major implications for individual responsiveness to antihypertensive drugs. The underlying haemodynamic disorder in the majority of cases is a rise in peripheral vascular resistance. This observation led to the discovery and development of increasingly sophisticated and targeted vasodilators, although many of the earlier antihypertensive drugs, by virtue of their actions blocking the sympathetic nervous system, had a vasodilator component to their mode of action. A recent meta-analysis of placebo controlled trials of monotherapy in unselected hypertensives, reports average (placebo-corrected) blood pressure responses to single agents of 9.1 mmHg systolic and 5.5 mmHg diastolic pressure. These average values disguise the extremely wide ranging responses in individuals across a fall of 20-30 mmHg systolic at one extreme, to no effect at all, or even a small rise in blood pressure at the other. The second factor determining individual responses to monotherapy is the extent to which initial falls in pressure are opposed by reflex responses in counter regulatory mechanisms that are activated following the blood pressure reduction. Thus, a satisfactory blood pressure response is rarely reached with monotherapy alone. What then is the next step if blood pressure is not a goal after the patient has been treated with monotherapy for a few weeks? Should you uptitrate, substitute or combine?", 
    "4": "Infantile hemangiomas (IH) are the most common childhood tumors. In 2008, Labreze reported the serendipitous effect of oral propranolol on hemangioma and since then it has overshadowed the use of other therapeutic modalities in the treatment of IH. The aim of this prospective, clinical study was to assess the efficacy and safety profile of oral propranolol at a fixed dose of 2 mgkg(-1) in the treatment of 30 patients with problematic IH. Propranolol treatment continued for a duration of 2-14 months where 60% of the patients (n=18) showed a final excellent response with complete resolution of the lesion (P<0.001). 20% (n=6) showed a good response with more than 50% reduction in the size of the IH. 16.6% showed a fair response (n=5) with less than 50% reduction in the size of the IH. Only one patient (3.3%) was resistant to treatment. Five patients (17.24%) showed evidence of rebound growth after cessation of therapy and responded well to re-treatment.We did not face any side effects related to the oral propranolol. In conclusion, propranolol therapy at a fixed dose of 2 mgkg(-1), given in three equally divided doses, is a very safe and effective regimen in the treatment of IH.",

Within 24 weeks of discharge, 478 (32.8%) patients had died and 192 (13.2%) patients had serial KCCQ scores <45. After adjusting for 23 predischarge covariates, independent predictors of the combined end point included low admission KCCQ score, high B-type natriuretic peptide, hyponatremia, tachycardia, hypotension, absence of \u03b2-blocker therapy, and history of diabetes mellitus and arrhythmia. A simplified predischarge HF score for subsequent death or unfavorable QoL had moderate discrimination (c-statistic 0.72).

    "16": "The degradation of the beta-blockers atenolol, metoprolol tartrate and propranolol hydrochloride was studied by electro-Fenton (EF) and solar photoelectro-Fenton (SPEF). Solutions of 10 L of 100 mg L\u207b\u00b9 of total organic carbon of each drug in 0.1 M Na\u2082SO\u2084 with 0.5 mM Fe\u00b2\u207a of pH 3.0 were treated in a recirculation flow plant with an electrochemical reactor coupled with a solar compound parabolic collector. Single Pt/carbon felt (CF) and boron-doped diamond (BDD)/air-diffusion electrode (ADE) cells and combined Pt/ADE-Pt/CF and BDD/ADE-Pt/CF cells were used. SPEF treatments were more potent with the latter cell, yielding 95-97% mineralization with 100% of maximum current efficiency and energy consumptions of about 0.250 kWh g TOC\u207b\u00b9. However, the Pt/ADE-Pt/CF cell gave much lower energy consumptions of about 0.080 kWh g TOC\u207b\u00b9 with slightly lower mineralization of 88-93%, then being more useful for its possible application at industrial level. The EF method led to a poorer mineralization and was more potent using the combined cells by the additional production of hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) from Fenton's reaction from the fast Fe\u00b2\u207a regeneration at the CF cathode. Organics were also more rapidly destroyed at BDD than at Pt anode. The decay kinetics of beta-blockers always followed a pseudo first-order reaction, although in SPEF, it was accelerated by the additional production of \u2022OH from the action of UV light of solar irradiation. Aromatic intermediates were also destroyed by hydroxyl radicals. Ultimate carboxylic acids like oxalic and oxamic remained in the treated solutions by EF, but their Fe(III) complexes were photolyzed by solar irradiation in SPEF, thus explaining its higher oxidation power. NO\u2083\u207b was the predominant inorganic ion lost in EF, whereas the SPEF process favored the production of NH\u2084\u207a ion and volatile N-derivatives.", 
    "17": "Prolonged corrected QT (QT(c)) interval and vagal dysfunction are common occurrences in liver cirrhosis and are determinants of mortality in patients with chronic liver disease. We evaluated whether propranolol can affect the relationship between QT(c) interval and cardiac vagal control of heart rate variability (HRV) in cirrhotic patients awaiting liver transplantation.", 
    "18": "We compared 50 cirrhotic patients (M/F = 43/7, 52.6 \u00b1 8.4 years, Child-Pugh class A/B/C: 9/24/17) receiving propranolol with a sex-, age-, and liver disease severity-matched control group of 50 patients (M/F = 43/7, 52.0 \u00b1 8.3 year, Child-Pugh class A/B/C: 9/24/17) not receiving propranolol. Among the parameters evaluated were QT(c) interval and cardiac vagal indices of HRV, including the root mean square of successive differences in R-R intervals (RMSSD); spectral power in the high-frequency range (HF); standard deviation (SD)1 in Poincare plot; and sample entropy. Correlations between QT(c) interval and vagal indices of HRV were analyzed.", 
    "19": "The mean duration of preoperative propranolol treatment in the propranolol group was 19.4 \u00b1 24.7 months. QT(c) interval was significantly lower, whereas RMSSD, HF, SD1, and sample entropy were significantly higher in the propranolol group than in the control group. Correlation coefficients between QT(c) interval and RMSSD, HF, SD1, and sample entropy were higher in the propranolol group than in the control group.", 
    "20": "The prolonged QT(c) interval observed in cirrhotic patients may be reduced by propranolol administration, an effect attributable to improved vagal cardiac modulation.

    "21": "The cannabinoid system is known to interact with a variety of neuromodulators in the central nervous system and impacts diverse behaviors. Previous studies have demonstrated that limbic norepinephrine is a critical determinant in the behavioral expression of cannabinoid-induced aversion. The present study was carried out to define the adrenergic receptor subtype involved in mediating cannabinoid-induced behavioral responses. An acute microinjection of the \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blocker, betaxolol, directly into the nucleus accumbens (Acb), was able to prevent WIN 55,212-2-induced aversion, but not lithium-induced aversion, as measured in a place conditioning paradigm. These results suggest that noradrenergic transmission in the Acb is important for cannabinoid-induced aversion and that beta-adrenergic antagonists may be effective in counteracting negative side effects of cannabinoid-based agents.", 
    "22": "We have found recently that exercise training is effective in the treatment of the postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Whether this nondrug treatment is superior to \"standard\" drug therapies, such as \u03b2-blockade, is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that exercise training but not \u03b2-blockade treatment improves symptoms, hemodynamics, and renal-adrenal responses in POTS patients. Nineteen patients (18 women and 1 man) completed a double-blind drug trial (propranolol or placebo) for 4 weeks, followed by 3 months of exercise training. Fifteen age-matched healthy individuals (14 women and 1 man) served as controls. A 2-hour standing test was performed before and after drug treatment and training. Hemodynamics, catecholamines, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone were measured supine and during 2-hour standing. We found that both propranolol and training significantly lowered standing heart rate. Standing cardiac output was lowered after propranolol treatment (P=0.01) but was minimally changed after training. The aldosterone:renin ratio during 2-hour standing remained unchanged after propranolol treatment (4.1\u00b11.7 [SD] before versus 3.9\u00b12.0 after; P=0.46) but modestly increased after training (5.2\u00b12.9 versus 6.5\u00b13.0; P=0.05). Plasma catecholamines were not affected by propranolol or training. Patient quality of life, assessed using the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey, was improved after training (physical functioning score 33\u00b110 before versus 50\u00b19 after; social functioning score 37\u00b19 versus 48\u00b16; both P<0.01) but not after propranolol treatment (34\u00b110 versus 36\u00b111, P=0.63; 39\u00b17 versus 39\u00b15, P=0.73). These results suggest that, for patients with POTS, exercise training is superior to propranolol at restoring upright hemodynamics, normalizing renal-adrenal responsiveness, and improving quality of life.", 
    "23": "Reducing reconsolidation of reactivated traumatic memories may offer a novel pharmacological treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Preclinical research is needed to identify candidate drugs. We evaluated the ability of postreactivation mifepristone (RU38486, a glucocorticoid antagonist), alone and in combination with propranolol (a beta-adrenergic blocker), both given systemically, to reduce cue-conditioned fear in rats. On Day 1, a 30-s tone conditioned stimulus (CS) was paired with an electric shock unconditioned stimulus (US). On Day 2, the CS was presented without the US (reactivation), and the freezing conditioned response (CR) was measured. This was immediately followed by subcutaneous injection of vehicle, mifepristone 30 mg/kg, propranolol 10 mg/kg, or both. On Day 3, the CR was again measured as a test of postreactivation long-term memory (PR-LTM). On Day 10, the CR was again measured to evaluate spontaneous recovery. On Day 11, the US was presented alone (reinstatement). On Day 12, the CR was again measured. A fifth group received mifepristone without the CS presentation (nonreactivation) on Day 2. A sixth group was tested four hours after the Day 2 mifepristone injection to measure postreactivation short-term memory. Postreactivation, but not nonreactivation, mifepristone produced a decrement in the CR that did not undergo spontaneous recovery and underwent only modest reinstatement. Mifepristone did not exert its effect when administered concurrently with propranolol. Postreactivation mifepristone did not impair short-term memory. Systemic mifepristone blocks the reconsolidation of cue-conditioned fear in rats. Concurrent administration of propranolol prevents this effect. Postreactivation mifepristone may be a promising treatment for PTSD, but not necessarily in combination with propranolol.",

A linear extrapolation of these market shares, based on 1998 to 2003 data, predicted that the 2 curves should cross in 2005, a prediction reinforced by the European Medicines Agency authorization (2002) of PGAs as first-line glaucoma treatments. That this did not occur may be explained by Italy's refusal to reimburse PGAs as first-line therapy. IMS data identified Italy and Germany as 2 countries in which BBs are still more frequently prescribed than PGAs. Treatment persistence with PGAs as monotherapy, in PGA-naive patients, was longer than for BBs according to both Padova and UK-GPRD data. This held true for both first-line and second-line PGA prescriptions (UK-GPRD); the persistence of second-line PGA equalled first-line BB treatment.",

AA patients were more likely to sustain blunt trauma, were older, more often female, more severely injured, and sustained more head injuries. The only independent risk factor for developing an AA was age > 55 years (odds ratio = 4.6, P < 0.01). Mortality was higher in the AA group (33% vs. 14%, P < 0.01) and AA was an independent risk factor for mortality (odds ratio = 1.7, P = 0.01). Twenty-eight per cent (n = 59) of AA patients received beta-blockers in the postinjury period, and these patients had lower mortality (22% vs. 37%, P = 0.04). AA occurs in 6 per cent of trauma patients admitted to the ICU. Developing an AA is an independent risk factor for mortality after trauma.

In this study, we found intraperitoneal injection of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (10 mg/kg) 1 h before reinstatement training attenuated reinstatement of fear memory in rats. Conversely, reinstatement was facilitated by intra-amygdalar administration of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (Iso; 2 \u03bcg per side) 30 min before reinstatement training. The frequency and amplitude of the miniature IPSC (mIPSC) and the surface expression of the \u03b23 and \u03b32 subunits of the GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) were significantly lower in reinstated than in extinction rats, whereas the AMPA/NMDA ratio and the surface expression of GluR1 and GluR2 in the amygdala did not differ between groups. In amygdala slices, Iso-induced decrease in the surface \u03b23 subunit of GABA(A) receptor was blocked by a Tat-conjugated dynamin function-blocking peptide (Tat-P4) pretreatment (10 \u03bcm for 30 min). By contrast, Tat-scramble peptide had no effect. Intravenous injection (3 \u03bcmol/kg) or intra-amygdalar infusion (30 pmol per side) of Tat-P4 interfered with reinstatement. Reinstatement increased the association between protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and the \u03b23 subunit of the GABA(A)R, which was abolished by PP1/PP2A inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A.

    "104": "Acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS) are a heterogeneous group of commonly encountered and difficult to manage clinical syndromes associated with high morbidity and mortality. Dyspnoea, pulmonary, and systemic congestion often characterize AHFS due to acutely elevated intracardiac filling pressures and fluid overload. Diuresis, respiratory support, vasodilator therapy, and gradual attenuation of the activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) are the keystones of AHFS management. Despite available therapies, post-discharge mortality and re-hospitalization rates remain unacceptably high in AHFS. Neurohumoral-mediated cardiorenal dysfunction and congestion may contribute to these high event rates. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) serve a dual therapeutic role by enhancing diuresis and attenuating the pathological effects of RAAS and SNS activation. Although these agents are indicated in patients with chronic, severe heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HF/REF) and in patients with HF/REF post-myocardial infarction (MI), they have not been systematically studied in patients with AHFS.

The concept of plaque stabilisation emerged about 20 years ago to explain the discrepancy between the reduction of cardiovascular events in patients receiving lipid lowering therapy and the small decrease seen in angiographic evaluation of atherosclerosis. Since then, the concept of a vulnerable plaque has received a lot of attention in basic and clinical research leading to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the vulnerable plaque and acute coronary syndromes. From pathological and clinical observations, plaques that have recently ruptured have thin fibrous caps, large lipid cores, exhibit outward remodelling and invasion by vasa vasorum. Ruptured plaques are also focally inflamed and this may be a common denominator of the other pathological features. Plaques with similar characteristics, but which have not yet ruptured, are believed to be vulnerable to rupture. Experimental studies strongly support the validity of anti-inflammatory approaches to promote plaque stability. Unfortunately, reliable non-invasive methods for imaging and detection of such plaques are not yet readily available. There is a strong biological basis and supportive clinical evidence that low-density lipoprotein lowering with statins is useful for the stabilisation of vulnerable plaques. There is also some clinical evidence for the usefulness of antiplatelet agents, beta blockers and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors for plaque stabilisation. Determining the causes of plaque rupture and designing diagnostics and interventions to prevent them are urgent priorities for current basic and clinical research in cardiovascular area.",

Beta-blockers are commonly given to cats with heart disease, particularly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a common cause of feline heart disease. We hypothesized that polymorphisms are present in the feline ADRB1 gene, which could result in an altered pharmacologic response to beta-blocker therapy. We sequenced the feline ADRB1 gene in 42 cats of five breeds. We identified three polymorphisms within the ADRB1 gene. Two polymorphisms did not change the amino acid produced and are unlikely to be clinically significant. A third polymorphism identified was an AA/CC substitution at the 830-831 base pair sites. This alteration changed the amino acid produced from proline to glutamine at position 277 and computer modeling predicts an altered protein structure. Further study is warranted to determine if this polymorphism alters response to beta blocker therapy.",

Male animals, implanted with catheters in a femoral artery and a jugular vein, were submitted to sino-aortic (SAD), aortic (Ao-X) or carotid sinus denervation (Ca-X), 5 days prior to the experiments. After basal recording of AP, the lack of reflex bradycardia elicited by administration of phenylephrine was used to confirm the efficacy of SAD, and cardiac autonomic blockade with methylatropine and propranolol was performed. The AP and PI variability were calculated in the time and frequency domains (spectral analysis/fast Fourier transform) with the spectra quantified in low- (LF; 0.25-1 Hz) and high-frequency bands (HF; 1-5 Hz). Basal AP and AP variability were higher after SAD, Ao-X or Ca-X than in intact mice. Pulse interval was similar among the groups, whereas PI variability was lower after SAD. Atropine elicited a slight tachycardia in control mice but did not change PI after total or partial denervation. The bradycardia caused by propranolol was higher after SAD, Ao-X or Ca-X compared with intact mice. The increase in the variability of AP was accompanied by a marked increase in the LF and HF power of the AP spectra after baroreceptor denervation. The LF and HF power of the PI were reduced by SAD and by Ao-X or Ca-X. Therefore, both sino-aortic and partial baroreceptor denervation in mice elicits hypertension and a remarkable increase in AP variability and cardiac sympathetic tonus. Spectral analysis showed an important contribution of the baroreflex in the power of LF oscillations of the PI spectra. Both sets of baroreceptors seem to be equally important in the autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system in mice.",

Also, there is some evidence that melatonin and carvedilol are antioxidant.Therefore, in this study, the prophylactic effects of melatonin and carvedilol on teratogenic effects of CP was compared. This study was performed on 31 pregnant mice that were divided into six groups. The control group received normal saline and test groups received CP (20mg/kg), carvedilol (5mg/kg), melatonin (10mg/kg), CP (20mg/kg) pluscarvedilol (5mg/kg) and CP (20mg/kg) plus melatonin (10mg/kg) intraperitoneally on the 10th day of gestation, respectively.

Cleft palate, spina bifida and exencephalyincidence were 62.79%, 62.79% and 30.23% in fetuses of mice that received only CP. Cleft palate,spina bifida, exencephaly, and incidence were 45.45%, 9.09% and 0% in group which received CP plus carvedilol (5mg/kg), respectively.However, cleft palate, spina bifida and exencephalyincidence were 62.5%, 45.83% and 4.16% range in the group which received CP plus melatonin (10mg/kg), respectively. In addition, theincidence of skeletal anomalies including limb, vertebral, and sternaldefects were decreased by melatonin and carvedilol. The mean weight and length of animal fetuses that had received melatonin and carvedilol were significantly greater than those receiving only CP.

However, carvedilol was reported not to affect Kir2.1 channels, which lack 166 Cys. Here, we demonstrate that carvedilol inhibits Kir2.3 carried current by an alternative mechanism. Carvedilol inhibited Kir2.3 channels with at least 100 fold higher potency (IC(50)=0.49 \u03bcM) compared to that for Kir2.1 (IC(50)>50 \u03bcM).

In the presence of exogenous PIP(2), Kir2.3 channel inhibition by carvedilol was strongly reduced (80 vs. 2% current inhibition).

To examine a possible role for K(ATP) channels in modulating excitability in hippocampal circuits, we recorded the activity of single K(ATP) channels in cell-attached patches of granule cells in the mouse dentate gyrus during bursts of action potentials generated by antidromic stimulation of the mossy fibers. Ensemble averages of the open probability (p(open)) of single K(ATP) channels over repeated trials of stimulated spike activity showed a transient increase in p(open) in response to action potential firing. Channel currents were identified as K(ATP) channels through blockade with glibenclamide and by comparison with recordings from Kir6.2 knock-out mice. The transient elevation in K(ATP) p(open) may arise from submembrane ATP depletion by the Na(+)-K(+) ATPase, as the pump blocker strophanthidin reduced the magnitude of the elevation. Both the steady-state and stimulus-elevated p(open) of the recorded channels were higher in the presence of the ketone body R-\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, consistent with earlier findings that ketone bodies can affect K(ATP) activity. Using perforated-patch recording, we also found that K(ATP) channels contribute to the slow afterhyperpolarization following an evoked burst of action potentials. We propose that activity-dependent opening of K(ATP) channels may help granule cells act as a seizure gate in the hippocampus and that ketone-body-mediated augmentation of the activity-dependent opening could in part explain the effect of the ketogenic diet in reducing epileptic seizures.", 
    "157": "Flavonoids, a group of natural compounds found in a variety of vegetables and herbal medicines, have been intensively reported on regarding their estrogen-like activities and particularly their ability to affect bone metabolism. Here, different subclasses of flavonoids were screened for their osteogenic properties by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity in cultured rat osteoblasts. The flavone baicalin derived mainly from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis showed the strongest induction of alkaline phosphatase activity. In cultured osteoblasts, application of baicalin increased significantly the osteoblastic mineralization and the levels of mRNAs encoding the bone differentiation markers, including osteonectin, osteocalcin, and collagen type 1\u03b11. Interestingly, the osteogenic effect of baicalin was not mediated by its estrogenic activity. In contrast, baicalin promoted osteoblastic differentiation via the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway; the activation resulted in the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 and, subsequently, induced the nuclear accumulation of the \u03b2-catenin, leading to the transcription activation of Wnt-targeted genes for osteogenesis. The baicalin-induced osteogenic effects were fully abolished by DKK-1, a blocker of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin receptor. Moreover, baicalin also enhanced the mRNA expression of osteoprotegerin, which could regulate indirectly the activation of osteoclasts. Taken together, our results suggested that baicalin could act via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling to promote osteoblastic differentiation. The osteogenic flavonoids could be very useful in finding potential drugs, or food supplements, for treating post-menopausal osteoporosis.",

An independent repetition of the mixture experiment resulted in a principally similar concentration-response curve, again with clear hormesis effects in the lower range of test concentrations. However, the curve was shifted toward higher effect concentrations (EC50 1,070 nmol/L), which likely is due to changes in the initial species composition.

In this paper we give an overview of the current management of hypertensive crisis and discuss several important changes incorporated in the 2010 revision. These changes include a modification in terminology replacing 'malignant hypertension' with 'hypertensive crisis with retinopathy and reclassification of hypertensive crisis with retinopathy under hypertensive emergencies instead of urgencies. With regard to the treatment of hypertensive emergencies, nicardipine instead of nitroprusside or labetalol is favoured for the management of perioperative hypertension, whereas labetalol has become the drug of choice for the treatment of hypertension associated with pre-eclampsia. For the treatment of hypertensive urgencies, oral administration of nifedipine retard instead of captopril is recommended as first-line therapy. In addition, a section on the management of hypertensive emergencies according to the type of target organ involved has been added. Efforts to increase the awareness and treatment of hypertension in the population at large may lower the incidence of hypertensive crisis and its complications.", 
    "170": "The use of \u03b2-receptor blockers in peripheral arterial disease is controversial for their impact on vasomotor tone. The \u03b2-blocker nebivolol possesses vasodilating, endothelium-dependent, NO-releasing properties that might be beneficial in peripheral arterial disease. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects and tolerability of nebivolol in comparison with metoprolol in these patients. A total of 128 patients with intermittent claudication and essential hypertension were included and double-blind randomized to receive 5 mg of nebivolol (N=65) or 95 mg of metoprolol (N=63) once daily. End points were changes in ankle-brachial index, initial and absolute claudication distance, endothelial function assessed by flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery, blood pressure, and quality of life using the claudication scale questionnaire. End point analysis was possible in 109 patients (85.2%). After the 48-week treatment period, ankle-brachial index and absolute claudication distance improved significantly in both patient groups (P<0.05 for both), with no difference across treatments. A significant increase of initial claudication distance was found in the nebivolol group. Adjusted mean change of initial claudication distance was 33.9% after nebivolol (P=0.003) and 16.6% after metoprolol (P=0.12) treatment. Quality of life was not influenced by either treatment, and there was no relevant change in flow-mediated dilatation in patients treated with nebivolol or metoprolol (P=0.16). Both drugs were equally effective in lowering blood pressure. In conclusion, \u03b2-blocker therapy was well tolerated in patients with intermittent claudication and arterial hypertension during a treatment period of \u22481 year. In the direct comparison, there was no significant difference between nebivolol and metoprolol.", 
    "171": "The simultaneous analysis of tricyclic antidepressant (amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin and nortriptyline) and \u03b2-blocker (alprenolol, labetalol and propranolol) drugs in wastewater was developed via sweeping-micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) together with a simple liquid-liquid extraction step. For sweeping-MEKC, the amount of organic modifier in the separation electrolyte, the concentration of phosphoric acid in the sample matrix and the injection time of the sample were optimized. Sensitivity enhancements of up to 305-fold were achieved via sweeping. This allowed limits of detection (LOD) from 7 to 27 ng/mL. The relative standard deviations of migration time, corrected peak area and peak height were less than 3.2%, 7.8% and 4.5%, respectively. Liquid-liquid extraction using dichloromethane as solvent afforded up to 21-fold enrichment of the drugs from spiked wastewater. No interference of the sample matrix was observed and recoveries were obtained in the range of 77-113% for all analytes except labetalol at three spiking levels of 16, 80 and 160 ng/mL. Detection at the ng/mL level makes this simple, environmentally friendly and cost effective method competitive against recently reported methods using advanced liquid-phase separation techniques for monitoring similar drugs in wastewater.", 
    "172": "The Cochrane analysis comprises data from 18 trials with a total of 140,000 patients. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were superior to beta-blockers on stroke reduction. CCBs were also superior to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on stroke reduction, most likely explained by differences in achieved blood pressure. We question the conclusion, that diuretics are superior to CCBs as agents of first choice, but the analysis supports the view taken by many guidelines, that beta-blockers no longer are drugs of first choice.", 
    "173": "In metabolic syndrome, hypertension has been noted as one of the most important risk factors that contributes to cardiovascular disease. We have evaluated the effect of a selective adrenergic \u03b2(1)-receptor blocker, atenolol, on blood pressure and pulse rate in metabolic syndrome.", 
    "174": "Metabolic syndrome patients with hypertension (n=28) and a control group (n=20) were given atenolol (50 mg/day) for 4 weeks. Blood pressure, pulse rate, and blood biochemical parameters were monitored.",

Decrease in pulse rate resulting from the treatment was greater in the metabolic syndrome group than in the control group (control 14 \u00b1 3/min, metabolic syndrome 21 \u00b1 2/min, P<0.05). Decrease in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure was greater in the metabolic syndrome group than in the control group (SBP, control 8 \u00b1 3, metabolic syndrome 23 \u00b1 3 mmHg, P<0.05; DBP, control 6 \u00b1 3, metabolic syndrome 13 \u00b1 2 mmHg, P<0.05). There was a positive association between decrease in SBP and the waist measurements of patients, between the decrease in DBP and the waist measurements, and between the decrease in pulse rate and the waist measurements. We also found that there was a positive association between the decrease in SBP and initial SBP, between the decrease in DBP and initial DBP, and between the decrease in pulse rate and initial pulse rate.",

    "177": "We investigated in 136 consecutive patients with heart failure receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) the effect of carvedilol versus metoprolol CR/XL versus no beta blocker on mortality. Of the 136 patients, 42 (31%) were on carvedilol, 80 (59%) were on metoprolol CR/XL, and 14 (10%) were not on a beta blocker. A decrease of left ventricular end-systolic volume \u226515% after CRT was defined as a positive response to CRT. Of the 136 patients, 62 (46%) responded to CRT. It was found that both carvedilol and metoprolol CR/XL were not related to CRT response on using Cox univariate regression analysis. Twenty-two of the 136 patients (16%) died during follow-up of 17 \u00b1 10 months after initiating CRT. Mortality occurred in 14 of 80 patients (18%) on metoprolol CR/XL, in 3 of 42 patients (7%) on carvedilol, and in 5 of 14 patients (36%) not on beta blockers (P = 0.04). After adjustment for age, gender, and the variables with significant differences by Cox univariate regression, both carvedilol (hazard ratio = 0.14; P = 0.03; 95% confidence interval = 0.02-0.86) and metoprolol CR/XL (hazard ratio = 0.19; P = 0.02; 95% confidence interval = 0.04-0.80) were found to be related to mortality by Cox multivariate regression.", 
    "178": "The regulation of energy metabolism by the central nervous system during endurance exercise was examined. We conducted respiratory gas analysis by functionally paralyzing the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), the lateral hypothalamic area, and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus with local anaesthetic (lidocaine) during treadmill running at a velocity that allowed for efficient fatty acid oxidation. Our results showed that only the lidocaine treatment of the VMH attenuated fatty acid oxidation during endurance exercise. The monoaminergic neural activities at these nuclei during in vivo microdialysis in rats under the same conditions indicated a significant increase in the extracellular concentration of noradrenaline in all nuclei. Similarly, a significant increase in dopamine occurred at some points during exercise, but no change in serotonin concentration occurred regardless of exercise. Disruption of noradrenergic projections to the VMH by 6-hydroxydopamine attenuated the enhancement of fat oxidation during running. Blocker treatments clarified that noradrenergic inputs to the VMH are mediated by \u03b2-adrenoceptors. These data indicate that information about peripheral tissues status is transmitted via noradrenergic projections originating in the medulla oblongata, which may be an important contribution by the VMH and its downstream mechanisms to enhanced fatty acid oxidation during exercise.", 
    "179": "Hypertension is often associated with increased oxidative stress and systemic insulin resistance. Use of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockers in hypertension is limited because of potential negative influence on insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. We sought to determine the impact of nebivolol, a selective vasodilatory \u03b2\u2081-adrenergic blocker, on whole-body insulin sensitivity, skeletal muscle oxidative stress, insulin signaling, and glucose transport in the transgenic TG(mRen2)27 rat (Ren2). This rodent model manifests increased tissue renin angiotensin expression, excess oxidative stress, and whole-body insulin resistance. Young (age, 6-9 weeks) Ren2 and age-matched Sprague-Dawley control rats were treated with nebivolol 10 mg/(kg d) or placebo for 21 days. Basal measurements were obtained for glucose and insulin to calculate the homeostasis model assessment. In addition, insulin metabolic signaling, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity, reactive oxygen species, and ultrastructural changes as evaluated by transmission electron microscopy were examined ex vivo in skeletal muscle tissue. The Ren2 rat demonstrated systemic insulin resistance as examined by the homeostasis model assessment, along with impaired insulin metabolic signaling in skeletal muscle. This was associated with increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial remodeling. Treatment with nebivolol was associated with improvement in insulin resistance and decreased NADPH oxidase activity/levels of reactive oxygen species in skeletal muscle tissue. Nebivolol treatment for 3 weeks reduces NADPH oxidase activity and improves systemic insulin resistance in concert with reduced oxidative stress in skeletal muscle in a young rodent model of hypertension, insulin resistance, and enhanced tissue RAS expression.", 
    "180": "P-gp is playing significant role in the development of the drug resistance by altering the absorption of drugs. The objective of present investigation was to study the effect of verapamil on the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin in order to evaluate the role of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in phenytoin absorption. An in situ single pass intestinal perfusion study was carried out to determine the effect of verapamil on the functional status of intestinal P-gp. Phenytoin (30\u03bcM) and propranolol (100\u03bcM) co-perfused with and without verapamil (200\u03bcM) in rat's ileum. An in vivo study, verapamil (25mg/kg, per oral) was administered 2h before phenytoin (30mg/kg, per oral) dosing in male Wistar rats. Plasma samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 and 24h time points from control and treated animals to determine phenytoin concentrations. An in situ single pass intestinal perfusion study indicated phenytoin to be a P-gp substrate and the function of intestinal P-gp was significantly inhibited in presence of verapamil. After per oral phenytoin dosing, the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was found to be 35.03\u00b11.83h\u03bcg/ml which was increased significantly, i.e. 62.33\u00b12.49h\u03bcg/ml (P<0.001) when verapamil was co-administered. Similarly the mean maximum plasma concentration of phenytoin increased from 3.2\u00b10.148\u03bcg/ml without verapamil to 6.983\u00b10.272\u03bcg/ml (P<0.001) with verapamil. These results are quite stimulating for further development of a clinically useful oral formulation of phenytoin based on P-gp inhibition.", 
    "181": "Enhanced adrenergic drive is involved in the development of left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction observed in metabolic syndrome (MS). Thus, \u03b2-blockers might improve LV dysfunction observed in MS, but whether this occurs is unknown.", 
    "182": "We assessed in Zucker fa/fa rats the effects of short- (5 days) and long-term (90 days) metoprolol ('pure' \u03b2-blockade; 80 mg/kg/day) or nebivolol (\u03b2-blocker with vasodilating properties; 5mg/kg/day) treatment on LV hemodynamics and remodeling, as well as the long-term effects on coronary and peripheral endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "183": "At identical degree of \u03b2(1)-receptor blockade, metoprolol and nebivolol decreased heart rate to the same extent and preserved cardiac output via increased stroke volume. None of the \u03b2-blockers, either after long- or short-term administration, modified LV end-systolic pressure-volume relation. Both \u03b2-blockers reduced, after long-term administration, LV end-diastolic pressure, Tau and end-diastolic pressure-volume relation, and this was associated with reduced LV collagen density, but not heart weight. Similar hemodynamic effects were also observed after short-term nebivolol, but not short-term metoprolol. These short-term effects of nebivolol were abolished by NO synthase inhibition. At the vascular level, nebivolol, and to a lesser extend metoprolol, improved NO dependent coronary vasorelaxation, which was abolished by NO synthase inhibition.", 
    "184": "In a model of MS, the \u03b2-blockers metoprolol and nebivolol improve to the same extent LV hemodynamics, remodeling and diastolic function, but nebivolol prevent more markedly endothelium dependent vasorelaxation involving a more marked enhancement of NO bio-availability.", 
    "185": "Obesity-related metabolic abnormalities, including chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) also plays a critical role in obesity-related metabolic disorders and in several types of carcinogenesis. In the present study, we examined the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin-II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB), both of which inhibit the RAS, on the development of azoxymethane (AOM)-initiated colonic premalignant lesions in C57BL/KsJ-db/db (db/db) obese mice. Male db/db mice were given 4 weekly subcutaneous injections of AOM (15 mg/kg body weight), and then, they received drinking water containing captopril (ACE inhibitor, 5mg/kg/day) or telmisartan (ARB, 5mg/kg/day) for 7 weeks. At sacrifice, administration of either captopril or telmisartan significantly reduced the total number of colonic premalignant lesions, i.e., aberrant crypt foci and \u03b2-catenin accumulated crypts, compared to that observed in the control group. The expression levels of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA in the colonic mucosa of AOM-treated db/db mice were decreased by captopril and telmisartan. Captopril lowered the expression levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and PAI-1 mRNAs, while telmisartan lowered the expression levels of COX-2, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and PAI-1 mRNAs in the white adipose tissues of these mice. In addition, these agents significantly reduced the levels of urinary 8-OHdG, a surrogate marker of oxidative damage to DNA, in the experimental mice. These findings suggested that both ACE inhibitor and ARB suppress chemically-induced colon carcinogenesis by attenuating chronic inflammation and reducing oxidative stress in obese mice. Therefore, targeting dysregulation of the RAS might be an effective strategy for chemoprevention of colorectal carcinogenesis in obese individuals.",

An elevated HR in MODS patients is associated with a worse prognosis. Beta-blocker (BB) administration has been shown to reduce mortality in MODS. In most cases, negative inotropic effects prevent administration of BBs in MODS patients. In this trial we investigate, whether the \"funny current\" (I (f)) channel inhibitor ivabradine is able and apt to reduce pathologically elevated HR in MODS patients.

In a small subset of patients with severe aortic disease where the aorta is not suitable for endovascular technique and to provide an arterial inflow, an extra-anatomic renal bypass surgery (EARBS) is an option. Anesthetic management of such procedures has not been described so far in the literature. We retrospectively analyzed the anesthetic techniques used in all patients who underwent EARBS between February 1998 and June 2008 at this institute. We also further analyzed data concerning blood pressure (BP) control and renal function response following surgery as outcome variable measures. A total of 11 patients underwent EARBS during this period. Five received oral clonidine with premedication. During laryngoscopy, esmolol was used in 4 patients, while lignocaine was used in remaining 7 patients. Of 11 patients, 7 showed significant hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation; among these, one had oral clonidine with premedicant, and 6 received lignocaine just before laryngoscopy. Intravenous vasodilators were used to maintain target BP within 20% of baseline during perioperative period. All patients received renal protective measures. During follow-up, 10% were considered cured, 70% had improved BP response, while 20% failed to show improvement in BP response. Renal functions improved in 54.5%, remain unchanged in 36.5%, and worsened in 9% of patients. Use of clonidine during premedication and esmolol before laryngoscopy were beneficial in attenuating hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy, while use of vasodilators to maintain target BP within 20% of baseline, and routine use of renal protective measures appear to be promising in patients undergoing EARBS.",

The management of SAM in the operating room remains controversial. We validate a recently suggested two-step management method and classification of this complication. This was a teaching hospital-based observational study. We validated a novel two-step conservative management method, consisting in intravascular volume expansion and discontinuation of inotropic drugs (step 1), and increasing the afterload by ascending aorta manual compression while administering esmolol e.v. (step 2). We also validate a novel classification of SAM: easy-to-revert (responding to step 1), difficult-to-revert (responding to step 2), or persistent. Fifty patients had an easy-to-revert while 26 had a difficult-to-revert SAM; 4 patients had a persistent condition (promptly diagnosed through our decisional algorithm) and underwent an immediate second pump run to repeat the mitral repair surgery. We confirmed that SAM after a repair of a degenerative MV is common and validated a simple two-step conservative management method that allows to clearly identify those few patients who require immediate surgical revision.",

After \u00df(3)-AR cloning in the late 1980s, convincing evidence for \u00df(3)-AR expression and function in cardiovascular tissues recently initiated a reexamination of their involvement in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases. Their upregulation in diseased cardiovascular tissues and resistance to desensitization suggest they may be attractive therapeutic targets. They may substitute for inoperant \u00df(1/2)-AR to mediate vasodilation in diabetic or atherosclerotic vessels. In cardiac ventricle, their contractile effects are functionally antipathetic to those of \u00df(1/2)-AR; in normal heart, \u00df(3)-ARs may mediate a moderate negative inotropic effect, but in heart failure, it may protect against adverse effects of excessive catecholamine stimulation by action on excitation-contraction coupling, electrophysiology, or remodelling.

Prior studies have shown that the double N-methylated analogue of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) IAPP-GI, which is a conformationally constrained IAPP analogue mimicking a non-amyloidogenic IAPP conformation, is capable of blocking cytotoxic self-assembly of A\u03b2. Here we investigate the interaction of IAPP-GI with A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 using NMR spectroscopy. The most pronounced NMR chemical shift changes were observed for residues 13-20, while residues 7-9, 15-16 as well as the C-terminal half of A\u03b2--that is both regions of the A\u03b2 sequence that are converted into \u03b2-strands in amyloid fibrils--were less accessible to solvent in the presence of IAPP-GI. At the same time, interaction of IAPP-GI with A\u03b2 resulted in a concentration-dependent co-aggregation of A\u03b2 and IAPP-GI that was enhanced for the more aggregation prone A\u03b242 peptide. On the basis of the reduced toxicity of the A\u03b2 peptide in the presence of IAPP-GI, our data are consistent with the suggestion that IAPP-GI redirects A\u03b2 into nontoxic \"off-pathway\" aggregates.",

Ranolazine (0.4, 1.2, 3.6, and 6 mg/kg, intravenous) alone caused transient (<1 minute) and reversible hemodynamic changes. PE (0.3-10 \u03bcg/kg) caused a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure and decrease in HR. ISO (0.01-0.3 \u03bcg/kg) caused a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure and an increase in HR. Ranolazine at high (11-13 mM), but not at moderate (4-5 mM) concentrations partially attenuated changes in mean arterial blood pressure and HR caused by either PE or ISO in normal conscious dogs. However, in dogs treated with hexamethonium (20 mg/kg) to cause autonomic blockade, ranolazine (both 4-5 and 11-13 \u03bcM) significantly attenuated both the PE- and ISO-induced changes in mean arterial blood pressure. The results suggest that a potential antiadrenergic effect of ranolazine was masked by autonomic control mechanisms in conscious dogs but could be observed when these mechanisms were inhibited (eg, in the hexamethonium-treated dog). Ranolazine, at plasma concentrations <10 \u03bcM and in conscious dogs with intact autonomic regulation, had minimal antiadrenergic (\u03b1 and \u03b2) effects.",

    "207": "This article describes the rationale and design of the DECREASE-XIII trial, which aims to evaluate the potential of esmolol infusion, an ultra-short-acting beta-blocker, during surgery as an add-on to chronic low-dose beta-blocker therapy to maintain perioperative haemodynamic stability during major vascular surgery.", 
    "208": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial.", 
    "209": "A total of 260 vascular surgery patients will be randomised to esmolol or placebo as an add-on to standard medical care, including chronic low-dose beta-blockers. Esmolol is titrated to maintain a heart rate within a target window of 60-80 beats per minute for 24 h from the induction of anaesthesia. Heart rate and ischaemia are assessed by continuous 12-lead electrocardiographic monitoring for 72 h, starting 1 day prior to surgery. The primary outcome measure is duration of heart rate outside the target window during infusion of the study drug. Secondary outcome measures will be the efficacy parameters of occurrence of cardiac ischaemia, troponin T release, myocardial infarction and cardiac death within 30 days after surgery and safety parameters such as the occurrence of stroke and hypotension.", 
    "210": "This study will provide data on the efficacy of esmolol titration in chronic beta-blocker users for tight heart-rate control and reduction of ischaemia in patients undergoing vascular surgery as well as data on safety parameters.", 
    "211": "This study provides preliminary data and a framework to facilitate cost comparisons for pharmacologic vs behavioral approaches to headache prophylactic treatment.", 
    "212": "There are few empirical demonstrations of cumulative costs for pharmacologic and behavioral headache treatments, and there are no direct comparisons of short- and long-range (5-year) costs for pharmacologic vs behavioral headache treatments.", 
    "213": "Two separate pilot surveys were distributed to a convenience sample of behavioral specialists and physicians identified from the membership of the American Headache Society. Costs of prototypical regimens for preventive pharmacologic treatment (PPT), clinic-based behavioral treatment (CBBT), minimal contact behavioral treatment (MCBT), and group behavioral treatment were assessed. Each survey addressed total cost accumulated during treatment (ie, intake, professional fees) excluding costs of acute medications. The total costs of preventive headache therapy by type of treatment were then evaluated and compared over time.", 
    "214": "During the initial months of treatment, PPT with inexpensive mediations (<0.75\u2003$/day) represents the least costly regimen and is comparable to MCBT in expense until 6 months. After 6 months, PPT is expected to become more costly, particularly when medication cost exceeds 0.75$ a day. When using an expensive medication (>3\u2003$/day), preventive drug treatment becomes more expensive than CBBT after the first year. Long-term, and within year 1, MCBT was found to be the least costly approach to migraine prevention.", 
    "215": "Through year 1 of treatment, inexpensive prophylactic medications (such as generically available beta-blocker or tricyclic antidepressant medications) and behavioral interventions utilizing limited delivery formats (MCBT) are the least costly of the empirically validated interventions. This analysis suggests that, relative to pharmacologic options, limited format behavioral interventions are cost-competitive in the early phases of treatment and become more cost-efficient as the years of treatment accrue.", 
    "216": "A full-term female infant with severe unilateral microphthalmos and ipsilateral orbital hemangioma in the setting of PHACE syndrome was successfully managed with oral propranolol therapy and subsequent orbital conformer placement. After 3 months of systemic propranolol therapy, the orbital hemangioma had shown significant regression without systemic or local complications. The authors believe this to be the first reported use of systemic propranolol therapy in the management of a hemangioma within a microphthalmic orbit of a patient with PHACE syndrome.", 
    "217": "Complicated infantile hemangiomas require early intervention. With the advent of an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of the condition, and the serendipitous discovery of the effects of propranolol, available treatment options have expanded from the traditional use of steroids. This article reviews the current literature on the treatment of complicated hemangiomas with steroids, interferon, vincristine, bleomycin, and propranolol. The likely mechanism of action, indications, recommended treatment regimes, and complications are discussed.", 
    "218": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of treating infantile hemangioma with the use of oral propranolol. A total of 27 patients with hemangiomas were treated with oral propranolol therapy. The subjects included 21 female patients and 6 male patients whose age ranged between 3 weeks and 7 months. Locations of lesions were as follows: 22 on the face and neck, 3 on the trunk, and 2 on the limbs. The dose of 0.5 mg/kg/d of propranolol was administered; and was gradually doubled to a maximum of 2 mg/kg/d. The treatment lasted for a period of 2.75 to 5.75 months without major complications. Two days later, a change in color was observed in 100% of patients, and 2 weeks later >75% reduction in diameter of the original lesion was found in 25.9% of patients. Treating infantile hemangioma with the use of oral propranolol is effective and reliable.", 
    "219": "The combination of anti-glaucoma eye drops is frequently used in clinical treatment, and it is known that the combination can cause corneal damage. Recently, an anti-glaucoma combination eye drops is developed, and the treatment by the combination eye drops is expected to enhance quality of life. However, effects of the combination eye drops on corneal epithelial cell damage have not been clarified. In this study, we investigated the corneal epithelial cell damage of commercially available anti-glaucoma combination eye drops, such as Xalacom\u00ae (latanoprost/timolol maleate combination eye drops), Duotrav\u00ae (travoprost/timolol maleate combination eye drops) and Cosopt\u00ae (dorzolamide hydrochloride/timolol maleate combination eye drops) using the human corneal epithelial cell (HCE-T). The cytotoxicity in Xalacom\u00ae was higher than that in Xalatan\u00ae (eye drops containing latanoprost) and Timoptol\u00ae (eye drops containing timolol maleate), and the benzalkonium chloride (BAC) and timolol maleate were related to cytotoxicity in Xalacom\u00ae. The cytotoxicity in Duotrav\u00ae and Cosopt\u00ae was lower than that in Timoptol\u00ae. The Duotrav\u00ae is preserved with a non-BAC system (POLYQUAD, polidronium chloride). Therefore, it was suggested that the POLYQUAD related to the low cytotoxicity in Duotrav\u00ae. On the other hand, the D-mannitol reduced the cytotoxicity by BAC in this study. This result suggested that the cytotoxicity in Cosopt\u00ae was reduced by D-mannitol. The Duotrav\u00ae and Cosopt\u00ae may be less damaging to the ocular surface of glaucoma patients receiving long-term eye drop therapy in compared with the combination of anti-glaucoma eye drops.", 
    "220": "We report a case of a 78-year-old woman with cardiac sarcoidosis with a history of syncope and palpitation. Further assessment with echocardiography, gadolinium-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and histology led to a diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis. As the patient suffered from ventricular tachycardia (VT) despite active corticosteroid therapy, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was positioned. She was also administered a beta blocker, but an electrical storm appeared every several days requiring ICD therapy. The drug-refractory VT was finally controlled with a catheter ablation session, during which we could detect the VT focus in the right ventricular outflow tract next to the aneurysm by using an electroanatomic mapping system (CARTO). Referring to echocardiographic and CMR images proved very useful in detecting the aneurysm using the CARTO system.", 
    "221": "There is a significant amount of diversity among heart failure (HF) patients. Contemporary HF regimens often do not take into consideration many of the factors that might influence an individual's response to treatment. Clinical recommendations based on trial data derived from mainly younger Caucasian male study populations have, in most cases, been applied equally to women and African-Americans. Subgroup analyses of randomized HF trials and results of retrospective cohort studies have been used for customizing HF regimens in women and African-Americans. Pharmacogenetics is an emerging strategy for personalizing HF therapy. Genetic biomarkers may play an important role in predicting a patient's response to treatment and in predicting those at risk of toxicity. HF pharmacotherapy has improved over the last two decades; however, substantial work remains in order to personalize HF management and maximize the benefit of pharmacologic interventions, while limiting adverse events.",

    "223": "To study the impact of nebivolol concerning modification of clinical and hemodynamic indicators and parameters of oxidative stress in patients with CHF and with or without concomitant diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2).", 
    "224": "Nebivolol was used in complex therapy of CHF in 82 patients, suffering from NYHA class I - III CHF (EF < 50%) of ischemic genesis with or without comorbid DM2, average age 63.2 +/- 8.2 years.", 
    "225": "After 8 months of therapy significant improvement of clinical status was observed in both groups, tolerance to physical activity increased (significant reduction of average class of CHF in the group with DM2 from 2.5 +/- 0.58 to 2.125 +/- 0.71, p = 0.001, and in the second group from 2.3 +/- 0.5 to 1.9 +/- 0.4, p = 0.01). We also noted in both groups increase of plasma oxidative resistance (reduction of intensity of fast flash in lipid peroxidation h from 7 to 6 mm, p = 0.016, and from 8 to 6 mm, p = 0.03, respectively) and increase of antioxidant plasma protection (increase of SH-groups from 154.19 to 182.4 mmol/1, p = 0.00035, and from 176 to 205, p = 0.004, respectively).", 
    "226": "Nebivolol is a modern neurohormonal modulator, which contributes to reverse evolution of oxidative changes in patients with CHF and hyperglycemia."
