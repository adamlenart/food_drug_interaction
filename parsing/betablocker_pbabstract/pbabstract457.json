    "0": "Transient myocardial ischemia may result from obstruction to flow in the large epicardial coronary arteries or diminished flow reserve due to small vessel disease or left ventricular hypertrophy. In patients with coronary heart disease, calcium blockers have proven to reduce stress induced ischemia in patients with normal left ventricular function and in those with ischemic cardiomyopathy. However, recent studies indicate a need for caution when giving calcium antagonists to patients with postinfarction left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Moreover, calcium antagonists that reduce heart rate (diltiazem) are able as a monotherapy to reduce total ischemic burden. Calcium antagonists that may increase rate (dihydropiridines) have to be combined with beta-blockers to achieve this goal. For 24-h control of ischemia the ischemic threshold should be determined for a differentiated therapy in the individual patient. Is the ischemic threshold of the majority of episodes lower than the exercise threshold, a calcium blocker should work. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are not effective in stress-induced ischemia, but may reduce total ischemic burden, although this effect is not significant. In patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and/or small vessel disease, calcium blockers and ACE inhibitors are probably effective in regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and vascular hypertrophy. However, it remains to be shown that ischemia is reduced by these drugs.", 
    "1": "In a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study, the efficacy of diltiazem controlled-release (CR) 120 mg b.i.d. was compared with metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d. in 56 patients with stable exertional angina pectoris. Fifty-one patients (28 receiving diltiazem CR, 23 receiving metoprolol), completed a follow-up period of 8 weeks. Thirty-nine patients (20 receiving diltiazem CR, 19 receiving metoprolol), completed a follow-up period of 32 weeks. Maximal exercise testing was performed at baseline and after 8, 20, and 32 weeks of treatment. Most exercise parameters were not significantly different between the patients on diltiazem CR and those on metoprolol. However, exercise duration was longer and maximal work load was higher in patients on diltiazem CR than in patients on metoprolol, and significant differences were observed at 20 weeks of treatment (p = 0.006 and p = 0.008, respectively). At all times during treatment, heart rate at maximal exercise and rate-pressure product at maximal exercise were significantly lower in the patients treated with metoprolol. In conclusion, monotherapy with diltiazem CR is at least as effective as monotherapy with metoprolol in patients with stable angina pectoris. As compared to metoprolol, diltiazem CR has a minor depressing effect on rate-pressure product, resulting in a favorable effect on exercise duration.", 
    "2": "Platelet function was investigated in healthy volunteers and patients with essential hypertension by measurement of thresholds for ADP and adrenaline-induced aggregation and plasma concentrations of platelet factor 4 (PF-4) and beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) after administration of antihypertensive drugs. Fibrinolytic activity was investigated by the euglobulin clot lysis time (ECLT) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity. Compared to normotensive controls, patients with essential hypertension showed increased aggregation as evidenced by a decrease in ADP thresholds for ex vivo platelet aggregation. ECLT was significantly prolonged and t-PA significantly lowered, indicating impaired fibrinolytic activity in mild hypertension. In different studies, we have shown that various antihypertensive drug regimens differ in their effects on platelet function and fibrinolytic activity when given to healthy volunteers or patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. In normal volunteers, treatment with the calcium antagonists verapamil, nifedipine, and felodipine lowered plasma concentrations of PF-4 and beta-TG, indicating a reduced platelet activity in vivo. Fibrinolytic activity was not influenced by calcium antagonist treatment in the normal volunteers. Interestingly, however, t-PA increased significantly in the hypertensive group. When compared to placebo or beta 1-selective blockers, propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker without partial agonist activity, reduced ADP and adrenaline threshold values for ex vivo platelet aggregation in hypertensive subjects and impaired fibrinolytic activity in the normal volunteers as well as in the hypertensive groups by increasing ECLT and reducing t-PA. Hypothetically, the effects of antihypertensive drugs on platelet function and fibrinolytic activity could be of importance for their proposed actions on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", 
    "3": "The management of unstable angina continues to undergo rapid evolution as new therapies and techniques become increasingly available to clinicians. It appears that the pathogenesis of unstable angina involves endothelial factors (plaque rupture of fissure resulting in a complex coronary stenotic lesion) together with dynamic factors (including platelet aggregation, thrombosis, and altered coronary vasomotor tone), and therefore it is clear why the approach to the patient with acute coronary syndromes has become multidimensional. This article summarizes the current views of the pathogenesis of unstable angina, and the role that the above factors may play in the clinical syndrome of acute coronary insufficiency. In addition, the newer therapeutic approaches to the pharmacologic management of unstable angina are discussed, including the use of nitrates, heparin, aspirin, and beta-blockers. Increasingly, calcium-channel blockers are being utilized in the early pharmacologic management of unstable angina, particularly because these agents have a salutary effect on reducing increased coronary vasomotor tone, reducing myocardial oxygen demand while at the same time augmenting coronary blood flow, and decreasing platelet aggregation. Numerous small clinical trials have examined the role of intravenous calcium-channel-blocker therapy for the acute management of unstable angina. In particular, intravenous diltiazem appears to be both safe and efficacious in this setting, and may offer some advantages to intravenous nitroglycerin, when used in the Coronary Care Unit setting. Because diltiazem is a heart rate-lowering vasoactive drug, it may attenuate myocardial ischemia without causing reflex tachycardia associated with other vasoactive pharmacologic therapies. Several of these studies utilizing intravenous diltiazem in unstable angina are reviewed and discussed.", 
    "4": "Lacidipine is a calcium antagonist of the dihydropyridine group that is highly selective for vascular tissues. It has been tested during the last few years for the treatment of arterial hypertension. We evaluated the clinical position of this calcium antagonist on the basis of clinical results. From the dose-ranging studies carried out to determine the efficacy of lacidipine, it has been shown that the dose range of 2-6 mg of lacidipine given once daily is effective in reducing blood pressure levels. Lacidipine efficacy (4-6 mg/o.d.) also has been compared with that of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the calcium-antagonist nifedipine, and the beta-blocker atenolol in three different clinical trials according to the same protocol. The results indicated that lacidipine, hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine, and atenolol caused similar reductions both in systolic and diastolic blood pressure after 1 and 2 months of treatment. Similar blood pressure levels were also reached when another antihypertensive agent (atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide) had been added in nonresponders to monotherapy. Heart rate showed a significant decrease only under atenolol treatment, either monotherapy or associated to the previous treatment. In these comparison studies, tolerability was also evaluated. The incidence of side effects during lacidipine treatment was lower than during nifedipine or atenolol treatment, but higher than during hydrochlorothiazide therapy. Lacidipine did not cause any changes in the laboratory parameters evaluated during the 2-month monotherapy period. From a trial conducted in elderly patients, lacidipine 2 and 4 mg/o.d. has been shown to cause similar diastolic blood pressure reduction after 1 month of treatment, the effect being more gradual with the lower dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of lacidipine, a 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, and the beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol were determined alone and in combination in 24 healthy male volunteers. One group (I) of 12 subjects received a single oral dose of 4 mg lacidipine on two separate occasions, which was taken together with a single oral dose of either 160 mg propranolol or placebo; a second group (II) of 12 subjects received propranolol on two occasions, taken with either lacidipine or placebo. Propranolol significantly decreased the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of lacidipine (by 38% and 42%, respectively) whereas lacidipine significantly increased the Cmax and AUC of propranolol (by 35% and 26%, respectively); neither the time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) nor the terminal half-life (t 1/2) were affected. With regard to the pharmacodynamics, in Group I, there was a greater reduction in supine systolic blood pressure (6 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (4 mm Hg) compared to the reduction produced by lacidipine alone, and pulse rate was approximately 5 beats/min less. In Group II, a significantly greater reduction (6 mm Hg) in supine systolic blood pressure compared to the reduction produced by propranolol alone occurred, but there was no marked difference in supine diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate. In conclusion, a modest pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction is evident and should be evaluated further in patients with hypertension.", 
    "6": "We recently found that TGF-beta increases ET-1 secretion in MDCK, a renal tubular cell line. The secretion of ET-1, by a confluent monolayer of MDCK cells grown on a filter, to the basolateral side of the epithelium was two times greater than that to the apical side. However, TGF-beta-increased ET-1 and big ET-1 secretion were exclusively released to the basolateral side. We investigated the mechanism of polarized secretion of ET-1 and big ET-1 in MDCK cells. After 24 h of incubation with 80 pM TGF-beta, basolateral secretion of both ET-1 and big ET-1 increased two to threefold without a significant increase on the apical side. TGF-beta-stimulated ET-1 and big ET-1 secretion in the basolateral bath were inhibited when 10 microM amiloride (Na+ channel blocker) or 1 microM ouabain (Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibitor) was added for 3 h. Polarized secretion of ET-1 and big ET-1 was not affected. In contrast, 10 mM NH4Cl or 0.2 mM chloroquine (both lysosomal function inhibitors) reduced TGF-beta-stimulated ET-1 secretion in the basolateral bath whereas big ET-1 secretion in the apical bath increased two times. Thus, the polarity of big ET-1 secretion was reversed. In addition, the conversion rate from big ET-1 to ET-1 was significantly decreased from 80 to 55% by inhibiting lysosomal function. Prepro-ET-1 mRNAs 3 h after these perturbations were virtually unaltered. Our data show that ET-1 and big ET-1 secretion may be regulated by cell Na+ flux and that lysosomal functions may play some roles in the conversion of big ET-1 to mature ET-1 and in polarized secretion of big ET-1. Translational or posttranslational regulation may play an additional role in ET-1 secretion as well as the mRNA level.", 
    "7": "Perindopril (4 mg) was compared to atenolol (50 mg), captopril (25 mg b.i.d.), or a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg and amiloride 5 mg) in three studies involving a total of 503 hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95-125 mm Hg. A 4-week single-blind placebo period preceded 12 weeks of active treatment. Dose titration was at weeks 4 and 8 if the supine DBP was greater than 90 mm Hg. The dose was doubled and, if necessary, a diuretic was added in atenolol or captopril comparison and atenolol added in the diuretic study. The fall in supine blood pressure (BP) was 27/17 mm Hg with perindopril and 21/16 mm Hg for atenolol. Fifty-five percent on perindopril and 48% on atenolol were controlled on monotherapy, increasing to 78 and 58% with addition of hydrochlorothiazide. Captopril caused a BP fall of 19/12 mm Hg compared to 27/18 mm Hg for perindopril with 49% of both groups being controlled on monotherapy. Diuretic addition produced a greater antihypertensive effect with perindopril 75% compared to 57% of the captopril patients achieving control. Perindopril caused a comparable fall in supine BP to the diuretic combination 27/19 mm Hg and 31/18 mm Hg but the fall in erect systolic BP was significantly greater for the diuretic. At 3 months, 84% of the diuretic and 78% of the perindopril group achieved the target BP. There were no adverse effects on the blood count or blood chemistry with a low incidence of side effects and withdrawals from treatment. These studies show that perindopril compares favorably with the standard antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "8": "1. Effects of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) on ionic currents of dispersed smooth muscle cells of the rabbit portal vein were investigated using the voltage-clamp procedure. 2. ATP (greater than or equal to 300 microM) produced transient and maintained inward currents. The former was inactivated within a few seconds, but the latter lasted more than several minutes. The transient but not the maintained current was blocked by pre-treatment with alpha,beta-methylene adenosine 5'-triphosphate (AMP-CPP). The amplitude of the latter was increased by ATP in a concentration-dependent manner. The following investigations were made on the ionic mechanism of the ATP-induced maintained inward current. 3. In 2.5 mM-Ca(2+)-containing tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl) solution (2.5 mM-Ca(2+)-TEA+ solution), the reversal potential for the ATP-induced inward current was close to the Cl- equilibrium potential, and in 140 mM-Na+ (nominally Ca(2+)-free or 0.3 mM-EGTA-containing) solution, the reversal potential was coincident with the Na+ equilibrium potential. 4. In 2.5 mM-Ca(2+)-TEA+ solution but not in 140 mM-Na+ solution and in physiological salt solution (PSS), niflumic acid (10 microM), a Cl- channel blocker, and Cl(-)-deficient perfusate in the pipette markedly inhibited the ATP-induced inward current. These results imply that in 2.5 mM-Ca(2+)-TEA+ solution the ATP-activated ion channel may admit Ca2+ which then accelerates the Ca(2+)-dependent Cl- current, but in 140 mM-Na+ solution and in PSS this channel may admit only Na+. 5. Intracellular perfusion of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio triphosphate (GTP gamma S) did not provoke the current, but significantly increased the amplitude of the ATP-induced inward current in 2.5 mM-Ca(2+)-TEA+, 140 mM-Na+ and 2.5 mM-Ba(2+)-containing TEA+ (2.5 mM-Ba(2+)-TEA+) solutions. On the other hand, intracellular perfusion of guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S) reduced the amplitude of the ATP-induced inward current in the above solutions. 6. A low concentration of ATP (30 microM) transiently augmented the amplitude of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ current recorded in both 2.5 mM-Ca(2+)-TEA+ solution and PSS, but a high concentration of ATP (3 mM) consistently inhibited the voltage-dependent Ca2+ current in both solutions (4 mM-EGTA in the pipette). Such inhibition was partly prevented by application of 20 mM-EGTA in the pipette.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "9": "Six double-blind studies were designed to assess the efficacy, tolerance, and safety of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Of 1,189 hypertensive patients in these studies, 105 patients were diabetic. They were randomly assigned either to a ramipril monotherapy group (1.25-10 mg/day) or to one of the following treatment groups: ramipril (5 mg/day) plus piretanide (3 mg/day), captopril (100 mg/day), enalapril (10-20 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg/day), or atenolol (100 mg/day). In all studies, a 4-week single-blind placebo run-in phase was followed by a 6-week double-blind active treatment phase. Significant reductions in blood pressure were achieved with all antihypertensive agents. No statistically significant deleterious effects were observed on concentrations of blood glucose, although diabetics who received hydrochlorothiazide showed slight increases in blood glucose levels. Ramipril was well tolerated by diabetic patients, and no serious adverse events occurred. Adverse events reported were typical of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "10": "This trial was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, variable-dose study comparing ramipril with atenolol, and incorporating a 4-week run-in period on placebo. A total of 92 patients suffering from mild to moderate hypertension were randomized to the trial. Following a 4-week run-in period on placebo, newly diagnosed patients were only continued if their blood pressure remained within the defined range throughout the placebo run-in period. Known hypertensive patients who were safely switched to the trial therapy were only continued if their blood pressure was within the defined range at the end of this placebo washout period. An analysis of the data at baseline showed no statistical differences between treatment groups. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced from baseline in each group, but there were no differences between treatments. The study showed that ramipril and atenolol were both successful at reducing and controlling mild-to-moderate hypertension, but it showed no difference between treatments.", 
    "11": "Calcium antagonists can be used with a number of other antihypertensive compounds. The combined use of a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist and beta-blocker is well established and is probably the most efficacious combination for routine use. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may also constitute a suitable addition to calcium antagonist therapy, whereas little benefit appears to be derived from the combined use of a calcium antagonist and a diuretic. Other compounds, e.g., alpha-adrenoceptor blockers, can also be given together with calcium antagonists, although this should be done with great caution because dramatic reductions in blood pressure may result. It is worth noting that in addition to the improved antihypertensive efficacy produced by some of the calcium antagonist combinations, potentially positive metabolic changes may also occur, e.g., a reduction in serum cholesterol, when a calcium antagonist and a beta-blocker are combined.", 
    "12": "To test the tolerance to nitrendipine in arterial hypertension secondary to chronic renal parenchymatous disease, a group of 10 patients so diagnosed and adequately controlled with a diuretic alone or with a beta-blocker were switched to nitrendipine at a dose to insure similarly adequate control of blood pressure. Patients were followed for 1 year at monthly intervals during which blood pressure measurement and the determination of a biochemical profile were performed. During the follow-up, nitrendipine adequately controlled blood pressure and a significant fall was observed in hematocrit (p less than 0.05) and serum uric acid (p less than 0.01) values. Meanwhile, the glomerular filtration rate, determined by the creatinine clearance, did not exhibit significant changes nor did the 24-h urinary excretion of proteins. The tolerance of the drug was adequate, with two patients presenting minimal ankle edema. These results seem to indicate that nitrendipine can be safely used in patients with arterial hypertension secondary to chronic renal parenchymatous disease.", 
    "13": "This study was designed to compare the antihypertensive efficacy of nitrendipine and atenolol in young and middle-aged patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension and to assess treatment effects on plasma lipids and potential changes in left ventricular mass (LVM). After 2 weeks off medication and a 4-week placebo phase, patients who met the inclusion criteria [sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 95 to 114 mm Hg, age below 50 years] entered a 12-week dose-adjustment and maintenance period with nitrendipine or atenolol. Serum lipids were determined before and after therapy. At the same time, LVM was evaluated echocardiographically (M mode). Twenty-two patients completed the double-blind, randomized study. After 12 weeks on nitrendipine, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP were reduced (p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.001, respectively). No significant changes in heart rate were observed. There were no changes in the lipid profile, and LVM was reduced from 93.7 to 23.4 to 82.4 +/- 22.6 g/m2 of body surface (p less than 0.05). On atenolol the SBP and DBP were reduced (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.001, respectively). The expected reduction in heart rate was significant (p less than 0.05). Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol increased by 11% (p less than 0.05) and 12.3% (p less than 0.01), respectively. HDL cholesterol showed a small reduction. Tryglycerides increased by 22% (n.s.). LVM did not change. In conclusion, nitrendipine and atenolol showed comparable antihypertensive efficacy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "In an attempt to improve survival of patients with coronary artery disease and high-grade ventricular ectopic activity, several studies using different antiarrhythmic drugs were undertaken. A meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials using type I antiarrhythmic agents showed that the treatment effect was much more likely to be adverse than beneficial. In contrast to these studies, the pooled results of major secondary prevention trials using beta-blocking agents could demonstrate a significant reduction in the sudden death rate by an average of 24% during observation periods of 9-36 months. In the beta-blocker trials, however, patients with contraindications for this type of drug, such as overt congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive lung disease, were excluded. In these patients a type III antiarrhythmic drug, such as amiodarone, may have a place, and in fact, the Basel Antiarrhythmic Study of Infarct Survival, a prospective, controlled, randomized trial using low-dose amiodarone as an antiarrhythmic agent, could demonstrate a 60% reduction in sudden death rate and a 74% reduction in arrhythmic events incidence during the first year after myocardial infarction. Therefore, in patients with repetitive ventricular ectopic activity after myocardial infarction and adequate left ventricular function, a therapeutic attempt with beta-blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity seems advisable. Beside beta-adrenergic blockade, low-dose amiodarone is an alternative, especially in patients with impaired left ventricular function or other contraindications for beta-blockers.", 
    "15": "Propafenone, like encainide and flecainide, is an antiarrhythmic drug characterized by slow kinetics of interaction with cardiac sodium channels. In addition, it shares structural similarities with propranolol and has been shown to exert consistent beta-blocking action in vitro. On the other hand, the extent of beta-blockade noted after oral administration of propafenone in vivo has been reported to range from undetectable to clinically significant. Although the explanation for this discrepancy was initially unclear, recent work has convincingly demonstrated that the degree of beta-blockade during propafenone therapy reflects genetically determined variations in the metabolism of the parent drug, which has greater beta-blocking potency than do its metabolites. At lower dosages, beta-blockade is significantly greater and more likely to be clinically noticeable in the small percentage of patients who have poor metabolism and in whom deficient 5-hydroxylation is associated with higher plasma propafenone concentrations. Because this metabolic pathway is saturable, at the usual highest clinical dosage (900 mg/24 h) plasma propafenone concentration rises disproportionately in patients with normal 5-hydroxylation, and more comparable degrees of beta-blockade are noted in both metabolizer types. Beta-blockade during propafenone therapy, which can contribute both to the genesis of side effects and to the suppression of arrhythmias, is a potentially important drug effect that can largely be predicted by genetic variations in the metabolism of the drug.", 
    "16": "Atrial premature beats seldom require an antiarrhythmic treatment; reassurance and suppression of coffee, alcohol, and tobacco generally suffice. Acute atrial fibrillation is best treated by electrical cardioversion if it induces acute cardiovascular decompensation. If it is not poorly tolerated, the arrhythmia may be treated with digitalis at doses sufficient to keep the ventricular response rate at 70-90/min. This therapy may restore sinus rhythm, but conversion to sinus rhythm often requires the combined use of digitalis with a beta-blocker or class I antiarrhythmic drug (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide, propafenone, or flecainide). Digitalis must be avoided in the presence of a preexcitation, and class IA agents, which facilitate atrioventricular (AV) nodal transport, must never be used without digitalis. Chemical cardioversion may also be achieved by i.v. amiodarone. Long-term prevention of recurrences after cardioversion or in the presence of recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation requires digitalis combined with a class I agent, or a beta-blocker, preferably sotalol. Amiodarone is also very efficacious. Special mention should be made of atrial fibrillations of vagal or sympathetic origin, which are best treated by amiodarone, or beta-blockade (nadolol), respectively. In the presence of chronic established atrial fibrillation, digitalis in combination with a beta-blocking agent or a calcium antagonist, such as verapamil or diltiazem, may be useful to slow the ventricular response rate. If successful control cannot be obtained, catheter ablation of the AV node with implantation of a rate-responsive pacemaker must be contemplated. The therapeutic approach in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, whether or not associated, is similar to atrial flutter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "The preventive effects of long-term treatment with arotinolol on the development of cerebral stroke were examined in SHRSP fed a high salt diet. Arotinolol (4.87 mg/kg per day for 20 weeks) prevented cerebral lesions, reduced signs of stroke and delayed early mortality but did not alter blood pressure from control SHRSP, when the administration of the drug was started before the onset of hypertension. At dosage levels similar to arotinolol, both pindolol and labetalol were less effective in preventing cerebral lesions despite lower blood pressure. Propranolol produced no detectable effect on blood pressure or frequency of cerebral lesions. Furthermore, arotinolol (4.27 mg/kg per day) markedly inhibited the development of stroke without blood pressure reduction, when the administration was started after the onset of severe hypertension. These results suggest that arotinolol is more effective in preventing cerebral stroke than pindolol, labetalol and propranolol, and that factors other than blood pressure reduction may be involved in this preventive effect.",

BAY K 8644 at concentrations of 10(-10)-10(-6) M had a stimulant effect on the spontaneous electrical and contractile activity of smooth muscle preparations from cat and guinea pig stomach. 2. Nifedipine (10(-6) M) antagonized the BAY K 8644-induced spike potentials and the related phasic contractions. 3. Neither the excitatory nor the inhibitory effect of BAY K 8644 was significantly influenced by atropine (10(-7) M), phentolamine (10(-7) M), propranolol (10(-7) M) or TTX (10(-6) M). 4. TEA (10(-3) M) abolished the inhibitory effect of BAY K 8644 on the spike generation and increased the amplitude of the phasic contractions.", 
    "19": "The effects of iloprost, prazosin and propranolol were tested on ouabain-induced arrhythmia in guinea-pigs. Each drug used alone showed an antiarrhythmic effect. In a second step, iloprost was given in combination with drugs blocking alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. Propranolol and iloprost caused a statistically significant and comparable increase of the threshold dose of ouabain for the onset of arrhythmia (OA), the occurrence of premature ventricular beats (PVB), ventricular flutter (VF) and ventricular fibrillation (FIB). The effect of a combination of iloprost and propranolol was comparable to the effect of each drug administered alone. Prazosin enhanced the threshold dose of ouabain for OA and PVB in a statistically significant manner. The effect of a combination of iloprost and prazosin was nearly the same for OA and PVB compared to the single effect of these drugs. The threshold dose of ouabain was decreased for VF and FIB when a combination of iloprost and prazosin was given, compared to iloprost used alone. These results support the assumption that the adrenergic nervous system is involved in the antiarrhythmic effect of iloprost.", 
    "20": "The relative importance of hypertension as a risk factor for peripheral vascular disease is of the same order as coronary artery disease. The design of drug studies in occlusive vascular disease presents several problems. First, investigations must be placebo-controlled and crossover in design. Second, since these patients are very much at risk from other vascular occlusions, length of treatment phase is critical. Third, drug doses are also critical--probably best chosen by titration to similar antihypertensive effect. Fourth, patients must be trained in treadmill procedure. Fifth, measurements of limb blood flow must be accompanied where possible by \"functional\" assessment, e.g., claudication distance. With respect to the specific problem of low perfusion pressure distal to the blockage of peripheral vasculature, resting blood flow may remain normal, implying compensatory reduction in tone of arteriolar resistance vessels. Thus, regional circulation distal to blockage is sensitive to changes in perfusion pressure. There is the risk of \"steal\" with vasodilator agents; however, conflict exists in the literature over effects of beta-blockers in this situation. In view of its peripheral hemodynamic profile, the theoretical possibilities with the beta-blocker/vasodilator carvedilol in patients with hypertension and peripheral vascular disease seem extremely rewarding, but remain to be borne out in practice.", 
    "21": "In an open clinical study, the efficacy and safety of carvedilol was investigated in 26 severely hypertensive patients controlled inadequately on a diuretic [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 120 mm Hg at first visit and greater than 110 mm Hg following more than 1 week administration of a diuretic]. Following diuretic treatment all patients were initially administered 5 mg of carvedilol once daily. The dose was gradually increased to 10 mg and 20 mg until DBP was reduced below 100 mm Hg or until it was reduced by at least 10 mm Hg. Antihypertensive activity of carvedilol (5 mg) was sufficient in only three cases, but after 4 weeks (inpatients) or 8 weeks (outpatients) administration of carvedilol (10 mg or 20 mg), DBP/systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced from 176 +/- 6/117 +/- 3 to 145 +/- 3/94 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) in all patients. Overall, a sufficient antihypertensive effect was observed in 80% of the patients. Heart rate was significantly decreased from 76 +/- 2 to 67 +/- 2 beats/min, but no patient experienced bradycardia. Carvedilol was generally well tolerated. These findings suggest that 10-20 mg of carvedilol once daily, in combination with a diuretic, is an effective and safe treatment for patients with severe hypertension.", 
    "22": "The efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of carvedilol were investigated in an open trial performed on six patients with hypertension and chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis. The plasma level of unchanged carvedilol after a single dose of 10 mg reached a peak 1-5 h after administration both on days with and without hemodialysis. The drug was gradually metabolized thereafter and had almost disappeared from the plasma after 24 h. Blood pressure was lowered by carvedilol both on days with and without hemodialysis. No carvedilol passed through the dialysis membrane. During the 4-week administration period of carvedilol at 10 mg/day, assessment of plasma samples taken just prior to early morning administration demonstrated no drug accumulation. Blood pressure was well controlled during the administration period. Tolerance to the antihypertensive effect was not observed. Heart rate was not significantly changed at any time. There were no side effects in any of the patients during the trial, and laboratory parameters remained unchanged. These results indicate that carvedilol is a safe and effective antihypertensive agent for use in patients on chronic hemodialysis.", 
    "23": "As in any patient with hypertension, the first goal in the hypertensive patient with renal disease is to control the hypertension. The second goal is to reduce overall cardiovascular risk, which includes an increased likelihood of coronary events. The third goal is to minimize the likelihood that renal disease will progress, or minimize the rate of progression. There is substantial evidence to indicate that control of hypertension, however achieved, will slow the rate of progression of renal injury and destruction. Studies in animal models have indicated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are more consistent in preventing progressive renal injury, and perhaps have a more sustained action than standard agents employed hitherto. In the patient with a clear indication for beta-adrenergic blockade, such as a prior coronary event or angina pectoris, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent should be employed. Preliminary, but intriguing, evidence is available to suggest that a beta-adrenergic blocking agent that incorporates a vasodilator action may enjoy special benefits in terms of achieving the three goals. In the case of renal injury, completion of the studies required to prove this point will improve our ability to deal with the problem of hypertension in the patient with renal disease.", 
    "24": "The efficacy and safety of carvedilol, a beta-blocker with vasodilatory properties, were compared with that of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) both at a once-daily dose of 25-50 mg in a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter study. Following a single-blind placebo phase of 3-6 weeks, 201 eligible patients (aged 27-88 years) were randomized to receive 8 weeks of treatment with either carvedilol or HCTZ, 25 mg doubling to 50 mg at week 4 if the respone was inadequate. Sitting and standing blood pressure and heart rate were recorded 2 h after the first dose and 24 h postdose at weeks 4 and 8. The analysis included 179 patients (11 having withdrawn, including 5 for adverse events, and 11 excluded for protocol violations). There were no statistically or clinically significant differences between treatment groups. Eighty-six percent of patients in the carvedilol group and 88% in the HCTZ group had an 8-week sitting diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mm Hg or decreased by greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg. Safety profiles were similar for both agents, with a tendency to lower uric acid and total cholesterol levels with carvedilol. Carvedilol and HCTZ at doses compared in this study have similar efficacy and tolerability, with laboratory evidence to suggest a more favorable metabolic profile for carvedilol.", 
    "25": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of carvedilol on serum lipids in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Twenty-one patients with blood pressure greater than or equal to 160/95 mm Hg after a 4-week placebo run-in period were initially given 10 mg of carvedilol once daily. The dose was increased to 20 mg after 4 weeks if the target blood pressure was not achieved. The duration of treatment was 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of administration, blood pressure and the pulse rate (PR) declined significantly (blood pressure from 173/105 to 142/91 mm Hg, p less than 0.001; PR from 74 to 67 beats/min, p less than 0.001); however, serum lipids [total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), HDL2, and HDL3], lipoprotein fraction (alpha, pre-beta, and beta), apoprotein fraction (A-I, A-II, CII, CIII, and E), and atherogenic index [(total cholesterol - HDL cholesterol) divided by HDL cholesterol] were not altered significantly. There were no side effects reported during the trial. From these results, it can be concluded that carvedilol has no adverse effect on the coronary risk profile as reflected by lipid measurements, and is an efficacious, safe, well-tolerated antihypertensive drug in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.", 
    "26": "The coexistence of the syndromes of essential hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) poses a major but common therapeutic challenge. High blood pressure is one of the most potent risk factors for the early development of CAD. Conversely, the presence of CAD significantly worsens the predictive prognosis associated with high blood pressure. Moreover, metabolic risk factors for the acceleration of both syndromes are similar, particularly with regard to abnormalities of the blood lipid profile, carbohydrate intolerance, and obesity. It is clinically crucial, therefore, to direct drug therapy not only at the immediate alleviation of the symptoms and signs of each syndrome but also to control the cardiac and vascular risk factors common to both syndromes. Carvedilol is a third-generation vasodilating beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with advantageous ancillary pharmacologic properties for the treatment of the patient with high blood pressure complicated by CAD. The immediate advantages of the drug in the treatment of both syndromes are distinct. In the patient with high blood pressure, carvedilol controls the pressure throughout the 24 h of the day and suppresses the increase associated with exercise. In the patient with CAD, the drug is efficacious in relieving anginal pain and electrocardiographic signs of myocardial ischemia. By reducing blood pressure and heart rate and retarding their increases during exercise, the drug exhibits a potent ability to reduce left ventricular work, wall stress, myocardial oxygen consumption, and left ventricular myocardial ischemia. In the patient in whom both syndromes coexist, carvedilol affords a remedy for both.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "Carvedilol is a novel treatment for hypertension, having a balanced pharmacology of vasodilation and beta-receptor blockade. We present here the results of a three-way, multicenter, comparative study on the use of carvedilol, slow-release nifedipine, and atenolol in the management of essential hypertension. A total of 311 patients was entered into the study, of which 293 were randomized to one of the three treatment regimens. Full data are available on 255 patients. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements, in both sitting and standing positions, were taken, together with the heart rate. There was no consistently significant difference between treatments with respect to blood pressure control. Differences in heart rate were more pronounced, with the reduction due to carvedilol being generally intermediate between nifedipine and atenolol. Further studies of carvedilol in hypertension, as well as other indications, are warranted.", 
    "28": "The effects of the two beta-blockers carvedilol and propranolol and the calcium antagonist verapamil on platelet aggregation induced by ADP, epinephrine, or collagen was examined in the serum of eight healthy volunteers. The inhibitory potential of the three drugs on the arachidonic acid-prostaglandin pathway was measured by the assessment of the formation of the stable metabolite thromboxane B2. Furthermore, the influence of drugs on intracellular cAMP levels was measured in platelets aggregated with ADP, epinephrine, or collagen. All three drugs were able to inhibit platelet aggregation induced by a threshold concentration of ADP, epinephrine (10 microM), or collagen (1 micrograms/ml) in a concentration-dependent manner, preventing aggregation completely in the high micromolar range. Propranolol is 1.6 and 2.3 times more active than verapamil and carvedilol in inhibiting ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Although the two beta-blockers were marginally more potent than verapamil in inhibiting platelet aggregation induced by collagen, this was not statistically significant. Both propranolol and verapamil were slightly more active than carvedilol in inhibiting epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation, a trend consistent with the IC50 values. Intracellular cAMP levels decreased in platelets aggregated with ADP, epinephrine, and collagen. The inhibition of platelet aggregation with the three drugs resulted in a return of intracellular cAMP levels to basal values. Carvedilol and propranolol were of similar potency and around 1.5-3 times as potent as verapamil for all agonists. The formation of thromboxane B2, an end product of the arachidonic acid pathway, could be completely inhibited by the three drugs. Propranolol was 2.4 and 2.1 times more potent than carvedilol and verapamil when platelets were aggregated with ADP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "The objective of the present experiment was to investigate the following parameters concerning carvedilol: (a) the time course of acute hypotensive effect, (b) the influence of alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade on the acute hypotension induced by carvedilol, and (c) the effect of carvedilol on myocardial ischemia. In conscious, catheter-implanted spontaneously hypertensive rats, carvedilol at the doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg, p.o., dose-dependently decreased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). At 10 mg/kg, MAP was significantly decreased for 16 h, and at 30 mg/kg, it was significantly decreased until 24 h after administration. Thus, carvedilol shows long-lasting antihypertensive effects by a single oral administration. In anesthetized Wistar rats, intravenous administration of carvedilol (0.3 mg/kg) produced an immediate decrease in blood pressure. On the other hand, in phentolamine-pretreated rats whose blood pressure was restored by prostaglandin F2 alpha, the acute hypotension produced by carvedilol was abolished similarly to the case with labetalol (0.6 mg/kg) and prazosin (0.01 mg/kg). The hypotensive effect of either hydralazine (0.2 mg/kg) or nitroprusside Na (0.005 mg/kg) was attenuated by about 20%, whereas the effect of diltiazem (0.2 mg/kg) was not attenuated. These results indicate that alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking action of carvedilol contributes to a large extent to the acute hypotensive effect of this drug. In anesthetized open-chest dogs, myocardial ischemia was produced by partial occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Myocardial pH of the ischemic region was decreased by about 0.7 units. Carvedilol at the doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, i.v., dose-dependently attenuated the decrease in myocardial pH accompanied with decreases in MAP and heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "30": "Many patients with systemic hypertension also have concomitant angina pectoris. Hypertension is a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease as well as an aggravating factor once symptomatic ischemic heart disease develops. It would be prudent to use one agent that reduced the elevated blood pressure and relieved anginal symptoms while providing no negative affects on hemodynamics or other cardiac risk factors. beta-Adrenergic blockers (traditional agents and newer compounds with ancillary properties) and calcium-entry blockers have been shown to be effective as monotherapies in patients with angina. They also have the ability to induce left ventricular hypertrophy regression. There is some evidence that some of these therapies may arrest the development of arteriosclerosis and may have an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. What remains controversial is the optimal amount of blood pressure reduction in patients with hypertension coexistent with angina, or whether one specific agent or drug class would have an overall advantage in reducing the risk of morbidity or mortality.", 
    "31": "Recent studies have shown that beta-blockers may be effective in the management of heart failure. However, negative inotropic effects of these agents may offset the beneficial properties of up-regulation of the beta-receptors and reduction in myocardial oxygen demand. Carvedilol is a new drug which possesses a balanced combination of vasodilatation and beta-blockade. Previous studies have shown that carvedilol may have beneficial effects on left ventricular function in patients with ischemic heart disease. We have performed a preliminary study to address the safety and acute effects of intravenous carvedilol in 17 patients with chronic congestive heart failure secondary to ischemic heart disease. Acute hemodynamic changes were monitored by right heart catheterization and arterial cannulation. Ejection fraction was also monitored by radionuclide ventriculography. Significant reductions in heart rate (79 +/- 14 to 72 +/- 12 beats/min, p less than 0.001) systolic and diastolic blood pressure (137 +/- 20/72 +/- 8 to 119 +/- 19/66 +/- 8 mm Hg, p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01), systemic vascular resistance (1766 +/- 367 to 1518 +/- 377 dynes/s/cm-5/m2, p less than 0.001) and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (20 +/- 8 to 15 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) were observed. Ejection fraction increased significantly from 24 to 28% (p less than 0.001) but there was little change in cardiac index or stroke volume index. The peak changes occurred at 10 min and the effect on pulmonary wedge pressure was maintained up to 30 min. No adverse effects were noted. The improvements in left ventricular filling pressure and systolic function, and the reduction in sympathetic activity may combine to produce an important therapeutic advantage in congestive heart failure. Further studies with this interesting agent are recommended.", 
    "32": "This was a double-blind multicenter study to compare the efficacy, tolerability and effects on the quality of life with isradipine and atenolol in the treatment of essential hypertension. Of 588 patients entering the 6-week placebo run-in period, 549 were eligible for randomization to receive either isradipine or atenolol for 8 weeks. If, at the end of this period, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) remained greater than 90 mm Hg, then both agents were given in combination for a further 10 weeks. Tolerability and quality of life were assessed repeatedly during the placebo and active-treatment phases. A subgroup of 30 patients were followed by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and their results are now being analyzed. In another subgroup of 26 patients, maximum exercise capacity, as determined by ergometer bicycle-testing, was measured once during placebo and twice during active treatment. At the end of the 24-week study period, both isradipine and atenolol as monotherapy had produced significant decreases in blood pressure. There were no significant differences overall between the compounds in quality-of-life and side-effect profiles, although there was a relative absence of ankle edema and headache with isradipine. Furthermore, patients receiving isradipine had no change in performance on exercise testing whereas patients on atenolol had a significant decrease (p less than 0.01).", 
    "33": "This was a comparison of the effects of isradipine and metoprolol on sleep apnea syndrome in 12 hypertensive men who were habitual snorers. Each patient received double-blind isradipine 1.25-2.5 mg twice daily or metoprolol 50-100 mg twice daily after a 4-week placebo period. Static charge-sensitive bed examination was performed during the placebo period and 5-7 weeks after starting treatment. The number of obstructive breathing patterns was increased by metoprolol in five patients, remained the same with isradipine in four, and was decreased by metoprolol in one patient and by isradipine in two. Obstructive patterns increased in the metoprolol group from 24 +/- 26% to 32 +/- 31% and decreased in the isradipine group from 21 +/- 23% to 19 +/- 25% (p less than 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). Neither drug had a significant effect on blood pressure values. There was no significant difference in oxygen desaturation or in the amount of quiet sleep in either treatment group. On the basis of these results, it would appear that isradipine is more suitable than metoprolol for the treatment of hypertension in patients who are habitual snorers.", 
    "34": "Fibrinolytic activity was measured in a 14-day placebo-controlled study of propranolol and the calcium antagonist isradipine in 20 mildly hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressure 95-115 mm Hg) compared with 24 healthy volunteers. The parameters under study included euglobulin clot-lysis time, and tissue-plasminogen activator activity and its inhibitor (PAI). The two drugs exerted equal antihypertensive effects in the patients who had raised blood pressure, but had markedly different actions on the fibrinolytic system. Propranolol substantially reduced the fibrinolytic activity in both the hypertensive and healthy control groups. Isradipine, on the other hand, had no effect on fibrinolytic activity in the controls, but augmented the activity in the hypertensive subjects. The possible mechanisms for the different actions of the two agents may be related to the vascular endothelium.", 
    "35": "The high risk of subsequent mortality and morbidity following the occurrence of a myocardial infarction (MI) underlies the importance of instituting effective preventive regimens as part of the overall management of these patients. The aim of such treatment is to prolong survival by preventing sudden and non-sudden death and further major cardiovascular events. Currently available data from randomised, controlled clinical trials in MI patients indicate that early treatment with thrombolytic agents [streptokinase, anisolyated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC) or recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA)] in the first few hours after onset of symptoms significantly reduces the short term mortality following MI, with follow-up studies at 1 year indicating that the early benefits persist long term. The optimum time for initiation of thrombolytic therapy is within 6 hours of onset, but treatment started between 7 and 24 hours after onset can also be beneficial. Similarly, there is good evidence that beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol, timolol, metoprolol, atenolol) and aspirin are effective in reducing both the mortality and reinfarction rate following MI. With beta-blockers, a policy of starting treatment early intravenously and continuing orally for 2 to 3 years seems likely to save more lives than either strategy alone; however, contraindications to beta-blockade reduce the number of patients eligible to receive this treatment. In the case of aspirin, the optimum dosage has yet to be determined, but on the basis of present evidence, it seems reasonable to start treatment early with doses of 160 to 325 mg daily and continue for a year or 2 after recovery. Other studies have shown that long term oral anticoagulant therapy is also effective in reducing the mortality and reinfarction rate after MI. Subcutaneous heparin therapy given for 10 days in patients with acute anterior MI reduces the frequency of left ventricular mural thrombosis, while intravenous heparin given for greater than or equal to 4 days improves coronary artery patency rates following administration of a thrombolytic agent. In a comparison with low dose aspirin, intravenous heparin proved more effective in maintaining coronary artery patency rates after rt-PA thrombolysis. There is also evidence that oral nitrates may reduce mortality in MI patients, especially in those with heart failure. However, current data on the use of antiarrhythmic drugs do not support the routine of these drugs following MI. Similarly, with lipid-lowering agents, the evidence that lowering cholesterol is beneficial in reducing mortality after MI is at present inconclusive. Further studies with these groups of drugs are awaited with interest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "36": "Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) differs from Q-wave MI in 3 important respects: a smaller infarct size, possibly due to early reperfusion resulting from spontaneous thrombolysis, relief of spasm, or both; more frequency patency of the infarct-related artery; and a larger residual mass of viable but jeopardized myocardium within the perfusion zone of the infarct-related vessel. Left ventricular function is generally better unless impaired by previous MI. After the acute phase, the prognosis is worse when residual ischaemia is present, and reinfarction rates during hospitalisation and in the subsequent year of follow-up are higher. As myocardial ischaemia is potentially reversible, its presence should be actively sought in all patients with recognised non-Q-wave MI. On the basis of current knowledge and available data, the following guidelines for the management of non-Q-wave MI patients can be recommended: (1) diltiazem and aspirin should be administered to all patients as soon as the diagnosis is established, unless contraindications exist; (2) patients who develop early recurrent ischaemia on therapy (i.e. angina with associated ST-T-wave changes) should undergo prompt cardiac catheterisation and myocardial revascularisation; and (3) patients with entirely uncomplicated hospital histories who are asymptomatic should undergo exercise stress testing, preferably in conjunction with 201Tl perfusion scintigraphy, before hospital discharge. Only those patients with evidence of significant residual ischaemia need cardiac catheterisation and myocardial revascularisation.", 
    "37": "Both beta-adrenergic (isoproterenol) and cholinergic (carbachol) sialagogues increase amylase secretion, ornithine decarboxylase activity and DNA synthesis in murine parotid gland in vivo and in vitro. These agonists enhanced the incorporation of labelled inorganic orthophosphate into parotid proteins in rat parotid explants cultured on siliconized lens paper floating on serum-free 199 medium. Analysis of the labelled proteins by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography revealed that isoproterenol enhanced the phosphorylation of four proteins with apparent molecular weights of 17, 20, 31 and 32 kDa and carbachol stimulated the phosphorylation of 31 and 32 K proteins. Isoproterenol-dependent ornithine decarboxylase induction and phosphorylation of the proteins were selectively suppressed by monensin but not by polymyxin B, whereas carbachol-dependent ornithine decarboxylase induction and protein phosphorylation were inhibited by polymyxin B but not by monensin. Neither monensin nor polymyxin B suppressed isoproterenol- or carbachol-stimulated amylase secretion. Time course experiments showed that sialagogue-stimulated protein phosphorylation preceded the increase of ornithine decarboxylase activity and had almost disappeared when it was maximal. Propranolol and atropine, antagonists of isoproterenol and carbachol, respectively, completely inhibited not only amylase secretion and ornithine decarboxylase induction but also protein phosphorylation stimulated by the corresponding agonists. These findings suggest that increased phosphorylation of specific proteins is associated with sialagogue-stimulated ornithine decarboxylase induction but not amylase secretion.", 
    "38": "Chronic arterial hypertension (HT) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) increase the morbidity and mortality of acute myocardial infarction in patients. In this article, we discuss earlier studies from Koyanagi et al. in our laboratory that showed that when animals with chronic HT and LVH (HT-LVH) were subjected to acute coronary artery occlusion (CAO), there was a 3.5-fold increase in mortality and a 35% increase in infarct size expressed as a percent of the area at risk. We subsequently determined the effect of HT-LVH on the wavefront of myocardial infarction. Dogs were made hypertensive using a single-kidney, single-clip model of renovascular hypertension that produced mean arterial blood pressure (BP) = 141 +/- 3 mm Hg and left ventricular:body weight = 5.8 +/- 0.1 g/kg (p less than 0.05 vs. control animals). Conscious animals with HT-LVH and control animals were subjected to 1 or 3 h of CAO. Infarct and risk areas were measured using triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) stain and barium angiography, respectively. The results suggested that the wavefront of infarction was accelerated in animals with HT-LVH. Further studies suggested that the wavefront of myocardial infarction could be markedly retarded by normalizing blood pressure (nitroprusside) 1 h following CAO. Recent studies in an animal model of HT-LVH suggested that electrophysiological abnormalities occur when these animals were subjected to CAO. Sixty-five percent of animals with HT-LVH had sudden death during CAO compared to 27% of the control group. We studied whether chronic beta-adrenergic blockade would reduce mortality associated with CAO in animals with HT-LVH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "Extracellular recordings were made from serotonergic neurons of the rat dorsal raphe nucleus in a slice preparation. In the presence of phenylephrine (3 microM) to restore the pacemaker activity of otherwise silent serotonergic neurons, superfusion with the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A agonist ipsapirone depressed the firing of these neurons with an IC50 of approximately 50 nM. Complete inhibition was achieved with 100-300 nM of the drug. Concomitant superfusion with the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A antagonists spiperone (100 nM) or propranolol (10 microM) markedly reduced the inhibitory effect of ipsapirone (100 nM). Superfusion with K+ channel blockers such as apamin (50-100 nM), charybdotoxin (100 nM) or Ba2+ (1 mM) did not induce any changes in the electrical activity of serotonergic neurons. However, 4-aminopyridine (0.1-1 mM) disrupted the regularity of their discharge without affecting the mean firing rate. The ipsapirone-induced inhibition was unchanged by apamin and charybdotoxin, but was markedly reduced by Ba2+ and 4-aminopyridine. Thus the IC50 of ipsapirone was shifted to approximately 150 nM in the presence of 1 mM of 4-aminopyridine. These results indicate that, in serotonergic neurons within the dorsal raphe nucleus, the K+ channel opened through the stimulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine1A autoreceptors is 4-aminopyridine-sensitive.",

The high levels were inherited in three intercrosses in a dominant fashion. The results of the backcross breeding suggested diallelic inheritance. However, the polygenic effect was not ruled out.", 
    "41": "We evaluated the degree of inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), principally by cilazapril, by assessing the blood pressure response to a continuous infusion of increasing doses of angiotensin I, and assessed the possible pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between cilazapril and propranolol in healthy volunteers and patients with mild to severe essential hypertension. The specificity of the angiotensin I infusion method was verified when a single dose of cilazapril 30mg antagonised the increase in diastolic blood pressure induced by angiotensin I but did not influence the response to angiotensin II. Using this method, we showed that single oral doses of cilazapril 4 mg, captopril 25 mg and enalapril 10mg shifted the angiotensin I dose-effect curve to the right and determined a pharmacological half-life of about 4 hours for cilazapril. Increasing single oral doses (1.25, 3.75, 10 and 30mg) of cilazapril reduced diastolic blood pressure dose-dependently and shifted the angiotensin I dose-response curves to the right. The dose representing 50% inhibition of ACE activity (apparent Ki-dose) was about 0.6mg, 3 hours after cilazapril administration. Cilazapril and propranolol did not exhibit any clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction in healthy volunteers; each drug reduced diastolic and systolic blood pressure by about 7 mm Hg, and this was doubled by the combination. Cilazapril had no significant effect on heart rate, in patients with essential hypertension whereas both propranolol and the combination of cilazapril and propranolol reduced it. Monotherapy with each drug reduced blood pressure, and combined administration enhanced the antihypertensive effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Cordarone, ethacizine, and obsidan were found to reduce the total number of premature ventricular contractions by 90% or more within an hour after their single intravenous injection in 80, 100, and 50% of the patients, respectively.", 
    "43": "Three tachykinin receptor types, termed NK1, NK2, and NK3, can be distinguished by the relative potency of various peptides in eliciting tissue responses. Airway macromolecular secretion is stimulated by the tachykinin substance P (SP). The purposes of this study were to determine the tachykinin receptor subtype responsible for this stimulation, and to examine the possible involvement of other neurotransmitters in mediating this effect. Ferret tracheal explants maintained in organ culture were labeled with 3H-glucosamine, a precursor of high molecular weight glycoconjugates (HMWG) which are released by airway secretory cells. Secretion of labeled HMWG then was determined in the absence and presence of the tachykinins SP, neurokinin A (NKA), neurokinin B (NKB), physalaemin (PHY), and eledoisin (ELE). All the tachykinins tested stimulated HMWG release to an approximately equal degree. Stimulation was concentration-related, with log concentrations giving half-maximal effects (EC50) as follows: SP -9.47, NKA -7.37, NKB -5.98, PHY -8.08, and ELE -7.68. This rank order of potency (SP greater than PHY greater than or equal to ELE greater than or equal to NKA greater than NKB) is most consistent with NK1 receptors. To evaluate the possible contribution of other mediators, tachykinin stimulation was examined in the presence of several receptor blockers. The potency of SP was not diminished by pretreatment with atropine, propranolol, or chlorpheniramine, and atropine actually increased the magnitude of the secretory response. The SP receptor antagonist [D-Arg1,D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9, Leu11]-SP blocked SP-induced secretion. These findings indicate that SP is a potent stimulus of airway macromolecular secretion. This effect occurs through the action of NK1 receptors, and is not dependent upon cholinergic, beta-adrenergic, or H-1 histamine receptors. The facilitation by atropine of SP stimulation suggests the existence of a mechanism of cholinergic inhibition of SP-induced stimulation.", 
    "44": "The effects of E4031, a new class III antiarrhythmic agent similar to sotalol, were tested in isometrically contracting rabbit papillary muscles and in anesthetized, open-chest dogs. In papillary muscles, E4031 caused a modest dose-dependent increase of 26 +/- 8% in developed tension and 38 +/- 8% in its maximal rate of rise. Since there was no significant change in the maximal rate of relaxation, the ratio between both maximal velocities increased from 0.92 +/- 0.03 to 1.19 +/- 0.10. Time to peak tension did not change significantly, whereas time to half relaxation increased from 72 +/- 3 to 85 +/- 4 ms. The effective refractory period in the rabbit papillary muscles increased from 179 +/- 10 to 414 +/- 45 ms. In the open-chest dog, the i.v. administration of E4031 did not induce significant changes in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, or left ventricular end diastolic pressure. +dP/dt increased from 1,839 +/- 162 to 2,470 +/- 247 mm Hg/s with no significant change in -dP/dt after 100 micrograms/kg of E4031. Consequently, (+dP/dt)/(-dP/dt) increased from 0.97 +/- 0.07 to 1.18 +/- 0.08. To further evaluate the effects of E4031 on myocardial relaxation, the time constant of isovolumic left ventricular pressure decay was measured by two different methods (tau 1 and tau 2) before and after administering 10 micrograms/kg E4031.

    "45": "We compared the effects of SD-3211, a novel calcium antagonist, on blood pressure, heart rate, and atrioventricular conduction with those of diltiazem using conscious renal hypertensive dogs (one-kidney, one-clip type). We also examined the combined effects of these calcium antagonists with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, on these variables. Oral administration of SD-3211 (1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure without affecting heart rate. SD-3211 at all three doses significantly decreased systolic blood pressure. At 2.5 and 5 mg/kg the compound elicited significant decreases in mean blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. Hypotension obtained with the highest dose of SD-3211 lasted for at least 9 h. No significant alteration in PR interval was observed in electrocardiograms after administration of SD-3211. Diltiazem, given orally at doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg but not 1.25 mg/kg, produced significant hypotension with little change in heart rate. The duration of hypotension induced by the highest dose of diltiazem was only 3 h. Diltiazem prolonged PR interval in a dose-dependent manner, causing second-degree atrioventricular block in some dogs. Combined administration of SD-3211 or diltiazem (2.5 mg/kg) with propranolol (30 mg/kg) resulted in enhanced hypotension with no alteration in heart rate. SD-3211 plus propranolol had little effect on the PR interval, whereas diltiazem plus propranolol caused a markedly enhanced prolongation. These results indicate that SD-3211 is an antihypertensive agent with long-lasting action and little effect on heart rate and atrioventricular conduction and, when administered alone or in combination with propranolol, may be useful in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "46": "The effect of asphyxia on the endolymphatic sac d.c. potential (ESP) was examined in the guinea pig. Asphyxia was caused for 1.5 min by stopping the respirator. The ESP decreased in amplitude during asphyxia. After the termination of asphyxia the ESP showed a diphasic recovery pattern. When respiration was resumed, the ESP decreased again following a transient recovery. Thereafter, the ESP showed a gradual recovery. beta-blocker (propranolol) inhibited a temporary decrease in the ESP after the resumption of respiration, but not alpha-blocker (phentolamine). The result indicates that the ESP decrease after the resumption of respiration is induced by beta-adrenergic action.",

The antihypertensive effects of bopindolol 0.5 to 4 mg are sustained for more than 24 hours after once daily dosing, and the drug appears similar in efficacy to propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol, pindolol and slow release nifedipine in the treatment of mild to moderate forms of this disease. In limited trials bopindolol has also successfully reduced symptoms in patients with angina pectoris, anxiety and essential tremor. Thus, bopindolol is an effective and well-tolerated beta-adrenoceptor antagonist.", 
    "48": "Propranolol decreases plasma T3 and increases plasma rT3 in a dose-dependent manner due to a decreased production rate of T3 and a decreased metabolic clearance rate of rT3, respectively, caused by inhibition of the conversion of T4 into T3 and of rT3 into 3,3'-T2. This inhibition of 5'-deiodination is not secondary to inhibition of thyroid hormone transport across the plasma membrane. Propranolol and its major metabolite, 4-hydroxypropranolol, are not directly responsible for these effects, but an unidentified metabolite of propranolol might be involved. beta-blockers ameliorate clinical symptoms and signs of thyrotoxicosis independent of the decrease of plasma 13, that is confined to beta-blockers with membrane-stabilizing activity, such as propranolol and alprenolol. The decrease of plasma T3, however, appears responsible for some of the metabolic responses to beta-blockers.", 
    "49": "Celiprolol is a third generation beta blocking drug with intrinsic vasodilator effect. We evaluated the effect of this drug at a fixed dose of 400 mg daily in 20 patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina having 2 to 40 episodes of pain a week. All patients had positive exercise stress test with greater than 1 mm ST depression. Compared to the 1 month baseline placebo phase, patients after 3 months of treatment with celiprolol had less episodes of angina (2.4 vs 7.2 a week, p less than 0.001), higher angina threshold (667 vs 337 sec, p less than 0.025), higher ischemia threshold (614 vs 401 sec, p less than 0.001) and were able to perform more work (3937 vs 2403 kgm/min. p less than 0.01). 9 patients had no pain during exercise. A decrease in blood pressure, heart rate and double product was evident in the stress tests of the active phase. Adverse effects included headache (4 patients), sweating (1) and fatigue (1) not requiring modification of drug dose. No adverse effects were seen in 13 patients. Thus, celiprolol is effective to decrease angina during daily life and increase exercise tolerance in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris.", 
    "50": "Urinary albumin excretion is a marker of renal damage in diabetic or hypertensive patients and a reduction of albuminuria during beta-blockade has been demonstrated in several studies. In the present study the effects of beta-blockade with drugs known for differences in their impact on renal function (propranolol, atenolol, bopindolol) on albumin excretion in normotensive and normoalbuminuric subjects were investigated. No effect of beta-blockade on albumin excretion was found, despite decreased plasma renin activity, blood pressure and heart rate. It was concluded that studies in healthy controls are not useful to predict the outcome of treatment in microalbuminuric patients. Cross-over studies using different beta-blockers have yet to be done in micro- or macroalbuminuric patients to evaluate the potential for benefit.", 
    "51": "Hyperthyroidism is accompanied by significant dysfunction of both proximal and distal skeletal muscles. The purpose of this study was to quantitate the degree of muscle weakness in newly diagnosed patients with Graves' disease and to assess the response to treatment. Ten patients were prospectively studied with objective measures of strength and endurance of proximal and distal muscles while hyperthyroid (stage I), after 2 weeks of propranolol (stage II), and about 6 months later when euthyroid (stage III). Propranolol treatment for 2 weeks resulted in a subjective decrease in weakness, which was accompanied by a statistically significant improvement in grip strength (P less than 0.01), shoulder strength (P less than 0.02), and grip endurance (P less than 0.01) but not shoulder endurance. Muscle function further improved and attained control levels when the patients were chemically and clinically euthyroid. In contrast, a control group subjected to the same muscle testing protocol before and after 1 week of propranolol treatment showed no improvement in grip, shoulder strength, or shoulder endurance but had decreased grip endurance (P less than 0.01) and increased subjective weakness. These results confirm that muscle weakness commonly is associated with hyperthyroidism and can be quantitatively profound. In contrast to the effects of beta-blockade in normal controls, propranolol partially improves muscle weakness in thyrotoxic patients. We conclude that thyroid hormone and catecholamines in concert mediate the muscle dysfunction of hyperthyroidism.", 
    "52": "In three separate studies, members of the American Thyroid Association (ATA), the European Thyroid Association (ETA), and the Japan Thyroid Association (JTA) were surveyed by questionnaire on their management of Graves' disease. The aim was to determine how expert clinical thyroidologists employ diagnostic procedures and the three different therapies that are available for this disorder. In this report, we identify, summarize, compare, and contrast similarities and differences in the results of these surveys in these three different regions of the world. In general, ATA members used fewer diagnostic tests than did their European or Japanese colleagues. For the index patient, radioiodine was the therapy of choice for 69% of ATA respondents but only 22% and 11% of ETA and JTA respondents, respectively. In contrast, only 30.5% of ATA respondents chose antithyroid drugs as first-line therapy compared to 77% of ETA and 88% of JTA respondents. There was consensus on the relative lack of a role for thyroidectomy except for narrow indications. The implications of these differing approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease are discussed.", 
    "53": "Cocaine-induced changes in respiratory rate (f), tidal volume (VT), total pulmonary ventilation (VE), dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn) and total pulmonary resistance (RL) were measured in anesthetized, spontaneously breathing Sprague-Dawley rats using a whole-body plethysmograph and an esophageal manometer. Carotid arterial pressure and heart rate were simultaneously monitored. An intravenous (i.v.) dose of 10 mg/kg of cocaine was lethal in all rats tested with death resulting from respiratory failure occurring between 0.25 and 1.5 min after dosing. At an i.v. dosage of 5 mg/kg, cocaine was nonlethal, although a reduction in VE was evident during the first minute after dosing. This reduction in VE was due to a decrease in f and the lack of a compensatory increase in VT. A slight decrease in RL also became evident approximately five minutes after dosing. Pretreatment with the nonselective alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine (10 mg/kg) prevented the cocaine-induced depression in VE by reducing the decrease in f and blocking the inhibition of a compensatory increase in VT. In contrast, pretreatment with the nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (1 mg/kg) potentiated the cocaine-induced decrease in VE by enhancing the depression of f. Pretreatment with propranolol also caused a cocaine-dependent decrease in Cdyn. At a dosage of 0.3 mg/kg, labetalol, a compound possessing both nonselective alpha- and beta 1-antagonist activity (1:7) appeared to cause only a minimal potentiation of the cocaine-induced depressions in VE and f. Pretreatment with propranolol or labetalol also resulted in the death of 20% of the rats administered 5 mg/kg of cocaine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Twenty-nine drugs including eighteen narcotic analgesics, nine beta-blockers, one stimulant and one internal standard were analysed simultaneously by gas chromatograph equipped with a nitrogen-phosphorous detector and gas chromatograph combined with a mass selective detector after derivatization of the drugs.", 
    "55": "Release rates from intramuscular and intra-adipose injection sites are dependent upon several including injection depth. Little is known about the relationship between drug lipophilicity and transport rate of drugs through adipose and muscle tissue. The principal objective of the present study was to investigate to what extend drug lipophilicity affects release and release rate from adipose tissue. Nine pigs were given intravenous (0.1 mg/kg), intramuscular (0.2 mg/kg) and intra-adipose (0.2 mg/kg) injections of propranolol, alprenolol, carazolol, metoprolol and atenolol. The fraction not-absorbed versus time plots after intramuscular and intra-adipose injection showed a biphasic decline for all model compound with the exception of atenolol being the most hydrophilic drug. This biphasic decline indicates that two different mechanisms may be involved in drug release. Initial release rates after intra-adipose injection were negatively correlated (Kendall's rankorder test) with fat-buffer distribution constants. The extent of release after 24 h could be considered as a characteristic parameter for the second release phase. The amounts released after 24 h were lower for propranolol, alprenolol, carazolol and metoprolol than for atenolol. Incomplete release at 24 h can be explained by the decrease of the solvent drag after absorption of the vehicle is complete.", 
    "56": "The effect of beta-blockade in dilated cardiomyopathy was studied by a questionnaire survey. Thirty-three cases were monitored in whom metoprolol (22 patients, 35.9 +/- 20.4 mg, mean +/- SD), propranolol (four patients, 26.3 +/- 7.5 mg), or other beta-blockers (seven patients) were administered. Four patients died, but no direct relationship was found between administration of beta-blocker and death. The NYHA functional class improved significantly. The mean heart rate decreased from 96/min to 77/min (P less than 0.01). The mean cardiothoracic ratio decreased from 55.6% to 52.1% (P less than 0.01). The mean ejection fraction of the left ventricle measured by echocardiogram increased from 30.4% to 36.9% (P less than 0.01). Exercise tolerance in the treadmill test improved significantly. There was no change in blood pressure, nor were there arrhythmias seen on Holter electrocardiograms. In two patients, congestive heart failure deteriorated after administration of beta-blockers. It is concluded that beta-adrenergic blockade has a beneficial effect in most of the patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.", 
    "57": "Conventional therapy of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is currently directed at the control of heart failure. However, the morbidity and mortality of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy remains very high despite such interventions. One promising new approach to therapy of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is beta-blockade. The potential mechanisms for benefit from beta-blockade include protection from catecholamine cardiotoxicity, upregulation of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors, reduction in sudden death, reduction in heart rate, improved ventricular diastolic function, and reduction in afterload. Several reports have suggested that long-term beta-blockade may improve hemodynamic function, clinical symptoms, and survival in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. However, data from controlled trials are limited and some reports have been negative. This paper will summarize the rationale for the use of beta-blocker therapy in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and review the clinical experience with this therapy.", 
    "58": "Beta-blockers were initially given to patients with chronic heart failure due to ischemic heart disease and resting tachycardia. The prompt effect on severe backward heart failure was directly associated with an immediate fall in heart rate. This observation led to long-term administration to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and, later, to patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and secondary cardiomyopathies as well. Due to marked down-regulation of beta receptors, patients with heart failure are extremely sensitive to beta blockade. A test dose of metoprolol 5 mg b.i.d. for 2 days is recommended to select patients for long-term beta-blockade, followed by careful titration with increment in dose over 6 weeks. One important effect of beta-blockade in the early phase of treatment is a reduction in the myocardial energy demand early after the onset of long-term treatment. After 1 month of treatment with beta-blockers, marked improvement of diastolic function is observed. This effect might be attributed to inhibition of calcium overload. After 3 months of treatment, an increase in ejection fraction can be observed, which might be attributed to upregulation of beta receptors. The withdrawal of long-term treatment was followed by a deterioration of heart function in 61% of patients and improvement was seen after reinstitution of beta-blockade. There was an increase in cardiac index and stroke work index at rest as well as during supine exercise. A marked fall in left ventricular filling pressure at rest and unchanged filling pressure during supine exercise was noted, while exercise capacity increased by 25%. A similar pattern was seen in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathies and other secondary cardiomyopathies. However, the increase in ejection fraction in the ischemic cardiomyopathy group was lower (0.06) compared to the groups with dilated cardiomyopathy and other secondary cardiomyopathies (0.18).", 
    "59": "Increased plasma catecholamines - in particular, excessive beta-adrenoceptor activation in chronic heart failure - may easily desensitize the beta-adrenoceptors as well as the postreceptor signal transductions. Since these detrimental changes in the failing heart could be reversible, administration of low-dose beta-blocker, which minimizes the negative inotropic effects, may be effective in attenuating the harmful effects of sympathetic nerve activation. Beta-adrenoceptor stimulation may also produce microtubule disruptions of the cell either through direct action or through an increase in heart rate. Treatment with beta-blockers could attenuate Ca overload by slowing the heart rate and may be useful as a protection from the structural disintegration of the cell. Thus, to clarify the underlying mechanisms of beta-blocker therapy for chronic heart failure, we have to consider not only to the functional aspects but also to the structural changes of the cells.", 
    "60": "To investigate the effects of antihypertensive drugs on hemodynamic and sympathetic nerve responses to exercise, graded ergometer exercise tests were performed before and after two-week administration of nifedipine, captopril and metoprolol in 18 patients with essential hypertension. The arterial pressure, heart rates (HR), and left ventricular functions as obtained by echocardiography, and the plasma norepinephrine (PNE) levels, were evaluated at rest and during submaximal exercise before and after two-week treatment with nifedipine (40 mg/day, 5 cases), captopril (37.5-75 mg/day, 6 cases) and metoprolol (60 mg/day, 7 cases). These 3 drugs significantly reduced systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures but caused no significant changes in resting PNE levels. Nifedipine produced no significant changes in HR and cardiac output (CO) at rest, but augmented the increase in HR (delta HR) and SBP (delta SBP) during submaximal exercise. The increase in PNE (delta PNE) was also augmented by nifedipine. Captopril reduced left ventricular end-diastolic volume and CO without changes in HR and fractional shortening (FS) at rest; whereas, it did not affect delta HR, delta CO, delta SBP or delta PNE during exercise. Metoprolol reduced HR and CO at rest, and also resulted in a decrease in delta FS and delta CO during submaximal exercise. delta SBP was unchanged and delta PNE was increased by treatment with metoprolol. These results indicate that, in hypertensive subjects, the effects on the hemodynamic and sympathetic nerve responses to exercise are different among these 3 antihypertensive drugs despite their identical effects on blood pressure.",

The prime role of the noradrenaline-beta-adrenoceptor system in the regulation of ocular dominance plasticity is discussed in this chapter and includes a newly invented paradigm of ocular dominance changes under anesthesia and paralysis without benefit of visual attention. Based on our recent findings, we have sought to integrate positive contributions of muscarinic cholinergic receptors to the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated regulatory processes. The issue of \"activity dependency\" is important and we recognize the necessity of designing new studies in which relationships between activity dependency within the visual pathway and global neurochemical/cellular factors can be tested directly. Further, we critically reviewed the involvement of gamma-aminobutyric acidA type receptors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the regulation of ocular dominance plasticity.", 
    "62": "The perforant path-dentate gyrus synapse has provided a model system for functional neural plasticity in adult mammalian brain. NMDA-dependent long-term changes in neural connectivity occur at this synapse in response to high-frequency input. Norepinephrine (NE) applied exogenously or released endogenously can initiate both a short- and a long-term potentiation (LTP) of the dentate gyrus response to perforant path input. Triggering of the potentiated response depends on beta-receptor activation and does not require a high-frequency stimulus. An increase in locus coeruleus (LC) activity can initiate both short and LTP of the perforant path response, although a reduction in LC activity does not alter baseline perforant path responses. This chapter considers differences between NE modulation in vitro and in vivo, differences and similarities between NE-LTP and frequency-induced LTP, and the surprising specificity of NE effects at the perforant path synapse. Studies of NE in the dentate gyrus support a role for the LC in promoting both short- and long-term enhancement of responses to complex sensory inputs and are consistent with a role for the LC in memorial as well as attentional processes.",

Water permeability of the skin was positively correlated with the degree of dehydration in the range 80-100% SW. 3. Systemic administration of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (5 mg/kg) 90 min after rehydration started (animals fully hydrated) increased skin permeability to the values observed in 80% SW dehydrated animals. 4. The administration of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol (5 mg/kg) 15 min before rehydration started produced a long-lasting decrease in water permeability during the 3 hr of rehydration. 5. The results are consistent with the hypothesis of a beta-adrenergic control of the water permeability of the skin during rehydration.",

It is suggested that (+/-)-mepindolol and (+/-)-bopindolol are slowly dissociating beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and the non-competitive antagonism can only be detected on tissues with modest receptor reserves for maximum responses to isoprenaline.", 
    "65": "Metipranolol is a non-cardioselective beta adrenergic blocking drug used in the treatment of glaucoma. 56 patients with intraocular pressure between 30-49 mm hg were randomised to one of six treatment regimens for a 12 week period. Each patient received each concentration for 4 weeks and intraocular pressures were checked every two weeks. Using a worst and an average eye approach, mean initial intra-ocular pressures were 35.8 and 35.0 mm hg respectively. The mean fall in intra-ocular pressure after 4 weeks treatment ranged from 12.8 (0.1%) to 14.1 mm hg (0.6%) for average eyes (n = 56), and from 13.4 to 16.7 mm hg for worst eyes. These differences were not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05-p greater than 0.5). Increasing the concentration had no significant effect on pressure. Reducing the concentration had no effect except in patients who changed from 0.6% to 0.1%, when there was a mean rise of approximately 2 mm hg, p less than 0.02. The incidence of stinging varied from 19% of attendances on 0.1%, to 63% on 0.6%. We recommend the use of the 0.1% strength since all three significantly lower intra-ocular pressure but the higher concentrations are more expensive, cause more stinging, and are no better at lowering intra-ocular pressure.",

In a symptom-limited exercise test performed three hours after the first dose, Ismo-retard increased the total duration of exercise by 92 seconds (confidence interval (CI) 5.1-116.9) p less than 0.006, and the time of onset to anginal pain by 117 seconds (CI 27.8, 156.1) p less than 0.004. A similar improvement in total duration of exercise (by 87 seconds) was noted three hours following 15 consecutive once-daily doses (CI 16.8-128) p less than 0.02, and in the time of onset to anginal pain by 101 seconds (CI 19.8-139.6) p less than 0.01.

They have achieved their greatest benefit in the secondary prevention of recurrent events in patients following acute myocardial infarction (MI). This is a review of the major clinical investigations exploring the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients following acute MI and in a variety of patient subsets. These data indicate that the routine use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in postinfarction patients results in a 25% to 35% decrease in mortality and has increased relative and absolute benefit in patients with ventricular ectopy and left ventricular dysfunction. The adverse effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents are discussed which indicate that these drugs are well tolerated with little or no side effects.

Semantic precision, giving a better definition of the populations, is an essential prerequirement in order to tackle scientifically all the facets of assessment of therapy. Accurate definition will help in the study of areas as varied as the methodology, the therapeutic studies, the validity of the recommendations made, the impact of these recommendations on prescription, and finally, the consequences of the prescription in terms of public health (clinical and economical). Several examples are given to show the relationship between these populations and the importance of an accurate definition for each. Guidelines for the identification of these populations are provided. In this overall approach to therapy, epidemiology is an essential, complementary tool to clinical trials.",

This paper discusses the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of six common forms of the disease: exfoliation syndrome, pigmentary glaucoma, neovascular glaucoma, lens-induced glaucoma, glaucoma accompanied by ocular inflammation, and trauma-induced glaucoma. For each of these conditions, clinical experience, observational skills, and an understanding of the mechanisms by which elevated intraocular pressure may result are prerequisites for accurate diagnosis. Management requires that the intraocular pressure be reduced and that the underlying condition be diagnosed so that other appropriate treatment may be initiated.

    "71": "To assess the effect of hemodialysis on the left ventricular (LV) systolic function in the presence and absence of beta blockade, we performed echocardiography just prior to and immediately after 4-hour maintenance hemodialysis in 38 patients with end-stage renal disease. The LV systolic function was assessed in subgroups with normal and increased LV mass in both the beta blockade group (n = 19) and the non-beta blockade group (n = 19). There was a significant negative correlation between LV mass and the dialysis-induced change in the mean velocity of LV circumferential fiber shortening (mean Vcf) in both the beta blockade group (r = -0.93; p less than 0.0005) and in the non-beta blockade group (r = -0.82; p less than 0.0005). The mean dialysis-induced change in mean Vcf in the subgroup with increased LV mass in the beta blockade group (-0.02 +/- 0.11 circumferences/s) was significantly lower than the mean dialysis-induced change in mean Vcf in the non-beta blockade group (+0.12 +/- 0.04 circumferences/s; p less than 0.0005). Thus, the coexistence of increased LV mass and beta blockade significantly impedes the expected improvement of LV systolic function associated with hemodialysis.", 
    "72": "Nitrates are the basic medication of patients suffering from coronary heart disease. Frequently they are combined with calcium-antagonists or beta-receptor-blocking agents. The dose of 20 mg non-retarded dinitrates or mononitrates three times a day have the same effect as retarded nitrates once a day but of a higher dose (60-120 mg). The meaning of this drug has increased because of new results on the mechanism of action: nitric oxide is able to substitute the missing EDRF in the injured intima and leads to dilatation of the stenosis. This mechanism is the basis for the antianginal effect. Already minimal doses (0.025 mg nitroglycerine i.v. 1.25 mg isosorbide dinitrate oral) are effective independent of the dilatation of peripheral venous and arterial vessels. The antiaggregatory effect decrease thrombus formation in patients with unstable angina and the risk of infarction and produce a kind of rinsing effect in the stenosis. The size of infarction becomes smaller, the expansion of the ventricle is less and the prognosis improved. Concerning the calcium-antagonists dihydropiridine-preparations, verapamil and diltiazem have to be separated. Arterial vasodilatation of nifedipine may increase heart rate during exercise and rarely coronary steel phaenonemen. In contrast verapamil (3 x 120 mg) and gallopamil (3 x 50 mg) have strong antianginal effects and reduce the ischemic reaction during exercise about 50%. Heart rate is reduced during physical exercise, similar to the beta-receptor-blocking agents. AV-blocks are rare. Obstipation is more frequent with verapamil than with gallopamil. Verapamil decreases the infarct size and improves the prognosis after infarction in patients without left ventricular failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Significantly lower numbers of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites were found in thalamus and temporal cortex (Brodmann area 38), but not in other brain regions, of antidepressant-treated suicides compared to controls. The lower number of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites in thalamus appeared to be related to drug treatment, whereas lower numbers of beta-adrenoceptors in temporal cortex were also found in antidepressant-free suicides.",

The significant ST increase in strong stressful situations and the adrenal CA turnover augmentation in fed and fasted-propranolol or dihydroergotamine pretreated rats compared to untreated ones provided evidence that alpha- and beta adrenoceptor blockade causes adrenal CA turnover increase and ST prolongation similar to effects observed in our previous experiments. Thus the implication of fasting induced adrenoreceptor downregulation in adrenal CA turnover augmentation and ST prolongation of fasted rats in strong stressful conditions was suggested and the possible mechanisms of these phenomena have been discussed.", 
    "75": "Bovine granulosa cells were treated in culture with alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor ligands to determine the receptor subtype mediating their response to catecholamines. The secretion of oxytocin by granulosa cells in serum-free medium was measured on the fourth day of culture (during the period of acquisition of a luteal phenotype). Cultures were performed in the presence of 0.5 mM ascorbic acid, which increased hormone output and potentiated the response to catecholamines. The effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline on oxytocin secretion were concentration-dependent; maximum stimulation was over 700% with adrenalin (EC50 92 nM) and 500% with noradrenaline (EC50 87 nM). The response to noradrenaline (10(-6) M) and adrenaline (10(-6) M) could be blocked by propranolol but not by phentolamine, suggesting that beta- rather than alpha-adrenoceptors were involved. Blockade by metoprolol and practolol (beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists) was poor and dobutamine (beta 1-agonist) was weakly stimulatory. A concentration-dependent stimulatory response (EC50 200 nM) was obtained with salbutamol (beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist) and stimulation by adrenaline or salbutamol could be blocked by a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist (ICI 118,551). It is concluded that, during luteinization, the long-term response of bovine granulosa cells to stimulation induced by catecholamines is mediated through beta- rather than alpha-adrenoceptors. Although the beta 2-subtype is probably involved, the similar potencies of adrenaline and noradrenaline are uncharacteristic of beta 2-adrenoceptors and may be peculiar to the long-term response shown by these cells.", 
    "76": "Patients with hypertension requiring therapy frequently present with concurrent peripheral vascular disease (PVD). This situation must be taken into account for an optimum antihypertensive treatment. In general, in patients with PVD only a cautious and gradual lowering of the blood pressure is recommended, since the decrease in poststenotic perfusion pressure may accentuate the symptoms of occlusive disease. In intermittent claudication--the most frequent manifestation of occlusive disease beta--receptor blockers today are no longer considered to be contraindicated. In the presence of critical ischemia of the legs (pain at rest and/or necroses) beta blockers should only be given with extreme caution. The agents of choice are calcium antagonists, ACE -inhibitors as well as alpha blockers and some newer vasodilating substances (e.g. Carvedilol). Conventional diuretics show disadvantages. An slightly elevated blood pressure in critical leg ischemia helps to improve the poststenotic perfusion of the affected limb. Antihypertensive treatment should not be instituted in patients whose systolic blood pressure is lower than 160 mmHg.", 
    "77": "This review contains recent data on the pharmacokinetics and the hemodynamic effects on heart rate and blood pressure of three different groups of drugs (beta-blockers: propranolol; oral nitrates: isosorbide-dinitrate (ISDN), isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN); calcium channel blockers: nifedipine) which were investigated in healthy volunteers or in hypertensive patients after drug application at different times of the day. In the case of IS-5-MN and nifedipine two different galenic formulations were studied. The results clearly demonstrate chronopharmacokinetics for propranolol, ISDN, and the immediate-release formulations of IS-5-MN and nifedipine, whereas no pharmacokinetic daily variations were observed with the sustained-release formulations. However, all drugs exhibited daily variations in their hemodynamic effects. These data greatly support the view that pharmacokinetics and drug effects should be studied simultaneously when chronopharmacologic studies are performed.", 
    "78": "We determined the binding affinities of multiple doses of four ophthalmic beta-blockers, timolol, betaxolol, levobunolol and carteolol, to the beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. With a Ki value of 0.39 nM and 0.36 nM for the beta-1 and beta-2 receptors, respectively, levobunolol shows the highest binding affinity to both beta receptors. The Ki values of timolol (1.97 nM for the beta-1 receptor and 2.0 nM for the beta-2 receptor) and of carteolol (0.83 nM and 0.85 nM for the beta-1 and beta-2 receptors, respectively) are characteristic of a nonspecific beta-blocker. On the contrary, betaxolol is a beta-1 specific antagonist (Ki of 23.33 nM) and has a very low binding affinity to the beta-2 receptor (Ki of 200.00 nM). With a radioreceptor assay, levels of beta-antagonist were measured in the plasma and aqueous humor 1 hour and 12 hours after instillation of 50 microliters of 0.5% or 2% each of the four beta-blockers into the rabbit eye. At 1 hour after administration, the plasma levels of timolol, levobunolol, and carteolol are 9.89 ng/ml, 1.60 ng/ml and 8.00 ng/ml, respectively; such levels of 11.82 to 29.22 times the respective Ki values cause a virtually total blockade of both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors and suggest significant systemic absorption. Betaxolol has a peak 1 hour plasma level of 22.28 ng/ml, which is equivalent to only 3.08 times its Ki for the beta-1 receptor and 0.36 times its Ki for the beta-2 receptor; it has less systemic beta-1 blocking activity than the other three drugs and very minimal systemic beta-2 blocking activity. Peak aqueous humor concentrations of all 4 beta-blockers are extremely elevated at 1 hour after administration (timolol 1613.58 ng/ml; betaxolol 866.06 ng/ml; levobunolol 750.89 ng/ml; and carteolol 859.18 ng/ml). Such levels of 14 to 7192 times the respective Ki values should cause a virtually complete blockade of both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors in the iris-ciliary body complex. At 12 hours after administration, plasma levels of all four beta blockers remain moderately elevated (timolol 0.94 ng/ml; betaxolol 9.43 ng/ml; levobunolol 0.66 ng/ml; and carteolol 1.61 ng/ml). Trough aqueous humor levels of levobunolol (43.38 ng/ml) and carteolol (92.81 ng/ml) remain elevated at least 300 times their Ki value. On the contrary, 12-hour trough aqueous humor levels of timolol (33.67 ng/ml) and betaxolol (94.86 ng/ml) have decreased to 2 to 40 times their Ki value, which may explain their requirement for twice daily administration clinically.", 
    "79": "The influence of clinical doses of drugs that affect beta-adrenoceptors has been examined on heart rate, blood pressure, duration of exercise, and on electrolyte concentrations (Na, K, Ca and Mg) during recovery from exercise in healthy volunteers. The drugs used were a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, and a cardioselective, partial beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist with 43% ISA activity, xamoterol. The duration of exercise was smaller on propranolol. Maximum exercise heart rate and blood pressure were reduced significantly by propranolol and atenolol. Xamoterol reduced maximum exercise heart rate and had no effect on blood pressure. The degree of breathlessness and fatigue revealed no differences between treatments. Recent evidence has suggested an association between hyperkalaemia and hypomagnesaemia with an increase in the occurrence of arrythmias following acute myocardial infarction. Exercise-induced hyperkalaemia has been suggested as a factor in sudden death. The results confirmed a rise in serum potassium during exercise and attenuation of the fall during recovery under beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Xamoterol was no different from placebo in these respects. Exercise also produced a rise in magnesium levels and during recovery the level fell below baseline. Both these effects were attenuated by propranolol. Calcium levels were not affected by any of the treatments.", 
    "80": "Epanolol (200 mg once daily) was compared with nifedipine (20 mg twice daily) in a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, crossover study in which 571 patients with stable angina pectoris were entered. Efficacy was assessed by anginal attack rate and short-acting nitrate consumption. Symptoms and treatment preference of the patients were assessed by questionnaires. Assessments were made at baseline and after each 4-week treatment period. Both treatments were equally efficacious as demonstrated by weekly anginal attack rates and nitrate usage. Of those patients who expressed a preference for treatment, 61% expressed a preference for epanolol compared with 39% for nifedipine. Significantly fewer patients reported experiencing flushing, pedal oedema or feeling generally unwell (p less than 0.01) during the epanolol treatment period. Patients withdrew from nifedipine treatment more often than from epanolol because of adverse effects. Hence, epanolol was found to be as efficacious as nifedipine in patients with stable angina pectoris, but exhibited a superior tolerability profile and was preferred by more patients.", 
    "81": "The effect of a number of adrenergic agonists and antagonists on the induction of rat salivary cystatin was investigated. A highly sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay was used to determine cystatin in rat whole saliva. Treatment for 10 consecutive days with a non-specific beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, or the beta 1-adrenergic agonists dobutamine or methoxyphenamine, resulted in the induction of the salivary cystatin. Induction was also found in rats treated for 10 days with arterenol. Only trace quantities of cystatin could be detected in saliva of rats treated with the beta 2-adrenergic agonists terbutaline or salbutamol. When isoproterenol was injected concomitantly with the mixed beta-antagonist propranolol or the beta 1-adrenergic antagonists metaprolol, proctocol or atenolol the production of cystatin was totally suppressed. However, the beta 2-antagonist, ICI 118551, produced only a partial reduction in salivary cystatin induction elicited by isoproterenol. The findings suggest that the induction of salivary cystatin is regulated, in part, by beta 1-adrenergic receptor stimulation.", 
    "82": "The three beta-agonists, salbutamol, ritodrine, and terbutaline have been shown to possess differing potentials to induce leiomyomas in rat costo-uterine muscle following chronic exposure (salbutamol greater than terbutaline greater than ritodrine). It has been suggested that the potential to induce leiomyomas is related to the relaxant properties of these agonists in the costo-uterine muscle. In order to test this hypothesis, the potencies of salbutamol, terbutaline, and ritodrine were compared to isoproterenol and norepinephrine in vitro in the rat costo-uterine smooth muscle, a beta 2-adrenergic receptor rich tissue. All compounds produced relaxation of potassium chloride (KCl) contracted costo-uterine smooth muscle. Significant differences in potency were observed, with isoproterenol being the most potent, followed in rank order by salbutamol, terbutaline and ritodrine. The relative potency of the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol in inhibiting the agonist mediated relaxant activity was similar for all agonists examined, indicative of interactions at the same receptor site (Tallarida and Jacob 1979). When tested for beta-agonist activity in the guinea pig atria, salbutamol and ritodrine were less potent in these tissues compared to the costo-uterine muscle. In summary, the in vitro pharmacological potency of salbutamol, terbutaline and ritodrine correlated with the potential to induce leiomyoma formation in rat costo-uterine muscle following chronic exposure to the respective beta-agonists. These results indicate that the isolated rat costo-uterine muscle is a sensitive model for comparing the potency of beta-agonists, and may assist in establishing the risk of costo-uterine leiomyoma formation in chronic rat studies relative to agents such as salbutamol."
