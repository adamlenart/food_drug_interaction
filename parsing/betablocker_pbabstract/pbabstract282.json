    "0": "The effect of systemically administered propranolol was determined on spontaneous activity of neurons in the central nucleus (CeA) of the amygdala, a brain site implicated in fear-related learning and memory. Extracellular recordings of single units in the CeA were obtained in vivo from rats administered saline or the centrally and peripherally acting beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol (4, 7, 10 mg/kg i.p.). The high dose (10 mg/kg) of propranolol markedly increased spontaneous activity of CeA neurons. In contrast, the low (4 mg/kg) and intermediate (7 mg/kg) doses of propranolol significantly decreased spontaneous CeA activity, with the suppressant effect of propranolol on CeA firing rates weakening as the dosage increased from 4 to 7 mg/kg. These results suggest that (1) spontaneous activity of CeA neurons is tonically influenced by competing excitatory and inhibitory modulatory circuits, and (2) propranolol's effect on the two modulatory circuits is dose dependent: the high dose increasing spontaneous CeA activity by preferentially blocking an inhibitory circuit, the low dose decreasing spontaneous CeA activity by preferentially blocking an excitatory circuit, and the intermediate dose weakly suppressing CeA activity by blocking both the excitatory and inhibitory modulatory circuits. Disinhibition of CeA activity by the high dose of propranolol may explain the enhancement of retention observed in the passive-avoidance task when this dose of the drug is administered systemically, and may have implications for the use of propranolol clinically in treating aversive-memory-related anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress syndrome.",

Of the latter, optimal is isosorbite-5-mononitrate (mono mac). Its minimal risk of development of nitrate tolerance and pharmacokinetics does not depend on hepatic or renal function. A single dose of mono mac varies from 10 to 50 mg. The individual dose is selected by a fall in systolic blood pressure at rest (by 15-20 mm Hg) above 100 mm Hg. In appearance of serious headache nitrates are followed by beta-blockers monotherapy.

Blood samples were collected and analysed for dextromethorphan, dextrorphan, metoprolol, alpha-hydroxymetoprol, omeprazole and 5-hydroxyomeprazole by HPLC. Genotyping was performed for both CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. Generally, plasma levels could be measured up to 8 h post-dose except for alpha-hydroxymetoprolol in poor metabolizers (PMs) and dextromethorphan in extensive metabolizers (EMs) (35% below quantification limit). The correlation between the metabolic ratio based on timed individual measurements and the metabolic ratio based on the AUC0-12 values was significant at 3 h post-dose for all probes. In conclusion, the following procedure is suggested: administer metoprolol (100 mg) and omeprazole (40 mg); after 3 h, take a blood sample to assess the genotype and the metabolic ratio for CYP2D6 (metoprolol over alpha-hydroxymetoprolol) and CYP2C19 (omeprazole over 5-hydroxyomeprazole) in plasma.

However, because persons with cardiovascular or respiratory diseases were generally excluded from many of these early studies, the risk of serious cardiovascular and respiratory side effects was seriously underestimated. Once these drugs were made available to the general population, reports of systemic side effects began to proliferate. Very quickly, adverse effects from topical beta blockade became \"old news.\" Despite this recognition, many treating physicians remained unaware of the potential for systemic beta blockade from topically applied beta blockers. A significant portion of a topically administered dose of a beta blocker can be absorbed and thereby affect systemic beta blockade. Sensitivity to systemic beta blockade can be quite dramatic in certain highly susceptible patients, particularly those with either cardiac or pulmonary abnormalities. Careful review of patients' medications will generally lessen, but not completely eliminate, the risk of undesired complications attributable to topical beta blockade.", 
    "31": "Minoxidil is a direct vasodilator that has been in use for over two decades. It is used primarily to reduce blood pressure in hypertensives who have been poorly controlled on various multidrug regimens. Although minoxidil is extremely effective, its usefulness is limited by its tendency to increase the pulse rate and to trigger salt and water retention. The latter may be incapacitating in some patients. Therefore, minoxidil is typically administered with both a diuretic and an agent that can control the pulse rate, such as a beta blocker. Minoxidil has several other side effects that may limit its use, including hypertrichosis, aggravation of myocardial ischemia and/or left ventricular hypertrophy, and (infrequently) pericardial effusions. If a patient's hypertensive pattern is sufficiently severe to warrant contemplation of minoxidil therapy, referring the patient to a hypertension specialist should be strongly considered.

    "32": "Choosing the initial antihypertensive drug for the uncomplicated hypertensive patient is an important and frequent event for the primary care physician. Patients' first experience with antihypertensive drug therapy will likely affect their long-term perception of hypertension treatment. The choice should be made on the basis of sound scientific data and from the patient's perspective and needs. The drug should be taken once a day, should have proven efficacy in hypertension control and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality reduction, and should have as few side effects as possible. Low-dose thiazide diuretics meet this description, although the need to monitor electrolytes may make them less than ideal. The angiotensin II receptor antagonist class, with side-effects similar to those of placebo in controlled trials, is the most attractive from the patient's perspective, although outcome trial data do not yet exist proving that hypertension treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists reduces cardiovascular events. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, with their low side-effect profiles and unique effects on vascular remodeling, are attractive second choices to combine with a diuretic if needed, although low-dose diuretic/Beta blocker combinations have also been shown to lower blood pressure with minimal side effects. At present, ensuring adequate long-term hypertension control is the most important aspect of hypertensive care, and which antihypertensive drug(s) the physician chooses can greatly affect the hypertensive patient's ability to achieve and to maintain long-term blood pressure control.

It is shown that the sampling proportions of the subgroup have a crucial effect on the bias: As the sampling proportion of the subgroup at or just before the stopping time increases, the bias of the naive subgroup parameter estimator increases as well. An unbiased estimator for the subgroup parameter and an unbiased estimator for its variance are derived. Using simulations, we compare the mean squared error of the unbiased estimator to that of the naive estimator, and we show that the differences are negligible. As an example, the methods of estimation are applied to an actual group sequential clinical trial, The Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial.",

To test the hypothesis that cyclic GMP-independent potassium channels have a larger role in nipradilol-induced aortic relaxation than cyclic GMP-dependent mechanisms, the effects of a potassium channel blocker, tetraethylammonium (TEA, CAS 56-34-8), and of a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, methylene blue (MB, CAS 61-73-4), on nipradilol-induced aortic relaxation were investigated and compared with those on nitroglycerin-induced aortic relaxation in isolated rat aortic rings. Relaxation response was expressed as percent relaxation, which is a percentage of the tension developed by 10(-7) mol/l norepinephrine. Nitroglycerin and nipradilol similarly relaxed the aortic ring in a concentration-dependent manner (10(-9)-10(-4) mol/l). In contrast, desnitronipradilol, a nipradilol analogue which has no nitroxy group, induced almost no aortic relaxation. TEA at 10(-3) mol/l, which is selective for calcium-activated potassium channels, inhibited the aortic relaxation induced by nipradilol (10(-5) mol/l) to a significantly greater extent than that induced by nitroglycerin (10(-5) mol/l) (% relaxation: 30.0 +/- 6.8 vs. 51.1 +/- 6.1%, p < 0.05). MB (10(-5) mol/l) suppressed the relaxation by nitroglycerin slightly but not significantly more than that by nipradilol. (% relaxation: 54.7 +/- 9.9 vs. 64.6 +/- 5.7%). The combination of TEA and MB almost completely eliminated the relaxation induced by nipradilol as well as by nitroglycerin.

    "51": "Rhythmic noradrenergic signaling from the hypothalamic clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus to the pineal gland causes an increase in intracellular cAMP which regulates the circadian fluctuation of melatonin synthesis. The activation of phospholipase C (PLC)-coupled P2Y(2) receptors upon treatment with ATP and UTP exclusively inhibited the isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP production in mouse pineal gland tumor cells. However, the activation of other PLC-coupled receptors including P2Y(1) and bombesin receptors had little or no effect on the isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP production. Also, ATP did not inhibit cAMP production caused by forskolin, prostaglandin E(2), or the adenosine analog NECA. These results suggest a selective coupling between signalings of P2Y(2) and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. The binding of [(3)H]CGP12177 to beta(2)-adrenergic receptors was not effected by the presence of ATP or UTP. Ionomycin decreased the isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP production, whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate slightly potentiated the isoproterenol response. Chelation of intracellular Ca(2+), however, had little effect on the ATP-induced inhibition of cAMP production, while it completely reversed the ionomycin-induced inhibition. Treatment of cells with pertussis toxin almost completely blocked the inhibitory effect of nucleotides. Pertussis toxin also inhibited the nucleotide-induced increase in intracellular Ca(2+) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production by 30-40%, suggesting that the ATP-mediated inhibition of the cAMP generation and the partial activation of PLC are mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i)-protein. We conclude that one of the functions of P2Y(2) receptors on the pineal gland is the selective inhibition of beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated signaling pathways via the inhibitory G-proteins.",

In addition, the USP paddle method was used to determine the release behavior of drug from various formulations prepared from the samples. The data from DSC and XRPD indicated that the molecular state of drug in the complexes was amorphous, whereas that in the physical dispersions exhibited the crystalline state of pure drug. These results suggested that the molecule of drug prepared as drug-resin complexes was monomolecularly dispersed in the resin bead. The IR study provided evidence that demonstrated the interaction between the drug and resin in the complexes. The release behavior of drug from the complexes was governed by the cross-linkage structure and equilibrium treatment of drug exchange of resin.",

The study population was 52% female and 16% African American with a mean age of 58 years. It included 5,446 patients who had essential hypertension (HBP) and 1,014 patients who had isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). These patients had either untreated or uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] 140 to 179 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 90 to 109 mm Hg inclusive at baseline) despite a variety of antihypertensive medications including diuretics, calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and alpha- or beta-blockers, either singly or in combination. The mean baseline blood pressure for the HBP group was 156/97 mm Hg. Candesartan cilexetil as monotherapy (in 51% of HBP patients) reduced mean SBP/DBP by 18.7/ 13.1 mm Hg. As add-on therapy (in 49% of HBP patients) to various background therapies, candesartan cilexetil consistently reduced mean SBP/DBP further, irrespective of the background therapy: diuretics (17.8/11.3 mm Hg), calcium antagonists (16.6/11.2 mm Hg), beta-blockers (16.5/ 10.4 mm Hg), ACE inhibitors (15.3/10.0 mm Hg), alpha-blockers (16.4/10.4 mm Hg). The mean baseline blood pressure for the ISH group was 158/81 mm Hg. Candesartan cilexetil, as monotherapy (in 34% of ISH patients), reduced SBP/DBP by 17.0/4.4 mm Hg. As add-on therapy (in 66% of ISH patients) to various background therapies, candesartan cilexetil consistently reduced mean SBP/DBP further, irrespective of the background therapy: diuretics (17.4/5.1 mm Hg), calcium antagonists (15.6/3.6 mm Hg), beta-blockers (14.0/4.8 mm Hg), ACE inhibitors (13.4/4.3 mm Hg), and alpha-blockers (11.6/4.5 mm Hg). The further blood pressure lowering effects of candesartan cilexetil as add-on therapy were seen regardless of age, sex, and race. Overall, 6.8% of the 6465 patients withdrew because of adverse events, most commonly headache (6.3%) and dizziness (5.0%). Orthostatic hypotension was infrequent; 0.2% with candesartan cilexetil alone, and 0.8% with candesartan cilexetil as add-on therapy. Thus, candesartan cilexetil either alone or as add-on therapy was highly effective for the control of systolic or diastolic hypertension regardless of demographic background when used in typical clinical practice settings.", 
    "71": "Despite the recent emphasis on combination drug therapy for hypertension, little attention has been given to alpha/beta blockade using agents other than labetalol. The purpose of this study was to 1) compare the efficacy of low-dose alpha/beta blockade using doxazosin + betaxolol, versus monotherapy with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (quinapril) and a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide [HCTZ]), and 2) assess the efficacy of low-dose doxazosin. In a crossover study, 21 hypertensive subjects were treated for 3 weeks each with HCTZ, 12.5 to 25 mg/day, quinapril, 10 to 40 mg/day, and a combination of doxazosin, 1 to 4 mg + betaxolol, 5 to 10 mg daily. Doses were titrated to achieve a systolic pressure <130 mm Hg, as assessed by self-recorded home measurements. Home blood pressure decreased 11.5/7.5 mm Hg after HCTZ, 12.9/8.8 mm Hg after quinapril, and 21.2/16.5 mm Hg after doxazosin + betaxolol (P < .001/< .001 v HCTZ and P < .002/< .001 v quinapril). The target systolic pressure was achieved by 33%, 43%, and 71% of subjects, respectively (P = .04 v HCTZ, and .03 v quinapril). Among the 8 subjects in whom doxazosin dosage was increased to the maximum of 4 mg, the mean blood pressure achieved at 4 mg did not differ from that achieved at 2 mg (136/87 v 136/88 mm Hg). We conclude that oral alpha/beta blockade is superior to monotherapy with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or a diuretic and that maximal or near maximal efficacy can be achieved at a 2-mg dose of doxazosin. Low-dose oral alpha/beta blockade merits greater consideration in the drug therapy of essential hypertension.", 
    "72": "The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between drug lipophilicity and the transdermal absorption processes in the iontophoretic delivery in vivo. Anodal iontophoresis of beta-blockers as model drugs having different lipophilicity (atenolol, pindolol, metoprolol, acebutolol, oxprenolol and propranolol) was performed with rats (electrical current, 0.625 mA/cm2; application period, 90 min), and the drug concentrations in skin, cutaneous vein and systemic vein were determined. Increasing the lipophilicity of beta-blockers caused a greater absorption into the skin. Exceptionally, it was found that pindolol had high skin absorption, irrespective of its hydrophilic nature. Further, the drug transfer rate from skin to cutaneous vein (R(SC)) was evaluated from the arterio-venous plasma concentration difference of drug in the skin. Normalized R(SC) by skin concentration showed a negative correlation with the logarithm of n-octanol/buffer partition coefficient (Log P, pH 7.4), suggesting the partitioning between stratum corneum and viable epidermis was a primary process to determine the transfer properties of beta-blockers to local blood circulation. Pindolol exhibited both high skin absorption and high transfer from skin to cutaneous vein. These characteristics of pindolol could be explained by the chemical structure, molecular size and hydrophilicity. These findings for pindolol should be valuable for the optimal design of drug candidates for iontophoretic transdermal delivery.",

Acute ethanol, alone or with cyanamide pretreatment, decreased systolic blood pressure and increased heart rates. Beta-blocker pretreatment with propranolol reduced the alcohol-induced increase in plasma troponin-T, whereas lisinopril potentiated this effect. The beta-blockers, atenolol and metoprolol, and the xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and oxypurinol, were unable to reduce elevated troponin-T. However, pretreatment with the beta-blocker timolol moderated the acute alcohol-induced increase in troponin-T.

Haemodynamic studies and various types of imaging-including echocardiography, radiographic angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and single photon emission computed tomography with (201)Tl, (123)I-beta-methyliodophenylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP), and (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG)-were performed before and 14 months after treatment. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 30% to 57%, and left ventricular end diastolic volume, end systolic volume, and end diastolic pressure showed striking reductions during treatment. Left ventricular mass decreased to about two thirds of the baseline value after treatment. Per cent wall thickening increased after carvedilol in the segments corresponding to non-compacted myocardium. A mismatch between (201)Tl and BMIPP uptake in the area of non-compaction observed before carvedilol disappeared after treatment. Impaired sympathetic neuronal function shown by MIBG recovered after treatment. Thus carvedilol had beneficial effects on left ventricular function, hypertrophy, and both metabolic and adrenergic abnormalities in isolated left ventricular non-compaction.",

    "88": "Foot-shock stress changes the sensitivity of the rat right atria to beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor (AR) agonists. We investigated whether the same stress protocol also changes the atrial sensitivity to the non conventional agonist, (+/-)-CGP12177. Concentration-response curves to (+/-)-CGP12177, a beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist with agonist properties at the putative beta4-adrenoceptors, were obtained in the absence and presence of propranolol (200 nM or 2 microM), CGP20712A 10 nM plus ICI118,551 50 nM, or CGP20712A (1 microM or 3 microM), in right atria from rats submitted to three daily foot-shock sessions (120 mA pulses of 1.0 s duration applied at random intervals of 5-25 s over 30 min) and killed after the third session. The pD2 for (+/-)-CGP12177 was not influenced by foot-shock stress. The stimulant effect of (+/-)-CGP12177 was resistant to blockade by 200 nM and 2 microM (+/-)-propranolol, and to combined blockade by CGP20712A and IC1118,551. However, in right atria from stressed rats given 200 nM propranolol, the concentration-response curve to the agonist was shifted 2.0-fold to the right. CGP20712A shifted the concentration-response curve to (+/-)-CGP12177 to the right by 4.6- (1 microM) and 19-fold (3 microM) in atria of control rats, and by 2.2- (1 microM) and 43-fold (3 microM) in atria of stressed rats. Maximum response to CGP12177 was not affected by propranolol or CGP20712A in concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 10 microM. These results show that the chronotropic effect of (+/-)-CGP12177 is mediated by atypical beta4-adrenoceptors. In constrast with to beta1-and (or) beta2-AR, this receptor is resistant to the effects of foot-shock stress, suggesting that the putative beta4-AR is a different receptor from a low affinity state of beta1-adrenoceptor, as previously proposed, unless both proposed isoforms of beta1-adrenoceptor show independent stress-induced behavior.", 
    "89": "Highly lipophilic compounds are often encountered in the early stages of drug discovery. The apparent permeability (Papp) of these compounds in Caco-2 cell could be underestimated because of considerable retention by the Caco-2 monolayer and non-specific binding to transwell surface. We have utilized a general approach for the determination of permeability of these compounds, which includes the addition of 1-5% DMSO in the apical (AP) and 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the basolateral (BA) side. Two highly lipophilic and highly protein bound Schering compounds, SCH-A and SCH-B, exhibited poor recovery and low Papp in the conventional Caco-2 system that included 1% DMSO in the AP and BA sides. In contrast, both compounds were well absorbed in cynomolgus monkeys. Inclusion of BSA (up to 4%) in the BA side provided necessary absorptive driving force similar to in vivo sink conditions improving both recovery and Papp of these compounds as well as progesterone, a model highly lipophilic and highly protein bound compound. Whereas, the recovery and Papp of mannitol (high recovery, low permeability) and propranolol (high recovery, high permeability) remained unaffected. The presence of 4% BSA increased Papp of SCH-A, SCH-B, and progesterone by five-, four-, and three-fold, respectively. We also compared this approach with a second, based on the disappearance of the compound from the AP side, which resulted in a reasonable estimate of the permeability (23.3x10(-6) cm/s) for SCH-A. The results demonstrated that the reliable estimates of permeability of highly lipophilic compounds that are subjected to considerable retention by the cell monolayer and exhibit non-specific binding are obtained by the addition of BSA to the BA side.", 
    "90": "The beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR)-mediated increase in cardiac L-type Ca2+ current (I(Ca,L)) has been documented in normal subjects. However, the role and mechanism of beta2-AR activation on I(Ca,L) in heart failure (HF) are unclear. Accordingly, we compared the effect of zinterol (ZIN), a highly selective beta2-AR agonist, on I(Ca,L) in isolated left ventricular cardiomyocytes obtained from normal control and age-matched rats with HF induced by left coronary artery ligation (4 months). I(Ca,L) was measured by using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. In normal myocytes, superfusion of ZIN (10(-5) M) caused a 21% increase in I(Ca,L) (9.21 +/- 0.24 versus 7.59 +/- 0.20 pA/pF) (p < 0.05). In HF myocytes, the same concentration of ZIN produced a significantly greater increase (30%) in I(Ca,L) (6.20 +/- 0.24 versus 4.75 +/- 0.17 pA/pF) (p < 0.01). This ZIN-induced increase in I(Ca,L) was further augmented in both normal and HF myocytes (normal: 59 versus 21%; HF: 71 versus 30%) after the incubation of myocytes with pertussis toxin (PTX, 2 microg/ml, 36 degrees C, 6 h). These effects were not modified by the incubation of myocytes with CGP-20712A (3 x 10(-7) M), a beta1-AR antagonist, but were abolished by pretreatment of myocytes with ICI-118551 (10(-7) M), a beta2-AR antagonist. In addition, all of the effects induced by ZIN were completely prevented in the presence of an inhibitory cAMP analog, Rp-cAMPS (100 microM, in the patch-pipette solution). In conclusion, beta2-AR activation stimulates L-type Ca2+ channels and increases I(Ca,L) in both normal and HF myocytes. In HF, beta2-AR activation-induced augmentation of I(Ca,L) was increased. These effects are likely to be mediated through a cAMP-dependent mechanism and coupled with both stimulatory G protein and PTX-sensitive G protein.", 
    "91": "We examined the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril and the beta-blocker propranolol on dilator responses of cerebral arterioles in chronic hypertension. Dilator responses to acute hypotension were examined in untreated Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) that were untreated or treated for 3 months with a low (0.3 mg. kg(-1). day(-1)) or a high (2 mg. kg(-1). day(-1)) dose of perindopril or a dose of propranolol (250 mg. kg(-1). day(-1)) alone or in combination with the low dose of perindopril. Pressure (servo-null) and diameter were measured in cerebral arterioles during acute reductions in arterial pressure both before and during maximal dilatation (EDTA). The high dose of perindopril or the combination of propranolol and perindopril normalized cerebral arteriolar pressure (52+/-2 [mean+/-SEM], 49+/-2 mm Hg versus 50+/-2 mm Hg in WKY and 96+/-3 mm Hg in untreated SHRSP; P<0.05). In contrast, the low dose of perindopril or propranolol alone did not normalize arteriolar pressure (74+/-2 mm Hg and 58+/-3 mm Hg). Both the low and high doses of perindopril improved autoregulatory dilatation, maximal dilatation, and dilator reserve of cerebral arterioles in SHRSP, with the low dose of perindopril being almost as effective as the high dose of perindopril. Propranolol alone did not significantly improve dilator function of cerebral arterioles. Furthermore, dilator function of cerebral arterioles was not further improved by the addition of propranolol to the low dose of perindopril. These findings suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, such as perindopril, may be more effective than propranolol in attenuating the impairment of cerebral autoregulatory vasodilatation, maximal dilatation, and dilator reserve during treatment of chronic hypertension.", 
    "92": "Trials have demonstrated that carvedilol can produce hemodynamic, symptomatic, and prognostic improvements in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), but some DCM patients have deteriorated after carvedilol, developing congestive heart failure. The present study investigated the use of isoproterenol (ISP) stress echocardiography to select those patients with DCM who would respond to carvedilol. ISP was infused intravenously in 22 patients with DCM and they were classified into 2 groups based on the left ventricular systolic response: good response to ISP [change in fractional shortening (FS) with ISP > 0.05, n=13] and poor response to ISP (change < or = 0.05, n=9). In the good response group, FS significantly increased from 0.12+/-0.04 to 0.17+/-0.08 (mean+/-SD, p<0.05) with carvedilol, and 7 patients improved symptomatically (New York Heart Association class). However, in the poor response group, no significant difference was observed between FS at baseline and that at the end of follow-up. Moreover, only 1 patient in the poor response group improved symptomatically. ISP stress echocardiography can assist in selecting patients with DCM who will respond positively to carvedilol.", 
    "93": "Despite the recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of achalasia, aetiology remains obscure and this primary oesophageal motor disorder is still considered \"idiopathic\" in nature. As a consequence, the therapeutic approach remains palliative. Since there is little or no chance of improving the motor abnormalities of the oesophageal body, treatment of achalasia is aimed at symptomatic relief of functional lower oesophageal sphincter obstruction. Pharmacologic treatment induces only a limited and brief improvement. It may be used to treat early cases of achalasia without significant oesophageal dilatation and to manage patients exhibiting some but not all the characteristics of achalasia (e.g. transitional forms). In any event, drug therapy should be seen as a short-term measure and be considered as an alternative only in patients unfit to undergo pneumatic dilatation or surgery. Pneumatic dilatation and surgical myotomy (now increasingly carried out through a minimally invasive approach) remain, therefore, the two main approaches which guarantee long-lasting symptomatic relief. Unfortunately, both pneumatic dilatation and Heller cardiomyotomy are only palliative as neither reliably reverses oesophageal aperistalsis not corrects the incomplete postdeglutition relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter. They do, however, improve symptoms by lowering lower oesophageal sphincter pressure thus enhancing oesophageal emptying by gravity. Recently a third approach, consisting in perendoscopic injection of botulinum toxin into the lower oesophageal sphincter is gaining acceptance. Indeed, more endoscopists are finding this kind of treatment attractive because it does not carry the risk of perforation that can occur with pneumatic dilatation. However, since symptomatic improvement with botulinum toxin only lasts a few months, either repeated injections are required or the patient must be switched to other therapy. There may be, however, subsets of patients for whom BoTox injection is the preferred approach. They probably include elderly patients or patients with multiple medical problems who are poor candidates for more invasive procedures as well as those unwilling to have either surgery or pneumatic dilatation. Future approaches to achalasia may markedly change from the suggested algorithm depending on the long-term efficacy and safety as well as cost analysis of BoTox injection and of minimally invasive surgery.", 
    "94": "The major complication of portal hypertension is represented by gastrointestinal haemorrhage from ruptured oesophageal varices. Gold standard prophylaxis with non selective beta-blockers is able to decrease the risk of bleeding or rebleeding only in a fraction of patients, thus additional forms of treatment are under investigation. Long-acting nitrates have been considered the best candidates to improve the pharmacological response. The rationale for the use of nitrates in portal hypertension is primarily based on the fact that they lead to a decrease in the hepatic venous pressure gradient and on the knowledge that deficient intrahepatic nitric oxide release could be one of the mechanisms involved in the development of increased portal resistance in early cirrhosis. Ten randomised controlled trials have, so far, investigated the clinical usefulness of long-acting nitrates in portal hypertension. Five of them explored the field of primary prophylaxis and the others, the use of nitrates in the prevention of rebleeding. The results of these randomised controlled trials are partially contradictory as far as concerns prevention of bleeding or rebleeding, survival and treatment-related complications. A common finding emerging from most of these studies suggests that the potential for a beneficial or detrimental effect of nitrates depends on the stage of liver disease and the extension of portal collaterals. Thus, in the early stage of cirrhosis, it would be desirable to target nitrates to the liver microvasculature, while, in a later stage, nitrates could be deleterious by aggravating the hyperdynamic syndrome through the expansion of the vascular bed. Whether or not nitrates may have a role in the primary and/or secondary prophylaxis of bleeding needs to be addressed in further long-term studies.",

Ethoxynonafluorobutane and its mixtures with methanol have also been demonstrated to have a unique selectivity in chiral HPLC applications.", 
    "96": "Initial pharmacologic therapy for hypertension is low-dose thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors. Increasing data have confirmed that ACE inhibitors have specific benefit in patients with diabetes, atherosclerosis, left ventricular dysfunction, and renal insufficiency. CCBs are alternative agents for ISH in the elderly and appear to decrease stroke with perhaps less protection against progression of renal insufficiency and proteinuria, CAD mortality and new onset heart failure versus other initial agents, especially ACE inhibitors. ARBs are well tolerated and effective blood pressure lowering agents but have not been confirmed as effective as ACE inhibitors for reducing renal progression, clinical events, or mortality from heart failure. Effective pharmacologic antihypertensive therapy may avoid disabling and undetected cerebrovascular disease, cognitive dysfunction, and disturbing symptoms of elevated blood pressure. Vasopeptidase inhibitor, such as omapatrilat, and endothelin-1 antagonist, such as bosentan, may become future agents approved for the reduction of morbidity and mortality with hypertension. The ALLHAT trial continues to examine the potential benefits and harms of amlodipine versus chlorthalidone and lisinopril in a diverse high-risk population. Based on ALLHAT data, however, doxazosin is no longer an acceptable initial pharmacological agent. Intensive pharmacologic treatment with blood pressure lowering to less than 130/85 mm Hg is recommended with diabetes, renal insufficiency, and heart failure with additional goal of less than 125/75 mm Hg with renal failure and proteinuria greater than 1 g/24 h, based on multiple outcome studies.",

Oftentimes, drug-drug interactions are difficult, if not impossible, to predict because of the high degree of interpatient variability in drug disposition. Certain drug-drug interactions, however, may be avoided through knowledge and sound clinical judgment. Every clinician should maintain a working knowledge of reported drug-drug interactions and an understanding of basic pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles to help predict and minimize the incidence and severity of drug-drug interactions.",

    "100": "The 1997 European Society of Cardiology guidelines emphasised medical therapy as the mainstay of treatment of stable angina. Until recently, the antianginal drugs available to control symptoms (nitrates, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists) have all been haemodynamic agents that eliminate or reduce angina attacks principally by decreasing myocardial oxygen demand. They may also improve myocardial perfusion. The haemodynamic agents are often used in combination. However, there is conflicting evidence for the efficacy of combination treatment. Two recently published large clinical studies, the Total Ischaemic Burden European Trial (TIBET) study and the International Multicenter Angina Exercise (IMAGE) study, suggest that combined haemodynamic treatment is no more effective than optimal monotherapy. The results from IMAGE suggest that most of the additional effect observed with combined therapy was attributable to recruitment by the second drug of patients who had not responded to monotherapy, and that most patients continued to have a disturbing frequency of anginal attacks after receiving combined therapy. Metabolic agents are a new class of drugs that directly modify the use of energy substrates in the heart, lessening ischaemic injury and improving cardiac performance during ischaemia. Due to their non-haemodynamic mode of action, metabolic agents such as trimetazidine or L-carnitine may provide independent benefit in ischaemia when used as monotherapy or additional benefit when used in combination with a conventional agent. Clinical trials have shown that combined haemodynamic and metabolic treatment is more effective than combined haemodynamic therapy and is well tolerated. It is suggested that combination haemodynamic and metabolic therapy is a logical new approach to patients whose angina is inadequately controlled despite optimal haemodynamic therapy.", 
    "101": "Carvedilol is currently used as the racemic mixture, (R,S)-carvedilol, consisting of equal amounts of (R)-carvedilol, an alpha-blocker, and (S)-carvedilol, an alpha- and beta-blocker, which have never been tested in their optically pure forms in human subjects. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 12 healthy male volunteers. Subjects received single oral doses of 25 mg (R,S)-carvedilol, 12.5 mg (R)-carvedilol, 12.5 mg (S)-carvedilol, and placebo at 8 AM as well as at 8 PM. Exercise was performed at 11 AM, and heart rate and blood pressure were measured at rest and after 10 min of exercise. Urine was collected between 10 AM and 6 PM, as well as between 10 PM and 6 AM, and the amounts of urinary 6-hydroxy-melatonin sulfate (aMT6s) were determined by RIA. Compared to placebo, (R)-carvedilol increased heart rate during exercise (+4%, P < 0.05) and recovery (+10%, P < 0.05); (S)-carvedilol decreased heart rate during exercise (-14%, P < 0.05) and recovery (-6%, P < 0.05), and systolic blood pressure during exercise (-12%, P < 0.05); (R,S)-carvedilol decreased heart rate during exercise (-11%, P < 0.05), and systolic blood pressure at rest (-7%, P < 0.05) and during exercise (-10%, P < 0.05). None of the agents had any significant effect on the release of aMT6s. Our results indicate that only (S)-carvedilol causes beta-blockade, whereas (R)-carvedilol appears to increase sympathetic tone, presumably as a physiological reaction to the decrease of blood pressure caused by alpha-blockade. None of the drugs had any influence on melatonin release. The weak clinical net effect of beta-blockade of (R,S)-carvedilol at rest might be one reason why this drug causes fewer side effects than other beta-blockers, such as a reduction of nocturnal melatonin release.",

At 32 weeks' gestation, the fetus was diagnosed to have a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia by ultrasonography and direct fetal electrocardiogram (ECG). Transplacental fetal therapy by maternal oral administration of propranolol resolved the fetal tachyarrhythmia. Although the wave forms of the fetal MCG at 32 weeks' gestation were normal, the fetal MCG at 35 weeks' gestation showed a short PR interval and a long QRS complex duration with a delta wave, indicating WPW syndrome. The findings of the fetal MCG were confirmed by the postnatal ECG. MCG made the prenatal diagnosis of WPW syndrome possible.", 
    "103": "The present study investigated whether the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is involved in formation and retrieval of affective memory. Male Wistar rats with cannulae bilaterally implanted into the BNST were trained on a one-trial step-through inhibitory avoidance task. Shortly after training they received bilateral intra-BNST infusion of lidocaine, various noradrenergic drugs, or corticotropin releasing factor (CRF). Results showed that posttraining intra-BNST infusion of lidocaine impaired retention. Posttraining intra-BNST infusion of norepinephrine or the alpha1 antagonist prazosin induced a dose- and time-dependent retention enhancement or deficit, respectively. The enhancing effect of norepinephrine was mimicked by the alpha1 agonist phenylephrine, and antagonized by prazosin at a non-impairing dose. Posttraining intra-BNST infusion of the alpha2 antagonist idazoxan or the beta antagonist propranolol failed to affect retention. Posttraining intra-BNST infusion of CRF also enhanced retention in a dose-dependent manner. Various drugs infused shortly before testing did not significantly influence locomotor activity and retention. These findings, taken together, suggest that the BNST is involved in memory formation processes for affective experience and norepinephrine released in the BNST acting via alpha1 receptors plays a critical role in this function.",

The inherent selectivity and chemical and physical robustness of the MIP material was demonstrated as an effective stationary-phase material for in-tube SPME. An automated and on-line MIP SPME extraction method was developed for propranolol determination in biological fluids. This simplified the sample preparation process and the chromatographic separation of several beta-blocker compounds. The method developed for propranolol showed improved selectivity in comparison to alternative in-tube stationary-phase materials, overcoming the limitations of existing SPME coating materials. Preconcentration of the sample by the MIP adsorbent increased the sensitivity, yielding a limit of detection of 0.32 microg/mL by UV detection. Excellent method reproducibility (RSD < 5.0%) and column reusability (> 500 injections) were observed over a fairly wide linear dynamic range (0.5-100 microg/mL) in serum samples. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the automated application of a MIP material for in-tube SPME. The method was inexpensive, simple to set up, and simplified the choice of SPME adsorbent for in-tube extraction. The approach can potentially be extended to other MIPs for the determination of a wide range of chemically significant analytes.",

Those who introduced aspirin in the late 19th century would be surprised by the uses of aspirin today. It is anticipated that existing and further studies on the use of aspirin as a primary preventive agent will establish its utility and a more precise niche for it as a chemo-preventive agent. Reports indicate that it may be useful as a chemo-preventive agent in the prevention and possibly in the treatment of cancer of the colon and other malignancies. This plebeian drug, aspirin, has earned a position, some would say an egalitarian position, along with thrombolysis and primary coronary angioplasty in the emergency treatment of AMI. There are those who would add an intravenous beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor to this regimen.

    "128": "The present studies were conducted: (1) to determine which beta-adrenoceptor subtypes are involved in progesterone and oxytocin (OT) secretion, (2) to examine whether noradrenaline (NA) acts directly on the cytochrome P-450scc and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD), and (3) to study the effect of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) on NA-stimulated steroidogenesis in luteal cells. The effect of NA on progesterone secretion from luteal slices of heifers on days 8-12 of the oestrous cycle was blocked by both atenolol (beta 1-antagonist) and ICI 118.551 hydrochloride (beta 2-antagonist). OT secretion was blocked only after treatment with ICI 118.551 hydrochloride (P < 0.05). Dobutamine (10(-4)-10(-6) M), a selective beta 1 agonist and salbutamol (10(-4)-10(-6) M), a selective beta 2 agonist, both increased progesterone production (P < 0.01) with an efficiency comparable to that produced by NA (P < 0.01). The increase of OT content in luteal slices was observed only after treatment with salbutamol at the dose of 10(-5) M (P < 0.01). Dobutamine had no effect on OT production at any dose. A stimulatory effect of NA on cytochrome P-450scc activity (P < 0.05) was demonstrated using 25-hydroxycholesterol as substrate. 3 beta-HSD activity also increased following NA (P < 0.01) or pregnenolone (P < 0.05) and in tissue treated with pregnenolone together with NA (P < 0.01). PGF decreased progesterone synthesis (P < 0.05) and 3 beta-HSD activity (P < 0.01) in tissue treated with NA. We conclude that NA stimulates progesterone secretion by luteal beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, while OT secretion is probably mediated only via the beta 2-receptor. NA also increases cytochrome P-450scc and 3 beta-HSD activity. PGF inhibits the luteotropic effect of NA on the luteal tissue.",

Azimilide, however, significantly prolonged APD and QT interval at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 micromol/L but shortened them at 30 micromol/L. Unlike dl-sotalol, azimilide (>3 micromol/L) increased epicardial APD markedly, causing a diminished TDR. Although both dl-sotalol and azimilide rarely induced EADs in canine left ventricles, they produced frequent EADs in rabbits, in which more pronounced QT prolongation was seen. An increase in TDR by dl-sotalol facilitated transmural propagation of EADs that initiated multiple episodes of spontaneous TdP in 3 of 6 rabbit left ventricles. Of note, although azimilide (3 to 10 micromol/L) increased APD more than dl-sotalol, its EADs often failed to propagate transmurally, probably because of a diminished TDR.",

    "158": "Administration of 30 mg pindolol led to a significant reduction in [18F]MPPF binding potential of 42+/-17%. In contrast, no significant reduction of [18F]MPPF binding potential was observed following administration of buspirone (5+/-17%).", 
    "159": "These results show that [18F]MPPF can be used for measurement of drug-related 5-HT1A receptor occupancy and may be of particular interest in determining the 5-HT1A receptor interaction of new or established drugs in phase 1 and early phase 2 drug trials. Apparently, the 5-HT1A partial agonist buspirone is already clinically effective at low levels of 5-HT1A receptor occupancy.",

    "161": "A total of 65 patients with angina pectoris, free from other diseases and drug free, were Holter monitored for 24 h. A total of 30 patients were also monitored on isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) and on metoprolol respectively. A total of 33 age-matched healthy subjects served as controls. Spectral components of heart rate variability (HRV) were analysed hourly, with special reference to the rapid changes of autonomic tone during the night and early morning hours. Circadian variation was assessed in two ways: (1) Mean HRV day (8 a.m.-8 p.m.) and night (0-5 a.m.) were compared. (2) For the morning/night hours (0-10 a.m.), individual hourly values for max. and min. HRV, the difference max.-min. (gradient), the rate of change per hour between max. and min. (velocity) and the largest difference between two consecutive hours (max. velocity) were recorded and the mean value for the group calculated.", 
    "162": "During the night/morning hours, healthy controls demonstrated faster HF max. velocity (P=0.002) and higher HF gradient (P=0.011) than angina patients. Metoprolol and IS-5-MN increased the HF gradient (P=0.008 and P=0.003, respectively), and metoprolol tended to increase the max. velocity (P=0.02). Metoprolol substantially decreased the LF/HF gradient (P=0.001), velocity (P=0.008) and max. velocity (P=0.0001).", 
    "163": "Rapid vagal withdrawal seemed to be a sign of a healthy autonomic nervous system in the control group but was significantly slower in angina patients. IS-5-MN and metoprolol tended to normalise vagal withdrawal and metoprolol slowed down the rapid increase in sympathetic predominance in the morning in patients.", 
    "164": "One of the putative mechanisms for the salutary effects of beta-blockers in patients with congestive heart failure is their ability to improve autonomic dysfunction. However, patients with profound neurohumoral abnormalities derive little survival benefit from beta-blockers. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effect of beta-blockers on heart rate variability in decompensated heart failure.", 
    "165": "Time and frequency domain heart rate variability indices were obtained from 24-h Holter recordings and compared to assess the role of beta-blockade in 199 patients (mean age 60+/-14 years [range 21 to 87]) with decompensated heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class III [66%] and IV [34%]).", 
    "166": "All heart rate variability indices were markedly suppressed but were substantially higher in patients who were on beta-blockers. Time domain measures of parasympathetic cardiac activity, the percentage of RR intervals with >50 ms variation (4.9+/-0.6 vs. 7.7+/-1.2%, P=0.006) and the square root of mean squared differences of successive RR intervals (22.7+/-2.0 vs. 31.6+/-4.1 ms, P=0.004), were higher in the beta-blocker group. Spectral analysis revealed that the total power and the ultra low frequency power were significantly higher in patients on beta-blockers (82% and 59%, respectively). The high frequency power, a spectral index of parasympathetic modulation, was 41% higher in the beta-blocker group (121+/-25 vs. 171+/-27 ms(2), P=0.02). Multiple linear regression, adjusted for clinical parameters and drug therapies, revealed a strong positive relationship between beta-blockade and higher values of time and frequency domain measures. The mean number of ventricular tachycardia episodes were significantly lower in patients on beta-blocker therapy (3.6+/-1.5 vs. 19.0+/-5.3, P=0.04).",

However this therapy remains vastly underused in clinical practice. The different points challenging the widespread use beta blockade agents in the routine treatment in heart failure are presented and discussed. After a review of the potential mechanism hypothesised behind the benefits of beta-blockers in heart failure, the controversial effects on the haemodynamics, exercise tolerance, hospitalisation and mortality are underlined.", 
    "169": "Nitric oxide (NO) may be an important modulator of sympathetic tone. We used im and sc microdialysis in humans to characterize the interaction of NO synthase inhibition and adrenoreceptor stimulation on tissue perfusion, metabolism, and norepinephrine release. Microdialysis probes were perfused with L- or D-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester (100 micromol/L) followed by incremental doses of isoproterenol, epinephrine, or nitroprusside. Blood flow was estimated based on the ethanol dilution technique. In muscle, the increase in blood flow with isoproterenol was abolished by L-NAME. The ethanol ratio was 0.03 +/- 0.011 with D-NAME and 0.075 +/- 0.014 with L-NAME during isoproterenol treatment (1 micromol/L). The effect was less pronounced in adipose tissue. The vasodilatory effect of nitroprusside was similar with D- and L-NAME. L-NAME augmented isoproterenol- and epinephrine-induced glycerol release. Dialysate glycerol during 1 micromol/L isoproterenol was 47 +/- 6.7 micromol/L with D-NAME and 72 +/- 15 micromol/L with L-NAME. In skeletal muscle, dialysate norepinephrine during 1 micromol/L isoproterenol treatment was 0.73 +/- 0.17 and 1.3 +/- 0.15 nmol/L with D- and L-NAME, respectively. We conclude that NO synthase inhibition attenuates beta(2)-adrenoreceptor-mediated vasodilation and enhances beta-adrenoreceptor-mediated lipolysis. These effects are in part mediated through an increase in interstitial norepinephrine concentrations. The data are consistent with the idea that in humans, NO is important in modulating and ameliorating sympathetic effects in peripheral tissues.", 
    "170": "Ventricular arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction are the main causes of death in human heart failure (HF). In a rabbit HF model reproducing these same aspects of human HF, we demonstrate that a 2-fold functional upregulation of Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange (NaCaX) unloads sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) stores, reducing Ca(2+) transients and contractile function. Whereas beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) are progressively downregulated in HF, residual beta-AR responsiveness at this critical HF stage allows SR Ca(2+) load to increase, causing spontaneous SR Ca(2+) release and transient inward current carried by NaCaX. A given Ca(2+) release produces greater arrhythmogenic inward current in HF (as a result of NaCaX upregulation), and approximately 50% less Ca(2+) release is required to trigger an action potential in HF. The inward rectifier potassium current (I(K1)) is reduced by 49% in HF, and this allows greater depolarization for a given NaCaX current. Partially blocking I(K1) in control cells with barium mimics the greater depolarization for a given current injection seen in HF. Thus, we present data to support a novel paradigm in which changes in NaCaX and I(K1), and residual beta-AR responsiveness, conspire to greatly increase the propensity for triggered arrhythmias in HF. In addition, NaCaX upregulation appears to be a critical link between contractile dysfunction and arrhythmogenesis.",

    "173": "audit of the first 100 operations between 1990-93 resulted in 4 changes to clinical practice. These included the use of Dacron instead of vein because of 3 vein patch blowouts, invasive postoperative monitoring of blood pressure, and the use of intravenous beta-blockers to control hypertension, because of 4 hyperperfusion injuries. The use of 10F suction drains was discontinued, because they did not prevent 8 wound haematomas. The results of the second 100 cases between 1994-97 and the third 100 cases between 1998-2000 confirmed no further hyperperfusion injuries or patch blowouts (p =0.01 and 0.04 respectively). Larger 14F suction drains were reintroduced for the third series because of thirteen haematomas in the second series (p =0.09). Only 4 haematomas occurred in the third series ( p =0.05). The need for beta-blockers fell in the third series due to the introduction of local anaesthesia (p =0.0001).", 
    "174": "The use of Dacron patches and postoperative control of hypertension has reduced the incidence of haemorrhage and hyperperfusion after carotid endarterectomy. Larger suction drains may also help.", 
    "175": "Treatment of patients with several drugs simultaneously may result in modulation of the naturally expressed P-glycoprotein (Pgp) at different tissues. With this possibility in mind, we have assessed the ability of different classes of drugs to modulate Pgp function in vitro. Modulation of the Pgp function was studied at in vitro drug concentrations comparable to therapeutic blood levels of the drugs.", 
    "176": "Human blood brain barrier endothelial cells and human colon adenocarcinoma cells were transduced or transfected with the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) to express Pgp. The uptake of fluorescent substrates of Pgp, Rhodamine 123 and daunorubicin, into these cells and NIH3T3/MDR1 and MDCK/MDR1 cells was measured by flow cytometry and in monolayers in the presence and absence of the different drugs.", 
    "177": "From the tested six H1-receptor blockers, seven beta-adrenergic antagonists, four analgesics, ten diuretics and five quinolons, five drugs inhibited Pgp at therapeutic blood levels and two at somewhat higher concentrations. Significant synergism for blocking Pgp could be demonstrated for several drugs.", 
    "178": "We conclude that administration of several drugs which modulate the function of Pgp to patients may adversely affect the natural function of this efflux pump and may cause drug-drug interactions induced side effects.", 
    "179": "Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a clinically and genetically heterogenous syndrome characterized by a lengthening of the QT interval on the surface ECG and a propensity to severe ventricular arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation, leading eventually to syncope and sudden death. This rare syndrome with a mendelian inheritance occurs in subjects with otherwise normal cardiac morphological examination. The potentially severe prognosis justifies a presymptomatic diagnosis. The genetic nature of the disease has been confirmed with the identification of at least six loci and five genes. This syndrome is a perfect illustration of an adrenergic-induced ventricular arrhythmia. The first-line treatment is a beta-blocking agent for all symptomatic patients. In addition, a number of drugs known to lengthen ventricular repolarization must be prohibited. In case of suspicion of LQTS, all family members should be tested both clinically with a surface ECG and genetically in order to diagnose presymptomatic patients.", 
    "180": "The first rule of medicine is, 'do no harm'. Perhaps accepting this precept has produced a logic for disease treatment where our primary purpose is limited to only assisting or helping to correct a malfunctioning system. Can we use drugs that, according to traditional views, would be considered to increase stress on the system in the short term, to actually treat and cure disease in the long term? Is it possible to exacerbate disease for a longer-term gain? Although there are several examples of where this strategy has appeared to work, a systematic testing of the hypothesis has not occurred and, for the majority of diseases, this hypothesis has never been tested.", 
    "181": "Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) produces nitric oxide (NO) which, after diffusing into vascular smooth muscle cells, activates guanylate cyclase leading to vasodilatation. A polymorphism (894G to T) in exon 7 of the eNOS gene causes the conversion of Glu to Asp in position 298. The recently described crystal structure of the heme domain of eNOS protein shows that Glu298 is fully solvent accessible and distant from regions integral to enzyme function. Searching for phenotypic expression of eNOS gene variants, we genotyped a group of patients with essential hypertension (H, n = 119) for the Glu298Asp polymorphism and compared them with age- and sex-matched healthy normals (N, n = 85). To specify phenotypic expression further, the hypertensive patients were subdivided into one group that responded well to regular antihypertensive therapy (CH, n = 45) and one group that was resistant to the therapy (RH, n = 74). Patients with BP higher than 140/90 mmHg when on adequate lifestyle modification and triple-combination therapy (including diuretics) were considered resistant. In RH and H groups, a significantly higher frequency of T alleles (P = 0.022 and P = 0.046, respectively) was found compared to normotonics (N). In well-controlled hypertonics, the same tendency was found, but did not reach statistical significance. The Glu298Asp polymorphism may contribute to the complex pathogenesis of essential hypertension and may be a factor in the resistance of these patients to conventional antihypertensive therapy. The presence of this allele may thus be predictive of the patients' therapeutic response.",

Changes in cyclic nucleotide concentrations have been implicated in the genesis of ischemia-induced arrhythmias. However, in the present study GI104313 did not change the concentrations of adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) (1.0 +/- 0.07 pmol x mg(-1), 1.0 +/- 0.05 pmol x mg(-1)) or guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP) (0.025 +/- 0.008 pmol x mg(-1) protein, 0.017 +/- 0.004 pmol x mg(-1) protein) in the left ventricle during ischemia-induced arrhythmias in anesthetized rats compared to saline (0.9 +/- 0.1 pmol x mg(-1) and 0.013 +/- 0.002 pmol x m(-1), respectively).",

    "186": "A chromatographic method, which can quantitate mitomycin C (MMC) along with two antiglaucoma drugs, is described. The separation of MMC, alphagan and timolol was performed on a reversed-phase C18 column with water-methanol-trifluoroacetic acid (65:35:0.01, v/v) as the mobile phase. By monitoring at 360, 248 and 296 nm, the lower limits of detection for MMC, alphagan and timolol are, respectively, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 ng (injection amount) at three-time S/N ratio. The dynamic ranges of quantitation for the three drugs are, respectively, 1.0 ng-10.0 microg, 2.0 ng-10.0 microg and 5.0 ng-10.0 microg with linearity being larger than 0.9960. This method was applied to the determination of MMC levels in Tenon's and trabeculum tissues of 10 glaucoma patients. MMC levels in these tissues, which were obtained from glaucoma filtering surgery, were determined following a multiple extraction with methanol. The recovery of MMC for a two-batch extraction was better than 91.2%. The reproducibility of measurement for the MMC levels in these tissues is 2.5-6.0% RSD for triplicate injections. The intra-day variation of retention times for the MMC peaks was less than 1.6% RSD (n=3). The inter-day variation of retention times for the MMC peaks was less than 4.8% RSD (n=3). MMC was detectable in three trabeculum tissues out of 10 cases (ranging from 0.8 to 25.5 ng/mg specimen), while MMC was detected in nine Tenon's tissues out of 10 cases (ranging from 0.3 to 21.1 ng/mg specimen). The results obtained show that the method is sensitive and selective for the quantitation of MMC.",

Resolution of the enantiomers was achieved using carboxymethyl-beta-cyclodextrin (CM-beta-CD) as the chiral selector. A 100-mM acetate buffer (pH 4.0) containing 5% 2-propanol and 10 mM CM-beta-CD resulted in the optimum separation of the metoprolol enantiomers and its acidic metabolite in human urine. Following a single metoprolol oral administration of 100 mg racemic metoprolol tartrate, stereoselective pharmacokinetic analysis showed that urinary acidic metabolite 3 of metoprolol accounted for 62.3% of the dose with an R/S ratio of 1.23 and urinary unchanged metoprolol 1 accounted for 6.3% of the dose with an R/S ratio of 0.72.",

Carvedilol and the internal standard carazolol are isolated from plasma samples by liquid-liquid extraction using diethylether. A sensitive and selective detection is provided by helium-cadmium laser-induced fluorescence. The total analysis time is 17.5 min, about 30 min are needed for the sample preparation. The linearity of the assay ranges from 1.56 to 50 ng/ml per carvedilol enantiomer. The limits of quantification (LOQ) for the carvedilol enantiomers in 100 microl of human plasma are 1.56 ng/ml. The inter-day accuracy for R-carvedilol is between 95.8 and 103% (104% at LOQ) and for S-carvedilol between 97.1 and 103% (107% at LOQ); the inter-day precision values are between 3.81 and 8.64% (10.9% at LOQ) and between 5.47 and 7.86% (7.91% at LOQ) for R- and S-carvedilol, respectively. The small sample volume needed is especially advantageous for the application in clinical studies in pediatric patients. As an application of the assay concentration/time profiles of the carvedilol enantiomers in a 5-year-old patient receiving a test dose of 0.09 mg/kg carvedilol are reported.",

Progression of the disease was measured in two modes: by changes in the optical nerve disc (c/d) and by IOP level. Duration of the study was 12 months. Total costs (e.g. number of visits, amount of medications used, surgical and laser procedures performed) were calculated on 100 eyes/12 months.", 
    "191": "Pharmacological therapy constitutes 40-50% of the total costs in both glaucoma types. Timolol was the mostly prescribed drug in POAG, while pilocarpine led in PACG group. Dorzolamide was on the third place, but it generated the biggest part of total costs. Patients with advanced forms of the disease more frequently saw doctor on visits (average 6 visits per year); patients with elevated IOP (> 21 mm Hg) underwent surgical procedures more commonly than these with optical nerve disc changes (c/d > 0.6).

    "193": "There is now compelling evidence in favor of the use of beta-adrenergic antagonists for the treatment of chronic heart failure. In clinically stable patients who remain symptomatic despite the fact that they are already receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, diuretics and digoxin, the addition of a beta-blocker has been shown to produce further improvements in cardiac function and structure as well as in the quality and quantity of life. However, although such benefits can be achieved with a number of beta-blockers, the relevant differences in the ability of inhibiting the adrenergic drive among the various agents in the same class could translate into quantitatively different clinical effects. At present, the question whether all beta-blockers confer equal benefit or not to heart failure patients remains unanswered, since only few studies have prospectively addressed the issue and overall evidence does not permit to draw a conclusion that one agent has to be preferred to another. A large ongoing trial, designed to compare the effects of metoprolol and carvedilol on all-cause mortality in chronic heart failure, will provide much of the information required.", 
    "194": "In functional pharmacological assays, talsaclidine has been described as a functionally preferential M1 agonist with full intrinsic activity, and less pronounced effects at M2- and M3 receptors. In accordance with this, cholinomimetic central activation measured in rabbits by EEG recordings occurred at a 10 fold lower dose than that inducing predominantly M3-mediated side effects. This pharmacological profile is also reflected in the clinical situation: Both in healthy volunteers and in Alzheimer patients--unlike after unspecific receptor stimulation through cholinesterase inhibitors--the mainly M3-mediated gastrointestinal effects (like nausea and vomiting) were not dose-limiting. Rather, sweating and hypersalivation, mediated through muscarinic receptors, occurred dose-dependently and were finally dose-limiting. In contrast to talsaclidine, sabcomeline had a less pronounced functional M1 selectivity in pharmacological assays. This was also shown in anaesthetized guinea pigs where sabcomeline alone induced bronchoconstriction, and in the rabbit EEG where central activation and cholinergic side effects occurred in the same dose range. Neither drug, however, showed convincing improvement of cognitive functions in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. This asks for a reassessment of the muscarinic hypothesis for the treatment of this disease.", 
    "195": "Bucindolol and carvedilol, nonselective beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptor antagonists, have been widely used in clinical therapeutic trials of congestive heart failure. The aim of the current study was to investigate long-term effects of bucindolol or carvedilol on beta-adrenergic receptor protein and gene expression in cardiac myocytes. Embryonic chick cardiac myocytes were cultured and incubated with bucindolol (1 microM), carvedilol (1 microM), or norepinephrine (1 microM) for 24 h. 125I-iodocyanopindolol binding assays demonstrated that incubation with norepinephrine or bucindolol, but not carvedilol, significantly decreased beta-adrenergic receptor density in crude membranes prepared from the myocytes. Neither bucindolol nor carvedilol significantly stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes from drug-untreated cells. Unlike by norepinephrine, the receptor density reduction by bucindolol incubation was not accompanied by a change in beta1-adrenergic receptor messenger RNA abundance. A decrease in membrane beta-adrenergic receptor density without a change in cognate messenger RNA abundance was also observed in hamster DDT1 MF2 cell line incubated with bucindolol (1 microM, 24 h). We conclude that incubation with bucindolol, but not carvedilol, results in true reduction of beta-adrenergic receptor density in chick cardiac myocyte membranes by mechanisms that are distinct from those responsible for receptor density reduction by the agonist norepinephrine.", 
    "196": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a prevalent disease in Westernised society, and more than 50% of individuals with diabetes mellitus die from cardiovascular causes. The underlying metabolic defect of type 2 diabetes mellitus is a combination of insulin resistance and decreased secretion of insulin by pancreatic beta-cells. Insulin resistance commonly precedes the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is usually associated with a metabolic syndrome including hypertension, dyslipidaemia and obesity. Treatment of known cardiovascular risk factors, including hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and smoking, plays a key role in delaying the onset and progression of coronary heart disease (CHD) and other forms of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes mellitus. Sulphonylureas should be used with caution in patients with CHD but aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors play an important role in the medical management of patients with established coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus. Patients with diabetes mellitus represent a higher risk group of patients after both percutaneous and surgical coronary revascularisation and the decision regarding the choice of revascularisation procedure should take into account angiographic characteristics, clinical status and patient preference. Patients presenting with diabetes mellitus and acute myocardial infarction should be considered for reperfusion therapy with either urgent thrombolytic therapy or primary percutaneous coronary intervention."
