    "0": "A model is described (anaesthetized, open-chest cats subjected to acute coronary artery occlusion) which allows the effects of drug interventions to be determined on one major electrocardiographic index of myocardial ischaemia. Epicardial ST-segment changes were continuously recorded from five individual sites on the surface of the left ventricle. Coronary artery occlusion (left anterior descending branch) resulted in marked and consistent elevations of the ST-segment in all sites in nearly all experiments. These changes started within 1 min of the onset of ischaemia and reached a peak at between 30 and 60 min; thereafter there was a gradual reduction over the next 4 h. The one significant haemodynamic effect of coronary artery occlusion was an increase in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Ventricular ectopic activity was not pronounced in this model (about 50 ectopic beats over the initial 30 min post-occlusion period). Exaprolol (1.0 mg kg-1, intravenously) a potent beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent with 'membrane stabilising activity', when given 1 h after the onset of ischaemia, reduced heart rate and LV dP/dtmax and increased LVEDP. These effects were prolonged (i.e. little recovery in heart rate 3 h after administration). Exaprolol decreased total ST-segment elevation immediately after administration; this was significantly different from the effect of intravenous saline and lasted for at least 3 h. The effects appeared to be greater at sites of less pronounced ischaemia. Intramyocardial temperature records were taken to indicate a reduction in blood flow to the ischaemic region; however the alleviation of epicardial ST-segment elevation suggests an improved myocardial oxygen demand:supply ratio. Reperfusion was unsuccessfully attempted after a 4 h occlusion period; reperfusion after a shorter period (30 min) resulted in ventricular ectopic activity but no fibrillation.", 
    "1": "Adenosine appears to regulate resting blood flow in canine subcutaneous adipose tissue. Sympathetic nerve stimulation has been shown to enhance the adenosine production in this tissue. This study therefore tested the possibility that adenosine may influence the vascular responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation. Intraarterial infusion of adenosine (5-20 microM in arterial blood) increased the resting vascular conductance (from 0.048 +/- 0.007 to 0.095 +/- 0.013 ml . min-1 . 100 g-1. mmHg-1) and the percental reduction in vascular conductance due to sympathetic nerve stimulation (4 HZ) by 34 per cent (p less than 0.05) and to i.a. noradrenaline by 27 per cent (p less than 0.05). The vasodilator response due to nerve stimulation after alpha-blockade was reduced by adenosine. Dipyridamole (0.5-1.5 microM) + EHNA (3-10 microM), which increases plasma adenosine levels, had similar effects to adenosine, while theophylline (30-80 microM) decreased the vasoconstrictor response. The vasoconstrictor escape was enhanced by EHNA alone and in combination with dipyridamole, but was reduced by theophylline. On the other hand, the poststimulatory hyperemia was unaffected by adenosine, dipyridamole and EHNA, and theophylline. The results show that adenosine does not reduce the magnitude of the initial vasoconstrictor response in proportion to the increase in resting blood flow. The autoregulatory escape in adipose tissue during nerve stimulation appears to be mediated both by adenosine and by noradrenaline acting on beta-adrenoceptors. Poststimulatory hyperemia does not seem to be greatly influenced by exogenous or endogenous adenosine.", 
    "2": "The antihypertensive effect of the fixed combination of timolol, a beta-blocking agent, hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, and amiloride, a potassium sparing agent, was compared against that of methyldopa in an open study lasting 16 weeks in 32 ambulatory African patients with previously untreated diastolic blood pressure of 95-120 mm Hg. A significant fall in mean diastolic and systolic blood pressure was achieved in both groups up to 8 weeks of treatment and was sustained in the timolol-hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride group during the entire follow-up. In the methyldopa group, mean diastolic and systolic blood pressure rose during follow-up. At 16 weeks the fall in mean diastolic and systolic blood pressure was significantly greater in the timolol-hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride treated patients than in the methyldopa group. Adverse reactions were more frequent and severe in the methyldopa group than in timolol-hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride treated patients. It is concluded that the fixed drug combination of timolol-hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride (Moducren) is effective in controlling mild to moderate hypertension in Africans and is better tolerated than methyldopa in these patients. It is further noted that hypertensive patients can be treated with a combination tablet once a day. This is of crucial significance as it would promote better compliance and, hence, minimize the sequelae of poorly controlled hypertension.", 
    "3": "The paper reports hemodynamic and biochemical findings in 76 patients with acute myocardial infarction on the basis of which the patients were treated with either peripheral vasodilators (sodium nitroprusside) or beta-blockers (obsidan). Changes in hemodynamic patterns and myocardial metabolism in response to treatment are described. It is concluded that careful hemodynamic and metabolic monitoring is essential in the management of acute myocardial infarction, particularly, where agents affecting the spread of necrotic areas are administered.", 
    "4": "A total of 139 patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and the hyperdynamic syndrome were investigated. To 67 of those, the beta-adrenoblocker propranolol was administered intravenously on the first day of the disease, with a series of further injections over the next 9 days, on average, under central hemodynamic control. Hemodynamic parameters were assessed by means of integral rheography and polycardiography, the MI size was measured by precardial charting (from 35 ECG leads) and serial evaluations of CPK and MB (the latter's isoenzyme) activity. Propranolol administered in the early hours after the infarction reduced heart performance and hence functional load on the myocardium, which improved the latter's contractility. The efficiency of propranolol treatment was dependent on the time of first administration. When administered early (within 5 hours of the attack), the drug reduced the MI size by 56% as compared to the controls, whereas late administration (12-24 hours after the attack) produced a 12% reduction. Regular propranolol treatment in patients with the hyperdynamic syndrome reduced the frequency of certain MI complications, such as prolonged course with relapses, acute congestive failure, rhythm and conductivity disorders, and total mortality.", 
    "5": "The effect of propranolol on the hyperaemic response after transient coronary arterial occlusion has been evaluated. The excess volume of blood delivered to the myocardium after an occlusion is diminished after propranolol in proportion to the reduced coronary blood flow. From the findings it is not necessary to postulate a change in the intrinsic mechanisms of reactive hyperaemia after propranolol has been given.", 
    "6": "Exposure of the rat brain to estradiol is known to modify certain neurotransmitter binding sites. We have now examined the influence of long-term (3 months) treatment with this steroid. Opiate and benzodiazepine receptors are both elevated in hypothalamus but not in amygdala or cerebral cortex. In contrast, the affinity, but not maximum binding, of hypothalamic beta-adrenergic sites is reduced 5-fold. Our results confirm and extend previous reports that hypothalamic neurotransmitter binding sites are particularly sensitive to estrogen feedback.", 
    "7": "Diester diterpenes based upon phorbol, 4-deoxyphorbol, 4 alpha-deoxyphorbol, 4-deoxy-5-hydroxyphorbol and 4,20-dideoxy-5-hydroxyphorbol were isolated from the fruit oil of Sapium indicum. Corresponding tri- and tetra-esters were produced by acetylation and mono-esters by selective hydrolysis. Twenty-six compounds were tested for production of erythema in vivo and induction of human and rabbit platelet aggregation in vitro. The flatter shape of the AB-ring trans compounds is necessary for interaction of phorbolesters at their receptor in that the cis analogues were inactive. The tertiary C-4 hydroxy group of phorbol was not necessary for activity although the 4-deoxy derivatives were less potent than the 4-hydroxy diterpenes. A primary hydroxy group at C-20 was essential for biological activity because the methyl and aldehyde derivatives of this position were inactive. The C-20 acetates were also inactive on platelets, but they did produce erythema, possibly because of the removal of the ester due to lipase activity in the skin. 5-hydroxy-analogues which undergo intramolecular hydrogen bonding had greatly reduced activities in both systems. Membrane stabilisers, phospholipase A2 and calmodulin inhibitors were antagonists for phorbol esters in platelet aggregation tests, whilst cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors and free radical scavengers had no inhibitory effects. Consequently, one electron withdrawal and free radical formation plays no part in the biological activity of these compounds.", 
    "8": "Isolated guinea-pig hearts were perfused aerobically for 60 min, then made anoxic for 30 min and finally reoxygenated for 30 min. The effects of prazosin, atenolol and practolol on contractility, coronary pressure, ECG and LDH release were examined. Prazosin and atenolol were able to reduce significantly the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and LDH release. The same two drugs increased the recovery of normal electrical activity after 30 min of reoxygenation. Practolol, on the other hand, was ineffective in reducing the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and LDH release.", 
    "9": "Both dopamine and apomorphine caused concentration-dependent contractions of the bovine pulmonary artery from rest. Both of these compounds caused of the bovine pulmonary artery from rest. Both of these compounds caused relaxation of histamine-precontracted arterial and venous strips after alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. Arterial contraction elicited by dopamine was inhibited either by phentolamine (alpha-blocker) or by the dopamine-selective antagonists, spiperone and butaclamol. Apomorphine in the highest concentration (greater than 10(-5) M) inhibited dopamine-induced contractions. Dopamine- and apomorphine-induced vascular relaxations were attenuated by propranolol but not by spiperone or butaclamol. These data suggest that dopamine- and apomorphine-induced relaxation in these preparations is most likely mediated through beta-adrenergic mechanisms, whereas dopamine-induced contractions seem to involve both alpha-adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors.", 
    "10": "The spontaneous electrical and mechanical activities of the circular and longitudinal muscle layers of the canine colon were studied. The smooth muscle cells of the circular muscle layer exhibited regular, omni-present myogenic slow-wave activity at a frequency ranging from 4 to 7 c/min. With intracellular micro-electrodes, the slow-wave amplitude was 21-38 mV and its duration 3-6 sec. The 'resting' membrane potential was -60 to -76 mV. Some slow waves had superimposed spike bursts on their peak depolarizations and only these were associated with phasic contractions. It is concluded that they serve a pace-maker function similar to their counterpart in the small intestine. The longitudinal muscle layer exhibited periods of electrical activity alternating with periods of electrical quiescence. During the activity periods electrical oscillations occurred at a frequency of 13-35 c/min with spikes on top of them. Each electrical activity period was associated with a prolonged 'tonic' contraction. The duration of these periods was 30-120 sec and their frequency 0.4-1.1 period/min. This activity is similar to that recorded from the longitudinal muscle of the guinea-pig caecum despite the anatomical differences. The electrical activity periods of the longitudinal muscle appeared to require an excitatory input (stretch and/or acetylcholine release). Provided the strips were not excessively stretched, atropine abolished all electrical and motor activity. Stretching prolonged the electrical activity periods until they eventually fused together and the muscle developed maintained tone. Simultaneously recording from both layers showed that, although electrotonic spread between the two layers is probably insignificant, the activity of the two layers was co-ordinated. Only those slow waves of the circular layer that occurred during the electrical activity periods of the longitudinal layer had superimposed spikes. It is suggested that this co-ordination may indicate that the two muscle layers may be commanded by a common input from periodically active, cholinergic intramural neurones. It is proposed that the complex patterns of colonic electrical and motor activities may be explained as consisting of two major components: one arising from the longitudinal (long spike bursts, high-frequency oscillations and tonic contractions) and the other from the circular layer (slow waves, short spike and phasic contractions). Simultaneous electrical records from the two muscle layers and the mucosa failed to show a consistent relationship between the mucosal record and the activity of either layer. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of intraluminally derived electrical recordings.", 
    "11": "We have investigated the effects of electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves on the output of mucus glycoproteins (mucins), radiolabelled with 3H and 35S, into the trachea of anaesthetized cats. In five control experiments, stimulation of the vagus nerves on four successive occasions, separated by 1 h, caused significant rises in the output of radiolabelled mucins. In these experiments repetition of stimulation did not appear to lessen the response. In a parallel series of five experiments the vagus nerves were again stimulated on four occasions, but atropine was administered in increasing doses between the stimuli. Large responses, not significantly less than those seen in the corresponding control stimulations, were seen even in the presence of the highest dose of atropine. In this series of experiments, however, the effect of the last vagal stimulation (with the highest dose of atropine) was significantly less then the first (no atropine). Administration of phentolamine and l-propranolol in addition to atropine failed to reduce the response to vagal stimulation significantly. We conclude that, while cholinergic nerves can probably explain part of the increase in mucin output which occurs with vagus nerve stimulation, there is a large response mediated by a non-cholinergic, non-adrenergic neurotransmitter. Possible neurotransmitters and the relationship of these findings to those of earlier studies are discussed.", 
    "12": "The effects of inert dusts administered into cat airways on the release of radiolabelled mucus glycoproteins (mucins) from an isolated tracheal segment have been investigated. Charcoal dust or barium sulphate powder, when placed in the segment, stimulated release of both 35S- and 3H-labelled mucins. The effect of dust was not significantly reduced after denervation of the segment. Charcoal dust, when added to the inspired air, caused an increase in release of mucins labelled with both radio-isotopes. Bilateral vagotomy significantly reduced this effect, but atropine and l-propranolol administered together did not. It is concluded that inert dust can stimulate tracheal mucin output both by a local mechanism and by activation of a reflex. The types of receptor that may be involved in the reflex, and the possible role of the mucotropic effects of dust in airway clearance, are discussed.", 
    "13": "Under fluothane anaesthesia, suction decerebration was performed at the immediate pre-pontine level in adult, male, Sprague-Dawley rats; this resulted in a large and sustained rise in rectal temperature from 35.6 +/- 0.2 (control) to 38.8 +/- 0.5 degrees C (decerebrate) following recovery from anaesthesia. Propranolol inhibited this rise. In a separate group of continuously (urethane) anaesthetized rats, brain transection at the immediate pre-pontine level produced marked increases in rectal temperature and oxygen consumption, both of which were inhibited by injection of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (10 mg/kg). The rise in rectal temperature (2.8 +/- 0.4 degrees C) after transection was preceded by a greater increase (3.6 +/- 0.3 degrees C) in the temperature of the interscapular brown adipose tissue (i.b.a.t.). Skin temperature on the tail showed no immediate response. In anaesthetized lean (+/?) male Zucker rats, rectal and i.b.a.t. temperatures showed similar responses to Sprague-Dawley rats after decerebration, but in the genetically obese (fa/fa) Zucker rat, temperatures were not significantly altered by decerebration. The above results, together with macroscopic examination of the transected brains, suggest that descending pathways (possibly arising in the mid-brain tegmentum) normally inhibit a sustained thermogenic drive from areas in the lower brain stem. Decerebration can release this inhibition and cause a large rise in body temperature and in metabolic rate, which apparently result from sympathetic activation of i.b.a.t. The genetically obese Zucker rat exhibits an impaired thermogenic response to decerebration.", 
    "14": "The efficacy of metoprolol, a new cardioselective beta-blocking drug, was compared with that of methyldopa in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension in a long-term study. A total of 25 patients received metoprolol in a maximum dose of 200 mg once daily; 30 patients received 500 mg methyldopa twice a day. Both groups of hypertensive patients had similar blood pressure upon entering the study (methyldopa: 182/110 mmHg; metoprolol: 180/110 mmHg). Two years after continuing therapy the blood pressures were similar (methyldopa: 142/90 mmHg; metoprolol: 145/90 mmHg). The great difference between the two drugs was the incidence and severity of side effects, here metoprolol offered a definite advantage.", 
    "15": "From a hemodynamic point of view, an adequate response to antihypertensive therapy would be restoration of a normal circulatory system. In most patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension considered to need drug therapy, the cardinal hemodynamic disturbance is an increased total peripheral resistance (TPR) and a normal or reduced cardiac output (CO). During a 10- to 17-year follow-up of untreated hypertensives, a gradual increase in TPR, increase in MAP, and a decrease in CO and stroke volume (SV) were seen. Hemodynamic responses to chronic drug therapy were studied at rest and during exercise in 250 men with mild to moderate essential hypertension in WHO Stage I. A significant reduction in TPR was seen on thiazide diuretics, nifedipine and verapamil, but there was no increase of subnormal CO or SV. A greater normalization of central hemodynamics was achieved by prazosin, which induced a reduction in TPR and an increase in CO and SV, particularly during exercise. In contrast, beta-blocker therapy was associated with a chronic reduction in CO and heart rate (HR) and usually no reduction in TPRI below pretreatment values. The chronic CO reduction was associated with an increase in arteriovenous oxygen difference. In 14 patients with therapy-resistant hypertension, a marked increase in TPR was found. Captopril induced a reduction in TPR with rest and exercise, and also a reduction in cardiac output. Prolonged therapy for 5 years with beta-blockers did maintain blood pressure control, but with no further decrease in TPR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "It has been demonstrated in experiments on rats that intraperitoneal injection of novodrine (1 mg/kg) produces an increase in the concentration of phosphatidylcholines and polyglycerophosphatides in myocardial tissue. Consecutive injection of obsidan (2 mg/kg) and novodrine in the same dose leads to more significant shifts in the phospholipid spectrum of the myocardium. The characteristic feature of which is a considerable lowering of the majority of phospholipid myocardial fractions.", 
    "17": "A method is described, intended for measuring the rate--over a short period of time--of aqueous humour outflow in non-anaesthetized primates. [125I] and [131I]-o-iodohippurates were infused s.c. at an interval into the conscious Cynomolgus monkey so as to give two time-displaced plasma curves. The isotope concentrations were measured in plasma by frequent sampling over the first 1-2 hr and in aqueous humour at the end of the experiment under brief anaesthesia. The coefficient of diffusion (kdiff) between plasma and aqueous, and the coefficient of loss (kout) out of the anterior chamber were calculated by making the usual assumptions about aqueous dynamics. Topical treatment of one eye with timolol consistently reduced kout, as expected, but many control values for kout were lower than expected or (impossibly) negative. Examination of the data reveals a likely source of error emanating from the commonly made assumption that diffusion of marker substance (in our case iodohippurate) from plasma to aqueous humour is proportional to the instantaneous concentration difference between plasma and aqueous. In fact, there may be a delay of several minutes during which the substance negotiates the stroma and anterior boundary layer of the iris. Evidence is presented that variation between and within individual monkeys may stem from the highly variable anatomy of the iris and from changes in sympathetic tone operating on the blood vessels and perhaps the anterior boundary layer.", 
    "18": "Specific bindings of [3H]clonidine and [3H]dihydroalprenolol [( 3H]DHA) to crude synaptic membranes were measured after cerebral cortical slices or synaptic membranes were pre-incubated with isoproterenol, 200 microM at 37 degrees C for 40 min, in 7- and 70-day-old rats. Isoproterenol caused a significant increase of the Bmax value of [3H]clonidine binding sites at both days 7 and 70, without changing the Kd. Scatchard analysis of [3H]clonidine binding to adult synaptic membranes which was examined by using a wide range of [3H]clonidine concentration (0.05-15 nM), showed that the Bmax in only high-affinity binding sites was 4-fold increased by pretreatment of synaptic membranes with isoproterenol 200 microM. In contrast, the Bmax of [3H]DHA binding sites was significantly reduced by isoproterenol at 7 and 70 days. These results suggest that the possible interrelationship between beta- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors which exists in synaptic membranes, matures by day 7 in the cerebral cortex of rats.", 
    "19": "In a balanced single-blind placebo controlled study in six hypertensive patients treated with diuretic and beta-adrenoceptor blocker, a single oral dose of 10 mg pinacidil lowered blood pressure significantly, by a maximum of 26/13 mm Hg lying and 15/12 mm Hg standing at 3 h. The duration of action was less than 6 h. Chronic treatment of four patients (mean dose 20 mg twice daily for 3--7 weeks) lowered blood pressure by only 15/7 mm Hg. All four patients experienced side-effects of the type often observed during treatment with potent vasodilators. In the formulation studied pinacidil is unlikely to offer any advantage over the antihypertensive drugs currently available.", 
    "20": "The forearm resistance vessels of men with primary hypertension respond to verapamil with a greater than normal dilatation relative to that induced by sodium nitroprusside. We have examined the effect on this functional abnormality of treatment with chlorthalidone (50 mg daily in 16 patients) and atenolol (100 mg daily in eight patients and 200 mg daily in two). The responsiveness of the forearm resistance vessels to local intra-arterial infusion of verapamil and sodium nitroprusside was assessed before treatment and again after a minimum of 1 month of drug therapy. Forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Chlorthalidone induced significant reductions in calculated mean arterial pressure, which fell from 135 +/- 4 to 117 +/- 4 mm Hg, and the dilator response to verapamil at 5 micrograms/min, which was reduced from 2.4 +/- 0.2 to 1.5 +/- 0.2 ml min-1 100 ml-1 forearm; the response to sodium nitroprusside at 3.2 micrograms/min was not significantly changed. Atenolol induced significant reductions in mean arterial pressure, which fell from 134 +/- 6 to 123 +/- 6 mm Hg, heart rate which fell from 72 +/- 3 to 55 +/- 2 beats/min, and response to verapamil at 5 micrograms/min which fell from 2.7 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.2 ml min-1 100 ml-1 forearm; the response to sodium nitroprusside was not significantly changed. Both drugs caused reversion towards normal of the relative enhancement of responsiveness to verapamil that was present before treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "Acebutolol was administered orally in a single dose of 200 mg to 17 individuals whose renal function varied markedly. The plasma half-life and elimination rate constant for acebutolol showed a four-fold variation but these did not correlate with the degree of renal impairment. However, there was a good correlation between the renal clearance of creatinine and that of acebutolol (P less than 0.001). The half-life and elimination rate of the acetyl metabolite, diacetolol, were subject to 10-fold inter-individual variability which correlated significantly with the creatinine clearance and serum creatinine concentration. The AUC for the acetyl metabolite showed a 40-fold individual variation which also correlated with renal function. It is concluded that renal elimination is the principal route of excretion for diacetolol but not the parent compound, acebutolol.", 
    "22": "The direct pulmonary vascular effects of amrinone, a nonglycoside, noncatechole cardiotonic agent were studied in conscious newborn lambs using a double-flow probe preparation that allows separation of direct and indirect pulmonary vascular effects. Amrinone was found to be a direct pulmonary vasodilator with a threshold dose of 0.3 mg/kg. Amrinone also increased cardiac output and decreased aortic pressure at somewhat higher threshold doses (1.0 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg, respectively). Amrinone's peak effect on pulmonary resistance appeared greater than its peak systemic effects. These effects were noted in both normoxia and hypoxia, and were not changed by pretreatment with propranolol.", 
    "23": "Recordings of multiunit sympathetic activity were made from muscle branches of the peroneal nerve in eight previously untreated subjects with essential hypertension during intravenous administration of the cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, metoprolol. Intraarterial blood pressure and central venous pressure were monitored simultaneously. After metoprolol, heart rate fell and central venous pressure increased in all subjects. Blood pressure increased in some subjects and decreased in others whereas the rate of rise of the systolic pulse wave regularly decreased. Sympathetic activity, discharged in pulse synchronous bursts of action potentials, was quantitated by counting the number of bursts and their amplitudes in the mean voltage neurogram. In all subjects, the average diastole was associated with outflow of more sympathetic impulses after metoprolol than before. Total sympathetic activity (expressed as bursts/min multiplied by mean burst strength) also increased after the drug. The mechanism behind the increase of sympathetic activity may be either a direct central nervous effect or a reflex effect elicited from arterial baroreceptors or cardiac receptors.", 
    "24": "This report investigates the contributions of the sympathetic nerves and adrenal medulla to resting mean arterial pressure (MAP) and to emotionally conditioned MAP and heart rate (HR) responses in unrestrained spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto normotensive control rats (WKY). Resting MAP (in mm Hg), which was higher in SHR (WKY = 120 +/- 4; SHR = 163 +/- 4; p less than 0.01), did not differ in the two strains following chemosympathectomy (WKY = 105 +/- 2; SHR = 101 +/- 2; n.s.). Adrenal medullectomy did not affect resting MAP in WKY (125 +/- 6; n.s.) but lowered it in SHR (146 +/- 5; p less than 0.05), relative to controls (see above). The conditioned pressor response (in mm Hg) in controls consisted of two peaks (I, II) in both strains, but was exaggerated in SHR (I = WKY, 13 +/- 1; SHR, 25 +/- 2; p less than 0.01; II = WKY 10 +/- 2; SHR 20 +/- 2; p less than 0.01). Chemosympathectomy suppressed (relative to controls) the first peak, but not the second, in both strains (WKY: I = 4 +/- 1, p less than 0.01; II = 12 +/- 2, n.s.; SHR: I = 6 +/- 1, p less than 0.01; II = 15 +/- 2, n.s.). Adrenal medullectomy alone had little effect on the pressor response, but when combined with chemosympathectomy both peaks were largely eliminated (WKY: I = 2 +/- I; II = 5 +/- 1; SHR: I = 1 +/- 0; II = 2 +/- 0). These data indicate that: 1) hypertension in conscious, freely behaving SHR is largely sustained by the sympathetic vasomotor nerves but that the adrenal medulla contributes to the magnitude of the elevation; 2) the early component of the exaggerated pressor response during aversive stimulation is mediated by sympathetic vasomotor excitation; and 3) the later component of the exaggerated pressor response reflects coactivation of the sympathetic vasomotor nerves and the adrenal medulla.", 
    "25": "A 69-yr-old man, who was concurrently being treated with pilocarpine nitrate and timolol maleate eye drops, developed a bradycardia and became hypotensive during halothane anaesthesia. Both timolol and pilocarpine were subsequently identified in a 24-h collection of urine. Timolol (but not pilocarpine) was detected in a sample of plasma removed during surgery; the plasma concentration of timolol (2.6 ng ml-1) was consistent with partial beta-adrenoceptor blockade. It is postulated that this action may have been enhanced during halothane anaesthesia with resultant bradycardia and hypotension. Pilocarpine may have had a contributory effect.", 
    "26": "To simulate increased sympathoadrenal activity adrenaline was infused in normotensive subjects to achieve plasma adrenaline concentrations similar to those seen after myocardial infarction or hypoglycaemia. Adrenaline was infused after pretreatment for five days with labetalol 200 mg twice daily or placebo given in a random order. The rise in systolic blood pressure and the fall in diastolic blood pressure observed after the infusion of adrenaline (0.06 micrograms/kg/min) were prevented by labetalol and no increase in blood pressure was seen. Adrenaline infusion after pretreatment with placebo caused a profound fall in the serum potassium concentration (4.12-3.20 mmol(mEq)/l). Pretreatment with labetalol completely blocked adrenaline induced hypokalaemia (3.92-3.95 mmol(mEq)/l). Adrenaline induced T wave flattening and QTc prolongation were also prevented by labetalol. Thus labetalol can prevent the electrocardiographic, haemodynamic, and hypokalaemic effects of increased circulating adrenaline in man. The combination of alpha and beta blockade appears to be required to block the haemodynamic effects of adrenaline, and labetalol may, therefore, be useful in controlling both the metabolic and circulatory responses during increased sympathoadrenal activity.", 
    "27": "A 34-year-old nursing woman with elevated intraocular pressure voluntarily and without our knowledge applied 0.5% timolol maleate twice daily to her right eye. A milk sample 1.5 hours after administration of drug showed a much higher level of timolol (5.6 ng/mL) than a plasma sample drawn at the same time (0.93 ng/mL). Three control milk specimens showed no measurable levels of timolol. The patient's milk sample 12 hours after her last timolol dose contained 0.5 ng/mL of timolol. On the basis of our calculations, timolol should be used with caution by nursing mothers.", 
    "28": "The febrile response of the New Zealand White rabbit in animals less than 1 yr old was compared with that in 3-yr-old animals. A reduced febrile response to both endotoxin and live bacteria injected intravenously was observed in the older group of animals. Peripheral vasoconstriction was observed, suggesting the drive to increase body temperature remained. Plasma catecholamines increased significantly in both groups of animals during fever. However, significantly greater increases in plasma epinephrine were observed in the older animals. A significant deficit in catecholamine-induced thermogenesis was observed in the older group of rabbits. This deficit alone does not explain the reduced febrile response, as beta-adrenergic blockade does not suppress the febrile response of young animals. Thus it is suggested that the primary deficit resulting in a reduced febrile response in the 3-yr-old rabbits is due to other age-related changes in the thermoregulatory system.", 
    "29": "The present study examined the effects of autonomic drugs and glucose on the insulin and glucose concentrations of sham-operated rats and of rats with ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) lesions and obesity. In the basal condition both epinephrine and atropine significantly decreased serum insulin levels in VMH-lesioned but not sham-operated rats. During glucose stimulation of insulin secretion in VMH-lesioned rats, epinephrine inhibited the increase of insulin by 83% and atropine inhibited it by 42%; whereas in sham-operated rats, epinephrine inhibited it by 70% and atropine inhibited it by 34%. Epinephrine with atropine completely blocked the increase of insulin in response to glucose in both VMH-lesioned and sham-operated rats. In the basal condition, epinephrine together with propranolol significantly decreased serum insulin levels in VMH-lesioned but not sham-operated rats. Epinephrine with phentolamine, on the other hand, markedly increased insulin in the VMH-lesioned rats and to a lesser degree in the sham-operated rats. During glucose stimulation epinephrine with propranolol inhibited the increase of insulin in both groups. Epinephrine with phentolamine or isoproterenol markedly increased serum insulin in VMH-lesioned rats. These results suggest that stimulation of the vagus nerve and increased sensitivity of the beta-receptors on the beta-cells of the islet contribute to the development of hyperinsulinemia. The sympathetic contribution may also be through suppression of alpha-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "30": "The effect of epinephrine on renal potassium excretion was examined in the rat. In group I KCl was infused acutely to increase plasma K (PK) by 2.0 meq/liter; urinary K excretion (UKV) rose by 1.22 mueq/min. In group II rats, which received a similar dose of KCl but with epinephrine, the increase in PK (delta = 0.8 meq/liter, P less than 0.001) was blunted and UKV was reduced (delta = 0.23 mueq/min, P less than 0.001). To determine whether the reduction in UKV resulted from the smaller increase in PK or from a direct action of epinephrine on renal K transport, a third group of animals received a lower dose of KCl. Despite similar PK levels, the epinephrine group excreted significantly less K in the urine (0.61 vs. 0.93 mueq/min). In group IV propranolol was infused with KCl; UKV was modestly increased. The effects of epinephrine on UKV were unrelated to changes in glomerular filtration rate, urine flow, or UNaV. Micropuncture results showed that at comparable PK levels epinephrine had no direct effect on K secretion by the distal tubule but indirectly inhibited K secretion in this nephron segment by reducing PK. In addition, epinephrine reduced K addition at tubular sites beyond the late distal tubule, most likely in the collecting tubule.", 
    "31": "Serious tachydysrhythmias occur in 10% to 30% of patients early after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). We studied the effects of digoxin and propranolol in preventing these dysrhythmias over the first week after CABG (average number of grafts, 2.7/patient). Consecutive patients (n = 179) undergoing CABG were randomized to a drug (group 1) or a control (group 2) group. Excluded were patients given digoxin before CABG and those with ejection fractions of less than 40%, those with dysrhythmias within 18 hr after CABG, those being pacer dependent, and those with low-output syndrome after CABG. Risk factors were comparable in both groups. Electrocardiographic examination showed perioperative myocardial infarction in five patients (2.8%). Digoxin (1 mg iv given over 24 hr, then 0.25 mg/day) and propranolol (10 mg given every 6 hr) were started 6 hr after CABG. Supraventricular dysrhythmias requiring treatment occurred in 3.4% of 89 group 1 patients and in 30% of 90 group 2 patients (p less than .001); ventricular dysrhythmias occurred in 1.1% of group 1 and 8.9% of group 2 patients (p less than .01). In this study, a regimen of post-CABG digoxin and propranolol significantly reduced the incidence of supraventricular and ventricular dysrhythmias without causing adverse reactions.", 
    "32": "The effect of combined treatment with nitrosorbide and obsidan on major hemodynamic parameters was studied in 47 myocardial infarction patients within the first 24 hours of the disease. Intravenous drip injection of 0.15 mg/kg obsidan simultaneously with the administration of 20 mg nitrosorbide reduced heart rate by 12.7%, systemic blood pressure by 23.5%, and diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure by 38.4%. The cardiac index decreased by 22.8%, mainly due to reduced heart rate. The treatment improved myocardial function as evidenced by and increased number of positive post-treatment \"functional curves\". This method is safe and efficient, provided it is applied under careful hemodynamic control.", 
    "33": "Molsidomine was compared with propranolol for anti-anginal efficacy in a double-blind, cross-over, fixed-dose clinical trial, involving 39 patients with moderate, stable angina pectoris, and objective evidence of coronary sclerosis. The incidence of anginal attacks under molsidomine did not differ statistically from that under propranolol. However, propranolol was more effective in reducing the nitroglycerin requirement at the doses used. Ergometry showed that both drugs increased exercise tolerance to a comparable extent. However the rate pressure product during exertion indicates that these drugs achieve this result via different paths, molsidomine having a nitrate-like effect. Unwanted effects during the four week treatment periods were minor and generally tolerable. Molsidomine is an effective long-acting anti-anginal agent with nitrate-like effects and should be a useful addition to the drugs already in use.", 
    "34": "The exercise responses to two different progressive, upright cycle ergometer tests were studied in nine healthy, young subjects either with no drug (ND) or following 48 h or oral propranolol (P) (40 mg q.i.d.). The ergometer tests increased work rate by 30 W either every 30 s or every 4 min. Propranolol caused a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in peak oxygen uptake (VO2) during both the 30-s and 4-min tests (30-s ND, 3949 +/- 718 mL X min-1 (means +/- SD); 30-s P, 3408 +/- 778 mL X min-1; 4-min ND, 4058 +/- 409 mL X min-1; 4-min P, 3725 +/- 573 mL X min-1). There was no difference between 30-s ND and 4-min ND for peak VO2. The ventilatory anaerobic threshold was not significantly different between any test (30-s ND, 2337 +/- 434 mL O2 X min-1; 30-s P, 2174 +/- 406 mL O2 X min-1; ND, 2433 +/- 685 mL O2 X min-1; 4-min P, 2296 +/- 604 mL O2 X min-1). The VO2 at which blood lactate had increased by 0.5 mM above resting levels was significantly lower than the ventilatory anaerobic threshold for the 4-min ND (1917 +/- 489) and the 4-min P (1978 +/- 412) tests, but was not different for the 30-s ND and 30-s P tests. At exhaustion in the progressive tests, the blood PCO2 was higher (p less than 0.05) in both 30-s tests than 4-min tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "The effect of long-term medical treatment in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is still controversial, and it is not clear whether propranolol or verapamil should be recommended in these patients. We therefore observed 49 patients (mean age 34.8 years) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and mostly mild obstruction for a mean follow-up period of 7.4 years. 13 patients died (10 suddenly and 3 in congestive heart failure) during the observation period (annual mortality rate 3.6%). According to medical treatment the patients were divided into 3 groups: group I consisted of 20 patients who received no medical treatment, group II of 15 patients receiving an average daily dose of 175 mg propranolol, and group III of 14 patients receiving an average daily dose of 360 mg verapamil. The mean follow-up was 6.4 years for group I, 7.0 years for group II, and 3.7 years for group III. 8 patients in group I died during the observation period (annual mortality rate 6.3%), 4 patients died in group II (annual mortality rate 3.8%), and 1 patient died in group III (annual mortality rate 1.8%). Functional limitation was similar in all 3 groups at the beginning and at the end of the study, and mean NYHA class was 1.9 in all 49 patients at the beginning and 1.8 at the end of the follow-up period. Left ventricular peak systolic and enddiastolic pressure were similar during heart catheterization (n = 41) in all 3 groups. Systolic outflow tract gradient at rest was 44 mmHg in group I, 32 mmHg in group II, and 11 mmHg in group III (difference not significant).

    "36": "We have previously reported that plasma factor VIII levels are elevated in hyperthyroidism and present here the effects of oral thyroid hormone and oral beta-adrenergic blockade on factor VIII in normal male volunteers. Oral levothyroxine in 14 volunteers and oral liothyronine in nine volunteers produced significant percentage increases in resting pulse and factor VIII-related activities (factor VIII coagulant activity, factor VIII-related antigen, and ristocetin co-factor activity). The addition of oral beta-adrenergic blockade significantly reduced or prevented elevations in resting pulse but not increases in factor VIII-related properties. These findings are discussed with reference to possible regulatory mechanisms for plasma factor VIII levels related to alterations in thyroid function.", 
    "37": "The aqueous extract of rat salivary submaxillary gland was found to contain three protein fractions activating the release of free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol from rat epididymal adipose tissue in vitro. Physico-chemical investigations of these proteins demonstrated certain common features: all three fractions were albumins having a common isoelectric point, and their aqueous solutions absorbed light at the same wavelength. The use of lipolysis activators and inhibitors (theophylline, propranolol, insulin) for investigating their effects on FFA and glycerol release produced by these protein fractions explained the mechanism of the lipolytic action of the protein fractions from rat submaxillary glands.", 
    "38": "The serum of hypothermic animals shows in vitro the ability of mobilizing fatty acids from the adipose tissue. This ability is quantitatively comparable to the lipolytic activity of glucagon but is lower than that of adrenaline. Propranolol decreases the lipid-mobilizing activity in the serum of hypothermic animals in vitro. Similarly insulin added to the medium with the serum of hypothermic animals decreased the lipid-mobilizing activity.", 
    "39": "Cigarette smoking is one of a number of environmental factors that contribute to interindividual variations in response to an administered drug. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons present in cigarette smoke induce hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and cytochrome P448 and increased levels of these enzymes are responsible for a higher metabolic clearance of drugs which are substrates for these enzymes. The clinical significance of this induction is greatest for those drugs with a low therapeutic index such as theophylline. In some cases a modification of the normal therapeutic dose is justified to maintain adequate control. The magnitude of the effect of cigarette smoking on the induction of hepatic metabolic activity has been linked with age for a number of drugs including theophylline, some benzodiazepines and propranolol. Generally, the inductive effect is smaller in the elderly but, as there is no direct correlation between chronological age and physiological age, it is imperative that age and smoking habits be treated as individual sources of intersubject variation in pharmacokinetics and that this be borne in mind in the evaluation of new drugs and the safe clinical use of existing ones.", 
    "40": "We have indirectly assessed the role of free fatty acids (FFA) and of hepatic ketogenesis in the regulation of ketone body levels in euthyroid and hyperthyroid subjects. All studies were performed under controlled dietary conditions (35 and 45 kcal/kg body weight/day respectively for euthyroid and hyperthyroid subjects). In the post-absorptive state hyperthyroid patients had normal, glucagon levels and, in spite of increased insulinemia (p less than 0.02), elevated concentrations of blood glucose (p less than 0.01), glycerol (p less than 0.001) and ketone bodies (p less than 0.05). In the face of this hyperketonaemia, there was no significant increase of plasma FFA, suggesting possible increased hepatic conversion of FFA to ketone bodies. However, when FFA were acutely raised to high levels, the induced rise of ketone bodies was similar in hyperthyroid and euthyroid subjects. Oral propranolol administration to hyperthyroid patients in the post-absorptive state decreased the concentrations of glycerol (p less than 0.05) and ketone bodies (p less than 0.05) without altering insulin concentrations. Ketone bodies fell without any significant decrease of FFA suggesting a possible direct effect of propranolol administration on hepatic ketogenesis. However, the ketone body response to raised FFA levels was unaffected by propranolol. We have evidence in hyperthyroid patients of increased lipolysis and ketogenesis in spite of increased daily caloric intake. These results suggest that these metabolic abnormalities are not merely due to relative starvation. We have tentative evidence for modification of the intra-hepatic conversion of FFA to ketone bodies in the post-absorptive state but no supporting evidence when FFA levels were experimentally raised.",

Good clinical effect was achieved in 81% of patients with angina of effort and 64% of patients with angina of effort and angina at rest. Exercise tolerance increased in half of the patients.

Effects of this drug on the aggregation induced by usual aggregation agents, and on the prostacyclin generating capacity of rat aorta as assessed by its antiaggregation effect were also studied. The following results were obtained. 1. Reduced generation of thromboxane and HHT in platelets was observed at 1 mM conc. of the drug. 2. This drug inhibited ADP-, collagen-, and epinephrine-induced aggregation in a dose dependent manner. 3. Arachidonate-induced aggregation was only slightly inhibited at 1 mM conc. of labetalol. 4. Aorta and lung synthesized more prostacyclin in its presence from exogenous labelled arachidonate. 5. Aorta synthesized more prostacyclin from its endogenous AA pool in the presence of labetalol as assessed by inhibition of platelet aggregation.",

    "44": "In hypertension, irrespective of its underlying etiology, the baseline pretreatment renin-sodium profile predicts the antihypertensive action or the lack of it for five major types of antihypertensive drugs: 1) diuretic agents; 2) beta-receptor blockers; 3) converting-enzyme inhibitors; 4) the alpha 1 postsynaptic blocker, prazosin; and 5) the calcium channel blockers, verapamil and nifedipine. Moreover, vigorous compensatory activation of the renin-angiotensin system in response to therapy often explains initial drug ineffectiveness or resistance to treatment by diuretics and nonspecific vasodilators. This correlation between renin system behavior and antihypertensive drug efficacy likely reflect basic pharmacologic-physiologic interactions. This correlation is also observed in congestive heart failure without hypertension, where operant renin-aldosterone profiles may help to explain both drug efficacy and drug resistance to commonly administered therapeutic agents. Accordingly, a control system analysis of the renin axis has broad applications in therapy. The analysis is also conceptually significant since it exposes the operation of fundamentally different mechanisms of increased vascular resistance to flow occurring in different patients with hypertension or heart failure. One form is renin-angiotensin-mediated whereas the other, in the absence of renin, is associated with sodium-volume excess and/or abnormal alpha-adrenergic and calcium channel activity. Further definition of these two mechanisms of increased peripheral resistance could lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of some forms of essential hypertension and congestive heart failure.", 
    "45": "The activity of the renin-angiotensin system was measured before, during, and after infrarenal aortic cross-clamping in 13 patients. Five of the patients studied were taking propranolol preoperatively and formed a subgroup. Intraoperative blood loss, volume of crystalloid and colloid infused, haemodynamic parameters and urine output were similar for the two groups. In eight patients who were not taking propranolol mean plasma renin activity was 2.24 ng . ml-1 . hr-1 prior to induction, 3.78 ng . ml-1 . hr-1 during surgery prior to cross-clamping and 4.42 ng X ml-1 X hr-1 15 minutes after the aorta was cross-clamped (increases not statistically significant). Mean plasma renin activity measured ten minutes prior to release of the cross-clamp (5.02 ng X ml-1 . hr-1), 15 minutes after clamp release (5.47 ng X ml-1 X hr-1), and 30 minutes after reaching the recovery room (5.84 ng X ml-1 X hr-1) were significantly greater than preinduction levels. Four patients developed postoperative hypertension (mean blood pressure greater than 120 mmHg); there was not a correlation between the elevated plasma renin activity observed postoperatively and the occurrence of postoperative hypertension. The five patients taking propranolol had a markedly attenuated renin activity response during and after surgery; the mean plasma renin activity was less than 1.5 ng X ml-1 X hr-1 at all sampling times. Two of these five patients did develop postoperative hypertension. It is concluded that surgery involving infrarenal aortic cross-clamping is associated with increased plasma renin activity with peak levels occurring postoperatively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "Survivors of myocardial infarction who have been discharged from the hospital face an increasing cumulative risk of suffering another infarction or death. beta-Adrenergic blocking agents have undergone various trials to reduce these risks and prolong life. Although earlier trials have shown conflicting results, recent studies have conclusively demonstrated the beneficial role of this class of drugs in reducing the chances of recurrent infarction and death. These studies are briefly reviewed and appropriate conclusions as well as recommendations are made.", 
    "47": "The direct histochemical detection of beta-blocker binding sites was studied in sections of rat kidney using an immunohistochemical technique developed in our laboratory. Frozen sections of rat kidney were incubated in a solution of (-)alprenolol, washed, exposed to fluorescent (-)alprenolol antibodies (FAA) and then observed at a fluorescence microscope. Strong fluorescence was found within the wall of renal artery and vein, but primarly in the artery. At the level of blood vessels (-)alprenolol binding sites were located chiefly in the media and in the intima. The renal glomerulus, the loop of Henle and collecting tubules appear to be free of any fluorescence. Consequently they do not have beta-adrenoceptors. On the contrary, the glomerular afferent and afferent arterioles, the cellular elements of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, proximal and distal convoluted tubules, are rich in (-)alprenolol binding sites. At higher magnifications the immunoreactivity appears to be located in the basal membrane of cellular elements which indicates that (-)alprenolol binding sites are membrane receptors. The direct immunohistochemical detection of beta-blocker binding sites in the kidney may offer useful information concerning the site of action of beta-blockers at the level of an important target organ for this class of drugs.", 
    "48": "The effect of propranolol on hypotonic erythrocyte hemolysis was investigated in normal subjects and coronary patients. In the latter, erythrocytes were shown to have much smaller osmotic stability as compared to the former. Propranolol's in vitro antihemolyzing effect is more pronounced in patients with acute myocardial infarction and angina pectoris as compared to normal subjects. antihemolyzing effect of propranolol is reduced if it is preceded by the administration of beta-adrenoblockers in myocardial infarction. It is suggested that propranolol's antihemolyzing effect be used for the assessment of beta-adrenoreceptor function.", 
    "49": "By perfusing the isthmic segment of the rabbit oviduct in vivo at low hydrostatic pressures with Ringer's solution (+38 degrees C), the resistance of the isthmic segment could be measured quantitatively using a drop-recording system. Transisthmic flow, from mid-tube to the uterine end, was thus studied in 45 animals, 48 h after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injection. Stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors by administration of norepinephrine or phenylephrine to the perfusate resulted in an immediate reduction or cessation of the basal flow. The duration of this effect varied dose-dependently. The administration of beta-adrenoceptor agonists (isoprenaline, prenalterol or terbutaline) markedly increased transisthmic flow. The beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline was considerably more potent than the other beta-agonists. Thus, it seems that the isthmic contraction caused by adrenergic luminal stimulation is mediated via alpha-adrenoceptors, while the isthmic dilation is mediated via beta-adrenoceptors, mainly of the beta 2-type.", 
    "50": "The sleeping time induced by thiopentone in rats was markedly prolonged by the (-)-isomer of propranolol while the (+)-isomer was virtually without effect. Since the two isomers are equipotent in their membrane-stabilizing effects but the (-)-isomer is about seven to ten times more potent than the (+)-isomer in beta-blockade this suggests that the potentiation of barbiturate sleeping time is due to blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors. The centrally active beta-agonist, clenbuterol, shortened thiopentone-induced sleeping time in a dose-dependent fashion while the beta-agonist, salbutamol, which fails to cross the blood-brain barrier, was without effect. This suggests a central locus of action. Destruction of the noradrenaline system in the locus coeruleus with 6-hydroxydopamine prevented the effect of a racemic mixture of propranolol in elevating thiopentone-induced sleeping time, thus confirming a noradrenergic mechanism and indicating that the coerulear, rather than the medullary, noradrenaline fibres were involved. Thiopentone-induced sleeping time was potentiated by the selective beta 2 blocker ICI 118551 but not by the selective beta 1 blocker, metoprolol, thus characterizing the relevant beta-receptor type as beta.", 
    "51": "The influences of various monoaminergic agents on the immobility-reducing action of desipramine (DMI) in the forced swimming test were examined. 5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine and methysergide, a serotonin agonist and antagonist, respectively, did not affect the duration of immobility. Pimozide, a dopamine antagonist, prolonged the duration of immobility at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. However, at the doses tested, these drugs had no effect on the action of desipramine. Phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, prolonged the duration of immobility only with the largest dose (20 mg/kg), but the action of desipramine was completely blocked by this drugs at all doses. Intracerebroventricular injection of a beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (ISO), and two selective beta 1-adrenergic antagonists, atenolol (ATE) and practolol, dose-dependently diminished and potentiated, respectively, the action of desipramine although these drugs had no effect on the duration of immobility when given alone. A beta 2-adrenergic antagonist derived from oximino-9-fluorene, (IPS 339) did not influence the duration of immobility or affect the action of desipramine. The effect of isoproterenol was almost completely blocked by the pretreatment with atenolol and practolol but not by IPS 339. Subcutaneously-injected isoproterenol did not affect the action of desipramine. Isoproterenol and atenolol had no effect on the concentration of desipramine in brain regions. Phenylephrine, a postsynaptic alpha-adrenergic agonist, reduced the duration of immobility as did desipramine, but this action was not affected by isoproterenol and atenolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "This study was conducted to investigate the association between estradiol-17 beta (E2 beta) and periarterial alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors in altering blood flow to the bovine uterus. Three nonpregnant Hereford cows were ovariectomized, and an electromagnetic blood flow transducer was placed around the middle uterine artery supplying one uterine horn. A catheter was then placed into a branch of the same artery for infusion of drugs or vehicle. Beginning 3 wk after surgery, uterine blood flow (UBF) of each cow was recorded for 5 min at 20-min intervals throughout a 160-min period three times weekly for 6 wk. Vehicle (.9% NaCl), phentolamine (PHEN, 1 or 10 micrograms) or propranolol (PROP, 1 or 10 micrograms) was infused for 5 min beginning 20 min after the initial UBF measurements, while vehicle or E2 beta (1 microgram) was infused for 5 min beginning at 40 min. Within a week, the first and third 160-min periods contained the same treatment (vehicle or E2 beta), and the second period consisted of vehicle or E2 beta plus PHEN or PROP, allowing for direct comparison of periods 1 and 3 with period 2. Twenty minutes after infusion of E2 beta, UBF was elevated (26.8 +/- 5.4 ml/min; P less than .05) over baseline, reaching a maximal increase at 40 min before starting to decline by 120 min. Uterine blood flow increased (39.2 +/- 7.6 ml/min; P less than .01) during the 5-min infusion of PHEN, and thereafter the magnitude and pattern were similar to those resulting from E2 beta treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) have been found to have a heightened hyperglycemic response to epinephrine. To determine if patients with IDDM have increased sensitivity of cellular beta 2-adrenergic receptor-effector systems, we assessed beta 2-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase sensitivities to isoproterenol in partially purified mononuclear leukocyte (MNL) plasma membranes from 10 patients with IDDM (without adrenergic neuropathy) and 10 matched nondiabetic controls. MNL beta 2-adrenergic receptor densities (Bmax = 48 +/- 8 fmol [3H] DHA/mg protein in IDDM, 44 +/- 3 fmol [3H] DHA/mg protein in controls) and binding affinities (apparent KD = 0.3 +/- 0.07 nM in IDDM, 0.3 +/- 0.04 nM in controls) did not differ. Further, MNL adenylate cyclase activities were not significantly different either at baseline (325 +/- 86 pmol/mg protein/15 min in IDDM, 275 +/- 49 pmol/mg protein/15 min in controls) or in response to isoproterenol (842 +/- 229 pmol/mg protein/15 min in IDDM, 608 +/- 86 pmol/mg protein/15 min in controls). Thus, the data do not support the presence of a generalized alteration of beta-adrenergic receptors or adenylate cyclase sensitivity in IDDM. To the extent that MNL beta 2-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase activities reflect those of extravascular catecholamine target cells, these findings suggest that the heightened hyperglycemic response to epinephrine exhibited by patients with IDDM is not due to increased sensitivity of cellular beta 2-adrenergic receptor-effector systems and is best attributed to the altered hormonal milieu of the insulin-deficient state.", 
    "54": "beta-Antiadrenergic properties are part of the pharmacological characteristics of amiodarone. In the present study, the action of amiodarone on rat-heart beta-adrenoceptors was investigated. [125I]Cyanopindolol (CYP) was used to label beta-adrenoceptors in crude rat-heart microsomes. In competition binding experiments, amiodarone up to 10(-6) M did not displace [125I]CYP from cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors. The effects of amiodarone on the number and affinity for [125I]CYP of beta-adrenoceptors were evaluated in saturation experiments. In vitro exposure of cardiac microsomes to 10(-5) M amiodarone did not modify these parameters. At higher concentrations the beta-receptor number decreased while the affinity for [125I]CYP was not affected. In vivo experiments showed a significant decrease in beta-adrenoceptor density after a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg amiodarone. In chronically treated animals, the same decrease in beta-receptor number was observed 24 hr after the last administration of the drug. 5'-Nucleotidase activity, another specific marker of the plasma membrane, was unaffected by the treatment. These results suggest that part of the beta-adrenergic antagonism of amiodarone is due to a decrease in the beta-adrenoceptor density at the surface of the myocardial cell.", 
    "55": "To assess a possible mechanism for the enhanced thermogenesis of cold-acclimated and winter-acclimatized red-backed voles (Clethrionomys rutilus), beta-adrenergic receptors of brown fat were characterized by specific binding of (-)-[3H]-dihydroalprenolol [( 3H]DHA) to isolated brown fat membranes from 23 degrees C-acclimated controls, cold-acclimated (5 wk or 5 mo at 5 degrees C), wild summer, and winter-acclimatized voles. Scatchard analysis to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) for control brown fat membranes gave a Kd of 4.45 nM [3H]DHA and Bmax of 249 fmol [3H]DHA bound per milligram of protein. beta-Adrenergic agonists competed for specific binding sites with an order of potency typical of the beta 1 subtype of adrenergic receptors: (-)-isoproterenol greater than (-)-norepinephrine greater than or equal to (-)-epinephrine. After cold acclimation for 5 wk or 5 mo, the Kd and Bmax for adrenergic binding sites were similar to those of controls. Brown fat mass was 1.5 times greater than that of controls after 5 wk cold acclimation but similar to controls after 5 mo cold acclimation. Winter voles had 1.7 times higher Bmax and 1.6 times more brown fat than summer voles. Thus seasonal acclimatization to winter in red-backed voles appears to involve an increase in beta-adrenergic receptors in brown fat, but cold acclimation does not. The results suggest quantitative and possibly qualitative differences in neural and hormonal stimulation of brown fat between cold acclimation and winter acclimatization in voles.", 
    "56": "Although methacholine (MCh) and a Ca2+ ionophore A23187 do not enhance the tissue adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) level by themselves, they markedly potentiate isoproterenol (ISO)-induced tissue cAMP accumulation in isolated simian eccrine sweat glands in a dose-dependent manner. The agonist concentration producing 50% of the maximal response of such a potentiated cAMP accumulation was 2.1 X 10(-7) M for MCh, 2.5 X 10(-7) M for ISO, and 2.9 X 10(-6) M for A23187. Unlike cAMP accumulation induced by ISO alone, MCh-stimulated ISO-induced cAMP accumulation is dependent on extracellular Ca2+. MCh- plus ISO-induced cAMP level is tripled by 10(-2) M theophylline (TH), and while the ISO-induced cAMP level was also elevated by TH, it was not enhanced to the level of ISO-plus MCh-induced cAMP accumulation, indicating that phosphodiesterase inhibition is not the major mechanism for the augmentative effect of MCh. The augmentative effect of MCh was seen only in the secretory portion, whereas that of A23187 was seen in both the secretory portion and the duct. The data suggest that MCh-induced augmentation of ISO-stimulated cAMP accumulation is due to increased cAMP formation, not decreased cAMP degradation, and that it may be mediated by an elevated intracellular Ca2+.", 
    "57": "A series of five epimeric pairs of naltrexone derivatives that contain an electrophilic substituent at the 6 alpha- or 6 beta-position was synthesized and tested on the guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations in order to determine if the orientation of the electrophile is important for covalent bonding to opioid receptors. In the GPI all compounds were pharmacologically active as reversible agonists, but only the 6 beta-isomers of the fumaramate ester 2b (beta-FNA) and isothiocyanate 6b exhibited covalent reactivity, involving a selective irreversible antagonism of the mu agonist, morphine, without affecting kappa agonists. The 6 alpha-isomer 2a (alpha-FNA) was itself nonalkylating but was able to protect the GPI against alkylation by its epimer, beta-FNA, indicating that the two epimers bind to the same receptor. These results suggest that the proper orientation of the electrophilic substituent is required for covalent bonding with a proximal nucleophile in the case of mu receptor blockade. Moreover, the lack of covalent bonding to kappa receptors by these or other ligands in this series indicates the possible absence of sufficiently reactive nucleophiles on this recognition site. In the MVD, 2b, but not 2a, irreversibly antagonized morphine (as in GPI), whereas neither epimer exhibited irreversible antagonism toward the delta agonist, [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE). In contrast, both of the isothiocyanate epimers (6a,b) irreversibly blocked mu and delta receptors. Evidence suggesting differences between mu receptors in the MVD and GPI was obtained with the beta-iodoacetamide 5b, which was an irreversible blocker of morphine only in the MVD. When analyzed together with those of previous studies with the nitrogen mustard analogues, alpha- and beta-chlornaltrexamine, the data suggest that the receptor-alkylating ability of each isomer in an epimeric pair differs most when the electrophile possesses a narrow spectrum of reactivity.", 
    "58": "Hormone sensitivity to epinephrine or histamine of the adenylate cyclase system in pig skin is very labile to homogenization. We have developed a new adenylate cyclase receptor-mediated assay system with trypsinized epidermal cells which are treated with hypotonic shock. This new assay system maintained the hormonal sensitivity, as both epinephrine and histamine clearly stimulated cyclic AMP production. Moreover, the Ka for each hormone on this system was similar to that obtained from the floating pig skin slice system. Receptor-adenylate cyclase unit (coupling) in this assay system is therefore preserved as it occurs in intact tissue or cells. Because of the \"leaky\" nature of our preparation, phosphorylated compounds such as GTP and its analogue and NaF can penetrate the cell membrane and stimulate cyclic AMP production. In this system refractoriness is still maintained to subsequent stimulation by a receptor activator, and cholera toxin can be shown to dramatically increase the activity of GTP on the GTP binding protein, presumably by preventing GTP hydrolysis.", 
    "59": "Topical 2% l- or d-timolol reduced the elevation of intraocular pressure induced by water-loading in conscious rabbits. This drug effect appeared on the peak elevation (in pigmented eyes) and on the down-phase (in albino and pigmented eyes) of elevated intraocular pressure. The contralateral eye and the treated eye responded similarly. In urethane anesthetized, water-loaded rabbits, a greater inhibitory effect of l-timolol was observed in pigmented eyes than in albino eyes. Two per cent l-timolol caused alterations of heart rate and arterial blood pressure in water-loaded anesthetized rabbits, but time courses of these alterations did not correlate with the inhibitory effect on the elevation of intraocular pressure. The beta-adrenergic antagonistic activity of l-timolol and d-timolol were compared by their ability to inhibit l-isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP synthesis in the rabbit iris-ciliary body preparation in vitro. The I50S for l- and d-timolol differ by about 1.5 log units. In our studies, d-timolol has little of the intraocular pressure lowering and the beta-adrenergic antagonistic activity of l-timolol. Thus, the conscious, water-loaded, pigmented rabbit can be used as a model for studying the effects of beta-adrenergic antagonists on intraocular pressure.", 
    "60": "Intracerebroventricular injections of selective opioid agonists were used to investigate the role of opiate receptor subtypes in cardiovascular function in awake rats. The mu-agonist (D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly5-ol)enkephalin (1 nmol) caused a prolonged increase in blood pressure and an initial decrease followed by a delayed increase in heart rate. These effects were antagonized by the selective mu-antagonist beta-funaltrexamine. A selective delta-agonist (dimeric tetrapeptide enkephalin) was devoid of cardiovascular effects at 10 nmol, whereas a benzomorphan kappa-agonist MRZ caused a pressor response which was not antagonized by beta-funaltrexamine. The mechanisms by which opioids elicit cardiovascular effects were analyzed in detail by using microinjections into the anterior hypothalamic area. Low doses of enkephalin produced increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Associated elevations of plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine, but not vasopressin, suggested a stimulation of sympatho-adrenomedullary pathways. Higher doses caused increases in blood pressure but decreases in heart rate. Peripheral vagal blockade with atropine methyl nitrate caused a large sudden rise in heart rate, indicating that an increased vagal outflow counteracted the sympathetic activation. Adrenal demedullated rats displayed no tachycardia after anterior hypothalamic injection of low doses of enkephalin, whereas high dose caused pronounced bradycardia. Additional treatment of demedullated rats with the sympathetic blocker bretylium led to severe hypotension in addition to bradycardia. These data provide evidence that mu-opiate receptors primarily mediate cardiovascular effects of opiates in awake rats. At low doses, a sympathetic adrenomedullary activation occurs, whereas higher doses additionally activate parasympathetic efferents, both possibly from anterior hypothalamic sites.", 
    "61": "Aldosterone binds to two renal cytosol receptors, one with high affinity and low capacity (Type I or mineralocorticoid) and another with lower affinity but greater capacity (Type II or glucocorticoid receptor). One of the ways to study Type I receptors isolated from Type II receptors is to block the latter with a steroid which shows high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and low affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor. Dexamethasone has been used widely for this purpose but previous investigations and this study have found that dexamethasone competes with [3H]aldosterone for Type I receptor binding with a relative activity of 26% that of aldosterone and therefore is less than ideal as a glucocorticoid receptor blocker. RU-26988 (11 beta, 17 beta-dihydroxy-17 alpha-pregnane-1,4,6-trien-20-yn-21-methyl-3-one) is a recently synthesized glucocorticoid that shows very low affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor. RU-26988 competes with [3H]aldosterone and [3H]2 alpha-methyl-9 alpha-fluorocortisol, a powerful mineralocorticoid, for the cytosol receptor from renal slices of adrenalectomized rats with a relative potency of less than 0.5% in comparison to unlabeled aldosterone and 2 alpha-methyl-9 alpha-fluorocortisol. RU-26988 has over twice the ability of unlabeled dexamethasone to compete with [3H]dexamethasone for binding to the renal cytosol glucocorticoid receptor. Scatchard analysis of [3H]aldosterone binding to rat renal cytosol showed two receptors, one with a calculated dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.81 X 10(-9) M and a second with a calculated Kd of 3.33 X 10(-8) M. The addition of a 100-fold concentration of RU-26988 produced a single line with a Kd of 5.02 X 10(-10) M indicating that the specific blocking of the glucocorticoid receptors allows an accurate determination of the kinetic parameters of the mineralocorticoid receptor by itself. Scatchard analysis of [3H]2 alpha-methyl-9 alpha-fluorocortisol binding produced a straight line with a Kd of 3.7 X 10(-9) M, such as would be produced if it were binding to only one single class of receptors. However, when an excess of RU-26988 was added to block the glucocorticoid receptor, a different straight line was produced by Scatchard's analysis with a Kd of 3.78 X 10(-10) M. Whereas the explanation for this is not apparent, it may be that the much larger concentration of glucocorticoid receptors, for which 2 alpha-methyl-9 alpha-fluorocortisol also has a very great affinity, masks the binding to the mineralocorticoid receptors.", 
    "62": "Prizidilol (SK&F 92657), a new combined precapillary vasodilator and nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, was given to 19 patients with essential hypertension. Following placebo (4 weeks, single-blind), patients were randomly assigned to receive either 200 or 400 mg prizidilol once daily. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured every second week for 12 weeks, 24 h after drug administration. In patients with inadequate blood pressure response the dosage was then increased to 400 mg twice daily for 4 additional weeks. In this study prizidilol given once daily did not effectively reduce systolic blood pressure for 24 h, but when given twice daily (400 mg X 2), it had an effective antihypertensive effect. Plasma concentrations of prizidilol were generally low 24 h after drug intake, and there was no significant correlation between blood pressure reduction and plasma concentration.", 
    "63": "Milrinone (Win 47203) is a potent cardiac bipyridine with inotropic and vasodilator properties. Its effects were studied in anesthetized and unanesthetized dogs and in isolated cardiac tissues from guinea pigs. In the anesthetized dog, the intravenous injection of milrinone (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) increased cardiac contractile force (CF) (23 +/- 6.1 to 87 +/- 8.9%), maximum left ventricular pressure development (24 +/- 5.8 to 119 +/- 16.1%), and cardiac output (16 +/- 4.5 to 33 +/- 8.9%), with less than a 30% increase in heart rate (HR). Significant decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were seen at 0.3-3 mg/kg i.v. Oral doses of milrinone (0.1-1.0 mg/kg), in unanesthetized dogs, increased cardiac CF by 35 +/- 7.0 to 99 +/- 17.0%, with a maximum increase in HR of 40 +/- 7.1% and no significant change in blood pressure. Milrinone was effective in the presence of ouabain and dopamine without enhancing their arrhythmogenic properties. It was also effective in reversing propranolol-, verapamil-, or pentobarbital-induced heart failure. The inotropic response does not seem to involve the stimulation of the autonomic receptors, the release of endogenous catecholamines, histamine, or prostaglandins, or the inhibition of Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase. Milrinone is an inhibitor or cardiac adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase, with resultant increases in cardiac cAMP levels. However, the time course for this increase does not seem to correspond to the increase in muscle developed tension, and, therefore, it is unlikely to be responsible for the initiation of the inotropic response. Milrinone is a potent cardioactive agent which should be beneficial in the treatment of acute and chronic congestive heart failure.", 
    "64": "The time course of changes in supine and standing blood pressures, heart rate, plasma renin activity, and plasma noradrenaline concentration after intravenous administration of propranolol (0.20 mg . kg-1, with a maximum of 15 mg) or furosemide (40 mg) was studied for a period of 8 h in hypertensive patients. Twenty minutes after intravenous injection of propranolol or furosemide, supine blood pressure was unchanged. Thereafter, blood pressure started to decrease gradually. Maximum reduction was obtained after 4-5 h. Twenty minutes after administration of propranolol, heart rate and plasma renin activity were reduced, and remained so during the following 8 h. Supine plasma noradrenaline concentration did not change significantly after propranolol, but standing levels, showed a tendency to increase as blood pressure fell. Twenty minutes after administration of furosemide, plasma renin activity was increased and remained elevated during the following 8 h. Heart rate and plasma noradrenaline concentration were unchanged after 20 min, but both increased gradually as blood pressure started to fall. The results show that intravenous administration of both propranolol and furosemide leads to a delayed reduction of blood pressure. The increase in total peripheral resistance, which prevents blood pressure from falling acutely after intravenous injection of propranolol, is not reflected in an acute rise in plasma noradrenaline. The delayed hypotensive response does not seem to be due to a return of sympathetic activity to pretreatment levels, since plasma noradrenaline concentration shows a tendency to rise as blood pressure falls.", 
    "65": "Ischemia was induced by lowering the afterload pressure of the perfused working rat heart, and continued until the heart was reperfused by raising the after load. After ischemia, the following changes were observed: decreases in the pressure-rate product (peak aortic pressure X heart rate) and coronary flow; depletion of adenosine triphosphate and creating phosphate; and accumulation of lactate. When the heart was exposed to ischemia for more than 20 min, reperfusion of the ischemic heart could not restore the pressure-rate product and the tissue adenosine triphosphate completely, suggesting that irreversible ischemic damage occurred. Diltiazem (2.41 X 10(-6), 1.21 X 10(-5), and 2.41 X 10(-5) M) or propranolol (1.69 X 10(-5) and 3.38 X 10(-5) M) was provided for the heart 5 min before the onset of ischemia. In the presence of diltiazem or propranolol, the levels of adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate were preserved even after 20 min of ischemia. Reperfusion with the normal perfusate after 20 min of ischemia. Reperfusion with the normal perfusate after 20 min of ischemia with the buffer containing diltiazem or propranolol recovered the pressure-rate product that had been decreased by ischemia, depending on the concentration of diltiazem or propranolol provided. These results indicate that diltiazem, as well as propranolol, delays the onset of irreversible ischemic damage of the heart, suggesting their protective effects on the ischemic myocardium.", 
    "66": "The role of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in preventing ventricular fibrillation in a conscious canine model of sudden coronary death was examined using d,l-nadolol and the non-beta-adrenergic receptor blocking isomer, d-nadolol. On day 4, after a temporary 90-min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, an anodal current of 150 microA was applied to the intimal surface of the left circumflex coronary artery. Occlusive or nonocclusive thrombosis of the artery was accompanied by ST-segment changes. In saline-treated animals (n = 15), ST-segment changes were followed by sinus tachycardia and QT-segment prolongation, with development of ventricular premature beats. Ventricular fibrillation developed in 14 animals (93%). Pretreatment with 1 (n = 9) or 8 mg/kg d,l-nadolol (n = 13) did not alter the development of left circumflex coronary artery thrombosis and ischemic ST-segment changes, but decreased the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and increased survival at 24 h (56% and 63%, respectively) (p less than 0.01 versus saline). d,l-Nadolol also attenuated the sinus tachycardia and QT-interval prolongation accompanying acute ischemia. d-Nadolol (1 mg/kg), the non-beta-adrenergic receptor blocking isomer, failed to prevent development of ST-segment changes. Sinus tachycardia and QT-interval prolongation were not prevented, and ventricular fibrillation developed in all eight animals (100%). In animals without previously induced anterior myocardial ischemic injury (n = 10), left circumflex coronary artery thrombosis failed to produce sinus tachycardia and QT-interval prolongation and was associated with a lower incidence of ventricular fibrillation (20%, p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "The effects of prizidilol, a novel antihypertensive agent with vasodilator and beta-adrenoceptor blocking actions, were compared with those of hydralazine and propranolol in conscious dogs with chronic atrioventricular block. Prizidilol significantly increased atrial rate, mainly through reflex reduction of atrial vagal tone in response to its hypotensive effect. Hydralazine also significantly raised atrial rate, while propranolol did not affect it. Prior administration of pindolol, which raised atrial rate to a degree comparable to that achieved with prizidilol and hydralazine, entirely suppressed the atrial tachycardiac effects of both drugs. Prizidilol did not affect ventricular rate on average, whereas hydralazine raised it and propranolol lowered it, both significantly. In some dogs, prizidilol raised ventricular rate like hydralazine; in others, it lowered it like propranolol. In both cases, variation was related to basal ventricular rate. The pattern of these effects was the same as that observed with pindolol. Prior treatment with pindolol almost suppressed the ventricular chronotropic effects of prizidilol, apparently through beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "68": "The technique of electrical field stimulation was employed to stimulate the intrinsic nerves of isolated rat parotid gland fragments. Responses to field stimulation were recorded as changes in enzyme secretion (amylase release), radiolabelled ion fluxes (86Rb efflux) and electrophysiological effects (changes in acinar cell membrane potential and input resistance). All effects of field stimulation were abolished by the neurotoxin, tetrodotoxin (TTX). Selective use of pharmacological antagonists revealed that both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves to this tissue were being excited by field stimulation. Importantly a significant component of the response to field stimulation persisted in the presence of combined autonomic receptor blockade by atropine, phentolamine and propranolol, i.e. due to release of a non-cholinergic, non-adrenergic neurotransmitter. The non-cholinergic, non-adrenergic neurotransmitter evoked amylase release, 86Rb efflux and electrophysiological effects seen as changes in acinar cell membrane potential and conductance, i.e. stimulus-permeability coupled. Two biologically active peptides, substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) were shown to evoke amylase release in the presence of combined autonomic blockade. VIP however did not evoke any increase in 86Rb efflux, i.e. not stimulus-permeability coupled. All the effects of the non-cholinergic, non-adrenergic transmitter were mimicked by substance P which evokes 86Rb efflux and electrophysiological effects in addition to amylase release. The non-cholinergic, non-adrenergic field stimulus effects on amylase release and 86Rb efflux were abolished or markedly attenuated in tissues which had been desensitized by prior exposure to exogenous substance P. In the presence of VIP, however, the non-cholinergic, non-adrenergic effects persisted and were apparently potentiated. Acute application of the neurotoxin capsaicin first stimulated a transient release of amylase and subsequently abolished the non-cholinergic, non-adrenergic field stimulus-evoked enzyme release. The putative substance P antagonist, D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9 substance P, reversibly blocked the response to both non-cholinergic, non-adrenergic nerve stimulation and exogenous substance P. It was demonstrated however that prolonged exposure to this antagonist is associated with non-reversible and, importantly, non-specific neurotoxic effects. It is concluded that substance P or a closely related peptide is a functional neurotransmitter in the rat parotid gland.", 
    "69": "It has been established in experiments on anesthetized rats that the beta-adrenoblocker obsidan inhibiting tubular sodium reabsorption in the kidneys provokes the natriuretic reaction which correlates with the increased blood flow in the cortex and in the external medullary substance. pO2 in these zones of the renal tissue remains unchanged. The inhibitor of prostaglandin biosynthesis indomethacin and the inhibitor of the kallikrein-kinin system contrykal did not affect the renal response to the drug under study. The dopamine blocker haloperidol prevented the hemodynamic shift in the cortical and in the external medullary layers and interfered with the inhibitory action of obsidan in tubular sodium transport. It is inferred that the natriuretic response to the action of beta-adrenoblockers is not linked with the increased prostaglandin biosynthesis in the kidneys or with activation of the kallikrein-kinin system but is partially governed by stimulation of dopamine receptors of the kidneys.", 
    "70": "Beta-receptors were measured in longitudinal sections of ligated rat sciatic nerve by autoradiographic localization of 125I-labeled cyanopindolol binding sites. Receptors accumulated at the ligature, both proximally and distally, in a time-dependent fashion. Receptor transport also occurred in an isolated segment of nerve (i.e., a doubly ligated nerve), suggesting that the movement is by fast transport. Pharmacological analysis of the accumulating binding sites indicates that they are beta 2-adrenergic receptors. In competition studies, agonists were 10-30 times more potent on receptors accumulating proximal to the ligature than on distally accumulating receptors, whereas antagonists were equipotent on both. Guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate (GppNHp) decreased the potency of agonists at proximal receptors in a dose-dependent fashion. Distal receptors were much less sensitive to GppNHp. Other nucleotides displayed varying abilities to mimic the effect of GppNHp, suggesting the involvement of a guanine nucleotide-binding protein in regulating agonist affinity. Thus, presynaptic beta 2-adrenergic receptors were identified in rat sciatic nerve. A small fraction of them apparently moves by fast transport. The anterogradely transported receptors have binding properties which differ from the retrogradely moving receptor and appear to be in functional association with a nucleotide regulatory protein.", 
    "71": "The hypothesis that norepinephrine neurons facilitate serotonin metabolism was tested by employing the adenosine antagonist 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) as a pharmacological probe to enhance central noradrenergic metabolism. IBMX elevated brain concentrations of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and increased the accumulation rates of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and 5-hydroxytryptophan. Maximal effects were observed 3 hr after drug administration, with 14 mg/kg of IBMX. The effects of IBMX on serotonin metabolism were observed in cortex, striatum and hippocampus, antagonized by clonidine and propranolol and prazosin and absent in animals whose norepinephrine neurons had been destroyed with 6-hydroxydopamine. The data are discussed in terms of a noradrenergic facilitation of serotonin turnover.", 
    "72": "We examined the haemorheological determinants in a group of 52 hypertensives (diastolic basal pressure greater than 100 mmHg) subdivided in relation to the clinical stage (I and II or III according to the WHO classification) and in a group of 50 normal controls, matched for age and sex. From this study, it is evident that only plasma viscosity, fibrinogen and the fibrinogen/albumin ratio are able to distinguish normals from hypertensives. It is also clear that the clinical stage does not influence the haemorheological findings. These haemorheological factors were also measured in 3 groups of hypertensives treated with either timolol (20 mg/day), metoprolol (200 mg/day) or oxprenolol (160 mg/day). After a basal evaluation, measurements were performed, at regular intervals of 10 days, for a period of 30 days. The only significant changes were obtained using timolol; metoprolol and oxprenolol, did not affect these haemorheological parameters.", 
    "73": "In rats kept at a constant temperature (24 +/- 1.5 degrees C) and on a reversed day/night cycle (light from 11 p.m. to 11 a.m.), the amount of food eaten during the first 2 h of darkness and during 24 h was measured every day. When reserpine or guanethidine were injected 5 min before the beginning of the dark period on four consecutive days, there was no significant change in the 0.5-, 1-, or 24-h food intake on the injection days, but there was a significant increase in the 0.5-, 1- and 2-h food intake during the next five to eight days, without any change in the 24-h intake. A single injection of dichloroisoproterenol produced no change on the day of injection but it induced a significant increase in the 0.5-, 1- and 2-h intake on the following 15 days, without any change in the 24-h intake. The increase in the early night-time feeding without any change in the 24-h intake was interpreted as an increase in meal size (diminished preabsorptive satiation) compensated by a decrease in meal frequency. Both reserpine and guanethidine are catecholamine depleters but the latter does not penetrate into the brain. Dichloroisoproterenol is a beta-blocker acting on the glycogenolytic effects of catecholamines. The results thus agree with the hypothesis that glycogenolysis elicited by the liberation of intrahepatic catecholamines from the sympathetic nerve endings and chromaffin cells plays a role in preabsorptive satiation.", 
    "74": "Hyperventilation may be induced by several organic factors. The HVS-hyperventilation and symptoms such as hypertonia and pain-hypocapnia and disturbance of the acid-base balance--other symptoms--anxiousness--hyperventilation--etc. In the adaptation-hyperventilation and symptoms such as hypertonia and pain,-hupocapnia and disturbance of the acid-base balance-other symptoms--anxiousness--hyperventilation--etc. In the adaptation process one distinguishes the load, the strain and a tension or counterforce (stress). In the cause and effect relationship between the adaptation process and a specific pathology, it is obvious that the strain is the only element capable of eliciting the specific pathology or syndrome. Stress is a compensation for the strain and is therefore beneficial to the organism. The strain is associated with, amongst other things, anxiety and changes in the pyridoxine-L-tryptophan metabolism (nicotinic acid-ribonucleotide synthesis). Stress depends to a large extent on the intact serotonergic transmission in the cerebrum. But serotonin synthesis is critically dependent on the pyridoxine-L-tryptophan metabolism. Benzodiazepines improve the hyperventilation, anxiousness and strain, if these are of the free-floating anxiety type. Tricyclic preparations improve anxiousness in as much as it assumes the character of fear, phobia or an anxiety attack. They are active against strain when that reveals itself as an anxiety attack. Pyridoxine and L-tryptophan as serotonergic agonists, improve the hyperventilation, have a beneficial effect on symptoms such as hypertonia and pain, are effective against anxiousness and anxiety and potentiate the stress. In addition they directly correct the property of strain, i.e. the disturbance of the nicotinicacid-ribonucleotide synthesis. Clomipramine is the most potent serotonergic agonist available. That substance has a favourable effect on hyperventilation, hypertonia and pain, on anxiousness that expresses itself as fear, phobia or an anxiety attack. It favours stress. Further investigation is desirable, in particular of the new serotonergic agonists that have recently been made available or are still to come.", 
    "75": "Pretreatment of rats with the beta-adrenergic blocking agents, atenolol, practolol, pronethalol and propranolol, at a dosage of 150 mg/kg/day for 5 days, produced marked increases in guanylate cyclase activity in the liver, gastric and intestinal mucosae, but with concomitant decreases in cyclic GMP levels. The ratios of cAMP/cGMP in each of the tissues were not changed significantly from control values after pretreatment with these drugs. These observations indicate that any oncogenicity seen with beta-blocking agents is not due to the common pharmacological action of beta-adrenoreceptor blockade.", 
    "76": "Effects of beta-blockers on the blood pressure (BP), urinary output (V) and excretion of Na% (UNaV) and K+ (UKV) were studied in DOCA-saline hypertensive rats in comparison with those of a thiazide diuretic drug, penfluzide. Pindolol produced a hypotension at all infusion rates of Ringer's solution used and a decrease in V with a retention of Na+ and K+ at a low infusion rate. There was a parallel shift of Guyton's renal function curve back to the lower pressure ranges. Similar effects were observed with labetalol. Propranolol induced an increase in UKV at all infusion rates and had a diuretic action at a high infusion rate without producing a significant fall of BP. UKV tended to be increased after atenolol, with essentially no change in other parameters. A new beta-blocker with alpha-blocking action, K-351, produced a hypotension at intermediate and high infusion rates and an increase in UNaV (low infusion rate) and UKV (low and high rates). UKV tended to be increased with another new beta-blocker, N-696, with a fall of BP at high infusion rate. Penfluzide produced a significant decrease in BP at intermediate and high infusion rates and an increase in UKV at all infusion rates.", 
    "77": "Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) has been found within the renal cortex and is believed to be a neurotransmitter. Although it produces systemic vasodilatation and renin release, the exact mechanism of the latter response is uncertain. When infused into conscious rabbits, VIP elicits a rise in plasma renin activity (PRA) and an increase in heart rate. The rise in PRA is unaltered by pretreatment with propranolol, but is attenuated by indomethacin. The tachycardia is inhibited by propranolol, but unaffected by indomethacin. We conclude that the renin response to VIP is in part prostaglandin-dependent and that the heart rate response is due to direct or reflex beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "78": "In 936 coronary angiocardiographies we found 46 patients with muscular bands. This report concerns 23 patients in which a muscular band was the only coronary pathological finding. In all cases the muscular band was located at the anterior descending artery. The angiocardiographic features that distinguishes the muscular epicardial bands are pointed out. The muscular bands can produce myocardial ischemic changes. Eighty-two per cent had ischemic changes in the resting EKG. Stress tests were positive only when the systolic obstruction was greater than 70%. The ischemic changes were observed in the myocardial zone irrigated by the narrowed artery and in 60% of the cases were accompanied by malfunction of the ventricular wall. In a follow up period averaging 28 months, the majority improved with beta-blockers. Two remained with angina.", 
    "79": "We tested a procedure to obtain reference values based on careful clinical analysis of a population sample with the background (a) that there are conflicting reports of age effects on thyroid function parameters, possibly reflecting differences in numbers of sick and drug-treated subjects in the studied populations, and (b) that recommended procedures for the selection of reference subjects in elderly populations may give unacceptably high exclusion rates. Serum free T4 was determined by a ligand-analogue technique in a representative population of 460 males at age 70. The determinations were performed 5 years after the clinical study, and the results were analysed in relation to information obtained at the study as well as during a 5-year follow-up. The free T4 concentration was significantly low in subjects with neoplastic disease and subjects with chronic bronchitis and significantly high in subjects taking non-selective beta-adrenergic blockers. Selective beta 1-blockers had no apparent effect. Information on death during the 5 years after the study proved to have no significance. The free T4 concentration was found to be negatively correlated to body mass and body mass index, a correlation which has previously not been shown. Smoking was associated with a significantly low body mass but had no apparent effect on mean free T4 concentration. A procedure with successive exclusions of clinically defined diagnostic groups with significantly low or high analyte concentration and/or body mass may be used to obtain reference values for thyroid function and may reveal previously unknown relationships."
