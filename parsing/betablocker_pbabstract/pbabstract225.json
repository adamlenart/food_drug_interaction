    "2": "The intervention targeted physicians of Pennsylvania Medicaid recipients who had an AMI between November 1, 1998, and November 1, 1999. Educational materials were sent to the physicians of post-AMI patients not receiving beta-blockers. Preintervention and postintervention rates of beta-blocker prescribing in the Medicaid program within 7 and 30 days of discharge after an AMI hospitalization were compared. Similarly, pre- and postintervention compliance rates were compared for AMI patients who were prescribed beta-blockers. Cost savings and number of avoided deaths also were calculated.", 
    "3": "There was a 5.5%, to 6.9% increase in beta-blocker prescribing after the intervention, depending on the follow-up period. Postintervention AMI patients were 16% more likely to be prescribed a beta-blocker. There was an 8.3% increase in patient compliance with beta-blocker therapy from preintervention to postintervention. In the first 2 years of the intervention, the estimated cost savings to the Pennsylvania Medicaid program ranged from 71,970 dollars to 76,678 dollars, respectively. An estimated 3 deaths were avoided.",

    "7": "Recent advances in the treatment of heart failure led to guidelines using clinical trial evidence as the rationale for transferring newer therapeutic technologies to the community practice setting. Implementation of such guidelines is slow, reflecting concerns over applicability of clinical trial results to the community setting.

    "11": "We studied 25 patients with acute anterior MI who had undergone coronary reperfusion therapy, and 10 normal control subjects with no cardiac disease. In all patients, LV ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume index (EDVI), and end-systolic volume index (ESVI) were determined using left ventriculography at the acute phase and 6 months after onset. The delta EDVI and delta ESVI were calculated as the value of LV volume reduction, suggesting LV reverse remodeling. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.", 
    "12": "Serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha at the acute phase were significantly higher in patients with MI than in control subjects (both p < 0.05). The IL-6 levels correlated well negatively with delta EDVI (r = 0.779, p = 0.039), whereas no correlation was found for TNF-alpha. According to multivariate analysis, IL-6 at the acute phase was a significant independent predictor for LV remodeling after reperfused MI (p = 0.007).",

    "16": "Hemodynamic studies were performed under resting conditions and after isotonic exercise in 15 patients with hyperthyroidism and 11 control subjects. Exercise was applied using a bicycle ergometer, with progressive loads. In the hyperthyroid group, measurements were repeated at rest and during supine exercise after administering 15 mg of intravenous metoprolol.",

After exercise, there was an increase in end-diastolic pulmonary artery pressure in the hyperthyroid group (18.6 +/- 5.3 to 25.5 +/- 9.9 mmHg; p = 0.02), revealing impaired cardiocirculatory reserve. Pulmonary arteriolar resistance increased significantly in parallel with end-diastolic pulmonary artery pressure after drug administration, suggesting an inadequate cardiovascular response after beta blockade in patients with hyperthyroidism.", 
    "18": "We observed that functional left ventricular reserve is impaired in patients with hyperthyroidism, suggesting an explanation for the frequent symptom of dyspnea and impaired exercise tolerance. Moreover, we also suggest that beta-adrenergic blockade may adversely affect cardiovascular function in patients with hyperthyroidism.", 
    "19": "In this study, we investigated adrenergic and photoneural regulation of p38MAPK phosphorylation in the rat pineal gland. Norepinephrine (NE), the endogenous neurotransmitter, dose-dependently increased the levels of phosphorylated MAPK kinase 3/6 (MKK3/6) and p38MAPK in rat pinealocytes. Time-course studies showed a gradual increase in MKK3/6 and p38MAPK phosphorylation that peaked between 1 and 2 h and persisted for 4 h post NE stimulation. In cells treated with NE for 2 and 4 h, the inclusion of prazosin or propranolol reduced NE-induced MKK3/6 and p38MAPK phosphorylation, indicating involvement of both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors for the sustained response. Whereas treatment with dibutyryl cAMP or ionomycin mimicked the NE-induced MKK3/6 and p38MAPK phosphorylation, neither dibutyryl cGMP nor 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate had an effect. The NE-induced increase in MKK3/6 and p38MAPK phosphorylation was blocked by KT5720 (a protein kinase A inhibitor) and KN93 (a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase inhibitor), but not by KT5823 (a protein kinase G inhibitor) or calphostin C (a protein kinase C inhibitor). In animals housed under a lighting regimen with 12 h of light, MKK3/6 and p38MAPK phosphorylation increased in the rat pineal gland at zeitgeber time 18. The nocturnal increase in p38MAPK phosphorylation was blocked by exposing the animal to constant light and reduced by treatment with propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker. Together, our results indicate that activation of p38MAPK is under photoneural control in the rat pineal gland and that protein kinase A and intracellular Ca(2+) signaling pathways are involved in NE regulation of p38MAPK.", 
    "20": "Several clinical trials have demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) are equally effective in the treatment of chronic heart failure. However, this has not been confirmed for acute cardiac dysfunction. We examined whether ACEI or ARB prevents isoproterenol-induced acute left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in dogs. LV dysfunction induced by a large dose of isoproterenol (1 microg.kg(-1).min(-1), 3-h infusion) was compared in dogs treated with ACEI (temocaprilat) or ARB (olmesartan). Atrial pacing induced a constant heart rate and use of adjustable aortic banding provided a nearly constant afterload. LV systolic function (LV dP/dt, fractional shortening, and ejection fraction) and diastolic function (tau and LV end-diastolic pressure) were significantly deteriorated after isoproterenol infusion. The LV dysfunction was almost totally prevented by ARB but was only partially prevented by ACEI. The partial effect of ACEI was complemented by cotreatment with HOE-140, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. At baseline, the response to low doses of isoproterenol was significantly attenuated by ACEI but not by ARB, and the ACEI-induced attenuation was totally abolished by cotreatment with HOE-140. The response to isoproterenol was significantly attenuated after 3 h of excess isoproterenol loading, and it was almost completely preserved by ARB but not by ACEI. In conclusion, acute LV dysfunction and beta-adrenergic desensitization induced by excess isoproterenol administration were almost totally prevented by ARB but only partially prevented by ACEI. These differences were attributable at least in part to bradykinin pathways activated by ACEI administration in acute LV dysfunction.",

    "22": "Fetuses were obtained from timed-pregnant guinea pigs at 61 to 69 days' gestation with and without oxytocin-induced preterm labor. The fetuses were placed on continuous positive airway pressure oxygenation, and an isosmolar 5% albumin solution was instilled into the lungs. Distal airspace fluid clearance was measured over 1 hour from the increase in distal airspace protein concentration as fluid was reabsorbed with and without the Cl(-) transport inhibitor bumetanide.", 
    "23": "Fetal lungs began to absorb distal airspace fluid at 64 to 66 days' gestation, and at birth, distal airspace fluid clearance rapidly quadrupled. Labor induction by oxytocin stimulated distal airspace fluid clearance. Distal airspace fluid clearance, when present, was sensitive to propranolol-inhibition and depended on beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. Fluid secretion at 61 days' gestation was reduced by bumetanide instillation. Bumetanide addition was only inhibitory when distal airspace fluid clearance was propranolol-sensitive.", 
    "24": "Beta-adrenoceptor stimulation from endogenous fetal epinephrine increased fetal distal airspace fluid clearance and involved bumetanide-sensitive ion transport.", 
    "25": "The Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) demonstrated that spironolactone significantly improves outcomes in patients with severe heart failure. Use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is also indicated in these patients. However, life-threatening hyperkalemia can occur when these drugs are used together.", 
    "26": "We conducted a population-based time-series analysis to examine trends in the rate of spironolactone prescriptions and the rate of hospitalization for hyperkalemia in ambulatory patients before and after the publication of RALES.

    "27": "Among patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had recently been hospitalized for heart failure, the spironolactone-prescription rate was 34 per 1000 patients in 1994, and it increased immediately after the publication of RALES, to 149 per 1000 patients by late 2001 (P<0.001). The rate of hospitalization for hyperkalemia rose from 2.4 per 1000 patients in 1994 to 11.0 per 1000 patients in 2001 (P<0.001), and the associated mortality rose from 0.3 per 1000 to 2.0 per 1000 patients (P<0.001). As compared with expected numbers of events, there were 560 (95 percent confidence interval, 285 to 754) additional hyperkalemia-related hospitalizations and 73 (95 percent confidence interval, 27 to 120) additional hospital deaths during 2001 among older patients with heart failure who were treated with ACE inhibitors in Ontario. Publication of RALES was not associated with significant decreases in the rates of readmission for heart failure or death from all causes.",

Group B consisted of 27 patients treated with ICDs because of sustained VT/fibrillation (n=18) or syncope (n=9).", 
    "31": "NYHA class, LVEF, LVEDD and amiodarone treatment were similar in the two groups. Patients in group A were younger (46+/-15 vs 59+/-17 years, P=0.0008), were more often treated with beta-blockers (89% vs 62%; P=0.02) and had a longer interval since diagnosis (86+/-60 vs 40+/-50 months; P=0.004). Twelve month rates of appropriate intervention (AI) were 41% in Group A and 57% in group B (P NS). In group A, after a mean follow-up of 21+/-14 months, patients showing the combination of LVEF < or =30% and LVEDD > or =70 mm had the highest frequency of AI (76% vs 10%, P=0.005). In group B, after a mean follow-up of 33+/-23 months, 78% of patients with syncope had AI. Total and sudden deaths were 11% and 4% in group A and 19% and 4% in group B (P NS).", 
    "32": "Patients with idiopathic DC treated with ICD for primary prevention because they were considered at high risk of SD according to clinical criteria showed a high rate of AI, similar to that of patients treated for secondary prevention. The highest rate of AI was seen in patients with both severe dysfunction and dilatation and in those with previous syncope.", 
    "33": "Congestive heart failure is a common condition with a poor prognosis. Its high rates of morbidity and mortality produce a huge societal burden. Current pharmacological treatment approaches are based on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics and digoxin, but up to 5% of patients may have refractory disease with persistent symptoms at rest. Such patients with advanced-stage disease may be candidates for treatment with the novel agent vesnarinone, a mixed phosphodiesterase inhibitor and ion-channel modifier that has modest, dose-dependent, positive inotropic activity, but minimal negative chronotropic activity. Vesnarinone improves ventricular performance most in patients with the worst degree of heart failure. However, before the initiation of vesnarinone therapy, risk-benefit profiles in individual patients should be considered, because in two large-scale studies [i.e. of the high dosage used in the Vesnarinone Study Group Trial (VSGT), and of both dosages used in the Vesnarinone Trial (VEST)] a dose-dependent increase in mortality was identified for vesnarinone 30-120 mg/day. The two studies also found significant vesnarinone-induced, short-term improvements in quality of life (QOL) in patients with refractory end-stage heart failure. Such patients are the most willing to trade-off a slightly increased risk of mortality for improved QOL. It is thus in these patients with refractory end-stage heart failure that vesnarinone may ultimately establish an important treatment role. However, detailed further investigation of the overall place of vesnarinone in heart failure management, with particular reference to the clinical potential of vesnarinone plus beta-blocker combination therapy, for example, is certainly warranted.", 
    "34": "Among 1000 French cardiologists, the ECART study investigated drug prescription in 1041 patients with coronary heart disease, before and after percutaneous coronary interventions. The baseline drug prescription rate CAD patients were the following: beta-blockers 96%, antiplatelets agents 85%, statines 56%, nitrates 36%, calcium blockers 26% and ACE inhibitors 8.7%. The main changes in patients having undergone PCI were: a significant increase in antiplatelets agents (to 97%), ACE inhibitors (to 29%) and statins (to 94%), a significant decrease in nitrates (to 23%). The calcium blockers rate remains unchanged at 26%. Those results are discussed in the field of evidence based medicine and are compared with data from previous drug prescription studies in post myocardial infarction or in secondary prevention.", 
    "35": "The radiolytic products of eight beta-blockers were studied in order to understand the mechanisms of irradiation of drugs in the solid state.", 
    "36": "The drugs were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a diode array detector in order to observe the degradation of the main compound after irradiation and in order to study the nonvolatile final products on more concentrated solutions of irradiated drugs.", 
    "37": "The first test assessed that the main compound was not significantly degraded after gamma irradiation for any of the eight beta-blockers. A more complete study, which consisted on separating the nonvolatile products and on quantifying them, indicated first that the radiolytic products could reach the number of 14 and moreover that some could exceed the 0.1% threshold at 30 kGy. Eventually, radiolytic yields were compared with radical yields previously determined.", 
    "38": "The sensitivity of the first test can be discussed. It seems that, to study the feasibility of the radiosterilization, a complete study of the products of degradation is needed. Moreover, no correlation between radical and final products could be established, which denies that the former would be the precursors of the latter.", 
    "39": "To determine whether premedication with a beta-blocker can bring about a more rapid and smooth induction of anesthesia, we investigated the effect of oral premedication with atenolol on volatile anesthetic induction with sevoflurane by monitoring the cardiac output (CO) and bispectral (BIS) index.", 
    "40": "Twenty-four patients undergoing general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation were randomly divided into two groups: a control group ( n = 12) and a beta-blocker group ( n = 12). Each patient in the beta-blocker group was premedicated with oral atenolol 25 mg 1 h before the induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced by the repeated vital capacity technique with 5% sevoflurane and 66% nitrous oxide. The trachea was intubated 5 min after sevoflurane exposure. The CO and BIS index, as well as the induction time and specific side effects of induction (e.g., movement of limbs), were recorded.", 
    "41": "There were no significant differences in induction time and specific side effects between the groups. The downward-sloping part of the BIS index curve in the beta-blocker group (mean, 2.9 +/- 0.2) was significantly sharper than that in the control group (2.5 +/- 0.2), and the BIS index after induction of anesthesia was significantly lower in the beta-blocker group (21.0 +/- 2.2) than in the control group (24.2 +/- 2.0). CO in the beta-blocker group was significantly lower than in the control group during the study period. The hemodynamic changes caused by endotracheal intubation were inhibited in the beta-blocker group but not in the control group.", 
    "42": "Oral premedication with 25 mg of atenolol provides a more rapid decrease in BIS index and is recommended for use in stable volatile anesthetic induction with sevoflurane.", 
    "43": "1. Vasopeptidase inhibition (i.e., the simultaneous inhibition of both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase) can ameliorate diabetic nephropathy. We investigated whether this nephroprotection is mediated by the bradykinin B2 receptor. 2. In all, 43 obese Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF/Gmi-fa/fa) rats aged 21 weeks were separated into four groups and treated for 26 weeks with either placebo, the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist icatibant (500 microg kg(-1) day(-1) s.c. infusion), the vasopeptidase inhibitor AVE7688 (45 mg kg(-1) day(-1) in chow), or AVE7688 plus icatibant. Nephropathy was assessed as albuminuria at age 31 and 39 weeks, and by histopathologic scoring at the end of the treatment period. 3. All animals had established diabetes mellitus (blood glucose >20 mmol l(-1)) and marked albuminuria at baseline. Blood glucose was not influenced by any treatment. Icatibant alone did not influence albuminuria (8.6+/-1.6 vs placebo 9.5+/-1.3 mg kg(-1) h(-1)). AVE7688 reduced albuminuria at week 31 markedly to 1.1+/-0.1 mg kg(-1) h(-1) and reduced glomerular and tubulo-interstitial kidney damage at week 47. In the AVE7688 plus icatibant group, proteinuria was significantly higher than in the AVE7688 only group (2.0+/-0.6 mg kg(-1) h(-1)), but still reduced compared to placebo. In addition, icatibant partly antagonized the tubulo-interstitial protection mediated by AVE7688. 4. We conclude that vasopeptidase inhibition provides nephroprotection in rats with type II diabetic nephropathy, which is partly mediated by bradykinin B2 receptor activation.",

Photography included 7 views of each eye plus a calibration photograph and a patient identification photograph, for a total of 16 photographs per patient per visit. Two independent (masked) readers subjectively compared baseline iris colors to subsequent visits. Side view photographs of the upper and lower eyelashes were used for the eyelash length analysis, with each having sufficient depth of field and a sufficient number of eyelashes in focus. Similarly, frontal eyelash views were used for the eyelash density analysis.",

In the unoprostone group, cases of iris color change were confirmed at months 12 (1 case), 18 (2 cases), and 24 (4 cases). No clinically relevant differences were observed among treatment groups for changes from baseline in eyelash length or density.",

    "51": "We used the open-channel blocker, penicillin (10 mM), as a tool to investigate if the human alpha1beta1 or alpha1beta1gamma2S gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor channels opened in the absence of GABA. Application of penicillin to cells expressing the receptors resulted in a transient inward whole-cell current, the off-current, upon penicillin removal. The amplitude of the off-current was dependent on the duration of the penicillin application, it reversed in polarity at depolarized potentials and exhibited \"run-down\" similar to the GABA-activated currents. Bicuculline (100 microM) blocked the off-current response. Pentobarbital (50 microM) enhanced the peak off-current amplitude by 2.8 and 3.4 in alpha1beta1 and alpha1beta1gamma2S receptors, respectively. Diazepam (1 microM) only enhanced the off-current peak response in alpha1beta1gamma2S receptors (1.6) and induced the development of an inward current when applied alone. The results are consistent with that the alpha1beta1 or alpha1beta1gamma2) GABAA receptors can open in the absence of GABA and raise the question of what role spontaneous channel openings have in the function of GABAA receptors.", 
    "52": "In the present study, the susceptibility of the mdx mouse, a dystrophin-deficient genetic model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), to various convulsant stimuli has been evaluated and compared to three related mice strains (C57BL/6J, C57BL/10 and DBA/2 mice). Animals were treated with chemical convulsants impairing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission [pentylenetetrazole, picrotoxin, bicuculline, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM)], enhancing glutamatergic neurotransmission [N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) and kainic acid (KA)] or a K(+) channel blocker (4-aminopyridine). Occurrence of clonic and/or tonic seizures was evaluated to observe possible differences in seizure susceptibility. In addition, all strains of mice were repeatedly treated with a subconvulsant dose of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) for possible differences in kindling development. The mdx mice exhibited no difference in seizure susceptibility for all convulsant drugs with the exception of a significantly lower sensitivity to AMPA and KA than the other mice strains. This study demonstrates that mdx mice possess a decreased susceptibility to some convulsant stimuli. However, mdx mice showed an enhanced seizure severity and a shorter latency in the development of chemical kindling produced by administration of PTZ. The present data suggests that the dystrophin deficiency in mdx mice affects the pathophysiology and pharmacology of acute and chronic epileptic seizures in an opposite manner.", 
    "53": "This study compared the efficacy and safety of intravenous flecainide and ibutilide for immediate cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF).", 
    "54": "We conducted a prospective, randomised trial, including 207 patients with AF of recent onset (< or = 48 h). Flecainide was given over 20 min at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight (maximum 200 mg), ibutilide was infused at a dose of 1 mg (or 0.01 mg/kg if less than 60 kg) over 10 min, followed by a 10 min observation period and an identical second dose if AF did not convert to sinus rhythm (SR). Treatment was considered successful if SR occurred within 90 min of starting medication. The conversion rates were 56.4% in patients given flecainide and 50.0% in patients given ibutilide (P=0.34). Multivariate analysis revealed that a lower age for women independently increased the probability of conversion. None of the other variables, including left atrial size, left ventricular systolic function, presence of left ventricular hypertrophy, plasma levels of potassium or magnesium at baseline, or concomitant use of digoxin, beta-blocker, diltiazem or verapamil were predictors of conversion. The frequency of adverse events was comparable in the two treatment groups.", 
    "55": "There was no significant difference in the cardioversion efficacy or in the risk of adverse events between flecainide and ibutilide in patients with AF of recent onset. In patients without contraindications to both medications, the physician's choice has to be governed by other factors.",

In patients > or = 65 years total mortality was reduced by 37% (95% CI 17% to 52%; p=0.0008), sudden death by 43% (95% CI 17% to 61%; p=0.0032), and death from worsening heart failure by 61% (95% CI 32% to 77%; p=0.0005). Hospitalisations for worsening heart failure was reduced by 36% (p=0.0006). Elderly patients with severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV with ejection fraction < 0.25; n=425, and patients above 75 years (n=490) showed similar risk reductions. Metoprolol CR/XL was safe and well tolerated both during initiating therapy and during long-term follow-up.", 
    "58": "Metoprolol CR/XL was easily instituted, safe and well tolerated in elderly patients with systolic heart failure. The data suggest that these are the patients in whom treatment will have the greatest impact as shown by number of lives saved and number of hospitalisations avoided. The time has come to overcome the barriers that physicians perceive to beta-blocker treatment, and to provide it to the large number of elderly patients with heart failure in need of this therapy.", 
    "59": "Treatment of coronary artery disease primarily aims at reducing the severity and frequency of cardiac symptoms and improving prognosis. Both goals can be achieved by the administration of beta-receptor blockers, which are now used as first-line therapy in these patients. Calcium channel blockers or nitrates should be given in the event of contraindications or severe intolerance to beta-receptor blocking therapy. Only long-acting calcium channel blockers should be used in this setting. Another indication for additional treatment with calcium channel blockers and nitrates is given when the efficacy of beta-blocker therapy is not sufficient to relieve symptoms. Nitroglycerin and nitrates are the drugs of choice for the treatment of the acute angina pectoris attack. Calcium channel blockers are used as first-line treatment in patients with vasospastic angina. In patients with syndrome X, nitrates as well as calcium channel blockers or beta-receptor blockers can be administered. In the absence of contraindications, every patient with coronary artery disease should be given aspirin. A daily dosage of 75 to 150 mg is sufficient to reduce the rate of future cardiac events. Clopidogrel should be given in every patient with intolerance or contraindications for aspirin. Increased plasma homocystein levels seem to be a risk factor for coronary artery disease. Homocystein levels can be reduced by dietary means as well as supplementation of folic acid or vitamin B complex. There is no evidence from controlled randomised studies that a decrease of homocystein is beneficial for the prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "60": "A novel colorimetric assay of propranolol tablets has been developed. The assay is based on chemical derivatization (aromatic ring derivatization technique) using diazotized 4-amino-3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (ADBA) as the chromogenic derivatizing reagent and resultant formation of azo dyes. Optimization studies established an optimal reaction time of 5 min at 30 degrees C after mixing on a Vortex mixer the drug/reagent mixture for 10 s. A new absorption maximum (lambda(max)) was found at 470 nm, which was selected as the analytical wavelength. The assays were linear over 1-8 microg/mL propranolol, and the reaction occurred by a 1:1 reagent/drug stoichiometric ratio. The developed method has a low limit of detection of 0.76 microg/mL and is reproducible. It has been applied successfully to the assay of propranolol tablets and is of equivalent accuracy (p > 0.05) with the official (British Pharmacopoeia) ultraviolet spectrophotometric method. The new method has the main advantage of using more affordable instrumentation and could be applied to the in-process quality control of propranolol tablets.", 
    "61": "Uridine 5'-triphosphate (UTP) increases chloride secretion followed by fluid movement into the proximal airspaces. However, little is known about whether UTP affects fluid movement in the distal airspaces. We studied the effect of UTP on basal and stimulated alveolar fluid clearance in the isolated rat lungs. Isosmotic 5% albumin solution was instilled into the alveolar spaces of isolated rat lungs, which were then inflated with 100% oxygen at an airway pressure of 7 cmH(2)O. Alveolar fluid clearance was measured by the progressive increase in albumin concentrations over 1 h. Although UTP (10(-9) - 10(-6) M) did not increase alveolar fluid clearance, UTP (10(-5) - 10(-3) M) and isoproterenol (10(-5) M), a beta-adrenergic agonist, increased alveolar fluid clearance by 40% and 120% of the basal values, respectively. A combined treatment of UTP (10(-4) M, 10(-3) M) and isoproterenol increased alveolar fluid clearance by 280% of the basal value. The effects of UTP in the presence and absence of isoproterenol were abolished by blockers of a P2 purinoceptor and chloride channels. These results indicate that UTP stimulates alveolar fluid clearance in the distal airspaces of rat lungs.", 
    "62": "Synapses formed by the olfactory nerve (ON) provide the source of excitatory synaptic input onto mitral cells (MC) in the olfactory bulb. These synapses, which relay odor-specific inputs, are confined to the distally tufted single primary dendrites of MCs, the first stage of central olfactory processing. beta-adrenergic modulation of electrical and chemical signaling at these synapses may be involved in early odor preference learning. To investigate this possibility, we combined electrophysiological recordings with calcium imaging in olfactory bulb slices prepared from neonatal rats and mice. Activation of ON-MC synapses induced postsynaptic potentials, which were associated with large postsynaptic calcium transients. Neither electrical nor calcium responses were affected by beta-adrenergic agonists or antagonist. Immunocytochemical analysis of MCs and their tufted dendrites revealed clear immunoreactivity with antibodies against alpha1A (Cav2.1, P/Q-type) and alpha1B (Cav2.2, N-type), but not against alpha1C (Cav1.2, L-type) or alpha1D (Cav1.3, L-type) calcium channel subunits. Moreover, nimodipine, a blocker of L-type calcium channels, had no effect on either electrical or calcium signaling at ON-MC synapses. In contrast to previous evidence, we concluded that in neonatal rats and mice (P5-P8), mitral cells do not express significant amounts of L-type calcium channels, the calcium channel type that is often targeted by beta-adrenergic modulation. The absence of beta-adrenergic modulation on either electrical or calcium signaling at ON-MC synapses of neonatal rats and mice excludes the involvement of this mechanism in early odor preference learning.", 
    "63": "An extract of toxin(s) from the Australian paralysis tick, Ixodes holocyclus, produced positive inotropic responses in rat left ventricular papillary muscles and positive contractile responses in rat thoracic aortic rings. There was no measurable chronotropic response in rat right atria, but positive inotropic concentrations in papillary muscles produced arrhythmias in right atria. Positive inotropic responses were attenuated by verapamil, but unaffected by metoprolol, cimetidine, pyrilamine, tetrodotoxin and pinacidil. Microelectrode studies on isolated left ventricular papillary muscles demonstrated that the extract prolonged action potential duration at 20, 50 and 90% of repolarisation and delayed ventricular papillary muscle relaxation. Cardiovascular tissues isolated from rats with experimentally induced tick paralysis showed no myocardial damage as identified by histological and ultrastructural examination. The basal rate and force of contraction of isolated cardiac tissues were lower from tick-paralysed than normal rats. Concentration-response curves to dobutamine and calcium chloride were similar between tissues from tick-paralysed and normal rats. Thus, the Australian paralysis tick, I. holocyclus, produces one or more toxins with direct cardiovascular effects which mimic the effects produced by direct blockade of cardiac and vascular K+ channels.", 
    "64": "The use of a guanosine gel as a chiral selector in capillary electrophoresis is introduced. Guanosine gels are reversible organized media that are formed through the self-association of guanosine compounds. Their degree of organization and their physicochemical properties can be modulated through variations in guanosine monomer concentration, pH, temperature, and cation content. Baseline resolution of the d and l enantiomers of propranolol was achieved using a reversible biogel formed by 5'-guanosine monophosphate as the run buffer in capillary electrophoresis. Conditions were optimized to provide enantiomeric resolution of 2.1-2.3 in less than 5 min. The reversibility of the gel network offers potential advantages for chiral separations, including the possibility of using thermal or chemical dissociation of the gel network to remove the nucleoside monomers from the separated enantiomers, thereby eliminating the chiral selector as a source of physical contamination of the enantiomerically pure products and spectral background in UV absorbance detection.", 
    "65": "ACE inhibitors initially developed as vasodilators are effective by their anti-hormonal action. Antagonists of the receptors of angiotensin II (ARA II) should provide an equivalent or better blockade of the rennin-angiotensin system (absence of tolerance). Clinical trials have shown equivalent haemodynamic effects of the two classes, equal functional tolerance but mortality studies have shown more variable results. None have shown the superiority of ARA II over ACE inhibitors and the demonstration of their equivalence has just been reported with high doses in the post-infarction period. A deleterious effect of ARA II in association with betablockers was reported in two mortality studies but has not been confirmed in the most recent trials. The difficulty is to determine the roles of the association of ARA II-ACE inhibitors, ARA II-antialdosterones or of the association of all three classes of molecules.",

First, microspray emitters can be operated with 50% methanol/49% water/1% acetic acid from 250 nL/min up to 7 microL/min, with better SNRs above 1 microL/min. Interestingly, even at the lowest flow rates tested, they compare well with nanospray capillaries in terms of mass spectral performances. Secondly, they can be operated with acetonitrile from 10 up to 99% (v/v), with flow rates from 250 nL/min up to 4 microL/min.

    "79": "The primary standard therapy in patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension is carried out by means of monotherapy with synthetic prostaglandin analogues. Most of the glaucoma patients need more than one medication for adequate intraocular pressure control. Timolol represents the basic component of these combinations. Timolol topical ophthalmic combinations with dorzolamide (Cosopt), pilocarpine, latanoprost (Xalacom), travoprost and unoprostone are thoroughly described. Most antiglaucoma medications achieve on one side directly baroprotection by decreasing intraocular pressure and on the other side they produce indirectly vasoprotection, that is secondary to intraocular pressure lowering. The Cosopt, due to its Dorzolamide component, makes an exception since it produces directly both baroprotection by aqueous humor flow suppression and vasoprotection by increasing the blood flow within the retina, choroid, optic nerve head and retrobulbar area. Given these considerations as well as the fact that the ocular hypotensive effect of both the Cosopt and the latanoprost are equally potent, a question seems reasonable according to accepted standard i.e. Cosopt or latanoprost as primary glaucoma therapy?",

Echoreflectivity analysis was conducted on ultrasound tracings of the midapex septum with specifically designed and validated software. A color histogram of reflecting echoes was obtained, and its spread (broadband [BB], previously shown to correlate directly with collagen volume fraction on endomyocardial biopsies) was used as the primary outcome measure. Mean color scale and serum markers of collagen synthesis (PIP, PIIIP) or degradation (CITP) were secondary outcome variables. Echoreflectivity analysis proved feasible in 106 patients (losartan 52, atenolol 54). Losartan reduced BB over 36 weeks (from 114.5 to 104.3 color levels, P<0.02), whereas atenolol treatment was associated with an increase in BB (from 109.0 to 113.6 color levels, P=NS), the difference between treatments being -12.8 color levels (95% CI -23.6 to -2.0, P=0.02).

    "89": "P-glycoprotein (PGP) substrates with high membrane permeability, such as propranolol and verapamil, are considered to be essentially \"transparent\" to PGP since the transporter does not significantly limit their absorption or elimination. However, the question of whether such compounds can modulate PGP expression in epithelial cells following short-term exposure, with potential consequences for drug interactions, has not been addressed. LS180 colonic epithelial cells were exposed to propranolol or verapamil at concentrations (50-300 microM) consistent with those likely to be present in the gut lumen during oral dosing. Both compounds stimulated four to six-fold increases in MDR1 mRNA and PGP protein expression measured by quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. These changes were accompanied by an induction in transporter activity measured by rhodamine 123 efflux. In contrast, metoprolol, a compound with similar permeability but no affinity for PGP had no effect on PGP expression. The induction of PGP by propranolol and verapamil was rapid with significant increases occurring within 3h with maximal stimulation after 6h exposure. Rifampicin, shown to cause clinical drug interactions via a PXR-mediated increase in PGP expression, exhibited a very similar time-course and extent of induction. In conclusion, verapamil and propranolol, whose trans-epithelial permeability are unaffected by PGP, appear to be effective inducers of PGP expression in gut epithelial cells in vitro. While the in vivo significance of these observations is unknown, this questions whether high permeability, \"PGP-transparent\" compounds, currently favoured in drug selection strategies, should be evaluated in terms of their potential for transporter-mediated drug interactions.", 
    "90": "Obesity and insulin resistance confer increased risk for accelerated coronary disease and cardiomyopathic phenomena. We have previously shown that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) prevents coronary perimicrovascular fibrosis in genetically obese mice that develop insulin resistance. This study was performed to elucidate mechanism(s) implicated and to determine the effects of attenuation of angiotensin II (Ang) II. Genetically obese ob/ob mice were given ACE inhibitor (temocapril) or Ang II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blocker (olmesartan) from 10 to 20 weeks. Cardiac expressions of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, the major physiologic inhibitor of fibrinolysis, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1), a prototypic profibrotic molecule, were determined and extent of perivascular coronary fibrosis was measured. Twenty-week-old obese mice exhibited increased plasma levels of PAI-1 and TGF-beta(1) compared with the values in lean counterpart. Perivascular coronary fibrosis in arterioles and small arteries was evident in obese mice that also showed increased left ventricular collagen as measured by hydroxyproline assay. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the deposition of perivascular type 1 collagen. Markedly increased PAI-1 and TGF-beta were seen immunohistochemically in coronary vascular wall and confirmed by western blotting. When obese mice were treated with temocapril or olmesartan from 10 to 20 weeks, both were equally effective and prevented increases in perivascular fibrosis, plasma PAI-1 and TGF-beta(1), left ventricular collagen and mural immunoreactivity for PAI-1, TGF-beta and collagen type 1. The c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) activity was elevated in the left ventricle of obese mice (western) and blocked by temocapril and olmesartan. Ang II-mediated upregulation of PAI-1 and TGF-beta(1) with collagen deposition may explain the mechanism of perivascular fibrosis in obese mice. ACE inhibition and blockade of AT(1) receptor may prevent coronary perivascular fibrosis and collagen deposition even before development of overt diabetes. JNK activation may be a mediator of obesity-related cardiac dysfunction and a potential therapeutic target.",

Atropine reduced, while hexamethonium completely abolished the arrhythmogenic effect of endothelin-1 during nitric oxide synthase inhibition. Atenolol potentiated arrhythmogenic activity of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine, but endothelin-1 had no effect on the incidence of arrhythmias under these conditions.",

    "103": "The present study was carried out in five cats which did not attack the rats spontaneously. Predatory attack on an anaesthetized rat was elicited by electrical stimulation of extreme lateral regions of hypothalamus. These sites were stimulated at a current strength from 300-700 microa to evoke a predatory attack on an anaesthetized rat. The attack was accompanied by minimal affective display such as alertness, pupillary dilatation, and culminated in beck biting at higher current strength. A scoring system allowed the construction of stimulus response curves, which remained fairly constant when repeated over a period of 3-4 weeks. Microinfusions of norepineprine and clonidine in 4.0 and 5.0 microg dose respectively in locus ceruleus and adjoining tegmental fields facilitated the predatory attack and there was a significant reduction in the threshold current strength for the elicitation of affective and somatomotor components. Microinfusions of yohimbine, an alpha-2 blocker, in 5 microg dose completely blocked the predatory attach response as indicated by an increase in the threshold current strength for the affective components. The somatomotor components were completely inhibited and could not be elicited even when the current strength was increased to 1000 microA. The predatory attack behavior remained completely inhibited for almost two hours following microinfusion of yohimbine. During this period, the animal was extremely drowsy and reacted very slowly even to a painful stimulus such as pinching of tail. Microinfusions of propranalol (beta-blocker), practalol (beta-1 blocker), prazosin (alpha-1 antagonist), propylene glycol as well as saline in similar volumes (0.5 microl) as control failed to produce any blocking effect, thus indicating the involvement of alpha-2 adrenoceptive mechanisms in the modulation of predatory attack in this region of midbrain. The facilitatory effects of norepinephrine and clonidine were significant at P<0.01 and P<0.05 respectively with Wilcoxon's signed rank test. The inhibitory effects of yohimbine were significant at P<0.05. The present study indicates the involvement of alpha-2 adrenoceptive mechanisms in the facilitation of hypothalamically elicited predatory attack.", 
    "104": "The vertebrate system of steroid hormones appears to have been conserved widely throughout the animal kingdom. The sex hormone estrogen, 17-beta-estradiol (E2), long considered to be exclusively a vertebrate hormone, is found also in invertebrates related to reproductive and developmental processes such as spawning, vitellogenesis and molting. These processes are affected by estrogen induced changes at the genomic level and take place at a large time scale. The discovery of surface membrane receptors for E2 has opened new possibilities for the involvement of estrogen in biological functions other than reproductive. These processes take place within a few seconds to minutes and involve sudden cytosolic calcium transients, activation of adenylate cyclase or activation of phospholipase C (PLC). E2 can modulate the production of nitric oxide (NO) in endotheliar and other cells. A similar mechanism linking estrogen to cNOS catalized nitric oxide (NO) release is reported herein for the first time in several tissues of the giant cockroach Blaberus craniifer. This process has been identified in the brain, nerve cord, vasculature and ovaries. This effect is concentration dependent and is inhibited by tamoxifen an estrogen receptor blocker.", 
    "105": "Human emotional experience is typically associated with enhanced episodic memory. We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging to demonstrate that successful encoding of emotional, compared to neutral, verbal stimuli evokes increased human amygdala responses. Items that evoke amygdala activation at encoding evoke greater hippocampal responses at retrieval compared to neutral items. Administration of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol at encoding abolishes the enhanced amygdala encoding and hippocampal retrieval effects, despite propranolol being no longer present at retrieval. Thus, memory-related amygdala responses at encoding and hippocampal responses at recognition for emotional items depend on beta-adrenergic engagement at encoding. Our results suggest that human emotional memory is associated with a beta-adrenergic-dependent modulation of amygdala-hippocampal interactions.", 
    "106": "Chronic heart failure (HF) has become a significant healthcare problem in the US. The number of new cases per year continues to grow steadily due to an ageing population and improved survival from acute coronary syndromes. As a consequence, the management of HF patients is of great importance. Effective management of HF includes stabilising the patient and improving the clinical symptoms associated with HF. Patients with HF have increased sympathetic nervous system activity that contributes to impaired cardiovascular function over time and subsequently results in death. beta-blockers prevent such impairment through inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system neurohormonal pathway. Numerous clinical trials conducted over the past decade have demonstrated that beta-blockers, in conjunction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, are not only effective but are superior to other medical interventions for the treatment of HF. The standard of care for patients with HF now includes beta-blockers as well as ACE inhibitors.",

Among patients aged 75 years and over, a smaller proportion of female patients received acetylsalicylic acid in hospital than did male patients (87% versus 95%; P=0.026). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that, after correction for age, use of other anticoagulants/antiplatelets and death within 24 h of admission, sex was no longer an independent predictor for receipt of acetylsalicylic acid in hospital. Medications prescribed at discharge were similar between male and female patients.",

Compared with placebo, the use of long-acting beta2 agonists was associated with 25% fewer exacerbations (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.64-0.88; P =.43 for heterogeneity); when added to inhaled corticosteroids, there was a 26% reduction above that achieved by steroid monotherapy (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61-0.91; P =.07 for heterogeneity).

Anti-IgE therapy may be considered as adjunctive therapy for young adults with asthma who have clear evidence of allergies and elevated serum IgE levels.", 
    "122": "A low-taurine diet during fetal or early postnatal life causes abnormal pancreatic beta-cell development. Tissue and plasma taurine concentrations can also be low in diabetic patients. We examined the effect of taurine on impaired glucose responses in diabetic rat beta-cells adenovirally overexpressing uncoupling protein (UCP)2, which is upregulated in obesity-related type 2 diabetes. We found that taurine pretreatment restored the ATP-to-ADP (ATP/ADP) ratio and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in UCP2-infected islets. ATP-sensitive K(+) channel sensitivity to dihydroxyacetone, another insulin secretagogue, was similar in both UCP2-infected and control beta-cells. In freshly isolated mitochondria from UCP2-overexpressing insulin-secreting (INS)-1 beta-cells, methyl pyruvate-mediated mitochondrial Ca(2+) increase was significantly ameliorated by taurine. A mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter blocker, ruthenium red, inhibited the action of taurine. This study suggests that taurine enhances the glucose sensitivity of UCP2-overexpressing beta-cells, probably by increasing mitochondrial Ca(2+) influx through the Ca(2+) uniporter, thereby enhancing mitochondrial metabolic function and increasing the ATP/ADP ratio.", 
    "123": "It has been proposed that anti-myocardial antibodies (Ab) against neurotransmitter (NT) receptors are involved in the immunopathology of chronic Chagas' heart disease. We demonstrated that an anti-Trypanosoma cruzi monoclonal Ab (mAb), CAK20.12, binds to murine cardiac beta-adrenergic and muscarinic acetyl choline (mACh) receptors eliciting abnormal physiological responses on normal heart. No cross-linking requirement for mAb actions was demonstrated using Fab fragment derived from CAK20.12. mAb binding to synthetic peptides from the second extracellular loop of both beta1-adrenergic and mACh receptors, demonstrated by ELISA, identified the region of NT receptors involved. Cross-reactivity between these peptides and T. cruzi antigen was confirmed by binding inhibition assays. These results support the existence of cross-reactivity due to molecular mimicry between a parasite antigen and the major antigenic epitopes present on both beta1-adrenergic and M2-ACh receptors. Its possible relationship with cardiac dysfunction during chronic stage of Chagas' disease is also discussed.",

Total TWSTRS scores improved by 79%, and severity subscores improved significantly, from 15.7 +/- 2.1 to 7.7 +/- 2.9 (paired t-test, p = 0.02). Pain and disability subscores improved from 25.5 +/- 4.1 to 3.3 +/- 3.1 (paired t-test, p = 0.002) and from 13.3 +/- 4.9 to 3.3 +/- 4.2 (paired t-test, p = 0.06), respectively.",

    "127": "Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 is increased in particular brain regions after birth, suggesting an involvement of some regulatory neuronal circuits. To address the neuronal activity responsible for FGF-1 synthesis, effects of various neurotransmitter receptor activation on cellular FGF-1 content were examined using cultured rat cortical neurons. Histamine, glutamate, carbachol, serotonin or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) caused an increase of FGF-1 content. Because this effect was mimicked by (1) N-methyl-D-aspartate, a glutamatergic agonist; (2) Ca(2+) ionophore; (3) depolarization with high concentration of KCl, but was abolished in Ca(2+)-free medium, Ca(2+) influx was thought to trigger FGF-1 synthesis. Such Ca(2+)-mediated enhancement of FGF-1 synthesis, however, did not occur in the presence of norepinephrine (NE), but was restored by KT-5720, an inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA), suggesting an interplay between Ca(2+)-activated and cAMP/PKA signals for neuronal FGF-1 synthesis. This mechanism was proved to function in vivo by stimulation of FGF-1 expression in neurons of the cerebral cortex after intracerebral administration of propranolol, an antagonist of adrenergic beta receptors. This demonstrates that FGF-1 synthesis is essentially upregulated by Ca(2+) influx through excitatory neuronal activities, but such an effect is abolished by neurotransmission that evokes cAMP/PKA signals. FGF-1 produced is thought to act on establishment and maintenance of particular neuronal circuits in the brain, which may be one of the ways neurotransmitters regulate brain function.", 
    "128": "Mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular disease are high in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The cardiovascular profile of patients with ESRD may differ from that of the general population. We examined how nephrologists and cardiologists differ in managing hypertension and cardiovascular disease in patients with ESRD.", 
    "129": "Seven cases incorporating relevant clinical and echocardiographic findings common to this population were developed based on a chart review of an ESRD population. Each ESRD case incorporated a clinical presentation designed to test for a specific dichotomous response to a common and important clinical problem. Nine nephrology and 7 cardiology faculty members, each paired with a senior clinical fellow from the discipline, were surveyed.", 
    "130": "Nephrologists were less likely than cardiologists to initiate beta-blockade in patients with echocardiographic evidence of regional wall motion abnormalities if there was no history of coronary artery disease (CAD; P < 0.01). In patients with known CAD, cardiologists were more likely than nephrologists to intensify antihypertensive therapy, even in the setting of a history of fractures associated with orthostatic hypotension (P < 0.02). Decision making did not differ between subspecialists in the management of left ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, or diastolic dysfunction.", 
    "131": "Nephrologists and cardiologists differ in their management of hypertension in the presence of ischemic heart disease in the ESRD population. Only limited data specific to the ESRD population are available to assess which approach is superior. The discipline-driven differential management approaches observed emphasize the need for better evidence-based management strategies for this population.", 
    "132": "Arterial stiffness is a key determinant of cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients. beta-Blockers appear to be less effective than other drugs in improving outcome in hypertensive patients, and a potential explanation may be that beta-blockers are less effective in reducing arterial stiffness. The aim of this study was to assess the direct effect of beta-blockade on pulse wave velocity (PWV), a robust measure of arterial distensibility, using a local, ovine, hind-limb model. In addition, we hypothesized that the vasodilating beta-blocker nebivolol, but not atenolol, would increase arterial distensibility in vivo. All studies were conducted in anesthetized sheep. PWV was recorded in vivo using a dual pressure-sensing catheter placed in the common iliac artery. Intraarterial infusion of nebivolol reduced PWV by 6+/-3% at the higher dose (P<0.001), but did not alter mean arterial pressure (change of -1+/-3 mm Hg, P=0.1). In contrast, atenolol had no effect on PWV (P=0.11) despite a small drop in mean pressure (change of -5+/-3 mm Hg, P<0.01). Infusion of glyceryl trinitrate led to a dose-dependent fall in PWV, and 2 nmol/min produced a similar reduction in PWV to the higher dose of nebivolol (500 nmol/min). The effect of nebivolol on PWV was significantly attenuated during coinfusion of N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (P=0.003) and also during coinfusion of butoxamine (P=0.02). These results demonstrate that nebivolol, but not atenolol, increases arterial distensibility. This effect of nebivolol is mediated through the release of NO via a beta2 adrenoceptor-dependent mechanism. Thus, nebivolol may be of benefit in conditions of increased large artery stiffness, such as isolated systolic hypertension.", 
    "133": "Blockade of angiotensin II type-1 (AT1) receptors has been shown to reduce the magnitude of the blood pressure response to noradrenaline in pithed rats via an unidentified mechanism. Dose-response curves were established for the noradrenaline-induced (10(-12) to 10(-7) mol/kg) increase of diastolic blood pressure in pithed rats treated with tubocurarine, propranolol, and atropine. Candesartan (1 mg/kg) increased the ED50 of the noradrenaline response (1.3+/-0.1 nmol/kg) up to 20-fold. Vasopressor responsiveness to noradrenaline was attenuated specifically, whereas the vasopressin-induced increase in diastolic blood pressure was maintained. Specific involvement of AT1 receptors was confirmed by equivalent actions of losartan. Blockade of norepinephrine transporter or alpha2-adrenoceptors using desipramine or rauwolscine reduced the losartan-induced shifts in the ED50 values of noradrenaline by 63% and 21%, respectively. Combined blockade of norepinephrine transporter and alpha2-adrenoceptors eliminated the influence of losartan on noradrenaline sensitivity (ED50 5.5+/-1.3 versus 5.6+/-1.2 nmol/kg), a result also observed after sympathetic denervation by reserpine (ED50 7.1+/-0.8 versus 7.8+/-0.8 nmol/kg). Our experiments show that the reduction of vascular noradrenaline sensitivity by AT1 blockade is dependent on the intact functioning of both neuronal noradrenaline uptake via norepinephrine transporter and presynaptic alpha2-mediated autoinhibition, exclusively provided by the sympathetic innervation. These newly identified mechanisms may contribute to the antihypertensive and protective actions of AT1 blockers.", 
    "134": "The blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors reduces both mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure, but the cellular mechanism remains unclear. Celiprolol, a selective beta(1)-blocker, was reported to stimulate the expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in the heart, and NO levels have been demonstrated to be related to myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure. Thus, we aimed to clarify whether celiprolol attenuates both myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure via the NO-signal pathway.", 
    "135": "In rat neonatal cardiac myocytes, celiprolol inhibited protein synthesis stimulated by either isoproterenol or phenylephrine, which was partially suppressed by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Four weeks after transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in C57BL/6 male mice, the ratio of heart weight to body weight (mg/g) (8.70+/-0.42 in TAC, 6.61+/-0.44 with celiprolol 100 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) PO, P<0.01) and the ratio of lung weight to body weight (mg/g) (10.27+/-1.08 in TAC, 7.11+/-0.70 with celiprolol 100 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) PO, P<0.05) were lower and LV fractional shortening was higher in the celiprolol-treated groups than in the TAC group. All of these improvements were blunted by L-NAME. Celiprolol treatment significantly increased myocardial eNOS and activated phosphorylation of eNOS. Myocardial mRNA levels of natriuretic peptide precursor type B and protein inhibitor of NO synthase, which were increased in the TAC mice, were decreased in the celiprolol-treated mice.", 
    "136": "These findings indicated that celiprolol attenuates cardiac myocyte hypertrophy both in vitro and in vivo and halts the process leading from hypertrophy to heart failure. These effects are mediated by a selective beta1-adrenergic receptor blockade and NO-dependent pathway.", 
    "137": "Despite better outcomes with early coronary artery reperfusion for the treatment of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI), morbidity and mortality from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remain significant, the incidence of congestive heart failure continues to increase, and there is a need to provide better cardioprotection (therapy that reduces the amount of necrosis that may be coupled with better clinical outcome) in the setting of AMI. Since the introduction of the concept of cardiac protection over a quarter of a century ago, various interventions have been investigated to reduce myocardial infarct size. Intravenous beta-blockers administered in the early hours of infarction were clearly shown to be of benefit. Intravenous adenosine appeared promising for anterior wall AMIs, as did cariporide in some studies. Glucose-insulin-potassium infusion was beneficial in certain subgroups of patients, particularly diabetics. A variety of other medications were studied with negative or marginal results. The best strategy to limit infarct size is early reperfusion with percutaneous coronary stenting or thrombolytic therapy. Stenting is superior and should be adopted whenever there is a qualified laboratory available. Available resources should focus on decreasing time from onset of symptoms to start of reperfusion and maintaining vessel patency. Future studies powered to better assess clinical outcome are needed for adjunctive therapy with adenosine, K(ATP) channel openers, Na(+)/H(+) exchange inhibitors, and hypothermia.",

The mean initial and maximum doses were 0.15 +/- 0.09 and 0.98 +/- 0.26 mg/kg/day. Adverse effects occurred in 5 patients (21%). Two patients (8%) required discontinuation of the drug within 5 weeks of the initial dose. The remaining 22 patients tolerated carvedilol for a mean follow-up period of 26.6 +/- 14.7 months. Among these 22 patients, mean left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 24.6 +/- 7.6% to 42.2 +/- 14.2% (p < 0.001), and mean sphericity index from 0.86 +/- 0.11 to 0.74 +/- 0.10 (p < 0.001). New York Heart Association functional class improved in 15 patients (68%). One patient (4%) died and 3 (14%) were transplanted.", 
    "141": "Carvedilol, in addition to standard therapy for dilated cardiomyopathy in children improves cardiac function and symptoms; it is well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects, but close monitoring is necessary as it might worsen congestive heart failure and precipitate asthma.

    "142": "We examined the effect of CP-154,526 on cardiovascular changes elicited in conscious rabbits by stressful stimuli (loud sound, cage move, pinprick, formaldehyde vapour and air-jet stress). CP-154,526 substantially reduced pressor and heart rate responses to these stimuli (both vagally and sympathetically mediated), and reduced QT shortening during air-jet stress. Blocking of central CRF1 receptors attenuates cardiovascular responses to environmental stimuli, presumably by affecting brain centres that control cardiovascular functions.", 
    "143": "Loss of noradrenergic (NE) neurones in the locus ceruleus and compensatory changes in NE activity have been described in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but have never been linked to treatment. The hypothesis of this study was that central NE responsivity would predict aggression response to treatment with a NE medication, pindolol. Fifteen institutionalized AD subjects [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), mean 3.3 +/- 4.6] with significant behavioural disturbances (Neuropsychiatric Inventory Score, mean 30.6 +/- 14.6) were studied. Growth hormone (GH) response to clonidine challenge (5 microg/kg) was used as a measure of central NE responsivity. Subjects were then randomized to 7 weeks of treatment with pindolol, maximum dose 20 mg b.i.d., or an identical placebo capsule in a cross-over design. The primary outcome measure was change on the retrospective Overt Aggression Scale (r-OAS). Five of 11 completers (45%) had decreased total r-OAS scores. There was significant improvement noted on the r-OAS verbal aggression subscale (paired t = -2.5, p = 0.03) compared to placebo, but not r-OAS total. Higher baseline aggression, higher MMSE and lower GH response predicted improvement in aggression, accounting for 82% of the variance (r = 0.91, F = 10.5, p = 0.006). Changes in NE responsivity, as reflected by a blunted GH response to clonidine challenge and more severe aggression, were associated with better response to the NE agent pindolol. Individual patient characteristics, including underlying neurotransmitter changes, may be useful for predicting response to therapy.",

His symptoms resolved promptly after treatment with potassium, a 3-adrenergic blocking agent, and propylthiouracil.

    "152": "Development of new drugs is a sophisticated process that requires several, different methods. In our experiments we have applied two rheological models to study experimental and clinically used drugs. The antioxidant properties of several agents were estimated by erythrocyte filtration technique. The known antioxidant compound vitamin E was used to validate our measurements. An experimental cardioprotective agent, H-2545 provided significant protection against oxidative changes in red blood cell filterability (p<0.001). Although some of the examined, known cardiovascular drugs also showed significant antioxidant effect, they were less efficient than H-2545 and the scavenger effect of this novel agent exceeded the antioxidant properties of vitamin E. Modification of mexiletine with a pyrroline ring improved significantly its antioxidant capacity suggesting this molecular segment to be responsible for the antioxidant effect. In our second model the antiplatelet effect of experimental poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors was evaluated. Two widely used antiplatelet agents: acetyl salicylic acid and eptifibatide served as controls in the validation of the measurements. PARP inhibitors reduced ADP-induced platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05). However, their hindrance on platelet aggregation waned as the concentration of ADP rose. Regarding the platelets' role in the development of ischemic vascular diseases, the antiaggregating property of PARP inhibitors may exert additional beneficial effects on tissue blood supply under conditions of compromised vascular flow.",

We suggest circumstances in which the initiation of therapy with a fixed two-drug combination might be preferable to the usual practice of starting with monotherapy followed by upward titration and addition of other agents, and we briefly review the existing fixed drug combinations. We end with the intriguing and provocative notion of the future \"polypill,\" a fixed combination of agents addressing various components of the metabolic syndrome as well as other coexisting common risk factors in both high-risk patients with conditions requiring polypharmacy and in healthy, asymptomatic individuals.",

They felt that echocardiograms can be difficult to access, were of unclear benefit and may not be warranted in obvious cases. Concerns about possible side effects and reliance on other forms of therapy were common reasons for the suboptimal use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

    "167": "LVM changes were significantly associated with antihypertensive treatment, with lower LVM with Per/Ind than with atenolol. Changes in SBP and PP, but not in MBP and DBP, were more significantly associated with Per/Ind than with atenolol, with more pronounced effects using central than brachial measurements, and a longer delay in central return of wave reflections under Per/Ind. In the sampling of 52 patients with tonometry, the change in LVM between the two drug regimens was significantly linked to central, but not brachial, PP change.", 
    "168": "This observational study shows a lower LVM under Per/Ind than under atenolol. The greater change in LVM on Per/Ind was linked to central and not brachial blood pressure.", 
    "169": "N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (Nt-proBNP) and N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (Nt-proANP) are strong cardiovascular risk markers in patients with chronic heart failure, as well as in the general population. We investigated whether high Nt-proBNP or Nt-proANP could also predict the composite endpoint (CEP) of cardiovascular death, non-fatal stroke or non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients with hypertension and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy.", 
    "170": "After 2 weeks of placebo treatment, clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic variables were assessed in 183 hypertensive participants in the LIFE echo substudy with electrocardiographic LV hypertrophy. Nt-proBNP and Nt-proANP were measured by immunoassay at baseline. The patients were followed for 60 +/- 5 months.", 
    "171": "Using Cox regression analysis, the 25 CEP were predicted by ln(Nt-proBNP) (hazard ratio 1.61 per 2.73-fold increase, P < 0.01) as well as ln(Nt-proANP) (hazard ratio 2.93, P < 0.05). Nt-proBNP above the median value of 21.8 pmol/ml was associated with higher incidence of CEP (19.6 versus 7.7%, P < 0.05). Nt-proBNP above the median value was associated with higher incidence of CEP in the 123 patients without history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease (14.8 versus 4.3%, P < 0.05), but the association was insignificant in the 60 patients with a history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease (26.3 versus 18.2%, NS). Nt-proANP showed the same tendency.", 
    "172": "Nt-proBNP, more than Nt-proANP, strongly predicts cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension and LV hypertrophy, especially in patients without diabetes or clinically overt cardiovascular disease.", 
    "173": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists have a role in alveolar fluid reabsorption, via Na,K-ATPase, in the alveolar epithelium. Alveolar fluid reabsorption increased approximately twofold with increasing concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) as compared with control rats. Treatment with the nonselective alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist, octopamine, and the specific alpha(1) agonist, phenylephrine, increased alveolar fluid reabsorption by 54 and 40%, respectively, as compared with control. The specific alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist, prazosin, inhibited the stimulatory effects of NE by approximately 30%, whereas alpha(2)-adrenergic antagonist, yohimbine, did not prevent the stimulatory effects of NE. The administration of ouabain, Na,K-ATPase inhibitor, prevented the NE-mediated increase in alveolar fluid reabsorption. In parallel with these changes, NE increased Na,K-ATPase activity and protein abundance in alveolar epithelial type II cells via the alpha(1)- and beta-adrenergic receptor. We report here that NE increased alveolar fluid reabsorption via the activation of both alpha(1)- and beta-adrenergic receptors, but not alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors. These effects are due to increased activity and abundance of the Na,K-ATPase in the basolateral membrane of ATII cells.", 
    "174": "Since its introduction in 1996, brimonidine tartrate 0.2% ophthalmic solution (Alphagan, Allergan) twice daily has become established as an effective intra ocular pressure-lowering treatment. While the efficacy of Alphagan cannot be questioned, we gained the clinical impression that the drug has an unacceptably high rate of allergy. Of greater concern, we suspected that patients suffering from local Alphagan allergy had a higher rate of allergy to subsequently used topical preparations. We analysed data from a large scale study of glaucoma patients to establish whether our suspicions were correct.", 
    "175": "We have created a database of the entire glaucoma treatment histories for consecutive patients attending a single consultant's clinics (DMIM) at Glasgow Royal Infirmary between May 1999 and September 2001. All have undergone medical treatment for primary open angle glaucoma, ocular hypertension, or normal tension glaucoma. Patients with any other form of glaucoma, and patients in whom a full record of treatment was not available were excluded from the study.", 
    "176": "Alphagan was discontinued due to allergy on 73 per 100,000 patient treatment days. This was a far higher frequency than for other preparations. In patients allergic to both Alphagan and another preparation (Timoptol, Trusopt and Xalatan), the mean interval between the first and second allergy was shorter when Alphagan allergy occurred first. This was statistically significant in Timoptol and Trusopt cross-reactivity.", 
    "177": "Alphagan has high allergenicity, and may increase the likelihood of allergy to subsequently used preparations.", 
    "178": "Understanding the neuropharmacological mechanisms mediating attentional enhancement by nicotine would help a targeted search for nicotinic compounds with retained therapeutic but reduced unwanted side-effects. Previous studies suggested that the dopamine-releasing effects of nicotine may not be of primary importance for its attention-enhancing properties.", 
    "179": "The present study examined the role of noradrenergic neurotransmission for the effects of nicotine on different response indices of an attentional paradigm.", 
    "180": "The effects of systemic injections of the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin that also displays significant affinity at alpha(2B) and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol were tested in both the presence and absence of nicotine in rats trained in a version of the five-choice serial reaction time task.", 
    "181": "Nicotine generally enhanced the accuracy of signal detection, reduced omission errors and shortened response latencies. At the largest doses tested, both prazosin (1 mg/kg) and propranolol (10 mg/kg) impaired performance. For propranolol, these effects depended on the rate of target signal presentation. The two compounds differentially modulated the effects of nicotine. Propranolol (6 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) but not prazosin reduced its effects on omission errors and accuracy. By contrast, prazosin (0.5 mg/kg) reversed the nicotine-induced reductions in response latency.", 
    "182": "The data provide the first evidence that beta-adrenoceptors are involved in mediating the effects of nicotine on signal detection, while activation of alpha-adrenoceptors may contribute to its effects on response speed. This is a further indication that, from among nicotine's wide range of neuropharmacological effects, specific facets can be dissociated that are responsible for its attention-enhancing properties.", 
    "183": "Post-training administration of different doses of baclofen (a GABAB agonist) has been shown to impair memory retention, in a step-down passive avoidance test in mice. We have studied the effects of beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists on baclofen-induced memory impairment in mice. Dobutamine (a beta 1-agonist) or salbutamol (a beta 2-agonist) reversed the memory impairment induced by baclofen without exhibiting intrinsic actions on memory when administered alone. The administration of atenolol (a beta 1-antagonist) or propranolol (a beta-antagonist) produced a memory impairment. When co-administered with baclofen, both atenolol and propranolol exacerbated the memory impairment induced by the GABAB agonist. It is concluded that beta-adrenergic mechanisms may be involved in the modulation of memory via GABAB receptors.", 
    "184": "The majority of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are hypertensive. Drug therapy for hypertension in hemodialysis (HD) patients includes all classes of antihypertensive drugs, with the sole exception of diuretics. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers may decrease morbidity and mortality by reducing the mean arterial pressure (MAP), aortic pulse wave velocity, and aortic systolic pressure augmentation, as well as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and probably reduction of C-reactive protein (CRP) and oxidant stress. Potential risk factors include hyperkalemia, anaphylactoid reaction with AN69 membranes (particularly ACE inhibitors), and aggravation of renal anemia. beta-blockers decrease not only mortality, blood pressure (BP), and ventricular arrhythmias, but also improve left ventricular function in ESRD patients. Nonselective beta-blockers can cause an increase in serum potassium (particularly during fasting or exercise). Lisinopril and atenolol have a predominant renal excretion and therefore a prolonged half life in ESRD patients. Thus thrice-weekly supervised administration of these drugs after HD can enhance BP control. The use of calcium channel blockers is also associated with lower total and cardiovascular-specific mortality in HD patients. Minoxidil is a very potent vasodilator that is generally reserved for dialysis patients with severe hypertension. Hypertensive dialysis patients who are noncompliant with their medications may benefit from transdermal clonidine therapy once a week. The majority of dialysis patients need a combination of several antihypertensive drugs for adequate BP control.", 
    "185": "Heart rate turbulence (HRT) is a powerful novel predictor for cardiovascular mortality. Chronic congestive heart failure is associated with abnormal HRT. Whether antiadrenergic beta-blocker therapy can restore control of HRT in patients with chronic congestive heart failure is unknown.", 
    "186": "A 24-hour Holter ECG recording was obtained before and 1 and 3 months after titrated addition of atenolol therapy in 10 consecutive patients with advanced congestive heart failure. Two parameters derived from HRT, turbulence slope (TS) and turbulence onset (TO), and time- and frequency-domain heart rate variability (HRV) parameters (SDNN, RMSSD, VLF, LF, HF) from 24-hour ECG were compared before and after beta-blocker therapy, together with the same parameters in age-matched normal control. Results showed that TS (3.1 +/- 2.2 vs 6.2 +/- 3.0; P = 0.001) and all HRV parameters were increased after 3 months of atenolol treatment. No changes in TO were evident (0.6 +/- 0.5 vs -0.2 +/- 1.3; P = 0.13). The improvement of TS and the vagally mediated parameters of mean R-R interval, RMSSD, and the HF component of HRV were positively correlated.", 
    "187": "Abnormal HRT caused by chronic congestive heart failure can be restored by beta-blocker therapy. The evolution of TS was positively correlated with measures of vagal modulation of heart rate.", 
    "188": "We previously demonstrated an increase in Fos expression in the heart during morphine withdrawal. In the present study we examined the role of beta- and alpha-adrenoceptors in naloxone-precipitated increases in Fos expression in the heart. Dependence on morphine was induced by 7-day chronic subcutaneous implantation of six morphine pellets (75 mg). Morphine withdrawal was precipitated by administration of naloxone (5 mg/kg subcutaneously) on day 8. Using immunohistochemical staining of Fos, the present results indicate that morphine withdrawal induced marked Fos immunoreactivity (Fos-IR) within the cardiomyocyte nuclei. Moreover, Western blot analysis revealed a peak expression of c-fos in the right and left ventricles after naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in parallel with an increase in noradrenaline (NA) turnover. In the second study, the effects of the administration of adrenoceptor antagonists on withdrawal-induced Fos expression in the heart were studied. Pretreatment with the beta antagonist, propranolol (3 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (1 mg/kg intraperitoneally) did not block the marked Fos-IR or the hyperactivity of catecholaminergic neurons observed in the heart during withdrawal. However, pre-treatment with alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (1 mg/kg intraperitoneally), 20 min before naloxone administration to morphine-dependent rats antagonized Fos expression and the enhancement of NA turnover in the heart. Collectively, these results suggest that noradrenergic neurons in the heart are active during morphine withdrawal, and that activation of transcriptional responses mediated by Fos are dependent upon cardiac alpha2-adrenoceptor."
