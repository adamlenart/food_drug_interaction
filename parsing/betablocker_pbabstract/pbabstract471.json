To determine if the sensitive period for these events extends to prenatal ages, pregnant rats were infused with propranolol continuously via osmotic minipumps from gestational day 7 through parturition and the offspring were examined for markers of cardiac cellular development (basal ornithine decarboxylase activity and levels of DNA and protein) and for reactivity to acute beta-adrenergic challenge (heart rate responses and stimulation of ornithine decarboxylase). During the propranolol infusion, fetal cardiac responses to terbutaline, a beta-adrenergic agonist, were completely blocked; after discontinuation of beta-blockade at birth, responses became normal and remained unaffected into young adulthood. Biochemical markers indicated a delay in cellular development caused by propranolol: basal ornithine decarboxylase activity was elevated in the fetus and DNA was subnormal for the first week after birth. Cardiac growth was maintained in the face of DNA deficits by cell enlargement (elevated protein/DNA) which persisted through weaning. By young adulthood, all markers were within normal limits. These data suggest that fetal catecholamines, acting on beta-receptors, do play an initial role in cardiac cellular development, but that the critical period for programming of beta-adrenergic responsiveness occurs later in maturation.", 
    "1": "Total coumarins in the fruit of Cnidium monnieri show a marked protective effect against bronchial asthma induced by inhalation of histamine in conscious guinea pig. In vitro these total coumarins can relax the contraction of the isolated trachea in guinea pigs induced by histamine as well as increase the perfusion rate of isolated lung preparation of guinea pig. These actions, however, may be blocked by propranolol. Besides, these coumarins cannot increase the heart rate and arterial blood pressure in anesthetized rats. All this shows that the antiasthmatic effect of total coumarins in the fruit of Cnidium monnieri is mediated by beta 2-receptor.", 
    "2": "To study the interaction between physiological and cognitive factors in anxiety, 44 subjects with public speaking anxiety were allocated to four different groups. Two groups received either beta-adrenoceptor blockade (100 mg of atenolol) or placebo orthogonally crossed with an instruction that heart rate would decrease or an instruction that did not mention cardiovascular effects. During the delivery of a speech, measures of heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and self-reported anxiety were obtained. All variables increased during an anticipation period before speech, and heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and self-reported anxiety increased further during speech. Regardless of instructions, atenolol decreased heart rate and systolic blood pressure during both anticipation and speech, whereas no differences were found in self-reported anxiety. This lack of a relationship was seen in spite of the correctly perceived heart rate reduction in the atenolol-treated group receiving an instruction that heart rate would decrease. Cardiac aware subjects, according to the Autonomic Perception Questionnaire, showed higher levels of heart rate and self-reported anxiety at rest than did cardiac unaware subjects. During speech, even though heart rate was similar in atenolol treated groups, self-reported anxiety was higher in cardiac aware than in cardiac unaware subjects. The lack of a relationship between heart rate and self-reported anxiety is discussed in terms of primary and secondary emotions. It is suggested that the perception of external rather than internal cues determines situationally elicited anxiety.",

We describe a typical Stevens-Johnson's syndrome developing 15 days after initiation of propranolol and maprotiline therapy. Other etiologies have been excluded by appropriate investigations and the responsibility of each drug is discussed.", 
    "4": "A comparative study was undertaken to examine the long-acting beta-blocker nadolol without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and reference agents such as anapriline, a beta-blocker, hypothiazide, a diuretic, and pratsiol, a postsynaptic alpha-adrenoblocker in 361 patients with sustained arterial hypertension (diastolic blood pressure, 95 mm Hg or more) in the randomized groups. The therapy was started with monotherapy of one of these drugs; if ineffective, a combination of two or, if necessary, three agents of different groups was given. The patients' status was monitored at least once monthly for 6 months. Monotherapy with beta-blockers or pratsiol was found to be more effective than that with diuretics. Addition of the second agent was required by 48% of the patients, that of the third agent, by 13%. Nadolol in combination with diuretics and/or pratsiol showed the same effects as did anapriline. The agent possessed a more pronounced negative chronotropic action than did anapriline when it was given alone or in combination. Nadolol caused a decrease in middle and small-sized bronchial patency as did anapriline. A 6-month nadolol therapy resulted in regression of left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "5": "Diltiazem, a new calcium antagonist, and metoprolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenoblocker, were comparatively studied in 53 patients with exertional angina and 11 patients with spontaneous angina. A simple blind random method using placebo, graded physical exercise test employing a bicycle ergometer, and Holter monitoring were applied to evaluate the efficiency of the antianginal treatment. A good antianginal effect was exhibited by the both drugs in exercise-induced angina. Diltiazem was found to be effective in 74% of the patients with exertional angina, whereas metoprolol was beneficial in 62%. Unlike diltiazem (85.7%), metoprolol (50.0%) was less potent in spontaneous angina.", 
    "6": "1. We have studied the effect of epithelium removal on relaxation of guinea-pig isolated tracheal smooth muscle induced by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or stimulation of non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) inhibitory nerves. Also examined were the effects of inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). 2. Epithelium removal produced a 3.6 +/- 0.4 fold leftward shift in the VIP concentration-response curve. The supersensitivity to VIP, following epithelium removal was abolished by phosphoramidon or thiorphan (NEP inhibitors), but unaffected by captopril (an ACE inhibitor). In intact trachea, the NEP inhibitors produced leftward shifts in the VIP curves similar to those produced by epithelium removal. 3. In contrast to responses to exogenous VIP, neurogenic NANC inhibitory responses to electrical field stimulation were affected neither by epithelial denudation nor by the peptidase inhibitors. 4. As in previous studies, epithelium removal increased tracheal sensitivity to isoprenaline. This was not altered by pretreatment with a cocktail of peptidase inhibitors. Thus, the effect of the NEP inhibitors on responses to VIP appears to be relatively specific. 5. These data indicate that exogenous VIP is a substrate for airway NEP, since inhibition of the enzyme potentiates the peptide. This is further evidence that the airway epithelium provides a source for the metabolism of mediators. 6. In guinea-pig trachea the NEP responsible for cleaving VIP may be located largely in the epithelial layer, since NEP inhibition was without effect on sensitivity to VIP in epithelium-denuded preparations. If VIP is a NANC inhibitory neurotransmitter in this tissue its degradation endogenously does not appear to involve epithelial NEP.", 
    "7": "This randomized multicentre study in elderly hypertensives with two unbalanced groups (2 patients under labetalol for 1 patient under nifedipine) compared the efficacy and safety of labetalol, whose dosage could be adjusted (1, 2, then 3 tablets/day) according to blood pressure level (BP greater than or equal to 160/95 mmHg), to that of nifedipine given at its recommended dosage (2 tablets/day). The treatment period lasted 6 weeks (D42). The main judgment criteria was the rate of patients with normalized BP under treatment (SBP less than 160 and DBP less than 95 mmHg). The analysis was carried out on 170 patients, 112 labetalol and 58 nifedipine. Both groups were homogeneous when entering into the study. The only difference was a higher rate of smokers in the nifedipine group compared with labetalol's (29% vs 13%). The rate of patients with normalized BP (SBP less than 160 and DBP less than 95 mmHg) were 66% in the labetalol group and 48% in the nifedipine's (p less than 0.05). Treatment withdrawals for all causes during the study were more frequent in the nifedipine group (19%) than in the labetalol's (6%). Treatment withdrawals for adverse events occurred in 3.5% of patients in the labetalol group and in 12% of the nifedipine's. The overall adverse events rate was 9% with labetalol and 29% with nifedipine (p less than 0.001). In this comparative study in elderly hypertensives, labetalol given in a dose titration schedule proved significantly superior to nifedipine, given at recommended maximal dosage, in terms of both BP control and side effects profile.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "9": "We reviewed the records of 26 infants with congenital junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) from seven institutions to examine the evolution in the management of this tachycardia that is difficult to treat. JET was defined electrocardiographically as an incessant tachycardia with normal QRS morphology and atrioventricular (AV) dissociation. The ventricular rate ranged from 140 to 370 beats/min (mean, 230 beats/min); 16 of 26 patients had cardiac failure. Treatment success was defined as a stable decrease in the rate of JET, below 150 beats/min; partial success was a significant decrease of JET rate with alleviation of symptoms. All patients received digoxin with no significant effect. Propranolol was given to 16 patients, with two successes and one partial success. Combinations of other conventional agents were used in 11 patients with two successes; 14 patients were treated with amiodarone, which resulted in eight successes and three partial successes; three patients died suddenly on medical treatment (amiodarone, one patient; propranolol, one patient; or amiodarone plus propranolol, one patient); sudden AV block was a possible cause and consequently, two later patients had pacemaker implantation as well as medical treatment. His catheter ablation was successfully performed twice but contributed to death in a newborn; three surgical His ablations were performed for intractable JET with two successes and one death. The overall mortality was 35%. Among survivors, treatment has been stopped without any complications in five patients ranging in age from 10 months to 8 years (mean, 3.5 years). It seems that amiodarone alone is the best drug for treatment of congenital JET; necessity for permanent pacing remains unsettled. His ablation should be reserved only for intractable JET.", 
    "10": "The QL of patients on long-term pharmacologic treatment needs to be evaluated, especially in the elderly. This article discusses how this should be done and gives the results of studies on three groups of drugs commonly taken by elderly patients. Diuretic treatment does not appear to grossly impair QL, transdermal nitrates for angina do impair QL if used continuously, and tolerance limits their efficacy. Antihypertensive drugs appear to vary widely in their effects on QL. Drugs such as ACE inhibitors, verapamil, and atenolol appear preferable to the older drugs such as methyldopa and the beta-blocker propranolol, which have a central action.", 
    "11": "Antihypertensive therapy with labetalol was evaluated in a prospective, randomized, multicenter, double-blind study of 133 elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension (standing systolic blood pressure [BP] greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg; diastolic BP less than 95 mm Hg). Following a placebo-washout period, patients received either labetalol (n = 70) or placebo (n = 63), which was titrated as necessary from 100 to 400 mg twice a day over a 6-week period. Once the BP was controlled (standing systolic BP less than 160 mm Hg, and greater than or equal to 10-mm Hg decrease from baseline) or the maximum dosage had been given, patients continued receiving the same regimen until the end of the titration period and throughout a 4-week maintenance period. Blood pressure was controlled in 57 (81%) of 70 of the labetalol-treated patients (86% receiving less than or equal to 200 mg twice a day) compared with 34 (54%) of 63 of the placebo-treated patients. Throughout the active treatment periods, BP was significantly lower in patients treated with labetalol compared with those taking placebo; mean standing systolic BP decreased 26 mm Hg in the labetalol group vs 9 mm Hg in the placebo group. Side effects were generally mild, and the dropout rates due to adverse experiences were similar between treatment groups (14% in the labetalol group vs 10% in the placebo group). In summary, labetalol can effectively lower systolic BP in the elderly without causing adverse orthostatic changes.", 
    "12": "The effects of cumulatively applied doses (10(-8) M, 10(-7) M and 10(-6) M) of dl-carteolol, a nonselective beta-antagonist, on stimulation-evoked [3H] release at 5 Hz for 40 sec, were studied in renal arteries isolated from prehypertensive 4 weeks old spontaneously hypertensive rats unexposed and exposed to swimming stress for 1 hr, and then loaded with [3H]-noradrenaline. Carteolol, at 10(-8) M and 10(-7) M, produced no effect and at 10(-6) M it slightly inhibited the evoked [3H] release in the arteries from control spontaneously hypertensive rats. Carteolol, 10(-8) M to 10(-6) M, consistently inhibited the evoked [3H] release in renal arteries from spontaneously hypertensive rats exposed to stress and this inhibition differed from no effect, at 10(-8) M and 10(-7) M, and was greater than that at 10(-6) M in the arteries from control spontaneously hypertensive rats. Swimming stress increased the endogenous contents of adrenaline and dopamine in renal arteries without altering the level of noradrenaline. In conclusion, adrenaline appears to act as an endogenous agonist for tonically functioning presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors in renal arteries from prehypertensive young spontaneously hypertensive rats. Moreover, during and after a stressful situation, increased adrenaline appears to participate in further augmentation of vascular noradrenergic neurotransmission via further activation of these adrenoceptors to facilitate the release of noradrenaline.", 
    "13": "It was demonstrated in experiments on dogs that enteral absorption of protein occurs in phases. An operative trauma reduces the rate and duration of absorption, disorganizes the phase structure of the process, and reduces the supply of protein to the organism. Obzidan blockade of the beta-adrenergic structures restores the rate, duration, and time organization of absorption and thus increases the entry of protein into the organism.", 
    "14": "The beta-adrenoceptor blockade, slow inward calcium current blockade and calcium concentration decrease in perfusion solution were studied for their effect on cAMP oscillations during cardiac cycle in the isadrin-activated isolated heart of guinea pig. Isadrin activation (3 X 10(-8) M) of beta-adrenoceptors caused an increase of the cAMP concentration by 50% during the contraction. All the actions decreased an average level of cyclonucleotide in the myocardium as compared with isadrin and what is more, obsidan (10(-6) M) removed the cAMP oscillations almost completely, the hypocalcium solution (0.15 mM Ca2+) decreased their amplitude and duration, finoptin (3 X 10(-8) M) qualitatively changed the oscillation profile. The results obtained make it possible to suggest, that a change in the concentration of ionized calcium in myoplasma is one of the reasons inducing changes in the cAMP during the cardiac cycle.", 
    "15": "We have recently shown that functional alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, assessed by the alpha 2-agonist UK 14304, are present in rat white fat cells as in adipocytes of humans and other species. The aim of the present study was to further characterize rat fat cell alpha 2-adrenoceptors and to examine whether their number and biological effect were altered in fat cells from genetically obese Zucker rats. The maximal antilipolytic effect of UK 14304 was higher in obese than in lean littermates. Epinephrine, when its beta-component was blocked by propranolol, also induced an antilipolytic response that was higher in the obese rats. Similarly, 3H-labeled UK 14304 binding on adipocyte membranes was higher in obese than in lean animals. The radiolabeled alpha 2-antagonist [3H]idazoxan also recognized a higher number of sites in obese animals. However, epinephrine only partially competed for the 3H-labeled UK 14304 and [3H]idazoxan, suggesting that these imidazolinic radioligands labeled not only alpha 2-adrenoceptors but also nonadrenergic binding sites. By contrast, 3H-labeled RX 821002, an alpha 2-antagonist derived from the idazoxan family, did not recognize these sites and allowed accurate quantification of adipocyte alpha 2-adrenoceptors. The number of alpha 2-sites was higher in obese than in lean littermates (Bmax = 64 +/- 5 vs 39 +/- 2 fmol/mg protein, P less than 0.01) without change in affinity. The adipocyte alpha 2-adrenergic responsiveness showed a strong dependency on age and fattening between 5 and 10 weeks of age in both genotypes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "The effect of both isomers of niguldipine, a highly selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist and dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, on noradrenaline-stimulated inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation and adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) potentiation was examined. Both isomers inhibited noradrenaline-stimulated IP accumulation. (+)-Niguldipine was 100 fold more potent than (-)-niguldipine. Potentiation of beta-adrenoceptor-stimulated cyclic AMP by noradrenaline was only partially inhibited by both isomers. The dihydropyridine, israpidine, did not inhibit either second messenger response. This study provides further evidence that the alpha 1-adrenoceptors mediating IP accumulation and cyclic AMP potentiation are different.", 
    "17": "1. The inotropic and chronotropic sensitivity to noradrenaline and isoprenaline (Iso) of foetal and neonatal rat heart decreases as the heart becomes sympathetically innervated. In the present study, we have examined adenylate cyclase (AC) activation and beta-adrenoceptor binding to determine whether a developmental decrease in sensitivity was demonstrable in the beta-receptor-AC system of atrial and ventricular membranes from the 15 day foetus and 1 day and 7 day neonates. 2. While the maximum activation of AC by Iso increased with age, the sensitivity expressed in terms of pD2 values decreased from the 15th foetal day to the first day after birth in the atria, and from the first day to the 7th day after birth in the ventricle. 3. In contrast, activation of AC by forskolin was almost identical at all ages both in atria and ventricle. 4. The maximum equilibrium binding of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol decreased with age, the dissociation constant being about the same at all ages in both the atria and ventricle. 5. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a developmental decrease in the sensitivity of AC to Iso in myocardial membrane fractions consistent with the developmental decrease in chronotropic and inotropic sensitivity to beta-adrenoceptor agonists. Although a reduction in beta-adrenoceptor number partly accounts for the decrease in sensitivity, some other factors such as decreased coupling to AC may largely be responsible.", 
    "18": "A randomized double-blind study lasting 2 months was performed with either 25 mg captopril twice a day or 50 mg atenolol once a day in 125 patients with established diastolic hypertension (diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mmHg) identified during a population screening programme of subjects aged less than 65 years. Quality of life was assessed from self-completed questionnaires. A significant fall in diastolic blood pressure occurred with both captopril (106.7 +/- 7.0 to 98.6 +/- 8.6 mmHg) and atenolol (107.4 +/- 7.5 to 98.2 +/- 8.1 mmHg) but there was no difference between the two drugs in the size of the fall. A measure of the number of symptomatic complaints, the symptom complaint rate, decreased with both drugs, by 1.3% for captopril and 3.1% for atenolol, but the difference between the drugs was not significant [1.8%; 95% confidence interval (Cl) - 1.3%, 4.9%]. There was a significant increase in the reporting of cough and runny nose in those on captopril compared with atenolol. A health index increased by 1.1% with captopril in comparison with no change on atenolol (difference 1.1%; 95% Cl - 2.0%, 4.2%). Psychological well-being was measured using the Symptom Rating Test.

    "19": "The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) exhibits increased renal sympathetic nerve activity and neurotransmitter levels compared with the control Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY). These renal nerve abnormalities have been implicated as the cause of hypertension in the SHR. The aims of the present study were to characterize the ontogeny of renal sympathetic innervation in SHR in order to determine any functional implications. Glyoxylic acid histofluorescent and radio-enzymatic norepinephrine assays demonstrated an accelerated development of renal innervation in newborn and 1-, 2-, 3- and 6-week-old SHR compared with WKY. Sympathetic nervous system function was blocked in developing male SHR by treating pups from days 0 to 14 with: (1) guanethidine, (2) combined alpha- and beta-receptor antagonists (prazosin and timolol), or (3) vehicle (5% sucrose). Blood pressure (mean), renal function (plasma creatinine) and histologic renal damage were assessed at 42 weeks of age. Although the blood pressure of the drug-treated rats remained elevated, renal damage was reduced and renal function was improved compared with control (sucrose-treated) SHR. The data demonstrate that the SHR kidney develops a precocious sympathetic innervation and that inhibition of the development of sympathetic function ameliorates renal damage independently of systemic hypertension.", 
    "20": "The ventrolateral medulla, which functions as integrator of cardiorespiratory control, contains cholinergic and adrenergic neurons. Exogenously administered cholinergic and adrenergic agents affect both ventilation and circulation. It is not clear whether these agents act in an independent or coordinate manner. beta-Adrenergic and alpha 2-adrenergic agents stimulate and depress the cardiorespiratory system, respectively. beta-Adrenergic and alpha 2-adrenergic agents stimulate and depress the production of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), respectively. Increased intracellular cAMP may facilitate the release of acetylcholine (ACh). This work seeks to answer the following questions: 1) Are the cardiorespiratory effects of adrenergic agents secondary to possible changes in ACh release? 2) Does cAMP production have an intermediate role? By means of ventriculocisternal perfusion in anesthetized (pentobarbital sodium, 30 mg/kg) spontaneously breathing dogs, isoproterenol (ISO) increased ventilation (VE) 75% (P less than 0.05); heart rate and cardiac output were also increased (P less than 0.05). Esmolol (a beta-antagonist) blocked both the cardiovascular and ventilatory effects of ISO. Atropine (a cholinergic antagonist) blocked the ventilatory effects of ISO, but the circulatory changes persisted. Forskolin (a direct activator of adenylate cyclase) increased VE 51% (P less than 0.05), and its effect was also blocked by atropine. Clonidine decreased VE 42% (P less than 0.05); heart rate and cardiac output were also decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "To assess the efficacy of oral betaxolol in the treatment of stable exertional angina pectoris and to determine the relationship between betaxolol doses/serum concentrations and clinical/hemodynamic responses the authors studied 24 patients prior to and following stepwise administration of 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg doses. The major endpoint for the study was the achievement of clinical beta blockade (heart rate 50-60 beats/min and less than or equal to 20% rise in treadmill stage I heart rate). Betaxolol produced a decrease in mean angina pectoris frequency from 6.6 +/- 1.9 episodes/week with placebo to 0.2 +/- 0.5 episode/week during clinical beta blockade (p less than 0.00005). Mean treadmill exercise time increased from 3.1 +/- 1.7 min with placebo to 7.3 +/- 2.3 min with doses sufficient to reduce angina pectoris frequency greater than or equal to 75% (p less than 0.00005) and to 8.0 +/- 2.3 min during clinical beta blockade (p less than 0.00005). The mean doses of betaxolol required to produce a greater than or equal to 75% decrease in angina pectoris frequency and clinical beta blockade were 12 +/- 5 mg (range 5-40 mg) and 28 +/- 29 mg (range 5-80 mg) respectively. Mean serum concentrations associated with these clinical endpoints were 23.8 +/- 9.7 ng/mL and 59.7 +/- 54.0 ng/mL respectively. The results indicate that betaxolol, in widely ranging doses, is highly effective in reducing angina pectoris frequency and improving exercise capacity in patients with stable exertional angina pectoris.", 
    "22": "1. The effects of acute hypoglycaemia on the spleen were examined in normal humans using radioisotopic techniques, complemented by ultrasonic examination of the spleen. Hypoglycaemia had a modest effect on splenic area, measured by ultrasonography, which declined to 62 +/- 6% (mean +/- SEM) of the basal value after the onset of the acute hypoglycaemic reaction. 2. Hypoglycaemia had a pronounced effect on the splenic radioactivity, which decreased significantly to a mean of 10 +/- 7% of basal radioactivity at 15 min after the onset of hypoglycaemia. The splenic image completely disappeared at some time after hypoglycaemia in all subjects. 3. The reduction of splenic radioactivity was abolished during non-selective alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine, but was unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol, or cholinergic blockade with atropine, which suggests that the response of vessels perfusing the spleen is mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "23": "In spontaneously breathing anaesthetized rats, both moderate and severe hypoxia caused increases in [K+] in venous efflux from hindlimb muscle, from 4.3 to 4.6 and from 3.8 to 4.4 mM respectively; the increases were accentuated to 5.2 and 5.7 mM after beta 2-receptor blockade with I.V. sotalol. Sotalol also potentiated the vasodilatation evoked in hindlimb muscle by moderate hypoxia, but reduced that evoked by severe hypoxia. We propose that K+ released from muscle during hypoxia contributed to the local vasodilatation. Further, we suggest that this effect was enhanced in moderate hypoxia by blockade of the beta 2-mediated uptake mechanism for K+ in skeletal muscle, but outweighed in severe hypoxia by blockade of the beta 2-mediated dilator action of circulating catecholamines on vascular muscle.", 
    "24": "Meperidine increases developed force in isolated rat atria. We initiated this study to determine if this positive inotropic effect was attenuated by commonly used receptor- and ion channel blockers. Neither naloxone (opioid blocker), phentolamine (alpha-adrenoceptor blocker), propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor blocker), polaramine (H1-receptor blocker), ranitidine (H2-receptor blocker), verapamil (calcium-channel blocker), nor lidocaine (fast sodium-channel blocker) attenuated the positive inotropic effect of meperidine. However, after lidocaine pretreatment meperidine increased contractile force by 57% (27%-80%) (median and 95% confidence interval), which is significantly more (P less than 0.001) than the 21% (13%-35%) increase seen after pretreatment with saline. After Na,K-pump inhibition by ouabain, meperidine caused no further increase in contractility, but the atria still responded to isoproterenol with an increase in developed force. Conversely, meperidine prevented the positive inotropic effect of ouabain. These findings suggest that the positive inotropic effect of meperidine is mediated by an increase in intracellular sodium activity and not by regulation of the slow inward calcium channel.", 
    "25": "Severe autonomic failure is usually characterized by both supine hypertension and orthostatic hypotension. Inadequate preload reserve, insufficient arterial resistance and abnormal cardiac performance have been postulated to contribute to the hypotension. To clarify these mechanisms, left ventricular performance and contractility were assessed using radionuclide ventriculography and systolic pressure-volume relations when supine and with graded head-up tilt in 11 patients with autonomic failure. Results were compared with those of 12 normal subjects, using phenylephrine infusion for pharmacologic afterload augmentation after autonomic blockade with atropine and propranolol. In a subset of four patients with autonomic failure, systolic pressure-volume relations were similar by both the tilt and phenylephrine methods. In autonomic failure, end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume and stroke volume decreased with progressive degrees of tilt (p less than or equal to 0.007 for each). The supine radionuclide ejection fraction and cardiac output were similar to those of normal subjects (69% versus 68% and 5.4 versus 4.9 liters/min, respectively, p = NS). However, the slopes of the pressure-volume relations and the supine pressure/volume ratio in autonomic failure were much greater than normal (8.8 versus 2.5, and 6.3 versus 3.6 mm Hg/ml, respectively, p less than or equal to 0.04 for both). The baseline total peripheral resistance was greater than normal (24.9 versus 17.4 mm Hg.min-1/liter, p = 0.01), but the resistance at maximal tilt failed to increase (20.8 +/- 6.1 units). Plasma norepinephrine concentrations were lower than normal. Thus, patients with autonomic failure had hypercontractile left ventricular performance when assessed by pressure-volume relations, and their hearts were well matched to the elevated peripheral resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "Experimentally induced hyperthyroidism is associated with cardiac hypertrophy, tachycardia and elevated myocardial contractility. To investigate the possibility of ameliorating the cardiac changes pharmacologically, hyperthyroid rats were treated with propranolol, verapamil or dantrolene. Cardiac hypertrophy was assessed from the heart mass: body mass ratio and cardiac function was measured in vitro. Both verapamil and propranolol reversed the cardiac hypertrophy of the hyperthyroid animals from 0.92 +/- 0.02 mg.g-1 to 0.70 +/- 0.01 mg.g-1 (P less than 0.001) and 0.72 +/- 0.02 mg.g-1 (P less than 0.001) respectively. Verapamil was effective in reducing the spontaneous heart rate from 331 +/- 8 beats.min-1 to 273 +/- 7 beats.min-1 (P less than 0.001) while propranolol reduced the dP/dtmax of the hyperthyroid hearts from 4089 +/- 87 mmHg.s-1 to 3497 +/- 97 mmHg.s-1 (P less than 0.001). Dantrolene had no effect on any parameter. We conclude from our results that cardiac hypertrophy of the hyperthyroid heart can be reversed by treatment with propranolol and verapamil probably via their inotropic and chronotropic properties.", 
    "27": "Subacute, severe intoxication with ethanol stimulates the peripheral sympathetic nervous system in the rat and enhances the excretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline. In association with this effect there is a rapid development of cardiac hypertrophy, with proportional heart weight increasing by 12% within 48 h. At this time adrenal medullary adrenaline content was depressed by more than 35%, whereas nonadrenaline content of the adrenal and heart were not affected. Metoprolol (20 mg/kg, t.i.d.) was without effect when used alone and had little if any impact on the ethanol-induced changes. Metoprolol (100 mg/kg, t.i.d.) reduced adrenal catecholamine content, but not cardiac noradrenaline content, and diminished cardiac weight in control animals. The combination of ethanol with the high dose of methoprolol enhanced the loss of medullary catecholamine and reduced cardiac noradrenaline content, whereas cardiac weight was the same as in control animals. A correlation between sympathetic activation and increasing cardiac mass and its antagonism by metoprolol implies a beta-adrenoceptor mediated link in the cardiac hypertrophy induced by ethanol.", 
    "28": "To characterize the effect of beta-endorphin on T-lymphocyte activation, we examined its influence on membrane currents, intracellular calcium flux, and c-myc mRNA levels during mitogenic stimulation of Jurkat cells. While beta-endorphin weakly enhanced voltage-activated K+ currents of Jurkat cells by itself, it suppressed these currents in the presence of mitogen. Naloxone, by itself, also enhanced K+ current amplitude, but in the presence of mitogen partially reversed the suppressive effect of beta-endorphin. A 5-30 min exposure to beta-endorphin resulted in an increase in the rate of mitogen-stimulated intracellular calcium release and an increase in c-myc mRNA levels relative to controls. Longer exposure (1-2 h) to beta-endorphin retarded intracellular calcium release, and suppressed c-myc expression. The suppressive effects were reversed by naloxone and mimicked by the K+ channel blocker, tetraethylammonium ion. These data suggest that opiate receptors and K+ channels of Jurkat cells are functionally coupled in a way that modulates intracellular calcium release and c-myc expression - two key processes in T-cell mitogenesis.", 
    "29": "The aim of the study was to determine whether moderate reduction in regional myocardial blood flow is related to epicardial ST segment depression and to the changes in grade and extent induced in this variable by antianginal drugs.", 
    "30": "Blood flow through the anterior descending coronary artery was reduced to 25-30% of control in open chest dogs, using a cuff flow meter as a monitor, and glyceryl trinitrate, propranolol and nifedipine were infused 60 min later. Regional left ventricular blood flow was measured with 15 mu radioactive microspheres and electrocardiograms were recorded from the epicardial surface of the anterior left ventricular wall before and after administration of the drugs.", 
    "31": "20 adult male greyhounds were used, weighing 19-24 kg.", 
    "32": "Under control conditions there was a poor correlation between ST segment depression and regional flow. Neither glyceryl trinitrate nor nifedipine had any significant effect on ST segment depression in sites overlying zones with a flow range of 80-105% of normal flow. On the other hand, glyceryl trinitrate, but not nifedipine, decreased ST segment depression in sites overlying the central ischaemic zone (35-80% of control posterior wall flow). With propranolol, mean ST depression was decreased significantly in sites overlying the central ischaemic zone (35-80% of control flow), but not in sites overlying zones with flows ranging from 80-105% of normal. Propranolol reduced blood flow to all zones.", 
    "33": "Epicardial ST segment depression is unreliable for the quantitative exploration of the grade and extent of myocardial ischaemia.", 
    "34": "The antithyroid drugs methimazole and propylthiouracil have been shown to affect the function of monocytes and B and T lymphocytes in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism responsible for signalling between these various cell types. Propranolol, a drug known to have no effect on the immune system, was also included as a control against which the effects of the other drugs could be monitored. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from control subjects were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin in the presence or absence of antithyroid drugs. Propranolol was found significantly to inhibit beta 2 microglobulin production. In addition it was also found to be a very weak scavenger of free oxygen radicals. Methimazole significantly increased interleukin 2 levels (p less than 0.01), but had no significant effect on either gamma-interferon or beta 2 microglobulin production. Propylthiouracil also increased interleukin 2 levels (p less than 0.001) and significantly decreased beta 2 microglobulin production (p less than 0.01). Both drugs were found to be scavengers of free O2 radicals. It would appear that IL-2 is involved in intercellular signalling and this process may involve free radicals.", 
    "35": "The hemodynamic and intrapulmonary shunt effects of intravenous labetalol and nitroprusside were compared during induced hypotension for major spinal surgery. A randomized, double-blind protocol was used in which 20 patients, ASA physical status I or II, received either nitroprusside infusion (n = 10) or labetalol bolus injections of 10 mg every 10 min (n = 10) until mean arterial blood pressure was reduced to 55-60 mm Hg. Pulmonary artery pressures were measured and mixed venous samples obtained via a pulmonary artery catheter. Nitroprusside increased heart rate significantly more than labetalol during the period of hypotension. When compared with prehypotension baseline values, nitroprusside increased heart rate significantly with a concomitant significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Cardiac output increased significantly 60 min after hypotension was achieved in patients treated with nitroprusside. Systemic vascular resistance decreased significantly below baseline levels in patients treated with labetalol but without changes in cardiac output, heart rate, or mean pulmonary artery pressure. There was a 122% increase in intrapulmonary shunt with nitroprusside administration, compared with an 11% increase with labetalol. Labetalol was effective for inducing hypotension and was not associated with an increase in heart rate, intrapulmonary shunt, or cardiac output as seen with nitroprusside.", 
    "36": "The case of a 59-year-old man with paralytic ileus (pseudo-obstruction) associated with pheochromocytoma is reviewed. Paralytic ileus is believed to have been the result of overstimulation of alpha and beta receptors on the intestine by catecholamines. Phentolamine, bunazocin, propranolol, bethanechol and midaglizole in single administrations or in combination were administered. Phentolamine infusion clearly relieved the symptom, but ileus recurred, and the patient died of respiratory failure, liver dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome. The significant role of catecholamines in causing these symptoms is discussed, and the management of this relatively rare complication is reviewed.", 
    "37": "Cocaine, like catecholamines or angiotensin II, may induce lethal cardiac or cerebral damage. Restrained rats were fitted with a caudal arterial catheter for on-line cardiovascular monitoring and antidote administration. They were given 60 mg/kg of cocaine i.p., a dose which produces behavioral and cardiovascular effects, convulsions and death in an average time of 10 min. Selected antidotes were administered 5 min after the lethal dose of cocaine. Incidence of lethality was not changed by propranolol, prazosin, labetalol, diazepam or enalaprilat, a converting enzyme inhibitor. Animals treated with any one of the following agents, alpha- or beta-blockers, diazepam or competitive inhibitors of angiotensin II [Sar-1-ile-8] and [Sar-1-thr-8] angiotensin II, presented myocardial infarction. All animals treated with calcium channel antagonists or enalaprilat, whether they survived or not, did not present myocardial infarction. Treatment with nitrendipine, flunarizine or diltiazem, resulted in survival of the animals with no observable aftereffects. Similar results were observed when enalaprilat was administered, with diazepam as an antidote, to a lethal dose of cocaine. Antagonists to the sympatho-adrenal system and to the renin angiotensin system appear to be effective antidotes to cocaine toxicity in the present experimental model.", 
    "38": "The effects of various antihypertensive treatments on the echocardiographic and electrocardiographic findings of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy were studied in 75 patients with essential hypertension. The hemodynamic effects of the therapy during exercise were also compared. LV mass by echocardiogram was significantly reduced by beta-blockade and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI), but only slightly reduced by Ca channel blockade. QRS high voltage criteria of LV hypertrophy by electrocardiogram were reduced by all 3 of these antihypertensive treatments. At submaximal exercise, the pressor responses were attenuated by captopril, but not influenced by metoprolol or nifedipine. The increase in plasma norepinephrine by exercise was significantly suppressed after captopril, but was somewhat augmented after metoprolol or nifedipine. These observations indicate that the responses of hemodynamics and sympathetic nervous activity to exercise are different after the treatment by beta-blocker, Ca channel blocker or ACEI, in spite of the equal antihypertensive effect. However, it is suggested that the regression of LV hypertrophy might be induced by antihypertensive therapy, though the different grade by the individual drug.", 
    "39": "A direct high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed for the assays of the enantiomers of O-acetyl propranolol. Using this procedure, the stereochemical characteristics on hydrolysis of racemic O-acetyl propranolol as a prodrug have been studied in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and in 90% human serum. In the phosphate buffer, no difference in the hydrolysis rate between the esters of (R)- and (S)-propranolol was observed. In 90% human serum, the hydrolysis of the esters was accelerated, and the hydrolysis rate of the ester of (R)-isomer was about three times faster than that of the ester of (S)-isomer. The interconversion between (R)- and (S)-isomer was not observed during the hydrolysis of prodrug in buffer and in human serum. These results indicated that hydrolysis of O-acetyl propranolol occurs stereoselectively in human serum.", 
    "40": "Six obese subjects (mean +/- s.d. : 145.1 +/- 16.7% of ideal body weight) were randomly assigned to a single i.v. dose either of (+/-)-propranolol base (0.108 mg kg-1 of ideal body weight) or of (+/-)-sotalol base (1.06 mg kg-1 of ideal body weight). Each subject received the other drug 7 days later. Pharmacokinetic parameters were compared with those obtained previously in non-obese control subjects. In obese subjects, the pharmacokinetic data calculated for sotalol were comparable with those measured in controls (total body clearance = 9.4 +/- 2.9 L h-1; volume of distribution during the terminal phase = 79.8 +/- 19.8 L or 0.9 +/- 0.2 L kg-1; terminal half-life = 6.2 +/- 1.6 h). For propranolol, total clearance (44.3 +/- 15.9 L h-1) and volume of distribution (230.5 +/- 48.2 L or 2.7 +/- 0.7 L kg-1) were significantly less than control values. The terminal half-life (3.9 +/- 1.1 h), was not significantly increased. These results could be explained by altered tissue blood flow and a decreased metabolic capacity of the liver in obese subjects.", 
    "41": "The effects of (+/-)-, (+)- and (-)-celiprolol and of bromoacetylalprenololmentane (BAAM, an irreversible beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) on the contractile responses of the electrically driven rat right ventricle strip to isoprenaline and on the relaxant responses of the rat aorta to procaterol, have been studied. Racemic and (-)-celiprolol or BAAM treatment of the ventricle produced non-parallel rightward shifts of the isoprenaline response curves with a reduction in the maximal response. Sotalol produced parallel rightward displacements of the procaterol response curves of the aorta with no effect on the maximal relaxations. Racemic and (+)- and (-)-celiprolol or BAAM treatment of the aorta produced non-parallel rightwards shifts of the procaterol relaxant curves with a reduction in the maximal relaxation. The BAAM data was used to demonstrate that the KA (dissociation constant) for isoprenaline at beta 1-adrenoceptors was 1.46 x 10(-7) M and for procaterol at beta 2-adrenoceptors was 2.34 x 10(-5) M. Calculation of receptor occupancy demonstrated that to produce a maximal response of the rat right ventricle, had to occupy 87% of the beta 1-adrenoceptors. Likewise, for a maximal response of the rat aorta, procaterol had to occupy 81% of the beta 2-adrenoceptors. It is suggested that the use of tissues with small beta-adrenoceptor reserves has shown that (+/-)- and (-)-celiprolol are slowly dissociating, rather than readily reversible, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "42": "Experiments were conducted on 75 rabbits to study the efficacy of endolymphatic administration of aceclidine, obsidan, and cerucal for stimulation of the intestine in its experimental paresis. The stimulating effect of the pharmacological agents was found to be of a longer duration in endolymphatic that in intravenous administration. This allowed endolymphatic pharmacological stimulation of the intestine to be suggested for the use in abdominal surgery.", 
    "43": "Propranolol antihemolytic test parameters calculated with the Hill mathematical model from dose-dependent curves of saturation were studied in 27 patients with myocardial infarction. Erythrocyte beta-adrenoreceptors showed higher sensitivity to propranolol in patients with myocardial infarction within 3 days of the disease. Three weeks after therapy, changes were found in the erythrocyte membranes solely in patients receiving beta-adrenoblockers. The changes are indicative of lower sensitivity of beta-adrenoreceptors to the beta-blocker. Persons with varying responses to propranolol were detected among the patients with myocardial infarction, which may be used to define indications for beta-adrenoblocker therapy.", 
    "44": "The effects of D,L-propranolol and its resolved epimers on cardiac size in rats given ethanol, or a control diet containing maltose-dextrin, every 8 h by gavage, for 48 h were assessed. Co-treatment with ethanol plus saline for 48 h resulted in increases of approximately 10% in wet and dry heart weights, and in their proportional measures (g/kg body wt). Cardiac protein content was increased similarly. Administration of D,L-propranolol (10, 20 mg/kg), or L-propranolol (5, 10, 20 mg/kg), suppressed the increases in response to ethanol, D-Propranolol (10, 20 mg/kg) was ineffective in attenuating ethanol-induced increases in heart weights and protein content. Values of total cardiac DNA and fractional water content were unaffected by any of the treatments. Adrenaline and noradrenaline levels in urine were elevated during 48 h of intoxication in all rats given ethanol. The results suggest that severe, subacute intoxication with ethanol induces cardiac hypertrophy. Further, the data implies that the hypertrophy is mediated through activation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "45": "Sertoli cells cultured from immature hamsters contain a beta-adrenergic receptor which is coupled to the cAMP second messenger system. Thus, isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, which act via beta-adrenergic receptors, all stimulate cAMP accumulation in Sertoli cells cultured for 4-5 days. This cAMP response to isoproterenol is inhibited stereospecifically by the beta-receptor blocker, propranolol. It is also sensitive to inhibition by beta-adrenergic antagonists in this order of potency: nonspecific beta receptor antagonists, propranolol, timolol, hydroxypindolol greater than beta 1 selective antagonists, oxyprenolol, metoprolol much much greater than beta 2 selective antagonist, butoxamine. Butoxamine was at least 1000-fold less sensitive than either the nonspecific or the beta 1 selective antagonists at inhibiting the response of either isoproterenol (nonspecific), dobutamine (beta 1 selective) or zinterol (beta 2 selective). The hamster Sertoli cell beta receptor is, therefore, predominantly of the B1 subtype. This beta receptor mediated increase in cAMP is sensitive to homologous desensitization and is stimulated synergistically by forskolin. In addition, Seroli cells freshly isolated from immature hamsters contain an active beta receptor. However, this beta receptor mediated increase in cAMP is dependent on the type of trypsin used in the cell preparation. In agreement with Kierszenbaum et al (1985), freshly isolated Sertoli cells from immature rats never responded to the catecholamines regardless of the type of trypsin used; indicating an important physiologic difference between rat and hamster Sertoli cells.", 
    "46": "The aim of this study was to determine whether beta adrenergic receptor blocking drugs exaprolol, metipranolol and propranolol effect the metabolism of phospholipids in isolated rat mast cells. The phospholipids were labelled by 3H-arachidonic acid (3H-AA) and 32P. Exaprolol, metipranolol and propranolol significantly modulated 32P incorporation into phospholipids of resting and 48/80 stimulated cells. Atenolol had no effect. Studies with 3H-AA Labelled mast cells showed an enhanced liberation of arachidonate related radioactivity on exaprolol and propranolol treatment. The results indicated that 3H-activity was lost mainly from phosphatidylethanolamine. Atenolol and metipranolol significantly decreased the 48/80 stimulated 3H-AA release.", 
    "47": "Histamine may play a role in many of the events occurring in the ovarian tissue and leading to ovulation. To elucidate the histaminergic influence on the ovarian vasculature, the mechanical response of the isolated rat ovarian artery to histamine and histamine agonists was investigated. Histamine relaxed the precontracted vessel segments in a concentration-dependent way, amounting to 82.7 +/- 4.3% of the papaverine-induced relaxation. This relaxant effect was counteracted by both the H1 antagonist, pyrilamine, and the H2 antagonist, cimetidine. That the effect of histamine was mediated by both histamine receptor subtypes was further confirmed by the relaxant effect produced in the presence of either of the H1-specific agonists, 2-pyridylethylamine and 2-methylhistamine on the one hand, and the H2-specific agonists, impromidine and 4-methylhistamine on the other. The H1 receptor-induced relaxation was mediated via an effect on the endothelium, whereas the H2 receptor-mediated relaxation was mostly a direct effect on the smooth musculature in the vessel wall. No major differences in the mechanical response of the rat ovarian artery were seen during the different stages of the estrous cycle, although at late proestrus, just before ovulation, the maximum relaxation induced by histamine was particularly high, in spite of a low sensitivity of the receptors for the amine.", 
    "48": "Cardioactive drugs--beta-adrenoblocking agents (propranolol, trasicor and cordanum) and Ca2(+)-antagonists (nifedipine and phenoptine)--exhibited both activating and inhibitory effects on proteolytic activity in rat heart tissue extract. The beta-adrenoblocking agents did not affect distinctly the activity of partially purified cathepsin D and Ca2(+)-dependent neutral protease from myocardium. Nifedipine inhibited cathepsin D by 50% and Ca2(+-dependent neutral protease--by 75%; phenoptine inhibited also the latter enzyme by 30%.", 
    "49": "Substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide are known to activate intrathoracic sympathetic neurons which regulate the heart. In the present series of experiments, when 1 I.U. of oxytocin in 0.1 cc of normal saline was administered into the cranial poles of stellate or the middle of middle cervical ganglia cardiac rate and force were augmented. The locations of ganglionic loci which, when injected, resulted in cardiac changes varied between animals. Twenty active sites were identified in the 12 dogs investigated. When the vehicle (0.1 cc of normal saline) was injected into these active sites minimal cardiac responses were induced in one instance. When 1 or 2 I.U. of oxytocin was administered into the superior vena cave of seven animals slight systemic hypotension occurred in two of these animals. Cardiac responses were induced when oxytocin was reinjected into active intrathoracic ganglionic sites after whole body administration of hexamethonium (10 mg/kg IV), but not after local administration of timolol into the ganglia. Thus, it appears that oxytocin can activate intrathoracic ganglionic neurons involved in efferent sympathetic cardiac regulation. That such responses persist in the presence of nicotinic blockade, but not following beta-adrenergic blockade of ganglionic neurons, indicates that oxytocin modifies beta-adrenergic and not nicotinic receptors on neurons in these ganglia.", 
    "50": "The effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers (phenoxybenzamine, PBZ and propranolol, PPL, respectively) on the cerebral (CBF) and cerebellar (CeBF) blood flow autoregulations were examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats. CBF and CeBF were measured during stepwise hemorrhagic hypotension using hydrogen clearance method. The lower limits of autoregulation for CBF beyond which blood flow was decreased steeply were 72% of the resting blood pressure level in the control, 56% in the PBZ treated group, and 80% in the PPL group. Similar tendency was observed in CeBF. These results indicate that PBZ leads to a downward shift while PPL to a slight upward shift of the lower limits of CBF and CeBF autoregulations, suggesting that alpha-adrenergic blockade has a favorable effect for the maintenance of cerebral blood flow during acute reduction of blood pressure.", 
    "51": "Recently there have been important advances in our understanding of muscarinic receptors in airways that have important implications for understanding airway control and for future therapy of airway diseases. The transduction mechanisms involved in muscarinic receptor activation are now better understood. Receptor-linked phosphoinositide hydrolysis leads to release of calcium ions from intracellular stores, resulting in contraction of airway smooth muscle. At least five subtypes of muscarinic receptor have now been cloned, although only three subtypes can be distinguished pharmacologically. M1 receptors are facilitatory to neurotransmission in airway parasympathetic ganglion cells and have also been identified in airway submucosal glands and on the alveolar walls of human lung. M2 receptors are located on postganglionic nerves and function as powerful feedback inhibitory receptors (autoreceptors) that are likely to be involved in modulation of reflex bronchoconstriction. These receptors may be dysfunctional in asthmatic airways. M3 receptors are present on airway smooth muscle and submucosal glands and mediate the classical muscarinic effects in airways. Molecular biology techniques should now allow further study of the factors that regulate transcription and expression of muscarinic receptors in airways.", 
    "52": "We describe a case of massive propranolol overdose in a healthy 19-year-old woman associated with isolated mesenteric ischemia following shock. We postulate that endogenous catecholamine release from shock combined with massive beta-adrenergic blockade led to severe splanchnic vasoconstriction from unopposed alpha-adrenergic activity. This case supports current thinking regarding the effect of vasoactive mediators on the gastrointestinal tract in humans and might be relevant to the mechanism of action of propranolol in the prophylaxis of variceal bleeding.", 
    "53": "This report describes the use of a transcutaneous nerve stimulator for the treatment of severe angina pectoris in a young man refractory to maximal medical management after coronary angioplasty and coronary bypass surgery. Its successful use resulted in a marked clinical improvement and an impressive reduction in hospitalizations and other utilization of health care resources. Consideration for use of a transcutaneous nerve stimulator should be given in similar patients when all other accepted medical and surgical treatment modalities fail to provide adequate pain control.", 
    "54": "Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting are at risk for perioperative myocardial ischemia. Most such ischemic episodes occur without obvious hemodynamic changes. Tachycardia as a predictor for increased myocardial oxygen consumption doubles the incidence of myocardial ischemia when heart rate increases to over 110 beats/min. During the operative procedure for coronary revascularization, some maneuvers, e.g. intubation, sternotomy and mediastinal preparation, may be associated with tachycardia and increases in blood pressure despite an adequate level of anesthesia, so that the administration of beta-receptor blocking agents seems to be indicated.", 
    "55": "The study included 20 patients undergoing elective aortocoronary bypass grafting. All patients developed tachycardia (heart rate greater than 100 beats/min) before the start of extracorporeal circulation. The hemodynamic effects of 0.1 mg/kg acebutolol given i.v. as a bolus over 30 s and hemodynamic effects of the ultrashort-acting esmolol by continuous infusion (loading dose 500 micrograms/kg over 1 min followed by a dose of 100 micrograms/kg per min) were randomly investigated. Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl, midazolam and pancuronium bromide. All patients were invasively monitored by means of a pulmonary artery catheter. In addition, left ventricular pressure (LVP), left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and dp/dtmax were measured.", 
    "56": "Both acebutolol and esmolol, decreased the heart rate significantly (-24%, -27.5%), while the mean arterial pressure remained nearly unchanged. The cardiac index was diminished following acebutolol (-15.4%) and esmolol (-27.4%), while no significant change in stroke volume index was observed; systemic vascular resistance rose in all patients. Pulmonary artery pressure, PCP, PRA, LVP and LVEDP were unchanged, whereas dp/dtmax decreased both with acebutolol (-23.5%) and with esmolol (-36.5%).", 
    "57": "Both beta-receptor blockers--acebutolol and the ultrashort-acting esmolol--diminish heart rate sufficiently when tachycardia occurs during coronary artery bypass grafting. Reduction of heart rate is associated with a decrease of cardiac output and an impairment of myocardial contractility. From the hemodynamic point of view there is no major difference between the two beta-receptor blockers investigated, but esmolol may have an advantage over acebutolol because of its short elimination half-life.", 
    "58": "Intrapritoneal injection of N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) to rats significantly reduced the density of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the cerebral cortex, without affecting beta-adrenoceptors. A single dose of EEDQ markedly accelerated the development of downregulation of beta-adrenoceptors induced by a short series of electroshocks. The accumulation of cAMP, induced by isoproterenol, was unchanged in rats treated with EEDQ, while the effect of noradrenaline was reduced, to the level observed after isoproterenol alone, indicating the attenuation of alpha-adrenoceptor function. The isoproterenol-induced accumulation of cAMP was not changed by EEDQ nor electroshock, not by the combined treatment. The stimulatory action of noradrenaline was reduced after EEDQ alone or in combination with electroshock, but the effect of electroshock alone was insignificant. The results suggest that the acceleration of downregulation of beta-adrenoceptors after combined treatment with an alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent is related to elimination of the alpha-adrenergic potentiation of accumulation of cAMP mediated by beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "59": "In a randomized study, the haemodynamic effects of the new phosphodiesterase-III-inhibitor, enoximone, were compared with dobutamine in acutely beta-adrenoceptor blocked patients. Twenty patients scheduled for aorto-coronary bypass grafting suffering from tachycardia (heart rate (HR) greater than 100 beat min-1) were treated by infusion of esmolol, an ultra-short acting, selective beta 1-blocker. Twenty minutes after the start of esmolol, either enoximone 0.5 mg kg-1 as a bolus (n = 10) or dobutamine 5 micrograms kg-1 min-1 was administered. Haemodynamic effects were monitored for 40 min, including measurement of left ventricular haemodynamics. Esmolol reduced HR (-27%) and dP/dtmax (-38%) significantly in both groups. Cardiac index (CI) was decreased also. Enoximone increased Cl (+35%) and dP/dtmax (+39%) significantly, while no change in dobutamine-treated patients was observed. Systemic vascular resistance increased only in the dobutamine group (+44%).", 
    "60": "The effects of adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists have been determined on \"sleeping time\" in the rat--that is, with the animal immobile and adopting a sleeping posture. Alterations in their gross behaviour patterns were assessed also. The specific alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists (yohimbine, WY 26393, RX 781094 and RS 21361) decreased sleeping time, as did the beta-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol. The specific alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine gave a large increase in sleeping time at doses in excess of 25 micrograms kg-1. The same effect was seen with the beta-antagonist propranolol and the specific beta 2-antagonist ICI 118551.", 
    "61": "In rat hypothalamic slices, L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) was assayed, and the actions of L-DOPA on impulse (2 Hz)-evoked norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) release were studied under inhibition of AADC. Slices were incubated with L-DOPA, and DA and NE produced by conversion of the precursor were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). In the slices, the Km and Vmax of AADC were 131 microM and 122 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. NSD-1015, an AADC inhibitor, caused a noncompetitive type of inhibition, and the K1 value was 0.086 microM. In the presence of 20 microM NSD-1015, which was expected to cause 99.6% inhibition of AADC, L-DOPA (0.01-100 nM) concentration-dependently facilitated the release of NE from the superfused slices, and the L-DOPA (10 nM)-induced facilitation was antagonized by 100 nM ICI 89,406 and 100 nM ICI 118,551, a selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, respectively. This action of L-DOPA was not modified by 30 microM tropolone, an inhibitor of catechol-O-methyl-transferase. L-DOPA at 0.01-1 nM similarly facilitated the release of DA. A quantitative analysis revealed that the L-DOPA-induced increase in NE and DA release was much higher by a factor of 3 to 4 orders than was the amount of DA and NE converted from L-DOPA. These results add further support to the hypothesis that L-DOPA itself acts as a neuroactive substance in the rat central nervous system.", 
    "62": "The definition, pathogenesis, incidence and characteristics, detection, treatment, and prognosis of silent myocardial ischemia (SMI) are reviewed. SMI is the occurrence of myocardial ischemia for which there is objective evidence (electrophysiological, hemodynamic, and metabolic changes) but no angina. Patients with SMI are classified as type 1 (completely asymptomatic), type 2 (SMI after myocardial infarction), and type 3 (both symptomatic and silent ischemia). Episodes of SMI are true ischemic events. The absence of pain may be due to defects in pain perception, an altered physiological response to ischemia, or a lesser degree of ischemia. The incidence of SMI is 2-5% in totally asymptomatic patients, 20-30% in patients who have suffered myocardial infarction, and 44-84% in patients who have symptomatic ischemia. SMI can be detected by exercise testing, portable electrocardiographic monitoring, or imaging techniques. Patients with SMI have more frequent adverse cardiac events (except death) than patients without SMI. The frequency of adverse cardiac events is similar in patients with angina and patients with SMI. SMI has been treated with nitrates, calcium-channel blockers, and beta blockers. Beta blockers appear to be the most consistent in reducing the number and duration of episodes. Combination therapy with beta blockers and nifedipine may be more effective than therapy with either agent alone. Because of the limited number of studies and the possible contribution to the results of spontaneous variability in the occurrence of SMI, no definite conclusions can be drawn about drug efficacy. There is no evidence that the prognosis of patients with SMI is altered by drug therapy; routine treatment with anti-ischemic drugs cannot be recommended. Patients must be evaluated individually, with aggressive management being reserved for those at high risk for myocardial infarction or other serious cardiac events.", 
    "63": "Patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and hypertension were studied before and after three months of combined beta-blocker-diuretic treatment. Blood pressure fell significantly (P less than .001) from (mean +/- SEM) 167 +/- 3/99 +/- 1 to 142 +/- 3/88 +/- 1 mm Hg. However, mean (+/- SEM) fasting plasma glucose concentration increased significantly (P less than .001) from 132 +/- 11 to 153 +/- 10 mg/dL. In addition, significant increases (P less than .05) were noted in fasting concentration of plasma total triglyceride, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglyceride and VLDL-cholesterol, whereas fasting plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol was significantly lower (P less than .05). Thus, a common treatment program for hypertension exacerbated the abnormalities of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism commonly present in patients with NIDDM. Since the changes noted would increase risk of vascular disease, attention should be focused on selection of treatment programs for lowering blood pressure in patients with NIDDM in order to avoid this outcome.", 
    "64": "Cardiovascular and sympathoadrenal effects of short-term oral treatment with beta 1-blockade (atenolol, 50 mg, administered two times) and beta 2-blockade (ICI 118,551, 50 mg, administered three times) were compared with placebo during actual flying in subjects with flight phobia (n = 34). beta 1-Blockade lowered resting blood pressure and heart rate and prevented a heart rate response but not a blood pressure response to this psychologic stress. beta 2-Blockade minimally lowered resting heart rate and prevented a heart rate response, but it failed to lower resting blood pressure or blood pressure response to the stress. Plasma epinephrine increased with all three treatments and more with beta 1-blockade than with placebo. Plasma norepinephrine decreased with administration of beta 2-blockade. Thus neither beta 1- nor beta 2-blockade prevents an increase in blood pressure during acute flight phobia stress. Increased plasma epinephrine seems to be the sympathetic variable that is closest related to this increase in blood pressure. Norepinephrine may be less consistently related to the blood pressure rise during flight phobia stress as shown by the decrease in plasma norepinephrine with administration of beta 2-blockade.", 
    "65": "The beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoreceptor blockade by means of the systemic diffusion of three beta-blocker eyedrops--timolol, carteolol, and betaxolol--was evaluated in a randomized, single-blind, three-way crossover study in 18 volunteers. The blockade was evaluated by analyzing the variations of the beta 1- and beta 2-blockade effects of isoproterenol before and after instillation of one drop in each eye. The beta 1-blockade effect was judged on the variation of heart rate, and the beta 2-blockade effect was judged on the change in peripheral blood flow measured by veno-occlusive plethysmography. Comparison of the blockade by these drops showed that carteolol and timolol totally inhibited the beta 1 and beta 2 effects of a dose of isoproterenol able to increase heart rate by 50% (placebo eyedrops were used as a control). Betaxolol differ significantly because it allowed the same effects with the same dose of isoproterenol. Intensity of the blockade was measured by comparison of the effective doses of isoproterenol. Carteolol and timolol were shown to be four times more inhibitory.", 
    "66": "In acute myocardial infarction, beta-adrenergic blockade might depress left ventricular contractility or improve contractility by reducing ischemia. Gated equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography and cuff blood pressure were employed in 10 patients to assess the left ventricular systolic pressure/volume (P/V) ratio as an index of contractility before and after intravenous metoprolol 9.3 +/- 2.5 hr after onset of infarction. In 13 normal subjects, the baseline left ventricular PV ratio was 3.5 and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 70%, both greater than the patients with infarction. In the patients after blockade, the systolic blood pressure decreased (p = 0.02), and the left ventricular end-systolic volume increased (p = 0.003), thus decreasing the P/V ratio from 1.7 to 1.4 (p = 0.003), while the ejection fraction (EF) was unchanged (55% versus 52%). The right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) decreased from 50% to 43% (p = 0.004). Thus, radionuclide ventriculography demonstrated that left ventricular contractility was reduced in patients with acute myocardial infarction and that beta-adrenergic blockade further decreased left ventricular contractility and right ventricular performance.", 
    "67": "Exposure of rat heart muscle cells to noradrenaline (1 microM) for 48 hr led to a decrease in the number of beta 1-adrenoceptors of 50% and a concomitant decrease in adenylyl cyclase stimulation by isoprenaline and forskolin of about 60 and 30%, respectively. In addition, the levels of two inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gi protein) alpha-subunits (Gi alpha 40 and Gi alpha 41) were increased in membranes of noradrenaline-treated cells. Evidence is presented that noradrenaline induces this increase by activation of beta-adrenoceptors. First, the noradrenaline action was mimicked by the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline. Second, beta-adrenoceptor blockade by timolol but not alpha-adrenoceptor blockade by prazosin prevented the noradrenaline-induced up-regulation of Gi alpha proteins. Furthermore, timolol but not prazosin abolished the noradrenaline-induced down-regulation of beta 1-adrenoceptors and the decreases in receptor-dependent (isoprenaline) and -independent (forskolin) adenylyl cyclase stimulation. The specific protein synthesis inhibitor Pseudomonas exotoxin A was used to study whether the noradrenaline-induced up-regulation of Gi alpha subunits depends on increased synthesis of these proteins. This toxin inhibits peptide chain elongation by ADP-ribosylating elongation factor 2. Treatment of rat heart muscle cells with Pseudomonas exotoxin A (1 ng/ml) completely prevented the noradrenaline-induced increase in Gi alpha proteins, measured by both pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation and immunoblotting with anti-Gi alpha antibodies. Most importantly, Pseudomonas exotoxin A also completely prevented the noradrenaline-induced decrease in forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Furthermore, the noradrenaline-induced decrease in isoprenaline-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was significantly attenuated by the toxin, although the down-regulation of beta 1-adrenoceptors caused by noradrenaline treatment was not affected. The data presented suggest that prolonged activation of beta-adrenoceptors in rat heart muscle cells, in addition to causing a receptor down-regulation, induces the synthesis of Gi alpha proteins, which then apparently mediate a decreased adenylyl cyclase responsiveness. The data, additionally, suggest that the synthesis of Gi alpha proteins is under control of the activity of the adenylyl cyclase system and that altered levels of these proteins may play a major role in long term regulation of signal transduction by this enzyme.", 
    "68": "Renal responses to dopexamine were determined in anesthetized dogs in the absence and presence of dopamine receptor (DA1) and beta-2-adrenoceptor (beta-2) blockade. Dopexamine increased the rate of urine flow (V) and sodium excretion (UNaV) without affecting the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) or the urinary (UKV) and fractional (FEK) excretions of potassium. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was increased and renal vascular resistance (RVR) reduced by the drug. With infusion of the DA1 antagonist, SCH 23390, dopexamine decreased V, UNaV, FENa, UKV and FEK. The agonist-induced increase in GFR and decrease in RVR were blocked. In the presence of the beta-2 antagonist, ICI 118551, dopexamine increased V, UNaV, FENa UKV and FEK; RVR was reduced, whereas GFR remained unchanged. SCH 23390, combined with ICI 118551, blocked the renal responses to dopexamine. During sample collection, dopexamine did not significantly affect mean arterial pressure in any group. In conclusion, the actions of dopexamine at DA1 and beta-2 receptors produce opposing changes in electrolyte excretion. Its combined actions at these receptors produces an increase in UNaV, attributed to an increase in glomerular filtration.", 
    "69": "Renal storage; release, and biosynthesis of kallikrein were studied using rat cortical slices. This model permitted the study of the direct effect of norepinephrine on the renal kallikrein system in the absence of changes in perfusion pressure. Kallikrein was measured by its kininogenase activity and its direct immunoreactive concentration. Under basal conditions, rat kidney cortical slices synthesize and release glandular kallikrein in vitro at a linear rate for up to 40 min. Kidney slices obtained from rats fed with a low-sodium diet (LS) released more kallikrein into the incubation medium than slices from rats under a normal-sodium diet (NS). Cycloheximide and incubation at 4 degrees C inhibited the release and the biosynthesis of kallikrein independently of the sodium diet. Addition of norepinephrine (NE, 10(-8)-10(-5) M) induced a similar dose-dependent inhibition of kallikrein secretion, which reached -27 +/- 8% in NS rats and -29 +/- 9% in LS rats with 10(-7) M NE. This inhibition of the secretion was associated with an increase in tissue kallikrein concentration in kidney slices from rats on both sodium diets. However, a significant inhibition of the calculated net de novo synthesis was only observed in LS rats. In both groups of animals the ratio of active to total kallikrein was unchanged. The inhibitory effect of kallikrein secretion by NE was never modified in the presence of the alpha-antagonist phentolamine (10(-6) M). In contrast the beta-antagonist propranolol (10(-6) M) prevented the inhibitory effect of 10(-7) M NE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "70": "Adrenoceptor antagonists are being used increasingly for the treatment of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH). Previous studies have shown that these drugs can inhibit platelet aggregation and thromboxane production. The aims of this study were to determine (i) whether adrenoceptor antagonists had any effect on vascular prostacyclin (PGI2) production and (ii) whether these drugs acted synergistically with PGI2 and the PGI2-like activity derived from umbilical artery to inhibit platelet aggregation in vitro. The adrenoceptor antagonists labetalol, pindolol and propranolol were found to have no effect on PGI2 production from the umbilical artery at low drug concentrations. These agents were also found to act synergistically with both pure PGI2 and PGI2-like activity derived from umbilical artery to inhibit platelet aggregation. This synergistic effect may be beneficial in the treatment of disorders which are associated with reduced PGI2 production, such as PIH where such synergy may help compensate for PGI2 deficiency.", 
    "71": "The effect of epinephrine on amino acid (AA) metabolism was examined in 33 healthy volunteers who participated in four studies. Nine subjects participated in study I, which consisted of four parts: euglycemic insulin clamp, insulin plus epinephrine, insulin plus epinephrine plus propranolol, and insulin plus propranolol. In study II six subjects received epinephrine with hepatic-femoral venous catheterization. In study III five individuals received epinephrine with somatostatin plus basal insulin replacement. In study IV quadriceps muscle biopsy was performed in six subjects after epinephrine or insulin infusion. Both epinephrine and insulin caused a generalized decline in all plasma AA except alanine. With combined epinephrine-insulin infusion, the decrease in plasma AA was additive. Propranolol blocked the hypoaminoacidemic effect of epinephrine but failed to alter the AA lowering action of insulin. Epinephrine, while maintaining basal insulinemia, reduced the catechol's hypoaminoacidemic effect by 39%. After epinephrine, splanchnic alanine uptake increased, but plasma alanine remained constant because of a parallel rise in muscle alanine production. Plasma/intracellular concentrations of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and all gluconeogenic amino acids, except alanine, decreased after both epinephrine and insulin. In summary, the effect of epinephrine on plasma/intracellular total, gluconeogenic, and BCAA concentrations is similar to insulin.", 
    "72": "Despite recent controversies in hypertension management, family physicians can confidently follow a straightforward diagnostic and treatment approach. Routine use of echocardiography or 24-hour ambulatory monitoring is not recommended in the initial work-up of hypertension. The optimum goal for the diastolic blood pressure remains at 80 to 85 mm Hg. As many as 20 to 25 percent of patients with mild hypertension become normotensive with dietary modifications, exercise and alcohol cessation. In patients with mild hypertension, these nonpharmacologic approaches should be tried for three to six months before drug therapy is instituted. Initial drug therapy should be chosen on the basis of effectiveness, ease of administration, tolerability, cost and long-term safety record. Many of the reported adverse metabolic effects of diuretics may be of limited clinical significance. Despite the availability of newer antihypertensives, diuretics remain a choice in most patients as initial therapy or as a step-2 drug.", 
    "73": "Swelling of primary astrocyte cultures by exposing them to hypotonic media caused release of label after the cells had been allowed to accumulate 3H-L-glutamate, 3H-D-aspartate, or 3H-taurine. Comparable release of endogenous L-glutamate or taurine, as measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), was also found. Release of label was not affected by treating the cells with cytochalasin B, indicating that microfilament polymerization was not significantly involved. Hypotonic-induced release did not appear to principally involve reversal of the Na(+)-dependent uptake system since increasing external K+ to depolarize the cells by replacement of external Na+, thus maintaining isotonic conditions, increased release to a lesser extent. Threo beta-hydroxyaspartate, a potent 3H-L-glutamate uptake blocker, added externally stimulated efflux of 3H-L-glutamate independently of the swelling-induced efflux. Upon restoration of swollen cells to isotonic medium they showed an unimpaired ability to take up 3H-L-glutamate. The swelling-induced release of label was inhibited by a number of anion transport inhibitors, one of which has been shown to significantly improve outcome in an experimental brain trauma/hypoxia model in which astrocyte swelling is an early event.", 
    "74": "The prevalence and patterns of silent myocardial ischemia were evaluated in 105 stable angina patients receiving conventional antianginal drug therapy. During 2,520 hours of electrocardiographic monitoring, silent ischemia was detected in 45 (43%) patients. A total of 188 ischemic episodes was observed; 163 (87%) were silent and accounted for a total ischemic duration of 5,771 minutes. There was no difference in the baseline clinical characteristics between the patients with and without ambulatory silent ischemia. However, patients with silent ischemia on ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring had earlier onset of ischemia during exercise testing. The highest density of silent ischemic events occurred between 6 A.M. and 6 P.M. Comparison of the class or combination of antianginal agents used by the 2 groups revealed no difference. However, in patients with silent ischemia the mean duration per event was shorter for those receiving 2 (p less than 0.05) or more (p = 0.001) antianginal agents compared to those receiving monotherapy. The average duration of silent ischemia per event was significantly less (p less than 0.001) in patients receiving beta blockers. These results demonstrate that silent ischemia during ordinary daily activities occurs frequently despite conventional antianginal drugs prescribed for control of symptoms.", 
    "75": "The molecular basis of ligand binding selectivity to beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes was investigated by designing chimeric beta 1/beta 2-adrenergic receptors. These molecules consisted of a set of reciprocal constructions, obtained by the exchange between the wild-type receptor genes of one to three unmodified transmembrane regions, together with their extracellular flanking regions. Eight different chimeras were expressed in Escherichia coli and studied with selective beta-adrenergic ligands. The evaluation of the relative effect of each chimeric exchange on ligand binding affinity was based on the analysis of delta G values, calculated from the equilibrium binding constants, as a function of the number of substituted beta 2-adrenergic receptor transmembrane domains. The data showed that the contribution of each exchanged region to subtype selectivity varies with each ligand; moreover, while several regions are critical for the pharmacological selectivity of all ligands, others are involved in the selectivity of only some compounds. The selectivity displayed by beta-adrenergic compounds towards beta 1 or beta 2 receptor subtypes thus results from a particular combination of interactions between each ligand and each of the subsites, variably distributed over the seven transmembrane regions of the receptor; these subsites are presumably defined by the individual structural properties of the ligands.", 
    "76": "It is questioned whether alterations of the sympathetic nervous system can explain the specific increment of the adipocyte alpha 2-adrenoceptor observed during white adipose tissue (WAT) enlargement and fat cell size increment. The impact of a 6-hydroxydopamine-induced sympathectomy, validated by determination of the WAT norepinephrine content, was tested on isolated white fat cell alpha 2-adrenoceptor function and binding [( 3H]RX 821002 and [3H]UK 14304 binding). Chemical sympathectomy of standard adult hamsters, neither alters the alpha 2-adrenergic-dependent antilipolysis nor the adipocyte alpha 2-adrenergic binding. A slight hypersensitivity of the beta 1-adrenergic lipolytic response was observed, without modification in beta-adrenergic binding [( 125I]cyanopindolol binding). Compared with controls, caloric restriction (10 days) of adult hamsters induced a large decrease in adipocyte alpha 2-adrenoceptor (P less than 0.001) with a parallel decrement in the mean fat cell size (P less than 0.001) and alpha 2-adrenergic responsiveness while there was no significant variation of the WAT norepinephrine content (on a per pad basis). 6-Hydroxydopamine treatment of the restricted animals (from day 6 to day 9) induced a higher preservation of adipocyte alpha 2-adrenoceptor density (P less than 0.001), no change in alpha 2-adrenergic responsiveness, and higher preservation of mean fat cell size (P less than 0.05) than in the restricted only animals. No significant modification in the beta-adrenergic binding was observed whatever the conditions. It was concluded that the specific increment in the adipocyte alpha 2-adrenoceptor during fat mass enlargement was not directly dependent on sympathetic nervous system alterations. Nevertheless, the sympathetic-dependent mobilization of the fat stores, after induction of caloric restriction, can indirectly modulate the alpha 2-adrenoceptor density in the adipocyte by promoting changes in white fat cell size.", 
    "77": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a peptide found in a variety of hypothalamic loci which is frequently colocalized with catecholamines. It is also secreted into hypophyseal portal vessels. The injection of NPY into the third ventricle (3V) lowered plasma GH levels in conscious, freely moving male rats. To determine the physiological significance of the hypothalamic inhibitory action of the peptide, highly specific antiserum directed against NPY was injected into the 3V of conscious rats. 3V injection of the antiserum evoked a significant elevation of plasma GH within 2 h on comparison to values in normal rabbit serum-injected, ovariectomized rats. The difference increased and reached a maximum at 6 h after injection. On the other hand, there was no effect of the antiserum in ovariectomized, estrogen, progesterone-blocked rats. Intraventricular injection of the anti-NPY serum also caused a significant elevation of plasma GH within 2 h in normal male rats and the increases above values in normal rat serum-injected control animals became even more significant at 3 and 4 h. To determine the mechanism by which NPY lowers GH after its intraventricular injection, its effect on the release of somatostatin (SRIF) from median eminence fragments incubated in vitro was examined. NPY stimulated SRIF release with a highly significant effect at a concentration of 10(-9) M. Borderline stimulation was observed at doses as low as 10(-11) M. The curve was bell-shaped with a declining release at 10(-8) M and 10(-7) M. The releasing action of NPY was blocked by either the alpha 1-receptor blocker, prazosin (10(-6) M), or the beta-receptor blocker, propranolol (10(-6) M), but was not affected by the alpha 2-receptor blocker, yohimbine (10(-6) M). We conclude that NPY has a physiologically significant inhibitory action within the hypothalamus to suppress GH release in ovariectomized female and intact male rats by stimulation of SRIF release by alpha 1 and beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated mechanisms.", 
    "78": "Chloride (Cl) of saliva evoked by electrical stimulation of the parasympathetic nerve to parotid gland was from two to seven times higher than that elicited with sympathetic nerve stimulation; [Cl] remained elevated (125-135 mEq/liter) for 60 min of parasympathetic nerve stimulation, whereas Cl of sympathetically evoked saliva decreased from high levels of 58 to 15 to 20 mEq/liter. The administration of propranolol, the beta-adrenergic antagonist, 20 min prior to initiation of sympathetic nerve stimulation resulted in saliva with Cl of 100 mEq/liter; when phentolamine, the alpha-adrenergic antagonist was administered prior to sympathetic nerve stimulation, [Cl] was 48-35 mEq/liter. Values with the beta-agonist, isoproterenol, were about 35 mEq/liter, whereas phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, evoked saliva with Cl ranging from 113 to 85 mEq/liter. Flow rate was very high with parasympathetic nerve stimulation and low with sympathetic nerve stimulation, but [Cl] with beta-blockade was not flow dependent: flow was very low but Cl high. Cl secretion is principally regulated by activation of cholinergic and alpha-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "79": "Alterations in myocardial mechanics and left ventricular myosin isoenzymes by long-term treatment of hypertension with arotinolol were examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Approximately 20 mg/kg/day arotinolol was administered to 22-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats for 8-10 weeks. There was no significant difference in systolic blood pressure between arotinolol-treated and untreated rats. However, ventricular weight tended to decrease in the arotinolol-treated group, although not significantly. There were no significant differences in isometric developed tension and dT/dtmax of isolated left ventricular papillary muscles between the arotinolol-treated and untreated groups. The left ventricular myosin isoenzyme pattern, on the other hand, obtained by pyrophosphate gel electrophoresis, showed a significant shift toward VM-1 as a result of long-term arotinolol treatment.", 
    "80": "A release of histamine after the lipophilic betablockers exaprolol and propranolol correlates with their capability of displacing the bound membrane Ca2+ and increasing the disorder of phospholipidic membranes of the isolated mast cells. Electron microscopy confirmed intracellular displacement of histamine from granules of mast cells after exaprolol without marked structural changes on the plasmatic membrane. Hydrophilic and selective atenolol, which does not possess a histamine-liberating effect, decreases spontaneous transfer of the intracellular calcium, decreases the disorder of the mast-cell membranes, and together with exaprolol and propranolol inhibits, in dose-dependence way, the gain of extracellular histamine in cells. The inhibitory effect of EDTA, tetrodotoxine and suramine on histamine release after exaprolol explains the non-receptor mechanism of exaprolol effect, which confirms a possibility of induction of adverse effects of blockers of the beta-adrenergic receptor in the development of a bronchospasm.", 
    "81": "STUDY OBJECTIVE - The aim of the study was to measure variations in ATP synthase capacity in cultured cardiomyocytes under conditions of metabolic stimulation. DESIGN - ATP synthase activity was measured in cultured rat cardiomyocytes using a procedure which allowed rapid measurement of mitochondrial function during changes in metabolic state. EXPERIMENTAL MATERIAL - Calcium tolerant cardiomyocytes were prepared from male Wistar rats, weight 250-300 g, n = 6-22 per experiment. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS - Electrical stimulation of cardiomyocytes led to an approximate doubling of ATP synthase capacity within 1-2 min, and was rapidly reversible. Activation was reduced when extracellular calcium was lowered and abolished in presence of the calcium entry blocker ruthenium red. Exposure of cardiomyocytes to isoprenaline or to an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase III also led to a large increase in ATP synthase capacity, which was abolished in presence of ruthenium red. However, the response of cells to isoprenaline depended on their pretreatment: activation of ATP synthase was abolished after 20 min anoxia prior to isoprenaline treatment but regained after a subsequent 30 min reoxygenation. This may reflect down regulation of beta receptors on the cell surface during anoxia. CONCLUSIONS - ATP synthase is directly controlled in vivo by a non-allosteric mechanism. Activation of ATP synthase is a response to intramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration.", 
    "82": "1. We have examined in guinea-pigs, in vivo, the effects of inhibition of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) on the airway response to aerosolised substance P (SP). We aerosolised captopril (4.6 mM, 60 breaths; 210 nmol) to inhibit ACE and acetorphan (0.3, 1 and 3 mM, 60 breaths; 9 nmol, 33 nmol and 110 nmol respectively) to inhibit NEP. We also examined the effect of the highest dose of acetorphan (110 nmol) on the response to aerosolised acetylcholine (ACh). 2. Responsiveness to SP (or ACh) was measured as the change in lung resistance (RL) induced by nebulisation of increasing concentrations of SP (or ACh) before and after treatment with the inhibitor. PC200, defined as the provocative concentration inducing an increase in RL of 200% above baseline was calculated for each challenge. 3. Administration of acetorphan before the second SP-challenge induced a dose-dependent decrease in PC200 for SP amounting to 1.8 (+/- 0.3) log units after treatment with 11 nmol acetorphan. Treatment with vehicle before the second SP-challenge or with 3 mM acetorphan before the second ACh-challenge had no significant effect on PC200. 4. Treatment with captopril (21 nmol) induced only a small, nonsignificant leftward shift of PC200 to SP (0.3 +/- 0.2 log units). 5. We conclude that a NEP-like enzyme, but not ACE, regulates the response to aerosolised SP. We suggest that the same is true for SP released endogenously from sensory nerve endings in the airway epithelial layer.", 
    "83": "1. The effects of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on mechanical and electrophysiological responses were studied in the guinea-pig atrial muscle preparations and in single cells. 2. CGRP (greater than 10(-9) M) enhanced the twitch contraction in a concentration-dependent manner in electrically driven left atria and increased heart rate in spontaneously beating right atria. The positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of CGRP were not inhibited by propranolol but were attenuated by reduction of the calcium concentration in the bathing medium. 3. In single left atrial cells, CGRP slightly hyperpolarized the resting potential but did not affect the other action potential parameters significantly. 4. Under whole-cell voltage-clamp conditions, CGRP increased the calcium inward current. The peptide also increased the steady inward current elicited by hyperpolarization and the late outward current by depolarization. 5. These results suggest that CGRP may produce the positive inotropic and presumably chronotropic effects by increasing calcium inward current. CGRP also increases the potassium permeability. Such effects on ionic currents may not produce any apparent change in the action potential conformation, due to their opposite directional actions and relatively weak potencies.", 
    "84": "Autonomic blockade for in vivo electrophysiological studies generally involves atropine and beta blockers, ignoring the potential role of alpha-adrenergic activity. To evaluate the importance, if any, of alpha-adrenergic tone, the electrophysiological effects of incremental doses of phenylephrine were examined in eight chloralose-anesthetized dogs. In order to study direct effects, all dogs were both beta blocked (with nadolol) and vagally blocked (with the combination of vagotomy and atropine). Results were also obtained after normalization of blood pressure with nitroprusside or the alpha-blocker, prazosin. Phenylephrine caused dose-dependent increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This was accompanied by consistent but modest decreases in sinus cycle length (control RR interval 492 +/- 34 msec vs 459 +/- 29 msec after dose 1 of phenylephrine, P less than 0.05, 516 +/- 41 vs 484 +/- 34 msec control versus dose 2, P less than 0.05). These increases in automaticity were not prevented after normalization of arterial pressure by nitroprusside, but were reversed when concomitant alpha-receptor blockade was achieved with prazosin, suggesting that sinus node acceleration resulted directly from alpha-receptor stimulation. No effects on atrial, AV nodal or His-Purkinje conduction were noted. In addition, phenylephrine did not affect atrial, AV nodal, or ventricular refractoriness. In conclusion, conduction and refractoriness of normal cardiac tissue (other than the sinus node) are unaffected by direct alpha-receptor stimulation. This justifies the use of combined beta and muscarinic blockers to achieve autonomic blockade under most circumstances.", 
    "85": "Experiments were designed to study the potential mechanisms underlying the vasodilator effect of celiprolol. Rings of canine left circumflex coronary artery and rat mesenteric artery, with and without endothelium, were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. In both blood vessels, celiprolol (10(-9)-10(-4) M) failed to produce relaxation in rings with and without endothelium; these same tissues relaxed in an endothelium-dependent manner to acetylcholine (10(-6) M). All tissues relaxed completely in the presence of papaverine (10(-4) M). In the coronary artery, isoproterenol (10(-9)-10(-4) M) produced endothelium-independent relaxations which were inhibited in a competitive fashion by celiprolol (pA2 = 7.52 +/- 0.14; slope = 0.98, 95% confidence limits = 0.80-1.15). In other experiments, strips of canine saphenous veins were incubated with [3H]norepinephrine [( 3H]NE) and suspended for superfusion. Electrical stimulation (2 Hz, 4 V, 2 ms for 6 min) produced an increase in [3H]NE overflow. Isoproterenol (2 X 10(-6) M) augmented the evoked release of [3H]NE. Treatment of the strips with celiprolol (up to 5 X 10(-6) M) did not inhibit isoproterenol-induced facilitation of [3H]NE release. Thus, although celiprolol is a potent antagonist of postjunctional beta-adrenoceptors in the coronary artery, no evidence was obtained for a direct or indirect vasodilator effect of celiprolol on isolated blood vessels.", 
    "86": "Flecainide acetate, a class Ic antiarrhythmic agent, is eliminated to a larger extent by renal excretion and to a minor extent by the liver. In patients with impaired renal function or with elevated urinary pH, however, its elimination is dominated by hepatic metabolism. Recent evidence suggests that the in vivo metabolism of flecainide is controlled by the genetic polymorphism of the debrisoquin/sparteine type; i.e., it is a substrate of cytochrome P450IID6. We investigated the inhibitory effect of flecainide on bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation in human liver microsomes in vitro and on the metabolic dextromethorphan urinary ratio in eight healthy male volunteers. Both bufuralol and dextromethorphan are well-known substrates of cytochrome P450IID6. Microsomal bufuralol 1-hydroxylation was competitively inhibited by flecainide with an apparent Ki of 0.954 mumol/L. Moreover, a statistically significant increase in the urinary metabolic ratio (MR) of dextromethorphan/dextrorphan after 1 week of administration of oral flecainide was observed (p = 0.013) in all subjects. One individual increased the urinary MR to a value consistent with the poor metabolizer phenotype. We conclude that flecainide is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450IID6 in vitro and in vivo and that careful drug monitoring is required with respect to renal function, debrisoquine phenotype, and concomitant drug administration.", 
    "87": "The role of beta 1-adrenoceptors in mediation of vasodilatation is not clear. The microsphere technique was used to compare the effects of mixed beta-, beta 1-, and beta 2-stimulation on blood flow and conductance changes in five groups of pentobarbital-anesthetized rats: I, vehicle; II, mixed beta-stimulation; III, beta 1-stimulation; IV, beta 2-stimulation; and V, mixed beta-blockade. Isoproterenol (32 ng/kg/min) was infused into rats either without (group II) or with ICI 118,551 (beta 2-blocker, 30 micrograms/kg, group III), atenolol (beta 1-blocker, 100 micrograms/kg, group IV), or both blockers (group V), respectively. At the doses selected, ICI 118,551 shifted the dose-vasodepressor response curve of salbutamol (beta 2-agonist) to the right but had no effect on the dose-chronotropic response curve of dobutamine (beta 1-agonist), whereas atenolol shifted the dose-chronotropic response curve of dobutamine to the right and had no effect on the dose-vasodepressor response curve of salbutamol. The results show that isoproterenol increased heart rate (HR) and arterial conductances in the coronary and skeletal muscle beds but had no effects in other beds. Combined with ICI 118,551, isoproterenol caused similar increases in HR and coronary arterial conductance but markedly less increase in skeletal muscle conductance. Atenolol abolished the increase in HR by isoproterenol but did not affect the increases in coronary and muscular arterial conductances. With both blockers, isoproterenol produced no increase in coronary and skeletal muscle conductance. Therefore, both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors play a role in coronary and skeletal muscle vasodilatation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "88": "Extracellular recordings were conducted in the paraflocculus of anesthetized Long-Evans pigmented rats to determine how ionotophoresis of norepinephrine (NE) affects the responsiveness of individual Purkinje cells and interneurons to presentations of visual stimuli within their visual receptive fields. Presentations of moving or stationary visual stimuli during the control (pre-NE) period elicited simple spike excitations or inhibitory responses in slightly more than one-half (55%, n = 32) of the cells tested (20 of 38 Purkinje cells, 12 of 20 interneurons). The predominant effect of NE iontophoresis was to improve visually evoked responses in those neurons which showed modulations in their simple spike discharge to control presentations of visual stimuli. A clear enhancement of visual responses by NE (i.e., absolute increase over control) was observed in 18 of the units, and in 12 of the 14 remaining cells, reductions in stimulus-bound discharge during catecholamine iontophoresis were accompanied by much larger depressions in background activity, resulting in a net enhancement in the ratio of signal-to-noise. NE differentially affected responses to stimulus movement in the preferred and non-preferred direction in one-third of these neurons, such that directional selectivity was increased. However, the orientation bias of individual units was unchanged by NE. Iontophoretic application of the beta-adrenergic antagonist sotalol but not the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine blocked these facilitating noradrenergic effects. An additional feature of noradrenergic action was revealed in tests conducted in 26 cells which did not respond to control presentations of visual stimuli. Iontophoresis of NE resulted in the elicitation of visual responses in 11 of these units, suggesting the possibility that NE might act in some cases to gate the efficacy of subliminal synaptic input conveyed by classical afferent channels. It is proposed that an important aspect of noradrenergic action within local cerebellar circuits might be to refine the receptive field properties of individual neuronal elements and thereby improve information flow through the cerebellum.", 
    "89": "The acute effects of various antihypertensive agents on cerebral blood flow and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were studied in anesthetized (amobarbital 100 mg/kg) spontaneously hypertensive rats. Cerebral blood flow in the cortex and thalamus was measured by the hydrogen clearance method before and during a 60-min i.v. infusion of calcium antagonist (nifedipine), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) or beta-blocker (propranolol). Nifedipine, 30 or 150 micrograms/kg per h, decreased dose dependently the MAP by 20 or 31%, and concomitantly increased cortical blood flow by 28 or 74%, and thalamic blood flow by 51 or 64%, respectively. Captopril, 10 or 100 mg/kg per h, decreased MAP by 7 or 14%, but changed cerebral blood flow minimally. In contrast, propranolol, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg per h, decreased MAP by 13 or 11%, with a concomitant reduction of cortical and thalamic blood flow by 20 or 15 and 33 or 37%, respectively. It is concluded that the changes in cerebral blood flow in response to hypotension are varied by antihypertensive drugs depending on the direct or indirect effect of the drugs (dilatation or constriction) on cerebral vessels. Nifedipine seems to dilate while propranolol constricts cerebral vessels.", 
    "90": "The effects of insulin on human beta-adrenoceptor density and isoproterenol-induced cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation were characterized in mononuclear leukocytes from healthy subjects. In cells equilibrated with theophylline (4 mM) at 37 degrees C, insulin (4 microU/ml) was present in periods from 1 to 35 min prior to stimulation. The basal cAMP levels were not influenced. After 1 min pretreatment with insulin, the (-)-isoproterenol concentration necessary to cause half-maximal stimulation (EC50) decreased from 260 to 170 nM (P less than 0.025) and the maximal (-)-isoproterenol response above basal increased from 44 to 63 pmol/10(6) cells (P less than 0.01). The short exposure to insulin caused an increase in the number of functional beta-adrenoceptors from 1420 to 2160 receptors/cell (P less than 0.01). The increased (-)-isoproterenol responsiveness showed a time-dependent decline. When insulin had been present for 35 min before stimulation, the EC50 value had increased to 600 nM (P less than 0.01 vs. control) and the maximal (-)-isoproterenol response above basal was reduced to 29 pmol/10(6) cells (P less than 0.01 vs. control). The receptor density decreased to the pretreatment value (1480 receptors/cell) after 35 min exposure to insulin. The present study shows that insulin modifies the beta-adrenoceptor density as well as the beta-adrenoceptor coupling to adenylate cyclase, dependent on the duration of exposure.", 
    "91": "The effect of long-term therapy of hypertension with antihypertensive drugs was investigated in 117 previously untreated patients (15 women, 102 men; mean age 46.4 +/- 9 years) with echocardiographically proven left-ventricular hypertrophy. 22 patients (group 1) received 100 mg/d Gallopamil, 25 (group 2) received 200 mg/d Metoprolol, 35 daily received both 50 mg Atenolol and 20 mg Nifedipine (group 3), 14 received daily 200 mg Acebutolol plus 20 mg Nifedipine (group 4), and 21 (group 5) 50 mg Atenolol plus 10 mg Enalapril daily. The treatment period lasted a mean of 38 (36.2-42.3) months. Left-ventricular muscle mass index (LVMI) as well as septal and posterior-wall thickness decreased significantly after 12.8 and 38.5 months (P less than 0.001). After a mean of 38.5 months LVMI had decreased by 36.7% in group 1, 35.1% in group 2, 42.3% in group 3, 45% in group 4 and 39.6% in group 5. LVMI was within normal range (less than or equal to 95 g/m2) in 81 of the 117 patients (69.2%) at the end of the treatment period. There was, however, no significant increase of the end-diastolic dimension of the left ventricle, but a significant increase of \"fractional shortening\" as a measure of myocardial contractility.", 
    "92": "About 90% of the glycogenin in skeletal muscle extracts prepared from fed, 24-h starved or alloxan-diabetic rabbits sedimented at 140,000 x g with the glycogen/sarcovesicular fraction, from which it was released by glycogenolysis, but not by 1% SDS. Glycogenin in the glycogen/sarcovesicular fraction is therefore bound covalently to glycogen, and not associated (covalently or non-covalently) with the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The same proportion of glycogen synthase was also recovered in the glycogen/sarcovesicle fraction, was solubilised by glycogenolysis, and copurified with glycogenin to yield a heterodimer composed of a 1:1 complex between these proteins. Glycogen synthase and glycogenin are therefore present in equimolar amounts in skeletal muscle and there is an average of one glycogen synthase catalytic subunit associated with each molecule of glycogen in vivo. Glycogenin and glycogen synthase released into the muscle cytosol by degradation of glycogen did not form a complex initially, and only 50% reassociation took place after storage for several hours or overnight dialysis. This suggests that the muscle cytosol may contain a factor(s) which regulates glycogen biogenesis by modulating the association of glycogenin and glycogen synthase. Only glycogen synthase that was complexed to glycogenin was capable of elongating the primer formed by incubation of glycogenin with Mn2+ and micromolar concentrations of UDP-glucose, demonstrating the critical importance of this complex for glycogen biogenesis.", 
    "93": "It is widely accepted that the activation of the NADPH oxidase of phagocytes is linked to the stimulation of protein kinase C by diacylglycerol formed by hydrolysis of phospholipids. The main source would be choline containing phospholipid via phospholipase D and phosphatidate phosphohydrolase. This paper presents a condition where the activation of the respiratory burst by FMLP correlates with the formation of phosphatidic acid, via phospholipase D, and not with that of diacylglycerol. In fact: 1) in neutrophils treated with propranolol, an inhibitor of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, FMLP plus cytochalasin B induces a respiratory burst associated with a stimulation of phospholipase D, formation of phosphatidic acid and complete inhibition of that of diacylglycerol. 2) The respiratory burst by FMLP plus cytochalasin B lasts a few minutes and may be restimulated by propranolol which induces an accumulation of phosphatidic acid. 3) In neutrophils stimulated by FMLP in the absence of cytochalasin B propranolol causes an accumulation of phosphatidic acid and a marked enhancement of the respiratory burst without formation of diacylglycerol. 4) The inhibition of the formation of phosphatidic acid via phospholipase D by butanol inhibits the respiratory burst by FMLP.", 
    "94": "We investigated response bias (defined as the decision rule subjects adopt when uncertain) in two experiments using a variant of Signal Detection Theory (SDT) with the discrimination measure d'L and the bias measure CL, under which it is possible to independently evaluate discrimination and response bias. In the first experiment, manics, depressed subjects, and matched psychiatrically normal controls were tested with a recognition memory task with easier and more difficult components before and after 1 month of appropriate pharmacological treatment. This experiment showed that abnormally conservative bias was characteristic of depression and liberal (yea-saying) bias was found in mania regardless of severity of illness; discrimination deficits were found only when symptoms were severe. After treatment, aspects of discrimination worsened in both hypomanic and depressed nonresponders whereas response bias remained unchanged in these patients. In both groups of responders, improvements in response bias were more dramatic than improvements in discrimination. In the second experiment, psychiatrically normal hypertensives were tested with a Sternberg short-term memory scanning task on and off treatment with the centrally active beta-blocker propranolol. This experiment showed that treatment with propranolol modeled the bias deficit of depression; that is, bias became more conservative. Both sets of results suggest that disorders of decision may be modulated by beta-adrenergic function.", 
    "95": "The application of beta-blocking agents in endurance sports leads to deterioration of physical capacity because of negative influence of hemodynamics and metabolism. In sports with modest dynamic but high psychological strain it leads to an increase of physical capacity and decrease of stress caused by competition. The present paper summarizes changes in ski jumping, flying, motor car racing, parachute jumping, bob running and shooting. Significant decreases of heart rate, modest decreases in blood pressure as well as a reduction of occasionally appearing extrasystoles are found. Levels of glucose and lactate as well as cholesterol and triglycerides remain unchanged during beta-blockade, as do free fatty acids and free glycerol with placebo under beta-adrenolyse. Whereas ski and parachute jumpers display psychologic stress, bob runners and sport shooters were positively influenced. As a possible reason for an increased physical capacity after sympathicolysis, changes of cardiovascular parameters as well as central influences are conceivable. The application of beta-blocking agents should be regarded as \"doping\" because of the increases of physical capacity and should be avoided in healthy sportsmen."
