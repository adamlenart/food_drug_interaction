    "0": "The antiarrhythmic properties of d-sotalol were studied in 38 patients undergoing electrophysiologic studies. Programmed electrical stimulation studies were performed in 28 men and in 10 women with a mean age of 67 years and a mean ejection fraction of 37 +/- 3%. All patients had inducible ventricular tachycardia while they were off all antiarrhythmic therapy. D-sotalol was given as a 2 mg/kg infusion over 15 minutes and did not significantly change the PR, QRS, or QTc intervals from baseline values in the group as a whole. In the group protected by d-sotalol, the percent change in the QTc interval as well as the percent change in refractoriness was significantly increased as compared to the group not protected. D-sotalol also significantly decreased heart rate. D-sotalol prevented the induction of ventricular tachycardia in 18 of the 38 patients, while significantly slowing the rate of the ventricular tachycardia in the group that could still have tachycardia provoked. Seventeen patients were tested on procainamide and only four were protected, while d-sotalol prevented the induction of ventricular tachycardia in 7 of these 17. Eleven patients were discharged on oral d-sotalol doses ranging from 100 to 400 mg twice daily. One patient died 1 month post discharge due to an acute myocardial infarction, and one patient had a cardiac arrest while on d-sotalol and survived and was switched to amiodarone therapy. The remaining nine patients are alive and well at 14 +/- 3 months. D-sotalol appears to be an effective antiarrhythmic drugs and appears to be well tolerated.", 
    "1": "Two hundred primigravid women with mild preeclampsia at 26-35 weeks' gestation were randomly allocated to treatment with hospitalization alone or combined with labetalol. There were no differences between the two groups in mean systolic or diastolic pressures, mean gestational age, or initial laboratory findings at time of entry. Patients in the labetalol group demonstrated a statistically significant (P less than .005) decrease in blood pressure during treatment. No such decrease occurred in the hospitalization-alone group. Both groups exhibited significant deterioration in proteinuria, creatinine, and uric acid. The average days of pregnancy prolongation (mean +/- SD) were 21.3 +/- 13 and 20.1 +/- 14 days in the hospitalization and labetalol groups, respectively. There were no differences between the groups regarding any of the following: gestational age at delivery, birth weight, number of infants admitted to the special care unit, or cord blood gas measurements. However, the incidence of small-for-gestational-age infants was significantly higher in the labetalol group (19 versus 9%, P less than .05). There were no stillbirths, but one neonatal death in the labetalol group. Treatment of maternal blood pressure in preeclamptic pregnancies with labetalol did not improve perinatal outcome, and was associated with a higher frequency of fetal growth retardation.", 
    "2": "A permanent pacemaker was inserted in eight patients with the long QT syndrome. All had recurrent syncope or seizures, six had documented torsade de pointes and four had aborted sudden death. Among the eight patients, permanent pacing was instituted in three who were unsuccessfully treated with both a beta-adrenergic blocking agent and left cardiothoracic sympathectomy, and in two who proved refractory or intolerant to beta-blockers. Another three patients had pacemaker implantation and long-term beta-blocker therapy because of spontaneous atrioventricular (AV) block in one, aborted sudden death in one and patient preference in one. After pacing (70 to 85 beats/min), there was no significant change in the mean corrected QT interval, but the mean QT interval decreased significantly (534.4 +/- 51.4 to 425.6 +/- 18.9 ms, p less than 0.0001). Over a mean follow-up period of 35.1 +/- 18.9 months, all patients are alive and currently free of syncope. One patient without a history of stress-induced syncope had two syncopal episodes (believed to be due to hyperventilation) while under severe emotional stress, but has been symptom free for the past 5 years. One patient with an atrial demand (AAI) pacemaker developed dizziness due to documented episodes of AV block, but remains asymptomatic after conversion to atrial rate-responsive dual chamber (DDD) pacing. Either atrial or ventricular pacing combined with beta-blocker therapy appears to be effective treatment for a subset of patients with the long QT syndrome, by either preventing episodes of torsade de pointes or alleviating symptoms due to bradycardia from beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "3": "To assess the intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic effects of beta-blockade and its benefits in limiting myocardial ischemia and infarction, a group of 32 patients scheduled for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery (group 1) was treated with oral metoprolol immediately before surgery and with intravenous metoprolol during the postoperative period. Mean age was 71 years, and mean ejection fraction was 56% (range 36% to 83%). Eight patients had a preoperative history of angina, 13 had a history of myocardial infarction, and five had electrocardiographic evidence of prior myocardial infarction. A group of 51 closely matched patients with AAA who did not receive metoprolol served as controls (group 2). In group 1, overall hemodynamic tolerance of metoprolol intraoperatively and postoperatively was good, and there was no incidence of congestive heart failure, hypotension, or asthma. Furthermore, in group 1 significant reduction of systolic blood pressure and heart rate was consistently noted at frequent intraoperative intervals and for 48 hr after surgery, with only a transient reduction of cardiac index. In group 1, only one patient (3%) suffered an acute myocardial infarction. In contrast, nine group 2 patients (18%; p less than .05) suffered perioperative myocardial infarction. Furthermore, only four (12.5%) group 1 patients developed significant cardiac arrhythmias as opposed to 29 group 2 patients (56.9%; p less than .001). These data demonstrate that beta-blockade with metoprolol is effective in controlling systolic blood pressure and heart rate both intraoperatively and postoperatively in patients undergoing repair of AAA and can significantly reduce the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction and arrhythmias.", 
    "4": "The effect of long-acting propranolol hydrochloride (160 mg/d), primidone (250 mg at night), and clonazepam (4 mg/d) on the resting, postural, and kinetic component of tremor was investigated in ten parkinsonian patients in a double-blind crossover design. Tremor was assessed by patient opinion, clinical scoring, and accelerometer recordings. The amplitude and frequency of tremorgrams were determined by spectral analysis. Most patients preferred long-acting propranolol and chose to continue taking the drug. The mean clinical score for resting and postural tremor was significantly decreased by long-acting propranolol but not by primidone or clonazepam. Long-acting propranolol reduced the mean amplitude of resting tremor by 70% and the mean amplitude of postural tremor by 50%. Mean tremor amplitudes were not changed by primidone or clonazepam. Tremor frequency was unaltered by the drugs. No side effects occurred with long-acting propranolol but adverse reactions were common with primidone and clonazepam. Long-acting propranolol is a useful adjuvant therapy for the tremors associated with Parkinson's disease.", 
    "5": "Nine hundred and thirty nine moderate to severe hypertensive patients were treated with a combination of atenolol, a beta 1 selective receptor blocker, diuretics and where required, additional vasodilator therapy to achieve adequate blood pressure (BP) control. Patients were followed up for a period of 10.2 years (mean 6.1 years). Amassed clinical exposure amounted to 5465 patient years. Mean BP fell from 183.0 +/- 1.0/109.2 +/- 0.5 mmHg to 145.1 +/- 0.6/89.3 +/- 0.3 mmHg and treatment resulted in a significant regression of the electrocardiographic signs of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Side effects of treatment were consistent with those expected from a regime comprising a combination of a beta 1 selective hydrophilic beta-blocker, diuretics and vasodilators. Reported side effects appeared to diminish with time; were more common in the elderly than in the young and increased in frequency as the dose of atenolol increased. Biochemical disturbance was minimal. Total mortality (n = 91) and mortality from myocardial infarction (n = 40) were positively related to treated systolic blood pressure (SBP). A J-shaped curvilinear relationship between treated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and death rate from myocardial infarction has been shown. Although the number of deaths from stroke was small (n = 21), there appeared to be a positive relationship with treated DBP: by contrast the data suggest that in the elderly, lowering SBP to below about 140 mmHg might be associated with an increased incidence of death from stroke.", 
    "6": "In cultured chicken myotubes, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a peptide present in spinal cord motoneurons, increased by 1.5-fold the number of surface acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and by threefold AChR alpha-subunit mRNA level without affecting the level of muscular alpha-actin mRNA. Cholera toxin (CT), an activator of adenylate cyclase, produced a similar effect, which did not add up with that of CGRP. In contrast, tetrodotoxin, a blocker of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels, elevated the level of AChR alpha-subunit mRNA on top of the increase caused by either CGRP or CT. 12-O-Tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), an activator of protein kinase C, markedly decreased the cell surface and total content of [125I]alpha BGT-binding sites and reduced the rate of appearance of AChR at the surface of the myotubes without reducing the level of AChR alpha-subunit mRNA. Moreover, TPA inhibited the increase of AChR alpha-subunit mRNA caused by tetrodotoxin without affecting that produced by CGRP or CT. Under the same conditions, TPA decreased the level of muscular alpha-actin mRNA and increased that of nonmuscular beta- and gamma-actins mRNA. These data suggest that distinct second messengers are involved in the regulation of AChR biosynthesis by CGRP and muscle activity and that these two pathways may contribute to the development of different patterns of AChR gene expression in junctional and extrajunctional areas of the muscle fiber.", 
    "7": "The functional role of central catecholamines in regulation of ACTH secretion remains controversial. In the present report, the nature of catecholaminergic influences was directly assessed by measurement of hypophysial-portal plasma immunoreactive CRF (irCRF) levels after activation of endogenous aminergic pathways by electrical stimulation or administration of norepinephrine (NE). Electrical stimulation of the ventral noradrenergic ascending bundle, a fiber system primarily carrying catecholaminergic fibers arising from brainstem regions, resulted in a 2.9-fold elevation of portal irCRF levels. Pretreatment with the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist coryanthine, but not the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, blocked the facilitatory effect of electrical stimulation and reduced prestimulation irCRF levels by 34.7 +/- 4.2% (P less than 0.05). Intracerebroventricular administration of 0.1-5.0 nmol NE resulted in a dose-dependent facilitation of portal plasma irCRF levels which could be blocked by pretreatment with coryanthine. Alternatively, administration of greater than or equal to 5 nmol NE caused a dose-dependent inhibition of irCRF release which could be prevented by pretreatment with propranolol. Finally, irCRF secretion evoked by nitroprusside-induced hypotension was also blocked by pretreatment with coryanthine, but not propranolol. These observations provide strong evidence in favor of a predominantly stimulatory action of NE (and possibly epinephrine) at the hypothalamic level to evoke secretion of CRF and thus to activate the pituitary-adrenal axis.", 
    "8": "1 A threshold dose of Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) (0.5 microgram/kg i.v.), which did not modify the basal values of airway resistance, potentiated the acetylcholine induced bronchospasm in anaesthetized guinea-pigs. 2 beta-adrenoreceptors blockade induced by propranolol enhanced the positive interaction between PGD2 and acetylcholine in the pulmonary dynamics. 3 Active sensitization of guinea-pigs by ovalbumin increased the pulmonary PGD2-acetylcholine interaction and the phenomenon was sustained during the time. 4 The inability of PGD2 to potentiate histamine-induced bronchoconstriction suggests a specificity for the interaction.", 
    "9": "The aim of the study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of a low dose beta-blocker and diuretic combination in elderly hypertensives. In a prospective, double blind, placebo-controlled cross over study 30 patients with blood pressure higher than 160/90 mmHg and a mean age of 71.5 years were treated with a combination of sotalol hydrochloride 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg. With this regimen a significant drop in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (patient in sitting position) was obtained when compared with placebo (p less than 0.05). No significant side effects were noted because high-risk patients were excluded and the beta-blocker was used in low dose combination with thiazide diuretic for synergistic action. We conclude that a combination of beta-blocker and diuretic is an effective and safe therapy in carefully selected elderly patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "10": "To evaluate the effect of beta blockade on energy metabolism in ischaemic myocardium metoprolol tartrate in doses of 0.2 or 0.5 mg.kg-1 or saline was injected into 24 anaesthetised dogs 20 min after coronary ligation. Regional myocardial blood flow was measured by the hydrogen gas clearance method, and the heart rate and aortic pressure were recorded. After 60 min coronary occlusion myocardial biopsy specimens were removed from five areas where myocardial blood flow had been recorded to determine their content of adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP). Respiratory function and acyl-coenzyme A contents of mitochondria isolated from ischaemic and non-ischaemic myocardium were also measured. In the control group the ATP content in severely ischaemic myocardium where myocardial blood flow was less than 20 ml.min-1.100 g-1 was decreased to 27.5% of that in the non-ischaemic area, whereas the administration of metoprolol 0.5 mg.kg-1 maintained ATP content at 46.3%. In ischaemic myocardium metoprolol inhibited the accumulation of long chain acyl-coenzyme A in mitochondria and significantly preserved their respiratory function. In contrast, metoprolol did not affect myocardial blood flow in myocardium where flow was less than 60 ml.min-1.100 g-1. Heart rate was decreased by metoprolol in proportion to the dose, whereas mean aortic pressure was not changed. These results suggest that beta blockade had beneficial effects on the energy metabolism of ischaemic myocardium and that such effects might be due not only to a reduction in cardiac work but also to a reduction in the vicious circle of fatty acid metabolism in ischaemic myocardium.", 
    "11": "Fetal echocardiography, including simultaneous and ventricular M mode scans, allows the diagnosis of arrhythmias by studying the relationships between atrial and ventricular contractions. It also assesses cardiovascular tolerance by looking at pericardial or peritoneal effusion, left ventricular contraction and by measuring blood velocity in systole and diastole in umbilical arteries by Doppler techniques. We report here our experience on 221 arrhythmias found out of 1344 fetal echocardiographies performed since 1983. Bradycardia without atrio-ventricular dissociation in otherwise healthy fetuses were excluded since they are physiologic when moderate and transient. In addition, 180 out of our 221 cases had transient premature beats and were also excluded. It remained thus only 41 cases with true significant abnormalities of the fetal rhythm or conduction. Bradycardia with atrio-ventricular block and low ventricular rate was found in 15 fetuses. Ventricular rate was the first risk factor, since the tolerance was poor under 60 beats per minute (b/m). In this group, 9 cases were associated with cardiac malformations: mainly atrio-ventricular discordance, atrio-ventricular canal, double inlet ventricle. In the 6 other, the heart was normal and in only one, an immunologic disorder was found in the mother. Cardiovascular tolerance and gestation age were the two determinants for deciding on early delivery. In all cases, the newborn was referred to a pediatric cardiology center where specific measures (artificial pacing or simple follow-up) were undertaken.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "Sotalol (Sotalex; Sotacor) is a beta-blocker with additional class III antiarrhythmic activity. In this study two intravenous doses of 1.5 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg body weight were administered in 8 healthy volunteers in order to determine the pharmacokinetics and ECG intervals. After a short-term infusion (5 min) plasma levels and the relevant pharmacokinetic parameters were determined. The ECG parameters (QRS, PQ, QT, QTc), blood pressure, heart rate and tolerability were also evaluated. A correlation between the plasma concentration of sotalol, the decrease in heart rate and a prolongation of the real QT interval was found for both dose levels and for a period of 2 h after administration. A prolongation of the QTc-time could only be statistically confirmed for the higher dose. No differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were observed between the two doses.", 
    "13": "The autoregulation of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in cortex and thalamus upon an increase in systemic arterial blood pressure (ABP) was investigated in 27 cats before and after pretreatment with phentolamine (1 mg/kg, i.v.), propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.) or acebutolol (1.2 mg/kg, i.v.). The animals were anaesthetized with ether and chloralose. rCBF was measured by thermistor thermoclearance technique. ABP elevation was produced by angiotensin i.v. infusion. rCBF autoregulation was evaluated using different criteria--limits and indices of autoregulation. The data obtained indicate that thalamic rCBF is more resistant to ABP elevation than cortical rCBF. Phentolamine did not change rCBF autoregulation in cortex and thalamus. Propranolol did not change the cortical but increased the thalamic rCBF resistance to ABP elevation. Acebutolol did not influence rCBF autoregulation in thalamus. The results suggest that different mechanisms are involved in rCBF autoregulation in cortex and thalamus. They can be selectively influenced by pharmacological agents.", 
    "14": "Topical application of bradykinin (BK) to the surface of the left ventricle (epicardial application) of anesthetized guinea pigs elicited dose-dependent pressor effects and tachycardia. The pressor effect of epicardial BK was reduced by prior systemic treatment of animals with pentolinium or a combination of phentolamine and propranolol, but it was not affected by acute bilateral vagotomy or systemic administration of atropine, indomethacin, naloxone or a combination of mepyramine and cimetidine. The tachycardia caused by epicardial BK was not affected by any of the aforementioned drugs or by section of the vagi. Both the pressor effect and tachycardia evoked by epicardial BK were abolished by prior epicardial application of lidocaine, a local anesthetic, or by chronic systemic capsaicin treatment. These results suggest that the pressor effect of epicardial BK is partially reflex in nature and likely to result from the stimulation by BK of cardiac sympathetic, capsaicin-sensitive primary afferents, whereas the tachycardia caused by epicardial BK could be mediated by an intracardiac release of (a) cardioaccelerating substance(s) from cardiac, capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerve fibers and/or terminals.", 
    "15": "We studied the effects of Ca channel blockers and 3 antiarrhythmic drugs on the digitalis-induced oscillatory afterpotential (OAP). The OAP was observed in Purkinje fibers stimulated by pulse trains, with cycle lengths ranging from 1,000 to 300 msec. The Ca channel blockers verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine (2.0 x 10(-6) M) depressed OAP significantly and abolished triggered activity. Verapamil was more effective than diltiazem. However, nicardipine and nitrendipine (2.0 x 10(-6) M) had no depressant effects on OAP or triggered activity. The antiarrhythmic drugs procainamide (1.0 x 10(-4) M), mexiletine (1.0 x 10(-5) M) and propranolol (1.0 x 10(-4) M) depressed both OAP and triggered activity. There were no significant differences in the depressant effects between the Ca2+ antagonists (except for nitrendipine and nicardipine) and the other antiarrhythmic drugs. The OAP coupling interval was prolonged by verapamil, diltiazem, propranolol, procainamide and mexiletine. Although the APD50 was shortened by verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine, it was prolonged by propranolol. It is concluded that nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem, procainamide, mexiletine and propranolol may be effective for digitalis-related arrhythmia.", 
    "16": "Systemic and coronary hemodynamic effects of acebutolol (10 mg i.v.), a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent were investigated in 11 patients with coronary artery disease and significant arterial obstructive lesions. Efficacy was assessed by simultaneous left and right heart catheterization and with an inlaying Webster thermodilution catheter in the coronary sinus. The data were compared with data from 7 other patients who received 2 mg i.v. of propranolol, a non-cardioselective beta-blocker. With acebutolol, (1) the heart rate was reduced significantly (p less than 0.001), (2) no significant changes were observed in the LVSP, LVEDP, mean PWP, LVmax dp/dt/p, LV negative dp/dt/p, CI, SWI and SPI, (3) CSF and MVO2 decreased significantly (p less than 0.01) 5 min after injection and (4) the CVR showed a significant elevation (p less than 0.05) after 5 min. With propranolol, (1) the heart rate decreased significantly (p less than 0.05), (2) there were no significant changes in LVSP and LVEDP, (3) the mean PWP increased significantly (p less than 0.05), (4) the LVmax dp/dt/p, CI and SWI decreased significantly (p less than 0.05), (5) the CSF and MVO2 decreased markedly (p less than 0.01) and (6) the CVR increased markedly (p less than 0.01). As compared to the effects of 2 mg i.v. of propranolol, those produced by acebutolol (10 mg i.v.) were characterized by a predominant negative chronotropic action with minimal negative inotropic action, combined with a reduction in CSF and MVO2. The findings suggest that the efficacy of acebutolol in pump failure caused by myocardial ischemia during effort angina is mediated by improvement of the myocardial oxygen demand-supply imbalance.", 
    "17": "Administration of beta-blocking agent propranolol (1 or 10 mg/kg) 30 and 60 min prior to immunization with sheep red blood cells enhanced the immune response in CBA mice. The activating effect of propranolol upon immunogenesis can be characterized as peripheral since it is preserved after removal of thymus. Beta-adrenergic mechanisms do not participate in immunomodulating action of serotoninergic and dopaminergic systems.", 
    "18": "Propranolol is known to have a depressant effect on anterograde atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction in normal subjects and in those with AV nodal reentrant tachycardia. Using His bundle recording and programmed ventricular stimulation, the effect of propranolol-induced beta-adrenergic blockade (1 mg/kg intravenously) on retrograde AV nodal conduction was studied in 17 patients without (group I) and nine with (group II) AV nodal reentrant tachycardia. During baseline studies the ventricular pacing cycle length that induced ventriculoatrial block was 338 +/- 60 ms (range 260 to 450 ms) in group I and 305 +/- 39 ms (range 260 to 375 ms) in group II patients (not significant). After injection of propranolol, the ventricular pacing cycle length that induced ventriculoatrial block in group I patients was 416 +/- 97 ms (range 300 to 550 ms) (P less than 0.001, compared to baseline state) in 15 patients, and complete block occurred in two patients. In group II patients ventriculoatrial block occurred at a ventricular pacing cycle length of 375 +/- 97 ms (range 260 to 510 ms) (P less than 0.02 compared to baseline value) in eight patients, and complete block occurred in one patient. Retrograde AV nodal conduction expressed as the H2A2 interval was 75 +/- 33 ms (range 35 to 150 ms) in group I and 49 +/- 16 ms (range 20 to 80 ms) in group II patients (P less than 0.05). Following the administration of propranolol, the H2A2 interval was prolonged in group I patients by 10 to 45 ms in 11 patients, no retrograde AV nodal conduction was observed in three patients, and there was no effect in two patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "Tissue oxygen pressure was measured in the pig heart during repeated coronary artery occlusions. ptO2 was measured with an array-multiwire-electrode across the border zone, i.e. the transition zone between normal and ischaemic myocardium. The LAD was occluded three times, each lasting 5 min and with 55 min of reperfusion between the occlusions. Three groups of animals were studied: Group 1 served as controls; Group 2 were given metoprolol 0.3 mg/kg i.v. after the first LAD occlusion; Group 3 were given isoprenaline in a continuous infusion, started after the first LAD occlusion and continued throughout the rest of the experiment. Heart rate differed as expected between the two treated groups. The pattern of ptO2 values across the border zone repeated itself for each animal. No change in the pattern of ptO2 values was seen in either treatment group. In conclusion, there were no indications that it was possible to change the ptO2 of the border zone in the pig heart either with metoprolol or isoprenaline in the doses used.", 
    "20": "The pathogenesis of the two main killers in hypertension, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, differs. Prevention of strokes, about a third of which result from haemorrhage, appears more immediately responsive to the level of blood pressure (BP). MI reflects the end stage of a slow underlying atheromatous process of the coronary arteries and lowering BP can, at best, hope only to slow this process and make less likely the eventual plaque rupture and resultant occlusive thrombosis and infarction. Practically all the randomised trials have confirmed that the treatment of all grades of hypertension, down to a treated diastolic BP level of perhaps about 95 mmHg, reduces the incidence of fatal and non-fatal stroke by about 40-50%, though only two classes of antihypertensive agent i.e. diuretics (+/- other agents) and beta-blockers (+/- diuretics), have actually demonstrated this benefit. It is possible, in the elderly, that excessive lowering of systolic BP (SBP) (to below about 140 mmHg) might increase the number of deaths from stroke. Blood lipid changes which constitute coronary risk factors in untreated hypertensive patients should not be regarded in the same light if beta-blocker induced. Animal data suggest that beta-blockers inhibit catecholamine induced cardiovascular damage and modify coronary atheroma formation in the presence of stress and/or high cholesterol diets (in spite of blood lipid changes). Evidence in the moderate to severely hypertensive man also suggests that in spite of beta-blocker induced increases in blood triglyceride levels the incidence of deaths from MI markedly decreases over a ten year period in those whose SBP is well controlled.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "In a double-blind randomised cross-over study atenolol 100 mg daily and matching placebo were given to 14 patients whose blood pressure (BP) was uncontrolled on a fixed dose of captopril and frusemide. Atenolol produced a further reduction in both supine (170/105 mmHg to 163/94 mmHg) and standing (171/114 mmHg to 160/96 mmHg) BP and a significant fall in pulse rate and plasma renin activity (PRA). This fall in BP showed a highly significant correlation with pre-treatment plasma renin levels. No adverse side effects were encountered during the study. Previous suggestions that beta-blockade had no additional hypotensive effect in patients receiving captopril were not substantiated. For patients whose BP was poorly controlled with captopril and a diuretic, a selective beta-blocker is suggested as a useful third line agent.", 
    "22": "Eighteen patients whose clinic blood pressure (BP) remained over 95 mmHg despite treatment with captopril 50 mg twice daily plus frusemide 40 mg twice daily were randomised in a crossover study to four weeks' treatment with once daily atenolol 100 mg, slow release propranolol 160 mg or placebo. The reduction in BP on atenolol was superior to that on both propranolol and placebo. The mean supine BP 24 hours post dosing were 177/110 mmHg (placebo), 173/109 mmHg (propranolol) and 164/100 mmHg (atenolol). The corresponding mean heart rates were 77 bpm (placebo), 63 bpm (propranolol) and 62 bpm (propranolol) and 62 bpm (atenolol). The difference in hypotensive efficacy between atenolol and propranolol is not readily explained but our study shows that atenolol has a clinically useful supplementary effect on BP. Refractory hypertension remains an important clinical problem and further studies are required to establish the optimum combination of drugs that should be used with captopril in order to achieve 'target' BP in patients with moderate to severe hypertension.", 
    "23": "Sotalol is a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, membrane stabilising actions and cardioselectivity. It lengthens repolarisation and the effective refractory period in all cardiac tissues independently of its antiadrenergic properties. Combining Class II and Class III antiarrhythmic properties, sotalol can be given either intravenously or orally and its pharmacokinetic properties permit long dosing (once or twice daily) intervals. Controlled and uncontrolled studies have established the efficacy of sotalol in mild-to-moderate essential hypertension and in angina of effort. Sotalol reduces anginal frequency and glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerin) consumption and increases exercise capacity during treadmill stress tests. In addition, although there is evidence that the drug reduces reinfarction rate in survivors of acute infarction, the data for reduction in sudden death rates in these patients are not as compelling as for other beta-blockers. However, comparative and additional long term studies are required before an accurate assessment of the use of sotalol in these disorders can be made. When used in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension sotalol is more effective than placebo and comparable to other beta-blockers in reducing elevated blood pressures. In addition, a synergistic antihypertensive response is achieved when sotalol is combined with hydrochlorothiazide. Still, additional well-controlled comparative studies are required before the value of sotalol relative to other drug treatment regimens in the management of hypertension can be made. In preliminary studies sotalol appeared effective in most forms of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias with its effects being similar to those of other beta-blockers. However, preliminary data indicate that sotalol is likely to be more effective than than conventional beta-blockers in converting atrial flutter and fibrillation to sinus rhythm and maintaining stability post-conversion. Sotalol also appears to be a promising agent in the control of ventricular arrhythmias. In suppressing premature ventricular contractions it is at least as effective as procainamide. In ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, intravenous sotalol (1.5 mg/kg), prevents reinduction by programmed electrical stimulation in 40 to 50% of cases if double stimuli are used. Both prevention of reinducible arrhythmia and the suppression of spontaneous arrhythmias on Holter recordings are predictive of a long term favourable clinical outcome. In patients with reduced ejection fractions, sotalol depresses ventricular function less than conventional beta-blockers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "24": "In summary, hypertensive blacks have an increased overall benefit of therapy in mild hypertension. They also exhibit an accentuated (supersensitive) response to monotherapy with diuretics or calcium channel blockers. They have a blunted response to most beta blocker monotherapy in usual doses, with the possible exceptions of labetalol and pindolol. They also have a blunted response to converting enzyme inhibitor monotherapy, but both beta blocker and converting enzyme responses are equal when diuretic is added.", 
    "25": "A double-blind parallel group study was conducted to examine the effects of oral labetalol, in doses from 100 to 800 mg BID, and propranolol, 40 to 320 mg, in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The doses of labetalol (n = 74) and propranolol (n = 79) were titrated weekly to achieve a sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of less than 90 mmHg or at least a 10-mmHg decrease from placebo baseline on two consecutive visits. A 2-month fixed-dose maintenance phase followed in which a diuretic could be added if the sitting DBP was greater than or equal to 100 mmHg on maximum doses of either drug. BP and heart rate were measured 8-12 hours after a dose in the sitting and standing positions. Labetalol was significantly more effective at the end of monotherapy than propranolol was in lowering both the sitting (p less than .05) and standing (p less than .04) DBP. The reduction in the systolic, although more pronounced for those on labetalol, was not significantly different; 53% of patients had a \"good\" response to labetalol compared with 30% of the propranolol group. Propranolol significantly (p less than 0.01) lowered heart rate compared with labetalol. Nine patients in the labetalol group and 10 in the propranolol group required a diuretic. The decrease in BP after the addition of a diuretic was comparable. Changes in plasma lipids were not significant, but HDL increased 9% with labetalol and decreased 2% with propranolol. Triglycerides increased 25% with labetalol and 31% with propranolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "Dilevalol is a stereoisomer of labetalol, with a unique combination of beta-adrenergic blocking effects and selective beta 2-agonist activity. The safety and efficacy of dilevalol in patients with systemic hypertension were evaluated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, patients with mild hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure of 95-105 mmHg) were randomized to receive either placebo (n = 14) or increasing doses of dilevalol (n = 15), 100-800 mg, once daily, to achieve normalization of pressure and/or a reduction of supine diastolic pressure of greater than or equal to 10 mmHg. This was followed by a 4-week maintenance phase. Compared with placebo, dilevalol, 200-800 mg/day, lowered supine and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressures significantly, while causing a modest reduction in heart rate. The drug was well tolerated without evidence of orthostasis. Dilevalol, in doses of 200-800 mg/day, is a safe and effective drug for the treatment of patients with mild hypertension.",

Autopsy findings revealed foreign material in the gastric content with an acute thrombosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Microscopic studies showed evidence of an extremely early infarct. Metoprolol concentrations in the blood, liver, gastric content, and urine are reported by both capillary gas chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometric analysis. A review of the literature confirmed that little information has been published concerning intoxication with this drug.", 
    "28": "1 In atrial preparations of the young guinea-pig (body weight 150-250 g), five proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, bacterial-Al-proteinase (nagarse), bromelain and kallikrein) produced concentration-dependent positive inotropic and chronotropic effects, while they exerted only minimal effects on the papillary muscle preparations. 2 To characterize the effects, further experiments were conducted in atrial preparations using trypsin. There was a strong tendency for tachyphylaxis: a second exposure to the same concentration of trypsin resulted in considerably smaller positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. The positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of this substance were not affected by propranolol (5 X 10(-7)M). However, an accumulation of cyclic AMP was observed and the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects were potentiated by aminophylline (10(-4)M) in association with an augmentation of the accumulation of cyclic AMP. In preparations partially depolarized with high K+ (22mM) medium (contractions ceased under this condition) trypsin 100 micrograms ml-1 reinstated the contraction. Treatment of the preparation with aprotinin (200 u ml-1) resulted in a strong inhibition of the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. 3 Islet activating protein (IAP), a specific inhibitor of the 'inhibition specific' guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein of the adenylate cyclase system, did not produce significant inhibition of the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of trypsin, whereas it produced a complete inhibition of the negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of carbachol. 4. These results suggest that the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects ofproteolytic enzymes are intimately connected with the proteolytic activities through which adenylate cyclase is activated to produce an accumulation of cyclic AMP within the myocardium. The destruction of the 'inhibition specific' guanine nucleotide regulatory protein of the adenylate cyclase was not substantiated as a mechanism of activation of the adenylate cyclase.", 
    "29": "Over the past 6 years, major hypertension intervention studies in Europe, Australia, and the USA have shown disappointing results in the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) in spite of adequate treatment and good compliance. Recently, it has become increasingly clear that hypertensives with or without treatment display higher cholesterol levels than normotensive persons. The present review examines cholesterol levels in six intervention studies, none of which offered dietary or drug therapy for hypercholesterolemic patients. The Oslo study and the British MRC Trial reported very high average cholesterol levels and both showed no protection from CHD through intensive therapy in comparison to control patients. The Australian and the American MRFIT studies produced evidence for reduced coronary mortality among hypertensives with low in contrast to those with high cholesterol levels. The European Working Party showed indirectly that patients with marked reduction in blood pressure and cholesterol had a significantly lower cardiac mortality compared to placebo-treated patients. The IPPPSH study found that increasing cholesterol levels in hypertensives under beta blocker or diuretic therapy increased the risk of myocardial infarction. Failure to reduce cholesterol in hypertensive patients apparently is a major reason for the limited efficacy of antihypertensive treatment in the reduction of CHD.", 
    "30": "Although the role played by the caudal ventrolateral medulla in the regulation of the cardiovascular system has been extensively investigated, little is known about the role played by this area in the regulation of airway caliber. Therefore, in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized dogs, we used both electrical and chemical means to stimulate the caudal ventrolateral medulla while we monitored changes in total lung resistance breath by breath. We found that electrical stimulation (25 microA) of 26 sites in this area significantly decreased total lung resistance from 7.1 +/- 0.4 to 5.7 +/- 0.3 cmH2O.1-1.s (P less than 0.001). The bronchodilation evoked by electrical stimulation was unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade but was abolished by cholinergic blockade. In addition, chemical stimulation of seven sites in the caudal ventrolateral medulla with microinjections of DL-homocysteic acid (0.2 M; 66 nl), which stimulates cell bodies but not fibers of passage, also decreased total lung resistance from 8.3 +/- 1.1 to 6.5 +/- 0.8 cmH2O.l-1.s (P less than 0.01). In contrast, microinjections of DL-homocysteic acid into the nucleus ambiguus (n = 6) increased total lung resistance from 7.5 +/- 0.5 to 9.2 +/- 0.4 cmH2O.l-1.s (P less than 0.05). We conclude that the caudal ventrolateral medulla contains a pool of cell bodies whose excitation causes bronchodilation by withdrawing cholinergic input to airway smooth muscle.", 
    "31": "Mitral valve prolapse is a common mitral valve disorder manifested clinically as a midsystolic click and/or a late systolic murmur (the click-murmur syndrome) and pathologically as billowing or prolapsing mitral leaflets (the floppy valve syndrome). Not only is it one of the two most common congenital heart diseases and the most common valve disorder diagnosed in the United States, but it is also prevalent throughout the world. Mitral valve prolapse may be associated with a variety of other conditions or diseases. Diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse should be made on clinical grounds and, if necessary, supported by echocardiography. The majority of patients with mitral valve prolapse suffer no serious sequelae. However, major complications such as disabling angina-like chest pains, progressive mitral regurgitation, infective endocarditis, thromboembolism, serious arrhythmias, and sudden death may occur. Unless these serious complications occur, most of the patients with mitral valve prolapse need no treatment other than reassurance, including those with atypical chest pain or palpitation unconfirmed by objective data. Therapy with a beta-blocker for disabling chest pain and/or arrhythmias and antiplatelet therapy for cerebral embolic events may be indicated. In occasional patients with significant mitral regurgitation surgery may be necessary.", 
    "32": "Sixty peripartum patients with diastolic blood pressures (BP) 110 mmHg or higher were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive repeated intravenous injections of either labetalol (20-80 mg) or hydralazine (5 mg) until the diastolic BP was below 100 mmHg. There were four treatment failures in the labetalol group (N = 40) and none in the hydralazine group (N = 20). Hydralazine lowered mean arterial pressure (MAP) more than did labetalol (33.3 +/- 13.2 versus 25.5 +/- 11.2 mmHg; mean +/- SD), but labetalol had a more rapid effect. There was considerable interpatient variability in the dose of labetalol required to control BP, which could not be predicted by any clinical characteristic before therapy. The duration of action also varied in the labetalol group, with the shortest duration occurring in those patients who required the highest dosage for BP control. No significant fetal or neonatal problems ascribable to drug treatment were noted in the 13 instances in which labetalol was given before delivery. However, fetal distress occurred in two of the six cases involving antenatal hydralazine. We conclude that labetalol appears to be a safe and effective alternative to hydralazine for treating hypertension in the peripartum period, but serious rare side effects have not yet been quantified.", 
    "33": "Multiple trials have suggested the use of digoxin, digoxin and propranolol, or timolol to prevent atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting. No trial has evaluated the efficacy of digoxin verus propranolol. Furthermore, the predictors of postoperative atrial fibrillation and the long-term consequence of atrial fibrillation that reverts to sinus rhythm have not been established. One hundred fifty patients were randomized to receive no drug, propranolol (20 mg every 6 hours), or digoxin (0.5 mg followed by 0.25 mg daily). Twenty-seven patients were excluded from data analysis. In the remaining 123 patients, no preoperative parameter (age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, electrocardiographic p wave morphology, or preoperative digoxin or propranolol therapy), intraoperative parameter (bypass time, aortic cross-clamp time, or number of vessels bypassed), or postoperative parameter (peak creatinine kinase, congestive heart failure, or pericarditis) by univariate or multivariate analysis predicted patients at risk for atrial fibrillation. Sustained atrial fibrillation developed in 37.5% of control and 32.6% of digoxin-treated patients. Only 16.2% of propranolol-treated patients had sustained atrial fibrillation (p less than 0.03). There were no in-hospital complications in those patients with atrial fibrillation. After 26 +/- 7 months follow-up, those patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation had no increased incidence of angina, cerebral vascular accident, myocardial infarction, or sudden death. Therefore, in this select population, propranolol prophylaxis is effective but discretionary.", 
    "34": "To establish a safe procedure for examining propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction, we have developed a new method for performing inhalation challenge with propranolol. Monitoring respiratory resistance during tidal breathing with continuous inhalation of propranolol in 1.5-fold increasing concentrations from 0.78 to 30 mg/ml for 1 minute at each concentration, we tested 43 subjects with stable asthma and 10 normal subjects. We also compared bronchial responsiveness with responsiveness to inhaled methacholine on separate days. In addition, to determine the role of vagal nerve activity in propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction, we studied the effect of atropine. Inhaled propranolol caused dose-related bronchoconstriction in all subjects with asthma but not in normal subjects. None of the subjects suffered severe asthmatic attack during the test, which was performed in 15 minutes or less. The minimum cumulative dose of methacholine and of propranolol, at the point where respiratory conductance began to decrease, was not significantly correlated. Increased respiratory resistance was reversed by atropine in 70% of the subjects with asthma with marked individual differences. These data suggest that, although in most subjects with asthma, vagal nerve activity contributes in varying degree to bronchoconstriction, other constricting factors may contribute in the remaining subjects. It is also suggested that the mechanism of bronchial response to propranolol differs from that of the nonspecific airway reactivity estimated by methacholine challenge.", 
    "35": "The efficacy and safety of propranolol in the treatment of anxiety was compared with those of chlordiazepoxide and placebo in a 3-week, double-blind study of 212 patients. After a 1-week, single-blind placebo-washout period, patients were randomized to receive either propranolol (80, 160, or 320 mg/day), chlordiazepoxide (30, 45, or 75 mg/day), or placebo. Patients were evaluated by three physician-rated scales--Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), Covi Anxiety Scale (CAS), and Clinical Global Impressions scale--and two patient-rated scales--Symptoms Checklist 90 and Profile of Mood States. Patients in all groups demonstrated significant improvement in their level of anxiety at all time points compared with their baseline level. At Week 1 propranolol and chlordiazepoxide patients were significantly better than placebo patients, as measured by the HAM-A and CAS. At Week 2 only propranolol was superior to placebo, based on HAM-A and CAS scores. Fifteen patients prematurely terminated because of adverse reactions (4 taking propranolol, 4 taking placebo, and 7 taking chlordiazepoxide). The incidence of side effects was similar for the two active drugs; fatigue, drowsiness, and change in libido were significantly more frequent with chlordiazepoxide and drowsiness and indigestion were more frequent with propranolol compared with placebo.", 
    "36": "This study was carried out to compare bronchial responses to inhaled propranolol (P) and methacholine (M) in a group of asthmatic subjects with mild to moderate bronchial hyperresponsiveness to M; to determine the short term reproducibility of bronchial response to propranolol; and to examine the shape of dose-response curve to P relative to that of M. Doses of M and P were given in mumoles and bronchial responses to both agents were expressed as the provocative dose that induced a 20 percent fall in FEV1 (PD20 FEV1). In 16 asthmatic patients, there was no correlation between the PD20 of the two agents. Mean PD20 M (+/- SD in log scale) was approximately nine times lower than mean PD20 P (0.64 +/- 0.96 and 5.80 +/- 1.65, respectively). This difference was statistically significant (t = 4.58, p less than 0.001). In six asthmatic patients, the reproducibility of PD20 P was similar to that of M (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.969 and 0.957, respectively). The shape of the dose-response curves to P was different from that of M in five of nine asthmatic patients when all experimental points were analyzed by double-reciprocal plot. We noticed that even small doses of inhaled P may cause a severe bronchoconstriction. Therefore, special caution should be taken to increase P doses very gradually, when studying the dose-response curve. We demonstrated that P inhalation induced a measurable bronchoconstriction in subjects with mild to moderate hyperresponsiveness and it was reproducible. However, the bronchial sensitivity to P was lower than to M. Our findings suggest that P and M have different mechanisms of action.", 
    "37": "This investigation was undertaken to study the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade with timolol on infarct size and on the incidence of late ventricular tachycardia in patients with acute myocardial infarction of less than 6 hr of evolution. Patients were assigned randomly either to a placebo-treated group (98 patients) or to a timolol-treated group (102 patients). The patients were treated with 5.5 mg iv timolol (or matched placebo) as a bolus divided into four doses during the first 2 hr followed by 10 mg orally twice daily for 1 month. Cumulative total creatine kinase (CK) release, which reflects the amount of myocardial necrosis was 1677 +/- 132 IU/liter in the placebo group (n = 83) and 1274 +/- 73 IU/liter in the timolol group (n = 81, p less than .01), a 24% reduction. Cumulative release of CK-MB was 138 +/- 8 IU/liter in the placebo group and 106 +/- 8 IU/liter in the timolol group (p less than .01), a 23% reduction. Twenty-four hour Holter electrocardiograms were obtained on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 after the onset of the acute myocardial infarction in 80 patients in the placebo group and 82 patients in the timolol group. The incidence of ventricular tachycardia was lower in the timolol than in the placebo group (7 vs 16 patients, p = .05). We conclude that early administration of intravenous timolol followed by oral treatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction reduces infarct size as assessed by CK and CK-MB serum activity, and decreases the occurrence of late ventricular tachycardia.", 
    "38": "The finding of a first-degree atrioventricular block suggests various mechanisms of atrioventricular (AV) node alteration: organic lesion, or functional disorder related to the autonomic nervous system, or a combination of both. The influence of the autonomic nervous system was evaluated by administration of Jose's regimen, i.e. intravenous injection of propranolol 0.2 mg/kg bodyweight and atropine 0.04 mg/kg bodyweight. This regimen was tested in 101 patients divided into two groups: 38 subjects with normal sinus node and AV node acting as controls, and 63 patients with abnormal AV node. In the control group the autonomic nervous system had no influence on atrio-hisian (AH) conduction time or on the effective refractory period of the AV node under an imposed cycle of 600 ms. Wenckebach's period significantly (p less than 0.01) increased from 352 +/- 40 ms to 376 +/- 47 ms. Parasympathetic activity was found to predominate in the sinus node. In the group with pathological AV node three types of response were observed after pharmacological inhibition of the autonomic nervous system: (a) improvement or even complete normalization (40%) of AV node conduction ability (AH, Wenckebach's period) suggesting vagal hyperactivity, as also found in the sinus node; (b) changes similar to those observed in the control group and reflecting the same behaviour of the autonomic nervous system, and (c) increase in AH conduction abnormalities reflecting the presence of a sympathetic overdrive tending to minimize the consequences of an atrioventricular organic lesion. This sympathetic overdrive was also found to be present in the sinus node.", 
    "39": "The object of this study was to determine suitable experimental conditions for the pharmacological evaluation of cardiac alpha-adrenoceptors. Atrial and ventricular preparations of the guinea pig and rat were employed, and the alpha-adrenoceptor responsiveness was compared with the binding of the alpha-adrenoceptor radioligand [3H]prazosin in membranes prepared from these cardiac regions. The experimental variables examined were the pacing frequency, bath temperature, choice of agonist, and cardiac region. In guinea pig atria the optimum alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated positive inotropic response to phenylephrine was at 32 degrees C and a pacing frequency of 1 Hz. A comparison of phenylephrine with methoxamine showed that the former yielded biphasic concentration-response curves in guinea pig left atria; the lower portion was alpha-adrenoceptor mediated and the upper, more substantial portion, was beta mediated. Methoxamine produced monophasic curves due entirely to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation and was therefore used for comparisons between rat and guinea pig tissues. Of the guinea pig tissues, only the left atrium produced positive inotropic responses. Negative chronotropy was obtained with right atria and negative inotropy with ventricular strips and papillary muscles. The rat tissues all responded with positive responses, the largest maximum being in the left atrium. Binding data showed a larger number of alpha-adrenoceptors in the rat tissues, of which the ventricles had the greatest number. The lack of response of guinea pig ventricular tissues was therefore reflected in the low binding. From this study, the most appropriate model for characterizing cardiac alpha-adrenoceptors is therefore the rat left atria at 32 degrees C and paced at 1 Hz with methoxamine as the agonist.", 
    "40": "Catecholamines may stimulate ACTH secretion during stress. To investigate the nature and site of such an action, plasma ACTH was measured in four groups of unanesthetized adult female rats with an indwelling carotid cannula. Sequential 300-microliter blood samples were taken 60 min, 30 min, and immediately before an intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of 2.5 microliter adrenaline or noradrenaline and 5, 15, 45, 60, and 120 min after the infusion. The four groups were: 1) intact rats; 2) rats infused 7 days after undergoing a discrete bilateral lesion of the ventral noradrenergic ascending bundle caused by 6-hydroxydopamine, which depleted their hypothalamic adrenaline and noradrenaline levels by 90% and 80%, respectively; 3) rats infused 30 min after pretreatment via the icv route with either prazosin or propranolol; and 4) rats infused 16 and 2 h after two successive intracarotid injections of an anti-rCRH-41 serum. In another group, the effects of icv catecholamine administration were compared with those of an intracerebral (ic) microinfusion close to a single paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Finally, in two additional groups blood was sampled at the above-mentioned times before and after a 2-min ether inhalation by intact rats or prazosin- and/or propranolol-pretreated rats. In the intact rats (group 1), a stress-like stimulatory dose response was noted after both adrenaline and noradrenaline infusions, with a half-maximal effect at concentrations of about 0.6 nmol and a maximal effect at 2.7 nmol or more. At maximally effective doses, adrenaline was significantly more active than noradrenaline. In the rats with ventral noradrenergic ascending bundle lesions (group 2), 2.7 nM adrenaline or noradrenaline stimulated ACTH release as in the controls without lesions. In group 3, prazosin blocked the ACTH responses to both adrenaline and noradrenaline, whereas propranolol only blocked the response to adrenaline. In group 4, i.e. rats pretreated with an anti-rCRH-41 serum, the amplitude of the ACTH surge after icv adrenaline or noradrenaline infusion was halved. A unilateral ic catecholamine microinfusion next to the PVN (half the icv dose given in group 1) led to a rapid ACTH release that peaked at half the response measured in the icv infused rats. Ether stress-induced ACTH release was decreased by 50-60% after icv pretreatment with 1 or 10 micrograms prazosin, 1 or 6.5 micrograms propranolol, or a combined dose comprising 1 microgram of both. The following conclusions were reached.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "41": "An open comparative trial studied the action of celiprolol and metoprolol (oral) on hemodynamic parameters during parenteral long-term tocolysis with 0.1 microgram/min of hexoprenaline. The observation period covered the critical first phase of tocolysis of 48 hours. No statistically significant difference was found between the two treatment groups, but metoprolol showed a more beneficial influence on the undesirable hemodynamic effects of the tocolysis, as fall of the blood pressure and increase of the heart rate. The ISA and an additional vasodilative effect together with the beta 1-selectivity of celiprolol are supposed to be the cause for this statistically not significant difference. We think that beta-blockers with a clinically relevant ISA are less suitable for the antagonization of the cardiovascular effects of the beta 2-stimulation than such without an intrinsic activity.", 
    "42": "The present investigation was conducted to study systemic and regional haemodynamic effects of nicorandil, a potent coronary vasodilator, after intravenous or local intracoronary administration in anaesthetized or conscious pigs. Intravenous infusions of nicorandil for 10 min in both anaesthetized (15, 30, 75 and 150 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and conscious (20, 40 and 80 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) pigs reduced arterial blood pressure, stroke volume, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and systemic vascular resistance, but increased heart rate and maxLVdP/dt. Since nicorandil decreased LVEDP at doses which did not affect arterial blood pressure, the drug may be considered as a more potent venodilator than arterial dilator. Nicorandil increased cardiac output only in conscious animals due to a more marked tachycardia (85% after 80 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) than in anaesthetized animals (30% after 75 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). The nicorandil-induced increase in heart rate and maxLVdP/dt, being substantially attenuated in conscious pigs after treatment with propranolol, can be ascribed to a reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system following the fall in arterial pressure. Although cardiac output did not change in anaesthetized animals, intravenous infusions of nicorandil did cause a redistribution of blood flow in favour of organs such as the heart, adrenals, spleen, small intestine and brain at the expense of that to the stomach and kidneys; hepatic artery and skeletal muscle blood flow did not change. The increase in myocardial blood flow, primarily to the subepicardial layers, was associated with an enhancement in coronary venous oxygen content and was also notices after intracoronary infusions of nicorandil (0.6, 1.5, 3 and 6 micrograms.kg-1.min-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "Nifedipine slow release tablets were substituted for minoxidil in the treatment of 13 patients with hypertension refractory to conventional therapy. In 12 patients substitution was associated with continuing control of blood pressure (BP), although 11 required maximum dose of 120 mg daily and one 80 mg daily. BP control remained satisfactory in nine patients for at least one year after substitution and in all, loop diuretics previously required with minoxidil to control fluid retention, were discontinued. Three patients (23%) however had to be withdrawn because of side effects; one within days of starting therapy and two after three months: one patient died after sustaining myocardial infarction. There was no evidence of deterioration in renal function in those patients continuing on nifedipine. This drug in combination with other antihypertensive agents provides an alternative approach to the management of patients with refractory hypertension, avoiding the severe side effects of the potent vasodilators.", 
    "44": "A group of 175 patients have attended for four years a microcomputer based, nurse practitioner managed clinic for the long term care of hypertension. Improvement in blood pressure (BP) control was seen initially and has been maintained. Drug treatment has been with a beta blocker followed if necessary by a diuretic and/or a vasodilator. Despite individual dietary and 'stop smoking' advice, there was no marked change in body weight while only males reduced smoking. A significant increase in non fasting serum cholesterol (6.4 +/- 1.3 to 6.6 +/- 1.3 mmol/l) and glucose (5.5 +/- to 6.1 +/- 2.5 mmol/l) was seen overall, but was restricted to those patients taking a thiazide diuretic (with or without other drugs). These findings indicate the need for a more systematic collection of information on effects of long term treatment and for the development of better strategies for improving lifestyle.",

    "46": "Open-angle glaucoma is a non-curable, blinding disease which has its best prognosis when management begins at its earliest onset. Recent studies, such as those demonstrating axonal loss before functional or physical changes occur, will have an effect on the current standard of management. This includes indications for initiating treatment as well as what constitutes controlled intraocular pressure. Pharmacological management is often difficult due to drug tolerance and compliance problems. Some types of secondary open angle glaucomas respond very poorly to treatment. Hence, an accurate diagnosis is imperative to proper management. Principles underlying pharmacological management are discussed. When pharmacological management fails, laser and/or surgical intervention is required to prevent further vision loss.", 
    "47": "1. (-)[125I]-Cyanopindolol (CYP) binding to non-beta-adrenoceptor sites in dog kidney was characterized in homogenate preparations and their distribution in sections determined using autoradiography. 2. In homogenate studies, (-)[125I]-CYP bound to a single population of non-interacting sites (Bmax = 5.45, s.e.m. = 1.00 fmol/mg wet weight; nH = 0.99, s.e.m. = 0.01) with high affinity (KD = 3.84, s.e.m. = 0.76 nmol/l, n = 40. 3. In competition studies, compounds selective for alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, muscarinic cholinoceptors and receptors for 5-HT, histamine and benzodiazepines, calcium channel antagonists, catecholamine uptake inhibitors, MAO inhibitors and adrenergic neurone blockers were ineffective at concentrations of 10 mumol/l. 4. Compounds selective for dopamine D1-receptors (fluphenazine, SCH 23390 and SK & F 82526) and D2-receptors (pimozide, domperidone, spiperone, haloperidol, sulpiride, cis- and trans-flupenthixol) competed with similar affinities (5-25 mumol/l) for (-)[125I]-CYP binding. 5. In autoradiographic studies, (-)[125I]-CYP binding to non-beta-adrenoceptor sites was localized over glomeruli, juxtaglomerular apparatus, distal tubules, blood vessels and medullary rays and tubules. 6. It is concluded that in dog kidney, (-)[125I]-CYP binds to a site closely associated with dopamine receptors.", 
    "48": "Modes of action of befunolol and its derivatives were tested in guinea pig isolated taenia caecum. The pA2-values of BFE-60 (befunolol), -61 and -69 against isoprenaline, which measures interactions with the high affinity sites on beta-adrenoceptors, were significantly larger than their pD2-values, which were equal to their pA2-values against carteolol. Carteolol is a beta-adrenergic partial agonist with higher intrinsic activity, to which the response results from interaction with low affinity sites. These results suggest that BFE-60, -61 and -69 discriminate the high and low affinity sites on beta-adrenoceptors. The pA2-values of BFE-37, -41, -47 and -72 against isoprenaline were, however, equal to their pD2-values and pA2-values against carteolol. These drugs seem to have little or no ability to discriminate between the high and low affinity sites. BFE-55 antagonized isoprenaline but not carteolol suggesting that BFE-55 interacted with only the high affinity sites.", 
    "49": "The affinity (pA2 or pKB) values of 3 different beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs were determined using the isolated guinea-pig tracheal chain preparation. The pA2 values for each of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs were determined, using respectively isoprenaline and salbutamol as agonists. Neuronal and extraneuronal uptake of agonist were blocked with phenoxybenzamine. With isoprenaline, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, the pA2 values for the blocking drugs were unacceptable. Using the beta 2-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, salbutamol, under the same conditions, resulted in consistent pA2 values for the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug propranolol and some concentrations of the beta 2-selective blocking drug ICI 118.551. pA2 Values for the beta1-selective antagonist atenolol were not consistent for the concentrations used. It is suggested that this is due to the guinea-pig trachea having a mixed beta-adrenoceptor population. A mathematical model is presented that shows the influence of a mixed receptor subpopulation on the shift of theoretical agonist concentration-effect curves in the presence of a competitive antagonist. It can be shown that the affinity values of antagonists for a specific receptor subtype are to a greater or lesser degree unreliable, depending upon the selectivity-ratios of both the agonist and the antagonist used.", 
    "50": "The mode of action of Mg2+ on vascular smooth muscle has been examined in isolated feline coronary and femoral arterial segments using a sensitive in vitro method. Potassium (124 mM) was added to feline coronary and femoral arteries incubated in a calcium-free buffer solution containing 10 microM EGTA, and magnesium in various concentrations (1.2, 4.4 or 13.2 mM). Potassium induced during these conditions a small contraction whose magnitude was attenuated by raised concentrations of Mg2+ (4.4 and 13.2 mM). Subsequent cumulative addition of calcium (10(-6)-3 x 10(-3) M) resulted in concentration-dependent contractions. The magnitude of these contractions was magnesium-dependent; the contraction elicited was depressed and a dextral shift of the extracellular calcium concentration-response relation was noted in the presence of increased concentrations of Mg2+ (4.4 and 13.2 mM). In separate experiments performed on potassium-depolarized (124 mM) feline coronary arteries it was noted that magnesium-induced relaxation was not changed by the presence of propranolol (10(-6) M), cimetidine (10(-6) M) or atropine (10(-5) M). In addition, the mechanical removal of the endothelium did not affect the dilator effect of Mg2+, as examined in potassium-depolarized (124 mM) feline femoral arteries. Hence, it may be concluded that Mg2+ may interfere with the passage of extracellular calcium through the sarcolemma, and that the dilator effect of magnesium is not the result of a direct action on beta-adrenoceptors, histamine H2 or cholinergic receptors, or requires the presence of an intact endothelium.", 
    "51": "Molsidomine, a predominantly venous vasodilator, has been coronary disease. The basic mechanism of its anti-anginal effect is a reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption due to a fall in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure resulting from the vasodilator action of the drug. To this may be added direct dilatation of the main coronary vessels on the surface of the heart, which may account for part in its therapeutic effects in unstable and vasospastic angina. The effectiveness of molsidomine has been evaluated by controlled drug versus placebo or drug versus reference anti-anginal drug studies in 3 types of angina pectoris: exertion, unstable and vasospastic. The usefulness of the drug has also been established in acute and chronic left ventricular failure of ischaemic origin. Because of its high bioavailability when administered orally, molsidomine shows little inter-individual variations in its pharmacodynamic effects. Unlike nitrates, it can be administered for long period without gradual loss of activity with time. Finally, on several experimental models molsidomine has been shown to exert an antiplatelet effect, but the therapeutic implications of this finding have yet to be evaluated.", 
    "52": "We retrospectively reviewed charts of asthmatics who have coexistent cardiac disease. Twenty-nine patients with a mean age of 64.6 received 621 injections of epinephrine for acute asthma. Clinical improvement in asthma was noted and only three patients experienced a total of five (0.8%) adverse reactions temporally related to the administration of epinephrine. Twelve asthmatic patients were treated with beta adrenergic receptor blockers for a coexistent cardiac disease. In general, these patients tolerated the beta-blocker without a significant deterioration in respiratory function. Epinephrine and beta-blockers may be used safely in some asthmatics with heart disease when the medication is indicated and cautiously administered.", 
    "53": "Pharmacological properties of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors of embryonic chick (16-18 day in ovo), hatched chick (3-5 days after hatching) and adult chicken (20 weeks after hatching) were investigated. Pharmacological analysis using subtype specific agonists and antagonists showed that cardiac beta-adrenoceptors of embryonic chick and hatched chick could not be classified as beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptors. Scatchard analysis of specific [125I]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding revealed ICYP bound to two different population of binding sites (high and low affinity) in all stages; Kd and Bmax of these sites remained unchanged before and after hatching, although Bmax but not Kd was found to increase in adult chicken. Displacement of ICYP with propranolol (a nonspecific beta-antagonist), ICI 118,551 (a specific beta 2-antagonist) and atenolol (a specific beta 1-antagonist) indicated the presence of two affinity binding sites for all of the antagonists. Ki values for these antagonists at the high affinity binding sites were almost identical to pA2 values obtained from their antagonistic effects on isoproterenol inotropic response, suggesting that the high affinity binding sites for ICYP bear the pharmacological significance. Significant increase in sensitivity to the inotropic effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists was observed in the hatched chick heart, whereas Ki values calculated from displacement of ICYP with these agonists in the presence of GppNHp were not changed. Dobutamine which was a Partial agonist in the embryonic chick heart, was found to behave as a full agonist in the hatched chick heart. These result suggested that chicken cardiac beta-adrenoceptors show different properties from either beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptors reported in mammalian hearts, and coupling between binding and adenylate cyclase might be more efficient after hatching.", 
    "54": "Effects of beta-adrenoblocker obsidan and selective beta-adrenoblocker cordanum on metabolism of fatty acids in the rat myocardium were studied. Obsidan increased the concentration of triglycerides and decreased that of nonesterified fatty acids in the myocardial tissue, reduced the amounts of ketone bodies, beta-oxybutyrate and acetoacetate, accelerated oxidation of fatty acids by myocardial mitochondria. Cordanum produced no changes in beta-oxybutyrate concentration, decreased the concentrations of acetoacetate, induced accumulation of triglycerides. The drug reduced respiration control at the expense of an increase in controlled respiration rate. Thus, in contrast to total beta-adrenergic blockade induced by obsidan, cardioselective beta-adrenergic blockade by cordanum results in a decrease of myocardial oxygen consumption and a reduction of respiration controlled respiration rate.", 
    "55": "A new technique was developed to characterize the binding of a hydrophilic beta-adrenergic antagonist, [3H]CGP-12177, to 1-mm thick slices of canine cardiac tissue. This technique was used to quantify the density (Bmax) and the affinity (Kd) of these receptors in the right ventricular conus (RVC) and the left ventricle (LV) at day 1 to 6 weeks of age, and in the adult. Binding was found to be reversible, saturable, stereospecific, of high affinity, and thermolabile. There was an increase in the density of beta-adrenergic receptors between day 1 (Bmax = 2.2 +/- 0.3 fmol/mg tissue in RVC and 2.9 +/- 0.8 fmol/mg tissue in the LV) and 2 weeks of age postnatally, after which it remained constant until 6 weeks of age (Bmax = 7.5 +/- 0.4 and 6.8 +/- 0.9 fmol/mg tissue in RVC and LV, respectively); however, by 6 weeks of age it had not reached adult levels (10.3 +/- 1.0 fmol/mg tissue). The affinity of these receptors did not change between early neonatal life (Kd = 1.3 +/- 0.4 nM) and adulthood (Kd = 1.4 +/- 0.2 nM). The density of beta-adrenergic receptors in the RVC was similar to that in the LV. This new method of quantifying beta-adrenergic receptors in cardiac tissue is simple and fast, and requires minimal tissue handling. It proved to be useful in studying the development of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors with age.", 
    "56": "Antagonism of reserpine-induced hypothermia is an animal model used in the screening of antidepressants. The activity of imipramine on this test is partly impaired by propranolol. This effect of imipramine was analyzed using specific adrenoceptor and 5-HT receptor blocking drugs in order to determine the nature of this effect of propranolol. The non-selective beta 1-beta 2 adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol as the specific beta 1 adrenoceptor antagonist betaxolol, but not the specific beta 2 blocking drug DL-erythro-3-isopropylamino-1-(7-methyl-4-indanyloxy)-2-butanol hydrochloride 313.9 (ICI 118,551), partly antagonized the effect of imipramine at 30 min. None of the serotonin (5-HT) receptor antagonists, methysergide, metergoline, ritanserin and buspirone, impaired the effect of imipramine. On the contrary, methysergide alone antagonized reserpine-induced hypothermia and methysergide or metergoline increased the action of imipramine. Propranolol impaired neither the hypothermia induced by an agonist at the 5-HT 1A receptors: 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) nor the increase in spontaneous motor activity induced by an agonist at the 5-HT 1B receptors: 5-methoxy-3(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)1-H indole (Ru 24,969). It is concluded that the effect of propranolol is not the result of a blockade of 5-HT 1A, 5-HT 1B or 5-HT 2, but is in part due to blockade of beta 1 adrenoceptors.", 
    "57": "The study communicated here was designed to evaluate the absence of pulmonary beta-blockade as detected by a histamine provocation in betaxolol-treated patients suffering from open-angle glaucoma and coexisting obstructive airway disease. The study was a randomized, double-masked crossover trial, comparing betaxolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution and placebo. Ten patients (4 male, 6 female) were eligible by demonstrating baseline off-therapy IOP values exceeding 22 mmHg and a FEV1 value that was reduced by 15% to 20% following histamine provocation. After an appropriate washout period, baseline IOP and pulmonary function (FEV1, FVC) were tested. One drop of test medication (betaxolol or placebo) was instilled in both eyes; tonometry and a pulmonary function test were performed 90 minutes later. The patients then underwent a histamine provocation test. The concentration of histamine necessary to reduce FEV1 and FVC by 15% to 20% was recorded. The IOP was significantly reduced in patients treated with betaxolol, but not in those given placebo. FEV1 and FVC values 90 minutes after treatment with betaxolol or placebo were not significantly different from baseline values. After histamine provocation the FEV1 was, as expected, significantly decreased from baseline (15% to 20%) in both treatment groups. There was no statistical difference in the histamine concentration necessary to reduce the FEV1 by 15% to 20% between placebo (5.60 mg/ml) and betaxolol (5.25 mg/ml) treatments. This demonstrates that betaxolol has no pulmonary beta-blocking effect. Our study suggests that ophthalmic treatment with betaxolol in patients with glaucoma and obstructive airway disease enhances pulmonary safety due to the beta-1 cardioselective action of the drug.", 
    "58": "The activities of the (-)- and (+)-forms of m- and p-octopamine and m- and p-synephrine on beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig atria and trachea have been compared with that of noradrenaline. The rank order of potency of the (-)-forms on beta 1-adrenoceptors was noradrenaline greater than m-synephrine greater than m-octopamine = p-octopamine greater than p-synephrine. m-Synephrine was 100-fold, m- and p-octopamine about 6000-fold, and p-synephrine about 40,000-fold less active than noradrenaline. The (+)-forms were 1-2 orders of magnitude less active than their (-)-counterparts. The four (-)-compounds were more than four orders of magnitude less active than noradrenaline on beta 2-adrenoceptors, and the (+)-forms had no detectable activity in concentrations as high as 10(-4) M. If m- and p-octopamine are co-released with noradrenaline in amounts proportional to their concentration, their activities at these structures are too low to be physiologically significant.", 
    "59": "Social phobia is a potentially serious anxiety disorder that has attracted research interest in the U.S.A. very recently. Patients with social phobia suffer severe anxiety only in the context of social situations. Men are more likely to be afflicted than women. Alcohol and drug abuse are frequent complications. Two classes of medication are promising in treating this condition--beta-adrenergic receptor blockers and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Data supporting the use of these drugs are reviewed and recommendations for pharmacologic management of social phobics are outlined.", 
    "60": "Studies evaluating the antianxiety and antipanic properties of beta-blockers do not support their routine use in treating either generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder. The use of propranolol for anxiety disorders accompanied by physical symptoms, especially cardiovascular complaints, may be effective in some patients when combined with benzodiazepines or perhaps in some non-responders to conventional treatment. Better designed studies are needed to evaluate the exact role of beta-blocking agents in treating anxiety. The efficacy of propranolol in patients with panic disorder has not been widely researched, but preliminary results have not been encouraging. Propranolol may provide symptomatic relief in some patients with residual somatic complaints (i.e., palpitations and tachycardia), when combined with the patient's ongoing drug regimen. Because beta-blockers may induce depression, they should be used cautiously--if at all--in panic patients with concurrent depressive illness.", 
    "61": "The effects of four beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents on platelet aggregation, formation of thromboxane from exogenous arachidonic acid (AA) in platelets, on AA incorporation in platelet phospholipids, and on platelet phospholipase activity were studied. Of the four drugs pindolol inhibited thromboxane formation in a dose-related (0.25-1.0 mM) manner apparently by exerting its influence at the cyclooxygenase (CO) level. This drug also inhibited aggregation induced by AA, collagen, epinephrine and ADP. Atenolol and metoprolol though not showing inhibition of AA-induced aggregation did inhibit collagen- and ADP-induced aggregation; metoprolol reversed ADP-induced aggregation, and abolished second phase of epinephrine-induced aggregation. Timolol did not inhibit aggregation induced by all the aggregating agents. Atenolol inhibited (by ca. 10%) TxB2 formation in platelets from exogenous as well as endogenous AA at rather high concentrations (1.0 mM). Metoprolol and timolol did not do so. The observations reported here can be best explained by taking into account the membrane stabilizing effects and lipophilic properties of the drugs.", 
    "62": "Aside from the retrospective analysis of Clark and Troop (1), no large-scale controlled study has been designed specifically to assess the advantages and disadvantages of fixed-dose antihypertensive combinations. The use of fixed-dose antihypertensive combinations is no longer the anathema of the academician. The principal advantages of fixed-ratio combinations are simplicity of use, potentiation of blood-pressure-lowering efficacy, and potential counterbalancing of certain side effects. An additional advantage might be improvement in broad-based cost effectiveness, that is, a potential reduction in the need for frequent laboratory surveillance and in the frequency of office visits. The principal disadvantage is the relative inflexibility of dosage adjustment. Antihypertensive therapy should be initiated with a single drug preparation, with subsequent substitution of a combination product when appropriate. Tables 4 and 5 summarize, respectively, some of the important factors to consider and the theoretical requirements when contemplating the use of fixed-dose antihypertensive combinations. Diuretic/beta-blocker combinations are particularly attractive because of the enormous long-term experience with each component, their proven efficacy and additional salutary effects, their generally acceptable and sometimes offsetting side effects, and their potential for once-a-day dosing. It seems likely that CEI/diuretic and perhaps calcium-channel blocker/diuretic combinations also have great merit.", 
    "63": "Epidemiologic and experimental data are reviewed to determine whether treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents ('beta blockers') is likely to be antiatherogenic. Both indirect and direct evidence are considered. Indirect evidence is derived from studies of the effects of beta blockers on the risk factors for atherosclerosis, or on the disease sequelae of atherosclerosis. Direct evidence refers to studies in which atherosclerosis is an endpoint. Regarding indirect evidence, the data generally are consistent with a retarding or neutral effect of beta blockers on atherosclerosis. For example stroke incidence is reduced when hypertension is treated with beta blockers. About half of these same studies also show a reduction in the incidence of myocardial infarction, a complication that may be more closely related to atherosclerosis extent and severity than is stroke, which can have a nonatherosclerosis origin. The most important potential negative effect of beta blockers occurs with respect to serum lipid concentrations. However, there is no evidence that atherosclerosis is worsened as a result of pharmacologically induced alterations of serum lipids. The direct evidence more clearly indicates a retarding effect of beta blockers on atherosclerosis, with 11 of 13 studies having outcomes in this direction. However, interpretation of these studies is complicated by the fact that all of the data are derived from animal models, some of which are not similar to human beings in the development of atherosclerosis. Also, the studies are diverse, not only in the research designs and species utilized, but also in the type of beta blocker employed, the degree of beta blockade achieved, and the anatomic location of lesions. In summary, the data suggest that treatment with beta blockers may retard atherosclerosis. A more definitive answer requires efforts in two directions: (a) studies on atherosclerosis in selected populations of human beings, using cineangiography or autopsy material; and (b) additional, well-controlled studies in appropriate animal models.", 
    "64": "1. The effects of atenolol (100 mg), a beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker, and bevantolol (200 mg) were compared on heart rate, blood pressure, lung function and on the peripheral circulation in normal volunteers before and after isoprenaline infusion. Recordings were obtained 2 and 24 h following a single dose and 24 h after continuous dosage for 7 days. 2. The effect of atenolol on the blockade of beta-adrenergic stimuli, as measured by the ability to reduce isoprenaline-induced tachycardia, was greater than that of bevantolol. Though both drugs achieved a similar reduction in systolic pressure there was a significantly greater reduction in diastolic pressure with bevantolol. The lung function tests gave similar results to those with other beta-adrenoceptor blockers. 3. Atenolol produced a fall in peripheral blood flow consistent with unopposed peripheral alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation. The effect of bevantolol differs from that of atenolol, an initial fall in peripheral blood flow being followed by a rapid recovery to baseline or greater. This effect may be due to partial alpha-adrenoceptor agonist activity.", 
    "65": "ICI 147,798 is a novel compound which has both diuretic and beta adrenoceptor blocking properties in a single molecule. The natriuretic activity at 30 mg/kg p.o. was about 65% of the hydrochlorothiazide value at 10 mg/kg p.o. in saline-loaded rats; the corresponding kaliuretic activity was 42%. The natriuretic and the kaliuretic activity of ICI 147,798 in dogs were similar to that of hydrochlorothiazide over the doses 1 to 20 mg/kg p.o., although significantly less kaliuresis was obtained with ICI 147,798 at 1 mg/kg p.o. In the toad bladder preparation (analogous to the distal mammalian nephron), ICI 147,798 inhibited Na+ transport with mucosal and serosal IC50 values of 56 and 120 microM, respectively. ICI 147,798 inhibited isoproterenol-induced tachycardia in rats, cats, guinea pigs and dogs; these effects were associated with antagonism of isoproterenol vasodepressor responses. The pKB values of ICI 147,798 were 9.1 and 8.8 in isolated right atria and trachea of guinea pigs, respectively. ICI 147,798 did not exhibit local anesthetic activity in rabbit cornea and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity in catecholamine-depleted dogs and rats. Duration of beta blockade after a p.o. dose of 1 mg/kg in dogs followed the sequence: nadolol greater than ICI 147,798 greater than atenolol greater than timolol greater than propranolol. It is concluded that ICI 147,798 is a novel diuretic agent with nonselective beta blockade, and it appears to have the potential of a direct tubular action.", 
    "66": "The pharmacological effects of xamoterol, a beta adrenoceptor antagonist with partial agonistic activity, were examined in guinea pig cardiac preparations and compared with those of isoproterenol to assess possible mechanisms of its cardiac stimulant actions. Xamoterol produced a positive inotropic effect in the papillary muscles and a positive chronotropic effect in the spontaneously beating right atria in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximum inotropic and chronotropic effects of xamoterol were about 33 and 35% of those of isoproterenol, respectively. Although xamoterol failed to produce a consistent increase in contractile force in the left atria, the positive inotropic effect of the agent was observed clearly in preparations obtained from reserpine-pretreated animals. The positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of xamoterol were antagonized by atenolol, but not by ICI 118,551. On the other hand, xamoterol antagonized competitively the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses to isoproterenol. In papillary muscles the increases in contractile force induced by xamoterol and isoproterenol were depressed markedly in the presence of carbachol or adenosine. In all of left atria, right atria and papillary muscles obtained from reserpine-pretreated animals, xamoterol caused a significant elevation in cyclic AMP levels, while inhibiting the isoproterenol-induced increase in cyclic AMP levels. Computer-assisted analysis of concentration-response curves for the inhibition by xamoterol of the binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol in the membranes from guinea pig ventricles showed the existence of the 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate sensitive, highly affinity site of beta adrenoceptors for xamoterol, suggesting that xamoterol may induce the formation of a ternary complex with the beta adrenoceptor and a stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "The partial beta adrenoceptor agonist properties of cicloprolol, xamoterol and pindolol have been compared in vivo (anesthetized catecholamine-depleted or pithed rats) and in vitro (guinea pig or rat right atria and guinea pig tracheal muscle preparations) conditions. All three compounds increased heart rate in the former preparations, and their intrinsic activities relative to isoproterenol were 0.7, 0.65 and 0.45, respectively. The positive chronotropic effects of cicloprolol or xamoterol were competitively antagonized by betaxolol or propranolol; however, part of those induced by pindolol were resistant to these beta adrenoceptor antagonists. None of these compounds increased the spontaneous beating rate of isolated guinea pig atria; however, xamoterol only increased heart rate in isolated rat atria, and its intrinsic activity with respect to isoproterenol was 0.4. Pindolol, xamoterol and cicloprolol behaved as competitive beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists against isoproterenol-induced tachycardia in a pithed rat model. In order to mimic the intrinsic effects of the partial agonist drugs, control dose-response curves for isoproterenol were determined in pithed rats in which the base-line heart rate was elevated by thoracic spinal cord stimulation. In this in vivo preparation, xamoterol and pindolol were more potent beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists than cicloprolol; however, cicloprolol and xamoterol, in contrast to pindolol, were selective for beta-1 adrenoceptors. In isolated spontaneously beating guinea pig right atria, cicloprolol and xamoterol were equipotent beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists but were about 50 times less potent than pindolol. In isolated rat atria, the beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist potency of xamoterol was greater (pA2 = 8.7) than in guinea pig atria (pA2 = 7.8). The potencies of cicloprolol and pindolol did not vary between these species. In catecholamine-depleted rats, high i.v. doses of cicloprolol had vasodilator activity that was partly mediated by beta-2 adrenoceptors. In carbachol-contracted guinea pig trachea, cicloprolol and xamoterol, in contrast to pindolol, were relatively inactive against isoproterenol-induced relaxation. In conclusion, cicloprolol and xamoterol, similarly to pindolol, behave as agonists and antagonists of beta-1 adrenoceptors. However, only cicloprolol and xamoterol show an elevated degree of selectivity toward the beta-1 adrenoceptor subtype.", 
    "68": "To determine the sensory receptor of the nonadrenergic inhibitory nervous system (NAIS), 22 cats were anesthetized and serotonin was continuously administered (50-250 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 iv) to increase pulmonary resistance (RL) to 377 +/- 57% (SE) of the control value. We then 1) mechanically irritated the trachea, 2) intravenously administered capsaicin (5 micrograms/kg), or 3) induced hypoxia (arterial PO2 30-40 Torr) to stimulate irritant and bronchial C-fiber receptors, pulmonary C-fiber receptors, or the carotid body (chemoreceptors), respectively. After treatment with atropine (3 mg/kg iv) and propranolol (2 mg/kg iv), the serotonin-induced change in RL was reduced by 58.6 +/- 14.3% by mechanical irritation and 63.3 +/- 12.1% by intravenous capsaicin. However, hypoxia produced no dilatation of the airways. In further experiments, we employed capsaicin inhalation to stimulate bronchial C-fiber receptors. Inhaled capsaicin (0.1%, for 5 breaths) also reduced RL by 79.2 +/- 9.2% of the elevated value, after atropine and propranolol. Treatment with a ganglionic blocking agent, hexamethonium (2 mg/kg iv), abolished bronchodilator responses, implying that a reflex pathway through vagal nerves is involved in this phenomenon. These results suggest that pulmonary and bronchial C-fiber receptors may be involved as sensory receptors in NAIS reflex bronchodilatation.",

    "70": "There is little information on the functional significance of alpha-adrenergic receptors in the dog's coronary collateral circulation. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of infusion of either norepinephrine (NE) or B-HT 920 (BHT), an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, on vascular resistance of coronary collaterals in chloralose-anesthetized dogs 2-3 mo after placement of an Ameroid constrictor around the left circumflex coronary (LCX) artery. To accomplish this, the vagotomized left ventricle was autoperfused through the left main coronary ostium using a servo-controlled constant-pressure pump. Pressures of the left anterior descending (LAD) and peripheral LCX arteries were measured, and regional blood flow in LAD and LCX regions were determined with radioactive microspheres before and during NE infusion in the unblocked condition, following beta-adrenergic and beta + alpha 1-adrenergic blockade with the use of propranolol and prazosin, respectively. The same parameters were also measured before and during BHT infusion following beta-adrenergic and beta + alpha 2-adrenergic blockade with the use of propranolol and idazoxan, respectively. In the unblocked condition, NE reduced LAD, LCX, and collateral resistance by 43, 50, and 31%, respectively. After beta-adrenergic blockade, NE increased LAD resistance (29%) but did not alter LCX or collateral resistance. The increase in LAD resistance was abolished following alpha 1-adrenergic blockade. BHT increased vascular resistance in LAD, LCX, and collateral circulations by 35, 29, and 45%, respectively. Selective alpha 2-adrenergic blockade significantly attenuated the vasoconstrictor response to BHT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "Our objectives were 1) to determine whether exogenously administered arginine vasopressin (AVP) can exert a vasoactive influence on the pulmonary circulation of conscious dogs during specific vasopressinergic-1 (V1) receptor block, and 2) to assess the extent to which the pulmonary vascular response to AVP during V1 receptor block is mediated by either sympathetic beta-adrenergic or cholinergic receptor activation or by cyclooxygenase pathway activation. Multipoint pulmonary vascular pressure-cardiac index (P/Q) plots were constructed during normoxia in conscious dogs by stepwise constriction of the thoracic inferior vena cava to reduce Q. In dogs pretreated with a specific V1 receptor antagonist [d(CH2)5 AVP, 10 micrograms/kg iv], AVP infusion (7.6 ng.kg-1 X min-1 iv) increased (P less than 0.01) Q from 139 +/- 6 to 175 +/- 8 ml.min-1 X kg-1, and decreased (P less than 0.01) the pulmonary vascular pressure gradient (pulmonary arterial pressure-pulmonary capillary wedge pressure: PAP-PCWP) over the entire range of Q studied (140 to 80 ml.min-1 X kg-1). This pulmonary vasodilator response to AVP during V1 block was also observed following sympathetic beta-adrenergic block alone, following combined sympathetic beta-adrenergic and cholinergic block, and following cyclooxygenase pathway inhibition. Thus exogenous administration of AVP during specific V1 receptor block results in active, nonflow-dependent pulmonary vasodilation. This pulmonary vasodilator response is not mediated by reflex activation of sympathetic beta-adrenergic or cholinergic receptors or by metabolites of the cyclooxygenase pathway over a broad range of Q.", 
    "72": "The antianginal efficacy of carvedilol, a novel beta-blocking agent with vasodilating action, and atenolol were compared in 12 patients with stable effort angina and a positive stress test response. All patients received single doses of placebo, carvedilol, 25 and 50 mg, and atenolol, 50 mg. Heart rate at rest was reduced by 11 and 12 beats/min with both drugs, but only carvedilol, 50 mg, reduced blood pressure at rest. Both carvedilol, 50 mg, and atenolol, 50 mg, increased mean exercise time (24% and 34%, respectively, compared with placebo), time to angina (35% and 51%, respectively), and time to 1 mm of ST-segment depression (54% and 102%, respectively, p less than 0.05 carvedilol vs atenolol). Carvedilol, 25 mg, produced smaller, directionally similar changes in exercise performance, which did not reach statistical significance except for time to 1 mm of ST depression. Both drugs in the 50-mg dose reduced ST-segment depression similarly at maximal and submaximal work levels and lowered heart rate and rate-pressure product at maximal and submaximal work. Carvedilol, 50 mg alone, significantly lowered maximal systolic pressure and rate-pressure product at 1 mm of ST-segment depression. Despite some evidence of vasodilator activity for carvedilol, there was no significant difference in antianginal efficacy with a conventional beta-blocking drug.", 
    "73": "Infarct expansion and infarct extension are events early in the course of myocardial infarction with serious short- and long-term consequences. Infarct expansion, disproportionate thinning, and dilatation of the infarct segment probably begin within hours of acute infarction and usually reach peak extent within seven to 14 days. Clinical data suggest that infarct expansion occurs in approximately 35% to 45% of anterior transmural myocardial infarctions and to a lesser extent in infarctions at other sites. Although expansion usually develops in large infarcts, the extent of transmural necrosis rather than absolute infarct size predicts its occurrence. Expansion has an adverse effect on infarct structure and function for several reasons. Functional infarct size is increased because of infarct segment lengthening, and expansion results in over-all ventricular dilatation. Thus, patients with expansion of an infarct have poorer exercise tolerance, more congestive heart failure symptoms, and greater early and late mortality than those without expansion. Infarct rupture and late aneurysm formation are two additional structural consequences of infarct expansion. Experimental and clinical data suggest that the incidence and severity of expansion can be modified by interventions. Increased ventricular loading conditions and steroidal and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents make expansion more severe. Reperfusion of the infarct segment and pharmacologic interventions that decrease ventricular afterload lessen the severity of expansion. Previous myocardial infarction and preexisting ventricular hypertrophy may also limit the development of infarct expansion. Infarct extension is defined clinically as early in-hospital reinfarction after a myocardial infarction. The pathologic finding of infarct extension is necrotic and healing myocardium of several different recent ages within the same vascular territory. Although this pathologic criterion usually cannot be verified, studies employing invasive and noninvasive assessment of patients with early reinfarction provide evidence that the new myocardial injury is usually in the same vascular risk region as the original infarction. A variety of different criteria have been applied in the clinical diagnosis of infarct extension, and this has resulted in a large range of estimated frequencies from under 10% to as high as 86%. High estimates are found in studies using one or two nonspecific criteria such as ST segment shift or reelevation of total CK. The lowest rates have been found when combinations of criteria are used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "74": "In conclusion, the PIA patient is at high risk, with higher early as well as late mortality. The pathophysiology of PIA is complex and may vary from patient to patient. The concepts of ischemia at a distance and ischemia in the infarct zone have led to a better understanding of early PIA. Coronary spasm may play an important role in most PIA patients as in the general population of patients with angina pectoris. Medical therapy is efficacious in many, although it may on rare occasion aggravate myocardial ischemia. Urgent coronary arteriography is generally safe and should be performed as soon as possible for medically refractory PIA. CABG appears to be safe in experienced hands, but its timing must be individualized. The IABP should be reserved for more unstable patients for fear of vascular complications. Randomized controlled trials such as the BARI Trial will further compare PTCA with CABG.", 
    "75": "Although most of the centrally and peripherally-acting adrenergic inhibitors have been available for several years, they continue to contribute importantly to antihypertensive therapy. There are remarkably few contraindications to their use. They are useful in hypertension of all grades of severity, and are also valuable in complicated forms of hypertension, such as those associated with renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive lung disease. They can produce some fairly predictable side effects in patients, but generally do not cause significant metabolic changes. These drugs also seem to be tolerated well by physically active patients. They appear to have desirable effects on cardiac structure. In general, the adrenergic inhibitors cause regression of a left ventricular hypertrophy, which may well be a valuable property, especially in older hypertensive patients.", 
    "76": "The greater sensitivity of echocardiography than electrocardiography has revealed left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) to occur in a significant minority of patients with systemic hypertension, with the exact prevalence dependent both on how a population is selected and on the sex. race, and possibly age composition of its members. LVH is more closely related to blood pressure recorded in the patient's natural setting during normal activity or exercise--whether measured by portable recorder or home manometer--than to blood pressure measured by the physician. A subgroup of patients with mild essential hypertension exhibit high cardiac output and evidence of supernormal myocardial contractility in the absence of LVH; whereas amongst patients with more sustained hypertension, LVH may be either concentric (associated with high ejection fractions) or eccentric (associated with abnormal responses to exercise). Recent data indicate that echocardiographic detection of LVH identifies mildly hypertensive patients at significant risk, a finding that may aid identification of patients for drug treatment.", 
    "77": "The use of 100 nM CGP 20712 A (1-[2-((3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxy)phenoxy)ethylamino]-3-[4-(1-methyl-4- trifluoromethyl-2-imidazolyl)phenoxy]-2-propanol methanesulfonate), a specific beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, in an in vitro [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding assay simplified the detection of drug-induced alterations in central beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor density. Injection of rats with DSP-4 (N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine hydrochloride), a selective noradrenergic neurotoxin, caused an increase in neocortical and hippocampal beta 1-adrenoceptor density. Subchronic infusion of desipramine, a noradrenaline uptake inhibitor, effected a decrease in neocortical and hippocampal beta 1-adrenoceptor density. Subchronic infusion of clenbuterol, a centrally acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist, appeared to decrease striatal beta 2-adrenoceptor density. The results are discussed in terms of the quantitation and regulation of central beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "78": "The mechanisms controlling vagally induced serotonin-like immunoreactivity (5-HTLI) release into portal circulation and jejunal lumen were studied in individual cats. In control animals, electrical vagal nerve stimulation significantly enhanced both the endoluminal secretion rate of 5-HTLI and the release of 5-HTLI to the portal vein. The vagally induced release of 5-HTLI to the portal circulation was blocked by pretreatment with propranolol or phenoxybenzamine, or by prior removal of the superior cervical ganglia, but was not blocked by atropine or hexamethonium. On the contrary, the luminal secretion of 5-HTLI after vagal stimulation was not blocked by adrenoceptor blocking agents or ganglionectomy, but instead was inhibited by cholinoceptor antagonists. Thus, in the same experimental animal it was shown that vagally induced release of 5-HTLI to the portal circulation was mediated by adrenoceptor mechanisms, while the luminal release of 5-HTLI was regulated via cholinoceptors. Based on indirect estimations, the apical release of 5-HT seems to be qualitatively small in comparison with the release into the portal circulation.", 
    "79": "\"Extrapyramidal\" reactions to antipsychotic drugs include acute dystonias, akathisia, Parkinson's syndrome, and tardive dyskinesia. Recent research suggests efficacy of prophylactic antiparkinson drugs in diminishing the incidence of acute dystonia in high-risk patients, although the use of lower neuroleptic doses also might lower the risk and cause fewer unwanted effects. New in the treatment of akathisia is the use of beta-blockers, specifically propranolol (Inderal and others). Many patients require maintenance antiparkinson drug therapy during prolonged antipsychotic drug treatment. There is no effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia, the prevalence of which may be growing, with an estimated annual incidence of new cases of 3%-4%; the elderly and patients with affective illness may be at greatest risk. Clinicians are also attending to the related syndrome of tardive dystonia."
