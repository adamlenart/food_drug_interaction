Urine samples were subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis by \u03b2-glucoronidase/arylsulphatase, and then extracted with perchloric acid. Sample clean-up was performed using \u03b2-receptor MIP SPE. A Supelco Ascentis\u00ae express Rp-Amide column was used to separate the analytes, and MS\u00b3 detection used an electrospray ionisation source in positive-ion mode. Recovery studies were carried out using blank urine samples fortified with the 46 analytes at the levels of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 \u03bcg l\u207b\u00b9. Recoveries were obtained ranging from 60.1% to 109.9% with relative standard deviations (RSDs, n = 7) from 0.5% to 19.4%. The limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantitation (LOQs) of the 46 analytes in urine were 0.02-0.18 and 0.05-0.60 \u03bcg l\u207b\u00b9, respectively. As a result of the selective clean-up by MIP SPE and MS\u00b3 detection of the target drugs, the sensitivity and accuracy of the present method was high enough for monitoring \u03b2\u2082-agonist and \u03b2-blocker residues in urine samples. Satisfactory results were obtained in the process of the determination of positive urine samples.", 
    "1": "Propranolol and timolol are nonselective \u00df-adrenergic antagonists that induce peripheral vasoconstriction and affect angiogenic cytokines. Oral and topical \u00df-blocker therapy has become the de facto first-line treatment for complicated infantile hemangiomas because of its superior efficacy and tolerability. Pyogenic granulomas or lobular capillary hemangiomas are common acquired vascular tumors accounting for 0.5% of all skin nodules in children. Although they are benign vascular proliferations, treatment is often sought because of recurrent episodes of bleeding and for cosmetic considerations. Numerous treatment options are available, but recurrence rates are high. Noninvasive methods of treatment are being sought, particularly for young children. Herein we report a series of seven cases of cutaneous and mucosal pyogenic granulomas treated successfully using oral or topical \u00df-blockers.", 
    "2": "Increasing evidence has demonstrated that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) -mediated systemic inflammatory response syndrome accompanied by multiple organ failure, is one of the most common causes of death in patients with severe acute pancreatitis. Recent reports have revealed that heparan sulphate (HS) proteoglycan, a component of extracellular matrices, potentiates the activation of intracellular pro-inflammatory responses via TLR4, contributing to the aggravation of acute pancreatitis. However, little is known about the participants in the HS/TLR4-mediated inflammatory cascades. Our previous work provided a clue that a membrane potassium channel (MaxiK) is responsible for HS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, in this report we attempted to reveal the roles of MaxiK in the activation of macrophages stimulated by HS. Our results showed that incubation of RAW264.7 cells with HS up-regulated MaxiK and TLR4 expression levels. HS could also activate MaxiK channels to promote the efflux of potassium ions from cells, as measured by the elevated activity of caspase-1, whereas this was significantly abolished by treatment with paxilline, a specific blocker of the MaxiK channel. Moreover, it was found that paxilline substantially inhibited HS-induced activation of several different transcription factors in macrophages, including nuclear factor-\u03baB, p38 and interferon regulatory factor-3, followed by decreased production of tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interferon-\u03b2. Taken together, our investigation provides evidence that the HS/TLR4-mediated intracellular inflammatory cascade depends on the activation of MaxiK, which may offer an important opportunity for a new approach in therapeutic strategies of severe acute pancreatitis.", 
    "3": "Propranolol, a non-selective \u03b2-blocker, is emerging as an effective treatment for complicated hemangiomas. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the therapeutic effects of propranolol against hemangiomas, using primary infantile hemangioma endothelial cells (IHECs). IHECs were treated with various concentrations of propranolol and morphological changes and apoptosis were assessed. Changes in the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes were examined. Annexin-V staining revealed that propranolol at 40, 50 and 60 \u03bcg/ml caused a concentration-dependent increase in the apoptosis of IHECs. Morphological analyses revealed that exposure to 50 \u03bcg/ml propranolol resulted in typical apoptotic changes, including shrinkage, the formation of apoptotic bodies and retention of plasma membrane integrity. Gene expression analyses revealed that propranolol treatment led to a marked increase in the expression of caspase-8, cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor, caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, as well as a concomitant reduction in lamin B1 expression. Our data collectively demonstrate that propranolol induces apoptosis of IHECs through activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, which represents an important mechanism for its therapeutic effects against infantile hemangiomas.",

    "25": "There are many studies investigating the role of non-selective beta-blockers in portal hypertension. Satisfactory reduction in portal pressure is possible in a third to half of patients with propranolol and nadolol, although combining these drugs with nitrates may be more effective. Carvedilol is a more potent agent than propranolol in reducing portal pressure, particularly in non-responders, and is better tolerated. All these drugs have been studied in primary and secondary prophylaxis, sometimes in combination with band ligation and/or nitrates. There is some evidence to support combining these agents with band ligation, despite a lack of survival benefit and increased adverse events. Hemodynamic monitoring can help select non-responders who may benefit from additional therapies such as band ligation, as lack of response is associated with worse outcomes. Propranolol should be used with caution in patients with refractory ascites, although the current evidence is not of sufficient quality to justify not using these drugs in such situations.

The drug history of hypertensive patients and blood glucose levels following 1-5 yrs of antihypertensive therapy were recorded.The gender distribution of hypertensive patients reveals a higher percentage of incidences in males (53.7%) as compared to females (46.3%). Hypertensive patient without DM on beta blockers and on thiazide shows higher incidence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (17.5%, 18.5%) and DM (10%, 11%) as compared to patient receiving other antihypertensive therapy. While in patients of new onset diabetes the incidence was higher with \u03b2-blockers (56.2%) than with thiazides (31.3%) followed by calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (12.5%). There was proportionate increase in incidence with the duration of therapy (3-5 years). None of the patients who were on ACE inhibitors or on angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reported any incidence of IGT or DM.To conclude, \u03b2-blockers and thiazides increases the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus with long term antihypertensive therapy requiring regular monitoring.

Male Wistar rats were randomly divided to drink tap water (control) or L-NAME solution for 2 weeks. The effects of nebivolol (3 or 10\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) i.v.) on blood pressure (BP), heart rate and BP variability (BPV) were recorded in awake L-NAME and control rats. Short-term and beat-to-beat BPV was assessed by the s.d. and spectral analysis of the BP recordings. Nebivolol pharmacokinetics was studied by means of traditional blood sampling. Nebivolol showed enantioselective pharmacokinetics in both experimental groups; the clearance and the volume of distribution of l-nebivolol were significantly greater than those of the d-enantiomer. The hypotensive response to nebivolol was significantly enhanced in L-NAME rats (\u0394mean arterial pressure (MAP): -16.1\u00b11.1%, P<0.05 vs. control rats) compared with normotensive animals (\u0394MAP: -1.4\u00b12.1%). An analysis of the beat-to-beat BPV showed a greater reduction in VLF BPV in the L-NAME compare with the control rats. Nebivolol significantly reduced the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio in hypertensive L-NAME animals compared with normotensive rats. Short-term BPV was markedly reduced by nebivolol in both experimental groups, although the attenuation of the s.d. of BP recording was greater in L-NAME rats. In conclusion, the hypotensive efficacy of nebivolol is significantly enhanced in L-NAME rats compared with normotensive animals, which is most likely due to a greater reduction in vascular sympathetic activity. Nebivolol markedly attenuated short-term BPV in both experimental groups, suggesting that \u03b2-blockers with additional pharmacological actions provide beneficial cardiovascular effects by controlling high BP and its short-term variability.",

Pharmacologic modulation of \u03b2-adrenoceptor (\u03b2-AR) function is one of the critical issues in the treatment of these patients because inhaled \u03b2(2)-AR agonists may induce adverse events in patients with COPD, mainly in those with coexisting CVD. Moreover, the use of \u03b2-AR blockers has traditionally been contraindicated in COPD, mainly because of the potential for acute bronchospasm and increased airway hyperresponsiveness after their administration. However, there now appears to be good evidence that \u03b2-AR blockers are not only safe but may have benefits in COPD that extend beyond a reduction in cardiovascular mortality. This article starts with a succinct outline of the evolution in our understanding of \u03b2-AR modulation in COPD, touching on treatment of COPD with \u03b2-AR agonists and the issues of \u03b2-AR blockade and cardioselectivity in patients with comorbid CVD.

    "48": "Nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension and coronary heart diseases, and also exhibits an antiplatelet activity. Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs; \u03b1, \u03b2/\u03b4, and \u03b3) inhibits the platelet aggregation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the contribution of PPAR-mediated processes to the antiplatelet activity of nifedipine.", 
    "49": "We assessed human platelet aggregation by using an aggregometer and measured several platelet activating markers and related signaling pathways in platelets treated with nifedipine in the presence or absence of PPAR agonists. Nifedipine treatment (1, 5 \u200a\u03bcmol/l) dose-dependently increased the activity and intracellular expression of PPAR-\u03b2/-\u03b3 by inhibiting the release of PPAR-\u03b2/-\u03b3 from activated platelets. Nifedipine treatment also upregulated cyclic 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (GMP)/protein kinase G (PKG) expression, and increased PI(3)K/Akt pathway, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and soluble guanylyl cyclase activities. In the presence of a selective PPAR-\u03b2 antagonist (GSK0660) or PPAR-\u03b3 antagonist (GW9662), the inhibitory effects of nifedipine on collagen-induced platelet aggregation, intracellular Ca mobilization, and protein kinase C (PKC-\u03b1) activation were abrogated. Similarly, PPAR-\u03b2-\u03b3 antagonists markedly attenuated nifedipine-mediated upregulation of nitric oxide/cyclic GMP/PKG cascade. In a mouse model of thrombosis, the administration of nifedipine substantially inhibited fluorescein sodium-induced vessel thrombus formation; however, the antithrombotic effect was considerably reduced in the presence of PPAR-\u03b2/-\u03b3 antagonists.", 
    "50": "This study is the first to show that the PPAR-\u03b2/-\u03b3-dependent upregulation of PI(3)K/Akt/nitric oxide/cyclic GMP/PKG pathway and the inhibition of PKC-\u03b1 activity and intracellular Ca(+) mobilization in platelets may be the mechanisms underlying the antiplatelet and antithrombotic activities of nifedipine.", 
    "51": "The neurotransmitter noradrenaline (NA) has anti-inflammatory properties and promotes expression of neurotrophic factors in the central nervous system (CNS) via activation of glial adrenoceptors. Here we examined the ability of conditioned media (CM) from NA-treated glial cells to impact upon neuronal complexity. Primary rat cortical neurons were treated either directly with NA (1-10 \u03bcM), or treated with CM from NA-stimulated primary mixed glial cells. Neuronal complexity was assessed using Sholl analysis. Exposure of neurons to CM from NA-stimulated glial cells increased all indices of neuronal complexity, whereas direct exposure of neurons to NA did not. CM from NA-stimulated astrocytes, but not microglia, also increased neuronal complexity indicating a key role for astrocytes. The \u03b2-adrenergic subtype was implicated in this response as the increase was blocked by the \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propanolol, but not by the \u03b1-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine. CM from glial cells treated with the \u03b2\u2082-adrenoceptor agonists salmeterol and clenbuterol, but not the \u03b2\u2081-adrenoceptor agonist xamoterol, mimicked the ability of NA to increase neuronal complexity. NA induced expression of a range of growth factors (BDNF, NGF-\u03b2, GDNF, FGF-2 and IL-6) in glial cells. In addition to this, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and JAK-STAT signalling pathways are implicated in NA CM-induced neuritic growth as inhibition of these pathways attenuated NA CM-induced neuritic growth. In conclusion, this study indicates a novel role for NA acting at glial \u03b2\u2082-adrenoceptors to induce neuritic growth through the expression of soluble factors that elicit a neurotrophic action and increase neuronal complexity.", 
    "52": "Carvedilol is a uniquely effective drug for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias in patients with heart failure. This activity is in part because of its ability to inhibit store-overload-induced calcium release (SOICR) through the RyR2 channel. We describe the synthesis, characterization, and bioassay of ca. 100 compounds based on the carvedilol motif to identify features that correlate with and optimize SOICR inhibition. A single-cell bioassay was employed on the basis of the RyR2-R4496C mutant HEK-293 cell line in which calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum through the defective channel was measured. IC50 values for SOICR inhibition were thus obtained. The compounds investigated contained modifications to the three principal subunits of carvedilol, including the carbazole and catechol moieties, as well as the linker chain containing the \u03b2-amino alcohol functionality. The SAR results indicate that significant alterations are tolerated in each of the three subunits.",

On the other hand, computed tomography coronary angiography, even though exposing to radiation, clearly demonstrates the intramural course, the overlying muscular bands and the surrounding tissues also in asymptomatic patients and in absence of systolic compression. The prognosis of patients with myocardial bridge is usually good, but further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term prognosis of these patients, the adequate diagnostic and preventive approach and to better discern which patients should be candidate to medical, percutaneous or surgical treatment.", 
    "59": "Although reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical are generated as the natural byproduct of normal oxygen metabolism, they can create oxidative damage via interaction with bio-molecules. The role of oxidative stress as a remarkable upstream part is frequently reported in the signaling cascade of inflammation as well as chemo attractant production. Even though hydrogen peroxide can control cell signaling and stimulate cell proliferation at low levels, in higher concentrations it can initiate apoptosis and in very high levels may create necrosis. So far, the role of ROS in cellular damage and death is well documented with implicating in a broad range of degenerative alterations e.g. carcinogenesis, aging and other oxidative stress related diseases (OSRDs). Reversely, it is cleared that antioxidants are potentially able to suppress (at least in part) the immune system and to enhance the normal cellular protective responses to tissue damage. In this review, we aimed to provide insights on diverse OSRDs, which are correlated with the concept of oxidative stress as well as its cellular effects that can be inhibited by antioxidants. Resveratrol, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, statins, nebivolol and carvedilol, pentaerythritol tetranitrate, mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, and plant-derived drugs (alone or combined) are the potential medicines that can be used to control OSRD.", 
    "60": "Propranolol, the substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 and CYP2D6, has been reported to be in high concentrations in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. This has been thought to be due to the decrease in the nonrenal clearance of propranolol. The objective of this study is to elucidate the reason for the decrease in nonrenal clearance in ESRD patients. CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 activities were estimated by the phenacetin O-deethylation and methoprolol O-demethylation methods, respectively. Pooled normal serum and pooled uremic serum were deproteinized by methanol in order to exclude high-molecular-weight compounds. We selected as candidate inhibitors: uremic toxins such as 3-indoxyl sulfate, 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic acid, indole-3-acetic acid, and hippuric acid, and xanthine derivatives such as allantoin, uric acid, and xanthine. In this study, uremic serum was found to inhibit the CYP1A2-mediated metabolism of phenacetin to acetaminophen in a concentration-dependent and competitive manner. Xanthine also inhibited the metabolism of CYP1A2. On the other hand, uremic serum and the four uremic toxins did not inhibit the CYP2D6-mediated metabolism of metoprolol to O-demethylmetoprolol. In conclusion, this study suggests that the increase of the bioavailability of propranolol in ESRD is partly induced by the inhibition of the hepatic metabolism of CYP1A2 by xanthine in the uremic serum.",

The authors randomized 75 hypertensive patients (18-70\u00a0years) to carvedilol 12.5/25\u00a0mg, metoprolol 50/100\u00a0mg, or nebivolol 2.5/5\u00a0mg daily and followed them up for 3\u00a0months. Central arterial pressure and AIx were measured with applanation tonometry at baseline and at the end of follow-up. Analyses were restricted to 60 completers. Central systolic pressure decreased equally in all 3 treatment arms. AIx remained unchanged, while AIx@75 decreased significantly by 5.4%\u00b12.5% in the nebivolol group. According to general linear models, individual change in heart rate was a strong predictor of change in AIx in the carvedilol group (r(2) =0.23, P=.03) although no similar association was found in the nebivolol group (r(2) =0.09). The impact of \u03b2-blockers with vasodilator effects on pressure augmentation seems to be different with nebivolol having the largest potential of decreasing AIx@75. While AIx changes associated with carvedilol treatment are strongly driven by heart rate changes, those associated with nebivolol treatment seem to be the result of other mechanisms.",

Similar risk reductions were found for clinical vertebral and forearm fractures, although statistical significance was not reached. The reduction in risk did not appear to be dose-related (test for a linear trend p value 0.150). Using adjusted indirect comparisons, it was estimated that \u03b21-selective agents were significantly more effective than nonselective BBs in reducing the risk of any fracture (six studies, \u03b21-selective blockers vs. nonselective BBs: RE pooled ES = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.69-0.97).", 
    "92": "The findings suggest that the risk of fracture is approximately 15% lower in patients treated with BBs compared to controls independent of gender, fracture site, and dose. This risk reduction might be associated with the effects of \u03b21-selective blockers.", 
    "93": "Accurate prediction of pharmaceutical concentrations in wastewater effluents requires that the specific biochemical processes responsible for pharmaceutical biodegradation be elucidated and integrated within any modeling framework. The fate of three selected beta blockers-atenolol, metoprolol, and sotalol-was examined during nitrification using batch experiments to develop and evaluate a new cometabolic process-based (CPB) model. CPB model parameters describe biotransformation during and after ammonia oxidation for specific biomass populations and are designed to be integrated within the Activated Sludge Models framework. Metoprolol and sotalol were not biodegraded by the nitrification enrichment culture employed herein. Biodegradation of atenolol was observed and linked to the activity of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and heterotrophs but not nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. Results suggest that the role of AOB in atenolol degradation may be disproportionately more significant than is otherwise suggested by their lower relative abundance in typical biological treatment processes. Atenolol was observed to competitively inhibit AOB growth in our experiments, though model simulations suggest inhibition is most relevant at atenolol concentrations greater than approximately 200 ng\u00b7L(-1). CPB model parameters were found to be relatively insensitive to biokinetic parameter selection suggesting the model approach may hold utility for describing pharmaceutical biodegradation during biological wastewater treatment.",

Studies in individual patients, families, and populations over the past several decades have identified variants in genes encoding drug elimination or drug target pathways that in some cases contribute substantially to variable efficacy and toxicity. Important associations of pharmacogenomics in cardiovascular medicine include clopidogrel and risk for in-stent thrombosis, steady-state warfarin dose, myotoxicity with simvastatin, and certain drug-induced arrhythmias. This review describes methods used to accumulate and validate these findings and points to approaches--now being put in place at some centers--to implementing them in clinical care.",

The baroreflex model includes baroreceptors, cardiovascular control center, parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways. The gains of the global afferent sympathetic and vagal pathways are identified recursively. The method has been validated on data from newborn lambs, which have been acquired during the application of an autonomic maneuver, without medication and under beta-blockers. Results show a close match between experimental and simulated signals under both conditions. The vagal and sympathetic contributions have been simulated and, as expected, it is possible to observe different baroreflex responses under beta-blockers compared to baseline conditions.",

However, it is unclear whether the function of iPS-CMs is modulated by the host sympathetic nervous system. Here we developed a device for co-culture of sympathetic neurons and iPS-CMs using microfabrication technique. The device consisted of a culture chamber and a microelectrode-array (MEA) substrate. The superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons were co-cultured with iPS-CMs in a microfabricated device, which had multiple compartments. Several days after seeding, synapses were formed between SCG neurons and iPS-CMs, as confirmed by immunostaining. Spontaneous electrical activities of the SCG neurons and the iPS-CMs were observed from the electrode of the MEA substrate. The beat rate of iPS-CMs increased after electrical stimulation of the co-cultured SCG neurons. Such changes in the beat rate were prevented in the presence of propranolol, a \u03b2-adrenoreceptor antagonist. These results suggest that the microfabricated device will be utilized for studying the functional modulation of iPS-CMs by connected sympathetic neurons.",

Complete reversibility existed when all parameters were met, partial reversibility when LVEF was \u226555% plus two or three other parameters, and no reversibility when LVEF was \u226455% regardless of other parameters. The results showed that echocardiography parameters related to the regression of myocardial mass were associated with a disease duration shorter than 10.38 months. This was the main predictive variable for reversal of dilated cardiomyopathy, followed by \u03b2 -blocker treatment, and the last predictive variable was the serum level of free triiodothyronine.

    "143": "BCS classification is a vital tool in the development of both generic and innovative drug products. The purpose of this work was to provisionally classify the world's top selling oral drugs according to the BCS, using in silico methods. Three different in silico methods were examined: the well-established group contribution (CLogP) and atom contribution (ALogP) methods, and a new method based solely on the molecular formula and element contribution (KLogP). Metoprolol was used as the benchmark for the low/high permeability class boundary. Solubility was estimated in silico using a thermodynamic equation that relies on the partition coefficient and melting point. The validity of each method was affirmed by comparison to reference data and literature. We then used each method to provisionally classify the orally administered, IR drug products found in the WHO Model list of Essential Medicines, and the top-selling oral drug products in the United States (US), Great Britain (GB), Spain (ES), Israel (IL), Japan (JP), and South Korea (KR). A combined list of 363 drugs was compiled from the various lists, and 257 drugs were classified using the different in silico permeability methods and literature solubility data, as well as BDDCS classification. Lastly, we calculated the solubility values for 185 drugs from the combined set using in silico approach. Permeability classification with the different in silico methods was correct for 69-72.4% of the 29 reference drugs with known human jejunal permeability, and for 84.6-92.9% of the 14 FDA reference drugs in the set. The correlations (r(2)) between experimental log P values of 154 drugs and their CLogP, ALogP and KLogP were 0.97, 0.82 and 0.71, respectively. The different in silico permeability methods produced comparable results: 30-34% of the US, GB, ES and IL top selling drugs were class 1, 27-36.4% were class 2, 22-25.5% were class 3, and 5.46-14% were class 4 drugs, while \u223c8% could not be classified. The WHO list included significantly less class 1 and more class 3 drugs in comparison to the countries' lists, probably due to differences in commonly used drugs in developing vs industrial countries. BDDCS classified more drugs as class 1 compared to in silico BCS, likely due to the more lax benchmark for metabolism (70%), in comparison to the strict permeability benchmark (metoprolol). For 185 out of the 363 drugs, in silico solubility values were calculated, and successfully matched the literature solubility data. In conclusion, relatively simple in silico methods can be used to estimate both permeability and solubility. While CLogP produced the best correlation to experimental values, even KLogP, the most simplified in silico method that is based on molecular formula with no knowledge of molecular structure, produced comparable BCS classification to the sophisticated methods. This KLogP, when combined with a mean melting point and estimated dose, can be used to provisionally classify potential drugs from just molecular formula, even before synthesis. 49-59% of the world's top-selling drugs are highly soluble (class 1 and class 3), and are therefore candidates for waivers of in vivo bioequivalence studies. For these drugs, the replacement of expensive human studies with affordable in vitro dissolution tests would ensure their bioequivalence, and encourage the development and availability of generic drug products in both industrial and developing countries.",

We have previously demonstrated a programming effect of prenatal hypoxia on the cardiac \u03b2-adrenergic (\u03b2AR) response. The aim of this study was to determine 1) whether the decrease in \u03b2AR sensitivity in prenatally hypoxic 5-wk old chicken hearts is linked to changes in \u03b21AR/\u03b22ARs, G\u03b1i expression and cAMP accumulation and 2) whether prenatal hypoxia has an effect on heart function in vivo. We incubated eggs in normoxia (N, 21% O2) or hypoxia from day 0 (H, 14% O2) and raised the posthatchlings to 5 wk of age. Cardiac \u03b21AR/\u03b22ARs were assessed through competitive binding of [(3)H]CGP-12177 with specific \u03b21AR or \u03b22AR blockers. G\u03b1s and G\u03b1i proteins were assessed by Western blot and cAMP accumulation by ELISA. Echocardiograms were recorded in anesthetized birds to evaluate diastolic/systolic diameter and heart rate and tissue sections were stained for collagen. We found an increase in relative heart mass, \u03b21ARs, and G\u03b1s in prenatally hypoxic hearts. cAMP levels after isoproterenol stimulation and collagen content was not changed in H compared with N, but in vivo echocardiograms showed systolic contractile dysfunction. The changes in \u03b2AR and G protein subtypes may be indicative of an early compensatory stage in the progression of cardiac dysfunction, further supported by the cardiac hypertrophy and systolic contractile dysfunction. We suggest that it is not the changes in the proximal part of the \u03b2AR system that causes the decreased cardiac contractility, but Ca(2+) handling mechanisms further downstream in the \u03b2AR signaling cascade.",

Forty-five studies addressed the effect of a single beta2-agonist administration, and eight focused on long-term treatment. We addressed these two different intervention regimens as different comparisons.Among primary outcomes for short-term administration, data on maximum fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) showed a significant protective effect for both short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) and long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) compared with placebo, with a mean difference of -17.67% (95% confidence interval (CI) -19.51% to -15.84%, P = 0.00001, 799 participants from 72 studies). The subgroup analysis of studies performed in adults compared with those performed in children showed high heterogeneity confined to children, despite the comparable mean bronchoprotective effect.Secondary outcomes on other pulmonary function parameters confirmed a more positive and protective effect of beta2-agonists on EIA compared with placebo. Occurrence of side effects was not significantly different between beta2-agonists and placebo.Overall evaluation of the included long-term studies suggests a beta2-agonist bronchoprotective effect for the first dose of treatment. However, long-term use of both SABA and LABA induced the onset of tolerance and decreased the duration of drug effect, even after a short treatment period.",

Several reports have described transient increases in blood pressure after major earthquakes, but the impact of such increases on hemodialysis patients has not been reported. We retrospectively investigated changes in blood pressure and influencing factors in 205 patients (mean age 66.6\u00b113.0 years; male 51.7%; median dialysis vintage 6.0 (2.0-11.0) years) on chronic dialysis at three dialysis centers in the affected area (Fukushima City) for 8 weeks after the earthquake. Pre-dialysis blood pressure was significantly elevated at 1 week after the earthquake compared with baseline (systolic vs. diastolic blood pressure: 153.1\u00b120.2/80.1\u00b113.5 vs. 148.6\u00b120.0/77.5\u00b112.8\u2009mm\u2009Hg, P<0.001), similarly post-dialysis blood pressure was elevated for up to 8 weeks. Independent factors influencing changes in blood pressure after the earthquake comprised baseline blood pressure and \u03b1-blockers. The earthquake induced a significant elevation in blood pressure among patients on chronic dialysis, and activation of the sympathetic nervous system might at least in part be associated with the mechanism underlying this increase.",

It is characterised by prolongation of the QT interval and by the occurrence of syncope, due to torsades-des-pointes ventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrest and sudden death; these life-threatening cardiac events are usually, but not always, associated with physical or emotional stress. It is a genetic disorder, and knowledge of the genotype impacts significantly on management. Extremely effective therapies are available, which makes the existence of undiagnosed affected and symptomatic patients inexcusable. Indeed, mortality for properly treated patients has now declined to around 1% over a 10-year period. This review, aimed at the clinical cardiologist, discusses briefly the essential genetic information and focuses primarily on the main issues of diagnosis and therapy. One special point of interest is in the impact of genetics on clinical management and the potential medicolegal consequences of not pursuing genetic screening in the proband and hence in the family members.",

Dose of -adrenoblockers is considered optimal if at the background of treatment resting heart rate (rHR) is persistently decreased down to 55-60 bpm. But according to data of international registries rate of achievement of target rHR (trHR) in real clinical practice does not exceed 22%. Aim of this study was to determine what portion of patients with SA and arterial hypertension (AH) achieves trHR at the background of therapy with -adrenoblockers in routine practice in this country. Twenty centers in 6 towns in Russian Federation recruited 399 patients (mean age 64+/-10 years) with class I-III angina and concomitant primary AH. These patients for at least 2 months received any -adrenoblocker and did not change its dose during 4 weeks before inclusion into the program. Portion of patients with trHR was 15.5%. There were no significant differences between average daily doses of most frequently used -adrenoblockers (metoprolol, bisoprolol, carvediolol) in groups of patients who achieved and did not achieve trHR. Quality of life of patients who achieved was comparable with that of those who did not achieve trHR. Attainment of trHR was associated with significant decrease of short acting requirement nitrates. There was a significant direct correlation between attainment of trHR and target arterial pressure.",

The mechanisms underlying the anti-fibrotic effects of carvedilol are unknown. Recent studies have revealed the critical role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in a variety of cardiovascular diseases. This study investigated whether miR-29b is involved in the cardioprotective effect of carvedilol against AMI-induced myocardial fibrosis. Male SD rats were randomized into several groups: the sham surgery control, left anterior descending (LAD)\u00a0surgery-AMI model, AMI plus low-dose carvedilol treatment (1 mg/kg per day, CAR-L), AMI plus medium-dose carvedilol treatment (5 mg/kg per day, CAR-M) and AMI plus high-dose carvedilol treatment (10 mg/kg per day, CAR-H). Cardiac remodeling and impaired heart function were observed 4 weeks after LAD surgery treatment; the observed cardiac remodeling, decreased ejection fraction, and fractional shortening were rescued in the CAR-M and CAR-H groups. The upregulated expression of Col1a1, Col3a1, and \u03b1-SMA mRNA was significantly reduced in the CAR-M and CAR-H groups. Moreover, the downregulated miR-29b was elevated in the CAR-M and CAR-H groups. The\u00a0in vitro\u00a0study showed that Col1a1, Col3a1, and \u03b1-SMA were downregulated and miR-29b was upregulated by carvedilol in a dose-dependent manner in rat cardiac fibroblasts. Inhibition of ROS-induced Smad3 activation by carvedilol resulted in downregulation of Col1a1, Col3a1, and \u03b1-SMA and upregulation of miR-29b derived from the miR-29b-2 precursor. Enforced expression of miR-29b significantly suppressed Col1a1, Col3a1, and \u03b1-SMA expression. Taken together, we found that smad3 inactivation and miR-29b upregulation contributed to the cardioprotective activity of carvedilol against AMI-induced myocardial fibrosis.", 
    "161": "We assessed the contribution of blood pressure (BP), inflammation, and endothelial activation to the development of structural vascular and cardiac changes in hypertension. Furthermore, the effects of antihypertensive therapy were studied. We studied 114 patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy and 38 matched hypertensive subjects without cardiac hypertrophy and 38 normotensive subjects. The group with hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy were randomized to treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker (irbesartan) or a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker (atenolol) for 48 weeks. Markers of inflammation (high-sensitive C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, leukocyte counts), vascular function (ambulatory aortic stiffness index, arterial compliance, and pulse pressure), and endothelial activation (E-selectin, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular adhesion molecule-1) were assessed. Markers of inflammation and arterial stiffness were lowest in the normotensive group and highest in patients with hypertensive heart disease; endothelial markers were similar between groups. Inflammation was independently related to BP. Markers of arterial stiffness were independently related to BP and to a lesser extent to left ventricular mass. Antihypertensive treatment improved arterial compliance; inflammatory and endothelial markers remained unchanged. In conclusion, markers of inflammation and arterial stiffness are independently related to BP. Antihypertensive therapy seems to improve arterial stiffness, but effects on markers of inflammation and endothelial activation are small.", 
    "162": "Time-dependent changes in the renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have not been investigated, despite the fact that renal sympathetic nervous system is augmented in the condition of CKD. In the present study, we examined time-dependent changes in RSNA and renal venous norepinephrine concentrations for 12 weeks using 5 of 6 nephrectomized CKD rats. Both RSNA and norepinephrine concentrations were increased during the early phase in the progression of CKD. Urinary protein excretion and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were gradually increased during 12 weeks after 5 of 6 nephrectomy. Treatment with \u03b3-aminobutyric acid or the combination of prazosin and propranolol in the early phase (0-4 weeks) after 5 of 6 nephrectomy significantly attenuated the increases in urinary protein excretion and SBP in 5 of 6 nephrectomized rats. On the other hand, the same treatment in the late phase (8-12 weeks) after 5 of 6 nephrectomy failed to suppress the proteinuria and increase in SBP. Treatment with hydralazine at hypotensive dose for 12 weeks also failed to affect the proteinuria in 5 of 6 nephrectomized CKD rats. In conclusion, the augmentation of renal sympathetic nervous system in early phase after 5 of 6 nephrectomy is closely related to the development of partial ablation-induced CKD in rats.", 
    "163": "Photoactivation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) with UV (254nm) irradiation was used to generate the SO4(-)-based advanced oxidation process, which was adopted to degrade atenolol (ATL) in water. The second-order reaction rate constants of ATL with HO and SO4(-) were determined, and the effects of operational parameters (dose of PMS, solution pH, HCO3(-), humic acids (HA), and N2 bubbling) were evaluated as well. Finally the main transformation intermediates were identified and possible degradation pathways were proposed. The results showed that there was a linear positive correlation between the degradation rate of ATL and specific dose of PMS (1-16M PMS/M ATL). Increasing solution pH from 3 to 9 promoted elimination of ATL due to the pH-dependent effect of PMS photodecomposition, while further pH increase from 9 to 11 caused slowing down of degradation because of apparent conversion of HO to SO4(-). 1-8mM HCO3(-) exerted no more than 5.3% inhibition effect on ATL destruction, suggesting HCO3(-) was a weak inhibitor. Absorption (or complexation) and photosensitized oxidation induced by HA improved ATL degradation during the first minute of degradation process, whereas photon competition and radical scavenging effects became the leading role afterward. Bubbling with nitrogen enhanced the degradation rate due to the stripping of dissolved oxygen. Hydroxylation of aromatic ring, cleavage of ether bond, oxidation of primary and secondary amine moieties, and dimerization were involved in the degradation mechanism of ATL by UV/PMS.", 
    "164": "GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that appears to be associated with the action of volatile anesthetics. These anesthetics potentiate GABA-induced postsynaptic currents by synaptic GABAA receptors, although recent evidence suggests that these agents also significantly affect extrasynaptic GABA receptors. However, the effect of volatile anesthetics on the extracellular concentration of GABA in the central nervous system has not been fully established. In the present study, rat brain cortical slices loaded with [(3)H]GABA were used to investigate the effect of halothane and sevoflurane on the extracellular accumulation of this neurotransmitter. The accumulation of [(3)H]GABA was significantly increased by sevoflurane (0.058, 0.11, 0.23, 0.46, and 0.93\u00a0mM) and halothane (0.006, 0.012, 0.024, 0.048, 0072, and 0.096\u00a0mM) with an EC50 of 0.26\u00a0mM and 35\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. TTX (blocker of voltage-dependent Na(+) channels), EGTA (an extracellular Ca(2+) chelator) and BAPTA-AM (an intracellular Ca(2+) chelator) did not interfere with the accumulation of [(3)H]GABA induced by 0.23\u00a0mM sevoflurane and 0.048\u00a0mM halothane. SKF 89976A, a GABA transporter type 1 (GAT-1) inhibitor, reduced the sevoflurane- and halothane-induced increase in the accumulation of GABA by 57 and 63\u00a0%, respectively. Incubation of brain cortical slices at low temperature (17\u00a0\u00b0C), a condition that inhibits GAT function and reduces GABA release through reverse transport, reduced the sevoflurane- and halothane-induced increase in the accumulation of [(3)H]GABA by 82 and 75\u00a0%, respectively, relative to that at normal temperature (37\u00a0\u00b0C). Ouabain, a Na(+)/K(+) ATPase pump inhibitor, which is known to induce GABA release through reverse transport, abolished the sevoflurane and halothane effects on the accumulation of [(3)H]GABA. The effect of sevoflurane and halothane did not involve glial transporters because \u03b2-alanine, a blocker of GAT-2 and GAT-3, did not inhibit the effect of the anesthetics. In conclusion, the present study suggests that sevoflurane and halothane increase the accumulation of GABA by inducing the reverse transport of this neurotransmitter. Therefore, volatile anesthetics could interfere with neuronal excitability by increasing the action of GABA on synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA receptors.", 
    "165": "A 26-year-old patient was diagnosed as having chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction with manometric and histopathologic features suggestive of an intestinal myopathy. Histology was characterized by smooth muscle degeneration without inflammatory or immune cells. The severe gut dysfunction required full parenteral nutritional support. After a few months, the patient developed symptomatic tachy-brady arrhythmia episodes with syncopes. A thorough diagnostic work-up led to a diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome, which was managed by pacemaker implantation and administration of \u03b2-blockers. This led to a partial improvement in tachy-brady arrhythmia episodes. Nonetheless, the patient continued to experience sustained supraventricular tachyarrhythmia runs, poorly responsive to increasing \u03b2-blocker doses. To investigate the origin of the cardiologic impairment, the patient was tested for anticonductive tissue autoantibodies, which were positive, thus supporting a possible autoimmune origin of the dysrhythmia. Other autoantibodies were negative. On the basis of these findings, the patient was treated with high-dose steroids, which were then tapered. The patient responded to the steroid treatment and did not experience further episodes of syncope and tachyarrhythmias. The severe gut dysfunction remained unchanged. This case highlights an association between severe gut dysfunction and cardiac conductive tissue abnormalities, with autoantibodies to conductive tissue possibly causing the dysrhythmia. The severe gut and heart (likely autoimmune-mediated) dysfunction presented in this case provides a basis to further assess a link between intestinal and cardiac abnormal rhythmicity.", 
    "166": "Pharmacologic interventions for thoracic aneurysms remain poorly characterized. The results of a pilot study by our group suggested improved outcomes among patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm who were taking statins. In the present study, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of a larger cohort of patients from the Database of the Aortic Institute at Yale-New Haven Hospital. A total of 1,560 patients met the inclusion criteria. The adverse events (i.e., death, dissection, or rupture) and surgery rates for patients with (n\u00a0= 369, 24%) and without (n\u00a0= 1,191, 76%) statin therapy were compared. We evaluated 3 anatomic components of the aorta: root, ascending and arch, and descending and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. A smaller proportion of the statin group had adverse events: overall, 7% versus 15%; ascending and arch, 6% versus 15%; and descending and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 8% versus 20%. Also, a smaller proportion of statin patients required surgery: overall, 48% versus 60%; ascending and arch, 51% versus 62%; and descending and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 36% versus 59% (p <0.001 to 0.01). The protective effect of statins was seen in all segments, except the aortic root. Log-rank evaluation of the interval to an adverse event or surgery was longer among statin-treated patients (p <0.001). Logistic regression analysis found statin use, angiotensin receptor blocker use, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were associated with decreased adverse events, and statin use, angiotensin receptor blocker use, \u03b2-blocker therapy, and age were associated with a decreased odds of requiring surgery. Multiple logistic regression analysis found only statins were associated with a decreased odds of an adverse event and that statins, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were associated with a decreased odds of undergoing surgery. In conclusion, these findings provide a medicinal option for the arsenal of treatment options for patients with aneurysms of the thoracic aorta.",

Whether this finding also applies to heart failure patients with preserved systolic function is unknown. Therefore, we have studied the effect of adding eplerenone to standard pharmacological heart failure therapy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker and diuretic and \u03b2-blocker) in the progression of heart failure in spontaneously hypertensive heart failure (SHHF) rats.",

Untreated SHHF was characterized by progressive left ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and myocardial contractile and relaxation abnormalities, leading to pulmonary congestion. Despite similar blood pressure control, the addition of eplerenone to standard heart failure therapy further prevented left ventricular hypertrophy, contractile and relaxation alterations, and pulmonary congestion than standard heart failure therapy alone. ST-SHHF and Eple\u200a+\u200aST-SHHF rats showed similar inhibition of structural extracellular matrix proteins collagen I, collagen III and fibronectin and metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-7, MMP-12, and MMP-13. However, only the coadministration of eplerenone with standard heart failure therapy normalized the expression of matricellular proteins thrombospondin 1, tenascin C, periostin, and secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine/osteonectin to values comparable to normotensive rats.",

This study aimed to examine if old drugs could display the new use and to develop a novel therapy for inflammatory pain. Injection of carrageenan in hindpaw evoked hyperalgesia detected by noxious heat stimulation. Intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 increased paw withdrawal latency (PWL) above normal level (hypoalgesia) during the late phase of carrageenan-evoked inflammation. The hypoalgesia was completely abolished by systemic injection of naloxone chloride and naloxone methiodide. Moreover, i.pl. injection of a combination of WAY-100635 and ketanserin, a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, at their minimal doses attenuated hyperalgesia in the late phase of carrageenan-evoked inflammation. Subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of both ketanserin and propranolol dose-dependently inhibited carrageenan-evoked hyperalgesia. The treatment with a combination of ketanserin and propranolol by s.c. injection abolished carrageenan-evoked hyperalgesia at the doses, at which the drugs failed to alter the hypersensitivity when they were given alone. Furthermore, the combination of ketanserin and propranolol was also effective in relieving arthritic hyperalgesia and muscle pain at a minimal dose. The present study suggests that the activation of 5-HT1A receptors suppressed naloxone-reversible antinociception contributing to the maintenance of inflammatory pain, and that the concomitant blockade of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in the periphery produced synergistic effects on inflammatory hyperalgesia. It is proposed that the combination of ketanserin and propranolol injected s.c. could be a promising therapy for relieving inflammatory pain with minimal side effects.",

In one patient a relapse of airway problems occurred two months after discontinuation of propranolol at 16 months of age; this resolved after re-start of propranolol. Review of literature together with these five cases showed 81 patients with airway IHs treated with propranolol. Propranolol was effective in 90% of the cases and seven patients were classified as non-responders.

Because of the fast and important effects of propranolol, randomized controlled trials are hardly justifiable for this specific, relatively rare but, acute treatment indication. Despite the efficacy of propranolol, close monitoring of the patients with an airway IH is required, considering the risk of relapse of symptoms during or after treatment and the reported resistance to propranolol in at least 9% of the published cases. The dose and duration of treatment should be high and long enough to prevent relapse. Further research should focus on the optimal treatment protocol; the actual percentage of non-responders and also the mechanism of resistance to propranolol is unknown and needs to be illuminated.",

Considering the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the uncoupling of eNOS, we hypothesized that the preadministration of an antioxidant as tempol, could improve the hypotensive response of nebivolol in normotensive animals increasing the nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability by a reduction of superoxide (O2(\u2022-)) basal level production in the vascular tissue. Male Sprague Dawley rats were given tap water to drink (control group) or tempol (an antioxidant scavenger of superoxide) for 1 week. After 1 week, Nebivolol, at a dose of 3 mg/kg, was injected intravenously to the control group or to the tempol-treated group. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and blood pressure variability were evaluated in the control, tempol, nebivolol, and tempol nebivolol groups, as well as, the effect of different inhibitor as N\u03b2-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, a Nitric oxide synthase blocker) or glybenclamide, a KATP channel inhibitor. Also, the expression of \u03b1,\u03b2 soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), phospho-eNOS, and phospho-vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (P-VASP) were evaluated by Western Blot and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) commercial kit assay. We showed that pretreatment with tempol in normotensive rats produces a hypotensive response after nebivolol administration through an increase in the NO bioavailability and sGC, improving the NO/cGMP/protein kinase G (PKG) pathway compared to that of the nebivolol group. We demonstrated that tempol preadministration beneficiates the response of a third-generation beta blocker with eNOS stimulation properties, decreasing the basal uncoupling of eNOS, and improving NO bioavailability.

We hypothesized that C is superior to M in chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy because of its better anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic effects. In order to test our hypothesis we used a chronic canine model of multivessel ischemic cardiomyopathy where myocardial microcatheters were placed from which interstitial fluid was collected over time to measure leukocyte count and cytokine levels. After development of left ventricular dysfunction, the animals were randomized into four groups: sham (n = 7), placebo (n = 8), M (n = 11), and C (n = 10), and followed for 3 months after treatment initiation. Tissue was examined for immunohistochemistry, oxidative stress, and capillary density. At 3 months both rest and stress wall thickening were better in C compared to the other groups. At the end of 3 months of treatment end-systolic wall stress also decreased the most in C. Similarly resting myocardial blood flow (MBF) improved the most in C as did the stress endocardial/epicardial MBF. Myocardial interstitial fluid showed greater attenuation of leukocytosis with C compared to M, which was associated with less fibrosis and oxidative stress. C also had higher IL-10 level and capillary density. In conclusion, in a chronic canine model of multivessel ischemic cardiomyopathy we found 3 months of C treatment resulted in better resting global and regional function as well as better regional function at stress compared to M. These changes were associated with higher myocardial levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and less myocardial oxidative stress, leukocytosis, and fibrosis. Capillary density and MBF were almost normalized. Thus in the doses used in this study, C appears to be superior to M in a chronic canine model of ischemic cardiomyopathy from beneficial effects on inflammation and angiogenesis. Further studies are required for comparing additional doses of these drugs.",

During the median follow-up of 2.5 years after discharge, 92 patients died. Cox hazard analysis showed that, even after adjustment for covariates, carvedilol significantly decreased all-cause mortality in this cohort (P < 0.01). Furthermore, a beneficial effect on outcome was found in patients with reduced (LVEF \u2264 40%) and preserved (LVEF > 40%) EF (all P < 0.05).

Here, we demonstrated that orexin-A elicited significant activation of AMPK in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus by elevating cytosolic free Ca\u00b2\u207a involving extracellular calcium influx. Electrophysiological results revealed that orexin-A increased the L-type calcium current via the orexin receptor-phospholipase C-protein kinase C signaling pathway in ARC neurons that produce neuropeptide Y, an important downstream effector of orexin-A's orexigenic effect. Furthermore, the L-type calcium channel inhibitor nifedipine attenuated orexin-A-induced AMPK activation in vitro and in vivo. We found that inhibition of AMPK by either compound C (6-[4-[2-(1-piperidinyl)ethoxy]phenyl]-3-(4-pyridinyl)-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine) or the ATP-mimetic 9-\u03b2-D-arabinofuranoside prevented the appetite-stimulating effect of orexin-A.
