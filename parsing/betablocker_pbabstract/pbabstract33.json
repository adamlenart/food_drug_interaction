Cytochrome P450 (P450) activity is regulated transcriptionally and by the rate of electron transfer from P450 reductase. In vitro studies have demonstrated that cytochrome b5 (Cyb5) also modulates P450 function. We recently showed that hepatic deletion of Cyb5 in the mouse (HBN) markedly alters in vivo drug pharmacokinetics; a key outstanding question is whether Cyb5 modulates the activity of the major human P450s in drug disposition in vivo. To address this, we crossed mice humanized for CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 with mice carrying a hepatic Cyb5 deletion. In vitro triazolam 4-hydroxylation (probe reaction for CYP3A4) was reduced by >50% in hepatic microsomes from CYP3A4-HBN mice compared with controls. Similar reductions in debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation and metoprolol \u03b1-hydroxylation were observed using CYP2D6-HBN microsomes, indicating a significant role for Cyb5 in the activity of both enzymes. This effect was confirmed by the concentration-dependent restoration of CYP3A4-mediated triazolam turnover and CYP2D6-mediated bufuralol and debrisoquine turnover on addition of Escherichia coli membranes containing recombinant Cyb5. In vivo, the peak plasma concentration and area under the concentration time curve from 0 to 8 hours (AUC0-8 h) of triazolam were increased 4- and 5.7-fold, respectively, in CYP3A4-HBN mice. Similarly, the pharmacokinetics of bufuralol and debrisoquine were significantly altered in CYP2D6-HBN mice, the AUC0-8 h being increased \u223c1.5-fold and clearance decreased by 40-60%. These data demonstrate that Cyb5 can be a major determinant of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 activity in vivo, with a potential impact on the metabolism, efficacy, and side effects of numerous therapeutic drugs.", 
    "1": "The cardiovascular consequences of cocaine use are numerous and can be severe, with mechanisms of cardiotoxicity unique to cocaine that include sympathomimetic effects, blockade of sodium and potassium channels, oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage, and disruption of excitation-contraction coupling. In combination, these effects increase myocardial oxygen demand while simultaneously decreasing oxygen supply. Cocaine-associated chest pain is particularly common and, in some instances, associated with a more severe cardiac syndrome, such as myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, aortic dissection, or endocarditis. Therapy for cocaine-associated chest pain and myocardial infarction is similar to treatment in non-cocaine users, except for differences in the use of benzodiazepines and phentolamine and avoidance of beta-blockers in the acute setting. In this review, we discuss the most up-to-date literature regarding the mechanisms of cocaine-associated cardiotoxicity and clinical consequences, diagnosis, and treatment; we also discuss relevant controversies while proposing several important areas for future research.", 
    "2": "Timolol has recently been reported to be an effective and safe treatment for small and superficial infantile hemangiomas (IH). However, it is controversial to choose it as an alternative to oral propranolol for large superficial IH. In this study, we generated a new modified timolol agent as the base of an ointment. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of this new agent, we recruited 20 patients with large superficial IH. The average age was 4 months old. The average area of the IH was 28.8 cm(2) . The treatment was continued for 2-6 months. Three assessors were asked to judge the changes in both the treated and untreated parts separately by comparing photographs. After an average of 3.25 months of treatment, the average visual analog scale scores were 5.5 and 4.3 for those with and without the medication, respectively. The treated parts regressed significantly more than the untreated parts (P < 0.05). There were no side-effects observed during treatment. High performance liquid chromatography was used to detect the serum concentration of timolol, and no timolol was detected in any of the blood samples (<0.02 \u03bcg/mL). Our new modified timolol agent is proven to be an effective therapy option for IH. Prospective studies with high-precision serum timolol concentrations, with heart rate or blood pressure monitoring during treatment, are needed to evaluate potential systemic absorption when using timolol on large IH.",

    "7": "By activating their receptors (OX1R and OX2R) orexin-A/B regulate wake/sleeping states, feeding behaviors, but the function of these peptides in the retina remains unknown. Using patch-clamp recordings and calcium imaging in rat isolated retinal cells, we demonstrated that orexin-A suppressed \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA)-preferring receptor-mediated currents (AMPA-preferring currents) in ganglion cells (GCs) through OX1R, but potentiated those in amacrine cells (ACs) through OX2R. Consistently, in rat retinal slices orexin-A suppressed light-evoked AMPA-preferring receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents in GCs, but potentiated those in ACs. Intracellular dialysis of GDP-\u03b2-S or preincubation with the Gi/o inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX) abolished both the effects. Either cAMP/the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor Rp-cAMP or cGMP/the PKG blocker KT5823 failed to alter the orexin-A effects. Whilst both of them involved activation of protein kinase C (PKC), the effects on GCs and ACs were respectively eliminated by the phosphatidylinositol (PI)-phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor and phosphatidylcholine (PC)-PLC inhibitor. Moreover, in GCs orexin-A increased [Ca(2+)]i and the orexin-A effect was blocked by intracellular Ca(2+)-free solution and by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor antagonists. In contrast, orexin-A did not change [Ca(2+)]i in ACs and the orexin-A effect remained in intracellular or extracellular Ca(2+)-free solution. We conclude that a distinct Gi/o/PI-PLC/IP3/Ca(2+)-dependent PKC signaling pathway, following the activation of OX1R, is likely responsible for the orexin-A effect on GCs, whereas a Gi/o/PC-PLC/Ca(2+)-independent PKC signaling pathway, following the activation of OX2R, mediates the orexin-A effect on ACs. These two actions of orexin-A, while working in concert, provide a characteristic way for modulating information processing in the inner retina.", 
    "8": "Antiarrhythmic drug digoxin has been reported to have apoptosis-inducing and cytotoxic effects on prostate cancer cells. We evaluated the association between antiarrhythmic drug use and prostate cancer risk in a population-based case-control study. The study included all new prostate cancer cases diagnosed in Finland during 1995-2002 and matched controls (24,657 case-control pairs) obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry and the Population Register Center, respectively. Information on antiarrhythmic drug purchases was obtained from national prescription database. Multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression model was used for data analysis. Compared to never-users of antiarrhythmic drugs, we found no significant association between digoxin use and prostate cancer risk overall [odds ratio (OR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89-1.01] or for advanced prostate cancer risk (OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.77-1.05). The result was similar also for other antiarrhythmic drugs, with the exception of sotalol, users of which had decreased risk of advanced prostate cancer (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.56-0.96). Also the overall prostate cancer risk decreased by duration of sotalol use (p for trend 0.038). We show that digoxin or other common antiarrhythmic drugs generally do not associate with prostate cancer risk at population level during maximum follow-up of eight years. However, we cannot rule out longer term protective effects of digoxin. K(+) -channel blocker sotalol shows some promise as prostate cancer preventing agent. However, findings need to be confirmed in further studies.",

NSC was defined as the presence of at least 1 marker of myocardial injury. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the correlation of NSC and individual markers of myocardial injury with age, gender, medical comorbidities, medications, current smoking status, Hunt-Hess grade, and Fisher grade.

Despite intensive research, the precise mechanisms mediating its analgesic effects remain unclear. Here, we aimed to determine whether neurotoxic destruction of descending inhibitory pathways affect dipyrone-induced antinociception and whether various spinal serotonergic and adrenergic receptors are involved in this antinociception. The nociceptive response was assessed by the tail-flick test. Mice injected with dipyrone (150, 300, 600\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) elicited dose-related antinociception. The neurotoxins 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (50\u2009\u03bcg/mouse) and 6-hydroxydopamine (20\u2009\u03bcg/mouse) are applied intrathecally to deplete serotonin and noradrenaline in the spinal cord. 3 days after neurotoxin injections, a significant reduction in the antinociceptive effect of dipyrone was observed.

The PF nature eliminates preservative-related ocular surface changes, and improves tolerability. In clinical studies, the tafluprost/timolol FC was well tolerated. The side effects represented the typical side effects of the topical prostaglandin analogue class. The most common side effect, conjunctival hyperemia was mild, and occurred in only 6.4 - 8% of patients during 6 months of treatment. The figures for ocular irritation were also low (7.0 - 12.7%). The other side effects occurred only in very few patients. The frequency and severity of conjunctival hyperemia was lower than those published for most prostaglandin/timolol FCs.

We explored its pathogenesis through investigations of a patient and report the first case to be effectively treated with atenolol. A 36-year-old Indian female presented with idiopathic AP. Small-fiber neuropathy involving itch/pain-transmitting C-fibers appears to be pathogenetically important: compared with matched controls, our patient had increased intra-epidermal nerve fibers, raised warmth detection threshold, and marked hyperknesis to electrical stimulation. Autonomic nerve function tests and fingertips vasoconstriction response were normal, indicating integrity of other small (A\u03b4 and C) nerve fibers. She was initially treated with propranolol with good response, but was subsequently switched to atenolol for convenient once-a-day dosing. Symptoms were well controlled long term with no side effect experienced. Atenolol may exert its effect in AP through blockage of over-activated neuronal sodium channels. Through the investigations, we propose that the pathogenesis of idiopathic AP may involve the following: upon contact of the skin with water, yet-unknown mediator/s released stimulate dysfunctional and hyper-innervated C-nerve fibers, which may have resulted from a sodium channel defect. Atenolol may be a preferred therapeutic option compared with propanolol, in view of its convenient once-a-day dosing and better side effect profile.",

Children presenting with these manifestations need careful ophthalmological, cardiac and neurological assessment. They may have one or more of these extracutaneous manifestations, the most common being cerebral and cardiovascular anomalies. There is controversy about treating these children with propranolol especially if they have cerebrovascular involvement with narrow, dysplastic or absent blood vessels. The concern with propranolol is that hypotension may lead to reduced cerebral blood flow and neurological consequences. Prior to propranolol the systemic treatment for haemangiomas was prednisolone and then the concern was the opposite, namely hypertension. Our proposal was whether a combination of these two drugs would provide a safer and faster recovery. We report three retrospective cases of PHACES syndrome, each of whom received treatment with a combination of propranolol and prednisolone: two children were started on prednisolone and propranolol was added because the haemangiomas failed to respond adequately; the third child was started on propranolol and developed peripheral ischaemia and ulceration necessitating a reduction in dose addition of a low dose of prednisolone. All three patients, who failed on the one treatment, responded well to combination therapy without any significant complications. These outcomes suggest that for some patients with PHACES syndrome the use of combination treatment with propranolol and prednisolone could be advantageous, potentially allowing for the introduction of low doses of each with an enhanced combined effect.

The aim of this study was designed to investigate roles of norepinephrine (NE) and P2X receptor (P2XR) signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of hyperalgesia in a rat model of CP. CP was induced in male adult rats by intraductal injection of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Mechanical hyperalgesia was assessed by referred somatic behaviors to mechanical stimulation of rat abdomen. P2XR-mediated responses of pancreatic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were measured utilizing calcium imaging and whole cell patch-clamp-recording techniques. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence were performed to examine protein expression. TNBS injection produced a significant upregulation of P2X3R expression and an increase in ATP-evoked responses of pancreatic DRG neurons. The sensitization of P2X3Rs was reversed by administration of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol. Incubation of DRG neurons with NE significantly enhanced ATP-induced intracellular calcium signals, which were abolished by propranolol, and partially blocked by protein kinase A inhibitor H-89. Interestingly, TNBS injection led to a significant elevation of NE concentration in DRGs and the pancreas, an upregulation of \u03b22-adrenergic receptor expression in DRGs, and amplification of the NE-induced potentiation of ATP responses. Importantly, pancreatic hyperalgesia was markedly attenuated by administration of purinergic receptor antagonist suramin or A317491 or \u03b22-adrenergic receptor antagonist butoxamine. Sensitization of P2X3Rs, which was likely mediated by adrenergic signaling in primary sensory neurons, contributes to pancreatic pain, thus identifying a potential target for treating pancreatic pain caused by inflammation.",

Motility was evaluated by intraluminal pressure and video imaging of rat proximal colons in an organ bath. Distribution of KCNKs was investigated by RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. Current and membrane potential were evaluated with use of recombinant KCNK3- or KCNK9-expressing Xenopus oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Defecation frequency in rats was measured. HAS dose dependently induced strong propulsive \"squeezing\" motility, presumably as long-distance contraction (LDC). TRPV1/TRPA1 agonists induced different motility patterns. The effect of HAS was unaltered by TRPV1/TRPA1 antagonists and desensitization. Lidocaine (a nonselective KCNK blocker) and hydroxy-\u03b2 sanshool (a geometrical isomer of HAS and KCNK3 blocker) also induced colonic motility as a rhythmic propagating ripple (RPR) and a LDC-like motion, respectively. HAS-induced \"LDC,\" but not lidocaine-induced \"RPR,\" was abrogated by a neuroleptic agent tetrodotoxin. KCNK3 and KCNK9 were located mainly in longitudinal smooth muscle cells and in neural cells in the myenteric plexus, respectively.

    "108": "Pharmacological inhibitors are frequently used to identify the receptors, receptor subtypes, and associated signaling pathways involved in physiological cell responses. Based on the effects of such inhibitors conclusions are drawn about the involvement of their assumed target or lack thereof. While such inhibitors can be useful tools for a better physiological understanding, their uncritical use can lead to incorrect conclusions. This article reviews the concept of inhibitor selectivity and its implication for cell physiology. Specifically, we discuss the implications of using inhibitor vs. activator approaches, issues of direct vs. indirect pathway modulation, implications of inverse agonism and biased signaling, and those of orthosteric vs. allosteric, competitive vs. noncompetitive, and reversible vs. irreversible inhibition. Additional problems can result from inconsistent estimates of inhibitor potency and differences in potency between cell-free systems and intact cells. These concepts are illustrated by several examples of inhibitors displaying affinity for related but distinct targets or even unrelated targets. Of note, many of the issues being addressed are also applicable to genetic inhibition strategies. The main practical conclusion following from these concepts is that investigators should be critical in the choice of inhibitor, its concentrations, and its mode of application. When this advice is adhered to, small-molecule pharmacological inhibitors can be important experimental tools in the hand of physiologists.",

In the present study, we retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 9242 patients with essential hypertension referred to our Hypertension Unit. We analysed data on supine and standing blood pressure values, age, sex, severity of hypertension and therapeutic associations of drugs, commonly used in the treatment of hypertension. OH was present in 957 patients (10.4%). Drug combinations including \u03b1-blockers, centrally acting drugs, non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers and diuretics were associated with OH. These pharmacological associations must be administered with caution, especially in hypertensive patients at high risk of OH (elderly or with severe and uncontrolled hypertension).

    "110": "The development of a chiral electrochemical sensor using an electrogenerated molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)-based ultrathin film using R(+)-atenolol (ATNL) as a template was reported. The proposed sensor exhibited distinctive enantiospecific oxidation peaks toward the R-antipodes of four \u03b2-blocker representatives and additional oxidation peaks common to both enantiomers of each studied \u03b2-blocker, allowing thus the simultaneous analysis of all of their enantiomers in a single analysis. The specific preconditioning of the polymer by alternative exposure to aqueous and nonaqueous medium was proven to be essential for the chiral recognition ability of the obtained sensor. The rebinding property of the MIP film was studied by using a well-known redox probe, a change in the morphology and diffusive permeability of the thin polymeric layer in the presence of its template being observed. The applicability of the optimized analytical procedure was demonstrated by the analysis of ATNL's enantiomers in the range of 1.88 \u00d7 10(-7)-1.88 \u00d7 10(-5) mol/L. The developed polymeric interface is the first reported transductor of a chiral electrochemical sensor able to exhibit simultaneous enantiospecificity toward several \u03b2-blocker representatives extensively used in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields, offering good prospects in the simple, cost-effective, and fast assessment of their enantiomeric ratio and total concentration.",

To determine whether beta blockers can also prevent dextrose-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in addition to their antioxidative effects, human coronary artery endothelial cells and hepatocyte-derived HepG2 cells were treated with 27.5 mM dextrose for 24 hours in the presence of carvedilol (a lipophilic beta blockers with alpha blocking activity), propranolol (a lipophilic nonselective beta blockers), and atenolol (a water-soluble selective beta blockers), and ER stress, oxidative, stress and cell death were measured. ER stress was measured using the placental alkaline phosphatase assay and Western blot analysis of glucose regulated protein 78, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), phospho-JNK, eukaryotic initiating factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), and phospho-eIF2\u03b1 and measurement of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA splicing using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.

These drugs are cathinone derivatives and are classified chemically as \u03b2-ketoamphetamines. Because of their close structural similarity to the amphetamines, methylone, MDPV, and mephedrone share most of their pharmacological, neurochemical, and behavioral properties. One point of divergence in their actions is the ability to cause damage to the CNS. Unlike methamphetamine, the \u03b2-ketoamphetamines do not damage dopamine (DA) nerve endings. However, mephedrone has been shown to significantly accentuate methamphetamine neurotoxicity. Bath salt formulations contain numerous different psychoactive ingredients, and individuals who abuse bath salts also coabuse other illicit drugs. Therefore, we have evaluated the effects of methylone, MDPV, mephedrone, and methamphetamine on DA nerve endings. The \u03b2-ketoamphetamines alone or in all possible two-drug combinations do not result in damage to DA nerve endings but do cause hyperthermia. MDPV completely protects against the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine while methylone accentuates it. Neither MDPV nor methylone attenuates the hyperthermic effects of methamphetamine. The potent neuroprotective effects of MDPV extend to amphetamine-, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-, and MPTP-induced neurotoxicity. These results indicate that \u03b2-ketoamphetamine drugs that are non-substrate blockers of the DA transporter (i.e., MDPV) protect against methamphetamine neurotoxicity, whereas those that are substrates for uptake by the DA transporter and which cause DA release (i.e., methylone, mephedrone) accentuate neurotoxicity. METH (a) enters DA nerve endings via the DAT, causes leakage of DA into the cytoplasm and then into the synapse via DAT-mediated reverse transport. Methylone (METHY) and mephedrone (MEPH; b), like METH, are substrates for the DAT but release DA from cytoplasmic pools selectively. When METH is combined with METHY or MEPH (c), DA efflux and neurotoxicity are enhanced. MDPV (d), which is a non-substrate blocker of the DAT, prevents METH uptake and efflux of DA. Therefore, bath salts that are substrates for the DAT and release DA (METHY, MEPH) accentuate METH neurotoxicity, whereas those that are non-substrate blockers of the DAT (MDPV) are neuroprotective.",

A total of 105 AEs occurred in 92 patients: QTc prolongation or ventricular tachyarrhythmia in 70 patients (67% of AEs), bradyarrhythmias in 35 patients (33% of AEs), with some experiencing both AE types. Ventricular arrhythmias were seen in 23 patients (7%) and torsades de pointes in one (0.3%). Total AE rates were similar between drugs (P = 0.09); however, DF patients had more QTc prolongation or ventricular arrhythmias (P = 0.001). In SL patients, there were no predictors for QTc prolongation or ventricular proarrhythmia. In DF patients, higher baseline QTc interval (odds ratio = 1.64/25 ms, P = 0.01) was an independent predictor of QTc prolongation or ventricular proarrhythmias. For patients without proarrhythmia risk factors, overall AE rate was 26%.",

One challenging problem in using MIPs for sensor development is the lack of reliable conjugation chemistry that allows MIPs to be fixed on transducer surface. In this work, we study the use of epoxy silane to immobilize MIP nanoparticles on model transducer surfaces without impairing the function of the immobilized nanoparticles. The MIP nanoparticles with a core-shell structure have selective molecular binding sites in the core and multiple amino groups in the shell. The model transducer surface is functionalized with a self-assembled monolayer of epoxy silane, which reacts with the core-shell MIP particles to enable straightforward immobilization. The whole process is characterized by studying the treated surfaces after each preparation step using atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, contact angle measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The microscopy results show that the MIP particles are immobilized uniformly on surface. The photoelectron spectroscopy results further confirm the action of each functionalization step. The molecular selectivity of the MIP-functionalized surface is verified by radioligand binding analysis. The particle immobilization approach described here has a general applicability for constructing selective chemical sensors in different formats.",

The present study aimed therefore to investigate possible protective effect of eprosartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, on high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced early diabetic nephropathy in rats and various mechanisms underlie this effect. Male Wistar rats with type 2 diabetes induced by high-fat diet/streptozotocin were treated with eprosartan at the dose levels of 30 and 60mg/kg daily for 5 weeks. Eprosartan induced a nephroprotective effect as evident by the significant decrease in serum creatinine, urea, total cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels, urinary albumin excretion and kidney index as well as renal levels of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide products (nitrite/nitrate), in addition to angiotensin II, inducible nitric oxide synthase, transforming growth factor-\u03b21 and collagen IV expressions with a concurrent increase in renal levels of reduced glutathione and catalase activity compared to diabetic untreated rats. Histopathological examination confirmed the renoprotective effect of eprosartan. In conclusion, eprosartan protects rats against high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced early diabetic nephropathy possibly, in part, through its antioxidant effect as well as by abrogating the overexpression of angiotensin II, inducible nitric oxide synthase, transforming growth factor-\u03b21 and collagen IV.",

The Dahl salt-sensitive rat is a paradigm of salt-sensitive hypertension associated with local activation of the renin-angiotensin system. In these studies, we determined whether: (1) salt-sensitive hypertension is associated with renal expression of ETS-1 and (2) ETS-1 participates in the development of end-organ injury in salt-sensitive hypertension. Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed a normal-salt diet (0.5% NaCl diet) or a high-salt diet (4% NaCl) for 4 weeks. Separate groups on high-salt diet received an ETS-1 dominant-negative peptide (10 mg/kg/d), an inactive ETS-1 mutant peptide (10 mg/kg/d), the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker candesartan (10 mg/kg/d), or the combination high-salt diet/dominant-negative peptide/angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker for 4 weeks. High-salt diet rats had a significant increase in the glomerular expression of the phosphorylated ETS-1 that was prevented by angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker. ETS-1 blockade reduced proteinuria, glomerular injury score, fibronectin expression, urinary transforming growth factor-\u03b2 excretion, and macrophage infiltration. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker reduced proteinuria, glomerular injury score, and macrophage infiltration, whereas concomitant ETS-1 blockade and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker had additive effects and reduced interstitial fibrosis. Our studies demonstrated that salt-sensitive hypertension results in increased glomerular expression of phosphorylated ETS-1 and suggested that ETS-1 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of end-organ injury in salt-sensitive hypertension.",

    "155": "Propranolol, a chiral drug with two configurations, i.e., (R)-propranolol hydrochloride (RPH) and (S)-propranolol hydrochloride (SPH), has racemes that can be used in clinical diagnosis due to their synergistic effects. SPH has a \u03b2-receptor blocking effect, and RPH has an antiarrhythmic effect. In pH 4.6 Britton-Robinson (BR) buffer solution, both RPH and SPH can react with erythrosine B to form 1:1 ion-association complexes. In the SPH-Ery B reaction system, a remarkable enhancement of the resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS) signal located at 338 nm was observed. However, a similar phenomenon was not obvious and was unstable in the RPH-Ery B reaction system. Based on this result, a simple, novel and sensitive method for the determination of SPH was proposed based on the RRS technique. The linear range and limit of detection were 0.0680~4.0 \u00b5g mL(-1) and 20.6 ng mL(-1), respectively. Additionally, the spectroscopic approaches of frequency doubling scattering (FDS) and second-order scattering (SOS) were also proposed for SPH detection in this article. The interaction information regarding the mechanism of the reaction, suitable reaction conditions, influencing factors and the effects of mixed solutions were our investigation aims. The method had been applied to the determination of SPH in fresh serum and urine samples of healthy human subjects with satisfactory results.",

Next, we examined whether the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors induced by d-cycloserine (DCS, 5 mg/kg i.p., a NMDA partial agonist) before memory reactivation can facilitate the disruptive effect of PROP and MDZ on fear memory in ETOH rats.",

Although intra-basolateral amygdala (BLA; 1.25 ug/side) and systemic PROP administration attenuated fear memory in DCS pre-treated ETOH rats, DCS/MDZ treatment did not affect memory in these animals. Finally, a decrease of both total and surface protein expression of the \u03b11 GABAA receptor (GABAA-R) subunit in BLA was found in the ETOH rats.",

The TM liposome was produced by the reverse evaporation technique coupled with pH-gradients method (REVPR), and then was incorporated into deacetylated gellan gum gels. The TM liposome was demonstrated to be a round and uniform shape in TEM pictures. Compared with the TM eye drops, the TM liposome produced a 1.93 folds increase in apparent permeability coefficients (Papp), resulting in a significant increase of the corneal penetration. The TM-loaded liposome incorporated ion sensitive in situ gels (TM L-ISG) showed longer retention time on corneal surface compared with the eye drops using gamma scintigraphy technology. Draize testing showed that TM L-ISG was non-irritant for ocular tissues. The biggest efficacy of TM L-ISG occurred 30 min after eye drops administration, and efficacy disappeared after 240min. Then, compared with the eye drops, the optimal TM L-ISG could quickly reduce the intraocular pressure and the effective time was significantly longer (P\u22640.05). These results indicate that liposome incorporated ion sensitive in situ gels have a potential ability for the opthalmic delivery.",

SHR were treated for 3 months, and then the penile erection and sexual behavior were detected. After BP recording, SHR were killed to evaluate the organ-damage, weight of accessory sex organs and levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone in serum. Five drugs had the similar efficacy on BP reduction. All drugs except of enalapril, significantly prolonged the mount latency, and decreased the mount frequency (P<0.05). Clonidine also reduced the conception rate (45% vs. 80% in control group, P<0.05). Amlodipine and dihydrochlorothiazide significantly increased the testosterone level (0.79\u00b10.30, 0.80\u00b10.34 vs. 0.49\u00b10.20 in control group, unit: ng/dl, P<0.05).

Methods, 2014, 6, 5038] where it was reported that the use of RGO provided significant improvements in the electroanalytical signal in comparison to a bare (unmodified) glassy carbon electrode. We demonstrate, for the first time, that the electroanalytical quantification of pindolol is actually possible using bare (unmodified) screen-printed graphite electrodes (SPEs). This paper addresses the electroanalytical determination of pindolol utilising RGO modified SPEs. Surprisingly, it is found that bare (unmodified) SPEs provide superior electrochemical signatures over that of RGO modified SPEs. Consequently the electroanalytical sensing of pindolol is explored at bare unmodified SPEs where a linear range between 0.1 \u03bcM-10.0 \u03bcM is found to be possible whilst offering a limit of detection (3\u03c3) corresponding to 0.097 \u03bcM. This provides a convenient yet analytically sensitive method for sensing pindolol. The optimised electroanalytical protocol using the unmodified SPEs, which requires no pre-treatment (electrode polishing) or electrode modification step (such as with the use of RGO), was then further applied to the determination of pindolol in urine samples. This work demonstrates that the use of RGO modified SPEs have no significant benefits when compared to the bare (unmodified) alternative and that the RGO free electrode surface can provide electro-analytically useful performances.",

Aortic root dilation and mitral valve prolapse are the main presentations among the cardiovascular malformations of MFS. The revised Ghent diagnostics nosology of Marfan syndrome is established in accordance with a combination of major and minor clinical manifestations in various organ systems and the family history. The pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome has not been fully elucidated. However, fibrillin-1 gene mutations are believed to exert a dominant negative effect. The treatment includes prophylactic \u03b2-blockers and angiotensin II-receptor blockers in order to slow down the dilation of the ascending aorta and prophylactic aortic surgery. Importantly, \u03b2-blocker therapy may reduce TGF-\u03b2 activation, which has been recognized as a contributory factor in MFS. The identification of a mutation allows for early diagnosis, prognosis, genetic counseling, preventive management of carriers and reassurance for unaffected relatives.

One major drawback is the lack of relevant apical incubation fluids allowing mimicking luminal conditions in the GIT. Here, we suggest a culture model compatible with biorelevant media, namely Fasted State Simulated Intestinal Fluid (FaSSIF) and Fed State Simulated Intestinal Fluid (FeSSIF). Co-culture was set up from Caco-2 and mucus-secreting HT29-MTX cells using an original seeding procedure. Viability and cytotoxicity assays were performed following incubation of FeSSIF and FaSSIF with co-culture. Influence of biorelevant fluids on paracellular permeability or transporter proteins were also evaluated. Results were compared with Caco-2 and HT29-MTX monocultures. While Caco-2 viability was strongly affected with FeSSIF, no toxic effect was detected for the co-cultures in terms of viability and lactate dehydrogenase release. The addition of FeSSIF to the basolateral compartment of the co-culture induced cytotoxic effects which suggested the apical mucus barrier being cell protective. In contrast to FeSSIF, FaSSIF induced a slight increase of the paracellular transport and both tested media inhibited partially the P-gp-mediated efflux in the co-culture. Additionally, the absorptive transport of propranolol hydrochloride, a lipophilic \u03b2-blocker, was strongly affected by biorelevant fluids. This study demonstrated the compatibility of the Caco-2/HT29-MTX model with some of the current biorelevant media.

The present study examined the function of cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (CBS)/hydrogen sulfide system in the RVLM, which plays a crucial role in the control of blood pressure and sympathetic nerve activity. Adenovirus vectors encoding CBS (AdCBS) or enhanced green fluorescent protein (AdEGFP) were transfected into the RVLM in normotensive rats. Identical microinjection of AdCBS into the RVLM had no effect on systolic blood pressure and heart rate (HR) in conscious rats. Acute experiments were performed at day 7 after gene transfer in anesthetized rats. Microinjection of the CBS inhibitors hydroxylamine (HA) or amino-oxyacetate into the RVLM produced an increase in the renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and HR. There was a potentiation of the increases in RSNA, MAP, and HR because of the CBS inhibitors in AdCBS-injected rats compared with AdEGFP-injected rats. Pretreatment with pinacidil, a ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel activator, abolished the effects of HA in two groups. Microinjection of glibenclamide, a KATP channel blocker, produced increases in RSNA, MAP, and HR in AdCBS-injected rats. No changes in behavior were observed in AdEGFP-injected rats. Furthermore, Western blot analysis indicated an increase in the expression of sulfonylurea receptor 2 and inward rectifier K(+) 6.1 in AdCBS-injected rats. These results suggest that the increase in KATP channels in the RVLM may be responsible for the greater sympathetic outflow and pressor effect of HA in AdCBS-injected rats compared with AdEGFP-injected rats.",

    "198": "New users of antidiabetic agents were identified with a 1-year washout period between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2005, in Saskatchewan, Canada, and were followed until December 31, 2008. Within this population-based cohort, persons were classified as users of benefit or non-benefit thiazolidinediones (TZDs) according to their first prescription record between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2006 (non-benefit prescription records were not captured before 2006). An intention-to-treat approach was used to categorize TZD exposure over time. We evaluated the potential bias introduced by drug exposure misclassification by evaluating bootstrapped differences in hazard ratio (HR) estimates of all-cause hospitalization or death between users and nonusers of TZDs obtained from analyses that contained complete drug use (non-benefit and benefit drug use) versus benefit drug use only (non-benefit drug use was misclassified as unexposed). All analyses were replicated within the same cohort of new users of antidiabetic agents for clopidogrel and \u03b2-blocker (bisoprolol or carvedilol) users versus nonusers because these agents were also subject to exposure misclassification from non-benefit drug use during the period of the study.",

The crude HR for hospitalization or death among TZD users versus nonusers was higher in a database that contained benefit-only prescriptions than in a database that contained all prescriptions (HR = 1.11 [95% CI, 1.05-1.18] vs HR = 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94-1.04]). However, the differences in HRs after adjustment for demographic characteristics, health care utilization, comorbidities, and medications suggested minimal bias was introduced when TZD exposure was misclassified in the benefit-only database (adjusted HR [aHR] = 1.04 [95% CI. 0.98-1.10] vs aHR = 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94-1.04]; bootstrapped aHR difference = +0.05 [95% CI, 0.02-0.08]). Minimal differences in aHRs were also observed within analyses of clopidogrel (1551 users [24% non-benefit]; bootstrapped aHR difference = +0.01 [95% CI, -0.04 to 0.06]) and \u03b2-blocker users (351 users [42% non-benefit]; bootstrapped aHR difference = +0.06 [95% CI, -0.09 to 0.20]) versus nonusers.",

There were no differences in postoperative inotropic support, antiarrhythmic drug use, need for oral anticoagulation, and complication rates.

Carvedilol reduces mortality in LV failure and improves RV function in experimental pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, its impact on ventricular-ventricular interactions and LV function in RV afterload is unknown. We investigated effects of carvedilol on biventricular fibrosis and function in a rat model of persistent PAH. Rats were randomized into three groups: Sham controls, PAH, and PAH\u2009+\u2009carvedilol. Severe PAH was induced by 60 mg/kg subcutaneous monocrotaline. In the treatment group, oral carvedilol (15 mg/kg/day) was started 2 weeks after monocrotaline injection and continued for 3 weeks until the terminal experiment. Echocardiography and exercise performance were performed at baseline and repeated at the terminal experiment with hemodynamic measurements. LV and RV myocardium were analyzed for hypertrophy, fibrosis, and molecular signaling by protein and mRNA analysis.

Prazosin or yohimbine treatment did not significantly influence the NE+hypoxia effect. The combination of prazosin and yohimbine or propranolol alone inhibited the effect of NE+hypoxia. BRL37344 (\u03b23 receptor agonist) mimicked the NE effect. In contrast, the incubation with \u03b23 receptor blocker did not influence the mentioned effect.

    "215": "Infantile hemangioma (IH), the most common tumor of infancy, is characterized by an initial proliferation during infancy followed by spontaneous involution over the next 5-10\u2009years, often leaving a fibro-fatty residuum. IH is traditionally considered a tumor of the microvasculature. However, recent data show the critical role of stem cells in the biology of IH with emerging evidence suggesting an embryonic developmental anomaly due to aberrant proliferation and differentiation of a hemogenic endothelium with a neural crest phenotype that possesses the capacity for endothelial, hematopoietic, mesenchymal, and neuronal differentiation. Current evidence suggests a putative placental chorionic mesenchymal core cell embolic origin of IH during the first trimester. This review outlines the emerging role of stem cells and their interplay with the cytokine niche that promotes a post-natal environment conducive for vasculogenesis involving VEGFR-2 and its ligand VEGF-A and the IGF-2 ligand in promoting cellular proliferation, and the TRAIL-OPG anti-apoptotic pathway in preventing cellular apoptosis in IH. The discovery of the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the biology of IH provides a plausible explanation for the programed biologic behavior and the \u03b2-blocker-induced accelerated involution of this enigmatic condition. This crucially involves the vasoactive peptide, angiotensin II, that promotes cellular proliferation in IH predominantly via its action on the ATIIR2 isoform. The role of the RAS in the biology of IH is further supported by the effect of captopril, an ACE inhibitor, in inducing accelerated involution of IH. The discovery of the critical role of RAS in IH represents a novel and fascinating paradigm shift in the understanding of human development, IH, and other tumors in general.",

Although effective treatment is available for AMI, access to treatment is dictated by cost and ability to pay. With scarce treatment resources, healthcare decisions are guided by local cost-effectiveness, for which country-level data are lacking.", 
    "217": "We calculate the cost-effectiveness of policies that expand the use of aspirin, injection streptokinase, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins for the treatment and secondary prevention of AMI in India. We also estimate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical polypill (combining aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins) for secondary prevention.", 
    "218": "We conduct cost-effectiveness analyses of AMI treatment and secondary prevention for patients with previous coronary heart disease events in India. We estimate coronary heart disease events using Framingham risk scores and disease prevalence using a cohort ordinary differential model. Other parameter estimates are from the literature. Polypill treatment is assumed to cost less than the additive cost of all 4 oral medications, but it is not assumed to increase adherence. We conduct a Latin hypercube sampling sensitivity analysis on the model parameters.", 
    "219": "Increasing coverage of AMI treatment with aspirin and streptokinase would be cost-effective and could avert approximately 335,000 (191,000 to 503,000) disability-adjusted life years among 30- to 69-year-olds in India. Secondary prevention with aspirin and beta-blockers at 80% coverage (and at lower rates) would be highly cost-effective, and the addition of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors would also be cost-effective. Introducing the polypill dominates a strategy of a 4-drug regimen with the aforementioned drugs and statins. The cost-effectiveness ratio of 80% coverage with the polypill would be $1,690 ($1,220 to $2,410) per disability-adjusted life years averted.",

    "227": "Increasing availability of high-dimensional clinical data, which improves the ability to define more specific phenotypes, as well as molecular data, which can elucidate disease mechanisms, is a driving force and at the same time a major challenge for translational and personalized medicine. Successful research in this field requires an approach that ties together specific disease and health expertise with understanding of molecular data through statistical methods. We present PEAX (Phenotype-Expression Association eXplorer), built upon open-source software, which integrates visual phenotype model definition with statistical testing of expression data presented concurrently in a web-browser. The integration of data and analysis tasks in a single tool allows clinical domain experts to obtain new insights directly through exploration of relationships between multivariate phenotype models and gene expression data, showing the effects of model definition and modification while also exploiting potential meaningful associations between phenotype and miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships. We combine the web visualization capabilities of Shiny and D3 with the power and speed of R for backend statistical analysis, in order to abstract the scripting required for repetitive analysis of sub-phenotype association. We describe the motivation for PEAX, demonstrate its utility through a use case involving heart failure research, and discuss computational challenges and observations. We show that our visual web-based representations are well-suited for rapid exploration of phenotype and gene expression association, facilitating insight and discovery by domain experts.", 
    "228": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a critical role in regulating vascular inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. Early growth response-1 (Egr-1) is an immediate early gene that acts as a master switch for the inflammatory response. However, the role of Ang II in regulating Egr-1 expression in macrophages, and the effect of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) ligand 15d-PGJ2 in this process remain to be investigated.", 
    "229": "We showed that Ang II significantly up-regulated the expression of Egr-1 in RAW264.7 macrophages, and this effect was markedly attenuated by Eprosartan (an AT1R blocker), SP600125 (a JNK-specific inhibitor) and PD98059 (an ERK-specific inhibitor). Moreover, treatment of macrophages with 15d-PGJ2, a natural PPAR-\u03b3 ligand, significantly reduced Ang II-induced expression of Egr-1 and its inflammatory gene targets (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2, MCP-1 and ICAM-1) through PPAR-\u03b3 activation and ROS formation. In addition, 15d-PGJ2 treatment markedly inhibited Ang II-induced macrophage migration and proliferation.", 
    "230": "This study for the first time demonstrates that Ang II can induce the expression of Egr-1 via AT1R/JNK and ERK signaling pathways. Activation of PPAR-\u03b3 by 15d-PGJ2 suppresses Egr-1-mediated proinflammatory response, and may be a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of vascular inflammatory diseases.", 
    "231": "In reversed-phase liquid chromatography in the absence of additives, cationic basic compounds give rise to broad and asymmetrical peaks as a result of ionic interactions with residual free silanols on silica-based stationary phases. Ionic liquids (ILs), added to the mobile phase, have been suggested as alternatives to amines to block the activity of silanols. However, the dual character of ILs should be considered: both cation and anion may be adsorbed on the stationary phase, thereby creating a double asymmetrical layer positively or negatively charged, depending on the relative adsorption of both ions. In this work, a study of the performance of six imidazolium-based ILs (the chlorides and tetrafluoroborates of 1-ethyl-, 1-butyl- and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium) as modifiers of the chromatographic behaviour of a group of 10 \u03b2-blockers is performed, and compared with triethylamine and dimethyloctylamine. In order to gain more insight in the behaviour of ILs in RPLC, the changes in the nature of the chromatographic system, at increasing concentration of the additives, were followed based on retention and peak shape modelling. The multiple interactions that amines and ILs experience inside the chromatographic system suggest that the suppressing potency should be measured based on the shape of chromatographic peaks and not on the changes in retention. The ILs 1-hexyl-3-methyl-imidazolium chloride and tetrafluoroborate offered the most interesting features for the separation of the basic drugs.", 
    "232": "Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome who retain maximal alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) have better clinical outcomes. The release of endogenous catecholamines associated with shock or the administration of \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) agonists enhances AFC via a 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent mechanism. The authors have previously reported that transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and interleukin-8 (IL-8), two major mediators of alveolar inflammation associated with the early phase of acute respiratory distress syndrome, inhibit AFC upregulation by \u03b22AR agonists via a phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent mechanism. However, whether TGF-\u03b21 and IL-8 cause an additive or synergistic inhibition of AFC is unclear. Thus, the central hypothesis of the study was to determine whether they synergistically inhibit the \u03b22AR-stimulated AFC by activating two different isoforms of PI3K.", 
    "233": "The effects of TGF-\u03b21 or IL-8 on \u03b22AR agonist-stimulated net alveolar fluid transport were studied using short-circuit current studies. Molecular pathways of inhibition were confirmed by pharmacologic inhibitors and Western blotting of p-Akt, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2, protein kinase C-\u03b6, and phospho-\u03b22AR. Finally, our observations were confirmed by an in vivo model of AFC.",

This effect was explained by activation of different isoforms of PI3K by TGF-\u03b21 and IL-8/cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (n = 12 in each group). Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of TGF-\u03b21 on 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate-stimulated alveolar epithelial fluid transport required the presence of IL-8/cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (n = 12 in each group). Inhibition of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 prevented TGF-\u03b21-mediated heterologous \u03b22AR downregulation and restored physiologic \u03b22AR agonist-stimulated AFC in rats (n = 6 in each group).", 
    "235": "TGF-\u03b21 and IL-8 have a synergistic inhibitory effect on \u03b22AR-mediated stimulation of pulmonary edema removal by the alveolar epithelium. This result may, in part, explain why a large proportion of the patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome have impaired AFC."
