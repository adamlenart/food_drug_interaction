It has been established that long-term using of finoptin and obzidane medication to intact animals does not affect cardiac hystiocytes. Finoptin can increase the thickness of the glycocalix layer and partly block Ca2+ -binding locus of plasmolemma. Obzidane introduction enables to ensure constant energy-efficient, plastic and membrane-stabilizing effect. The medications use resulted in forming favorable initial conditions for increase in myocardium resistance to coronary insufficiency.", 
    "1": "Chronic disease is the leading cause of illness, disability, and death in the United States, affecting nearly 100 million Americans. Heart failure alone affects nearly 4.9 million Americans, with another 550,000 newly diagnosed cases each year. The aim of this study was to investigate the program effects of a heart failure care support program. A two-group cohort study matching on propensity scores was used to investigate 277 heart failure care support program participants and corresponding matched non-participants. Measures used were rates of hospitalizations, emergency department visits, physician office visits, and heart failure-related prescription drug use and procedures. Relative to the matched control group, program participants experienced 26.3% (p = 0.023) fewer inpatient admissions, 37.9% (p = 0.018) inpatient bed days, 33.3% (p = 0.059) more beta blocker use, 76.7% (p = 0.048) more alpha blocker use, 22.2% (p = 0.006) more lipid panels, 13.4% (p = 0.019) more electrocardiographies, 50.0% (p = 0.008) fewer cardiac catheterizations, and 94.6% (p = 0.014) more pneumonia vaccinations. The current study employs a propensity score matching methodology to select a subset of comparison patients most comparable to treatment patients, and documents the beneficial health services outcomes of participation in a heart failure care support program.", 
    "2": "There is increasing evidence that combination therapy should be emphasized more than it is at present for the initial treatment of hypertensive patients. Recent guidelines acknowledge the value of combination therapy, although some treatment algorithms fail to echo this message. Observations from major clinical trials in the elderly, diabetics, stroke patients, and African Americans all indicate that combination therapy is necessary to control blood pressure in the majority of these patients. Several combination therapies such as an angiotensin II receptor blocker and a diuretic, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with a diuretic, a beta blocker with a diuretic, or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with a calcium antagonist have been shown to be effective in patients who do not respond to monotherapy. The current review focuses on the newest such combination; an angiotensin II receptor blocker and a diuretic may have an added advantage of being well tolerated. Recent studies have shown that angiotensin II receptor blockers, given alone or combined with a diuretic, may prevent some cardiovascular outcomes independent of their blood pressure-lowering efficacy.", 
    "3": "Increasing evidence suggests that amyloid peptides associated with a variety of degenerative diseases induce neurotoxicity in their intermediate oligomeric state, rather than as monomers or fibrils. To test this hypothesis and investigate the possible involvement of Ca2+ signaling disruptions in amyloid-induced cytotoxicity, we made homogeneous preparations of disease-related amyloids (Abeta, prion, islet amyloid polypeptide, polyglutamine, and lysozyme) in various aggregation states and tested their actions on fluo-3-loaded SH-SY5Y cells. Application of oligomeric forms of all amyloids tested (0.6-6 microg ml-1) rapidly (approximately 5 s) elevated intracellular Ca2+, whereas equivalent amounts of monomers and fibrils did not. Ca2+ signals evoked by Abeta42 oligomers persisted after depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, and small signals remained in Ca2+-free medium, indicating contributions from both extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ sources. The increased membrane permeability to Ca2+ cannot be attributed to activation of endogenous Ca2+ channels, because responses were unaffected by the potent Ca2+-channel blocker cobalt (20 microm). Instead, observations that Abeta42 and other oligomers caused rapid cellular leakage of anionic fluorescent dyes point to a generalized increase in membrane permeability. The resulting unregulated flux of ions and molecules may provide a common mechanism for oligomer-mediated toxicity in many amyloidogenic diseases, with dysregulation of Ca2+ ions playing a crucial role because of their strong trans-membrane concentration gradient and involvement in cell dysfunction and death.", 
    "4": "Nitric oxide (NO) is an important and widespread physiological mediator. Both excess tissue NO and its deficiency have been implicated in the development of several disease states. It is therefore of great therapeutic value that appropriate pharmacological treatments are made available to either promote or inhibit NO production. This review will focus on the main areas of pharmaceutical development and application; these include the different types of NO donor treatments currently in use, inhibition of nitric oxide synthase and gene therapy. Furthermore, the recent pharmaceutical developments for the promotion of NO production and the problems associated with NO inhibitors will also be discussed. During the next few years it will become apparent whether manipulation of NO has multiple therapeutic applications or whether the diversity of effects renders intervention too non-specific.", 
    "5": "Daphnia magna, Desmodesmus subspicatus and Lemna minor were used to determine the ecotoxicity of beta-blockers. Propranolol was the most toxic substance, with EC50s of 7.7 mg l-1 in the Daphnia test and 0.73 mg l-1 in the algal test. The toxicity of atenolol and metoprolol in the Daphnia test was very low, with EC50s of 313 and 438 mg l-1, respectively. In the algal test, metoprolol (EC50: 7.9 mg l-1) was more toxic than atenolol (EC50: 620 mg l-1). Lemna minor was the least sensitive species. All substances showed PEC/PNEC ratios <1, whereas propranolol with a ratio of 0.81 seems to be the most relevant substance and I recommend to perform chronic biotests to refine the estimate of the environmental risk. Taking bioconcentration factors (BCF) into account, resulting internal effect concentrations (IEC) differ only slightly, which means that the differences in the EC50 depend mainly on the diverse logP levels causing narcosis via disruption of membrane integrity. Predictions of toxicity using ECOSAR were close to the empirically measured data. Mixture toxicity of the three compounds could be predicted accurately using the concept of concentration addition.",

    "8": "Under resting conditions, parasympathetic and sympathetic control of the heart and coronary circulation were similar in MI and normal swine. In contrast, during exercise of MI compared to normal swine, (i) there was a more pronounced gradual inhibition of parasympathetic control of heart rate with increasing exercise intensity; (ii) circulating catecholamines increased excessively, resulting in an increased beta-adrenergic influence on heart rate, while (iii) the beta-adrenergic influence on global left ventricular contractility was decreased, reflecting a blunted left ventricular beta-adrenergic responsiveness. Furthermore, (iv) an alpha-adrenergic vasoconstrictor influence was absent in the anterior LV wall of both MI and normal swine, while (v) the beta-adrenergic vasodilator influence in the coronary circulation was not different between normal and MI swine, which, in conjunction with the elevated catecholamine levels during exercise, suggests a diminished beta-adrenergic responsiveness of coronary resistance vessels within remote non-infarcted myocardium in MI swine.",

Half the animals had been subjected to neonatal hypoxia (FiO(2)=0.12, days 1-10) while the others had not. The peak response of left ventricular pressure (LVP) and the maximum rate of pressure increase (+dP/dtmax) were measured in isolated and perfused hearts during application of dobutamine, isoproterenol, milrinone and betaxolol. Left ventricular myocyte membranes were analyzed for beta receptor density, adenylyl cyclase activity and content.", 
    "12": "LVP and +dP/dtmax responses to stimulation with dobutamine and isoproterenol were significantly impaired in adult hearts of neonatally hypoxic rats. The inotropic effect of dobutamine was abolished by blockade with the beta(1)-selective antagonist betaxolol. The inotropic effects of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor milrinone were also significantly decreased in neonatally hypoxic adult hearts. There was no difference in left ventricular myocyte membrane beta receptor density of adult hearts whether they were hypoxic neonatally or not. However, left ventricular adenylyl cyclase activity on isoproterenol or forskolin stimulation and adenylyl cyclase levels (type V/VI) were significantly reduced in neonatally hypoxic adult hearts.",

    "15": "Using data from a large United States health-insurance claims database, we conducted a retrospective study to compare the risks of death and hospitalization and the cost of inpatient care in heart failure patients receiving carvedilol vs. metoprolol tartrate. The sample consisted of all patients with a prescription for carvedilol or metoprolol tartrate between September 1997 and August 2000 who also had a prior medical encounter with a primary diagnosis of heart failure, prior prescriptions for a loop diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and no prior prescriptions for a beta-blocker.",

Controlling for baseline characteristics using a Cox proportional hazards model, carvedilol was independently associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.78; 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.99) and all-cause hospitalization (hazard ratio 0.77; 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.90). In a propensity-matched sample of carvedilol and metoprolol tartrate patients (n = 564 each), expected costs of inpatient care at 36 months were 10,509 US dollars lower with carvedilol (95% confidence interval 2934-18,085 US dollars).",

    "18": "In vertebrate olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), the odorant-triggered receptor current flows through two distinct ion channels on the sensory cilia: Ca2+ influx through a cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel followed by Cl- efflux through a Ca2+-activated anion channel. The excitatory Cl- current amplifies the small CNG current and crucially depends on a high intracellular Cl- concentration. We show here that a (Na+)-(K+)-(2Cl-) cotransporter, NKCC1, is required for this Cl- current, in that ORNs deficient in Nkcc1 or incubated with an NKCC blocker (bumetanide) lack the Cl- current. Surprisingly, immunocytochemistry indicates that NKCC1 is located on the somata and dendrites of ORNs rather than the cilia, where transduction occurs. This topography is remarkably similar to the situation in secretory epithelial cells, where basolateral Cl- uptake and apical Cl- efflux facilitate transepithelial fluid movement. Thus, a single functional architecture serves two entirely different purposes, probably underscoring the epithelial origin of the ORNs.", 
    "19": "We sought to identify the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients who had advanced heart failure and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) in the beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST) and to investigate whether bucindolol alters the risk of developing nonfatal MI. Of the 2,708 patients enrolled in the study, 142 had suspected MI and 69 had confirmed MI; there were 860 deaths overall. The rate of nonfatal MI in the BEST was low over the 4.1 years of follow-up (4.8% had suspected events and 2.4% had adjudicated events) and was similar to that in high-risk populations. Cox's proportional hazard model with 23 prespecified candidate variables associated advanced age, heart failure symptoms, male gender, ischemic etiology, diabetes, and hypertension with nonfatal MI or cardiovascular death. The 2-year mortality rate was 56% for the cohort that had suspected nonfatal MI versus 30% for the cohort that did not (p = 0.01). Likewise, the risk of hospitalization for congestive heart failure was twofold greater. Beta-blocker therapy with bucindolol resulted in a 52% decrease in suspected nonfatal MI (2.9% vs 5.5%, p = 0.001). In conclusion, nonfatal MI occurs at low rates but increases the risks for mortality and hospitalization in patients who have advanced heart failure. Beta-blocker therapy with bucindolol appears to attenuate the risk of nonfatal MI in this population.", 
    "20": "Activation of the brain noradrenergic system during stress plays an important integrative function in coping and stress adaptation by facilitating transmission in many brain regions involved in regulating behavioural and physiological components of the stress response. The medial amygdala (MeA) has been implicated in modulation of stress-induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and MeA is a target of innervation from brainstem noradrenergic neurones. However, it is not known whether, and to what extent, activation of the ascending noradrenergic innervation of MeA might modulate stress-induced adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion. In the first experiment in this study, we measured extracellular norepinephrine (NE) levels in MeA using in vivo microdialysis. The concentration of NE in dialysate samples collected in MeA was elevated by more than three-fold over baseline in response to acute immobilisation stress, providing evidence of a possible modulatory role for NE in the MeA during stress. This potential role was then assessed in the second experiment by measuring changes in the elevation of plasma ACTH concentration induced by acute immobilisation stress immediately following bilateral microinjections of alpha1- or beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists directly into MeA. Compared to vehicle-injected controls, the alpha1-receptor antagonist benoxathian dose-dependently and significantly attenuated the ACTH response to acute stress, whereas combined beta1/beta2-receptor blockade in MeA had only a modest effect. These results indicate that MeA does play a role in the stress response, and support the hypothesis that stress-induced activation of NE release in MeA, acting primarily through alpha1 receptors, facilitates activation of the HPA axis in response to acute stress.",

The number of isolated and successive premature ventricular complexes during exercise ranged from 40 to 374 beats (mean 165 beats) at baseline, and was reduced during verapamil by 76+/-17% (P<0.05). Premature ventricular complexes appeared later and at higher heart rate during verapamil than at baseline (119+/-21 vs. 127+/-27 min-1, P<0.05). Magnesium did not inhibit the arrhythmias. Results in the fourth exercise stress test without interventions were similar to those in the first baseline study.",

However, these similar decreases resulted from different haemodynamic effects of the two study drugs. Dexmedetomidine had a more pronounced bradycardic effect than esmolol (P = 0.01) and increased systolic aortic pressure (SAP) by 15+/-4% while esmolol decreased SAP by 8+/-2% (P < 0.01). dP/dt(max) and regional myocardial area decrease were lower after esmolol than after dexmedetomidine.

On the other hand, the GABAergic antagonistic neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) (1 mg/kg, i.p.), the GABA(A) receptor blocker bicuculline (1 mg/kg, i.p.), the 5alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride (50 x 2 mg/kg, s.c.) or the mitochondrial diazepam binding inhibitory receptor antagonist PK11195 (1 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced ethanol-induced preference of time spent and number of entries into open arms.

Epinephrine modulated alpha-adrenoceptors to increase the levels of gastric mucosal nitric oxide and glutathione. Nitric oxide synthase inhibitors potently reversed the effects of epinephrine on gastric mucosal glutathione. Thus, epinephrine might act through alpha-adrenoceptors to increase the levels of gastric mucosal nitric oxide and glutathione and thus protect against severe acute gastric bleeding in rats.",

    "40": "Inhibition or blockade of the angiotensin-aldosterone system consistently decreases ischemic cardiovascular events in clinical trials. The steroid hormone aldosterone acts by binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a ligand activated transcription factor that is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. MR binds and is activated by aldosterone and cortisol with equal affinity, but MR activation by cortisol is diminished in tissues that express the cortisol-inactivating enzyme 11-beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase-2 (11betaHSD2). Although previous studies support that the vasculature is a target tissue of aldosterone, MR-mediated gene expression in vascular cells has not been demonstrated or systematically explored. We investigated whether functional MR and 11betaHSD2 are expressed in human blood vessels. Human coronary and aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) express mRNA and protein for both MR and 11betaHSD2. The endogenous VSMC MR mediates aldosterone-dependent gene expression, which is blocked by the competitive MR antagonist spironolactone. Inhibition of 11betaHSD2 in coronary artery VSMCs enhances gene transactivation by cortisol, supporting that the VSMC 11betaHSD2 is functional. Angiotensin II also activates MR-mediated gene transcription in coronary artery VSMCs. Angiotensin II activation of MR-mediated gene expression is inhibited by both the AT1 receptor blocker losartan and by spironolactone, but not by aldosterone synthase inhibition. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR experiments show that aldosterone activates expression of endogenous human coronary VSMC genes, including several involved in vascular fibrosis, inflammation, and calcification. These data support a new MR-dependent mechanism by which aldosterone and angiotensin II influence ischemic cardiovascular events, and suggest that ACE inhibitors and MR antagonists may decrease clinical ischemic events by inhibiting MR-dependent gene expression in vascular cells.", 
    "41": "Premenopausal women may be most vulnerable to acute coronary syndromes at a point in their menstrual cycle when their plasma estrogen levels are the lowest during and immediately after menstruation. Metoprolol is a first-line drug in the management of patients with acute coronary syndrome; however, when metoprolol was marketed in 1982, women were largely excluded from clinical trials. Furthermore, the over-the-counter antihistamine diphenhydramine inhibited the metabolism of the CYP2D6 substrate metoprolol in healthy, young men with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic consequences. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of metoprolol and its interaction with diphenhydramine were investigated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled manner in healthy, premenopausal extensive (EM; n = 16) and poor metabolizer (PM; n = 4) women immediately after menstruation. During the placebo phase, EMs had between 5.2- and 8.4-fold higher total clearance (CL/F) of R- and S-metoprolol compared with PMs, whereas the latter had a 35% greater area under the effect curve (AUEC) and 60% greater EC(50) value for heart rate reduction than EMs (all P < 0.05). Diphenhydramine coadmininstration caused a 2.2- to 3.2-fold decrease in CL/F of metoprolol enantiomers with a resulting 21% increase in AUEC and 29% increase in EC(50) value for heart rate reduction in EMs (all P < 0.05). This is the first study to report an in-depth elucidation of metoprolol's pharmacokinetics and hemodynamics in premenopausal EM and PM women at a point in their menstrual cycle when vulnerability for acute coronary events may be greatest.

Most of these patients are managed in primary care, often together with a cardiologist. There is an active guideline program in different professional organisations (e.g. general practitioners, cardiologists) and in 2002 a collaborative multidisciplinary guideline for management of chronic heart failure was developed. However, there is clearly room for improvement in the adherence to these guidelines both with regard to the diagnosis and the treatment of HF patients. For example, ACE-I and beta-blockers are still under-prescribed. In particular, the more severely ill patients seem to be under treated. At present, general practitioners and cardiologists differ in their views on heart failure, resulting in differences in diagnosis and management.

There may be variations in the role and its responsibilities in different health care settings. However the principles are similar and include: history taking, carrying out clinical assessment and making appropriate decisions about patient management within the context of practice. An example of this is nurse supervision of adjusting and titration of medication in a clinic setting or in the patient's own home. A major challenge to this role is defining the limitations and scope of practice. Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) are generally a frail, elderly population, and often have significant other co-morbidities. They can be on multiple medications and are frequently prescribed sub-optimal doses of evidence-based medication. Many patients are not managed by specialists, thus creating a huge potential for improved management.", 
    "53": "Advanced heart failure has been defined as persistent symptoms (NYHA class III-IV) that limit daily life despite routine therapy with agents of known benefit. Although these symptoms can occur both with low and preserved ejection fraction, the majority of reported experience is with low ejection fraction, usually <25%. For this population with expected one year mortality of 30-50%, over twice the mortality of the landmark trials of medical therapy, there is little trial data to guide management, which is based largely on collected experience. Once the disease has progressed to this stage, therapy focuses upon the twin goals of symptom relief and prolongation of survival and is guided according to the hemodynamic profiles defined by clinical assessment. As symptoms at this stage relate largely to the congestion, therapy is targeted to reduction of elevated pulmonary venous and/or systemic venous pressures to near normal levels. The most common obstacle to relief of congestion is the increasingly recognized cardio-renal syndrome, for which both understanding and therapy are currently limited. Design of the outpatient regimen for advanced heart failure must be tailored to the individual patient. Many patients with advanced heart failure cannot tolerate \"target\" doses of neurohormonal antagonists, and spironolactone should be used only when clinical and renal function are sufficiently stable and frequently monitored in order to avoid life-threatening hyperkalemia. The clinical benefit of bi-ventricular pacing is substantial for the small proportion of patients likely to benefit. The vast majority of patients will never be eligible for cardiac transplantation or ventricular assist devices. To derive maximal benefit from all available therapies, heart failure disease management with collaboration of physicians and specialized nurses offers the greatest benefit to the greatest number of patients with advanced heart failure.",

Glucocorticoids and NF-kappaB counteract the effects of each other on the immune system. It has been reported that immune response is exaggerated after the amelioration of Cushing's syndrome. We report a rare case of exacerbation of Graves' disease after unilateral adrenalectomy for Cusing's syndrome. A 50-yr-obese woman with hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance wasadmitted to outpatients clinic of endocrinology. The results of evaluation of glucocorticoids metabolism and adrenal magnetic resonance imaging revealed the Cusing's syndrome. We also assessed thyroid function tests because of the diagnosis of goiter and thyroid hormone replacement in her medical history, and the presence of exophthalmia and tachycardia in examination. Althoug TSH level was detected at the lower border of normal range, free T4 and free T3 were in normal range and autoantibody of thyroidal peroxidase and thyroglobulin was higer than normal reference range. An operation was performed and a mass was removed from her left adrenal gland. The pathologic examination confirmed adrenal adenoma. She was re-admitted to the outpatient clinic 9 months after with complaints of palpitation, malaise and weight loss. Tests carried out to determine the thyroid function revealed Graves' disease.

Visual field progression, intraocular pressure, and visual acuity were to be monitored for a period of 5 years. A total of 607 patients were randomly distributed among the two groups and controlled at 6-month intervals. At the same time the investigators tried to record quality of life using a questionnaire. Both trabeculectomy and medical therapy were able to lower intraocular pressure significantly, whereas trabeculectomy was more effective.

The cost-effectiveness shows the losartan cohort to provide an additional life expectancy of 0.05 years per patient compared to the atenolol cohort, over a mean follow-up period of 4.8 years. Losartan therapy in hypertensive patients produced net cost savings of CHF 24 per patient and per 4.8 years compared to atenolol from the perspective of the Swiss health care system. This result was robust after varying costs of medication, stroke, myocardial infarction and life expectancy.",

All the hypertensives (HT) were allocated randomly to three treatment arms (17 patients for each group) and they were single-matched for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Active treatment consisted of losartan (50 mg/day), ramipril (5 mg/day) and combined (losartan 50 mg/day plus ramipril 5 mg/day) for 24 weeks. Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/day was added in HT patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (> or = 140/90 mmHg) during the active treatment period. In all patients UAE, by immunonephelometric assay; circulating TGF beta1 by a solid-phase specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and creatinine clearance and potassium, by routine laboratory methods, were determined after placebo treatment and 24 weeks follow-up.",

At the end of treatment, significant (P < 0.05) reductions in systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure, UAE and TGF beta1 levels were observed in all the groups. No change in renal function measurements were observed. The absolute and percentage reduction in UAE and TGF beta1 were significantly higher in the combined group than in the losartan or ramipril groups. No significant changes in absolute and percentage reduction of systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure were found.

Among hypertensives, the incidence of new overt heart failure was significantly reduced by 38% and of debilitating stroke by 33%. Among normotensives, the need for coronary bypass grafting was significantly reduced by 32%.

The isovolumic relaxation time was improved by irbesartan (P = 0.040) only, and was related to changes in LV geometry (P < 0.001).

Since oxidative inactivation of nitric oxide (NO) is regarded as an important cause of its decreased biological activity, we studied (1) the effect of nebivolol on some oxidative parameters in essential hypertensive patients; (2) the effect of plasma of nebivolol-treated patients on reactive oxygen species production and NO availability in endothelial cells.", 
    "72": "A total of 20 healthy subjects and 20 matched essential hypertensive patients treated with atenolol or nebivolol according to a double-blind, randomized design participated in the study.

    "73": "In hypertensive patients, nebivolol and atenolol significantly reduced blood pressure values after 4 weeks of treatment. Plasma and LDL hydroperoxides, plasma 8-isoprostanes, plasma ox-LDL and LDL lag phase were significantly improved only in the patients receiving nebivolol compared with the atenolol group. Similarly there was a reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and O2*- concentration in endothelial cells exposed to oxidative stress after incubation of the cells with plasma of the patients enrolled in the trial only in the patients receiving nebivolol compared to atenolol group. Furthermore, the reduction of basal and stimulated NO induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells was significantly lower in the patients receiving nebivolol compared to atenolol group.",

    "75": "The European Lacidipine Study on Atherosclerosis (ELSA) has been planned to investigate the effect of reduction in office and ambulatory blood pressure by lacidipine versus atenolol on carotid artery wall thickness in mild to moderate essential hypertensive patients with no metabolic abnormalities. One prespecified sub-study of ELSA focused on measurements of arterial distensibility in the carotid as well as in the radial artery to determine the relationship of functional arterial properties with office versus ambulatory blood pressure (BP) values as well as the correspondence between functional and structural arterial alterations.", 
    "76": "The sub-study was conducted on 124 patients recruited in four centres (Monza-Milan, Paris, Grenoble and Glasgow). BP was measured both by a mercury sphygmomanometer and by 24-h ambulatory monitoring. Common carotid artery wall thickness was measured by certified sonographers as described in the main study. Common carotid and radial artery distensibility were obtained by echotracking techniques, which allowed to relate changes in arterial diameter with systo-diastolic BP changes.", 
    "77": "Carotid artery wall distensibility showed (1) a negative correlation with office and more so 24-h average systolic BP (r = -0.45 and -0.58, P < 0.008 and 0.001) but not with office or 24-h diastolic BP) and (2) a negative correlation with the corresponding wall thickness (r = -0.47, P < 0.005). In contrast, at the radial artery level distensibility and thickness showed no correlation with each other and with BP. Carotid (but not radial) artery distensibility also correlated with ambulatory systolic BP variability but the correlation was lost after adjustment for age and mean BP values.", 
    "78": "These data suggest that stiffening of large elastic artery is reflected more by ambulatory than office BP elevations, systolic BP being much more important than diastolic. Alterations of large elastic arteries function is related to structural wall changes. Functional and structural properties of middle-size muscle arteries are independent of BP.",

We undertook this acute study to establish the magnitude of and reason for different acute effects of ramipril and atenolol on arterial pressure.", 
    "80": "We enrolled 30 patients, who took 10 mg ramipril, 100 mg atenolol, and placebo at intervals of > or = 7 days, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

    "81": "Both ramipril and atenolol reduced arterial pressure, and the diastolic pressure fall was similar in the aorta and brachial artery, but the systolic pressure fall for ramipril was greater than for atenolol (by 5.2 mmHg, P < 0.0001) in the aorta compared with the brachial artery. The aortic systolic pressure difference with ramipril in comparison with atenolol was accompanied by an absolute difference of 10.7% (P < 0.0001) in the augmentation index, denoting a reduction in peripheral wave reflection by ramipril. The aortic pulse wave velocity fell to a similar degree with ramipril in comparison with atenolol, but fell to a greater degree (1.35 and 0.44 m/s, respectively, P < 0.0001 for both) in muscular arteries of the lower and upper limbs.", 
    "82": "A greater (average, 5.2 mmHg) decrease in aortic systolic pressure caused by ramipril may explain the greater benefit of ramipril over atenolol. The difference is attributable to decreased stiffness of peripheral arteries and a reduction in wave reflection.", 
    "83": "Antagonist affinity measurements have traditionally been considered important in defining the receptor or receptor subtypes present within cells or tissues. Any change in this value has normally been taken as evidence for the presence of a second receptor. However, highly efficacious ligands induce a time and phosphorylation-dependent change in the beta2-adrenoceptor resulting in 10-fold lower affinity for antagonists. Also the beta1-adrenoceptor is now considered to exist in two different active conformations which are distinguished by their pharmacological properties. In this study, the site of action of a range of beta-agonists and beta-antagonists was determined using the human beta1-adrenoceptor stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells with cyclic AMP response element reporter genes. Adrenaline and noradrenaline were confirmed as having agonist actions via the catecholamine site, whereas all antagonists had higher affinity for the catecholamine rather than secondary site. However, the rank order of affinity for the two sites was different suggesting that they are indeed separate entities. The measurements of antagonist affinity at the catecholamine site, however, were found to depend upon the agonist present. For example, xamoterol, cimaterol, terbutaline, and formoterol agonist responses were more readily antagonized by CGP 20712A[2-hydroxy-5-(2-[{hydroxy-3-(4-[1-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-2-imidazolyl]phenoxy)propyl}amino]ethoxy)benzamide] than the catecholamine responses themselves. This, however, was not related to agonist efficacy as has previously been reported for the human beta2-adrenoceptor. Therefore, it may be that some agonists (e.g., cimaterol) purely activate the catecholamine site and others purely activate the secondary site (e.g., CGP 12177 [(-)-4-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-benzimidazol-2-one]), whereas the others (e.g., catecholamines) activate both sites to differing degrees.",

After initial assessment by a cardiologist, 78% were treated with aspirin, 48% with a statin, and 67% with a beta-blocker. ACE-inhibitors were prescribed by the cardiologist in 37% overall. Revascularization rates were low, with only 501 (13%) patients having PCI or coronary bypass surgery performed or planned. However, when restricted to patients with coronary disease documented within 4 weeks of assessment, over 50% had revascularization performed or planned. Among other factors, the national rate of angiography and availability of invasive facilities significantly predicted the likelihood of revascularization, OR 2.4 and 2.0, respectively.",

    "89": "The results of published systematic reviews were summarised.", 
    "90": "Four systematic reviews and two trials published too recently for inclusion were identified. Maintenance tocolysis with beta-agonists and magnesium sulphate was ineffective in prolonging gestation or reducing any adverse fetal outcomes. One trial of maintenance tocolysis with nifedipine was underpowered to rule out an effect on prolonging gestation. One trial using the oxytocin receptor blocker, atosiban, showed that this drug used as maintenance tocolysis does prolong gestation, but the trial was too small to demonstrate any reduction in substantive fetal outcomes.", 
    "91": "There is insufficient evidence to justify the routine use of maintenance tocolysis in preterm labour. It remains plausible that prolongation of gestation might be beneficial in selected cases of very preterm labour where fetal compromise and infection have been ruled out. The only tocolytic that has been shown to prolong gestation when used as maintenance therapy is atosiban.", 
    "92": "Although anticoagulant treatment of atrial fibrillation is now well codified, the medical treatment of the fibrillation remains controversial. Two types of medication can be proposed: drugs to slow the rhythm (digitalis, betablockers and calcium inhibitors) and anti-arrhythmic mainly Class I or Class III drugs. Some doubt was raised in the 1990's about the pertinence of antiarrhythmic therapy and four recent trials (AFFIRM, RACE, PIAF and STAF) compared the two attitudes of \"rhythm control\" or \"rate control\" in atrial fibrillation. The four trials all showed that the results of these two options were equivalent with respect to the therapeutic objectives: reduction of mortality, thromboembolic or haemodynamic risk, and regression of symptoms and improvement of the quality of life. However, these trials have not closed the debate on these two therapeutic attitudes. In fact, analysis shows that the comparison was biased because anticoagulant treatment was inadequate and, though the treatment for rate control was appropriate, the antiarrhythmic treatment was far from being satisfactory and effective. Moreover, many patients in the \"rhythm control\" group were in atrial fibrillation whereas a certain number of patients in the \"rate control\" group were, in fact, in sinus rhythm throughout the study period. In addition, the comparison was incomplete because it did not include two other particularly common populations in clinical practice: multi-relapsing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in healthy hearts and atrial fibrillation associated with severe left ventricular dysfunction, patients with cardiac failure. Until the results of trials currently under way (AF-CHF) become available, the authors discuss the use of drugs for rate control and antiarrhythmic therapy in everyday practice.",

In practice they represent a daily problem for cardiologists due to their frequent occurrence. They can be detected in symptomatic patients and also in asymptomatic subjects, for example during routine health checks. It is therefore important to distinguish benign ventricular extrasystoles from those which are potentially serious, so that a useless or even dangerous treatment is not undertaken and severe anxiety is not caused in patients who have become 'medicalised'. The decision about treatment is only made following electrocardiographic and echographic clinical investigation, with the presence of cardiopathy being one of the major deciding factors.",

The process between active components and receptors in vivo can be imitated through the interactions between drugs and CMSP. The method provides references for the resolution of two applications: to screen the active components from Chinese medicine, and to figure out the type of receptors involved.",

The continuous skeleton and large through-pore structure were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The native silica monolith has been successfully employed in the electrochromatographic separation of beta-blockers and alkaloids extracted from traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). Column efficiencies greater than 250 000 plates/m for capillary electrochromatography (CEC) separation of basic compounds were obtained. It was observed that retention of basic pharmaceuticals on the silica monolith was mainly contributed by a cation-exchange mechanism. Other retention mechanisms including reversed-phase and normal-phase mechanisms and electrophoresis of basic compounds also played a role in separation. A comparison of the differences between CEC and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) separation was also discussed.", 
    "99": "Antihypertensive therapy has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in older patients with elevated systolic or diastolic blood pressures. This benefit appears to persist in patients older than 80 years, but less than one third of older patients have adequate blood pressure control. Systolic blood pressure is the most important predictor of cardiovascular disease. Blood pressure measurement in older persons should include an evaluation for orthostatic hypotension. Low-dose thiazide diuretics remain first-line therapy for older patients. Beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers are second-line medications that should be selected based on comorbidities and risk factors.", 
    "100": "In the last years, the treatment of heart failure has radically changed, as did the knowledge of this complex and heterogeneous clinical syndrome. The comprehension of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in the progression of this disease highlighted the central role of various neurohormonal mechanisms. Antagonism of these systems was demonstrated to be the only strategy which favorably modifies the natural history of heart failure. However, the evolution and updating of guidelines of heart failure treatment should be considered as the first step in the development of strategies aimed at extending these principles to the \"real world\" and in particular to elderly patients, who are different from patients typically enrolled in heart failure trials. In spite of the relative lack of data on the efficacy of evidence-based treatment in daily clinical practice, the recommendations of heart failure guidelines should also be applied to elderly patients. However, it has to be taken into account the specificity of elderly patients, because of the presence of frequent comorbidities, contraindications, drug intolerance, and potential pharmacologic interactions. The inappropriate prescription, dosage and follow-up in patients treated with digitalis and spironolactone may be associated with a high rate of serious adverse events. Otherwise, in spite of the large amount of evidence about their efficacy, ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers are largely underprescribed. Low-starting dosages and gradual up-titration may guarantee a good tolerability and long-term efficacy of these drugs also in elderly patients. Diagnosis and treatment of diastolic heart failure remain an unsolved issue. Further researches are needed on the efficacy of treatments in this clinical setting and, in particular, to define simple and reliable diagnostic indexes in elderly patients with preserved systolic function. Finally, the development of new multidisciplinary and effective models for the management of the ever-growing number of patients with heart failure is of utmost urgency.", 
    "101": "Nucleotides like ATP and UTP act as potent extracellular signalling molecules. Released from sympathetic nerve endings as cotransmitters of noradrenaline or paracrine from nonexcitatory cells, they activate specific receptors (ion-gated P2X(1-7) and G-protein-coupled P2Y(1,2,4,6,11-15)). Which of these subtypes, however, are able to modulate vasoconstriction in the kidney is unclear. Wild-type- and P2Y4-receptor-deficient mice kidneys were isolated and perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution. Pressor responses to renal nerve stimulations (RNS) and added drugs were recorded. Release of endogenous noradrenaline was measured by HPLC. RNS (1-15 Hz) induced a frequency-dependent increase in the perfusion pressor (14.2+/-5.1-67.3+/-6.9 mmHg) and noradrenaline release (1.4+/-0.3-24.2+/-3.4 ng g(-1) kidney). Pressor responses to RNS were not (1-2 Hz) or only partially (5-15 Hz) blocked by the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (1 microM). Combination of phentolamine and the P2-receptor blocker PPADS (5 microM) prevented RNS-induced pressor responses. The P2X(1,3)-receptor selective antagonist NF279 (10 microM) reduced RNS-induced pressor responses in a frequency-dependent manner. Perfusion of ATP, ADP, UTP, UDP and alpha,beta-meATP concentration dependently increased perfusion pressor with the following rank order of potency alpha,beta-meATP>ADP approximately ATP approximately UDP > or = UTP. NF279 (10 microM) reduced alpha,beta-meATP- (0.1 microM) (21.7+/-3.9% of control) but not UTP- (0.3 microM) (102.6+/-15.3% of control) induced pressor responses. No differences in nucleotide-induced effects were detected among wild-type and P2Y4-receptor knockout mice. Continuous perfusion of alpha,beta-meATP (0.01 microM) potentiated UTP-, UDP- and ATP-gamma S-induced pressor responses. Neuronally and paracrine-released nucleotides evoked renal vasoconstriction by activation of P2X(1,3)- and P2Y6-like receptors in mice. Pretreatment with the P2X(1,3)-receptor agonist alpha,beta-meATP potentiated P2Y6-like receptor-mediated vasoconstrictions.", 
    "102": "Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disabling condition that commonly affects otherwise normal young females. Because these patients can present with a flushing disorder, we hypothesized that mast cell activation (MCA) can contribute to its pathogenesis. Here we describe POTS patients with MCA (MCA+POTS), diagnosed by episodes of flushing and abnormal increases in urine methylhistamine, and compared them to POTS patients with episodic flushing but normal urine methylhistamine and to normal healthy age-matched female controls. MCA+POTS patients were characterized by episodes of flushing, shortness of breath, headache, lightheadedness, excessive diuresis, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Triggering events include long-term standing, exercise, premenstrual cycle, meals, and sexual intercourse. In addition, patients were disabled by orthostatic intolerance and a characteristic hyperadrenergic response to posture, with orthostatic tachycardia (from 79+/-4 to 114+/-6 bpm), increased systolic blood pressure on standing (from 117+/-5 to 126+/-7 mm Hg versus no change in POTS controls), increased systolic blood pressure at the end of phase II of the Valsalva maneuver (157+/-12 versus 117+/-9 in normal controls and 119+/-7 mm Hg in POTS; P=0.048), and an exaggerated phase IV blood pressure overshoot (50+/-10 versus 17+/-3 mm Hg in normal controls; P<0.05). In conclusion, MCA should be considered in patients with POTS presenting with flushing. These patients often present with a typical hyperadrenergic response, but beta-blockers should be used with great caution, if at all, and treatment directed against mast cell mediators may be required.",

PAF-AH activity was lower in women than in men and was affected by the intake of lipid-lowering drugs (-12%; P<0.001), aspirin (-6%; P<0.001), beta-blockers (-6%; P<0.001), and digitalis (+7%; P<0.001). Unlike sCRP, fibrinogen, and serum amyloid A, PAF-AH activity was not elevated in unstable angina, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, or ST-elevation myocardial infarction. When nonusers of lipid-lowering drugs were examined, PAF-AH activity was associated with the severity of CAD and the number of coronary vessels with significant stenoses. In individuals not taking lipid-lowering drugs and after adjustment for use of aspirin, beta-blocker, and digitalis, the odds ratio for CAD associated with increasing PAF-AH activity was 1.39 (95% CI 1.26 to 1.54, P<0.001), a finding that was robust against further adjustments.",

PAF-AH activity is affected by a number of cardiovascular drugs; however, after such medication use was accounted for, PAF-AH activity was associated with angiographic CAD, complementary to sCRP and independently of established risk factors such as LDL cholesterol.", 
    "106": "Previous studies indicate that norepinephrine and epinephrine modulate production of interleukin-1(beta) (IL-1(beta)) by activated macrophages, but it is not known if macrophage-derived catecholamines affect IL-1(beta). In this study, recruited peritoneal macrophages from CBA/J female mice were activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and treated with vehicle or adrenergic receptor antagonists for 24 h. Extracellular and intracellular levels of IL-1(beta) were measured with ELISA. Treatment with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists propranolol or ICI 118,551 increased LPS-induced production of IL-1(beta), whereas treatment with the alpha-adrenergic antagonists phentolamine or yohimbine decreased IL-1(beta). These findings demonstrate that adrenergic receptor antagonists unmask autocrine actions of macrophage-derived catecholamines on IL-1(beta) that may influence the inflammatory response.",

Of the 955 articles screened, eight randomized-controlled trials including 596 subjects (285 with endoscopic variceal ligation and 311 with beta-blockers) were analysed. Outcomes measures evaluated were first gastrointestinal bleed, first variceal bleed, all-cause deaths, bleed-related deaths and severe adverse events.

    "113": "Enantiomeric separation of racemates of 8 beta-receptor blockers and analogs was performed on a novel norvancomycin-bonded chiral stationary phase (NVC-CSP) in polar organic mode using high performance liquid chromatography. The influences of mobile phase composition, acetic acid and triethylamine contents, temperature and flow rate on enantiomeric separation were studied. It was found experimentally that with the increase of the fraction of methanol in the mobile phase, the same tendency was found for all the chiral solutes studied, i. e., the decrease in retention factor (kappa) and the increase in the enantioselectivity factor (alpha). With the increase of column temperature, most solutes were less retained and the alpha value decreased accordingly. Better resolutions were obtained at lower flow rates as a result of the minimization of the resistance to mass-transfer. Better separation results and suitable retentions for most solutes were obtained when a mixture of acetonitrile-methanol-acetic acid-triethylamine (60: 40: 0.4: 0.2, v/v) was used as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min, and the column temperature was set at 25 degrees C. Conclusions can be drawn from the experimental data that pi-pi complexation, dipole-stacking interactions were engaged in the process of enantiomeric separation, while hydrogen bonding interaction between solutes and CSP was commonly non-enantioselective, although it was mainly responsible for the increased retention in the acetonitrile-predominant mobile phases.", 
    "114": "Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels regulate many physiological functions and represent important therapeutic targets in the treatment of several clinical disorders. Although some of these channels have been well-characterized, the study of others, such as Kv3 channels, has been hindered because of limited pharmacological tools. The current study was initiated to identify potent blockers of the Kv3.2 channel. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells stably expressing human Kv3.2b (CHO-K1.hKv3.2b) were established and characterized. Stichodactyla helianthus peptide (ShK), isolated from S. helianthus venom and a known high-affinity blocker of Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 channels, was found to potently inhibit 86Rb+ efflux from CHO-K1.hKv3.2b (IC50 approximately 0.6 nM). In electrophysiological recordings of Kv3.2b channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes or in planar patch-clamp studies, ShK inhibited hKv3.2b channels with IC50 values of approximately 0.3 and 6 nM, respectively. Despite the presence of Kv3.2 protein in human pancreatic beta cells, ShK has no effect on the Kv current of these cells, suggesting that it is unlikely that homotetrameric Kv3.2 channels contribute significantly to the delayed rectifier current of insulin-secreting cells. In mouse cortical GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons, however, application of ShK produced effects consistent with the blockade of Kv3 channels (i.e., an increase in action potential half-width, a decrease in the amplitude of the action potential after hyperpolarization, and a decrease in maximal firing frequency in response to depolarizing current injections). Taken together, these results indicate that ShK is a potent inhibitor of Kv3.2 channels and may serve as a useful pharmacological probe for studying these channels in native preparations.",

Secondary data analysis utilising ambulatory claims of the Taiwan National Health Insurance involved all initially treated hypertensive patients (n=565,048) from June 1, 1997 to June 30, 1998. The main outcome measure was the statistical analysis of factors prompting medication switch and dropout rates. The overall continuity rate was 51%. Specific continuity rates were 40% for calcium antagonists, 36% for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 35% for beta-blockers and 29% for diuretics. Less than 30% of patients changed medications and more than 20% of patients changed clinics. The change increased the likelihood of switching medications sevenfold. Switch was minimal for calcium antagonists. Patients taking calcium antagonists were the least likely to switch medications and had the lowest dropout rate. Changing clinics was the most influential medication switch factor.", 
    "121": "Congestive heart failure is a major clinical and public health challenge. With increased aging, and advanced care of almost all other cardiac diseases, myocardial failure has become the single most common reason for hospitalization for patients older than 65. Conventional wisdom addressed heart failure as a hemodynamic perturbation consisting of congestion and limited cardiac output. Efforts intuitively focused on augmenting systolic function and clearing excessive pulmonary and systemic edema. Despite symptomatic improvement, mortality and functional deterioration continued unabated. Afterload reducing therapy emerged as an effective modality of improving cardiac function. Selective targeting of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) was shown to be superior to alternative nonhormone-based approaches. These clinical observations gave impetus to the neurohumoral paradigm of heart failure. Whereas attention to the congestive aspects of heart failure remains an essential component of therapy, it is by no means sufficient to neutralize the complex and interactive pathogenic mechanisms which underlie this syndrome. Particularly relevant, is the asymptomatic stage of ventricular dysfunction which portend significant future structural and functional deterioration. Mounting evidence confirm the benefit of ACEI and ARB in attenuating ventricular remodeling and improving survival. This paper aims at reviewing the evidence which has led to the strongly held paradigm of neurohormonal basis of heart failure. Appropriate and evidence based therapeutic strategies are presented.", 
    "122": "There is an increasing interest in using administrative data to estimate the treatment effects of interventions. While administrative data are relatively inexpensive to obtain and provide population coverage, they are frequently characterized by lack of clinical detail, often leading to problematic confounding when they are used to conduct observational research. Propensity score methods are increasingly being used to address confounding in estimating the effects of interventions in such studies. Using data on patients discharged from hospital for whom both administrative data and detailed clinical data obtained from chart reviews were available, we examined the degree to which stratifying on the quintiles of propensity scores derived from administrative data was able to balance patient characteristics measured in clinical data. We also determined the extent to which measures of treatment effect obtained using propensity score methods were similar to those obtained using traditional regression methods. As a test case, we examined the treatment effects of ASA and beta-blockers following acute myocardial infarction. We demonstrated that propensity scores developed using administrative data do not necessarily balance patient characteristics contained in clinical data. Furthermore, measures of treatment effectiveness were attenuated when obtained using clinical data compared to when administrative data were used.", 
    "123": "Diverse agonists used for airway challenges produce a stereotypic sequence of immediate functional responses (e.g., bronchoconstriction, gas trapping, hypoxemia, etc.) at the time such reactions are triggered. The reaction incorporates both pulmonary and cardiac changes that clearly interact in an orchestrated fashion taking the subject (or animal model) through the response generally to ultimate recovery. We hypothesize that despite differences in the initiation of the response, diverse airway provocations lead to a cascade of events that converge through a common physiologic pathway. To better understand the sequence of events and the counterbalanced cardiopulmonary responses, we examined histamine, methacholine, and ovalbumin (OVA) challenges in the awake guinea pig model and assessed ventilatory and breathing mechanics in the context of associated cardiac parameters. With the histamine response as the prototype, we evaluated the role of beta-adrenoreceptors using propranolol (1.0-10 mg/kg i.p.) and found that beta-adrenoreceptors are critical in reducing challenge-induced gas trapping in the lungs. The disposition of the circulatory response to agonist challenge (the OVA model) was reflected in a significant absolute shunting of blood through poorly ventilated regions of the lung. The methacholine challenge revealed that gasping enhanced lung inflation and reversed the diminished Pa(O2). Moreover, beta-sympathetic function was critical to recovery. Collectively, the response profiles of these disparate models of airway challenge suggest a highly integrated balance to maintain gas exchange among the pulmonary airways and vasculature, modulated in recovery by beta-adrenoreceptors.",

Following the educational program, the use of aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin increased from 69 to 99%, the use of beta- blockers increased from 57 to 98%, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers increased from 41 to 97%, and the use of lipid-lowering drugs in patients with dyslipidemia increased from 54 to 98% in patients without contraindications to these drugs.", 
    "125": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) may be asymptomatic, may be associated with intermittent claudication, or may be associated with critical limb ischemia. Coronary artery disease (CAD) and other atherosclerotic vascular disorders may coexist with PAD. Persons with PAD are at increased risk for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and mortality from CAD. Modifiable risk factors such as cessation of cigarette smoking and control of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes should be treated. Statins reduce the incidence of intermittent claudication and improve exercise duration until the onset of intermittent claudication in persons with PAD and hypercholesterolemia. Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or clopidogrel, especially clopidogrel, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be given to all persons with PAD. beta-Blockers should be given if CAD is present. Exercise rehabilitation programs and cilostazol improve exercise time until intermittent claudication. Indications for lower-extremity angioplasty, preferably with stenting, or bypass surgery are 1) incapacitating claudication in persons interfering with work or lifestyle; 2) limb salvage in persons with limb-threatening ischemia as manifested by rest pain, nonhealing ulcers, and/or infection or gangrene; and 3) vasculogenic impotence.

    "131": "A time-delayed oral drug delivery device was investigated in which an erodible tablet (ET), sealing the mouth of an insoluble capsule, controlled the lag-time prior to drug release. The time-delayed capsule (TDC) lag-time may be altered by manipulation of the excipients used in the preparation of the ET. Erosion rates and drug release profiles from TDCs were investigated with four different excipient admixtures with lactose: calcium sulphate dihydrate (CSD), dicalcium phosphate (DCP), hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC; Methocel K100LV grade) and silicified microcrystalline cellulose (SMCC; Prosolv 90 grade). Additionally, the compressibility of different insoluble coated capsules was tested at different moisture levels to determine their overall integrity and suitability for oral delivery. Erosion rates of CSD, DCP, and SMCC displayed a nonlinear relationship to their concentration, while HPMC indicated rapid first-order erosion followed by zero-order erosion, the onset of which was dependent on the HPMC concentration. Capsule integrity was confirmed to be most suitable for oral delivery when the insoluble ethyl cellulose coat was applied to a hard gelatin capsule using an organic spray coating process. T50% drug release times varied between 245 (+/-33.4) and 393 (+/-40.8) minutes for 8% and 20% DCP, respectively, T50% release times of 91 (+/-22.1) and 167 (+/-34.6) were observed for 8% and 20% CSD; both formulations showed incidence of premature drug release. The SMCC formulations showed high variability due to lamination effects. The HPMC formulations had T50% release times of 69 (+/-13.9), 213 (+/-25.4), and 325 (+/-30.3) minutes for 15%, 24%, and 30% HPMC concentrations respectively, with no premature drug release. In conclusion, HPMC showed the highest reproducibility for a range of time-delayed drug release from the assembled capsule formulation. The method of capsule coating was confirmed to be important by investigation of the overall capsule integrity at elevated humidity levels. The erosion characteristics of ETs containing HPMC may be described by gravimetric loss. The novel time-delayed capsule device presented in this study may be assembled to include an erodible tablet with a known concentration of HPMC. A variety of suitable drugs for targeted chronopharmaceutical therapy can be incorporated into such a device, ultimately improving drug efficacy and patient compliance, and reducing harmful side effects.",

The questionnaires also requested specific information about initiation and supervision of treatment, including severity of heart failure and treatment withdrawal. The data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics. In addition, the incidence densities (ID) of each event (per 1000 person-months of treatment) were calculated, ranked and the difference between the ID of each event in the first (ID1) and subsequent 5 months of exposure (ID2) was tested by constructing 99% confidence intervals (CI). Selected events of clinical interest would be followed-up for further information to enable causal association with carvedilol to be assessed.", 
    "134": "In this interim report we have data on a cohort of 847 eligible patients for whom we have received information from the first follow-up questionnaire. The treatment of carvedilol was initiated in a majority of cases by hospital specialists (87%, n = 735), however, for most of them, further supervision of treatment was done under shared care between GPs and hospitals (70%, n = 595). More than 90% of the patients were started on carvedilol in the recommended dose range for the management of cardiac failure. Amongst the patients where NYHA grade of cardiac failure was expressed, the majority of patients treated with carvedilol had NYHA II (37%, n = 281) and III (40%, n = 297) symptoms at the start of carvedilol treatment. On treatment with carvedilol, improvement in NYHA status was reported for 43% (n = 364) of this cohort, whilst less than 2.5% (n = 20) of the patients deteriorated. The events reported with the highest ID1 were malaise/lassitude (14.6), dizziness (12.2), cardiac failure (9.7), dyspnea (9.7) and hypotension (8.5). The most common events reported as reasons for stopping carvedilol were \"drug not effective\", \"dyspnea\", \"dizziness\" and \"lassitude\".

    "139": "Paradigms in understanding heart failure have changed as the knowledge of pathophysiology and its molecular basis has deepened. In the chronic compensated state of heart failure recent research has focussed on the body's regulatory mechanisms. Today heart failure is understood as a complex interplay of hemodynamic and neurohormonal factors. In pediatrics a large variety of heterogeneous conditions cause heart failure. Some require special therapeutic approaches such as the infusion of prostaglandin for ductal patency, the careful maintenance of balance between systemic and pulmonary circulations or operative treatment. In newborns with critical congenital lesions and in patients in the postoperative period management of acute heart failure becomes important. Chronic heart failure as it is understood today is present in patients with cardiomyopathies and in an increasing number of pediatric patients after palliative surgery. In heart failure due to left-to-right shunts a similar activation of compensatory neurohormonal mechanisms as in adults with chronic heart failure was found. In small clinical trials treatment of these activated compensatory mechanisms with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers showed beneficial effects in pediatric patients. However large clinical multicenter trials as performed in the adult population should be conducted.",

Other uncommon causes of esophageal bleeding are also discussed.", 
    "141": "With the advances in endoscopic and pharmacologic treatments, mortality resulting from variceal hemorrhage has been substantially reduced. Band ligation is the first-line endoscopic treatment of esophageal variceal hemorrhage. Vasoactive agents such as somatostatin analog and terlipressin are both safe and effective pharmacologic treatments of esophageal variceal hemorrhage. Use of a nonselective beta-blocker is still the most widely accepted treatment for both primary and secondary prophylaxis. However, the effectiveness of beta-blockers is limited by intolerance and nonresponders in a significant proportion of patients. Thus, endoscopic band ligation is used increasingly as an alternative strategy for primary prophylaxis. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt should be reserved as rescue therapy for failure of medical and endoscopic treatments. In recent years, noninvasive surrogate markers have been reported to identify high-risk patients with large esophageal varices. Platelet count, spleen diameter, and their ratio are accurate predictors of esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. The endosonographic measurement of the cross-sectional surface area predicts the risk of variceal hemorrhage. For Mallory Weiss syndrome, endoscopic clipping is an emerging treatment modality, especially for deep laceration with risk of perforation.",

    "143": "Intraspecific aggression is influenced in numerous animal groups by the previous behavioral experiences of the competitors. The underlying mechanisms are, however, mostly obscure. We present evidence that a form of experience-dependent plasticity of aggression in crickets is mediated by octopamine, the invertebrate counterpart of noradrenaline. In a forced-fight paradigm, the experience of flying maximized the aggressiveness of crickets at their first encounter and accelerated the subsequent recovery of aggressiveness of the normally submissive losers, without enhancing general excitability as evaluated from the animals' startle responses to wind stimulation. This effect is transitory and concurrent with the activation of the octopaminergic system that accompanies flight. Hemocoel injections of the octopamine agonist chlordimeform (CDM) had similar effects on aggression but also enhanced startle responses. Serotonin depletion, achieved using alpha-methyl-tryptophan, enhanced startle responses without influencing aggression, indicating that the effect of CDM on aggression is not attributable to increased general excitation. Contrasting this, aggressiveness was depressed, and the effect of flying was essentially abolished, in crickets depleted of octopamine and dopamine using alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMT). CDM restored aggressiveness in AMT-treated crickets, indicating that their depressed aggressiveness is attributable to octopamine depletion rather than to dopamine depletion or nonspecific defects. Finally, the flight effect was blocked in crickets treated with the octopamine receptor antagonist epinastine, or with the alpha-adrenoceptor and octopamine receptor antagonist phentolamine, but not with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. The idea that activity-specific induction of the octopaminergic system underlies other forms of experience-dependent plasticity of aggressive motivation in insects is discussed.",

Splenic sequestration was suspected, but the rise in platelets after splenectomy was temporary. Bacterial and viral etiologies were ruled out, since thrombocytopenia continued 6 months after splenectomy. Her medications acetaminophen, amitriptyline, amlodipine, beta-antagonists, and diphenhydramine were suspected. Nadolol and labetalol were started immediately prior to splenectomy. Six months after splenectomy, the woman was hospitalized for pneumonia; the platelet count was 50 x 10(3)/mm(3). Nadolol was discontinued on day 2. Within 24 hours, the platelet count rose to 128 x 10(3)/mm(3) and exceeded 200 x 10(3)/mm(3) by day 7. Labetalol was discontinued on day 8, but no additional significant rise occurred. The patient developed thrombocytopenia one year later when placed on nadolol and famotidine during admission for a gastrointestinal bleed. The platelet count decreased during the admission. Both drugs were discontinued after the last platelet count (100 x 10(3)/mm(3)).

After splenectomy, the thrombocytopenia might have resolved if the beta-antagonists had not been present. Since thrombocytopenia resolved within 24 hours of discontinuation of nadolol, it is likely that the continued thrombocytopenia was beta-antagonist induced.

The study compares 129 patients undergoing treatment with 126 patients receiving no IOP-lowering therapy. IOP remained virtually constant in the untreated group, while a reduction of 25% was achieved in the treatment group. The results of the EMGT indicate that glaucoma progression is influenced by higher initial IOP, pseudoexfoliation or bilateral glaucoma, poorer MD value, higher age, and marginal papillary hemorrhage.

The aim of this study was to examine the combined effect of the ACE-I and IFN on the murine hepatic fibrosis development. A model of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrosis was used to assess the effect of the clinically used ACE-I, perindopril (PE), and IFN-beta. The PE and IFN were administered after 2-week treatment with CCl(4), and the hepatic indices of fibrosis were assessed at 8 weeks. Single treatment with either PE or IFN at the clinically available comparable doses significantly attenuated liver fibrogenesis associated with suppression of the hepatic hydroxyproline and serum fibrosis markers. The number of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells, and the hepatic alpha1(I)-procollagen mRNA were also markedly inhibited. The inhibitory effect of PE was more potent than IFN, and the combination treatment with PE and IFN almost completely attenuated liver fibrosis development. In vitro, the angiotensin-II (AT-II) type 1 receptor blocker and IFN suppressed the AT-II-induced proliferation and alpha1(I)-procollagen mRNA expression of the activated hepatic stellate cells. The combination treatment of the clinically used PE and IFN may provide a new strategy for anti-liver fibrosis therapy.",

Pharmacological prolongation of atrial action potential duration (APD) may therefore help to prevent recurrent AF.

    "174": "p38 MAP kinase activation is known to be deleterious not only to mitochondria but also to contractile function. Therefore, p38 MAP kinase inhibition therapy represents a promising approach in preventing reperfusion injury in the heart. However, reversal of p38 MAP kinase-mediated contractile dysfunction may disrupt the fragile sarcolemma of ischemic-reperfused myocytes. We, therefore, hypothesized that the beneficial effect of p38 MAP kinase inhibition during reperfusion can be enhanced when contractility is simultaneously blocked. Isolated and perfused rat hearts were paced at 330 rpm and subjected to 20 min of ischemia followed by reperfusion. p38 MAP kinase was activated after ischemia and early during reperfusion (<30 min). Treatment with the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB-203580 (10 microM) for 30 min during reperfusion, but not the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase inhibitor SP-600125 (10 microM), improved contractility but increased creatine kinase release and infarct size. Cotreatment with SB-203580 and the contractile blocker 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM, 20 mM) or the ultra-short-acting beta-blocker esmorol (0.15 mM) for the first 30 min during reperfusion significantly reduced creatine kinase release and infarct size. In vitro mitochondrial ATP generation and myocardial ATP content were significantly increased in the heart cotreated with SB-203580 and BDM during reperfusion. Dystrophin was translocated from the sarcolemma during ischemia and reperfusion. SB-203580 increased accumulation of Evans blue dye in myocytes depleted of sarcolemmal dystrophin during reperfusion, whereas cotreatment with BDM facilitated restoration of sarcolemmal dystrophin and mitigated sarcolemmal damage after withdrawal of BDM. These results suggest that treatment with SB-203580 during reperfusion aggravates myocyte necrosis but concomitant blockade of contractile force unmasks cardioprotective effects of SB-203580.", 
    "175": "Gastrointestinal motility is influenced by adrenergic modulation. Our aim was to identify specific subtypes of adrenergic receptors involved in inhibitory mechanisms that modulate gut smooth muscle contractile activity. Muscle strips of rat ileal longitudinal muscle were evaluated for spontaneous contractile activity and for equimolar dose-responses (10(-7) to 3 x 10(-5) M) to the adrenergic agents norepinephrine (nonselective agonist), phenylephrine (alpha(1)-agonist), clonidine (alpha(2)-agonist), prenalterol (beta(1)-agonist), ritodrine (beta(2)-agonist), and ZD7114 (beta(3)-agonist) in the presence and absence of tetrodotoxin (nonselective nerve blocker). Norepinephrine (3 x 10(-5) M) inhibited 65 +/- 6% (mean +/- SEM) of spontaneous contractile activity. The same molar dose of ritodrine, phenylephrine, or ZD7114 resulted in less inhibition (46 +/- 7%, 31 +/- 5%, and 39 +/- 3%, respectively; P < 0.05). The calculated molar concentration of ZD7114 needed to induce 50% inhibition was similar to that of norepinephrine, whereas higher concentrations of phenylephrine or ritodrine were required. Clonidine and prenalterol had no effect on contractile activity. Blockade of intramural neural transmission by tetrodotoxin affected the responses to ritodrine and phenylephrine (but not to norepinephrine or ZD7114), suggesting that these agents exert part of their effects via neurally mediated enteric pathways. Our results suggest that adrenergic modulation of contractile activity in the rat ileum is mediated primarily by muscular beta(3)-, beta(2)-, and alpha(1)-receptor mechanisms; the latter two also involve neural pathways.", 
    "176": "A method with carbon nanotubes functioning both as the adsorbent of solid-phase extraction (SPE) and the matrix for matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) to analyze small molecules in solution has been developed. In this method, 10 microL suspensions of carbon nanotubes in 50% (vol/vol) methanol were added to the sample solution to extract analytes onto surface of carbon nanotubes because of their dramatic hydrophobicity. Carbon nanotubes in solution are deposited onto the bottom of tube with centrifugation. After removing the supernatant fluid, carbon nanotubes are suspended again with dispersant and pipetted directly onto the sample target of the MALDI-MS to perform a mass spectrometric analysis. It was demonstrated by analysis of a variety of small molecules that the resolution of peaks and the efficiency of desorption/ionization on the carbon nanotubes are better than those on the activated carbon. It is found that with the addition of glycerol and sucrose to the dispersant, the intensity, the ratio of signal to noise (S/N), and the resolution of peaks for analytes by mass spectrometry increased greatly. Compared with the previously reported method by depositing sample solution onto thin layer of carbon nanotubes, it is observed that the detection limit for analytes can be enhanced about 10 to 100 times due to solid-phase extraction of analytes in solution by carbon nanotubes. An acceptable result of simultaneously quantitative analysis of three analytes in solution has been achieved. The application in determining drugs spiked into urine has also been realized.", 
    "177": "Large, placebo-controlled RCTs that involve only diabetic patients who have hypertension have not been performed. Subgroup analyses of hyper-tension control from several recent RCTs un-equivocally demonstrated greater benefit in diabetic populations (see Table 3) with ACE inhibitors, TDs, and CCBs. Treatment with fBs(atenolol) also was beneficial in diabetic patients who had hypertension in the actively-controlled UKPDS. The results of three RCTs support intensive BP control in diabetic patients (see Table 4). In these trials, diabetic patients gained more benefit than nondiabetic patients. Such an effect is consistent with the fact that diabetics are at higher risk for CV events. Although there are limited data from RCTs with head-to-head comparison of newer agents (eg,ACE inhibitors, ARBs, CCBs) to show that these drugs are better than diuretics and betaBs in reducing CV events by treating hypertension in the diabetic population, the available data support ACE inhibitors (and ARBs if ACE inhibitors are not tolerated) as an initial drug of choice in diabetic,hypertensive patients (see Table 5). Most diabetic patients require three or four drugs to control their BP to target range; as such, it is not necessary to justify the choice of any single class of drug. Tight BP control is cost-effective and is more rewarding than hyperglycemic control in diabetic,hypertensive patients. The optimal goal in diabetics should be to achieve BP that is less than 130/80 mm Hg. Appropriate action should be taken if BP is greater than 140/85 mm Hg. In subjects who have diabetes and renal insufficiency,the BP should be decreased to less than 125/75 mm Hg to delay the progression of renal failure. Limited data suggest that an ACE inhibitor or an ARB is the agent of choice, especially in patients who have proteinuria or renal insufficiency. betaBs can be the first-line agent in diabetics who have CAD. TDs and CCBs are the second line drugs.AAAs should be avoided. Most hypertensive patients require more than one agent to adequately control their BP. There is no evidence to support one combination regimen over the others, nevertheless, the combination of an ACE inhibitor with a TD or a fPB may be more beneficial and cost effective than other combinations in the diabetic population. Large outcome studies that compare different combination therapies in hypertensive,diabetic patients are needed.", 
    "178": "Ischemia negatively affects mitochondrial function by inducing the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). The MPT is triggered by oxidative stress, which occurs in mitochondria during ischemia as a result of diminished antioxidant defenses and increased reactive oxygen species production. It causes mitochondrial dysfunction and can ultimately lead to cell death. Therefore, drugs able to minimize mitochondrial damage induced by ischemia may prove to be clinically effective. We analyzed the effect of carvedilol, a beta-blocker with antioxidant properties, on mitochondrial dysfunction. Carvedilol decreased levels of TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances), an indicator of oxidative stress, which is consistent with its antioxidant properties. Regarding cell death by apoptosis, although ischemia did increase caspase-8-like activity, there were no changes in caspase-3-like activity, which is activated downstream of caspase-8; this may indicate that the apoptotic cascade is not activated by 60 minutes of ischemia. We conclude that carvedilol protects ischemic mitochondria by preventing oxidative mitochondrial damage, and, by so doing, it may also inhibit the formation of the MPT pore."
