    "0": "beta-Adrenergic receptors (betaAR) play an important role in vasodilation, but the mechanisms whereby adrenergic pathways regulate the endothelial isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) are incompletely understood. We found that epinephrine significantly increases eNOS activity in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Epinephrine-dependent eNOS activation was accompanied by an increase in phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser(1179) and with decreased eNOS phosphorylation at the inhibitory phosphoresidues Ser(116) and Thr(497). Epinephrine promoted activation of the small G protein Rac1 and also led to the activation of protein kinase A. All of these responses to epinephrine in BAEC were blocked by the beta(3)AR blocker SR59230A. We transfected and validated duplex small interfering RNA (siRNA) constructs to selectively \"knock down\" specific signaling proteins in BAEC. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rac1 completely blocked all beta(3)AR signaling to eNOS and also abrogated epinephrine-dependent cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and Akt activation. However, siRNA-mediated knockdown of PKA did not affect Rac1 activation by epinephrine but did attenuate Akt activation by epinephrine. These findings indicate that Rac1 is an upstream regulator of beta(3)AR signaling to PKA and to eNOS and identify a novel beta(3)AR --> Rac1 --> PKA --> Akt pathway in endothelium. We exploited the p21-activated kinase pulldown assay to identify proteins associated with activated Rac1 and found that epinephrine stimulated the association of eNOS with Rac1; epinephrine-stimulated eNOS-Rac1 interactions were blocked by the beta(3)AR antagonist SR59230A. Co-transfection of eNOS cDNA with constitutively active Rac1 enhanced beta(3)AR-promoted eNOS-Rac1 association; co-transfection of eNOS with dominant negative Rac1 completely blocked the eNOS-Rac1 association. We also found that epinephrine-induced Rac1 --> PKA --> Akt pathway mediates beta(3)AR-mediated endothelial cell migration. Taken together, our data establish that the small G protein Rac1 is a key regulator of beta(3)AR signaling in cultured aortic endothelial cells with potentially important implications for the pathways involved in adrenergic modulation of eNOS pathways in the vascular wall.",

Management of these patients has been controversial. A 35 year old Caucasian female, 11 days postcesarean section delivery presented with acute myocardial infarction. She underwent angiography within a few hours of presentation, which showed dissection of LAD. Repeat angiography six days later showed improvement of dissection. Patient showed clinical improvement on conservative treatment and no recurrence of symptoms over the past two years follow-up. There is no consensus on the treatment and our case is one of the cases managed successfully with conservative treatment.", 
    "2": "As glucocorticoids influence both catecholamine synthesis and adrenoceptor expression by immune cells, the current study was undertaken to distinguish their direct effects on the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis from those induced by alteration of catecholamine signaling. We examined the influence of 16-day-long beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol (0.40 mg/100 g body weight/day, s.c.) beginning 3 days before immunization on the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in adrenalectomized (7 days before immunization) and in non-operated male Dark Agouti rats. Adrenalectomy aggravated the clinical course of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. In contrast, propranolol attenuated both the clinical signs of the disease and decreased the number of lesions in the spinal cord. Furthermore, propranolol prevented adrenalectomy-induced aggravation of the disease course without affecting mortality. We also found that the percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+) T lymphocytes (recently activated or regulatory cells) was increased in peripheral blood of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis rats over that in the corresponding non-immunized and bovine serum albumin immunized rats. However, the percentage of these cells was reduced in adrenalectomized and/or propranolol-treated experimental allergic encephalomyelitis rats compared to control experimental allergic encephalomyelitis rats. Our findings, coupled with the clinical course of the disease and the underlying pathomorphological changes, clearly suggest that differential mechanisms were responsible for the changes in the percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+) T lymphocytes in propranolol-treated adrenalectomized rats and only propranolol-treated rats with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Our results, when viewed globally, indicate that: i) beta-adrenoceptor-dependent mechanisms are involved in the immunopathogenesis of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, ii) experimental allergic encephalomyelitis has a more severe course in adrenalectomized rats and iii) beta-adrenoceptor-mediated mechanisms operate in adrenalectomy-induced aggravation of the disease.",

Patients suffering chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are particularly less treated by BB. The level of evidence for BB prescription is however especially high and as we will focus on, the level of evidence for the safety of BB in the COPD context is convincing enough. We, thus, propose to review the existing literature in regard to this prescription of BB in the chronic heart failure, in the coronary artery disease and for high blood pressure in COPD patients. We then propose our approach to improve the level of prescription of BB in COPD patient really justifying this prescription in cardiology.",

Subjects with confounding factors, e.g., substance use, neurological disorders, endocrinopathies, inflammatory conditions, psychiatric illnesses, etc., were excluded. Their average systolic and diastolic blood pressure since onset of illness and prescribed drugs were noted from the records. Compliance was assessed with the help of information from subjects as well as the close relatives. MMSE and a battery of neuropsychological tests (Digit Span Test, Trail Making Test Form B, Stroop Test, Visuospatial Working Memory Matrix and Word Fluency Test) was applied to all the participants. Multivariate regression analysis was used for the assessment of associations and one-way ANOVA was performed to assess differences in the mean. Analysis showed that mean age of study subject was 52 years and average duration of hypertension was 9 years. Fourteen percent subjects had obvious cognitive impairment as suggested by MMSE score less than 23. However, when cut-off score was lowered to 20, only 6% subjects fell into this category. Diastolic blood pressure had significant negative association with all of the cognitive measures except Trail Making Test, which was, on the contrary, significantly and negatively associated with systolic blood pressure. Duration of hypertension did not influence cognitive performance in this study. Effect of drug compliance was somewhat variable, but in general good compliance was associated with better cognitive performance. Beta-Blocker therapy hampered cognitive performance, whereas the best performance, especially on tests of semantic memory and pre-frontal functions was seen in subjects taking calcium channel blockers.",

Compliance with medication prescriptions, including aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and lipid-lowering drugs, and smoking cessation counseling for eligible patients was analyzed. Medically appropriate exclusions and contraindications were included in the analysis. After adjusting for 14 clinical variables, CABG patients were less likely to receive most secondary prevention measures relative to percutaneous catheter intervention patients.

PTSD can be severely debilitating and diminish quality of life for patients and those who care for them. Studies have indicated that propranolol, a beta-blocker, reduces consolidation of emotional memory. When administered immediately after a psychic trauma, it is efficacious as a prophylactic for PTSD. Use of such memory-altering drugs raises important ethical concerns, including some futuristic dystopias put forth by the President's Council on Bioethics. We think that adequate informed consent should facilitate ethical research using propranolol and, if it proves efficacious, routine treatment. Clinical evidence from studies should certainly continue to evaluate realistic concerns about possible ill effects of diminishing memory. If memory-attenuating drugs prove effective, we believe that the most immediate social concern is the over-medicalization of bad memories, and its subsequent exploitation by the pharmaceutical industry.",

One technique for obtaining consistent estimates of treatment effects in the presence of unmeasured confounders is instrumental variables analysis (IVA). This technique has been well developed in the econometrics literature and is being increasingly used in epidemiological studies. However, the approach to IVA that is most commonly used in such studies is based on linear models, while many epidemiological applications make use of non-linear models, specifically generalized linear models (GLMs) such as logistic or Poisson regression. Here we present a simple method for applying IVA within the class of GLMs using the generalized method of moments approach. We explore some of the theoretical properties of the method and illustrate its use within both a simulation example and an epidemiological study where unmeasured confounding is suspected to be present. We estimate the effects of beta-blocker therapy on one-year all-cause mortality after an incident hospitalization for heart failure, in the absence of data describing disease severity, which is believed to be a confounder.",

We compared determinants of blood pressure control among Hispanic white, Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic black participants (N=32 642) during follow-up in a randomized, practice-based, active-controlled trial. Hispanic blacks and whites represented 3% and 16% of the cohort, respectively; 33% were non-Hispanic black and 48% were non-Hispanic white. Hispanics were less likely to be controlled (<140/90 mm Hg) at enrollment, but within 6 to 12 months of follow-up, Hispanics had a greater proportion <140/90 mm Hg compared with non-Hispanics. At 4 years of follow-up, blood pressure was controlled in 72% of Hispanic whites, 69% of Hispanic blacks, 67% of non-Hispanic whites, and 59% of non-Hispanic blacks. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, Hispanic whites had a 20% greater odds of achieving BP control by 2 years of follow-up (odds ratio: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.31) after controlling for demographic variables and comorbidities, Hispanic blacks had a similar odds of achieving BP control (odds ratio: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.25), and non-Hispanic blacks had a 27% lower odds (odds ratio: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.78).

The goal of this study was to investigate whether plasma concentration of cardiotrophin-1, a cytokine that induces exaggerated hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes with hypertensive phenotype, is related to inappropriate left ventricular mass in patients with essential hypertension. The study was performed in 118 patients with never-treated hypertension and without prevalent cardiac disease. The left ventricular mass prediction from stroke work (systolic blood pressurexDoppler stroke volume), sex, and height (in meters(2.7)) was derived. An observed left ventricular mass/predicted left ventricular mass value >128% defined inappropriate left ventricular mass. Plasma cardiotrophin-1 was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The studies were repeated in a group of 45 patients after 1 year of antihypertensive treatment. At baseline 67 and 51 patients presented with appropriate and inappropriate left ventricular mass, respectively. Plasma cardiotrophin-1 was higher (P<0.001) in patients with inappropriate mass than in patients with appropriate mass and normotensive controls. A direct correlation was found between cardiotrophin-1 and observed left ventricular mass/predicted left ventricular mass ratio (r=0.330, P<0.001) in all hypertensive patients. After treatment, plasma cardiotrophin-1 decreased and increased in patients in which inappropriate left ventricular mass regressed and persisted, respectively, despite a similar reduction of blood pressure in the 2 subgroups of patients. Albeit descriptive in nature, these results suggest the hypothesis that an excess of cardiotrophin-1 may contribute to inappropriate left ventricular growth in hypertensive patients.",

Furthermore both cell types showed a sixfold increase in the K(D) for the specific binding of the non-specific antagonists (-)-[(3)H]CGP 12177 and [(125) I]CYP to keratinocytes and lymphocytes respectively compared with healthy controls. Based on these results polymorphism in the beta2-adrenoceptor gene was suspected. Consequently the entire intronless beta2-adrenoceptor gene was isolated from whole blood and by RT-PCR from keratinocyte extracts of nine patients with atopic eczema and four healthy controls. DNA sequence analysis of nine atopic eczema patients confirmed a substitution in codon (1618) GCC (Ala(119)) to GAC (Asp(119)). This point mutation is expressed on the third transmembrane helix only 13A away from the established agonist/antagonist binding site at Asp(113). Computer modelling of this third transmembrane helix revealed substantial structural changes in the mutant compared with the wild type. Epidermal keratinocytes were established from one patient with atopic eczema (homozygote), the mother (heterozygote) and one age-matched healthy control. Cells were grown in media containing different concentrations of l-phenylalanine and receptor densities were determined. The results showed that cells with atopic eczema showed an increased sensitivity to l-phenylalanine concentrations with a narrow homeostasis compared with healthy controls. The heterozygous mother was only 50% as sensitive as the child. In summary, the results indicate that atopic eczema is associated with a single point mutation in the beta2-adrenoceptor gene leading to an impaired adrenergic response in the epidermis of these patients.",

In comparison to the well-established bovine brain endothelial cell (BBMEC) model, cultured bEnd5 monolayers reached a maximal transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of 121 Omega cm(2) on day 7, and possessed oval and spindle shape morphology. Structurally, confluent monolayers of bEnd5 cells and BBMECs exhibit peripheral band staining of the tight junction protein ZO-1 and occludin. Both bEnd5 and BBMECs express important tight junctional proteins, ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1, as well as the transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp), NKCC, GLUT1, and most PKC isoforms. Marker permeability experiments suggest that bEnd5 cells form a tight barrier that compares to well-established in vitro BBB models, such as the BBMEC. After short durations of hypoxia/aglycemia (H/A), hyperpermeability was seen in the bEnd5 endothelial monolayer compared to later time periods for BBMECs, suggesting that bEnd5 cells are more sensitive to hypoxia/algycemia treatment than BBMECs. Taken together, bEnd5 cell culture model may provide a useful in vitro model of the BBB for drug delivery studies and modeling pathological states such as oxygen glucose deprivation associated with stroke.",

In the present study we have investigated the contributions of the subtypes of beta-AR in the above phenomenon. (2) Primary astrocyte cultures were grown under thyroid hormone deficient as well as under euthyroid conditions. [(125)I]Pindolol ([(125)I]PIN) binding studies showed a gradual increase in the specific binding to beta(2)-AR when observed at 5, 10, 15, and 20 days under both cultural conditions. Thyroid hormone caused an increase in binding of [(125)I]PIN to beta(2)-AR compared to thyroid hormone deficient controls at all ages of astrocyte culture. (3) Saturation studies using [(125)I]PIN in astrocyte membranes prepared from 20-day-old cultures showed a significant increase in the affinity of the receptors (K (D)) in the thyroid hormone treated cells without any change in receptor number (B (max)). (4) beta(2)-AR mRNA levels were measured by real-time PCR during ontogenic development as well as during exposure of 10-day-old hypothyroid cultures to normal levels of thyroid hormone for 2, 6, 12, and 24 h. None of the conditions caused any significant change in the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor mRNA levels when compared with corresponding hypothyroid controls. (5) Over expression of beta(2)-AR cDNA in hypothyroid astrocytes caused morphological transformation in spite of the absence of thyroid hormone in the medium. (6) Taken together, results suggest thyroid hormone causes a selective increase in [(125)I]PIN binding to beta(2)-AR due to increase in receptor affinity, which may lead to maturation of astrocytes.",

Heart rate dropped significantly with metoprolol. At the premetoprolol measurement, aortic pressure (Pa) remained essentially the same (105.7 +/- 11.5 versus 105.6 +/- 11.6 mmHg, P > 0.05) and distal coronary pressure (Pd) dropped significantly by 9% from 96.3 +/- 12.7 to 87.4 +/- 13.4 mmHg (P < 0.001) after adenosine injection yielding an FFR(1) of 0.83 +/- 0.07. At the postmetoprolol phase, Pa dropped nonsignificantly by 2% from 104.4 +/- 12.8 to 102.4 +/- 14.3 mmHg (P = 0.09) and Pd dropped significantly by 11% from 95.7 +/- 14.4 to 85.3 +/- 16.4 mmHg (P < 0.001) after adenosine injection, yielding an FFR(2) of 0.83 +/- 0.08, which was almost exactly the same as FFR(1) (P > 0.05).",

    "49": "The quantification of tenofovir, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor prescribed once daily, in human plasma is important due to a recent increase in its use. HPLC, however, can not easily detect and quantify tenofovir because of interfering peaks. Therefore, we developed a rapid and conventional LC-MS method, validated by estimating the precision and accuracy for inter- and intraday analysis in the concentration range of 0.019-1.567 microg/ml. The calibration curve was linear in the described concentration range. Average accuracy ranged from 95.9 to 100.7%. Relative standard deviations of both inter- and intraday assays were less than 11.6%. Recovery of tenofovir was more than 80.2%. This novel method provides a conventional, accurate and precise way to determine tenofovir in human plasma samples.", 
    "50": "Cocaine is an extremely powerful reinforcing psychostimulant with highly addictive properties. Over the last few decades, cocaine addiction has attained epidemic proportions in North America, imposing a tremendous burden on society and the health care system. The cardiovascular complications of cocaine abuse are adrenergic mediated and range from cocaine-associated acute coronary syndromes to aortic dissection and sudden cardiac death. Concomitant alcohol and cigarette smoking exacerbate the cardiotoxicity of cocaine. This contemporary review discusses the spectrum of cardiac complications arising from cocaine use, operant pathophysiologic mechanisms and controversies surrounding the pharmacotherapy of cocaine-associated acute coronary syndromes.", 
    "51": "Ambulatory Holter monitoring has been shown to be useful in stratifying cardiovascular risk after acute myocardial infarction. However, it remains unclear whether ST-segment deviations might predict clinical outcomes in a population treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared with thrombolysis. Holter monitoring was initiated at discharge from ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in 958 patients followed for 2,773 patient-years, randomized to immediate revascularization with either fibrinolysis (n=474) or PCI (n=484). The primary end point was all-cause mortality, and the secondary end point was a composite of death, reinfarction, and disabling stroke. The prevalences of ST-segment depression (STd) and ST-segment elevation (STe) were similar in patients treated with fibrinolysis or PCI (both p=NS). During follow-up, 58 patients died (primary PCI vs fibrinolysis hazard ratio 0.74, p=0.25). The secondary end point was reached in 113 patients (primary PCI vs fibrinolysis hazard ratio 0.66, p=0.03). In fibrinolysis-treated patients, mortality and the secondary end point were significantly higher in patients with STe (both end points p<0.001), an association that remained statistically significant after adjustment for age, gender, anterior infarction, beta-blocker treatment, left ventricular systolic function, and STd (p=0.03 and p=0.005, respectively). Significant associations were not observed for STd. In PCI-treated patients, there was no association between either STe or STd and outcome. In conclusion, immediate revascularization with PCI during STe myocardial infarction does not affect the subsequent prevalence of ST-segment deviation compared with fibrinolysis. However, although STe is an independent predictor of mortality and nonfatal major cardiovascular events in patients treated with fibrinolysis, it does not predict outcome after PCI, perhaps because of more complete revascularization.", 
    "52": "Diabetes aggravates the clinical severity and represents an additional independent risk factor of hypertension. Since both diseases separately concur to cardiomyocyte apoptosis, a mechanism at least partly involving unbalanced oxidative stress, we investigated whether the combination of diabetes and hypertension potentiated cardiac cell death in experimental models, compared to either disease alone. We also evaluated the short-term effects of different drugs in these models. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic normotensive (WKY) or hypertensive (SHR) rats were treated for one week with a DA(2)/alpha(2) agonist (CHF-1024), a selective beta1 adrenergic blocker (metoprolol), an angiotensin II-receptor blocker (valsartan) or a radical scavenger (tempol). In separate experiments, isolated cardiomyocytes were cultured in high glucose medium (25 mM) containing the same drugs. Although the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes and the myocardial density of oxygen radicals were higher in non diabetic hypertensive than in normotensive controls, diabetes raised these variables to comparable absolute levels in both strains. All drugs except metoprolol significantly reduced apoptosis and oxidative stress in the diabetic animals of both strains and in the isolated myocytes cultured with high glucose. In conclusion, hypertensive rat is no more susceptible than its normotensive control to acute apoptosis induced by diabetes. Oxidative stress might be considered the common trigger for cardiac myocyte apoptosis in both conditions.", 
    "53": "A simple, rapid, sensitive and specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for quantification of metoprolol tartrate (MT) and ramipril, in human plasma. Both the drugs were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction with diethyl ether-dichloromethane (70:30, v/v). The chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed-phase C8 column with a mobile phase of 10 mM ammonium formate-methanol (3:97, v/v). The protonated analyte was quantitated in positive ionization by multiple reaction monitoring with a mass spectrometer. The method was validated over the concentration range of 5-500 ng/ml for metoprolol and ramipril in human plasma. The precursor to product ion transitions of m/z 268.0-103.10 and m/z 417.20-117.20 were used to measure metoprolol and ramipril, respectively.", 
    "54": "A 50-year-old woman presented with combined systolic and diastolic heart failure and Raynaud's phenomenon with painful necrotic lesions around several nail beds. Several clinical criteria and the specific biochemical findings lead to the diagnosis of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) which is an autoimmune connective tissue disease characterized by cutaneous and visceral fibrosis and widespread vascular pathology.After treatment with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitor) and beta blockers the heart failure symptoms disappeared and the ejection fraction improved. The severe pain in the hands due to Raynaud's phenomenon diminished only after treatment with calcium channel blocker nifedipine (Adalat, 10 mg, PO, Bayer HealthCare, Germany) without affecting the cardiovascular status. Cardiac involvement in connective tissue disease is not uncommon, but to our knowledge we present here the first case of MCTD with a combined systolic and diastolic heart failure as primary manifestation.", 
    "55": "The efficacy of ACE-inhibitors and beta blockers is well documented in the therapy of heart failure. As pharmacological mechanisms of ATI-receptor-antagonists differ, an additional positive effect can be expected when combining these drugs.", 
    "56": "Eighty patients (67.9 +/- 9.9 years) with severe chronic heart failure receiving long-term medication with diuretics, ACE-inhibitors and partially beta blockers (72.5%), were randomized after clinical recompensation to eprosartan (477.5 +/- 143.7 mg/d), telmisartan (65.9 +/- 17.7 mg), candesartan (11.9 +/- 4.0 mg) or no sartan, according to a prospective study. Haemodynamic measurements by impedance cardiography were performed (mean observation time 15.8 days).", 
    "57": "Additional sartan treatment resulted in an improvement of cardiac output from 2.32 +/- 0.69 to 3.12 +/- 1.24 l/min (P = 0.003) in the eprosartan group, from 2.24 +/- 0.59 to 2.76 +/- 0.91 l/min (P = 0.001) in the telmisartan group and from 2.76 +/- 0.84 to 3.11 +/- 0.94 l/min (P = 0.02) in the candesartan group. Furthermore, a significant decrease of the total peripheral resistance was measured under eprosartan (23%; P = 0.002), telmisartan (18%; P = 0.002) and candesartan treatment (11.5%; P = 0.049); in the subgroup of combined therapy with beta blockers, ACE-inhibitors and ATI-antagonists a significant increase in cardiac output was also observed. No change was observed in the control group without additional sartan treatment concerning cardiac output and resistance reduction.", 
    "58": "The additional treatment with different ATI-receptor-antagonists resulted in an increase of the cardiac output and a decrease of the peripheral resistance. This beneficial effect may be due to the additional property of sartans to block the interaction of locally and not-ACE-generated angiotensin II with their vascular and myocardial ATI-receptors.", 
    "59": "Aristolochic Acid (AA) is a component of Chinese herbs that has been found to be toxic to multiple organs in adults. Its toxicity to developing embryos has not been reported. Here, we describe that AA specifically causes heart defects in developing zebrafish embryos in a dosage-dependent manner. The treated embryos are able to develop their hearts normally up to 24 h postfertilization, when cardiac contraction initiates, but begin to show deformation and reduction of the hearts followed by gradual contractility loss and eventually lethality, suggesting that AA is primarily affecting cardiac physiology rather than cardiogenesis. Histological analyses reveal that the AA-treated hearts develop hypertrophy and disorganization of cardiomyocytes and loss of endocardium. By transmission electron microscopy, we observed broken and disorganized cardiac fibers in the AA-treated hearts. AA induces the expression of proinflammation genes, including cox-2, IL-1beta, and others. The AA-induced cardiac defects can be attenuated by the cox-2 antagonist NS398 via reducing the expression of the inflammatory genes. This attenuation could be further enhanced by known heart failure drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. In contrast, the heart defects are enhanced by a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. In summary, AA causes profound toxicity to zebrafish embryos that exhibit pathophysiological and pharmacological features resembling those of heart failure in humans and other model organisms, and thus, zebrafish could be a new model for studies on heart failure.", 
    "60": "Several studies suggest the importance of the interaction between the renin angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems in blood pressure control, especially in clinical situations such as the metabolic syndrome. Previously, we have demonstrated changes in noradrenergic hypothalamic control of blood pressure in an animal model of insulin resistance and hypertension. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of the interaction between the noradrenergic and angiotensinergic systems on hypothalamic blood pressure regulation in fructose hypertensive rats.", 
    "61": "In control (C) and fructose-fed hypertensive (F) rats, we studied: 1) the effects of hypothalamic perfusion of irbesartan (AT(1) angiotensin receptor antagonist, 50 and 500 microg ml(-1)) and metoprolol (beta(1) adrenergic receptor antagonist, 10 and 100 microg ml(-1)) on blood pressure, heart rate and noradrenaline intrahypothalamic levels, by means of the microdialysis technique; and 2) the effects of intrahypothalamic microinjection of angiotensin II alone or after metoprolol pre-administration, on blood pressure and heart rate.", 
    "62": "Meanwhile irbesartan perfusion did not modify neither mean arterial pressure (MAP) nor heart rate or noradrenaline hypothalamic levels in the C group, its highest dose diminished MAP (DeltaMAP: F: - 16.3+/-1 mm Hg, p<0.05) and noradrenaline levels (% of basal levels: 58+/-7%, p<0.05) in the F group, without affecting heart rate. Intrahypothalamic perfusion of metoprolol diminished MAP only in the F group (DeltaMAP: F: -12.1+/-1.1 mm Hg, p<0.05), but did not modify heart rate in both groups. On the other hand, it diminished noradrenaline hypothalamic levels in C (% of basal levels: 53+/-6%, p<0.05) but not in the F group. The pressor response to angiotensin II microinjection was increased in F rats (DeltaMAP: F: 13.3+/-1.5 mm Hg vs. C: 6.9+/-1.8 mm Hg; p<0.05). Previous administration of metoprolol markedly abolished this increment.", 
    "63": "Our results suggest the existence of an increase in AT(1) and beta(1) adrenergic receptors tone in the hypothalamus of F rats, which could be related to the increase in blood pressure present in this experimental model. On the other hand, considering that the enhanced pressor response to angiotensin II intrahypothalamic injection in F rats was abolished by previous administration of a beta(1) adrenergic receptor antagonist, these results would indicate that beta(1) adrenergic receptors activation participates in the pressor response to angiotensin II in this experimental model of insulin resistance and hypertension.", 
    "64": "The H295R cell bioassay was used to evaluate the potential endocrine disrupting effects of 18 of the most commonly used pharmaceuticals in the United States. Exposures for 48 h with single pharmaceuticals and binary mixtures were conducted; the expression of five steroidogenic genes, 3betaHSD2, CYP11beta1, CYP11beta2, CYP17 and CYP19, was quantified by Q-RT-PCR. Production of the steroid hormones estradiol (E2), testosterone (T) and progesterone (P) was also evaluated. Antibiotics were shown to modulate gene expression and hormone production. Amoxicillin up-regulated the expression of CYP11beta2 and CYP19 by more than 2-fold and induced estradiol production up to almost 3-fold. Erythromycin significantly increased CYP11beta2 expression and the production of P and E2 by 3.5- and 2.4-fold, respectively, while production of T was significantly decreased. The beta-blocker salbutamol caused the greatest induction of CYP17, more than 13-fold, and significantly decreased E2 production. The binary mixture of cyproterone and salbutamol significantly down-regulated expression of CYP19, while a mixture of ethynylestradiol and trenbolone, increased E2 production 3.7-fold. Estradiol production was significantly affected by changes in concentrations of trenbolone, cyproterone, and ethynylestradiol. Exposures with individual pharmaceuticals showed the possible secondary effects that drugs may exert on steroid production. Results from binary mixture exposures suggested the possible type of interactions that may occur between drugs and the joint effects product of such interactions. Dose-response results indicated that although two chemicals may share a common mechanism of action the concentration effects observed may be significantly different.", 
    "65": "Earlier studies from the authors' laboratory showed that malnourishment induces alterations in the cardiovascular homeostasis increasing the basal mean arterial pressure and heart rate. In this study, the authors evaluated whether the sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent activities contribute to changes in the cardiovascular homeostasis through altered modulation of the arterial baroreflex of malnourished rats. After weaning, male Fischer rats were given 15% (Normal Protein--NP) or 6% (Low Protein--LP) protein diet for 35 d. The baroreflex gain and latency were evaluated before and after selective autonomic blockades in control and malnourished rats. It was observed that malnourishment affected the baroreflex gain in response to activation and deactivation of the arterial baroreflex. Moreover, malnourished rats showed increased baroreflex latency as compared to that of control rats. Regarding the autonomic efferent activity directed to the heart, the data showed increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic efferent activities in malnourished rats, and such alterations could be related to the observed changes in the arterial baroreflex gain as well as in the basal mean arterial pressure and heart rate.", 
    "66": "Beta-adrenergic blocking agents (beta blockers) are widely used pharmaceuticals which have been detected in the environment. Predicting the transport and ultimate fate of beta blockers in the environment requires understanding their adsorption to soils and sediments, something for which little information is currently available. The objective of this work was to examine the adsorption of three beta blockers, propranolol, metoprolol and nadolol, to a natural alluvial material, as well as to six minerals present as components of the alluvial material. Batch adsorption experiments indicate that, for most of the minerals studied, compound hydrophobicity is an important predictor of adsorption, with propranolol,the most hydrophobic compound studied, adsorbing to the greatest extent. Results further suggest that, for the minerals studied, electrostatic effects are not a good predictor of adsorption; adsorption extent was not well-predicted by either surface zeta potential or by the difference between experiment pH and point of zero charge, despite the cationic nature af the three beta blockers at experiment pH values. Experiments were conducted to examine the effect of an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS), on adsorption. Results indicate that SDBS significantly increases the adsorption of propranolol to two different sorbents. This result is potentially important because surfactants such as SDBS are likely to be present in wastewater effluents with beta blockers and could influence their mobility in the environment.", 
    "67": "The maximal endothelial dependent relaxation of isolated aortic rings to cumulative doses of acetylcholine was significantly decreased in the Cyclosporine-A (CSA, 20 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) treated animals compared to olive oil (CSA vehicle) treated control. Administration of antihypertensive drugs like diltiazem, enalapril or propranolol to CSA treated animals augmented the endothelial damage induced by CSA. These drugs also increased the bioavailability of CSA. However, administration of losartan to CSA treated animals produced a significant increase in endothelial dependent relaxation as compared to CSA treated control but did not affect the bioavailability of CSA significantly. The results suggest that losartan is safer compared to other antihypertensives for the treatment of CSA induced hypertension.",

The procedure included conventional sample loading either hydrodynamically or electrokinetically at longer injection times without polarity switching and EOF manipulation. In comparison to conventional injections, depending on the analyte, about several hundred- and a thousand-fold sensitivity enhancement was achieved with the hydrodynamic and the electrokinetic injections, respectively. The simple method developed was applied to the analysis of racemic analytes in serum samples and better recovery was achieved using hydrodynamic injection than electrokinetic injection.",

NYHA class, clinical symptoms and signs, vital signs, 5-item well-being rating scale and visual analogue scale improved during the survey. Side effects, mostly fatigue, hypotension, and dizziness, were reported for 6.5% and 5% of patients at 3 and 6 months and carvedilol had to be discontinued in 63 patients. A total of 55 deaths (1.5%) and 520 hospitalisations in 466 patients (13%) were recorded.

CYP1A, 2C, 2D and 3A activities were referred by ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation (EROD), tolbutamide hydroxylation (TBH), bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation (BLH) and midazolam 1'- and 4-hydroxylation respectively. The anti-rat CYP1A2 and CYP3A2 serum significantly inhibited EROD and midazolam 1'- and 4-hydroxylation, suggesting that EROD and midazolam 1'- and 4-hydroxylation were catalysed by CYP1A and 3A in cats respectively. Quinidine inhibited BLH in cats microsomes at quite low concentrations, suggesting that BLH was catalysed by CYP2D in cats. Tolbutamide hydroxylation activities were negligible in hepatic microsomes from both male and female cats, suggesting CYP2C activities of cats are extremely low. This suggests that CYP2C substrates should be carefully administered to cats. Although there is no sexual difference in CYP1A activities, there are differences in CYP2D and 3A activities of cats. CYP2D activities were higher (3-fold), but CYP3A activities were lower (one-fifth) in female cats. These results might suggest that CYP2D and 3A substrates should be prescribed for male and female cats using different dosage regimen.",

Furthermore, we succeeded in uptitration of carvedilol(5 to 10mg/day).

Based on our previous studies using photoaffinity-labeling techniques in characterizing the VMAT2-specific ligands ketanserin and tetrabenazine, this study describes the synthesis and characterization of a fluorenone-based compound, iodoaminoflisopolol (IAmF), as a photoprobe to identify the substrate binding site(s) of VMAT2. Using vesicles prepared from rat VMAT2 containing recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, we show the inhibition of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) uptake and [3H]dihydrotetrabenazine (TBZOH) binding by aminoflisopolol and iodoaminoflisopolol. The interaction of [125I]IAmF with VMAT2 is highly dependent on the presence of ATP and an intact proton gradient. We report a simple and novel method to distinguish between a ligand and substrate using classic compounds such as [3H]5-HT and [3H]TBZOH by incubating the compound with the vesicles followed by washes with isotonic and hypotonic solutions. Using this method, we confirm the characterization of IAmF as a novel VMAT2 substrate. Sf9 vesicles expressing VMAT2 show reserpine- and tetrabenazine-protectable photolabeling by [125I]IAmF. [125I]IAmF photolabeling of recombinant VMAT2, expressed in SH-SY5Y cells with an engineered thrombin site between transmembranes 6 and 7, followed by thrombin digestion, retained photolabel in a 22-kDa fragment, indicating that iodoaminoflisopolol binds to the C-terminal half of the VMAT2 molecule. Thus, IAmF possesses a unique combination of VMAT2 substrate properties and a photoprobe and is, therefore, useful to identify the substrate binding site of the vesicular transporter.", 
    "120": "Molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) nanoparticle-on-microspheres (NOM) selective for S-propranolol were successfully prepared using suspension polymerization involving agitation of the reaction mixture at high speed. The integration of the MIP-NOM into a self-assembled porous cellulose membrane allowed a controlled distribution and availability of the molecule recognition sites within a porous structure. The nature of the membrane-included microparticles determined the degree of porosity whilst the adherent nanoparticles provided an increased surface area enabling the composite membrane to be employed efficiently for the trans-membrane transport of the imprinted molecule. The MIP-NOM within the membrane were easily accessible for binding of the imprinted molecule and appeared to maintain high selectivity, indicating that the composite membranes may potentially provide valuable affinity matrices. In this study, the application for MIP-NOM composite cellulose membranes were investigated for their potential to act as transdermal drug delivery systems for the S-enantiomers from racemic propranolol, its ester prodrugs (cyclopropanoyl- and valeryl-propranolol) or other beta-blockers (pindolol and oxprenolol). The enantioselective release of the fluorescently active 1-pyrene-butyryl ester prodrug of S-propranolol from MIP-NOM composite membranes and its diffusion and transit across excised rat skin was monitored by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The mechanism underlying the release of S-propranolol from the MIP-NOM composite membrane was found to involve specific adsorption and mobility of this enantiomer at the binding site in the MIP-NOM as the latter undergo a transition from the dry to wet state. The proposed MIP-NOM composite membrane controlled release system may be applicable for fabrication of novel membranes with self-controllable permeability responding to the presence of target solutes.",

The simulated plasma concentrations and AUC values of propranolol increased proportionally to its dose; these levels were almost equivalent to intrinsic clearance (CLint1), presumed to be non-saturable. When Michaelis-Menten parameters were decreased to one twentieth, plasma concentrations slightly increased after 160 mg dosing. A similar result was obtained with steady-state plasma levels after repeated administration. On the other hand, the first-order absorption rate constant of propranolol did not affect AUC values. The dose-normalized AUC value started to increase about 10(3)mg dosing. When the dose exceed 10(6)mg dose, the CLint1 component hardly contributed to propranolol pharmacokinetics.

We measured the short-circuit current (I(sc)) sensitive to benzamil (a specific ENaC blocker). The benzamil-sensitive I(sc) (Na+ absorption) in NP was larger than that in PSM. The mRNA expression of three subunits of ENaC was as follows: alpha>beta>gamma in both tissue, NP and MS. The mRNA expression of gamma subunit of ENaC in NP was larger than that in PSM, but no difference of mRNA expression of alpha or beta ENaC subunit between NP and PSM was detected. We found correlation of the Na+ absorption to mRNA expression of gamma ENaC in NP and PSM. Forskolin diminished the Na+ absorption associated with an increase in Cl- secretion. These observations suggest that: (1) human NP absorbs more ENaC-mediated Na+ than PSM, (2) expression of gamma ENaC in plays a key role in the ENaC-mediated Na+ absorption in NP and PSM, and (3) cAMP diminishes the ENaC-mediated Na+ absorption by stimulating Cl- secretion (diminution of driving force for Na+ absorption) in NP and PSM.",

Ventricular fibrillation that does not respond to the first few defibrillation attempts is associated with mortality rates of up to 97%. Currently, no pharmacological intervention has been shown to increase long-term survival in patients with shock-refractory VF. The purpose of this review article is to evaluate whether beta-blocker administration during the resuscitation of cardiac arrest from VF or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) improves outcome. We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for human clinical trials, animal experimental trials, review articles, case reports and abstracts published between 1966 and September 2006. No human prospective randomized controlled trial has studied the effects of beta-blocker administration during VF directly. Prospective trials of anti-arrhythmics with beta-blocking properties have been published, as well as several case reports/case series and experimental animal studies. The evidence thus far suggests that beta-blockade during resuscitation from VF may be associated with increasing rates of resuscitation, greater post-resuscitation survival, and improved post-resuscitation myocardial function. These positive effects on outcome may be mediated by a decrease in the oxygen requirements of the fibrillating heart, thus improving the overall balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand during resuscitation. While no significant detrimental effects directly related to low dose beta-blockade during VF have been reported in the studies reviewed, concerns relating to possible loss of myocardial contractility and hypotension remain.

Insects were chosen as indicators because they are known to react very quickly to environmental perturbations, mainly at the community level. In fact, the coenosis is the functional unit interacting with biotic and abiotic environmental parameters. Seven taxa, known for their sensitivity to habitat alterations, were sampled and grouped in functional groups: predators and parasitoids, phytophagouses and pollinators. The coenotic balance between these two functional groups was analyzed. The study was carried out in an organic olive orchard in the municipality of Terranova da Sibari, Cosenza, Southern Italy. The tested active agents (Azadirachtin, Rotenone, Copper Oxychloride) were sprayed twice (end of September and middle October). During the treatments the population dynamics of all the taxa were knocked-down. No one tested compound seems to be harmless to the entomocoenosis, particularly on phytophagouses and pollinators.

The activity of sphingomyelinases was measured by NBD-ceramide release while immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were applied to analyze protein tyrosine phosphorylation. A complex pattern of protein phosphorylation was found to accompany Fc gamma RII activation and the phosphorylation was either diminished by imipramine or increased by B13, modulators of acid sphingomyelinase and acid ceramidase activity. The effects of the drugs on the phosphorylation of Fc gamma RII and NTAL were prominent and correlated with a reduction of the cell surface ceramide production by imipramine and an augmentation of the ceramide generation by B13. The ceramide generation followed activation of acid sphingomyelinase and preceded that of neutral sphingomyelinase. The level of cell surface ceramide was additionally elevated by exogenous bacterial sphingomyelinase, but only at later stages of the receptor activation. The total mass of ceramide was diminished in the course of receptor activation pointing to an engagement of enzymes metabolizing ceramide. The data indicate that Fc gamma RII activates enzymes of the sphingomyelin cycle which affect various sphingomyelin/ceramide pools in a cell.", 
    "146": "The cardiovascular effects of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (40 mg) were compared in 20 alcohol-dependent subjects during alcohol withdrawal syndrome (WS; n=10) on days 1, 2, 3, and 10 to those during remission (n=10; 50 +/- 7.7 days). Significant differences were observed in negative chronotropic and hypotensive effects during withdrawal compared to remission. The initial level of hemodynamics prior to propranolol administration was the most important factor modifying the drug responses. The amount of daily consumption of alcohol also predicted to some extent the effects of propranolol. The WS-related changes in peripheral and central beta-adrenergic system were most likely responsible for the differences in propranolol actions.",

    "151": "Five poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) matrix membrane electrodes responsive to the beta-blockers atenolol (AT), bisoprolol fumarate (BI), timolol maleate (TI), and levobunolol HCl (LV) were developed and characterized. A precipitation-based technique with ammonium reineckate anion as an electroactive material in PVC matrix with AT, BI, TI, and LV cations was used for fabrication of Electrodes 1-4, respectively. Electrode 5 fabrication was based on precipitation of LV cation with tungstophosphate anion as an electroactive material. Fast and stable Nernstian responses at 1 x 10(-2)-1 x 10(-7) M for different beta-blockers over the pH range of 2-8 were found for these electrodes, which were evaluated according to International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry recommendations. The method was successively applied for the determination of beta-blockers in their pharmaceutical formulations. Validation of the method according to quality assurance standards showed the suitability of the proposed electrodes for use in the quality control assessment of these drugs. The recoveries for the determination of the beta-blocker drugs by the 5 proposed selective electrodes were 100.1 +/- 0.7, 99.9 +/- 0.8, 100.0 +/-1.1, 100.5 +/- 1.1, and 100.6 +/- 0.7% for Sensors 1-5, respectively. Statistical comparison between the results obtained by this method and the official method of the drugs was performed and no significant difference was found.", 
    "152": "Two simple, sensitive, and specific spectrofluorometric procedures have been developed for the determination of labetalol (LBT) in pharmaceuticals and biological fluids. LBT was found to react with Al3+, both in acetate buffer of pH 4.5 (Procedure I) and borate buffer of pH 8.0 (Procedure II), to produce highly fluorescent stable complexes. The fluorescence intensity could be enhanced by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate, resulting in 3.5- and 2.7-fold increases in the fluorescence intensity for Procedures I and II, respectively. In both procedures, the fluorescence intensity was measured at 408 nm after excitation at 320 nm. The different experimental parameters affecting the development and stability of the fluorescent products were carefully studied and optimized. The fluorescence intensity-concentration plots were rectilinear over the range of 0.02-0.1 and 0.01-0.05 microg/mL with a detection limit of 0.003 and 0.001 microg/mL for Procedures I and II, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to commercial tablets containing LBT. The results were in good agreement with those obtained using a reference spectrofluorometric method. Furthermore, the method was applied for the determination of LBT in spiked human plasma, and the recovery (n = 4) was 93.30 +/- 2.62%. A proposal of the reaction pathway was postulated for Procedures I and II, respectively.", 
    "153": "Pharmacogenetics, which aims at the development of'personal pills', is an attractive field in modern medicine. However, the results obtained in the last few years are somewhat disappointing. Recently, a genetic polymorphism was discovered in the treatment of chronic heart failure with beta-blockers. An in-vitro study revealed a hypersensitivity of the Arg389 variant in the beta1-adrenergic receptor to the beta-blocker carvedilol. Interestingly, this polymorphism also has ethnic aspects: the allele frequency of the Arg389 variant is 20% lower in Negroes than in Caucasians. If this result can be confirmed in other studies, one should consider testing for this polymorphism before carvedilol is prescribed. The manufacturer of carvedilol might well consider offering to test the patient's DNA for this polymorphism.",

    "159": "Forty patients with spontaneous VTA and induced VTA associated with CAD (n = 23) and IDCM (n = 17) were studied. In all patients, sotalol was prescribed and an electrophysiologic study (EPS) was performed to evaluate its effect on the induction of VTA. There were no significant differences in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between CAD and IDCM (35%+/- 10% vs. 35%+/- 12%).", 
    "160": "After sotalol, there were no significant differences in the QTc interval on electrocardiogram (ECG) or in the effective refractory period in the apex of the right ventricle between the two groups, but sotalol was more effective in preventing the induction of VTA in CAD than in IDCM (65% vs. 29%; P < 0.05). During a mean follow-up period of 47 +/- 27 months, the overall VTA recurrence rate was significantly lower in CAD than in IDCM (P < 0.01). The all-cause mortality rate tended to be lower in CAD than in IDCM, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.07). Electrical storm (ES) occurred more frequently in IDCM than in CAD, (41% vs. 13%; P < 0.05), and all patients with ES (n = 10) failed to respond to sotalol as assessed by EPS.",

    "162": "Cardiovascular risk factors are often ineffectively controlled in hypertensive postmenopausal women, and moreover, some antihypertensive drugs may increase particular risk factors such as insulin resistance. In a multicenter, multinational (Finland, Sweden, Lithuania), double-blind, prospectively randomized study hypertensive obese postmenopausal women without hormone therapy (n = 98) were randomly assigned to receive treatment with either the centrally acting agent moxonidine, 0.6 mg/day, or with the peripherally acting atenolol, 50 mg/day, for 8 weeks. In addition to blood pressure measurements, insulin sensitivity was estimated by the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) and by the insulin sensitivity index (ISI-Matsuda). Subgroup analysis in insulin-resistant women (fasting P-insulin > or = 10 mU/l) and blood pressure responders (diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mmHg and/or reduction of blood pressure > or = 10 mmHg) were also carried out. Both atenolol and moxonidine led to a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure of 9.5 mmHg and 6.2 mmHg, respectively. Among insulin-resistant women, an increase in the insulin sensitivity assessed by ISI was improved with moxonidine treatment (p = 0.025). A decrease in insulin sensitivity assessed by QUICKI was observed with atenolol treatment in women with fasting insulin level < 10 mU/l. In patients, in whom blood pressure was reduced, an improvement in insulin sensitivity (ISI) was associated with moxonidine treatment (p = 0.019), but not with atenolol treatment. The centrally acting sympatholytic agent moxonidine did reduce blood pressure somewhat less than atenolol, but it was associated with an improved metabolic profile in terms of decreased insulin resistance both in insulin-resistant postmenopausal women and in women with a significant blood pressure response.", 
    "163": "Arterial hypertension is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, proportional to the blood pressure level. Treating hypertension reduces the risk. Until recently, beta-blockers were considered as a first line class for hypertension management. The British Hypertension Society has recently pronounced that using beta-blockers as first line antihypertensive therapy is no good choice since these agents are less protective than other antihypertensive classes against cardiovascular disorders and diabetes mellitus, especially when used in association with diuretics.", 
    "164": "For patients presenting predominantly or purely with tremor, the correct diagnosis of tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease (PD) versus essential tremor (ET) is very important for prognosis and effective therapy. ET tremor is usually characterized by symmetric bilateral postural and kinetic tremor, which may respond to low alcohol consumption. Many patients have a family history of ET tremors. Medical treatment with primidone or beta-blockers effectively controls ET tremor, but in many cases no treatment is needed at all. The typical tremor form of PD is an asymmetric rest tremor, which is treated with dopaminergic agents such as levodopa. Differential diagnosis of ET and PD may be difficult in a subset of PD patients who present with additional postural and kinetic tremor and in a minority of ET patients who show a clear asymmetry of their postural and kinetic tremor. In some patients with ET, the tremor can later become severe and even require treatment with deep brain stimulation.", 
    "165": "Calcium channel inhibitors have been extensively used to treat arterial hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and supraventricular rhythm irregularities. The poisonings by that category of drugs are extremely dangerous, particularly when accompanied by intoxication with other drugs affecting the circulatory function. This paper reports 3 cases of poisonings with calcium channel inhibitors (verapamil and diltiazem) in combination with angiotensin convertase inhibitors and nonselective beta-adrenolytics. Circulatory insufficiency and cardiac rhythm abnormalities were noted in all reported cases, in one in the form of ventricular bigeminy and two episodes of ventricular fibrillation, while in the two other cases in the form of 1 degree atrioventricular block. The persisting hypotonia combined with heart rhythm disturbances could not be prevented by the typical conservative treatment involving intravenous administration of infusion fluids, calcium formulations, catecholamines and atropin. The application of 4-amino-pyridine (Pymadin) caused that arterial tension and heart rate were higher, and the heart rhythm disturbances disappeared. The reported cases suggest a beneficial effect of 4-aminopyridine used to treat cases of poisonings by calcium channel inhibitors; however, up to the present time, no detailed procedures have been determined for 4-aminopyridine administration in cases like those reported above. 4-aminopyridine has not been included in the list of the antidotes approved by the WHO and, therefore, broader tests and more clinical observations are required to confirm its therapeutic value.", 
    "166": "The use of CE coupled with MS (CE-MS) has evolved as a useful tool to analyze charged species in small sample volumes. Because of its sensitivity, versatility and ease of implementation, the ESI interface is currently the method of choice to hyphenate CE to MS. An alternative can be the atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) source, however, numerous parameters must be optimized for its coupling to CE. After evaluation of the sheath liquid composition and the CE capillary outlet position, an experimental design methodology was assessed for optimizing other ionization source parameters, such as sheath liquid flow rate, drying gas flow rate and temperature, nebulizing gas pressure, vaporizer temperature, and capillary voltage. For this purpose, a fractional factorial design (FFD) was selected as a screening procedure to identify factors which significantly influence sensitivity and efficiency. A face-centered central composite design (CCD) was then used to predict and optimize sensitivity, taking into account the most relevant variables. Sensitivity was finally evaluated with the optimized conditions and height-to-noise ratios (H/N) around 10 were achieved for an injection of 200 ng/mL of each analyte.", 
    "167": "The role of beta-blockers in uncomplicated hypertension has been challenged recently. Compared with other antihypertensives, beta-blockers are less effective for preventing cardiovascular events in patients with uncomplicated hypertension. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials concluded that atenolol is not more efficacious than placebo for preventing cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. Although these agents lower blood pressure measured conventionally over the brachial artery with a blood pressure cuff, they do not exert a commensurate effect on blood pressure in the central aorta. Central aortic blood pressure and aortic augmentation index are strong predictors of left ventricular hypertrophy, an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. Emerging data are illuminating the antihypertensive paradox whereby antihypertensive agents may elicit discordant effects on central and peripheral blood pressure and hemodynamics. Vasodilatory antihypertensives, such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, elicit reductions in central aortic blood pressure equal to or greater than that in the brachial artery. Conversely, beta-blockers lower central aortic blood pressure to a lesser degree even when blood pressure measured by sphygmomanometry is reduced substantially. Given the strong relationship between central aortic blood pressure and target organ damage, the effectiveness of beta-blockers may be overestimated in practice on the basis of conventional blood pressure measurements alone. Differences in central and peripheral blood pressure may account for the lack of cardiovascular protection afforded by beta-blockers in clinical trials and could account for a portion of the apparent \"benefit beyond blood pressure\" reduction with other classes of antihypertensive agents. Future studies should aim to better clarify the role of central aortic blood pressure in the treatment of hypertension. In the meantime, the effects of antihypertensive drugs on blood pressure \"beyond the brachial blood pressure cuff\" should be considered when prescribing antihypertensive agents for a patient.", 
    "168": "Class III antiarrhythmic agents are used for conversion to and maintenance of sinus rhythm from arrhythmias of atrial or ventricular origin. Monotherapy can be limited by adverse events or recurrent arrhythmias. Sotalol, dofetilide, and ibutilide may induce torsade de pointes in 2-8% of patients, whereas amiodarone induces torsade de pointes in less than 1%. We reviewed the literature regarding the possible combination of class III antiarrhythmics and risk for inducing torsade de pointes. Animal studies using amiodarone plus sotalol or d-sotalol suggest that these drug combinations prolong the QTc interval but do not induce torsade de pointes. Similar data extracted from human studies of ibutilide in patients also receiving amiodarone or sotalol showed greater efficacy with combination therapy than with monotherapy, without increased torsade de pointes induction. Reduced transmural dispersion of repolarization with amiodarone and sotalol combination therapy may serve as a mechanism for reducing the risk of torsade de pointes compared with sotalol monotherapy."
