    "0": "Seizure thresholds were determined by timed infusion of a convulsant drug. Following an electroconvulsive shock (ECS) rats exhibited a raised seizure threshold to infusion of the GABA antagonist drugs, pentylenetetrazol, bicuculline and isopropyl-bicyclophosphate, but not to the glycine antagonist strychnine or the 5-HT agonist, quipazine. The increase in threshold was seen following a bicuculline-induced seizure and 30 min following the last of a course of ECS given once daily for 10 days. The rise in seizure threshold still occurred when animals were pretreated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (200 mg . kg-1), p-chlorophenylalanine (200 mg . kg-2), naloxone (1 mg . kg-1) or indomethacin (20 mg . kg-1). Diazepam (2 mg . kg-1), flurazepam (10 mg . kg-1) and sodium valproate (400 mg . kg-1) elevated basal seizure threshold and a further rise followed the ECS. Phenytoin (40 mg . kg-1) and carbamazepine (40 mg . kg-1) had no effect on basal seizure threshold or the ECS-induce rise. (\u00bfPropranolol (20 mg . kg-1) did not affect basal seizure threshold but prevented the ECS-induced increase. The rise in seizure threshold following a convulsion may be an important adaptive mechanism which could be related to the reported increase in specific benzodiazepine binding following a seizure.", 
    "1": "Muscarinic and beta-adrenergic ligands associate with polymorphonuclear leukocytes to show high-affinity, saturable accumulation. This association can be distinguished from specific receptor binding by its temperature dependence, sensitivity to pH, requirement of an energy source, inhibition by ionophores, and inhibition by a variety of permeable basic amines. Our results suggest that these amines accumulate in acidic lysosomes which are plentiful in these cells. This permeable amine effect can be inhibited without affecting specific receptor binding.", 
    "2": "The interaction of propranolol with model phospholipid membranes was studied using various experimental techniques. The partition coefficient of propranolol in the negatively charged membranes of vesicles prepared from phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid was found to be more than 20-times higher than in neutral phosphatidylcholine membranes. Preferential interaction of propranolol with acidic phospholipid membranes was confirmed using the monolayer compression isotherm technique and the spin-labelling method. Phosphatidylserine monolayers were markedly expanded even at a relatively low drug concentration (5 . 10(-6) M). In contrast, the effect of propranolol on phosphatidylcholine monolayers was much smaller, being detectable only at a higher concentration of the drug (1 . 10(-4) M). Spin-labeling experiments show that propranolol exerts marked ordering effect on bilayers prepared from acidic phospholipids and does not change the order parameter of phosphatidylcholine membranes. The dependence of the propranolol fluorescence spectrum on the polarity of the solvent allowed us to identify the intercalation region of the drug in the membrane. The fluorophore moiety of propranolol was found to be localized in the lipid polar head groups region of the bilayer. The role of electrostatic and hydrophobic effects in propranolol-membrane interaction is discussed and the effect of propranolol on the ordering of phospholipid bilayers is compared with the effects of other anesthetic-like molecules.", 
    "3": "Some humoral and cellular immune functions were evaluated in a group of 10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis before and after 3 months of treatment with the beta-blocking agent propranolol. Humoral parameters measured were serum immunoglobulins including IgE, auto-antibodies, C-reactive protein, total haemolytic complement activity and the complement components C3 and C4. Cellular functions assessed were polymorphonuclear leucocyte chemotaxis, phagocytosis and postphagocytic nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, hexose monophosphate shunt activity and myeloperoxidase-mediated iodination of ingested protein; lymphocyte transformation to the mitogens phytohaemagglutinin and concanavalin A was also investigated. No alteration of humoral factors and neutrophil functions was observed following propranolol administration (40 mg 3 times a day), but lymphocyte transformation was significantly increased. Improved lymphocyte function did not correlate with clinical improvement.", 
    "4": "Exercise or isoproterenol infusion may evoke ventricular arrhythmias in patients with the long QT syndrome. We examined the electrocardiographic effects of the Valsalva maneuver in eight patients with the long QT syndrome and nine healthy subjects. The Valsalva maneuver lengthened the QTc interval in both groups, but the lengthening was greater in the patients. In the patients who were having frequent attacks of ventricular tachycardia, the Valsalva-induced prolongation of the QTc interval was particularly remarkable and was associated with the development of T-wave alternans and short runs of ventricular tachycardia. Propranolol effectively suppressed the lengthening of the QTc interval during Valsalva strain and prevented Valsalva-induced ventricular arrhythmia. These results suggest that the Valsalva maneuver may be useful in evaluating the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and the efficacy of drug treatment in patients with the long QT syndrome.", 
    "5": "Effects of isoproterenol and propranolol on regional pulmonary perfusion were assessed in the dog. In each experiment the right upper lobe was isolated in vivo by a balloon catheter and artificially ventilated with nitrogen, air or 60% oxygen in nitrogen before and after administration of the medicaments listed above. The rest of the lungs kept breathing air spontaneously. Following administration of isoproterenol regional pulmonary perfusion increased in the hypoxic right upper lobe induced by artificial ventilation with nitrogen, but the increase was not observed when isoproterenol was administered following pretreatment with propranolol. Administration of propranolol alone did not induce any change in regional pulmonary perfusion distribution. When artificial ventilation was done in the right upper lobe either with air or 60% oxygen in nitrogen, thus inducing regional less hypoxia or hyperoxia, no change in regional perfusion was observed with any of the medication. Thus isoproterenol reversed regional hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, but its action was blocked by pretreatment with propranolol. Propranolol per se, however, showed no effect on pulmonary vascular responses to the different alveolar oxygen tensions.", 
    "6": "1. The occurrence of dietary and cold-induced thermogenesis in young rabbits was unaffected by noradrenaline or propranolol, and it is concluded that the brown adipose tissue, although detectable histologically, is non-functional. 2. Noradrenaline treatment caused an increase in oxygen consumption in albino, but not in hooded rats, suggesting that the former breed may possess brown adipose tissue capable of thermogenesis.", 
    "7": "Electrical and mechanical activities of the isolated guinea pig papillary muscle were measured simultaneously, and the effects of various degrees of hypoxia and metabolic inhibitors were examined. Hypoxia selectively diminished the action potential duration (APD) dependently upon the degree of hypoxia with little affecting the other parameters of the action potential. Hypoxia concomitantly depressed the contractile force (CF), but the decrease in CF always preceded the decrease in APD; thus, the complete excitation-contraction uncoupling was sometimes observed. Metabolic inhibitors (dinitrophenol, DNP and monoiodoacetic acid, IAA) produced qualitatively the same changes in the electrical and mechanical activities. However, DNP mimicked hypoxia better than IAA which produced rather parallel decreases in CF and APD. The slow response action potential (elicited after inactivation of the excitatory fast Na system of the membrane) was completely blocked by hypoxia and metabolic inhibitors, which was partially restored by isoproterenol, histamine and tetraethylammonium. When isoproterenol was present in the bathing solution, the decreases in CF and APD produced by hypoxia were accelerated, but ATP and propranolol did not significantly modify the hypoxically induced changes.", 
    "8": "1 The uptake of (+/-)-[14C]-oxprenolol and (+/-)-[14C]propranolol has been studied in rat lung slices. The loss of these two radiolabelled beta-adrenoceptor antagonists from pre-loaded lung slices has also been studied. 2 Over the concentration range studied (3.3 x 10(-7)M to 1.7 x 10(-3)M) a biphasic uptake of both compounds was observed. At concentration below 1.5 x 10(-4)M approximately, there was some evidence of saturability, but at higher concentrations uptake appeared to be a linear function of drug concentration. 3 At concentrations of 6.6 x 10(-7)M and 1.7 x 10(-6)M respectively, the uptake of oxprenolol and propranolol was significantly reduced by low temperature, anaerobic conditions, incubation in NA+-free medium, and by the metabolic inhibitors potassium cyanide and 2,4-dinitrophenol. Ouabain had little or no effect. 4 At the same concentration, oxprenolol uptake was also inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by propranolol, amphetamine, chlorpromazine and imipramine. Noradrenaline was without effect. 5 The loss of oxprenolol and propranolol from lung slices preloaded with the two compounds was fairly slow, with 60 to 70% of the drug originally taken up still remaining in the tissue after 30 min in fresh medium. 6 Possible mechanisms underlying the pulmonary accumulation of oxprenolol and propranolol are discussed.", 
    "9": "A case of timolol-associated heart failure in a 73-year old white man is reported. The patient, with a history of cardiovascular disease and glaucoma, was admitted to the hospital because of complaints of shortness of breath, orthopnea, and reduced exercise tolerance. Chest roentgenogram showed interstitial congestive failure, and an EKG demonstrated sinus bradycardia. The patient's medications before admission included quinidine, isosorbide dinitrate, dipyridamole, aspirin, pilocarpine eyedrops 4%, timolol eyedrops 0.5%, and nitroglycerin ointment and sublingual tablets. On the second day of hospitalization, it was noted that the patient's dyspnea and sinus bradycardia could be related to a recent increase in his timolol dosage. The timolol was discontinued, and the patient's heart rate increased. As the patient's pulse rate increased, the symptoms of congestive heart failure disappeared. This case demonstrated the importance of obtaining complete drug histories from patients. The potential for adverse system reactions resulting from topical medications should be considered.", 
    "10": "Propranolol is widely employed in hemodialysis patients for the control of renin-dependent hypertension. Infrequent reports have linked hypoglycemia and propranolol, especially in complex situations such as malnutrition, anesthesia, and excessive insulin use. Three patients on maintenance hemodialysis taking propranolol developed severe hypoglycemia resulting in cardiac arrest. The life-threatening hypoglycemia occurred without apparent precipitating cause and unaccompanied by the classical signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. These three cases suggest that propranolol in a setting of chronic renal failure and dialysis may bring about severe hypoglycemia, a complication previously unsuspected.", 
    "11": "1 The effects of oxprenolol 80 mg and propranolol 80 mg on resting forearm blood flow (RFBF) and skin temperature were compared in seven normotensive subjects, for 4 h after an oral dose. 2 There was a significant fall of RFBF after propranolol (mean +/- s.e. mean 0.74 +/- 0.24 ml 100 g-1 min-1) compared to a smaller non-significant reduction after oxprenolol (0.35 +/- 0.19 ml 100 g-1 min-1). Propranolol produced a greater fall in heart rate than oxprenolol at all times except at 2.5 h. Three subjects experienced falls in skin temperature of over 4 degrees C with propranolol. There were no comparable falls after oxprenolol. 3 The results suggest that at the same dose oxprenolol has less effect on RFBF and skin temperature than propranolol.", 
    "12": "The cardiovascular responses to intravenous doses of isoproterenol were measured in eight male volunteers before and during administration of 50 mg metoprolol, orally every 6 hours and 40 mg propranolol, orally every 6 hours for a total of five doses. The dose of isoproterenol required to produce an increase in heart rate of 25 beats/min (the ID25) was 2.0 +/- 1.4 microgram before beta blockade, 6.2 +/- 4.4 microgram during metoprolol, and 44.4 +/- 12.0 microgram during propranolol administration. Similar changes in diastolic blood pressure, QS2I, preejection period, and preejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio occurred at the ID25 during treatment with both metoprolol and propranolol. In volunteers, propranolol produces a much more intense blockade of the inotropic and chronotropic effects of isoproterenol than does metoprolol.", 
    "13": "This study investigates the use of propranolol and nifedipine in the treatment of angina pectoris. The clinical response and the effects on the precordial 16-lead electrocardiogram before and after exercise were studied in 52 patients with frequent angina pectoris. Relief of chest pain and abolition of exercise-induced ST-segment depression was achieved in 16 patients on treatment with propranolol alone (mean dose, 300 mg/d). Of the remaining 36 patients, the precordial area and severity of exercise-induced ST-segment depression were unchanged in 8 patients, of whom 2 reported they were free from chest pain, improved in 10 patients of whom 4 reported they were free of chest pain, and abolished in 14 patients, all of whom were free from chest pain following treatment with both propranolol and nifedipine (mean dose, 50 mg/d). Four patients were unable to tolerate this combination. This study has shown that in patients who do not respond to treatment with propranolol alone the combination of propranolol and nifedipine can be used to control not only anginal pain, but also the precordial electrocardiographic manifestations of ischemia.", 
    "14": "The authors studied the variations in the effects of isoprenaline hydrochloride on heart rate (beta 1) and on peripheral blood flow of the upper extremity (beta 2), determined by plethysmography, in a group of 5 men with a mean age of 31 +/- 3 years. The trial was conducted on a single-blind cross-over basis, each subject being infused over 30 min with propranolol (30 microgram/kg), acebutolol (150 microgram/kg) or a placebo (isotonic glucose solution) with at least an 8-day interval between each administration. At the end of the infusion they received isoprenaline (0.01 to 0.075 microgram/kg, in logarithmic progression) every 15 min, for 1 hour. The doses of isoprenaline were injected randomly using a latin square design. The peripheral flow, assessed by the curve of the initial part of the plethysmogram for the first 10 sec, increased with the dose of isoprenaline in the placebo series (Tg alpha = 219.9 log d + 583.4; p less than .01), did not increase in the propranolol series and increased with the dose in the acebutolol series (Tg alpha = 221.5 log d + 567.7; p less than .01); the variations in flow with isoprenaline after placebo and after acebutolol, did not differ significantly. The hear rate increased with the dose of isoprenaline in the placebo series (+55%) although tachycardia was inhibited by propranolol and acebutolol. Under the experimental conditions of this trial, propranolol inhibited beta 1 and beta 2 receptors at the same time, whereas acebutolol inhibited only beta 1 receptors.", 
    "15": "Cardiovascular effects after intravenous administration of dihydralazine (0.5 mg/kg), diazoxide (10 mg/kg) and minoxidil (1 mg/kg) were studied in normotensive (NT) and renal hypertensive rats (HT) pretreated or not for seven consecutive day with propranolol (5 mg/kg per os). The hypotension induced by the three vasodilators in NT and HT rats was caused by decreased peripheral resistance and, in the case of minoxidil in HT rats by decreased cardiac output as well. Propranolol pretreatment of HT rats decreases the hypotensive effect induced by the three vasodilators. In the cases of dihydralazine and diazoxide, this effect is due to a lesser decrease of peripheral resistance; with minoxidil, it results from the absence of decreased cardiac output. Pretreatment of hypertensive rats with propranolol (5 mg/kg per os) for one week had no effect on blood pressure, but decreased heart rate and cardiac output and increased peripheral vascular resistance. Despite these cardiovascular modifications, the reactiveness to intravenous isoprenaline (1 to 4 microgram/kg) was the same in control and propranolol pretreated animals.", 
    "16": "Timolol has become a frequent choice in the drug therapy for glaucoma. Its popularity has been enhanced by the initial trials which led to the belief that this medication would control glaucoma without side effects. More recent clinical evidence indicates that although timolol is a useful therapeutic, it is not free from all side effects as previously believed.", 
    "17": "1. Plasma noradrenaline concentrations and blood pressure were measured in 45 patients with essential hypertension and 34 matched normotensive subjects. Plasma noradrenaline was similar in both groups, but in the hypertensive patients plasma noradrenaline correlated with blood pressure. 2. The increase in forearm flow in response to an intra-arterial infusion of phentolamine was determined in 12 of the hypertensive and 14 of the normotensive subjects to assess the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated component of vascular resistance. Although the dilator response to phentolamine was similar in both groups, in the hypertensive patients it was correlated with the control plasma noradrenaline (r = 0.83, P less than 0.01) as well as the height of mean blood pressure (r = 0.73, P less than 0.01). 3. These results suggest that in hypertensive patients plasma noradrenaline can be a marker for both sympathetic activity and the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated component of vascular resistance.", 
    "18": "We have analyzed a conditioned avoidance response (CAR) in rats, under both normoxia and hypobaric hypoxia (300 torr), to try to elucidate the mechanism of apomorphine's protective effect against hypoxia. The resistance to hypoxia is markedly increased by apomorphine (1 mg/kg i.p.) and, to a lesser degree, by an alpha-adrenergic pre-synaptic (yohimbine 1 mg/kg i.p.) or post-synaptic (phenoxybenzamine 1 mg/kg i.p.) blocker. The anti-hypoxic property of apomorphine is not altered when associated with domperidone (0.5 mg/kg i.p.), a peripheral blocker of the dopaminergic receptors. Resistance to hypoxia is decreased by propranolol (1 mg/kg i.p.) and pimozide (1 mg/kg i.p.). It is not modified by tylciprine (2 mg/kg i.p.) or by metergoline (2.5 mg/kg i.p.), a blocker of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5 H T) receptors. However, the association of any of the above pharmacological agents with apomorphine destroys apomorphine's anti-hypoxic effect. There has even been shown a positive potentialisation ( i.e. an increase of the inhibitory effect) between apomorphine, hypoxia, and the added drug. This potentialisation is already noticeable under normoxia for the association of each of the drugs with apomorphine. Free alpha, beta adrenergic, cerebral dopaminergic, and serotoninergic receptors and an intact amine metabolic pathway therefore seem required for apomorphine to develop its anti-hypoxic activity.", 
    "19": "A mass fragmentographic procedure was developed for measuring quantities of less than 1.0 ng of timolol/ml of plasma or urine. The lower limit of sensitivity was 0.5 ng of timolol maleate/ml of plasma. The unchanged drug was extracted into heptane--4% isopentyl alcohol from alkalinized plasma or urine, together with propranolol hydrochloride as the internal standard. The compounds were subsequently back-extracted into 0.1 N HCl and then into chloroform following adjustment of the acidic phase to an alkaline pH. The chloroform layer was evaporated to dryness, and the compounds were derivatized with N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide-acetonitrile to form the trimethylsilyl derivatives; these derivatives were quantitated by mass fragmentography. Recovery of timolol added to normal plasma and urine was quantitative and reproducible, and no interfering substances were observed in normal biological samples. After a 20-mg oral dose of timolol maleate, plasma levels of approximately 3.0 ng/ml were observed at 12 hr.", 
    "20": "Chronic in situ loops of dog small intestine (jejunum or ileum) were used to investigate the absorption of the beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents atenolol and propranolol. Absorption measurements were made in conscious dogs by monitoring drug disappearance from solution in the loop, with correction for intestinal water absorption. The jejunum had a mean resting pH of 7.3 and a slight net secretion of water into the lumen; the ileum had a resting pH of 7.9 and a strong net absorption of water. Propranolol absorption was rapid and first order in both regions, with the ileum showing faster absorption than the jejunum due to its higher resting pH. In contrast, atenolol absorption was negligible in the jejunum and only moderate in the ileum. The data were quantitatively consistent with the pH-partition mechanism for the absorption of propranolol but not for atenolol. The model was validated for atenolol by showing that, following drug administration into jejunal and ileal loops, drug disappearance rates were similar to absorption rates calculated from systemic blood levels. This technique is useful, realistic, and relatively simple for studying intestinal drug absorption without seriously perturbing normal GI conditions.", 
    "21": "The inhibitory effect of (+/-) propranolol 1.69 x 10(-4)-1.69 x 10(-7) mol litre-1 on normal and atypical plasma cholinesterase variants was investigated. The atypical enzyme is less sensitive to inhibition by (+/-) propranolol or either of its enantiomorphs than the usual enzyme. Propranolol 8.45 x 10(-6) mol litre-1 was used as differential inhibitor of 643 plasma samples from individuals of known genotype. Although the measurement of propranolol inhibition alone is not always unambiguous for assigning a definite genotype to a given individual, the correlation of propranolol inhibition with fluoride inhibition gives clear differentiation of the E1uE1u and E1UE1f phenotypes as well as other phenotypes.", 
    "22": "Oxprenolol is a non-selective adrenergic beta-receptor antagonist displaying beta-mimetic activity. To test the hypothesis that beta-mimetic activity could minimize the response of the circulation to adrenergic beta-receptor blockade, cumulative dose-response curves to oxprenolol 0.1-1.6 mg kg-1 were obtained in seven anaesthetized dogs. Anaesthesia was maintained with 0.5% halothane supplementing nitrous oxide 66% in oxygen, under moderately hypocapnic IPPV. Oxprenolol, up to 0.4 mg kg-1 i.v., caused modest increases in heart rate, LV dP/dt max and cardiac output. With the largest dose (1.6 mg kg-1), significant increases in heart rate (+19%), LV dP/dt max (+13%) and cardiac output (+27%) were observed while arterial pressure remained unchanged and systemic vascular resistance decreased (-18%).", 
    "23": "The initial topical administration of 1 drop of 0.25% timolol maleate in 25 nontreated ocular hypertensive patients resulted in a significant reduction of mean intraocular pressure one hour later, from a baseline of 28.1 +/- 5.3 (mean +/- SD) mm Hg to 18.5 +/- 4.5 mm Hg. Two patients (8%) failed to show at least a 10% decreases in IOP one hour after the initial administration. After three to four weeks of twice a day unilateral therapy with 0.25% timolol, mean IOP increased to 21.1 +/- 4.2 mm Hg. At this time seven patients (28%) failed to obtain a 10% decrease in IOP from topical timolol administration. Changing to 0.5% timolol for three to four weeks did not cause an additional significant lowering of IOP (20.4 +/- 3.5 mm Hg). At this time five patients (20%) had less than a 10% reduction in IOP. The one-hour response failed to predict future IOP nonresponsiveness.", 
    "24": "Oxprenolol and propranolol are noncardioselective beta adrenoreceptor blocking agents known to be equally effective in the management of patients with angina pectoris. Both are usually prescribed four times daily. Slow release formulation of oxprenolol administered once daily has been shown to maintain therapeutic effects for 24 hours. In a double-blind crossover study in 23 patients with stable angina pectoris, the effects of 160 mg slow release oxprenolol, administered once daily for 1 month, were compared with those of 40 mg of propranolol given four times daily for a similar period. No adverse effects occurred when patients were switched between treatment schedules. The average number of anginal attacks experienced were 11/month during oxprenolol therapy and 8/month during propranolol therapy (difference not significant). The resting values for heart rate were higher 7 1/2 nd 24 hours after oxprenolol than they were 4 and 12 hours after propranolol (p less than 0.01). The treadmill walking time to the onset of angina and to the development of moderate angina 24 hours after oxprenolol was less than that observed 7 1/2 hours after the drug or 4 and 12 hours after propranolol (p less than 0.01). In contrast, the values for walking time to the onset of angina and to the development of moderate angina at 4 and 12 hours after propranolol were similar. This decreased exercise tolerance 24 hours after oxprenolol was associated with a lesser degree of beta adrenoreceptor blockade than that present after propranolol as documented by higher levels of heart rate (p less than 0.05), systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05) and rate-pressure product (p less than 0.05) during exercise after oxprenolol therapy. It is concluded that in the doses used, slow release oxprenolol administered once daily does not exert as consistent a beneficial effect on exercise tolerance throughout the dosing schedule as does propranolol given four times daily.", 
    "25": "We gave increasing doses of metoprolol intravenously to seven subjects with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who were also receiving their usual bronchodilators. Six of the seven tolerated up to 0.2mg/kg metoprolol without adverse effects, although there were declines in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1). At 0.15 mg/kg mean FEV1 fell 12% (p less than 0.025), and at 0.2 mg/kg mean decline in FEV1 was 15% (p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that 0.2 mg/kg metoprolol may be given intravenously to most patients with COPD in addition to previously administered bronchodilators without precipitating clinically significant adverse effects. Any side effects that develop can be reversed by beta agonists.", 
    "26": "Simultaneous occurrence of hyperglycaemia (up to 300 mg/100 ml) and hyperinsulinaemia (up to 1200 mu U/ml) was evident in the fed state in genetically diabetic KK mice, indicating insulin resistance. The hyperinsulinaemia was enhanced by alpha-adrenergic blockade and alleviated by B-blockade. Epinephrine-induced hyperglycaemia and isoproterenol-induced hyperinsulinaemia, both of which could be blocked by beta-adrenergic antagonists, were more marked in KK mice than in ICR mice. A possible significance of adrenergic mechanisms is discussed with respect to the aetiology of the metabolic disturbances characteristic of KK mice.", 
    "27": "The effects of autonomic blockade on plasma concentrations of immunoreactive insulin in the basal state and after stimulation with 4 different secretagogues were investigated in vivo in conscious mice. The muscarinic blocker methylatropine slightly depressed basal insulin, and almost totally abolished the insulin response to the cholinergic agonist carbachol, whereas the insulin response to glucose and glucagon was unaffected. Contrary to these findings, the insulin response to the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline was potentiated, by about 75%. The beta-adrenoceptor blocker L-propranolol depressed basal insulin by about 60%, and totally abolished the insulin responses to glucagon and terbutaline. The insulin response to glucose was slightly reduced and that to carbachol was unaffected by L-propranolol. The stereoisomer D-propranolol which is devoid of beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity but exerts local anaesthetic effect of the same potency as the Lpisomer, was without effect on basal insulin levels and the insulin responses to the different secretagogues. It is concluded that basal concentrations of immunoreactive insulin is substantially dependent on intact beta-adrenoceptors and more moderately dependent on intact muscarinic receptors. The insulin responses to terbutaline and glucagon are closely connected to beta-adrenoceptors, and the response to carbachol to the muscarinic receptors. Glucose-induced insulin response seems largely unaffected by autonomic receptor blockade although a slight reduction after beta-adrenoceptor blockade is demonstrable.", 
    "28": "The adrenergic modulation of immunoreactive insulin (IRI) and glucagon (IRG) secretion was studied in 5 massively obese subjects hospitalized ion a metabolic ward. Epinephrine was infused alone or in combination with propranolol, a beta adrenergic blocking drug, or with phentolamine, an alpha adrenergic blocking drug. Epinephrine infusion produced a significant (p less than .02) rise in IRG levels which was blocked by addition of either phentolamine or propranolol. Pure alpha adrenergic stimulation with propranolol-epinephrine infusion inhibited IRG secretion (p less than .02). IRI levels decreased with propranolol-epinephrine infusion (p less than .02), increased with phentolamine-epinephrine infusion, and were not affected by infusion of epinephrine alone. Glucose concentrations rose with all 3 infusions but were less with phentolamine-epinephrine. A control group of 4 lean outpatients on a ad lib diet demonstrated a similar pattern but the changes of IRG secretion were smaller than in the obese subjects and were not statistically significant. We conclude that in obese humans IRI secretion is increased by beta adrenergic stimulation, is decreased by alpha adrenergic stimulation, and is unaffected by combined alpha and beta adrenergic stimulation. In contrast, IRG secretion is stimulated by combined alpha and beta adrenergic stimulation, is inhibited by pure alpha adrenergic stimulation, and is unaffected by pure beta adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "29": "Ammonium salts were infused in intact, pancreatectomized, and adrenalectomized dogs to produce coma-inducing amounts of plasma ammonia. Changes in intact dogs included hyperglycemia, hyperglucagonemia, hyperinsulinemia, and decreases in plasma concentrations of glutamine, alanine, threonine, glycine, lysine, valine, proline, serine, arginine, leucine, isoleucine, and methionine. Urinary excretion of catecholamines increased more than 20-fold, whereas plasma hydrocortisone concentrations were essentially unchanged. In pancreatectomized dogs, ammonia infusions caused hyperglycemia, a mild hyperglucagonemia, and no changes in plasma amino acid concentrations, other than a decrease in alanine and an increase in taurine. In adrenalectomized dogs, ammonia infusion resulted in normoglycemia, hyperglucagonemia (comparable with that seen in intact dogs), hyperinsulinemia (2 to 3 times that seen in intact dogs), and decreased plasma concentrations of alanine, isoleucine, leucine, and valine. Finally, propranolol administration did not affect ammonia-induced glucagon and insulin release. The endocrine portion of the pancreas appears to mediate the major effects of ammonia on plasma amino acid values. The effect of ammonia in stimulating glucagon release may occur by an alpha-adrenergic pathway or by direct stimulation of pancreatic islet cells.", 
    "30": "1. We have measured plasma concentrations of renin, renin substrate and angiotensins I and II as well as plasma renin activity in nine patients with severe or malignant hypertension during treatment with captopril, hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol. 2. On captopril and hydrochlorothiazide the plasma concentrations of renin substrate and angiotensin II decreased markedly, while renin and angiotensin I levels were increased. 3. The changes in renin substrate concentration suggest a consumption of substrate induced by an increased renin release. Further, the positive feedback of angiotensin II on hepatic renin substrate synthesis may be inhibited. 4. The sequential changes in renin release during captopril treatment should be monitored by measuring plasma renin concentration since plasma renin activity measurements will be profoundly influenced by the marked changes in plasma renin substrate concentration.", 
    "31": "1. The metabolic response of lean and obese women to caffeine was studied to see if caffeine could be used to demonstrate the subnormal thermogenesis in obesity previously shown after standard meals or intravenous infusions of noradrenaline. 2. The rise in resting metabolic rate with caffeine was similar in the lean and obese groups and beta-adrenoceptor blockade did not reduce the increment in metabolic rate in either group. These responses did not, therefore, correspond with the other subnormal thermogenic responses of the constitutionally obese. 3. In a post-obese group, i.e. previously obese women who were now of normal weight, there was a reduced response of the resting metabolic rate to caffeine. 4. Monitoring plasma substrate concentrations showed that the change in oxygen uptake corresponded to changes in plasma free fatty acids, so that in adults the metabolic effects of caffeine seem to be mediated by increases in adipocyte lipolysis. This effect seems to be mainly independent of the adrenergic system.", 
    "32": "Two hundred and eighty-two patients less than 66 years of age admitted with suspected or definite myocardial infarction were allocated in a random fashion to treatment with alprenolol or placebo. Treatment was started immediately upon admission with 5-10 mg alprenolol or placebo intravenously, followed by 200 mg alprenolol or placebo orally twice a day for one year. In 178 patients a definite myocardial infarction was diagnosed. Myocardial infarct size could be estimated from serial determinations of serum total creatine kinase in 42 patients treated with alprenolol and 43 patients receiving placebos. Median infarct size was 20.6 CK g Eq/m2 body surface in the alprenolol group, the corresponding figure in the placebo group being 34.4 CK g Eq/m2 body surface. Median rate of release of creatine kinase from the ischaemic myocardium was 27.7 U/1 per hour and 48.0 U/1 per hour after alprenolol and placebo, respectively. Alprenolol limited infarct size significantly provided the treatment was started within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms.", 
    "33": "Insulin resistance was quantified with two different methods in 30 subjects with varying degrees of glucose tolerance. One method, the insulin suppression test, is performed by continuously infusing epinephrine, propranolol, insulin, and glucose. Epinephrine and propranolol suppress endogenous insulin release, and steady-state plasma levels of exogenous insulin and glucose are reached in all individuals. Because the steady-state insulin level is the same in all subjects, the height of the steady-state plasma glucose level provides a direct estimate of insulin resistance. The other method, the euglycemic clamp technique, produces a steady-state level of exogenous hyperinsulinemia by means of a primed and continuous insulin infusion. Glucose is also infused at a rate sufficient to prevent an insulin-induced fall in glucose concentration, and the amount of glucose required to maintain the basal plasma glucose level provides the estimates of insulin resistance. The results indicated that estimates of insulin resistance generated by the two methods were highly correlated (r = 0.93). Furthermore, both methods of assessing insulin resistance indicated that the greater the degree of glucose intolerance, the more severe the insulin resistance. These results serve to further emphasize the importance of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia in type II diabetes.", 
    "34": "Bronchomotor tone is, in part, under beta-adrenergic control, and beta-adrenergic agonists are commonly used in the therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol is contraindicated in asthmatic patients, yet little is known of its effect in patients with COPD. We studied 13 patients with COPD in a random-entry, double-blind crossover comparison of oral propranolol, 40 mg, and oral placebo on separate day. Pulmonary function worsened after administration of propranolol. Significant differences were present between the drugs' effect on heart rate, airway resistance, specific resistance, and flow rates at one hour, and persisting through four hours (p less than 0.01). Propranolol may have a deleterious effect on pulmonary function in nonasthmatic COPD. We conclude that when propranolol is to be used in patients with COPD, the short- and long-term effects on airway should be measured sequentially.", 
    "35": "A case of a 36-year-old man, with a history of traumatic amputation below the elbow on the left side, resulting in intractable phantom limb pain, is described. The patient failed to respond to a variety of medications including several analgesics, tranquilizers, and a beta-blocker. Other extended series of conventional treatment modalities, which included stellate ganglion and peripheral nerve blocks and neuromal excision with the anterior transposition of the ulnar nerve, did not relieve the pain. Acupuncture was then attempted with the subjective relief of phantom limb pain and the objective result that the patient could wear a prosthesis.", 
    "36": "Changes in plasma cortisol, glucose, cyclic AMP, blood leucocytes, pulse rate and body temperature were measured during and for 24 h after subtotal thyroidectomy in eight propranolol-treated (120-160 mg per day) mild to moderate thyrotoxic patients and eight patients with a non-toxic goitre. The results showed a similar metabolic response to surgery in the two groups without any trends towards a hypermetabolic response in the toxic group. The accumulating evidence of the safety of preoperative preparation with propranolol in patients with mild to moderate thyrotoxicosis is thus supported by our results.", 
    "37": "Many avian species demonstrate atherosclerosis and high blood pressure (BP) that are influenced by age, sex, diet, and environment, but show no arteriosclerosis in small vessels. Thus, we aimed to define neural and humoral control of BP in conscious, 32-wk-old female chickens, Gallus gallus. Mean aortic pressure (determined by chronically implanted catheter) was 137.6 +/- 2.0 mm Hg; heart rate was 295 +/- 4 beats/min. Plasma renin activity (PRA), measured by radioimmunoassay of fowl angiotensin I ([Asp1, Val5, Ser9]AI), and plasma angiotensinogen levels were 3.55 +/- 0.31 ng/ml/hr and 1229 +/- 66 ng/ml respectively. Repeated injection of propranolol (4 to 8 mg/kg/day, i.m.) decreased (p less than 0.01) the BP 19.1 +/- 3.0 mm Hg and heart rate 76 +/- 6 beats/min. Acute infusion of propranolol also markedly reduced BP and heart rate, and increased plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine. SQ 14,225 (20 mg/kg/day) reduced BP (p less than 0.01), but BP returned towards original levels unless a higher dose was given. PRA increased 2- to 6-fold. BP also decreased 31.0 +/- 2.1 mm Hg after reserpine treatment, but not after [Sar1, Ile8]AII. These results suggest that in maintaining BP in fowl the beta-adrenergic function is important, whereas the renin-angiotensin system may not have a primary role.", 
    "38": "The ability of selected vasoactive agents to influence cyclic AMP levels of confluent, early-passaged bovine calf aortic and pulmonary artery endothelial cells was investigated. Among the agents tested, only the catecholamines (isoproterenol, epinephrine, norepinephrine) and prostaglandins (PGE1, PGE2, PGF2 alpha) resulted consistently in increased cyclic AMP production in both cell populations. The degree of cyclic AMP stimulation obtained with other vasoactive compounds (angiotensins I and II, bradykinin, and serotonin) tended to be either very small or difficult to reproduce. Isoproterenol stimulation was blocked completely by propanolol, a beta-blocking agent, but not by phentolamine, and alpha-blocking agent. These results reveal that bovine calf aortic and pulmonary artery endothelial cells are responsive to catecholamines and prostaglandins, and therefore presumably possess both sensitive adenylate cyclases and plasma membrane receptors for these compounds.", 
    "39": "Chronic footshock stress in rats produces a persistent reaction in the sensitivity of the norepinephrine (NE)-cAMP generating system in the cerebral cortex, an effect similar to that reported after chronic antidepressant treatment. The present studies show that footshock-induced subsensitivity is not related to changes in either beta or alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, phosphodiesterase or total adenylate cyclase activity. The stress does not induce a small, selective decrease in binding at high affinity alpha-2 receptor sites but this change does not appear to explain the decreased responsiveness to NE. These data and related findings by others using restraint stress indicate that the mechanism of subsensitivity after chronic stress resembles in part that seen after antidepressants but may also involve additional phenomena which may not occur after the latter agents.", 
    "40": "The role of the autonomic nerves in the development of irreversible cellular injury (ICI) after circumflex coronary occlusion was examined in dogs with intact, acutely, or chronically decentralized cardiac nerves. Cardiac nerves were chronically decentralized 2 wk before ligation (CD) or acutely at the time of ligation (AD). In one group of AD dogs, the beta-blocker oxprenolol (0.3 mg/kg) was administered before ligation (AD + Ox). Hearts were paced at 160 beats/min to exclude any contribution of rate change secondary to autonomic intervention. The results are expressed in terms of percent of the cross-sectional area of the posterior papillary muscle (PPM) sustaining ICI after 40-min occlusion: intact 64 +/- 4% (SE), 6 +/- 4%, AD 39 +/- 10%, and AD + Ox 2 +/- 2%. Both acute and chronic denervation protect against ICI even in the absence of changes in heart rate. Furthermore, in dogs with intact cardiac nerves, reduction in pacing rate from 160 to 60 beats/min also decreased the extent of ICI from 64 +/- 4 to 34 +/- 10%. Experiments defining the time course of development of ICI in the PPM indicate that protection was only temporary, delaying the onset of injury by 25 min. These findings suggest that 1) neural activity in extrinsic cardiac sympathetic nerves activate beta-receptors, thereby influencing the development of ICI, and 2) differences in protection afforded by acute denervation with and without beta-blockade indicated that intrinsic postganglionic sympathetic nerve terminals can liberate transmitter in response to ischemia even in the absence of extrinsic neural activity.", 
    "41": "The influence of alveolar hypoxia on pulmonary vascular adrenergic receptors was studied in conscious newborn lambs. In control animals, pulmonary vessels were directly constricted by epinephrine and norepinephrine, but were unaffected by isoproterenol. Pulmonary resistance (PVR) was also unaffected by propranolol, thus implying minimal beta-receptor activity under normoxic conditions. Hypoxia raised PVR but also modified the pulmonary vascular responses to catecholamines: isoproterenol became a dilator, whereas the constrictor effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine were abolished. Although beta-blockade did not alter base-line PVR, propranolol increased the constrictor response to hypoxia, implying that hypoxia increases beta-adrenergic activity or reactivity in the pulmonary circulation. Consistent with this hypothesis are the following: 1) in alpha-blocked lambs, epinephrine was without local effects during normoxia, but caused vasodilation during hypoxia; 2) the absent constrictor response to epinephrine during hypoxia is fully restored by propranolol; and 3) although alpha-blockade blunts the hypoxic constrictor response, the full response is restored when beta-blockade is added. These results indicate that the hypoxic constrictor response is partially opposed by increased beta-mediated vasodilation. These enhanced beta-receptor effects are due, at least in part, to increased beta-receptor reactivity of unknown mechanism.", 
    "42": "Increases in metabolic rate, heart rate and ventilation occur following carbohydrate feeding or during beta sympathetic stimulation. Furthermore, insulin secretion and hypokalemia are features common to both which raises the question as to whether these effects of carbohydrate depend upon an intact sympathetic nervous system. Accordingly, in the present study, we measured the effects of carbohydrate feeding (250 gram meal) before and after chronic beta sympathetic blockade in sex normal men. Before blockade metabolic rate (O2 consumption) rose (P less than 0.05) from a fasting mean of 248 +/- 19.7 (SEM) ML O2/min to 292 +/- 15.2 at 1 hr. 269 +/- 13.7 at 2, and 262 +/- 18.0 at 3 hr following the meal. During blockade (oral propranolol 80 mg p.o. Q 6 h for 3 days) the post-prandial increase in O2 consumption was also significant (P less than 0.05) and almost identical to that found before blockade. A similar pattern was found for ventilation, heart rate, insulin secretion and hypokalemia, where the significant postprandial changes were not altered by blockade. A transient increase in serum triiodothyronine from a mean of 92 +/- 8.4 microgram/ML to 109 +/- 9.4 occurred at 1 hr (P less than 0.05) only during blockade. No other changes in thyroid hormonal concentrations occurred as a result of the meal. We conclude that although similarities exist between beta sympathetic stimulation and carbohydrate feeding, the post-prandial effects studied do not depend on intact beta sympathetic receptors.", 
    "43": "To investigate the mechanism of receptor changes associated with aging, we developed a beta-adrenergic receptor assay in whole human lymphocytes which fulfills strict affinity, stereospecificity, and specificity criteria. Lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptors were quantified in 54 (36 males and 18 females) healthy subjects on no medications divided into two age groups, 18 to 30 years (mean: 24) and 60 to 72 years (mean: 64). Using this assay, we report no change in the number of lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptors in elderly (mean +/- SE: 801 +/- 114 sites/cell) compared to young individuals (680 +/- 47). When the values are examined separately for males and females there again is no significant difference between younger and older groups. We, therefore, suggest that further investigation is necessary before decreased hormonal responsiveness in the elderly is ascribed to decreased hormone receptor number on the basis of lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "44": "The suppression of collagen production by increasing the cyclic (c) AMP content of cultured cells was examined vis-\u00e0-vis the beta-adrenergic system. Cultured human fetal lung fibroblasts incubated for 6 h with the beta-agonists isoproterenol or epinephrine produced approximately 30% less collagen per cell than in the absence of the hormones. To demonstrate that the beta-agonists were operating by their interaction with the beta-receptor to stimulate adenylate cyclase to increase the intracellular content of cAMP, d- and l-isoproterenol were incubated separately with the cultured cells. Only l-isoproterenol increased intracellular cAMP and decreased collagen production. While 20 nM l-isoproterenol was effective, the d-isomer was ineffective even at 2muM. An increase in cAMP from 40 to 73 pmol/mg protein was effective in suppressing collagen production; increasing the cAMP content to much higher levels had little additional effect on collagen production. 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, an analog of theophylline that inhibits phosphodiesterase, potentiated the effect of isoproterenol in suppressing collagen production. Further support for the concept that isoproterenol suppressed collagen production by acting through the beta-receptor was provided by the finding that only the l-isomer of propranolol, a beta-blocker, was effective in blocking both the increase in intracellular cAMP and the suppression of collagen production caused by isoproterenol. These results demonstrate that collagen production in human fibroblasts can be regulated by the beta-adrenergic system and indicate that when the cAMP content is increased beyond a threshold value, collagen production is suppressed. Since collagen production is sensitive to the small changes of cAMP content of cells brought about by beta-stimulation in cultured cells, the results point to a possibly important mechanism for the regulation of collagen production in the body.", 
    "45": "Left ventricular infarction (AMI) was produced in experimental animals and the contractile response to isoproterenol was tested in the isolated perfused heart preparation. Adenylate cyclase activity, phosphodiesterase activity, and beta-receptor binding characteristics were determined in a sarcolemmal preparation of the right ventricle of the same hearts. Three days post-AMI the dose-response curve for isoproterenol of right ventricular dP/dtmax was significantly depressed, while the inotropic effect of histamine was not impaired. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by isoproterenol was reduced by 70% in the membrane preparation, whereas histamine and NaF stimulation rates were unaltered; phosphodiesterase activity was unchanged. In contrast, beta-receptor binding studies with [3H]-DHA1 indicated 74% loss and 10 times lowered affinity (KD) of the remaining beta-receptors, while specific [3H]-QNB1 binding was unchanged. All of the above alterations were prevented by pretreatment with reserpine or metoprolol. It is concluded that these abnormalities in the nonischemic surviving myocardium post-AMI are the result of specific reversible damage of sarcolemmal beta-receptors due to excessive levels of circulating catecholamines.", 
    "46": "Six patients receiving minoxidil, propranolol, and diuretics had clonidine added in increasing dosage. Five patients received 0.2-0.8 mg/day clonidine and one patient 0.2-0.6 mg. Plasma catecholamines, renin activity, blood pressure, and serum creatinine were measured at each dose level. The patients had a hypernoradrenergic state prior to clonidine [mean +/- SE plasma norepinephrine (PNE), 924 +/- 141 pg/ml]. Administration of clonidine, 0.2-0.8 mg/day, lowered supine PNE (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.02), and clonidine, 0.4-0.8 mg/day, lowered standing PNE (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.02). Maximal suppression of PNE occurred with 0.4 mg/day. Systolic blood pressure correlated with supine PNE (r = 0.055, p less than 0.05) at 0.2-0.8 mg/day clonidine, and standing PNE correlated (r = 0.72, p less than 0.01) at 0.2-0.6 mg/day. Plasma epinephrine concentration, plasma renin activity (PRA), and serum creatinine did not show any significant change. PRA did not correlate with blood pressure changes. Plasma clonidine concentration correlated reciprocally with the change in PNE (r = -0.59, p less than 0.01). These findings indicate that clonidine can return elevated PNE to normal levels in the vasodilator beta-blocker-treated patient and thus remove this abnormality as a contributing factor to pathogenetic mechanisms.", 
    "47": "The sensitivity of the cardiovascular system to isoproterenol following abrupt cessation of propranolol administration was studied in chronically instrumented conscious dogs pretreated orally with propranolol for 14 days. The effects of intravenous isoproterenol on heart rate, blood pressure, and mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (Vcf) were determined before and during propranolol administration and then at 12 hr intervals following drug withdrawal. During propranolol administration, all dose-response curves to isoproterenol were predictably shifted to the right. Twenty-four hours following propranolol withdrawal, when plasma levels of drug averaged only 7 ng/ml, the chronotropic response to isoproterenol remained significantly inhibited. In contrast, the Vcf response recovered rapidly and at 24 hr equaled the pretreatment control response. Furthermore, between 36 and 60 hr, when plasma propranolol levels averaged less than 1 ng/ml, the Vcf dose-response curve to isoproterenol was shifted to the left of control prior to returning to the pretreatment level. This leftward displacement of the Vcf response curve was not accompanied by a parallel change in the heart rate response or in afterload. Plasma norepinephrine levels were measured throughout the study and were not altered during drug treatment or following withdrawal. Thus, the data indicate that abrupt cessation of propranolol administration is associated with a period of increased myocardial sensitivity to at least the inotropic effects of isoproterenol and that abrupt withdrawal does not result in acute changes in sympathetic nervous system activity.", 
    "48": "Sixteen hypertensive patients received pindolol (10-45 mg/day); mean +/- SD, 28.75 +/- 15.22) for 3-8 weeks in a placebo-controlled, single-blind, crossover study. Supine and standing blood pressures (BP) were lowered, whereas effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rates (estimated from the clearances of Hippuran and EDTA during oral water loading) did not change consistently. \"Blood volume\" (calculated from 125I-human serum albumin space and microhaematocrit) increased, with a corresponding reduction in serum albumin but without a change in body weight or \"total body water\" (T2O space). The results suggest a transfer of water from the interstitial to the intravascular compartment. This was supported by estimates of \"extracellular fluid volume\" (EDTA space) and \"interstitial volume\" (EDTA) minus human serum albumin spaces) in 3 subjects. The changes produced in \"blood volume\" correlated with those in BP. Plasma levels of noradrenaline, renin activity, and aldosterone were reduced, as was renal aldosterone excretion. There was no correlation between the changes produced by pindolol in BP and these hormone levels. Pindolol treatment reduced serum calcium concentration. There was a strong positive correlation between changes in BP and serum calcium and renal calcium excretion.", 
    "49": "We examined the role of beta-adrenoceptors in regulating cardiac cell cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in concentrations during beta-receptor activation. Chick embryo cardiac cells in primary tissue culture respond to 50 microM isoprenaline with a rapid, but transient, increase in intracellular cyclic AMP. Continued exposure of these cells to this concentration of isoprenaline results in a rapid time-dependent decrease in maximum beta-receptor responsiveness. In vitro determination of adenylate cyclase and 125I-iodohydroxybenzyl pindolol specific beta-receptor binding sites in 35,000 x g particulate cell fractions and phosphodiesterase activity in cell homogenates suggest that the decrease in the cells' ability to raise intracellular cyclic AMP concentration is mainly due to an initial \"uncoupling\" of the beta-receptor--adenylate cyclase system. During 16 hr exposure of cells to varying isoprenaline concentrations, the magnitude of the cells' ability to increase intracellular cyclic AMP and the concentration of beta-receptor binding sites were inversely related to the isoprenaline concentration to which they had been previously exposed. On removal of isoprenaline, both beta-receptor response and receptor concentration returned slowly towards control levels over the next 24 hr. These results suggest that loss of beta-receptor responsiveness of cardiac cells during prolonged exposure to isoprenaline involves both alterations in receptor number and alterations of the adenylate cyclase system distal to the receptor.", 
    "50": "We studied the hemodynamic effects of the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist prenalterol in healthy subjects before and after intravenous infusion of the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol or the beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocker metoprolol. Intravenous infusions of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg prenalterol induced a dose-dependent decrease in total electromechanical systole and pre-injection period, whereas left ventricular ejection time remained unchanged. Stoke volume as determined by impedance cardiography was not changed, but a dose-dependent increase in cardiac output due to an increase in heart rate was observed. Systolic blood pressure was significantly increased, but diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged. After intravenous administration of either 10 mg propranolol or 20 mg metoprolol, prenalterol was infused in a 10 times higher dose than before. The hemodynamic effects were similar to those observed before the beta-blockers. Whether propranolol or metoprolol was administered did not influence the effects induced by prenalterol. It is suggested that prenalterol might be a useful drug to counteract undesired hemodynamic effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockers.", 
    "51": "The intra-arterial blood pressure of 20 male patients with essential hypertension was continuously recorded during dynamic exercise. Graded exercise testing on a bicycle ergometer and a stair-climbing test were performed prior to and during treatment with oxprenolol. Acute oxprenolol therapy was associated with a reduction in heart rate but little reduction in blood pressure. Chronic treatment for 14.3 weeks with oxprenolol (mean daily dose, 344 mg) was associated with a substantial reduction of blood pressure at rest and at each level of bicycle exercise. A similar antihypertensive effect was demonstrated during stair climbing. The normal blood pressure response to exercise as assessed by the relative (percentage) increase in pressure above the pre-exercise level and the rate of increase in blood pressure (per unit of work), as well as exercise tolerance, were unchanged by chronic beta-blockade with oxprenolol.", 
    "52": "Electrophysiological properties of quinidine and the two isomers of propranolol were compared in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs using His bundle recordings and programmed stimulation in order to differentiate the effects resulting from beta-blockade from those related to nonspecific membrane-stabilizing effects. Quinidine in the plasma concentration range of 2.7-20 microM/liter resulted in concentration-dependent increases in atrionodal and His-Purkinje system conduction times and in the atrial effective refractory period. Quinidine did not produce any significant concentration-dependent change in atrioventricular (AV) nodal and ventricular refractory periods, sinus node automaticity, or QTc interval duration. Propranolol isomers in concentration range of 0.03-0.85 microM/liter produced a concentration-dependent increase in atrionodal conduction time but exerted no significant effect on His-Purkinje conduction time, QTc duration, or ventricular refractory period. Both isomers increased the atrial effective refractory period, but with slopes of concentration-response regression lines which were significantly different from those of quinidine. Only l-propranolol produced concentration-dependent increases in AV nodal refractory period, Wenckebach cycle length, and sinus node recovery time. These results suggest that the electrophysiological effects of propranolol isomers are related to beta-blockade and are significantly different from those resulting from the membrane-stabilizing effect of quinidine.", 
    "53": "The effects of atenolol, a cardioselective beta-blocker, on premature ventricular contractions (PVC) were tested in 68 patients in a double blind trial. 35 patients received 100 mg atenolol p.o/day for 5 days, 33 patients received placebo. A computer-based monitoring system permitted an accurate count of all PVC over a 10-hours pre-drug period and after a 5-days treatment. In both groups there was a significant reduction in PVC frequency, but there was no significant difference between the atenolol group and the placebo group. 45 of 68 patients had a coronary heart disease as cause of PVC, 22 patients in the atenolol group and 23 patients in the placebo group. The statistical examination of those patients only showed results different from the total group. In the atenolol group there was a significant reduction in PVC frequency, average reduction 85% (p less than 0.001). The reduction of PVC frequency inthe atenolol was significantly greater than in the placebo group (p = 0.009). There was a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure and heart rate in the atenolol group, too. Atenolol is an alternative drug in the treatment of PVC in patients with coronary heart disease. The reduction of blood pressure and anginal attacks is an advantage over other conventional antiarrhythmic drugs.", 
    "54": "The role of various bioactive peptides in the control of secretion of hypothalamic somatostatin into the hypophysial portal blood was examined in anesthetized rats. Hypophysial portal blood was withdrawn at a rate of 5.0 microliter/min into a chilled tube through a cannula placed over the stump of the pituitary stalk and segmented every 20 min by air bubbles. Immunoreactive somatostatin (IRS) in the plasma was extracted with acetic acid and acetone and quantified by RIA. Basal levels (mean +/- SE) of plasma IRS in the hypophysial portal blood were 646 +/- 36 and 317 +/- 44 pg/ml in urethane- and pentobarbital-anesthetized rats, respectively. Under urethane anesthesia, injection of synthetic neurotensin into the lateral ventricle at various doses in the range of 0.016--2 microgram/rat caused a significant and dose-related increase of plasma IRS levels in the hypophysial portal blood, and this effect of neurotensin was significantly (P less than 0.05) suppressed by pretreatment with diphenhydramine (1 mg/100 g BW, iv), a histamine receptor blocker. Enhancement of IRS release by neurotensin was also observed in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. Intraventricular injection of substance P (10 microgram/rat), beta-endorphin (1 and 5 microgram/rat), or [Met5]enkephalin had no effect on the level of somatostatin in the hypophysial portal blood of urethane-anesthetized rats. These results suggest a release of hypothalamic somatostatin into the hypophysial portal blood in response to intraventricular administration of neurotensin, probably by a histaminergic mechanism.", 
    "55": "Electrocardiographic abnormalities occur in approximately 50% of patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. The changes can resemble those of myocardial damage, although in most cases post-mortem studies show no macroscopic evidence of injury. Failure to appreciate this can lead to misdiagnosis of organic cardiac disease, cause delay in surgical treatment or even lead to inappropriate therapy. This review deals with the changes that may occur in the electrocardiogram, discusses the explanations put forward, and examines how this may influence future trends in management."
