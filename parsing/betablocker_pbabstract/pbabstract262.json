Basal phosphorylation levels of cTnI were lower in TG than in wild-type (WT) mice, but phosphorylation of cardiac troponin T was increased. Compared with WT, TG fiber bundles showed a 13% decrease in maximum tension and a 20% increase in maximum MgATPase activity, yielding an increase in tension cost. Protein kinase C (PKC) activation with endothelin (ET) or phenylephrine plus propranolol (PP) before detergent extraction induced a decrease in maximum tension and MgATPase activity in WT fibers, whereas ET or PP increased maximum tension and stiffness in TG fibers. TG MgATPase activity was unchanged by ET but increased by PP. Measurement of protein phosphorylation revealed differential effects of agonists between WT and TG myofilaments and within the TG myofilaments. Our results demonstrate the importance of PKC-mediated phosphorylation of cTnI S43/S45 in the control of myofilament activation and cross-bridge cycling rate.", 
    "1": "A simple kinetic procedure is described for the determination of atenolol in its dosage forms. The procedure is based on coupling the drug with 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole in pH 8 borate buffer at the boiling temperature for a fixed time of 30 min, and then measuring the absorbance of the reaction product at 460 nm. The absorbance-concentration plot is rectilinear over the range 5-50 microg/mL with a minimum detection limit of 1.3 microg (4.9 x 10(-6) M). The determination of atenolol by the fixed-concentration and rate-constant methods is also feasible with the calibration equations obtained, but the fixed-time method proved to be more applicable. The procedure was applied successfully to commercial tablets, and statistical analysis showed that the results compared favorably with those obtained by the official methods. The interference likely to be introduced from some coformulated drugs and the effect of sensitizers and surfactants on the performance of the proposed method were also studied. A proposed reaction pathway is presented.",

Hypertension treatment must be considered as a secondary prevention approach with a blood pressure normalisation as a target.

Four weeks after infarction, in conscious state, baroreflex sensitivity was assessed from the bradycardic responses to graded phenylephrine-induced elevations in blood pressure (BP). Left ventricular (LV) diameter was assessed by echocardiography, and plasma catecholamines were assayed to estimate sympathetic activity. Lungs were eventually excised and weighed (LW).

Fifty plaque ruptures (mean, 2.08 per patient; range, 0 to 6) were diagnosed by the association of a ruptured capsule with intraplaque cavity. Plaque rupture on the culprit lesion was found in 9 patients (37.5%). At least 1 plaque rupture was found somewhere other than on the culprit lesion in 19 patients (79%). These lesions were in a different artery than the culprit artery in 70.8% and were in both other arteries in 12.5% of these 24 patients. Complete IVUS examination of all 3 coronary axes in patients who had experienced a first ACS revealed that multiple atherosclerotic plaque ruptures were detected by IVUS; these multiple ruptures were present simultaneously with the culprit lesion; they were frequent and located (in three quarters of cases) on the 3 principal coronary trunks; and the multiple plaque ruptures in locations other than on the culprit lesion were less severe, nonstenosing, and less calcified.",

    "17": "The behaviour of water in hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) K100LV, K4M, K15M, K100M, E4M, F4M and HPC polymers was characterised using low frequency dielectric spectroscopy (LFDS). Dielectric responses of 25% (w/w) HPMC K15M gels and deionised water were found to be similar at +22 and 0 degrees C. However, at -30 degrees C, a dielectric response typical of a solid was apparent. The melting of frozen water within gels was detected as increases in the magnitude of the dielectric response with increase in temperature. More than one phase transition was visible in the majority of gels studied which may be related to the presence of different states of water melting at different temperatures. In addition to polymer concentration, both polymer molecular weight and substitution level influenced the nature of the transitions. The magnitude of the dielectric response was increased in all HPMC gel systems in comparison to the response seen in deionised water. Drug addition affected the transitions occurring during the melting of ice in the gels. This may be related to the presence of ionic species in the systems. LFDS studies on cellulose ether gels have provided some interesting evidence for the existence of more than one state of water within such gel systems. The results are in good agreement with thermal analysis findings in similar gel systems.", 
    "18": "Human variability in the kinetics of CYP2D6 substrates has been quantified using a database of compounds metabolised extensively (>60%) by this polymorphic enzyme. Published pharmacokinetic studies (after oral and intravenous dosing) in non-phenotyped healthy adults, and phenotyped extensive (EMs), intermediate or slow-extensive (SEMs) and poor metabolisers (PMs) have been analysed using data for parameters that relate primarily to chronic exposure (metabolic and total clearances, area under the plasma concentration time-curve) and primarily to acute exposure (peak concentration). Similar analyses were performed with the available data for subgroups of the population (age, ethnicity and disease). Interindividual differences in kinetics for markers of oral exposure were large for non-phenotyped individuals and for EMs (coefficients of variation were 67-71% for clearances and 54-63% for C(max)), whereas the intravenous data indicated a lower variability (34-38%). Comparisons between EMs, SEMs and PMs revealed an increase in oral internal dose for SEMs and PMs (ratio compared to EMs=3 and 9-12, respectively) associated with lower variability than that for non-phenotyped individuals (coefficients of variation were 32-38% and 30% for SEMs and PMs, respectively). In relation to the uncertainty factors used for risk assessment, most subgroups would not be covered by the kinetic default of 3.16. CYP2D6-related factors necessary to cover 95-99% of each subpopulation ranged from 2.7 to 4.1 in non-phenotyped healthy adults and EMs to 15-18 in PMs and 22-45 in children. An exponential relationship (R(2)=0.8) was found between the extent of CYP2D6 metabolism and the uncertainty factors. The extent of CYP2D6 involvement in the metabolism of a substrate is critical in the estimation of the CYP2D6-related factor. The 3.16 kinetic default factor would cover PMs for substrates for which CYP2D6 was responsible for up to 25% of the metabolism in EMs.", 
    "19": "Chronic sympathetic denervation entails subsensitivity to alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists and supersensitivity to kappa- and mu-opioid receptor agonists modulating cholinergic neurons in the guinea pig colon. A possible role for signal transduction G proteins in contributing to development of these sensitivity changes was investigated. Pertussis toxin (PTX), a blocker of the G(i/o)-type family of G proteins significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of UK14,304 (alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist), U69593 (kappa-opioid receptor agonist) and DAMGO (mu-opioid receptor agonist) on acetylcholine (ACh) overflow in preparations obtained from normal animals, but not in those obtained from sympathetically denervated animals. In this experimental condition, immunoblot analysis revealed reduced levels of G(alphao), G(alphai2), G(alphai3) and G(beta) in myenteric plexus synaptosomes. On reverse, synaptosomal levels of G(alphai1) and G(alphaz), a PTX-insensitive G-protein, increased after chronic ablation of the sympathetic pathways. These data suggest that changes in the function and expression of inhibitory G proteins coupled to alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, kappa- and mu-opioid receptors occur in the myenteric plexus of the guinea pig colon after chronic sympathetic denervation. The possibility that regulation of G proteins represents one of the biochemical mechanisms at the basis of the changes in sensitivity of enteric cholinergic neurons to alpha(2)-adrenoceptor, kappa- and mu-opioid receptor agonists is discussed.", 
    "20": "A novel pharmacogel was developed for the enhanced transdermal delivery of propranolol hydrochloride (PH). The synthesized prodrugs, propranolol palmitate hydrochloride (PPH) and propranolol stearate hydrochloride (PSH) self-assembled to form gel simply upon mixing alcoholic solution of prodrug with an aqueous solution in a specified ratio. By varying the ratio of prodrug, alcohol and water, three-component phase diagram was constructed which revealed isotropic-gel-vesicular dispersion regions, respectively concomitant to increasing the ratio of water. The gel phase is termed 'Pharmacogel' and exhibits birefringence under plane-polarized light corroborating the presence of lamellar liquid crystals. The pharmacogel by virtue of high chemical potential gradient and improved physicochemical properties showed the enhanced in-vitro skin permeation flux of 51.5+/-3.7 and 42.5+/-3.1 microg/cm(2)/h from PPH and PSH gel, respectively, as compared to 1.9+/-0.1 microg/cm(2)/h for control; and decrease in lag time (1.8 and 2.8 h for PPH and PSH gel, respectively) compared to control (7.6 h) was observed. The admixing of egg lecithin (EL) in increasing ratio concomitantly decreased the flux values to 31.7+/-2.1 microg/cm(2)/h (at a mole ratio of 50:50 PPH:EL) and increased the lag time. In the gel containing 50% EL, the addition of span 40 and cholesterol slightly reduced the permeation while sodium deoxycholate and Tween-80 improved it. The plasma drug levels following transdermal application of control were low (C(max)=23 ng/ml) while in PPH gel, it increased with time reaching C(max) of 94 ng/ml at 8 h post-application of PPH gel (C(max) of 75 ng/ml at 12 h post application of PL5 gel) and maintained for longer times. The AUC(0-32 h) for PPH gel was much higher (1968 ng h/ml) than control (AUC(0-18 h) was 239 ng h/ml), while EL mixed gel also showed better absorption (AUC(0-32 h) was 1707 ng h/ml). The gel formulations also caused less irritation than control, while mixed gel showed least irritation. This novel self-assembled pharmacogel providing high transdermal permeation with many variables to regulate the delivery is therefore having a great potential in percutaneous delivery.",

    "25": "As the mechanisms underlying the structural changes induced in rat submandibular glands by Tityus serrulatus tityustoxin have not been reported, the present study was undertaken to investigate the participation of adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in these alterations. Most of the stimulatory effects of the toxin are observed in the secretory cells of the acini and granular convoluted tubules (GCT). We evaluated the ability of the toxin to induce morphological changes in acinar and GCT cells after adrenoreceptor and cholino receptor blockage. The influence of tityustoxin-induced adrenal discharge on the acinar and GCT cells was also investigated after bilateral adrenalectomy. We show that the intense cytoplasmic vacuolation of the acinar cells induced by tityustoxin was prevented by prazosin (alpha(1) adenoreceptor blockade) and atropine (muscarinic cholinoreceptor blockade). The decrease of GCT cell granules following tityustoxin injection was completely blocked by prasozin and partially by propranolol. These results indicate that acinar vacuolation, degranulation of GCT cells, reduction of GCT diameter and height of its epithelium depends on tityustoxin induced adrenergic and cholinergic mechanisms. In contrast, tityustoxin induced acinar cell degranulation was not modified by atropine, prasozin or propranolol (beta(1)-beta(2) adenoreceptor blockade). Thus, acinar degranulation seems to be due to a direct action of tityustoxin on of the rat submandibular glands. The degranulation of the GCT cells and the acinar vacuolation was also prevented by bilateral adrenalectomy, suggesting that these effects are mostly due to catecholamines released from the adrenal glands.",

Use of atenolol in the second trimester of pregnancy did not produce the same effect and was not materially different in its effects from the other anti-hypertensive drugs. In the second trimester, the development of superimposed pre-eclampsia is the over-riding effect in the reduction of infant birth weight.

Data for 62% of patients not taking beta-blockers were described by the Emax (maximum heart rate response to dobutamine) model, whereas data for only 39% of patients taking beta-blockers were best described by this model (p = 0.01). Patients taking beta-blockers also had a smaller mean increment in left ventricular ejection fraction (10.8% +/- 4.2% vs 14.1% +/- 9.3%, p < 0.01), a trend toward a higher ED50 (dobutamine dosage rate causing half the maximum heart-rate response; median 16.8 microg/kg/min, p = 0.12) and a lower sigmoidicity factor determining the shape of the curve (median 2.1, p = 0.03).",

The new guidelines from the American College of Cardiology-American Heart Association recommend use of beta-blockers in all patients with symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Now clinicians need to incorporate use of beta-blockers into their standard approach to the treatment of heart failure.

    "45": "Intraperitoneal injection of choline (40, 80 or 120 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent increase in serum glucose and choline levels in rats. The increases in serum glucose and choline were associated with an increase of serum insulin as well as plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine. The increases in serum glucose and plasma catecholamine concentrations induced by choline (120 mg/kg) were blocked by pretreatment with the ganglionic nicotinic receptor antagonist hexamethonium (15 mg/kg), but were not affected by pretreatment with atropine (5 mg/kg). The choline-induced rise in serum insulin was blocked by pretreatment with atropine and with hexamethonium each. The increase in serum glucose evoked by choline (120 mg/kg) was blocked by alpha-adrenoceptor blockade and bilateral adrenalectomy each. Blockade of beta-adrenoceptor by propranolol or chemical sympathectomy by 6-hydroxydopamine failed to alter the hyperglycemic response to choline. These results show that choline, a precursor of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, increases serum glucose and insulin levels. The effect of choline on serum insulin is mediated by both muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, whereas the effect of choline on serum glucose is mediated solely by nicotinic receptors. The stimulation of adrenal medullary catecholamine release and subsequent activation of alpha-adrenoceptors apparently mediates the hyperglycemic effect of choline.", 
    "46": "The effect of calcium ions (Ca(2+)) and calmodulin (CaM) on the excystation and metacystic development of Entamoeba invadens was examined by transfer of cysts to a growth medium containing calcium antagonists and CaM inhibitors. Excystation, which was assessed by counting the number of metacystic amoebae after induction of excystation, was inhibited by the calcium chelators ethyleneglycol bis (beta-aminoethyl ether)- N,N'-tetraacetate (EGTA) and ethylene-diaminetetraacetate (EDTA), with EDTA being more potent than EGTA. The inhibitory effect of higher concentrations of these chelators on excystation was associated with reduced viability of cysts. Metacystic development, when determined by the number of nuclei in an amoeba, was delayed by EGTA, because the percentage of four-nucleate amoebae was higher than in controls at day 3 of incubation. EDTA made metacystic development unusual by producing a large number of metacystic amoebae with more than ten nuclei. The inhibition of excystation by these chelators was partially abrogated by their removal. A putative antagonist of intracellular calcium flux, 8-( N,N-diethylamino) octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB-8) also inhibited the excystation and metacystic development, but had little effect on cyst viability. The slow Na(+)-Ca(2+) channel blocker bepridil but not verapamil inhibited the excystation and metacystic development, associating with reduced cyst viability at higher concentrations. The inhibitory effect of bepridil on excystation was abrogated by removal of the drug. The CaM inhibitor trifIuoperazine (TFP) but not W-7 [ N-(6-aminohexyl)-chloro-1-naphtalene sulphonamide] inhibited the excystation and metacystic development. The inhibitory effect of TFP on excystation was also abrogated by removal of the drug.

    "47": "We examined the inhibitory mechanism of BRL37344, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist that is considered to be specific to beta(3)-subtype, on muscarinic receptor-mediated contraction of the rat urinary bladder smooth muscle. BRL37344 produced apparently biphasic concentration-relaxation curves in the urinary bladder smooth muscle contracted with carbachol (0.6 microM). The first and second phases had estimated p D(2) (-logEC(50)) values of 7.80+/-0.34 and 4.62+/-0.18, respectively ( n=6). The first component of the BRL37344 concentration-response curve was not affected by propranolol (1 microM), whereas it was inhibited by higher concentrations of the drug (10 microM or 30 microM). The second component was completely resistant to propranolol. On the other hand, BRL37344 produced monophasic concentration-relaxation of 30 mM KCl-precontracted urinary bladder smooth muscle with a p D(2) value of 8.34+/-0.18 ( n=6). Pretreatment of the urinary bladder smooth muscles with BRL37344 (30, 100 and 300 microM) significantly ( P<0.05) shifted the concentration-response curves for carbachol-induced contractions. In radioligand binding experiments, BRL37344 concentration-dependently displaced the specific binding of [(3)H] N-methyl scopolamine to muscarinic receptors on rat urinary bladder smooth muscle membranes. Additionally, BRL37344 inhibited [(3)H] N-methyl scopolamine binding to cloned human muscarinic receptors (M(1)-M(5)) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. These results suggest that BRL37344 attenuates muscarinic receptor-mediated contractions through prevention of the agonists binding to their receptors, in addition to stimulation of beta(3)-adrenoceptors, in rat urinary bladder.",

    "58": "The beta1 selective beta-blocker metoprolol is metabolized predominantly but not exclusively by CYP2D6. Due to the polymorphism of the CYP2D6 gene, CYP2D6 activity varies markedly between individuals. Consequently, after short-term administration metoprolol plasma concentrations were found to be several fold higher in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers. However, it is currently not known, whether the impact of the CYP2D6 polymorphism persists during long-term therapy, since alternate mechanisms of elimination or metabolism could be effective in this setting. The study comprised 91 Caucasian patients on long-term treatment with metoprolol (median duration of treatment 12.6 months; median daily drug dose: 47.5 mg/day). Metoprolol and alpha-OH-metoprolol plasma concentrations were assessed by HPLC. Genotyping detected the null alleles (*0): *3, *4, *5, *6, *7, *8, *12, *14, *15, the alleles *9, *10 and *41 associated with reduced enzymatic activity as well as the fully functional alleles *1 and *2. Genotype and allele frequencies were in accordance with published frequencies for the German population. The plasma metabolic ratio of metoprolol/alpha-OH-metoprolol was markedly affected by the genotype (P < 0.0001). In accordance, median adjusted metoprolol plasma concentrations were 6.2- and 3.9-fold higher in patients with *0/*0 genotypes (n = 8) and intermediate genotypes (n = 10), respectively, as compared to those with two fully functional alleles (n = 31; P < 0.01).

The heart/mediastinum count (H/M) ratio and total defect score (TDS) were determined for 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine images from anterior planar image and single-photon emission CT images. LVEF and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVDd) were determined by echocardiography. After 1 year of treatment, the echocardiographic LVEF improved > 5% in 11 patients (group A), but did not improve in the remaining 11 patients (group B). Before treatment, TDS, H/M, LVEF, and LVDd were similar in both groups. However, there was a greater increase in the LVEF during dobutamine infusion in group A than in group B (21 +/- 8% vs 9 +/- 3%, p < 0.001). If a critical value of 15% for the DeltaLVEF was used to predict the improvement in LVEF after treatment, the sensitivity was 91% and specificity was 82%.

Incorporation of lipophilic cation-exchanger tetrakis(p-chlorophenyl)borate (TCPB) alone or in combination with trioctylated alpha-cyclodextrin into the polymeric liquid membrane gives very sensitive responses for racemic forms of bufuralol, propranolol, carazolol, clenbuterol, mabuterol, cimaterol, bisoprolol, oxprenolol, alprenolol, tertatolol, and bevantolol, especially in the cation-exchange HPLC system applying acetonitrile -- 40 mM phosphoric acid (15: 85, v/v, pH* = 2.35) as the mobile phase. In both applied orthogonal HPLC modes we observed that use of TCPB containing electrodes (no addition of neutral macrocyclic ionophores) gives more than five fold improvement in limit of detection down to 10(-7) M for mabuterol, bufuralol, alprenolol and tertatolol in comparison with UV detection. These results suggest that potentiometric detection, especially in RP-HPLC employing hybrid polymer-silica packings, can be considered as the promising alternative in the high-throughput drug abuse or doping control procedures of investigated beta-adrenergic agonists and beta-adrenolytics in humans and animals. The quantitative structure - potentiometric response relationships were developed for a set of eighteen beta-adrenenergic drugs and a set of PVC based electrodes using TCPB alone or in admixture with trioctylated alpha-cyclodextrin, dibenzo-18-crown-6 or calix[6]arene hexaethylacetate ester. A multiple linear regression model based on computationally derived set of molecular descriptors was used to predict detection limits of beta-blocking agents and beta-adrenergic agonists from their molecular structure in the developed potentiometric detectors. Principal components analysis (PCA) of data considering determined potentiometric detection limits revealed that it can be used to establish a reliable pharmacological classification of compounds with beta-adrenoceptor activity, especially for the differentiation of cardioselective and non-cardioselective beta1-antagonists.", 
    "63": "Management of heart failure is estimated to consume 1% to 2% of total healthcare resources and recent data from the UK suggests this may be as high as 4% with hospital admissions accounting for approximately 70% of this expenditure. The safety and efficacy of b-blockers when added to standard therapy i.e. ACE inhibitors in chronic heart failure has recently been demonstrated in large placebo controlled trials. The ability of b-blockers to reduce hospital admission rates would be expected to prove cost effective. In this study the cost effectiveness of the b-blocker carvedilol when added to standard therapy in patients with severe heart failure was determined. Using economic modelling techniques and Irish cost data the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) for carvedilol therapy was 1,560 Euro per life year gained (LYG). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated an ICER range of 1,560 Euro/LYG to 7,322 Euro/LYG under a variety of assumptions. This suggests that carvedilol therapy for patients with severe chronic heart failure is not only safe and effective but is highly cost effective in the Irish healthcare setting.",

Patients receiving any prescriptions for a nitrate during a one year period (September 1999-August 2000) were considered using a national primary care prescribing database. Age-sex standardised prescribing rates of four secondary preventative therapies for IHD (Ace inhibitors, beta-blockers, aspirin, statins) were calculated for each region. Wide variations between regions were observed with significantly higher variability for Ace inhibitors compared with aspirin (F-ratio=22.8, p<0.001). Men were more likely to prescribed these therapies and the elderly were less likely (except Ace inhibitors). The study suggests that access to secondary preventative therapy is not equitable across regions, gender and age in Ireland. The wide variability may be due to uncertainty in prescribing secondary preventative therapies and/or variability in clinical need between regions.",

Mice expressing alphaTm in the heart were developed to determine the effects of FHC mutant Tm on cardiac structure and function from single cardiac myocytes to whole organ function in vivo. Expression of E180G mutant Tm did not produce cardiac hypertrophy or detectable changes in cardiac muscle morphology. However, E180G mutant Tm expression increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of force production in single cardiac myocytes in a transgene expression-dependent manner. Contractile dysfunction in single myocytes manifested organ level dysfunction, as conductance-micromanometry showed E180G Tm mice had significantly slowed relaxation (diastolic dysfunction) under physiological conditions. The diastolic dysfunction in E180G Tm mice was no longer evident during beta-blockade because propranolol eliminated the effect of E180G Tm to slow myocardial relaxation. Cellular and organ level dysfunction were evident in E180G Tm mice in the absence of significant cardiac structural abnormalities normally associated with FHC. These findings therefore suggest that diastolic dysfunction in FHC may be a direct consequence of FHC mutant protein expression. In addition, because diastolic dysfunction in E180G Tm mice is dependent on inotropic status, cardiovascular stress may play an important role in FHC pathogenesis.",

Clinical trial data involving patients after myocardial infarction or with congestive heart failure demonstrate that a reduction in sudden death accounts for much of the observed mortality reduction. Beta-adrenergic blockade inhibits the proarrhythmic effects of both neural and humoral sympathetic stimulation and inhibits the vagal withdrawal that accompanies ischemia. Although it does not have a dramatic effect on spontaneous ectopy or inducible monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, experimental and clinical data suggest that it inhibits the development of ventricular fibrillation by several mechanisms.",

Catecholamines have been shown to modulate the activity of various immune effector cells directly via membrane adrenergic receptors. Here, we investigated immediate effects of norepinephrine on energy metabolism of immune cells. Norepinephrine inhibits oxygen consumption of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells at concentrations that are relevant to its physiological range. The beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol, but not the alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist phentolamine reversed the norepinephrine induced inhibition in quiescent cells. Conversely, phentolamine but not propranolol is capable of blocking norepinephrine mediated effects in mitogen activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our data indicate that the sensitization of alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors on immune cells is differentially regulated, and that these processes depend on the activation state of these cells. These findings have important implications for the understanding of stress-induced suppression of immune function and may contribute to the elucidation of the pathogenesis of immunologically mediated diseases.",

    "89": "In many rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors, agonist binding to a cluster of aromatic residues in TM6 may promote receptor activation by altering the configuration of the TM6 Pro-kink and by the subsequent movement of the cytoplasmic end of TM6 away from TM3. We hypothesized that the highly conserved Cys(6.47), in the vicinity of the conserved Pro(6.50), modulates the configuration of the aromatic cluster and the TM6 Pro-kink through specific interactions in its different rotamer configurations. In the beta(2) adrenergic receptor, mutation of Cys(6.47) to Thr, which in an alpha-helix has a different rotamer distribution from Cys and Ser, produced a constitutively active receptor, whereas the Ser mutant was similar to wild-type receptor. Use of the biased Monte Carlo technique of Conformational Memories showed that the rotamer changes among Cys/Ser/Thr(6.47), Trp(6.48), and Phe(6.52) are highly correlated, representing a rotamer \"toggle switch\" that may modulate the TM6 Pro-kink. Differential modulation of the accessibility of Cys(6.47) and an engineered Cys(6.52) in wild type and a constitutively active background provides experimental support for the association of this rotamer switch with receptor activation.", 
    "90": "Nucleotide binding to purinergic P2 receptors contributes to the regulation of a variety of physiological functions in renal epithelial cells. Whereas P2 receptors have been functionally identified at the basolateral membrane of the cortical collecting duct (CCD), a final regulatory site of urinary Na(+), K(+), and acid-base excretion, controversy exists as to whether apical purinoceptors exist in this segment. Nor has the distribution of receptor subtypes present on the unique cell populations that constitute Ca(2+) the CCD been established. To examine this, we measured nucleotide-induced changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in fura 2-loaded rabbit CCDs microperfused in vitro. Resting [Ca(2+)](i) did not differ between principal and intercalated cells, averaging approximately 120 nM. An acute increase in tubular fluid flow rate, associated with a 20% increase in tubular diameter, led to increases in [Ca(2+)](i) in both cell types. Luminal perfusion of 100 microM UTP or ATP-gamma-S, in the absence of change in flow rate, caused a rapid and transient approximately fourfold increase in [Ca(2+)](i) in both cell types (P < 0.05). Luminal suramin, a nonspecific P2 receptor antagonist, blocked the nucleotide- but not flow-induced [Ca(2+)](i) transients. Luminal perfusion with a P2X (alpha,beta-methylene-ATP), P2X(7) (benzoyl-benzoyl-ATP), P2Y(1) (2-methylthio-ATP), or P2Y(4)/P2Y(6) (UDP) receptor agonist had no effect on [Ca(2+)](i). The nucleotide-induced [Ca(2+)](i) transients were inhibited by the inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor blocker 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, thapsigargin, which depletes internal Ca(2+) stores, luminal perfusion with a Ca(2+)-free perfusate, or the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker nifedipine. These results suggest that luminal nucleotides activate apical P2Y(2) receptors in the CCD via pathways that require both internal Ca(2+) mobilization and extracellular Ca(2+) entry. The flow-induced rise in [Ca(2+)](i) is apparently not mediated by apical P2 purinergic receptor signaling.", 
    "91": "In rats, six cytochrome P450 (P450) 2D isoforms have been genetically identified. Nonetheless, there is little evidence of catalytic properties of each CYP2D isoform. In this study, using recombinant CYP2D isoforms (rat CYP2D1, CYP2D2, CYP2D3, and CYP2D4 and human CYP2D6) or hepatic microsomes, we investigated the catalytic specificity toward bufuralol, debrisoquine, and propranolol, which are frequently used as CYP2D substrates. Bufuralol was oxidized to three metabolites by rat and human hepatic microsomes. 1'-Hydroxybufuralol was the major metabolite. 1'2'-Ethenylbufuralol, one of the others, was identified as a novel metabolite. The formation of 1'-hydroxybufuralol and 1'2'-ethenylbufuralol in hepatic microsomes was inhibited by anti-CYP2D antibody, suggesting that these metabolites were formed by CYP2D isoforms. All rat and human recombinant CYP2D isoforms possessed activity for the 1'-hydroxylation of bufuralol, indicating that this catalytic property was common to all CYP2D isoforms. However, the 1'2'-ethenylation of bufuralol was catalyzed only by rat CYP2D4 and human CYP2D6. Debrisoquine was oxidized to two metabolites, 3-hydroxydebrisoquine, and 4-hydroxydebrisoquine, by hepatic microsomes. Recombinant CYP2D2 and CYP2D6 had very high levels of activity for the 4-hydroxylation of debrisoquine with low K(m) values. Only CYP2D1 had a higher level of 3-hydroxylation than 4-hydroxylation activity. Propranolol 4-hydroxylation was catalyzed by CYP2D2, CYP2D4, and CYP2D6. The 7-hydroxylation of propranolol was catalyzed only by CYP2D2. In conclusion, in rats, bufuralol 1'2'-ethenylation activity was specific to CYP2D4 and debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation and propranolol 7-hydroxylation activities were specific to CYP2D2. These catalytic activities are useful as a probe for rat CYP2D isoforms.",

In the CAPRICORN trial, patients were selected on the basis of a left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) <40% following the index MI and randomised to carvedilol or placebo, in addition to modern secondary prophylaxis with ACE inhibitors, aspirin and statins. In 1959 patients with a mean LVEF of 33%, treatment with carvedilol over a mean follow-up period of 15 months reduced total mortality from 15.3% with placebo to 11.9% with carvedilol [relative risk reduction (RRR) =23%, absolute risk reduction (ARR) =3.4%]. The incidence of recurrent MI was reduced from 5.8 to 2.3% (RRR 41%, ARR 2.3%). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one death was 28 for the entire study period and 43 for 1 year of treatment. The results of the CAPRICORN trial are compared with three previous beta-blocker post-MI trials: the Gothenburg metoprolol trial (GMT), the Norwegian timolol trial (NTT) and the beta-blocker heart attack trial (BHAT). The RRRs for total mortality were 36% in the GMT and NTT, and 27% in BHAT. The respective NNTs for total mortality were 32, 18 and 38. NNT for 1 year of treatment was 25 in NTT and 80 in BHAT.

In this study we have investigated the effect of (+/-)-pindolol on both pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors using in vivo microdialysis and hippocampal slice preparations. (+/-)-pindolol and flesinoxan, a 5-HT1A receptor full agonist, significantly decreased the extracellular levels of 5-HT in the raphe and prefrontal cortex. The 5-HT and other 5-HT1A receptor agonists, flesinoxan and 8-hydroxy-2- (di-n-propylamino)tetralon (8-OH-DPAT), significantly decreased the population excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in the CA3-CA1 excitatory synapse in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of 5-HT and other 5-HT1A receptor agonists accompanied the increase in paired-pulse facilitation (ppf) induced by short-interval two stimuli and were reversed by the coadministration of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, NAN-190, but not by (+/-)-pindolol. (+/-)-pindolol also suppressed the EPSP, but this effect was not reversed by NAN-190. These results suggest that (+/-)-pindolol acts as a partial agonist to the somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptor in the raphe, whereas it may have no action on the postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor in the hippocampus.", 
    "107": "Disruption of Ca(2+) homeostasis is hypothesized to mediate several electrophysiological markers of brain aging. Recent evidence indicates that estradiol can rapidly alter Ca(2+)-dependent processes in neurons through nongenomic mechanisms. In the current study, electrophysiological effects of 17beta-estradiol benzoate (EB) on the Ca(2+)-activated afterhyperpolarization (AHP) were investigated using intracellular sharp electrode recording in hippocampal slices from ovariectomized Fischer 344 female rats. The AHP amplitude was enhanced in aged (22-24 mo) compared with young (5-8 mo) rats and direct application of EB (100 pM) reduced the AHP in aged rats. The age-related difference was due, in part, to the increased AHP amplitude of aged animals, since an EB-mediated decrease in the AHP could be observed in young rats when the extracellular Ca(2+) was elevated to increase the AHP amplitude. In aged rats, bath application of EB occluded the ability of the L-channel blocker, nifedipine (10 microM), to attenuate the AHP. The results support a role for EB in modifying hippocampal Ca(2+)-dependent processes in a manner diametrically opposite that observed during aging, possibly through L-channel inhibition.", 
    "108": "Serotonergic modulation of precerebellar nuclei may be crucial for the function of the entire cerebellar system. To study the effects of serotonin (5-HT) on neurons located within the pontine nuclei (PN), the main source of cerebellar mossy fibers, we performed standard intracellular recordings from PN neurons in a slice preparation of the rat pontine brain stem. Application of 5 microM 5-HT significantly altered several intrinsic membrane properties of PN neurons. First, it depolarized the somatic membrane potential by 6.5 +/- 3.5 mV and increased the apparent input resistance from 49.5 +/- 14.6 to 62.7 +/- 21.1 MOmega. Second, 5-HT altered the I-V relationship of PN neurons: it decreased the inward rectification in hyperpolarizing direction, but increased it when depolarizing currents were applied. Third, it decreased the rheobase from 0.32 +/- 0.14 to 0.24 +/- 0.14 nA without affecting the firing threshold. Finally, the amplitude of medium-duration after hyperpolarizations was reduced from -14.9 +/- 2.0 to -12.3 +/- 2.4 mV. Together, these 5-HT effects on the intrinsic membrane properties result in an increase in excitability and instantaneous firing rate. In addition, application of 5 microM 5-HT also modulated postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) evoked by electric stimulations within the cerebral peduncle. The amplitude, maximal slope, and integral of these PSPs were reduced to 46.2 +/- 23.4%, 45.7 +/- 23.7%, and 61.4 +/- 28.4% of the control value, respectively. In contrast, we found no change in the decay and voltage dependence of PSPs. To test modulatory effects on short-term synaptic facilitation, we applied pairs of electrical stimuli at intervals between 10 and 1,000 ms. 5-HT selectively enhanced the paired-pulse facilitation for interstimulus-intervals >20 ms. The alteration of paired-pulse facilitation points to a presynaptic site of action for 5-HT effects on synaptic transmission. Pharmacological experiments suggested that pre- and postsynaptic effects of 5-HT were mediated by two different kinds of 5-HT receptors: changes in intrinsic membrane properties were blocked by the 5-HT(2) receptor antagonist cinanserin while the reduction of PSPs was prevented by the 5-HT(1) receptor antagonist cyanopindolol. In conclusion, 5-HT increases the excitability of PN neurons but decreases the synaptic transmission on them. The selective enhancement of synaptic facilitation may, however, allow high-frequency inputs to effectively drive PN neurons, thus the PN may act as a high-pass filter during periods of 5-HT release.", 
    "109": "The use of beta-blocking agents in adults with congestive heart failure has been shown to improve symptoms and outcome; however, experience in pediatric patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction is limited. We identified 12 pediatric patients treated with beta-blocking agents for left ventricular systolic dysfunction and reviewed echocardiographic indices of left ventricular systolic performance prior to initiation of beta-blocker therapy and at intermediate follow-up. Left ventricular fractional shortening and ejection fraction increased significantly from baseline to intermediate follow-up (13 +/- 4% to 21 +/- 8% [p = 0.01] and 26 +/- 8% to 41 +/- 17% [p = 0.04], respectively). When added to conventional therapy, beta-blocker therapy resulted in an increase in ejection-phase indices of left ventricular systolic performance at intermediate follow-up in pediatric patients with systolic dysfunction.",

    "111": "The diameter of one pre-selected retinal arteriole per eye was measured using the Retinal Vessel Analyser (RVA), an instrument developed for non-invasive clinical measurement of the diameter of the main retinal vessels. The instrument contains a video system, and the integrated software recognises the boundaries of the retinal vessels by detecting their light-transmission profile. The vessel diameter (in arbitrary units) is plotted against time (seconds) on a separate display screen. In Study I the vessel diameter was measured in 12 eyes of six healthy volunteers (age 21-26 years, mean age 24.0 years) on six occasions each separated by 14 days. In a double-masked fashion, each subject's right eye was treated with one of 5 glaucoma medications (brinzolamide 1%, timolol 0.5%, betaxolol 0.5%, brimonidine 0.2% or latanoprost 0.005%) and the left eye always received balanced salt solution. In Study II, one randomly selected eye of 16 patients (age 50-79 years, mean age 65.2 years) suffering from primary open-angle glaucoma controlled with topical monotherapy was investigated, in an unmasked fashion. Four patients were on betaxolol 0.5% treatment, six subjects were receiving non-selective topical beta receptor blockers and six subjects were being treated with once daily latanoprost 0.005%.",

No significant post-treatment change of the diameter of the pre-selected arteriole was found for any topical medication investigated, either in the healthy volunteers (Study I) or in the patients suffering from glaucoma (Study II) (p>0.05, paired t-test). In addition, in Study I no difference was observed in the alteration of the arteriole diameter between the baseline and the hour 2 measurements when the values from the drug-treated and placebo treated eyes were compared (p>0.05, two-way ANOVA).", 
    "113": "In the present investigations it was not possible to detect any statistically meaningful change of the arteriole diameter at two hours after the instillation of any of several topical antiglaucoma drugs widely used in clinical practice. Further investigations are necessary to clarify whether the lack of observed change is due to the lack of retinal vascular effects of the drugs investigated, or is due to an inability of the RVA instrument in practice to detect alterations between time-points separated by several hours.", 
    "114": "We examined whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could influence blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) in rats and the possible mechanisms involved. In urethane anesthetized Wistar-Kyoto rats, BP and HR were recorded from the femoral artery around the point of rTMS at a frequency of 10 Hz and an intensity of 1.88-2.44 Tesla. rTMS but not sham stimulation reduced BP and HR by approximately 20 mmHg and approximately 30 beats/min, respectively (n = 22). Pretreatment with an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, or a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol, significantly attenuated the response, whereas the muscarinic acetylcholine antagonist, atropine, had little effect. An inhibitory effect of prazosin on BP reduction by rTMS was also observed when basal BP was preserved by a combination of prazosin and a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N-monomethyl-L-arginine. These results suggest that rTMS reduces BP through the inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system but not through activation of the parasympathetic nervous system.", 
    "115": "The information gathered by dendritic cells (DC) during the innate immune response to a pathogen is determinant for the type of adaptive response. Here we show that short-term (3 h) exposure of bone marrow-derived DC to norepinephrine (NE), at the beginning of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) stimulation hampers IL-12 production and increases IL-10 release. The NE effect was mediated by both beta- and alpha2-adrenergic receptors. The capacity of NE-exposed DC to produce IL-12 upon CD40 cross-linking as well as to stimulate allogeneic T-helper (Th) lymphocytes was reduced. Adoptive transfer of NE-exposed DC induced a Th2 slanted response in vivo. Thus, a brief NE exposure of antigen-stimulated DC seems to limit their Th1 polarizing properties. Noteworthy, the ganglionic blocker pentolinium administered in mice before skin sensitization with fluoroscein isothiocyanate (FITC) could increase the Th1-type response in the draining lymph nodes. Our results suggest that the extent of Th differentiation in the response to an antigen might be influenced by the local sympathetic nervous activity in the early phase of dendritic cell stimulation.",

In preliminary experiments, a bolus injection of adrenaline (ADR; 10 microg/kg) solution (10 microg/ml) was determined to be an edematogenic dose for inducing PE. The lung body weight index (LBI) and incidence of PE (IPE) were determined. The IPE and LBI of the group pretreated with Des-Arg9-[Leu8]-Bradykinin (DA-BK, 50 microg/kg, 50 microg/ml) increased significantly compared with those of the control group (p<0.05). On the other hand, there were no remarkable changes in IPE and LBI in the groups pretreated with Hoe140 (D-Arginyl-[Hyp3, Thi5, D-Tic7, Oic8]-Bradykinin (100 microg/kg, 100 microg/ml), captopril (20 mg/kg, 20 mg/ml) or L-NAME (1 mg/kg, 1 mg/ml). Moreover, the IPE and LBI of the group co-treated with L-NAME and DA-BK decreased compared with the DA-BK group (p<0.05). Thus, bradykinin aggravates adrenaline-induced PE through activation of the B2 receptor by the kallikreins as a result of the ADR administration, although the precise mechanism is not known.", 
    "121": "The present study determined the effects of acetylcholine (ACh) on the L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) stimulated by beta(1)- or beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonists in cat atrial myocytes. When isoproterenol (ISO; 0.1 microM) plus the beta(2)-AR antagonist ICI 118,551 (ISO-beta(1)-AR stimulation) or 0.1 microM fenoterol, a beta(2)-AR agonist (FEN-beta(2)-AR stimulation) increased I(Ca,L), ACh (1 microM) inhibited I(Ca,L) by -60 +/- 4 and -63 +/- 6 %, respectively. When ISO plus the beta(1)-AR antagonist atenolol (ISO-beta(2)-AR stimulation) or 1 microM zinterol (ZIN-beta(2)-AR stimulation) increased I(Ca,L), ACh-induced inhibition of I(Ca,L) was significantly smaller, at -21 +/- 3 and -24 +/- 3 %, respectively. L-N(5)-(1-iminoethyl)ornithine (L-NIO, 10 microM), an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, enhanced ACh-induced inhibition of I(Ca,L) when stimulated by ZIN-beta(2)-ARs, but not when stimulated by ISO-beta(1)-ARs or FEN-beta(2)-ARs. Haemoglobin (50 microM), a NO scavenger, also enhanced ACh-induced inhibition when I(Ca,L) was stimulated by ZIN-beta(2)-ARs, but not when stimulated by FEN-beta(2)-ARs. ACh-induced inhibition of I(Ca,L) stimulated by ZIN-beta(2)-ARs was not affected by 10 microM 1H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo[4,3-a] quinoxaline-1-one (ODQ) a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, but was significantly enhanced by 500 microM reduced glutathione or 100 microM dithiothreitol, agents that act as sinks for S-nitrosylation. ACh-induced inhibition was smaller when I(Ca,L) was stimulated by spermine/NO, a NO donor, than by milrinone, a phosphodiesterase type III inhibitor. ISO (ISO-beta(1)/beta(2)-AR stimulation) increased I(Ca,L) and even though ISO releases NO, ACh prominently inhibited I(Ca,L). This inhibitory effect of ACh was enhanced by L-NIO. Stimulation of ZIN-beta(2)-ARs increased intracellular NO, whereas ISO-beta(1)-ARs or FEN-beta(2)-ARs failed to increase intracellular NO. These results indicate that in atrial myocytes, NO released by selective beta(2)-AR stimulation prevents ACh-induced inhibition of I(Ca,L) stimulated by beta(2)-ARs. NO acts via a cGMP-independent, S-nitrosylation mechanism. Although FEN acts via beta(2)-ARs, it fails to stimulate G(i)-/NO signalling and preferentially stimulates G(s)-/adenylate cyclase signalling, similar to beta(1)-ARs. These findings indicate that NO signalling modulates muscarinic receptor inhibition of atrial function stimulated by beta(2)-ARs.", 
    "122": "The possible role of calcineurin in the attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis by blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor was investigated in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats. The effect of the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 was also studied. DS rats progressively developed severe hypertension when fed a diet containing 8% NaCl from 7 weeks of age. In addition, marked cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis were apparent and the activity of calcineurin and its mRNA expression in the myocardium was increased in these animals at 12 weeks in comparison with age-matched Dahl salt-resistant rats. The abundance of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 mRNAs was also increased in the hearts of DS rats at 12 weeks. Treatment of DS rats with a non-antihypertensive dose of the selective AT1 receptor blocker candesartan (1 mg/kg per day) or FK506 (0.1 mg/kg per day) from 7 to 12 weeks attenuated both calcineurin activity and its mRNA expression in the heart, as well as the development of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, without affecting cardiac function. Treatment with candesartan, but not FK506, prevented the upregulation of ACE and TGF-beta1 gene expression. Both candesartan and FK506 prevented the load-induced induction of fetal-type cardiac genes. These results demonstrate that AT1 receptor blockade attenuates the development of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis as well as the activation of calcineurin, without an antihypertensive effect, in rats with salt-sensitive hypertension. Calcineurin may be downstream from TGF-beta1 in AT1 receptor-mediated angiotensin II signaling in vivo.", 
    "123": "The brain normally derives most of its energy from the aerobic oxidation of glucose and therefore it must be nourished with a rich supply of both glucose and oxygen. Interference with the blood supply, such as in ischemia, could shift the brain to search for another source of energy and to spare its own glucose. Ischemia results not only in energy fuel disturbance, but also in free radical formation and Ca(2+) homeostasis disruption. Therefore, our investigations studied the influence of ischemia on energy fuels, on some natural free radical scavengers, and the relationship between the changes of these parameters in brain and blood. Each of these was also studied under the influence of melatonin, a well-known free radical scavenger, and nifedipine, a Ca(2+)-channel blocker and antioxidant, during ischemia followed by reperfusion (I/R). Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to global ischemia by occlusion of the two carotid arteries for 1 hr (group I), followed by reperfusion for another hour in group II. Drugs were injected after ischemia (group I), and before or after reperfusion onset in the second group. Two series of animals were used. In the first series the effect of the two drugs on the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was investigated in the cytosolic fraction of four brain areas, viz., cortex (CC), thalamus/hypothalamus (T/TH), midbrain (MB) and medulla, pons and cerebellum (MPC). Moreover, the level of both SOD and GR in the erythocytes of these rats was also estimated. In the second series, we studied the effect of each drug on the content of glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) in whole brain, in addition to the plasma levels of glucose, beta-HB and lactate. The results showed that (i), ischemia elevated the brain levels of LDH and beta-HB, as well as the plasma level of glucose, beta-HB, lactate and erythocytic GR. Conversely, it lowered glucose, SOD and GR levels in the brain; (ii), reperfusion reversed the ischemic effect on all the previously altered parameters except for plasma levels of lactate and glucose; (iii), melatonin (10 mg/kg, i.p) and nifedipine (1.5 mg/kg, i.p), restored the energy fuel levels in the brain of ischemic and I/R rats, as well as the ischemic effect on the erythocyte activities of SOD and GR. Furthermore, both drugs reversed I/R effect on the cytosolic activities of the antioxidant enzymes. We conclude that melatonin and nifedipine are both neuroprotective with improvement in the antioxidant system and energy fuels.",

Diabetes may produce metabolic alterations, interstitial fibrosis, myocellular hypertrophy, microvascular disease and autonomic dysfunction. It is thought that all of them may cause cardiomyopathy. Other abnormalities that are usually associated with diabetes such as hypertension, coronary artery disease and nephropathy should be excluded before diagnosing diabetic cardiomyopathy. There is no evidence that diabetic cardiomyopathy alone can produce heart failure. However, subclinical ventricular dysfunction has been described in young asymptomatic diabetic patients without other diseases that could affect the cardiac muscle. In these cases we should consider that diabetes is the only cause of the myocardial disease. More studies are needed to know the natural history of diabetic cardiomyopathy.", 
    "132": "Essential hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Its pathophysiological mechanism is unknown. Recent data suggests that deformability and aggregation of red blood cells may play an important role in the regulation of blood rheology in hypertension. Simultaneously there are reports suggesting that antihypertensive effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) could be counteracted by high doses of aspirin. We postulate that these effects could be related to the changes in blood rheology. Accordingly we designed a study to evaluate the effect of low or high dose of aspirin on deformability and aggregability of red blood cells from patients with essential hypertension. Deformability and aggregability of red blood cells were measured by laser diffractometer (Rheodyn SSD, Myrenne GmbH) and computerized automatic aggregometer (MA1 Myrenne GmbH, Germany), respectively. The effects of aspirin on deformability and aggregation of red blood cells were studied ex vivo in whole blood from three groups of patients with essential hypertension (group I: 10 patients receiving placebo, group II: 23 patients receiving 75 mg/day p.o. aspirin for 3 days, and group III: 23 patients receiving 300 mg/day p.o. aspirin for 3 days). Subjects in all groups received the same combination of antihypertensive agents consisting of: one of ACEI (enalapril or perindopril), one of beta-antagonists (metoprolol or bisoprolol), and diuretic agent (indapamid). In patients receiving high dose of aspirin (300 mg/day) we observed that erythrocyte aggregability was 25% higher than in the placebo group (MEA = 25.8 +/- 6 SD, vs MEA = 20.6 +/- 3 SD, p < 0.05). Aspirin had no effects on deformability of erythrocytes or on arterial blood pressure. High doses of aspirin or possibly also other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) in patients receiving antihypertensive therapy can directly affect rheological properties of the blood due to the activation of red blood cell aggregation. Increased aggregation of red blood cells during antihypertensive therapy may be an important indicator of the worsening of organ perfusion.", 
    "133": "The heat-acclimated rock pigeon is thought to use cutaneous water evaporation (CWE) as the 'preferred' route for heat dissipation, and this mechanism is controlled by adrenergic signaling. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that adjustments in skin blood flow are a crucial component of this adaptation. Skin blood flow was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry and by ultrasonic flowmetry in heat-acclimated (HAc) and non-acclimated (NAc) pigeons. Skin blood flow, CWE and rectal and skin temperatures were measured under heat exposure (T(a)=50 degrees C) or following propranolol (1.3 mg kg(-1)) or clonidine (80 microg kg(-1)) administration. Using laser Doppler flowmetry, we found a significant increase (1.3-fold) in skin blood flow in the dorsal skin of HAc pigeons following propanolol administration. In contrast, a significant decrease (0.7-fold) was observed in NAc birds. Injection of clonidine resulted in a significant decrease in skin blood flow in both HAc and NAc pigeons (0.4- and 0.5-fold, respectively). Heat exposure increased blood perfusion in both groups (2.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively). Using ultrasonic flowmetry, we showed that both propanolol and clonidine increase the arterial blood flow (Q(a)) in HAc pigeons, while venous blood flow (Q(v)) decreases. In contrast, no significant changes were found in NAc pigeons. As shown by the effect of clonidine, augmentation of skin blood flow is not a prerequisite for CWE, but normally coincides with a greater difference in arterial-venous pressure. Possible regulatory mechanisms are discussed.", 
    "134": "The hypothesis tested in this in vitro study was that the expression and production of dietary isoflavone-mediated osteoclastogenesis-regulatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), are related to the different levels of estrogen receptors expressed in two hFOB osteoblastic cell lines. OPG mRNA expression was significantly increased in both hFOB1.19 and hFOB/ER9 cells treated with 17 beta-estradiol, genistein, or daidzein at 10(-8)M in comparison to vehicle (control) (P<0.05). In both cell lines, the release of IL-6 was suppressed, while OPG production was enhanced by isoflavone treatments (P<0.05). The increased expression of OPG and decreased IL-6 production by isoflavones were dose-dependent. Responses to isoflavones were much stronger in hFOB/ER9 cells, which express the estrogen receptor 20 times higher than those in hFOB1.19 cells. After adding the ER binding blocker, ICI-182,780, the effects of isoflavones on OPG and IL-6 production disappeared. In summary, the inhibition by dietary isoflavones of IL-6 production and the stimulation of OPG appear to be mediated, at least in part, via a genomic pathway operating through estrogen receptors and gene expression mechanisms.",

    "136": "Diabetic hypertensive rats (SHR-DM) were induced by streptozotozin injected in male SHR (7-week-old),and divided into an untreated and three treated groups: 1) cilazapril treated group; 2) bosentan+amlodipine treated group; and 3) amlodipine treated group. Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHR rats served as normotensive and hypertensive control, respectively. The mean arterial blood pressure, renal function, endothelin and angiotensin II levels as well as the protein expression of renal extracellular matrix components and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 were determined at the end of the 4th week.", 
    "137": "Mean arterial blood pressure significantly increased in SHR and SHR-DM rats compared to WKY rats. All the therapies reduced the blood pressure to normal levels. However, the enhanced urinary protein excretion, the decreased creatinine clearance as well as the increased plasma and intrarenal endothelin and angiotens in II levels were found in the untreated SHR-DM and prevented by treatment with bosentan+amlodipine and cilazapril. Similarly, these two kinds of therapies in SHR-DM abolished the overexpression of renal TGF-beta1 by Western blot analysis and reduced the accumulation of collagen type IV, laminin and fibronectin proteins by an immunochemical approach. Amlodipine monotherapy had no detectable effects on the above parameters.",

Medical records of 2416 patients with newly diagnosed hypertension who were prescribed initial antihypertensive monotherapy by general practitioners in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom were evaluated. Comparisons were made among the angiotensin II receptor antagonist (AIIRA) irbesartan, all other antihypertensive classes (including AIIRAs other than irbesartan), and the AIIRA losartan. Patients initiated on the AIIRA irbesartan scored highest with a persistence rate of 60.8%, followed by patients who received all other AIIRA agents with a persistence rate of 51.3%. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and losartan were associated with comparable persistence rates, between 42.0% and 49.7%. Patients who received diuretics scored lowest with a persistence rate of 34.4%. Persistence has emerged as an essential factor for blood pressure control. Prescribing an antihypertensive agent that provides a favourable efficacy and tolerability profile may provide greater persistence with therapy and hence a higher level of blood pressure control.",

We investigated the effect of same-sex-grouped (G), crowded (GC) and isolated (I) conditions on the growth of B16 melanoma or Meth A fibrosarcoma implanted in the footpad of syngeneic male C57BL / 6 or BALB / c mice. Differential housing altered host resistance to tumor growth. The host responses to stress were reflected in thymic atrophy, which was lowest in the G mice, highest in the GC mice and intermediate in the I mice. The GC condition was a more stressful social environment than the I condition in both male C57BL / 6 and BALB / c mice. Reflecting the extent of psychosocial stress, tumor growth was augmented in the order of GC, I and G condition, and a negative mass correlation between tumor and thymus was observed, thus clearly indicating that the host resistance to tumors was attenuated by psychosocial stress. Furthermore, the stress-enhanced tumor growth and thymus atrophy were completely abrogated by the oral administration of the non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol. On the contrary, the chronic administration of corticosterone significantly induced the atrophy of thymus and spleen without affecting tumor growth. These results suggest an interrelationship among psychosocial stress, tumor growth and beta-adrenergic activation.",

Particularly unusual was an exophthalmus on both sides, a rectal temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius and a blood pressure of high level (180/110 mmHg). Laboratory findings were a low serum calcium concentration of 2.86 mval/l, a hyperphosphataemia (5.0 mg/dl), free thyroxine of 31.7 pmol/l, TSH basal of < 0.01 U/ml and positive MAK and TRAK. Serum parathormone concentration was excessively high: 766 ng/l (12-72). Ultrasound of the thyroid gland revealed a normal size with a volume of 10.4 ml; the echosonic state was not typical for Graves' disease. The initial treatment consisted of high dose thiamazole and hydrocortisone intravenous, calciumcarbonate and propranolol per os. After acute situation the treatment continued with thyreostatics, calcitriol and calciumcarbonate. The symptoms at the day of admission (tetany) disappeared within 2 days; only local paraesthesia of fingers persisted longer. Normalization of thyroid parameters was reached after 11 days; the serum calcium concentration persisted on an increasing but still lower level than standard (3.8 mval/l). During substitution parathormone decreased to 443 ng/l. What is unusual about this case is the combined appearance of autoimmunethyreoiditis (Graves' disease) and pseudohypoparathyroidism.", 
    "143": "The lack of benefit and the potential negative side effects of beta blockers are overstated, especially in the elderly. This emphasis has led to recommendations by some investigators that these agents not be used in the management of hypertension in this age group. There are numerous reasons why these recommendations should not be followed. The use of beta blockers in the elderly hypertensive has resulted in a reduction in strokes and congestive heart failure. In addition, it should be emphasized that elderly patients are more likely to have silent coronary artery disease or sustain myocardial infarctions. There is abundant evidence that beta blockers are effective therapy in reducing mortality once a myocardial infarction has occurred. In fact, there is a clear reduction in sudden cardiac death. Furthermore, national statistics document that elderly patients have a prevalence of congestive heart failure that varies from 6%-10%. Multiple studies have now documented that beta blockers are additive to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in reducing mortality for congestive heart failure. Thus, elderly hypertensive patients may benefit from the use of beta blockers, especially if there is evidence of ischemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, or congestive heart failure.",

Effects of glutamate on glia were also investigated in a C6 glioma cell line. Glutamate-induced changes in [Ca2+]i with and without UK14,304, and its analogue brimonidine were assessed by calcium-imaging techniques in retinal neurons in culture. The effect of betaxolol on [Ca2+]i was investigated in RGCs in intact rabbit retina.",

UK14,304 also increased survival (from 62% of control in glutamate only to 109% and 101% of control with 10 and 100 microM UK14,304, respectively). This effect was blocked by the specific alpha2-antagonist, yohimbine. Both UK14,304 and brimonidine (10-100 microM) reduced glutamate-induced [Ca2+]i increases in retinal neurons in culture. The actions of the alpha2-agonists in reducing glutamate-induced [Ca2+]i increases were reduced by yohimbine (1 microM).

UK14,304, acting through alpha2-ARs, was also neuroprotective in vitro. The neuroprotective actions of betaxolol and the alpha2-agonists on retinal neurons may be due, at least in part, to a direct reduction of glutamate receptor-mediated increases of [Ca2+]i.",

Vessels from the hearts of 21 patients were studied: 15 males and 6 females, aged 0.5 to 63 years. Nineteen patients were considered to be New York Heart Association class 4. All hearts exhibited hypertrophy (190+/-20%). The passive diameter of arterioles was 167+/-8 microm (range 97 to 323 microm). NE (10(-7) to 3x10(- 7) mol/L) elicited concentration-dependent dilations (47+/-4 microm) that were unaffected by endothelium removal, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (10(- 4) mol/L, an NO synthase inhibitor), or practolol (10(-6) mol/L, a beta1-receptor blocker). However, administration of propranolol (10(-5) mol/L, a combined beta1- and beta2-blocker) or butoxamine (10(-6) mol/L, a beta2-receptor blocker) completely eliminated the NE-induced dilation. Constrictions to NE (2 of 39 vessels) were inhibited by prazosin (10(-6) mol/L, an alpha1-receptor blocker).

    "155": "Pressures for rapid drug development, especially for treatments that may affect public health significantly, drive a need to reconsider what is necessary to establish the \"substantial evidence\" of efficacy and safety required for regulatory approval. The concept of substantial evidence of effect can be stated fairly simply in principle, but its application to the evaluation of findings from real clinical drug development programs can be quite complicated and depend on circumstances relating to the population studied and the condition being treated. This paper discusses a number of considerations that arise in attempting to address this issue. These include confirmation of efficacy/safety as opposed to replication of results, the use of surrogates for the clinical outcome, ethical considerations, the use of trials aimed at demonstrating equivalence or noninferiority instead of superiority of a new drug, and the balance between benefits and risks. Recent developments such as the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines dealing with statistical principles and choice of control group, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidances interpreting the 1998 Modernization Act identify useful alternative definitions of substantial evidence and also identify when a single study can be enough to demonstrate a clinically important effect. The primary difficulty with the use of noninferiority trials is the need to demonstrate assay sensitivity or validity, i.e., that the trial would have demonstrated the superiority of the active control treatment to placebo had the trial included a placebo group. Failure to demonstrate a significant difference between the presumed active treatments and an inactive control precludes a definitive conclusion of assay validity, but external evidence, e.g., from trials demonstrating the activity of the active control, may yet justify concluding that the trial was assay valid. Issues of interpretation of important unexpected findings are illustrated in the recent experience with the alpha- and beta-blocker carvedilol, where there was a significant reduction in mortality among patients on carvedilol relative to placebo, but a treatment effect could not be demonstrated for the primary outcome. Experience with trials of thrombolytic agents illustrates alternative strategies for demonstrating substantial evidence of effect. Finally, meta-analyses can contribute to the substantial evidence by synthesizing the findings from separate trials to provide a perspective on drug performance in a heterogeneous population of patients that no single trial could provide.",

    "157": "Many advances have been made in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes. Patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk features should receive treatment with the newer pharmacologic agents--enoxaparin, statins and, in selected cases, clopidogrel--in addition to established standard therapies (i.e., aspirin, beta-blockers, nitroglycerin, and oxygen). Use of GpIIb-IIIa inhibitors should also be strongly considered, especially in an early invasive approach. However, there is no substitute for a good physician who has the big picture and knows the individual patient in totality. This physician can best judge the dangers of the patient's acute cardiac condition against the comorbidities that may be exacerbated by revascularization procedures. The ability to weigh the risks of the patient's acute coronary syndrome against the risks of an aggressive invasive approach ultimately provides the best care for each patient.", 
    "158": "The objective of this study was to develop a \"best-practice\" treatment algorithm for the management of primary open-angle glaucoma in patients receiving initial medical therapy, to serve as a consideration for future ophthalmology practice. For comparison, a baseline, \"common-practice\" treatment algorithm was also created that reflects current ophthalmology practice patterns. Survey instruments were developed based on a comprehensive review of relevant literature, along with input from a general ophthalmologist. A panel of eight ophthalmologists subspecialized in glaucoma management was surveyed. Consensus was achieved using a modified Delphi technique. A comparison of common- and best-practice treatment algorithms suggests that in contrast with expert opinion, nonselective beta blockers are currently used more often, and alpha-2 agonists less often, as first-line therapy for the treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma.",

    "187": "The efferent pathways involved in the tachycardia induced by intracisternal injections of the N-terminal galanin fragment (1-15) (GAL (1-15)) and galanin (GAL (1-29)) has been evaluated in rats pretreated with the cholinergic antagonist atropine or the beta-antagonist propranolol. The pretreatment with propranolol significantly blocked the tachycardic and vasopressor effect produced by intracisternal injection of GAL (1-15) (p<0.05), but the pretreatment with atropine did not modify these cardiovascular effects. However, the cardiovascular response elicited by GAL (1-29) is modified by the pretreatment with atropine (p<0.05) but not by propranolol. These findings demonstrate that the central cardiovascular action of GAL (1-15), but not GAL (1-29), is mediated by beta-receptor stimulation and this suggests the existence of a different pathway involved in the cardiovascular response produced by the N-terminal galanin fragment as compared with the parent molecule GAL (1-29).", 
    "188": "Survival of patients with heart failure has improved over the past decade due to advances in medical therapy. However, sudden cardiac death continues to cause 35 to 65% of death. Ventricular arrhythmias are important causes of sudden cardiac death in patients with heart failure. The risks of antiarrhythmic drugs are increased in patients with heart failure. Therefore, in the absence of a clear indication, antiarrhythmic drug therapy should be avoided. A number of recent randomized trials have provided evidence that beta-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme(ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers(ARB) significantly reduces the risk of sudden death in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. For patients who have a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia(VT) or ventricular fibrillation(VF) amiodarone or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator(ICD) should be considered, and these therapy may benefit some high risk patients who have nonsustained VT.", 
    "189": "Diabetic nephropathy is associated with a high risk of cardiac mortality including sudden death. This is presumably related to an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic tone resulting in a decreased heart rate variability (HRV). In non-diabetic patients a decreased HRV is known to be a strong predictor of cardiovascular death. Studies in non-diabetic patients have shown that beta-blockers improve HRV parameters known to reflect parasympathetic function. The aim of our study was to investigate effects of additional beta-blocker treatment on: cardiac autonomic function, blood pressure, and urine albumin excretion in ACE-inhibitor treated Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus patients with abnormal albuminuria.", 
    "190": "We studied the effects of 6 weeks treatment with metoprolol (100 mg once daily, zero order kinetics formulation) in 20 patients participating in a randomised, placebo controlled, double blind, crossover trial. Patients were simultaneously monitored under ambulatory conditions with 24-h Holter-monitoring, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure recording, and 24-h fractionated urine collections. Heart rate variability was assessed by four different methods; ambulatory HRV analysis was carried out by spectral and time domain analysis, and on days of investigation short-term spectral analysis and bed-side tests were carried out.", 
    "191": "Metoprolol treatment improved in vagal tone assessed by short-term spectral analysis. The 24-h ambulatory HRV analysis showed improvement in some parameters reflecting vagal function. A minor decrease in daytime diastolic blood pressure was shown, no alterations in diurnal variation of blood pressure or urine albumin excretion were observed.", 
    "192": "These preliminary findings indicate that beta-blocker treatment could improve autonomic function in Type I diabetic patients with abnormal albuminuria and an associated high risk of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "193": "Sulfur mustard (2,2(')-dichloroethyl sulfide) is a chemical warfare agent that causes incapacitating skin blisters in humans 12-24h post-exposure following a variable asymptomatic phase. Recent reports demonstrate that inflammation plays a vital role in sulfur mustard toxicity. One of the key biochemical pathways involved in inflammation is the arachidonic acid cascade. In this report, we demonstrate that arachidonic acid is released in response to sulfur mustard and investigate the mechanisms of arachidonic acid release. Exposure to sulfur mustard caused a 5- to 8-fold increase in arachidonic acid release from human keratinocytes that had been radiolabeled with arachidonic acid. Maximal arachidonic acid release occurred between 12 and 24h. Several enzymatic pathways can lead to arachidonic acid release. Treatment with 2.0% (v/v) ethanol, an inhibitor of phospholipase D, decreased sulfur mustard-induced arachidonic acid release 40+/-7%. Additionally, 100 microM (+/-)-propranolol, an inhibitor of phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase, blocked sulfur mustard-induced arachidonic acid release by 62+/-3%. These findings suggest that arachidonic acid release is mediated by phospholipase D and phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase in human keratinocytes following sulfur mustard exposure. Due to the 12-24h delay in arachidonic acid release following sulfur mustard exposure, delayed therapeutic intervention may be possible. Indeed, we found that the addition of 100 microM (+/-)-propranolol up to 18 h after sulfur mustard exposure was still able to block arachidonic acid release by 30+/-3%.", 
    "194": "A system for the quantitative analysis of ligand-receptor interactions is presented, based on models of different levels of complexity. For two pools of receptors, binding of a radioactive ligand is described by b = [(Bml x A(nl))/(K(nl)dl + A(nl))] + [(Bm2 x A(n2))/(Kn2(d2) + A(n2))], (1) where b is the number of bound receptors at a ligand concentration [A], Bml and Bm2 are the receptor concentrations. Kdl and Kd2 are dissociation constants for the ligand-receptor complex, and n1 and n2 are Hill coefficients. The magnitude of the physiological response for a system consisting of two discrete pools of receptors with different affinities is given by p = [(Pm x A(nl))/(EC50(nl) + A(nl))] + [(Pm2 x A(n2)/(EC50(n2)2 + A(n2))], (2) where p is the magnitude of the response to an agonist (or antagonist) at concentration [A], Pml and Pm2 are the maximal magnitudes of the responses for the individual pools of receptors, EC50(1) and EC50(2) are the agonist concentrations giving responses of magnitudes Pm1/2 and Pm2/2, and n1 and n2 are Hill coefficients. The parameters of these equations show: the number of pools of receptors with different affinities for the ligand (Kd or EC50), the number of active receptors (Bmax) or the magnitudes of the maximal response (Pmax), and the numbers of ligand molecules binding with the receptor (n, the Hill coefficient). E is the efficiency (E = Bmax/2Kd, or E = Pmax/2EC50) and gives the overall characteristics of the activity of the effector system. This method of analysis can be applied to any biological reactions whose results can be presented quantitatively.", 
    "195": "The mechanism and treatment of hypertensive systolic heart failure are not well defined. We compared the effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (cilazapril, 10 mg/kg), an angiotensin receptor blocker (candesartan, 3 mg/kg), a calcium channel blocker (benidipine, 1, 3 or 6 mg/kg), and the same calcium channel blocker combined with renin-angiotensin blockers on systolic heart failure in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats. DS rats were fed an 8% Na diet from 6 weeks of age and then subjected to the above drug treatments. Benidipine (1 mg/kg), cilazapril, and candesartan had compatible hypotensive effects and similar beneficial effects on cardiac hypertrophy, gene expression, and survival rate. The combination of benidipine with cilazapril or candesartan was found to have no additional beneficial effects on the above parameters, with the exception of a reduction in atrial natriuretic polypeptide gene expression. On the other hand, candesartan normalized serum creatinine, but serum creatinine was unaffected by either benidipine at 1 or 3 mg/kg or cilazapril. Further, the combined use of benidipine and either candesartan or cilazapril resulted in an additional reduction of urinary albumin excretion in DS rats. Thus systolic heart failure in DS rats is mainly mediated by hypertension, while renal dysfunction of DS rats is due to both hypertension and the AT1 receptor itself. These findings suggest that the combination of a calcium channel blocker with an AT1 receptor blocker or ACE inhibitor may be more effective in treating the renal dysfunction associated with systolic heart failure than monotherapy with either agent alone. However, further studies will be needed before reaching any definitive conclusion on the efficacy of this combination therapy in patients with heart failure."
