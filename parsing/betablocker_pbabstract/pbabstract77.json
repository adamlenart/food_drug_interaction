Inter-individual variability in response to both drug classes is well recognized, yet the identity and relative contribution of the genetic players involved are poorly understood. This work is the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) addressing the values and susceptibility of cardiovascular-related traits to a selective \u03b2(1)-blocker, Atenolol (ate), and a \u03b2-agonist, Isoproterenol (iso). The phenotypic dataset consisted of 27 highly heritable traits, each measured across 22 inbred mouse strains and four pharmacological conditions. The genotypic panel comprised 79922 informative SNPs of the mouse HapMap resource. Associations were mapped by Efficient Mixed Model Association (EMMA), a method that corrects for the population structure and genetic relatedness of the various strains. A total of 205 separate genome-wide scans were analyzed. The most significant hits include three candidate loci related to cardiac and body weight, three loci for electrocardiographic (ECG) values, two loci for the susceptibility of atrial weight index to iso, four loci for the susceptibility of systolic blood pressure (SBP) to perturbations of the \u03b2-adrenergic system, and one locus for the responsiveness of QTc (p<10(-8)). An additional 60 loci were suggestive for one or the other of the 27 traits, while 46 others were suggestive for one or the other drug effects (p<10(-6)). Most hits tagged unexpected regions, yet at least two loci for the susceptibility of SBP to \u03b2-adrenergic drugs pointed at members of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Loci for cardiac-related traits were preferentially enriched in genes expressed in the heart, while 23% of the testable loci were replicated with datasets of the Mouse Phenome Database (MPD). Altogether these data and validation tests indicate that the mapped loci are relevant to the traits and responses studied.",

    "2": "Mice were administered Timoptic-XE (0.0%, 0.25%, or 0.50%) daily from 9 weeks to 12 months of age. Visual ability and IOP were evaluated at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age. Mice from each group were then given intraocular injections of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP), and estimates of the number of cells in the ganglion cell layer of the retina, WGA-HRP transneural labeling of cells, cell count, and cross-sectional area of Nissl-stained cells in the superior colliculus were obtained.", 
    "3": "Mice treated with 0.50% and 0.25% Timoptic-XE maintained a high level of performance in behavioral vision tasks, while 12-month-old untreated mice (0.0% Timoptic-XE) exhibited impaired visual performance. Timoptic-XE therapy reduced IOP and cell loss in the ganglion cell layer of the retina and prevented somal shrinkage and the decrease in WGA-HRP transneural labeling in the superior colliculus that occurred in untreated mice at 12 months of age.", 
    "4": "This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the efficacy of Timoptic-XE in DBA/2J mice by correlating age-related visual system changes in the retina and brain with changes in IOP and visual ability. These results showed that reducing IOP not only rescued retinal ganglion cell atrophy but also restored visual function and altered patterns of neurodegeneration that occur with blindness.", 
    "5": "The mechanism or mechanisms that cause intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses (IPAVA) to either open during exercise in subjects breathing room air and at rest when breathing hypoxic gas mixtures, or to close during exercise while breathing 100% oxygen, remain unknown. During conditions when IPAVA are open, plasma epinephrine (EPI) and dopamine (DA) concentrations both increase, potentially representing a common mechanism. The purpose of this study was to determine whether EPI or DA infusions open IPAVA in resting subjects breathing room air and, subsequently, 100% oxygen. We hypothesized that these catecholamine infusions would open IPAVA. We performed saline-contrast echocardiography in nine subjects without a patent foramen ovale before and during serial EPI and DA infusions while breathing room air and then while breathing 100% oxygen. Bubble scores (0-5) were assigned based on the number and spatial distribution of bubbles in the left ventricle. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) was estimated using Doppler ultrasound, while cardiac output (Q(C)) was measured using echocardiography. Bubble scores were significantly greater during EPI infusions of 80-320 ng\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) compared with baseline when subjects breathed room air; however, bubble scores did not increase when they breathed 100% oxygen. At comparable Q(C) and PASP, intravenous DA (16 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) and EPI (40 ng\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) resulted in identical bubble scores. Subsequent studies revealed that \u03b2-blockade did not prevent hypoxia-induced opening of IPAVA. We suggest that increases in Q(C) or PASP (or both) secondary to EPI or DA infusions open IPAVA in normoxia. The closing mechanism associated with breathing 100% oxygen is independent from the opening mechanisms.",

ADR treatment reduced left ventricular systolic dysfunction as assessed by a significant decrease in fractional shortening (FS) (2D) and global peak-systolic strain (GPSS; 2DS). In addition, ADR treatment significantly increased plasma troponin I and LDH. Pretreatment of ADR-treated patients with carvedilol resulted in a significant increase in FS (2D) and GPSS (2DS).

Both a fixed-effect model and a random-effect model can be used for trial design and data analysis of a multi-regional clinical trial. In this paper, we first compare these two models in terms of the required sample size, type I error rate control, and the interpretability of trial results. We then apply the empirical shrinkage estimation approach based on the random-effect model to two criteria of consistency assessment of treatment effects across regions. As demonstrated in our computations, compared with the sample estimator, the shrinkage estimator of the treatment effect of an individual region borrowing information from the other regions is much closer to the estimator of the overall treatment effect, has smaller variability, and therefore provides much higher probability for demonstrating consistency. We use a multinational trial example with time to event endpoint to illustrate the application of the method.", 
    "17": "Conventional open repair or endovascular aneurysm repair is indicated for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) when the diameter of the latter is \u2265 5.5 cm. This therapeutic strategy is based on results of randomized trials of open repair versus ultrasound surveillance of small AAA (<5.5 cm). Studies of screening for AAA have shown that >90% of aneurysms detected are small aneurysms (<5.5 cm). Despite the low annual risk of rupture of these aneurysms, patients with small AAA are left with a potentially life-threatening disease for which no immediate treatment is available. Hence, medical treatment directed at limiting the expansion of small AAA has emerged as an alternative therapeutic strategy. Randomized trials of doxycycline, roxithromycin, and propranolol in patients with small AAA have been published. The results of the doxycycline and roxithromycin trials suggest that both medications can limit AAA expansion, especially during the first year of treatment. Propranolol did not limit AAA expansion, and the trials were stopped because of its serious side effects. In other studies, statins and indomethacin have also been shown to limit AAA expansion. However, these studies were observational with relatively small numbers of patients. Thus, large randomized controlled trials with long follow-up are needed to objectively assess the efficacy of medications that have shown potential in limiting AAA expansion. In addition, recent evidence of regression of AAA in experimental animal models is likely to change our concepts of the molecular pathogenesis of AAA, and could make medical treatment of small AAA a possibility.",

The present study demonstrated that T-2 toxin caused marked arrhythmias, such as second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, sinus bradycardia, supraventricular extrasystole, and ventricular extrasystole, which were accompanied by a significant increase in heart rate and a significant decrease in total power and low- and high-frequency power of heart rate variability, during 3 days of observation after the toxin administration. However, the occurrence of arrhythmia with conduction disturbance such as second-degree atrioventricular blocks was markedly diminished by pretreatment with atropine, while the occurrence of ventricular extrasystole was augmented by atropine. The present study with the telemetric measurement elucidated and confirmed that T-2 toxin produced significant cardiac dysfunctions involving disturbance of the conduction pathway influenced by the autonomic nervous activity and also possible direct effects on cardiac myocytes.",

The disease is endemic in all continental Latin American countries, but has become a worldwide problem because of migration of infected individuals to developed countries, mainly in Europe and North America. Chagas cardiomyopathy results from the combined effects of persistent parasitism, parasite-driven tissue inflammation, microvascular and neurogenic dysfunction, and autoimmune responses triggered by the infection. Clinical presentation varies widely according to the extent of myocardial damage, and manifests mainly as three basic syndromes that can coexist in an individual patient: heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, and thromboembolism. NYHA functional class, left ventricular systolic function, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia are important prognostic markers of the risk of death. Management of Chagas cardiomyopathy focuses on the treatment of the three main syndromes. The use of \u03b2-blockers in patients with Chagas disease and heart failure is safe, well tolerated, and should be encouraged.

    "55": "Emotionally charged events are associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). In this study we assessed RR and QT variability index (QTVI) at baseline during anger recall test (AR). We calculated QTVI from a 5-min ECG recording and from a 10-beats segment around the presumed maximum sympathetic activation in thirty post-myocardial infarction patients under \u03b2-blocker therapy and 10 controls underwent. In all groups, the low-frequency component of RR and SBP increased during AR. In all recordings, the QTVI calculated on a 5-min ECG recording and the QTVI(10 beats) were higher in patients than in controls (P < 0.05). The QTVI during AR remained unchanged from baseline within each group. Conversely, during AR, the QTVI(10 beats) in controls diminished significantly (P < 0.05) from baseline whereas in patients remained unchanged. The inability to buffer an acute stress-induced increase in sympathetic activity could explain why events charged with acute stress are associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias in this setting of patients and support the role of cognitive behavior stress management strategies.", 
    "56": "Although the pathophysiology and treatment of adult heart failure (HF) are well studied, HF in children remains poorly understood. In adults, adrenergic receptor (AR)-mediated adaptation plays a central role in cardiac abnormalities in HF, and these patients respond well to \u03b2-blocker (BB) therapy. However, in children with HF, there is a growing body of literature suggesting a lack of efficacy of adult HF therapies. Due to these unanticipated differences in response to therapy and the paucity of data regarding the molecular adaptation of the paediatric heart, we investigated the molecular characteristics of HF in children.", 
    "57": "Explanted hearts from adults and children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and non-failing controls were used in the study. Our results show that the molecular characteristics of paediatric HF are strikingly different from their adult counterparts. These differences include: (i) down-regulation of \u03b21- and \u03b22-AR in children, whereas \u03b22-AR expression is maintained in adults; (ii) up-regulation of connexin43 in children, whereas down-regulation is observed in adults; (iii) no differences in phosphatase expression, whereas up-regulation is observed in adults; (iv) no decrease in the phosphorylation of phospholamban at the Ser16 or Thr17 sites in children, which are known characteristics of adult HF.",

    "59": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the cutaneous analgesic effect of propranolol and compare with a local anesthetic lidocaine. The potencies and equipotent doses were determined for infiltrative cutaneous analgesia on the rat back by determination of dose-response curves for propranolol and lidocaine. Propranolol as well as lidocaine elicited dose-dependent cutaneous analgesia. On a 50% effective dose (ED(50)) basis, the relative potency was propranolol (10.3 [8.9-11.9]\u03bcmolkg(-1))>lidocaine (25.8 [24.3-27.8]\u03bcmolkg(-1)) (P<0.01). On equianalgesic doses (ED(25), ED(50), ED(75)), propranolol produced longer action of infiltrative cutaneous analgesia than lidocaine (P<0.01). Coadministration of lidocaine (25.8\u03bcmolkg(-1)) and propranolol (1.7\u03bcmolkg(-1)) exhibited greater blockade and duration than lidocaine (25.8\u03bcmolkg(-1)) or propranolol (1.7\u03bcmolkg(-1)) alone. Propranolol displayed more potent and longer duration of action than lidocaine at producing cutaneous analgesia. Furthermore, propranolol may prove useful as an adjuvant for lidocaine in producing cutaneous analgesia.",

    "63": "In order to quantify small molecules at the early stage of drug discovery, we developed a quantitation approach based on mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) without the use of a labeled compound. We describe a method intended to respond to the main challenges encountered in quantification through MALDI imaging dedicated to whole-body or single heterogeneous organ samples (brain, eye, liver). These include the high dependence of the detected signal on the matrix deposition, the MALDI ionization yield of specific target molecules, and lastly, the ion suppression effect on the tissue. To address these challenges, we based our approach on the use of a normalization factor called the TEC (Tissue Extinction Coefficient). This factor takes into account the ion suppression effect that is both tissue- and drug-specific. Through this protocol, the amount of drug per gram of tissue was determined, which in turn, was compared with other analytical techniques such as Liquid Chromatography-Mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).", 
    "64": "Exercise in healthy subjects is usually associated with progressive bronchodilatation. Though the decrease in vagal tone is deemed to be the main underlying mechanism, activation of bronchial \u03b2(2)-receptors may constitute an additional cause. To examine the contribution of \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptors to bronchodilatation during exercise in healthy humans, we studied 15 healthy male volunteers during maximum exercise test at control conditions and after a non-selective \u03b2-adrenergic blocker (carvedilol 12.5mg twice a day until heart rate decreased at least by 10beats/min) and inhaled \u03b2(2)-agonist (albuterol 400\u03bcg). Airway caliber was estimated from the partial flow at 40% of control forced vital capacity (V\u02d9(part40)) and its changes during exercise from the slope of linear regression analysis of V\u02d9(part40) values against the corresponding minute ventilation during maximal exercise until exhaustion. At control, V\u02d9(part40) increased progressively and significantly with exercise. After albuterol, resting V\u02d9(part40) was significantly larger than at control increased but did not further increase during exercise. After carvedilol, V\u02d9(part40) was similar to control but its increase with exercise was significantly attenuated. These findings suggest that \u03b2(2)-adrenergic system plays a major role in exercise-induced bronchodilation in healthy subjects.", 
    "65": "During physiological or psychological stress, catecholamines produced by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) regulate the immune system. Previous studies report that the activation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2ARs) mediates the actions of catecholamines and increases pro-inflammatory cytokine production in a number of different cell types. The impact of the SNS on the immune modulation of social defeat has not been examined. The following studies were designed to determine whether SNS activation during social disruption stress (SDR) influences anxiety-like behavior as well as the activation, priming, and glucocorticoid resistance of splenocytes after social stress. CD-1 mice were exposed to one, three, or six cycles of SDR and HPLC analysis of the plasma and spleen revealed an increase in catecholamines. After six cycles of SDR the open field test was used to measure behaviors characteristic of anxiety and indicated that the social defeat induced increase in anxiety-like behavior was blocked by pre-treatment with the \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Pre-treatment with the \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist propranolol did not significantly alter corticosterone levels indicating no difference in activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In addition to anxiety-like behavior the SDR induced splenomegaly and increase in plasma IL-6, TNF\u03b1, and MCP-1 were each reversed by pre-treatment with propranolol. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis of cells from propranolol pretreated mice reduced the SDR-induced increase in the percentage of CD11b(+) splenic macrophages and significantly decreased the expression of TLR2, TLR4, and CD86 on the surface of these cells. In addition, supernatants from 18h LPS-stimulated ex vivo cultures of splenocytes from propranolol-treated SDR mice contained less IL-6. Likewise propranolol pre-treatment abrogated the glucocorticoid insensitivity of CD11b(+) cells ex vivo when compared to splenocytes from SDR vehicle-treated mice. Together, this study demonstrates that the immune activation and priming effects of SDR result, in part, as a consequence of SNS activation.", 
    "66": "In the paper, a novel carbon nanofiber paste electrode (CFPE) was fabricated and firstly used as a sensitive amperometric detector in capillary electrophoresis (CE) for the simultaneous determination of three \u03b2-blockers: sotalol, alprenolol and atenolol. Compared with the bare carbon paste electrode, the CFPE exhibited enhanced oxidation peak current responses to the analytes due to its excellent electrocatalytic activities, high conductivity and large effective surface area. Subsequently, effects of several important factors such as detection potential, pH and concentration of running buffer, separation voltage and injection time on the analysis were investigated. Under the optimum conditions, the three analytes could be separated and detected in a phosphate buffer (pH 8.5) within 11 min. The linear ranges were 0.1-100 \u03bcM for sotalol, 0.2-150 \u03bcM for alprenolol and 0.1-50 \u03bcM for atenolol and the detection limits were as low as 10(-8)M magnitude (S/N=3). Moreover, the CFPE exhibited good repeatability and long-time stability. The proposed method was applied to determine the three \u03b2-blockers in spiked urine samples with satisfactory assay results. The good performance, low cost and straightforward preparation method of CFPE demonstrated that it could be used as a detector for CE-amperometric detection system for drug analysis.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of propranolol on heart rate and development in embryos of two species of fish; Japanese medaka (JM) Oryzias latipes and zebrafish (ZF) Danio rerio. Parents and fertilized embryos of each species were exposed to nominal (measured) concentrations of 0.1 (0.09), 1 (1.1) and 10 (8.3) \u03bcg/L of propranolol. Heart rate was monitored during subsequent exposure in embryos at incremental developmental periods (44, 54, 64 h post-fertilization (hpf) for ZF and 68, 116, 164 hpf for JM). Heart development and morphology was examined using whole mount immunostaining with distance measurements between the sinus venosus (SV) and bulbus arteriosis (BV). Morphological measurements were made at 44 hpf for ZF and 164 hpf for JM. In ZF, a significant reduction in heart rate was observed at 0.08 \u03bcg/L propranolol, along with an increase in the SV-BA distance at 44 hpf. Significant reductions in heart rate were also observed in ZF at 54 and 64 hpf at all concentrations of propranolol. For JM, heart rates generally decreased at all developmental timepoints (68, 116 and 164 hpf) after propranolol treatment, with concentration dependent decreases observed at 164 hpf and a lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) of 0.09 \u03bcg/L propranolol at each timepoint.

It was found out in E17-18 that the DOPA administration regardless of dose, while in E19-20 dose-dependently produces continuous generalized activity. Between E18 and E19, ontogenetically new is the appearance in 92 % of embryos of stereotypical head movements (circular movements, lateral and dorso-ventral flexions) following in the nearsecond rhythm. Injection of DOPA to rat embryos increased 2-6 times the number of respiratory movements by the gasping type in E17-20 and decreased the amount of episodes of continuous rhythmical respiration in E19-20. No significant heart rate changes were observed after introduction of DOPA to E17-20. There was noted a tendency for a weak acceleration of the heart rate. The changes in activities of the motor and respiratory systems due to a rise of catecholamine level are not connected with activation of the dopamine system, as they are not reduced by blockade of dopamine receptors.",

Hypertension is the most-prevalent modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide, and clinical data suggest that hypertension is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study we tested whether propranolol, a \u03b2-receptor antagonist commonly used as antihypertensive drug, could ameliorate the cognitive impairments and increases in AD-related markers shown by the senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8). Propranolol administration (5 mg/kg for 3 weeks) to 6-month-old SAMP8 mice attenuated cognitive memory impairments shown by these mice in the novel object recognition test. In the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice it has been found increases in A\u03b2(42) levels, the principal constituent of amyloid plaques observed in AD, accompanied by both an increased expression of the cleaving enzyme BACE1 and a decreased expression of the degrading enzyme IDE. All these effects were reversed by propranolol treatment. Tau hyperphosphorylation (PHF-1 epitope) shown by SAMP8 mice at this age was also decreased in the hippocampus of propranolol-treated mice, an effect probably related to a decrease in JNK1 expression. Interestingly, propranolol also phosphorylated Akt in SAMP8 mice, which was associated with an increase of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 phosphorylation, contributing therefore to the reductions in Tau hyperphosphorylation. Synaptic pathology in SAMP8 mice, as shown by decreases in synaptophysin and BDNF, was also counteracted by propranolol treatment. Overall, propranolol might be beneficial in age-related brain dysfunction and could be an emerging candidate for the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases.

Following treatment of the primary cancer, emotional and psychosocial factors within this population precipitate time to recurrence and death, however the underlying mechanism(s) remain unclear. Using a mouse model of bone metastasis, we provide experimental evidence that activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which is one of many pathophysiological consequences of severe stress and depression, promotes MDA-231 breast cancer cell colonization of bone via a neurohormonal effect on the host bone marrow stroma. We demonstrate that induction of RANKL expression in bone marrow osteoblasts, following \u03b22AR stimulation, increases the migration of metastatic MDA-231 cells in vitro, independently of SDF1-CXCR4 signaling. We also show that the stimulatory effect of endogenous (chronic stress) or pharmacologic sympathetic activation on breast cancer bone metastasis in vivo can be blocked with the \u03b2-blocker propranolol, and by knockdown of RANK expression in MDA-231 cells. These findings indicate that RANKL promotes breast cancer cell metastasis to bone via its pro-migratory effect on breast cancer cells, independently of its effect on bone turnover. The emerging clinical implication, supported by recent epidemiological studies, is that \u03b2AR-blockers and drugs interfering with RANKL signaling, such as Denosumab, could increase patient survival if used as adjuvant therapy to inhibit both the early colonization of bone by metastatic breast cancer cells and the initiation of the \"vicious cycle\" of bone destruction induced by these cells.",

We observed that the intracellular calcium content of P. bainier 229-7 mycelia was increased in response to exposure to high external Ca(2+) concentrations. Both ginsenoside Rd biotransformation and \u03b2-glucosidase activity were both found to be dependent on the external calcium concentration. At an optimal Ca(2+) concentration of 45 mM, maximal ginsenoside Rd bioconversion rate of 92.44% was observed and maximal \u03b2-glucosidase activity of 0.1778 U was reached in a 72-h biotransformation.

Here, we investigated whether the non-selective calcium channel blocker bepridil, which also inhibits \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP, affects thalamic accumulation of A\u03b2 and calcium and in turn influences functional recovery in rats subjected to MCAO. A 27-day bepridil treatment (50 mg/kg, p.o.) initiated 2 days after MCAO significantly decreased the levels of soluble A\u03b240, A\u03b242 and calcium in the ipsilateral thalamus, as compared with vehicle-treated MCAO rats. Expression of seladin-1/DHCR24 protein, which is a potential protective factor against neuronal damage, was decreased at both mRNA and protein levels in the ipsilateral thalamus of MCAO rats. Conversely, bepridil treatment restored seladin-1/DHCR24 expression in the ipsilateral thalamus. Bepridil treatment did not significantly affect heme oxygenase-1- or NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1-mediated oxidative stress or inflammatory responses in the ipsilateral thalamus of MCAO rats. Finally, bepridil treatment mitigated MCAO-induced alterations in APP processing in the ipsilateral thalamus and improved contralateral forelimb use in MCAO rats. These findings suggest that bepridil is a plausible therapeutic candidate in AD or stroke owing to its multifunctional role in key cellular events that are relevant for the pathogenesis of these diseases.",

Effects of the Hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) K4M and EUDRAGIT L100 amount on drug release were investigated. For this purpose 13 kinds of formulations were prepared at three different levels of each variables. The optimization of the formulation was evaluated by using ANN method. Two formulation parameters, the amounts of HPMC K4M and Eudragit L100 at three levels (-1, 0, 1) were selected as independent/input variables.

By using experimental dissolution results and amount of HPMC K4M and EUDRAGIT L100, percentage of dissolved carvedilol was predicted by ANN. Similarity factor (f2) between predicted and experimentally observed profile was calculated and f2 value was found 76.33. This value showed that there was no difference between predicted and experimentally observed drug release profile. As a result of these experiments, it was found that ANNs can be successfully used to optimize controlled release drug delivery systems.",

Therefore, it is important to raise the awareness on the natural history of PH in children, the utility of tools that help preventing and managing acute bleeding, and the signs predicting a poor outcome, thus indicating surgery. There is lack of data on the ability of endoscopy screening, endoscopic treatment of varices, and use of nonselective \u03b2-blockers to alter the outcome of PH in children; major efforts should be made to avoid such treatments empirically and promote multicenter trials instead. Nevertheless, such approach should be balanced against the need of offering the best care to children with PH. In this review, we discuss the advances made in the management of PH in children and compare it with the larger adult experience. A rational approach to acute gastrointestinal bleeding is proposed along with an algorithm suggesting a stepwise protocol to manage children with esophageal varices in the long-term, with some hints on possible future studies.", 
    "211": "Heart failure with preserved systolic function (HFPSF) has attained epidemic proportions; however evidence-based therapeutic interventions have not advanced despite continued research over the past three decades. We propose the combined use of direct renin inhibitor and carvedilol for this condition.", 
    "212": "The Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS) plays a central role in myocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis and ventricular remodeling which is responsible for the diastolic dysfunction in HFPSF. Rising serum aldosterone levels with age have been implicated as a cause of myocardial fibrosis in the elderly. The sole use of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers is associated with angiotensin-II and aldosterone escape and increased plasma renin activity. Carvedilol is a novel third generation non-selective \u03b2-blocker. The use of combination therapy will facilitate in better blood pressure control, reduce afterload, improve ventricular relaxation, cause regression of ventricular remodeling/fibrosis, maintain atrioventricular synchrony and enhance cardio-metabolic profile. The individual benefits of direct renin inhibitor and carvedilol could plausibly have a supra-additive effect when used in combination. Besides this, carvedilol can further reduce generation of free radicals, decrease LDL oxidation, improve Doppler echo diastolic parameters and decrease cardiac norepinephrine and density of cardiac \u03b2-receptors.", 
    "213": "Evidence suggests that patients with HFPSF are treated less aggressively as compared to patients with heart failure with systolic dysfunction. Aggressive therapy with concurrent use of direct renin inhibitor and carvedilol will help in improving outcomes in this vulnerable patient sub-population. No prior trial has evaluated the combined use of these drugs for the treatment of HFPSF.", 
    "214": "No clinical practice guidelines are available for the treatment of heart failure (HF) in patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).", 
    "215": "To determine how cardiologists manage medical treatment in HF patients after hospital discharge, according to LVEF.", 
    "216": "The FUTURE study was a cross-sectional survey conducted in HF outpatients by French private cardiologists between September 2007 and August 2008. Patients had to have been hospitalized within the previous 18 months with a diagnosis of HF. Clinical data and HF treatments (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs], angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs], beta-blockers, diuretics and aldosterone antagonists) were recorded retrospectively, with precise information on drug doses, at two successive time points (at hospital discharge and at the index consultation). HF treatment was compared in patients with reduced (less than or equal to 40%) versus preserved (more than 40%) LVEF.", 
    "217": "Completed data were available for 1137 HF patients enrolled by 424 cardiologists. Mean patient age was 72\u00b111 years; LVEF was reduced in 56% and preserved in 44%. The therapeutic approach was similar in the two groups, both at hospital discharge and at the index consultation. At the index consultation, HF treatment was: beta-blocker (74%); ACEI/ARB (83%); loop diuretic (86%); aldosterone antagonist (31%). The majority of patients (62%) received a beta-blocker plus an ACEI or an ARB; 56% reached more than or equal to 50% of the target dose for each treatment. There were no major differences in treatments and dosages between the groups with low and preserved LVEF. In 15% of cases where the drug dose was not increased, fear of adverse events was reported as the reason.", 
    "218": "The FUTURE survey showed a similar approach to HF treatment irrespective of LVEF. Compared with previous studies, we saw an improvement in the use of recommended HF drugs, especially beta-blockers. However, achievement of target doses could be improved.", 
    "219": "The hyperphosphorylated tau is a major protein component of neurofibrillary tangle, which is one of hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the level of methylglyoxal (MG) is significantly increased in the AD brains, the role of MG in tau phosphorylation is still not reported. Here, we found that MG could induce tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple AD-related sites in neuroblastoma 2a cells under maintaining normal cell viability. MG treatment increased the level of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and the receptor of AGEs (RAGE). Glycogen synthesis kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) and p38 MAPK were activated, whereas the level and activity of JNK, Erk1/2, cdk5, and PP2A were not altered after MG treatment. Simultaneous inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2 or p38 attenuated the MG-induced tau hyperphosphorylation. Aminoguanidine, a blocker of AGEs formation, could effectively reverse the MG-induced tau hyperphosphorylation. These data suggest that MG induces AD-like tau hyperphosphorylation through AGEs formation involving RAGE up-regulation and GSK-3\u03b2 activation and p38 activation is also partially involved in MG-induced tau hyperphosphorylation. Thus, targeting MG may be a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent AD-like tau hyperphosphorylation.", 
    "220": "The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of beta-adrenergic preconditioning (BPC). The roles of adenosine and its receptor subtypes, the generation of oxygen free radicals (ROS) and activation of the K(ATP) channels as well as the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI(3)K)/PKB/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signal transduction pathways during the triggering and mediation phases were evaluated. Using the isolated working rat heart, BPC was elicited by administration of denopamine (beta1 adrenergic receptor agonist, 10(-7)\u00a0M), isoproterenol (beta1/beta2 adrenergic receptor agonist, 10(-7)\u00a0M) or formoterol (beta2 adrenergic receptor agonist, 10(-9)\u00a0M) for 5\u00a0min followed by 5\u00a0min washout. Index ischaemia was 35\u00a0min regional ischaemia and infarct size determined using the tetrazolium method. The role of adenosine was studied using adenosine deaminase and selective antagonists as well as the PI(3)K and ERK inhibitors, wortmannin and PD98,059, bracketing the triggering and mediating phases. Involvement of ROS, PKC, the mitochondrial K(ATP) channels, release of endogenous opioids and bradykinin was studied by administration of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), bisindolylmaleimide, the K(ATP) channel blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD), naloxone or HOE140, respectively. Activation of PKB/Akt and ERKp44/p42 during triggering and reperfusion was determined by Western blot. Preconditioning with all three beta-adrenergic receptor agonists caused a reduction in infarct size and an improvement in postischaemic function. BPC preconditioning with isoproterenol, denopamine or formoterol was abolished by the adenosine A3 receptor antagonist MRS1191 during both the triggering and mediation phases. Isoproterenol-induced preconditioning (beta1/beta2 PC) was attenuated by MRS1754, an adenosine A(2B) receptor antagonist, during the triggering phase and abolished during reperfusion. The mediation phase of beta1/beta2 PC was also abolished by ZM241385, an adenosine A(2A) antagonist. The free radical scavenger NAC caused a significant attenuation of cardioprotection induced by isoproterenol when administered during both trigger and mediation phases, while being effective during the trigger phase with denopamine and during reperfusion in formoterol preconditioned hearts. The mitochondrial K(ATP) channel blocker, 5-HD, was without effect on beta1/beta2 PC during both triggering and mediation phases. BPC in rat hearts is dependent on activation of the A(3) adenosine receptors by endogenously produced adenosine and production of free radicals during the triggering and mediation phases while the A(2A) and A(2B) adenosine receptors participate mainly during reperfusion. The mitochondrial K(ATP) channels do not contribute to cardioprotection at any stage. Activation of ERK and PI3K/PKB/Akt during the triggering and reperfusion phases is associated with cardioprotection.", 
    "221": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia in the general population. AF management patterns have important implications for both the patient's quality of life and the utilisation of healthcare resources. This study aimed to investigate the management pattern of AF among cardiologists in the Greek healthcare setting.", 
    "222": "In order to construct the outpatient management model, the patient record data of 149 geographically distributed physicians were used. Data on inpatient resource utilisation were obtained from a consensus panel of AF experts.", 
    "223": "89.6% of AF patients were treated with pharmacological agents, whereas 5.2% of patients were treated with invasive methods and 5.2% received no treatment. In 59.5% of patients under pharmacological therapy, a rhythm-control strategy was implemented, whereas for the remaining 40.5% of patients a rate-control strategy was selected. Class Ic and III antiarrhythmic agents constituted the main therapeutic choices in the rhythm-control strategy, whereas -blockers and digoxin were the most frequently prescribed agents in the rate-control strategy. 89.0% of the patients on pharmacological rhythm control, 91.3% of those on pharmacological rate control, and 100.0% of patients undergoing invasive treatment received antithrombotic medication.", 
    "224": "Elimination of the rhythm disturbance and rhythm management are the dominant choices in AF management made by cardiologists in Greece. AF management requires close patient monitoring, as is reflected in the frequency of follow-up visits and laboratory tests performed, irrespective of treatment approach. Hospitalisations due to AF or related comorbidities are also common.", 
    "225": "Atrial fibrillation guidelines recommend long-term use of warfarin according to a patient's predicted risk of stroke. After acute myocardial infarction, however, combining warfarin and antiplatelet medications poses challenges.", 
    "226": "By using data from more than 69,255 patients with acute myocardial infarction who were enrolled in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry's Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With the Guidelines at 309 hospitals from July 1, 2008, to September 30, 2009, we describe the characteristics and outcomes of the population with myocardial infarction with atrial fibrillation diagnosed within 2 weeks before index myocardial infarction admission (7.1%, N=4947). Use of discharge antithrombotic therapy is described overall and across levels of predicted stroke and bleeding risks.", 
    "227": "Compared with patients without atrial fibrillation, those with atrial fibrillation before their index myocardial infarction were older and had more comorbidities and worse in-hospital outcomes. Only 32.5% of patients with atrial fibrillation were taking warfarin before their myocardial infarction admission. In these patients, use of warfarin at discharge increased with higher Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age, Diabetes, Stroke [Doubled] (CHADS(2)) risk strata (28.5%, 34.6%, and 43.5% for CHADS(2) scores 0, 1, and \u22652; P<.001) and increased in patients at low, intermediate, and high risk of bleeding (25.4%, 42.3%, and 42.1%; P=.004). Triple therapy at discharge (aspirin plus clopidogrel plus warfarin) was used in a minority of this population (14.6%).", 
    "228": "Use of warfarin at discharge in patients with atrial fibrillation is greater among those with higher stroke and bleeding risks, but despite higher-risk profiles, less than half received warfarin at discharge. These findings highlight that clarification is needed to guide choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with both atrial fibrillation and acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "229": "To prospectively evaluate patients who met standard criteria for postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), at baseline and 1-year follow-up, using standard clinical and laboratory methods to assess autonomic function.", 
    "230": "Fifty-eight patients met the study criteria (orthostatic symptoms and a heart rate increment of \u2265 30 beats/min on head-up tilt) and completed 12 months of follow-up. All patients were enrolled and completed the study from January 16, 2006, through April 15, 2009. Patients underwent standardized autonomic testing, including head-up tilt, clinical assessment, and validated questionnaires designed to determine the severity of autonomic symptoms.", 
    "231": "Patients were predominantly young females (n=49, 84%), with 20 patients (34%) reporting an antecedent viral infection before onset of symptoms. More than one-third (37%) no longer fulfilled tilt criteria for POTS on follow-up, although heart rate increment on head-up tilt did not differ significantly at 1 year (33.8 \u00b1 15.1 beats/min) compared with baseline (37.8 \u00b1 14.6 beats/min) for the entire cohort. Orthostatic symptoms improved in most patients. Autonomic dysfunction was mild as defined by a Composite Autonomic Severity Score of 3 or less in 55 patients (95%) at baseline and 48 patients (92%) at 1 year.", 
    "232": "To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study of the clinical outcomes of patients with POTS. Orthostatic symptoms improved in our patients, with more than one-third of patients no longer fulfilling tilt criteria for POTS, although the overall group change in heart rate increment was modest. Our data are in keeping with a relatively favorable prognosis in most patients with POTS."
