    "0": "One of the arguments put forward against the primary use of beta-blockers has been concern about adverse metabolic effects, such as unfavorable effects on lipids or insulin sensitivity. Another less-appreciated potential drawback is their propensity to cause weight gain in some patients. In 8 evaluable prospective randomized controlled trials that lasted >/=6 months, body weight was higher in the beta-blocker than in the control group at the end of the study. The median difference in body weight was 1.2 kg (range -0.4 to 3.5 kg). A regression analysis suggested that beta-blockers were associated with an initial weight gain during the first few months. Thereafter, no further weight gain compared with controls was apparent. There was no relationship between demographic characteristics and changes in body weight. Based on these observations, the first-line use of beta-blockers in obese hypertensive patients should be reviewed. Obesity management in overweight hypertensive patients may be more difficult in the face of beta-blocker treatment.", 
    "1": "A randomized, observer-blind, parallel-group study was carried out to compare the effect of prazosin GITS, atenolol, nifedipine SR, and enalapril on platelet aggregation, measured at a time expected to coincide with trough plasma levels of these drugs. 24 patients (age-30 to 60 yrs) with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension who completed a placebo run-in phase successfully were recruited in this study. They were randomly allocated to one of the 4 treatments: prazosin GITS 2.5 mg OD (Group 1), atenolol 50 mg OD (Group II), nifedipine SR 20 mg BD (Group III), and enalapril 5 mg OD (Group IV). All the drugs were given for 7 days, and blood samples were collected at 0 hr on day 1 (pre-treatment) and day 8 (post-treatment). Based on the dose (incremental concentrations of ADP)--response (% maximum aggregation) curve obtained, 2.5 microM/L of ADP was used to compare % inhibition of platelet aggregation among the 4 groups. We found that prazosin GITS inhibited % maximum aggregation significantly (p = 0.02) at 2.5 microM/L of ADP. Such inhibitory effect was not seen in any of the other groups. The inhibition produced by prazosin GITS differed significantly from the action of the other 3 drugs (p < 0.05). This antiplatelet effect of prazosin GITS bears more clinical relevance in view of the fact that it was seen at a time which is expected to coincide with the trough plasma levels of prazosin.", 
    "2": "Hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia are commonly encountered during paralysis in patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) and may contribute to neuromuscular manifestations. Potassium and phosphate supplements have been recommended to hasten recovery and prevent cardiopulmonary complications. However, this recommendation has not yet proven efficacious. Hyperadrenergic activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of TPP. We tested whether nonselective beta-blockers could terminate neuromuscular symptoms rapidly while reducing an intracellular shift of potassium and phosphate. We describe two patients who had an acute attack of TPP with characteristic hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia associated with low urinary potassium and phosphate excretion. After oral propranolol, 3 mg/kg, serum potassium and phosphate concentrations increased promptly in 2 hours in both patients, and there was complete amelioration of paralysis. No rebound hyperkalemia or hyperphosphatemia was detected. Given their efficacy in this pilot study, they should be considered as a first-line therapy for TPP.", 
    "3": "The aim of the study was to investigate cord blood leptin concentrations and their relationship to birth weight and gender in term pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia. Cord blood samples were obtained from 52 women, identified as having pre-eclampsia, and their newborns (31 males and 21 females) immediately after birth. Specimens were analyzed using a human leptin 125I radioimmunoassay. The relationship between leptin and anthropometrics was assessed by Spearman correlation. Differences in cord blood leptin levels between male and female infants were tested with the Mann-Whitney U test. The correlation between leptin and gender was computed using the product-moment-biseral correlation analysis for continuous and dichotomous variables. The multiple logistic regression analysis examined influences of sex, birth length, birth weight, birth weight/birth length ratio, ponderal index and maternal leptin as covariates on the fetal cord leptin level. Fetal leptin correlated positively with birth weight, length and weight/length ratio, in the total group and in the male subgroup and additionally with ponderal index in the female subgroup. Cord blood leptin concentrations in female newborns were significantly higher than in male newborns (p = 0.015), and concentrations correlated with gender (r = -0.315; p = 0.023). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed four potential independent factors influencing fetal cord leptin: gender, birth weight, birth weight/birth length ratio and maternal leptin. In conclusion, cord leptin concentrations in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia correlate positively with birth weight and gender. Leptin concentrations in female newborns are higher compared to male newborns.", 
    "4": "I. a. histamine and bradykinin caused both an activation and an inhibition of jejunal contractile activity. The inhibitory effect was preserved after blockade of muscarinic cholinoreceptors, alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, and abolished with the nicotinic cholinoceptor blockade. Metenkephalin inhibited the jejunal contractile activity after first activating it. The inhibitory effect of the peptide was preserved after blockade of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors as well as the nicotinic cholinoceptors. The data obtained suggest that the non-adrenergic inhibitory effect of metenkephalin on intestinal contractions was the result of its depressing action on motor cholinergic neurons, whereas the inhibition of intestinal contractile activity with histamine and bradykinin resulted from their activating action on cholinergic interneurons which activate non-adrenergic inhibitory neurons through nicotinic cholinoceptors.", 
    "5": "A selective and sensitive room-temperature phosphorimetric method for the direct determination of 1-naphthoxylactic acid (NA) in biological fluids is described. It is based on obtaining a phosphorescence signal from NA using TlNO3 as a heavy atom perturber and Na2SO3 as a deoxygenator without a protective medium. This technique is named non-protected room-temperature phosphorescence (NP-RTP), which allows to determine analytes in complex matrices without the need for tedious prior separation. Optimization of the operational conditions resulted in a detection limit for NA of 9.6 ng/mL according to the error propagation theory. The repeatability and standard deviation were also determined. This method was successfully applied to the determination of NA in urine and human serum.", 
    "6": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blockers are the newest class of antihypertensive drugs to be developed. No large-scale clinical trials have been performed to evaluate their efficacy alone, or in combination with other drugs. A large-scale, eight week, open-label, non-placebo-controlled, single-arm trial evaluated the efficacy, tolerability and dose-response of candesartan cilexetil, 16-32 mg once-daily, either as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy, in a diverse hypertensive population in actual practice settings. 6465 patients with high blood pressure, of whom 52% were female and 16% African American, with a mean age of 58 years, were included. 5446 patients had essential hypertension and 1014 patients had isolated systolic hypertension. In order to be included in this study, patients had either untreated or uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140-179 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90-109 mmHg inclusive at baseline), despite a variety of other antihypertensive drugs. Of the 5156 patients with essential hypertension and at least one post baseline efficacy measurement, the mean pretreatment blood pressure (BP) was 156/97 mmHg. Candesartan cilexetil monotherapy reduced mean SBP/DBP by 18.0/12.2 mmHg. Similarly, in the 964 patients with isolated systolic hypertension and at least one post baseline efficacy measurement, candesartan cilexetil monotherapy reduced SBP/DBP from 158/81 by 16.5/4.5 mmHg. Candesartan cilexetil was similarly effective when employed as add-on therapy. When added to baseline antihypertensive medication in 51% of the patients with essential hypertension not achieving BP control, additional reduction in BP was achieved regardless of the background therapy, including diuretics (17.8/11.7 mmHg) calcium antagonists (16.6/11.2 mmHg), beta-blockers (16.5/10.4 mmHg), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) (15.3/10.0 mmHg), and alpha blockers (16.4/10.4 mmHg). Likewise, when candesartan cilexetil was used as add-on therapy in patients with isolated systolic hypertension, there was a consistent further reduction of mean SBP/DBP, regardless of the background therapy. Moreover, these monotherapeutic or add-on efficacy benefits were seen regardless of age (<65 or >65 years), gender, or race. Despite the open-label design of the study which enhances efficacy owing to the placebo effect, the Ang II receptor blocker, candesartan cilexetil either alone, or as an add-on therapy, is highly effective for assisting in the control of systolic and diastolic hypertension.", 
    "7": "Hypertension has been linked to many diseases, including coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, renal failure, and stroke. Treatment involves lowering blood pressure (BP) and altering the sequelae. Medications such as beta-blockers reduce BP and prevent complications such as ventricular remodeling, endothelial impairment, and renal insufficiency. This article describes the pathophysiology of hypertension, complications, and theories of primary hypertension. Critical care nurses will learn about the pharmacodynamics and latest research on beta-blocker therapy and critical decision making for patients taking these medications.", 
    "8": "The effects of stimulating the periaqueductal gray (PAG) against the rat tail flick reflex (TFR) was not changed significantly by the microinjection of lidocaine (5%/0.5 microl) into the medial (ME) or central (CE) nuclei of the amygdala. In contrast, lidocaine into the PAG blocked the effects from the ME or CE. The microinjection of naloxone (1 microg), beta-funaltrexamine (2 microg), propranolol (1 microg), or methysergide (1 microg), but not atropine (1 microg) or mecamylamine (1 microg) into the PAG significantly reduced the effects from the CE. The effect from the ME was not altered significantly by microinjecting naloxone into the PAG. Therefore, the ME or CE are unlikely to be intermediary stations for depression of the TFR evoked by stimulating the PAG, but the PAG may be a relay station for the effects of stimulating the ME or CE. The circuitry activated from the CE, but not the ME, utilises opioid mediation in the PAG. The effect from the CE depends at least on mu-opioid, serotonergic, and probably beta-adrenergic mediation in the PAG.",

BRL37344 and CGP12177 facilitated memory, whereas SR58611A had no effect. The dose-response relationships of the beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonists were challenged with the selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist 3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1-[(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronapth-1-ylamino]-2S-2-propanol oxalate (SR59230A) or the beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist (-)propranolol. BRL 37344 appeared to act predominantly at beta(3)-adrenoceptors at low doses and at beta(2)-adrenoceptors at higher doses. Facilitation of labile into long-term storage by beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonists appears to be a class action of these drugs.", 
    "10": "The objective of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic consequences of concomitant administration of fluoxetine and carvedilol in heart failure patients. Fluoxetine (20 mg) or matching placebo was administered in a randomized, double-blind, two-period crossover study to 10 patients previously identified as extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Patients were maintained on a carvedilol dose of 25 or 50 mg bid and given fluoxetine/placebo for a minimum of 28 days. Plasma was collected over the 12-hour carvedilol dosing interval, and the concentrations of the R(+) and S(-) enantiomers of carvedilol were measured. CYP2D6 phenotype was assessed during each study period using dextromethorphan (30 mg). Changes in autonomic modulation between study periods were measured by heart rate variability in the time and frequency domains using ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Compared to placebo, fluoxetine coadministration resulted in a 77% increase in mean (+/- SD) R(+) enantiomer AUC0-12 (522 +/- 413 vs. 927 +/- 506 ng.h/mL, p = 0.01) and a nonsignificant increase in S(-) enantiomer AUC (244 +/- 185 vs. 330 +/- 179 ng.h/mL, p = 0.17). Mean apparent oral clearance for both enantiomers decreased significantly with fluoxetine administration (R(+): 10.3 +/- 7.2 vs. 4.5 +/- 2.2 mL/min/kg; S(-): 22.5 +/- 12.3 vs. 12.6 +/- 7.4 mL/min/kg; p = 0.004 and 0.03, respectively). No differences in adverse effects, blood pressure, or heart rate were noted between treatment groups, and there were no consistent changes in heart rate variability parameters. In conclusion, fluoxetine administration resulted in a stereospecific inhibition of carvedilol metabolism, with the R(+) enantiomer increasing to a greater extent than the S(-) enantiomer. However, this interaction was of little clinical significance in our sample population.",

Much of this has resulted from trials such as the CAST (Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial) and the CASH (Cardiac Arrhythmia Study Hamburg), which demonstrated the potentially lethal consequences of using class I sodium channel blockers in patients with structural heart disease. The subsequent popularity of the class III agents and recognition that they are the best available therapy has led to the popularity of amiodarone and sotalol in the treatment of arrhythmia. Although these agents can achieve good efficacy in the suppression of atrial fibrillation their use is not without problems. Sotalol requires careful patient selection due to the risk of proarrhythmia and although cardiac effects are rare with amiodarone therapy, potentially serious non-cardiac adverse effects can limit the long-term use of this agent. Although treatment guidelines have helped to clarify our current knowledge and outline appropriate clinical application of antiarrhythmic agents, the need for antiarrhythmic agents which marry efficacy with improved safety and clinical applicability is apparent.",

The purpose of our study was to investigate,whether clonidine or esmolol is more efficient to attenuate stress response due to intubation.44 patients were randomly assigned to receive either clonidine (n=22; 3 microg/kg) or esmolol (n=22; 2 mg/kg) immediately prior to a standardized induction of anaesthesia. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, epinephrine and norepinephrine plasma concentrations were measured before,during and 10 min after intubation. Blood pressure was measured invasively and cardiac output was determined by transthoracic echocardiography. Absolute values and increase of mean arterial pressure and norepinephrine plasma concentrations were significantly less in the clonidine group (p<0,05). Clonidine (3 microg/kg) is more efficient than esmolol (2 mg/kg) in blunting stress response due to endotracheal intubation.", 
    "21": "Whereas intraocular pressure is considered a major risk factor in glaucoma, growing evidence now indicates that ocular ischemia plays a major role too. By virtue of this and because many existing medications are able to interact with vasculature, altering ocular blood flow, it is essential that current and future medications for glaucoma be evaluated for their effect on ocular circulation. The authors review published papers examining the effect of topical and some systemic medications on ocular blood flow, focusing mostly on data from the human eye. The authors provide a comprehensive review on the effect of subclasses of medications (eg, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, beta-blockers, alpha-adrenergic agonists, and prostaglandin analogues on optic nerve head, and on retinal, choroidal, and retrobulbar circulation. The various claims for enhancements or reduction of ocular circulation within each class of medication are reviewed and evaluated.", 
    "22": "Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are a novel addition to the armamentarium of medical glaucoma treatment; dorzolamide has been available since 1995 and brinzolamide since 1998. They lower intraocular pressure by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase, a key enzyme for aqueous humor formation. Intraocular pressure-lowering activity of the substances appears to be the same and is similar to that of most other agents, but it does not reach the activity of the unselective beta-blocker timolol or the prostaglandin latanoprost. On concomitant treatment, additivity is reached with all other topical agents. A possible improvement of blood flow may offer an additional benefit, but its significance for the long-term outcome for human glaucoma remains to be shown. Side effects are mostly local. A more physiologic pH of brinzolamide appears to be advantageous.",

Finally, recent developments in the search for strategies to attenuate vascular oxidative stress are reviewed.", 
    "24": "Syncope in childhood is a common problem. In most children, syncope is benign, secondary to a disturbance in autonomic control of heart rate and blood pressure. It is increasingly evident that neurally mediated syncope is a heterogeneous group of conditions, necessitating a reclassification of autonomic disorders. New entities, such as postural orthostatic tachycardia and cerebral vasoconstrictive syncope, are recognized. The key to the diagnosis of syncope is a careful history. Tilt testing can be useful when the history is unclear. Unfortunately tilt test protocols vary, affecting specificity and sensitivity. The mainstay of therapy is reassurance. If symptoms are troublesome, Fludrocortisone and B-blockers remain the favored drugs. The efficacy of Midodrine and Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors is currently under review. Cardiac pacing is effective for those patients with severe episodes and demonstrated asystole.

This study was designed to determine the role of central corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and adrenergic receptors in mediating specific hemodynamic response patterns. Rats were instrumented for ascending aortic blood flow determination (cardiac output) using a pulsed Doppler system, arterial pressure measurement and for intravenous and intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of drugs. After characterizing the hemodynamic response pattern in individual rats to cocaine (5 mg/kg, i.v., 4-6 trials), selective receptor antagonists were administered icv 10 min before cocaine (5 mg/kg, i.v.). Pretreatment with the CRF antagonist alpha-helical CRF(9-41) (10 microg/5 microl, icv) prevented the decrease in cardiac output in vascular responders without altering hemodynamic responses to cocaine in mixed responders. Astressin (5 microg/5 microl, icv) exerted a similar effect in vascular responders. The alpha(2) receptor antagonist, yohimbine (3 microg/microl, icv) also prevented the decrease in cardiac output in vascular responders. Lower doses of alpha-helical CRF(9-41) (1 and 3 microg) were ineffective whereas higher doses of either CRF antagonist were lethal within 24 h. In contrast, propranolol (3 or 30 microg, icv) pretreatment enhanced the cocaine-induced decrease in cardiac output and increase in systemic vascular resistance noted in vascular responders and resulted in a decrease in cardiac output in mixed responders. We conclude that CRF and adrenoceptors in the CNS play an important role in determining the hemodynamic response pattern to cocaine. Furthermore, central beta-adrenoceptors may be responsible for the reported effects of intravenous propranolol on cocaine-induced responses.",

    "56": "Clenbuterol, a lipophilic beta2-adrenoceptor agonist, was investigated in various seizure models of experimental epilepsy. In the maximal electroshock seizure threshold test, clenbuterol (> or =4 mg/kg i.p.) increased the electroconvulsive threshold for tonic seizures in mice. In the traditional maximal electroshock seizure (MES) test in mice, ED50 values of 11 mg/kg i.p. or s.c. were determined. In both models, the beta2-receptor antagonist ICI 118.551 did not antagonize the anticonvulsant activity of clenbuterol. Combinations of clenbuterol with standard antiepileptics revealed additive anticonvulsant effects. Repeated administration of clenbuterol (5 mg/kg s.c., twice daily for 14 days) to mice did not significantly influence its anticonvulsant potency or the effectiveness of phenobarbital in the MES test. In various chemically-induced seizure tests with tonic convulsions, clenbuterol inhibited or tended to suppress the tonic phase. However, this drug was not effective in preventing clonic seizures in the pentylenetetrazol (85 mg/kg s.c.) seizure threshold test. In the rotarod ataxia test (mice), a minimal \"neurotoxic\" dose (TD50) of 41 mg/kg i.p. was determined. In unrestrained rats with chronically implanted electrodes in the dorsal hippocampus, clenbuterol (2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg i.p.) significantly reduced the duration of electrically evoked hippocampal afterdischarges. In amygdala-kindled rats, clenbuterol (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg i.p.) reduced the seizure severity to stage 3. Additional studies indicated that clenbuterol (6 mg/kg i.p.) increased the heart rate and decreased the blood pressure, but this drug did not alter the plasma level of the two tested antiepileptics phenobarbital and carbamazepine. Furthermore, in whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments on cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, clenbuterol (1-100 microM) depressed the fast sodium current in a concentration- and frequency-dependent manner. In conclusion, the anticonvulsant effects of higher doses of clenbuterol against generalized tonic-clonic and complex partial seizures seem to be related to the inhibition of voltage-dependent sodium channels and not to the modulation of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "57": "To estimate in vivo myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor concentration with sufficient precision and to reduce the experimental complexities in positron emission tomography (PET), an iterative optimal design method is applied. An initial three-injection protocol, utilising [F-18]-labelled (R)- and (S)-fluorocarazolol and unlabelled (S)-fluorocarazolol, is optimised for ligand dosages and administration times to maximise the precision of all model parameters using the D-optimal criterion. Using this experimental protocol, PET data are collected in porcine studies, and model parameters are estimated. All model parameters are identified with satisfactory precision. The in vivo myocardial beta-receptor concentration is 7.5+/-0.6 pmol x ml(-1), which corresponds to the in vitro result of 10.1+/-1.3 pmol x ml(-1). With more accurate parameter values, a simplified two-injection protocol is optimally designed, utilising only radiolabelled and unlabelled (S)-fluorocarazolol, based on a new criterion to maximise the precision of the beta-receptor concentration. This revised optimum design predicts that the in vivo beta-receptor concentration can be estimated with good precision but reduced experiment complexity.",

It was hypothesised that the reduction of myocardial betaAR density is secondary to an increase of local catecholamines in the myocardium resulting from the presynaptic dysfunction since circulating plasma catecholamines were demonstrated to be unchanged in these conditions.

We investigated the mRNA expression of the cardiac L-type Ca2+-channel subunits alpha1c, alpha2/delta1, beta1a, and beta1b/c in atrial tissue of patients with chronic atrial fibrillation compared to patients in sinus rhythm. In addition, the mRNA expression of the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 4-, beta1-, and beta2-adrenergic receptors, which are known to stimulate the L-type Ca2+-current in human atrium, was analyzed and the effect of chronic beta-blocker treatment on the mRNA expression of these receptors and of the L-type Ca2+-channel subunits was assessed. Total RNA was isolated from right atrial appendages of patients in sinus rhythm and of patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. Then, semiquantitative RT-PCR using 18S RNA as the \"housekeeping gene\" was performed. In patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, there were only mild reductions in mRNA expression of the alpha1c-subunit (-15.5 %, p = 0.13), and of the beta1-subunit isoforms a and c (-13.3 %, p = 0.14 and -16.6%, p = 0.18, respectively). However, mRNA expression of the alpha2/delta1-subunit (-31.5 %, p < 0.01) and of the beta1-subunit isoform b (-39.9 %, p < 0.0005) was significantly reduced in patients with chronic AF. Taken together, the mRNA expression of the beta1-subunit isoforms b and c, which are splice variants, was significantly down-regulated by 26.5 % (p < 0.05) in these patients. The analysis of the beta1c/beta1b ratio resulted in a significant shift by 39.2 % (p < 0.0001) in favor of beta1c in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. In the AF patients, the abundance of the 5-HT4-receptor transcript was significantly reduced by 36 % (p < 0.05). The beta-adrenoreceptor transcription was unchanged. In both SR and AF patients, chronic beta-blocker treatment did neither significantly effect the mRNA expression of the L-type Ca2+-channel subunits, the beta-adrenoreceptor subtypes 1 and 2, nor that of the 5-HT4-receptor. Our data show that chronic AF is associated with a decrease in the atrial mRNA amount of auxiliary subunits of the L-type Ca2+-channel and of the 5-HT4-receptor. This supports the hypothesis that the observed alterations in mRNA transcription in AF patients may lead to a decrease in the availability of functional L-type Ca2+-channels and 5-HT4-receptors and/or reduce L-type Ca2+-current amplitude and density, thus, promoting and stabilizing the arrhythmia.",

    "101": "Cardiogenic shock is a frequent and threatening complication in the course of acute myocardial infarction. Besides the well known causes (left ventricular failure, acquired interventricular defect, papillary muscle rupture, free wall rupture) other less frequent mechanisms recognize a functional substrate. The recognition of such mechanisms makes us to revert to the treatments with completely different prognostic implications. In our Coronary Care Unit we encountered, in a period of 12 months, 4 patients who presented clinical, electrocardiographic and/or echographic signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction, with different degrees of heart failure up to cardiogenic shock. Only 1 patient showed a severe stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery and a significant creatine kinase reduction. Left ventriculography, performed at admission, was unable to disclose the true mechanism of clinical presentation. Only a thorough echographic examination disclosed the presence of a dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction as the cause of heart failure culminating in cardiogenic shock. Once recognized, pathophysiological treatment (administration of beta-blockers and withdrawal of vasodilators, inotropic drugs and intra-aortic balloon pump) led to a dramatic improvement, with an almost complete left ventricular function recovery. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is a mechanism that can lead to severe heart failure as a complication of an acute myocardial infarction. Conversely such a mechanism can be precipitated by other causes (hypotension, hypovolemia, especially in hypertensive patients) and can mimic an acute myocardial infarction. Its incidence is not negligible: in our Coronary Care Unit it accounted for about 15% of all cases of myocardial infarction requiring inotropic support.

The need of time enough to the adaptation of the cardiovascular system against the carvedilol pharmacodynamics, together with the need of slow, progressive dose titration, caused that the onset of therapy with carvedilol was separated from assessment of its effects on ergometric and spectral parameters by an interval period of 3 months.",

Again during scopolamine, the total variance, LF and HF powers exhibited the values reported as follows: 1255 msec2 and, respectively, 430 and 250 msec2, thus exceeding significantly the basal levels (p < 0.05 from comparison with total power, p < 0.01 from comparisons with LF and HF bands) as well as the levels reached during adrenergic blockade with carvedilol (LF scopolamine vs LF carvedilol: p < 0.01; total power and HF scopolamine vs corrispective carvedilol values p < 0.05). Compared to the basal findings, the carvedilol induced a significant reduction in VO2max (p < 0.05), double product (p < 0.01), peack of heart rate (p < 0.05) and LF power (p < 0.05), and elicited no significant decreases in exercise time; similarly a weak, not significant surge was product by carvedilol in total and HF powers.",

    "125": "Little information is available on how acute ischemia modifies the electrophysiologic substrate associated with long Q-T interval conditions. We studied the effects of low-flow ischemia (10 min at 5.0 ml/min followed by 10 min of 2.5 ml/min) in Langendorff perfused rabbit hearts during control and in hearts 20 min after the addition to the perfusate of 92 microM d-sotalol, which reliably produced triggered activity. Epicardial electrograms, a left ventricular endocardial monophasic action potential (MAP), and simulated X and Y lead electrocardiograms were used to characterize myocardial activation and recovery during ventricular pacing. In the control hearts, conduction velocity as indicated by the mean epicardial activation time accelerated for most of the period of ischemia (maximum decrease of -9.4 +/- 7.9%). The mean activation-recovery interval, MAP duration, and Q-T interval were moderately decreased (-4.9 +/- 8.6%, -7.5 +/- 4.4%, and -4.6 +/- 2.3%, respectively). The mean standard deviation of the activation-recovery interval (epicardial heterogeneity of recovery) was increased by 34.6 +/- 23.4%. d-Sotalol had no effect on conduction but prolonged myocardial recovery time, increased heterogeneity, and produced triggered arrhythmias in all hearts. Within 2 min of ischemia triggered activity was eliminated. With d-sotalol, ischemia slowed conduction and produced relatively larger decreases in the activation-recovery interval, MAP duration, and Q-T interval (-11.8 +/- 10.3%, -13.9 +/- 12.0%, and -15.8 +/- 11.2%). The increased epicardial heterogeneity seen with d-sotalol was attenuated by ischemia. Thus ischemia superimposed on long Q-T conditions had antiarrhythmic as well as arrhythmogenic effects.", 
    "126": "Adsorption isotherm data were acquired at different eluent pH values for the enantiomers of several beta-blockers on cellobiohydrolase I on silica gel. They fit well to the biLangmuir model, allowing the determination of the equilibrium constants and the monolayer capacities for chiral and nonselective adsorption. The adsorption of the S-enantiomers (eluted second) is exothermic at low pH, endothermic at high pH, and athermal in a narrow pH range depending on the beta-blocker. This transition pH range is lower for S-alprenolol than for the more hydrophobic S-propranolol, although their endothermic adsorption originates from hydrophobic interactions. This surprising observation is explained by the relative values of the isotherm coefficients. S-Alprenolol seems to have a more pronounced endothermic behavior than S-propranolol because the nonselective interactions of both compounds with the stationary phase are exothermic but their contribution to retention, relative to that of the endothermic chiral interactions, is less important for alprenolol. The order of increasing energy of the chiral interactions is the same as that of hydrophobicity, propranolol>alprenolol>metoprolol.", 
    "127": "We previously reported that the spillover of interleukin-6 (IL-6) into the peripheral circulation increases with the severity of congestive heart failure (CHF), and that the increase is mainly associated with activation of the endogenous sympathetic nervous system. However, the role of the sympathetic nervous system in the increase of IL-6 in CHF patients is not yet fully understood. To address this question, we measured plasma IL-6 levels before and after therapeutic administration of dopamine and betablockers in patients with CHF. After more than 24 h (mean, 34 h) of treatment with a low dose of intravenous dopamine (mean, 2.4 microg/kg/min) in 1 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and deterioration of CHF, the plasma IL-6 level was increased significantly (30.8 vs. 16.6 pg/ml; p = 0.003) despite the improved hemodynamics. After 377 days of beta-blocker therapy in 24 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, the plasma IL-6 level was decreased significantly (2.04 vs. 3.11 pg/ml; p = 0.01) along with the improvement of symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction, and neurohumoral factors. Dopamine increases and beta-blockers decrease the plasma IL-6 level in patients with CHF, suggesting that drugs modulating the sympathetic nervous system may alter IL-6 in these patients.", 
    "128": "To clarify the pathophysiological mechanism of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). the responses of heart rate and the plasma cyclic AMP (cAMP) level to isoproterenol infusion in the supine position were evaluated in 10 POTS patients and 10 age-matched controls. Also, the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on POTS was assessed using the headup tilt test. The POTS patients consisted of two men and eight women, with a mean age of 19.7 years (range. 15-28 years). An exaggerated increase of both heart rate and the plasma cAMP concentration after isoproterenol infusion at a low dose (1 microg/min) was observed in the POTS patients, but not in control subjects. Seven POTS patients received oral beta-blocker therapy. In five of these, symptoms were abolished and there was a smaller heart rate increase during the head-up tilt test. These data suggest that POTS may be more prevalent in young women and that beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity may play a role in the mechanisms of this syndrome. However, a larger series of patients need to be studied in the future.", 
    "129": "To clarify the role of the natriuretic peptide (NP) system in the myocardial protective effects of carvedilol, a beta-blocking agent, we investigated the effects of carvedilol on the NP system in the rat heart. After oral administration of carvedilol (low-dose group: 2 mg/kg/day, group C2; high-dose group: 20 mg/kg/day, group C20) for 1 week, plasma rat atrial NP (r-ANP), atrial mRNA levels of ANP, left ventricular mRNA of brain NP (BNP), NP receptor-A and NP receptor-C (NPR-C) (as a clearance receptor) were measured. Values were compared with those in vehicle-treatment rats (group V). The concentration of r-ANP was significantly higher in group C2 (135 +/- 9 pg/ml) and group C20 (161 +/- 11 pg/ml) than group V (75 +/- 6 pg/ml; both p < 0.01). ANP and BNP mRNA levels were significantly increased and NPR-C was significantly down regulated in group C2 (151 +/- 7, 120 +/- 8 and 78 +/- 7%, respectively, vs. group V) and group C20 (164 +/- 8. 133 +/- 7 and 72 +/- 8%, respectively, vs. group V) compared with group V (all p < 0.01). These results suggest that not only a high dose, but a low dose of carvedilol has the effect of increasing plasma ANP and BNP levels. This effect was closely related to the upregulation of ANP and BNP mRNA expression, and the down regulation of NPR-C mRNA expression in the heart. These mechanisms seem to account for a sizable portion of the protective effect of carvedilol for heart diseases.",

This post hoc subanalysis assessed the efficacy and safety of sildenafil in men with ED who were receiving concomitant antihypertensive medication. Efficacy was assessed in 3414 men (1218 of whom were taking antihypertensive medication) who received sildenafil (5 to 200 mg) or placebo for 6 weeks to 6 months in 10 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The significant improvements in erectile function demonstrated by sildenafil-treated patients were comparable in patients taking and those not taking antihypertensive medication. Safety was assessed in 3975 men (1094 of whom were taking one or more antihypertensive agent, classified as a diuretic, beta-blocker, alpha1-blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, or calcium channel blocker), who received sildenafil or placebo in 18 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. For patients taking sildenafil and antihypertensive medication, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (34%) was similar to that for sildenafil-treated patients not taking any antihypertensive agent (38%). The incidences of the most common adverse events and of adverse events potentially related to blood pressure decreases (eg, hypotension, dizziness, and syncope) were similar in both sildenafil groups. The number of antihypertensive medications taken from among the five classes had no effect on the adverse event profile of sildenafil. Sildenafil is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for ED in patients taking concomitant antihypertensive medication, including those on multidrug regimens.", 
    "131": "The aim of this study was to compare the effect of antihypertensive treatment with valsartan or cavedilol on sexual activity in hypertensive men who were never treated for hypertension. A total of 160 newly diagnosed hypertensive men (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] > or = 95 mm Hg and < 110 mm Hg), aged 40 to 49 years, all married and without any previous sexual disfunction, were enrolled. After a 4-week placebo period, the patients were divided into two groups: a) 120 patients were randomized to receive carvedilol 50 mg once daily or valsartan 80 mg once daily for 16 weeks according to a double-blind, cross-over design; after another 4-week placebo period, patients were crossed over to the alternative regimen for a further 16 weeks; b) 40 patients were treated with placebo according to a single-blind design for 16 weeks. At the screening visit and every 4 weeks thereafter, blood pressure (BP) was evaluated and patients were interviewed by a questionnaire about their sexual activity. Blood pressure was significantly lowered by both treatments, with a 48% of normalization with valsartan and 45% with carvedilol. During the first month of therapy, sexual activity (assessed as number of sexual intercourse episodes per month) declined with both drugs as compared with baseline, although the decrease was statistically significant in the carvedilol (from 8.2 to 4.4 sexual intercourse episodes, P < .01) but not in the valsartan-treated patients (from 8.3 to 6.6 sexual intercourse episodes, not significant). Ongoing with the treatment the sexual activity further worsened with carvedilol (3.7 sexual intercourse episodes per month) while fully recovered and also improved with valsartan (10.2 sexual intercourse episodes per month). The results were confirmed by the cross-over. Erectile dysfunction was a complaint of 15 patients with carvedilol (13.5%), one patient with valsartan (0.9%), and one patient in the placebo group. These findings suggest that carvedilol induces a chronic worsening of sexual activity, whereas valsartan not only does not significantly worsen sexual activity but may even improve it.",

    "136": "The therapeutic effect of anti-ischemic compounds is related to their ability to improve the oxygen supply-demand balance of the ischemic myocardium by increasing myocardial blood flow (calcium-antagonists), by reducing regional myocardial oxygen consumption (verapamil, betablockers) and increasing peripheral pooling of blood (nitrates, nifedipine). All these actions are also accompanied by hemodynamic changes, as evidenced by a lower double product, reduced wall stress, lower pulmonary wedge pressure, and lower systemic arterial pressure. In general, it was found that the combination of a betablocker with nifedipine improved the antianginal effect by further reducing the number and duration of ischemic events. The combination of a nitrate with a beta-blocker is particularly useful because it reduces the risk of heart failure by lowering left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume and by attenuating the negative inotropic effect of the betablocker. Although a combination therapy demonstrated benefits in comparison with drug treatment alone, it is associated with a higher incidence of untoward events. Trimetazidine (2, 3, 4 trimethoxybenzyl-piperazine dihydrochloride) is a novel anti-ischemic compound with a peculiar mechanism of action. Its anti-ischemic properties are unrelated to changes in myocardial oxygen supply-to-demand ratio, as shown by no significant effects on heart rate, blood pressure or rate-pressure product both at rest and during dynamic exercise. There are several possible mechanisms of action by which trimetazidine promotes preservation of membrane structures and cellular function: limitation of intracellular acidosis, correction of disturbances of transmembrane ion exchange leading to calcium overload, prevention of an excessive production of free radicals, inhibition of the inflammatory reaction and an antiplatelet effect. These documented actions cooperate to increase the rate of resynthesis of high-energy phosphates within myocardial cells after episodes of ischemia. In several trials, trimetazidine has been tested as an antianginal agent, both as monotherapy and combined with \"classical\" anti-ischemic compounds. In comparison with nifedipine, trimetazidine had similar efficacy in reducing the number of weekly anginal attacks and in increasing the ischemic threshold in a group of 39 patients with stable angina. However, the incidence of side effects was significantly higher with nifedipine (5 vs 20), and affected 5 patients with trimetazidine and 13 patients with nifedipine (p = 0.03). In a relatively large European study involving 149 patients (Trimetazidine European Multicenter Study, TEMS), trimetazidine (20 mg t.i.d.) was compared with propranolol (40 mg t.i.d.) in patients with stable angina pectoris and documented significant coronary artery stenoses. The number of anginal attacks was reduced equally by both drugs and exercise duration was increased by both treatments. However, in contrast with propranolol trimetazidine did not alter the rate pressure product. In patients already treated with nifedipine or beta-blockers, the addition of trimetazidine (20 mg t.i.d.) was able to reduce the number and the duration of anginal attacks and improved also the exercise capacity. Trimetazidine is generally well tolerated and only minor side effects have been reported (drowsiness, sedation, diarrhea). The improvement in cardiac energy metabolism should theoretically translate into enhancement in mechanical efficiency. This hypothesis has been object of recent investigations in patients with ischemic heart disease with and without left ventricular dysfunction. Brottier, et al. demonstrated that patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy treated with trimetazidine had a higher ejection fraction (measured by radionuclide angiography) than control patients who received a placebo after 6 months of therapy (p < 0.018). The group of Chierchia demonstrated that trimetazidine improved ischemic regional myocardial dysfunction at rest and during stress-induced ischemia in 15 patients with chronic coronary artery disease without affecting the hemodynamic determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption. There is recent demonstration that trimetazidine improves the contractile response of left ventricular hibernating myocardium in patients with ischemic heart disease. Belardinelli et al. showed that trimetazidine improved the contractile response of dysfunctional myocardial to low-dose dobutamine in patients with ischemic heart disease and left ventricular function. Twenty-two patients with prior anterior myocardial infarction and injection fraction < 35% (33 +/- 7%) were randomized into 2 groups. A group (= 11) received trimetazidine (20 mg tid) for 2 months, while another group (= 11) received a placebo. The usual medications were not altered during the study. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)", 
    "137": "Renal drug elimination is determined by glomerular filtration, tubular secretion, and tubular reabsorption. Changes in the integrity of these processes influence renal drug clearance, and these changes may not be detected by conventional measures of renal function such as creatinine clearance. The aim of the current study was to examine the analytic issues needed to develop a cocktail of marker drugs (fluconazole, rac-pindolol, para-aminohippuric acid, sinistrin) to measure simultaneously the mechanisms contributing to renal clearance. High-performance liquid chromatographic methods of analysis for fluconazole, pindolol, para-aminohippuric acid, and creatinine and an enzymatic assay for sinistrin were developed or modified and then validated to allow determination of each of the compounds in both plasma and urine in the presence of all other marker drugs. A pilot clinical study in one volunteer was conducted to ensure that the assays were suitable for quantitating all the marker drugs to the sensitivity and specificity needed to allow accurate determination of individual renal clearances. The performance of all assays (plasma and urine) complied with published validation criteria. All standard curves displayed linearity over the concentration ranges required, with coefficients of correlation greater than 0.99. The precision of the interday and intraday variabilities of quality controls for each marker in plasma and urine were all less than 11.9% for each marker. Recoveries of markers (and internal standards) in plasma and urine were all at least 90%. All markers investigated were shown to be stable when plasma or urine was frozen and thawed. For all the assays developed, there were no interferences from other markers or endogenous substances. In a pilot clinical study, concentrations of all markers could be accurately and reproducibly determined for a sufficient duration of time after administration to calculate accurate renal clearance for each marker. This article presents details of the analytic techniques developed for measuring concentrations of marker drugs for different renal elimination processes administered as a single dose to define the processes contributing to renal drug elimination.",

There have been suggestions of possible involvement of ZEA in the progression of breast malignancies and tumors of the female reproductive tract in humans. The toxic or stimulatory effects of ZEA and its metabolites alpha-zearalenol and 17-beta-estradiol on SKN, HHUAand HepG2 cells were studied using rapid colorimetric MTT assay. In general, both concentrations of 17-beta-estradiol (100M and 10 nM) were toxic to SKN and HHUA cell cultures. Both ZEA and alpha-zearalenol stimulated the proliferation of SKN and HHUA cells. On HepG2 cells, lower concentrations (10 nM) of 17-beta-estradiol and higher concentrations (100 microM) of ZEA exhibited toxic effects, whereas treatment with higher concentrations of 17-beta-estradiol and lower concentration of ZEA did not show toxic effects. A dose dependent antagonistic effect was observed when the cell cultures were pre-incubated with ICI 182,780, a synthetic estrogen receptor blocker, before estradiol or mycotoxin treatments.", 
    "140": "In cardiac ventricle, the density of the transient outward potassium current, Ito, is clearly related to sympathetic nervous system integrity. This sympathetic regulation of Ito expression may be greatly significant to the genesis of cardiac complications of several diseases such us diabetes mellitus. Autonomic neuropathy, including cardiac neuropathy, is a complication of chronic diabetes. The objective of the present study was to identify the possible role of cardiac sympathetic neuropathy in the reduction of Ito current density in diabetic ventricular myocardium. Thus, we employed the patch-clamp technique to test whether Ito can be restored in diabetic myocytes incubated with norepinephrine. We also measured, using HPLC, the catecholamine content of the stellate ganglion, which is responsible for cardiac sympathetic innervation, in normal and diabetic animals. The main result of the present study was to show that a 24-h incubation of diabetic cells with norepinephrine restores Ito density to control values. The restoration of Ito current density by norepinephrine suggests that the diabetes-induced reduction of Ito is at least partially attributable to a reduced trophic effect of norepinephrine on the expression of Ito.", 
    "141": "Cirrhosis can be the end stage of any chronic liver disease. At the time of diagnosis of cirrhosis varices are present in about 60% of decompensated and 30% of compensated patients. The risk factors for the first episode of variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients are the severity of liver dysfunction, large size of varices and the presence of endoscopic red colour signs but only one-third of patients who have variceal haemorrhage have the above risk factors. Recent interest has been directed at identifying haemodynamic factors that may reflect the pathophysiological changes which lead to variceal bleeding, e.g. it has been confirmed that no bleeding occurs if HVPG falls below 12 mmHg and also a hypothesis has been put forward in which bacterial infection is considered a trigger for bleeding. Pharmacological treatment with beta-blockers is safe, effective and is the standard long-term treatment for the prevention of recurrence of variceal bleeding. Combination of beta-blockers with isosorbide-5-mononitrate needs further testing in randomized controlled trials. The use of haemodynamic targets for reduction in HVPG response needs further study, and surrogate markers of pressure response need evaluation. If endoscopic treatment is chosen, variceal ligation is the modality of choice. The combination of simultaneous variceal ligation and sclerotherapy does not offer any benefit. However, the use of additional sclerotherapy for the complete eradication of small varices after variceal ligation needs to be evaluated. The results of current prospective randomized controlled trials comparing variceal ligation with pharmacological treatment are awaited with great interest. Finally, the use of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) for the secondary prevention of variceal bleeding is not substantiated by current data, as survival is not improved and because of its worse cost-benefit profile compared to other treatments. In contrast, there still is a role for the selective surgical shunts in the modern management of portal hypertension. The ideal patients should be well compensated cirrhotics, who have had troublesome bleeding - either who have failed at least one other modality of therapy (drugs or ligation), have bled from gastric varices despite medical or endoscopic therapy, or live far from suitable medical services. Recently, ligation has been compared to beta-blockers for primary prophylaxis but so far there is no good evidence to recommend banding for primary prophylaxis, if beta-blockers can be given.",

However, it is not known whether, independent of effects on plasma concentration, the extent to which quinidine prolongs the QT interval also is modulated by changes in endogenous sympathetic activity.", 
    "144": "In these studies, we evaluated quinidine concentration-QT relations during low-salt (10 mEq/day for 8 days) and high-salt (400 mEq/day for 8 days) diets, with or without beta blockade in normal volunteers. In the absence of beta blockade, the concentration producing a fixed (15%) increase in QTc was significantly lower with salt restriction: 1.2 +/- 0.4 microg/mL (low salt) versus 2.2 +/- 0.4 microg/mL (high salt) (P < 0.01). With beta blockade, this difference was abolished: 1.9 +/- 0.3 microg/mL (low salt + beta blockade) versus 2.1 +/- 0.3 microg/mL (high salt + beta blockade). QT morphologic abnormalities including bifid T waves and U waves were abolished with beta-adrenergic blockade.",

The results showed that the slope (-1.70 +/- 0.45 vs -1.22 +/- 0.21; P < 0.05) and the intercept (5.11 +/- 0.46 vs 5.62 +/- 0.24; P < 0.05) of the regression line of power-law behavior and the short-term DFA (for 4 to 11 beats) (0.78 +/- 0.18 vs 1.13 +/- 0.21; P < 0.05) increased after 3 months of atenolol treatment. However, the change in intermediate-term DFA (>11 beats) and ApEn was not apparent (1.24 +/- 0.21 vs 1.22 +/- 0.15 and 1.34 +/- 0.14 vs 1.36 +/- 0.11; both P > 0.05).

    "149": "Recent findings on the use of beta-adrenergic blockers in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) are reviewed. CHF is a progressive, debilitating disease that afflicts 4.6 million patients in the United States. Treatment has traditionally consisted of a diuretic, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and digoxin. Despite advances in ACE-inhibitor therapy, the five-year mortality rate remains nearly 50%. Overstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system is believed to contribute to mortality. Beta-blockers have recently been added to the standard of care for patients with New York Heart Association functional class II or III heart failure. Four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials were recently completed that addressed the benefits of beta-blockers in CHF. The overall mortality rate was reduced 65% by carvedilol, 34% by metoprolol, and 33% by bisoprolol; all these reductions were significant compared with placebo, and the trials were ended early. Bucindolol, however, did not have a significant effect on mortality. These drugs are hepatically metabolized and may require dosage adjustment in hepatically impaired patients. Decompensation of heart failure is another consideration; a beta-blocker should be added only for patients with stable CHF. Dosages must be slowly adjusted to targeted levels. Adverse effects do not differ significantly among beta-blockers. In addition to their effect on mortality, beta-blockers reduce CHF-related morbidity, such as all-cause hospitalization. Carvedilol, metoprolol, and bisoprolol decrease the mortality and morbidity associated with CHF and can be used with limited adverse effects. The choice among these agents does not affect clinical outcomes; bucindolol, however, has proven ineffective.",

Variability of heart rate and systolic blood pressure was assessed by Fast Fourier Transform, and spontaneous baroreceptor gain by temporal sequences slope and alpha index. Modelflow was used to quantify hemodynamics. All patients improved greatly after medication. The autonomic and hemodynamic impairment observed in patients with POTS, particularly after orthostatic stress, is treated effectively with bisoprolol and/or fludrocortisone. These results need further confirmation in a controlled double-blind study.",

    "153": "We reported in a previous study that beta-adrenoceptor blockers inhibit the Mg2+-dependent ATP-hydrolytic function of Na+/K+-ATPase. To determine if this action is a result of binding of beta-blockers to the receptor sites that bind the digitalis glycosides, we performed displacement binding assays of eight beta-blockers with [3H]-ouabain (OUA) in guinea pig myocardial microsomal preparations. In the first series of experiments, 10-200 microM of the beta-blockers were displaced with 250 nM OUA. In the second set of experiments, 10-500 nM of OUA was displaced using 200 microM of the beta-blockers. The drugs showed concentration-dependent receptor occupancy at the different OUA levels. Propranolol (PPN), metoprolol (MTP), and sotalol (STL) showed the strongest binding; nadolol (NDL), indenolol (IDN), and atenolol (ATN) had intermediate binding; carazolol (CRZ) and celiprolol (CLP) had the weakest binding properties. The results suggest that beta-blockers may compete for the same binding sites with ouabain in their inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase. These actions may contribute to the mechanism for some of their cardiac effects, especially their proarrhythmic and arrhythmogenic actions.",

    "155": "The stretched diameter of the ASD was measured by inflating a sizing balloon within the defect until an indentation in the circumference in the balloon could be observed. An ASO with a stent diameter 2-4 mm larger than the indentation in the circumference of the balloon was chosen and implanted via 9-12 French sheaths. In contrast to the closure of smaller defects, pullback of the device onto the atrial septum was only performed when the connecting stent of the ASO was completely deployed in order to achieve maximal centering characteristics and optimal support of the retention skirt of the left atrial disc on the edges of the defect. Only then was the right atrial disc deployed and actively configured by advancing the sheath and the delivery cable against the atrial septum. Implantation was only attempted if the atrial septal rims (except the anterior rim around the aorta) measured more than 7 mm by echocardiography to avoid injury or disturbance of sensitive intracardiac structures. After placement, the fixation of the device and the mechanical stability was proven by an extensive \"Minnesota wiggle\". The ASO was released only when TEE showed no or a trivial residual color flow through the connecting stent; otherwise repositioning was performed.", 
    "156": "Out of 352 patients (P) with successful closure of interatrial defects, 70 P (age: 1.1-77.3 years) had stretched defects larger than 20 mm diameter (median 22 mm diameter (20-36), 25/75% quartiles = 20/26 mm). Mean shunt size was Qp:Qs 2.1:1 (0.7-3.9:1), mean fluoroscopy time 10.9 min (0-63). Complete closure could be achieved in 85.7/93.1/100% after 3 months, 1 and 2 years, respectively. Besides 3 P with persistent atrial fibrillation, only 5 P showed transient atrial tachyarrhythmias, 2 only periprocedural and 3 within the first 3 months after implantation were treated with beta-blocker. In one patient, an acute embolization of the device occurred because a diminished posterior rim was not visualized by a monoplane TEE probe necessitating surgical explantation and defect occlusion. Despite oversizing the device, no \"mushrooming\" misconfiguration were observed.",

    "158": "Hypertension has a high prevalence among elderly patients. Randomised trials have already demonstrated that treating healthy older persons with hypertension is highly efficacious. Nevertheless some questions have arisen. On the one hand the generalizability of these trial results, particularly for older persons with serious medical comorbidities and poor functional status, is not clear. On the other hand different antihypertensive drugs have shown to be effective. Which drug for which patient? Even data from randomised intervention trials showing that the treatment affects cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, were missing, ACE inhibitors have been used for more than a decade to treat high blood pressure. For a younger population the captopril prevention project showed no differences between ACE inhibitors and conventional antihypertensive treatment (diuretics, beta-blocker) concerning the primary endpoints (myocardial infarction, stroke and other cardiovascular death). The STOP-2 study also confirmed these results for elderly patients. When treating elderly patients one must be aware of physiological changes with age and the comorbidities. Of significance among this patient group is declining renal function. Admissions for uraemia that are related to the use of ACE inhibitors are still commonplace, although many cases are preventable by monitoring renal function, but guidelines are still missing. Concerning the comorbidities ACE inhibitors have benefits compared to other antihypertensive drugs, especially in cases of heart failure, diabetes and coronary heart disease.", 
    "159": "Hypertension increases in prevalence with age. Population based studies suggest that more than 50% of people over the age of 65 years may have chronic hypertension. Hypertension, especially systolic hypertension, is the single most common, powerful, however, treatable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the elderly. In order to assess the effectiveness of antihypertensive drug therapy among the elderly, with diuretics, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, a literature search was performed at the Cochrane Library, Medline and Excerpta medica. The Cochrane Hypertension Group identified 14 randomised controlled trials of at least one year duration with 21,785 elderly subjects where diuretics, beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers were used in the treatment group as first line drugs. In their meta-analysis (including one small trial with a central acting antiadrenergic drug) there was a decrease in total mortality (111 vs 129 deaths) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (126 vs 177 events) within the treatment group. The three trials restricted to persons with isolated systolic hypertension indicated beneficial effects in the treatment group with regard to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (104 vs 157 events). Trial data on adverse effects is limited. In three studies, where adverse effects were reported, no substantial differences between treatment and control groups in measures of physical, cognitive and emotional function were found. Cardiovascular benefits of treatment with low dose diuretics or beta-blockers are cleared for elderly subjects with either diastolic or isolated systolic hypertension. Treatment with a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker shows beneficial effects in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for elderly people with isolated systolic hypertension. Due to inconsistent findings in a subgroup meta-analysis of antihypertensive drug treatment in very old people, the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment in these subjects still remains unclear.", 
    "160": "Following a stimulation with acetylcholine, the beta-adrenergic agonists adrenaline (A), noradrenaline (NA), isoproterenol (Iso) and salbutamol (Sal) induced a concentration-dependent decrease in the tone and (or) rate of amnion contraction with EC50 ISO < NA < A < Sal. Metaprolol, a specific beta 1-antagonist, induced a rightward shift in the dose-response curves of Iso, NA and A, whereas beta-antagonist butoxamine was ineffective. pA2 values for beta-antagonists were propranolol 8.3, metoprolol 7.0, butoxamine 5.6. EC50 values of alpha-adrenergic agonists form a sequence: clonidine < NA < methoxamine < phenylephrine. Specific alpha-antagonists yohimbine and idazoxan were found to antagonise competitively the effects of NA. The data obtained characterize the adrenergic receptors mediating stimulation of amniotic contractile activity as alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. Inhibition of contractile receptors in amnion is mainly mediated by beta 1-adrenergic receptor activation.", 
    "161": "The nonselective beta-blocker timolol and the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor dorzolamide both lower intraocular pressure (IOP). Timolol and dorzolamide have different mechanisms of action and their effects are additive when administered together. Therefore, the 2 drugs are frequently used concomitantly to treat patients with open-angle glaucoma who have not adequately responded to first-line therapy. A barrier to good compliance with concomitant therapy is the need to administer 5 or 6 drops of medication on 2 or 4 occasions during the day. Timolol 0.5% and dorzolamide 2.0% have therefore been combined in a single formulation, reducing the number of administrations required to 2 per day. Clinical trials in patients with glaucoma have demonstrated that dorzolamide 2%/timolol 0.5% (dorzolamide/timolol) is superior to monotherapy with the individual components. When dorzolamide/timolol administered twice daily was compared with concomitant treatment with dorzolamide 2% and timolol 0.5%, each administered twice daily for 90 days, both regimens resulted in marked lowering of trough IOP (measured just before the morning dose) compared with baseline (reduction in IOP = 4.2mm Hg). The effect of the 2 regimens on IOP at all time points, both before treatment and at peak effect (2 hours after treatment), were virtually indistinguishable. When the combined formulation was compared with a concomitant regimen that included dorzolamide 2% 3 times daily and timolol 0.5% twice daily the concomitant regimen was slightly more efficacious than the combined regimen at trough after 90 days: IOP was lowered by 3.6mm Hg in the combined group versus 4.1 mm Hg in the concomitant group. Dorzolamide/timolol has been compared with concomitant administration of timolol 0.5% and the IOP lowering miotic drug, pilocarpine 2.0%. This non-blind patient-preference study found that both regimens reduced IOP. However, the dorzolamide/timolol combination was preferred by the patients because of reduced frequency and severity of adverse effects and less frequent administration. Dorzolamide/timolol was well tolerated in clinical trials, the adverse effects reflected those of the individual components, and no additional tolerability issues were identified. However, the potential for timolol to cause cardiorespiratory effects must be considered when prescribing this combination. Furthermore, dorzolamide is a sulfonamide and can cause allergic reactions in those who are hypersensitive to this class of drug.", 
    "162": "Dorzolamide/timolol is a well tolerated and effective fixed combination for lowering IOP in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma and is likely to be useful in those patients who do not respond adequately to first-line monotherapy. Compared with concomitant therapy with the same 2 drugs the primary advantage is convenience, which may lead to improved compliance. Studies of compliance and comparisons with other currently available combination therapies would be useful to fully define the value of the formulation. Nonetheless, dorzolamide combined with timolol in a single applicator system will be a useful addition to the treatment options for glaucoma, a leading cause of preventable blindness.",

    "164": "In a controlled trial, the beta-adrenoceptor/5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A) receptor antagonist pindolol accelerated and enhanced the antidepressant effect of fluoxetine. The median times to sustained response (> or = 50% reduction of baseline severity maintained until endpoint) were 19 days for fluoxetine plus pindolol (N = 55) and 29 days for fluoxetine plus placebo (N = 56) (p = 0.01). The response rate at endpoint was 16% greater in patients treated with the combination. The plasma concentration of pindolol remained stable between 3 days (first blood sampling) and 6 weeks. Mean values were approximately 26 nM, a concentration higher than the Ki of (-)pindolol for human 5-HT1A autoreceptors (11 nM). Plasma fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentrations increased steadily until the fourth week of treatment. Fluoxetine concentrations were lower in patients receiving the combination (p = 0.043), but there was no significant relationship to the clinical response in either group. A reanalysis of the data using a survival analysis revealed that significant differences in the time to sustained response between both groups would have also been detected (1) in a 2-week trial, (2) without a placebo lead-in phase, and (3) with less frequent visits. However, the use of \"response\" instead of \"sustained response\" as measure of clinically relevant change would have greatly diminished the difference between treatment arms (p = 0.08 instead of p = 0.01). This emphasizes the need of using stringent outcome criteria in antidepressant drug trials. A comparison of the data of all sustained responders (N = 27) in the fluoxetine-plus-placebo group with the first 27 responders in the fluoxetine-plus-pindolol group (of a total of 38) revealed a highly significant difference in the time to sustained response (18 and 10 days, respectively; p = 0.0002). This indicates that the faster response in the fluoxetine-plus-pindolol group is not a result of the greater proportion of responders.",

We analysed the effect of the nature of the crosslinker and the degree of crosslinking on drug permeation through porcine skin by means of the permeation parameters obtained from the gels and the corresponding aqueous solution. The gels showed greater drug permeation than the liquid solution due to an increase in drug solubility in the skin.

    "180": "Intraocular pressure was reduced significantly on both treated and fellow eyes after timolol (p = 0.003, p = 0.04 respectively) and after apraclonidine (p = 0.002, p = 0.01 respectively). After apraclonidine administration end diastolic velocity, mean velocity decreased and pulsatility index increased in the ophthalmic artery of both treated and fellow eyes. Resistivity index increased and peak systolic velocity decreased only in the ophthalmic artery of treated eyes. All Doppler indices remained nonsignificant for central retinal artery of both eyes. After timolol administration there were no significant changes of the Doppler indices in the ophthalmic artery and central retinal artery of the treated and fellow eyes.", 
    "181": "Topical timolol and apraclonidine significantly reduced the intraocular pressure. Single dose administration of apraclonidine 1% increased the vascular impedance distal to the ophthalmic artery. On the other hand, timolol 0.5% had no effect on vascular impedance."
