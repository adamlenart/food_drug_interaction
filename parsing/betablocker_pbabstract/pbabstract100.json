    "1": "Dogs with HF that received BB (n=39) underwent genome-wide genotyping to test the association with changes in left ventricular (LV) volume and ejection fraction after treatment. Resulting candidate genes underwent RNA quantification in cardiac tissue from normal (n=5), placebo-HF (n=5), and BB-HF (n=7) dogs.", 
    "2": "Three markers met whole-genome significance for association with improved LV end-systolic volume after BB therapy (each p<5 x 10(-7)). RNA quantification of three candidate genes near these markers -- GUCA1B, RRAGD, and MRPS10 -- revealed that gene expression levels in BB-HF dogs were between that of placebo-HF dogs and normal dogs.", 
    "3": "Genome-wide pharmacogenomic screening in a canine model of HF suggests 3 novel BB response candidate loci. This approach is adaptable to discovering mechanisms of action for other drug therapies, and may be a useful strategy for identifying candidate genes for drug response in the pre-clinical setting.", 
    "4": "All patients with stable coronary artery disease require medical therapy to prevent disease progression and recurrent cardiovascular events. Three classes of medication are essential to therapy: lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and antiplatelet agents. Lipid-lowering therapy is necessary to decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to a target level of less than 100 mg per dL, and physicians should consider a goal of less than 70 mg per dL for very high-risk patients. Statins have demonstrated clear benefits in morbidity and mortality in the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease; other medications that can be used in addition to statins to lower cholesterol include ezetimibe, fibrates, and nicotinic acid. Blood pressure therapy for patients with coronary artery disease should start with beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. If these medications are not tolerated, calcium channel blockers or angiotensin receptor blockers are acceptable alternatives. Aspirin is the first-line antiplatelet agent except in patients who have recently had a myocardial infarction or undergone stent placement, in which case clopidogrel is recommended. Anginal symptoms of coronary artery disease can be treated with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, or any combination of these. Familiarity with these medications and with the evidence supporting their use is essential to reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "5": "To understand the physiological role of ghrelin, it is crucial to study both the actions of ghrelin and the regulation of ghrelin secretion. Although ghrelin actions have been extensively revealed, the direct factors regulating ghrelin secretion by ghrelin-producing cells (X/A-like cells), however, is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the effects of peptide hormones and neurotransmitters on in vitro ghrelin secretion by the recently developed ghrelin-producing cell line MGN3-1. Oxytocin and vasopressin significantly stimulated ghrelin secretion by MGN3-1 cells. Because MGN3-1 cells express only oxytocin receptor mRNA, not vasopressin receptor mRNA, oxytocin is the likely regulator, with the effect of vasopressin mediated by a cross-reaction. We also discovered that dopamine stimulates ghrelin secretion from MGN3-1 cells in a similar manner to the previously known ghrelin stimulators, epinephrine and norepinephrine. MGN3-1 cells expressed mRNA encoding dopamine receptors D1a and D2. The dopamine receptor D1 agonist fenoldopam stimulated ghrelin secretion, whereas the D2, D3 agonist bromocriptine did not. Furthermore, the D1 receptor antagonist SKF83566 attenuated the stimulatory effect of dopamine. These results indicate that the stimulatory effect of dopamine on ghrelin secretion is mediated by the D1a receptor. In conclusion, we identified two direct regulators of ghrelin, oxytocin and dopamine. These findings will provide new direction for further studies seeking to further understand the regulation of ghrelin secretion, which will in turn lead to greater understanding of the physiological role of ghrelin.", 
    "6": "Canine coronary artery angiography (CTA) was performed in four anesthetized healthy dogs using 64-multidetector computed tomography. Esmolol, a \u03b2-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist, and sodium nitroprusside, an arteriolar and venous dilator, were administered to enhance visualization of the coronary arteries by reducing heart rate and creating vasodilation. The left main coronary artery with its three main branches and the right coronary artery were visualized and subdivided in 13 segments for evaluation. Optimal reconstruction interval, expressed as percentage of the R-to-R interval, was determined at 5% in 2.9%, 35% in 1%, 75% in 21.2%, 85% in 43.3%, and 95% in 31.7% of the segments. Overall image quality was good in 41.3% of the segments and excellent in 14.4%. There was blur in 98.1%, motion in 17.3%, and stair step in 6.7% of the evaluated segments, but these artifacts did not interfere with anatomic depiction of the arteries. Cross-sectional anatomy of the coronary arteries as evaluated from the coronary CTA agreed well with gross anatomic evaluation and published information. The use of esmolol did not lead to the target heart rate of 60-65 beats/min. Nitroprusside had no significant effect on visualized length or diameter of the coronary artery branches. Coronary CTA is useful for the anatomic depiction of coronary artery branches in the dog.", 
    "7": "A considerable body of evidence indicates that elevated resting heart rate is an independent, modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease. Elevated heart rate can produce adverse effects in several ways. Firstly, myocardial oxygen consumption is increased at high heart rates, but the time available for myocardial perfusion is reduced, increasing the likelihood of myocardial ischemia. Secondly, exposure of the large elastic arteries to cyclical stretch is increased at high heart rates. This effect can increase the rate at which components of the arterial wall deteriorate. Elastin fibers, which have an extremely slow rate of turnover in adult life, might be particularly vulnerable. Thirdly, elevated heart rate can predispose the myocardium to arrhythmias, and favor the development and progression of coronary atherosclerosis, by adversely affecting the balance between systolic and diastolic flow. Comparisons of the effects of the specific heart-rate-lowering drug ivabradine with those of \u03b2-blockers could help clarify the pathophysiological effects of elevated heart rate. Effective heart rate control among patients with coronary artery disease is uncommon in clinical practice, representing a missed therapeutic opportunity.", 
    "8": "Arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events and mortality in hypertensive patients. The influence of different antihypertensive drug classes on improving arterial stiffness beyond blood pressure reduction is not widely available. We aimed to determine whether the artery stiffness can be improved because of antihypertensive treatments independently of blood pressure lowering.", 
    "9": "We conducted a meta-analysis of individual data from 15 randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel group trials performed in our laboratory between 1987 and 1994. The primary endpoint was the changes of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) after treatment in 294 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension untreated. Treatments tested were placebo (n = 88), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (n = 75), calcium antagonists (n = 75), beta-blocker (n = 30), and diuretic (n = 26).", 
    "10": "In the short-term and long-term trials, PWV decreased significantly by -0.75 and -1.3 m/s in the active treatment group compared with by +0.17 and -0.44 m/s in the placebo group, respectively. Active treatment was independently related to the changes in PWV and explained 5 and 4% of the variance in the short-term and long-term trials, respectively. In the short-term trials, ACEIs were more effective than calcium antagonists and placebo on improving arterial stiffness. In the long-term trials, ACEI, calcium antagonists, beta-blocker, and diuretic reduced significantly PWV compared to placebo.", 
    "11": "Our study shows that antihypertensive treatments improve the arterial stiffness beyond their effect on blood pressure.", 
    "12": "Muscle sympathetic nerve firing rate increases as chronic heart failure (CHF) progresses, yet its oscillation, particularly within the frequency range encompassing 0.13 Hz, diminishes. The current study tested the hypothesis that chronic therapy with lipophilic \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists augments the modulation of muscle sympathetic nerve activity variability (MSNAV) at this frequency range.", 
    "13": "In 21 CHF angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-treated patients (age: 53 \u00b1 2, ejection fraction: 20 \u00b1 2%), MSNA was recorded before and after 4 months of \u03b2-blockade with either metoprolol (up to 50mg b.i.d.) or carvedilol (up to 25mg b.i.d.). Harmonic MSNAV was assessed by coarse graining spectral analysis. Both drugs lowered heart rate similarly (-13 \u00b1 2 beats/min; P < 0.001) but neither affected MSNA burst frequency (-7 \u00b1 4 bursts/min, not significant). Before \u03b2-blockade, harmonic MSNA power in the region encompassing 0.13 Hz was essentially absent. Beta-blockade increased the mean values for total power (from 0.00 to 0.50 Hz; 5.2 \u00b1 0.8 to 6.8 \u00b1 1.2U(2); P < 0.001) and for harmonic MSNA spectral power across the 0.1-0.22 Hz frequency range (from 0.48 \u00b1 0.10 to 1.50 \u00b1 0.32 U(2), F = 12.2; P < 0.001). Both carvedilol and metoprolol had a similar effect.", 
    "14": "In patients with CHF receiving ACE inhibitors, adding a \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist restores low and high frequency harmonic oscillations in MSNA. Beta-1 antagonism is sufficient to achieve this response. Augmented modulation of sympathetic outflow could contribute to the beneficial effects of \u03b2-blockade in CHF on sudden death and disease progression.", 
    "15": "Preclinical evidence shows that \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists (\u03b2-blockers) inhibit tumor and metastasis progression in animal models of melanoma. We hypothesized that the use of \u03b2-blockers for concomitant diseases is associated with a reduced risk of progression of thick (Breslow thickness >1 mm) malignant melanoma. Two patient subgroups were identified from the medical records of 121 consecutive patients with a thick melanoma. Of these, 30 patients had been prescribed \u03b2-blockers for 1 year or more (treated subgroup), whereas the other 91 were untreated. After a median follow-up time of 2.5 years, tumor progression was observed in 3.3% of the treated subgroup and in 34.1% of the untreated subgroup. The Cox model on progression indicated a 36% (95% confidence interval, 11%-54%) (P = .002) risk reduction for each year of \u03b2-blocker use. No deaths were observed in the treated group, whereas in the untreated group 24 patients died. To our knowledge, the present study suggests for the first time that exposure to \u03b2-blockers for 1 year or more is associated with a reduced risk of progression of thick malignant melanoma, indicating the need for larger epidemiological studies and randomized clinical trials.",

Although there were no significant differences in all cause mortality between the two groups (pooled OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.79, 1.13, P= 0.55), the subgroup analysis revealed a slight but non significant advantage with the \u03b2-adrenoceptor blocker group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization, worsening heart failure, ejection fraction, E : A ratio, deceleration time and E : E' ratio.", 
    "19": "There was no significant benefit of pharmacotherapy in HFNEF. This might have been because of a lack of stringent inclusion criteria for patients in the trials and lower power of the studies. Hence trials with well defined inclusion criteria, better power, longer follow-up periods and with echocardiographic parameters as endpoints are required to shed further light on this topic.", 
    "20": "In contrast to the adult, the third-trimester foetus experiences one of the most intense periods of growth and maturation of its lifetime. Early development is characterized by the existence of critical periods when environmental factors effectively produce long-lasting changes. Proliferative retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a potentially blinding disease characterized by uncontrolled retinal angiogenesis. This pathologic angiogenesis is the target for two new treatment modalities for ROP, i.e. intravitreal anti-VEGF (bevacizumab) and systemic propranolol, which are being evaluated in ongoing or planned studies. VEGF is essential for normal angiogenesis in a growing infant, and the adrenergic system is important for many organ systems and, in addition, for plasticity of the visual and olfactory systems.",

All patients demonstrated distinctive dome-shaped red-purple cutaneous hemangiomas. Two patients responded to steroids and propranolol (one in combination with vincristine), and two responded to steroids and vincristine. After a systematic literature review, we identified 26 previously reported cases of diffuse infantile hepatic hemangioma. Diffuse infantile hepatic hemangioma had a mortality rate of 17% and a >70% incidence of hypothyroidism, often severe (n = 30). More than one-third of patients developed heart failure (high output in half the cases). Based on our experience, early aggressive medical management, as well as thyroid replacement when indicated, should be initiated early in the course of diffuse infantile hepatic hemangioma pending evaluation for liver transplant.", 
    "23": "In acute experiments on anesthetized rats, acetylcholine (Ach) constricts hepatic venous vessels, causing blood mobilization from the liver, and dilates the sphincters of hepatic veins at the exit from this organ, contributing to the intensification of the outflow of blood deposited in the liver. Vasoconstrictor reactions of capacitive vessels of the liver to Ach are realized through M-cholinoreceptors on endotheliocytes with further involvement of messenger, possibly noradrenaline, which activates alpha-adrenoreceptors on smooth muscle cells (SMC) of capasitive vessels. Dilation of Hv sphincters is carried out due to Ach-induced release of messenger in the vessel wall, probably adrenaline, which in turn activates beta-adrenoreceptors on SMC of the Hv. It is possible, that in such reaction partially involved NO.",

It included 50 patients of whom 25 were given daily 5 and 25 mg of nebivolol and 80-100 mg of verapamil. Nebivolol was shown to significantly reduce arterial pressure, heart rate, and the number of ventricular extrasystoles. The drug was well tolerated by the patients and had no adverse effect on bronchial patiency.",

The control group was comprised of 82 patients that could not use either medicine for a variety of reasons. These patients developed signs of post-infarction left ventricular remodeling (enhanced MS and LVMM index, left ventricular spherization, cavity enlargement, systolic and diastolic LF dysfunction). Combined therapy arrested the remodeling process within 12 months after onset, reduced systolic MS, and promoted the tendency toward restoration of the LV geometric shape, size, diastolic and systolic function.",

Stressor impact caused decrease of the contractile activity in proximal and distal parts of the colon, due to \"alpha-adrenergic\" (in initial stage of stress reaction) and \"nonadrenergic noncholinergic\" inhibition. Stress-induced increase of the contractile activity of the colon was limited to the initial segment of its distal part, and was due to centrogenic stimulation of the preganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic nervous system and effector cholinergic neurons of the enteric nervous system.",

Of 19,940 cases recorded in the global safety database, 22 reports of ocular/cutaneous neoplasms were identified. Of these neoplasms, 11 were ocular and six were cutaneous melanomas. Possible association with latanoprost use could not be excluded in three ocular and one periorbital report. In vitro and in vivo data were consistent with a mechanism whereby the increased iris pigmentation results from stimulation of melanin synthesis by induction of tyrosinase transcription without increasing mitotic activity.",

    "35": "We studied how mitochondrial uncoupling by \u03b2(3)-adrenergic stimulation elicits Ca(2+) signals in rodent brown adipocytes by fluorometry of Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i), [Ca(2+)](m) and [Ca(2+)](ER)) in the cytoplasm, mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), respectively, and mitochondrial membrane potential, using fura-2, rhod-5N, cameleon and rhodamine 123. Immunoblotting demonstrated \u03b1(1A)- and \u03b2(3)-adrenergic receptor and UCP1 in adipocytes, while RT-PCR revealed the mRNA of type 3, 7 and 9 adenylate cyclase, UCP1, UCP2, UCP3 and type 1 and 2 inositoltrisphosphate receptors. Isoproterenol and BRL37344, \u03b2-agonist, caused triphasic rises in [Ca(2+)](i) (\u03b2-responses) with mitochondrial depolarization in adipocytes. BRL37344 transiently decreased [Ca(2+)](m). \u03b2-Responses were blocked by propranolol, \u03b2-antagonist, H-89, protein kinase A blocker, and knockout of UCP1 gene. The late phase of \u03b2-responses was depressed by a Ca(2+) free, EGTA solution, U73122, a phospholipase C blocker, and thapsigargin, ER-Ca(2+) pump blocker, and by transfecting siRNA for type 2 IP(3)R. Intracellular loading of BAPTA/AM depressed the late phase more strongly than the initial phase. \u03b2-Agonists, phenylephrine, \u03b1-agonist, and cyclopiazonic acid, ER-Ca(2+) pump blocker, decreased [Ca(2+)](ER). Thus, the mitochondrial uncoupling by \u03b2(3)-adrenergic activation causes Ca(2+) release from mitochondria and subsequently from the ER and further evokes plasmalemmal Ca(2+) entries, including the store-operated Ca(2+) entry.",

    "40": "This study examined the effect of schisandrin, one of the major lignans isolated from Schisandra chinensis, on spontaneous contraction in rat colon and its possible mechanisms. Schisandrin produced a concentration-dependent inhibition (EC\u2085\u2080=1.66 \u03bcM) on the colonic spontaneous contraction. The relaxant effect of schisandrin could be abolished by the neuronal Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (1 \u03bcM) but not affected by propranolol (1 \u03bcM), phentolamine (1 \u03bcM), atropine (1 \u03bcM) or nicotine desensitization, suggesting possible involvement of non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) transmitters released from enteric nerves. N(\u03c9)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (100-300 \u03bcM), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, attenuated the schisandrin response. The role of nitric oxide (NO) was confirmed by an increase in colonic NO production after schisandrin incubation, and the inhibition on the schisandrin responses by soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo[4,3-\u03b1]-quinoxalin-1-one (1-30 \u03bcM). Non-nitrergic NANC components may also be involved in the action of schisandrin, as suggested by the significant inhibition of apamin on the schisandrin-induced responses. Pyridoxal phosphate-6-azo(benzene-2,4-disulfonic acid) tetrasodium salt hydrate (100 \u03bcM), a selective P2 purinoceptor antagonist, markedly attenuated the responses to schisandrin. In contrast, neither 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, an antagonist for adenosine A\u2081 receptors, nor chymotrypsin, a serine endopeptidase, affected the responses. All available results have demonstrated that schisandrin produced NANC relaxation on the rat colon, with the involvement of NO and acting via cGMP-dependent pathways. ATP, but not adenosine and VIP, likely plays a role in the non-nitrergic, apamin-sensitive component of the response.", 
    "41": "Epinephrine (EPI) contributes to hyperalgesia in inflammatory and stress conditions. EPI signals via adrenoceptors, which are regulated by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). We previously reported that GRK2 is decreased in nociceptors during chronic inflammation. Herein, we investigated whether GRK2 modulates EPI-induced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia by using GRK2(+/-) mice, which express 50% of the GRK2 protein. We demonstrate for the first time that EPI-induced mechanical as well as thermal hyperalgesia is prolonged to approximately 21 days in GRK2(+/-) mice, whereas it lasts only 3 to 4 days in wild-type mice. Using cell- specific GRK2-deficient mice, we further show that a low level of GRK2 in primary sensory neurons is critical for this prolongation of EPI-induced hyperalgesia. Low GRK2 in microglia had only a small effect on EPI-induced hyperalgesia. Low GRK2 in astrocytes did not alter EPI-induced hyperalgesia. EPI-induced hyperalgesia was prolonged similarly in mice with tamoxifen-induced homozygous or heterozygous deletion of GRK2. In terms of EPI signalling pathways, the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 inhibited EPI-induced mechanical hyperalgesia in wild-type mice, whereas H-89 had no effect in mice with low GRK2 in sensory neurons (SNS-GRK2(+/-) mice). Conversely, intraplantar injection of the protein kinase C\u03b5 PKC\u03b5 inhibitor TAT-PKC(\u03b5v1-2) inhibited hyperalgesia in sensory neuron specific (SNS)-GRK2(+/-) mice and not in wild-type mice. These results indicate that low GRK2 in primary sensory neurons switches EPI-induced signalling from a protein kinase A-dependent toward a PKC\u03b5-dependent pathway that ultimately mediates prolonged EPI-induced hyperalgesia.", 
    "42": "Predator odors induce unconditioned fear in the young animal and provide the opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying unlearned and learned fear. In the current study, cat odor produced unlearned, innate fear in infant (postnatal age 14; PN14) and juvenile (PN26) rats, but contextual fear learning occurred only in juveniles. It was hypothesized that contextual fear learning in juveniles is mediated by norepinephrine. Consistent with this hypothesis, pre-training injection of the \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist propranolol reduced the unlearned fear response while post-training injection inhibited contextual fear learning in juvenile rats exposed to cat odor. We suggest that NE mediates the formation of contextual fear memories by activation of the transcription factor CREB in the hippocampus in juveniles but not in infants. Levels of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) were increased in the dorsal and ventral hippocampi of juvenile rats exposed to cat odor. These levels were not increased in infants or juveniles exposed to a control odor. Further, propranolol blocked these increases in pCREB. In conclusion, although innate fear occurs within the neonatal period, contextual fear learning is a relatively late-occurring event, is hippocampal dependent, and mediated by norepinephrine.",

Furthermore, a detailed analysis of antihypertensive medication pointed out that only the use of beta-blockers was associated with reduced lung function, whereas other antihypertensive medication had no effect on lung function. The adverse effect of beta-blockers was significant for forced vital capacity (p=0.04; R2: 0.65), while the association with forced expiratory volume in one second showed a trend toward significance (p=0.07; R2: 0.73).

In this article, we demonstrate the use of an integrated microfluidic chromatographic device for the LC-MS/MS investigation of the in vitro microsomal metabolism of the model drug propranolol using a sample volume of 1 \u00b5l of a 1-\u00b5M incubation. With such samples the system was capable of obtaining high-quality MS and MS/MS data from the injection of test drug substance containing sufficient information to correctly derive the structure of the drug metabolites. The analytical column was tolerant to the injection of a large percentage of organic solvent in the sample and still delivered a high-quality separation. The data suggest that these types of micro-LC-MS/MS devices are robust enough for routine applications and well suited to the analysis of small samples. Other potential applications include the generation of pharmacokinetic profiles from the reduced sample volumes obtained from serially bled small rodent studies, or the facilitation of analysis of limited-volume samples from neurological studies.",

Redox changes in cysteine residues on intralumenal loops of calcium release and reuptake channels have been implicated in altered calcium release and reuptake. These findings led us to hypothesize that altered ERO1 activity may affect cardiac functions that are dependent on intracellular calcium flux. We established mouse lines with loss of function insertion mutations in Ero1l and Ero1lb encoding ERO1\u03b1 and ERO1\u03b2. The peak amplitude of calcium transients in homozygous Ero1\u03b1 mutant adult cardiomyocytes was reduced to 42.0 \u00b1 2.2% (n=10, P \u2264 0.01) of values recorded in wild-type cardiomyocytes. Decreased ERO1 activity blunted cardiomyocyte inotropic response to adrenergic stimulation and sensitized mice to adrenergic blockade. Whereas all 12 wild-type mice survived challenge with 4 mg/kg esmolol, 6 of 8 compound Ero1l and Ero1lb mutant mice succumbed to this level of \u03b2 adrenergic blockade (P \u2264 0.01). In addition, mice lacking ERO1\u03b1 were partially protected against progressive heart failure in a transaortic constriction model [at 10 wk postprocedure, fractional shortening was 0.31 \u00b1 0.02 in the mutant (n=20) vs. 0.23 \u00b1 0.03 in the wild type (n=18); P \u2264 0.01]. These findings establish a role for ERO1 in calcium homeostasis and suggest that modifying the lumenal redox environment may affect the progression of heart failure.", 
    "59": "We used data from patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) to assess the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus (NOD) with \u03b2 blockers and to determine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition would modify this risk. The Prevention of Events with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition (PEACE) trial randomized 8,290 patients with stable CAD to trandolapril or placebo. Presence of NOD was assessed at each study visit over a median follow-up time of 4.8 years. We examined the risk of NOD associated with \u03b2-blocker use with Cox regression models adjusting for 25 baseline covariates and tested whether this risk was modified by randomization to the ACE inhibitor. Of 6,910 patients without diabetes mellitus at enrollment (1,179 women and 5,731 men, mean age 64 \u00b1 8 years), 4,147 (60%) were taking \u03b2 blockers and 733 (8.8%) developed NOD. We observed a significant interaction between \u03b2-blocker use and randomization to ACE inhibitor with respect to NOD (p = 0.028). Participants taking \u03b2 blockers assigned to the placebo group (n = 2,090) were at increased risk for NOD adjusting for baseline covariates (hazard ratio 1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.29 to 2.05, p <0.001), and this risk was attenuated in those assigned to trandolapril (n = 2,057, hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.42, p = 0.39). \u03b2 blocker use was associated with increased risk for NOD in patients with stable CAD, and this risk was decreased in patients treated concurrently with an ACE inhibitor. In conclusion, these data suggest that ACE inhibition may attenuate the risk for glucose abnormalities observed in patients taking \u03b2 blockers.",

    "62": "Several hundred mutations in more than 27 genes, most of which encode sarcomeric structures, are associated with the HCM phenotype. Thus, HCM can be thought of as a sarcomeric disease, with myocardial fiber disarray as its histological hallmark. There are two types of HCM, a more common, obstructive type (HOCM, 70%) and a less common, non-obstructive type (HNCM; in all cases of HCM, testing should be performed to detect outflow obstruction at rest and/or on provocation, and to thereby determine whether HOCM or HNCM is present. The symptoms of HCM include dyspnea, angina pectoris, palpitations, dizziness, and occasionally syncope. Because sudden cardiac death is the most serious complication of HCM, particularly in young and asymptomatic patients, it follows that correct diagnosis, followed by risk stratification of patients with regard to the need for prophylactic implantation of an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD), can be of life-saving importance. The pharmacotherapy of symptomatic HNCM consists of the treatment of heart failure with a normal ejection fraction (HFNEF). In HOCM, the patient's symptoms and the obstructive gradient are the guide to treatment with beta-blockers or verapamil. For patients with drug-resistant disease, surgical myectomy and percutaneous septal ablation are now standard treatments.",

    "64": "Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) are a potential life-threatening disease with limited pharmacological treatment options. Current treatment options are aimed at lowering aortic hemodynamic stress, predominantly with \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockers. Increasing evidence supports a role for the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in aneurysm development. RAS blockade would not only lower blood pressure, but might also target the molecular pathways involved in aneurysm formation, in particular the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathways. Indeed, the angiotensin II type 1 (AT\u2081) receptor blocker losartan was effective in lowering aortic root growth in mice and patients with Marfan's syndrome. RAS inhibition (currently possible at 3 levels, i.e. renin, ACE and the AT\u2081 receptor) is always accompanied by a rise in renin due to interference with the negative feedback loop between renin and angiotensin II. Only during AT\u2081 receptor blockade will this result in stimulation of the non-blocked angiotensin II type 2 (AT\u2082) receptor. This review summarizes the clinical aspects of TAAs, provides an overview of the current mouse models for TAAs, and focuses on the RAS as a new target for TAA treatment, discussing in particular the possibility that AT\u2082 receptor stimulation might be crucial in this regard. If true, this would imply that AT\u2081 receptor blockers (and not ACE inhibitors or renin inhibitors) should be the preferred treatment option for TAAs.",

    "69": "Reactive metabolites are estimated to be one of the main reasons behind unexpected drug-induced toxicity, by binding covalently to cell proteins or DNA. Due to their high reactivity and short lifespan, reactive metabolites are analyzed after chemical trapping with nucleophilic agents such as glutathione or cyanide. Recently, unexplained and uncharacterized methylated reaction products were reported in a human liver microsome based reactive metabolite trapping assay utilizing potassium cyanide as a trapping agent. Here, a similar assay was utilized to produce mono- or dimethylated and further cyanide-trapped reaction products from propranolol, amlodipine and ciprofloxacin, followed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/TOF-MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS) experiments for their more detailed structural elucidation. Formation of all observed cyanide-trapped products was clearly NADPH-dependent and thus metabolism-mediated. The suggested reaction pathways included N-methylation leading to iminium formation in primary and/or secondary amines preceded by cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated reactions. As the methylation reaction was suggested to be involved in formation of the actual reactive iminium ion, the observed cyanide-trapped products were experimental artifacts rather than trapped reactive metabolites. The results stress that to avoid overestimating the formation of reactive metabolites in vitro, this methylation phenomenon should be taken into account when interpreting the results of cyanide-utilizing reactive metabolite trapping assays. This in turn emphasizes the importance of identification of the observed cyano conjugates during such studies. Yet, metabolite identification has a high importance to avoid overestimation of in vitro metabolic clearance in the cases where this kind of metabonate formation has a high impact in the disappearance rate of the compound.",

Thus, we evaluated endoscopic variceal band ligation (EVBL) in primary prevention of bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and large esophageal varices. A total of 73 consecutive patients with liver cirrhosis and large esophageal varices without a history of gastrointestinal bleeding were randomized to receive either EVBL or propranolol and were followed for up to 18 months. Forty patients underwent EVBL and 33 patients received propranolol. Variceal bleeding occurred in 2 patients in the EVBL (5%) and in 2 patients in the propranolol group (6%, NS). The 18 month actuarial risk for first variceal bleed was 5% in the EVBL (95% CI, 0-12%) and 20% in the propranolol group (95% CI, 0-49%, NS). The actuarial probability of death at 18 months of follow-up was 5% (95% CI, 0-11%) in the EVBL group and 7% (95% CI, 0-17%, NS) in the propranolol arm. In conclusion, EVBL was an effective and safe alternative to propranolol in primary prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with large esophageal varices.",

    "78": "Essential hypertension is characterized by endothelial dysfunction due to reduced availability of nitric oxide (NO) secondary to increased generation of oxygen-free radicals. Some antihypertensive drugs may improve or restore endothelial function independently of their blood pressure lowering effect. The newer generation of \u03b2-blockers, such as nebivolol and carvedilol, which provide antioxidant activity, can improve endothelial function in patients with hypertension. Dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists reverse impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in different vascular districts, through a mechanism related to an antioxidant effect. However, conflicting results are found in the brachial artery. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve endothelial function in subcutaneous, epicardial, brachial, and renal circulation, but they are ineffective in potentiating the impaired response to acetylcholine in the forearm of hypertensive patients. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists can restore endothelium-dependent vasodilatation to acetylcholine in subcutaneous microcirculation but not in that of the forearm muscle. They also improve basal NO release and decrease the vasoconstrictor effect of endogenous endothelin-1. Large-scale clinical trials are required to definitively demonstrate that treatment of endothelial dysfunction can improve the prognosis of patients with essential hypertension.",

However, these antagonists induce global denervation effects not only in the cardiovascular system, but also in the brain and kidney. The objective of this study was to detect the electrophysiological property changes due to 8 days of cardiac sympathetic denervation and investigate the possible mechanisms underlying these changes using a more cardiac-specific bilateral stellate ganglionectomy (SGX) rat model. High-resolution optical mapping using a voltage-sensitive dye was performed in isolated Langendorff-perfused sham and SGX hearts, which were paced at progressively reduced basic cycle lengths under several different conditions: control, pretreatment with isoproterenol, and administration of atenolol and esmolol. Several electrophysiological parameters were recorded during periodic pacing and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Our results demonstrate that cardiac sympathetic denervation by bilateral SGX shortens action potential duration (APD) and flattens the APD restitution curve, but does not significantly affect spatial dispersion of APD. We found that, although the vulnerability of sham and SGX hearts to VF is similar, the dynamics of VF are different. The maximum dominant frequency is higher, and the spatial distribution of VF is more complex in the SGX heart, resulting in different mechanisms of VF. We demonstrated that \u03b2(1)-adrenergic receptors are downregulated in the SGX compared with sham hearts. In addition, our data suggest that the mechanism of cardiac sympathetic denervation by SGX surgery is more similar to the administration of \u03b2-blocker esmolol than atenolol.",

Surgery is now no longer indicated as first-line therapy, but should only be performed for difficult, refractory cases, or in the presence of absolute contraindications to \u03b2-blockers.

However, the detrimental effect of halide ion mediators and the generation of halogenated by-products in this process have largely been neglected thus far. In this study, we investigated the electrochemical oxidation pathways of the \u03b2-blocker metoprolol in reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) from a water reclamation plant using titanium anodes coated with Ru(0.7)Ir(0.3)O(2) or SnO(2)-Sb metal oxide layers. The results of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis indicated that irrespective of the electrode coating the same oxidant species participated in electrochemical transformation of metoprolol in ROC. Although Ti/SnO(2)-Sb exhibited higher oxidizing power for the same applied specific electrical charge, the generation of large fractions of chloro-, chloro-bromo- and bromo derivatives was observed for both electrode coatings. However, degradation rates of metoprolol and its degradation products were generally higher for the Ti/SnO(2)-Sb anode. Chemical analyses of metoprolol and its by-products were complemented with bioanalytical tools in order to investigate their toxicity relative to the parent compound. Results of the bioluminescence inhibition test with Vibrio fischeri and the combined algae test with Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata indicated a substantial increase in non-specific toxicity of the reaction mixture due to the formed halogenated by-products, while the specific toxicity (inhibition of photosynthesis) remained unchanged.",

No conclusive data are available on the sex hormone modulation of \u03b2-adrenoceptor-mediated responses on airways. To this aim, isolated preparations of bovine trachea were used to establish the sex hormone influence on salbutamol-elicited relaxation. This had 2 components, a full acute relaxation followed by a loss of efficacy, close to half of the effect. The remaining half was reverted by the \u03b2-blocker, propranolol. The loss of salbutamol-elicited relaxation might reflect the receptor desensitization, as shown by the lack of effect by subsequent administration of salbutamol, and the decrease in the immunostaining of \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors. Sex hormones differently modified the salbutamol-elicited response. Testosterone, but not other androgens or estradiol, had a synergic effect, facilitating the acute relaxation and decreasing the loss of spasmolytic effect, associated with an increase in the latency of desensitization and a decrease in the time taken to reach long-term steady-state tone. These effects, not modified by the antiandrogen flutamide or epithelium removal, seem to be independent of a modulation of \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor desensitization. Testosterone also relaxed preparations with desensitized \u03b2-adrenoceptor. Therefore, testosterone modulates tracheal smooth muscle tone, facilitating bronchodilation caused by \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor agonists which might be of pharmacological interest.",

We show that loss of AT2 expression accelerates the aberrant growth and rupture of the aorta in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome (MFS). The selective AT1 receptor blocker (ARB) losartan abrogated aneurysm progression in the mice; full protection required intact AT2 signaling. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) enalapril, which limits signaling through both receptors, was less effective. Both drugs attenuated canonical transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) signaling in the aorta, but losartan uniquely inhibited TGF\u03b2-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), by allowing continued signaling through AT2. These data highlight the protective nature of AT2 signaling and potentially inform the choice of therapies in MFS and related disorders.",

A total of 41 hypertensive patients were assessed over the course of a 1-year successful anti-hypertensive treatment. Brain areas identified previously in cross-sectional studies differing in volume between hypertensive and normotensive individuals were examined with a semi-automated measurement technique (automated labelling pathway). Volumes of grey matter regions were computed at baseline after a year of treatment and compared with archival data from normotensive individuals. Reductions in regional grey matter volume over the follow-up period were observed despite successful treatment of blood pressure (BP). The comparison group of older, but normotensive, individuals showed no significant changes over a year in the regions tested in the treated hypertensive group. These novel results suggest that essential hypertension is associated with regional grey matter shrinkage, and successful reduction of BP may not completely counter that trend.", 
    "128": "Ingestion of dietary fat stimulates production of the small-intestinal satiety factors oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and N-palmitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NPPE), which reduce food intake through a combination of local (OEA) and systemic (NPPE) actions. Previous studies have shown that sympathetic innervation of the gut is necessary for duodenal infusions of fat to induce satiety, suggesting that sympathetic activity may engage small-intestinal satiety signals such as OEA and NPPE. In the present study, we show that surgical resection of the sympathetic celiac-superior mesenteric ganglion complex, which sends projections to the upper gut, abolishes feeding-induced OEA production in rat small-intestinal cells. These effects are accounted for by suppression of OEA biosynthesis, and are mimicked by administration of the selective \u03b22-adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI-118,551. We further show that sympathetic ganglionectomy or pharmacological blockade of \u03b22-adrenergic receptors prevents NPPE release into the circulation. In addition, sympathetic ganglionectomy increases meal frequency and lowers satiety ratio, and these effects are corrected by pharmacological administration of OEA. The results suggest that sympathetic activity controls fat-induced satiety by enabling the coordinated production of local (OEA) and systemic (NPPE) satiety signals in the small intestine.",

We designed and synthesized fluorescent aryl iodide, 4-(4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)iodobenzene (DIBI) as a labeling reagent. DIBI has a lophine skeleton carrying an iodide atom acting as fluorophore and reactive center, respectively. In order to evaluate the usefulness of DIBI, a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection method was developed for the determination of alprenolol as a model compound of terminal double bond. The fluorescent labeling of alprenolol with DIBI was achieved in the presence of palladium acetate as a catalyst, and the labeled alprenolol was detected fluorometrically. In addition, it was found that the fluorescence of DIBI derivative increased and red shifted when compared with that of DIBI. Furthermore, the proposed method could be applied to determine the alprenolol concentration in rat plasma after administration of alprenolol without interferences from biological components. The detection limit (S/N=3) for alprenolol in rat plasma was 0.74 ng/mL (30 fmol on column).",

In more than half of all heart failure patients, diastolic dysfunction is the major cardiac deficit. These heart failure patients have normal (or preserved) left ventricular ejection fraction, but impaired diastolic function evident from increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Perturbations at the cellular level which cause impaired relaxation of the heart muscle involve changes in Ca(2+)-handling proteins, extracellular matrix components, and myofilament properties.

In 20 healthy adults, we measured forearm blood flow (Doppler ultrasound) and calculated forearm vascular conductance (FVC) responses to steady-state (SS) isocapnic hypoxia (O\u2082 saturation ~85%). All trials were performed during local \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockade (via a brachial artery catheter) to eliminate sympathoadrenal influences on vascular tone and thus isolate local vasodilatory mechanisms. The individual and combined effects of NO synthase (NOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition were determined by quantifying the vasodilatation from rest to SS hypoxia, as well as by quantifying how each inhibitor reduced vascular tone during hypoxia. Three hypoxia trials were performed in each subject. In group 1 (n = 10), trial 1, 5 min of SS hypoxia increased FVC from baseline (21 \u00b1 3%; P < 0.05). Infusion of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) for 5 min to inhibit NOS during continuous SS hypoxia reduced FVC by -33 \u00b1 3% (P < 0.05). In Trial 2 with continuous NOS inhibition, the increase in FVC from baseline to SS hypoxia was similar to control conditions (20 \u00b1 3%), and infusion of ketorolac for 5 min to inhibit COX during continuous SS hypoxia reduced FVC by -15 \u00b1 3% (P < 0.05). In Trial 3 with combined NOS and COX inhibition, the increase in FVC from baseline to SS hypoxia was abolished (~3%; NS vs. zero). In group 2 (n = 10), the order of NOS and COX inhibition was reversed. In trial 1, five minutes of SS hypoxia increased FVC from baseline (by 24 \u00b1 5%; P < 0.05), and infusion of ketorolac during SS hypoxia had minimal impact on FVC (-4 \u00b1 3%; NS). In Trial 2 with continuous COX inhibition, the increase in FVC from baseline to SS hypoxia was similar to control conditions (27 \u00b1 4%), and infusion of L-NAME during continuous SS hypoxia reduced FVC by -36 \u00b1 7% (P < 0.05). In Trial 3 with combined NOS and COX inhibition, the increase in FVC from baseline to SS hypoxia was abolished (~3%; NS vs. zero). Our collective findings indicate that (1) neither NO nor PGs are obligatory to observe the normal local vasodilatory response from rest to SS hypoxia; (2) NO regulates vascular tone during hypoxia independent of the COX pathway, whereas PGs only regulate vascular tone during hypoxia when NOS is inhibited; and (3) combined inhibition of NO and PGs abolishes local hypoxic vasodilatation (from rest to SS hypoxia) in the forearm circulation of healthy humans during systemic hypoxia.",

Controlled porosity of the membrane was accomplished by the use of pore-forming agent in the coating. In this study, carvedilol was chosen as a model drug with an aim to develop a zero-order release system; tartaric acid was used as the solubility promoter; NaCl was used as the osmotic agent; cellulose acetate (CA) was used as the materials of semipermeable membrane; and PEG-400 was used as the pore-forming agent in the semipermeable membrane. The influence of different factors or levels on the in vitro release was studied. In order to simulate the gastrointestinal tract environments, two kinds of pH media (pH 1.5 and 6.8) on drug release were studied in this research, respectively. This porosity osmotic pump was optimized by single factor design experiments, and it was found to deliver carvedilol at a zero-order rate within 12 h and controlled release for 24 h. We drew a conclusion that the solubility-modulated porosity osmotic pump system is simple to prepare and might be used for the preparation of osmotic pump system of other poorly water-soluble drugs with alkaline or acid groups.",

In contrast, the hypotensive effect in the ES 400 group was due to the significant decrease in CI resulting from significant reductions in cardiac contractility without any changes in SVR. Hypotension in the ES 100 group resulted in the significant reductions in both SVR and cardiac contractility.",

Therefore, in-hospital use of medications proved to decrease long-term mortality is a critical strategy to improve outcomes. Although endorsed in guidelines, predictors of initiation and continuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), \u03b2 blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have not been well studied. We assessed noncontraindicated use patterns for the 3 medications using the Get With the Guidelines-Heart Failure (GWTG-HF) registry from February 2009 through March 2010. Medication continuation was defined as treatment on admission and discharge. Multivariable logistic regression using generalized estimating equations was used to determine factors associated with discharge use. In total 9,474 patients were enrolled during the study period. Of those treated before hospitalization, overall continuation rates were 88.5% for ACE inhibitors/ARBs, 91.6% for \u03b2 blockers, and 71.9% for aldosterone-antagonists. Of patients untreated before admission, 87.4% had ACE inhibitors/ARBs and 90.1% had \u03b2 blocker initiated during hospitalization or at discharge, whereas only 25.2% were started on an aldosterone antagonist. In multivariate analysis, admission therapy was most strongly associated with discharge use (adjusted odds ratios 7.4, 6.0, and 20.9 for ACE inhibitors/ARBs, \u03b2 blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, respectively). Western region, younger age, and academic affiliation were also associated with higher discharge use. Although ACE inhibitor/ARB and \u03b2-blocker continuation rates were high, aldosterone antagonist use was lower despite potential eligibility. In conclusion, being admitted on evidence-based medications is the most powerful, independent predictor of discharge use.",

To this end, two alternative strategies were studied comprising either (i) the direct aspiration of bead suspension placed at a container attached to LOV device or (ii) the aspiration of beads after a resuspension step, allowing the formation of a fluidized bed inside the beads' container. Suspensions with homogeneously dispersed beads were also tested in the first strategy above, as prepared by increasing the viscosity of the suspension milieu with 75:15:10 glycerol/MeOH/H(2)O (in wt). The bead injection protocols were applied to four commercial reversed-phase sorbent materials with different sorptive surfaces: Oasis HLB, SupelMIP \u03b2-receptors, Lichrolut EN and Discovery DSC-MCAX, and the mass of sorbent packed in each microcolumn was assessed. Direct aspiration of methanolic suspensions gave rise to bead stacking and clogging of the LOV microconduits, resulting in a source of results with poor precision (RSD: 3.8-67.6%). The use of glycerolic suspensions was merely effective for repeatable sampling and packing of Oasis HLB and SupelMIP \u03b2-receptor beads without sorbent settlement along time. The resuspension strategy was able to handle all the materials tested with acceptable precision (RSD: 1.6-13.8%). Enhanced precision was attained (RSD <4.1%) when the sorbent bed was physically restricted to the volume of the LOV microchannel cavity. Different volumes of suspension aiming at a target mass of sorbent of 10mg were successfully handled (RSD: 3.1-13.8%), showing the reliability of the bead resuspension approach for varied nominal bead sampling volumes. The proposed bead handling protocols were applied to \u03bcSPE of propranolol taken as a model of \u03b2-blocker from aqueous solutions by SupelMIP \u03b2-receptors and Discovery DSC-MCAX beads with high repeatability (RSD <6%) and absolute recoveries between 69 and 74% in a bead-injection mode.", 
    "150": "We hypothesized that uptitration of \u03b2 blockade and adjustment of pacing parameters to achieve a prevalence of single chamber atrial inhibited rate-responsive (AAIR) pacing in patients with dual-chamber implantable cardioverter--defibrillators (ICDs) would result in maximization of \u03b2-blocker dosage and thus decrease appropriate ICD therapies. We included patients with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy and implanted ICDs without contraindications to \u03b2 blockers and atrioventricular conduction disturbances. Two 6-month periods were compared: clinically guided phase (pacing function set at back-up dual-chamber rate-responsive pacing mode at a lower rate of about 40 beats/min) and pacing-guided phase, during which \u03b2-blocker dosage was titrated with a target of achieving >90% AAIR pacing (lower rate 60 beats/min). Sixty-one patients (64.2 \u00b1 8.3 years old) were included. During the pacing-guided phase the target of \u226590% AAIR pacing was achieved in 80.3% of patients. Mean metoprolol dose during the clinically guided phase was 96.7 \u00b1 29.4 versus 127.0 \u00b1 39.6 mg/day in the pacing-guided phase (p <0.001). Appropriate ICD therapies were recorded in 35 patients (57.4%) during the clinically guided phase versus 20 (32.8%) during the pacing-guided phase (p <0.001; 1.15 and 0.48 appropriate ICD therapies per patient, respectively, p <0.001). In multivariate analysis, AAIR pacing and \u03b2-blocker dose were inversely related to appropriate ICD therapies. In conclusion, a pacing-guided approach for maximizing \u03b2-blocker doses guided by maximizing AAIR pacing in patients with ICDs may be beneficial compared to the conventional strategy. This pacing-guided approach led to higher daily \u03b2-blocker doses, which were correlated to fewer appropriate ICD therapies.", 
    "151": "Maternal defense (offspring protection) is a critical and highly conserved component of maternal care in mammalian systems that involves dramatic shifts in a female's behavioral response to social cues. Numerous changes occur in neuronal signaling and connectivity in the postpartum female, including decreases in norepinephrine (NE) signaling in subregions of the CNS. In this study using a strain of mice selected for maternal defense, we examined whether possible changes in NE signaling in the lateral septum (LS) could facilitate expression of maternal aggression. In separate studies that utilized a repeated measures design, mice were tested for maternal defense following intra-LS injections of either the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (10 \u03bcg or 30 \u03bcg) or vehicle (Experiment 1), the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (2 \u03bcg) or vehicle (Experiment 2), or the \u03b21-receptor antagonist, atenolol (Experiment 3). Mice were also evaluated for light-dark performance and pup retrieval. Thirty micrograms of the agonist isoproterenol significantly decreased number of attacks and time aggressive relative to vehicle without affecting pup retrieval or light-dark box performance. In contrast, the antagonist propranolol significantly increased maternal aggression (lowered latency to attack and increased total attack time) without altering light-dark box test. The \u03b21-specific antagonist, atenolol, significantly decreased latency to attack (1 \u03bcg vs. vehicle) without altering other measures. Although the findings were identified in a unique strain of mice, the results of these studies support the hypothesis that changes in NE signaling in LS during the postpartum period contribute to the expression of offspring protection.", 
    "152": "There is increasing interest in the relationship between host lifestyle factors and the outcomes of cancer treatment. Behavioral factors, comorbid conditions, and non-cancer-related pharmaceutical exposures may affect breast cancer (BC) outcomes. We used observational data from the LACE Study cohort (women with early stage BC from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Cancer Registry) to examine the association between beta blockers (BBs) and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and BC recurrence, BC-specific mortality, and overall mortality. Among 1,779 women, there were 292 BC recurrences, 174 BC deaths, and 323 total deaths. 23% were exposed to either a BB and/or an ACEi. These drugs were associated with older age, postmenopausal status, tamoxifen therapy, greater pre-diagnosis BMI, hypertension, and diabetes. In Cox proportional hazards models, ACEi exposure was associated with BC recurrence (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.02, 2.39, P\u00a0=\u00a00.04), but not cause-specific or overall mortality. Combined ACEi and BB were associated with overall mortality (HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.22, 3.10, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). BB exposure was associated with lower hazard of recurrence and cause-specific mortality. However, there was no evidence of a dose response with either medication. For recurrence and cause-specific mortality, BB combined with ACEi was associated with a lower HR for the outcome than when ACEi alone was used. These hypothesis generating findings suggest that BC recurrence and survival were associated with exposure to two commonly used classes of anti-hypertensive medications. These observations need to be confirmed and suggest that greater attention should focus on the potential role of these commonly used medications in BC outcomes.", 
    "153": "Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and myocardial perfusion study by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) have a diagnostic and prognostic value in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic value of combined myocardial perfusion CMR and LGE in patients with known or suspected CAD. We studied patients with known or suspected CAD. All patients underwent CMR for functional study, myocardial perfusion and LGE. Myocardial ischemia by CMR was defined as a perfusion defect in patients without LGE or a perfusion defect beyond the LGE area. Patients were followed up for cardiovascular outcomes including hard cardiac events (cardiac death or non-fatal myocardial infarction) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) which included cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, and heart failure. There were a total of 587 men and 645 women. Average age was 64.6 \u00b1 11.1 years. LGE was detected in 326 patients (26.5%). Myocardial ischemia by CMR was detected in 423 patients (34.3%). Average follow-up duration was 34.9 \u00b1 15.6 months. Univariate analysis showed that age, diabetes, use of beta blocker, left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular mass, wall motion abnormality, LGE, and myocardial ischemia are predictors for hard cardiac events and MACE. Multivariable analysis revealed that myocardial ischemia was the strongest predictor for hard cardiac events and MACE. Other independent predictors were age, use of beta blocker, and left ventricular mass. Myocardial ischemia by CMR has an incremental prognostic value for cardiac events in patients with known or suspected CAD.",

Controlled porosity osmotic pump tablet (CPOP) system was designed to deliver Nifedipine (NP) and Metoprolol (MP) in a controlled manner up to 12 h. It was prepared by incorporating drugs in the core and coated with various types (PVP, PEG-400 and HPMC) and levels (30, 40 and 50% w/w of polymer) of pore former at a weight gain of 8, 12 & 15%.",

Drug release was inversely proportional to the membrane weight but directly related to the level of pore former. Burst strength of the exhausted shell was inversely proportional to the level of pore former, but directly affected by the membrane weight. Results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies showed the formation of pores in the membrane from where the drug release occurred. Dissolution models were applied to drug release data in order to establish the mechanism of drug release kinetics.

However, there is a general lack of understanding of biased agonism when compared to traditional pharmacological terminology. Therefore, this review is designed to provide a basic introduction to classical pharmacology as well as G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction in order to clearly explain biased agonism for the non-scientist clinician and pharmacist. Special emphasis is placed on biased agonists of the beta-adrenergic receptors, as these drugs are highly prescribed, and a hypothetical scenario based on current clinical practices and proposed mechanisms for treating disease is discussed in order to demonstrate the need for a more thorough understanding of biased agonism in clinical settings. Since biased agonism provides a novel mechanism for treating disease, greater emphasis is being placed to develop biased agonists; therefore, it is important for biased agonism to be understood in equal measure of traditional pharmacological concepts. This review, along with many others, can be used to teach the basic concepts of biased agonism, and this review also serves to introduce the subsequent reviews that examine, in more depth, the relevance of biased agonism towards the angiotensin type 1 receptor, parathyroid hormone receptor, and natural biased ligands towards chemokine receptors.", 
    "158": "There is certain evidence that high efficacy of beta-adrenoblockers with alpha-adrenoblocking effect (vasodilating beta-blockers) in congestive heart failure (CHF) can be explained by their effect on nitric oxide (NO) metabolism. In this context, the possible effects of carvedilol and proxodolol on the NO level in different organs have been studied on CHF model. The heart failure was modeled in rats by ligation of the coronary artery. Operated animals were divided into experimental groups treated with carvedilol or proxodolol and the untreated (control) group. In addition, a group of sham-operated animals was formed. After 28 days of treatment, the NO level was measured in heart, liver, and kidneys using the EPR method with spin trap. It was found that, in carvedilol-treated group, the NO level in liver is significantly lower than in other groups, which can be explained by the inhibitory action of carvedilol on the NO metabolism in this organ. The NO levels in myocardium and kidney in the control group were higher than in the sham-operated group, which confirms previous findings that the NO levels increases in CHF. Both drugs significantly decreased the NO concentration in myocardium and kidney tissue compared to control animals.",

    "176": "Calcineurin and its downstream effectors nuclear factor of activated T-cells 3 (NFAT3) and zinc finger-containing transcription factor (GATA4) have been implicated in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. The aims of the present study were to investigate alterations in the calcineurin/NFAT3/GATA4 pathway in pressure-overload hypertrophy, and to determine whether adrenergic receptor blockade affects this signaling pathway. In aorta-banded rats compared with sham-operated rats, a significant increase in the phosphorylation levels of calcineurin and GATA4 was observed (both p<0.05), while the NFAT3 phosphorylation level was markedly decreased (p<0.05). Oral administration of either the non-selective \u03b2 blocker/\u03b1-1 blocker carvedilol or the selective \u03b2-1 blocker metoprolol, but not the selective \u03b1-1 blocker terazosin, significantly suppressed the activated calcineurin/NFAT3/GATA4 pathway (all p<0.05) in addition to inducing a regression of cardiac hypertrophy. Pressure overload-induced up-regulation of c-myc was markedly attenuated by treatment with either carvedilol or metoprolol (both p<0.05). The present findings may expand our understanding of the correlation between sympathetic activity and the calcineurin/NFAT3/GATA4 pathway, and highlight these signal transducers as effective targets in the management of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "177": "Glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) have a finite cell lifespan and eventually enter irreversible growth arrest known as cellular senescence. The functional changes associated with cellular senescence are thought to contribute to human aging and age-related kidney disorders, such as chronic kidney disease. Angiotensin II (AngII), a principal effector of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), is known to promote aging and cellular senescence. The cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the senescence of GMCs remain largely undefined. The JAK2/STAT pathway plays a pivotal role in transmitting cytokine signals. To date, little is known regarding the relationship between AngII or STAT protein and aging human GMCs. Therefore, this study was designed to determine the effects of AngII and the JAK2/STAT pathway on the process of GMC aging. We observed the functions of the AngII receptor blocker losartan and the JAK2 blocker AG490 in delaying GMC aging. Cells were assigned to a control group, an AngII-induced group, a losartan + AngII-stimulated group and an AG490 + AngII-treated group. AngII promoted growth arrest with phenotypic characteristics of cell senescence, such as enlarged cell morphology, polymorphic nuclei and vacuolization, increased staining for senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase, and depressed cell proliferation. The JAK2/STAT1/3 pathway is drastically activated in AngII-induced senescence cells. Compared to the AngII-induced group, in the cells treated with losartan and AG490, the characteristics of cell senescence were ameliorated, and the expression of STAT1, STAT3, pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 was decreased. Our results suggest that AngII induces human GMC senescence, and that the JAK2/STAT1/3 pathway is involved in this process. By applying losartan and blocking the JAK2/STAT pathway, it may be possible to delay GMC aging.",

But the precise molecular mechanism and effect of SK&F 96365 on mouse lymphocytes are still not well determined. This study investigated the pharmacological profile of SK&F 96365 on mouse lymphocytes stimulated by mitogen concanavalin A (Con A) or by a combination of a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and a calcium ionophore, ionomycin in vitro. Our results showed that SK&F 96365 pre-treatment diminished the cytosolic calcium rise on lymphocytes induced by ionomycin, PMA/ionomycin, and thapsigargin (TG), respectively. CFDA-SE staining results showed that SK&F 96365 (5-20 \u03bcM) inhibited both Con A- and PMA/ionomycin-induced lymphocytes proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Upon the same stimulation, SK&F 96365 inhibited the expression of CD69 and CD25 on CD3\u207a T lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner. The cell cycle analyzing results showed that SK&F 96365 caused a G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest on both Con A- and PMA/ionomycin-activated lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, SK&F 96365 induced a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) and promoted mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) in both Con A- and PMA/ionomycin-activated lymphocytes. Furthermore, SK&F 96365 significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines (interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)), and the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) on both Con A- and PMA/ionomycin-activated lymphocytes. SK&F 96365 did not induce a statistically significant increase in levels of proinflammatory IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) but of IL-12p70 upon the stimulation of Con A, whereas these three cytokines were markedly inhibited by it upon the stimulation of PMA/ionomycin. This finding revealed that SK&F 96365 exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect on mouse lymphocytes both upon the stimulation of Con A and PMA/ionomycin, and the precise mechanism of SK&F 96365 inhibiting Con A-activated lymphocytes proliferation is different from PMA/ionomycin.", 
    "179": "The majority of individuals with pre-diabetic states eventually appear to develop diabetes mellitus. During the pre-diabetic state, that may last many years, the risk of cardiovascular disease is modestly increased, with impaired glucose tolerance being slightly stronger predictor for future cardiovascular disease than impaired fasting glucose. The role of different antihypertensive drugs in the acceleration or the delay of diabetes onset is controversial. Agents that interrupt the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are likely to be beneficial in the prevention of diabetes, while calcium channel blockers are thought to act metabolically neutral. In contrast, diuretics or \u03b2-blockers, and especially their combination, are thought to increase the incidence of diabetes. Carvedilol, a non-selective \u03b2-blocker with \u03b1(1)-blocking properties, and nebivolol, a third-generation highly selective \u03b2(1)- blocker with additional endothelial nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilator activity have been shown to have a favorable effect on glucose metabolism compared with others \u03b2-blockers. Nevertheless, the key goal still remains to reduce blood pressure, which may require combination of different antihypertensive drug classes. Changes from diuretics and \u03b2- blockers to renin-angiotensin system inhibitors certainly have cost implications. However, treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may be cheaper in the long run, due to less risk of new-onset diabetes and other metabolic disturbances. Thus, for patients with pre-diabetes it is wise to choose medications with the least diabetogenic potential and until more data are available, it seems prudent to restrict use of diuretics and classic \u03b2- blockers."
