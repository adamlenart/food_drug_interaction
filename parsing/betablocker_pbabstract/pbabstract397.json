    "0": "These experiments examined the interaction of drugs affecting noradrenergic and GABAergic systems, administered post-training, in influencing retention of an inhibitory avoidance response. Male CD1 mice (23-28 g) were trained in an inhibitory avoidance task, given immediate post-training ip injections of saline or GABAergic and adrenergic drugs administered either alone or concurrently. Retention was tested 48 h later. In agreement with extensive previous evidence, the GABAergic antagonist bicuculline (0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent (inverted-U) enhancement of retention and the GABAergic agonist muscimol (1.0 mg/kg) impaired retention. The retention-enhancing effects of bicuculline were blocked by concurrent administration of the beta-nor-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (2.0 mg/kg). Also in agreement with previous evidence, the beta-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol (0.030, 0.100, or 0.300 mg/kg, ip) produced dose-dependent (inverted-U) enhancement of retention. Clenbuterol also blocked the retention-impairing effects of muscimol (1.0 mg/kg). In addition, propranolol (2.0 mg/kg) potentiated the retention impairing effects of muscimol (1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg, ip). These findings support the view that GABAergic systems modulate memory through an interaction with beta-noradrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "1": "This study compared with placebo the efficacy and tolerability of optimised doses of felodipine 5-20 mg daily, metoprolol 50-200 mg daily and their combination in subjects 60 years or over with isolated systolic hypertension. The study employed a randomised double-blind crossover design with allocation of treatment order within subjects by Latin squares. For each subject, after a single-blind run-in placebo phase, there were four randomised treatment phases each of six weeks duration, with a dose titration step at three weeks if necessary. Twenty-eight subjects entered the randomised phases of the study and twenty-one completed all four phases--13 male, 8 female (ages: median 71, range 59-85 years). At the end of both the felodipine and metoprolol phases systolic and diastolic pressure were reduced at 2 hours postdose compared with the placebo phase (p < 0.001), the blood pressure reduction with felodipine (-40/-20 mmHg) being greater than that with metoprolol (-15/-9 mmHg) (p < 0.01). Immediately predose (12 hours postdose) there was a persisting reduction of supine systolic blood pressure (-17 mmHg) with felodipine (p < 0.001), but there was no significant effect of metoprolol. At both measurement times the two drugs when in combination had an additive effect on blood pressure. There was a 20% increase in reported symptoms during each of the active treatment phases. Four subjects withdrew during the randomised phases because of probable drug-related adverse events and six subjects required dosage reductions during the felodipine or combination phases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "Long term oral warfarin should be administered to elderly patients with atrial fibrillation who are at high risk for developing thromboembolic stroke and who have no contraindications to anticoagulant therapy. Oral aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) 325mg daily may be given to elderly patients with chronic atrial fibrillation who have contraindications to anticoagulant therapy or who are not at high risk for developing thromboembolic stroke. Management of atrial fibrillation includes treatment of the underlying disease and precipitating factors. If patients have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a very rapid ventricular rate associated with hypotension, severe left ventricular failure or chest pain due to myocardial ischaemia, immediate direct-current cardioversion should be performed. Intravenous verapamil, diltiazem or a beta-blocker should be used for immediate slowing of a very rapid ventricular rate associated with atrial fibrillation. If a rapid ventricular rate associated with atrial fibrillation persists at rest or during exercise despite digoxin, then oral verapamil, diltiazem or a beta-blocker should be added. Low dosages of oral amiodarone (200 to 400 mg/day) may be used in selected patients with symptomatic life-threatening atrial fibrillation refractory to other therapy. No medication which depresses atrioventricular conduction should be given to patients with atrial fibrillation and a slow ventricular rate. Cardioversion should not be performed in asymptomatic elderly patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. This author would use a beta-blocker for control of ventricular arrhythmias and following conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. Should atrial fibrillation recur, beta-blockers have the additional advantage of slowing the ventricular rate.",

The effects of trimetazidine (20 mg three times daily) were compared with those of propranolol (40 mg three times daily) in a double-blind parallel group multicentre study in 149 men with stable angina. 3. Reproducibility of exercise performance was verified during a 3 week run-in placebo washout period. All patients had > 1 mm ST-depression on exercise test. 4. After 3 months, similar anti-anginal efficacy was observed between the trimetazidine (n = 71) and propranolol (n = 78) groups. No significant differences were observed between trimetazidine and propranolol as regards anginal attack rate per week (mean difference P-TMZ: 2; 95% CI: -4.4, 0.5) and exercise duration (mean difference P-TMZ: 0 s; 95% CI: -33, 34) or time to 1 mm ST segment depression (mean difference P-TMZ: 13 s; 95% CI: -24, 51). Heart rate and rate x pressure product at rest and at peak exercise remained unchanged in the trimetazidine group but significantly decreased with propranolol (P < 0.001 in all cases). With both drugs there was a trend to decreased ischaemic episodes in the 46% patients who experienced ambulatory ischaemia on Holter monitoring. Six patients stopped trimetazidine and 12 propranolol. Of these, five in each group were withdrawn because of deterioration in cardiovascular status. 5. The results suggest that trimetazidine and propranolol at the doses studied have similar efficacy in patients with stable angina pectoris.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The pharmacology of transplacental labetalol is reviewed and potential mechanisms for neonatal beta-adrenergic blockade are discussed.", 
    "5": "Earlier studies suggest that the accumulation of non-esterified arachidonic acid (AA) in islets following stimulation with glucose participates in the glucose-induced secretion of insulin. A possible role for AA might include the facilitation of Ca2+ influx into islet beta-cells. Recently, we demonstrated that AA induces Ca2+ influx into purified rat pancreatic islet beta-cells, prepared by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). This effect was abolished in the presence of the Ca(2+)-chelator EGTA, but was only partially reduced by the dihydropyridine (DHP) L-type Ca(2+)-channel blocker, nifedipine. This raised the possibility that DHP-insensitive Ca2+ entry mechanisms may exist in pancreatic beta-cells, in addition to the known DHP-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channels. Here we report that omega-conotoxin (CTX), which blocks omega-type Ca(2+)-channels, inhibits AA-induced Ca2+ influx by a magnitude similar to that of nifedipine and that the combination of omega-CTX and nifedipine results in a nearly additive decrement in AA-induced increases in beta-cell cytosolic [Ca2+]. We further demonstrate that bovine serum albumin, which complexes free AA and prevents AA-induced increases in cytosolic [Ca2+], also inhibits the glucose-induced increase in beta-cell [Ca2+]. These results suggest that rat pancreatic FACS-purified islet beta-cells express omega-type (DHP-insensitive) Ca(2+)-channels, in addition to DHP-sensitive Ca(2+)-channels. They further suggest that the glucose-induced accumulation of non-esterified AA in the membranes of beta-cells serves to amplify glucose-mediated Ca2+ influx into the beta-cells.", 
    "6": "The effects of carvedilol, a novel cardiovascular agent, were evaluated in developing spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) for effects on hemodynamics, and the ability to effect the development of left ventricular, and vascular hypertrophy associated with chronic hypertension. Chronic oral administration of low dose carvedilol (20 mg/kg/day) was initiated when rats were 5 weeks of age, and experiments progressed until 14 weeks of age. Carvedilol-treated SHR had significantly reduced systolic blood pressures and heart rates throughout the duration of the experiment, and had significantly reduced ventricle/body weights by approximately 9.0%. Morphologic analysis of tertiary branches of the mesenteric artery revealed that carvedilol-treated SHR had significant reductions in medial cross-sectional area. Carvedilol produced concentration-dependent inhibition of basal [3H]thymidine incorporation in cultured SHR vascular smooth muscle cells, as well as by stimulation produced by PDGF (1 nM), EDGF (1 nM), thrombin (0.5 U/ml), or endothelin-1 (1 nM), indicating that carvedilol had direct anti-mitogenic activity. The present studies demonstrate that low dose carvedilol produced sustained reductions in blood pressure and heart rate in developing SHR that were accompanied by significant inhibition in the development of vascular and myocardial hypertrophy. The morphological changes induced by carvedilol may be mediated by a combination of hemodynamic effects, as well as by direct anti-mitogenic effects on vascular smooth muscle.",

Although the mechanism for ISH in the elderly is not completely understood, the primary factor is believed to be a reduction in arterial compliance. Results of the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program demonstrated that control of ISH using a diuretic alone or in combination with a beta-blocker significantly reduced the incidence of strokes and cardiovascular events. In this trial, drug therapy was found to be safe and generally well tolerated by the elderly. Newer antihypertensive agents such as the calcium-channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have also been shown to effectively lower SBP in the elderly, but the effects on long-term morbidity and mortality are not yet known.",

    "17": "The effects of isradipine (Lomir, CAS 75695-93-1) and metoprolol (CAS 37350-58-6) on geometry and arterial compliance of the arteria brachialis of 14 patients each with essential hypertension were compared acutely and after three months of therapy by means of pulsed Doppler sonography and the determination of pulse wave velocity. A calculation model was used that allowed to determine the drug-specific effects on arterial diameter and compliance under isobaric conditions. Isradipine increased measured and isobaric diameter during short-term (p < 0.05) and long-term administration (p < 0.05) whereas metoprolol did not change it. Isradipine increased measured and isobaric compliance during short-term (p < 0.05) and long-term administration (p < 0.05). Metoprolol reduced measured compliance acutely (p < 0.01) and isobaric compliance acutely (p < 0.05) and long-term (p < 0.05). Drug-specific effects on compliance were different during short-term and long-term administration (p < 0.01); the diameter was influenced differently only during short-term administration (p < 0.05). These opposite drug effects on the A. brachialis are probably due to a vasoselective relaxation of smooth muscle in large arteries by isradipine and-in the case of metoprolol-arterial constriction. The increase of arterial compliance by isradipine reduces very effectively the load on the heart and could form the basis for the improvement in the prognosis of the hypertensive patient.", 
    "18": "The efficacy of intermittent (16 h on/8 h off) transdermal nitrate therapy (0.4 mg/h) was assessed in 46 patients with chronic stable angina, all but one of whom were on concomitant beta-blocker and/or calcium antagonist therapy. The study was a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled crossover with two consecutive 7-day treatment periods, conducted at two centres. Prior to entry into the study patients were screened for exercise test reproducibility and nitrate response. Patch efficacy was determined by maximal symptom limited treadmill stress testing (Bruce protocol) and subjective diary card data. Analysis of variance showed that active treatment significantly improved time to onset of angina (P < 0.001), time to 1 mm ST-segment depression (P < 0.001) and total exercise duration (P < 0.001) compared with placebo from 385.7, 310.8 and 458.1 s to 455.7, 385.2 and 497.1 s, respectively. Nitrate patch therapy significantly reduced diastolic and systolic blood pressures without significantly increasing resting heart rate. There was a marginal reduction in the incidence of angina attacks and sublingual nitroglycerine consumption during active treatment. We conclude that intermittent transdermal nitrate therapy significantly improves exercise tolerance in patients with chronic angina pectoris and that this improvement occurs in addition to conventional anti-anginal therapy.",

    "27": "The nature of ATP-sensitive K+ (K+ATP) channel-independent, insulinotropic action of glucose was investigated using non-glucose-primed pancreatic islets. When the beta-cell was depolarized with K+, glucose dose dependently stimulated insulin release despite inhibition of the K+ATP channel closure by diazoxide. K+ depolarization could be replaced with BAY K 8644, a calcium channel agonist. Prior fasting of rats and lowering ambient temperature greatly suppressed glucose oxidation and utilization by the islet cells and abolished insulin release in response to high glucose alone. However, under these conditions, the K+ATP channel-independent, glucose-induced insulin release was clearly demonstrable. p-Nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (sweet taste inhibitor) but not its beta-isomer, neomycin (phospholipase C inhibitor) and staurosporine (C kinase blocker) inhibited the K+ATP channel-independent, insulinotropic action of glucose. For the K+ATP channel-independent glucose-induced insulin release 1) elevation of cytosolic calcium is required, 2) minute glucose metabolism is enough, if glucose metabolism is necessary, and 3) direct recognition of glucose molecule, phospholipase C, and protein kinase C appear to be involved.", 
    "28": "Quantitative autoradiography was used to assess alterations in serotonin (5-HT) receptor binding in the hypothalamus and hippocampus following denervation with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), ovariectomy (OVX) and gonadal steroid manipulation. Seven days after 5,7-DHT injection, 5-HT1a receptor density was significantly increased in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN) of intact but not OVX female rats. Under these conditions 5-HT1b receptor density was unchanged in any brain region examined and 5-HT transporter binding was decreased in all 5,7-DHT injected animals. In addition, there was a significant interaction between OVX and 5,7-DHT for both the 5-HT1a receptor and the 5-HT transporter in the VMN, such that OVX inhibited the 5,7-DHT-induced increase in 5-HT1a receptors and attenuated the 5,7-DHT-induced decrease in 5-HT transporter binding. In a separate experiment the effect of gonadal steroid manipulation on 5-HT receptor binding was assessed. In female OVX rats, 5-HT1a receptor density was unchanged by estrogen or estrogen and progesterone administration. In male rats, castration significantly decreased 5-HT1a receptor density in the medial preoptic area. Estrogen and progesterone administration to female OVX rats increased the density of 5-HT1b receptors in the VMN, as compared to estrogen alone. The relationship of these results to the role of 5-HT in mediating lordosis behavior is discussed.", 
    "29": "The present study was designed to investigate the time course of alterations in beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor subtypes, alpha 2-adrenoceptors and uptake sites for norepinephrine in the rat brain following thyroidectomy (TXT) and thyroxine replacement. The results indicate that alterations in the thyroid state lead to changes in the pre- and postsynaptic noradrenergic system that are both region- and receptor-specific. TXT caused the binding of 125-iodopindolol to beta 1-adrenoceptors to decrease in the cortex and hippocampus and caused its binding to beta 2-adrenoceptors to decrease in the hypothalamus. TXT caused 3H-idazoxan binding to alpha 2-adrenoceptors to be reduced specifically in the amygdala. Following TXT, the binding of 3H-nisoxetine to norepinephrine uptake sites was found to be increased in the hippocampus and decreased in the hypothalamus. In most brain regions, thyroxine replacement for 7 or 28 days caused radioligand binding to recover to control levels. Thus it appears that a neuromodulatory link between thyroid hormone and the noradrenergic system exists in many regions of the rat brain.",

    "47": "The purpose of this study was to determine the role of ventricular size or contractility in the effectiveness of dynamic cardiac compression in terms of the pressure-volume relationship and myocardial oxygen consumption. In 10 isolated cross-circulated dog hearts, the ventricle was directly compressed during systole. For the volume run, measurements for slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation, pressure-volume area, external work, coronary blood flow, and myocardial oxygen consumption were achieved before and during a fixed amount of dynamic cardiac compression. Left ventricular volume was then increased while stroke volume was kept constant, and measurements were repeated. For the contractility run, after the control measurements were taken, left ventricular contractility was significantly increased or decreased by infusion of either dobutamine or propranolol into the coronary circulation. Measurements were repeated before and during dynamic cardiac compression at the control level of end-diastolic and stroke volumes. Dynamic cardiac compression significantly increased slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation, pressure-volume area, and external work (p < 0.01), whereas coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption were not affected. The increase in pressure-volume area caused by dynamic cardiac compression was greater with the larger volume. Despite the significant differences in the native left ventricular contractility, the increases in slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation, pressure-volume area, and external work did not differ among the three groups. We conclude that dynamic cardiac compression enhances left ventricular systolic function independent of ventricular contractility and without affecting coronary blood flow or myocardial oxygen consumption. Mechanical enhancement is more effective in the dilated heart.",

    "52": "All patients underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring on day 1 and were clinically followed in the hospital for 10 to 14 days. Coronary angiography was performed on day 10 to 14. Atenolol and alinidine significantly decreased the basic heart rate without causing more sinus arrest or higher-degree atrioventricular block. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation in alinidine patients was lower than in the atenolol patients (P = .007) but not lower than in placebo patients (P = .11). There was no effect of either agent on the incidence and frequency distribution of ventricular or supraventricular premature beats or on the incidence and characteristics of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, accelerated idioventricular rhythm, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), or ventricular fibrillation (VF). On day 1, seven VF episodes were recorded in six patients (2.5%) and five VT episodes in five patients (2%). VF always started at < 2.5 hours after start of thrombolytic treatment and VT always at > 2.5 hours (average of 6 hours). Five of the seven VF and three of the five VT episodes started with an R-on-T. However, for all VT, the morphology of the first beat was the same as that of the following beats, suggesting that the sustained arrhythmia was not induced by an extrasystole. After day 1 and before hospital discharge, VF and VT developed in one and six patients, respectively. Three of the seven patients who developed VF during the first 2 weeks underwent coronary angiography; all three had an occluded infarct-related artery. In contrast, only one of nine patients with early or late VT had an occluded vessel. Patients with VT and VF on day 1 had a significantly larger enzymatic infarct size than those without the arrhythmia (P = .02), and a similar trend was noted for VT or VF after day 1 (P = .19). However, none of the patients with VT or VF on day 1 developed a life-threatening arrhythmia later during the hospital stay. Also, none of the seven patients with VT or VF after day 1 had experienced a major rhythm disturbance during the first 24 hours.", 
    "53": "(1) Our data do not support the hypothesis that beta-blockers or bradycardiac agents might reduce the incidence of major arrhythmias when used in conjunction with thrombolytic therapy. (2) The pathogeneses of VT and VF early during AMI are clearly distinct. (3) VT or VF during the first 2 weeks is a marker for a larger infarct. (4) We could not detect a relation between malignant arrhythmias on day 1 and recurrences within the following 2 weeks.", 
    "54": "To establish the value of adjuvant dl-sotalol to digoxin for control of the ventricular response in chronic atrial fibrillation, 60 patients were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study. Patients were evaluated with serial ambulatory ECG monitoring and exercise testing during stable digoxin dosing and then with the addition of either a placebo or dl-sotalol, 80 mg/day, or dl-sotalol, 160 mg/day. The combination of digoxin and dl-sotalol, at either 80 or 160 mg/day, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in heart rate at rest and with exercise during both exercise testing and ambulatory monitoring. No significant difference was observed between the two doses of dl-sotalol. There was no significant difference with regard to symptoms or side effects among the three groups. In summary, dl-sotalol was noted to be a safe and effective adjuvant to digoxin for control of the ventricular response in chronic atrial fibrillation.",

    "56": "It has recently been shown that N-[(trans-4-isopropylcyclohexyl)-carbonyl]D-phenylalanine (A-4166), a new nonsulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agent, reduces blood glucose levels in nondiabetic and diabetic animals in a quicker and shorter lasting manner than sulfonylureas, and that the hypoglycemic effect of A-4166 is due to the stimulation of insulin release. However, the mechanism by which A-4166 stimulates insulin release is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effect of A-4166 on the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in pancreatic beta-cells from normal rats by dual wavelength fura-2 microfluorometry. In the presence of 2.8 mM glucose, A-4166 produced a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner over the range of 3-30 microM. The increase in [Ca2+]i was transient, oscillatory, or sustained. A-4166 did not evoke any decrease in [Ca2+]i, whereas a high concentration of glucose (16.7 mM), a metabolized secretagogue, produced an initial decrease and a subsequent increase in [Ca2+]i. In the presence of 16.7 mM glucose, low concentrations (0.03-1 microM) of A-4166 produced an increase in [Ca2+]i in some of the beta-cells tested. The [Ca2+]i response to A-4166 was completely and reversibly inhibited under Ca(2+)-free conditions as well as by nitrendipine, a blocker of the L-type Ca2+ channel. Nitrendipine also inhibited insulin release from perfused rat pancreases stimulated by A-4166. Diazoxide, an opener of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel, blocked the [Ca2+]i response to A-4166. Sulfonylureas such as tolbutamide and glibenclamide increased [Ca2+]i in a manner similar to A-4166. These results indicate that at basal glucose concentrations, A-4166 increases [Ca2+]i in rat pancreatic beta-cells by stimulating Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels, and that this effect is markedly augmented at elevated glucose concentrations. It appears that the increase in [Ca2+]i is related to the stimulation of insulin release by A-4166. Inhibition of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, but not stimulation of beta-cell metabolism, may be involved in the increase in [Ca2+]i by A-4166.", 
    "57": "Isolated rat left atria or right ventricular strips were electrically stimulated at a constant frequency. The amplitude of twitch contractions, thus elicited, rose as a function of stimulation intensity because of increases in the evoked release of sympathetic catecholamines. Bradykinin had no effect on contractile force in preparations paced at a minimal intensity (threshold). By contrast, bradykinin (1 nmol/L to 1 mumol/L) markedly increased twitch contractile force when the preparations were paced at a high intensity (two to three times threshold). The EC50 for the positive inotropic action of bradykinin averaged 42 nmol/L. Ramiprilat (1 mumol/L), an angiotensin I-converting enzyme/kinase II inhibitor, shifted the EC50 for bradykinin to approximately 2 nmol/L. Ramiprilat (1 mumol/L) per se also produced a modest positive inotropic effect. The effects of bradykinin and/or ramiprilate were inhibited by HOE 140 (300 nmol/L), a bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist. Propranolol (1 mumol/L), a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, abolished the effects of bradykinin. After the destruction of sympathetic nerve endings by use of 6-hydroxydopamine, bradykinin no longer exerted a positive inotropic action. Cocaine (10 micrograms/mL), an inhibitor of catecholamine reuptake, potentiated the effect of bradykinin. Bradykinin did not affect the positive inotropic response to tyramine (10 mumol/L), whereas cocaine blocked it. Furthermore, bradykinin did not modify the dose-response curves for added norepinephrine. omega-Conotoxin (100 nmol/L) inhibited the positive inotropic effect of intensified stimulation and bradykinin potentiation. Bradykinin is suggested to facilitate the evoked release of sympathetic catecholamines and thereby cause a positive inotropic effect.",

    "59": "Myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density and function are diminished in patients with chronic heart failure. Down-regulation occurs predominantly in the subendocardium, suggesting that local rather than systemic alterations in sympathetic neural function may be responsible. Although some studies have implicated hypofunction of cardiac sympathetic nerves with defective norepinephrine uptake, others suggest increased cardiac sympathetic nerve activity with unimpaired uptake.", 
    "60": "We measured norepinephrine uptake by incubating transmural slices of the left ventricle from 19 patients who had chronic heart failure and three nonfailing control hearts with [3H]norepinephrine with or without desipramine, a neuronal uptake blocker. The density of uptake sites was measured in subepicardial and subendocardial myocyte regions with light microscopic autoradiography.", 
    "61": "Although the amount of [3H]norepinephrine uptake varied considerably in failing ventricles, uptake was directly proportional (r = 0.46, p < 0.05) to beta 1-adrenergic receptor density measured in additional slices with radioligand binding assays. In addition, marked transmural heterogeneity in [3H] norepinephrine uptake was consistently observed in failing ventricles. Uptake in subendocardial myocyte regions was significantly less than in subepicardial regions (mean [ +/- SD] subepicardial/subendocardial uptake ratio 4.7 +/- 4.8, p < 0.01). The extent of transmural heterogeneity in norepinephrine uptake was similar in patients with idiopathic and ischemic cardiomyopathy. In contrast, nonfailing hearts exhibited more uniform transmural [3H]norepinephrine uptake (subepicardial/subendocardial uptake ratio 1.8 +/- 1.2, p = NS).", 
    "62": "Specific [3H]norepinephrine accumulation is approximately fivefold lower in subendocardial regions of failing left ventricles than in subepicardial regions. These findings support the hypothesis that a subendocardial defect in norepinephrine uptake may chronically elevate local interstitial catecholamine levels and thereby down-regulate beta-adrenergic receptors in a spatially heterogeneous distribution.", 
    "63": "1. The effect of intravenous boluses of verapamil (0.15 mg/kg), flecainide (2 mg/kg), amiodarone (5 mg/kg), and sotalol (1.5 mg/kg) on mean arterial pressure, heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), total peripheral resistance (TPR), and peak rate of change of left ventricular pressure (LV dP/dt) were assessed in the conscious rabbit. 2. All four drugs had negative inotropic effects: verapamil reduced peak LV dP/dt by 19 +/- 4% (mean +/- s.e.m.; P < 0.01), flecainide by 27 +/- 9% (P < 0.001), amiodarone by 11 +/- 2% (P < 0.01) and sotalol by 13 +/- 3% (P < 0.01). 3. The drugs had different effects on CO as a result of differences in their actions on peripheral blood vessels: verapamil and amiodarone produced, respectively, a 12 +/- 4% (P < 0.03) and 16 +/- 6% (P < 0.01) increase in CO associated with a substantial vasodilatory effect (TPR reduced 15 +/- 7% [P < 0.05] and 20 +/- 5% [P < 0.01], respectively). Flecainide caused only a small (6 +/- 1%; P < 0.01) increase in CO and sotalol had no effect on either CO or TPR. 4. Bolus intravenous injections of verapamil, flecainide and amiodarone produced an increase in HR, while sotalol reduced HR by 10 +/- 2% (P < 0.01). The increase in HR and cardiac output seen with verapamil, flecainide and amiodarone was in part secondary to reflex increase in sympathetic tone and these changes were abolished after total cardiac autonomic blockade. 5. The modest reduction in cardiac performance associated with sotalol was abolished by cardiac autonomic blockade, suggesting that the predominant effect of sotalol on contractility was mediated through its beta-adrenoceptor blocking effect.", 
    "64": "This study evaluated the effect of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (beta-blockers) with or without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity on the 24-hour blood pressure profile of 15 untreated patients with essential hypertension. After a 4-week run-in period, subjects were randomly assigned to an 8-week treatment period of once-daily carteolol (15 mg/d) or atenolol (50 mg/d). The groups were crossed over at week 8. Office blood pressure and heart rate were recorded every 2 weeks and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed immediately preceding and at the conclusion of each period. Both drugs significantly reduced (P < 0.01) office blood pressure and heart rate throughout the two treatment periods. The 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring at 0.5- and 1-hour intervals revealed that systolic blood pressure in 2 of 8 sleeping hours and diastolic blood pressure in 4 of 8 sleeping hours were significantly higher (P < 0.05) after carteolol treatment than after atenolol treatment. The average values for both daytime and nighttime blood pressures, however, were significantly lower at the end of both periods. Although atenolol lowered heart rate throughout the 24-hour period, there was a smaller reduction in heart rate with carteolol than with atenolol during daytime (-5.4 +/- 4.9 beats/min vs -12.7 +/- 6.6 beats/min, P < 0.005, respectively). Heart rate increased during nighttime (P < 0.02) and was significantly greater than with atenolol treatment (5.0 +/- 7.2 beats/min vs -5.7 +/- 8.0 beats/min, P < 0.001, respectively). These results suggest that the different effects of the two beta-blockers on heart rate and nighttime blood pressure may be attributed to the presence or absence of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.", 
    "65": "In the aim of determining an electrophysiologic effect of disopyramide and metoprolol at alone therapy and in combination in patients with supraventricular tachycardia on the background of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome 23 persons were examined. All patients were subjected to an intracardiac electrophysiological testing; in its process metoprolol in the dosage of 0.2 mg/kg of body weight, disopyramide in the dosage of 2 mg/kg per body weight both separately and in combination were controlled. It was identified that metoprolol and disopyramide are an effective antiarrhythmic preparates applied for arresting and prevention of reciprocating orthodromic tachycardias in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.", 
    "66": "Loss of consciousness in childhood may be due to cardiovascular causes, and the Long Q-T syndromes can present with seizures. The Romano-Ward syndrome is of autosomal dominant inheritance, and the Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome, with associated deafness, of autosomal recessive inheritance. The diagnosis is often delayed, but a careful history can avoid this. The syndromes can appear to be due to an imbalance in the sympathetic nerve to the ventricular myocardium, and precipitating causes such as stress suggest a CNS influence on this. The electrocardiogram can confirm the prolonged Q-T interval, but this is not always present, at least without an exercise test. Treatment with beta-blockers is often successful. If a wrong diagnosis of epilepsy is made a chance may be missed of avoiding sudden death, quite apart from all the medical, and social consequences that can result from such a diagnosis.", 
    "67": "To prospectively assess the response of orthotopic heart transplant recipients to exercise before and after beta-adrenergic blockade, we investigated 35 orthotopic heart recipients, all with clinically stable conditions and without rejection, and five control, healthy subjects. Radionuclide angiography was performed at rest and during supine bicycle exercise, before and after beta-blockade. At rest, heart rate, systolic and diastolic pressures, and end-systolic volume were higher, whereas the end-diastolic volume and stroke volume indexes, cardiac index, and ejection fraction were significantly lower in the transplant recipients than in healthy control subjects. During exercise, before beta-blockade, transplant recipients attained a lower maximal heart rate and smaller increments in heart rate than did the control subjects. The cardiac index increased during exercise because of an increase in stroke volume (43%) and heart rate (32%) in the transplant recipients and nearly exclusively (93%) because of an increase in heart rate in the normal subjects. After beta-blockade, the ejection fraction, the stroke volume, and the cardiac index fell significantly at rest in both groups. The fall in ejection fraction was greater in the transplant recipients than in the control subjects (-16% +/- 12.6% versus -5.4% +/- 2.6%, respectively; p = 0.0002). After beta-blockade, lower maximal heart rate, ejection fraction, and cardiac index were achieved during exercise in both groups. The peak exercise cardiac index was 42% lower in transplant recipients than in control subjects after beta-blockade. Thus, cardiac performance during exercise is impaired in orthotopic heart transplant recipients. Acute beta-adrenergic blockade accentuates the impairment in ventricular performance and appears to be detrimental in these patients.", 
    "68": "A critical problem in determining the intracellular mechanisms regulating atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion is the extrapolation of data obtained in cultures of atrial myocytes isolated from neonatal animals to that obtained in intact atria isolated from adult animals. We have therefore examined ANP secretory responses in primary cultures of atrial myocytes isolated from adult rats to more closely approach the adult phenotype. Activation of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors by norepinephrine (in the presence of propranolol) increased the rate of ANP secretion approximately two-fold (EC50 = 0.32 microM). This response was mediated predominantly by the alpha 1A-like subtype of alpha 1-receptors. Phorbol esters increased the rate of ANP secretion approximately 2.4-fold independently of alpha 1-receptor occupancy. Kinetic analysis showed that the secretory responses to either agonist did not appear to diminish within 2 h. The responses to both alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation and phorbol ester addition were inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor, H-7, but not by structurally related isoquinolines. Influx of extracellular Ca2+, independently of its effects on contraction of the myocytes, was also necessary for a full secretory response to alpha 1-receptor activation. Additionally, the secretory response to alpha 1-adrenergic agonists was attenuated by calmodulin inhibitors. In contrast to the response to alpha 1-adrenergic receptor activation, stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors or addition of a membrane permeable cAMP analog reduced the rate of both basal and alpha 1-stimulated ANP secretion. These results show that activation of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in adult rat atrial myocytes directly increases the rate of ANP secretion. This response is dependent upon protein kinase C and supported by extracellular Ca2+ influx. Conversely, activation of beta-adrenergic receptors, which increases intracellular cAMP, directly inhibits ANP secretion.",

    "70": "The control of the formation of rabbit oviduct fluid and its relationship to the secretion of chloride ions has been studied using an in vitro vascularly perfused preparation. Fluid was produced at a rate of 43.41 microliters h-1 in oviducts from rabbits in oestrus. The rate was increased by isoprenaline and tetraethylammonium, decreased by dibutyryl cAMP, dihydro4,4'diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (H2DIDS), and propranolol, while amiloride had no effect. H2DIDS induced a small decrease and isoprenaline a small increase in vascular to lumen Cl- flux but propranolol and dibutyryl cAMP had no effect. Oviducts from pseudopregnant animals treated with hCG three days before the experiment produced significantly less fluid than did those from rabbits in oestrus, but there was no difference in vascular to lumen Cl- flux. The concentration of K+ in oviduct fluid formed in vitro was more than three times higher than in the vascular perfusate. The ability of adrenergic agents to influence the formation of rabbit oviduct fluid could have clinical implications in the prevention or treatment of female infertility due to blockage of the Fallopian tubes and might also be useful in enhancing the secretory activity of oviduct cells maintained in co-culture with early embryos.", 
    "71": "1. Previously we have shown that extracellular application of ATP, a substance co-stored and co-released with acetylcholine (ACh) in the peripheral nervous system, markedly potentiated the frequency of spontaneous synaptic currents (SSCs) produced by ACh. In the present study, we have further characterized the purinoceptor which mediates the potentiation effect of ATP and the role of endogenously released ATP. 2. Pretreatment with a P2-purinoceptor antagonist, suramin (0.3 mM), but not a P1-purinoceptor antagonist, 8-phenyltheophylline (0.1 mM), prevented the potentiating effect of ATP. 3. We studied the role of endogenously released ATP by examining the effect of a specific P2-purinoceptor antagonist on the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events at high-activity synapses (> or = 3 Hz) and found that suramin, but not 8-phenyltheophylline markedly reduced the frequency of SSCs at these high-activity synapses. In addition, desensitizing the P2-purinoceptor with alpha,beta-methylene ATP also produced similar effects to suramin. 4. Extracellular application of the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers, verapamil, nifedipine or diltiazem (10 microM each) reduced SSC frequency of high-activity synapses, while the N-type Ca2+ channel blocker, omega-conotoxin had no appreciable effect. The potentiating effect of ATP was further prevented by pretreatment with the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers. On the other hand, Bay K 8644, which is a depolarization-dependent L-type Ca2+ channel agonist, potentiated SSC frequency at these high-activity synapses. 5. These results suggest that endogenous release of ATP at developing neuromuscular synapses is responsible for the maintenance of high levels of spontaneous ACh release, which is known to play a crucial role in regulating postsynaptic differentiation.", 
    "72": "Clinical conditions, such as heart failure or myocardial infarction are associated with enhanced sympathetic and reduced parasympathetic activity as compared to normal controls.

Adrenergic and cholinergic blockades were induced by i.v. propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) and atropine (0.04 mg/kg) in two opposite orders on two occasions; interindividual correlations were performed between the R-R interval responses to propranolol and to atropine obtained under the various blockade conditions, and the magnitude of the responses were compared by a drug x order two factorial ANOVA design. It was found, that previous adrenergic blockade did not reduce the extent of cardioacceleration produced by subsequent cholinergic blockade and that the R-R interval responses to atropine and to subsequently given propranolol did not share significant variance across subjects (r = 0.22, P = 0.234). Also, no interindividual correlation was found between the R-R interval responses to propranolol and to atropine, with the influence of the other, respective, autonomic division already blocked (r = 0.42, P = 0.114).",

    "75": "The effect of unilateral perfusion of the preoptic area (POA) utilizing in vivo microdialysis with the GABAergic agonist, muscimol, or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on cardiovascular function (heart rate, blood pressure and cutaneous blood flow) was determined in halothane-anesthetized rats. Perfusion of muscimol or PGE2 increased the heart rate, 55 +/- 6 beats/min and 69 +/- 12 betas/min, respectively (P < 0.01). Cutaneous paw blood flow tended to decrease. Blood pressure did not change in response to the perfusion of muscimol, but increased 9 mmHg in response to the perfusion of PGE2 (P < 0.01). The increases in heart rate and blood pressure were blocked by systemic administration of propranolol or adrenalectomy (P < 0.01), suggesting that these effects were due to the activation of the sympathetic innervation of the heart or adrenal gland. It is proposed that the POA provides a tonic inhibitory afferent to posterior hypothalamus neurons which regulate cardiovascular function.",

The aim of this study was to assess if the addition of atropine can compensate for the presence of beta-blockers in dobutamine stress echocardiography. Twenty-six patients referred for evaluation of chest pain were studied twice, on and off metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d. (in random order sequence) with a wash-out period of at least 48 h. Dobutamine stress echocardiography was performed using up to 40 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, followed, if necessary, by the addition of atropine to achieve 85% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate, unless symptoms or markers of ischaemia appeared. Atropine was given to patients on beta-blockers more often [(22/26) vs (6/26)] than to those off beta-blockers (P < 0.001). Heart rate at every stage of the test was lower on beta-blockers. Chest pain occurred in patients on beta-blockers significantly less than in those off beta-blockers (8% vs 46%), and the addition of atropine made no significant difference (31% vs 46%). During dobutamine stress, new wall motion abnormalities occurred in three patients on beta-blockers (12%); this number increased to 15 after the addition of atropine (57%). New or worsened wall motion abnormalities occurred in 12 patients (46%) off beta-blockers with dobutamine alone and in 14 patients after adding atropine (53%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Six of them were concomitantly taking amiodarone and/or beta-blocking agents. On admission, seven patients exhibited systemic hypotension and nine complained of asthenia and/or dizziness or drowsiness. ECG findings showed in all a persistent sinus arrest with atrial, junctional or ventricular escape, leading to a mean heart rate of 40.2 +/- 3 beats.min-1 (range 25-56). All patients had chronic renal failure on biological tests, with a mean endogenous creatinine clearance of 25 +/- 3 ml.min-1 (range 12-36). Intravenous calcium hydrochloride (mean 1.4 +/- 0.2 g, range 1-2), given in nine patients, rapidly restored stable sinus activity in seven. We suggest that diltiazem should be given cautiously to ageing patients with chronic renal failure, and confirm the efficacy of intravenous calcium in reversing calcium channel blocker toxicity on sinus node.", 
    "78": "The enantioselective formation kinetics of 4-hydroxypropranolol (4-HOP), 5-hydroxypropranolol (5-HOP), and desisopropylpropranolol (DIP) were characterized over a wide substrate concentration range (1-1000 microM) in human liver microsomes using deuterium-labeled pseudoracemic propranolol. Existing data suggest that several microsomal cytochrome P-450 enzymes are involved in the oxidative metabolism of propranolol in humans. Biphasic kinetics were observed in the formation of all three metabolites, indicating the involvement of at least two enzymes in each pathway. The R/S ratios for the formation of all three metabolites varied with respect to the substrate concentration, lending further support to the contribution of two or more enzymes with differing KM's and enantioselectivity. The high-affinity 4-hydroxylation process showed a strong R-enantioselectivity. The low-affinity component of 4-hydroxylation also exhibited a preference for R-(+)-propranolol, although to a lesser degree than the high-affinity component. A similar pattern of enantioselectivity was observed for 5-hydroxylation, except that R/S ratio showed an initial increase followed by a decrease as the propranolol concentration increased beyond 200 microM. Formation of DIP was R-enantioselective at low substrate concentrations, whereas an opposite enantioselectivity was observed at high propranolol concentrations. The metabolism of propranolol in the presence of nanomolar concentrations of quinidine (a selective inhibitor of P-450 2D6) was studied at concentrations of pseudoracemic propranolol in the high- and low-affinity regions. A significant inhibition of 4- and 5-hydroxylation was observed, whereas N-dealkylation was not affected by quinidine. The inhibition of 4-hydroxylation was slightly enantioselective toward R-enantiomer. Quinidine had no significant effect on the low-affinity component for 4-hydroxylation. Although the inhibition of 4- and 5-hydroxylation at the high-affinity site was extensive, complete inhibition was not achieved even at the highest quinidine concentration (10 microM). Data could be fitted to a mixed-type inhibition kinetics resulting from multiple high-affinity hydroxylases. Our in vitro results indicate that formation of 4-HOP and 5-HOP is mediated by more than one P-450 enzyme with major contribution from P-450 2D6, whereas the formation of DIP is catalyzed by two or more P-450 enzymes other than 2D6.", 
    "79": "Sotalol (STL) is a chiral beta-adrenergic blocking drug, which is useful clinically as the racemate in treating hypertension, and is also useful as a class III antiarrhythmic when administered as the pure S-enantiomer. Utilizing a stereospecific high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay, the enantiomeric disposition of STL is reported after administration of racemate and both pure enantiomers to a rat model. After administration of the racemate, enantiomers of STL had similar plasma concentration-time profiles. Following administration of the pure S-enantiomer of STL, however, systemic clearance was significantly reduced; R-STL disposition after pure enantiomer administration was not significantly altered. Changes in systemic clearance of S-STL after either racemate or enantiomer dosing were explained by corresponding changes in renal clearance. Renal clearance values of S-STL were significantly reduced from 33.7 +/- 6.0 to 28.9 +/- 5.6 ml min-1 kg-1 for administration as racemate and pure enantiomer, respectively. As clearance of STL approximates reported values of renal blood flow, renal perfusion changes caused by the beta-blocking effects of R-STL may explain changes in S-STL disposition. It is suggested that dosing of STL as either racemate or pure enantiomer, depending on the clinical indication for use, may result in significantly altered enantiomer disposition.", 
    "80": "Puerarin is an isoflavone compound isolated from Pueraria lobata (Wild). This study characterized the vascular action of puerarin in order to more clearly elucidate its pharmacological activities. Helically cut strips of cat femoral veins and renal arteries were suspended in an organ chamber filled with Krebs bicarbonate solution for measurement of isometric force development. In the cases of femoral veins and renal arteries isoproterenol (0.01 mumol.L-1 -0.1 mmol.L-1) caused relaxation of methoxamine-induced contraction (0.01 mmol.L-1) in a concentration-related manner. Puerarin (0.01-0.1 mmol.L-1) inhibited the relaxation response to isoproterenol in a concentration-response fashion. Propranolol (0.1-1 mumol.L-1) inhibited the isoproterenol-induced relaxation too. Puerarin (0.1mmol.L-1) did not alter the relaxation response to nitroglycerin (1 mumol.L-1). These results indicated that puerarin acted as a beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist in isolated arteries and veins.", 
    "81": "(+)-Propranolol was infused at two rates into the pyloric vein (a portal vein tributary) of 15 male Sprague Dawley rats until apparent steady-state conditions were established (i.e., 8 hr at each rate). One group (n = 7) received the high dose (40 micrograms/min/kg) first, and in the other group (n = 8) the low dose (20 micrograms/kg/min) was used to initiate treatment. Free and total serum concentrations of propranolol were measured. When the low dose was given first, the apparent steady-state concentrations achieved during low- and high-rate infusion steps were 166 +/- 37 and 774 +/- 235 ng/mL, respectively. These data are consistent with a simple Michaelis-Menten kinetic model and the key parameters of such a model (Vmax and Km) were estimated. However, a crucial test of such a model (and one which should give insight regarding the relevance of an \"altered enzyme hypothesis\") is to reverse the order of infusion steps since, in a system controlled by Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the same steady-state concentrations should be achieved regardless of the order in which infusion steps are given. When the sequence of infusion rates was reversed, steady-state concentrations were 492 +/- 142 and 298 +/- 79 ng/mL for the high and low infusion rates, respectively. Clearly, a history of high-dose exposure reduces the intrinsic clearance of total drug (CLss) during a subsequent low-dose exposure (i.e., the apparent steady-state levels during the low-dose pyloric vein infusions were significantly different; P < 0.001). When these data were corrected for plasma protein binding, the same trends emerged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "82": "The central role of insulin resistance in patients with essential hypertension was the impetus for the present study, in which carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were examined before and after three months treatment with doxazosin (n = 14) and atenolol (n = 15). After completion of a randomised parallel group trial, the study was extended in a subgroup of the patients who continued treatment with doxazosin for a further nine months (n = 18). Insulin sensitivity was measured with the euglycemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp. Blood glucose and plasma insulin were analysed in the fasting state and during an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). Lipoprotein fractions were analysed in serum. After three months, SBP and DBP in the standing position decreased to the same extent after the two drugs whereas the decrease in supine SBP did not reach statistical significance in the doxazosin group. Doxazosin, in contrast to atenolol, decreased serum triglycerides (-17%, P < 0.04) by lowering the VLDL and LDL fractions. Serum cholesterol fell after doxazosin (-7%, P < 0.02) but not after atenolol. The effects of doxazosin on serum lipids remained the same during the long-term follow-up. At three months neither drug had significantly affected variables reflecting insulin sensitivity although atenolol tended to decrease the insulin sensitivity index (-17%, P = 0.08). After 12 months the doxazosin group showed a significant increase in the insulin sensitivity index and a significant decrease in both basal plasma insulin and in the late insulin response at IVGTT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "83": "Propranolol HCl was encapsulated with cellulose acetate butyrate by an emulsion-solvent evaporation method. Three direct compression diluents were blended with appropriate size fractions of the microspheres and each formulation was compressed at several pressures to give tablets that readily disintegrated in water. Tablets with microcrystalline cellulose (MC) as the diluent had the highest tablet crushing strength at any given compression pressure. Heckel plots of all the microsphere-diluent blends were nonlinear, indicating that the consolidation may result from crushing and rearrangement of the individual particles in addition to plastic deformation. Tablet properties and estimated yield pressures showed that MC was the most suitable diluent for compression of propranolol HCl microspheres. Drug release from compressed tablets was always faster than from uncompressed microspheres, but useful sustained-release characteristics were retained. Dissolution tests of MC formulations of the tableted microspheres showed increased release rate constants and decreased 50 per cent dissolution times compared to microspheres that had not been compressed. This result indicated that rupture of some of the microspheres had occurred. The drug release rate increased at higher compression pressures due to the rupture of a greater proportion of microspheres. Larger changes in release rate and t50 percent were observed with larger microspheres sizes. Generally, the least compression pressure that gives tablets with acceptable properties is preferred.", 
    "84": "Propranolol HCl was encapsulated with cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) by an emulsion-solvent evaporation method to obtain discrete, spherical microspheres. The effects of drug to polymer ratio and microsphere size on dissolution characteristics were studied. Drug release was faster in simulated intestinal fluid than in simulated gastric fluid. Unencapsulated propranolol HCl powder had very rapid dissolution, as expected. Release rate from CAB microspheres increased with higher drug to polymer ratios and decreased with increasing diameter. Drug release from microspheres sizes larger than 180 microns was reasonably well described by the spherical matrix model. For microsphere size fractions between 127 and 359 microns the relationship between the 50 per cent release time and the square of the microsphere diameter was linear (r = 0.9999).", 
    "85": "We have recently reported a study of beta-adrenergic receptor binding characteristics in lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and healthy, matched control subjects. In the present study we have investigated the effects of incubating cells from the same subjects with lithium chloride (1 mM) for 7 days prior to assay. There was no difference in beta-adrenergic receptor number between control and BD cell lines and incubation with lithium had no effect on receptor number in either group. Exposure of the cells to isoprenaline (1 nM) for 24 h immediately prior to assay caused significantly less down-regulation in BD cells (15 +/- 5%) than control cells (39 +/- 4%), as described previously. Incubation with lithium significantly increased the down-regulation response to isoprenaline in BD cells (39 +/- 6%) but not in control cells (30 +/- 7%). After lithium, the agonist-induced decrease in beta-AR number in BD cells was no longer significantly different from that in control cells. We conclude that lithium selectively enhanced the agonist down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in cells derived from patients with bipolar disorder. The functional significance of this result and the potential biochemical mechanisms responsible for this effect are discussed.", 
    "86": "The efficacy and safety of amlodipine was evaluated in 20 patients with stable exertional angina. Patients with > or = 3 anginal attacks per week in the placebo run-in phase were admitted into a 4 weeks active treatment phase. Amlodipine was administered at a starting dose of 5 mg once daily at bed time, which could be adjusted after 2 weeks to 10 mg once daily if the patient continued to have even a single anginal attack/week. Four weeks of treatment with amlodipine produced a significant (p < 0.05) reduction from baseline in both the mean (+/- SE) number of anginal attacks/week (from 13.3 +/- 1.5 to 1.6 +/- 0.5) and the mean (+/- SE) number of isosorbide dinitrate tablets consumed per week (12.1 +/- 1.5 to 2.6 +/- 0.8). Eighty three percent of patients required an increase in dose to 10 mg daily. No significant change in heart rate, blood pressure, ECG and laboratory results were observed. One patient was withdrawn because of deteriorating angina and sinus tachycardia secondary to beta blocker withdrawal. Worsening of ankle odema was reported in 2 (10%) patients, which was tolerated and disappeared on completing therapy. Thus amlodipine is safe and effective when used as monotherapy in the treatment of chronic stable angina.", 
    "87": "1-(3-Chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP) (0.125-1.0 mg/kg i.p.), previously shown to inhibit social interaction, dose-dependently reduced exploration of the open arms of an elevated plus-maze. These findings suggest anxiogenic properties. The effect of mCPP was more potently inhibited by 1-(1-naphthyl)piperazine than by ketanserin, indicative of its mediation via activation of 5-HT2C rather than 5-HT2A receptors. The 5-HT1B receptor agonist CGS 12066B did not antagonise the anxiety-like response to mCPP, and further reduced exploration at the highest dose tested (10 mg/kg i.p.). Depletion of serotonin (5-HT) by p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, 150 mg/kg/day x 3) did not prevent the response, although PCPA itself increased open arm exploration. The 5-HT1A/B and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist 1-propanolol (5 mg/kg i.p.) and the peripheral beta 1-receptor antagonist atenolol (20 mg/kg i.p.) showed no significant activity on the plus-maze either alone or against the anxiogenic effect of mCPP. These results indicate that mCPP induces anxiety in the rat in the elevated plus-maze primarily by stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT2C receptors, and suggest that sympathomimetic effects of mCPP are not involved.", 
    "88": "The serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT1A receptors bind certain beta-adrenergic antagonists, such as propranolol and pindolol, with high affinity. Other 5-HT1 receptors that display very low affinity for beta-adrenergic antagonists, have either a threonine (T) (5-HT1D alpha, 5-HT1D beta and 5-HT1E) or an alanine (A) (5-HT1F) residue in the homologous position in the seventh transmembrane domain. In the case of the human 5-HT1D beta receptor, replacement of this T with asparagine (N), dramatically increases its ability to bind beta-adrenergic antagonists. To assess whether other 5-HT1 receptors would behave similarly, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to replace the T or A in 5-HT1D alpha, 5-HT1E and 5-HT1F receptors with N. Both the wild-type and mutant genes were expressed transiently in COS-7 cells and radioligand binding studies were performed by using [3H]5-HT and [125I]iodocyanopindolol. Using [3H]5-HT, we found that the affinities of all the mutant receptors for propranolol and pindolol were significantly increased by 100-1000 fold, 5-HT1D alpha and 5-HT1F receptors showing the highest and the 5-HT1E receptor displaying the lowest affinity. On the other hand, the affinities for 5-HT were essentially unchanged as compared to the wild-type receptors. All mutant receptors bound [125I]iodocyanopindolol with high affinity, KD values ranging between 0.04 nM (mutant 5-HT1D alpha) and 0.57 nM (mutant 5-HT1E), whereas the wild-type receptors failed to show any specific binding with this radioligand in the same concentration range used for the mutant receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "89": "SDZ 216,525 has been proposed to be a silent 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. The present study examined the potential intrinsic agonist action of SDZ 216,525 using two in vivo models of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor function: 5-HT release using microdialysis and feeding behaviour of satiated animals. SDZ 216,525 (1 mg/kg s.c.) and the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (1 mg/kg s.c.) significantly decreased hippocampal 5-HT release. In addition, SDZ 216,525 (3 and 10 mg/kg s.c.) and prazosin (3 and 10 mg/kg s.c.) significantly increased food intake in satiated rats. The selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (RS)-WAY100135 (10 mg/kg s.c.) which has been demonstrated to block the effects of 8-OH-DPAT on 5-HT release and food intake had no significant effect on the response induced by SDZ 216,525. In contrast, the non-selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (-)-pindolol (8 mg/kg s.c.) attenuated both SDZ 216,525 responses. The decrease in hippocampal 5-HT release and increase in food intake induced by SDZ 216,525 suggest that the compound may be a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist. However, the failure of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (RS)-WAY100135 to block the SDZ 216,525 responses suggests that SDZ 216,525 decreases 5-HT release and increases food intake by a mechanism other than 5-HT1A receptor agonism. The high affinity of SDZ 216,525 for the alpha 1-adrenoceptor, and the ability of prazosin to decrease 5-HT release and increase food intake, suggest that the effects of SDZ 216,525 may be mediated via an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist action.", 
    "90": "Administration of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist (+-)-8-Hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH DPAT, 50 ng) into the dorsal raph\u00e9 nucleus (DRN) increased social interaction but did not change the motor activity of rats tested in high light, thus indicating an anxiolytic response. This effect was blocked by coadministration of the 5-HT1A antagonist, tertatolol (3 micrograms). In contrast, 8-OH DPAT (50 and 100 ng) was without effect on social interaction when administered to the DRN projection area in the ventral hippocampus, but did change locomotor activity. The effects depended on the light level and dose: thus when the rats were tested in low light, 50 ng increased locomotor activity, but in high light a decrease was found with 100 ng and also an induction of wet dog-shakes. Thus, our results support the importance of the somatodendritic autoreceptors in the DRN in alleviating anxiety, whereas the post-synaptic receptors in the ventral hippocampus play no role. They do, however, mediate changes in activity and the 5-HT syndrome.",

Since it is metabolized in the liver, propranolol may not be the drug of choice in those patients who have compromised liver function or who are recovering from prior liver diseases. Another nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker, nadolol, has no hepatic biotransformation. We present here the first case report of successful treatment of lithium-induced tremor with nadolol, which was selected because the patient had compromised liver function. The patient's liver function tests remained stable with the therapy.", 
    "92": "As a result of recent advances in our understanding of the role of nitric oxide and endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) in vascular control, physicians now have the potential to overcome the loss of EDRF effect by administering nitrates. Nitrates are converted to nitric oxide, resulting in vasodilator effects that improve the myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance responsible for myocardial ischemia. This discovery has resulted in a renewed interest in the nitrates for the treatment of ischemic syndromes, particularly chronic stable angina pectoris. Over the past 2 years, an important new formulation of nitrate has become available--isosorbide-5-mononitrate. Three different mononitrate formulations are available in the United States: Ismo tablets in December 1992; followed over a year later by Monoket tablets, available since June 1993; and Imdur extended-release tablets, available since August 1993. Although the mononitrates share the same generic name, they are not similar in regard to their formulations, which suggests the need for future studies designed to explore any clinical differences.",

It seems to be as effective as other beta-blockers in the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. beta-Blockers have many cardioprotective effects and have been shown to reduce the morbidity and mortality from coronary artery disease in a number of trials. However, there is no good clinical evidence that celiprolol itself has specific cardioprotective properties other than those attributable to this class of drugs. Because of its pharmacological profile, celiprolol is less likely to cause bradycardia, deterioration in cardiac function and other adverse effects mainly caused by beta 2-blockade. Unlike most other beta-blockers, celiprolol has no adverse effects on plasma lipids. It seems to be well tolerated in diabetic patients and patients with renal dysfunction.", 
    "94": "According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R), drug-induced depression may be classified as an Organic Mood Syndrome, Depressed Type. Unfortunately, the DSM-III-R diagnostic criteria are not sufficiently precise for application in research, and studies of drug-induced depression have rarely utilised these criteria. Research concerned with drug-induced depression is characterised by a number of methodological complications. These include differing definitions of depression, including depression defined as a symptom, a syndrome, or by diagnostic criteria for a specific mental disorder. In addition, patients undergoing pharmacological treatments for medical illnesses are typically exposed to considerable psychosocial stress due to the suffering and disability associated with illness. These psychosocial factors may in themselves precipitate episodes of depression. Due to these complicating factors, sophisticated study designs are required to confirm an aetiological role for medications as risk factors for depression. Unfortunately, adequate studies have rarely been conducted, and much of the literature consists of case reports and clinical observations. Consequently, clinicians are frequently required to make clinical judgements about the aetiology of patients' depressive symptoms in the absence of definitive scientific information about the role of drugs. Nevertheless, a knowledge of the relevant literature will assist clinicians in making reasoned judgements about the aetiology, prevention and management of these disorders.", 
    "95": "Portal hypertension is treated by reducing portal pressure in order to prevent esophageal variceal bleeding or recurrent bleeding. Because portal hypertension depends on both elevated portal tributary blood flow and intrahepatic vascular resistance, the pharmacologic therapy of this syndrome consists in reducing portal blood flow or vascular resistance, or both. The pharmacologic prevention of first bleeding or recurrent bleeding has been performed with nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonists (propranolol or nadolol). Certain controlled studies have shown that this type of drug significantly reduces the risk of first bleeding by approximately 40% in patients with esophageal varices. A meta-analysis showed that death due to bleeding was also significantly lower in the beta-blocker group than in the placebo group. Moreover, beta-blockers are effective in patients in both good and poor condition and with all types of cirrhosis. The efficacy of beta-blockers on the risk of recurrent bleeding is less clear, but these substances significantly decrease the risk of rebleeding, by approximately 30%. Recurrent bleeding in patients treated with beta-blockers is associated with the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma or lack of compliance. In conclusion, it is clear that different substances have portal hypotensive effects and can be used to treat or prevent complications of portal hypertension. However, other drugs should be tested, and other clinical studies are needed to identify good responders.", 
    "96": "The prognosis of patients who bleed from esophageal varices is dismal. Prophylactic treatment of the varix or the elevated portal venous pressure offers a possibility of improving the outlook for these patients. However, as only approximately one-third of patients with varices bleed during their lifetime, correct identification of high-risk patients is vital before embarking on prophylaxis. At present, neither European or Japanese selection criteria are perfect in this respect. The documented incidence of initial variceal bleeding varies between 27% and 48%, and most bleeding episodes occur within the first year after varices are diagnosed. Data from six randomized controlled trials comparing prophylactic beta-blockers with placebo demonstrated a decreased incidence of bleeding in propranolol-treated patients, which in large measure may depend on patient compliance and did not significantly affect survival in all but one study. Early randomized studies of prophylactic sclerotherapy have shown significant reductions in both the incidence of bleeding and mortality, but this promise has not been sustained by subsequent trials, and indeed sclerotherapy was detrimental in two studies. The impressive results in highly selected patients treated in Japan by prophylactic surgery are unlikely to be repeated in a Western setting, involving patient populations that consist predominantly of alcoholic cirrhotics. At present prophylaxis with beta-blockade seems to offer the best therapeutic option, but the future may lie in the development of new interventional techniques such as transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunting (TIPS) or variceal banding, and ultimately with hepatic transplantation.", 
    "97": "This study shows that diazepam (20 mg/Kg) and clonazepam (2 mg/Kg) administered intraperitoneally to 36 hour-fasted rabbits induce a significant (p < 0.05) hyperglycaemia 30 min. after administration. It also shows that the hyperglycaemic action of these benzodiazepines is significantly potentiated by nifedipine (10 mg/Kg) and inhibited by adenosine (1 mg/Kg), caffeine (40 mg/Kg) and propranolol (20 mg/Kg). The most pronounced inhibitory effect was that exerted by propranolol (p < 0.05). It is suggested that diazepam and clonazepam induced hyperglycaemia may be due to the release of hyperglycaemic hormones including adrenaline responsible for an increase of 3' 5' cAMP since the action of these benzodiazepines is inhibited by propranolol.",

Both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors were present in the atrioventricular node, bundle of His, interatrial and interventricular septa. No differences in the density or proportions of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in the atrioventricular node, bundle of His, interatrial septum and interventricular septum were observed between hearts with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or ischemic heart disease (P > 0.05) so further analysis did not distinguish between the two aetiologies. The density of beta 1-adrenoceptors was lower in the bundle of His (5.0 +/- 1.7 fmol/mg protein) than in the atrioventricular node (22.2 +/- 5.7 fmol/mg protein, P < 0.05), the interatrial septum (29.6 +/- 4.5 fmol/mg protein, P < 0.001) and interventricular septum (24.9 +/- 5.2 fmol/mg protein, P < 0.005, n = 8 for all values). The atrioventricular node, interatrial and interventricular septa had similar densities of beta 1-adrenoceptors (P = 0.60, ANOVA). The distribution of beta 2-adrenoceptors in the atrioventricular node (21.5 +/- 4.1 fmol/mg protein), bundle of His (12.9 +/- 2.6 fmol/mg protein) and atrial (16.7 +/- 2.3 fmol/mg protein) and septal myocardium (13.8 +/- 2.5 fmol/mg protein, n = 8 for all values) was uniform (P = 0.18, ANOVA). The percentage of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in the atrioventricular node, bundle of His, interatrial and interventricular septa was uneven (P < 0.001, ANOVA). There was a higher proportion of beta 2-adrenoceptors in the bundle of His (72 +/- 6%) than in the atrioventricular node (51 +/- 3%, P < 0.01), interatrial septum (36 +/- 1%, P < 0.001) and interventricular septum (36 +/- 1%, P < 0.001).",

These specific properties of the drug facilitate the prescription of cibenzoline in cardiology, particularly for the prevention of recurrent atrial arrhythmia: fibrillation, flutter, atrial tachycardia. This study demonstrates that cibenzoline is effective in these indications, since only 23% of the patients had relapsed after 6 months. This efficacy, combined with the good tolerance of the treatment, makes it possible to recommend the prescription of cibenzoline as a first-line treatment for the prevention of atrial arrhythmia. It represents an effective and safe option.", 
    "101": "The effects of adrenaline and adrenoreceptor antagonists on ovulation and follicle wall contraction were investigated in brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) follicles using in vitro incubation systems. Adrenaline significantly stimulated a dose-dependent increase in ovulation and follicle contraction at concentrations between 1.0 and 100 mumol l-1. The ovulatory and contractile effects of 10 mumol adrenaline l-1 could be blocked by the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonists WB-4101 and benoxathian, and by the alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine. WB-4101 was the most potent blocker, significantly inhibiting ovulation and contraction at 1.0 mumol l-1. In contrast, the beta-antagonist propranolol (100-0.001 mumol l-1) was totally ineffective in blocking adrenaline-induced ovulation and follicle contraction. The results indicate that there is a strong correlation between the effects of adrenaline on ovulation and contraction. In addition, the antagonist studies indicate that adrenaline stimulates ovulation and follicle contraction of brook trout follicles through alpha-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "102": "1. The radioligand [125I]-iodocyanopindolol ([125I]-ICYP) was used under standard ligand binding conditions, to detect beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in membrane preparations from bovine skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. High concentrations of [125I]-ICYP were also used, to identify an 'atypical' binding site in skeletal muscle. Finally, adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) production was measured in the same membrane preparations, to determine the relationship between the beta-adrenoceptor sub-types present and the production of this second-messenger. 2. According to the results of radioligand binding studies, both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue membranes have beta 2-adrenoceptors, characterized by a high affinity for the beta 2-selective antagonist, ICI 118551 (pK 8.3 and 8.6 respectively); and a low affinity for the beta 1-selective antagonist CGP 20712A (pK 5.2 in both tissues). Antagonism of (-)-isoprenaline-stimulated cyclic AMP production by low concentrations of ICI 118551, yielded pseudo pA2 values in muscle and adipose tissue of 7.6 and 8.7 respectively, confirming that beta 2-adrenoceptors in these tissues are linked to the production of the second-messenger. 3. Although beta 1-adrenoceptors could not be detected in either skeletal muscle or adipose tissue membranes by use of ligand binding techniques, high pseudo pA2 values were obtained (8.0 and 8.2 respectively), when CGP 20712A was used to block the stimulation of cyclic AMP production by (-)-isoprenaline. This finding is consistent with the presence in both tissues of a population of beta 1-adrenoceptors which is small, but efficiently coupled to the second-messenger. 4.In addition to identifying standard beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, it was also established that skeletal muscle membranes have an 'atypical' binding site which has a relatively low affinity for [125]-ICYP(pK8.84), but which exists in abundance. At high concentrations of radioligand, the 'atypical' site accounted for 89% of the total [125I]-ICYP binding sites present.5. The results of second-messenger studies do not support the hypothesis that skeletal muscle or adipose tissue membranes contain functional beta 3-adrenoceptors: based on the failure of a beta 3-adrenoceptor-selective agonist (BRL 37344) to stimulate cyclic AMP production, the absence of a biphasic response to (-)-isoprenaline, and the observation that cyclic AMP production was not resistant to blockade by either ICI 118551 or CGP20712A.6. It is concluded that data from radioligand binding studies do not accurately reflect the contribution made by beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors to cyclic AMP production in bovine skeletal muscle and adipose tissue membranes. Furthermore, the 'atypical' [125I]-ICYP binding site identified in bovine skeletal muscle does not represent a functional bovine beta 3-adrenoceptor.", 
    "103": "The relative bioavailability of metoprolol and pindolol from capsules containing the drug preadsorbed onto activated charcoal (100 mg metoprolol tartrate/120 mg charcoal and 10 mg pindolol/20 mg charcoal) was studied in two separate studies, in healthy volunteers, using randomized, crossover designs. The metoprolol control was a capsule containing the drug only and the pindolol control was a conventional tablet. In an in vitro dissolution study, both control formulations showed a rapid, total release of the drug, whereas from each of the drug-charcoal complexes, around 30% of the drug was released rapidly after which the release continued more slowly, reaching 45-60% in 24 h. The absorption of metoprolol and pindolol was slower from the charcoal formulations than from the control formulations. Charcoal, however, also essentially decreased the bioavailability, reducing the mean AUC0-24h and the mean 24 h urinary excretion of both metoprolol and pindolol to one-half and the mean plasma Cmax to one-third compared to the control. The increase in the mean tmax was not statistically significant. These results indicate that desorption of metoprolol and pindolol from charcoal occurs in the human gastrointestinal tract, but the bioavailability remains low. In spite of the sustained in vitro release of both drugs, the absorption was only slightly retarded at these charcoal:drug ratios.", 
    "104": "The purpose of this study was to examine whether impaired insulin clearance contributes to the hyperinsulinemia observed in humans with essential hypertension. Previous studies from our group and others have demonstrated that individuals with essential hypertension are resistant to the glucoregulatory effect of insulin. Animal models have confirmed this finding and have suggested that hypertensive animals have impaired insulin clearance that might contribute to the observed hyperinsulinemia. The metabolic clearance rate of insulin (MCRins) was calculated during a constant infusion of glucose (320 mg/m2/min) and insulin (25 mU/m2/min), under conditions where endogenous insulin secretion was suppressed by somatostatin infusion (250 micrograms/h) for four groups of age sex and weight-matched patients: normotensive volunteers, untreated hypertensives, hypertensives treated with diuretics and hypertensives treated with diuretics and beta-blockers. MCRins was impaired in all three groups of hypertensive subjects compared with normal BP volunteers, particularly in untreated hypertensives and those treated with combination diuretic and beta-blocker therapy: normal = 0.6 +/- 0.1; untreated = 0.47 +/- 0.2; diuretic = 0.51 +/- 0.1; combination = 0.39 +/- 0.2 (in ml/min, expressed as mean +/- SD). The effectiveness of somatostatin for islet suppression was confirmed by demonstrating markedly diminished C-peptide concentrations in untreated hypertensives and normal volunteers. Thus, our previous finding of elevated steady-state plasma insulin during insulin suppression testing in hypertensives seems not to be the result of impaired pancreatic response to somatostatin but, rather, there seems to be a defect in insulin clearance in these individuals not unlike that demonstrated in animal models of hypertension and insulin resistance. The nature of this defect remains to be elucidated.", 
    "105": "Increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and mismatch in ventilation-to-perfusion ratio characterize acute lung injury (ALI). Pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) decreases when nitric oxide (NO) is inhaled during hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV); thus NO inhalation may reduce PVR and improve gas exchange in ALI. We studied the hemodynamic and gas exchange effects of NO inhalation during HPV and then ALI in eight anesthetized open-chest mechanically ventilated dogs. Right atrial pressure, Ppa, and left ventricular and arterial pressures were measured, and cardiac output was estimated by an aortic flow probe. Shunt and dead space were also estimated. The effect of 5-min exposures to 0, 17, 28, 47, and 0 ppm inhaled NO was recorded during hyperoxia, hypoxia, and oleic acid-induced ALI. During ALI, partial beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol, 0.15 mg/kg i.v.) was induced and 74 ppm NO was inhaled. Nitrosylhemoglobin (NO-Hb) and methemoglobin (MetHb) levels were measured. During hyperoxia, NO inhalation had no measurable effects. Hypoxia increased Ppa (from 19.8 +/- 6.1 to 28.3 +/- 8.7 mmHg, P < 0.01) and calculated PVR (from 437 +/- 139 to 720 +/- 264 dyn.s.cm-5, P < 0.01), both of which decreased with 17 ppm NO. ALI decreased arterial PO2 and increased airway pressure, shunt, and dead space ventilation. Ppa (19.8 +/- 6.1 vs. 23.4 +/- 7.7 mmHg) and PVR (437 +/- 139 vs. 695 +/- 359 dyn.s.cm-5, P < 0.05) were greater during ALI than during hyperoxia. No inhalation had no measureable effect during ALI before or after beta-adrenergic blockade. MetHb remained low, and NO-Hb was unmeasurable. Bolus infusion of nitroglycerin (15 micrograms) induced an immediate decrease in Ppa and PVR during ALI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "106": "The importance of beta-receptor stimulation for the metabolism and circulation in the liver and exercising muscle was studied in six men during 3 h of leg exercise at 50% of maximum oxygen uptake. At 160 min of exercise, 0.15 mg propranolol/kg body wt was given intravenously. The results were compared with a previously studied control group examined in the same way but without beta-receptor blockade. The data show that beta-blockade during prolonged leg exercise, compared with exercising controls, results in 1) reduced splanchnic and leg blood flows (P < 0.005-0.01); 2) higher epinephrine and norepinephrine levels (P < 0.001); 3) unchanged respiratory exchange values, indicating unchanged carbohydrate oxidation; 4) a less marked drop in leg glucose uptake, suggesting reduced muscle glycogenolysis; 5) a higher splanchnic glucose output (P < 0.05) but lower splanchnic uptakes of lactate and glycerol after propranolol (P < 0.025-0.01), i.e., diminished uptake of gluconeogenic precursors, indicating accelerated hepatic glycogenolysis; and 6) unchanged glycerol levels with a lower splanchnic glycerol uptake, indicating reduced lipolysis. The data imply that, despite lower glycogen stores during prolonged exercise, liver glycogenolysis, as opposed to exercising muscle glycogenolysis, may be accelerated during beta-receptor blockade.",

Repetitive MI, separated by a reperfusion period of 50 min, was induced by coronary artery branch ligature and quantitated from epicardial NADH-fluorescence photography. Starting after a reperfusion period of 20 min, isolated hearts were treated with NE (10(-6) M), in the presence of propranolol (10(-6) M), phentolamine (10(-6) M) and vitamin C (3 x 10(-8) M) in the perfusion buffer to prevent the functional effects of NE. The influence of the free radical scavenger superoxide dismutase (SOD) (30 U/ml) or captopril (10(-6) M) on MI was also examined.",

    "110": "The Tilt Test is a commonly used clinical tool for the assessment of volume depletion. Most of the data pertaining to the normal limits of the Tilt Test were determined by studying normal, healthy volunteers. Patients presenting with possible volume depletion, however, may have medical conditions (e.g., diabetes) or be taking medication (e.g., antihypertensives) that may affect the cardiovascular response to the Tilt Test. One hundred thirty-three euvolemic, asymptomatic outpatients (34 diabetics, 20 patients on beta blockers, 31 patients on diuretics, 28 patients on diuretics plus beta blockers, and 20 patients on clonidine hydrochloride) underwent Tilt testing. The readings obtained from each subgroup were compared to 33 sex- and age-matched controls who had no medical problems and were on no medications. No significant differences among the groups could be determined. We conclude that in otherwise euvolemic, asymptomatic patients, neither diabetes mellitus nor the specific antihypertensives studied interfere with the normal response to the Tilt Test.",

Large-scale secondary preventive studies on calcium antagonists have been disappointing. In contrast, beta-blockers have an established role in cardioprotection both in primary and secondary preventive studies and there is evidence to show that the cardioprotective effect of beta-blockers is even greater in the diabetic population. Furthermore, this favourable impact of beta-blockers was achieved despite diabetic patients having a worse risk factor profile and poorer prognosis. In this review the use of beta-blockers in diabetic patients will be discussed and their impact on coronary artery disease described.", 
    "112": "The role of the macula densa in the control of renin synthesis during sodium depletion was studied in Balb/c mice which had their left kidney made hydronephrotic 6 weeks earlier. The role of the nervous system was studied by giving the mice propranolol or by denervation of the left kidney. There was no net secretion of renin from the left hydronephrotic kidney on control or low sodium diet. All plasma renin came from the right kidney. Sodium depletion caused similar rises in renin content of the normal and hydronephrotic kidney. These rises were accompanied by increases in mRNA for renin in both kidneys. Denervation of the left hydronephrotic kidney caused a fall in renal renin content. However, sodium depletion caused a significant rise in both renin mRNA and renal renin in the control and denervated hydronephrotic kidney. Propranolol decreased the renin content of normal and hydronephrotic kidneys. Sodium depletion caused a rise in mRNA and renal renin in both kidneys although the absolute final amount was less than in the control animals. Sodium depletion stimulates renin synthesis in a normal kidney and a kidney without a macula densa. This response is not affected by the nervous supply to the kidney. In the hydronephrotic mouse subjected to sodium depletion the synthesis and secretion of renin appear to be disassociated.", 
    "113": "The anti-ischemic effect of 5 mg nebivolol o.i.d., a newly developed beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocking drug with vasodilating properties, was compared with that of atenolol (100 mg o.i.d.) following a treatment period of 6 days. The study was performed in 24 patients with documented coronary artery disease and stable angina pectoris according to a double-blind randomized study, designed using conventional symptom-limited exercise testing. Exercise testing 3 h after the first dose showed a more marked ST-segment reduction by atenolol than by nebivolol (59% vs. 18%). ST-segment depression measured 24 h after administration of the penultimate dose was statistically significantly reduced by nebivolol (from 0.19 +/- 0.07 to 0.13 +/- 0.07 mV; P = 0.0059) but not by atenolol (from 0.17 +/- 0.06 to 0.14 +/- 0.10 mV; P = 0.0703). Approximately 3 h after the last dose, the reduction was comparable (45% and 38% by nebivolol and atenolol, respectively). Exercise duration, exercise time necessary to produce ST-segment depression by 0.1 mV and exercise time to the onset of angina were also prolonged following administration of both drugs. Thus, at steady-state single daily doses of 100 mg atenolol and 5 mg nebivolol were about equieffective when measured at time of maximal effect (i.e. 3 h after drug administration). However, duration of action with respect to the ST-segment depression seems to be slightly longer for nebivolol.", 
    "114": "Oxygen radical mediated endothelial injury plays an important role in cardiovascular disease.

The aim of this study was to determine whether carvedilol protects oxygen radical induced endothelial injury.",

Cell injury was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and cell death, or 51 Cr release from prelabelled BPAEC. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin trapping technique was used to detect the amount of radical spin adducts formed in cell lipids.",

Other beta blockers tested (propranolol, labetalol, pindolol, and celiprolol) showed a mild effect or no effect at all. Increasing the time of pretreatment with carvedilol enhanced its cell protective effect against oxidative stress. Carvedilol also protected BPAEC dose dependently from PMA activated, neutrophil induced cell injury. Carvedilol had no effect on xanthine oxidase activity. EPR study confirmed that xanthine-xanthine oxidase induced the formation of lipid derived radicals in cell lipids and carvedilol scavenged free radicals, as indicated by the decreased EPR signal.",

    "118": "The beta 3-adrenoceptor (AR) agonists are potent activators of lipolysis in white adipose tissue. beta-AR agonists were tested here on the lipolytic activity of a hibernator, the garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus L.). All the agonists exhibited full intrinsic activity; the most potent was the beta 3-AR agonist BRL-37344 [half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) = 0.8 nM]. The beta-antagonist idocyanopindolol (ICYP) also stimulated lipolysis of white adipocytes with the same potency and intrinsic activity as BRL-37344. The blockade of lipolytic effects of epinephrine or norepinephrine was similar to that of BRL-37344: the beta 1- and the beta 2-antagonists were quite ineffective. Total blockade occurred only with 100 microM bupranolol whatever the beta-agonist tested. This argues for the presence of a beta 3-component in the adrenergic-induced lipolysis. (-)-[125I]ICYP and (-)-[3H]CGP-12177 both labeled two populations of binding sites. On adipocyte membranes, binding of 0.6 nM (-)-[3H]CGP-12177 was inhibited with the following order of potency: isoproterenol > BRL-37344 > epinephrine. This order was modified at 20 nM, arguing for the beta-atypical nature of the low-affinity sites. Thus garden dormouse adipocytes possess beta 3-ARs, which are involved to an important degree in the adrenergic activation of lipolysis.", 
    "119": "1. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the metabolic responses produced in man by the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist BRL 35135, and to determine which of these responses are beta 3-, rather than beta 1- or beta 2-, mediated. 2. Eight normal male subjects received single oral doses of BRL 35135 (8 mg) or the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol (8 mg) after pretreatment with placebo, bisoprolol (5 mg) as a selective beta 1-antagonist or nadolol (20 mg) to block beta 1- and beta 2-, but not beta 3-adrenoceptors. 3. BRL 35135 and salbutamol produced a significant fall in serum potassium concentration compared with placebo, in keeping with beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation. Both drugs also produced a significant increase in serum glucose, insulin and lactate concentrations, which mirrored the hypokalaemic response, being unaffected by selective beta 1-blockade (bisoprolol), but completely blocked by nadolol. BRL 35135 (but not salbutamol) also produced a significant rise in serum free fatty acid and glycerol concentrations, which appeared to be beta 2-mediated. 4. A significant increase in basal metabolic rate occurred with both BRL 35135 and salbutamol. In the case of salbutamol, this effect appeared to be mediated solely by beta 2-adrenoceptors, whereas BRL 35135 produced a thermogenic response which could only be partially accounted for by a combination of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation. 5. These results infer the possibility of thermogenic beta 3-adrenoceptors in man, although these do not appear to be involved in the control of carbohydrate or fat metabolism.",

    "121": "The authors previously reported on studies of the splanchnic neural regulation of insulin, glucagon, and pancreatic polypeptide secretion. In these studies, alpha-adrenergic fibers appeared to have a predominant effect, strongly inhibiting the secretion of insulin, glucagon, and pancreatic polypeptide secretion. Cholinergic fibers appeared to stimulate strongly, although beta-adrenergic fibers weakly stimulated, the secretion of these hormones. Investigations of neural regulatory mechanisms governing human somatostatin release in vitro have not been previously reported.",

The isolated perfused human pancreas technique was used to assess the regulation of somatostatin secretion by the various neural fibers contained within the celiac plexus.

The augmentation seen with glucose was inhibited 66 +/- 22% (n = 8, p < 0.05) during celiac neural bundle stimulation. Alpha-adrenergic blockade resulted in a 90 +/- 30% (n = 6, p < 0.01) augmentation of somatostatin release. Beta-adrenergic blockade caused a 13 +/- 2% (n = 6, p < 0.05) suppression of somatostatin release. Complete adrenergic blockade resulted in a 25 +/- 23% (n = 5, p = not significant) inhibition of somatostatin release. Cholinergic blockade resulted in a 40 +/- 10% (n = 6, p < 0.02) suppression of somatostatin release.", 
    "124": "The predominant effect of celiac neural bundle stimulation was inhibition of somatostatin secretion through an alpha-adrenergic effect. Beta-adrenergic fibers stimulate somatostatin secretion; cholinergic fibers have a negligible effect on somatostatin secretion. These data suggest that the splanchnic innervation of the pancreas has a potent regulatory role in somatostatin release in this in vitro human model.", 
    "125": "Agonist-independent properties of the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR) were studied using the baculovirus expression system in Sf9 cells. In the absence of agonist but in the presence of GTP, membranes from cells expressing the beta 2AR exhibited higher levels of cAMP production than did membranes from uninfected cells or from cells infected with wild-type baculovirus. The increase in cAMP production was proportional to the number of beta 2AR expressed, up to 40 pmol/mg of membrane protein, and it could be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by beta AR antagonists. The increase and its reversal both were independent of the possible presence of contaminating catecholamines in the culture medium and thus appear to reflect spontaneous beta 2AR activity and direct antagonist-receptor interactions, respectively. The maximal level of inhibition varied among the beta AR ligands tested, to yield the following rank order of \"inverse efficacy\"; timolol > or = propranolol > alprenolol > or = pindolol > labetalol > dichloroisoproterenol. The same rank order was observed using membranes prepared from Chinese hamster fibroblasts expressing beta 2AR. The effect of timolol was partly blocked by labetalol and dichloroisoproterenol, in an apparently competitive manner. The intracellular cAMP content of Sf9 cells cultured in serum-free medium was also increased by the expression of beta 2AR, and that increase was reversed by timolol and propranolol, consistent with observations in membrane preparations. The properties revealed by the expression of the beta 2AR in Sf9 cells suggest two agonist-independent traits of G protein-linked receptors, i.e., 1) that unliganded receptors are able to activate G proteins both in membrane preparations and in whole cells and 2) that antagonists may mediate their effects not only by preventing the binding of agonists but also by decreasing the propensity of the receptor to assume an active state.", 
    "126": "The beta 2-adrenergic receptor undergoes isomerization between an inactive conformation (R) and an active conformation (R*). The formation of the active conformation of the receptor molecule can be promoted by adrenergic agonists or by mutations in the third cytoplasmic domain that constitutively activate the receptor. Here we show that, of several beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking drugs tested, only two, ICI 118551 and betaxolol, inhibit the basal signaling activity of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor, thus acting as negative antagonists. We document the molecular properties of the more efficacious ICI 118551; (i) it shows higher affinity for the inactive form of the receptor and (ii) it inhibits the spontaneous formation of a beta-adrenergic receptor kinase substrate by the receptor. These properties are opposite those of adrenergic agonists, indicating that, in a fashion reciprocal to that of agonists, negative antagonists promote the formation of an inactive conformation of the receptor.",

The subjects were extensively profiled at supine rest, and they underwent supine bicycle ergometry before and at 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 22 hours after dosing. At these time points blood was drawn for the high performance liquid chromatographic determination of the enantiomers of carvedilol and for the radioreceptor assay determination of alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenergic receptor binding and related concentrations.", 
    "129": "Carvedilol was confirmed to bind to beta 1-adrenergic receptors and (albeit to a lesser extent) to alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. Carvedilol furthermore attenuated the ergometric increase in heart rate in a closely dose-related fashion, which exemplified its beta 1-adrenergic receptor blocking effects. However, the basal efferent adrenergic drive might have been too low to show consistent alpha 1-blocking properties. The radioreceptor and enantiomer kinetics were proportional with dose. There was no indication that the overall kinetic behavior of contributing active metabolites would differ from that of the S(-)-enantiomer. On average, there was a smooth linear relationship between the ergometric treatment responses and log-transformed dose, log-transformed concentrations of the S(-)-enantiomer, and the radioreceptor assay derived beta 1-adrenergic receptor occupancies.",

    "131": "Beta-3 adrenergic agonist administration decreases arterial blood pressure in the dog as previously shown. The putative presence of beta-3 adrenoceptors in peripheral microvascular muscle was studied in dogs through measurement of cutaneous blood flow and skin temperature changes. Experiments were carried out in normal and sinoaortic denervated dogs (i.e., animals deprived of baroreceptor pathways). In normal dogs, the infusion of 0.4 nmol/kg/min of 4-[-[(2-hydroxy-(3-chlorophenyl)ethyl)-amino]propyl] phenoxyacetate (BRL 37344) or (R,R-5-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl]-1,3- benzodioxole-2,2-dicarboxylate (CL 316243) (two selective beta-3 adrenoceptor agonists), or 8 nmol/kg/min of 4-[3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy]benzimidazol-2-one (CGP 12177) (a beta-1/beta-2 adrenergic antagonist also reported to act as an agonist for the beta-3 adrenoceptor) induced an increase in heart rate and cutaneous blood flow (evaluated in the internal part of the ear) and a decrease in blood pressure. The skin and the buccal mucous membrane became purplish. The infusion of (-)-isoproterenol (0.4 nmol/g/min), a dose known to stimulate preferentially beta-1/beta-2 adrenoceptors, or sodium nitroprusside (12 micrograms/kg/min) increased heart rate and decreased blood pressure, but reduced cutaneous blood flow. In sinoaortic denervated dogs, similar effects on cutaneous blood flow and blood pressure were observed. However, in these animals, heart rate remained unchanged whatever the infused drug. BRL 37344 (but not isoproterenol) increased cutaneous temperature in normal dogs. This study suggests that beta-3 adrenoceptors exist in canine cutaneous vascular smooth muscles and that their stimulation induces vasodilatation.",

In this study, conjunctival inflammatory antigens were investigated in impression cytology specimens from patients who have been and those who have not been treated for glaucoma.", 
    "133": "This study included 107 eyes from 55 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. Of these, 48 had received prolonged topical treatments, all containing benzalkonium chloride as a preservative. Seven glaucomatous eyes could be examined before any treatment. In addition, the authors examined 11 patients (21 eyes) receiving anticataract eye drops preserved with chlorhexidine and 15 normal untreated subjects (30 eyes). In all patients, immunocytochemistry was performed in impression cytology specimens, using two monoclonal antibodies against HLA-DR antigens and receptor to IgE CD23.", 
    "134": "None of the untreated eyes showed reactivity for either monoclonal antibody. In contrast, HLA-DR expression by conjunctival cells was found in 43 of 88 treated eyes (mean percentage of reactive cells, 70% +/- 28%) and positive staining for receptor to IgE in 26 of 68 eyes (52% +/- 28% of conjunctival cells). Results were not related to a specific treatment or combination of anti-glaucoma drugs. However, the proportion of positive specimens (3/14 for both antigens) in the group receiving chlorhexidine-containing eye drops was significantly lower than that found in the patients with glaucoma.", 
    "135": "This study showed abnormal expression of inflammatory markers without clinical inflammation at the level of conjunctival cells in repetitive contact with various anti-glaucomatous treatments and their common preservative, benzalkonium chloride. Failure in filtering glaucoma surgery was found to be related to prolonged medical treatment; therefore, a topical sensitization to preservatives and/or anti-glaucoma drugs has been hypothesized. An immunocytologic test thus could be useful for qualitative and quantitative investigation of drug-induced conjunctival inflammation and predict high-risk patients.", 
    "136": "This study was designed to determine whether functional beta 3-adrenergic receptors exist in the rat liver and whether there are alterations in the beta 3-adrenergic response with age in a manner similar to that which occurs for beta 2-adrenergic receptors. The beta 3 stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity was assessed using the novel beta 3-specific agonist, CGP-12177A. Adenylyl cyclase activation by CGP-12177A was seen only in the adults. Isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was high in the neonates, declined by 45% in the adults, and was high again in the senescent rats. ICI 118551, a beta 2-selective antagonist, attenuated the isoproterenol-stimulated activity by two-thirds but had no effect on the CGP-12177A-stimulated activity. These data demonstrated the presence of the beta 3-adrenergic receptor in the rat liver, although only at the adult stage of development. In addition, these data confirm earlier findings that beta 2-adrenergic activation of adenylyl cyclase is biphasic with age and indicate that the emergence of the beta 3-stimulated activity coincides with the attenuation of beta 2-stimulated activity.",

An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor should be considered after 72 hours of adjunctive treatment. Intravenous heparin therapy is useful in certain subsets of patients, and intravenous magnesium therapy shows promise. With the exception of beta blockers, prophylactic antiarrhythmic agents are currently not indicated.

    "142": "In all, 133 subjects suffered a CHD event during follow-up. The presence of diabetes mellitus at entry more than doubled the CHD risk and a 1 mmol l-1 increment of the serum triglyceride level at entry increased the CHD risk by 21%. In multivariate analyses, smoking, the presence of diabetes mellitus at entry, serum cholesterol and signs or symptoms of hypertensive end organ damage were found to be independent risk factors for CHD. In absolute terms the existence of cardiovascular damage was of much greater prognostic importance than were the presence of various metabolic abnormalities. Of the mean in-study variables, both the average serum cholesterol level and the achieved diastolic blood pressure were significantly associated with CHD. However, new diabetes mellitus which developed during follow-up as well as mean serum triglyceride levels were not associated with CHD.", 
    "143": "Diabetes mellitus and hypertriglyceridaemia present at the start of treatment have a prognostic impact in treated hypertensive men, whereas when such metabolic disorders develop during drug treatment they seem to be of much less importance. Smoking and already existing evidence of hypertensive end organ damage are of utmost importance for the prognosis in this type of patient.", 
    "144": "The effects of vagal stimulation on pulmonary vascular permeability were studied in guinea pigs in vivo using 125I-labeled albumin as a marker of plasma extravasation. Bilateral vagus nerve stimulation (NS) significantly increased the plasma leakage index in both parenchyma and tracheobronchial tissues. The NS-induced plasma leakage in the parenchyma was unaffected by the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine, the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine, the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium, or pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine or capsaicin, but it was significantly potentiated by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. NS-induced tracheobronchial vascular leakage was markedly inhibited by pretreatment with atropine, hexamethonium, or capsaicin, although it was unaffected by pretreatment with phentolamine, propranolol, or 6-hydroxydopamine. By itself, NG-nitro L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, had no effect on pulmonary vascular leakage, but it significantly enhanced the NS-induced plasma leakage to parenchyma in a dose-related and L-arginine-reversible manner. Elevation of blood pressure to a similar extent as that induced by L-NAME by a phenylephrine infusion had no significant effect on the increased plasma leakage induced by NS. These results suggest that vagal stimulation increases plasma extravasation in lung parenchyma through the release of unidentified transmitter(s) in a process that is modulated by endogenous NO and catecholamines (via activation of beta-adrenoceptors), and that different mechanisms are involved in the vagally induced plasma extravasation in the pulmonary and tracheobronchial vascular beds.", 
    "145": "Despite recent improvements in the management of congestive heart failure, the prognosis of many patients with this condition remains poor. The level of neurohormonal activation appears to be predictive of survival, and clinical studies indicate that inhibition of overactivated neurohormonal systems may be beneficial. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is well documented in heart failure, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition now has an established role in treatment based on evidence of hemodynamic, symptomatic and mortality benefit. Sympathetic nervous system activation also occurs as a compensatory mechanism in heart failure but with long-term deleterious effects. Increasing evidence suggests that beta-adrenergic blockade can produce hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement in heart failure of idiopathic or ischemic etiology. Trials of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients after myocardial infarction suggest a beneficial effect on mortality, even among those with heart failure. However, there remains uncertainty as to how generalizable are the results from the postinfarction trials, particularly in the current therapeutic environment with routine angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. Appropriately powered randomized, controlled trials are required to determine precisely the balance of benefit and risk resulting from long-term beta-blocker therapy in patients with heart failure of ischemic and other etiology."
