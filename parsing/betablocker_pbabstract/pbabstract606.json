    "0": "Adenosine is known to attenuate the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of norepinephrine and histamine by reducing cyclic AMP accumulation. We assessed whether adenosine, while inhibiting the cardiac responses mediated by beta and H2 receptors, leaves unmodified the responses mediated by alpha and H1 receptors. In isolated cardiac preparations from the guinea pig, adenosine antagonized the positive inotropic effect of histamine more than that of norepinephrine. This most likely occurred because, by attenuating H2 and beta responses, adenosine unmasked the H1-negative and alpha-1-positive components of the inotropic effects of histamine and norepinephrine. Consistent with this hypothesis, the pure H2 agonist impromidine appeared to be antagonized by adenosine less than histamine, and norepinephrine less than isoproterenol. In addition, adenosine antagonized the positive inotropic effect of norepinephrine in the presence of the alpha-1 blocker prazosin, whereas it did not affect the inotropic effect of phenylephrine. In the papillary muscle depolarized by 22 mM K+, adenosine antagonized the restoration of contractile responses induced by histamine or norepinephrine. This action of adenosine was reversed by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor papaverine and by the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, suggesting that adenosine attenuates beta and H2 responses by suppressing the cyclic AMP-dependent facilitation of Ca++ influx promoted by the two amines. Our data indicate that adenosine selectively attenuates H2 and beta but not alpha and H1 responses. Thus, when catecholamines, histamine and adenosine are released together, as in myocardial ischemia, in addition to their individual effects, negative inotropism, decreased impulse conduction velocity and coronary constriction (i.e., H1- and alpha-mediated responses) may result from the adenosine-histamine-norepinephrine interaction.", 
    "1": "The release of S-100 protein from epididymal fat pads was enhanced by epinephrine in vitro, and about 50% of S-100 protein in the tissue was released into the medium after 2-h incubation at 37 degrees C with 10 microM epinephrine. Similar results were obtained with the incubation of isolated adipocytes. The S-100 protein release was also enhanced by isoproterenol, norepinephrine, ACTH, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, which all increase the lipolysis by increasing cyclic AMP levels in the tissue. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, could block the increase of S-100 protein release by catecholamines, indicating that the release was mediated by the beta-adrenergic effect of catecholamines. However propranolol had no suppressive effect on the enhancement of S-100 protein release by ACTH or dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Insulin had an inhibitory effect on the epinephrine-enhanced S-100 protein release. Epinephrine or ACTH could not stimulate the S-100 protein release in the absence of Ca2+, whereas the epinephrine-enhanced glycerol release was not affected under the same conditions. The increase in S-100 protein release was induced by only a pretreatment of the tissue with epinephrine. However, the lipolysis in the tissue was not enhanced by the pretreatment alone. These results indicate that the release of S-100 protein from adipocytes is regulated by the hormones that have been known to control the lipolysis with a manner slightly different from that of lipolysis.", 
    "2": "To examine the role of neural factors in the control of coronary vasoactivity in conscious animals, dogs were supplied with miniature pressure gauges in the aorta and left ventricle (to measure aortic and left ventricular pressures, respectively and with a flow probe on the left circumflex coronary artery (to measure coronary blood flow). The experiments were conducted several weeks after recovery from operation. Stimulation of the carotid chemoreceptor and pulmonary inflation elicited a biphasic reflex response. Initially, coronary vasodilation was observed; coronary blood flow tripled even after changes in metabolic factors were minimized by pretreatment with propranolol. A similar response occurred after a spontaneous deep breath. The coronary vasodilation could be blocked by alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade. The second phase of the response involved an increase in coronary vascular resistance, associated with elevated arterial pressure and an absolute reduction in coronary blood flow and coronary sinus oxygen content. The secondary coronary vasoconstriction was also abolished by alpha-adrenergic blockade. Paradoxically, alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade with phentolamine (at constant heart rate and after beta-adrenergic receptor blockade) did not increase coronary blood flow and reduced coronary vascular resistance only slightly. Selective alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blockade with prazosin and trimazosin on different days induced progressively greater reductions in coronary vascular resistance. Trimazosin was the only alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker to elevate coronary blood flow significantly. It is conceivable, but speculative, that withdrawal of alpha-adrenergic tone may involve activation of an intermediate agent, which is a potent coronary vasodilator. Alternatively, withdrawal of alpha-adrenergic tone may be an important mechanism for immediate control of the coronary circulation, but under more chronic conditions it plays a lesser role as a result of suppression by metabolic factors.", 
    "3": "A cAMP-dependent protein kinase occurs in the intermediate lobe of the rat pituitary gland and the ACTH-secreting tumor AtT-20/D16-16 derived from the mouse pituitary gland. Exposure of either tissue to drugs increasing cAMP production and hormone release (forskolin, cholera toxin, or isoproterenol in the case of the intermediate lobe; forskolin or isoproterenol in the case of the AtT-20 cells) increases the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity of a tissue homogenate in the absence, but not in the presence, of added cAMP. The potencies of these drugs to induce changes in the protein kinase activity ratio (i.e. enzyme activity in the absence of cAMP to enzyme activity in the presence of 3 microM cAMP) are comparable with their potencies as stimulants of hormone secretion. In either tissue, A23187, a calcium ionophore that stimulates hormone release but not cAMP production, does not change the protein kinase activity ratio. In the case of the AtT-20 cells, dexamethasone blocks the release of ACTH simulated by either isoproterenol or forskolin, but does not alter the enhancement of protein kinase activity induced by these drugs. Conversely, dexamethasone does not block the A23187-stimulated release of ACTH. The data suggest that cAMP modulates (but does not trigger) hormone secretion from the rodent pituitary gland by a mechanism involving activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Several possible sites for this modulatory effect of cAMP are discussed.", 
    "4": "Labyrinthine stimulation and cold pain inhibit feeding antral pressure activity, delay gastric emptying, and increase blood concentrations of beta-endorphin and norepinephrine. Further, labyrinthine stimulation induces, in approximately one-third of healthy individuals, a migrating burst of motor activity in the proximal intestine that interrupts the normal fed pattern. Our hypothesis was that endogenous opiates and catecholamines act as mediators of such disruptive effects of centrally acting stressful stimuli on gut motility. Thus, we studied feeding gastrointestinal pressure activity in healthy volunteers who were exposed to labyrinthine stimulation or cold pressure test, or both (both stimuli being either in their active or in their control forms), while receiving an intravenous infusion of either placebo (saline), or an opioid blocker (naloxone), or a combination of alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers (phentolamine and propranolol), or all the drugs together. Neither opioid nor adrenergic blockers affected motility during control stimulations. Active stressful stimuli (labyrinthine stimulation, cold pain, or both) significantly inhibited antral feeding activity (p less than 0.05), but these effects were prevented by concomitant infusion of naloxone (p less than 0.05). Adrenergic blockade also prevented the antral motor inhibition caused by stress (p less than 0.05), but it was more effective for cold pain than for labyrinthine stimulation, and, when performed concomitantly with opiate blockade, the preventive effects disappeared. Furthermore, during adrenergic blockade labyrinthine stimulation invariably induced the appearance of a migrating duodenal burst of motor activity. Neither opioid nor adrenergic blockers modified the stress-induced rise of plasma beta-endorphin and norepinephrine. Our results suggest that opioids and catecholamines are involved in the mediation of the disruptive effects induced by centrally acting stressful stimuli on postprandial motor activity in the proximal human gut.", 
    "5": "With the advancement of surgical techniques and myocardial protection we can expect that patients previously felt to be inoperable because of poor ventricular function will be surgical candidates. This group of patients will on occasion develop severe left ventricular dysfunction in the peri-operative period. Optimum management in this setting will require acquisition of haemodynamic data, assessment of ventricular loading conditions and inotropic state and the selection of appropriate drug therapy. Drugs are available with specific haemodynamic profiles and therapy is enhanced by matching the abnormal haemodynamics of patients with an appropriate therapeutic agent. If the patient fails to respond quickly to pharmacotherapy, consideration should be directed toward use of an intra-aortic balloon pump.", 
    "6": "The dopamine alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor dose-response curves are investigated in four patients who are exempt from cardiovascular disease. A dose-related increase in CO, HR and SV is observed with infusion rates of up to 3 micrograms kg-1 min-1. With concentrations greater than 10 micrograms kg-1 min-1, both BP and SVR increase. Low-dose dopamine infusion less than 3 micrograms kg-1 min-1 is investigated in ten other patients. With this infusion rate, a selective renal vasodilation is induced without peripheral or cardiac beta-adrenoceptor activation. Dopamine is responsible for an increase in diuresis FENa, GFR and RBF. These properties are indicated in renal failure, and when haemodynamic support is required in cardiac failure, if an infusion rate of up to 10 micrograms kg-1 min-1 is able to reverse cardiac insufficiency.", 
    "7": "The effects of activating the coeruleocortical pathway on responses of cingulate cortical cells to substance P was determined in the rat. The pathway was activated by means of small injections of glutamate, via a stereotaxically positioned cannula, directly into the locus coeruleus. Such injections greatly reduced the excitatory responses of cortical cells evoked by the iontophoretic application of substance P. Variation in the dorsal and lateral sites of injection suggested that the locus coeruleus was the important position for eliciting these effects. Depletion of cortical noradrenaline greatly reduced the ability of these injections to inhibit the substance P responses. Injections of glutamate into the locus coeruleus did not reduce cortical cell responses to acetylcholine. Parenteral administration of propranolol but not phenoxybenzamine blocked the effects of the glutamate injections on the substance P responses. These data support our previous suggestion that the central noradrenergic system may have a functional inhibitory effect on responsiveness to substance P in the cingulate cortex.", 
    "8": "Microsphere estimates of whole body hemodynamics and tissue blood flow were made in conscious and pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs treated orally with the peripheral vasodilator minoxidil. Under both circumstances, 1.0-30 mg/kg minoxidil significantly reduced mean arterial pressure 21-41% and total peripheral resistance 52-75% 4 h after administration. Dose-dependent increases in heart rate and cardiac output were evident under conscious conditions, with both parameters approximately doubling at 1.0 mg/kg. The near maximal vasodilation achieved with this dose of minoxidil was due to diminished vascular resistance in all major tissue beds. The enhanced cardiac output was associated with significant 50-87% increases in blood flow to the skin, skeletal muscle, bone, stomach, large intestine, and pancreas. Far more dramatic six- to 10-fold increases in regional myocardial blood flow were seen at this dose, which appeared to be only partially dependent on increased cardiac work. Comparable blood flow patterns were seen with acute minoxidil at doses greater than 1.0 mg/kg, and with chronic minoxidil at 1.0 and 30 mg/kg/day. These experiments establish minoxidil's relative vasodilation in the major tissue beds of the dog which contributes to its hypotensive activity.", 
    "9": "The hemodynamic and cardiac beta-blocking effects of ASL-8052 (esmolol), an ultrashort-acting beta-blocker, were examined in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. The compound produced dose-dependent reductions in heart rate, left ventricular dP/dt, right ventricular contractile force, and diastolic arterial blood pressure in dogs with intact autonomic function. ASL-8052 was devoid of any hemodynamic effects in ganglion-blocked animals. Responses to isoproterenol (except for diastolic blood pressure) were blocked by ASL-8052 in qualitatively similar fashion in both groups of animals. The compound reduced the rate-pressure product and decreased diastolic coronary blood flow. The reactive hyperemic response to a 10-s occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery was not modified by ASL-8052. Heart rate and contractile force dose-response curves to isoproterenol were equally shifted to the right in a dose-dependent, parallel fashion by constant infusion of ASL-8052. During infusion of large doses in reserpinized dogs, the compound decreased heart rate, contractility, and arterial blood pressure, while left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased. No intrinsic sympathomimetic effect was observed. Tachycardia induced by either stimulation of the right ansa subclavia or intravenous injection of isoproterenol was blocked to an equivalent degree by ASL-8052. These data indicate that ASL-8052 produces hemodynamic effects that are characteristic of and explained by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. However, direct cardiac depression is observed at extremely high doses.", 
    "10": "Selective beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists were used to characterize the beta-adrenoceptor subtypes in human right atrium. The activity order of selective agonists for rat, guinea pig, and rabbit atrial inotropic and chronotropic responses was consistent with the hypothesis that only beta 1-adrenoceptors mediate these responses. In human right atrium, however, the beta 2-selective agonists fenoterol and salbutamol were relatively much more active. The beta 1-selective antagonist practolol preferentially antagonized the human atrial response to noradrenaline (beta 1-selective) as opposed to fenoterol (beta 2-selective), whereas the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 preferentially antagonized the response to fenoterol. The data indicate that the response of human right atrium to beta-adrenoceptor agonists is mediated by a mixed beta 1-plus beta 2-adrenoceptor population. The implications of these results with respect to the therapeutic uses of beta-adrenoceptor agonists are discussed.", 
    "11": "Studies were undertaken to ascertain whether metoprolol, a beta 1-selective adrenergic blocking agent, could offer a limitation of myocardial injury throughout a 24-h period of coronary embolization in the dog. Regional myocardial ischaemia was induced through the use of a bead embolization technique which did not require thoracotomy. In order to delineate the zone at risk of infarction (hypoperfused area), radioactive microspheres (141Ce) were administered intraventricularly immediately after embolization. In the drug-treated group (n = 8) metoprolol administration was initiated by an intravenous bolus injection (0.3 mg X kg-1). This was followed by a continuous infusion (0.003 mg X kg-1 X min-1) during the 24-h experimental period. In the control group (n = 8) saline was administered throughout the 24-h period. Electrocardiographic activity was monitored throughout the experiment and this confirmed the negative chronotropic and antiarrhythmic properties of metoprolol. After 24 h, the hearts were excised and transverse myocardial sections (3 mm) prepared. Areas of necrosis were visualized by tetrazolium staining and risk zones were defined by microsphere autoradiography. In the control and metoprolol-treated groups, 73.3 +/- 7.7% and 68.2 +/- 6.1% of the risk zone became necrotic, respectively. There was no significant difference between these groups.", 
    "12": "We investigated properties of catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase in membranes from human right atria. Basal adenylate cyclase was activated by Mg2+-ions and guanyl nucleotides [Gpp(NH)p, GTP] in a concentration-dependent manner; guanyl nucleotide activation was strongly dependent on the presence of Mg2+-ions. Catecholamines stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the following order of potency: (-)-isoprenaline greater than (-)-adrenaline = (-)-noradrenaline greater than phenylephrine, indicating that, in human right atrium, beta 1-adrenoceptors predominate. The beta 1-agonist dobutamine and the beta 2-agonists fenoterol and procaterol activated adenylate cyclase with an intrinsic activity of 0.5-0.7 (isoprenaline = 1.0). Adenylate cyclase activation by dobutamine or procaterol was not additive with the activation induced by isoprenaline. On the contrary, combination of dobutamine (100 microM) and procaterol (10 microM) resulted in activation of adenylate cyclase which was not different from that evoked by saturating concentration of isoprenaline (10 microM), indicating that dobutamine (beta 1) and procaterol (beta 2) produce adenylate cyclase activation through stimulation of different beta-adrenoceptor subtypes. The beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 was much more potent in inhibiting procaterol-than isoprenaline-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, whereas the beta 1-selective antagonist betaxolol inhibited isoprenaline-stimulated activity more potently. We conclude that in human right atrium, both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors are functionally coupled to the adenylate cyclase system.", 
    "13": "The beta-adrenoceptor activity of the newly synthesized antagonist bisoprolol [+/-)-1-[4-(2-isopropoxyethoxymethyl)-phenoxy]-3-isopropylamino-2- propranol, hemifumarate), has been compared with the effect of several reference compounds in anesthetized dogs and guinea pigs. In anesthetized, bivagotomized dogs, isoprenaline dose-response relations for increase in heart rate and decrease in diastolic blood pressure were established. Bisoprolol had the largest beta 1/beta 2 ratio, i.e., 147 (102-292). Practolol showed a beta 1/beta 2 ratio greater than 17; betaxolol 6-15; acebutolol, atenolol, and metoprolol 1.1-3.2; mepindolol 0.6-1 and propranolol 0.2. In artificially ventilated guinea pigs, the activity of bisoprolol on histamine-induced increase in tracheal lateral pressure (TLP) and basal heart rate (HR) was tested: using doses taken at TLP (30 mm Hg) and HR (250 beats/min), bisoprolol exhibited the most pronounced ratio TLP/HR of 124 +/- 59, followed by atenolol 33 +/- 23, metoprolol 25 +/- 15, betaxolol 12 +/- 4, propranolol 1 +/- 0.3, and celiprolol 0.23 +/- 0.19. These experiments indicate that bisoprolol possesses a pronounced beta 1-selectivity, which seems to be superior to that of known beta 1-selective antagonists.", 
    "14": "The electrocardiographic responses to programmed ventricular stimulation and acute posterolateral myocardial ischemia were studied in conscious dogs treated with the resolved optical isomers of sotalol. Studies were conducted 3-7 days after anterior myocardial infarction to determine the relative contributions of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade and direct Class III electrophysiologic actions in the antiarrhythmic and antifibrillatory actions of the isomers. With cumulative i.v. administration of up to 8 mg/kg, both the beta-blocking levorotatory isomer and the dextrorotatory isomer suppressed the induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias by programmed stimulation in at least 50% of dogs tested. Both isomers produced equivalent 15-20% increases in normal zone ventricular refractoriness, thereby preventing propagation of programmed ventricular extrastimuli of sufficient prematurity to elicit tachyarrhythmias. The levorotatory isomer of sotalol prolonged the PR interval; the administration of the dextrorotatory isomer increased QTc and, in several dogs, was associated with the development of ventricular ectopy. The prior administration of 8 mg/kg of either optical isomer of sotalol prevented the immediate spontaneous development of ventricular fibrillation in response to ischemia at a distance from the previous site of infarction. These results suggest that alterations in ventricular refractoriness may underlie the antiarrhythmic and antifibrillatory actions of the optical isomers of sotalol and of racemic sotalol.", 
    "15": "In vitro studies have demonstrated that AR-L 115BS (AR-L), a new orally active nonglycosidic inotropic agent with vasodilator properties, does not act via adrenergic receptors. However, because AR-L is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and interaction with the adrenergic nervous system may exist in vivo, we compared the actions of intravenous AR-L, isoproterenol, and propranolol, alone and in combination, in normal dogs. In seven awake morphine-sedated dogs, AR-L (4 mg/kg i.v.) did not alter circulating catecholamines despite increasing maximum rate of change of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) by 76%. In anesthetized dogs, peak inotropic effect of AR-L occurred at 6 mg/kg (dP/dt from 5,450 +/- 1,280 to 12,000 +/- 3,050 mm Hg/s). Propranolol (1 mg/kg) depressed dP/dt from 5,725 +/- 2,032 to 2,530 +/- 631 mm Hg/s, and this was completely reversed by increasing doses of AR-L (2-30 mg/kg) but the maximum dP/dt attained in these dogs (6,050 +/- 221 mm Hg/s) remained below the level achieved by AR-L in the absence of propranolol. To determine if that difference was due to an interaction of AR-L with the adrenergic nervous system, the effect of AR-L on isoproterenol activity was studied in groups of beta-blocked and unblocked animals. In either group, the dose-response curve of dP/dt to isoproterenol was shifted upward by AR-L, but the actions of the two drugs were additive without real synergism (e.g., after propranolol:isoproterenol 10 micrograms/min 73%; AR-L 6 mg/kg 81%; both 160%. In unblocked dogs, the results were: isoproterenol 2 micrograms/min 96%; AR-L 1 mg/min 39%; both 138%). Similarly, isoproterenol and AR-L were only additive in their effects on heart rate and systemic vascular resistance. Thus, although AR-L is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, its predominant mechanism of action appears to be independent of the adrenergic nervous system.", 
    "16": "The induction of yeast diploid meiotic products by treatment with bleomycin and mitomycin C is reduced when sporulating cells are treated in combination with propranolol, and increased when they are treated in combination with caffeine. We show that bleomycin and mitomycin C act by blocking the second meiotic division. The frequency of this event appears to be directly related to the intracellular cAMP concentration which is known to be influenced in opposite ways by caffeine and propranolol.", 
    "17": "The conservative management of supraventricular tachycardias is briefly surveyed and described. For exact treatment a description of different ways of origin of tachycardias such as focal activity or reentry-mechanisms is given. A diagram at the end shows the site of influence of different antiarrhythmic drugs in the atria and the AV-node as well as the accessory pathways in preexcitation. A list of antiarrhythmics according to their classification of Vaughan Williams and of Tournboul completes this survey.", 
    "18": "In order to characterize the postjunctional beta-adrenoceptors in the rat gastric fundus, we studied the influence of beta-agonists and beta-antagonists on methacholine-contracted fundus strips. The mixed beta-agonist isopropylnoradrenaline and the beta 2-selective agonist fenoterol had a concentration-dependent relaxing effect and at higher concentrations completely inhibited the methacholine-induced tone. The reputedly beta 1-selective agonist prenalterol only produced about 50% inhibition and another reputedly beta 1-selective agonist, tazolol, had almost no relaxing effect. The beta-antagonists propranolol (beta 1 + beta 2), practolol (beta 1), H35/25 (beta 2) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2) all shifted the concentration-response curves for isopropylnoradrenaline and fenoterol in a parallel way to the right, but the slope of the Schild plot was not significantly different from 1 only for the antagonism of isopropylnoradrenaline by H35/25. The relaxing effect of prenalterol was only clearly antagonized by ICI 118,551. The results suggest that postjunctional beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors are present in the rat gastric fundus.", 
    "19": "The alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in guinea-pig nasal mucosa were measured for the first time by direct binding techniques using [3H]prazosin, [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB). The maximum binding capacities of [3H]prazosin, [3H]DHA and [3H]QNB in guinea-pig nasal mucosa were 20.1, 42.3, 159 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The dissociation constants of [3H]prazosin, [3H]DHA and [3H]QNB in guinea-pig nasal mucosa were 0.37, 0.77 and 1.5 nM, respectively. After the removal of the superior cervical ganglion in the guinea-pig, the number of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors was increased in the nasal mucosa while the number of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors remained unchanged. Thus, alpha 1-adrenergic receptors are probably postsynaptic receptors in the target cells of sympathetic nerves, while beta receptors relate to the circulating catecholamines.", 
    "20": "Methacholine (Mch), when injected near the ostia of the coronary arteries, induces an intense coronary vasospasm which can be measured by the degree of S wave elevation monitored from an electrocardiogram (ECG). The observed ECG changes resemble those occurring in patients with variant angina. The effects of Mch were blocked by atropine, but not by d-tubocurarine, hexamethonium, adrenergic receptor blockade, or prior reserpinization, indicating that Mch is acting directly on muscarinic receptors to produce a vasoconstriction of the coronary arteries. This model of Mch-induced coronary vasospasm appears to be useful for testing spasmolytic agents which might be of benefit in variant angina.", 
    "21": "Chronic treatment of rats with the MAOI clorgyline significantly reduced the density (Bmax) of cortical beta-adrenergic receptors but did not alter either the Bmax or dissociation constant (Kd) of 3H-spiperone binding to striatal DA receptors. Clorgyline co-treatment also did not significantly affect either behavioral supersensitivity to apomorphine or the increase in 3H-spiperone binding induced by chronic haloperidol. In contrast, repeated treatment with the DA uptake inhibitor amfonelic acid elicited behavioral subsensitivity and reduced striatal 3H-spiperone binding. Furthermore, amfonelic acid co-treatment prevented haloperidol-induced behavioral and receptor binding changes. The possible relevance of these findings in relation to drug choice in clinical trials of receptor sensitivity modification are discussed.", 
    "22": "Using renal arteries from young (6 months), mature (18 months) and old (70 months) rabbits, the effect of dopamine on 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) generation was studied. No significant differences in basal adenylate cyclase values were found in homogenates of renal artery from young, mature or old rabbits. The protein content of the renal artery was also unchanged during the lifespan. Dopamine stimulated the production of cAMP. The stimulatory effect of dopamine was similar in the renal artery of young and mature rabbits but was lower by about 40% in old rabbits. The present results led us to hypothesize an impairment of the peripheral dopaminergic system in old age similar to that described for the central dopaminergic system.", 
    "23": "A trial of intravenous followed by oral propranolol, started within 4 h of onset of suspected myocardial infarction and continued over 27 h, was carried out in 735 patients; 364 received propranolol, 371 were controls. Ventricular fibrillation during the first 48 h after entry to the trial occurred in 2 treated patients and in 14 controls (p = 0.006). Rates of hospital mortality, complications other than ventricular fibrillation, and progression from threatened to completed infarction did not differ between treated and control patients. Ventricular fibrillation was not apparently prevented by prior beta-blocker treatment, which was not a reason for exclusion from the trial. This intravenous/oral propranolol regimen seems to prevent ventricular fibrillation due to evolving myocardial infarction.", 
    "24": "Norepinephrine, briefly superfused during high-frequency stimulation of the mossy fibers in the rat hippocampal slice in vitro, produced a reversible increase in the magnitude, duration, and probability of induction of long-term synaptic potentiation in the CA3 subfield. Similar results were obtained with isoproterenol, whereas propranolol or timolol reversibly blocked long-term potentiation. Norepinephrine had little apparent effect on responses obtained during low-frequency stimulation of the mossy fibers. These data suggest that norepinephrine can mediate long-lasting, frequency-dependent modulation of synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain. Furthermore, the results suggest a plausible mechanism for some of the known associative interactions between synaptic inputs to hippocampal neurons.", 
    "25": "The obstetric implications of the use of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol have been evaluated in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study involving 120 women with pregnancy-associated hypertension. The clinical interpretation of antenatal and intrapartum cardiotocographs was uninfluenced by atenolol. Human placental lactogen concentration fell in the atenolol group, but this was not an indicator of subsequent fetal distress. Other obstetric indices, such as urinary estriol excretion, were the same in both groups. Spontaneous premature labor occurred in five women receiving placebo but in none who received atenolol. Together with previously reported findings on pregnancy outcome, our study leads us to conclude that beta-blockers such as atenolol can appropriately be used in the management of hypertension during pregnancy.", 
    "26": "To clarify the mechanisms of O2- formation by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), the effects of clinically employed drugs on PMNs were investigated by measuring changes in membrane potential and rates of O2- production. These variables were effectively diminished with antihistaminic agents, adrenergic beta-antagonists, and antiarrhythmic drugs when guinea pig peritoneal PMNs were stimulated by either phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). The order of potency of the inhibitory effects of these chemicals on the PMA-induced O2- formation was as follows: azelastine (IC50 = 4.1 microM) less than clemastine less than dl-propranolol less than chlorpheniramine maleate less than dichlorisoproterenol less than quinidine less than diphenhydramine less than indomethacin (IC50 greater than 400 microM). Similar phenomena were observed when FMLP was employed instead of PMA, but the FMLP-stimulated O2- production was effectively inhibited by indomethacin. Changes in membrane potential, using the cyanin dye method, also indicated that most of these drugs cancelled functional changes of plasma membrane of PMNs. From these observations, it was demonstrated that changes in membrane potential by the stimuli were essential for the initiation of O2- generation from plasma membrane of PMNs, although the initiation mechanisms were not identical for the two stimuli.", 
    "27": "A new compound, designated clonidine-displacing substance (CDS), has been isolated from calf brain by ion-exchange chromatography, zone electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography. CDS binds specifically to alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in rat brain and human platelet membranes, as measured in direct binding experiments using [3H]clonidine and [3H]yohimbine respectively. Unlike clonidine or other alpha 2-agonists, CDS does not affect basal levels of adenylate cyclase in human platelets at the highest concentrations obtainable. The apparent molecular mass of the compound is estimated to be 500 +/- 50 Da, as determined by gel-filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-15. The new compound is thermostable, not affected by proteolytic enzymes, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, pronase, papain and pyroglutamase, or by boiling in 0.2 M HCl for 5 min. It does not bind to alpha 1-receptors in rat brain or to beta-adrenergic receptors in turkey erythrocytes, since it is unable to displace [3H]prazosin and [125I]cyanopindolol from alpha 1 and beta-receptors respectively.", 
    "28": "The development of beta-adrenergic receptors in the developing rat brain was followed for the whole brain, the cortex and the cerebellum. The probe used was 125I-cyanopindolol. Through the use of this probe, the kinetics of appearance of beta-receptors was found to be different from that reported using 125I-hydroxybenzylpindolol as a probe. Also, the number of 125I-cyanopindolol sites is different from the number of 125I-hydroxybenzylpindolol sites. These differences are attributed to the difference in pharmacological specificity of the two ligands. 125I-cyanopindolol binds exclusively to beta-receptors, whereas 125I-hydroxybenzylpindolol binds to both beta-receptors and serotonin receptors. The ontogenesis of GppNHp dependent adenylate cyclase and of Mn2+/forskolin dependent adenylate cyclase indicate that the rate of synthesis of the catalytic component is faster than that of the GTP stimulatory component.", 
    "29": "Basal plasma renin activity (PRA) was not modified by pertussis toxin administration. On the contrary, the modulation of PRA by adrenergic amines was markedly affected by the toxin. Administration of epinephrine did not modified PRA in the controls but markedly increased it in toxin-treated rats. This effect of epinephrine was reproduced in control rats when yohimbine was given before the catecholamine. Clonidine decreased PRA to a much more significant extent in control rats than in animals treated with the toxin. Isoproterenol stimulated PRA to a greater level in toxin-treated rats. Our data indicates that pertussis toxin blocks the alpha 2-adrenergic modulation of renin release and magnifies the ability of beta adrenergic activation to stimulate PRA.", 
    "30": "The use of beta adrenoceptor blockade in the treatment of rest angina is controversial, and the effects on severe angina of partial agonist activity in beta blockers are unknown. Eight patients with effort angina and seven with effort and nocturnal angina and severe coronary artery disease were studied initially when they were not taking any antianginal drugs. Pindolol 5 mg thrice daily (with partial agonist activity) and atenolol 100 mg daily (without partial agonist activity) were given for five days each in a double blind randomised manner. Diaries of angina were kept and treadmill exercise testing and ambulatory ST monitoring performed during the last 48 hours of each period of treatment. Daytime and nocturnal resting heart rates and the frequency of angina were significantly reduced by atenolol compared with pindolol (p less than 0.01). The duration of exercise was significantly increased and the frequency, duration, and magnitude of daytime and nocturnal episodes of ST segment depression on ambulatory monitoring were reduced by atenolol. Reduction in resting heart rate is important in the treatment of both effort and nocturnal angina. Partial agonist activity in beta adrenoceptor antagonists may be deleterious in patients with severe angina pectoris.", 
    "31": "Eight healthy probands received 1.0 to 1.3 g ethanol per kg body weight within a period of 30 minutes. The average hourly elimination rate of ethanol during the postresorptive phase was found to be 0.18 g/l. No significant increase in the elimination rate was seen either after administration of 200 mg metoprolol per day in slow release form for a period of one week, or after a single dose of 200 mg metoprolol in standard formulation taken at the beginning of ethanol ingestion. On the other hand, long-term administration of metoprolol resulted in a steeper rise and a delayed decrease of blood alcohol concentration. Simultaneous intake of metoprolol and of alcohol in high dosage should be avoided.", 
    "32": "We have investigated the relationship between the catecholamine-induced occurrence in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells of beta-adrenergic receptors that exhibit low apparent affinity for hydrophilic ligands in short-time assays with intact cells and a population of beta-adrenergic receptors that migrate in a light vesicle fraction on sucrose density gradients. Pretreatment of cells with concanavalin A prevents the generation of both of these forms of the receptor during incubation with agonists but does not prevent the agonist-induced decrease in isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP production that also occurs during desensitization. Selective labeling of the low affinity beta-receptors with 125I-pindolol followed by centrifugation on sucrose density gradients revealed that all of the receptors in the light vesicle fraction from desensitized cells were of the low affinity type, but that a portion of the low affinity receptors also migrated in a heavier sucrose fraction together with the plasma membrane. In contrast, in control cells, no low affinity receptors were present in the heavy sucrose fractions. The agonist-induced occurrence of these various forms of the beta-adrenergic receptor can be explained on the basis of current models of desensitization involving agonist-induced internalization of beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "33": "The response of pre- and postsynaptic beta-adrenoreceptors to depletion of brain norepinephrine (NE) with reserpine in the rat was characterized by studying the anterograde and retrograde axonal transport of presynaptic receptors and the receptor binding changes induced in postsynaptic frontal cortex cells. Anterograde transport was shown to occur by the linear accumulation of [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) binding sites (by in vitro binding assay) proximal to a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion placed in the ascending pathway of the locus coeruleus and was blocked by more proximal lesions in the pathway. Retrograde transport was demonstrated by the accumulation of [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding distal to similar lesions. Autoradiograms from sections of 6-OHDA injected brains were produced with [3H]DHA binding in the presence of the beta 2-agonist, zinterol, and suggested that the anterograde accumulation of binding sites was primarily of the beta 1-subtype. A single injection of reserpine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a long lasting (6-8 weeks), biphasic decrease in cortical NE levels with nadirs and 4 and 28 days (10% and 45% of control, respectively). Frontal cortex binding of [3H]DHA increased to a maximum at 7-14 days and again at 28 days post-reserpine (230% and 167% of control, respectively). These increases were not prevented by the destruction of presynaptic noradrenergic nerve terminals with intraventricular administration of 6-OHDA 1 day prior to sacrifice and therefore appeared to take place solely in postsynaptic cells. Presynaptic, anterograde axonal transport of beta-receptors was completely blocked from 4-14 days post-reserpine, increased to 323% of control at 21 days, was blocked again at 6 weeks and returned to control by 8 weeks. Retrograde transport of beta-receptors followed a similar pattern suggesting that the presynaptic alterations in beta-receptors in noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus take place independently from those in postsynaptic cortical beta-receptors as a response to NE depletion by reserpine.", 
    "34": "The central effect of urapidil on mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and reflex tachycardia was studied in anesthetized normotensive and Goldblatt hypertensive dogs and anesthetized cats. The administration of 1 mg intracisternally of urapidil decreased blood pressure and heart rate in normotensive dogs, whereas 2 and 4 mg decreased heart rate and returned blood pressure to the control level. Reflex tachycardia evoked by the intravenous administration of bradykinin was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by urapidil. In the anesthetized cat, urapidil was administered intracisternally (50 to 400 micrograms) and had no effect on heart rate. The reflex bradycardia elicited by central vagal nerve stimulation was accentuated by urapidil given intracisternally, but this only occurred in the presence of beta adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol.", 
    "35": "Our recent Veterans Administration Cooperative Study--involving 683 hypertensive male patients--showed that a diuretic was more effective than a beta blocker in controlling hypertension in most respects. In addition, in this study we failed to find evidence that thiazide-induced hypokalemia was associated with increased evidence of cardiac arrhythmias in patients without overt heart disease. We are concerned that the current desire to avoid hypokalemia at all costs may result in the prescription of ineffective dosages of diuretics for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "36": "Renal compensatory mechanisms are a chief consideration when selecting an antihypertensive agent. The relationships, therefore, between renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, sodium handling by the kidney, and release of renin require particular attention. We shall examine therapeutic measures such as beta adrenergic blockers, vasodilators, calcium entry blockers, and converting enzyme inhibitors in light of their effects on renal blood flow.", 
    "37": "At present more than 20 beta-adrenergic blocking drugs are commercially available in Western Europe, and six are available in the United States. The clinical indications for their usage include hypertension, arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease, thyrotoxicosis, migraine headaches, glaucoma, and anxiety states. We will review the mechanisms suggested for the antihypertensive action of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs as well as these agents' clinical pharmacologic aspects. In general, the pharmacodynamic effects of the beta blocking drugs are quite similar, yet the properties of biotransformation, including pharmacokinetics, tend to be distinguishing features.", 
    "38": "Agents that work primarily by inhibiting effects of the sympathetic nervous system continue to be widely used for the therapy of hypertension. There are two principal types of drugs: those that work in the central nervous system, and those that act primarily at peripheral neuromuscular sites. Both types of drugs are often effective as single-agent therapy although they also work well in combination with diuretics and other antihypertensive agents. Recently, there has been interest in a new transdermal method for administering the centrally-acting drug clonidine; the consistency of the plasma drug concentrations achieved by this form of treatment appears to minimize adverse effects while providing continuous therapeutic efficacy. Interest is also focusing on the ability of sympathoinhibitory agents such as alpha-methyldopa to produce regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, possibly by mechanisms independent of their antihypertensive action.", 
    "39": "An oral diuretic has been the most popular step-one drug for the treatment of hypertension in the United States for more than 15 years. Diuretics have many of the attributes of the ideal step-one drug: they are inexpensive, easy to titrate, effective in a large percentage of patients with mild to moderate hypertension, well tolerated, and they enhance the effectiveness of other antihypertensive drugs. Recently, concerns about the safety of diuretics have been raised. All of the placebo-controlled trials that have demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have used an oral diuretic as step one. Diuretics have more desirable attributes for step-one antihypertensive therapy than any of the alternatives. In the absence of a specific indication for another antihypertensive drug, diuretics in low dosage should continue to be the step-one drug of choice for treating most hypertensive patients.", 
    "40": "The effects of different adrenergic agents on high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration and on the neutral NaCl-resistant triacylglycerol hydrolase (liver lipase) activity of the liver were studied in rats. Treatment of rats with the beta-blockers metoprolol, atenolol or propranolol led to a lowering of the HDL-cholesterol (esterified and non-esterified) content. The alpha 1-antagonist prazosin had no effect. Administration of norepinephrine for 10 days resulted in an increase of HDL non-esterified cholesterol. This effect of norepinephrine was largely abolished by prazosin, but not by propranolol. In normal rats the liver lipase activity was not influenced by alpha- or beta-blockade. Adrenergic stimulation, either short-term (by diethyl ether stress) or long-term (by norepinephrine treatment), led to a lowered liver lipase activity. The lipase activity was restored by prazosin but not by propranolol. The apparent involvement of the alpha 1-receptor in the regulation of liver lipase activity was further studied in vitro. Blockade of alpha- or beta-receptors with prazosin or propranolol did not affect the secretion of the liver lipase activity by isolated parenchymal liver cells. Stimulation of alpha- or beta-receptors by epinephrine led to a lower secreted lipase activity. Selective stimulation by isoprenaline had no effect. The effect of epinephrine could be abolished by prazosin but not by propranolol. Vasopressin and the calcium ionophore A23187 also lowered the secretion of liver lipase activity in vitro. Glucagon and/or the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro 20-1724 had no effect. These results indicate an involvement of the alpha 1-receptor in the regulation of liver lipase activity at the level of synthesis or secretion of the lipase. The effect of the alpha 1-receptor is presumably mediated through changes in the intracellular free calcium concentration. The effect of adrenergic modulation on HDL-cholesterol concentrations can partly be explained through modification of the liver lipase activity.", 
    "41": "The increase of nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration in plasma was observed in rats subjected to hypokinesia for 1-60 days. In the period of recovery (7 and 21 days after 60 days immobilization) the content of NEFA returned to control values. The increase of fatty acid release from adipose tissue was observed in hypokinetic rats, however the stimulation of lipolysis by norepinephrine was lower in rats exposed to hypokinesis. The decrease of the binding capacity and a diminished number of beta-adrenergic receptors were found in animals after hypokinesia. The augmentation of the incorporation of glucose into lipids and the marked increase in the stimulation of lipogenesis by insulin were found in adipose tissue of rats subjected to long-term hypokinesia. These results showed an important effect of hypokinesia on lipid mobilization, on lipogenesis and on the processes of hormone regulation in adipose tissue.", 
    "42": "The effects of epinephrine on the vascularity of tumors within the liver of rats were studied by simultaneous injection of Microfil into the arterial and portal systems. A marked increase in perfusion of capillary-sized vessels within the central portions of the tumor was observed in both induced hepatomas and implanted Walker carcinosarcoma tumors. In studies with implanted tumors, the effect of epinephrine on enhancing vascularity internally was eliminated by the alpha adrenergic block agent phenoxybenzamine, but was not affected by the beta adrenergic blocking agent propranolol.", 
    "43": "Fifty-three patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who had serious arrhythmias (45 patients), refractory chest pain (5 patients) or a high risk of sudden death (3 patients) received amiodarone for 6 to 96 months (median 18) after completion of a loading and an initial maintenance period. The dose of amiodarone was altered by 50 to 200 mg/day at 3- to 6-month intervals, guided by electrocardiographic monitoring, plasma drug level measurements and side-effect questionnaires. Ventricular tachycardia was suppressed in 24 patients (92%) with doses of 100 to 400 mg/day (median 300); none died suddenly during a mean follow-up of 27 months. Although symptomatic episodes of frequent or prolonged supraventricular tachycardia or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter were abolished in 8 of 9 patients on 100 to 600 mg/day (median 300), in 1 patient incessant atrial flutter developed that was relatively refractory to direct-current cardioversion. In 11 patients with atrial fibrillation, sinus rhythm was restored in 7 (after direct-current cardioversion in 3) with doses of 100 to 600 mg/day (median 300) and has been maintained in 5 with associated improvement in symptoms. Despite discontinuation of beta-blocker therapy, chest pain was unchanged in 17 patients, was impaired in 11 and was worse in only 2. Amiodarone was discontinued in 3 patients; in 1 because of hair loss, in 1 because of neurologic symptoms and in 1 because of facial discoloration; in the latter 2 patients, amiodarone was restarted after 1 and 14 months, and was tolerated and effective at the lower dosage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "A patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was found to have a chronic intravascular haemolytic anaemia. After investigation this was attributed to the abnormal haemodynamics of the cardiac disease. Treatment with propranolol was associated with an improvement in the anaemia. No further cases of haemolytic anaemia were found in 37 other patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It is concluded that haemolytic anaemia is a very rare feature of the condition.", 
    "45": "Torsade de pointes is an uncommon ventricular tachyarrhythmia precipitated by a variety of metabolic and pharmacological conditions and requiring unconventional antiarrhythmic therapy. A case is presented demonstrating the occurrence of torsade de pointes following sotalol overdosage and specific features enabling recognition and treatment of this life-threatening arrhythmia are discussed.", 
    "46": "The effects of beta-blockade (propranolol, 100 mg orally) on gastric acid output and on circulating levels of gastrin, adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine during modified sham feeding (MSF) were investigated by a randomized, double-blind method in six patients with asymptomatic duodenal ulcer disease. No differences occurred in peak acid output during MSF, whereas basal acid output was significantly suppressed by beta-blockade and peak acid output was unaffected. Basal gastrin concentration was lower during beta-blockade but rose in response to MSF. Without beta-blockade serum gastrin levels were unaffected by MSF. Plasma catecholamine concentrations were not affected by the beta-blockade. It is concluded that acid output and gastrin release in response to MSF, unlike that to insulin hypoglycaemia, is not influenced by beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "47": "The effect of experimental renal failure on the intravenous and oral pharmacokinetics of l-propranolol was studied in rats. Renal failure was induced by a single intravenous injection of uranyl nitrate (5 mg/kg). Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out on the fifth day after injection of the renal toxin (renal failure group) or saline (control group). Serum concentration time course of l-propranolol was characterized after a single intravenous or oral dose as well as after five consecutive doses of the drug given at 3-hr intervals. During repetitive intravenous drug administration, steady state was reached by the second dose, i.e., within 6 hr after initiation of repetitive dosing. No significant difference in the serum concentration time course of l-propranolol was observed between control and renal failure animals. In both groups the AUC over the steady-state dosing interval was on the average 21-27% higher than the AUC after a single dose, indicating a slight decrease in the systemic clearance of l-propranolol during repetitive intravenous drug administration. An approximately two- to three-fold higher serum l-propranolol concentration was observed in renal failure animals as compared to the normal controls after both single or repetitive oral dosing. The apparent reduction in oral clearance probably reflected an inhibition of the hepatic first-pass metabolism of l-propranolol in the renal failure rat. An unexpectedly high and protracted accumulation of serum l-propranolol concentration was observed during repetitive oral drug administration. Continuing accumulation was still evident after the fifth oral dose, i.e., a period of 15 hr or approximately 10 half-lives. The mean AUC over the last dosing interval was 32.0 and 17.8 times higher than the predicted steady-state estimate based on single oral dose data for control and renal failure rats, respectively. The substantial reduction in the oral clearance during repetitive drug administration may be due to an auto-inhibition of l-propranolol metabolism.", 
    "48": "In order to evaluate the relative role of the automatic nervus system and of the intrinsic electrophysiologic properties on the sinus node function, we measured the corrected sinus node recovery time before and after autonomic nervous system blockade in 24 patients. Fourteen had a sick sinus syndrome, five had a carotid sinus syncope, two had syncope of unknown origin associated with bradycardia. Beta blockade was obtained by infusing metoprolol intravenously at a dosage of 0.2 mg/kg; complete automatic blockade was achieved by further i.v. administration of atropine at a dosage of 0.04 mg/kg. After beta blockade, the corrected sinus node recovery time increased in patients with sick sinus syndrome and intrinsic slow heart rate, whereas it decreased in patients with carotid sinus syncope or with syncope and bradycardia. In patients with sick sinus syndrome and normal intrinsic heart rate the response was variable. A positive direct correlation was found between the changes of the corrected sinus node recovery time induced by beta blockade and those induced by autonomic blockade; that is, both either prolonged or shortened the corrected sinus node recovery time. The changes of the corrected sinus node recovery time after beta blockade alone were inversely correlated with the intrinsic heart rate. We conclude that patients with intrinsic depression of the sinus node have an increased sympathetic tone.", 
    "49": "The effect of propranolol treatment was investigated in the myocardial ischemia-induced hyperviscosity state in anesthetized dogs. In untreated control dogs, low shear blood viscosity rose progressively, following an acute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery; this effect was partially but significantly reduced by intravenously administered propranolol (0.2 mg/kg). The effect of the in vitro addition of propranolol was also determined upon viscosity of blood samples obtained at hourly intervals from dogs subjected to similar coronary ligation. The in vitro addition of propranolol did not produce a similar reversal of the hyperviscosity state observed in the blood obtained from dogs after coronary ligation.", 
    "50": "Five adults were treated successfully for severe theophylline poisoning due to intentional overdosage. Clinical features included nausea, tremor, delirium, hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia. No seizures or deaths occurred despite very high serum theophylline concentrations (between 96 and 194 mug per ml). Extreme elevations of plasma catecholamines were documented and are implicated in the toxicity. beta-Blockade with intravenous administration of propranolol hydrochloride was the most effective therapy for theophylline-induced hypotension. All patients were treated with resin hemoperfusion, which resulted in significant clinical improvement and rapid lowering of the serum theophylline level.", 
    "51": "In dogs, treatment with guanabenz, carteolol, and muzolimine for 7 days, reduced the blood pressure responses to bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries, electric stimulation of central vagus nerve, acetylcholine after atropinization, nicotine, l-noradrenaline, angiotensin II, l-adrenaline, KC1 and asphyxia.", 
    "52": "Paradoxical glucose-induced serum potassium elevation was found exclusively in the upright position in 9 patients with essential hypertension treated with metoprolol. The finding of depressed plasma aldosterone by the drug shed light only at one of the possible mechanisms leading to the unexpected changes in internal potassium balance.", 
    "53": "Sympathetic amines were tested on isolated trachea of guinea pig at physiological (7.4) and acid (6.6) pH. At physiological pH noradrenaline and phenylephrine relaxed the spontaneous tone of the tracheal muscle preparation; when propranolol was previously added to the organ bath solution, noradrenaline and phenylephrine didn't affect the tracheal muscle tone. Tested at acid pH (6.6), noradrenaline and phenylephrine still relaxed tracheal muscle preparations, but in the presence of propranolol these drugs increased the muscle tone. The spasmogenic effect produced by noradrenaline and phenylephrine after beta-receptor blockade by propranolol, was completely abolished by phentolamine. The present results suggest that acidosis could alter the responsiveness of both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in the tracheal muscle of guinea pig.", 
    "54": "A sensitive and selective gas chromatographic (GC) method for the quantitation of flecainide acetate, a new antiarrhythmic agent, was developed. The unchanged drug and internal standard were separated from biological fluids by a sequence of solvent extractions and then the drug was derivatized. The pentafluorobenzamide derivatives were chromatographed on a 3% SP-2250 glass column and detected with a nickel-63 electron-capture detector. By this method, greater than or equal to 12.5 ng of flecainide/mL can be quantitated in a 1-mL sample of plasma, saliva, or urine. The intraday precision, expressed as the RSD, at plasma levels of 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 600 ng/mL was 3.4, 6.2, 5.3, 6.4, 1.0, 1.6, 2.0, and 0.5%, respectively; the accuracy, expressed as relative error at these levels was -24.6, -6.9, -6.0, +0.6, +3.8, -0.3, +2.4, and -1.4%, respectively. The interday precision at these levels was 13.8, 13.0, 5.7, 7.6, 8.3, 6.1, 9.0, and 5.4%, respectively. Several other antiarrhythmic agents and one beta-blocker, which might be administered concurrently with flecainide acetate, do not interfere with the assay.", 
    "55": "A novel approach to zero-order drug delivery from glassy hydrogel matrices via an immobilized, sigmoidal, initial drug distribution has been developed. The method utilizes a controlled-extraction process on initially dry, drug-loaded hydrogels to generate an inflection-point-containing drug concentration profile followed by a vacuum freeze-drying step to rapidly remove the swelling solvent and immobilize in situ a nonuniform drug distribution. The drug release from such a system generally exhibits typical zero-order characteristics similar to that of a membrane-reservoir device. However, a saturated reservoir of active ingredient as in the membrane-reservoir device is not required because the constant release is achieved via an initially nonuniform concentration distribution instead of the constant activity in a reservoir. The applicability of the present concept and process has been demonstrated experimentally with the release of oxprenolol hydrochloride from hydrogel beads based on 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate polymerized with a polymeric cross-linking agent.", 
    "56": "Sinus node (SN) function was analyzed in 22 patients (mean age: 46.2 +/- 12.9 years) with organic heart disease and normal SN on clinical basis (group I) and in 20 normal subjects (mean age: 43.9 +/- 15.6 years), (control group). Sinus cycle length (SCL), corrected sinus node recovery time (CSRT) and sinoatrial conduction time (SACT) were analyzed. After the control study, autonomic blockade (AB) was induced by i.v. propranolol (0.2 mg/Kg) and atropine (0.04 mg/Kg). Measurements of SCL, CSRT and SACT were then repeated. The mean SCL values were very similar in the two groups during the control state and after AB. There were no significant differences in SACTs between the two groups during the control state or after AB. On the contrary, the CSRT of group I was significantly longer than that of control group during the control state (344.8 +/- 78.9 versus 262.2 +/- 46.3 msec, P less than 0.001) and after AB (238.9 +/- 72.8 versus 166.8 +/- 39.3 msec, P less than 0.001). The analysis of real depression of SN automaticity (CSRT minus SACT) in the two groups shows that prolongation of CSRT in group I during the control study and after AB is related to an intrinsic abnormality of SN automaticity; on the contrary, no dysfunctions of the autonomic nervous system appear. These data indicate that the intrinsic abnormality of SN automaticity represents the earliest involvement of the SN in subjects with organic heart disease and normal SN on clinical basis, although this conclusion is speculative and requires experimental verification.", 
    "57": "The effects of atropine, propranolol, isoproterenol and acetylcholine on the fetal heart rate variability were studied using chronically prepared fetal goats. When atropine, propranolol and atropine-propranolol were injected the STVs decreased by 45.2%, 43.2% and 57.3%, respectively; LTVs also decreased by 72.3%, 52.2% and 73.3%, respectively. STVs and LTVs increased by 39.5% and 34.5% with the injection of isoproterenol, and decreased by 27.6% and 22.7% with acetylcholine. These results suggest that FHR variability represents a change in the heart rate due to reciprocal innervation of adrenergic and cholinergic systems; moreover, the activity of the heart itself exerts some influence on variability. It is also suggested that LTV more strongly reflects autonomic nervous tone whereas STV more strongly reflects heart activity.", 
    "58": "Under continuous IV infusion of oxytocin, milk leakage was elicited in 6 lactating cows with full udders by induction of a vacuum (-30 cm of water) around 1 mammary papilla (teat) with a plethysmographic apparatus. The volumes of milk loss were measured every minute. Epinephrine injected either into the jugular vein (20, 100, and 500 micrograms) or into the external pudic artery (1.5, 7.5, and 37.5 micrograms) induced an increase in milk leakage in 5 cows. This effect could be antagonized by the beta-blocking agent sotalol hydrochloride (0.5 to 4 mg) injected into the external pudic artery. In 1 cow, however, epinephrine given intra-arterially exerted a biphasic effect, small doses inducing stimulation, and large doses evoking inhibition of milk loss. The stimulating effects were blocked by sotalol (2 mg). The inhibiting effects were antagonized by the alpha-blocking agent prazosin (2 mg).", 
    "59": "Transepithelial potential difference (PD) of isolated segments of the secretory coil of both human control and cystic fibrosis (CF) eccrine sweat glands was measured during stimulation with methacholine (MCh) and isoproterenol (ISO) in vitro. Negative luminal PD of about 10 and 16 mV developed across the secretory coil epithelium in control and CF secretory coil, respectively, during maximal MCh stimulation. ISO (10(-5) M) stimulation generated a mean of 1.9-mV negative luminal PD in control glands; however, ISO failed to enhance the luminal PD beyond the resting level of 0.9 mV in the CF secretory coil. The inhibition of ISO-induced (10(-5) M) luminal PD in control secretory coil by propranolol (5 X 10(-5) M) but not by atropine (10(-5) M) indicated its pharmacologic specificity. The possibility is discussed that this lack of electrical driving force during ISO stimulation could be one of the mechanisms for the absence of sweating response to beta-adrenergic stimulation in CF sweat glands reported recently (8). The mechanism for the higher MCh-induced luminal PD in the CF secretory coil remains to be studied.", 
    "60": "In a study of 120 unpremedicated outpatients presenting for outpatient dental anaesthesia, the incidence of dysrhythmias was lower with enflurane than had previously been found with halothane (1). The intravenous use of the cardioselective beta adrenergic blocking agents practolol and metoprolol, in a dose of 0.05-0.22 and 0.16-0.17 mg/kg body weight, respectively, proved effective in the treatment of sinus tachycardia in excess of 150 beats/min and/or ventricular dysrhythmias. Although metoprolol, unlike practolol, has no intrinsic sympathetic activity, there were no side-effects related to either beta-blocker in the dosages used during enflurane anaesthesia.", 
    "61": "A combination of an oral beta-adrenergic blocking agent and verapamil has been advocated as a safe treatment for angina. A case of Wenckebach type atrioventricular block occurring in a patient on metoprolol and verapamil is reported. It is suggested that this combination is used with caution.", 
    "62": "Propranolol in doses up to 520 mg/day was administered to eight patients with organic brain disease characterized by violent and assaultive behavior refractory to conventional treatment. Improvement was demonstrated in the seven patients able to tolerate adequate drug dosages. Hypotension, bradycardia, and interactions with other medications constituted complications.", 
    "63": "The circulatory effects of lifting and holding weighted suitcases of 5, 10 and 15 kg, and carrying the same suitcases at two different walking speeds were evaluated in 6 normal subjects before and after beta-adrenoceptor blockade with 160 mg oxprenolol. Lifting and holding induced significant weight-induced increments in systolic and diastolic blood pressure which were not attenuated by beta-blockade. There was a significant increase in heart rate only on lifting the 15 kg weight which was attenuated by oxprenolol. Dynamic exercise (walking) with the same weighted suitcases resulted in rate and speed related increase in systolic pressure and heart rate, the magnitude of which was greater than that of lifting alone. The isometric pressor response was attenuated when walking and carrying at 2 mph, but completely abolished by the metabolic and heat induced vasodilatation when walking at 4 mph. Following beta-blockade both the absolute blood pressure and the systolic pressor and heart rate responses to combined lifting and carrying were attenuated. The diastolic pressor response induced by lifting, which was offset in the control period by the vasodilation induced by dynamic exercise was progressively attenuated proportionate to the load carried following beta-blockade; presumably this reflected systemic vasoconstriction to maintain mean perfusion pressure in the presence of central beta-blockade. These observations suggest that the isometric component which predominates at slow walking speeds when carrying weights between 5 and 15 kg is completely suppressed by the vasodilatation at fast walking speeds. Beta-blockade, while reducing heart rate and systolic pressor response to the same stimuli, leads to an augmented systemic vascular resistance which is particularly evident at high metabolic workloads.", 
    "64": "Twenty patients with essential hypertension, who were receiving a diuretic plus propranolol qid, were instructed to take their entire daily requirement of propranolol as a single morning dose. Blood pressure was measured in standing and supine positions at the end of a dosing interval. Patients were questioned about the occurrence of specific propranolol side effects during each of four bi-weekly evaluations. Mean blood pressure on once-daily propranolol did not differ significantly from that observed on propranolol qid. Daily doses of propranolol ranged from 80-320 mg. Side effects were infrequent and mild. We conclude that propranolol may be administered as a single daily dose to patients with hypertension whose blood pressure already has been controlled on a qid regimen.", 
    "65": "The effects of 4% epinephrine bitartrate and 0.5% timolol on ocular and optic nerve blood flow were studied in phakic and aphakic rabbit eyes using a radioactive microsphere (85Sr) technique. Either epinephrine or timolol was given topically as eight drops in the hour immediately preceding blood flow measurements (one drop every 7.5 minutes). Epinephrine decreased anterior uveal blood flow in both phakic and aphakic eyes, whereas timolol exhibited no effect. Retinal and choroidal blood flow were not affected by either timolol or epinephrine in phakic eyes. In aphakic eyes, epinephrine increased choroidal blood flow without altering retinal blood flow, whereas timolol increased both retinal and choroidal blood flow. Optic nerve blood flow was increased in epinephrine treated phakic and aphakic eyes and also in timolol treated aphakic eyes.", 
    "66": "Nicotine and dimethyl-phenylpiperazinium (DMPP) increased intravesicular pressure and then transiently depressed the spontaneous activity of the urinary bladder in chloralose anaesthetized cats. Adrenaline (5-10 micrograms kg-1), noradrenaline (5-20 micrograms kg-1) and isoprenaline (40-50 micrograms kg-1) which depressed spontaneous urinary bladder activity, were antagonized by the beta-receptor blocking agent propranolol (1 mg kg-1). Phenylephrine (10-30 micrograms kg-1) was ineffective on the urinary bladder though it increased the systemic blood pressure. This latter effect was blocked by the alpha-receptor blocking agent phentolamine (2 mg kg-1). Acetylcholine (2-8 micrograms kg-1) caused a marked fall in systemic blood pressure, which was potentiated by physostigmine, but failed to produce any response on the intravesicular pressure even after physostigmine (50-100 micrograms kg-1) treatment. ATP (2 mg kg-1) produced an increase in intravesicular pressure accompanied by a fall in systemic blood pressure. The increased intravesicular pressure was antagonized by quinidine (20 mg kg-1); however, the fall in blood pressure remained unaltered. The increased intravesicular pressure induced by nicotine (20-40 micrograms kg-1) or DMPP (50-100 micrograms kg-1) was not affected by phentolamine (2 mg kg-1), propranolol (1 mg kg-1) or guanethidine (15-20 mg kg-1). Physostigmine (50-100 micrograms kg-1), hemicholinium 3 (2 mg kg-1) or atropine (1 mg kg-1) were also unable to affect the response to nicotine. Hexamethonium (1 mg kg-1), reduced the amplitude of spontaneous bladder contractions and quinidine (20 mg kg-1) abolished the effect of nicotine. 7 Bilateral sectioning of the cervical sympathetic or hypogastric nerves did not alter the effect of nicotine or DMPP. Higher spinal cord transection (Cl-C2) blocked the spontaneous, as well as the nicotine- and DMPP-induced, contractions of the bladder. 8 It is concluded that the increase in intravesicular pressure induced by nicotine is atropineresistant and is not mediated either through adrenergic or cholinergic mechanisms. It is probable that a purinergic mechanism is involved, via the activation of P2-receptors present in the urinary bladder.", 
    "67": "Pindolol kinetics and bioavailability were studied after a single dose (oral 5 mg; intravenous 3 mg) in nine patients with malabsorption (two with villous atrophies, seven with short bowel syndromes) and in six healthy volunteers. After oral administration no significant differences were observed in bioavailability (59.4 +/- 6.2% in patients vs 79.5 +/- 8.6% in controls) and for most plasma and urinary pharmacokinetic parameters between the experimental and control groups as a whole. However, detailed analysis revealed decreased absorption for pindolol in two out of nine patients. After i.v. administration, apparent distribution volume was smaller (V: 2.10 +/- 0.25 l kg-1 vs 3.05 +/- 0.31 l kg-1) and global elimination constant was larger (ke: 1.43 +/- 0.46 h-1 vs 0.56 +/- 0.10 h-1), in patients with malabsorption than in controls (P less than 0.05). The smaller weight of patients and pharmacokinetic modifications due to the pathology could account for this.", 
    "68": "Noradrenaline plasma kinetics were assessed in 17 male patients, who had been treated with metoprolol 100-200 mg daily (n = 8) or placebo for 3 years after an acute myocardial infarction, before and 1 week after gradual withdrawal (during 1 week) of the study treatment. Endogenous noradrenaline concentrations in plasma were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Noradrenaline spillover rate, plasma clearance and the t1/2 for the rapid removal from plasma were determined by radio-tracer methodology. During treatment the plasma noradrenaline concentrations and noradrenaline plasma kinetic variables were similar in the two groups. Venous plasma noradrenaline concentrations were more closely correlated to the spillover rates of noradrenaline to plasma than to the clearance of noradrenaline from plasma, but the spillover rates were correlated to the clearance rates. Following the withdrawal of metoprolol noradrenaline clearance from plasma increased slightly (by 18 +/- 5%, P less than 0.05), but the plasma concentrations and spillover rates of noradrenaline were unchanged. In the placebo group withdrawal did not result in any significant changes. Our results indicate that a generalised increase in sympathetic nerve activity is not the cause of so-called rebound phenomena following withdrawal of chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "69": "Seventy-two rabbits were separated into groups to receive no drug, subcutaneous verapamil, metoprolol, hydralazine, metoprolol and hydralazine, or oral verapamil in 1 of 3 doses daily for 10 weeks. They also received a high-cholesterol diet and had serum triglyceride, cholesterol, and verapamil levels measured twice during the study. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate and weight were measured every 10 days. Approximately 60% of the rabbits given verapamil had detectable levels of the drug in their serum. This group had significantly less severe atherosclerosis in their aortas at the time they were killed, even though they had significantly higher cholesterol levels than the other groups. This group also did not have different BP than the other groups (except for the subcutaneous verapamil group). Thus, protection from atherosclerosis by verapamil in the cholesterol-fed rabbit is not the result of lowering of BP.", 
    "70": "Plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) responses to the dopaminergic agonist 2-amino-6,7-(OH)2-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (ADTN) have been studied in cattle. During ADTN infusions PTH increased within min in a dose-dependent manner, while calcium remained unchanged. Prolonged administration of ADTN caused transient PTH responses and crosstachyphylaxis to the subsequent administration of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, but not to hypocalcemia, caused by infusions of ethylene-glycol-bis (beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetate. PTH responses were not modified by the beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol, infused in amounts earlier shown to suppress PTH responses to isoproterenol and epinephrine. In conclusion, the dopaminergic agonist ADTN caused a direct and transient stimulation of PTH secretion, not mediated by hypocalcemia or by beta-adrenergic receptors on parathyroid cells. However, crosstachyphylaxis to isoproterenol, but not to hypocalcemia, was observed.", 
    "71": "Panic attack syndrome in four generations of a family and in six additional pediatric patients is reported. The syndrome appears to have an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Diagnosis of panic attack syndrome in children has not been reported previously, but the existence of this disorder has been noted for at least 100 years under various synonyms. There is substantial evidence that the syndrome has an endogenous origin and is therefore a biochemical illness. The triggering effect of sodium lactate infusion and the alleviation of symptoms by use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors or beta-blocking agents support this view. Imipramine hydrochloride, propranolol hydrochloride, phenelzine sulfate, and alprazolam are often useful in the treatment of panic attacks, and except for propranolol, any of them may be effective against depression also.", 
    "72": "The effects of equiblocking doses of three beta-adrenergic blocking agents, propranolol, timolol and metoprolol, on myocardial infarct size were evaluated in 28 dogs after acute experimental coronary artery occlusion. Heart rate, arterial pressure and arterial free fatty acid concentration were measured in an attempt to evaluate their effects on the extent of myocardial injury. The zone at risk of infarction in each dog 1 minute after left anterior coronary artery occlusion was assessed by injecting highly radioactive albumin microspheres into the left atrium, and the hypoperfused zone was determined by autoradiography. After 15 minutes, the dogs were randomized into four groups: control dogs (n = 7), propranolol-treated dogs (1.2 mg/kg intravenously, n = 7), timolol-treated dogs (0.2 mg/kg intravenously, n = 7) and metoprolol-treated dogs (1.2 mg/kg intravenously, n = 7). After 6 hours, the dogs were killed. The left ventricle was sliced and stained with triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride for measurement on infarct size. The same slices were then autoradiographed for measurement of the hypoperfused zone. The percent of hypoperfused zone that evolved to infarction (the ratio of infarct size to hypoperfused zone) was 90.4 +/- 1.9% in the control group, 72.4 +/- 2.4% in the propranolol-treated dogs (p less than 0.05 versus control group); 57.9 +/- 4.4% in the timolol-treated dogs (p less than 0.01 versus control group; p less than 0.05 versus propranolol) and 54.4 +/- 3.7% in the metoprolol-treated dogs (p less than 0.01 versus control group; p less than 0.05 versus propranolol). Thus, propranolol, timolol and metoprolol reduced myocardial infarct size in dogs by 20, 36 and 40%, respectively, after experimental coronary artery occlusion. Metoprolol and timolol protected the ischemic myocardium more effectively than did propranolol.", 
    "73": "Amosulalol kinetic studies were conducted in seven subjects who received 0.16 mg/kg iv and in 18 subjects who received 12.5, 25, 50, 100, or 150 mg by mouth. Plasma levels of amosulalol after intravenous dosing declined biphasically and fitted a two-compartment model. Kinetics were as follows: coefficients A = 0.85 +/- 0.09 microgram/ml and B = 0.22 +/- 0.01 microgram/ml; rate constants alpha = 2.78 +/- 0.24 hr-1 and beta = 0.25 +/- 0.01 hr-1; elimination rate constants, k12 = 1.36 +/- 0.17 hr-1, k21 = 0.78 +/- 0.06 hr-1, and kel = 0.88 +/- 0.06 hr-1; terminal phase volume of distribution = 0.75 +/- 0.06 l/kg; clearance = 8.09 +/- 0.54 l/hr; AUC = 1.22 +/- 0.09 microgram . hr/ml; and t1/2 alpha = 0.26 +/- 0.02 hr and t1/2 beta = 2.8 +/- 0.1 hr. After single oral doses, amosulalol peak plasma levels were generally reached within 2 to 4 hr. Maximum plasma concentrations and AUC increased in a dose-dependent manner, whereas t1/2 were about 5 hr (range 4.4 to 5.7 hr) at each dose. Systemic availability of amosulalol was about 100% as determined by the ratio of AUC after oral and intravenous dosing. These results suggest that amosulalol is well absorbed and is little affected by first-pass metabolism.", 
    "74": "The acute effects of felodipine on left ventricular function and haemodynamics were studied in 11 patients with coronary artery disease. To block reflex sympathetic activation due to peripheral vasodilatation and to avoid effects secondary to changes in heart rate all patients received a standard regimen of beta adrenoceptor blockade and all measurements were made during sinus rhythm and right atrial pacing. At 30 minutes after an oral dose (0.075 mg/kg in solution) felodipine plasma concentration were 16.4 (3.5) nmol/l. A significant fall in systemic vascular resistance (30%) and increase in cardiac index (30%) occurred, whereas pulmonary vascular resistance was unchanged. Felodipine increased left ventricular ejection fraction and mean velocity of circumferential fibre shortening but had no effect on derivates of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt or dP/dt P-1) during sinus rhythm or pacing. Thus at the dosage used felodipine was a potent dilator of systemic arterioles but had no direct effect on left ventricular function.", 
    "75": "Five continuous records of arterial plasma potassium were obtained from three normal subjects during brief periods (5-7 min) of exercise (100 W). In two of these subjects hepatic venous blood samples were withdrawn at 0.5-1.0 min intervals and analysed in vitro for plasma potassium. Arterial plasma potassium rose rapidly at the start of exercise from 3.8 +/- 0.3 mmol/l (mean +/- SD) to plateau levels of 5.4 +/- 0.1 mmol/l. One of the above subjects and a further subject were studied after beta-blockade with propranolol. This resulted in an exaggerated rise in arterial plasma potassium during exercise. Hepatic venous potassium measurements indicated that the liver probably had little effect on potassium changes during exercise. The changes in arterial plasma potassium during exercise are rapid and substantial. If transmitted to the extracellular fluid these changes would alter cell transmembrane potential and might as a result alter receptor sensitivity."
