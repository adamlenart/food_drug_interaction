    "1": "Patients undergoing elective lower extremity bypass (LEB), aortofemoral bypass (AFB), and open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in the VQI were analyzed. MACE was defined as any postoperative myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, or congestive heart failure. Controlled HR was defined as AHR <75 beats/min on operating room arrival. Delta HR (DHR) was defined as highest intraoperative HR - AHR. Procedure-specific MACE models were derived for risk stratification, and generalized estimating equations were used to account for clustering of center effects. HR, beta-blocker exposure, cardiac risk, and their interactions were explored to determine association with MACE or 30-day mortality. A Bonferroni correction with P < .004 was used to declare significance.",

AHR and DHR outcome association was variable across patients and procedures. AHR <75 beats/min was associated with increased postoperative myocardial infarction risk for LEB patients across all risk strata (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.9; P = .03), whereas AHR <75 beats/min was associated with decreased dysrhythmia risk (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.28-0.63; P = .0001) and 30-day death (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.33-0.77; P = .001) in patients at moderate and high cardiac risk. These HR associations disappeared in controlling for beta-blocker status. For AFB and open AAA repair patients, there was no significant association between AHR and MACE or 30-day mortality, irrespective or cardiac risk or beta-blocker status.

We used econometric modeling to separate and quantify the unique contributions of loss aversion, risk attitudes, and choice consistency to risky decision making. We administered the beta-blocker propranolol in a double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subjects study, targeting the neurohormonal basis of physiological arousal. Matching our intervention's pharmacological specificity with a quantitative model delineating decision-making components allowed us to identify the causal relationships between arousal and decision making that do and do not exist. Propranolol selectively reduced loss aversion in a baseline- and dose-dependent manner (i.e., as a function of initial loss aversion and body mass index), and did not affect risk attitudes or choice consistency. These findings provide evidence for a specific, modulatory, and causal relationship between precise components of emotion and risky decision making.",

AF developed in one patient in the Dex group (6.3\u00a0%) and ten patients in the non-Dex group (34.5\u00a0%) during the observation period, and the difference was significant (p\u2009=\u20090.035). None of the risk factors for AF was significantly associated with AF in univariate analysis; however, multivariate logistic regression analysis using age, Dex use, and beta-blocker use, extracted because their p values in univariate analysis were not exceeding 0.15, showed that Dex use was the only factor associated with the development of AF (p\u2009=\u20090.045, odds ratio 9.75 [1.05-90.8]).",

Blood leukocyte count was measured immediately after admission in the emergency department. The composite of death, reinfarction, urgent revascularization, and stroke during hospitalization were defined as the primary end point of the study.

We investigated the prognostic value of statins in a large, pure cohort of prospectively recruited patients with ESRD awaiting renal transplantation, and being followed up in a dedicated cardiac clinic. We prospectively collected demographic, clinical, laboratory, and pharmacological data on 423 consecutive ESRD patients on hemodialysis awaiting renal transplantation. Survival analysis was performed as a function of statin therapy. The baseline characteristics were as follows: age 57\u2009\u00b1\u200911 years, males 64%, diabetes mellitus in 68%, known coronary artery disease in 30%, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction 61\u2009\u00b1\u200911%. Over a mean follow-up of 2 years, there were 43 deaths. Adjusted for age, gender, hypertension, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, smoking, and treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, \u03b2 blocker, and antiplatelet medications, statin use was a predictor of lower mortality (hazard ratio 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.11-0.79, p\u2009=\u20090.01). This beneficial effect of statin was supported by propensity score analysis (p\u2009=\u20090.02) and was consistent across all clinical subgroups. The benefit of statins seemed to be greater in those with LV hypertrophy and smoking. Statin therapy in hemodialysis patients awaiting renal transplant is independently associated with better survival supporting its use in this high-risk population.", 
    "29": "The metastatic process is the most serious cause of cancer death. Norepinephrine, secreted in chronic stress conditions, stimulates the motility of breast and colon cells through \u03b2-adrenergic receptor. On these bases, we examined its possible role in metastasis formation and development in\u00a0vitro and in vivo. Treatments with norepinephrine (\u03b22-adrenoreceptor agonist) in mice xenografted with human DU145 prostate cancer cells increased the metastatic potential of these cells. Specifically, we showed that treatment of mice with norepinephrine induced a significant increase of the migratory activity of cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner and that this process was blocked by propanolol (\u03b2-adrenergic antagonist). Mice treated with norepinephrine, displayed an increased number of metastatic foci of DU145 cells in inguinal lymph nodes and also showed an increased expression of MMP2 and MMP9 in tumor samples compared to controls. Moreover, we demonstrated that propanolol induced in norepinephrine treated DU145 cells a E-cadherin finger-like membrane protrusions driven by vimentin remodeling. Altogether these data suggest that \u03b22-AR plays an important role in prostate cancer metastasis formation and that the treatment with antagonist propanolol, could represents an interesting tool to control this process in cells overexpressing \u03b22AR.",

After a 48 h PRP aqueous exposure for algae, with a subsequent 48 h dietary exposure for daphnia and an 8d dietary exposure for crucian carp, PRP was observed in each trophic level, despite significant bioaccumulation did not occur in daphnia and crucian carp. A portion of the absorbed PRP was metabolized by the crucian carp to N-desisopropylated propranolol, propranolol glucuronic acid, monohydroxylated propranolol, hydroxypropranolol glucuronide and dihydroxypropranolol glucuronide, which were similar to those in mammals. In addition, multiple biomarkers in the liver of crucian carp (7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, EROD; 7-benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylation, BROD; superoxide dismutase, SOD and malondialdehyde, MDA) were measured. BROD and MDA were not significantly affected by PRP, while EROD and SOD did change significantly during the 8d dietary exposure. This work indicated that the trophic transfer of PRP, resulting in biochemical perturbations of fish biological systems, should be a concern for the assessment of the environmental risks to aquatic food chains.", 
    "31": "Understanding how changes in the cardiovascular system contribute to cerebral blood flow (CBF) and volume (CBV) increases is critical for interpreting hemodynamic signals. Here we investigated how systemic cardiovascular changes affect the cortical hemodynamic response during voluntary locomotion. In the mouse, voluntary locomotion drives an increase in cortical CBF and arterial CBV that is localized to the forelimb/hindlimb representation in the somatosensory cortex, as well as a diffuse venous CBV increase. To determine if the heart rate increases that accompany locomotion contribute to locomotion-induced CBV and CBF increases, we occluded heart rate increases with the muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist glycopyrrolate, and reduced heart rate with the \u03b21-adrenergic receptor antagonist atenolol. We quantified the effects of these cardiovascular manipulations on CBV and CBF dynamics by comparing the hemodynamic response functions (HRF) to locomotion across these conditions. Neither the CBF HRF nor the arterial component of the CBV HRF was significantly affected by pharmacological disruption of the heart rate. In contrast, the amplitude and spatial extent of the venous component of the CBV HRF were decreased by atenolol. These results suggest that the increase in venous CBV during locomotion was partially driven by peripheral cardiovascular changes, whereas CBF and arterial CBV increases associated with locomotion reflect central processes.", 
    "32": "There is a well-established association between hypertension and atrial fibrillation (AF); indeed, even upper normal systolic blood pressures (SBP) are long-term predictors of incident AF. These findings suggest that more aggressive BP control may reduce the risk of new AF. However, whether lower achieved SBP is associated with a lower incidence of AF remains unclear. The risk of new-onset AF was examined in relation to last in-treatment SBP before AF diagnosis or last in-study measurement in the absence of new AF in 8831 hypertensive patients with ECG left ventricular hypertrophy with no history of AF, in sinus rhythm on their baseline ECG, randomly assigned to losartan- or atenolol-based treatment. Patients with in-treatment SBP \u2264130 mm Hg (lowest quintile at last measurement) and SBP between 131 and 141 mm Hg were compared with patients with in-treatment SBP \u2265142 mm Hg (median SBP at last measurement). During follow-up of 4.6\u00b11.1 years, new-onset AF was diagnosed in 701 patients (7.9%). In multivariate Cox analyses, compared with in-treatment SBP \u2265142 mm Hg, in-treatment SBP \u2264130 mm Hg entered as a time-varying covariate was associated with a 40% lower risk (95% confidence interval, 18%-55%) and in-treatment SBP of 131 to 141 mm Hg with a 24% lower risk (95% confidence interval, 7%-38%) of new AF. Thus, achieved SBP \u2264130 mm Hg is associated with a lower risk of new-onset AF in hypertensive patients with ECG left ventricular hypertrophy. Further study is needed to determine whether targeting hypertensive patients without AF to lower SBP goals can reduce the burden of new AF in this high-risk population.",

Four hours following drug intake, heart rate and blood pressure were measured, and plasma concentrations of propafenone were determined at rest, during exercise and after recovery. At exercise, propafenone significantly decreased heart rate (-6%, P < 0.05), systolic blood pressure (-6%, P < 0.05), and the rate-pressure product (-11%, P < 0.05). Plasma concentrations of propafenone increased during exercise (+23%, P < 0.05) and decreased during recovery (-33%, P < 0.05).", 
    "36": "Both effects on heart rate and blood pressure as well as the changes of plasma concentrations of propafenone during exercise represent two particular features of beta-blockers. Therefore, we conclude that propafenone is both a Class Ic and a Class II antiarrhythmic agent, and 600 mg propafenone, i.e. the dose recommended in current guidelines for cardioversion of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, cause clinically significant beta-blockade. Thus, single oral doses of 600 mg propafenone appear also suitable for cardioversion of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with structural heart disease since beta-blockers are explicitly indicated in the treatment of both coronary artery disease and heart failure.",

This article reviews three serious adverse drug interactions that are well supported by the literature and can impact dental practice. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the renal excretion of lithium and lead to lithium toxicity. Metronidazole and fluconazole inhibit the metabolism of warfarin by blocking cytochrome P-450 2C9 (CYP-2C9), the major metabolic pathway of warfarin, with the end result being dramatic increases in patients' international normalized ratios (INRs) and potentially fatal bleeding. Propranolol and other nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agents can inhibit the vasodilatory effect of epinephrine in dental local anesthetic solutions, leading to hypertensive reactions and a concomitant reflex bradycardia. It is important for clinicians to recognize and avoid these serious drug interactions. By doing so, they will provide the safest and best treatment for their patients.", 
    "48": "A comprehensive investigation of abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and its influence on other important phytochemicals is critical for understanding the versatile roles that ABA plays during strawberry fruit ripening. Using RNA-seq technology, we sampled strawberry fruit in response to ABA or nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA; an ABA biosynthesis blocker) treatment during ripening and assessed the expression changes of genes involved in the metabolism of pigments, ascorbic acid (AsA) and folic acid in the receptacles. The transcriptome analysis identified a lot of genes differentially expressed in response to ABA or NDGA treatment. In particular, genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway were actively regulated by ABA, with the exception of the gene encoding cinnamate 4-hydroxylase. Chlorophyll degradation was accelerated by ABA mainly owing to the higher expression of gene encoding pheide a oxygenase. The decrease of \u03b2-carotene content was accelerated by ABA treatment and delayed by NDGA. A high negative correlation rate was found between ABA and \u03b2-carotene content, indicating the importance of the requirement for ABA synthesis during fruit ripening. In addition, evaluation on the folate biosynthetic pathway indicate that ABA might have minor function in this nutrient's biosynthesis process, however, it might be involved in its homeostasis. Surprisingly, though AsA content accumulated during fruit ripening, expressions of genes involved in its biosynthesis in the receptacles were significantly lower in ABA-treated fruits. This transcriptome analysis expands our understanding of ABA's role in phytochemical metabolism during strawberry fruit ripening and the regulatory mechanisms of ABA on these pathways were discussed. Our study provides a wealth of genetic information in the metabolism pathways and may be helpful for molecular manipulation in the future.", 
    "49": "Endogenous fragments of extracellular matrix are known to possess various biological effects. Levels of endostatin, a fragment of collagen type XVIII, increase in certain cardiac diseases, such as cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial infarction. However, the influence of endostatin on cardiac contraction has not been clarified. In the present study, we investigated the effects of endostatin on bradykinin-induced atrial contraction. Isometric contractile force of mouse isolated left atria induced by electrical current pulse was measured. Voltage-dependent calcium current of guinea pig ventricular myocytes was measured by a whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Endostatin (100-1,000 ng/ml) alone treatment had no influence on left atrial contraction. On the other hand, pretreatment with endostatin (300 ng/ml) significantly inhibited bradykinin (1 \u00b5M)-induced contraction and voltage-dependent calcium current. These data suggest that endostatin may decrease bradykinin-induced cardiac contraction perhaps through the inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channel.",

Its receptor RAGE is crucial for \u03b2-amyloid-associated neurodegeneration. Relevant signaling via HMGB1/RAGE is expected in IBM pathology. By real-time-PCR, mRNA-expression levels of HMGB1 and RAGE were upregulated in muscle biopsies of patients with IBM and PM, but not in muscular dystrophy or non-myopathic controls. By immunohistochemistry, both molecules displayed the highest signal in IBM, where they distinctly co-localized to intra-fiber accumulations of \u03b2-amyloid and neurofilament/tau. In these fibers, identification of phosphorylated Erk suggested that relevant downstream activation is present upon HMGB1 signaling via RAGE. Protein expressions of HMGB1, RAGE, Erk and phosphorylated Erk were confirmed by Western blot. In a well established cell-culture model for pro-inflammatory cell-stress, exposure of human muscle-cells to IL-1\u03b2+IFN-\u03b3 induced cytoplasmic translocation of HMGB1 and subsequent release as evidenced by ELISA. Upregulation of RAGE on the cell surface was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and flow-cytometry. Recombinant HMGB1 was equally potent as IL-1\u03b2+IFN-\u03b3 in causing amyloid-accumulation and cell-death, and both were abrogated by the HMGB1-blocker BoxA.

For this, effects of the \u03b2-AR agonist isoprenaline and mirabegron were tested in presence or absence of selective antagonists for \u03b2-AR subtypes, namely CGP-20712A for \u03b21-AR, ICI-118,551 for \u03b22-AR, and L-748,337 for \u03b23-AR. In detrusor strips from both normal and obstructed animals, EFS-induced contractions were weakly affected by isoprenaline and even less so by mirabegron. In contrast, microcontraction activity was more potently reduced by isoprenaline (pIC50 7.3; Emax \u00b185\u00a0%), whereas mirabegron showed a small effect. In pBOO strips, concentration response curves for isoprenaline and mirabegron at inhibition of EFS and spontaneous microcontractions were similar to those in normal strips. Isoprenaline-induced inhibition of microcontractions and EFS was antagonized by the \u03b21-AR antagonist, but not by the \u03b22- and \u03b23-AR antagonists. In the context of \u03b23-AR-mediated bladder functions for mirabegron in other experiments, the current data question a role for effects at spontaneous microcontractions, or neurogenic detrusor stimulation in the mode of action for mirabegron in vivo, since functional bladder effects for mirabegron are reported to occur at much lower concentrations.",

In our study, we explored the effects of monosaccharides such as glucose and mannose on stomatal aperture. Here, we demonstrate that glucose and mannose trigger stomatal closure in a dose- and time-dependent manner in epidermal peels of broad bean (Vicia faba). Pharmacological studies revealed that glucose- and mannose-induced stomatal closure was almost completely inhibited by two reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers, catalase (CAT) and reduced glutathione (GSH), was significantly abolished by an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphenylene iodonium chloride (DPI), whereas they were hardly affected by a peroxidase inhibitor, salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM). Furthermore, glucose- and mannose-induced stomatal closure was strongly inhibited by a Ca(2+) channel blocker, LaCl3 , a Ca(2+) chelator, ethyleneglycol-bis(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and two water channel blockers, HgCl2 and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); whereas the inhibitory effects of the water channel blockers were essentially abolished by the reversing agent \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (\u03b2-ME).

The various etiologies of brain injury appear to coalesce to common endpoints: potential neuronal demise, cognitive and functional losses, immune suppression and infection. The use of principles patterned after 'Koch's Postulates' (show/prove the presence of infection/illness/disease, treat until resolved, and prove objectively that the disease/illness is gone/healed/cured) appears to be marginalized in establishing a diagnosis and recovery from mTBI/TBI. The pathways of immune system interactions in stroke (brain injury) and infection are briefly discussed. The suggestion of combined specific antibiotic and beta blockade for ischemic stroke (brain injury) and mTBI is advanced for treatment and expeditious further study. Stroke is considered a brain injury in this paper. Stroke is also considered and recommended as a study model for mTBI therapy because of their common end points from brain damage.

Efforts to identify the common stress-related mechanisms driving these disorders have been hampered, in part, by a lack of reliable preclinical models that replicate their comorbid symptomatology. Prior work by us, and others, has shown that adolescent social isolation increases anxiety-like behaviors and voluntary ethanol consumption in adult male Long-Evans rats. Here we examined whether social isolation also produces deficiencies in extinction of conditioned fear, a hallmark symptom of PTSD. Additionally, as disrupted noradrenergic signaling may contribute to alcoholism, we examined the effect of anxiolytic medications that target noradrenergic signaling on ethanol intake following adolescent social isolation. Our results confirm and extend previous findings that adolescent social isolation increases anxiety-like behavior and enhances ethanol intake and preference in adulthood. Additionally, social isolation is associated with a significant deficit in the extinction of conditioned fear and a marked increase in the ability of noradrenergic therapeutics to decrease ethanol intake. These results suggest that adolescent social isolation not only leads to persistent increases in anxiety-like behaviors and ethanol consumption, but also disrupts fear extinction, and as such may be a useful preclinical model of stress-related psychopathology. Our data also suggest that disrupted noradrenergic signaling may contribute to escalated ethanol drinking following social isolation, thus further highlighting the potential utility of noradrenergic therapeutics in treating the deleterious behavioral sequelae associated with early life stress.",

This study was designed to determine whether inhibition of salusin-\u03b2 in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) delays the progression of hypertension and attenuates cardiac hypertrophy by restoring neurotransmitters and cytokines. Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed with a normal salt diet (NS, 0.3%) or a high salt diet (HS, 8%) for 8 weeks to induce hypertension. Then, these rats received bilateral PVN infusion of a specific salusin-\u03b2 blocker, antisalusin-\u03b2 IgG (SIgG), or control IgG (CIgG) for 2 weeks. HS rats exhibited higher mean arterial pressure and cardiac hypertrophy as indicated by increased whole heart weight/bodyweight ratio, whole heart weight/tibia length ratio, left ventricular weight/tibia length ratio, and messenger RNA levels of cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and \u03b2-myosin heavy chain. Compared with NS rats, HS rats had higher levels of glutamate, norepinephrine, tyrosine hydroxylase, proinflammatory cytokines, and lower levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid, interleukin 10, and the 67-kDa isoform of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD67) in the PVN, and higher plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Chronic PVN infusion of SIgG attenuated all these changes in HS rats. Our findings suggest that HS rats have an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, as well as an imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the PVN; and chronic inhibition of salusin-\u03b2 in the PVN restores neurotransmitters and cytokines in the PVN, thereby attenuating hypertensive responses and cardiac hypertrophy.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that P450s and their metabolites play a crucial role in the initiation of cardiac hypertrophy. To test our hypothesis, rats and RL-14 cells were treated with the hypertrophic agonist isoproterenol for different time periods. Thereafter, in vivo heart function and wall thickness were assessed using echocardiography. Moreover, the role of P450 epoxygenases, \u03c9-hydroxylases, and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) were determined at mRNA, protein, and activity levels using real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. Our results show that in vivo and in vitro hypertrophy was initiated after 72 hours and 6 hours of isoproterenol treatment, respectively. Studies performed at the prehypertrophy phase showed a significant decrease in P450 epoxygenases along with a significant induction of sEH activity. Consequently, lower EET and higher dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid levels were observed during this phase. However, significant increases in P450 \u03c9-hydroxylase along with its associated metabolite, 20-HETE, were detected only in vivo. Interestingly, increasing EET levels by P450 epoxygenase induction, sEH inhibition, or exogenous administration of EET prevented the initiation of cardiac hypertrophy through a nuclear factor-\u03baB-mediated mechanism. Taken together, these findings reveal a crucial role of P450 epoxygenases and EETs in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, which could uncover novel targets for prevention of heart failure at early stages.",

In Experiment 2, we tested for a causal relationship between changes in noradrenergic function and orienting behavior by blocking noradrenergic receptors during exercise. Rats that received propranolol (beta adrenergic/noradrenergic receptor blocker) during 10 days of exercise failed to exhibit an exercise-induced reduction in orienting behavior. The results inform a growing literature regarding the effects of exercise on behavior and the potential use of exercise as a treatment for mental disorders.", 
    "107": "In the new human EndoC-\u03b2H1 \u03b2-cell line, a detailed analysis of the physiological characteristics was performed. This new human \u03b2-cell line expressed all target structures on the gene and protein level, which are crucial for physiological function and insulin secretion induced by glucose and other secretagogues. Glucose influx measurements revealed an excellent uptake capacity of EndoC-\u03b2H1 \u03b2-cells by the Glut1 and Glut2 glucose transporters. A high expression level of glucokinase enabled efficient glucose phosphorylation, increasing the ATP/ADP ratio along with stimulation of insulin secretion in the physiological glucose concentration range. The EC50 value of glucose for insulin secretion was 10.3\u00a0mM. Mannoheptulose, a specific glucokinase inhibitor, blocked glucose-induced insulin secretion (GSIS). The nutrient insulin secretagogues l-leucine and 2-ketoisocaproate also stimulated insulin secretion, with a potentiating effect of l-glutamine. The Kir 6.2 potassium channel blocker glibenclamide and Bay K 8644, an opener of the voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channel significantly potentiated GSIS. Potentiation of GSIS by IBMX and forskolin went along with a strong stimulation of cAMP generation. In conclusion, the new human EndoC-\u03b2H1 \u03b2-cell line fully mirrors the analogous physiological characteristics of primary mouse, rat and human \u03b2-cells. Thus, this new human EndoC-\u03b2H1 \u03b2-cell line is very well suited for physiological \u03b2-cell studies.",

Three patients responded to propranolol therapy and required no adjunctive surgical procedures. Three patients failed propranolol treatment, and required open resection of their subglottic hemangiomas and thyroid ala graft placement. Indications for resection were complete lack of response to propranolol in one patient, and initial response to propranolol with subsequent regrowth in the other two patients. All three patients were treated with submucosal extirpation of their hemangioma and single stage LTP; hemangioma was confirmed in all cases by positive GLUT-1 staining. All three surgical patients were successfully extubated post-operatively and none had hemangioma regrowth.",

    "112": "Medication nonadherence is a common precipitant of heart failure (HF) hospitalization and is associated with poor outcomes. Recent analyses of national data focus on long-term medication\u00a0adherence. Little is known about adherence of patients with HF immediately after\u00a0hospitalization. Hospitalized patients with HF were identified from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities data were linked to Medicare inpatient and part D claims from 2006 to 2009. Inclusion criteria were a chart-adjudicated diagnosis of acute decompensated or chronic HF; documentation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB), \u03b2 blocker (BB), or diuretic prescription at discharge; and Medicare part D coverage. Proportion of ambulatory days covered was calculated for up to twelve 30-day periods after discharge. Adherence was defined as \u226580% proportion of ambulatory days covered. We identified 402 participants with Medicare part D:\u00a0mean age 75, 30% men, and 41% black. Adherence at 1, 3, and 12\u00a0months was 70%, 61%, and 53% for ACEI/ARB; 76%, 66%, and 62% for BB; and 75%, 68%, and 59% for diuretic. Adherence to any single drug class was positively correlated with being adherent to other classes. Adherence varied by geographic site/race for ACEI/ARB and BB but not diuretics. In conclusion, despite having part D coverage, medication adherence after discharge for all 3\u00a0medication classes decreases over 2 to 4\u00a0months after discharge, followed by a plateau over the subsequent year. Interventions should focus on early and sustained adherence.", 
    "113": "The extent of ionization of a drug molecule at different pH values can be characterized by its pKa (acid dissociation constants). It is an important parameter in pharmaceutical development to rationalize the physiochemical and biopharmaceutical properties of the drug molecule. UV titration for pKa determination is one of the popular methods. The success of this method requires the molecule exhibiting strong pH-dependent spectral shift related to the ionization process. Depending on the proximity between the ionizable group and the chromophore, the spectral shift may not be strong enough to warrant a successful determination. In a previous study, it has been reported that a distance of three \u03c3 bonds between the chromophore and the ionizable group was the limit for a precise pKa determination. In this work, a UV titration method for pKa determination, with a particular emphasis on molecules with weak pH-dependent spectral shift is investigated. It has been shown that the pKa values determined from this study are in good agreement with those determined using potentiometric method and literature data (R(2)=0.998). Our methodology revealed that successful pKa determination is feasible even with a separation distance of five \u03c3 bonds between the chromophore and the ionizable group.", 
    "114": "IL-6 is a major causative factor of inflammatory disease. Although IL-6 and its signaling pathways are promising targets, orally available small-molecule drugs specific for IL-6 have not been developed. To discover IL-6 antagonists, we screened our in-house chemical library and identified LMT-28, a novel synthetic compound, as a candidate IL-6 blocker. The activity, mechanism of action, and direct molecular target of LMT-28 were investigated. A reporter gene assay showed that LMT-28 suppressed activation of STAT3 induced by IL-6, but not activation induced by leukemia inhibitory factor. In addition, LMT-28 downregulated IL-6-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT3, gp130, and JAK2 protein and substantially inhibited IL-6-dependent TF-1 cell proliferation. LMT-28 antagonized IL-6-induced TNF-\u03b1 production in vivo. In pathologic models, oral administration of LMT-28 alleviated collagen-induced arthritis and acute pancreatitis in mice. Based on the observation of upstream IL-6 signal inhibition by LMT-28, we hypothesized IL-6, IL-6R\u03b1, or gp130 to be putative molecular targets. We subsequently demonstrated direct interaction of LMT-28 with gp130 and specific reduction of IL-6/IL-6R\u03b1 complex binding to gp130 in the presence of LMT-28, which was measured by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Taken together, our data suggest that LMT-28 is a novel synthetic IL-6 inhibitor that functions through direct binding to gp130.",

We report a case of a 31-year-old man with no known comorbidities who presented to a tertiary healthcare unit with a 1-month history of difficulty in breathing, palpitations, weight loss and hoarseness of voice. On examination, his thyroid gland was palpable and fine hand tremors were present. An initial provisional diagnosis of hyperthyroidism was made. Three months after initial presentation, the patient presented in emergency with severe muscle pain and inability to stand. Laboratory results revealed hypokalaemia. All the symptoms reverted over the next few hours on administration of intravenous potassium. A diagnosis of TTP was established. After initial presentation, the patient was treated with carbimazole and propranolol. Once he was euthyroid, radioactive iodine ablation therapy (15\u2005mCi) was carried out as definitive therapy, after which the patient's symptoms resolved; he is currently doing fine on levothyroxine replacement and there has been no recurrence of muscle paralysis.",

To provide more biological information about fargesin, we investigated the effects of fargesin on isoproterenol-(ISO-) induced cells injury in the high expression \u03b21 adrenergic receptor/Chinese hamster ovary-S (\u03b21AR/CHO-S) cells and occluding the left coronary artery- (LAD-) induced myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury in rats. The results in vitro showed that ISO-induced canonical cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA) levels were decreased by fargesin in \u03b21AR/CHO-S cells. Fargesin attenuated the serum creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and improved histopathological changes of ischemic myocardium compared with the I/R rats. Similar results were obtained with Evans Blue/TTC staining, in which fargesin notably reduced infarct size. Moreover, compared with the I/R group, fargesin increased COX release and the activities of some endogenous antioxidative enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), but suppressed malondialdehyde (MDA), and intracellular ROS release. Additionally, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay demonstrated fargesin suppressed myocardial apoptosis, which may be related to inhibition of caspase-3 activity. Taken together, these results provided substantial evidences that fargesin as a potential \u03b21AR antagonist through cAMP/PKA pathway could protect against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats. The underlining mechanism may be related to inhibiting oxidative stress and myocardial apoptosis.", 
    "117": "A substrate-immobilized (SI) TiO2 nanofiber (NF) photocatalyst for multiple uses was prepared through electrospinning and hot pressing. The rate of furfuryl alcohol degradation under UV irradiation was found to be the highest when the anatase to rutile ratio was 70:30; the rate did not linearly increase as a function of the NF film thickness, mainly due to diffusion limitation. Even after eight repeated cycles, it showed only a marginal reduction in the photocatalytic activity for the degradation of cimetidine. The effects of pH and different organic matter characteristics on the photodegradation of cimetidine (CMT), propranolol (PRP), and carbamazepine (CBZ) were investigated. The pH-dependence of the photocatalytic degradation rates of PRP was explained by electrostatic interactions between the selected compounds and the surface of TiO2 NFs. The degradation rates of CMT showed the following order: deionized water > l-tyrosine > secondary wastewater effluent (effluent organic matter) > Suwannee River natural organic matter, demonstrating that the characteristics of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) can affect the photodegradation of CMT. Photodegradation of CBZ was affected by the presence of DOM, and no significant change was observed between different DOM characteristics. These findings suggest that the removal of CMT, PRP, and CBZ during photocatalytic oxidation using SI TiO2 NFs is affected by the presence of DOM and/or pH, which should be importantly considered for practical applications.",

The purpose of this randomised control trial study is to compare the effectiveness, safety and the tolerability of pregabalin toward Propranolol in migraine prophylaxis of children. From May 2011 to October 2012, 99 children 3-15 years referred to the neurology clinic of Mofid Children's Hospital with a diagnosis of migraine enrolled the study. Patients randomly divided into two groups (A&B). We treated children of group A with capsule of pregabalin as children of group B with tablet of propranolol for at least 8 weeks. In this study, 99 patients were examined that 91 children reached the last stage. The group A consistsed of 46 patients, 12(26.1%) girls, 34 (73.9%) boys and the group B consisted of 45 patients, 14(31.1%) girls, 31 (68.9%) boys. Basis of age, gender, headache onset, headache frequency, migraine type, triggering and relieving factors there was no significant difference among these groups (P>0.05). After 4 and 8 weeks of Pregabalin usage monthly headache frequency decreased to 2.2\u00b14.5 and 1.76\u00b16.2 respectively. Propranolol reduced monthly headache frequency up to 3.73\u00b16.11 and 3.34\u00b15.95 later 4 and 8 weeks respectively. There was a significant difference between these two groups according to headache frequency reduction (P=0.04).

JLNS is a ventricular repolarization abnormality and is caused by mutations in the KCNQ1 or KCNE1 gene. It has a high mortality rate in childhood due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, episodes of torsade de pointes which may cause syncope or sudden cardiac death. Here, we present a 4.5-year-old female patient who had a history of syncope and congenital sensorineural deafness. She had a cochlear implant operation at 15 months of age and received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) at 3 years of age because of recurrent syncope attacks. Five months after cochlear implant placement, she could say her first words and is now able to speak. With \u03b2-blocker therapy and ICD, she has remained syncope-free for a year. On the current admission, the family visited the genetics department to learn about the possibility of prenatal diagnosis of sensorineural deafness, as the mother was 9 weeks pregnant. A diagnosis of JLNS was established for the first time, and a homozygous missense mutation in the KCNQ1 gene (c.128 G>A, p.R243H) was detected. Heterozygous mutations of KCNQ1 were identified in both parents, thereby allowing future prenatal diagnoses. The family obtained prenatal diagnosis for the current pregnancy, and fetal KCNQ1 analysis revealed the same homozygous mutation. The pregnancy was terminated at the 12th week of gestation.

Second ECG recording 3\u00a0h later showed slightly slower heart rate and revealed marked QTU interval prolongation suggesting the cause of her syncopal attacks. After cessation of Garenoxacin, the QTU interval prolongation shortened. However, both epinephrine infusion and treadmill exercise test reproduced similar QTU interval prolongation and T wave deformities. Later, genetic analysis demonstrated that this patient had a mutation in KCNH2 gene, and she was diagnosed as a type-2 long-QT syndrome which was accentuated by use of garenoxacin. At the emergency out-patient clinic, repetitive ECG recordings can be useful and should be considered in order to identify the cause of syncopal attacks in patients who were prescribed antibiotics and had mild QT interval abnormalities.",

However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Using a classical contextual fear-conditioning model, we investigated the effect of novelty on long-lasting extinction memory in rats. We found that exposure to a novel environment but not familiar environment 1 h before or after extinction enhanced extinction long-term memory (LTM) and reduced fear reinstatement. However, exploring novelty 6 h before or after extinction had no such effect. Infusion of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2AR) inhibitor propranolol and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) inhibitor RU486 into the CA1 area of the dorsal hippocampus before novelty exposure blocked the effect of novelty on extinction memory. Propranolol prevented activation of the hippocampal PKA-CREB pathway, and RU486 prevented activation of the hippocampal extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2)-CREB pathway induced by novelty exposure. These results indicate that the hippocampal \u03b2AR-PKA-CREB and GR-Erk1/2-CREB pathways mediate the extinction-enhancing effect of novelty exposure. Infusion of RU486 or the Erk1/2 inhibitor U0126, but not propranolol or the PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMPS, into the CA1 before extinction disrupted the formation of extinction LTM, suggesting that hippocampal GR and Erk1/2 but not \u03b2AR or PKA play critical roles in this process.

The effect of raising the concentration of acetylcholine from 100, 200 and 400 \u00b5M to overcome the curcumin-induced inhibition of detrusor contractility and the effects of the reversal agents tetraethylammonium, a potassium channel blocker (100 \u00b5M), glibenclamide, an ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker (10 \u00b5M), and propranolol, a beta adrenergic receptor blocker (1 \u00b5M), on the inhibitory effect of detrusor contractility was also studied. Curcumin caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of acetylcholine-induced contractility of the isolated detrusor muscle which was statistically significant at all three concentrations of curcumin used. This inhibition was partially overcome by raising the concentration of ACh to 200 and 400 \u00b5M. The inhibition was overcome by the concurrent administration of tetraethylammonium. Glibenclamide reversed the inhibitory effect of 100 \u00b5M curcumin, but not that of 300 \u00b5M curcumin. Propranolol reversed the inhibitory effect of 100 \u00b5M curcumin but not that of 300 \u00b5M curcumin. These results suggest that curcumin inhibited the contractions of the isolated detrusor muscle.

MAS contains negatively charged SiO(-) groups, while QPM contains positively charged quaternary ammonium groups. The basic idea is to be able to provide desired water and drug permeability by simply varying the amount of added MAS. Thin, free films of varying composition were prepared by casting and exposed to 0.1M HCl and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer. The water uptake kinetics and water vapor permeability of the systems were determined gravimetrically. The transport of propranolol HCl, acetaminophen, methyl-, ethyl- and propylparaben across thin films was studied using side-by-side diffusion cells. A numerical solution of Fick's second law of diffusion was applied to determine the apparent compound diffusion coefficients, partition coefficients between the bulk fluids and the films as well as the apparent film permeability for these compounds. The addition of MAS resulted in denser inner film structures, at least partially due to ionic interactions between the positively charged quaternary ammonium groups and the negatively charged SiO(-) groups. This resulted in lower water uptake, reduced water vapor permeability and decreasing apparent compound diffusivities. In contrast, the affinity of the investigated drugs and parabens to the films substantially increased upon MAS addition.

This trend for more thorough cardiovascular nonclinical safety evaluation is prudent given the high attrition rate of potential therapeutics due to unexpected cardiovascular liabilities discovered in late-stage clinical trials or post-market approval. In particular, the causal relationship of blood pressure changes that lead to risk of major adverse cardiac events suggests hemodynamic changes should be critically evaluated in preclinical studies of novel therapeutics.", 
    "205": "Jacketed external telemetry with an implanted miniature blood pressure transmitter (JET-BP) was used to characterize the tolerability, functionality, and sensitivity of this study design in dogs. Thirty-six male or female beagles (n=6 dogs/sex/group) were administered vehicle control (reverse osmosis water) or etilefrine (1, 10mg/kg), sotalol (3, 30mg/kg), and hydralazine (1, 10mg/kg) on separate days. Telemetry data were evaluated for positive control article-related changes and retrospective power analysis was also completed. Animals were evaluated for instrumentation-related changes in clinical and anatomic pathology endpoints.", 
    "206": "All three positive controls elicited the expected pharmacologic responses that were statistically different at high and low doses. Retrospective power analysis confirmed this study design was able to statistically differentiate minor (approximately 5 to 15%) changes in electrocardiography and blood pressure values. This study also demonstrated the potential advantages of combining cardiovascular data across sex when the test article exposure and pharmacodynamics were consistent. Data collection using miniature telemetry blood pressure transmitters did not result in anatomic or clinical pathology findings that would prevent their use in general toxicology studies.", 
    "207": "This characterization study indicates that JET-BP in dogs offers a scientifically-robust method to evaluate novel therapeutics for potential cardiovascular liabilities.", 
    "208": "The therapeutic equivalence of generic and brand name antiepileptic drugs has been questioned by neurologists and the epilepsy community. A potential contributor to such concerns is pharmaceutical quality. The objective was to assess the biopharmaceutic risk of brand name Lamictal 100 mg tablets and generic lamotrigine 100 mg tablets from several manufacturers. Lamotrigine was characterized in terms of the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS), including aqueous solubility and Caco-2 permeability. A panel of pharmaceutical quality tests was also performed on three batches of Lamictal, three batches of Teva generic, and one batch of each of four other generics: appearance, identity, assay, impurity, uniformity of dosage units, disintegration, dissolution, friability, and loss on drying. These market surveillance results indicate that all brand name and generic lamotrigine 100 mg tablets passed all tests and showed acceptable pharmaceutical quality and low biopharmaceutic risk. Lamotrigine was classified as a BCS class IIb drug, exhibiting pH-dependent aqueous solubility and dissolution. At pH 1.2 and 4.5, lamotrigine exhibited high solubility, whereas lamotrigine exhibited low solubility at pH 6.8, including non-sink dissolution. Lamotrigine showed high Caco-2 permeability. The apparent permeability (Papp) of lamotrigine was (73.7 \u00b1 8.7) \u00d7 10(-6) cm/s in the apical-to-basolateral (AP-BL) direction and (41.4 \u00b1 1.6) \u00d7 10(-6) cm/s in the BL-AP direction, which were higher than metoprolol's AP-BL Papp of (21.2 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 10(-6) cm/s and BL-AP Papp of (34.6 \u00b1 4.6) \u00d7 10(-6) cm/s. Overall, lamotrigine's favorable biopharmaceutics from a drug substance perspective and favorable quality characteristics from a tablet formulation perspective suggest that multisource lamotrigine tablets exhibit a low biopharmaceutic risk.", 
    "209": "A novel paper spray cartridge with an integrated solid phase extraction (SPE) column is described. The cartridge performs extraction and pre-concentration, as well as sample ionization by paper spray, from complex samples such as plasma. The cartridge allows for selective enrichment of target molecules from larger sample volumes and removal of the matrix, which significantly improved the signal intensity of target compounds in plasma samples by paper spray ionization. Detection limits, quantitative performance, recovery, ionization suppression, and the effects of sample volume were evaluated for five drugs: carbamazepine, atenolol, sulfamethazine, diazepam, and alprazolam. Compared with direct paper spray analysis of dried plasma spots, paper spray analysis using the integrated solid phase extraction improved the detection limits significantly by a factor of 14-70, depending on the drug. The improvement in detection limits was, in large part, due to the capability of analyzing larger sample volumes. In addition, ionization suppression was found to be lower and recovery was higher for paper spray with integrated SPE, as compared to direct paper spray analysis. By spiking an isotopically labeled internal standard into the plasma sample, a linear calibration curve for the drugs was obtained from the limit of detection (LOD) to 1 \u03bcg/mL, indicating that this method can be used for quantitative analysis. The paper spray cartridge with integrated SPE could prove valuable for analytes that ionize poorly, in applications where lower detection limits are required, or on portable mass spectrometers. The improved performance comes at the cost of requiring a more complex paper spray cartridge and requiring larger sample volumes than those used in typical direct paper spray ionization.", 
    "210": "Glaucoma is a common eye disease that can lead to irreversible vision loss if left untreated. The early diagnosis and treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma is challenging, and visual impairment in Chinese glaucoma patients is a serious concern. Most of these patients need more than one topical antiglaucoma agent to control their intraocular pressures (IOPs). In the People's Republic of China, the daily cost of different glaucoma medication varies greatly, and the treatment habits differ throughout the country. Prostaglandin analogs (PGAs) are recommended as first-line monotherapy, because of their efficacy and low risk of systemic side effects. Fixed-combination drops, particularly PGA-based fixed combinations, have recently been developed and used in patients with progression or who have failed to achieve their target IOPs. Here, we reviewed the current literature on the use of bimatoprost-timolol fixed combination (BTFC) in the People's Republic of China. BTFC has achieved good efficacy and tolerability in Chinese clinical trials. In addition, BTFC is more cost effective compared with other fixed combinations available in the People's Republic of China. Fixed-combination drops may offer benefits, such as keeping the ocular surface healthy, convenience of administration, and improvement in long-term adherence and quality of life. Therefore, BTFC has great potential for the treatment of Chinese glaucoma patients. However, the long-term efficacy of BTFC, comparisons of BTFC with other fixed-combination drugs, and treatment adherence and persistence with treatment in Chinese patients are unknown and will require further study.",

    "212": "We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 610 patients with breast cancer. Thereafter, we compared overall disease-free survival (DFS) between \u03b2-blocker users and nonusers.", 
    "213": "Those not receiving \u03b2-blockers had a relatively longer mean DFS (10.8 vs. 9.7 years), although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.651). When the survival analysis was adjusted for age, tumor stage, hormone receptor status and HER2 status, the results remained unaltered, suggesting that \u03b2-blocker use did not significantly improve overall DFS (HR, 0.849; 95% CI, 0.537-1.343; p = 0.485).", 
    "214": "Our findings failed to confirm previous results indicating a potential antitumor effect of \u03b2-blockers.", 
    "215": "The increasing occurrence of pharmaceutical drugs in the aquatic environment is cause of concern, due to the possibility of toxic phenomena in non-target species, including oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. The present study aimed to assess the acute effect of four widely used therapeutic agents: acetaminophen (analgesic), chlorpromazine (antipsychotic), diclofenac (anti-inflammatory) and propranolol (antihypertensive), in the cladoceran species Daphnia magna. Considering the involvement of the mentioned compounds in the impairment of cholinesterasic activity and modifications in cellular redox systems, the purpose of this study was to analyze their effects on biomarkers of neuronal regulation, such as total cholinesterases (ChEs), and enzymatic oxidative stress defense, including as catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), and total and selenium-dependent glutathione-peroxidase (total GPx; Se-GPx) activities. Exposure to acetaminophen caused a significant inhibition of AChE and Se-GPx activities in D. magna relative to the control. Among the biomarkers of oxidative stress, only the activity of CAT was significantly altered in concentration of 0.001mg L(-1) of chlorpromazine, which was not always consistent with the literature. Diclofenac caused a significant inhibition of AChE and Se-dependent GPx, and also in total GPx activities. Propranolol was responsible for a significant decrease in the activity of the latter two enzymes, and also a slight increase of GSTs activity. The results indicated that the exposure to all the tested compounds induced alterations on the cellular redox status in the studied species. In addition, acetaminophen and diclofenac were shown to have the capability of interfering with D. magna neurotransmission, through the inhibition of ChEs. Our data enlighten the need for more research on the ecological consequences of pharmaceuticals in non-target organisms.", 
    "216": "Recent studies have suggested that the use of systemic beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers can induce regression of choroidal neovascularization in rodent models. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if these agents have a protective effect against the development of choroidal neovascularization in patients with age-related macular degeneration.", 
    "217": "In this single-center retrospective case-control study, the charts of 250 patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration were compared with those of 250 controls with dry age-related macular degeneration. Charts were reviewed for current and past use of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. Frequency tables were generated, and associations were examined using chi-square tests, t-tests, and multivariate logistic regression.", 
    "218": "There was no statistically significant difference between rates of beta-blocker use (P = 0.57), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors use (P = 0.20), or angiotensin receptor blockers use (P = 0.61) between the 2 groups. Additionally, there was no statistically significant difference between rates of use of combinations of the above drugs between the two groups.", 
    "219": "Although there is growing evidence that beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers can induce regression of choroidal neovascularization in rodent models, these medications do not seem to confer a protective effect against the development of choroidal neovascularization in patients with age-related macular degeneration.", 
    "220": "Increasing evidence suggests that beta-blocker use might be associated with reduced mortality in prostate cancer patients. To provide a quantitative assessment of this association, we pooled data available to examine the association between beta-blocker use and mortality of prostate cancer.", 
    "221": "We identified studies by a literature search of MEDLINE (from 1 January 1966) and EMBASE (from 1 January 1974), through 10 September 2014, and by searching the reference lists of pertinent articles. Two authors independently screened and reviewed the eligibility of each study. The primary outcomes were prostate cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality.", 
    "222": "A total of four studies including 16,825 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Analysis of all studies showed that beta-blocker use was associated with reduced prostate cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio =0.85, 95% confidence interval =0.77-0.94), without any heterogeneity between studies (Q=3.59, I2=16.5%, P=0.309). However, we observed no association with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio =0.97, 95% confidence interval =0.90-1.04). There was also no evidence of the presence of significant heterogeneity between the four studies (Q=2.48, I2=0.0%, P=0.480).",

    "224": "Pancreatic islets (PIs) are damaged under diabetic conditions, resulting in decreased PI size. This study examined the regenerative effects of coffee and its components (caffeine, CFI; trigonelline, TRG; chlorogenic acid, CGA) on zebrafish larval PIs and \u03b2-cells damaged by administration of alloxan (AX). In addition, the influence of coffee and its active components on KATP channels was investigated using diazoxide (DZ) as a KATP channel activator. PI size and fluorescence intensity were significantly increased in the coffee-treated group relative to the no-treatment group (P < 0.0001). In addition, coffee exerted significant regenerative effects on pancreatic \u03b2-cells (p = 0.006). Treatment with TRG and CGA rescued PI damage, and the combination of TRG/CGA had a synergistic effect. In conclusion, the results indicate that coffee has beneficial effects on AX-damaged PIs and may also be useful as a blocker of pancreatic \u03b2-cell K(+) channels."
