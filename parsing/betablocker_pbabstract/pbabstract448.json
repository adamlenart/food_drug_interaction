    "1": "One hundred sixty men with a peak VO2 less than 25 ml/kg/min and without effort angina were randomized to receive enalapril 20 mg qd or placebo on a double-blind basis. The mean age was 60.3 +/- 7.6 years. All patients received concurrent beta-blocker therapy for secondary prophylaxis. Treatment began at 21 days (group 1, n = 100) or more than 6 months after infarction (group 2, n = 60). Patients underwent exercise with real-time gas-exchange analysis nine times over the course of 48 weeks. In group 1, improvement in exercise performance occurred during the course of the trial in both groups of patients receiving placebo or enalapril. The mean peak VO2 for the placebo-treated patients in group 1 increased from 18.3 +/- 3.4 ml/kg/min by 4.9% at 48 weeks (p less than 0.05). The corresponding values for enalapril-treated patients were 18.9 +/- 3.8 ml/kg/min with a 3.7% increase (p = 0.07). Total exercise time increased in the placebo-treated patients from 645 +/- 96 seconds by 7.3% (p less than 0.01). Corresponding values for enalapril-treated patients were 674 +/- 103 seconds with a 5.4% increase (p less than 0.01). In group 2, the mean peak VO2 at baseline for the placebo-treated patients of 20.3 +/- 3.8 ml/kg/min increased by 4.4% at 48 weeks (p = NS). The corresponding values for enalapril-treated patients were 19.2 +/- 3.6 ml/kg/min with a 2.6% increase (p = NS). Total exercise time increased in the placebo-treated patients from 677 +/- 114 seconds by 0.7% (p = NS). Corresponding values for enalapril-treated patients were 659 +/- 99 seconds with a 1.1% increase (p = NS). There were no significant differences between the placebo and enalapril subgroups at any time with regard to peak VO2, exercise duration, or the VO2 at the anaerobic threshold.", 
    "2": "This trial demonstrates that long-term converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril had no significant effect on the peak or submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise performance over the course of 1 year in men after myocardial infarction with only mildly reduced exercise capacity.", 
    "3": "Beta adrenergic blockade diminishes the catecholamine-mediated elevations in heart rate and myocardial contractility that characterize postburn hypermetabolism. To examine how these alterations in cardiac performance affect peripheral perfusion, indirect calorimetry and leg blood flow were measured before and then after a 2-hour intravenous propranolol infusion. Five severely burned patients (55% + 7% total burn surface area), given propranolol at 8 micrograms/kg/minute, had a significant reduction in cardiac index and heart rate with an increased leg vascular resistance resulting in a decrease in extremity perfusion. Four healthy volunteers were given propranolol at 5 micrograms/kg/minute, resulting in a comparable decrease in heart rate, yet there was no change in leg vascular resistance or extremity perfusion. In both patient groups, propranolol decreased the plasma lactate concentration. This suggests that in hypermetabolic patients, beta adrenergic blockade reduces peripheral perfusion and that peripheral perfusion is not a principal determinate of plasma lactate levels. Rather adrenergic blockade appears to decrease lactate concentration as a consequence of the inhibition of lipolysis.", 
    "4": "Previous studies have demonstrated substantial changes in Doppler-derived indexes of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function in response to changes in loading conditions. To assess the influence of autonomic reflexes on these indexes, 2-dimensional and Doppler echophonocardiography were performed in 8 normal male subjects before and during autonomic blockade (0.2 mg/kg of propranolol and 0.04 mg/kg of atropine, intravenously) in the supine, passive upright 80 degree tilt and passive leg-raised positions, and during supine isometric exercise. During autonomic blockade in the supine position, there were significant increases in transmitral peak late filling velocity (A) (mean +/- standard error of the mean +34 +/- 7%) and isovolumic relaxation time (+18 +/- 9%), and significant decreases in transmitral peak early filling velocity (E) (-20 +/- 7%), deceleration time (-35 +/- 7%) and E/A ratio (-40 +/- 5%). E/A ratio decreased from 2.0 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 with autonomic blockade. When either upright tilt or isometric handgrip exercise was combined with autonomic blockade, the pattern of diastolic filling became distinctly \"abnormal,\" with E/A ratio decreasing to 0.9 +/- 0.1. The effect of volume loading (increased end-diastolic volume and increased peak E) was seen in the legs-raised position only during autonomic blockade. It is concluded that autonomic blockade substantially alters the Doppler indexes of LV diastolic filling and modifies both hemodynamic response and Doppler indexes produced by positional changes and by isometric exercise.", 
    "5": "We studied the effect of propranolol administration on risk assessment based on submaximal exercise testing performed early after myocardial infarction. A total of 70 patients with recent infarction underwent modified Bruce treadmill testing with simultaneous measurement of expired gases in the absence of antianginal agents including beta-antagonists. Among these, 31 patients who had at least one of the following abnormalities--ST depression greater than or equal to 1 mm (22 patients), chest pain (four patients), or treadmill time less than 360 seconds (12 patients)--were studied in a randomized double-blind fashion and received either placebo or 240 mg of propranolol/day. A total of 28 patients completed the randomized phase and were able to undergo repeat exercise testing an average of 3.4 +/- 1.8 days later. Randomized groups were equivalent at baseline except for a higher peak oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production (p less than 0.05) in the propranolol compared with the placebo group; these differences were taken into account in statistical analyses of the study data. Resting heart rate (59 +/- 1.2 versus 82 +/- 4.2 beats/min) and peak heart rate x systolic blood pressure (14,208 +/- 496 versus 20,075 +/- 1,062) were both significantly less (p less than 0.01) after propranolol than after placebo. Eight of nine patients treated with placebo maintained ST depression greater than or equal to 1 mm from the initial to the randomized exercise test, compared with only 4 of 13 receiving propranolol (p less than 0.01). In those with continued ST depression, time to positivity was significantly longer in those receiving propranolol compared with those taking placebo (538 +/- 73 versus 318 +/- 44 seconds, p less than 0.05). In contrast, the peak ratio between carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption was higher in those receiving propranolol compared with those receiving placebo (0.93 +/- 0.04 versus 0.81 +/- 0.03, p less than 0.05). We conclude that propranolol therapy reduces evidence of ischemia and changes traditional estimates of potential cardiac risk derived from submaximal postinfarction exercise testing.", 
    "6": "Assessment of left ventricular function is influenced by a number of hemodynamic factors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the end-systolic regional wall stress-dimension relation in a series of 25 mongrel dogs. In Group A (n = 18) the regional wall stress-velocity of circumferential fiber shortening relation was measured before and after three interventions: volume infusion, metoprolol infusion and dobutamine infusion. The electrocardiogram, left ventricular pressure and its first derivative (dP/dt), arterial pressure and echocardiograms were recorded at baseline and after phenylephrine administration (to increase afterload). For each dog values for regional wall stress were plotted against the velocity of circumferential fiber shortening. For all dogs the relations were inversely linear (r = -0.65 to -0.98). Volume infusion increased end-diastolic volume (p less than 0.05) without shifting the slope or intercept of the relation, indicating its independence from preload. Dobutamine caused a shift in the intercept to the right but no change in slope and metoprolol shifted the relation to the left without altering the slope. The effect of ischemia and reperfusion on the end-systolic regional wall stress-length relation was examined in Group B (n = 7), at baseline, after 5 min of mid-left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and after 10 min of reperfusion. Afterload was increased by hydraulic aortic occlusion. Regional wall stress was lowest at baseline, highest during ischemia and intermediate after reperfusion (100.2 +/- 32.1, 193.5 +/- 81.5, 141.9 +/- 67.6 kdyn/cm2, respectively, p less than 0.001). The end-systolic regional wall stress-length relation was linear during baseline, ischemia and reperfusion (r = 0.96, 0.95, 0.98, respectively, p less than 0.05). Ischemia caused an increase in the slope and a shift in the intercept to the right compared with baseline. Reperfusion represented an incomplete return toward baseline. This study demonstrates that the regional wall stress-velocity of circumferential fiber shortening relation is linear, independent of preload, incorporates afterload and is sensitive to changes in contractility. In addition, the regional wall stress-length relation can be measured in a nonhomogeneously contracting left ventricle and is predictably altered by ischemia and reperfusion. This relation may prove useful to determine whether alterations in regional systolic function result from changes in local load or contractility in the left ventricle with a regional wall motion abnormality.", 
    "7": "The chronic administration of theophylline was studied in twenty patients with essential tremor in a double-blind cross-over trial. The tremor was improved significantly after four weeks of treatment. In mice the chronic administration of theophylline was compared with propranolol on the modulation by adenosine, 5-HT, (-)isoprenaline or GABA of NMDA-induced depolarisation of neocortical slices. Adenosine depolarisation was abolished by two-weeks treatment with theophylline but not propranolol. Potentiation by (-)isoprenaline of NMDA responses was reduced by theophylline (100 mg/kg/day) and propranolol treatment (25 mg/kg/day), but a lower dose of propranolol further increased it. The enhancement by 5-HT of NMDA-induced depolarisation was unaffected by the pretreatment with theophylline, while the higher dose of propranolol blocked it. GABA caused no significant change of NMDA depolarisation in control slices, but after theophylline treatment (100 mg/kg/day) and propranolol administration at both doses it significantly potentiated NMDA depolarisation. The enhancement of GABA sensitivity might be an important common factor in decreasing the essential tremor after propranolol and theophylline treatment.", 
    "8": "The effect of propranolol on thyroid hormones of 7 healthy subjects and 10 patients with histologically proven alcoholic liver cirrhosis was investigated. The fractions of plasma T3 and free T4 were determined by specific radioimmunoassay before and after two weeks of propranolol administration. Under basal conditions, both T3 and FT4 levels were found significantly lower in patients with cirrhosis than in healthy subjects (1.86 +/- 0.10 vs. 1.18 +/- 0.41 nmol/l, p less than 0.001; 9.31 +/- 0.41 vs. 8.17 +/- 0.91 pg/ml, p less than 0.05, respectively). In healthy subjects propranolol administration led to a significant reduction of T3 serum levels (from 1.88 +/- 0.10 to 1.51 +/- 0.12 nmol/L, p less than 0.001), while in patients with liver cirrhosis no significant changes in T3 and FT4 were found. In patients with liver cirrhosis propranolol administration did not affect thyroid hormone levels.", 
    "9": "Transdermal administration of drugs possesses several advantages in therapy, but is limited by generally poor penetration through the skin. The aim of this study was to assess whether in vivo transdermal absorption could be enhanced by using microemulsions (ME) as vehicles. Water uptake from the occluded skin changes the water-free microemulsion base (MEB) into a ME. The increasing content of water decreases the solubility of apolar drugs. This leads to in situ formation of a super-saturated ME that possesses a particularly high absorption rate due to the enhanced diffusion pressure of the drug. A saturated solution of the model drugs bupranolol (B) and timolol (T) in a water-free microemulsion base was applied to an clipped area of the dorsal skin of rabbits with an occlusive patch. Evaluations were made in comparison to matrix patches (M) containing 1.2 mg/cm2 B or 2.0 mg/cm2 T. The beta-blocker dose applied was 2.0 mg/kg body weight throughout the study. The measured parameter of the pharmacodynamic effect was the maximal heart rate (HR) after an i.v. bolus injection of a standard dose of isoproterenol. Observations were made in different intervals over a 10-h time period after application of the patches. The response to isoproterenol was calculated as beta-blocker effect. Faster increasing effects and higher maxima for both drugs was found after application in MEB compared to M. After administration of B and T in MEB the effects were found to be identical, with a maximum (85-90%) after 2 h. Application in M showed B to be less effective (34%, 10h no plateau) than T (74%, 10h). Therefore microemulsions represent an improved vehicle for transdermal administration of test drugs.", 
    "10": "During acute obsidan testing, the hemodynamics was evaluated in the pulmonary circuit and right heart cavities of 60 patients with Functional Classes III-IV exertional angina pectoris, by using two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographies of the pulmonary artery. According to the left ventricular myocardial volume/mass ratio, the patients were divided into 3 morphofunctional types of coronary heart disease (CHD). All the patients were found to have diminished contractility and pump function in the left heart along with moderately elevated blood pressure in the left heart and compensatory hyperfunction in the right heart, which are largely evident in the hypertrophic morphofunctional type of CHD. The degree of pulmonary hypertension was related to the severity of left ventricular dysfunction, whereas in the dilated type it was associated with its contractile disorders. In patients with the dilated and mixed types of CHD, obsidan caused a marked decrease in pulmonary hypertension, while in those with hypertrophic CHD it promoted its slight increase.", 
    "11": "The effects of nicardipine and propranolol on patients' quality of life were compared during a double-blind, multicentre, parallel, randomised study of hypertension therapy. After a placebo run-in period, the doses for each patient were successfully titrated to reduce supine diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mmHg with either nicardipine 60 or 90 mg/day (123 patients) or with propranolol 90-240 mg/day (120 patients). Both drugs demonstrated similar efficacy in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Total duration of therapy ranged from 6-12 weeks. The Nottingham Health Profile questionnaire was used to assess the effect of each treatment on the patients' quality of life. The overall quality of life score for patients on nicardipine showed a tendency toward improvement, while for those on propranolol, the trend was toward overall worsening. The differences between the two treatment groups were statistically significant for males (P = 0.02). The analysis of the separate components of this evaluation demonstrated that physical mobility was reported to be decreased more for the propranolol-treated patients than for the nicardipine-treated patients (P = 0.02). In contrast to the propranolol-treated patients, the nicardipine-treated patients reported improvements for sleep, social life, work, sex life, and for activities related to hobbies and interests. A second questionnaire was used to assess the effects of the therapies on work productivity. Among those patients who worked for pay, more patients treated with propranolol than those treated with nicardipine rated themselves as less productive at work (P = 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "This randomised, double-blind, crossover study compared enalapril 5 mg, and atenolol 50 mg, each dosed once daily for 4 weeks, and investigated casual and diurnal BP changes using 24 hour ambulatory BP monitoring. Both atenolol and enalapril satisfactorily lowered BP during the day and no excessive falls occurred at night. The tendency for BP to increase during the day and decrease at night was maintained during both active periods. Pulse rate was reduced only by atenolol throughout 24 hours. The BP increase observed 2 hours after rising in the morning was suppressed by atenolol but not by enalapril. Both drugs reduced the rates of systolic (greater than or equal to 160 mmHg) and diastolic (greater than or equal to 95 mmHg) BP increases to half of those during placebo. The frequency with which diastolic BP increased above these limits was less during the atenolol period. The difference in BP between a hospital casual reading and the mean 24 hour ambulatory reading was reduced only by atenolol. Furthermore, only atenolol suppressed the BP and pulse rate increases on exercise.",

    "14": "We investigated airway response to propranolol in 48 asthmatics, 17 subjects with chronic bronchitis and 19 normal subjects. The positive rate for propranolol challenge was 93.8% in asthma group, 5.9% in chronic bronchitis group while none in normal group had positive response. The challenge was highly reproducible, and it had few side-effects. This indicated that the challenge was specific and sensitive in diagnosis of asthma, it was a safe, reliable method of measuring non-specific airway responsiveness. Furthermore we also demonstrated that PC20 for propranolol did not relate to PC20 for methacholine, and that the calibre of airway did not significantly influence the airway response to propranolol.", 
    "15": "Responses to bilateral vagal nerve stimulation, to field stimulation, and to exogenous methacholine and histamine were compared in tracheas isolated from (a) saline injected (i.p.) and saline-aerosol exposed guinea pigs (control), (b) ovalbumin-sensitized and saline-aerosol exposed (sensitized) guinea pigs, and (c) ovalbumin-sensitized and 2% ovalbumin-aerosol exposed (challenged) guinea pigs. Tracheal pressor responses (cmH2O; 1 cmH2O = 98.1 Pa) to nerve and field stimulation, and maximal responses to methacholine and histamine were significantly increased in animals from group c compared with groups a and b. Dose-response lines in response to the two agonists, expressed as percent maximal contraction, did not differ among the groups. The M1 antagonist pirenzepine (0.1-10 nM) selectively reduced responses to nerve stimulation in all three groups. The M2 antagonist gallamine potentiated responses to nerve or field stimulation in all three groups. We conclude that M1, M2, and M3 muscarinic receptor functioning is similar in control and ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs. Changes in post-receptor transduction mechanisms may mediate the increased responsiveness noted in animals from group c.", 
    "16": "1. Single oral 20 mg doses of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors pravastatin and lovastatin, with and without concomitant propranolol (40 mg twice daily), were administered to 16 healthy male subjects participating in a randomized, four-way crossover study. 2. Serum concentrations of total and active inhibitors were measured by bioassay and concentrations of pravastatin, two pravastatin metabolites and lovastatin acid were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 3. Coadministration of propranolol with pravastatin reduced the mean area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) of total inhibitors by 23%, of active inhibitors by 20% and of pravastatin by 16%. 4. Coadministration of propranolol with lovastatin also resulted in decreases in the mean serum AUC of total inhibitors by 18%, of active inhibitors by 12% and of lovastatin acid by 13%. 5. These decreases in systemic drug concentrations may reflect enhanced drug first-pass hepatic clearance in the presence of propranolol. 6. The clinical significance of these changes is likely to be small.", 
    "17": "Glaucoma filtering surgery fails most frequently due to fibrosis at the episcleral-conjunctival/Tenon's capsule interface. Sherwood et al have suggested that chronic topical antiglaucoma medications increase conjunctival inflammatory cells, which could increase the likelihood of fibrosis and subsequent bleb failure. In a pilot study in a rabbit model, we placed timolol, pilocarpine, and epinephrine, or a combination of all three, in one eye of 24 animals twice daily for 7 months. The fellow eye received distilled water. Microscopic examination revealed no statistically significant change in the number of acute or chronic inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, or goblet cells in the treated as compared with the control eyes. A longer duration of drug administration, or drug administration followed by surgical intervention, may be required to produce an effect on the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule, if such an effect exists.", 
    "18": "Several reports have documented a contralateral intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect after unilateral instillation of timolol. Data derived from the Glaucoma Laser Trial (GLT), a randomized trial of the efficacy and safety of argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) as compared with the efficacy and safety of topical medications as initial therapy for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), demonstrated an estimated mean pressure reduction of 0.5 mm Hg in the contralateral eye that had received ALT. This contralateral effect is smaller than that observed in other studies of POAG patients. Lower initial IOP, longer duration of treatment with timolol, and/or improved outflow facility modulation in the ALT-treated eyes may be responsible for the smaller contralateral effect of timolol observed in the GLT patients.", 
    "19": "A significant potentiation of antiarrhythmic effect was observed in 121 dogs with arrhythmias 24 and 48 hours after the coronary artery ligation when the following drugs were combined: N-propylajmaline bromide (1A class) and trimecaine (1B class), quinidine (1A class) and trimecaine, N-propylajmaline bromide and anaprilin (2 class). The potentiation is attributed to the different molecular mechanisms of action of the drugs.", 
    "20": "Atenolol, a cardioselective beta blocker, was administered following unsuccessful treatment with propranolol to a male with a significant history of paruresis. During atenolol therapy, the client reported a decrease in ANS symptoms but no increase in ability to urinate in public restrooms. Rationale for use of atenolol is discussed.", 
    "21": "In a prospective, randomized controlled trial, 43 patients with cirrhosis and variceal hemorrhage were allocated after control of the bleeding to treat by elective sclerotherapy alone (n = 23) or by oral propranolol after elective sclerotherapy (n = 20). The dose of oral propranolol was based on a reduction of the resting pulse rate by 25%. The end points of the study were rebleeding or death. Both treatment groups were comparable with respect to origin and severity of liver disease, size of esophageal varices and portal pressure at entry. The mean follow up was 27 +/- 19 months for all patients. Patients treated sclerotherapy alone had more rebleeding (n = 11) did than those in the sclerotherapy plus propranolol (n = 3). The cumulative percentages of patients free of rebleeding 1 and 2 years after inclusion were 77 and 66% in sclerotherapy alone, and 100 and 85% in sclerotherapy plus propranolol; the difference between the two groups was significant. No statistically significant effect on mortality was seen. These data support that oral propranolol after sclerotherapy reduces the risk of recurrent bleeding in cirrhotics treated elective sclerotherapy.", 
    "22": "Effect of propranolol (1 and 3 mg/kg body wt), a sympathetic blocking agent, on ECG patterns was studied in Varanus and Acridotheres. ECG was recorded before and after 5 min (immediate), 15 min and in some cases 25 min of drug infusion. All animals responded to propranolol with bradycardia. The effectiveness is dose dependent and it is also associated with the high heart rate both in Acridotheres and in Varanus. The P-R or P-S interval increased in all cases of Varanus after infusion. In Acridotheres height and duration of P-wave were increased slightly with the lower dose and decreased with the higher dose. The Q-S shortened with the lower dose and widened late with the higher dose in Varanus whereas in Acridotheres it is widened with lower and higher doses of propranolol. The Q-T interval has been increased in both groups of animals. An increased amplitude of T-wave height was observed in Varanus after 5 and 15 min of drug infusion. But it was noted with decrease in amplitude under high dose after 15 min of drug infusion. In Acridotheres it was on increase with lower dose and decrease with higher dose. The delta-wave disappeared after the administration of propranolol in Acridotheres.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "The Study on the treatment of 50 cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage (by applying beta-receptor blocking drug propranolol) and the control group of 55 cases revealed that the mortalities of the therapeutic group and the control group were respectively 4% and 9.2% (P less than 0.05) the incidences of the cerebral vasospasm were 2% and 10.6% (P less than 0.01) and those of the abnormal electrocardiograms were 6% and 21.8% (P less than 0.01). The differences between the two group were significant. The function of propranolol may be associated with the sudden increase of catecholamine after subarachnoid haemorrhage and there for the drug has the function of protection of the cardiac muscle and prevention of the cerebral vasospasm.", 
    "24": "The aim was to evaluate the effects of digoxin, propranolol, and verapamil on exercise in patients with chronic isolated atrial fibrillation.", 
    "25": "Patients with chronic isolated atrial fibrillation underwent maximal exercise testing before and after the administration of digoxin, propranolol, or verapamil. Heart rate, oxygen uptake and oxygen pulse were observed at rest, at gas exchange anaerobic threshold, and at peak exercise.",

    "27": "During exercise without medication, the heart rate was 85 (SD 8) beats.min-1 at rest, 127(19) at the level of anaerobic threshold, and 175(17) at peak exercise. With digoxin, heart rate was reduced to 75(9) beats.min-1 at rest (control v digoxin, p less than 0.01). However, reduction of heart rate was not seen at anaerobic threshold or at peak exercise. With propranolol, heart rate was 63(7) beats.min-1 at rest, 99(16) at anaerobic threshold, and 138(28) at peak exercise (control v propranolol, all p less than 0.01). Heart rate with verapamil was 70(13) beats.min-1 at rest, 107(30) at anaerobic threshold, and 138(28) at peak exercise (control v verapamil, p less than 0.05 at rest and at anaerobic threshold, p less than 0.01 at peak exercise. Neither digoxin, nor propranolol, nor verapamil changed the oxygen uptake during exercise. Without medication, oxygen pulse was 6.5(2.0) ml.beat-1 at anaerobic threshold and 7.7(2.1) ml.beat-1 at peak exercise. With digoxin, the change of oxygen pulse, versus without medication, was not significant at rest or at anaerobic threshold but was increased at peak exercise, at 8.3(2.1) v 7.7(2.1) ml.beat-1, p less than 0.05. With propranolol, oxygen pulse was increased to 8.2(1.9) ml.beat-1 at anaerobic threshold and 9.2(2.3) ml.beat-1 at peak exercise (control v propranolol, both p less than 0.01).

    "28": "Digoxin was effective in reducing heart rate at rest, but failed to reduce it during exercise. Propranolol and verapamil reduced heart rate at all levels of exercise as well as at rest. Oxygen uptake during exercise (total exercise capacity) was not reduced with propranolol or verapamil; this was thought to have been accomplished by an increased oxygen pulse.", 
    "29": "The cardiovascular side effects of the abrupt cessation of treatment with 0.5% levobunolol hydrochloride eyedrops in 10 healthy subjects (5 women and 5 men) aged 18 to 30 years were investigated in a double-blind randomized crossover study. The subjects received either levobunolol eyedrops or placebo drops for 7 days, then, after a 14-day washout period, they received the alternative drops for 7 days. The heart rate and blood pressure at rest, the maximal heart rate and blood pressure on treadmill exercise stress testing and duration of exercise were recorded before treatment began, at the end of treatment and 14 days after withdrawal of the drops. The mean resting heart rate was significantly lower during treatment with levobunolol than with placebo (p less than 0.05). The mean exercise duration was significantly longer during treatment with levobunolol (p less than 0.05); to our knowledge, we are the first to report this finding. There were no significant differences in mean arterial pressure, double product (product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure) or maximal heart rate between the groups at any measurement.", 
    "30": "The capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry of trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetyl, trifluoroacetyl and pentafluoropropionyl (PFP) derivatives of the antiarrhythmic agent propafenone (Rytmonorm), as well as its main metabolites N-despropyl-propafenone and 5-hydroxy-propafenone, have been investigated. Both electron impact and positive isobutane chemical ionization mass spectrometry using the Ion Trap Detector have been evaluated. The presence of propafenone and its co-extracted metabolites in human urine at time intervals after the oral administration of 150 mg Rytmonorm to healthy volunteers was established, and the urinary excretion of propafenone and 5-hydroxy-propafenone was calculated using selective chemical ionization mass spectrometric detection. Only a few per cent of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. Large intersubject variabilities had been observed also. The large dynamic range of the Ion Trap Detector and the high correlation coefficients (0.92-0.99) of the calibration curves were striking.", 
    "31": "We attempted to investigate the alterations in the vasoconstrictor thromboxane (TXA2) system in the kidney when spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were treated subchronically with atenolol, a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist. Atenolol treatment (30 mg/kg body weight per day for 2 weeks) reduced systolic blood pressure by 11%, being accompanied by a decrease in heart rate. This treatment strikingly decreased thromboxane content in the renal cortex by 48% (p less than 0.05), whereas the tissue content was unaltered for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) or slightly decreased for prostacyclin (PGI2). These alterations in the eicosanoid system led to an increase in the ratio of PGE2/TXA2 and of PGI2/TXA2. Similarly, thromboxane content in the renal papilla was lowered significantly with atenolol treatment, which raised the ratio of PGE2 to TXA2. Thromboxane reduction was not observed in the aortic walls and heart. However, in the vascular walls, PGI2 synthesis was markedly stimulated with atenolol treatment, resulting in an increase in the ratio of PGI2 to TXA2. Thus, these data indicate that subchronic atenolol-treatment inhibits the thromboxane system in the kidney, thereby shifting the eicosanoid system towards a vasodilator state. These alterations contribute, in part, to the anti-hypertensive properties of atenolol in genetic hypertension.", 
    "32": "1. In the longitudinal muscle of guinea-pig gastric fundus, adrenaline and phenylephrine (1-30 microM) both produced a slow contraction preceded by a relaxation. The slow contraction was strongly inhibited by prazosin (0.1 microM), but only weakly by yohimbine (1 microM), suggesting main contribution of alpha 1-adrenoceptors. 2. Most of the slow contraction was blocked by meclofenamate or indomethacin (0.1-0.3 microM). Both these drugs also inhibited spontaneously generated muscle tone. In some preparations, obtained from the apical fundus, a small contraction remained in the presence of meclofenamate. 3. During contraction induced by prostaglandin E2, adrenaline produced sustained relaxation and phenylephrine often transient relaxation, in the presence of meclofenamate. The transient relaxation, but not the sustained relaxation, was suppressed by prazosin. 4. In the presence of prostaglandin E2 (5 nM), after treating with phenoxybenzamine (30 microM) for 30 min, isoprenaline and adrenaline produced concentration-dependent relaxation, with IC50 s of 3.9 nM and 64 nM, respectively. Propranolol shifted these concentration-response curves to the right, with apparent pA2 s of 8.15 and 7.34, respectively. 5. It is suggested that in the fundic longitudinal muscle, adrenaline-induced contraction is mediated mainly by an increase in endogenous prostaglandin production through activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors and that adrenaline produces transient relaxation through alpha 1-adrenoceptors and sustained relaxation through beta-adrenoceptors. The beta-adrenoceptors in the longitudinal muscle are more sensitive to adrenaline and isoprenaline than those in the circular muscle.", 
    "33": "Labetalol was evaluated in a multicenter, placebo-controlled study of elderly patients (greater than or equal to 60 years) with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After a placebo-washout period, doses were titrated from 100 mg BID to a maximum of 400 mg BID over a 6-week period. Once blood pressure control (standing diastolic blood pressure [SDBP] less than 90 mm Hg and greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg reduction from baseline) was achieved or the maximum allowable dosage had been given, the dosage remained the same until the end of the study. The titration phase was followed by a 4-week maintenance period. Blood pressure control was achieved in 37/54 (69%) of the patients who were treated with labetalol compared with 21/58 (36%) of the patients who received placebo (P less than .001). Twenty-nine (78%) of those controlled on labetalol responded to doses of 200 mg or less BID, and there was no significant difference between groups with respect to orthostatic blood pressure changes. Adverse experiences were generally mild and occurred with similar frequency in the labetalol and placebo groups; six patients who received labetalol and five who received placebo withdrew from the study due to adverse experiences, but in only one case (labetalol) was the adverse experience considered drug-related. In summary, labetalol effectively and safely lowered diastolic blood pressure in the elderly without producing significant orthostatic changes.", 
    "34": "A patient with chest pain was found to have obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. After the first oral dose of propranolol, syncope developed together with atrioventricular block. An electrophysiologic study revealed an intermittent advanced (His-Purkinje) block within the atrioventricular conduction system. Caution is recommended when treatment is initiated in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in whom there is any suspicion of abnormalities in the atrioventricular conduction tissues.", 
    "35": "The effects of steady-state flosequinan, a new peripheral vasodilator, and propranolol on glucose tolerance and plasma lipids in 22 non-insulin-dependent diabetics were investigated in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled, three-way crossover trial. Flosequinan produced no impairment of glucose tolerance compared with placebo. Propranolol produced significant increases in fasting plasma glucose (P less than 0.01) and increases in the area under the glucose tolerance curve (P less than 0.05) compared to placebo. No significant effects on cholesterol levels were seen on either treatment but triglyceride levels were significantly elevated on propranolol compared with placebo (P less than 0.01). These data suggest that flosequinan, used in therapeutic dosage, has no adverse metabolic effects on the non-insulin-dependent diabetic and this may be an advantage for a drug used in the treatment of hypertension or congestive heart failure.", 
    "36": "The acute haemodynamic effect of carvedilol, a new non-selective beta-receptor blocker with vasodilating effect, was examined at rest supine and sitting and during 100 W bicycle exercise in 18 patients (mean age 44 years) with essential hypertension. Intra-arterial blood pressure and heart rate were recorded continuously. Cardiac output was measured by dye dilution (Cardiogreen). Two h after the first oral dose (12.5-25 mg) of carvedilol, blood pressure was reduced in all patients sitting at rest, from 176/110 to 153/101 mmHg (P less than 0.001), associated with a reduction in cardiac index (16%; P less than 0.001) while total peripheral resistance remained unchanged or was slightly reduced. When sitting up after 2 h supine rest two patients had hypotensive reactions (excessive blood pressure drop; cold, pale, sweating skin) which disappeared after lying down with elevation of the legs and light physical exercise. The fall in cardiac index was due to reduction both in heart rate (8%, P less than 0.001) and stroke index (9%; P less than 0.01). During exercise the reduction in cardiac output was less (6%; P less than 0.05) while a clear reduction (6%; P less than 0.01) was seen in total peripheral resistance. This acute haemodynamic response is different from that seen immediately after conventional beta-blockers when total peripheral resistance always increases.", 
    "37": "The effects of passive upright tilting from 0 degrees to +60 degrees (n = 27), Valsalva maneuver (n = 16) and respiration (n = 10) on the rate of atrial flutter were studied in 27 patients. After tilting to +60 degrees, the atrial flutter cycle length shortened in all patients from 247.5 +/- 7 to 236.7 +/- 6.9 ms (range of shortening 1 to 21 ms, p less than 0.001). The Valsalva maneuver (strain of 40 mm Hg) shortened the flutter cycle length during the strain (phase 2) from 242.2 +/- 4.6 to 230.5 +/- 5 ms (range of shortening 2 to 19 ms, p less than 0.001). In 10 patients whose respiration was monitored, the flutter cycle length consistently prolonged during inspiration and shortened during expiration. Combined beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptor blockade in six patients did not significantly alter the flutter cycle length at rest or the effects of the various maneuvers on the changes in flutter cycle length. This study revealed that the atrial flutter cycle length can be shortened by passive upright tilting, the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver and expiration. Changes in flutter cycle length were independent of autonomic tone, implying that by decreasing cardiac volume, these maneuvers affect characteristics of the atrial flutter circuit, thereby producing dynamic changes in the rate of atrial flutter.", 
    "38": "We examined the possible role of altered humoral immunity in Chagas' disease by analyzing the effect of sera on the binding of radioligand to beta-adrenoceptors during the course of human Trypanosoma cruzi infection. We described two circulating IgG which bind with myocardial beta 1- and spleen cell beta 2-adrenoceptor. Both chagasic IgG against beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors increased intracellular levels of cAMP, which could be blocked by specific beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists. The IgG against the beta 1-adrenoceptor inhibited the action of norepinephrine on the contractility of atria. We also found differences in the distribution of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antibodies in the course of infection. The anti-beta 2-adrenoceptor IgG appears during the acute stage, peaks on the group with less than 10 years of infection, and then decreases. The prevalence of anti-beta 1-adrenergic antibody is low in the acute stage, but it increases over time since infection, being higher in the group with more than 15 years of infection. The probable pathogenic role of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic chagasic antibodies is discussed.", 
    "39": "Electroconvulsive shock (ECS) applied immediately after passive avoidance learning in rats caused partial amnesia. This could be prevented by administering r-ANP into the lateral brain ventricle. The effects of pre-treatment with different receptor blockers: (haloperidol, atropine, phenoxybenzamine, propranolol, naloxone, bicuculline and methysergide) on the ANP-induced antiamnesia were investigated. The receptor blockers per se in the doses selected had no influence on the ECS-induced amnesia. Haloperidol, atropine and propranolol blocked the antiamnestic action of the peptide, while phenoxybenzamine, naloxone, bicuculline and methysergide were ineffective. The results confirm our previous observations that ANP might play a role in learning and memory processes and also suggest that the antiamnestic action of the peptide is mediated by dopaminergic, cholinergic and beta-adrenergic mediator systems.", 
    "40": "Long-term beta-adrenergic stimulation has been shown to desensitize the beta-adrenoceptor/adenylyl cyclase signalling pathway at both the receptor and the G-protein level. To further elucidate the cellular mechanism of G-protein regulation we investigated the influence of prolonged infusion of isoprenaline (2.4 mg/kg.d) on myocardial mRNA levels of different G-protein alpha-subunits in rats. For comparison rats were treated with triiodothyronine (T3; 0.5 mg/kg.d) which induces cardiac hypertrophy like isoprenaline but has different effects on the adenylyl cyclase system. Isoprenaline- and T3-treated animals developed an increase in heart/body weight ratio of 41 +/- 3% and 27 +/- 4%, respectively (P less than 0.05). Isoprenaline increased myocardial total RNA concentration by 39 +/- 6% (P less than 0.05). Hybridization with 32P-labeled rat cDNAs demonstrated an expression rank order of Gs alpha-mRNA greater than Gi alpha-2-mRNA greater than Gi alpha-3-mRNA and no detectable expression of Gi alpha-1-mRNA in rat myocardium. mRNA levels of Gs alpha, Gi alpha-2 and Gi alpha-3 were 36.9 +/- 1.28, 10.7 +/- 1.07 and 3.7 +/- 0.19 pg/micrograms total RNA, respectively. Isoprenaline increased Gi alpha-2- and Gi alpha-3-mRNA concentrations per microgram total RNA by 49 +/- 18% and 27 +/- 7%, respectively (P less than 0.05). This effect was abolished by simultaneously administered propranolol (9.9 mg/kg.d), indicating a beta-adrenoceptor-mediated mechanism. In contrast, T3-induced cardiac hypertrophy was not accompanied by changes in Gi alpha-mRNA expression. Gs alpha-mRNA levels were unaffected by either treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "With the objective of trying to prove the regression of ventricular mass in patients with essential hypertension, with and without left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), we studied 42 patients of both sexes with echocardiography, measuring the left ventricular mass (LVM), the mean parietal thickness (MPT) and the relative parietal thickness (RPT), before and after one month of random treatment with atenolol, verapamil and xipamide, independently that the blood pressure control was or not satisfactory. We found significant reductions in the MPT with verapamil and atenolol (p = 0.006 and 0.036), although only verapamil induced a significant reduction of the LVM. The RPT did not shown any significant modification, although the tendency was opposed with xipamide and the other two groups, verapamil and atenolol. The factor Adequate control of the blood pressure, with any of the treatments, proved to be helpful in the favorable evolution of the regression. The degree of LVH before treatment does not appear to have any influence in the posterior evolution with the treatment.", 
    "42": "The cytokine interleukin-1 beta may have an important role in the autoimmune mediated damage of pancreatic Beta cells in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In the present study we have investigated the effects of an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein, a blocker of the type I interleukin-1 receptor, on the suppressive actions of recombinant interleukin-1 beta on insulin-producing cells. Brief exposure (1-2 h) of rat and mouse pancreatic islets to 10 ng/ml recombinant interleukin-1 beta induced an 70-80% inhibition of insulin response to glucose after 12 h. These effects were completely counteracted by co-incubation with 100 ng/ml interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein. When rat islets were cultured for 48 h in the presence of recombinant interleukin-1 beta (5 ng/ml) higher concentrations of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (5000 ng/ml) were required to protect Beta-cell function. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein also counteracted the inhibitory effects of recombinant interleukin-1 beta on the growth of the rat insulinoma cell line RINm5F. These data suggest that interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein can protect insulin-producing cells from the deleterious effects of recombinant interleukin-1 beta, and that these cells possess type I interleukin-1 receptors.", 
    "43": "It has been proposed that intrathyroid lymphocytes, localized in specific anatomical sites might have distinct, pathophysiologically relevant functions in Graves' disease. However, most studies of intrathyroidal lymphocytes were restricted to two lymphocyte locations and used semiquantitative methods. Therefore we used seven anatomically different lymphoid compartments to classify and evaluate by quantitative representative methods the total intrathyroidal lymphocytic infiltration and the staining indexes for immunoglobulin-producing plasmocytes and primed T cells (CD45RO), which provide maximum help to pokeweed mitogen-stimulated immunoglobulin synthesis in 36 thyroid glands from patients with Graves' disease. We found only 3.4% of all intrathyroidal lymphocytes intraepithelially. However, only intraepithelial lymphocytes showed a significantly higher staining index for primed T cells compared with several other compartments. There was also a high staining index for immunoglobulin-producing lymphocytes in this compartment. Kappa- and lambda-positive plasmocytes were found in a polyclonal distribution (kappa:lambda = 64.1: 35.9) in all compartments. This increased incidence of CD45RO-positive T lymphocytes and of immunoglobulin-producing lymphocytes among the intraepithelial lymphocytes suggests a distinct pathophysiological function of lymphocytes in peripolesis in Graves' disease. Furthermore, there is a polyclonal intrathyroidal immunoglobulin synthesis.", 
    "44": "Although silent ischemia may be linked to increases in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the long-term effects of a strategy aimed at the detection and treatment of this asymptomatic condition have not been fully explored. We therefore have developed the Atenolol Silent Ischemia Trial (ASIST), the first multicenter, randomized, prospective study of the prognostic implications of silent ischemia in asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic patients with coronary artery disease. Inclusion criteria for study patients were documented coronary artery disease, evidenced angiographically or by previous myocardial infarction, and transient ischemia, evidenced by abnormalities of regional wall motion, stress thallium-201, or exercise electrocardiogram. The main objective of ASIST is to assess the influence of frequency and duration of symptomatic and asymptomatic ischemic episodes on the occurrence of fatal and nonfatal cardiac events. Atenolol, a beta 1-selective adrenergic blocker, was chosen as the therapeutic intervention because of its potential benefits in treating both symptomatic and asymptomatic ischemia. Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring will be used to measure the frequency and duration of ischemic episodes during daily life. The predictive ability of short-term (4-week) effects on long-term (52-week) response to atenolol treatment is also being assessed, along with the economic impact of this diagnostic and therapeutic strategy. Given the current emphasis on reducing morbidity and mortality associated with coronary artery disease, ASIST results should shed light onto the long-term management and prognostic implications of this otherwise asymptomatic condition.", 
    "45": "T cell proliferation, in the presence of monocytes, triggered either by an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or by a mitogenic pair of anti-CD2 mAbs was inhibited either by the calcium chelator EGTA or the calcium channel blocker nifedipin. Antibodies against interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibited T cell proliferation in both mitogenic systems. However inhibition achieved by anti-IL-1 beta Ab was greater than by anti-IL-1 alpha Ab while the combination of both anti-rIL-1 alpha Ab + anti-rIL-1 beta could completely inhibit the CD3-triggered T cell proliferation. On the other hand, IL-1 production by LPS-stimulated monocytes was strongly decreased both by EGTA and nifedipin. Northern blot analysis showed that this inhibition paralleled a decrease of IL-1 alpha and beta messenger RNA (mRNA) expression only in the presence of EGTA but not in the presence of nifedipin. These results indicate that EGTA acted at the transcriptional level while nifedipin acted at a yet undefined posttranscriptional level. Thus, it is suggested that the impairment of T cell proliferation by calcium inhibitors could result not only from an effect on Ca2+ influx in T cells but also from interfering with the function of accessory cells, such as the production of IL-1.", 
    "46": "Celiprolol is a hydrophilic, beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist with mild selective beta 2-agonist as well as weak vasodilator properties. Celiprolol 200 to 400mg once daily by mouth is similar in antihypertensive efficacy to usual doses of propranolol, atenolol, metoprolol and pindolol in patients with mild to moderate systemic hypertension. Similar doses of celiprolol are as efficacious as propranolol and atenolol in improving exercise tolerance and reducing the frequency of anginal attacks in patients with angina pectoris. Further clinical experience suggests that celiprolol does not produce bronchoconstriction and may have mild bronchodilating activity in asthmatic patients; it may also enhance the effects of bronchodilator drugs. Celiprolol has a slightly beneficial effect on serum lipid profiles, and does not appear to exert adverse effects on carbohydrate metabolism. If the apparent pharmacodynamic advantages of celiprolol translate into clinical benefits and are confirmed in well designed long term clinical trials, then celiprolol should represent a definite advance in beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "47": "The cardiovascular effects of the phenyldihydropyridine derivative elgodipine (0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 microgram/kg/min) were studied in normal conscious pigs and in pigs with chronic left ventricular dysfunction (LVD, caused by coronary artery occlusion) without and after beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol (0.5 mg/kg + 0.5 mg/kg/h). In normal pigs, elgodipine increased cardiac output from 2.57 +/- 0.09 to 5.21 +/- 0.24 L/min (p less than 0.05) as a result of a doubling of the heart rate. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased from 94 +/- 2 to 76 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) as a result of a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Left ventricular (LV) dP/dtmax increased (by up to 78 +/- 9%), but left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) remained unchanged. After propranolol administration elgodipine did not increase LV dP/dtmax, and the increase in heart rate was attenuated, resulting in a smaller increase in cardiac output (from 2.11 +/- 0.13 to 3.09 +/- 0.23 L/min, p less than 0.05), but an unchanged vasodilator response. In pigs with LVD, elgodipine increased cardiac output and LV dP/dtmax less than in normal animals, but the vasodilator response was not affected. LVEDP decreased from 14.6 +/- 1.6 to 11.7 +/- 2.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). In animals with LVD, propranolol caused a more severe depression of systemic hemodynamics, but did not modify the cardiovascular responses to elgodipine. Its cardiovascular profile suggests that elgodipine may not only be useful in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders for which other dihydropyridines are already in use, but also in mild chronic heart failure.", 
    "48": "Nebivolol is a new beta 1-antagonist that acutely reduces arterial blood pressure without depressing cardiac function. The present study was designed to determine the effect of nebivolol on coronary arteries. Rings of canine left anterior descending coronary (LAD) artery with or without endothelium were suspended in organ chambers and the isometric tension was recorded. In some experiments, the transmembrane potential of the smooth muscle cells was recorded by electrophysiological methods. During contractions to prostaglandin F2 alpha, nebivolol induced concentration-dependent relaxations of the coronary arteries. The enantiomer, l-nebivolol, also induced comparable relaxations; however, d-nebivolol induced smaller relaxations. The relaxations induced by nebivolol and its enantiomer were significantly larger in tissues with than in those without endothelium. The differences between tissues with and without endothelium were abolished by nitro-L-arginine (3 x 10(-5) M) or methylene blue (10(-5) M). The nebivolol-induced relaxations were not affected by indomethacin (10(-5) M), phentolamine (5 x 10(-6) M), propranolol (5 x 10(-6) M), or methysergide (3 x 10(-6) M). Nebivolol at a subthreshold concentration for inducing relaxation (3 x 10(-7) M) did not significantly affect endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine but potentiated ADP-induced endothelium-dependent relaxations. The potentiation is stereoselective for l-nebivolol. Nebivolol induced a small hyperpolarization of the coronary smooth muscle with endothelium (1 mV).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "50": "A prospective study of admissions to an Irish provincial coronary care unit in the light of reported benefits of streptokinase and oral aspirin as reported in the Isis study was carried out. Of 115 patients admitted with suspected myocardial infarction (M.I.), the diagnosis was confirmed in 41. The average delay from onset of chest pain to admission to C.C.U. was 6.65 hours (0.3-18 hours, median 6 hours). Twenty-six of the 41 patients were given streptokinase after a median time lapse of six hours from the onset of pain. 88% of the M.I. patients were on oral aspirin at discharge but only 12% were on oral beta blockers. These findings are compared with the findings of the Isis 2 study worldwide and in Ireland. The presence of risk factors in the patients with M.I. is analysed, 16 of the 41 had serum cholesterol levels greater than 6 mmols/l. As an index of community risk factor screening, an enquiry was made of the patients and of their family doctor as to whether serum cholesterol had previously been checked, this had been done in only 12 of 41 and in only 2 had it been carried out by the family doctor.

    "51": "Acute oral administration of alpha 2-antagonists (yohimbine, RX 821002, atipamezole: 1 mg/kg each) reduced dog food intake. Yohimbine reduced food intake over 20 hours, while the effect of the two other drugs lasted only 2 hours. Yohimbine (0.4 or 1 microgram/kg) gave the same results. At these doses, it promoted a lasting durable increase in plasma nonesterified fatty acids and catecholamines levels and a transient elevation of plasma insulin levels. The beta-antagonist nadolol (4 mg/kg per os) suppressed the yohimbine-induced lipid mobilization without modifying its anorectic effect. Chronic oral yohimbine (0.4 mg/kg/day during 14 days) reduced food intake and promoted a weight loss. Normal food intake was recovered two days after yohimbine withdrawal. No change was observed in the number of platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. In addition to their lipid mobilizing action and sympathetic tone stimulation, alpha 2-antagonist compounds reduce food intake.", 
    "52": "The influence of the alpha 1b-adrenoceptor-selective antagonist chlorethylclonidine on the alpha 1-adrenergic positive inotropic effect and the phosphoinositide hydrolysis induced by phenylephrine was investigated in the rabbit ventricular myocardium. Pretreatment of membrane fractions derived from the rabbit ventricular muscle with 10(-5) mol/l chlorethylclonidine decreased the specific binding of [3H]prazosin (at a saturating concentration of 10(-9) mol/l) from the control value of 11.27 +/- 0.48 to 4.18 +/- 1.87 fmol/mg protein. The inhibition by adrenaline of the binding of [3H]prazosin (slope factor and affinity) was not affected by chlorethylclonidine. The positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine (in the presence of 3 x 10(-7) mol/l bupranolol) was inhibited by chlorethylclonidine in a concentration-dependent manner (10(-7)-10(-5) mol/l) and abolished by 10(-5) mol/l chlorethylclonidine. The concentration of chlorethylclonidine to inhibit the phenylephrine-induced maximum response to 50% was 2.4 x 10(-6) mol/l. The accumulation of [3H]inositol monophosphate and [3H]inositol trisphosphate induced by 10(-5) mol/l phenylephrine was inhibited by chlorethylclonidine in the same concentration range. These findings indicate that the myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptors mediating a positive inotropic effect in the rabbit ventricular myocardium may belong to the chlorethylclonidine-sensitive alpha 1b-subtype, and that the subcellular mechanism of action involve phosphoinositide hydrolysis.", 
    "53": "1. The noradrenergic (NA) afferent system, which originates mainly from the locus coeruleus and projects to the cerebellar cortex, may act on the corresponding neurons by utilizing not only alpha- but also beta-adrenoceptors. Since the vermal cortex of the cerebellar anterior lobe receives a labyrinth input and projects to the lateral vestibular nucleus (LVN), experiments were performed in precollicular decerebrate cats to find out whether the noradrenergic system intervenes in the control of posture as well as of the dynamic characteristics of vestibulospinal (VS) reflexes elicited by recording the multiunit EMG responses of the forelimb extensor triceps brachii of both sides to roll tilt of the animal at 0.15 Hz, +/- 10 degrees. In particular, we used the method of local microinjection into the vermal cortex of the cerebellar anterior lobe of the non-selective beta-adrenergic agonist ((+/-) -isoproterenol hydrochloride) or antagonist (dl-propranolol hydrochloride) to act on both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. 2. Unilateral injection into the vermal cortex of the culmen of isoproterenol (0.25-0.50 microliters at the concentration of 8-16 micrograms/microliter of saline stained with pontamine 5%) decreased the extensor tonus in the ipsilateral forelimb, while the postural activity either remained unmodified or slightly increased in the contralateral fore-limb. The same injection significantly increased the gain (imp./sec/deg) of the first harmonic component of the EMG responses of the ipsilateral and to a lesser extent also of the contralateral triceps brachii to animal tilt. This effect was also associated with slight changes in the phase angle of the responses, which remained positional throughout the experiments. The effects described above occurred within 5-10 min after the injection and reached the highest values after 20-30 min; they were then followed for about 2 hours after the injection, before disappearing. 3. In contrast to these findings, injection in other experiments of 0.25-0.50 microliter of a solution of propranolol at the concentration of 16 micrograms/microliter of saline increased the extensor tonus in the ipsilateral limbs, while the decerebrate rigidity either remained unmodified or slightly decreased in the contralateral limbs. In addition, the amplitude of modulation and thus the response gain of the ipsilateral triceps brachii to the same parameters of animal tilt decreased. This effect was associated with slight changes in the phase angle of the responses. There was also a slight but insignificant decrease in gain of the responses recorded contralaterally to the side of the propranolol injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "54": "Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to investigate the effects of paroxetine (8.3 mg/kg), amitriptyline (26 mg/kg) and desipramine (17 mg/kg), administered daily in the drinking water for 21 days, on the number of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in the cortex of the rat. In addition, the effect of these drugs on the function of beta-adrenoceptors was examined by measuring noradrenaline- and isoprenaline-stimulated production of cyclic AMP in slices of cortex. Paroxetine did not alter the number of cortical beta 1 or beta 2-adrenoceptors nor did it induce any functional changes in beta-adrenoceptor-linked adenylyl cyclase. In contrast, desipramine caused a significant reduction in the density of beta 1-adrenoceptors and in the sensitivity of both noradrenaline and isoprenaline-stimulated adenylyl cyclase. Although amitriptyline significantly reduced the number of beta 1-adrenoceptors in cortical membranes, no such changes could be detected by autoradiography. It is apparent from these and other studies, that the ability of antidepressants to down-regulate central beta-adrenoceptors is not a property shared by all antidepressants. In particular, the more potent and selective inhibitors of the uptake of 5-HT, such as paroxetine, appear to be devoid of effects on this receptor system.", 
    "55": "Adrenergic alpha-receptors blockers have been used for a long time in the treatment of hypertension. The use of original non-selective alpha 1-blockers was restricted by the occurrence of undesirable side-effects. Therapeutic interest in alpha-blockers was restored after the discovery of selective adrenergic alpha 1-blockers. Since 1976 when the first selective alpha 1-blocker, prazosine, appeared on the market a number of quinazoline derivatives was developed (terazosine, doxazosine, trimazosine) and non-quinazoline alpha 1-blockers (indoramine, ketanserine, urapidil etc.). Selective alpha 1-blockers normalize the BP by reducing the pathologically raised peripheral vascular resistance without changing the cardiac output. They influence the capacity as well as resistant vascular system and reduce thus the pre-load and after-load. Alpha 1-blockers do not affect, or increase slightly the renal blood flow without altering glomerular filtration. Treatment with selective alpha 1-blockers is associated with a smaller tachycardia than treatment with direct vasodilatating agents or non-selective alpha-blockers. Contrary to saluretics and some beta-blockers, alpha 1-blockers have a favourable effect on plasma lipoproteins, insulin resistance, glucose metabolism and they support the regression of hypertrophy of the vascular wall and the left ventricle. Alpha 1-blockers are effective as monotherapy and when combined with other antihypertensive drugs. They are well tolerated with a small number of undesirable side-effects. Selective alpha 1-blockers reduce the BP in a haemodynamically favourable way and exert a favourable effect on other risk factors of ischaemic heart disease in hypertonic patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "The influence of lipophilicity on the conjunctival penetration of beta blockers in the pigmented rabbit was investigated and compared with that on corneal penetration. The beta blockers were hydrophilic sotalol, atenolol, nadolol, pindolol, and acebutolol; lipophilic metoprolol, timolol, oxprenolol, levobunolol, labetalol, and alprenolol; and the very lipophilic propranolol and betaxolol. Drug penetration was evaluated by using the isolated pigmented rabbit conjunctiva and cornea in the modified Ussing chamber and was monitored by reversed phase HPLC. The conjunctiva was more permeable to all the beta blockers than was the cornea. A sigmoidal relationship, rather than the familiar parabolic relationship, best described the influence of lipophilicity on both conjunctival and corneal drug penetration. The ratio of corneal to conjunctival permeability coefficients was most sensitive to changes in log PC within the region of 1.5 and 2.5. Outside of this region, the ratio was relatively independent of changes in lipophilicity. For several beta blockers, their intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may play a minor role in influencing their conjunctival and corneal penetration.",

The substantial changes in the action mode of the mentioned drugs as the enhancement of their hypotensive effect on the intraocular pressure (IOP) have been demonstrated under the performance of the above mentioned procedure. When applied after promethazine instillations, timolol induced significantly increased outflow facility of the aqueous humor that was not usually noted in the cases of timolol topical instillations without a pretreatment of the eye with promethazine. The similar increased hypotensive effect on the IOP was noted for adrenaline when it has been used after promethazine treatment. The possible mechanisms underlying the changes in pharmacological activities of the investigated adrenergic drugs are discussed.", 
    "58": "We conducted a series of studies aimed at investigating the effect of beta-blockers on exercise physiology. On the basis of these and other existing studies, it is possible to draw the following conclusions and to make the following tentative recommendations for patients engaged in exercise training who receive beta-blocker therapy: i) CAD patients treated with beta-blockers are capable of deriving the expected enhancement of cardiorespiratory fitness during training, irrespective of the type of drug used; ii) beta1-selective blockers are preferable to nonselective agents for hypertensive patients engaged in exercise training; iii) because beta1-selective blockers impair exercise tolerance in some hypertensive patients, physicians should look out for this adverse reaction and, if present, consider alternative antihypertensive therapy; iv) intrinsic sympathomimetic activity confers no advantage during exercise training; v) exercise intensity prescription for patients receiving beta-blockers should be in accordance with traditional guidelines and based on results of individualized exercise testing performed on medication; vi) exercise training is desirable during beta-blocker therapy in that it appears to offset adverse alterations in lipoprotein metabolism; and vii) nonselective beta-blockers may increase predisposition to exertional hyperthermia, and patients must therefore be encouraged to adhere strictly to accepted guidelines for heat injury prevention.", 
    "59": "Although millions of hypertensive individuals receive chronic treatment with antihypertensive medication, the effect on the central nervous system by these drugs is poorly understood. Such treatment, while generally well tolerated, frequently produces symptoms of drowsiness, weakness, altered memory and impaired concentration. In addition to subjective evidence derived from patient reports, a large number of investigations have now been published which attempt to objectively assess the influence of antihypertensive medication on behavioral or cognitive performance. This paper summarizes and critically evaluates experimental studies of the effect of antihypertensive medication on subjects' performance of neuropsychological tasks and reviews the pharmacologic mechanisms by which these drugs may affect behavior. The literature is incomplete in its assessment of all domains of neuropsychological performance and all drug classes, and methodologic deficiencies are common. Nonetheless, the consensus of all studies and the findings of well-designed studies in particular do not identify any notable areas of performance impairment in patients receiving antihypertensive medication. Moreover, results suggest that, in certain instances, drug treatment may even enhance performance. In light of the limitations of the literature, however, an adequate understanding of the effects of antihypertensive therapy on behavioral functioning awaits completion of large, well-designed investigations including all major drug classes and thorough neurobehavioral assessments.", 
    "60": "1. The chronotropic effects of a novel class III antiarrhythmic drug, UK-68,798, and the beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol, for comparison, were studied on spontaneously beating right atria isolated from guinea-pigs in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of isoprenaline (10(-10)-10(-4) M). 2. UK-68,798 (10(-9)-10(-5) M) decreased spontaneous atrial rate by 6-21%. Propranolol (10(-8) -10(-6) M) also had a negative but significantly smaller chronotropic effect. 3. UK-68,798 dose-dependently reduced the maximal positive chronotropic effect induced by isoprenaline, but without significantly shifting the concentration-response curve for isoprenaline in a parallel fashion. A pD'2 value of 5.88 was obtained. As expected, propranolol displayed a competitive inhibition with a pA2 value of 8.21. 4. The results demonstrate a negative chronotropic effect of UK-68,798, which is not associated with a beta-adrenoceptor blocking action. We suggest that the negative chronotropic effect is linked with potassium channel blockade and thereby the class III antiarrhythmic action of UK-68,798.", 
    "61": "1. Experiments were carried out in order to characterize the receptors mediating relaxant responses to catecholamines in the rat gastric fundus. The effects of noradrenaline, isoprenaline and the 'atypical' or beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist, BRL 37344, on methacholine-induced tone were measured. Prazosin, propranolol and cyanopindolol were used as antagonists. 2. Relaxant responses to noradrenaline, in the presence of propranolol (1 microM) were antagonized in a concentration-dependent manner by prazosin (0.01 to 1 microM), although this antagonism was weak and non-competitive in nature. Relaxant responses to isoprenaline, in the presence of prazosin (0.1 microM), were antagonized only by the highest concentration of propranolol (1 microM) giving a pKB of 6.3 BRL 37344 also relaxed the rat gastric fundus in the presence of prazosin (0.1 microM), and the responses to BRL 37344 were unaffected by propranolol (1 microM). 3. Tachyphylaxis to BRL 37344 was observed, a second concentration-response curve being significantly shifted to the right. Exposure of tissues to BRL 37344 (1 microM) between concentration-response curves also caused an 11 fold rightward shift in the response to isoprenaline. 4. In the presence of prazosin (0.1 microM) and propranolol (1 microM), the rank order of potency of the agonists was: (-)-isoprenaline (1.0) greater than (-)-noradrenaline (0.39) greater than BRL 37344 (0.10). 5. Responses to BRL 37344 in the presence of prazosin (0.1 microM) and propranolol (1 microM) were antagonized by (+/-)-cyanopindolol (1 microM), with a pKB of 6.56. Responses to isoprenaline, under the same conditions, were antagonized in a competitive manner by (+/-)-cyanopindolol (0.1-1 microM), with the slope of a Schild plot close to unity and a pA2 value of 7.44. 6. The resistance to blockade by prazosin and propranolol and the antagonism by cyanopindolol of the responses mediated by isoprenaline and BRL 37344 suggest that atypical beta-adrenoceptors similar to 'atypical',beta-adrenoceptors in rat adipocytes and other tissues are present in the rat gastric fundus.", 
    "62": "Bisoprolol is a new cardioselective beta1 adrenergic blocking agent without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity but with minimal effects on myocardial contractility. Bisoprolol was compared to propranolol in 24 patients after cardiac surgery for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). Each patient had been treated preoperatively with beta-blocking agents and had a cineangiographic left ventricular ejection fraction between 35% and 55%. Patients were randomized to receive orally either 10 mg of propranolol three times a day or 5 mg of bisoprolol once a day. Both drugs resulted in a significant and similar decrease in heart rate. This was associated with significant decreases in cardiac index, stroke index, and thermodilution right ventricular ejection fraction 6 hours after administration of propranolol, but not after bisoprolol. Systolic function measured by Doppler techniques significantly increased in the 10 postoperative days in patients under bisoprolol but not significantly after propranolol. Each drug was well tolerated during the 10 postoperative days, and the recovery was uneventful in each patient. These results indicate that in patients with altered systolic function after CABG, bisoprolol is susceptible to reduce heart rate with less cardiovascular alteration than propranolol.", 
    "63": "The pharmacologic treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) is aimed at controlling the ventricular response, restoring sinus rhythm, and preventing or delaying relapses. In the control of ventricular response, digitalis maintains a primary role when the arrhythmia is accompanied by heart failure. In ischemic, hypertensive, and degenerative (whose number is increasing at present) cardiopathies without evident ventricular dilatation, treatments with calcium antagonists (such as verapamil, gallopamil, or diltiazem) or beta-blocking agents must be preferred. In order to control the ventricular response in patients with chronic AF during physical activity, the association of digitalis with beta-blocking agents or calcium antagonists seems to provide satisfactory results. The drugs of the IC class, especially flecainide, represent a certain therapeutical progress in the restoration of sinus rhythm in the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation affecting subjects without evident alterations of ventricular function, particularly in subjects with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, with forms of vagal origin, or with atrial fibrillation alone. A therapeutic combination of digitalis and quinidine may produce resolution of the arrhythmia in the presence of altered ventricular function or when AF is of an uncertain onset. In patients with hypertensive, ischemic, and/or degenerative cardiopathy without evident ventricular or advanced heart failure, the verapamil-quinidine association may also be effective and even quicker. The combination of drugs of the I and III class for restoration of the sinus rhythm in particularly resistant forms of AF without evident structural heart alterations is promising but must be verified in a greater number of patients. In the prevention of relapses amiodarone appears to have the widest spectrum of advantages from an electrophysiologic point of view; however, because of its many side effects, amiodarone represents a late therapeutical choice. The promising results obtained with flecainide are disputed by the results of the CAST, which limit the possibilities of using this drug to a low number of cases (W.P.W. syndrome, AF of vagal origin, atrial fibrillation alone). In the past, quinidine and disopyramide have been the drugs most widely used in the prophylaxis of AF. These drugs have a similar efficacy, and both of them provided some positive results. However, because of untoward side effects (especially for quinidine) during chronic treatment, the use of these drugs has been questioned. Perhaps in the majority of patients, the less dangerous therapeutic choice after the termination of the fibrillation is a combination of drugs slowly down AV node activity (digitalis or calcium antagonists and beta blockers) with class IA antiarrhythmics.", 
    "64": "The regulation of vascular resistance, cardiac output, and thus blood pressure can be influenced by antihypertensive drugs acting at central and peripheral adrenergic receptors. The results presented here are from acute or chronic studies in 205 patients with mild or moderately severe essential hypertension: beta blockers (N = 101); alpha blockers (N = 36); a separate alpha- + beta-blocker combination or the combination agent labetalol (N = 37); prizidilol, a beta-blocker/vasodilator (N = 14); and dilevalol, a beta blocker/beta 2-stimulator (N = 17). Beta blockers without strong intrinsic sympathomimetic activity reduce heart rate and cardiac output immediately, but due to a reflex increase in total peripheral resistance index, blood pressure is unchanged or only slightly reduced. During chronic use, total peripheral resistance drops towards pretreatment level and pressure falls. Beta blockers with strong intrinsic sympathomimetic activity do not reduce heart rate or cardiac output at rest when sympathetic tone is low. During exercise, heart rate and cardiac output are reduced, but less than with conventional beta blockers, and resistance is unchanged or slightly reduced. An acute and chronic reduction in blood pressure can be produced by alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers (prazosin, doxazosin, trimazosin), and in these cases the fall occurs via a reduction in total peripheral resistance index without reflex tachycardia. These drugs tend to increase exercise stroke volume and cardiac output during chronic treatment. Free combinations of beta and alpha blockers or the use of the fixed combination drug, labetalol, induce marked reductions in blood pressure at rest and during exercise, mainly through a reduction in total peripheral resistance index. During chronic treatment, exercise stroke volume and cardiac output are well maintained. In acute studies with dilevalol, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure were reduced (p less than 0.001) within 1 hour in 17 males with essential hypertension (WHO stage I) who received 200-400 mg oral dilevalol. The reduction in MAP was around 16-17% and was associated with an immediate fall in the total peripheral resistance index of the same magnitude (14%, p less than 0.001) after 1 hour at rest. There were no significant changes in heart rate or cardiac index.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "65": "The use of beta-receptor antagonists in the treatment of heart failure is controversial. Available data do not allow general recommendations regarding their use. In dilated cardiomyopathy, several studies suggest that long-term treatment in individual patients reduces symptoms and increases exercise capacity. Short-term treatment is usually not beneficial, except in patients with ischemically induced left ventricular dysfunction. In heart failure, post myocardial infarction and in chronic ischemic heart disease, no proper long-term study has been performed to evaluate its effects. However, patients with acute myocardial infarction tolerate beta blockers, despite the presence of left ventricular dysfunction and long-term prognosis is improved. Newer agents, some with ancillary properties, such as intrinsic activity and vasodilatation, may have advantages. In the future we need a better description of the cardiac status in our patients in order to be able to select those that will respond favorably to beta-receptor antagonists. The mechanisms by which some patients improve are still obscure. Protection against receptor downregulation, restoration of receptor density, protection against cardiotoxicity of catecholamines, and improvement in ischemic systolic and diastolic left ventricular function are all possible. The fear that beta-receptor antagonists are dangerous in heart failure is in most instances not warranted, but an initial deterioration may have to be accepted in order to gain long-term beneficial effects. Ongoing studies in both idiopathic cardiomyopathy and in postinfarction failure will hopefully help us to define the use of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in the future.", 
    "66": "Beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents are established as one of the principal classes of antihypertensive agents. Despite progressive refinements over the years, they still possess some unwanted effects, which limit their considerable value. In recent years a wide range of variations upon the beta-blocker theme has been developed. The full clinical advantages of the newer agents remain to be defined.", 
    "67": "Despite the fact that beta blockers were introduced into clinical practice 25 years ago, new beta blockers with differing kinetic and dynamic profiles continue to be developed and marketed. This overview assesses some of the more extensively studied agents from the point of view of proof of utility and the validity of claims for therapeutic advances. The clinical data suggests that despite the expectations of improvements based on kinetic and dynamic consideration, none of the newer agents have been shown unequivocally, either in terms of efficiency or tolerability, to be an advance over the reference agents, the beta 1 antagonists atenolol and metoprolol. This may be either because such improvements will not occur or because of shortcomings in the design and duration of comparative studies. There are trends to suggest that celiprolol has lesser effects on bronchial function and that it has a lesser impact on lipoprotein profiles. Approaches are suggested that might enable clinicians to appraise for themselves the validity of claims for the improved efficiency of new beta blockers.", 
    "68": "Tremor is a rhythmic, involuntary muscular contraction with consistency of rate, amplitude and pattern. It is the most common of all involuntary movements. Several systems for classifying tremor exist with the most frequent system classed according to behavioral context, ie, resting, postural and action. Clinical recognition of tremor type is extremely important as type determines prognosis, treatment and need for genetic counseling. The most common forms are parkinsonian, physiological, cerebellar intention and essential tremor. Essential or hereditary tremor is the most common of all neurologic conditions with 3-4 million Americans affected. Nursing implications of caring for essential tremor patients are presented.", 
    "69": "Adaptation of the rabbit heart to volume load of the left ventricle is characterized by hypertrophic growth. This process involves an increase in the mass and changes in the composition of the myocardium. In the fifth week after perforation of the aortic valve an increase in phospholipid content and in mitochondria and a decrease in protein content was observed in the myocardium. These changes precondition a transient hyperfunction of the cardiomyocytes, but they presumably lead also to the eventual loss of contractile capacity. When the hypertrophic process occurs under conditions of nonspecific beta-adrenergic blockade, the required increase in left ventricular mass is achieved yet the content of phospholipids, proteins and mitochondria remains unchanged. Long-term blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors may be one of the modes of affecting the expression of cardiac genes in such a way that the hypertrophic myocardium does not develop conditions resulting in heart failure.", 
    "70": "The pharmacokinetics of the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, bopindolol, have been studied in 18 hypertensive patients with varying degrees of renal impairment following single and multiple oral dosing. Bopindolol, which undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, was found to accumulate in patients with chronic renal failure but the disposition in patients on regular haemodialysis did not differ significantly from patients with normal renal function. The mechanism underlying these changes in pharmacokinetics is not clear but suggests the presence of metabolic inhibitors in uraemic plasma which are removed by regular haemodialysis.",

In study I it was shown that bopindolol absorption from a 14 mg patch occurred over the whole 7-day application period. No signs of a significant skin depot were found. 3. In study II, a linear pharmacokinetic behaviour but a non-linear kinetic/dynamic relationship was established for the patches over a dose range from 7 to 21 mg. Comparable peak effects of reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia were observed after different patch doses and an i.v. injection. However, the effect was significantly prolonged with the patches compared with the injection and was maintained over 7 days. 4. The patches showed a good local and systemic tolerability in both studies over a dosing interval of up to 7 days.", 
    "72": "Using in vitro binding methods and autoradiographs, the authors showed that choroidal vessels specifically bind iodine 125 cyanopindolol, a nonselective blocker of beta-adrenergic receptors, in albino rabbits. In humans, the presence of beta-adrenergic receptors in choroidal vessels was confirmed by showing an increased choroidal vascular tone after systemic administration of timolol maleate, a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker. Topically administered timolol maleate lowered the intraocular pressure but did not reach the choroidal receptors in sufficient quantity to produce a measurable effect on vascular tone.", 
    "73": "Patients with diabetes mellitus have an increased prevalence of hypertension and its vascular consequences, including coronary and cerebrovascular disease. Drug treatment of hypertension in diabetic subjects is fraught with potential difficulties, including the altered efficacy of medications, the increased risk of side effects, and the possibility of worsening glycemic control and increasing serum lipid levels. Despite these difficulties, treatment is an important part of reducing morbidity and mortality from vascular events. Antihypertensive therapy may also have the potential to prevent or retard the development of diabetic nephropathy. In this article, we discuss the efficacy and metabolic and nonmetabolic side effects of the various classes of antihypertensive agents in patients with diabetes mellitus and suggest a stepped-care approach to the drug treatment of patients with hypertension and diabetes.", 
    "74": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that intracoronary administration of esmolol can confer metabolic protection during coronary constriction or occlusion, without affecting hemodynamic parameters, in a canine model. Seventeen anesthetized open-chest dogs underwent direct cannulation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LADa), its companion vein (LADv), and the distal circumflex vein (CFXv). LADa flow was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter. Using a micrometer-driven snare around the LADa, flow was reduced by 50%, 75%, and 100% for 15 minutes, with 1 hour of normal flow before each constriction. In 7 dogs (group 1) chosen randomly, esmolol, 15 to 20 micrograms/kg/min, was infused continuously into the LADa; the rate was adjusted to maintain baseline hemodynamic values. The second group (10 dogs) was not treated with esmolol. Heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram (ECG), LADa flow, LV dP/dt, and aorta (Ao), pulmonary artery (PA), LADa, and left ventricular (LV) pressures were recorded continuously. Cardiac output (CO) (thermodilution) was measured and blood was sampled from all catheters before and after constrictions for analysis of glucose, lactate, sodium, potassium, and blood gases. Flow and pressure in the LADa in both groups decreased similarly during each corresponding constriction. Systolic LV pressure, LV dP/dt, and LV stroke work index were affected in both groups only during 100% constriction. HR, Ao, and PA pressures, and total and peripheral pulmonary resistances were affected similarly in both groups during each constriction. Myocardial lactate extraction and consumption were less negative (negative = net production and output) in the LAD perfusion bed during corresponding constrictions with esmolol than without it.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "A method was developed and validated for the simultaneous analysis of (+)- and (-)-bevantolol in human plasma. The assay involves plasma protein precipitation, derivatization of racemic bevantolol to its diastereomeric thioureas with 2,3,4,5-tetra-o-acetyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate, and solid-phase extraction of the diastereomers from 0.5 ml human plasma. Chromatographic separation was accomplished under isocratic conditions using a reversed-phase C-18 analytical column and mobile phase consisting of equal parts of 75 mM dibasic ammonium phosphate buffer (adjusted to pH 3.5 with phosphoric acid) and acetonitrile, with a detection wavelength of 220 nm. The absolute peak-height method was employed for quantitation. Retention times for the diastereomers of (+)- and (-)-bevantolol were 7.4 and 6.4 min, respectively. The method is suitable for the quantification of the enantiomers over a concentration range of 40 to 800 ng/ml per enantiomer.", 
    "76": "Twelve healthy volunteers were given one week's oral treatment with each of 300 mg nizatidine, 40 mg famotidine, and placebo once daily in a randomised, placebo controlled, double blind study. Three hours after administration, nizatidine led to a significant reduction in the mean (SD) resting heart rate compared with placebo (63.6 (6.4) beats/minute on placebo to 55.9 (7.2) beats/minute on nizatidine (p less than 0.05)), whereas famotidine did not influence the heart rate significantly. Both drugs, however, increased significantly the pre-ejection period and the ratio of pre-ejection period to left ventricular ejection time on mechanocardiography and led to a significant decrease in cardiac output on impedance cardiography. The exercise heart rate on nizatidine as well as the resting heart rate on concurrent administration of nizatidine and the beta receptor blocking agent atenolol were subsequently investigated in the same volunteers. Nizatidine slightly inhibited exercise tachycardia by 4.4% (p less than 0.05). When compared with placebo, the mean resting heart rate was decreased on atenolol alone by a mean of 10.6 beats/minute (p less than 0.01) and fell further on co-administration with nizatidine to a total of 16.1 beats/minute (p less than 0.05 versus atenolol alone). In conclusion, the effect of nizatidine in reducing the heart rate needs careful evaluation in elderly patients with heart failure or those also taking beta blockers. In contrast to famotidine, long term treatment with 300 mg nizatidine a day has mainly negative chronotropic effects.", 
    "77": "Systemic beta-blockade after single doses of ophthalmic beta-blockers (one drop in each eye) was investigated in healthy volunteers in two randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled studies. beta-Blockade was evaluated by displacement of the bronchodilator (specific airway conductance), positive chronotropic (heart rate), and tremorogenic (finger tremor amplitude) dose-response curve for inhaled isoproterenol. In study 1, 0.5% betaxolol, 0.6% metipranolol, and 0.5% timolol were tested in 16 subjects. Compared with placebo, all beta-blockers resulted in a significant systemic beta-blockade (p greater than 0.05); the increasing order of potency was betaxolol, metipranolol, and timolol. In study 2, 2% butylamino-phenoxy-propanol-acetate (BPPA; a noncardioselective but topically oculoselective drug) and 1% timolol were investigated in 12 subjects. Placebo and BPPA showed no differences (p greater than 0.05), whereas timolol resulted in a significant beta-blockade (p less than 0.05). Topical oculoselectivity is an important aspect of drug safety of beta-blocking eyedrops. Measure of tremor is appropriate to evaluate beta 2-blockade.", 
    "78": "The pharmacokinetics and concentration-response relationships of intravenous esmolol were investigated in 20 children undergoing indicated cardiac electrophysiologic testing. A loading dose of 600 micrograms/kg was infused for 2 minutes. An infusion of esmolol was initiated and dosage was titrated until beta-blockade occurred. Serial esmolol blood samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis of the data revealed the following parameter estimates (mean +/- SD): volume of distribution at steady state, 2.0 +/- 1.4 L/kg; total body clearance, 321.2 +/- 238.8 ml/kg/min; and terminal elimination half-life, 4.5 +/- 2.1 minutes. There was a significant correlation between mean esmolol concentrations and mean percentage of reductions of mean arterial pressures and heart rates at each sample time (p less than 0.001). The doses of esmolol required for beta-blockade (mean +/- SD, 535 +/- 180 micrograms/kg/min) in children were considerably higher than those typically used in adults. Esmolol should prove useful in children in the acute management of cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension.",

    "83": "Reactive oxygen species, including superoxide anion, have attracted increasing attention for their possible role in promoting inflammation in a variety of pulmonary diseases including asthma. However, reactive oxygen species metabolism of phagocytic cells may be substantially modified by therapeutic agents used for asthma. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and alveolar macrophages from 15 normal subjects, and blood mononuclear cells from an additional 17 normal subjects, were studied to assess the effects of beta-receptor agonists and theophylline on phagocytic cell superoxide release. Isoproterenol produced a biphasic effect on spontaneous and phorbol ester stimulated alveolar macrophage and mononuclear cell superoxide production, augmenting release at 10(-5)M, and inhibiting release at 10(-4)M. These effects on spontaneous function in mononuclear cells were inhibited by 10(-5)M propranolol. Under conditions of phorbol ester-stimulation the enhancing effect of 10(-5)M isoproterenol on blood mononuclear cells was blocked by propranolol, but the inhibitory effect of 10(-4)M isoproterenol was not. Albuterol at equimolar concentrations with isoproterenol was not associated with altered spontaneous or stimulated superoxide release by alveolar macrophages or mononuclear cells. Further, spontaneous superoxide release by alveolar macrophages and mononuclear cells was significantly reduced by therapeutically achievable concentrations of theophylline (greater than 5 micrograms/ml). We conclude that the medication history must be controlled in studies of cell function in asthma, and that albuterol may be preferable to isoproterenol as a premedication for bronchoscopy when superoxide production of airspace cells is studied.", 
    "84": "We performed a prospective study that evaluated whether pretreatment with topical flurbiprofen alters the intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effects of either topical 1% apraclonidine hydrochloride or 0.5% timolol maleate. Eighteen normal volunteers participated in this six-armed, randomized, double-masked, crossover study. All subjects received the first study medication, either bilateral 0.3% flurbiprofen or placebo (its vehicle), every 30 minutes for four applications. They next received the second study medication: either 0.5% timolol maleate (Timoptic), 1% apraclonidine hydrochloride, or placebo in both eyes. We measured IOP before the instillation of the first study medication and the second study medication (baseline), and then at 1, 3, and 6 hours later. All subjects underwent all six treatment arms. Flurbiprofen alone had no effect on IOP. Maximum IOP lowering occurred between 3 and 6 hours after timolol and apraclonidine administration. There was no difference in IOP lowering between timolol- and apraclonidine-treated eyes. Pretreatment with flurbiprofen did not affect the IOP lowering that was obtained with timolol or apraclonidine administration.", 
    "85": "Twenty healthy subjects were tested for the aqueous-suppressing effects of the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist apraclonidine hydrochloride. Apraclonidine caused a 30% reduction of mean (+/- SD) aqueous flow during the daytime from 2.84 +/- 0.61 microL/min, similar to what has been observed for beta-adrenergic antagonists. Apraclonidine, like acetazolamide and unlike timolol maleate, was able to suppress the aqueous flow of sleeping subjects below the spontaneous nocturnal rate of 1.15 +/- 0.40 microL/min to 0.84 +/- 0.28 microL/min, a 27% change. When apraclonidine and timolol were given together in the daytime, no clinically significant or statistically significant additive effect was observed. The range of flows with either drug alone or the combination of the two measured from 2 to 4 PM was 1.41 to 1.78 microL/min. This result contrasts with studies of the effect of apraclonidine on patients who have received long-term beta-blockers where an additive effect is observed. The lack of an additive effect on flow in previously untreated normal subjects suggests that the two drugs act at least in part via a common pathway.", 
    "86": "The relationship between the extent of preoperative beta-adrenoceptor blockade and the hemodynamic properties of epinephrine was investigated in patients scheduled for elective myocardial revascularization during the immediate preoperative period under steady-state hemodynamic and anesthetic conditions. Twenty patients had been treated with beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs for at least 3 weeks before the study; 11 unblocked patients served as control group. The extent of clinical beta-adrenoceptor blockade was quantified using the isoproterenol sensitivity test. The dose of isoproterenol required to increase heart rate by 25 beats per min was defined as the chronotropic dose 25 (CD25), representing the degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Geometric mean CD25 per 70 kg was 3.0 micrograms in the control group and 21.8 micrograms in the patients receiving beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs. The authors found a significant inverse relationship between CD25 values and changes in cardiac index in response to three epinephrine infusion rates (0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), the correlation coefficients being -0.71, -0.81, and -0.86, respectively. Compared to unblocked patients, almost no change, or even a decrease, of the cardiac index was observed at greater degrees of clinical beta-adrenoceptor blockade, particularly in patients receiving nonselective blockers. Moreover, there was a significant linear correlation (r = 0.76-0.86) between CD25 values and the effects of epinephrine on systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI); i.e., SVRI significantly decreased in control patients but markedly increased in patients with high degrees of preoperative beta-adrenoceptor blockade.

    "88": "In the present study, we used these two blockers to determine the mechanisms responsible for automatic rhythms occurring during simulated ischemia and reperfusion of isolated canine Purkinje fibers. Experiments were done in the presence of propranolol to minimize beta-adrenergic contributions to the rhythms studied. In the control situation, all fibers showed membrane potentials greater than -90 mV and normal automatic rhythms. During simulated ischemia, membrane potential depolarized to the -60 mV range. Abnormal automaticity was seen in 20% of fibers not treated with phenylephrine and in 50% of those superfused with 1 x 10(-7) M phenylephrine. The incidence of abnormal automaticity was reduced to 0% by WB 4101 (which blocks phosphoinositide metabolic effects of alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in the heart) and was increased to 90% by chloroethylclonidine (which blocks Na-K pump-stimulating effects of alpha-agonists). Moreover, the ischemic fibers were significantly more hyperpolarized during superfusion with WB 4101 than with chloroethylclonidine. Triggered activity induced by delayed or early after depolarizations was not seen in any experiment.",

    "90": "The effects of carteolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, were compared with those of metoprolol in a murine model of viral myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy caused by encephalomyocarditis virus.", 
    "91": "In the acute experiment, BALB/c and DBA/2 mice were inoculated with encephalomyocarditis virus. BALB/c mice were then given carteolol at 1 (n = 10), 10 (n = 10), 30 (n = 11), or 100 mg/kg (n = 9) daily, and DBA/2 mice were given carteolol at 1 (n = 9) or 10 mg/kg (n = 9) daily starting the day of inoculation. Controls were given distilled water (n = 23 for BALB/c mice and n = 8 for DBA/2 mice). BALB/c mice were killed on day 7, and DBA/2 mice were killed on day 14. In the subacute experiment, DBA/2 mice were inoculated with the virus and then given carteolol at 1 (n = 12) or 10 mg/kg (n = 16), or distilled water (n = 27) daily, starting on day 14. Mice were killed on day 28. Virus replication, murine survival, heart weight to body weight ratio, and histopathological findings were similar in each group in the acute and subacute experiments. In the chronic experiment, DBA/2 mice were inoculated with the virus and were then given carteolol at 1 (n = 13) or 10 mg/kg (n = 9), metoprolol at 30 mg/kg (n = 9), or distilled water (n = 31) daily, starting on day 14. Mice were killed on day 104. Heart weight to body weight ratio and histopathological scores were significantly lower in mice given carteolol than in the infected control group. Furthermore, left ventricular cavity dimension, left ventricular wall thickness, and myocardial fiber diameter of the left ventricle were significantly reduced in mice given carteolol compared with the control group. Metoprolol did not cause any significant changes compared with the control group.",

    "93": "The distribution of beta-adrenergic receptors in sections of the human right and left coronary arteries and of the anterior intraventricular branch was studied by the use of combined in vitro radioreceptor binding and autoradiographic techniques. [125I]Cyanopindolol was used as a ligand for beta-adrenergic receptors. Binding of the radioligand to sections of the three coronary arteries under study was saturable, stereoselective, reversible, and displaceable by antagonists and agonists with the rank order of potency expected for beta-adrenergic receptors. Analysis of binding isotherms indicated maximum binding capacities of 41.5 fmol/mg protein for the right coronary artery, 35.4 fmol/mg protein for the left coronary artery, and 25.7 fmol/mg protein for the anterior interventricular branch. Dissociation constants were approximately 35 pM in the arteries examined. The relative amounts of beta 1- and beta 2-receptor subtypes were as follows: 72% beta 1-receptors and 28% beta 2-receptors in the right coronary artery; 65% beta 1-receptors and 35% beta 2-receptors in the left coronary artery; 40% beta 1-receptors and 60% beta 2-receptors in the anterior interventricular branch. The results of autoradiographic analysis revealed a predominance of beta 1-receptors in the medial layer. beta 2-Receptors were localized primarily in the adventitia, in the adventitia-media border, and in the intimal layer. These results should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the control of coronary circulation in humans.", 
    "94": "The effects of pharmacologic modulation of vagal activity on ischemic ventricular tachycardia were evaluated in 21 conscious dogs after permanent left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion. Studies were done on spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (cycle length 383 +/- 100 msec, n = 21), 24 to 72 hours after LAD occlusion, and on inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (cycle length 251 +/- 30 msec, n = 6), 4 to 7 days after LAD occlusion. Edrophonium (1 mg/kg intravenously), a cholinesterase inhibitor, and methacholine (0.1 to 1 mg intravenously), a muscarinic agonist, had no significant effect on the rate or QRS morphology of either type of tachycardia, despite severe slowing of the sinoatrial rate. Similarly, atropine (up to 60 micrograms/kg intravenously) had no effect on the rate and QRS morphology of either type of tachycardia. In an attempt to enhance myocardial drug delivery to the ischemic and infarcted left ventricle, edrophonium (1 mg/kg) and methacholine (0.1 to 0.2 mg) were injected retrogradely through the great cardiac vein. This did not impart any significant therapeutic advantage over the systemic intravenous route. Sympathetic beta blockade did not affect the therapeutic outcome (n = 5) with either edrophonium or methacholine. It is concluded that direct or indirect enhancement of cardiac vagal activity has no effect on ischemic ventricular tachycardia in this model of subacute myocardial infarction. The lack of efficacy appears to be independent of myocardial drug delivery to ischemic ventricular site(s) and background sympathetic activity. Such a lack of efficacy may be caused by ischemia-mediated degeneration of vagal nerve terminals, by altered responsiveness of muscarinic receptors at infarcted arrhythmogenic myocardial sites, or both.", 
    "95": "We analyzed the actuarial cardiac mortality rate of 295 consecutive patients with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia who were referred to us between 1978 and 1988. Patients were divided into four groups: group I of 156 patients with coronary disease, group II of 55 patients with nonischemic left ventricular disease, group III of 65 patients with right ventricular disease, and group IV of 19 patients without detectable heart disease. Patients were treated empirically according to a prospective schema: (1) class I antiarrhythmic drugs, (2) in case of recurrence of ventricular tachycardia: amiodarone or beta-blockers, (3) in case of recurrence of ventricular tachycardia: drug combinations or surgery. The mean follow-up duration was 61 +/- 40 months after the first occurrence of ventricular tachycardia, and the clinical outcome was known in 67.5% of patients at 5 years. The actuarial mortality rates were considerably higher in groups I and II compared with those in groups III and IV (p less than 0.01). The mortality rate was slightly higher in group I than in group II (p less than 0.05). In groups I and II, actuarial mortality rate were much higher when left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 0.30 (p less than 0.01). Comparisons between treatments showed no difference in actuarial mortality rates in patients with ventricular tachycardia and left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 0.30.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "96": "Sixty-four eyes undergoing Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy were randomly assigned to pretreatment with 5 mg/ml (0.5%) timolol maleate in 32 eyes, and no drugs was given in the other 32 eyes as comparison. The result showed that the mean rise in intraocular pressure was significantly less in the timolol-pretreated group than that in the comparison group within 4 hours after laser procedure and the intraocular pressure was the lowest 2 hours after capsulotomy. The mean rise in intraocular pressure in pretreated group was less than that in the comparison group 24 or 48 hours after capsulotomy, but the difference was not significant. It is suggested that pretreatment with 5 mg/ml (0.5%) timolol could blunted the immediate post-capsulotomy pressure rise though delayed pressure increases could not be prevented. Therefore, it is recommended that timolol should be administrated before the YAG laser capsulotomy in order to reduce side effects caused by higher immediate post-capsulotomy pressure rise.", 
    "97": "beta-Adrenergic control of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity is exerted only during a critical period in central nervous system development, playing an important role in neurotransmitter modulation of cell replication and differentiation. The current study examines the effects of lesions caused by 6-hydroxydopamine administration to neonatal rats, or of gestational exposure to propranolol, on the subsequent development of the ODC response to beta-adrenergic stimulation elicited by an acute intracisternal challenge with isoproterenol. 6-Hydroxydopamine treatment severely attenuated the ability of isoproterenol to stimulate ODC in the cerebellum, a tissue that shows a postnatal peak of ODC reactivity. In contrast, much smaller effects were seen in the cerebral cortex, which has an earlier (pre/perinatal) peak of ODC, despite the fact that norepinephrine depletion was more persistent in the cortex. On the other hand, blockade of fetal beta-receptors by maternal propranolol infusions resulted in immediate postnatal attenuation of the ODC response in cerebral cortex, but not cerebellum. These data suggest that early exposure of beta-receptors to norepinephrine \"programs\" the subsequent efficiency of the receptor linkage to ODC during a critical ontogenetic period that occurs prenatally in the cerebral cortex and postnatally in the cerebellum.", 
    "98": "The intravenous administration of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) to conscious catheterised rats dose-dependently increased the levels of glucose in plasma throughout the analysis (60 min); the levels of insulin in plasma remained unchanged, except for an early significant decrease in rats treated with the largest dose (1 g/kg). Pretreatment (10 min beforehand) with the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551 (3 mg/kg) or the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan (1 mg/kg) decreased the rise in levels of glucose in plasma elicited by 2-DG (250 mg/kg). Conversely, the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (1 mg/kg) or the dopaminergic receptor blocker, haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg) amplified the hyperglycaemic response to 2-DG. Previous administration of either the 5-HT1A/5-HT2 receptor antagonist, spiperone (3 mg/kg), the 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonist, methysergide (1 mg/kg), the 5-HT1C/5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ritanserin (1 mg/kg) or the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, ICS 205.930 (0.1 mg/kg) did not affect 2-DG-induced hyperglycaemia. On the other hand, the mixed 5-HT1A/5-HT1B/beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, (-)-propranolol (5 mg/kg) and the 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonist, methiotepin (1 mg/kg), respectively, diminished and amplified the hyperglycaemia elicited by 2-DG. Lastly, in rats pretreated with prazosin (1 mg/kg, 30 min beforehand), an additional pretreatment (10 min beforehand) with prazosin or methiotepin (both at 1 mg/kg) did not further amplify the hyperglycaemic response to 2-DG. These results indicate that 2-DG-induced hyperglycaemia is mediated by alpha 2- and beta 2-adrenoceptors and amplified by alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade. Conversely, neither 5-HT1, 5-HT2 nor 5-HT3 receptors played a role in the hyperglycaemic response to 2-DG.", 
    "99": "In a double-blind, parallel-group multicentre study in general practice, lisinopril (10-20 mg once daily) was compared with metoprolol (100-200 mg once daily) in 360 patients whose diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was in the range 91-115 mmHg despite diuretic treatment. Following a three week run-in period during which the diuretic was withdrawn, monotherapy with either lisinopril or metoprolol was given for two months with dose doubled after one month if DBP remained greater than 90 mmHg. Quality of life was assessed using established and validated questionnaires at the time of cessation of diuretic treatment and again after two months's active treatment. Both metoprolol and lisinopril achieved statistically significant BP reduction relative to baseline (P less than 0.001). Significantly fewer adverse events were experienced on lisinopril and metoprolol than on diuretic treatment. Frequency of withdrawals due to adverse events were statistically significantly lower on lisinopril than metoprolol P = 0.01. Before treatment approximately 35% of the patients had quality of life problems measured by General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), which was reduced to 17% on lisinopril and 23% on metoprolol. Thus both metoprolol and lisinopril were effective and safe in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension with lisinopril being better tolerated. From patients' self-assessments of quality of life, lisinopril was found to be superior to metoprolol in some aspects of emotional, cognitive and social functioning.", 
    "100": "Delta 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (20 mg/kg i.p.) and propranolol (20 and 50 mg/kg i.p.) produced marked falls in the rectal temperatures of mice kept at an ambient temperature of 22 degrees C. Propranolol (50 mg/kg i.p.) also decreased the thermogenic activity of brown fat, as measured by a decrease in the level of [3H]GDP binding to mitochondria obtained from mouse interscapular brown adipose tissue. In contrast, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (20 mg/kg i.p.) did not affect mitochondrial GDP binding even though the dose used was one shown previously to depress heat production. GDP binding was also unaffected by this cannabinoid in brown adipose tissue taken from mice that had been kept at 13 degrees C instead of 22 degrees C. In mice kept at 34 degrees C, isoprenaline (0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg s.c.) induced a marked rise in rectal temperature and increased the level of GDP binding to brown fat mitochondria. Propranolol (50 mg/kg i.p.) prevented the hyperthermic response to isoprenaline, the mice becoming hypothermic instead. Delta 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (20 mg/kg i.p.) had no effect on isoprenaline-induced hyperthermia. We conclude from these data that there is no significant involvement of brown adipose tissue in the hypothermic response of mice to delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol.", 
    "101": "Rat liver was perfused in situ via the portal vein without recirculation: 1) Electrical stimulation of the nerve bundles around hepatic artery and portal vein increased glucose and lactate output, reduced flow and caused an overflow of noradrenaline into the hepatic vein. The alpha-agonist phenylephrine also augmented glucose and lactate output and lowered flow with an ED50 of about 1 microM, while the beta-agonist isoproterenol increased glucose output but reduced lactate output with an ED50 of about 0.2 microM and left flow unaltered. 2) The alpha 1-receptor antagonist prazosin (KI at alpha 1-sites approximately 1 nM, at alpha 2-sites approximately 100 nM) inhibited the nerve stimulation-dependent increase in glucose and lactate output and reduction of flow with an ID50 of about 1 nM, while the alpha 2-receptor antagonist yohimbine (KI at alpha 2-sites approximately 10 nM, at alpha 1-sites approximately 1500 nM) was inhibitory only with an ID50 of about 400 nM. 10 nM prazosin clearly reduced the nerve actions, completely blocked the effects of 1 microM phenylephrine and left the effects of 0.2 microM isoproterenol unaltered. 10 nM yohimbine did not affect the nerve actions nor the effects of phenylephrine or isoproterenol. 3) The beta 1-receptor antagonist metoprolol (KI at beta 1-sites approximately 100 nM, at beta 2-sites approximately 1.2 microM) at 10 microM concentrations did not interfere with the nerve stimulation-dependent increase in glucose and lactate output or the decrease in flow. It did not have any specific alpha-antagonistic influence either on the changes brought about by 1 microM phenylephrine; however, it blocked the beta 2-mediated increase in glucose output by isoproterenol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "102": "The mechanisms influencing arterial blood pressure and heart rate were studied in conscious foxhounds after chronic sino-aortic and cardiopulmonary denervation (N = 6). In previous investigations it was shown, that this denervation produces hypertension and tachycardia, which is confirmed by the present study: Mean arterial blood pressure increased from 101 +/- 3 to 123 +/- 6 mmHg (P less than 0.05), and heart rate rose from 85 +/- 6 to 124 +/- 5 beats min-1 (P less than 0.001). The variability of mean arterial blood pressure, but not that of heart rate increased (from 6 +/- 1 to 22 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than 0.001). The administration of the alpha-adrenergic blocker prazosin reduced both mean arterial blood pressure (-33 +/- 8 mmHg, P less than 0.01) and its variability (-12 +/- 1 mmHg, P less than 0.01), thus suggesting an alpha-adrenergic mediated hypertension. beta-blockade by propranolol blunted the heart rate increase (-24 +/- 5 beats min-1, P less than 0.05). Although plasma renin activity increased in the denervated dogs, converting enzyme inhibition had little effect on mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate. In conclusion, chronic sino-aortic and cardiopulmonary denervation enhances the alpha and beta-adrenergic component of cardiovascular control in a different fashion. While the alpha-adrenergic component induces fluctuations around an elevated arterial blood pressure level, the beta-adrenergic tone to the heart increases without any significant increase in variability."
