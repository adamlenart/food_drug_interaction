    "0": "Forty-seven patients with spontaneous and inducible nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) underwent serial electrophysiologic studies to evaluate the effects of antiarrhythmic agents on inducible arrhythmias, the role of electrophysiologic testing in the evaluation of pharmacologic therapy for these arrhythmias, and potential mechanisms underlying these arrhythmias. Type I antiarrhythmic agents prevented induction of VT by programmed stimulation in 18 of 37 patients and by isoproterenol in 9 of 11 patients. Verapamil and propranolol did not prevent or alter the mode of induction of VT by programmed stimulation, nor did they slow the induced tachycardias. Propranolol prevented induction of VT by isoproterenol in all 14 patients tested. Type I antiarrhythmic agents converted nonsustained into sustained VT in 2 of 37 patients. Inducible VT was prevented in 88% of patients without underlying heart disease, in contrast to only 38% of patients with associated cardiac disease (p less than 0.02). This study demonstrates that electrophysiologic studies may be used to identify antiarrhythmic agents with both beneficial and potentially harmful effects in patients with nonsustained VT. The responses of inducible tachycardias to antiarrhythmic agents in this group of patients with spontaneous nonsustained VT are similar to those previously observed in patients with sustained VT. Finally, the results suggest that VT induced by isoproterenol may frequently respond to type I antiarrhythmic agents in addition to beta blockers.", 
    "1": "To assess the problem of continuing atenolol in a breast-feeding mother with hypertension associated with thyrotoxicosis, studies were performed to determine simultaneous plasma and breast milk concentrations of atenolol after a single dose of 50 mg and on continuous therapy of varying weekly dosages. Peak atenolol concentrations in breast milk were 3.6 times higher than simultaneous plasma atenolol concentrations after single-dose administration and 2.9 times higher after continuous-dose administration. A single plasma concentration obtained in the infant following a peak level feeding was less than 10 ng/ml. Although it would seem unlikely that the amount of atenolol excretion in breast milk should warrant interruption of breast-feeding because of maternal medication with ordinary doses, the infant should be evaluated for signs of beta-blockade.", 
    "2": "Diethylstilbestrol, psoralen, and propranolol were used as potential carrier molecules for selective concentrations of a nitrogen mustard moiety in breast, skin, and lung tissues, respectively. The propranolol derivative gave two racemic mixtures, which were tested to ascertain any differences in anticancer activity. The insertion of a P = O group between the carrier and oncolytic portions offsets the excess lipophilic contribution of the latter and possibly provides for latentiation of alkylating activity. Murine tumor testing of the phosphoramide mustard derivatives and two intermediates indicated that two compounds possessed marginal activity against mammary carcinoma and lymphocytic leukemia.", 
    "3": "The incidence of oral-verapamil-induced hypotension in the presence of concomitant beta-adrenergic blockade by the oral route is quite rare. The major contraindication to the use of intravenous verapamil is recent administration of intravenous beta-blocking agents (i.e., within the past two hours). We report a case of sustained hypotension after administration of parenteral verapamil. Vasopressors were required to support blood pressure for approximately five hours. The patient had been on oral propranolol for the past five years and had taken his last dose of propranolol approximately ten hours before the administration of parenteral verapamil for treatment of a supraventricular tachycardia documented by an electrocardiogram.", 
    "4": "The antihypertensive effect of carteolol (0.5 to 60 mg daily), a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with partial agonist activity, was studied in a double-blind parallel protocol. A 3-wk placebo period was followed by an 8-wk treatment period during which patients received 0.5, 2.5, 20, and 60 mg in an increasing (group 1) or decreasing (group 2) manner for successive 2-wk intervals, followed by a 2- to 6-wk withdrawal period. Resting supine and standing blood pressures (BP) and heart rates (HR) were measured at each visit. Isometric handgrip exercise and treadmill exercise were used to evaluate beta-blockade. Plasma carteolol concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay. Recumbent BP fell from 154 +/- 10/100 +/- 2 to 143 +/- 10/84 +/- 11 mm Hg for group 1 and from 153 +/- 10/100 +/- 3 to 138 +/- 14/78 +/- 8 mm Hg for group 2 after 8 wk of treatment. HR was unchanged. The greater reduction in BP for each dose was observed with the later administrations, but was not related to serum concentration. beta-Blockade was evident at all doses of carteolol. Carteolol is an effective antihypertensive. Duration of carteolol therapy, independent of dosage, is important in its effectiveness.", 
    "5": "beta-Adrenoceptor blockade by propranolol (4 X 10(-6)M) was without effect on the overflow of endogenous noradrenaline from the isolated heart of the rat induced by stimulation of sympathetic nerves for 1 min at 1 and at 4 Hz. The increase in heart rate in response to such stimulation was abolished by propranolol treatment. alpha 2-Adrenoceptor blockade by yohimbine (10(-6)M) induced approximately a two fold increase in the overflow of endogenous noradrenaline induced by stimulation of sympathetic nerves for 1 min at 1 and at 4 Hz. A combination of yohimbine (10(-6)M) and desipramine (10(-7)M) induced a more than 3 fold increase in the overflow of endogenous noradrenaline produced by sympathetic nerve stimulation at 1 and at 4 Hz. Heart rate increases produced by such stimulation were intensified. These results provide no evidence for the feedback stimulation of presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors in this preparation. The action of alpha-2-blockade was equipotent at stimulation frequencies of 1 and 4 Hz.", 
    "6": "The case presented concerns a patient taking propranolol who developed a severe anaphylactic reaction to pollen extract immunotherapy. Although the hypotension that occurred during the anaphylaxis was refractory to intravenous fluids, epinephrine, and dopamine, the antishock trouser suit was effective in elevating blood pressure.", 
    "7": "After dipyridamole, canine studies have demonstrated a slower rate of myocardial thallium-201 clearance from zones distal to a coronary artery stenosis compared to normal zones. To determine if criteria based on canine myocardial thallium-201 clearance rates could be applied clinically, 40 patients with and 26 patients without coronary artery disease (CAD) had serial thallium-201 images obtained for 2 to 5 hours after dipyridamole. Regions of interest were manually placed over six left ventricular segments in two projections for each of three imaging times. The myocardial thallium-201 clearance rate was calculated for each of the six segments and, using the clearance rate criterion found in canine studies, was considered abnormal if less than 6.5%/hr. Using this criterion alone, 22 of 26 patients (85%) without CAD had normal and 30 of 40 patients (75%) with CAD had abnormal myocardial thallium-201 clearance rates. A quantitative analysis of regional inhomogeneity in tracer distribution (normal was greater than or equal to 25% difference between segments) was negative in 24 of 26 patients (92%) without CAD and positive in 20 of 40 patients (50%) with CAD. When both clearance rate and regional inhomogeneity were considered, 21 of 26 patients (81%) without CAD had negative and 36 of 40 patients (90%) with CAD had positive results. Thus, post-dipyridamole myocardial clearance rate criteria derived from canine studies can be applied to clinical thallium imaging. Quantitative analysis of serial thallium-201 images after dipyridamole is optimized by using myocardial thallium-201 clearance rates. Such an approach is independent of regional inhomogeneities in tracer distribution.", 
    "8": "Eighteen patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia underwent electrophysiologic studies to establish the therapeutic efficacy of sotalol. In each patient ventricular tachycardia could be reproducibly initiated by programmed stimulation during control studies. Sotalol prevented induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia in 12 of the 18 patients (67%). Prolongation of the QTC interval and of ventricular refractoriness was regularly observed after sotalol but did not reliably predict prophylactic efficacy. Severe adverse effects, including congestive heart failure and sinus node dysfunction, were noted early during sotalol therapy in three patients. Nine patients were placed on long-term oral treatment with sotalol and four patients on another effective agent. In these 13 patients, complete (12 patients) or partial (one patient) long-term prophylaxis against ventricular tachycardia was documented over a mean follow-up period of 16 months (range 8 to 24). The study suggests that sotalol can provide effective prophylaxis against sustained ventricular tachycardia; this prophylactic efficacy is not typical for pure beta-adrenergic antagonism but may at least partly result from experimentally observed prolongation of the ventricular action potential duration.", 
    "9": "In the antithyroid drug therapy, an initial treatment with low doses (10-15 mg) of methimazole (MMI) leads to satisfactory improvement in nearly all cases and even 5 mg MMI are sufficient in more than 50% of all patients. Additional intake of thyroid hormones (Th) is not necessary, if the MMI-dosage is reduced accordingly to the individual course of treatment. Consequent follow -up is to recommend anyway, particularly under the higher MMI-doses and in the first time, respectively. Consecutive measurement of total T-3 helps in assessment of euthyroidism under treatment, whereas the response to MMI is indicated more correct by total T-4. Serial determinations of serum-TSH are very helpful to decide about the cessation of treatment. If any goitre growth occurs, it seems not to be TSH-mediated in every case. Skin reactions as side-effect of high MMI-doses can be prevented by use of low doses.", 
    "10": "Forskolin is a diterpene derivative of the plant Coleus forskohlii that stimulates adenylate cyclase activity without interacting with cell surface receptors. Forskolin lowers the intraocular pressure of rabbits, monkeys, and humans. In rabbits, net aqueous humor inflow decreases, outflow facility remains unchanged, and ciliary blood flow increases. Tolerance to the intraocular pressure lowering effect did not occur in rabbits after topical doses given every 6 hr for 15 days. In vitro forskolin activates adenylate cyclase of crude particulate homogenates prepared from cultured human ciliary epithelia or from dissected ciliary epithelial processes of rabbit or human eyes. This activation is not blocked by timolol. The stimulation of adenylate cyclase by isoproterenol in vitro is potentiated in the presence of forskolin. Forskolin represents a potentially useful class of antiglaucoma agents differing in molecular mechanism of action from previously used drugs.", 
    "11": "Different results are reported for the effects of an alpha and beta adrenergic blocker on the 24-hr sleep-wake patterns in dogs. While propranolol did not affect the 24-hr sleep-wake parameters, phentolamine significantly reduced delta sleep (stage 2), shortened the length of the sleep episodes, and decreased the number of REM episodes in each sleep-wake cycle. Phentolamine effects are explained by increased arousals within sleep episodes.", 
    "12": "Capillary permeability and cellular uptake of noradrenaline by the isolated artificially perfused rabbit heart was measured using rapid (less than 30 s) single-circulation tracer-dilution techniques. In a single coronary circulation capillary extractions of L-[14C]noradrenaline and D-[3H]mannitol (extracellular reference) relative to an intravascular marker, 125I-labelled albumin, were similar and above 60%. The 'apparent' volume of distribution for tracer noradrenaline was 2.5-fold larger than that measured for D-mannitol (0.32 ml g-1) suggesting cellular uptake of the amine. Unidirectional noradrenaline uptake was estimated by directly comparing coronary sinus dilution profiles of L-[3H]noradrenaline and D-[14C]mannitol. Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics based on a single-entry system were determined (Km = 2.8 +/- 1.5 microM, Vmax = 2.1 +/- 0.5 nmol min-1 g-1, n = 4) by perfusing hearts with varying concentrations of L-noradrenaline (1-10 microM). Various known inhibitors of noradrenaline uptake were investigated to determine whether uptake was mediated by neuronal (uptake1) and/or extraneuronal (uptake2) mechanisms. Desipramine (5 microM), imipramine (5 microM) and metaraminol (2 microM) resulted in a 66-94% inhibition of noradrenaline influx. In comparison, the steroids, 17 beta-oestradiol (1 microM) and corticosterone (10 microM), and the noradrenaline metabolite normetanephrine (5 microM) caused virtually no inhibitory effects. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (5 microM) was also relatively ineffective. These results together with the kinetic constants estimated suggest that the rapid noradrenaline uptake reflects transport into adrenergic neurones lying in the coronary interstitium. The high resolution of this paired-tracer dilution technique has permitted a 'non-invasive' study of neuronal uptake mechanisms and its application may be of clinical value.", 
    "13": "To evaluate the haemodynamic and hormonal effects of prazosin, head-up tilt was performed in 10 essential hypertensive patients, and these effects of prazosin on the tilt were compared with those of propranolol. The tilts were performed in control phase and the last days of treatment for two weeks with propranolol (90 mg/day) or prazosin (3-6 mg/day). Each drug significantly lowered the mean blood pressure at rest, and also suppressed its rise on the tilt. Heart rates were significantly increased by the tilt in the control phase, in the propranolol phase and in the prazosin phase. Cardiac index was significantly reduced by the tilt from 2.66 (s.e.m. = 0.22) 1/min per m2 to 2.08 (s.e.m. = 0.20) in the propranolol phase. However, there were not significant changes in other phases. Total peripheral resistance indices were significantly increased by the tilt in all three phases. Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone were significantly increased by the tilt from 2.14 (s.e.m. = 0.47) ng/ml per h to 2.46 (s.e.m. = 0.54) and from 50.6 (s.e.m. = 12.9) pg/ml to 74.9 (s.e.m. = 14.9) respectively, in the control phase. And they were also significantly increased from 1.06 (s.e.m. = 0.29) to 1.65 (s.e.m. = 0.45) and from 41.4 (s.e.m. = 16.3) to 54.0 (s.e.m. = 17.4) in the prazosin phase. There were no significant increases during the administration of propranolol. We observed that prazosin did not alter heart rate and cardiac index, but suppressed the renin-angiotensin system at rest. It is suggested that prazosin did not influence haemodynamic and hormonal responses to the tilt.", 
    "14": "In order to evaluate the influence of beta-adrenergic blockade on recovery from insulin-induced hypoglycemia, we compared the effect of saline or propranolol infusion during concomitant hypoglycemia in normal and type I diabetic persons. The diabetic subjects were initially rendered euglycemic with a basal insulin infusion. Glucose turnover was measured using [3-3H]glucose tracer. Propranolol caused a small but significant delay in glucose recovery in normal subjects, with plasma glucose only 80% of the values seen during saline infusion 1 h after hypoglycemia (P less than 0.005). This delay was caused by a 70% reduction in the rebound glucose output, which was responsible for posthypoglycemic recovery. In the diabetic subjects, glucose recovery was significantly delayed as compared with that in normal persons, even in the absence of propranolol, and associated with reduced secretion of epinephrine and glucagon. Moreover, the addition of propranolol caused a further 50% reduction in glucose recovery such that plasma glucose remained below 50 mg/dl for 3 h. In contrast to normals, propranolol did not inhibit the already blunted rebound in glucose output. However, propranolol prevented the decline in glucose utilization that occurred when saline alone was infused. During saline infusion, glucose uptake was at basal rates by 60 min whereas, during propranolol administration, glucose uptake remained above baseline until 180 min (P less than 0.01). Thus, propranolol may interfere with glucose recovery after insulin-induced hypoglycemia in diabetic patients by blocking epinephrine's inhibition of glucose utilization whereas, in normals, propranolol's effect is largely accounted for by blockade of epinephrine-induced hepatic glucose production.", 
    "15": "In results of studies published hitherto it has been found that Pindolol eye drops 1%, a nonselective beta-blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity have little or no effect on the bronchopulmonary system. Therefore, a long-term study of the pressure-lowering and other effects of this drug seems in open-angle glaucoma appeared desirable. In a multicenter double-blind trial 41 patients were treated with Pindolol eye drops 1% and 40 with Timolol eye drops 0,5%. A comparison of the two groups showed that their effect in IOP was almost identical. The other parameters of the examination revealed no significant differences between the two groups. - Five patients in the Pindolol group had to discontinue the study due to allergic reactions of the lids and/or conjunctiva .", 
    "16": "A prospective study of propranolol versus chlorthalidone has been performed in eleven patients with renal hypertension and one with essential hypertension. The patients were treated for 4 to 6 weeks consecutively. Both drugs proved to be effective in lowering elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The mean blood pressure decreased by 22.3 mm Hg in propranolol-treated patients and by 15 mm Hg in chlorthalidone-treated patients. One patient developed an asthmatic attack provoked by propranolol. Four of twelve patients receiving chlorthalidone developed hypokalemia and required potassium supply. Both drugs can be recommended as drugs of first choice in children with hypertension.", 
    "17": "A multicentre, double-blind, randomized study was carried out to compare the effect on survival, cardiac mortality and non-fatal cardiac events of oxprenolol slow release 160 mg b.i.d. compared with placebo in 1741 patients 35 to 69 years of age who had survived acute myocardial infarction. The patients were entered 14-36 days after infarction and were followed for one year. Recruitment was discontinued before the scheduled 4000 patients had been entered. There were 57 deaths (6.6%) in patients randomized with respect to oxprenolol as compared with 45 deaths (5.1%) in patients randomized with respect to placebo. The difference in cumulative mortality rates (30.4%) is not statistically significant. 275 patients from each treatment group discontinued trial medication. The proportion of deaths was noted to be higher in patients who discontinued trial medication (oxprenolol 13.1%; placebo 7.6%) and in patients 65-69 years (oxprenolol 16.7%; placebo 5.6%). In the 1472 patients less than 65 years of age there was a tendency to a lower mortality in 478 'high risk' patients on beta-blockade [oxprenolol 16 patients (6.9%); placebo 25 patients (10.2%)] as compared with a somewhat higher mortality in the corresponding low risk group (oxprenolol 20 patients [4.0%]; placebo 12 patients [2.4%]). In the 1010 patients under 65 years of age who continued on trial medication, 15 patients (3%) in the oxprenolol group and 22 patients (4.3%) in the placebo group died. The overall results in our trial failed to confirm apparently positive effects in other secondary prevention trials. Debate especially concerns patients older than 65 years of age, patients at relatively low risk, and patients who discontinued oxprenolol treatment.", 
    "18": "Timolol, a non-cardioselective beta-blocking agent, was administered orally after 2 weeks of placebo to 14 patients with essential hypertension for 8 weeks following 1-4 weeks of dose-ranging period. Patients were first hospitalized and submitted to a diagnostic workup. They were placed on a diet containing 100 mEq of Na+ and 65 mEq of K+; this regimen was also prescribed during outpatient treatment. The changes in blood pressure, systemic hemodynamics, plasma renin activity, urine aldosterone, and glomerular filtration rate were evaluated. A significant and stable decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure associated with a fall in cardiac output (-21%), heart rate (-17%), plasma renin activity, and urine aldosterone were observed. The blood pressure lowering effect was unrelated to the decrease in cardiac output and plasma renin activity. Glomerular filtration rate was unchanged. No important side effects were observed during the treatment.", 
    "19": "Islet-activating protein (IAP) is a substance purified from the culture medium of Bordetella pertussis, and its main action is characterized by the enhancement of secretory response to glucose and other stimuli in pancreatic islet. In this experiment, the effect of IAP on epinephrine-induced secretion of immunoreactive insulin (IRI) and glucagon (IRG) was investigated in normal dogs. Epinephrine suppressed IRI secretion and it had a little increment to IRG secretion in control group, while IRI and IRG secretions were significantly increased by epinephrine in IAP pretreated group. Using beta-blocker (Propranolol) with epinephrine, these increments of IRI and IRG secretions in IAP pretreated group were abolished. However, using alpha-blocker (Phentolamine) with epinephrine, these secretions of IRI and IRG in IAP pretreated group were much more increased than epinephrine alone induced secretions. Blood glucose levels were lower in IAP pretreated group than in control group throughout the loading tests in all of the experiments. These findings suggest that (1) IAP decreases blood glucose level and (2) IAP enhances epinephrine-induced secretion of insulin and glucagon by acceleration of beta-adrenergic effect and by reduction of alpha-adrenergic suppression in dogs.", 
    "20": "To examine whether diabetes affects the ability of beta-blockade to suppress adrenaline-stimulated hepatic glucose production, we infused adrenaline with and without propranolol into normal subjects and diabetic patients receiving a constant insulin infusion in basal amounts. In normal subjects, propranolol did not block the transient 50%-60% rise in glucose production during adrenaline infusion. In contrast, propranolol virtually abolished adrenaline-induced hyperglycaemia and glucose production was virtually abolished by propranolol in the diabetic patients, even though they demonstrated an exaggerated response to adrenaline alone (persistent increase in glucose production of 50%-90% above baseline). When insulin was infused together with adrenaline and propranolol in normal subjects in doses exceeding those given to the diabetics (plasma insulin rose threefold), the rise in glucose production was still threefold greater than in the diabetic patients (p less than 0.02). We conclude that beta-blockade is more effective in suppressing the hepatic response to adrenaline in diabetics than in normal subjects. Our data may explain why diabetic subjects are more vulnerable to hypoglycaemia during treatment with propranolol.", 
    "21": "Labetalol was the first of a new class of antihypertensive drugs with both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties present in the same molecule. Its efficacy has been confirmed by double-blind studies in the treatment of all grades of hypertension and in angina pectoris. The drug's major dose-related side effect is postural hypotension. The clinical formulation of labetalol consists of equal proportions of 4 optical isomers. One of these (the RR isomer) is probably responsible for the drug's beta-adrenoceptor blockade and another (the SR isomer) produces most of the alpha-blockade. Most of the presently available pharmacokinetic information concerning labetalol is from studies utilising a fluorimetric assay but this has recently been superseded by more specific high-pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedures. Labetalol is absorbed rapidly after oral administration with peak plasma concentrations generally being achieved within 2 hours. The bioavailability varies from 10% to over 80% in different subjects. Average bioavailability has been reported to correlate with age, with values of approximately 30% in the 30- to 40-year age group and approximately 65% at 80 years. There is also evidence that the bioavailability increases moderately when the drug is taken with food. About 50% of the drug is bound in the plasma. The apparent volume of distribution at equilibrium varies from approximately 200 to over 800L, suggesting that concentration of labetalol occurs in extravascular sites. Radiochemical analysis in animals has shown high levels of accumulation in the lung, liver and kidney with little present in brain tissue. This is in keeping with the relatively low lipid solubility of labetalol. The half-life of labetalol in plasma is 3 to 3.5 hours. The drug is eliminated mainly by hepatic metabolism with the production of several biologically inactive glucuronides which in turn are excreted in the urine and bile. Approximately 85% of labetalol in the blood is removed during a single passage through the liver; thus, like propranolol, labetalol's clearance is probably flow dependent (i.e. it is sensitive to alterations in hepatic blood flow). Small doses of the drug (i.e. 300mg daily) have been shown to reduce antipyrine clearance by approximately 15%, and further studies are necessary to determine whether high doses produce a greater, possibly clinically significant, inhibition of mixed-function oxidase activity. After both single doses and during long term treatment the plasma concentration-time profile of labetalol shows marked variation between different individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "22": "We have studied the effects of single oral doses of, and of 28 days treatment with, placebo, propranolol or metoprolol, on the metabolic and hormonal responses to prolonged exercise in hypertensive men. Blood glucose levels fell during exercise on all occasions. No additional effects of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, compared to placebo, were observed. The exercise-induced increase in plasma potassium was enhanced after a single dose of propranolol or metoprolol, and also after chronic treatment with propranolol. Chronic treatment with either drug led to an increase in plasma potassium levels at rest. The growth hormone response to exercise was potentiated by a single dose of metoprolol or propranolol, and after chronic treatment with the drugs. A single dose of propranolol (but not metoprolol) was associated with a marked increase in plasma cortisol and adrenaline levels during exercise. After chronic treatment no such increase occurred. In both the acute and chronic phases of the study, blood lactate levels were higher during exercise in the presence of either propranolol or metoprolol compared to placebo, whereas non-esterified fatty acid levels were lower. A single dose of metoprolol produced a significantly greater reduction in blood glycerol levels during exercise than a single dose of propranolol. After chronic treatment, both propranolol and metoprolol produced similar reductions in blood glycerol levels during exercise. After a single dose, both drugs significantly augmented the increase in plasma noradrenaline levels during exercise. A similar effect was seen after chronic treatment.", 
    "23": "After intravenous glucose/insulin infusion there is an increase in oxygen consumption and energy expenditure that has been referred to as thermogenesis. To examine the contribution of the beta and alpha adrenergic nervous system to this thermogenic response, 12 healthy volunteers participated in three studies: (a) euglycemic insulin (plasma insulin approximately 100 microunits/ml) clamp study (n = 12); (b) insulin clamp study after beta adrenergic blockade with intravenous propranolol for 1 h (n = 12); (c) insulin clamp study after alpha adrenergic blockade with phentolamine for 1 h (n = 5). During the control insulin clamp study total glucose uptake, glucose oxidation and nonoxidative glucose uptake averaged 7.85 +/- 0.47, 2.62 +/- 0.22, and 5.23 +/- 0.51 mg/kg X min. After propranolol infusion, insulin-mediated glucose uptake was significantly reduced, 6.89 +/- 0.41 (P less than 0.02). This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in glucose oxidation (1.97 +/- 0.19 mg/kg X min, P less than 0.01) without any change in nonoxidative glucose metabolism. Phentolamine administration had no effect on total glucose uptake, glucose oxidation, or nonoxidative glucose disposal. The increments in energy expenditure (0.10 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.03 +/- 0.01 kcal/min) and glucose/insulin-induced thermogenesis (4.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.5%) were reduced by 70% during the propranolol/insulin clamp study. The increments in energy expenditure (0.12 +/- 0.03 kcal/min) and thermogenesis (5.0 +/- 1.5%) were not affected by phentolamine. These results indicate that activation of the beta adrenergic receptor plays an important role in the insulin/glucose-mediated increase in energy expenditure and thermogenesis. In contrast, the alpha adrenergic receptor does not appear to participate in this response.", 
    "24": "Headache has been documented as the reason for approximately 18 million office visits per year in the United States, and may be the most prevalent central nervous system condition for which patients consult doctors. The author presents an overview of the literature on classification, causes, and treatment of headache, including uncertainties about diagnostic criteria for migraine and about differentiation of migraine from muscle contraction headache. He discusses treatment of headache in relation to management of the acute attack, avoidance of trigger factors, and pharmacological and nonpharmacological prophylaxis.", 
    "25": "The response to diazepam and propranolol hydrochloride was compared in 21 patients who (with one exception) met DSM-III criteria for panic disorder and agoraphobia. Each drug was administered for two weeks in double-blind fashion according to a crossover design. The response to diazepam was significantly superior on all measures. By observer rating, 18 patients showed at least moderate improvement with diazepam compared with seven receiving propranolol. Panic attacks and phobic symptoms responded to diazepam, but not to propranolol. The results suggest that benzodiazepines constitute effective short-term treatment for these newly defined disorders.", 
    "26": "A new calcium ion antagonist, gallopamil, 150 mg/day, was compared with propranolol, 240 mg/day, in 20 patients with stable chronic angina. The patients were studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial. Multistage treadmill exercise with computer-assisted electrocardiographic analysis was performed after 2 weeks of placebo therapy and at the end of each 4-week active treatment period. The mean (+/- standard error of the mean) exercise time to development of angina was 5.4 +/- 0.3 minutes with placebo; this increased to 9.4 +/- 0.7 minutes with propranolol (p less than 0.001) and 10.1 +/- 0.7 minutes with gallopamil (p less than 0.001 vs placebo; difference not significant vs propranolol). Both drugs significantly prolonged the time to development of 1 mm of ST depression. Five patients became free of angina during treadmill testing with gallopamil therapy and 2 with propranolol. Both drugs decreased the heart rate at rest; propranolol also decreased the maximal exercise heart rate, which was slightly increased with gallopamil. With the exception of 1 patient in whom raised liver enzymes developed, gallopamil was well tolerated. Thus, gallopamil is an effective antianginal agent that has few of the unwanted effects associated with other calcium channel-blocking drugs.", 
    "27": "We studied the effect of long-term administration of propranolol hydrochloride and isoniazid and the acute action of ethyl alcohol on cerebellar tremor in patients with multiple sclerosis and primary cerebellar degeneration in a placebo-controlled double-blind crossover test. None of the drugs decreased the severity of either static or kinetic cerebellar tremors.", 
    "28": "Both propranolol and the electron donors ascorbate plus phenazine methosulfate increase the K+-permeability of the red blood cell membrane. The present investigation examined whether these effects were additive. Contrary to expectations, propranolol added after electron donors sharply inhibited the K+ (86Rb) efflux induced by such donors, without forming new K4 channels analogous to those induced by propranolol in intact red blood cells. The inhibitory effect of propranolol may be due to generalized disturbances of membrane structures necessary for the functioning of the K+ channels organized in the presence of reducing agents. In contrast, the electron donors added after propranolol caused a further stimulation of the 86Rb loss from the propranolol-treated red cells. The combined effect of these drugs therefore depends on the order of their addition. The possible mechanism of their interaction is briefly discussed.", 
    "29": "The effect of dopamine on 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) generation in the rabbit superior mesenteric artery was studied in order to identify dopamine receptors. Dopamine added to homogenates of superior mesenteric artery increased the concentration of cAMP. The stimulation of cAMP levels elicited by dopamine was unaffected by alpha or beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents but was remarkably reduced by the dopamine receptor blocking agents fluphenazine and haloperidol. The findings appear to indicate that the effects of dopamine on rabbit superior mesenteric artery are mediated through activation of the adenylate-cyclase cAMP system.", 
    "30": "In order to determine the distribution of alpha-adrenergic receptors within a nephron, a method was used to determine the specific binding of [3H]-prazosin to isolated fragments of rabbit renal tubules. When 10(-8) moles/liter [3H]-prazosin was incubated with proximal convoluted tubules, 61.4% of total binding was accounted for specific binding. The [3H]-prazosin binding to the proximal convoluted tubule was a linear function of the tubular length and reversible. It was inhibited with 10(-4) moles/liter phenoxybenzamine by about 60%, and with 10(-4) moles/liter norepinephrine by about 25%, but not with either atenolol or isoproterenol. No specific binding of [3H]-prazosin was observed in the proximal straight tubule and in the cortical collecting tubule. These data are in good agreement with the view that alpha-1 adrenergic receptors are mainly distributed in the proximal convoluted tubules.", 
    "31": "The mechanism of the positive inotropic effect of a benzimidazole-pyridazinone, UD-CG 115, was analysed in the isolated guinea-pig papillary muscle contracting isometrically at a frequency of 0.2 Hz. UD-CG 115 produced a slowly developing and poorly reversible positive inotropic effect increasing with concentration (3-300 mumol/l). The effect amounted to 30 and 74% of the maximum inotropic effect of a standard, dihydroouabain, at 34 and 300 mumol/l, respectively. Low concentrations shortened and 300 mumol/l UD-CG 115 significantly prolonged the duration of contraction. The enhancement of the maximum rate of relaxation, S2, was intermediate between those produced by isoprenaline and dihydroouabain, respectively. UD-CG 115 prolonged the duration of the transmembrane action potential (90% repol .) by up to 22% at 300 mumol/l, whereas an equieffective concentration of isoprenaline did not consistently alter action potential duration. UD-CG 115 increased Vmax and overshoot, and prolonged the duration, of slow action potentials elicited at 24 mmol/l [K]0. The inotropic potency of UD-CG 115 was not significantly changed by reserpine pretreatment of the guinea pig or by the presence of 1 mumol/l(-)-propranolol, 3 mumol/l phentolamine or 10 mumol/l cimetidine. Neither was it reduced by 10 mumol/l TTX. The inotropic effect of 100 mumol/l UD-CG 115 remained unchanged when [K]0 was elevated from 3.2 to 12.0 mmol/l. A sarcolemmal preparation of guinea- pig ventricular Na,K-ATPase was only slightly inhibited by the highest concentration of UD-CG 115.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "The number of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors and the activity of isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase are lower in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and may account for diminished inotropic responsiveness to beta-agonists. Differences in isoproterenol-induced desensitization of the cardiac adenylate cyclase system between 14- to 16-week-old SHRs and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls were studied using cardiac membranes, isolated cardiac myocytes, and intact animals. In both animal strains, the isoproterenol-induced \"loss\" of beta-adrenergic receptors in the cardiac membranes required adenosine triphosphate (ATP), magnesium (Mg2+), and guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP). The ATP and Mg2+ requirement may reflect a crucial role for a phosphorylation step, since desensitization was prevented by cordycepin, a nonspecific phosphorylation inhibitor. In both isolated myocytes and intact animals, isoproterenol induced a redistribution of the beta-adrenergic receptors (but not of adenylate cyclase) from the cell membrane to the cytosol. Internalization of the receptors was not secondary to the loss of membrane fragments to the cytosol, since the receptors sequestered in a fraction devoid of cell surface markers. In all three preparations, the extent of isoproterenol-induced \"loss\" of beta-receptors and isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase was considerably lower in SHRs than WKYs. This difference appeared to be due to a reduced capacity of isoproterenol to induce translocation of beta-receptors from the membranes to the cytosol of SHRs, because of a change in the physical properties of either the beta-receptors themselves or the membranes into which they were embedded.", 
    "33": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were treated with propranolol (P) (70 mg/kg) daily for 2 or 4 weeks and then the effects of vasoactive substances on blood pressure were studied 10 or 36 hours after the last dose of P. At 10 hours after the last dose of P, vascular hyperresponsiveness to norepinephrine (NE) and angiotensin II (AII) had largely disappeared, but the hypotensive action of isoproterenol and prostacyclin was still blocked in P-treated SHR. An increase of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in response to isoproterenol was blocked in the thoracic aorta. Similarly, an increase of circulating cAMP and blood glucose in response to epinephrine (E) was depressed. At 36 hours after the last dose of P, an elevation of blood pressure in response to NE and AII was significantly reduced in P-treated SHR. Although basal blood pressure with or without anesthesia was the same in P-treated SHR and control SHR, a decrease of blood pressure in response to isoproterenol and prostacyclin was augmented significantly in P-treated SHR. This was also true in normal rats similarly treated. In addition, an increase of cAMP in the thoracic aorta in response to isoproterenol and prostacyclin was augmented significantly in P-treated SHR. An increase in blood glucose in response to E was not blocked, but an increase of circulating cAMP in response to E was blocked. These data suggest that cAMP synthesis in the vessels is somehow related to the production of peculiar vascular responses during escape from P action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "Cardiopulmonary homeostasis for the high risk surgical patient is dependent on invasive monitoring techniques which are designed to allow for the early detection of physiological dysfunction during the development stages. One must maintain both minimum and maximum predetermined cardiorespiratory values by the early utilization of specific therapeutic intervention in order to counter the physiological deviation from the previously determined acceptable values.", 
    "35": "We investigated the characteristics of adrenergic receptor binding in peripheral blood cells from 6 patients with cystic fibrosis(CF) and 20 age-matched control subjects. There was a tendency (p = 0.08) towards a difference in dissociation constant of specific (125I)-hydroxybenzylpindolol (IHYP) binding in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (beta 2-adrenoceptor) from CF patients (113.0 pM +/- 32.8, SD) and controls (84.3 pM +/- 30.4, SD). We found no consistent differences in maximum binding capacity (Bmax) for either (3H)-yohimbine(YOH) binding in platelets (alpha 2-adrenoceptor) or IHYP bindings between the two groups. The ratio of YOH versus IHYP binding sites was significantly greater in CF patients (1.51 +/- 0.48) than in controls (1.07 +/- 0.34) (P less than 0.05). This might provide a possible explanation for the increased vasoconstriction and decreased heart rate response to adrenergic agonists in CF patients.", 
    "36": "Pressor responses to bolus injections of noradrenaline (NA) were analysed, in the isolated perfused spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rat mesenteric arterial bed, in an attempt to investigate the beta-adrenoreceptor-mediated modulation of catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction. NA-induced responses were potentiated in the presence of timolol (10(-7) M) and suppressed by (-)isoprenaline (10(-4) M), indicating the presence of a vasodilator beta-adrenoreceptor population. The suppressant effect of (-)isoprenaline (10(-4) M) was antagonised by timolol (10(-7) M). Lower doses of (-)isoprenaline (10(-7) M - 10(-5) M) potentiated the NA-induced pressor responses, while (+)isoprenaline (10(-5) M - 10(-4) M) suppressed the NA-induced responses. It is concluded that although a vasodilator beta-adrenoreceptor population exists in the SHR mesenteric vasculature, its vasodilator function is compromised when compared to that found in normotensive rats.", 
    "37": "Effects of isoprenaline, adrenaline and noradrenaline on contractility were studied in longitudinal strips of mouse and rat uteri in vitro. In mouse uteri, isoprenaline produced an inhibitory effect on spontaneous contractions which was antagonized by propranolol, a nonselective beta-blocker, but not by practolol, a selective beta 1-blocker. Thus, the inhibitory effect of isoprenaline is mediated by beta 2-adrenoreceptor activation. Adrenaline and noradrenaline also inhibited the spontaneous contractions of mouse uteri. In rat uteri, isoprenaline produced only an inhibitory effect whereas adrenaline initially inhibited the force and frequency of contraction but also had a secondary excitatory effect on the frequency which could be antagonized by phentolamine. Noradrenaline had an inhibitory effect on force but had only a negligible effect on frequency of rat uteri. Phenylephrine also reduced the spontaneous contractility of mouse uteri by a beta 2-mediated effect. From results generated in this study, and from the literature, it is concluded that beta 2-adrenoreceptors are predominant in nonpregnant uteri of rodents, especially the mouse, while alpha-adrenoreceptors are predominant in nonpregnant uteri of rabbit, monkey and human.", 
    "38": "We have used quantitative autoradiography to localize in rat brain beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors. These receptors were labeled in vitro with 125I-labeled pindolol, an antagonist of beta-adrenergic receptors that binds nonselectively to both beta 1 and beta 2 subtypes. The selective inhibition of 125I-labeled pindolol binding with specific antagonists of beta 1 and beta 2 receptors allowed the visualization of beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes. High levels of beta 1 receptors were observed in the cingulate cortex, layers I and II of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, the Islands of Calleja, and the gelatinosus, mediodorsal, and ventral nuclei of the thalamus. High levels of beta 2 receptors were found in the molecular layer of the cerebellum, over pia mater, and in the central, paraventricular, and caudal lateral posterior thalamic nuclei. Approximately equal levels of beta 1 and beta 2 receptors occurred in the substantia nigra, the olfactory tubercle, layer IV of the cerebral cortex, the medial preoptic nucleus, and all nuclei of the medulla. The pronounced differences in the ratio of beta 1 to beta 2 receptors among brain regions suggests that the subtypes of beta-adrenergic receptors may play different roles in neuronal function.", 
    "39": "Rat pulmonary artery contains both alpha adrenoceptors mediating contraction and beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors mediating relaxation. Neither alpha nor beta adrenoceptor-mediated responses of this vessel to norepinephrine or epinephrine were potentiated by cocaine, despite evidence for the presence of some adrenergic nerves. Beta adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation of pulmonary artery, but not aorta, modulated alpha adrenoceptor-mediated contractions to epinephrine but not norepinephrine. Rat aorta also contains both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors mediating relaxation, in that Schild plots for atenolol (beta-1 selective antagonist) using a beta-1 selective agonist (norepinephrine) and a beta-2 selective agonist (fenoterol), respectively, were not superimposed. The Schild plot data for lCl 118,551 (beta-2 selective) indicated that the minor population (beta-1) was less important in aorta than in pulmonary artery. On preparations from 18-month-old rats, the maximum relaxation to isoproterenol (20.4%, aorta and 67.9%, pulmonary artery) was less than in preparations from young rats (79.8%, aorta and 96.9%, pulmonary artery), i.e., aging had reduced the beta adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation in both vessels, but particularly in aorta. Also, the negative log EC50 of fenoterol, but not of isoproterenol or norepinephrine, was less than in preparations from young rats. This could indicate that aging had affected beta-2 more than beta-1 adrenoceptor-mediated responses and may explain why aging depressed the maximum relaxation of aorta more than that of pulmonary artery.", 
    "40": "The effects of acute and chronic administrations of two antidepressant drugs with differing pharmacological profiles on pineal beta adrenergic receptor-mediated functions were examined in the rat. Animals were treated with control powdered food or with either imipramine or iprindole-containing diets (0.067%, w/w) for various time intervals. Animals were sacrificed during different phases of the light/dark cycle and pineal [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding, N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity, N-acetylserotonin (NAS) and melatonin levels were measured. Plasma drugs and metabolite concentrations were also assessed. A 3-day treatment with imipramine resulted in an unchanged pineal [3H] DHA binding and an increase in pineal serotonin (5-HT), NAS and melatonin. A comparable treatment with iprindole did not alter any pineal measures. Three weeks of imipramine treatment resulted in therapeutic plasma drug and metabolite concentrations and elicited a reduction (31%) in the density of pineal [3H] DHA binding. This treatment, in addition, suppressed the dark-induced activation of the intracellular enzyme NAT (38%) and the concentrations of NAS (25%) and melatonin (23%) without altering pineal 5-HT rhythm. No apparent shift was observed in the NAT, NAS and melatonin rhythms. Chronic treatment with the atypical antidepressant iprindole for 3 weeks resulted in-plasma iprindole concentrations of 76 ng/ml and a significant reduction (24%) in pineal 5-HT levels 5 hr into the dark phase of the light/dark cycle. Pineal NAT activity and NAS and melatonin content were not significantly reduced by this treatment. However, 4 weeks of iprindole ingestion produced plasma drug concentrations of 141 ng/ml and significantly reduced pineal [3H] DHA binding density (18%) without changing binding affinity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "It has been suggested that beta-adrenergic responsiveness is reduced in hypertension. To evaluate a possible alteration in human beta-receptors that might account for diminished beta-adrenergic responsiveness, we studied leukocytes from hypertensive and normotensive subjects after an overnight rest supine, and then after being ambulatory, a maneuver that increases plasma catecholamines approximately twofold. In supine samples, beta-receptor affinity for the agonist isoproterenol was significantly reduced in hypertensives and was associated with a reduction in the proportion of beta-receptors binding agonist with a high affinity from 42 +/- 6% in normotensive subjects to 25 +/- 2% in hypertensives (P less than 0.05). Alterations in beta-adrenergic-mediated adenylate cyclase activity parallelled the differences seen in the beta-receptor affinity for agonist. In normotensive subjects, beta-receptor density and the proportion of receptors binding agonist with high affinity were reciprocally correlated with plasma catecholamines. However, in the hypertensive subjects these correlations were not evident. Thus, our data suggest an alteration in leukocyte beta-receptor interactions in hypertensive subjects, and may represent a generalized defect in beta-receptor function in hypertension.", 
    "42": "In stress-resistant animals exposed to 5-minute immobilization, the metabolic reaction of leukocytes was marked by an increase in the activity of G-6-PDH, hexokinase (HK), cytochrome oxidase (CCO) accompanied by a decrease in the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). In stress-labile animals, there was a decrease in the activity of G-6-PDH, HK, CCO with an increase in the activity of SDH. The orientation of enzymatic processes in leukocytes of stress-labile animals after immobilization and of stress-resistant animals following intravenous injection of propranolol was discovered to be similar. After propranolol injection leukocytes did not show any glucose, while the activity of G-6-PDH, HK and CCO descended. Injection of propranolol decreased the animal's resistance to traumatic shock. In stress-resistant animals exposed to trauma after the blockade of beta-adrenoreactive structures, the metabolic reaction was marked by low mobility restitution of energy processes as was the case in stress-labile animals during the development of a severe shock.", 
    "43": "Single equine sweat glands were found to secrete for more than 1 h in vitro in response to pharmacologic secretagogues. The adrenergic agonists epinephrine and norepinephrine evoked maximal sweat rates of 2.0 nl X gland-1 X min-1. However, the concentration of norepinephrine (10(-5) M) required to evoke the maximal response was 10 times higher than that for epinephrine. Maximal sweat rates also were stimulated with the beta 2-adrenergic agonist terbutaline. This stimulation was blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Moderate sweating responses were also obtained with the alpha-adrenergic agonists phenylephrine and methoxamine, but these responses also were blocked by propranolol. Neither the muscarinic blocker atropine nor the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine inhibited any of the pharmacologically induced sweat responses. Unlike most other mammalian exocrine glands, cholinergic agonists were ineffective in stimulating sweat secretion. Therefore equine sweat glands apparently are under predominantly beta-adrenergic control.", 
    "44": "The efficacy of MK 421 and propranolol was compared in 48 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Each patient was randomly assigned to receive 1 of the drugs for 12 weeks. Additionally, a subgroup of 28 patients underwent studies of forearm arterial and venous circulation by means of pulsed Doppler and mercury-in-silastic plethysmography. Both drugs reduced supine and standing blood pressure (BP) (p less than 0.001). Propranolol reduced heart rate (p less than 0.001), while MK 421 did not change it. Brachial artery diameter, blood velocity and flow increased after MK 421 (p less than 0.001), but were not changed after propranolol therapy. Forearm vascular resistance decreased after MK 421 (p less than 0.001) and after propranolol (p less than 0.05). Forearm venous tone was unaffected on MK 421, but increased after propranolol (p less than 0.01). Thus, in moderate hypertension, 3 months of treatment with MK 421 or propranolol similarly decrease BP, but affect the forearm circulation differently: MK 421 dilates both the brachial artery and the arterioles of the forearm, but does not affect the venous vessels, and propranolol causes little arterial change but increases the forearm venous tone.", 
    "45": "Intravenous injection of 8.5 nmol (1-24)ACTH increased the plasma levels of glucagon, insulin, glucose and free fatty acids in rabbits. The (1-24)ACTH-induced hyperglucagonaemia and hyperinsulinaemia started 3 and 20 min after the injection respectively. Similar increases in the plasma levels of glucagon, insulin and free fatty acids were found with 5.3 nmol (1-39)ACTH, whereas (1-4)ACTH, (4-10)ACTH, (1-10)ACTH, (11-24)ACTH, (7-38)ACTH and (18-39)ACTH (corticotrophin-like intermediate lobe peptide) injected at doses of approximately 8 nmol were inactive. Infusions with the alpha-adrenergic blocking drug, phentolamine, reduced the (1-24) ACTH-induced hyperglucagonaemia and hyperglycaemia, and augmented the (1-24)ACTH-induced hyperinsulinaemia, which now became significant after 5 min. Infusions with the beta-adrenergic blocking drug, propranolol, did not diminish the (1-24)ACTH-induced effects, but killed the rabbits after 2-4 h. It is concluded that the acute in-vivo effects of ACTH in rabbits are modulated by the involvement of alpha-adrenergic receptors, which increased the plasma levels of glucagon and glucose, and delayed and diminished the ACTH-induced increases in the plasma levels of insulin. The (1-24)ACTH-induced increases in the plasma levels of free fatty acids were not influenced by the adrenergic blocking drugs.", 
    "46": "The acute administration of 0.015-1.5 nmol ovine corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) into the lateral ventricle of gonadectomized (or gonadectomized/adrenalectomized) female rats caused a rapid and prolonged dose-related inhibition of LH (but not FSH) secretion. By contrast, the acute peripheral injection of up to 15 nmol CRF was without effect in the same animal preparations. In cycling intact female rats, injection of 1.5 nmol CRF into the brain or of 75 nmol CRF sc inhibited ovulation and blocked the proestrous LH surge in about 50% of the animals. Lower doses of peripherally administered CRF were ineffective. Finally, CRF injected daily sc (15 nmol/day) to female rats during the first 12 days after mating caused a 40% disruption of pregnancy. These results indicate that CRF will lower plasma LH levels and can exert this effect in the absence of circulating steroids of either adrenal or gonadal origin. CRF inhibition of LH secretion, which we have previously reported to be absent in vitro, was unaltered by the opiate receptor antagonist naltrexone or by the ganglionic blocker chlorisondamine. Furthermore, blockade of CRF-induced beta-endorphin or ACTH release into the general circulation by dexamethasone did not interfere with the inhibitory effect of CRF on LH secretion. Such observations suggest that CRF exerts deleterious actions on reproductive functions through brain sites of action which, at least under the experimental mental design used, do not appear to directly involve opiate or peripheral catecholaminergic pathways.", 
    "47": "Because of recent findings, a reassessment is needed of the concept that rest angina associated with ST-segment depression is due to a spontaneous, transient increase of blood pressure or heart rate, or both, in the presence of critical coronary artery stenosis. Continuous hemodynamic and electrocardiographic recordings done before and during attacks of rest angina and thallium-201 scintigrams done during pain indicate that a transient reduction of flow is the immediate cause of ischemia in most, but not all, instances. Flow reduction, in turn, appears to be due to coronary arterial spasm or platelet aggregation, or both, acting at a site of atherosclerotic narrowing. Therapy for unstable rest angina should include measures to prevent both transient reductions of flow and increases of myocardial oxygen consumption. A combination of long-acting nitrates, a beta-blocker, a calcium-channel blocker, and aspirin or heparin is suggested for this purpose. Intravenous nitroglycerin is useful when angina occurs despite this therapy or when frequent attacks of ischemia are occurring at the time of admission.", 
    "48": "Mice exhibited marked suppression of motor activity when placed in the same environment where they had previously received electric shocks. Morphine-HCl (20 mg/kg) markedly attenuated such a conditioned suppression in mice. The morphine-induced reduction of the conditioned suppression was antagonized by pretreatment with reserpine (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg), haloperiodol, pimozide and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, but not atropine-sulfate, p-chlorophenylalanine, phenoxybenzamine-HCl or propranolol. Thus, it is possible that the potentiation of the dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain is involved in the morphine-induced reduction of the conditioned suppression in mice.", 
    "49": "In 18 patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension who responded favorably to acebutolol antihypertensive therapy, echocardiography (echo) was performed in the basal condition and after 6 and 12 months of follow-up. Acebutolol induced a significant decrease in blood pressure (BP), from a basal value of 167 +/- 3/105 +/- 2 mm Hg to 138 +/- 5/90 +/- 2 mm Hg after 6 months (p less than 0.01) and to 134 +/- 3/91 +/- 3 mm Hg after 1 year (p less than 0.01), and in heart rate, from 75 +/- 3 to 63 +/- 2 beats/min after 6 months (p less than 0.01) and to 63 +/- 2 beats/min after 1 year (p less than 0.01). The decrease in BP was achieved through a decrease in cardiac output from 6.3 +/- 0.28 to 5.3 +/- 0.25 liters/min after 6 months (p less than 0.05) and to 5.32 +/- 0.2 liters/min after 1 year (p less than 0.05), which resulted from a reduction in heart rate; stroke volume did not show significant change during the treatment and left ventricular (LV) performance was improved. There was a parallel decrease in LV posterior wall and ventricular septal thicknesses and estimated LV mass. In patients with LV hypertrophy, the change in mass was significantly correlated with the change in heart rate both after 6 and 12 months of therapy (r = 0.6234, p less than 0.05 and r = 0.7121, p less than 0.05 after 6 and 12 months, respectively).", 
    "50": "We have investigated alterations in adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase activity in cardiac membranes from rats injected with 40 mg/kg intraperitoneal isoproterenol. Reduction in the number of beta-adrenergic and alpha-adrenergic receptors, as assessed by changes in specific binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol (DHA) and 3H-dihydroergocryptine (DHE), was observed only at 9 and 24 hours after isoproterenol injection, respectively. On the other hand, epinephrine-stimulated, NaF-stimulated, and Gpp (NH)p-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was decreased as early as 3 hours after isoproterenol treatment without changes in the basal adenylate cyclase activity. These results demonstrate a defect in the adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase system during the development of catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy and may partly explain the attenuated inotropic adrenergic response of the heart under stressful situations.", 
    "51": "The present in vitro investigation was undertaken in an attempt to obtain further information on beta-adrenoceptor specificity and action in the rat parotid gland, with regard to amylase secretion. The beta 1-selective agonist prenalterol was roughly 800 times more potent than the beta 2-agonist terbutaline, and about 5 times more effective than noradrenaline in evoking amylase release . Propranolol was the most effective inhibitor of amylase release in all experiments. The beta 1-selective antagonist metoprolol and H104 /08 were also effective blockers of maximal noradrenaline- and prenalterol-induced release. The inhibition curves displayed biphasic shapes when amylase secretion was induced by noradrenaline, but not when prenalterol was the secretagogue. The beta 2-antagonist H35 /25 was without effect on maximal noradrenaline- and prenalterol-stimulated secretion. The amylase release evoked by submaximal concentration of terbutaline was inhibited by the two antagonists H35/25 and IPS 339. In another series of experiments propranolol and metoprolol clearly shifted the noradrenaline concentration-response curve to the right, whereas H35/25 was without effect. The results further demonstrate the major importance of the beta 1-adrenoceptor (noradrenaline-activated) in eliciting amylase release from the rat parotid gland. However, it is also suggested that the beta 2-adrenoceptors (terbutaline-activated) may to some extent serve the same function.", 
    "52": "Blockade of kidneys' beta-1 adrenoreceptors with talinolol entailed in anesthetized rats a sodium- uretic response accompanied by inhibition of sodium reabsorption and an increase of the blood flow in cortical and external layers with no PO2 changes, at that. Haloperidol prevented the increase of blood flow in the external layer but did not affect the cortical hemodynamic shift or the depressing influence of talinolol on the channel transport of sodium. The inhibiting agent for the kallikrein-kinin system contrical and the inhibiting agent for prostaglandin synthesis indomethacin did not alter the kidney response to the drug under study. The hemodynamic shift as well as the inhibition of sodium reabsorption seem to be unrelated either to excitation of receptors sensitive to dopamine, or to activation of the kallikrein-kinin system or stimulation of prostaglandin synthesis.", 
    "53": "A single-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to compare the inhibitory effects of intravenous propranolol on exercise-induced tachycardia in eight matched pairs of healthy black and white volunteers, consisting of equal numbers of men and women. At the beginning of each test session, subjects were exercised on a bicycle ergometer--the load predetermined to increase their heart rates to 160-190 beats/min. Exactly 30 min after having received an intravenous injection of placebo or propranolol (the dose varying from 0.0125 to 0.15 mg/kg), they were subjected to the same exercise load. Heart rates were continuously recorded throughout exercise periods, and readings at 6, 8, and 10 min were compared for pre- and postinjection periods. A washout period of at least 3 days was allowed to elapse between sessions. Postinjection reductions of heart rate in blacks were compared with postinjection reductions in their white counterparts. Analysis of results indicated that the dose-response curve for the heart rate reduction resulting from propranolol for blacks was shifted to the right with respect to that for whites. In clinical terms, this means that to achieve the same degree of beta-blockade in blacks, a larger dose of propranolol is required than for whites, but that the same maximum is attainable.", 
    "54": "Using a semiautomatic device (Remler), ambulatory blood pressure was recorded in ambulatory hypertensive patients who were either untreated (n = 55) or treated chronically with beta-blocking agents (n = 28), diuretics (n = 42), or a combination of both (n = 75). In all patients, one blood pressure reading was obtained during usual activities every 30 min for 12 h. The selection of untreated patients was based on clinic measurements (two to three repeated blood pressures of greater than 140/89 mm Hg). The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures averaged from all patients over the whole day did not differ significantly among the groups, ranging from 133.7 to 141 mm Hg for the systolic and from 83.8 to 88.4 mm Hg for the diastolic. The variability of blood pressure, reflected by the difference between the average of the three highest and the three lowest values of the day, was not different among the four groups and ranged from 41.4 to 50.6 mm Hg for the systolic and from 30.1 to 34.4 mm Hg for the diastolic. Similarly, variability expressed as the standard deviation of the mean of all blood pressures measured during the day did not differ among the groups. In all groups, blood pressure was highest in the morning and lowest in early afternoon, and tended to rise again in the late afternoon. Thus, blood pressure variability of hypertensive patients is not changed by antihypertensive therapy with beta-blocking agents and/or diuretics.", 
    "55": "The actions of catecholamines on VIP-induced cyclic AMP is studied in human colon. We show that: (1) Epinephrine in the 10(-7)-10(-3) M concentration range (ED50 = 11.10(-6) M) inhibits VIP-induced cyclic AMP rise in isolated colonic epithelial cells; the maximal inhibition reaches 30% of VIP effect; epinephrine alters the efficacy of the peptide and does not modify its potency; epinephrine also reduces the basal cyclic AMP level. (2) The inhibition is found with other alpha adrenergic agonists with the order of potencies epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than phenylephrine. Clonidine has a poor intrinsic activity but antagonizes the action of epinephrine. (3) The inhibition of VIP action by epinephrine is reversed by the alpha antagonists dihydroergotamine, phentolamine and the alpha 2 antagonist yohimbine, while unaffected by the beta antagonist propranolol and the alpha 1 antagonist prazosin, (4) Epinephrine inhibits VIP-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in preparations of colonic plasma membranes. Thus catecholamines exert through an alpha 2 adrenoreceptor a negative control on basal and VIP-stimulated cyclic AMP formation in human colon. We suggest that colonic cyclic AMP metabolism undergoes a dual control: VIPergic, activator and adrenergic, inhibitor.", 
    "56": "The sympathetic stimulation under slow pilocarpine-induced flow conditions brought about a decrease in this flow rate that could be due to vasoconstriction, since such an effect was not observed after the administration of phentolamine (4 mg/kg i.v.). Contrariwise the injection of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (propranolol 2-2.5 mg/kg i.v.) produced a decrease of the salivary flow rate that was even greater than in the control animals. These results suggest that the secretory effect in this gland and species is predominantly beta-adrenergic. The stated results are related to the changes observed in the blood outflow from the gland.", 
    "57": "The stimulation of the superior cervical ganglion increased the salivary flow rate (about five-fold) in all 35 rabbits studied but two. The administration of alpha or beta adrenoceptor blocking drugs was unable to eliminate the positive effect of the sympathetic stimulation on the salivary flow, though the flow rate fell about 50% with the administration of each of the blockers. According to these results both types of receptors may be involved in the secretory response of this gland. Nevertheless it seems that the beta-adrenoceptors play a more important role in the secretory response and the alpha-adrenoceptors in the motor one.", 
    "58": "The effects of variation in dietary sodium intake on biochemical indices of sympathetic activity were investigated in normal subjects. Sodium restriction for 7 days (mean urinary sodium excretion 21 mmol/day, s.e.m. = 4) increased supine plasma noradrenaline concentration significantly (1.78 nmol/l, s.e.m. = 0.23) compared to levels during medium sodium intake (1.31 nmol/l, s.e.m. = 0.14) and high sodium intake (1.35 nmol/l, s.e.m. = 0.25), when urinary sodium excretion averaged 186 (s.e.m. = 24) and 310 (s.e.m. = 43) mmol/l respectively. Plasma adrenaline concentrations did not vary significantly. During sodium restriction, the apparent release rate of noradrenaline increased significantly; noradrenaline clearance remained unchanged. No changes were observed in the heart rate response after beta-adrenoceptor stimulation with isoprenaline, suggesting that increased sympathetic activity during sodium restriction did not necessarily alter cardiac beta-receptor sensitivity. The responses to cardiac autonomic blockade with propranolol and atropine did not vary with sodium intake. These observations suggest that the sympathetic response to sodium restriction may not be generalized, excluding, in particular, the sympathetic nerves to the heart.", 
    "59": "A marked increase in left ventricular diastolic pressure ( PLVD ) relative to volume is regularly observed during angina pectoris and may contribute to further deteriorations of myocardial perfusion in the ischemic myocardium and to pulmonary congestion as well. A possible simultaneous increase in myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) due to a reversible diastolic tone during transient ischemia has not been taken into consideration in previous studies on alterations in ventricular diastolic properties. 13 closed-chest experiments were carried out in clinical catheterization technique with situations of high PLVD (18-50 mm Hg) relative to volume induced by right ventricular pacing (n = 19; 172 +/- 5 beats/min) and catecholamine-induced reversible diastolic tone (n = 17) in moderate hypothermia (31 degrees C). MVO2 was directly measured and indirectly calculated from its hemodynamic determinants using Bretschneider's equation (Et) that does not consider ventricular diastolic pressure. In addition, an energy demand for maintenance of active diastolic wall tension (E5) was calculated from PLVD , mean ventricular diastolic volume estimated from endsystolic and stroke volume, diastolic time and heart rate in ml O2/min X 100 g. During pacing tachycardia with high PLVD (27.4 +/- 1.8 mm Hg) the MVO2 (12.49 +/- 0.50 ml O2/min X 100 g) exceeds Et (10.11 +/- 0.25 ml O2/min X 100 g) (p less than 0.001), partly due to neglect of E5 (1.39 +/- 0.11 ml O2/min X 100 g). During catecholamine-induced high PLVD (31.1 +/- 2.5 mm Hg) the MVO2 (12.29 +/- 0.83 ml O2/min X 100 g) increases significantly (p less than 0.001) over Et (10.43 +/- 0.81 ml O2/min X 100 g). Addition of E5 (1.76 +/- 0.14 ml O2/min X 100g) to Et abolishes the differences between MVO2 and Et yielding non-significantly different values. Results indicate by means of indirect energetic evidence the occurrence of a diastolic tone of the heart under unphysiologic conditions. Acute increases in PLVD during angina pectoris are supposed to increase MVO2 markedly due to an additional energy demand for maintenance of reversible active diastolic wall tension.", 
    "60": "Several effective drugs are available for the treatment of asthma. Their successful use depends on an accurate diagnosis and regular assessment of the patient including measurement of airflow. Effective therapy should maintain the patient free of symptoms with a good level of lung function (aiming at more than 75 per cent of predicted values). The patient's correct administration of the prescribed drugs is essential.", 
    "61": "Species differences concerning the effects of alpha- and beta-receptor stimulation on glucagon release and carbohydrate metabolism have been reported. The aim of the present study was to investigate how the subtypes of alpha- and beta-receptors regulate the plasma levels of glucagon, insulin, glucose and free fatty acids in fasted rabbits. Epinephrine-induced 1) hyperglucagonaemia, 2) hypoinsulinaemia and 3) hyperglycaemia were significantly inhibited by alpha-2 receptor blockade (yohimbine), and not influenced by alpha-1 receptor blockade (prazosin). Isoproterenol-induced 1) hyperglucagonaemia was not affected by beta-1 or beta-2 receptor blockade, 2) hyperinsulinaemia was inhibited by a lower dose of beta-2 (ICI 118.551) than beta-1 receptor blockade (metoprolol), 3) hyperglycaemia was inhibited by beta-2 receptor blockade and 4) increases in the plasma levels of free fatty acids were blocked by beta-1 receptor blockade. It is concluded that in fasted rabbits: 1) plasma levels of glucagon are mainly increased by alpha-2 receptor stimulation, 2) plasma levels of insulin are decreased by alpha-2 receptor stimulation, and increased more by beta-2 than by beta-1 receptor stimulation, 3) plasma levels of glucose are increased by alpha-2 and beta-2 receptor stimulation and 4) the plasma levels of free fatty acids are increased by beta-1 receptor stimulation.", 
    "62": "The actions of various drugs in an aging organism has a number of characteristics. The major reasons are the age-related shifts of the morphological, biochemical and functional origin that result in a change with age both of drug pharmacodynamics, and drug pharmacokinetics. The important rule of geriatric pharmacology is to prescribe strictly individual reduced dosages of drugs, especially of those to which the organism is the most sensitive ( Chebotarev , 1978). These primarily include cardiac glucosides, narcotic, hypotensive and neuroplegic drugs. The elderly should be prescribed as fewer drugs as possible. It is advisable that a complex of pharmacological drugs having similar therapeutic effects and supplementing each other, and influencing different links of the organism's self regulation be administered in small doses.", 
    "63": "Sixteen healthy volunteers of a mean age of means = 26.4 years took part in a driving simulator test in an eightfold crossover study under double-blind conditions. The additional influence of alcohol was tested acutely after a single administration of 2 mg lormetazepam, a new, highly effective derivative from the benzodiazepine class, 10 mg mepindolol sulphate, a new betablocker without sedating properties, and 10 mg diazepam. All drugs were compared with placebo and the test was performed 1, 2 and 3 hours after oral intake. The aim was to investigate particularly the risks relevant in road traffic caused by simultaneous intake of these substances with alcohol. For this purpose, besides the driving simulator, an accurate reaction test ( WDG ) and self-rating scales were used, the latter in order to assess subjective stress and anxiety levels. Lormetazepam, due to its strong sedating property, showed a reduction in driving performance and an increase in reaction time and pulse rate as compared with placebo, and these effects were highly potentiated by alcohol. Mepindolol sulphate expectedly reduced pulse rate when compared with placebo, otherwise there were no significant differences. Diazepam, when compared with placebo, like lormetazepam caused a reduction in driving performance and reaction capacity and an increase in pulse rate, but intensity and duration of this effect were less than with lormetazepam and did not reach statistical significance. No significant potentiating effects were observed after the additional application of alcohol.", 
    "64": "The full agonist isoprenaline (5.3-6.6 nmol/kg . min) and the partial beta-adrenoceptor agonist prenalterol (10.6-13.3 nmol/kg . min) were administered to cats continuously via osmotic minipumps (i.p.). After seven days the functional and adenylate cyclase responsiveness to the agonists, as well as the beta-adrenoceptor-binding characteristics, were studied in cardiac and soleus muscle preparations in vitro. After isoprenaline pretreatment, the papillary muscles and soleus muscle strips wer 15-18 times less sensitive to isoprenaline compared with muscles from control cats. The stimulatory potency (pD2) of prenalterol in the papillary muscle was not changed significantly. The affinity of the agonists to the beta-adrenoceptors was unaffected in both tissues by the pretreatment, but the densities of beta-adrenoceptors were significantly reduced, by 36% (myocardium) and 47% (soleus) respectively. In the cat papillary muscle the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) of prenalterol on contractile parameters was reduced from 84 (Tmax), 69 (dT/dtmax) and 71% (dT/ dtmin ) in control animals, to 33, 22 and 28%, respectively in the animals pretreated with isoprenaline. Prenalterol pretreatment did not induce any marked changes, either in the stimulatory potency or affinity of the agonists in the two tissues or in the maximal response (ISA) of prenalterol in the papillary muscle. The marked reduction in the stimulatory potency of isoprenaline and the reduced ISA of prenalterol in the myocardium after isoprenaline pretreatment can not be explained by the reduction in beta- adrenoceptor density alone. Since the affinity to the beta- adrenoceptors is unaffected, a reduced efficiency in the signal transmission must be the main cause.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "The influence of smoking an alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP) and serum albumin concentrations and the protein binding of phenytoin and propranolol in healthy volunteers was investigated. alpha 1-AGP concentrations were found to be statistically different (P less than 0.05) in the smokers (mean = 84.3 mg dl-1) versus non-smokers (mean = 62.8 mg dl-1). There was a trend for lower serum albumin concentrations and lower fraction unbound of propranolol in the smokers. Smoking did not affect the protein binding of phenytoin.", 
    "66": "The contractile effects of AGEPC were examined on various regions of rat isolated intestine. The duodenum, jejunum and ileum showed only the tonic component of contraction to AGEPC at the low dose (less than 10(-9) M) but at the high dose (10(-7) M) biphasic contractions were induced, consisting of a phasic followed by a tonic component. In the colon, however, the AGEPC-induced maximum contraction was comparable in magnitude to that produced by acetylcholine; also the contraction profile was different from that elicited from the other regions of the intestine. Low doses of AGEPC caused a slow, sustained contraction and at high doses phasic and tonic components were not dissociated.", 
    "67": "The endogenous protein phosphorylation stimulated by catecholamines was compared in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes. Phosphorylation of a protein with an approximate molecular weight of 57,000 was stimulated both in preadipocytes and adipocytes of 3T3-L1. Stimulated phosphorylation of four other proteins with approximate molecular weights of 90,000, 62,000, 48,000, and 32,000 was observed only in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. All of these proteins appeared to be localized in the microsomal fraction. Phosphorylation of these proteins was stimulated by norepinephrine, epinephrine, isoproterenol, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, theophylline, or 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, but not by A23187. Among the phosphorylated proteins in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the 62,000 dalton protein was most evident. Using this protein as a marker, it appeared that epinephrine and norepinephrine were effective in stimulating the phosphorylation at the same concentration range. This result was in clear contrast to the different affinities of these catecholamines for beta-receptors of 3T3-L1 adipocytes reported by Lai, Rosen, and Rubin (J. Biol. Chem. (1982) 257, 6691-6696). The phosphorylation of the 62,000 dalton protein in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was observed 1 min after the addition of norepinephrine, and dephosphorylation was observed within 10 min after the addition of propranolol.", 
    "68": "Separate assay methods have been developed for the 2 components of an 80 + 20 drug blend of bevantolol and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) in admixtures with animal feed. Drug/diet admixtures are extracted with methanol for reverse phase ion-pair liquid chromatographic (LC) assay of bevantolol, and with acetonitrile for ultraviolet spectrophotometric assay of HCT. Bevantolol, a cardioselective beta blocker, is separated from soluble feed components with an RP-18 column, using methanol-water-acetic acid (60 + 40 + 1) containing 0. 005M octane-sulfonic acid, sodium salt, as ion-pairing reagent. HCT is determined spectrophotometrically in acetonitrile extracts, using a suitable blank extract as reference. Average recovery of HCT from an admixture of 0.5 mg blend/g diet is 94.5% +/- 4.3 RSD and at 2.0 mg/g, 101.5% +/- 3.5 RSD. Bevantolol recovery from the same admixtures is 101.8% +/- 2.7 RSD and 99.0% +/- 3.5 RSD, respectively, using the method as described.", 
    "69": "The blood pressure decrease after beta-blockade is delayed and there are little data on the hemodynamic events associated with the initial decrease in blood pressure. The present study measured the hemodynamics of the initial hypotensive action of timolol maleate, a nonselective beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent, in 10 patients with essential hypertension. Frequent measurements were made for the first 30 hours of treatment, and follow-up measurements made at 3 and 6 weeks. Before treatment, mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and arteriovenous oxygen difference were 115.9 +/- 9.1 mm Hg, 4.65 +/- 1.05 liter/min, and 55.0 +/- 9.6 ml/liter, respectively. At 3 hours after the first dose of timolol, blood pressure had fallen 13.5 +/- 8.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). This was preceded by an initial decrease in cardiac output, which was not associated with a simultaneous decrease in blood pressure, and by an increase of arteriovenous oxygen difference. The early, statistically significant, decrease in cardiac output was followed by a return to normal output, which coincided with the onset of blood pressure reduction. The magnitude of the initial decrease of cardiac output and of the initial increase in arteriovenous oxygen difference was significantly correlated to the later decrease in blood pressure (7 hours after first dose). These hemodynamic observations are consistent with the notion that early underperfusions of tissue play a role in the initial hypotensive action of beta-blockers. After 6 weeks, the blood pressure remained lower but the cardiac output was again decreased at that point. As with many antihypertensive agents, there was a difference between the early and late hemodynamic pattern.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "70": "Centrally-acting, adrenergic neurone-blocking and alpha-receptor-blocking antihypertensive drugs are unacceptable for use by aircrew because of the high incidence of postural hypotension and sedation. Newer agents, including the angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitors, nifedipine and minoxidil should not be considered until more data are available. Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs can be shown to interfere with the execution of tasks under laboratory conditions in therapeutic doses and in higher doses may produce subjective feelings of sedation and reduced concentration. A peripheral component involving a direct effect on skeletal muscle function also cannot be excluded. The use of beta-blocking agents in aircrew requires individual assessment with regard to side-effects and the use of a limited number of compounds. Although probably the least likely to interfere with performance, individual diuretic drugs require to be compared and scrutinized carefully for their incidence of CNS effects and for possible effects on the execution of complex tasks.", 
    "71": "The diastereomeric glucuronides of (R)- and (S)-propranolol [(R)-PG and (S)-PG] formed by incubating the racemic drug with dog liver microsomes were separated and quantitated chromatographically. Conjugation occurred stereoselectively with 3- to 4-fold more (S)-PG than (R)-PG produced. The values for the apparent Km were 1.0 and 1.7 mM, and those of the Vmax were 6.4 and 25 nmol/min/mg protein for (R)- and (S)-propranolol, respectively. Stereoselectivity was lower in parallel incubations conducted with the separate enantiomers than in incubates with the racemic substrate. The S enantiomer was found to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of (R)-PG formation, with a Ki of 1.8 mM. (S)-PG did not inhibit (R)-PG formation when added to incubates and (R)-propranolol did not inhibit the formation of (S)-PG. The presence of sodium cholate and Brij 35 stimulated glucuronidation by 60 and 120%, respectively, but did not affect the stereoselectivity even at concentrations high enough to inhibit conjugation. On the contrary, Triton X-100 and Emulgen 911 were inhibitory and produced a decrease in stereoselectivity; the magnitude of these effects increased with increasing detergent concentration.", 
    "72": "Cetamolol, a new beta-adrenoceptor blocker with partial agonist activity and cardioselectivity, was studied in vivo to determine its membrane-stabilizing effects. Comparisons were carried out with atenolol, pindolol, practolol, propranolol, timolol, dexpropranolol, lidocaine, and procaine. The following results indicated that cetamolol lacked membrane-stabilizing activity: (i) failure to cause local anesthesia on the rabbit cornea and motor nerve of the rat tail; (ii) ineffectiveness in reversing ventricular arrhythmias induced by coronary artery litigation in dogs; (iii) failure to reduce cardiac automaticity in catecholamine-depleted dogs as determined by the rate of a subatrial rhythm during ventricular (vagal) escape; and (iv) lack of a significant increase in atrioventricular conduction time in vagotomized or atropinized dogs in contrast to the effect in normal dogs indicating a reflex effect of cetamolol. Other results include a restoration of sinus rhythm in dogs with ventricular tachycardia induced by ouabain, and a dose-related decline in the force of cardiac contraction in anesthetized dogs at doses from 3 to 15 mg/kg, which occurred after an initial increase in force owing to intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Although the mechanisms for the latter two effects are not clear at this time, explanations other than membrane-stabilizing activity have been considered in view of the other findings. It is concluded that cetamolol lacks membrane-stabilizing activity even at inordinately high doses.", 
    "73": "Neurochemical effects of electroconvulsive shock (ECS) in three neurotransmitter-receptor systems were studied in relation to the mechanism of action and adverse effects of ECT. In the noradrenergic system, chronically administered ECS, along with other effective antidepressant treatments, has been consistently reported to down-regulate beta-adrenergic receptors in rat cerebral cortex. Even when ECS was administered according to an intermittent clinically equivalent schedule, a 21% reduction in cortical 3H-DHA binding to beta-adrenoreceptors could be demonstrated 4 days after the last treatment. However, the role of presynaptic NA events in beta-adrenoreceptor down-regulation by ECS and the antidepressant mechanism of ECT remains to be clarified. Compared to the MAO inhibitor clorgyline, repeated ECS pretreatment induced only a moderate increase in NA release from a rat cortical vesicular preparation and minimally reduced the sensitivity of the preparation to release-inhibition by clonidine. In the dopaminergic system, a clinically equivalent ECS schedule had no direct effect on behavioral or biochemical indices of DA receptor sensitivity. However, the same ECS schedule significantly attenuated haloperidol-induced behaviorally and biochemically measured DA supersensitivity in the same model in which parallel effects had been reported for lithium. The possibility that a \"receptor-stabilizing\" mechanism may be common to ECT and lithium is considered on the basis of similarities in the clinical profiles of the two treatments. In the cholinergic system, repeated ECS significantly reduced 3H-QNB binding to muscarinic cholinergic receptors in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Concurrently administered ECS also blocked the increase in 3H-QNB binding caused by chronic atropine administration. ECS effects on muscarinic cholinergic receptors may have relevance to the antidepressant mechanism of ECT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "74": "An ideal cardiotonic agent should improve cardiac contractility and increase the oxygen supply to various tissues without inducing tachycardia, arrhythmias, decrease in coronary blood flow or increment in oxygen requirements of the myocardium. It should also be safe and orally active and have a persistent action. The aim of this paper is to describe various positive inotropic drugs at our disposal. The hemodynamic effects and the indications of adrenaline, noradrenaline, isoprenaline, dopamine, dobutamine and cardiac glycosides are presented first. Then several new promising orally active compounds are discussed.", 
    "75": "Although overdoses from cardiac drugs are uncommon, these are compounds with narrow therapeutic indices and they may give rise to serious acute toxicity from accidental, deliberate or even iatrogenic overdosage. Through the National Poisons Information Service for England and the Poisons Unit laboratory, we monitor reports of serious toxicity from this group of drugs and use the information gained to assess our recommendations for treatment. This article reviews the toxicity and the management of overdosage with digoxin and representative drugs from each class of anti-arrhythmic drugs. From these observations, a general plan of management applicable to all cardiac drugs is proposed and its is suggested that this form of monitoring should be continued."
