Patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma who received first-line treatment with either travoprost or latanoprost/timolol and were followed up for >6 months were included. Treatment failure was defined as a treatment change or a glaucoma intervention (laser therapy or surgery). Time to treatment failure was compared using a Cox model and adjusted by the propensity score method.", 
    "2": "Eligible patients received either travoprost (n=639) or latanoprost/timolol (n=176). Their mean age was 70 years at diagnosis and 48.2% of patients were male. Patient characteristics did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Treatment failure rates at 1 year were 31.3% (travoprost) and 39.4% (latanoprost/timolol) and yielded a hazard ratio for failure in favour of travoprost (0.75; p<0.04) after adjusting for age, sex, co-morbidities and duration of follow-up. Adjusted annual costs of glaucoma management were significantly (p<0.001) less with travoprost (pound215.86) than with latanoprost/timolol (pound327.83).", 
    "3": "In everyday practice, travoprost was maintained longer than latanoprost/timolol as first-line therapy for glaucoma. The mean daily costs of travoprost were 50.8% less per patient than those of latanoprost/timolol. Despite adjustments, these results might be confounded, at least partially, by disease severity.",

Intraocular pressures were 33 mmHg and 32 mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively, with conjunctival chemosis, corneal edema, shallow anterior chambers, and closed angles. Her refraction was -7.50 diopters in both eyes. The symptoms and clinical findings resolved completely upon discontinuation of topiramate and, administration of antiglaucoma drugs.",

Hospital physicians supervised initiation of treatment and first up-titration in 85.6% and 61.4% of patients, respectively. 49.2% of patients were prescribed the recommended starting dosage of carvedilol (6.25 mg/day). Approximately 25% of patients started on a lower dose than recommended, and the same proportion were prescribed a higher dose. NYHA status of cardiac failure between starting treatment and the third questionnaire improved for 39.5% of patients, deteriorated for 10.9%, and 11.7% of those for whom NYHA status was given died. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported for 2.4% of patients; the most commonly reported ADR was malaise/lassitude. Overall, 27.1% of patients stopped taking carvedilol. None of the 163 deaths were attributed to carvedilol.",

    "27": "Myocardial infarction (MI)-induced remodeling is associated with disturbed myocardial perfusion through vascular changes, such as reduced capillary density and endothelial dysfunction. Heart rate reduction (HRR) initiated immediately after MI stimulates angiogenesis and attenuates left ventricular dysfunction. We aimed to investigate the effects of long-term HRR on cardiac angiogenesis and endothelial function in a rat model of post-MI heart failure. Rats received early or late ivabradine or metoprolol for 12 or 9 weeks, respectively, and compared with untreated MI and sham animals 12 weeks after MI. Heart rate was measured in the conscious rat. MI resulted in an increased heart weight to body weight ratio, a decline in capillary density and a marked reduction in acetylcholine-induced relaxation. Early and late HRR by either ivabradine or metoprolol significantly increased capillary to myocyte ratio. Moreover, this ratio was significantly correlated to heart rate (r = -0.324 and P = 0.036). Neither early nor late chronic HRR prevented endothelial dysfunction, except a moderate improvement in late MI ivabradine group. In MI rats, HRR either by ivabradine or metoprolol treatment increases cardiac angiogenesis. Late HRR strategy was comparable to early HRR, suggesting that the beneficial effects are independent of the time of onset of therapy after MI.", 
    "28": "The neurotransmitter noradrenaline (NA) can provide neuroprotection against insults including inflammatory stimuli and excitotoxicity, which may involve paracrine effects of neighboring glial cells. Astrocytes express and secrete a variety of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules; however, the effects of NA on astrocyte chemokine expression have not been well characterized. In primary astrocytes, NA increased expression of chemokine CCL2 (MCP-1) at the mRNA and protein levels. NA increased activation of an MCP-1 promoter driving luciferase expression, which was replicated by beta-adrenergic receptor agonists and a cAMP analog, and blocked by a specific beta2-adrenergic receptor antagonist. In primary neurons, addition of MCP-1 reduced NMDA-dependent glutamate release as well as glutamate-dependent Ca(2+) entry. Similarly, conditioned media from NA-treated astrocytes reduced glutamate release, an effect that was blocked by neutralizing antibody to MCP-1, whereas MCP-1 dose-dependently reduced neuronal damage attributable to NMDA or to glutamate. MCP-1 significantly reduced lactate dehydrogenase release from neurons after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and prevented the loss of ATP levels that occurred after OGD or treatment with glutamate. Incubation of neurons with astrocytes separated by a membrane to prevent physical contact showed that NA induced astrocyte release of sufficient MCP-1 to reduce neuronal damage attributable to OGD. These findings indicate that the neuroprotective effects of NA are mediated, at least in part, by induction and release of astrocyte MCP-1.",

Pindolol is a representative of this type of compound, either from the structural point of view, or as reference for comparison of the pharmacokinetic properties of the beta-blockers. A study of the pindolol structure based on infrared spectroscopy and natural bond orbital (NBO) theory is the main aim of the present research. FTIR spectra of the solid pindolol were recorded from 4000 to 400cm(-1), at temperatures between 25 and -170 degrees C. For spectral interpretation, the theoretical vibrational spectra of the conformer present in the solid was obtained at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. NBO analysis of the reference conformer, before and after optimization, was carried out at the same level of theory referred above. Characteristic absorption vibrational bands of the spectra of solid pindolol and of the isolated conformer were identified. Intra- and intermolecular interactions in pindolol were confirmed by the frequency shift of the vibrational modes and by the NBO theory. A detailed molecular picture of pindolol and of its intermolecular interactions was obtained from spectroscopy and NBO theory. The combination of both methods gives a deeper insight into the structure.",

Large-scale studies have pointed out that affected individuals are particularly at risk in the period following pregnancy (post-partum). This is recognised especially for women with an LQTS type 2. Here, we describe two cases of young women with LQTS type 2, both admitted to our institution with symptomatic torsades de pointes a few weeks after delivery. Both patients carried a mutation in the KCNH2 gene. One patient was nullipara, while the other had had an uneventful previous pregnancy. In both cases treatment with a beta-blocker did not prevent life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The risk of arrhythmias is thought to gradually decrease to pre-pregnancy values in the nine months after delivery.

In addition, these drugs have proven to be molecular probes that have contributed to our understanding of disease, and on the molecular level, both the structure and the function of the 7 transmembrane G protein receptors, which mediate the actions of many different hormones, neurotransmitters, and drugs. The evolution of beta-blocker drug development has led to refinements in their pharmacodynamic actions that include agents with relative beta1-selectivity, partial agonist activity, concomitant alpha-adrenergic blockers activity, and direct vasodilator activity. In addition, long-acting and ultra-short-acting formulations of beta-blockers have also demonstrated a remarkable record of clinical safety in patients of all ages.

The influence of fatty acid type, chain length and hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) on the in vitro drug release as well as its permeation across hairless rat skin were studied and compared aiming to select a patch formula for clinical performance. Skin irritation induced by SE patch was evaluated by visual scoring, color reflectance measurements and non-invasive transepidermal water loss (TEWL) technique. The results indicated that among different SEs tried, laurate SE with shorter fatty acid chain length and higher HLB value significantly increased the amount of TM liberated from the patch (99+/-2.1%) and its permeation across rat skin (86+/-4.3%). The total drug permeation and flux values were approximately 5-fold greater compared to SE free patch. The extent of absorption of TM-SE patch expressed by AUC was 64% larger as compared to the oral solution with steady plasma concentration over 18 h and relative bioavailability (F(rel)) of 163%.

It is unknown whether nebivolol, a third generation beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, possesses properties that can attenuate this apoptosis. Multicellular preparations from rabbit hearts were mounted in a culture system that allows for measurement of contractile parameters over several days. Culturing these muscles on a constant high preload induces apoptosis of the cardiomyocytes. Of each heart, 1 preloaded muscle preparation was treated with nebivolol (10(-6) mol/l), 1 preloaded without continuous exposure to nebivolol (positive control) and 1 unloaded (negative control). After 48 h of continuous loaded contractions, apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL-assay to confirm that nuclei of myocytes were affected, or by DNA-ladder intensity analysis for semiquantification. Maximal twitch force development was slightly, but significantly, lower in preparations contracting in presence of nebivolol (compared to solvent) while twitch-timing parameters were similar. After 48 h of continuous contractions, no additional differences were observed between the groups regarding contractile parameters. DNA-ladder analysis showed a similar rate of apoptosis in presence of nebivolol. Nebivolol does not increase, nor decrease, the rate of load-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis.",

The objective of this study was to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of landiolol hydrochloride in healthy male subjects. A total of 420 blood concentration data points collected from 47 healthy male subjects were used for the population pharmacokinetic analysis. NONMEM was used for population pharmacokinetic analysis. In addition, the final pharmacokinetic model was evaluated using a bootstrap method and a leave-one-out cross validation method. The concentration time course of landiolol hydrochloride was best described by a two-compartment model with lag time. The final parameters were total body clearance (CL: 36.6 mL/min/kg), distribution volume of the central compartment (V1: 101 mL/kg), inter-compartmental clearance (16.1 mL/min/kg), distribution volume of the peripheral compartment (55.6 mL/kg), and lag time (0.82 min). The inter-individual variability in the CL and V1 were 21.8% and 46.3%, respectively. The residual variability was 22.1%. Model evaluation by the two different methods indicated that the final model was robust and parameter estimates were reasonable.

Methods and Results This study prospectively examined the effect of carvedilol on the severity of CSA in patients with CHF. Polysomnographic findings, left ventricular (LV) function, and plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level were evaluated before and 6 months after induction of carvedilol in 16 patients with CHF (New York Heart Association functional class II or III and LV ejection fraction <50%) who had CSA (central apnea index [CAI] >5 with dominant central apneic events). All patients tolerated carvedilol. The 6-month treatment with carvedilol increased the LV ejection fraction (32+/-7.4% to 45+/-9.8%, P<0.001) and decreased the BNP level (159 [69-458] pg/ml to 38 [16-193] pg/ml, P=0.017). The polysomnographic findings showed that the treatment decreased the apnea-hypopnea index (34+/-13 to 14+/-13, P=0.003) and CAI (13+/-11 to 1.9+/-4.3, P<0.001), whereas it increased the obstructive apnea index (1.1+/-1.5 to 3.1+/-3.4, P=0.04).

Short-term randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that nebivolol has antihypertensive efficacy benefits comparable to other beta blockers but with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. The long-term safety and efficacy results of oral nebivolol (5, 10, or 20 mg) 1 time/day, as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, were assessed in a double-blind, multicenter, 9-month extension study of 3 phase III, double-blind, 3-month trials in patients with stage I to II hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressures [BPs]>or=95 and <or=109 mm Hg). Patients were eligible for entry if they had completed 1 of 3 feeder trials of nebivolol monotherapy (1.25 to 40 mg) 1 time/day. Dose titration and use of additional antihypertensive agents were used to achieve a diastolic BP goal of <90 mm Hg. The primary efficacy end point was change in diastolic BP at trough compared with baseline of the feeder study. Of the 845 patients entering this study, 607 patients (72%) were receiving nebivolol monotherapy, 206 patients (24%) were taking nebivolol plus diuretic, 21 patients (2%) were taking nebivolol plus calcium channel blocker, and 11 patients (1%) were taking nebivolol plus other antihypertensive medication at study end. Patients receiving nebivolol monotherapy had decreases in diastolic and systolic BPs of 15.0 and 14.8 mm Hg, respectively. More than 78% of patients were responders to nebivolol monotherapy, and 65% were responders to combination with a diuretic. Overall incidence of adverse events in the extension study was comparable to that seen in the feeder studies and decreased over time. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that nebivolol is a safe and effective antihypertensive therapy that provides long-term BP-lowering effects with a favorable tolerability profile.",

This study compared the effects of beta blocker and digoxin on mortality in patients with both AF and HF. In a single-center institution, patients with AF and HF seen between January 2000 and January 2004 were identified and followed until September 2007. Of 1,269 consecutive patients with both AF and HF, 260 were treated with a beta blocker alone, 189 with beta blocker plus digoxin, 402 with digoxin alone, and 418 without beta blocker or digoxin (control group). During a follow-up of 881+/-859 days, 247 patients died. Compared with the control group, treatment with beta blocker was associated with a decreased mortality (relative risk=0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.85, p=0.005 for beta blocker alone and 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.87, p=0.008 for beta blocker plus digoxin). By contrast, treatment with digoxin alone was not associated with a better survival (relative risk=0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.73 to 1.30, p=NS). Results remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders and similar when we considered, separately, HF with permanent or nonpermanent AF, presence or absence of coronary disease, and patients with decreased or preserved systolic function. In conclusion, in unselected patients with AF and HF, treatments with beta blocker alone or with beta blocker plus digoxin are associated with a similar decrease in the risk of death. Digoxin alone is associated with a worse survival chance, similar to that of patients without any rate control treatment.",

    "87": "Several cardiovascular disorders have been related to alterations in beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) signaling at or beyond the receptor level. During the stress reaction, the sympathetic-adrenal medullary system and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal cortex axis are activated, causing beta-AR overstimulation and remodeling of the beta(1)/beta(2)/beta(3)-AR ratio in cardiomyocytes. In a model of foot-shock stress, we described decreased beta(1)-AR signaling occurring simultaneously with increased beta(2)-AR signaling, whereas the response to the nonconventional agonist, CGP12177, was not altered. These alterations may play an adaptive role to the increased sympathetic drive to the heart, protecting the cardiac tissue from the cardiotoxic effects mediated by beta(1)-ARs overstimulation without altering cardiac output, since this would be sustained by the beta(2)-AR, which would also protect myocytes from apoptosis. Moreover, the selective enhancement of the beta(2)-AR population might help to diminish the risk of overstimulation since this adrenoceptor subtype couples to both, stimulatory G (Gs) and inhibitory G (Gi) proteins. On the other hand, in the model of neurogenic hypertension, the decrease in beta(1)-AR-mediated response is not followed by increase in the beta(2)-AR-mediated response. However, the response to CGP12177, which was desensitized 48 h after the surgery, was normalized 7 days after that, when beta(1)-AR were downregulated. Therefore, both experimental models provided evidence that the classical isoform of beta(1)-AR and the recently described low-affinity isoform of beta(1)-AR show independent behavior and provide the heart with adaptive mechanisms to increased sympathetic stimulation during stress.",

    "92": "Secondary degeneration is a form of 'bystander' damage that can affect neural tissue both nearby and remote from an initial injury. Partial optic nerve transection is an excellent model in which to unequivocally differentiate events occurring during secondary degeneration from those resulting from primary CNS injury. We analysed the primary injury site within the optic nerve (ON) and intact areas vulnerable to secondary degeneration. Areas affected by the primary injury showed morphological disruption, loss of beta-III tubulin axonal staining, reduced myelinated axon density, greater proteoglycan expression (phosphacan), increased microglia and macrophage numbers and increased oxidative stress. Similar, but less extreme, changes were seen in areas of the optic nerve undergoing secondary degeneration. The CNS-specific L- and T-type calcium channel blocker lomerizine alleviated some of the changes in areas vulnerable to secondary degeneration. Lomerizine reduced morphological disruption, oxidative stress and phosphacan expression, and limited early increases in macrophage numbers. However, lomerizine failed to prevent progressive de-myelination of ON axons. Within the retina, secondary retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death was significant in areas vulnerable to secondary degeneration. Lomerizine protected RGCs from secondary death at 4 weeks but did not fully restore behavioural function (optokinetic nystagmus). We conclude that blockade of calcium channels is neuroprotective and limits secondary degenerative changes following CNS injury. However such an approach may need to be combined with other treatments to ensure long-term maintenance of full visual function.",

We determined the relative roles of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) in regulating stress-induced changes in heart rate (HR) in wild-caught European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). In both heart-rate variability (HRV) analysis and receptor blockade (atropine and propranolol) experiments, baseline HR was controlled predominantly by the PNS, whereas the increase in HR resulting from acute restraint stress was controlled predominantly by the SNS. These results indicate similar cardiac control of baseline and acute-stress-induced HR in wild-caught starlings and mammals. We further investigated HR responses during chronic stress. Driven primarily by changes in PNS regulation, baseline HR increased during the day but decreased at night. In addition, elevated HRs during acute restraint stress were attenuated throughout chronic stress and were accompanied by decreased HRV. This suggested that increased SNS drive elevated HR, but the attenuated HR response combined with resistance to the SNS blocker propranolol suggested that the sympathetic signal was less effective during chronic stress. Overall, chronic stress in wild-caught starlings elicited profound changes in cardiac function that were primarily regulated by changes in the PNS.",

However, current recommendations for perioperative beta blockade are based mainly on the findings of trials with inadequate methodology and data analysis. The recently published results of the first adequately powered large controlled randomized trial on the efficacy and safety of perioperative beta-blocker therapy confirmed the benefit of such therapy on the perioperative incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarctions. However, such a benefit occurred at the expense of increased total mortality and increased incidence of stroke, negating any beneficial effect. A subsequently published meta-analysis confirmed, in large part, these findings. Given these recent publications, most of the current recommendations for perioperative beta-blocker therapy are no longer supported by evidence, therefore respective revision is needed.",

As a result, HF in the presence of normal or preserved ejection fraction, or diastolic HF, is increasingly recognized as a health care challenge. Guidelines have been issued for the classification, diagnosis, and prevention of HF from diastolic dysfunction, but treatment of this condition remains problematic. Antihypertensive agents that have been proven in clinical trials to improve outcomes in HF with systolic dysfunction, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta-blockers, have not yet demonstrated comparable benefits in patients with diastolic dysfunction.

For this study, three drugs were selected from the literature. The pharmacokinetics of all three drugs were studied in healthy adult subjects and plasma concentrations versus time data for individual subjects from extensive blood sampling were available. For population PK analysis, only five subjects were chosen and each subject gave either one or two blood samples. The estimated PK parameters from population PK analysis were compared with the PK parameters obtained from extensive sampling. The results of the study indicated that a reasonable estimate of PK parameters can be obtained with two blood samples from each subject with a sample size of five. The population PK study with sparse sampling scheme may be useful for PK studies in neonates and very young children and in subjects with rare diseases where sample size is small.",

The lisinopril intake 5 mg a day declines PPG by 18,1%. The tendency of the reduction of the functional index due to the expressed hypotensive effect of nebevolol and lisinopril was revealed in all examined patients with liver cirrhosis.

The necessity for the odontologist to be aware of adverse reactions as a result of the pharmacological interactions is due to the increase in medicament consumption by the general population. There is a demographic change with greater life expectancy and patients have increased chronic health problems and therefore have increased medicament intake. The presence of adrenaline (epinephrine) and other vasoconstrictors in local odontological anaesthetics is beneficial in relation to the duration and depth of anaesthesia and reduces bleeding and systemic toxicity of the local anaesthetic. However, it might produce pharmacological interactions between the injected vasoconstrictors and the local anaesthetic and adrenergic medicament administered exogenically which the odontologist should be aware of, especially because of the risk of consequent adverse reactions. Therefore the importance of conducting a detailed clinical history of the general state of health and include all medicaments, legal as well as illegal, taken by the patient.", 
    "132": "Our objective was to test effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on hindlimb unloading (HU)-induced bone loss and serum leptin and to compare these responses with those observed with leptin replacement. Adult male rats were randomized into six groups (n = 10 each): HU rats treated with vehicle (VEHHU), leptin analog (LEPHU), or beta-blocker (BBHU) during a 28-day HU and cage activity controls (CC) treated with the same three agents and pair-fed to HU rats. On days 0 and 28, pQCT scans of proximal tibia and serum collections for leptin assays were performed, and histomorphometric measures of proximal tibia cancellous bone were assessed. The 20% decrease in cancellous vBMD observed in the VEHHU group was halved in BBHU rats and LEPHU rats. Bone formation rate (BFR) in BBHU rats, but not in LEPHU rats, was preserved. The 3-fold increase in resorption surface with HU was abolished by BB and LEP treatments. The decrease in serum leptin after a 28-day HU was attenuated in BBHU and LEPHU rats and was predictive of the decrease in BFR with HU. Blocking sympathetic adrenergic signaling by peripheral administration of a beta-blocker during HU mitigates disuse-induced decreases in cancellous bone mass through stimulation of osteoblastic activity and suppression of osteoclastic activity. A direct effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on bone cells during HU may be enhanced by an indirect effect mitigating reductions in circulating leptin, possibly through disinhibition of leptin release from adipocytes.", 
    "133": "Mortality and morbidity rates remain high in patients with heart failure despite advances in medical therapy. Heart failure can also significantly worsen quality of life. Attention has been paid to evaluating the effects of psychological disease in patients with heart failure. Depression rates are higher in patients with heart failure than in the general population. Depression has been associated with worse outcomes in patients with heart failure. Those at highest risk for depression include patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, alcohol abuse, history of depression, and multiple comorbidities. Depression may be underdiagnosed in the heart failure population, as symptoms can often be similar in the two disease states. Evidence is limited on the effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy for depression, specifically in patients with heart failure. Based on the available literature, patients with heart failure should be screened routinely for depression. Treatment is known to improve quality of life, but its effect on outcomes such as mortality and hospital admissions for heart failure remains unknown. If treatment includes pharmacologic strategies, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (especially paroxetine and sertraline), mirtazapine, and nefazodone have the strongest efficacy evidence in this population. Based on safety data of these agents and after consideration of comorbid conditions and the potential for drug interactions, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor should be used as first-line therapy. Finally, clinicians should not avoid beta-blockers in those with a diagnosis of depression, as recent evidence demonstrates that these agents are not associated with inducing or worsening depressive symptoms.",

    "138": "Aortic valve regurgitation (AR) imposes a severe volume overload to the left ventricle (LV), which results in dilation, eccentric hypertrophy, and eventually loss of function. Little is known about the impact of AR on LV gene expression. We, therefore, conducted a gene expression profiling study in the LV of rats with acute and severe AR. We identified 64 genes that were specifically upregulated and 29 that were downregulated out of 21,910 genes after 2 wk. Of the upregulated genes, a good proportion was related to the extracellular matrix. We subsequently studied a subset of 19 genes by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to see if the modulation seen in the LV after 2 wk persisted in the chronic phase (after 6 and 12 mo) and found that it did persist. Knowing that the adrenergic and renin-angiotensin systems are overactivated in our animal model, we were interested to see if blocking those systems using metoprolol (25 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) and captopril (100 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) would alter the expression of some upregulated LV genes in AR rats after 6 mo. By qRT-PCR, we observed that upregulations of LV mRNA levels encoding for procollagens type I and III, fibronectin, atrial natriuretic peptide, transforming growth factor-beta(2), and connective tissue growth factor were totally or partially reversed by this treatment. These observations provide a molecular rationale for a medical strategy aiming these systems in the medical treatment of AR and expand the paradigm in the study of this form of LV volume overload.",

    "146": "We have earlier reported that Abeta were significantly reduced in brains of smoking Alzheimer patients and control subjects compared with non-smokers, as well as in nicotine treated APPsw transgenic mice. To examine the mechanisms by which nicotine modulates APP processing we here measured levels of secreted amyloid precursor protein (sAPPalpha), total sAPP, Abeta40 and Abeta42 in different cell lines expressing different nicotinic receptor (nAChR) subtypes or no nAChRs. Treatment with nicotine increased release of sAPPalpha and at the same time lowered Abeta levels in both SH-SY5Y and SH-SY5Y/APPsw cells expressing alpha3 and alpha7 nAChR subtypes. These effects could also be evoked by co-treatment with the competitive alpha7 nAChR antagonists alpha-bungarotoxin and methyllycaconitine (MLA), and by these antagonists alone, suggesting that binding to the agonist binding site, rather than activation of the receptor, may be sufficient to trigger changes in APP processing. The nicotine-induced increase in sAPPalpha could only be blocked by co-treatment with the open channel blocker mecamylamine. In addition to nicotine, the agonists epibatidine and cytisine both significantly increased the release of sAPP in M10 cells expressing the alpha4/beta2 nAChR subtype, and this effect was blocked by co-treatment with mecamylamine but not by the alpha4/beta2 competitive antagonist dihydro-beta-erythroidine. The lack of effect of nicotine on sAPPalpha and Abeta levels in HEK 293/APPsw cells, which do not express any nAChRs, demonstrates that the nicotine-induced attenuation of beta-amyloidosis is mediated by nAChRs and not by a direct effect of nicotine. Our data show that nicotinic compounds stimulate the non-amyloidogenic pathway and that alpha4 and alpha7 nAChRs play a major role in modulating this process. Nicotinic drugs directed towards specific nAChR subtypes might therefore be beneficial for the treatment of AD not only by lowering Abeta production but also by enhance release of neuroprotective sAPPalpha.", 
    "147": "The removal of beta blockers and psycho-active drugs was investigated in a representative conventional German WWTP by long-term measurement campaigns along different biological treatment processes. The activated sludge treatment with an elevated SRT of 18 d was the only process which led to a significant removal of certain beta blockers and psycho-active drugs. The removal efficiency was below 60% for all compounds except for the natural opium alkaloids codeine and morphine being removed by more than 80%. Primary biological transformation and sorption onto sludge as the main removal mechanisms were examined in lab-scale batch experiments. Sorption onto activated sludge was found to be negligible (<3%). The biological transformation could be described by pseudo-first order kinetics and the transformation constants k(biol) were used to predict the removal of beta blockers and psycho-active drugs in an activated sludge unit with a model. For most compounds the removal efficiencies measured on the full-scale WWTP were within the 95% confidence intervals predicted by the model. The results from full-scale measurements and modeling indicate that biological transformation in the nitrification tank together with parameters such as the sludge retention time and the temperature is crucial regarding the biological transformation of beta blockers and psycho-active drugs in conventional WWTPs.", 
    "148": "This chapter assessed the annual median discharge of over 100 pharmaceuticals to the DCZ. Calculations were based on pharmaceutical concentrations in surface-, sewage-, and industrial water in the Netherlands. In 2002, riverine discharge to the DCZ for individual pharmaceuticals varied from 0 (concentration below LOD) to 27 t yr(-1). However, in 2002 the annual amount was less than 2 t for 75% of the studied pharmaceuticals. The highest loads were calculated for X-ray contrast media, that is, values of 18-27 t yr(-1) for iopromide. The top 20 pharmaceuticals discharged by rivers to the DCZ are dominated by X-ray contrast media (n = 7), followed by antibiotics (n = 6), analgesics/antipyretics/anti-inflammatory drugs (n = 2), beta blockers (n = 2), fibrates/lipid regulators (n = 1), veterinary antibiotics (n = 1), and others (n = 1). The direct discharge (sewage water and industrial water) of pharmaceuticals to the DCZ, in 2002, for individual pharmaceuticals varied from < 0.0009 to 0.27 t yr(-1) for sewage water, and from < 0.0009 to 0.33 t yr(-1) for industrial wastewater. The highest loads were calculated for sotalol (beta blocker) and diatrizoic acid (X-ray contrast medium) in sewage water and industrial wastewater, respectively. The direct discharge of pharmaceuticals to the DCZ is < 5% of that from riverine discharge. The discharge of these pharmaceuticals to the DCZ in 2002 is in the same order of magnitude as the discharge rates of the mandatory OSPAR substances Cd (8.8-10 t yr(-1)) and Hg (3.3 t yr(-1)), and are higher than the discharge rates of the mandatory substance lindane (0.041-0.055 t yr(-1)) and the recommended substance PCBs (0.217 t yr(-1)). Although some pharmaceuticals are discharged in significant amounts to the DCZ, the human and ecotoxicological risks of these highly biologically active compounds are largely unknown. To determine the environmental hazard and risk of discharged pharmaceuticals to the marine environment, future research should focus on a baseline study and a risk assessment of the discharged pharmaceuticals in the DCZ.", 
    "149": "Were studied the effects of atropine and beta-adrenoblockers on the power of very low (<0.25 Hz), low (0.25-0.70 Hz), and high frequency (0.7-1.8 Hz) waves of the heart rhythm in wakeful rats. Atropine reduced the power of all waves in 100% cases. Propranolol on average decreased the power of very low frequency waves and increased the power of low and high frequency waves, although opposite effects were observed in many cases. Atenolol produced similar effects. Some animals demonstrated spontaneous moderation of respiratory rate to a level corresponding to low-frequency oscillations of the heart rhythm accompanied by elevation of the relative power of low frequency waves. Inconsistency of the effects of beta-adrenoblockers in rats can be related to variability of sympathetic tone and spontaneous deceleration of respiration with the corresponding changes of low frequency waves. Augmentation of the high frequency waves during application of beta-adrenoblockers is not related to their action on CNS.", 
    "150": "Several hamster strains are commonly used as models for cardiomyopathic phenotypes evolving toward heart failure. However, little is known about heart rate variability (HRV) in this species. Prolonged surface ECG recording, a prerequisite to HRV studies, can be obtained either by telemetry or by restraints. Here, we performed long time ECG recording using telemetry on young adult Syrian hamsters and we analyzed time series of interbeat intervals. Standard statistics showed that the mean of normal R-R intervals slightly increased with age, with standard deviation of normal R-R intervals remaining stable over time. However, time domain analysis using Poincar\u00e9 plots revealed dynamic changes in the HRV. Analysis of frequency domains revealed that the ratio of spectral components (low frequency/high frequency) exhibited a maturation pattern. Thus refined analysis of HRV revealed a more complex pattern than common statistical analysis would translate. Unlike other rodents, hamsters display a great spontaneous variability of their heart rate. As the complexity canvas of HRV might be the consequence of extracardiac regulation factors, we assessed the sympathovagal balance in both time and frequency domain of heart rate. Pharmacological tests revealed that both sympathetic and vagal tones contribute to HRV in Syrian hamsters. Thus Syrian hamsters have a broad intrinsic HRV with large influences of the neurovegetative system. However, the influence of the previous beat seems to prevail over the autonomic oscillators. These animals present a high sensitivity to artificially altered cardiac regulation and might be great models for the diagnosis of early alterations in the HRV related to pathology. Therefore, Syrian hamsters represent a unique model for HRV studies.", 
    "151": "Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is commonly used although clinical studies questioned its diagnostic value. Sophisticated FHR variability (fHRV) measures such as fHRV complexity may improve the sensitivity and specificity of FHR monitoring. A more detailed understanding of the physiology underlying fHRV complexity is essential to harness its use for monitoring fetal health. To examine the specific effects of vagal and sympathetic modulations on fHRV complexity, we blocked vagal activity with atropine and sympathetic activity with propranolol in near-term fetal sheep (n = 7, 0.85 gestation). Under these conditions, we analyzed the linear and nonlinear parts of fHRV complexity from autonomic information flow. Overall fHRV complexity decreased with both drugs compared with nonrapid eye movement sleep baseline (P < 0.05). With atropine, this was because of a decrease of the linear part of fHRV complexity on the long-term time scale (P < 0.05), suggesting that vagal modulation of fHRV is adequately described by linear fHRV measures. With propranolol, the nonlinear part of fHRV complexity decreased on the short-term time scale (P < 0.05), suggesting that sympathetic influences on fHRV can be detected by the nonlinear part of fHRV complexity. Thus the complex interplay of vagal and sympathetic modulations of fHRV is reflected differently and specifically in the linear and nonlinear properties of fHRV complexity, and on different time scales. Analysis of linear and nonlinear properties of fHRV may improve sensitivity and specificity of FHR monitoring.", 
    "152": "Agonist occupied alpha(1)-adrenoceptors (alpha(1)-ARs) engage several signaling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, calcium mobilization, arachidonic acid release, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation, and cAMP accumulation. The natural agonist norepinephrine (NE) activates with variable affinity and intrinsic efficacy all adrenoceptors, and in cells that coexpress alpha(1)- and beta-AR subtypes, such as cardiomyocytes, this leads to coactivation of multiple downstream pathways. This may result in pathway cross-talk with significant consequences to heart physiology and pathologic state. To dissect signaling components involved specifically in alpha(1A)- and beta(2)-AR signal interplay, we have developed a recombinant model system that mimics the levels of receptor expression observed in native cells. We followed intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization to monitor in real time the activation of both G(q) and G(s) pathways. We found that coactivation of alpha(1A)- and beta(2)-AR by the nonselective agonist NE or via a combination of the highly selective alpha(1A)-AR agonist A61603 and the beta-selective agonist isoproterenol led to increases in Ca(2+) influx from the extracellular compartment relative to stimulation with A61603 alone, with no effect on the associated transient release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. This effect became more evident upon examination of an alpha(1A)-AR variant exhibiting a partial defect in coupling to G(q), and we attribute it to potentiation of a non G(q)-pathway, uncovered by application of a combination of xestospongin C, an endoplasmic reticulum inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor blocker, and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, a nonselective storeoperated Ca(2+) entry channel blocker. We also found that stimulation with A61603 of a second alpha(1A)-AR variant entirely unable to signal induced no Ca(2+) unless beta(2)-AR was concomitantly activated. These results may be accounted for by the presence of alpha(1A)/beta(2)-AR heterodimers or alternatively by specific adrenoceptor signal cross-talk resulting in distinct pharmacological behavior. Finally, our findings provide a new conceptual framework to rationalize outcomes from clinical studies targeting alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "153": "A high through-put, sensitive, and enantioselective LC-MS/MS-based bioanalytical method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of individual acebutolol (AC) and its active metabolite-diacetolol (DC) enantiomers in human plasma using cellobiohydrolase (CBH) chiral stationary phases (CSP). Systematic optimization of chromatographic conditions including organic content, buffer concentration, and pH of mobile phases was conducted to improve the through-put for the direct separation of both AC and DC on CBH column during method development. Complete baseline separation of enantiomeric AC and DC was achieved within 1.5 min with a LC flow rate of 0.9 ml/min under method validation conditions. To further improve the assay through-put, supported liquid extraction (SLE) in a 96-well plate format was used for sample extraction.

    "164": "Some mammals, including laboratory mice, enter torpor in response to food deprivation, and leptin can attenuate these bouts of torpor. We previously showed that dopamine beta-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -/-) mice, which lack norepinephrine (NE), do not reduce circulating leptin upon fasting nor do they enter torpor. To test whether the onset of torpor in mice during a fast requires a NE-mediated reduction in circulating leptin, double mutant mice deficient in both leptin (ob/ob) and DBH (DBL MUT) were generated. Upon fasting, control and ob/ob mice entered torpor as assessed by telemetric core T(b) acquisition. While fasting failed to induce torpor in Dbh -/- mice, leptin deficiency bypassed the requirement for NE, as DBL MUT mice readily entered torpor upon fasting. These data indicate that sympathetic activation of white fat and suppression of leptin is required for the onset of torpor in the mouse. Emergence from torpor was severely retarded in DBL MUT mice, revealing a novel, leptin-independent role for NE in torpor recovery. This phenotype was mimicked by administration of a beta(3) adrenergic receptor antagonist to control mice during a torpor bout. Hence, NE signaling via beta(3) adrenergic receptors presumably in brown fat is the first neurotransmitter-receptor system identified that is required for normal recovery from torpor.",

    "169": "In this work, different modifications of photo-cross-linked poly(propylene fumarate)/poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone) (PPF/PNVP) matrices were studied for their effect on the release kinetics of two ophthalmic drugs. The hydrophilicity of solid PPF/PNVP matrices loaded with acetazolamide (AZ) or timolol maleate (TM) was increased by adding various amounts of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or by increasing the amount of N-vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP) in the polymer mixture prior to cross-linking. The in vitro release studies that utilized high-performance liquid chromatography for quantification revealed highly accelerated drug release from the matrices with increasing contents of the hydrophilic modifier. AZ was released from matrices containing 5% PEG in 56 days, which equals approximately 25% of the release period found for the unmodified matrices. A comparable acceleration in drug release was found for TM-loaded samples modified with 5% PEG. These studies further revealed that 1% PEG is sufficient to shorten the TM release duration by one-third. A significant acceleration in drug release was also found for the samples that were fabricated from a PPF-NVP mixture with increased NVP content. Matrix water content and erosion were assessed gravimetrically. Micro-computed tomography was used to image structural changes of the release systems and shed light on the drug-release mechanism. This study showed that hydrophilic matrix modifications of PPF/PNVP matrices accelerate the drug release of two ophthalmic drugs and represent a suitable tool to adjust drug-release rates from PPF-based matrices for different therapeutic needs.",

The study included 34 patients (28 males and 6 females) aged 59. 7+/-1.5 years, surged with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Low cardiac output was detected in all cases in the post-CPB period. Inotropic support with dopamine and/or dobutamine was effective in 47% of the patients (Group 1) and ineffective in 53% (Group 2). There were no statistically significant differences in cardiac index and pulmonary wedge pressure between the groups. Group 1 patients had ultrasound signs of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (low left ventricular ejection fraction and larger left ventricular systolic and diastolic areas in the transgastric position). Group 2 patients had ultrasound signs of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (high left ventricular ejection fraction and smaller left ventricular systolic and diastolic areas). beta-blockers were used in 10 patients from Group 2. Central hemodynamics and left ventricular function normalized in all these cases. It is concluded that it is possible to recognize left ventricular dysfunctions in low cardiac output after aortic valve replacement with transesophageal echocardiography. Inotropic support is effective in only patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Patients with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction should receive beta-blockers.",

A large proportion of individuals at high 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event live in low-income and middle-income countries, and the large majority of all cardiovascular events occur in developing countries. A large amount of evidence supports the use of pharmacological treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular death in this population, including antiplatelet drugs, beta blockers, lipid-lowering agents and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors. However, the efficacy of cardiovascular prevention is hampered by several problems, including inadequate prescription of medication, poor adherence to treatment, limited availability of medications and unaffordable cost of treatment. Here we examine the use of fixed-dose combination therapy (a 'polypill'), and how this therapy could improve adherence to treatment, reduce the cost and improve treatment affordability in low-income countries.",

The peptide betaARKct, which can inhibit the activation of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 and improve betaAR signaling, has been shown in transgenic models and short-term gene transfer experiments to rescue heart failure (HF). This study was designed to evaluate long-term betaARKct expression in HF with the use of stable myocardial gene delivery with adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6).",

We also treated groups with concurrent administration of the beta-blocker metoprolol. We found robust and long-term transgene expression in the left ventricle at least 12 weeks after delivery. betaARKct significantly improved cardiac contractility and reversed left ventricular remodeling, which was accompanied by a normalization of the neurohormonal (catecholamines and aldosterone) status of the chronic HF animals, including normalization of cardiac betaAR signaling. Addition of metoprolol neither enhanced nor decreased betaARKct-mediated beneficial effects, although metoprolol alone, despite not improving contractility, prevented further deterioration of the left ventricle.",

The stability of two tablet and packaging types was compared by HPLC analysis after 0, 1, 3 and 4.5 months and expressed as the content of intact amlodipine and atenolol. The content of atenolol did not decline regardless of tablet and packaging type. Amlodipine content in bi-layer tablets decreased to about 95 and 88% when packed in strips and blisters, respectively.

It may cause syncope, convulsions, and sudden death during physical activity or emotional distress. We report the clinical features, treatment, and follow-up of 16 children with this diagnosis, emphasizing the potentially fatal nature of the disease.The mean age of patients at the onset of symptoms and at the time of diagnosis was 7.8 plus or minus 2.5 years, and 10.6 plus or minus 3.5 years, respectively. Syncope was the main complaint in 11, and 7 were treated as erroneously as having epilepsy. Diagnosis was confirmed by exercise and/or infusion of isoproterenol. Once the diagnosis was made, we started propranolol in all patients, and added verapamil if ventricular tachycardia was still inducible on a treadmill exercise test. An intracardiac defibrillator was implanted in 4 patients. Of the 16 patients, 4 died suddenly, giving a rate of mortality of 25%. In 2 of those dying suddenly, there was evidence of poor compliance to the recommended treatment. Another 2 patients had been resuscitated because of sudden cardiac arrest.Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia must be considered in the differential diagnosis of syncope in children without heart disease but with a normal QT interval. Medical treatment with propranolol and verapamil may decrease the incidence of arrhythmia. Implantation of intracardiac defibrillators should be considered in those resistant to drug therapy. Delay in diagnosis, and inadequate treatment, can result in sudden cardiac death.", 
    "181": "Approximately 2.5% of the patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery suffer from perioperative cardiac complications. These are associated with a mortality of 20.60%, a longer stay in hospital and higher costs. The risk factors for perioperative cardiac complications are: high-risk surgery, ischaemic heart disease, a history of congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, and renal failure. Recently, the scope of medical management has shifted from assessing and treating underlying culprit coronary lesions toward coronary plaque stabilisation and prevention of myocardial oxygen supply demand mismatch. Currently, the prevention of cardiac problems consists of identification of the patients at risk, optimisation of the preoperatieve condition by modification of underlying risk factors, optimisation of the perioperative medication with adrenergic beta-antagonists, statins, and acetylsalicylic acid, adequate perioperative monitoring and measures to prevent myocardial ischaemia. These include adequate sedation and analgesia, adequate oxygenation, oxygen transport, and ventilation, and if necessary additional cardiac medication.", 
    "182": "Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of death after noncardiac surgery. Preoperative identification of patients with underlying coronary artery disease is important, and appropriate treatment strategies should be implemented in these patients in order to reduce the risk of perioperative complications. Based on recent findings, preoperative risk stratification models have been developed to identify high-, intermediate- or low-risk patients; the concentration of natriuretic peptides is a promising new preoperative risk marker. beta-blockers considerably reduce this risk. In clinical practice, important factors are adequate beta-blocker dosage, tight perioperative heart-rate control and continuation of beta-blockers after discharge. Recently, statins have emerged as drugs with perioperative cardioprotective properties, but more randomized clinical trials are needed before routine administration ofstatins can be recommended. Perioperative medical management should focus on improvements not only in the short-term but also in the long-term.", 
    "183": "The results of the recently published PeriOperative ISchemic Evaluation (POISE) trial show that perioperative use of metoprolol in patients with atherosclerosis undergoing major non-cardiac surgery reduces the risk of cardiovascular complications. This effect was primarily produced by a 1.5% reduction in non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), but this advantage was outweighed by a 0.8% increase in total mortality and a 0.5% increase in nonfatal stroke. These results, combined with previous meta-analyses, confirm that non-fatal MI is reduced at the cost of a statistically significant increase in stroke rate and a near significant increase in mortality. It is likely that the increase in complications is due to a high dose of metoprolol being given too shortly before the operation. These findings call for judicious perioperative use of adrenergic beta-antagonists in cardiac-high-risk patients undergoing high risk non-cardiac surgery. Dosage should be lower and administration should be implemented longer before the operation.", 
    "184": "In a review in this journal, Feringa et al. focused on the prevention of cardiovascular complications after non-cardiac surgery. Beta-blockers and statins appear to be the most effective in reducing post-operative mortality due to cardiac events. We have doubts about the external validity of the studies on cardiovascular risks after non-cardiac surgery. A major limitation is that conclusions for all patients have been drawn from relatively small samples with a selection of high-risk patients. Guidelines based upon such studies are 'premature', possibly dangerous and unethical, since the acceptance of such guidelines would preclude large scale studies to confirm the conclusions of the small studies so far performed. Perioperative beta-blockade is only needed in a subgroup of patients with a high-risk cardiac profile.",

    "188": "Levosimendan is a new cardiac enhancer that exerts positive inotropic effects on the failing heart mediated by calcium sensitization of contractile proteins as well as peripheral vasodilatory effects mediated by opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in vascular smooth-muscle cells. Levosimendan is the most well-studied calcium sensitizer in the real clinical practice, producing greater hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement in patients with acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS) than those with traditional inotropes. Immunomodulatory and anti-apoptotic properties of levosimendan may be an additional biologic mechanism that prevents further cytotoxic and hemodynamic consequences of abnormal immune and neurohormonal responses in AHFS. Recent mortality trials showed that levosimendan does not improve short- and long-term prognosis in AHFS in comparison to dobutamine or placebo. However, in patients with a previous history of CHF and on beta-blocker on admission, levosimendan seems to have a beneficial effect on short-term mortality. According to the recent guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology, levosimendan is indicated in patients with symptomatic low cardiac output HF secondary to cardiac systolic dysfunction without severe hypotension (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B).",

We have previously shown that short lasting increments in extracellular glutamate due to administration of the non-selective glutamate transport blocker l-2,4-trans-pyrrolidine-dicarboxylate (PDC) by microdialysis in the rat spinal cord do not induce motoneuron damage. In the present work we examined the potential involvement of chronic glutamate transport blockade as a causative factor of spinal motoneuron death and paralysis in vivo. Using osmotic minipumps, we infused directly in the spinal cord for up to 10 days PDC and another glutamate transport blocker, dl-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA), and we measured by means of microdialysis and HPLC the extracellular concentration of glutamate and other amino acids. We found that after the infusion of both PDC and TBOA the concentration of endogenous extracellular glutamate was 3-4-fold higher than that of the controls. Nevertheless, in spite of this elevation no motoneuron degeneration or gliosis were observed, assessed by histological examination and choline acetyltransferase and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunocytochemistry. In accord with this lack of toxic effect, no motor deficits, assessed by three motor activity tests, were observed. Because we had previously shown that under identical experimental conditions the infusion of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) induced progressive motoneuron death and paralysis, we conclude that prolonged elevation of extracellular glutamate due to its transport blockade in vivo is innocuous for spinal motoneurons and therefore that these results do not support the hypothesis that glutamate transport deficiency plays a crucial role as a causal factor of spinal motoneuron degeneration in ALS.",

Our protocol called for oral metoprolol 100 mg to be given 60 min before scanning, with patients for whom beta-blockers were contraindicated receiving 240 mg oral verapamil. Additional 5 mg intravenous boluses (maximum for both drugs, 15 mg) were given if the heart rate remained >60 bpm prior to scanning. Of 71 patients treated with oral metoprolol, 59 (83%) achieved a rate <or=65 bpm and 46 (65%) achieved a heart rate of <or=60 bpm during the CTCA scan. All four patients receiving verapamil had a poor rate response and had heart rates >70 bpm at the time of scanning. No adverse events resulted from rate control medication. Image quality was closely related to heart rate. Severe motion artefact (Grade 3) occurred in only 0.9% of patients with a rate <or=60 bpm compared with 50% of patients with a rate >70 bpm. In conclusion, the administration of oral metoprolol according to the described protocol is a safe and effective way of reducing heart rate and improving scan quality in the majority of patients undergoing CTCA."
