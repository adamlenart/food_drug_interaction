The aim here was to compare salivary flow rate and composition in man during 1 week of treatment with a non-selective (propranolol 80 mg b.i.d.) and a beta 1-selective (atenolol 50 mg o.d.) antagonist with that of placebo. The randomized, double-blind, cross-over (\"Latin square\") design was used and 42 healthy male volunteers were recruited to the study. The treatment periods were separated by a wash-out period of 2 weeks. Whole saliva was sampled on day 0 (before) and on day 7 during each treatment. The plasma concentration of propranolol and atenolol was determined from blood samples obtained on day 7. Resting saliva was assessed for flow rate, amylase activity and concentration of total protein, hexosamine and sialic acid. Stimulated saliva was assessed for flow rate, pH, buffer pH, amylase activity and concentration of total protein, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Cl- and PO4(2-). In resting as well as stimulated whole saliva both the total protein concentration and the amylase activity were significantly decreased during the active treatment periods (p less than 0.05-p less than 0.001). At lunchtime during atenolol treatment the hexosamine/total protein and the sialic acid/total protein ratios were significantly increased (p less than 0.05-p less than 0.01), suggesting a possible effect on protein synthesis. In addition, the concentrations of Ca2+, PO4(2-), Cl- and Mg2+ were significantly altered during the active treatment periods (p less than 0.05-p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "There is extensive experimental and clinical experience concerning the antiarrhythmic potency of DL-sotalol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist that lengthens the cardiac action potential duration. More recently, its dextrorotatory isomer, D-sotalol, has been evaluated in experimental studies and preliminary clinical trials. Whereas the isomer is almost free of beta-blocking activity, both experimental and clinical data demonstrate that potent class III activity of D-sotalol. Further investigations, particularly in patients with life-threatening arrhythmias, are needed to delineate the clinical usefulness of this compound.", 
    "2": "DL-Sotalol is a unique antiarrhythmic agent combining potent beta-blocking properties with the propensity to prolong cardiac repolarization in all myocardial tissues. Its beta-blocker-associated negative inotropic effects are attenuated by its action potential-lengthening effect. The drug has an elimination half-life of 10-15 h. Sotalol's major electrophysiologic profile constitutes the summed effects of beta-blockade and prolonged repolarization. It exerts a potent antifibrillatory action modulated by its antiadrenergic effects. The effectiveness and tolerance of sotalol in a variety of atrial and ventricular dysrhythmias is reviewed in the present article.", 
    "3": "Serum drug level monitoring facilitates dosage optimization of agents with a narrow therapeutic index. Concentration-dependent antiarrhythmic and toxic effects have been demonstrated for several class I drugs, whereas the concentration-effect relationships of class III antiarrhythmics are less well established. The efficacy and toxicity of amiodarone, in particular, may be determined more by extensive tissue deposition than by its serum concentration. Furthermore, accumulation of the active metabolite desethylamiodarone seems to play an additional role. The antiarrhythmic serum concentration range of sotalol is wide; monitoring is not required. The clinical utility of serum concentration measurements with the newly developed class III antiarrhythmic agents remains to be evaluated in properly planned therapeutic trials in patients with supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "4": "Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are frequent complications of organic heart disease. There is sufficient evidence that serial electrophysiologic testing is able to predict long-term efficacy of antiarrhythmic agents in patients with malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias. This approach has not only been useful for the evaluation of class I drugs, but recent studies have shown that this invasive method may also be useful for the management of patients undergoing treatment with class III antiarrhythmic agents such as amiodarone and sotalol. The results of several studies suggest that class III agents are more effective than class I drugs in patients presenting with ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Proarrhythmic complications in patients treated with class III antiarrhythmic drugs are mainly characterized by torsades de pointes. Their incidence does not exceed 5%. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this type of proarrhythmia. By the use of currently available stimulation techniques, patients who might develop torsades de pointes while on therapy with a class III agent cannot be identified.",

It is unknown whether the presence of an ischemic-like pattern in the electrocardiogram at rest (T-wave inversion) reflects a more severe vasomotion disturbance.

Cold pressor test increased mean blood pressure and rate-pressure product to a similar extent in both groups, increased coronary sinus flow in group 1 (88 +/- 29 to 119 +/- 36 ml/min; p less than 0.05) and not in group 2 (109 +/- 37 vs 104 +/- 36 ml/min; p = not significant), and decreased coronary resistance in group 1 (1.38 +/- 0.42 to 1.19 +/- 0.38 mm Hg/ml/min; p less than 0.05) and augmented it in group 2 (1.06 +/- 0.32 to 1.28 +/- 0.43 mm Hg/ml/min; p less than 0.02).

    "16": "Clones encoding an atypical beta-adrenergic receptor were isolated from a rat brown adipose tissue cDNA library. This receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells displays a low affinity for beta-adrenergic antagonists and a high affinity for BRL 37344, an agonist that selectively stimulates lipolysis in adipose tissue. The rank order of potency for agonist-mediated increases in intracellular cAMP in transfected cells correlates with that for agonist-mediated stimulation of lipolysis in brown adipocytes. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that this receptor subtype is expressed only in brown and white adipose tissue where it represents the predominant beta-receptor subtype. The amount of atypical beta-adrenergic receptor present in adipose tissue of obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats is reduced by up to 71% as compared with lean (Fa/Fa) control animals. These findings suggest that a change in the expression of this beta-adrenergic receptor subtype may play a role in obesity.", 
    "17": "Glucose-induced changes in cytoplasmic pH (pHi) were investigated using pancreatic beta-cells isolated from obese hyperglycemic mice. Glucose, at concentrations above 3-5 mM, depolarized the beta-cell and increased pHi, cytoplasmic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), and insulin release. This increase in pHi was dependent on the presence of extracellular Na+ and was inhibited by 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride, a blocker of Na+/H+ exchange. Stimulation of protein kinase C with phorbol ester also induced an alkalinization. However, when protein kinase C activity was down-regulated, glucose stimulation still induced alkalinization. At 20 mM glucose, 10 mM NH4Cl induced a marked rise in pHi, paralleled by repolarization, inhibition of electrical activity, and decreases in both [Ca2+]i and insulin release. Reduction in [Ca2+]i was prevented by 200 microM tolbutamide, but not by 10 mM tetraethylammonium. At 4 mM glucose, NH4Cl induced a transient increase in insulin release, without changing [Ca2+]i. Exposure of beta-cells to 10 mM sodium acetate caused a persistent decrease in pHi, an effect paralleled by a small transient increase in [Ca2+]i. Acidification per se did not change the beta-cell sensitivity to glucose, not excluding that the activity of the ATP-regulated K+ channels may be modulated by changes in pHi.", 
    "18": "Aging has been associated with changes in beta-adrenoceptor responses and adaptation to prolonged removal of catecholamine stimulation. We have examined the effect of chronic propranolol administration on rat hepatic membrane beta-adrenoceptor density, agonist affinity and response in young (6-7 months) and old (26-7 months) male Wistar rats. Propranolol administration via miniosmotic pumps for 7 days resulted in similar and sustained plasma propranolol levels (approximately 100 ng/ml) in old and young rats. Pretreatment beta-adrenoceptor responses to isoprenaline were significantly higher in old rats. Propranolol administration was associated with significant increases in beta-adrenoceptor response and density (Bmax) in young rats only. Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) responses to prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), guanosine triphosphate (GTP), 5'-guanyl-imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), forskolin and Mn2+ were not significantly different between young and old rats and were not affected by propranolol administration. Neither aging or propranolol administration was associated with a change in beta-adrenoceptor agonist affinity. These findings demonstrate elevated hepatic beta-adrenoceptor response and impaired hepatic beta-adrenoceptor adaptation to beta-adrenoceptor blockade in aging rats.",

    "20": "Sympathetic regulation of myocardial performance has been shown to be altered in congestive heart failure. Right atrial tissue of children with severe acyanotic and cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) showed a significantly lower beta-receptor density than that of children with less severe defects. Since mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) contain a homogeneous population of beta 2-adrenoceptors which have similar properties to those of cardiac beta 2-adrenoceptors, they are frequently used for studying the beta-adrenergic system. In a group of 37 children with CHD of different types and severity who underwent cardiac surgery, we compared the MNL beta-adrenoceptor density to the type and severity of CHD and looked for a possible relationship to plasma catecholamine levels and to the right atrial beta-adrenoceptor density. Membranes of MNL and myocardial cells were radiolabeled with (-)3-[125I]Iodocyanopindolol [( 125I]ICYP). A significantly higher beta-adrenoceptor density on MNL was found in patients with moderate acyanotic CHD (group I) than in those with severe acyanotic (group II) and cyanotic CHD (group III). Patients of group I showed approximately 50% higher myocardial beta-receptor density than those of groups II and III. ICI 118.551-[125I]ICYP competition studies revealed that in groups II and III significantly lower proportions and densities of beta 1-receptors were found compared to group I. Noradrenaline (NA) plasma levels in group II and group III were significantly higher than those in group I. The adrenaline plasma levels were found to be very high in all children with CHD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "Addition of dantrolene 8.5 x 10(-5) M caused a mono-exponential decay of the depolarization contractures caused by inhibition of the sarcolemmal Na,K-ATPase with propranolol 1 mM or by depolarization of the sarcolemma and T tubular membranes with KCl 100 mM. The half-times of the inhibitory effects were 6 s for the propranolol contracture and 11 s for the KCl contracture. The inhibition of both contractures was complete. Inhibition of the caffeine (10 mM) contracture was bi-exponential with half-times of 45 s and 9.5 min. Inhibition was incomplete; 29.6 +/- 5.0% of the contracture tension could not be inhibited. The inhibition of twitch contractions was similar to that of the caffeine contracture, with half-times of 48 s and 9.1 min, and 20.6 +/- 1.2% of the initial twitch tension could not be inhibited. The contracture tensions induced by release of Ca from the mitochondria with dicumarol, and by actin-myosin binding with the sulfhydryl inhibitor, N-ethyl-maleimide, could not be inhibited by dantrolene. The present results indicate that dantrolene inhibits depolarization signals from the sarcolemma and the T tubular membranes, in addition to inhibition of the coupling between the T tubules and the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and of the release of Ca from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. All these effects of dantrolene may contribute to its therapeutic effect in malignant hyperthermia.", 
    "22": "Three aromatic amino acids, Tyr92, Trp148 and Tyr187 belonging to three separate domains of the alpha 7-subunit of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor were mutated to phenylalanine, and the electrophysiological response of the resulting mutant receptors analyzed in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. All mutations significantly decreased the apparent affinities for acetylcholine and nicotine, and to a lesser extent, those for the competitive antagonists dihydro-beta-erythroidine and alpha-bungarotoxin. Other properties investigated, such as the voltage dependency of the ion response as well as its sensitivity to the open channel blocker QX222, were not significantly changed, indicating that the mutations affected selectively the recognition of cholinergic ligands by the receptor protein. The maximal rates for the rapid desensitization process were slightly modified, suggesting that the contribution of Tyr92, Trp148 and Tyr187 to the binding area might differ in the various conformations of the nicotinic receptor. Other mutations at nearby positions (S94N, W153F, G151D and G82E) did not affect the properties of the electrophysiological response. These data point to the functional significance of Tyr92, Trp148 and Tyr187 in the binding of cholinergic ligands and ion channel activation of the nicotinic receptor, thus supporting a multiple loop model [(1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10430-10437] for the ligand binding area.", 
    "23": "The effects of repetitive electrical stimulation of a lumbar sympathetic trunk (LST) for 30 s at various frequencies and supramaximum intensity on the nerve blood flow in a sciatic nerve were studied by laser Doppler flowmetry in anesthetized Fischer-344 male rats. The response was biphasic; i.e. an initial increase and then a decrease. The maximum mean increase after 2 Hz stimulation was 22 +/- 8%, while the maximum mean decrease after 20-50 Hz stimulation was 79 +/- 3%, of the prestimulus control level. The initial increase, which was greater at lower frequencies and existed even after local sympathetic denervation, was passive, and was caused by the systemic pressor response to LST stimulation. The decrease, which was nearly abolished by an i.v. alpha-adrenergic blocker, phentolamine (10 mg/kg), resulted from vasoconstriction in the vasa nervorum, mainly via activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "24": "The development of atheromatous wall changes and local thrombotic complications in coronary arteries may be influenced by drug treatment. Calcium antagonists appear to reduce the progression of minimal coronary lesions only, while lipid lowering agents (colestipol, niacin, fibrates and HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors) can retard the progression of established stenotic lesions or even produce a slight regression in 20-30% of patients within two to four years. In acute stages of coronary artery disease, however, treatment with platelet inhibitors, anti-coagulants and betablockers is required to prevent life-threatening complications. Hence the optimum strategy for secondary prevention in coronary artery disease depends on the clinical presentation in individual patients.",

The ultrafiltrate was analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography with fluorimetric detection. The consistency of the recoveries obtained eliminated the need for an internal standard (coefficients of variation less than 4%).

The separation of the diastereomeric derivatives was performed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Fluorimetric detection (lambda excitation = 220 nm, lambda emission = 320 nm) allows the quantification of tertatolol enantiomers down to 6 ng/ml. The assay was used to study the pharmacokinetic profile of tertatolol enantiomers following oral administration of racemic tertatolol; preliminary results suggest enantioselective absorption and/or disposition of tertatolol.", 
    "28": "Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity was measured in the oviduct of normal rats in diestrous and in rats ovariectomized (OVX) seven days before. OVX induced a significant decrease of GAD activity in the Fallopian tube. This effect was completely reversed by coadministration of estradiol benzoate + progesterone (E + P). Simultaneous injection of atropine, but not of alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine or labetalol, completely prevented the activation of GAD induced by ovarian sterois. Moreover, prostigmin significantly potentiated the action of E + P on GAD activity in the rat oviduct. These data clearly suggest the participation of acetylcholine in the mechanisms whereby ovarian steroids regulate GAD activity in the rat Fallopian tube.", 
    "29": "Proton transport pathways in isolated superfused rabbit cortical connecting (CNT) and collecting tubules (CCD) were determined using the fluorescent pH-sensitive dye BCECF following acid or base load by exposure to NH4Cl. Following removal of NH4Cl which results in a rapid decline in pHi two mechanisms appear to be responsible for pHi recovery, a Na-independent NEM-sensitive H efflux with a slow activity, which was virtually absent in 30% of the segments tested and a second rapid Na-dependent H efflux. In CCD this latter pathway was shown to have an apparent Km for (Na+)e of 38.2 +/- 0.4 mM (S.D., n = 7) and was sensitive to EIPA. Similar results were obtained with the CNT. With regard to the H pump in six out of ten CCD isoproterenol (200 nM) resulted in a 2-fold stimulation of H pump activity. These effects of isoprenaline were inhibited both by the non-specific beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol as well as by the specific b1 antagonist metoprolol. Interestingly, these stimulatory effects of this beta agonist, which is known to stimulate cAMP formation in rabbit CCD, were not reproduced by the addition of exogenous cAMP analogues db cAMP (0.1 mM), CPT cAMP (0.1 mM), 8 Br-cAMP (0.1 mM) or the addition of forskolin (0.3 mM). In conclusion, these data obtained in isolated rabbit CNT and CCT demonstrate the presence of an active Na-H exchange which is for the most part responsible for the recovery of pHi. It should be noted also that the contribution of the H pump to pHi regulation appears to be negligible in these segments.", 
    "30": "Previous studies have shown that urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG) is elevated in patients with hypertension, even without renal disease. To elucidate the value of measuring NAG, both in urine and serum of hypertensive patients, we measured NAG activity in the serum, plasma, and 24-hour urine by the fluorimetric method in 84 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension before and after 6 months of effective treatment. NAG activities of these hypertensive patients were compared with those of 102 healthy normotensive subjects and 97 patients with various renal diseases and controlled hypertension. Serum NAG activity was clearly greater in patients with essential hypertension (427 +/- 124 U/mL) than in normotensive subjects (380 +/- 109 U/mL) or patients with renal disorders (393 +/- 115 U/mL) (P less than or equal to 0.004). The greater was the diastolic pressure in the hypertensive group, the greater was serum NAG activity (r = +0.30, P = 0.004). Hypertensive patients with high serum NAG activity were further characterized by a more exaggerated increase in systolic pressure (34 +/- 16 v 25 +/- 15 mm Hg, P = 0.051) and total peripheral resistance (19% +/- 18% v 12% +/- 13%, P = 0.042) in response to the cold pressor test and by a greater increase in systolic pressure (56 +/- 15 v 45 +/- 13 mm Hg, P = 0.009) and diastolic pressure (11 +/- 7 v 6 +/- 9, P = 0.043) in response to bicycle exercise testing than the group with low serum NAG activity. In contrast, urinary NAG activity tended to be only slightly higher in patients with essential hypertension than in the normotensive control group (33 +/- 31 v 23 +/- 29 U/mg creatinine [cr], P = 0.062), whereas patients with renal diseases had clearly increased urinary NAG activity (87 +/- 105 U/mg cr) (P less than 0.001). Following effective antihypertensive therapy, serum NAG activity decreased in patients with essential hypertension to values of normotensive control subjects (from 427 +/- 124 U/mL to 386 +/- 106 U/mL, P less than 0.01). A significant decrease in serum NAG activity was observed in patients with both initially high as well as low pretreatment serum NAG activities (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.02, respectively). Urinary NAG activity overall was unchanged by antihypertensive treatment. We conclude that in patients with mild essential hypertension, serum NAG activity was already elevated (whereas urinary NAG activity was not) and was normalized by effective antihypertensive treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Among 819 cirrhotic patients who never had experienced variceal bleeding, esophagoscopy revealed varices in 379, of whom 286 were enrolled in the trial; 73 were allocated to sclerotherapy (paravenous polidocanol [10 mg/ml] every 1 to 2 wk until eradication), 68 to propranolol (slow-release preparation in one daily dose adjusted to provide about 25% heart rate reduction), 73 to both treatments and 72 to neither of the two treatments. The patients were observed for up to 42 mo, with an average of 15 mo. After variceal bleeding, patients in all groups received sclerotherapy only. The incidences of variceal bleeding (n = 50) were almost identical in the four groups. The relative risk (with 95% confidence limits) with sclerotherapy was 1.06 (0.61 to 1.84), and the relative risk with propranolol was 0.92 (0.53 to 1.60). The mortality rate after variceal bleeding (n = 29) did not differ significantly either.

    "37": "We hypothesized that beta-adrenergic receptor blockade would result in an increase in serum potassium concentration in hypothermic rats given a potassium load compared to non-beta-blocked, hypothermic, potassium-loaded rats. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the interaction between body temperature and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade on serum potassium concentrations in ureter-ligated rats with and without potassium loading. To achieve this goal, we performed three experiments. In the first experiment, serum potassium concentrations were determined in 16 rats as they were continuously cooled from 37 degrees C to 22 degrees C. In the second experiment, 12 ureter-ligated rats were cooled to 31 degrees C, after which they were rewarmed to 37 degrees C. Serum potassium concentrations were determined before and after cooling and on rewarming. Twelve other ureter-ligated rats were cooled to 31 degrees C, then given a potassium load until their serum potassium concentrations returned to their baseline values, after which they were rewarmed to 37 degrees C. Serum potassium concentrations were determined before and after cooling, during the potassium infusion, and on rewarming. In the third experiment, 14 rats were pretreated with propranolol and 14 rats served as controls. Half of the rats in each of these two groups were kept at 37 degrees C and half were cooled to 25 degrees C. All rats were then given a 690-mumol potassium chloride infusion.

The hypothermic hypokalemic rats that had their serum potassium concentrations corrected to normothermic status (2.93 +/- 0.17 mmol/L) had marked increases in serum potassium concentrations (4.22 +/- 0.15 mmol/L) on rewarming. In the normothermic rats, potassium loading after beta-adrenergic receptor blockade resulted in even higher serum potassium concentrations (5.65 +/- 0.36 mmol/L) compared with non-beta-blocked rats given equal potassium loads (4.6 +/- 0.4 mmol/L). However, in hypothermic (25 degrees C) rats given the same potassium load, there was no difference in serum potassium concentrations in beta-blocked (6.5 +/- 0.35 mmol/L) and non-beta-blocked rats (6.63 +/- 0.3 mmol/L).",

Supplementation of potassium during hypothermia can cause a significant increase in serum potassium concentration on rewarming. Blocking beta-adrenergic receptors with propranolol did not effect hypothermia-induced hypokalemia, suggesting that the beta-adrenergic mechanism may not be functional in hypothermia.", 
    "40": "Although the benefit of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in acute coronary ischemia has been well documented, it is unclear whether the responsible mechanisms include the modification of platelet function. In recent studies, metoprolol appeared to reduce the total number and duration of episodes of silent ischemia in patients with stable coronary artery disease throughout the day. This effect was not associated with a change in baseline or circadian variability of the platelet aggregability. Since the treatment caused significant decreases in heart rate and blood pressure, the drug effect is more likely to be based on reduction of myocardial oxygen demand. Metoprolol, however, prevented a platelet aggregability increase and intracellular cAMP decrease during exercise stress testing in patients with stable angina pectoris. We speculate that this effect of beta 1-adrenergic blockade may be due to hemodynamic and neurohormonal changes, or possibly also to an increase in synthesis or release of platelet inhibiting substances.",

The placebo arm of the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT) provides a unique opportunity to compare the long-term cardiac events in patients suffering from their first and uncomplicated Q wave or non-Q wave AMI. Of a total 3837 patients enrolled in the BHAT, 3375 were classifiable in terms of appearance or absence of Q waves during the prerandomization period. Of these, 1444 patients with their first AMI were randomized to placebo. Of these, 1186 experienced a Q wave AMI; the remaining 258 suffered a non-Q wave AMI. At 36 months of follow-up, the mortality was 8.4% in the Q wave AMI group and 7.4% in the non-Q wave AMI group. Sudden death was 5.4% in the Q wave AMI group and 4.7% in the non-Q wave AMI group. The reinfarction rate was 5.5% in the Q wave AMI patients and 7.4% in the non-Q wave AMI patients. More patients developed angina (44.6%) in the non-Q wave AMI group compared with 35.2% in the Q wave AMI group. Despite similar long-term cardiac event rates within the two groups, the 1-year mortality rate for patients with Q wave AMI appeared higher than in the non-Q wave AMI group, 5.2% versus 3.1%, respectively. In contrast, the rate of reinfarction appeared higher at the 12-month follow-up period in the non-Q wave AMI group, 4.7% versus 3.4%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)c",

The LV mass index (LVMI) decreased by an average of 21 g/M2, but no significant correlation between blood pressure reduction and decrease in LVMI was found. So there may be some direct effect of these antihypertensive agents on the myocardium in addition to the benefit from blood pressure reduction. Marked reduction in PVA, Ai, A/E and Ai/T-VTi (P less than 0.01) along with elevation in ratio of E/A, Ei/Ai and Ei/T-VTi (P less than 0.01) were also observed by Doppler transmitral filling studies.

During a salt balance study, high salt intake (20 g/day) significantly increased the circulating level of C16PAF, and changes in circulating C16PAF significantly and positively correlated with changes in mean arterial blood pressure (r = 0.47, p less than 0.05). Changes in C16PAF also correlated with changes in creatinine clearance (r = 0.55, p less than 0.05), but did not correlate with changes in plasma sodium concentration, plasma chloride concentration and plasma volume.

There was a significant reduction in mean arterial pressure after chlorthalidone and metoprolol treatments. This effect was more pronounced with the chlorthalidone/metoprolol combination (logroton). There were no significant changes in mean ANF levels after any drug regimen, although a tendency to increase was observed after six weeks of treatment with metoprolol. Both chlorthalidone and metoprolol as monotherapy increased the total triglycerides. This effect was less pronounced with logroton. During metoprolol treatment, HDL cholesterol decreased significantly, whereas VLDL-C increased. When combined drug therapy was administered, the unfavorable effects on HDL-C were partially blunted and VLDL-C returned to baseline. LDL-cholesterol did not change significantly during any drug regimen nor did the ratio of LDL-C/HDL-C. Logroton significantly increased the VLDL apo B levels in patients who had received chlorthalidone as monotherapy but had no effect in patients already treated with metoprolol. Neither treatment had a significant influence on the ratio of LDL-C/B. There were no serious adverse events reported throughout the study.

The left ventricular mass and function were evaluated by Doppler echocardiography and all recordings were interpreted \"blind\" at the end of the study by two operators. Treatment led to a significant reduction of the blood pressure (152 +/- 12/94 +/- 11 versus 166 +/- 18/100 +/- 9 mmHg) and of the heart rate (60 +/- 10 versus 76 +/- 12 beats per minute). The left ventricular mass index decreased by 8% (p less than 0.001) due to reduction in wall thickness. Resting left ventricular systolic function was unchanged. Left ventricular filling patterns improved with an increase in the E/A ratio which was reduced at the beginning of the trial.",

Atenolol (50 mg/kg/day) and bunazosin (5 mg/kg/day) were administered to SHR from 19 to 26 weeks of age, whereas tap water was given to control SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Both atenolol and bunazosin significantly decreased arterial blood pressure and significantly decelerated the increase in left ventricular weight in SHR. At the end of the long-term treatment, hearts were removed and perfused by the working heart technique for 15 min, and then global ischemia was induced for either 10 or 30 min. The ischemic heart was reperfused for 30 min. The pressure-rate product and the extent of recovery of the coronary flow after reperfusion following 30 min of ischemia in the bunazosin-treated SHR were significantly higher than those in the control SHR and the atenolol-treated SHR. The levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), creatine phosphate (CrP), and energy charge potential in the SHR heart reperfused after 30 min of ischemia were significantly lower than those in the reperfused WKY. Both atenolol and bunazosin improved the restoration of ATP and CrP in SHR after reperfusion following 30 min of ischemia. In conclusion, antihypertensive therapy with either atenolol or bunazosin was effective in preventing cardiac hypertrophy and ischemic damage caused by different mechanisms. Factors resulting from stimulation of the cardiac alpha 1 adrenoceptor may play an important role in the development of hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy, just as factors resulting from stimulation of the beta 1-adrenoceptor do.", 
    "51": "To date, there have been at least eight different receptors for the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) identified in the central nervous system. These receptors fall into four pharmacological classes: 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT3 and 5-HT4. The 5-HT1 class has been shown to contain at least four pharmacologically distinct subtypes, 5-HT1A-D. Of these, cDNAs encoding the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1C receptors have been previously characterized. We now report the cloning and expression of a rat brain cDNA encoding another member of the 5-HT1 receptor family. Transient expression of this clone demonstrated high-affinity binding of [3H]5-HT with a pharmacological profile corresponding to that of the 5-HT1B subtype: 5-CT, 5-HT greater than propranolol greater than methysergide greater than rauwolscine greater than 8-OH-DPAT. In situ hybridization revealed expression of cognate mRNA within cells of the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, consistent with previous reports that the 5-HT1B receptor acts as an autoreceptor on 5-HT terminals in this species. mRNA expression was also detected in cells within the CA1 region of hippocampus, striatum, layer 4 of cortex and in the cerebellum, suggesting a previously unrecognized post-synaptic role for the 5-HT1B receptor.",

At 24 weeks of age, 24-hour blood pressure was measured, and two mesenteric resistance vessels were taken from each animal. Blood pressure was 227/135 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) and 161/106 mm Hg in untreated hypertensive and normotensive control rats, respectively. Heart rates were 376 min-1 and 295 min-1 for the two strains. All treatments reduced all blood pressure parameters except for metoprolol, which did not reduce pulse pressure. In the small arteries, the media cross-sectional area was unaffected by the treatments. When a simple correlation analysis was made, pulse pressure was found to correlate more closely (r = 0.64, p less than 0.001) to the resistance vessel media/lumen ratio than any of the other pressure parameters studied: systolic (r = 0.51, p = 0.011), mean (r = 0.41, p = 0.05), or diastolic (r = 0.28, p = 0.19). When an analysis of covariance was performed that included pulse pressure, mean blood pressure, and heart rate, which also correlated significantly to the media/lumen ratio, 81% of the variation in the media/lumen ratio could be accounted for by the variation in the three covariates (p less than 10(-5)), pulse pressure being the major factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Pleurisy was induced by injection of a 2% zymosan suspension into the pleural cavity of rats. The time course of pleural exudate accumulation, the exudation rate, and exudate leukocyte numbers were followed then for 96 hr. Peak pleural exudate accumulation was about 3 mL at 24 hr, whereas the exudation rate increased biphasically with peaks at 0.5 hr and 5 hr. The migration of leukocytes into the pleural cavity increased with time up to 48 hr. The polymorphonuclear leukocytes were the dominant white cells in the exudate between 5 and 16 hr, but mononuclear leukocytes started to outnumber them around 24 hr. Pretreatment with cyproheptadine (5 mg/kg), an inhibitor of both histamine and serotonin, significantly suppressed pleural fluid accumulation and the exudation rate at 0.5 hr. The PAF antagonist CV-6209 (1 mg/kg) significantly suppressed pleural fluid accumulation and the exudation rate at both 0.5 and 5 hr. At either time point, the parameters were not suppressed by indomethacin. We detected PAF activity in the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fraction (with a retention time corresponding to that of authentic PAF) of the exudates at 0.5 hr, 5 hr, and 16 hr using an aggregation bioassay with washed rabbit platelets. The results suggest that in zymosan-induced rat pleurisy, histamine and/or serotonin are the main mediators of exudation at 0.5 hr and that PAF may be partly responsible for exudation at 0.5 hr and later at 5 hr to 16 hr.",

When SM-10661 was administered intravenously 2 min before ovalbumin challenge, bronchoconstriction was inhibited dose-dependently with an ID50 of 68 mg/kg. In guinea pigs pretreated with 15 micrograms/kg mepyramine which is a suboptimal dose, antigen-induced bronchoconstriction peaked at 4-6 min, but was inhibited by SM-10661 with an ID50 of 21 mg/kg. When guinea pigs were pretreated intravenously with 2.5 mg/kg mepyramine, 1 mg/kg indomethacin and 0.01 mg/kg propranolol, the antigen-induced bronchoconstriction peaked at 6 min. SM-10661 inhibited the response with an ID50 of 45 mg/kg. Histamine- and leukotriene D4-induced bronchoconstrictions were unaffected by up to 100 mg/kg SM-10661. Ovalbumin challenge of minced lungs from passively sensitized guinea pigs triggered the release of leukotrienes and histamine. SM-10661 had no effect on the antigen-induced release of peptide leukotrienes or histamine up to 10(-4) M.

Four PDE were performed in each patient: at baseline, before gallopamil and atenolol IV bolus, and a 15 min after each bolus. The following Doppler parameters were calculated: early (E) and late (A) peak filling velocities and their ratios (E/A), early (Ei), late (Ai) and total (TVi) diastolic filling time velocity integrals; the ratio between Ei and Ai (Ei/Ai), the peak filling rate normalized to mitral stroke volume (calculated as E/TVi [nPRP]), the percentage of atrial contribution to total diastolic filling (%AC), and the isovolumic relaxation time (nTRIV) normalized to an 800msec RR cycle length.

The changes of ECG (leads I, II and III) were recorded for 10 min following collagen injection. KW-3635 (25-50 mg/kg p.o.) remarkably improved the collagen-induced ischemic ECG changes. The effect of KW-3635 was more potent than those of daltroban, isbogrel and ticlopidine. Neither nifedipine nor propranolol had any effect. The plasma thromboxane B2 level in the KW-3635-treated animals was lower in comparison with those in both the control and daltroban-treated animals.

It has been reported previously that the milrinone analogues, ethyl 5-cyano-1,6-dihydro-2-methyl-6-oxo-3 pyridine carboxylate (I) and ethyl 5-cyano-1,6-dihydro-2-ethyl-6-oxo-3 pyridine carboxylate (II) exert a positive inotropic effect (EC50 = 15.6 +/- 0.2 microM and 40.3 +/- 0.1 microM) both on spontaneously beating and on electrically driven atria from reserpine-treated guinea-pigs. In the present study the mechanism of the inotropic action of these two agents was investigated. 2. In electrically driven left atrium from reserpine-treated guinea-pigs the EC50 values for inotropic activity for compounds (I) and (II) corresponded to that of milrinone (EC50 = 25 +/- 0.1 microM) but compound (I) induced a greater maximum effect. This corresponded to a percentage increase in developed tension over control of 63 +/- 0.3 whereas the maximum inotropic effect of milrinone was 48 +/- 0.3 and that of compound (II) was 47 +/- 0.2. 3. The inotropic activity of compounds (I) and (II) (10-100 microM) was resistant to propranolol (0.1 microM), thus excluding the involvement of beta-adrenoceptors. 4. Since the inotropism induced by compounds (I) and (II) was not reduced by carbachol (1 nM-0.5 microM), an action involving changes in adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) can be excluded. 5. The inotropic action of compounds (I) and (II) was blocked selectively by 8-phenyltheophyline (10 microM) or adenosine deaminase (2 u ml-1). 6. Both (I) and (II) inhibited, in an apparently competitive manner, the negative inotropic effect induced by N6-(L-phenylisopropyl) adenosine (L-PIA), a stable adenosine agonist. The pA2 values for (I) and (II) were 4.79 and 4.36, respectively.7. In rat brain compounds (I) and (II) inhibited the specific binding of N6-cyclohexyl[3H]-adenosine- ([3H]-CHA) with an IC50 of 0.18 + 0.01 mM and 0.25 + 0.02 mm, respectively, which were similar to their IC50 values for blocking the PIA-induced negative inotropic effect and which are also in the range of concentrations that are effective in inducing positive inotropism in guinea-pig atria.8. The results from the present study suggest that antagonism of endogenous purines causes positive inotropism without affecting intracellular cyclic AMP levels.", 
    "70": "This study demonstrates an experimental model of the biochemical pattern of the 'latent phase' of hepatic porphyria subject to 'acute attack', upon application of prophyrinogenic stimuli. The 'latent phase' was achieved by administering 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1, 4-dihydrocollidine [DDC], 70 mg kg-1 day, orally to non-fasted rats. A two- and threefold increase in coproporphyrin in urine and protoporphyrin in faeces, respectively, were observed. An 'acute attack' was induced by phenobarbitone (PB), 100 mg kg-1, administered on the third day of treatment with DDC, followed by administration of 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide (AIA), 470 mg kg-1, on the fourth day. A fourfold elevation in urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) and delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and further increase of three- and fourfold in urinary coproporphyrin and faecal protoporphyrin, respectively, was observed. The effect of DDC, AIA and PB on the excretion of PBG and porphyrins was found to be synergistic rather than additive. dl-Propranolol, 700 mg kg-1, given to DDC treated rats 'latent phase' reduced the amount of porphyrins excreted in urine and faeces to those observed in control dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) treated rats. It also prevented induction of 'acute attack' caused by the combination of PB and AIA. It is shown that dl-propranolol affects a few parameters in the haem biosynthetic pathway. Its beneficial effect in porphyria is probably the result of increasing the concentration of haem in the free haem pool.", 
    "71": "The aim was to investigate the relationship between vascular aging and endothelial regulation of the vascular tone by various agonists in isolated pig coronary arteries. EXPERIMENTAL MATERIALS AND DESIGN: Coronary artery rings from young (4-6 month old) and aged (3-4 years old) Yorkshire pigs were studied under isometric tension by organ chamber experiments. Cumulative concentration-response curves were obtained for vasorelaxing agents including noradrenaline (with beta blocker), substance P, bradykinin, and glyceryl trinitrate in rings precontracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha). The degree of atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries was examined by light microscopy after the pharmacological experiments.", 
    "72": "In the presence of propranolol (3 x 10(-6)M), noradrenaline (10(-8)-10(-5)M) caused endothelium dependent relaxation. The maximum relaxation was significantly greater in the young [45.4(SEM 2.5)% of the magnitude of precontraction induced by PGF2 alpha] than in the aged group [26.9(3.0)%] (p less than 0.001). However, magnitudes of relaxation to substance P, bradykinin, and glyceryl trinitrate were not significantly different between the young and the aged groups. The alpha 2 antagonist yohimbine (3 x 10(-6)M) inhibited the endothelium dependent relaxation to noradrenaline, but the alpha 1 antagonist prazosin (10(-6)M) failed to inhibit the response. Gossypol (3 x 10(-5)M) and methylene blue (10(-5)M), both inhibitors of endothelium dependent relaxation, abolished alpha 2 adrenoceptor mediated relaxation, but a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10(-5)M) did not affect the response. Histologically almost all young pig coronary arteries were free of atherosclerotic changes, whereas aged arteries had fatty streaks with slightly narrowed lumen in 22 of 38 rings (58%). The remaining aged pig coronary rings were free from atherosclerosis. Comparison of the endothelium dependent relaxation to noradrenaline between the rings with fatty streaks and those without lesions in the aged pigs suggested that the attenuated response was due both to vascular aging and to fatty streak development.", 
    "73": "The endothelium dependent relaxation to noradrenaline via the alpha 2 adrenoceptor was attenuated by vascular aging and also by fatty streak formation in isolated pig coronary arteries. Thus vascular aging may affect the sympathetic regulation of the coronary arterial tone by the attenuation of endothelium dependent relaxation to catecholamines via alpha 2 adrenoceptors.", 
    "74": "Increased plasma concentrations of catecholamines are assumed to be responsible for the decreased sensitivity to catecholamines of the failing heart. We investigated in rat heart the influence of a 4-day infusion of isoprenaline (Iso; 2.4 mg.kg-1.d-1), propranolol (Prop; 9.9 mg.kg-1.d-1), Iso + Prop or 0.9% NaCl as control (Ctr) on myocardial Gi-mRNA and Gi-protein levels and on the negative inotropic effect of carbachol in papillary muscles. In Iso-treated rats, hybridization experiments with 32P-cDNAs revealed a 49 +/- 18% (n = 7-8) and 27 +/- 7% (n = 8) increase in Gi alpha-2- and Gi alpha-3-mRNA respectively, and pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation revealed a 22 +/- 7% (n = 8) increase in Gi-protein as compared to Ctr. These alterations were accompanied by an increased potency of carbachol (mean EC50: 0.04 microM vs. 0.28 microM) in the presence of Iso in isolated electrically driven (1 Hz) papillary muscles. Prop had no effect on Gi-protein expression but antagonized all Iso-induced effects. In conclusion, beta-adrenergic stimulation leads to an increased expression of Gi and to an enhanced negative inotropic potency of muscarinic agonists. An enhanced muscarinic receptor coupling via Gi might play a pathophysiological role in heart diseases with increased plasma catecholamine levels.", 
    "75": "This study investigated the hemodynamic effects of the D-isomer of sotalol in open-chest rats and compared this to the action of the L-isomer and the racemic DL-sotalol. Hemodynamic and additional isovolumic maximum measurements were registered at the end and 5 minutes after an intravenous infusion period of 7 minutes. DL- (1 and 2 mg/kg) and L-sotalol (2 mg/kg) caused a significant reduction in the heart rate and in the indices of contractility during and after infusion. D-sotalol (2, 4, and 8 mg/kg), however, decreased the contractility only transiently after very high doses at high plasma concentrations. Thus, while the effects of the beta-blocking L-isomer were comparable to those of DL-sotalol, only a slight and transient hemodynamic action of comparable doses of D-sotalol was found. These findings may be of significance for the proposed use of the D-isomer as a class-III antiarrhythmic agent.", 
    "76": "Myocardial availability of drug, using metoprolol as a tracer, in acutely ischemic myocardium in the area of the left circumflex (LCX) coronary artery was compared following standard intravenous (IV) administration and after coronary sinus retroinfusion. Seven open-chest farm pigs were subjected to a 21-minute occlusion of the LCX coronary artery. All animals received simultaneous IV tritium-labeled metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg) and unlabeled metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg) retrogradely into the coronary sinus. The drug administration was started after 1 minute of coronary artery occlusion and continued for 5 minutes. Intravenously administered metoprolol resulted in a higher peak plasma concentration of metoprolol (382 +/- 52 nmol/l) than coronary sinus retroinfusion (276 +/- 47 nmol/l). The nonischemic myocardial metoprolol concentration was of similar magnitude (393-454 pmol/g), whether infused IV or into the coronary sinus. Coronary sinus retroinfusion, however, resulted in a substantial accumulation of metoprolol in the ischemic myocardium (2887-5863 pmol/g). Coronary sinus retroinfusion resulted in a pronounced and specific accumulation in the ischemic myocardium in the territory of the LCX coronary artery.", 
    "77": "The effects of the platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist, E6123, on anaphylactic responses in guinea pigs and mice were investigated. E6123 inhibited i.v. antigen (Ag)- or inhaled Ag-induced bronchoconstriction in passively and actively sensitized guinea pigs after oral administration at 3 and 10 micrograms/kg, respectively. E6123 inhibited Ag inhalation-induced airway hyperreactivity in guinea pigs after oral administration at 30 micrograms/kg. E6123 protected mice from anaphylactic death with an ED50 value (p.o.) of 7 micrograms/kg. The inhibitory effects of E6123 described above were very potent compared to those of the PAF-antagonists WEB2347 and Y-24180. The present results suggest that E6123 may be beneficial for the treatment of asthma, a condition in which PAF is assumed to be involved.", 
    "78": "Home blood pressure monitoring is a useful tool for clinical management of patients with hypertension. Its major advantages are the ease with which the techniques can be learned, reproducibility of values, sensitivity of measurement and availability of normotensive data. In spite of the ability to tell whether a subject has normal or abnormal values, because of the lack of prospective mortality/morbidity data, home blood pressure monitoring cannot be used to decide whether treatment is indicated. The treatment decision must be based on repeated clinic blood pressure readings. After that the home blood pressure monitoring can be used to exclude individuals who are at risk for side effects due to low out-of-office blood pressure readings and to precisely monitor the blood pressure response to therapy. Home blood pressure monitoring is frequently used to find subjects with 'white-coat' hypertension. In our study of borderline hypertension in Tecumseh, white-coat hypertension is present in 7.1% of the whole population and in 58% of all subjects with elevated blood pressures in the clinic. Subjects with white-coat hypertension in Tecumseh appear to be at an increased risk for coronary heart disease: they show repeated elevated clinic readings throughout their life time, their parents have higher blood pressure, their high-density lipoprotein is decreased and insulin, cholesterol and triglycerides are elevated. Whereas subjects with white-coat hypertension should not be treated with antihypertensive agents, they must be followed and managed through non-pharmacologic means.", 
    "79": "The influence of 10 mg carteolol/day on the serum concentrations of insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, free fatty acids, adrenaline, noradrenaline, blood glucose, blood lactate levels, on heart rate and systolic blood pressure was investigated during different workloads on a bicycle ergometer in a placebo-controlled randomised double-blind study involving twelve male volunteers. The subjects performed standardized increasing exercises until subjective exhaustion as well as three 40-minute endurance exercises of varying intensity, corresponding to a lactate concentration of 1.0 to 2.0 mmol/l, 2.5 to 3.5 mmol/l and more than 3.5 mmol/l in the region of the anaerobic threshold, each exercise being followed by one rest day. The most important findings are: --the ISA of carteolol is of significance for the influence on the heart rate at rest but plays a minor role with respect to the degree of reduction in the heart rate and blood pressure under exercise; --carteolol exerts a minor influence on the metabolic parameters investigated in this study. This can be partly ascribed to the pronounced ISA of carteolol. In the case of endurance exercises, which lead to blood lactate concentrations of more than 3 mmol/l, the blood glucose levels showed a tendency to decrease. However, this was not statistically significant.", 
    "80": "We have reviewed the records of 65 children with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PST) without congenital heart disease followed a mean of 4 years, with a total of 121 episodes. PST appeared before 6 months of age in 42 (64.6%) children. Thirteen patients (20%) had a present factor which might predispose to PST in 66.2% of the patients who were younger than 6 months of age, and in only 4.3% of those over 6 months. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome was present on surface ECG during sinus rhythm in 26.1% of children younger than 6 months, and in 39.1% of those over 6 months. Digoxin was the initial treatment in 84.3% of the episodes with a success rate of 75% when were employed alone and of 84.2% when were employed in combination of quinidine. PST recurred at least once in 35 children (53.8%), the 90% within three months of the first episode. All patients were alive and 63 (96.9%) doing well. One patient developed cerebral anoxia and now has hemiparesia and another patient has incessant PST. We conclude that children with PST without congenital heart disease and without delay in diagnosis had a good outcome.", 
    "81": "In 1977 the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in the USA drew together a panel of experts as the first 'Joint National Committee' to provide guidelines on the detection, evaluation and management of hypertension. This was the birth of 'stepped care', which was internationally adopted, and consisted of: step 1--a diuretic; step 2--if step 1 is inadequate, add a beta-blocker; step 3--if step 2 is inadequate, add a vasodilator (e.g. hydralazine). With the evolution of a broader, multiple risk factor approach to the management of hypertension, and the development of newer agents, this simple system was modified during the 1980s. The relative importance of non-pharmacological intervention resulted in step 1 becoming drug-free, and alternative agents necessitated wider 'steps'. The interaction of hypertension with other coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors, the disappointing effect of thiazides and beta-blockers on CHD events in intervention trials, and the increasingly large list of potential drug combinations meant that by 1989 several international consensus bodies no longer considered stepped care to be viable. Stepped care has been replaced by 'tailored therapy'. That is, based on an assessment of the patient's overall cardiovascular risk profile, the choice of first-line drug therapy has been broadened beyond diuretics and beta-blockers to include ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists and selective alpha 1-blockers. Many hypertension experts are now of the opinion that, except in limited circumstances, diuretics and beta-blockers should only be used as second-line or third-line agents.", 
    "82": "We followed-up 64 migraine patients after discontinuation of successful interval prophylaxis with flunarizine, propranolol or metoprolol, to investigate how long the therapeutic success would last, if further prophylaxis would be successful again, and what factors would influence the prognosis. We found that 16 out of 64 patients experienced a lasting reduction of migraine frequency, whereas 48 patients did improve initially, but later experienced a relapse. Further prophylaxis was effective in 29, poorly effective in 11, and ineffective in 8 of these patients; in 7 of the 8 non-responders prophylaxis was not changed. Negative prognostic factors were frequent attacks, a history of analgesic abuse and/or analgesic withdrawal therapy and ineffective previous prophylaxis. In conclusion, the therapeutic success decreases dramatically in the majority of patients several months after discontinuation of prophylaxis; further prophylaxis is more effective if the substance class is changed; increased analgesic intake is the most important prognostic factor. As a strategy for migraine prophylaxis we propose sequential changing of interval prophylaxis or--in patients with negative prognostic factors--long-term prophylaxis.", 
    "83": "The aim of this experiment was to characterize patterns of autonomic control in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats by measuring effects of pharmacologic blockers and using power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV). Resting HRs and BPs were recorded during a 20-min baseline period and over two 20-min periods of sequential autonomic blockade. On one day, animals received atropine followed by atenolol and on the following day, the drug order was reversed. Power spectrum analyses were performed on 30-s blocks of data throughout each of the three 20-min treatment periods (baseline, single blocker, combined blockade) and HRV and BPV were computed over low and high frequency bands. Increases in HR after atropine were significantly (approx. 40%) smaller in SHR rats than in WKYs. This held true even when animals were pretreated with atenolol. In contrast, decreases in HR following atenolol were similar in the two strains. These results indicate that SHRs have reduced vagal tone, but similar cardiac sympathetic tone compared to WKY rats. Virtually all HRV, over both low and high frequency bands, and in both strains, was inhibited by atropine. SHRs had significantly less high frequency HRV which is consistent with the conclusion that they have reduced cardiac vagal activity when compared with WKYs. BPV was not affected by atropine or atenolol but was inhibited by an alpha-receptor (phentolamine). BPV within both the low and high frequency bands was significantly greater in SHRs, suggesting that sympathetic tone to the vasculature is greater in SHR rats.", 
    "84": "1. The effect of the erythrocyte stage of malaria infection on hepatic glucuronidation, biliary excretion and oxidation processes was investigated using harmol, salbutamol, taurocholate and propranolol. Livers from rats infected with the rodent malaria parasite P. berghei were isolated and perfused in a single-pass (harmol, taurocholate, propranolol) or recirculating (harmol, salbutamol) design. The degree of erythrocytic parasitaemia ranged from 16% to 63%. 2. The hepatic clearance (Cl) of harmol decreased from 7.8 +/- 0.4 ml/min in controls to 5.7 +/- 1.1 ml/min in the malaria-infected group in single-pass studies. This corresponded to a 40-60% reduction in hepatic intrinsic clearance (Clint). Similar changes were observed using the recirculating design when glucuronidation accounted for greater than 90% of harmol metabolism. 3. The Cl of salbutamol, metabolized exclusively by glucuronidation under the conditions used, also decreased significantly from 8.5 +/- 0.8 in controls to 6.6 +/- 1.4 ml/min in the malaria-infected group. This corresponded to a 40-70% reduction in Clint. 4. The Cl of taurocholate, excreted unchanged in bile, decreased slightly but significantly from 9.6 +/- 0.3 ml/min in controls to 8.3 +/- 0.9 ml/min in the malaria-infected group. In the same livers, there was also a slight but significant decrease in propranolol Cl (10.0 +/- 0.1 ml/min and 9.9 +/- 0.1 ml/min, respectively). Both these compounds undergo flow-limited hepatic clearance; the decreases in Clint of taurocholate and propranolol were 87% and 35%, respectively. 5. Cl and Clint of each of the compounds studied were found to correlate significantly with the degree of erythrocytic parasitaemia. This study shows that glucuronidation, biliary excretion and oxidation by liver are impaired in malaria infection in rats, with biliary excretion being the most affected. The data indicate that there is a general decrease in hepatic elimination processes during the erythrocytic phase of malaria infection.", 
    "85": "Previous works have indicated that insulin stress activates the serotonin (5-HT) and sympathoadrenal systems in the fasted rat. In addition, recent studies have shown that activation of either the 5-HT1A, the 5-HT1C or the 5-HT2 receptor triggers adrenal catecholamine release. Then, the aim of this study was to investigate whether brain 5-HT, by means of these receptors, mediates insulin-induced adrenal catecholamine release. For that purpose, both plasma epinephrine (Epi), norepinephrine (NE) and glucose levels were measured in conscious rats bearing intracardiac catheters. The intravenous administration of insulin (1 IU/kg) triggered hypoglycemia throughout the following 120 min in both fed and overnight fasted rats. Insulin stress elicited within 30 min a 5- and 38-fold increase in plasma Epi levels in fed and fasted rats, respectively. This change was associated with significant elevations in plasma NE levels in the fasted rats only. The intravenous administration of the mixed 5-HT1A receptor/beta-adrenoceptor blocker (-)-propranolol (5 mg/kg) to fasted rats did not modify plasma glucose and catecholamine peak responses to insulin; however, at later times, insulin triggered hypoglycemic convulsions in (-)-propranolol- but not in saline-pretreated rats. Besides, pretreatments with the 5-HT1C/5-HT2 receptor blocker LY 53857 (0.5 mg/kg), or the 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonist metergoline (3 mg/kg), did not diminish plasma catecholamine responses to insulin stress. Similarly, none of these antagonists affected plasma glucose recovery. These results seem to indicate that the sympathoadrenal response to insulin administration is not mediated by 5-HT.", 
    "86": "The uptake and binding mechanism of biogenic amines in the lungs has been studied extensively with no conclusive results. The competition between N-isopropyl-123I-p-iodo amphetamines (123I-IMP) and propranolol and 123I-IMP and ketamine, in the lungs suggest that the pKa value of the biogenic amines has a significant role to play in the mechanism of uptake and retention of biogenic amines in the lungs.", 
    "87": "The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) is a multi-centre, prospective, randomised, intervention trial of 5100 newly-diagnosed patients with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus which aims to determine whether improved blood glucose control will prevent complications and reduce the associated morbidity and mortality. Newly presenting Type 2 diabetic patients aged 25-65 years inclusive, median age 53 years, median body mass index 28 kg/m2 and median fasting plasma glucose 11.3 mmol/l, were recruited and treated initially by diet. Ninety five percent remained hyperglycaemic (fasting plasma glucose greater than 6 mmol/l) and were randomly allocated to different therapies. In the main randomisation, those who were asymptomatic and had fasting plasma glucose under 15 mmol/l were allocated either to diet policy, or to active policy with either insulin or sulphonylurea aiming to reduce the fasting plasma glucose to under 6 mmol/l. Over 3 years, the median fasting plasma glucose in those allocated to diet policy was 8.9 mmol/l compared with 7.0 mmol/l in those allocated to active policy. The Hypertension in Diabetes Study has been included in a factorial design to assess whether improved blood pressure control will be advantageous. Patients with blood pressure greater than or equal to 160/90 mm Hg were randomly allocated to tight control aiming for less than 150/85 mm Hg with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or a Beta-blocker or to less tight control aiming for less than 200/105 mm Hg. The endpoints of the studies are major clinical events which affect the life and well-being of patients, such as heart attacks, angina, strokes, amputations, blindness and renal failure. To date, 728 patients have had at least one clinical endpoint. Surrogate endpoints include indices of macrovascular and microvascular disease detected by ECG with Minnesota Coding, retinal colour photography and microalbuminuria. The studies also aim to evaluate potential risk factors for the development of diabetic complications such as smoking, obesity, central adiposity, plasma LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, insulin, urate and other biochemical variables. The studies are planned to terminate in 1994, with a median follow-up of 9 years (range 3-16 years) for the glucose study and 5 years (range 2-6 years) for the hypertension study.", 
    "88": "We have compared the efficacy of a once daily 360 mg sustained release preparation of verapamil (SRV) with that of once daily 100 mg atenolol in exercise-induced angina. The study was randomized, double-blind and cross-over in design involving 30 patients with chronic stable angina. A 2-week run-in placebo phase was followed by two 4-week periods of active treatment. Patients underwent exercise stress tests at 6 and 24 h post-dose at the end of each treatment phase. After the placebo phase, patients had significantly increased times to both 1 mm ST depression and angina at 6 h (afternoon stress test) compared to 24 h post-dose (morning test). The two treatments were found to be equivalent in terms of several indices of anti-anginal efficacy. The only significant differences between treatments were in relation to indices of heart rate, which were consistently lower with atenolol than with SRV. We conclude that once daily sustained release verapamil 360 mg has equivalent anti-anginal efficacy to once daily atenolol 100 mg. A lower angina threshold seems to occur in the morning in patients with ischaemic heart disease suggesting a diurnal variation.", 
    "89": "Electrophysiological effects of class III antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone, bretylium and sotalol) were examined in spontaneously beating and voltage-clamped rabbit sino-atrial node preparations, using a two microelectrode technique. At 10(-6) mol/l these class III antiarrhythmic drugs prolonged the cycle length significantly, but did not affect the action potential duration. At high concentration (10(-4) mol/l), amiodarone and sotalol prolonged the action potential duration as well as the cycle length. Sotalol 10(-5) mol/l depolarized the maximum diastolic potential. Amiodarone 10(-4) mol/l and bretylium 10(-5) mol/l depressed the maximum rate of depolarization. At concentrations ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-4) mol/l, amiodarone induced dysrhythmia in 5 of 10 preparations and bretylium in 3 of 7 preparations, but sotalol in none of 5 preparations. In voltage-clamped sino-atrial node preparations, all the class III antiarrhythmic drugs decreased the slow inward current in a concentration-dependent manner. The steady-state outward and the hyperpolarization-activated inward currents were also reduced. Sotalol (10(-5) mol/l) decreased both the outward current and the hyperpolarization-activated inward current stronger than the slow inward current. In addition, amiodarone (3 x 10(-6) mol/l) depressed the inactivation curve for the slow inward current, but it did not shift the potential of half-maximum inactivation. The drugs also depressed the activation curve for the outward current in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the values of half-maximum activations were not influenced by these drugs as compared to control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "90": "We studied the efficacy of propranolol (Inderal) compared to alprazolam (Xanax) in 29 patients with a diagnosis of agoraphobia with panic disorder or panic disorder with or without limited phobic avoidance in a 6-week double-blind controlled experiment. Alprazolam is effective in those syndromes, whereas to date only negative or ambiguous results had been reported for propranolol. Fourteen patients received a mean daily dose of 5.0 +/- 2.3 mg of alprazolam and 15 patients received 182.0 +/- 60.5 mg mean daily dose of propranolol. We found both drugs to be effective to suppress panic attacks and reduce avoidance behavior. The only significant between-drug difference was a more rapid onset of alprazolam's panicolytic effect. Propranolol merits further study. We suggest patients worthy of a clinical trial.", 
    "91": "1. Maximal aerobic exercise capacity, submaximal endurance exercise performance, and exercise haemodynamics have been studied in sixteen patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension during treatment with captopril and atenolol. 2. Administration of atenolol (1 x 100 mg day-1) or captopril (1 x 100 mg day-1) for 6 weeks resulted in similar supine and erect systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Heart rate was significantly lower during atenolol treatment. 3. Exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure were significantly lower during atenolol than during captopril treatment, exercise diastolic blood pressure (at 100W) did not differ significantly. With atenolol exercise cardiac output was significantly lower and exercise stroke volume significantly higher than with captopril. 4. Maximal work rate, maximal oxygen consumption and maximal heart rate were significantly lower during atenolol than during captopril treatment (respectively 6%, 8% and 25%). Maximal respiratory exchange ratio and lactate concentration did not differ. 5. No statistically significant difference in submaximal endurance time between atenolol and captopril was found. Endurance time was reduced by 19% during atenolol and by 13% during captopril as compared with placebo. No difference in rating of perceived exertion between atenolol and captopril was present. 6. The results indicate that atenolol will reduce blood pressure during exercise more effectively than captopril in patients with hypertension. The limitation of submaximal endurance exercise performance by both agents is of similar magnitude. This may be regarded as an unwanted side effect in certain physically active patients with hypertension.", 
    "92": "1. The applicability of a continuous infusion of indocyanine green (ICG) to detect changes in apparent hepatic blood flow (HBF) was investigated in six healthy subjects. 2. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to measure ICG concentrations, and the effect of intravenous propranolol (10 mg in 10 min) on HBF was investigated. 3. During 150 min infusions of ICG (1.0 mg min-1) steady-state was reached within about 30 min and thereafter the plasma dye concentration remained essentially constant until the end of infusion. 4. Blood clearance (CLb) of ICG (15.9 +/- 2.2 ml min-1 kg-1; mean +/- s.d.), calculated as infusion rate/blood dye concentration over three time periods (30-50, 80-100 and 130-150 min) during the 150 min infusion, was not different from that obtained with three 1-min infusions (0.5 mg kg-1) administered at corresponding times of the day (CLb = 14.0 +/- 2.2 ml min-1 kg-1, P = 0.06). 5. The pharmacokinetics of ICG were shown to be linear up to plasma concentrations of at least 3 micrograms ml-1 using variable infusion rates (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg min-1). 6. Propranolol had little effect on ICG concentrations during continuous infusion. The AUC of ICG from the start of propranolol infusion up to 125 min thereafter was increased by 12% +/- 17% (P = 0.21) compared with placebo.", 
    "93": "Early studies suggested that Doppler ultrasound held great promise as a noninvasive, repeatable, and simple method of predicting hypertension in pregnancy and identifying those hypertensive pregnancies at high risk of maternal and fetal complications. Further studies have tempered this early enthusiasm by revealing the multiplicity of factors that may influence the Doppler waveform pattern. This makes interpretation of changes in the FVW pattern difficult. Despite these difficulties, there is evidence to suggest that Doppler velocimetry may contribute to two aspects of the management of hypertensive pregnancies. First, as a noninvasive method of investigating the effect of pharmacologic agents on maternal, fetal, and placental circulations. Second, a number of studies support a useful role for Doppler ultrasound measurements in the assessment of fetal well being in hypertensive complications. Present knowledge suggests that the technique will not replace existing fetal monitoring tests or be capable of indicating the optimum time for delivery. It does however, appear to be a useful adjuvant in assessing the risk of perinatal complications, especially in hypertensive pregnancies presenting before 30 weeks' gestation.", 
    "94": "We have recently shown that distension of the descending colon in anesthetized dogs causes reflex increases in heart rate, aortic blood pressure and the maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure, involving afferent pathways in the hypogastric nerves. In this study we have examined the efferent mechanisms involved in those responses. The descending colon was distended using Ringer solution at constant pressure in 13 anesthetized dogs. As previously shown, distension of the colon caused an increase in aortic blood pressure, heart rate and the maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure. The increase in the aortic blood pressure was abolished by either bretylium tosylate or phentolamine. Propranolol or bretylium tosylate abolished the increases in heart rate when changes in the aortic blood pressure were prevented, and abolished the increases in the maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure when the increases in heart rate were also prevented. These results indicate that the reflex increases in heart rate, arterial blood pressure and the maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure involved efferent sympathetic pathways.", 
    "95": "Identification of nonadrenergic binding sites for clonidine and related imidazolines in brain and peripheral tissues and partial purification of an endogenous ligand for these sites have led to the postulation of a novel transmitter/receptor system. The receptors seem to be present in adrenal medulla and to regulate chromaffin cell function. The present study was undertaken to test the ability of the putative endogenous ligand clonidine-displacing substance (CDS) to displace [3H]idazoxan binding to adrenal chromaffin cell membranes and to release catecholamines from cultured chromaffin cells. CDS potently displaces [3H]idazoxan binding to chromaffin cell membranes, with an IC50 of 5 units. The displacement of [3H]idazoxan binding by CDS was not modified by guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate, suggesting that the imidazoline binding sites may not be GTP-binding protein-coupled receptors. CDS produced a large release of catecholamines from chromaffin cells, and the release was partially blocked by cobalt, a calcium channel blocker. The calcium-dependent release reached a plateau above 5 units of CDS, with a maximal response at 15 min. It is concluded that endogenous CDS, prepared from brain, regulates the secretion of catecholamines from adrenal chromaffin cells, probably by activating imidazole receptors.", 
    "96": "Considerable controversy exists regarding the relationship between fluoxetine and the emergence of suicidal ideation. Three cases are presented of patients who were reexposed to fluoxetine after having previously made a serious suicide attempt during fluoxetine treatment. All three patients developed severe akathisia during retreatment with fluoxetine and stated that the development of the akathisia made them feel suicidal and that it had precipitated their prior suicide attempts. The akathisia and suicidal thinking abated upon the discontinuation of the fluoxetine or the addition of propranolol. The emergence of suicidal ideation during treatment with fluoxetine may be secondary to the development of akathisia. Gradual increments of fluoxetine dose and the prompt recognition and treatment of akathisia may reduce further the rare occurrence of suicidal ideation during fluoxetine treatment.", 
    "97": "We tested the hypothesis that mechanical alternans of the heart is due to alternations in intracellular calcium (Cai2+) levels. Eight papillary muscles were isolated from the right ventricles of male ferrets and were chemically loaded with aequorin to record cytoplasmic Cai2+. To produce a steady-state mechanical alternans, the preparations were perfused with a physiological salt solution containing a low calcium concentration (0.25 mM), at 22 degrees C, and stimulated at 0.5-1.0 Hz in the presence of carbachol and propranolol. The aequorin signal (Cai2+) and isometric contraction were simultaneously recorded. In each muscle, the strong beats (beats with higher peak tension) were associated with larger Ca2+ transients than the weak beats. The relationships between peak Cai2+ and peak tension, both during strong and weak beats, were similarly modified by short-term frequency responses. On the other hand, the time courses of the isometric contractions and Ca2+ transients during strong beats and weak beats were superimposable. These data indicate that mechanical alternans is caused by an alternate change of Cai2+ available for activation of the myofilaments. Prolongation of the time for recycling Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, i.e., a depressed uptake function of the Ca2+ pump with concomitant slow transportation of Ca2+ from the uptake compartment to the release compartment in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is suggested as a cause of the abnormal Cai2+ handling during mechanical alternans.", 
    "98": "In this investigation, an isolated, perfused rat stomach system was used to elucidate the roles of histamine, serotonin, and the action of cimetidine, methysergide, and propranolol in relation to the in vivo and in vitro administration of compound 48/80. While histamine administered both in vivo and in vitro stimulated acid secretion in the perfused rat stomach, serotonin, added in vitro, inhibited histamine-induced gastric acid secretion. Cimetidine, given either in vivo or in vitro, blocked histamine-induced acid secretion, and methysergide, but not propranolol, reversed the serotonin-induced inhibition of histamine-stimulated acid secretion. Compound 48/80, given in vitro, caused gastric acid secretion that was blocked by pretreatment with cimetidine. Administered in vivo, however, compound 48/80 inhibited both basal and histamine-stimulated acid secretion. This inhibition was partially reversed by pretreatment with methysergide. The absence of inhibition of acid secretion by in vitro-administered compound 48/80 may be related to the timing of the serotonin effect. When serotonin was given prior to histamine, it blocked acid secretion, whereas no inhibition occurred when serotonin was administered together with histamine. None of the other agents investigated affected basal acid secretion.", 
    "99": "Interactions with the hepatic cytochrome P-450 microsomal enzyme system, as evidenced by statistically significant changes in pharmacokinetic parameters, have been described with some H2-receptor antagonists. Omeprazole is the first of a new class of antisecretory agents inhibiting gastric secretion by blocking hydrogen potassium ATPase. Omeprazole contains a benzimidazole moiety and thus has the potential to interact with the cytochrome P-450 enzyme group. In vitro, in vivo and human clinical studies have assessed whether such an interaction occurs, and the potential clinical consequences, in patients receiving omeprazole therapy. In vitro studies have demonstrated that omeprazole influences O-deethylation and N-demethylation in liver microsomes and the clearance and elimination half-life of antipyrine in isolated perfused liver preparations. Overall, the studies reviewed suggest that omeprazole has a differential affinity toward specific cytochrome P-450 isozymes. In vivo animal studies have demonstrated that omeprazole prolongs pentobarbital sleep times and half-life and decreases [14C]-aminopyrine elimination. Human clinical studies have not demonstrated the \"all or none\" effect of omeprazole on cytochrome P-450-mediated drug interactions, as is seen with cimetidine. These studies confirm in vitro findings that omeprazole is a differential inhibitor of drug metabolism: interactions have been demonstrated with the model drugs aminopyrine and antipyrine, and the therapeutic drugs diazepam, phenytoin, and warfarin but not with theophylline or propranolol. Although caution should be exercised when initiating omeprazole therapy in patients taking concomitant diazepam, warfarin, and phenytoin, clinically significant drug interactions appear unlikely.", 
    "100": "Antiarrhythmic drug therapy is often ineffective or poorly tolerated. Combining antiarrhythmic agents with different electrophysiologic properties may have a synergistic antiarrhythmic effect when compared with each drug alone. If a lower dose of each drug can be used, combination therapy may also result in lower incidence of side effects. The goal of our study was to assess the complementary effect of low-dose mexiletine and metoprolol, when compared with either drug alone. Ten patients with frequent ventricular arrhythmias including 7 patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia were evaluated in an open-label sequential study. The response to drug therapy was evaluated by 24-h continuous EKG monitoring, exercise stress testing, and echocardiogram after each treatment. Combination therapy effectively reduced ventricular arrhythmias in 8 patients (80%) in contrast to only 1 patient (10%) on metoprolol alone and 4 patients (40%) on mexiletine alone. In 5 patients (71%) ventricular tachycardia was abolished. The number of couplets was reduced from 51 +/- 39 to 1.9 +/- 2.4 (p less than 0.01) and total premature ventricular beats from 7790 +/- 9047 to 597 +/- 515 (p = 0.06). Combination therapy was well tolerated without proarrhythmia or precipitation of congestive heart failure. It is concluded that low-dose mexiletine combined with metoprolol is effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias in selected patients, and enhances the antiarrhythmic effect of either drug alone without significant side effects."
