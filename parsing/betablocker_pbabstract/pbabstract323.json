Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of urocortin (1 ng) produced a marked decrease in the proliferative response of splenocytes to a mitogen. The suppressive effect of urocortin was abolished by pretreatment with a ganglionic blocking agent (chlorisondamine) or a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist (propranolol), but not by adrenalectomy. These results suggest that urocortin is an important neuropeptide involved in the brain control of peripheral immune functions such as stress-induced immunosuppression, and that the suppressive effect of urocortin is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "1": "It is now clear that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment after myocardial infarction (MI) reduces mortality and morbidity. However, the benefits of ACE inhibition are not homogeneous and are largely confined to high-risk patients who have subjective or objective evidence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. How long treatment should continue is a vexed question, which also arises with other agents, for example beta-blocker use after MI. The AIREX study assessed the long-term magnitude and duration of the survival benefits observed with ramipril in patients after MI who have clinically defined heart failure. The mortality status of all 603 patients recruited from the UK centres involved in the AIRE study was verified at an extended 5-year follow-up (3 years after the AIRE study closed). Ramipril assignation was associated with a 36% relative and a 11% absolute mortality risk reduction. These findings strongly support the view to select patients on the basis of impaired LV function and reinforce the previously reported conclusions of the \"selective\" ACE inhibition post-MI trials. Using this approach, the survival benefit is not only of large magnitude but also sustained over many years. These results also argue for life-long treatment with an ACE inhibitor, once a decision to treat an individual patient after MI has been made.", 
    "2": "There is evidence that the processes regulating heart rate variability (HRV) reflect nonlinear complexity and show \"chaotic\" determinism. Data analyses using nonlinear methods may therefore reveal patterns not apparent with the standard methods for HRV analysis. We have consequently used two nonlinear methods, the Poincar\u00e9 plot (scatterplot) and cardiac sequence (quadrant) analysis, in addition to the standard time-domain summary statistics, during a normal volunteer investigation of the effects on HRV of some agents acting at the cardiac beta-adrenoceptor. Under double-blind and randomized conditions (Latin square design), 25 normal volunteers received placebo, salbutamol 8 mg (beta 2-adrenoceptor partial agonist), pindolol 10 mg (beta 2-adrenoceptor partial agonist), or atenolol 50 mg (beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist). Single oral doses of medication (at weekly intervals) were administered at 22:30 hours, with sleeping heart rates recorded overnight. The long-term (SDNN, SDANN) and short-term (rMSSD) time-domain summary statistics were reduced by salbutamol 8 mg and increased by atenolol 50 mg compared with placebo. The reductions in both SDNN and SDANN were greater after salbutamol 8 mg compared with pindolol 10 mg. The reduced HRV after pindolol 10 mg differed from the increased HRV following atenolol 50 mg. The Poincar\u00e9 plot, constructed by plotting each RR interval against the preceding RR interval, was measured using a reproducible computerized method. Scatterplot length and area were reduced by salbutamol 8 mg and increased by atenolol 50 mg compared with placebo; scatterplot length and area were lower after pindolol 10 mg compared with atenolol 50 mg. Geometric analysis of the scatterplots allowed width assessment (i.e., dispersion) at fixed RR intervals. At the higher percentiles (i.e., 90% of scatterplot length: low HR), salbutamol 8 mg reduced and atenolol 50 mg increased dispersion; at lower percentiles (i.e., 10%, 25%, and 50% length), atenolol 50 mg and pindolol 10 mg increased dispersion compared with placebo and salbutamol 8 mg. Cardiac sequence analysis (differences between three adjacent beats; delta RR vs. delta RRn + 1) was used to assess the short-term patterns of cardiac acceleration and deceleration. Four patterns were identified: +/+ (a lengthening sequencing), +/- or -/+ (balanced sequences), and finally -/- (a shortening sequence). Cardiac acceleration episodes (i.e., number of times delta RR and delta RRn + 1 were both changed) were increased in quadrants -/- and +/+ following pindolol 10 mg and salbutamol 8 mg; the beat-to-beat difference (delta RRn + 1) was reduced after salbutamol 8 mg compared with the three other groups. These results demonstrated a shift towards sympathetic dominance (beta-adrenoceptor partial agonist salbutamol 8 mg) or parasympathetic dominance (beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol 50 mg); pindolol 10 mg exhibited HR-dependent effects, reducing HRV at low but increasing variability at high prevailing heart rates. These nonlinear methods appear to be valuable tools to investigate HRV in health and to study the implications of perturbation of HRV with drug therapy in disease states.",

    "7": "This study was undertaken to determine whether dl-sotalol can prevent ventricular tachyarrhythmia inducibility that can be predicted from electrophysiologic parameters. The effects of dl-sotalol in 16 patients (ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 11 and fibrillation (VF) in 5) were determined in electrophysiologic studies before and after dl-sotalol (320 mg/day). In 9 of 16 patients (56%) after dl-sotalol, ventricular tachyarrhythmia could not be induced by the entire stimulation protocol (responders). There were significant differences in QT interval (462 +/- 52 vs. 415 +/- 34 msec; p < 0.05) and ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) at 600, 400 and 300 msec (302 +/- 28 vs. 262 +/- 20 msec; p < 0.001, 280 +/- 23 vs. 240 +/- 21 msec; p < 0.001, 256 +/- 24 vs. 222 +/- 12 msec; p < 0.005, respectively) between responders and non-responders. The percentile increases in VERP (% VERP) at 600, 400, and 300 msec in responders were 25%, 26%, and 27%, whereas those in non-responders was 9%, 7%, and 7%, respectively. Isoproterenol administered to responders did not fully reverse the dl-sotalol-induced prolongation of VERP (delta VERP) at 600, 400, and 300 msec, which remained significantly prolonged compared to the baseline (281 +/- 18 vs. 241 +/- 16 msec; p < 0.01, 258 +/- 20 vs. 223 +/- 21 msec; p < 0.01, 247 +/- 22 vs. 202 +/- 16 msec; p < 0.01, respectively). % VERP did not exhibit significant differences at 600 (16%), 400 (15%), and 300 (20%) msec, indicating the lack of a reverse use-dependency. The results suggest that delta VERP in responders did not show reverse use-dependency, and that the phenomenon may account for the efficacy of dl-sotalol.", 
    "8": "Our objective was to clarify the management of patients with silent myocardial ischemia (SMI) and documented coronary artery disease. We evaluated 222 such patients who did not develop anginal pain during exercise thallium-201 imaging (ST-TL). They were divided into low- and high-risk groups based on results of left ventriculographic findings at rest, ST-TL, and coronary angiography. The incidence of cardiac events was 28/222 (13%) overall, being 9 of 110 (8%) in the low-risk patients, and 19 of 112 (17%) in the high-risk group. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.020). Analysis of the survival of the high-risk group revealed significant differences between the patients with a negative and positive redistribution (p = 0.047), but such differences were not significant in the low-risk patients. Therefore, the classification of SMI patients into low- and high-risk categories was an appropriate strategy. ST-TL was useful for identifying patients with myocardial ischemia and selecting those to receive coronary revascularization and/or drug therapy.", 
    "9": "In the present study, we examined the effect of vasopressin on the induction of the low-molecular-weight heat shock proteins heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) and alphaB-crystallin in an aortic smooth muscle cell line, A10 cells. Vasopressin induced a time-dependent accumulation of HSP27 and alphaB-crystallin. The stimulatory effects of vasopressin were dose-dependent over the range 0.1 nmol/L to 0.1 micromol/L. The EC50 values for vasopressin were 2 (HSP27) and 4 nmol/L (alphaB-crystallin). Vasopressin induced increases in the levels of the mRNAs for HSP27 and alphaB-crystallin. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), a protein kinase C (PKC)-activating phorbol ester, induced an accumulation of HSP27 (EC50, 20 nmol/L) and alphaB-crystallin (EC50, 2 nmol/L). In contrast, 4alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, a non-PKC-activating phorbol ester, had no such effect. Staurosporine and calphostin C, inhibitors of PKC, significantly reduced the vasopressin-induced accumulation of HSP27 and alphaB-crystallin as well as that induced by TPA. BAPTA/AM and TMB-8, inhibitors of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, significantly reduced the vasopressin-induced accumulation of HSP27 and alphaB-crystallin. These results strongly suggest that vasopressin stimulates the induction of HSP27 and alphaB-crystallin via PKC activation in vascular smooth muscle cells and that this effect of vasopressin is dependent on intracellular Ca2+ mobilization.", 
    "10": "Regulation of the intracellular free magnesium concentration ([Mg2+]i) was investigated in isolated rat hearts, using 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR). [Mg2+]i was found to be slowly and significantly decreased during prolonged application of isoproterenol (ISO) through beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation, and restored by subsequent washouts. The ISO-induced decrease in [Mg2+]i was antagonized by addition of a muscarinic receptor agonist, carbachol (CCh). In the presence of atropine, CCh did not exert this effect. A water-soluble forskolin derivative, NKH477, which directly activates adenylate cyclase, also caused a decrease in [Mg2+]i, which could be antagonized by CCh, but a greater concentration was required as compared to the ISO case. The manner of [Mg2+]i regulation mimicked those noted for the action potential duration and the Ca2+ channel current, in which cAMP is known to act as a second messenger. Even in the presence of a Ca2+ channel blocker, verapamil, [Mg2+]i was reversibly decreased by ISO. Changes in the intracellular ATP concentration demonstrated any clear correlation with changes in [Mg2+]i. These results suggest that [Mg2+]i can be controlled by a balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic activities. cAMP may play a key role in the [Mg2+]i regulation via beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, although some other metabolic pathways also appear to be involved. Hormonally induced changes in [Mg2+]i have possible clinical significance.", 
    "11": "To define the molecular mechanism(s) of carvedilol inhibition of lipid peroxidation we have utilized model systems that allow us to study the different reactions involved in this complex process. Carvedilol inhibits the peroxidation of sonicated phosphatidylcholine liposomes triggered by FeCl2 addition whereas atenolol, pindolol and labetalol are ineffective. The inhibition proved not to be ascribable (a) to an effect on Fe2+ autoxidation and thus on the generation of oxygen derived radical initiators; (b) to the scavenging of the inorganic initiators O2*- and *OH; (c) to an effect on the reductive cleavage of organic hydroperoxides by FeCl2; (d) to the scavenging of organic initiators. The observations that (a) carvedilol effectiveness is inversely proportional to the concentration of FeCl2 and lipid hydroperoxides in the assay; (b) the drug prevents the onset of lipid peroxidation stimulated by FeCl3 addition and; (c) it can form a complex with Fe3+, suggest a molecular mechanism for carvedilol action. It may inhibit lipid peroxidation by binding the Fe3+ generated during the oxidation of Fe2+ by lipid hydroperoxides in the substrate. The lag time that carvedilol introduces in the peroxidative process would correspond to the time taken for carvedilol to be titrated by Fe3+; when the drug is consumed the Fe3+ accumulates to reach the critical parameter that stimulates peroxidation. According to this molecular mechanism the antioxidant potency of carvedilol can be ascribed to its ability to bind a species, Fe3+, that is a catalyst of the process and to its lipophilic nature that concentrates it in the membranes where Fe3+ is generated by a site specific mechanism.",

The main adverse events during this double-blind period were worsened heart failure, hypotension/dizziness, bradycardia/atrioventricular block, and aggravation of angina.

The relative ratio between the two variants (GsalphaS/GsalphaL) decreased from 0.48 to 0.24 (P<0.01). This result, obtained by electrophoretic resolution of membrane proteins by standard SDS-PAGE and an immunoblot analysis with an antiserum oriented against an internal sequence of Gsalpha, was verified by resolution on urea-containing gels and an antiserum oriented against the C-terminus decapeptide of Gsalpha. Under these conditions, the GsalphaS/GsalphaL ratio was decreased from 0.41 to 0.31 (P<0.05). The total amount of both isoforms (GsalphaS plus GsalphaL) decreased to 83% (P<0.05) or 68% (P<0.01) by standard or urea SDS-PAGE respectively. These data demonstrate that cold-acclimation of hamster brown adipose tissue is associated with preferential decrease in the plasma membrane density of the short variant of the Gsalpha protein.%This decrease was paralleled by an increase in the other plasma membrane constituents, [3H]CGP12177 binding sites, [3H]ouabain binding sites and Na,K-ATPase activity to 147%, 212% and 191% respectively.", 
    "24": "The metabolic effects during myocardial ischemia and sustained reperfusion of the antianginal agents diltiazem (n = 10) and propranolol (n = 10) were monitored with noninvasive phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to establish any correlation between metabolic changes and infarct size. Spectroscopy followed changes in high-energy phosphate concentrations and myocardial intracellular pH during 2 h of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and 3 subsequent weeks of reperfusion, in a closed chest canine infarct model. Gadolinium-DTPA enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess the extent of myocardial injury (infarct size). Microspheres were used to document the zone at risk and the success of reperfusion. Whereas diltiazem appeared to reduce the derangement in high-energy phosphates during coronary occlusion, there was no significant change in infarct size when compared with a previously studied control group. Propranolol, which produced a lesser decline in pH during occlusion and smaller pH changes during early reperfusion, was associated with a significant reduction in the degree of tissue necrosis (compared with controls). There was an inverse correlation (r = -0.51) between the change in myocardial pH (occlusion end to immediate reperfusion) and the recovery index (an index of myocardial salvage). By 1 h into reperfusion, there was a stronger inverse correlation between pH and infarct size (r = -0.75), implying a protective effect of delaying pH recovery during early reperfusion and indicating the potential use of this parameter as a predictor of tissue viability.",

A total of 267 relevant upper-bound distance restraints were used to obtain a family of convergent structures using molecular dynamics methods. A standard simulated annealing protocol using the XPLOR program included in ARIA provided a total of 18 final structures. The averaged RMSD between these structures and the mean atomic coordinates was 0.8 +/- 0.3 A for the backbone atoms. The highest mobility was observed in the segments between residues 10 to 13, comprising Tyr 13, one of the residues shown to be important for binding of omega-conotoxin GVIA and MVIIA to N-type calcium channels. The three-dimensional structure is stabilised by the three disulfide bonds and includes a short antiparallel beta-strand between residues 5-8, 23-25 and 19-21. The folding for this non-N-type calcium channel blocker is similar to that previously calculated for omega-conotoxins GVIA, MVIIA and MVIIC.

    "39": "Evidence is growing that the cAMP pathway through the cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) transcription factor plays an important role in long-term memory formation (LTM). To study the role of beta-noradrenergic receptors, positively linked to the cAMP second-messenger system, in the dynamics of LTM processes, we used a memory-reactivation paradigm because recent studies in our laboratory confirmed that reactivated memory is labile and undergoes an extended reconsolidation process. In an eight-arm maze, rats were trained to choose the same three baited arms; 24 hr later, memory was reactivated and then the rats were injected intracerebroventricularly at 5 min, 30 min, 60 min, or 5 hr later with the beta-antagonist timolol or with saline. The results showed that injection of timolol induced amnesia only at the 60 min post-reactivation interval, whereas all control groups and groups that were timolol-injected at other post-reactivation intervals displayed optimal retention. The delayed amnesic action of timolol suggests that beta noradrenergic receptors and the cAMP cascade are implicated in the late phase of reprocessing of a remembered event.",

These results suggest that 5-HT1, except 5-HT1A; 5-HT2, except 5-HT2A; and 5-HT3 receptors are positively involved in EAP-induced analgesia, whereas the activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors suppressively act on EAP-induced analgesia.", 
    "41": "Beta-blockers are generally determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Previous HPLC separations of beta-blockers have often required a mobile phase containing three components; acetonitrile or methanol to control the retention; buffer to control the ionic strength and pH of the mobile phase; ion-pairing reagent to provide adequate retention of beta-blockers or organic amines as masking agent to reduce peak tailing. Due to the complexity of the mobile phases employed, development of these assays can be a laborious process. Additionally, alkyl sulphonates and organic amines dramatically reduces the life-time reduction of silica based C18 columns. The results of this study demonstrated that the addition of tested alkyl sulphonates and organic amines is not essential for an adequate separation of beta-blockers. In this study, we developed a simple HPLC method for the simultaneous separation of model beta-blockers, atenolol, practolol, metoprolol, oxprenolol and propranolol. Atenolol, practolol, metoprolol, oxprenolol and propranolol adequately separated with high peak symmetries using a mobile phase consisted of methanol/acetonitrile/phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 3.0) (15:15:70, v/v/v). By altering only the fraction of methanol with respect to acetonitrile, method development becomes a more efficient separation. Furthermore, atenolol, practolol, metoprolol, oxprenolol and propranolol can be detected up to 0.25, 5, 10, 50 and 10 ng ml(-1). In this publication, we present the simultaneous separation of beta-blockers having a wide range of polarity. It is proposed that this new mobile phase, consisting only acetonitrile, methanol and phosphate buffer can be used for the analysis of the several beta-blockers presently in doping control analysis as well as others.",

Selected ions of clenbuterol-bis-TMS were m/z: 405, 337, 336, 335, 300, and 227. Extraction yield and minimum detection limit of clenbuterol from urine were identified. Extraction yield was 94.30% and minimum detection was found 0.02 ng ml(-1) urine. It has been concluded that the GC-MS method is sensitive, accurate, precise, and reproducible for analysing of clenbuterol from urine.", 
    "43": "The sodium salt of the single-isomer, heptakis-(2,3-dimethyl-6-sulfato)-beta-cyclodextrin (HDMS-betaCD) was used as resolving agent in the capillary electrophoretic (CE) separation of weak base enantiomers in pure methanol background electrolytes (BEs). According to the requirements of the charged resolving agent migration model of CE enantiomer separations (CHARM model), a high buffer-capacity, low pH methanolic BE was created from 25 mM phosphoric acid and 12.5 mM NaOH. In this BE, the solubility of HDMS-betaCD was as high as 50 mM, permitting the realization of very high separation selectivities and short separation times for the fully protonated weak base enantiomers.", 
    "44": "The effect of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles on the spectrofluorimetric intensities and on the solubility of two beta-blockers (atenolol and nadolol) were studied at 25.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C and I = 0.1 M NaCl. From the dependence of these physical properties on SDS concentration it was possible to calculate the binding constants drug-micelle, and it was found that both techniques yield similar results for the binding constants, and that are in agreement with those calculated from the effect of micelles on the apparent acidity constants of the beta-blockers.", 
    "45": "The authors present an account on their first experience with treatment of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCHR) by beta-blocking agents. In 21 patients with CSCHR Trimepranol (metipranololum) a beta non-selective blocker, 2 x 10 mg/day for two to three months was used. In 30 patients with CSCHR Vasocardin (Metoprololi tartas) was used i.e. a beta-1 selective blocking agent, 2 x 50 mg/day for two to three months. In all patients remission of the disease occurred, on average 4.5 to 4.8 weeks after the onset of treatment. During treatment of CSCHR by beta-blocking agents no significant difference was found in the action of beta selective and non-selective blockers regardless of the duration of the disease before onset of treatment and the number of relapses.", 
    "46": "Although beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists appear to be beneficial in chronic heart failure there is little information on their effects on autonomic and baroreceptor function which may have important prognostic implications. We sought to determine first whether beta-adrenoreceptor blockade will improve baroreceptor function and vagal tone in chronic heart failure, and second whether there were any differences between standard therapy with metoprolol and the second-generation vasodilating beta-blocker celiprolol. In this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study 50 patients with stable chronic heart failure received either celiprolol 200 mg daily, metoprolol 50 mg twice daily or placebo for 12 weeks after a 4-week dose titration period. Thirty-five healthy normal subjects were also studied. Baroreceptor gain was assessed non-invasively by cross-spectral analysis of R-R and systolic blood pressure low- and high-frequency components (the alpha angle) during controlled respiration. High-frequency power was used as a measure of vagal modulation. Satisfactory recordings for analysis were obtained in 31 patients with heart failure. The results showed that at baseline baroreceptor gain (alphaHF) was significantly depressed in patients with heart failure compared with the normal control group (4.95+/-0. 55 versus 11.73+/-1.32 ms/mmHg, P<0.0001). After 12 weeks of treatment with metoprolol baroreceptor gain improved significantly whether measured while supine (P=0.03) or standing (P=0.009), and this was associated with a significant increase in R-R HF power (P=0. 008). There were no significant changes after treatment with celiprolol or placebo. We conclude that metoprolol but not celiprolol therapy restores baroreceptor gain towards normal and increases vagal tone in chronic heart failure. The ancillary properties of celiprolol do not appear to provide any advantages over metoprolol for the restoration of autonomic and baroreceptor function in heart failure.", 
    "47": "The use of pharmacological inhibitors of protein kinases represents a potentially powerful tool in dissecting the regulatory features of intracellular signaling pathways. However, although the in vitro potency, selectivity, and efficacy of numerous kinase inhibitors have been characterized, little is known regarding the usefulness of these compounds as inhibitors in intact cells. In attempting to characterize the role of protein kinase A (PKA) in regulating the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (AR) in human airway cells, we observed a seemingly profound capacity of the isoquinoline H-89, a potent and widely used PKA inhibitor, to attenuate agonist-mediated desensitization of the beta-2 AR. Although additional experiments identified H-89 as an effective inhibitor of intracellular PKA, extended analysis of the compound determined the principal effect of H-89 was via its action as a beta-2 AR antagonist. Pretreatment with or the acute addition of H-89 significantly attenuated isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation. In cells pretreated with H-89 and then washed extensively, the subsequent dose-dependent response to isoproterenol suggested beta-2 AR antagonism by retained H-89. Competition binding of [125I]iodopindolol established Ki values of approximately 180 nM and 350 nM for H-89 antagonism of beta-2 AR and beta-1 AR, respectively. Additional receptor binding studies suggest selectivity of H-89 for the beta-2 AR and beta-1 AR, although a weak antagonism (Ki values of approximately 10 microM or greater) of other G protein-coupled receptors was observed. Results from additional pharmacological and biochemical analyses of various protein kinase inhibitors further established the need for careful characterization of pharmacological inhibitors when used in intact cell models.", 
    "48": "Recent behavioral studies indicate that conditioned fear response to contextual stimuli is reduced effectively by anxiolytic 5-hydroxytryptame (5-HT)1A agonists. Since the hippocampus seems to play an essential role in associative fear memories evoked by context, it is important to assess the effect of 5-HT1A agonists on pyramidal cell activity in the hippocampus. We examined the effects of 5-HT1A agonists on the spontaneous firing rate of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in unanesthetized, unrestrained rats. Systemic administration of selective 5-HT1A agonists, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, buspirone, ipsapirone, and flesinoxan produced a dose-dependent inhibition of neuronal activity. Putative 5-HT1A antagonists NAN-190 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl]piperazine and (-)-pindolol did not change neuronal activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons. The suppression of neuronal activity by buspirone was antagonized by NAN-190 but not by (-)-pindolol. Lack of antagonistic activity of (-)-pindolol for the suppression of pyramidal neurons via a postsynaptic mechanism is consistent with the results of recent electrophysiological experiments in anesthetized rats. Pretreatment with parachlorphenylalanine did not change the spontaneous firing rates of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons or abolish the suppressant effects of buspirone on these neurons. Taken together, the present results strongly suggest that suppression of the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuronal activity by anxiolytic 5-HT1A agonists in awake rats is mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors located on pyramidal neurons.", 
    "49": "Anterior chambers of the eyes of male rats were cannulated under pentobarbital anesthesia for intracameral infusions of balanced salt solution (BSS) and intraocular pressure (IOP) recording. Blood pressure was recorded from a femoral artery. IOP was recorded during a 2-h intracameral infusion composed of a constant component (0.05 microl/min) and a periodic component (0.25 microl/min), cycling at 4 min on and then 4 min off. After a 20-min baseline period, 1 drop of timolol (0.5%) or BSS was applied to the cornea and repeated 1 h later. Intracameral infusions of BSS and 0.05% timolol were also compared. Topical timolol slightly delayed the BSS-induced IOP rise (p <.05). Complex demodulation and the estimated gain parameter of a second-order transfer function fit to the periodic responses revealed that topical timolol also reduced (p <.05) passive outflow resistance. Intracameral timolol markedly delayed the BSS-induced rise in IOP. Initially, timolol decreased both outflow impedance and nonresistive components (p <.05) of IOP, but these effects dissipated by 2 h when IOPs were similar. In all experiments, within-group blood pressure was unchanged. Topical and intracameral timolol have different effects on IOP. The data support the opinion that, in vivo, timolol acts at beta-receptors that control both outflow impedance and nonresistive mechanisms, probably vascular, to lower IOP.", 
    "50": "We identified for the first time two genetically selected strains of rats that differ markedly in sensitivity to cocaine-induced life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and arrest. The two strains of rats, designated as Fast and Slow, were bred for sensitivity (Fast) or resistance (Slow) to electrically kindled seizures. Studies were performed on halothane-anesthetized, mechanically ventilated rats. Animals were given cocaine (3 or 4 mg/kg/min i.v.) until they died. Arrhythmias (atrioventricular conduction block) developed at much lower cumulative cocaine doses in Slow-kindling rats than in Fast-kindling rats (15 +/- 1 versus 42 +/- 3 mg/kg, p <.01). The lethal cocaine dose (the dose that caused cardiac arrest) was also markedly lower in Slow than in Fast strains (32 +/- 2 versus 62 +/- 6 mg/kg, p <.01). These differences between the two strains were not significantly altered by pretreatment of animals with either ganglionic blockers, hexamethonium (20 mg/kg i.v.) or chlorisondamine (5 mg/kg i.v.), or a nonselective beta adrenergic receptor blocker, propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.). A nonselective alpha adrenergic receptor blocker, phentolamine (10 mg/kg i.v.), however, abolished the differences between the Fast and Slow strains in the doses of cocaine required to produced atrioventricular conduction block and cardiac arrest. The results provide the first evidence of genetically determined susceptibility or resistance to cocaine-induced cardiotoxicity. There appears to be a genetically determined difference in the alpha adrenergic receptor system between the two strains that is responsible for the differential sensitivity to cocaine-induced arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.", 
    "51": "An inhibition study showed that the stereoselective hydrolysis of butyryl propranolol (butyryl PL) in rat liver microsomes and plasma involves carboxylesterase. The hydrolysis of (S)-butyryl PL in plasma was specifically inhibited by eserine and bis-nitrophenyl phosphate (BNPP), compared to the (R)-isomer, despite the non-stereoselective hydrolysis of butyryl PL in plasma. In addition, inhibition of hydroloysis by eserine and BNPP showed little stereoselectivity for butyryl PL in liver, although liver microsomes showed an (S)-preferential hydrolysis for butyryl PL (R/S ratio of Vmax/Km: 2.1 +/- 0.2). The hydrolysis of butyryl PL was not inhibited by a polyclonal antibody against a high affinity carboxylesterase (hydrolase A, RH1). Moreover, the high Km value and the high IC50 for phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) against the hydrolysis of butyryl PL in rat liver microsomes suggest that a low affinity carboxylesterase (perhaps hydrolase B) might be involved in this hydrolysis in rat liver.", 
    "52": "The enantioselectivity of 4-hydroxylation of bunitrolol (BTL), a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, was studied in microsomes from human liver, human hepatoma (Hep G2) cells expressing CYP2D6, and lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6. Kinetics in human liver microsomes showed that the Vmax value for (+)-BTL was 2.1-fold that of (-)-BTL, and that the Km value for (+)-BTL was lower than that for the (-)-antipode, resulting in the intrinsic clearance (Vmax/Km) of (+)-BTL being 2.1-fold over its (-)-antipode. CYP2D6 (CYP2D6-met) expressed in Hep G2 cells had a methionine residue at position 373 of the amino acid sequence and a rat-type N-terminal peptide (MELLNGTGLWSM) instead of the human-type (MGLEALVPLAVIV), and showed enantioselectivity of [(+)-BTL < (-)-BTL] for the rate of BTL 4-hydroxylation. In contrast, enantioselectivity [(+)-BTL > (-)-BTL] for Hep G2-CYP2D6 (CYP2D6-val) with a human-type N-terminal peptide that had a valine residue at 374, which corresponds to the methionine of the CYP2D6-met variant, was the same as that for human liver microsomes. We further confirmed that CYP2D6-met and CYP2D6-val expressed in human lymphoblastoid cells, both of which have methionine and valine, respectively, at position 374 and a human-type N-terminal peptide, exhibited the same enantioselectivities as those obtained from CYP2D6-met and CYP2D6-val expressed in the Hep G2 cell system. These results indicate that the amino acid at 374 of CYP2D6 is one of the key factors influencing the enantioselectivity of BTL 4-hydroxylation.", 
    "53": "At 21 weeks of gestation, a 37-year-old woman was referred to our hospital. The fetus showed bradycardia and arrhythmia. Because of glaucoma the woman had previously been treated with timolol eye drops. In this paper a possible association between the timolol eye drops and the fetal cardiac arrhythmia is discussed.", 
    "54": "We compared the efficacy of timolol maleate ophthalmic gel-forming solution 0.5% QD with that of levobunolol hydrochloride 0.5% BID, as measured by change in intraocular pressure (IOP), effect on heart rate, and ocular tolerability. The study had a positive-controlled, double-masked, randomized, multicenter, 12-week, two-period (6 weeks each), crossover design. One hundred fifty-two patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive either timolol maleate gel-forming solution QD or levobunolol BID for 6 weeks, followed by a crossover to the alternate treatment. IOP and heart rate were measured at morning trough and peak during weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12. Timolol maleate gel-forming solution QD was comparable to levobunolol BID in reducing IOP at peak and trough. Although the effects on peak heart rate were similar between the two medications, the effect on trough heart rate of timolol maleate gel-forming solution QD was significantly less than that of levobunolol BID (P = 0.001). The incidence of ocular burning and stinging was comparable between the two treatments. Patients experienced significantly more blurred vision when using timolol maleate gel-forming solution than when using levobunolol (P = 0.013). Overall, more patients experienced at least one adverse event when using timolol maleate gel-forming solution. Timolol maleate gel-forming solution QD is as efficacious in reducing IOP as levobunolol BID.", 
    "55": "We report an isocratic, HPLC procedure for assay of the orally administered hypertension drugs [atenolol, amlodipine, nifedipine, nitrendipine, nimodipine and felodipine given in retention order] of which atenolol, an aryloxypropanolamine beta-blocker is administered with anyone of the other five dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in combined hypertension therapy. The drugs were dissolved in methanol and 20 microliters of a mix of the drugs was injected onto a reverse phase JASCO-metaphase ODS (250 x 4.0 mm) 5 mu column. Any one of the six drugs could be used as the internal standard. The drugs were resolved by elution with a pH 4.5 equivolume mobile phase of acetonitrile-0.01 M KH2PO4, with pH adjustments done with H3PO4 (flow-rate 1.5 ml min-1). The column effluent was monitored at 250 nm. The detector response (peak height ratio) was linear in the dynamic range of 25-3200 ng ml-1 of these drugs, with the detection limits at approximately 15 ng ml-1. Full statistical evaluation of the data including linear regression (least-square fit) analysis was performed. The suggested procedure has the advantage that all the five dihydropyridine derivatives can be quantified alone or in formulation with atenolol.", 
    "56": "It has been proposed that the rise in myometrial oxytocin receptor (OTR) concentrations at term triggers parturition. In the present study, we have shown that in vivo infusion of the beta2-adrenoceptor (beta2AR) antagonist ICI-118.551 in late pregnant rats prevents the rise in myometrial OTR binding normally seen during delivery. A reduced contractile responsiveness of uterine strips isolated from rats in labor when challenged with oxytocin (OT) and a slight shortening of gestation accompanied this effect. OTR mRNA levels were, however, unaltered after the treatment, suggesting that the effect of beta2AR blockade on myometrial OTR was posttranscriptional or due to influences on extra-myometrial tissue. Infusion of the OTR antagonist atosiban down-regulated OTR binding sites in the parturient myometrium and resulted in an impaired contractile response to OT without affecting gestational length. OTR gene expression did not change, as seen from unchanged OTR mRNA values. Neither atosiban nor ICI-118.551 infusions alone changed fetal mortality. A significant increase in the incidence of fetal deaths was found, however, when rats were treated with a combination of atosiban and ICI-118.551. This treatment also down-regulated myometrial OTR and weakened the contractile response to OT, but it did not change gestational length. We conclude that the timing and onset of a normal parturition as well as a favorable outcome seem to be independent of a rise in OTR. This fact cannot exclude the possibility that an increase in OTR is of importance in the genesis of preterm labor. We suggest that beta2 stimulation up-regulates OTR during delivery. This effect may partly be responsible for the tachyphylaxis seen after the use of beta2 agonists to control preterm labor. We further suggest that OTR stimulation up-regulates OTR during labor. The OTR down-regulation seen after atosiban treatment adds to the direct relaxing effect of atosiban on the myometrium. In view of this, atosiban may prove to be a more useful tocolytic than the traditionally used beta2 agonists.", 
    "57": "-Transgenic mouse models have been developed to manipulate beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) signal transduction. Although several of these models have altered betaAR subtypes, the specific functional sequelae of betaAR stimulation in murine heart, particularly those of beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) stimulation, have not been characterized. In the present study, we investigated effects of beta2AR stimulation on contraction, [Ca2+]i transient, and L-type Ca2+ currents (ICa) in single ventricular myocytes isolated from transgenic mice overexpressing human beta2AR (TG4 mice) and wild-type (WT) littermates. Baseline contractility of TG4 heart cells was increased by 3-fold relative to WT controls as a result of the presence of spontaneous beta2AR activation. In contrast, beta2AR stimulation by zinterol or isoproterenol plus a selective beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1AR) antagonist CGP 20712A failed to enhance the contractility in TG4 myocytes, and more surprisingly, beta2AR stimulation was also ineffective in increasing contractility in WT myocytes. Pertussis toxin (PTX) treatment fully rescued the ICa, [Ca2+]i, and contractile responses to beta2AR agonists in both WT and TG4 cells. The PTX-rescued murine cardiac beta2AR response is mediated by cAMP-dependent mechanisms, because it was totally blocked by the inhibitory cAMP analog Rp-cAMPS. These results suggest that PTX-sensitive G proteins are responsible for the unresponsiveness of mouse heart to agonist-induced beta2AR stimulation. This was further corroborated by an increased incorporation of the photoreactive GTP analog [gamma-32P]GTP azidoanilide into alpha subunits of Gi2 and Gi3 after beta2AR stimulation by zinterol or isoproterenol plus the beta1AR blocker CGP 20712A. This effect to activate Gi proteins was abolished by a selective beta2AR blocker ICI 118,551 or by PTX treatment. Thus, we conclude that (1) beta2ARs in murine cardiac myocytes couple to concurrent Gs and Gi signaling, resulting in null inotropic response, unless the Gi signaling is inhibited; (2) as a special case, the lack of cardiac contractile response to beta2AR agonists in TG4 mice is not due to a saturation of cell contractility or of the cAMP signaling cascade but rather to an activation of beta2AR-coupled Gi proteins; and (3) spontaneous beta2AR activation may differ from agonist-stimulated beta2AR signaling.", 
    "58": "The effect of dopamine hydrochloride on beta3-adrenoceptors was studied in isolated adipocytes of Wistar rats using uptake of [14C]-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) as the indicator. Dopamine induced a concentration-dependent decrease of 2-DG uptake into adipocytes in a manner which was not modified by haloperidol at concentrations sufficient to block dopaminergic receptors. Failure of blockade was also observed in samples receiving the pretreatment with a mixture of SCH23390 and domperidone, the dopaminergic antagonists. Absence of dopaminergic receptors in rat white adipocytes was further supported by the findings that dopaminergic agonists did not modify the glucose uptake and the negative response to receptor antibodies in immunoblotting analysis. Pindolol and propranolol reversed this inhibition of dopamine in a concentration-dependent manner. However, this action of dopamine was not affected by prazosin at concentrations sufficient to block alpha-adrenoceptors. Effect of dopamine was reduced in the presence of Rp-cyclic AMPS triethylamine, the membrane-permeable antagonist of cyclic AMP (cAMP), indicating the mediation of cAMP in this inhibition. Direct effect of exogenous dopamine on beta3-adrenoceptors was identified using the antibody for beta3-adrenoceptors that reversed the inhibition of dopamine. These results suggest that dopamine can activate beta3-adrenoceptors to lower glucose uptake into rat white adipocytes which lack dopaminergic receptors.", 
    "59": "High doses of isoniazid increase hypotension induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex tachycardia to bradycardia, an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In the present study, the possible enhancement by isoniazid of bradycardia induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthetised with chloralose-urethane. Isoniazid significantly increased bradycardia after propranolol, pindolol, labetalol and atenolol, as well as after clonidine, but not after hexamethonium or carbachol. Enhancement was not observed in rats pretreated with methylatropine or previously vagotomised. These results are compatible with interference by isoniazid with GABAergic inhibition of cardiac parasympathetic tone. Such interference could be exerted centrally, possibly at the nucleus ambiguus, or peripherally at the sinus node.", 
    "60": "Upon electrical stimulation three transmitters are known to be released from the adrenergic nerve terminals of the isolated MVD preparation: two motor transmitters (noradrenaline (NA) and ATP) acting synergistically to provoke twitch contraction, and an inhibitory transmitter, the peptide NPY. The frog alkaloid pumiliotoxin-B (PTX-B) displayed two opposite effects on the electrically stimulated MVD: at low concentrations (0.1-0.3 microM) it caused twitch depression, at higher concentrations (0.5-2 microM) there was a potent twitch stimulation. Transmitters and/or receptors involved in the depressive effect could not be clearly identified, although interference with NPY is possible. On the other hand, the potent twitch stimulation caused by PTX-B may be due to exaggerated release of the same transmitters (NA and ATP) involved in twitch stimulation produced by electrical stimulation. Opening by PTX-B of the Na+ channels on the membrane of the adrenergic nerve terminals causes activation of the amine pump facilitating re-uptake of not only endogenous NA but also of exogenous catecholamines.", 
    "61": "The mechanisms underlying the vascular effects of propofol are not fully understood. Vasopressin, a potent vasoactive peptide, stimulates the arachidonate cascade and the synthesis of prostacyclin (PGI2; the main metabolite of the cascade in vascular smooth muscle cells). Arachidonic acid (AA) release by phospholipases is the rate-limiting step in the cascade. We investigated the mechanisms underlying vasopressin-induced AA release and the effect of propofol on PGI2 synthesis in a rat aortic smooth muscle cell line: A10 cells.", 
    "62": "In cultured A10 cells pretreated with propofol, the stimulation by vasopressin of AA release and PGI2 synthesis was evaluated by measuring [3H]AA and 6-keto PGF1alpha, respectively, in the culture medium. The effects of propofol on vasopressin-induced activation of phosphoinositide-hydrolyzing phospholipase C and phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D were evaluated by measuring inositol phosphate formation and choline formation, respectively.", 
    "63": "A phospholipase C inhibitor and a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase inhibitor both attenuated vasopressin-induced AA release and PGI2 synthesis, as did a phospholipase A2 inhibitor. Propofol inhibited vasopressin-induced activation of phosphoinositide-hydrolyzing phospholipase C and phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D, but this effect of propofol was significant only at supraclinical concentration (0.1 mM). Propofol reduced vasopressin-induced PGI2 synthesis. The inhibitory effect was observed at concentrations (10 microM-0.1 mM) higher than those used clinically.", 
    "64": "Propofol suppresses the arachidonate cascade caused by vasopressin at least partly by inhibiting phosphoinositide-hydrolyzing phospholipase C and phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D, resulting in the inhibition of PGI2 synthesis. Propofol-mediated inhibition of vasopressin-stimulated synthesis of PGI2 may reduce the vasorelaxation by propofol.", 
    "65": "To study the role of the inhibitory nonadrenergic noncholinergic (i-NANC) system in regulating bronchial reactivity during antigen challenge, we first tested a blocker of the i-NANC system (oxyhemoglobin, HbO2, 2.5 microm) on the relaxation response of guinea pig tracheal strips (n=6) in vitro to electrical field stimulation (ES) in the presence of atropine (1 microg/ml) and propranolol (2 microg/ml). Fresh HbO2 significantly inhibited 35.3+/-4.5% (P<0.001) of the NANC relaxation response. Secondary, 26 anesthetized, ovalbumin-sensitized animals were divided into three groups: antigen challenged (n=10), pretreated with HbO2 (13 mg/kg) and challenged (n=9), and treated with HbO2 only (n=7). Pulmonary resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) were measured 15-20 min prior to (baseline) and up to 30 min after antigen or HbO2 injection. Antigen challenge alone induced early maximal respiratory changes: RL increased 1646+/-115% above baseline (2 min) whereas Cdyn decreased 42+/-10% below baseline (4 min). These changes returned to baseline within 15 min. Pretreatment with HbO2 increased peak respiratory responses induced by antigen [RL, 3728+/-1680% above baseline; Cdyn, 69+/-7% below baseline (P<0.05)]. HbO2 delayed significantly (P<0.05) the time for recovery of RL and Cdyn. HbO2 alone had little effect on respiratory parameters. We conclude that HbO2 may antagonize the i-NANC system in the airway and this antagonism may accentuate pulmonary hypersensitivity during acute antigen challenge.",

Calcium-adenosine-triphosphatase method reveals all the branches of the organ hemomicrocirculatory bed simultaneously and the possibility to carry out a combined pharmacological and histoangiological study of intraorgan vascular bed is obtained. During the study on the obsidan effect on myocardial vascular bed of the cat it was established that obsidan causes major vessels dilatation and capillary constriction.", 
    "67": "We investigated hemodynamics and plasma catecholamine concentrations in eight consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy for suspected pheochromocytoma. The same anesthesia protocol was used in all patients: a continuous infusion of sufentanil 0.5 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1) and isoflurane 0.4% (end-tidal) in 50% N2O/O2. Systolic arterial pressure was maintained between 120 and 160 mm Hg by adjusting an infusion of nicardipine, a calcium-channel blocker, while tachycardia (>100 bpm) was treated by 1-mg boluses of atenolol. Hemodynamics (thermodilution technique) and plasma catecholamine concentrations were measured before surgery, after the induction of anesthesia, after turning the patient to the lateral position, during pneumoperitoneum, during tumor manipulation, after adrenalectomy, and at the end of surgery. Two events resulted in significant catecholamine release: creation of the pneumoperitoneum and adrenal gland manipulation. As a consequence, a twofold increase in cardiac output was recorded. Adjustments of nicardipine infusion (2-6 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) minimized changes in mean arterial pressure. Beta-adrenergic blockade was necessary in six patients. In conclusion, laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma results in marked catecholamine release during pneumoperitoneum and tumor manipulation. Titration of a nicardipine infusion allowed easy and quick control of the hemodynamic aberrancies related to these processes.", 
    "68": "Pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopy, now used for adrenalectomy, may complicate anesthetic management of patients with pheochromocytoma. In this study, laparoscopic adrenalectomy was associated with catecholamine release during the creation of pneumoperitoneum and tumor manipulation. Adjustments of a nicardipine infusion readily attenuated the subsequent hemodynamic aberrancies.", 
    "69": "A series of 1-acyl-5,6-diethoxy-2-methylthiobenzimidazoles was synthesized and evaluated for inotropic activity. The compounds caused a concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect in isolated guinea-pig papillary muscles. According to the estimated ED50 value, the efficacy of methyl (1) and isonicotinoyl derivatives (6) was similar to that of milrinone. Carbachol markedly reduced the increase of contraction force of compounds 1, 2, 5 and 9. The inotropic effect of compounds 6 and 9 does not seem to be mediated by the direct stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors. At that time the beta-agonistic properties of the compounds 1 and 2 might be partially involved in the positive inotropic action of these agents. All tested derivatives, as well as milrinone, increased the amplitude of the late component P2 of the biphasic contraction in guinea-pig papillary muscles. These results indicate that benzimidazole derivatives exert their inotropic effect by increasing Ca influx via slow calcium channel into myocardial cells.",

    "78": "VARIABLE EFFICACY: Prognosis in patients with chronic heart failure remains poor. Certain drugs can lower mortality and improve quality of life. DRUGS WITH PROVEN EFFICACY: Converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) have proven efficacy and should be used in all stages of heart failure outside contraindications. High-dose regimens are recommended when tolerated. Certain beta-blockers have also been added to the list of effective drugs for heart failure. Positive data have been reported for metroprolol, bisoprolol and carvedilol. Improved function has been demonstrated only with carvedilol allowing a clear reduction in mortality; it is currently indicated in combination with CEI and diuretics for patients with symptomatic heart failure. DRUGS WITH INSUFFICIENTLY PROVEN EFFICACY: Certain drugs which have been used for many years can improve heart function but data clearly proving lower mortality are lacking. These include diuretics and nitrate derivatives for symptomatic patients and digitalics which are useful not only for patients with complete arrhythmia due to atrial fibrillation but also for symptomatic patients with sinus rhythm. According to preliminary studies, aldosterone antagonists appear to have a positive effect on mortality due to heart failure. DRUGS WITH LIMITED INDICATIONS: Other drugs have been found to have no effect on mortality. Amiodarone, amlodipine and felodipine can thus be used for patients with associated diseases.

The apparent permeability coefficient of Pz-peptide across the cornea and the conjunctiva increased over the 1-5 mM range, suggesting that Pz-peptide enhanced its own transport across both epithelial tissues. The cornea appeared to be more sensitive than the conjunctiva to the penetration enhancement effect of Pz-peptide. Thus, whereas Pz-peptide elevated the corneal transport of mannitol, fluorescein, and FD4 by 50%, 57%, and 106%, respectively, it did not affect the conjunctival transport of mannitol and fluorescein, while enhancing FD4 transport by only 46%.

We investigated whether lipolysis in human omental adipocytes induced by a potent and selective human beta3-AR agonist (L-755,507) was affected by the Trp64Arg mutation of the beta3-adrenoceptor, using 18 omental fat samples obtained during total hysterectomy. The Trp64Arg mutation was determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Arg64 homozygous (n = 4) had a lower median effective concentration (EC50) and lower responsiveness compared with wild-type (n = 8) (EC50: -6.55 +/- 0.21 vs. -7.53 +/- 0.35 log mol/l, P = 0.007; responsiveness: 3.48 +/- 0.32 vs. 5.76 +/- 0.36 micromol x 10(5) cells(-1) x 90 min(-1), P = 0.014, respectively), although there was no difference in lipolysis induced by isoproterenol or CGP12177.

    "84": "Angiotensin II (AngII) initiates cellular responses by activation of type I (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) angiotensin receptors. Both AT1 and AT1 receptors have seven transmembrane structures characteristic of G protein-coupled receptors, but only the AT1 receptor undergoes rapid internalization upon agonist binding. In addition to the agonist hormone, the peptide antagonist [Sar1,Ile8]AngII can also induce internalization of the AT1a receptor expressed in mammalian cell lines, but the nonpeptide AT1 receptor blocker losartan does not internalize. AT1 receptor internalization occurs via clathrin-coated pits, but there is evidence that, in contrast to the internalization of other G protein-coupled receptors, the internalization of the AT1 receptor is independent of dynamin and beta-arrestin. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that AT1 receptor internalization requires two regions in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor, but it is independent of G protein activation. The dependence of AT1 receptor internalization on the presence of a serine-threonine-rich region suggests that phosphorylation of the receptor tail may regulate the internalization process. The possible role of AT1 receptor internalization in sustained signal generation has been suggested, but its relationship to nuclear AngII receptors is not completely understood.", 
    "85": "Mesangial cells are one of the main targets of angiotensin II (AngII) in the renal cortex. AngII receptors on mesangial cells are of high affinity (nanomolar range). They belong to the AT1 subtype as shown by the inhibitory effect of AT1 antagonists on [125I]-Sar1, Ala8 AngII binding and on all of the biologic effects mediated by AngII, such as cytosolic calcium stimulation, inositol phosphate formation, prostaglandin production, and cell contraction. AngII also exerts long-term effects on mesangial cells, including stimulation of cell growth and synthesis of a variety of proteins, essentially the components of the extracellular matrix (collagen, fibronectin) and the type 1 inhibitor of plasminogen activator. These effects are mediated, at least in part, by autocrine products, in particular endothelin, platelet-derived growth factor, and transforming growth factor-beta, whose synthesis is enhanced by AngII. Treatment by an AT1 receptor blocker of mice with experimental nephritis inhibits activation of type I collagen alpha2 chain promoter and prevents the development of glomerulosclerosis. AngII receptors in rat mesangial cells are equally distributed between the AT1A and AT1B isoforms. Treatment of these cells by AngII or losartan, an AT1 receptor blocker, has no effect on AT1A and AT1B receptor mRNA expression, whereas candesartan, another AT1 receptor blocker, increases and dexamethasone decreases this expression.", 
    "86": "The authors report an original case of the association of three pathologies: pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism and cardiomyopathy with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. This type of cardiac disease has occasionally been described in cases of pheochromocytoma and are usually induced by the endocrine disturbance because they regress with treatment of the pheochromocytoma. The associated hyperthyroidism observed in this case is very rare and may have increased the left ventricular pressure gradient. Medical treatment before surgery of the pheochromocytoma was unusual in that a triple therapy was used including betablockers, classically contra-indicated in pheochromocytoma alone. In this case, it provided excellent control of the blood pressure and decreased the left ventricular obstruction during the perioperative period.", 
    "87": "As the next millennium approaches, excitement and promise characterize the future of dilated cardiomyopathy. Until recently, dilated cardiomyopathy was considered an incurable, uniformly fatal chronic disease. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that at least a quarter of patients with recent onset of symptoms with cardiomyopathy manifest spontaneous improvement and a sustained favorable prognosis. It is imperative that patients who present with new-onset cardiomyopathy be managed medically and closely followed. Medical treatment remains the foundation of therapy, and certainly the advent of beta-blocker use may herald further benefit beyond that observed with conventional therapy (ACE inhibitors and digoxin). Unless mechanical support is required for hemodynamic instability and end organ failure, patients should be treated medically and observed. As discussed earlier, transient mechanical support as a bridge to recovery should be considered in the appropriate clinical scenario before committing to cardiac transplantation. Patients with established disease who have been followed for extended periods (> 6 months) that have progressive symptoms despite optimal medical therapy should be considered for surgical therapies. Cardiac transplantation is available to only a minority of the diseased population. All newer modalities of surgical unloading therapy theoretically reduce wall stress. Clearly in dilated cardiomyopathy, ventricular performance is reduced; however, individual myocyte contractile function may be intact. Studies of isolated myocytes (which are unloaded) have yielded conflicting data; however, if contractile function is intact and performance is reduced primarily secondary to abnormal loading conditions, surgical unloading therapies should yield benefit. Hence the thesis of Batista that geometric alteration will improve performance assumes intrinsic integrity of the myocyte contractile function. The implication of intrinsic myocyte contractile dysfunction is that surgical remodeling does not yield improved ventricular performance. Although clinicians have learned that selection criteria appear to play a role in predicting beneficial outcomes with cardiomyoplasty and the Batista procedure, clinical techniques to assess the integrity of myocyte function are unsophisticated. Quantifying interstitial fibrosis, assays for the degree of apoptosis, and various immunologic measures currently do not provide the insight necessary to predict outcomes reliably. The future assessment of dilated cardiomyopathy and the decision to consider alternative surgical procedures versus cardiac transplantation will likely be determined by biomolecular studies. At present, these new surgical procedures are promising therapies and potential alternatives to cardiac transplantation. Controlled studies to determine the clinical and survival benefit compared with medical therapy will ultimately be required, after the surgical techniques and patient selection criteria are refined. Randomized, prospective controlled studies assessing LVAD therapy and cardiomyoplasty are in progress.", 
    "88": "Heart failure has long been considered to have a progressive downhill course leading inexorably to an early demise. This course often occurs silently, in the absence of any obvious cardiac insults. The reason for this is a combination of cell loss, myocyte dysfunction, impaired energetics, and pathologic remodeling of the chamber. Improved clinical outcome should result from strategies that reduce the biologic signals responsible for myocyte growth, dysfunction, and loss and chamber remodeling. Clinicians should no longer attempt to treat chronic heart failure with pharmacologic growth and remodeling process. In time, it may be possible for the clinician to view the treatment of heart failure largely as a matter of improving the biologic function of the myocardium.",

This study evaluated CNV in a group of patients with muscle tension headache, common migraine, and classic migraine. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of beta blocker therapy on the CNV. The patients with common migraine responded to beta blocker therapy. CNV amplitude decreased during beta blocker treatment and with resolution of headache episodes. Further studies are indicated as CNV may be useful to evaluate the effect of drug treatment in common migraine.",

Patients were instructed to continue medication for 6 months or until cycles had stopped. However, 11 of 24 patients (46%) in the propranolol group took medication for less than 6 months and the remaining patients from 6 months to 3 years.

This was tested by analyzing data from patients who had taken part in the Circadian Anti-ischemia Program in Europe (CAPE) trial. After a 2-week, single-blind, run-in period (Phase 1), patients were randomized to amlodipine, 5 mg/day (first 4 weeks) and 10 mg/day (second 4 weeks), or placebo for 8 weeks (Phase 2). The 48-h Holter data were analyzed for 167 amlodipine-treated patients and 83 placebo patients based on a 2:1 randomization scheme. Sixty-three per cent of amlodipine patients and 67% of placebo patients were receiving concomitant BBLs, and >90% had taken sublingual nitrates during anginal attacks, as basic antiischemic therapy. After 7 weeks of therapy, when 48-h Holter monitoring was repeated, there were no significant changes in the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias in the placebo or amlodipine groups for all patients or subgroups of patients with or without BBLs. Also, between-group comparisons showed no significant differences in arrhythmias between amlodipine and placebo patients. In summary, amlodipine (5-10 mg/day) given to patients with severe, chronic CAD receiving conventional antiischemic therapy, did not produce any proarrhythmic effects.",

Neuropeptides have recently been shown to be neurotransmitters in the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic inhibitory and excitatory nerves in the human gut.

Derivatives of 4-hydroxyindolyl-3-acetic acid are characterized by a prolonged beta-adrenoblocking effect, cardioselective beta-adrenoblockers were found among derivatives of N,N-bis(2-hydroxy-3-phenoxypropanol)amine, and highly effective \"hybrid\" beta-,a-adrenoblockers were detected among derivatives of 3(5)-phenoxymethylisoxazolines and 5-phenoxymethyl-1,2,4,-oxadiasoles. Clinical studies of one of the most promising compounds of the latter series named proxodolol showed it to be a highly effective antihypertensive, antianginal, and antiglaucoma drug. Proxodolol is permitted for clinical application. At present it is manufactured as eye drops for decreasing intraocular pressure in glaucoma; its production as a solution for injections for arresting hypertensive crises is starting.", 
    "100": "We tested the hypothesis that the post-hypoxia frequency decline of phrenic nerve activity following brief, isocapnic hypoxic episodes in rats is diminished by prior hypoxic episodes and alpha2-adrenoreceptor antagonism. Anesthetized (urethane), artificially ventilated (FIO2=0.50) and vagotomized rats were presented with two or three, 5 min episodes of isocapnic hypoxia (FIO2 approximately 0.11), separated by 30 min of control, hyperoxic conditions. Phrenic nerve discharge, end-tidal CO2, and arterial blood gases were measured before during and after hypoxia. The average maximum frequency decline, measured 5 min after the first hypoxic episode, was 26+/-7 bursts/min below pre-hypoxic baseline values (a 70+/-16% decrease). By 30 min post-hypoxia, frequency had returned to baseline. Two groups of rats were then administered either: (1) saline (sham) or (2) the alpha2-receptor antagonist, RX821002 HCl (2-[2-(2-Methoxy-1,4-benzodioxanyl)] imidazoline hydrochloride; 0.25 mg/kg, i.v.). Isocapnic hypoxia was repeated 10 min later. In sham rats, the post-hypoxia frequency decline (PHFD) was significantly attenuated relative to the initial (control) response. However, PHFD was attenuated significantly more in RX821002-treated vs. sham rats (-3+/-3 bursts/min vs. -12+/-4 bursts/min @ 5 min post hypoxia for RX821002 and sham-treated, respectively; p<0.05). We conclude that the magnitude of PHFD is dependent on the prior history of hypoxia and that alpha2 adrenoreceptor activation plays a role in its underlying mechanism.",

In the present study, the neuroprotective activity of the alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonists brimonidine, AGN 191103, and clonidine were examined in an animal model that simulates secondary neuronal degeneration of the optic nerve in a way thought to be independent of elevation of intraocular pressure. The beta-blocker timolol, currently used clinically to decrease intraocular pressure, was also examined for neuroprotective activity at dosages corresponding to the effective antihypertensive dosage.", 
    "102": "A single dose of each of the tested compounds was administered intraperitoneally immediately after partial crush injury of the rat optic nerve. Secondary degeneration was measured by determining injury-induced deficits with and without the drug.

    "103": "All three alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonists, but not timolol, exhibited neuroprotective effects. Treatment immediately after injury with each of these agonists resulted in a dose-dependent attenuation of the injury-induced decrease in compound action potential amplitude.

    "105": "1. Fenoldopam mesylate, a benzazepine derivative, is a D1 receptor agonist that lowers blood pressure through vasodilation of renal, mesenteric, coronary and cerebral vascular beds. 2. Experiments were performed in rats, and mean carotid blood pressure and heart rate were registered. Two series of experiments were performed: (1) fenoldopam as control group and (2) fenoldopam after pretreatment with one of the following drugs: the D1 antagonist SCH 23390, the D2 antagonist sulpiride, the selective beta1-adrenergic antagonist atenolol, the selective beta2-adrenergic antagonist ICI 118.551, the nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol and the neurotoxin that destroys catecholaminergic nerve terminals 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OH-DA). 3. Fenoldopam produced a dose-dependent hypotensive effect that was not modified by pretreatment of the rat with atenolol or propranolol; however, ICI 118.551 produced a significant reduction of the hypotensive response induced by fenoldopam. 4. Pretreatment of the animals with SCH 23390 produced a significant dose-related reversal of the rat blood pressure reduction induced by low doses of fenoldopam. Sulpiride produced a result similar to that induced by pretreatment with SCH 23390. 5. The pretreatment of the animals with 6-OH-DA surprisingly attenuated the response induced by fenoldopam and produced only a significant reversal of the reduction of mean blood pressure induced with the lower dose of fenoldopam. 6. The findings obtained in the present work do not provide further evidence of direct participation of beta2-adrenergic receptors on the mechanism of action of fenoldopam. Its action seems to be mainly due to activation of D1 cardiovascular receptors.",

Additionally, radiolabeled lipids were isolated and identified using TLC and autoradiography as methods.", 
    "108": "Results demonstrate that castration significantly decreases lipid synthesis in male hamster flank organs. In addition, propranolol treatment inhibits such synthesis in glands from intact, gonadectomized, and isoproterenol-treated animals. However, isoproterenol treatment was ineffective when compared to intact or gonadectomized control vehicle-treated animals. Lipid classes isolated and identified lipids either in castrated or in drug-treated animals were phospholipids, cholesterol, monoglycerides, fatty acids, waxes and cholesterol esters.", 
    "109": "Results indicate an inhibitory effect induced on lipid synthesis by beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists; however, beta-adrenergic agonists drugs do not stimulate it. Data suggest a permissive role of adrenergic hormones on lipid synthesis in intact and in gonadectomized animals. Furthermore, castration decreased the synthesis, suggesting that a tight coupling between beta-adrenergic receptors and androgen receptors may be a prerequisite for lipogenesis in this tissue. Pre-treatment does not modify sebum composition in gonadectomized animal glands. These data support the evidence that activation of beta-adrenergic receptors could be an independent factor in the lipid composition regulation process.",

    "112": "Hourly average BP data analyses showed a significantly greater drop in mean diastolic BP (p < 0.009) at night in NTG than AION. Cases with visual field deterioration had significantly (p = 0.05) lower minimum nighttime diastolic BP.

Normotensives and hypertensives without therapy had no such difference. IOP showed no significant correlation with visual field deterioration in any of these conditions.

    "114": "The exact mechanisms for the decrease in R-R interval (RRI) during acute physiological hyperinsulinemia with euglycemia are unknown. Power spectral analysis of RRI and microneurographic recordings of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in 16 normal subjects provided markers of autonomic control during 90-min hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamps. By infusing propranolol and insulin (n = 6 subjects), we also explored the contribution of heightened cardiac sympathetic activity to the insulin-induced decrease in RRI. Slight decreases in RRI (P < 0.001) induced by sevenfold increases in plasma insulin could not be suppressed by propranolol. Insulin increased MSNA by more than twofold (P < 0.001), decreased the high-frequency variability of RRI (P < 0.01), but did not affect the absolute low-frequency variability of RRI. These results suggest that reductions in cardiac vagal tone and modulation contribute at least in part to the reduction in RRI during hyperinsulinemia. Moreover, more than twofold increases in MSNA occurring concurrently with a slight and not purely sympathetically mediated tachycardia suggest regionally nonuniform increases in sympathetic activity during hyperinsulinemia in humans.", 
    "115": "The low-frequency component of the heart rate variability spectrum (0.06-0.10 Hz) is often used as an accurate reflection of sympathetic activity. Therefore, interventions that enhance cardiac sympathetic drive, e.g., exercise and myocardial ischemia, should elicit increases in the low-frequency power. Furthermore, because an enhanced sympathetic activation has been linked to an increased propensity for malignant arrhythmias, one might also predict a greater low-frequency power in animals that are susceptible to ventricular fibrillation than in resistant animals. To test these hypotheses, a 2-min coronary occlusion was made during the last minute of exercise in 71 dogs with healed myocardial infarctions: 43 had ventricular fibrillation (susceptible) and 28 did not experience arrhythmias (resistant). Exercise or ischemia alone provoked significant heart rate increases in both groups of animals, with the largest increase in the susceptible animals. These heart rate increases were attenuated by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Despite the sympathetically mediated increases in heart rate, the low-frequency power decreased, rather than increased, in both groups, with the largest decrease again in the susceptible animals: 4.0 +/- 0.2 (susceptible) vs. 4.1 +/- 0.2 ln ms2 (resistant) in preexercise control and 2.2 +/- 0.2 (susceptible) vs. 2.9 +/- 0.2 ln ms2 (resistant) at highest exercise level. In a similar manner the parasympathetic antagonist atropine sulfate elicited significant reductions in the low-frequency power. Although sympathetic nerve activity was not directly recorded, these data suggest that the low-frequency component of the heart rate power spectrum probably results from an interaction of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and, as such, does not accurately reflect changes in the sympathetic activity.", 
    "116": "Nasal stimulation provokes hypertension and bradycardia. We report here that such stimulation inhibits baroreflex vagal bradycardia (BVB). In chloralose- and urethan-anesthetized, beta-adrenergic receptor-blocked rats, the aortic depressor nerves were cut and electrically stimulated to induce BVB. Nasal application of smoke, warm distilled water, or cold or hot Ringer solution suppressed BVB, but application of warm Ringer solution did not. Smoke-induced inhibition was abolished by trigeminal but not olfactory denervation. Neither suprapontine decerebration nor C3 spinal cord transection affected the inhibition. Bradycardia induced by electrical stimulation of the peripheral cut end of the cervical vagus nerve (VIB) was suppressed by long-lasting smoke application. Intravenous prazosin, a proposed blocker of prejunctional inhibition of acetylcholine release from the vagus terminals, abolished VIB inhibition but attenuated BVB inhibition only slightly. Thus nasal stimulation inhibits BVB, and this inhibition is mediated exclusively by the trigeminal nerve and occurs principally at the pontomedullary level, although the potential exists for contribution of the prejunctional mechanism. The inhibition of BVB might contribute to cardiovascular regulation associated with protection from atmospheric hazards.", 
    "117": "The effect of norepinephrine (NE) on cytokine-stimulated nitric oxide (NO) production by cardiac myocytes has not been previously reported. NE alone caused no significant increase in NO-2 levels over vehicle. Addition of NE to interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) significantly increased inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression, iNOS protein, and NO-2 production vs. IL-1beta alone. Addition of the alpha-adrenergic blocker prazosin or the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol partially reduced the NE-mediated increase in iNOS mRNA expression and NO-2 production. Addition of prazosin and propranolol together completely abolished the NE-induced increase in iNOS mRNA expression and NO-2 production. NE significantly enhanced mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity that was reduced by prazosin, propranolol, and PD-98059, a selective MAP kinase kinase inhibitor. Addition of PD-98059 reduced the NE-mediated increase in iNOS mRNA expression and NO-2 production. We report for the first time that NE enhances IL-1beta-stimulated NO production by activation of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors through a novel MAP kinase mechanism.",

Eight animals were studied in each group. Spectral analyses was performed using continuous BP time series obtained in conscious rats.", 
    "120": "Thyroxine treatment was sufficient to induce a significant degree of tachycardia (423+/-6 vs 353+/-4 bpm, P < 0.001, unpaired Student's t test), systolic BP elevation (142+/-3 vs 127+/-2 mmHg, P < 0.001) and cardiac hypertrophy (1.165+/-0.017 vs 1.006+/-0.012 g, P < 0.001). The intrinsic HR was markedly increased after treatment with thyroxine (497+/-16 vs 373+/-10 bpm, P < 0.05). Vagal tone was positively linearly related to intrinsic HR (r = 0.84, P< 0.01). Atenolol neither modified HR nor BP variability in rats with hyperthyroidism. The thyrotoxicosis was associated with a reduction of the 0.4 Hz component of BP variability (modulus 1.10+/-0.07 vs 1.41+/-0.06 mmHg, P < 0.01). Prazosin was without effect on this 0.4 Hz component in hyperthyroid animals.", 
    "121": "These data show a functional diminution of the vascular and cardiac sympathetic tone in early experimental hyperthyroidism.

    "122": "1. Ejaculatory problems and anorgasmia are well-known side-effects of the SSRI antidepressants, and a pharmacologically induced increase in serotonergic neurotransmission inhibits ejaculatory behaviour in the rat. In the present study the role of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors in the mediation of male rat ejaculatory behaviour was examined by use of selective agonists and antagonists acting at these 5-HT receptor subtypes. 2. The 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.25-4.00 micromol kg(-1) s.c.) produced an expected facilitation of the male rat ejaculatory behaviour, and this effect was fully antagonized by pretreatment with the new selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (R)-3-N,N-dicyclobutylamino-8-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-5 -carboxamide hydrogen (2R,3R) tartrate monohydrate (NAD-299) (1.0 micromol kg(-1) s.c.). NAD-299 by itself (0.75-3.00 micromol kg(-1) s.c.) did not affect the male rat ejaculatory behaviour. 3. The 5-HT1B receptor agonist anpirtoline (0.25-4.00 micromol kg(-1) s.c.) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the male rat ejaculatory behaviour, and this effect was fully antagonized by pretreatment with the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist isamoltane (16 micromol kg(-1) s.c.) as well as by the new and selective antagonist (R)-(+)-2-(3-morpholinomethyl-2H-chromene-8-yl)oxymethylmorphol ino methansulphonate (NAS-181) (16 micromol kg(-1) s.c.). Isamoltane (1.0-16.0 micromol kg(-1) s.c.) and NAD-181 (1.0-16.0 micromol kg(-1) s.c.) had no, or weakly facilitatory effects on the male rat ejaculatory behaviour. The non-selective 5-HT1 receptor antagonist (-)-pindolol (8 micromol kg(-1) s.c.), did not antagonize the inhibition produced by anpirtoline. 4. The present results demonstrate opposite effects, facilitation and inhibition, of male rat ejaculatory behaviour by stimulation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, respectively, suggesting that the SSRI-induced inhibition of male ejaculatory dysfunction is due to 5-HT1B receptor stimulation.", 
    "123": "Heart failure is a common clinical problem in patients with cardiovascular disease. Mortality remains high despite conventional therapy. The morbidity associated with heart failure accounts for numerous hospitalizations and significant health care expenditures. Therapy has been directed at relieving symptoms, augmenting exercise capacity, reducing hospitalizations and improving survival. Randomized clinical trials have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors achieve these therapeutic goals and exert a favourable influence on disease progression. Recent clinical trials evaluating metoprolol, bisoprolol and carvedilol have clearly established that judicious use of beta-adrenergic blockers in heart failure patients who have been stabilized favourably influences the natural history of the disease, even when given as additional therapy to patients already receiving ACE inhibitors. Carvedilol is a non-selective beta-adrenergic blocking drug with vasodilatory properties that has been recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with NYHA functional class II or III heart failure. It was the only agent to produce a statistically significant survival benefit in a pre-specified analysis that included all the patients randomized into the multicentre U.S. Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program, irrespective of disease aetiology. As with trials looking at ACE inhibitor therapy, studies involving beta-blocker therapy in patients with heart failure have evaluated the effects of these drugs on hospitalization, NYHA functional class, exercise capacity and survival. In the U.S. Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program, the risk of hospitalization for any cause was reduced by 29%, the risk of hospitalization for a cardiovascular cause was reduced by 28% and the risk of dying was reduced by 65%. Thus, carvedilol has been shown in randomized clinical trials to improve the quantity of life and, at least in terms of the incidence of hospitalization, to improve the qualify of life as well. Randomized trials have consistently reported a favourable change in NYHA functional class in patients treated with beta-adrenergic blocking drugs: the majority of patients became less symptomatic. In the U.S. Carvedilol trials, patients and physicians reported (separately) an improvement in global status, and less deterioration when treatment was randomized to carvedilol. The positive influence of such therapy is reflected in a reduction in hospitalizations. In summary, patients with NYHA class II or III who have been stabilized with ACE inhibitors and diuretics can expect an improvement in the quality as well as the quantity of life with beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "124": "Congestive heart failure is a severe condition responsible for 1%-2% of total health expenditure. In France, three-quarters of the medical cost of congestive heart failure, i.e. FF7 billion, is attributed to 150000 annual hospital admissions. But new treatments, especially ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, have demonstrated, through large controlled trials (SAVE, AIRE, US trials on carvedilol and CIBIS I) that these drugs can reduce mortality and hospitalization. These results, translated in terms of cost per life year saved, show that they are all very cost effective and could be cost saving, under some conditions.", 
    "125": "The aim of the present study was to establish a radioligand binding assay to selectively label the native 5-HT7 receptor expressed in rat brain. In rat whole brain (minus cerebellum and striatum) homogenate, (+/-)-pindolol (10 microM)-insensitive [3H]5-CT ([3H]5-carboxamidotryptamine; 0.5 nM) specific binding (defined by 5-HT, 10 microM) displayed a pharmacological profile similar to the recombinant 5-HT7 receptor, although the Hill coefficients for competition curves generated by methiothepin, ritanserin, sumatriptan, clozapine and pimozide were significantly less than unity. In homogenates of rat hypothalamus, (+/-)-pindolol (10 microM)-insensitive [3H]5-CT recognition sites also resembled, pharmacologically, the 5-HT7 receptor, although pimozide still generated Hill coefficients significantly less than unity. Subsequent studies were performed in the additional presence of WAY100635 (100 nM) to prevent [3H]5-CT binding to residual, possibly, 5-HT1A sites. Competition for this [3H]5-CT binding indicated the labelling in whole rat brain homogenate of a homogenous population of sites with the pharmacological profile of the 5-HT7 receptor. Saturation studies also indicated that (+/-)-pindolol (10 microM)/WAY 100635 (100 nM)-insensitive [3H]5-CT binding to homogenates of whole rat brain was saturable and to an apparently homogenous population of sites which were labelled with nanomolar affinity (Bmax=33.2+/-0.7 fmol mg(-1) protein, pKd=8.78+/-0.05, mean+/-S.E.M., n=3). The development of this 5-HT7 receptor binding assay will aid investigation of the rat native 5-HT7 receptor.", 
    "126": "Activation of spinal nicotinic receptors evokes a prominent algogenic response. Recently, epibatidine, a potent nicotinic agonist, was found to display an antinociceptive response after systemic administration. To examine the spinal component of this action, effects of three nicotinic agonists epibatidine, cytisine and nicotine--were given intrathecally (IT) and their antinociceptive activity was subsequently assessed. All agents elicited dose-dependent algogenic activity, characterized at lower doses by touch-evoked hyperactivity and at higher doses by intermittent vocalization and marked behavioral activity, with the rank order of potency being epibatidine > cytisine > nicotine. In addition, intrathecal epibatidine elicited a short-lasting, dose-dependent thermal antinociception. In contrast, the other nicotinic agonists at the highest usable dose failed to produce a significant antinociception. Mecamylamine, a nicotinic channel blocker, completely abolished the antinociceptive and algogenic responses of epibatidine. The competitive antagonist, alpha-lobeline, blocked both the analgesic and algogenic responses, but methyllycaconitine inhibited only the algogenic effects of epibatidine. Dihydro-beta-erythroidine, also a competitive antagonist, had no effect on the initial intense algogenic responses. The analgesic response to epibatidine was neither inhibited by naloxone nor by atropine. 2-Amino-5-phosphopentanoic acid, a competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, did not affect the analgesic response to intrathecal epibatidine or the intense initial algogenic response. Upon repeated administration (30-min interval), epibatidine (1 microg, IT) exhibited marked and rapid desensitization to both the analgesic and algogenic responses which recovered within 8 h. Pretreatment with two consecutive doses of cytisine (5 microg, IT, 30-min apart) inhibited the agitation and analgesic actions of intrathecal epibatidine. Thus, we contend that in addition to the typical nociceptive response elicited by spinal nicotinic agonists, intrathecal epibatidine also exhibits a pronounced but short-lasting antinociception. The analgesic and algogenic responses to intrathecal epibatidine may be mediated by distinct subtypes of spinal nicotinic receptors as suggested by the antagonist studies.",

    "132": "Ion exchange resins were incorporated into hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) matrix tablets to modify the release of oppositely charged drugs. The drug release from HPMC tablets containing drug-resin complexes was significantly slower than from HPMC tablets containing drug without resin. A physical mixture of drug and ion exchange resin (cationic drug, propranolol HCl, with the cation exchange resin, Amberlite IRP 69, or the anionic drug, sodium diclofenac, with the anion exchange resin, cholestyramine (Duolite ATP-143)) resulted in almost the same drug release as tablets containing preformed drug-resin complexes. Upon contact with the dissolution medium, a gel layer formed rapidly around the solid tablet core and the complex between the drug and the resin formed in situ within the gelled regions. No effect of pH of the dissolution medium (0.1 N HCl or pH 7.4 phosphate buffer) or resin counterion was observed with the strong cation exchanger, Amberlite IRP 69. The resin was dissociated at both pH-values, allowing drug binding. With the weak cation exchange resin, Amberlite IRP 88, in situ complex formation and retardation was only observed in pH 7.4 buffer but not in 0.1 N HCl because of the non-ionization of the carboxyl groups. The drug release depended also on the amount and particle size of the resin particles and the type of carrier. The use of smaller resin particles eliminated the burst release seen with larger resin particles. Upon comparing different carrier materials, a rapid formation of the gel layer was important for the in situ complex formation. The drug release was in the order of Gelucire 54/02 (glyceryl palmitostearate) > polyethylene oxide 400K > HPMC K15M.", 
    "133": "The beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors on cardiovascular remodelling from hypertension and ischemic disease may be due to the effect of these drugs on the proliferation/cell death balance. We therefore investigated the effect of the addition of captopril in vitro, on the onset of apoptosis in human vascular myocytes, by using a propidium iodide fluorescence analysis and a morphological analysis using the acridine orange technique. Captopril (0.23 mM) caused an increase in apoptotic phenomena that was more than 3. 5-fold than in controls both at the 24th (7.7 vs. 2%) and the 48th h (10.1 vs. 3.8%). The addition of propranolol strengthened the effect on apoptosis. The induction of apoptotic phenomena may be a mechanism by which ACE inhibitors affect cardiovascular remodelling and it might also explain the favorable effect these drugs have on diseases such as IgA nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy.",

In the case of the two polymer phases good extraction of all the test compounds from aqueous buffer was obtained over the pH range 2-10. On the C8 material, efficient extraction of the most polar acidic analyte, anisic acid, was only obtained between pH 2 and 6. The use of methanol water mixtures, or methanol water mixtures modified with either trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or triethylamine (TEA) as eluents was investigated for the recovery of the analytes following extraction. The use of TFA or TEA as ionic modifiers strongly influenced the efficiency of the elution step. The effect of a plasma matrix on extraction efficiency was also investigated, with the result depending upon the analyte. An approach to assessing the performance of the three phases has been developed based on the percentages of methanol in the eluent resulting in the recovery of 50% of the analyte, and in determining the difference between eluents giving recoveries of 10 and 90%.", 
    "139": "Hypertension is a very common condition among recipients of transplanted organs, and is often related to immunosuppressive therapy. In many transplant centres, calcium antagonists are often used as first-line antihypertensive drug therapy, not only because of efficacy in lowering blood pressure, but also because certain members of the class have a 'beneficial' drug-drug interaction with cyclosporin, which decreases the cost of administering this very expensive immunosuppressant. Diuretics are often used both for blood pressure and volume control, and some centres have used either alpha-beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and even beta-blockers with success in certain patients. The high frequency of perceived adverse effects of antihypertensive drugs in transplant recipients and the diversity of training of the specialist physicians involved in their care makes choice of traditional antihypertensive drug therapy in these patients a major challenge."
