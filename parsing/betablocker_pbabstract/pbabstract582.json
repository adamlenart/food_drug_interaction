    "0": "Changes in blood chemistry, especially blood glucose, were studied in rabbits developing tetanus after injection of tetanus toxin. Blood glucose levels increased significantly above control values after the animals developed tetanus. The increase in glucose level paralleled the depletion of liver glycogen, detected by means of PAS staining. The observed changes were not affected by adrenergic receptor block or catecholamine depletion by reserpine, suggesting non-mediation of the sympathetic nervous system in the response. A direct action of the toxin on the liver, initiating glycogen depletion, is being postulated.", 
    "1": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol stimulated cyclic AMP formation through independent receptors in isolated epithelial cells of rat ventral prostate. The specific beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol inhibited the stimulatory effect of isoproterenol but not that of VIP. Besides small differences in the efficiency of both agents, results indicated that isoproterenol was 500 times less potent than VIP. Acetylcholine did not modify the basal cyclic AMP levels but inhibited the accumulation of the cyclic nucleotide in the presence of either VIP or isoproterenol. The inhibitory action of muscarinic receptors was calcium-dependent. The coexistence of receptors for cholinergic, adrenergic and peptidergic agents which can regulate cyclic AMP suggests that the functions of prostatic epithelium may be interdependently controlled by multiple neural effectors.", 
    "2": "The aim of the present study was to investigate, whether concomitant administration of the synthetic glucocorticoid betamethasone (BM), theophylline (THEO), or the muscarinic antagonist ipratropium bromide (IPRA) could influence the desensitization-associated decrease of beta-adrenoceptors in the guinea pig lung during prolonged in vivo treatment with the beta 2-agonist terbutaline (TER). The animals were sacrificed 20 hrs after the last drug dosage and the lung membrane homogenates were prepared for 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) binding in vitro. Treatment with TER 200 micrograms/kg subcutaneously twice a day for five days decreased by 22% the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) at saturation in comparison with the saline-treated controls. Concomitant administration of BM 2 mg/kg intraperitoneally abolished this effect of TER, whereas THEO 20 mg/kg or IPRA 5 micrograms/kg failed to modify it. None of the in vivo treatments affected the binding affinity of 3H-DHA. In vitro, TER inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner 3H-DHA binding to the lung membranes of untreated guinea pigs. At high concentrations IPRA, but not THEO or BM, showed some binding to the beta-receptors as well. Thus, it is concluded that glucocorticoids may prevent beta-adrenoceptor desensitization in the lungs via an indirect mechanism, e.g. inhibition of phospholipase A2 enzyme.", 
    "3": "The positive inotropic responses of left atria and papillary muscles and the positive chronotropic responses of right atria of guinea-pigs to isoprenaline and forskolin were examined. An increase in sensitivity of the three preparations to isoprenaline was observed by lowering the bath temperature from 38 to 30 degrees C as demonstrated by a leftwards shift of the concentration-response curves. A similar degree of supersensitivity was observed for forskolin. Since forskolin is reputed to stimulate adenylate cyclase directly, whereas isoprenaline stimulates via the regulatory nucleotide Ns protein, this would suggest a common site for the supersensitivity at adenylate cyclase. However, the possibility that forskolin also stimulates via the Ns protein in producing cardiac stimulation and that this is the site of hypothermia-induced supersensitivity is discussed. Supersensitivity to isoprenaline was also observed in left atria and papillary muscles from guinea-pigs chronically pretreated with reserpine for 3 days (5 mg/kg at 72 h, 3 mg/kg at 48 and 24 h) or 7 days (0.1 mg/kg daily). In the same tissues, there was no change in the sensitivity to forskolin. The site of the supersensitivity can therefore be concluded to occur before the level of adenylate cyclase activation either directly or via the regulatory Ns protein; possibly at the beta-adrenoreceptor itself.", 
    "4": "The present study was undertaken to determine whether beta-adrenoceptors could be physiologically detected in the lung periphery and whether they were under tonic stimulation in the resting state in anesthetized dogs. A fiberoptic bronchoscope was wedged in a sublobar segment of lung in anesthetized male mongrel dogs for measurement of resistance through the collateral system (Rcs). beta-Agents were delivered locally as aerosols through the bronchoscope, and the response was evaluated by changes in Rcs. Distilled water alone produced a mean increase of 8.5 +/- 2.43% (SE) in Rcs at 2 min in six dogs, whereas dl-isoproterenol produced a mean decrease of 8.9 +/- 2.10% (P less than 0.03), thus demonstrating the presence of submaximally stimulated beta-receptors. To test whether the beta-receptors were under tonic stimulation, we compared the effect of aerosolized d- and dl-propranolol in 5 dogs. d-Propranolol that lacks significant beta-blocking activity and dl-propranolol both produced large transient increases in Rcs. However, with d-propranolol, Rcs had returned to base line at 15 min, whereas with dl-propranolol Rcs remained elevated at a mean of 20% above base line for greater than 2 h (P less than 0.01). Local timolol aerosol also produced a sustained increase in Rcs. After pretreatment with reserpine or after bilateral adrenalectomy, both d- and dl-propranolol still produced large transient increases in Rcs, but dl-propranolol no longer produced a sustained increase. Neither isoproterenol nor atropine affected Rcs in the presence of dl-propranolol, nor did pretreatment with atropine affect the response of Rcs to dl-propranolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "Retention of radiolabeled phospholipid vesicles instilled into the alveolar space was studied with the isolated perfused rat lung and quantitated by measuring the percent of instilled radioactivity remaining in lung after five lavages. With synthetic [14C]dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (PC):egg PC: phosphatidylglycerol:cholesterol (10:5:2:3) vesicles, there was a rapid (within 5 min) base-line retention of 10.3 +/- 0.25% (n = 11) followed by a slower phase of linear retention over the next 4 h. Retention at 2 h with perfused lungs was 18.6 +/- 0.60% (n = 9) and was similar to values obtained with lungs in vivo. Net retention (total minus base line) was stimulated 93% by isoproterenol, 173% by 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP), and 39% by 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate; propranolol blocked the effect of isoproterenol. The retention of natural (biosynthesized) surfactant [14C]PC was stimulated 92% by 8-Br-cAMP. The results suggest that the retention of exogenous phospholipid by the isolated perfused lung represents phospholipid uptake and that this process is under beta-adrenergic control. Secretion and uptake may be physiologically linked to regulate the concentration of surfactant on the alveolar surface.", 
    "6": "We investigated, in 36 healthy volunteers, the effects of prednisone and ketotifen on recovery of lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density (determined by (-)-125iodocyanopindolol binding) and responsiveness (assessed by lymphocyte cyclic AMP [cAMP] responses to 10 microM (-)-isoprenaline) after desensitization by the beta 2-agonist terbutaline. Terbutaline (3 X 5 mg/d) decreased lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density by approximately 40-50%; concomitantly, lymphocyte cAMP responses to 10 microM (-)-isoprenaline were significantly reduced. After withdrawal of terbutaline beta 2-adrenoceptor, density and responsiveness gradually increased, reaching predrug levels after 4 d. Prednisone (1 X 100 mg orally) accelerated beta 2-adrenoceptor recovery; only 8-10 h after administration of the steroid beta 2-adrenoceptor density and cAMP responses to (-)-isoprenaline had reached values not significantly different from pretreatment levels. Similar effects were obtained with ketotifen (2 mg; thereafter 2 X 1 mg/d for 4 d): 24 h after application of the drug beta 2-adrenoceptor density and cAMP responses to (-)-isoprenaline had reached pretreatment levels. Furthermore, ketotifen simultaneously applied with terbutaline completely prevented terbutaline-induced decrease in lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density and responsiveness. Prednisone (1 X 100 mg orally) or ketotifen (2 mg; thereafter 2 X 1 mg/d for 2 d) had no significant influence on lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density in healthy volunteers not pretreated with terbutaline, but shifted the ratio high-to-low affinity state of the lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor toward high affinity state. We conclude that glucocorticoids as well as ketotifen can accelerate recovery of density and responsiveness of lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors desensitized by long-term treatment with beta 2-agonists. Such an effect may have clinical implications for preventing tachyphylaxis of asthmatic patients against therapy with beta 2-agonists.", 
    "7": "The beta-adrenergic blocker dl-propranolol prevented a large proportion of regenerating rat liver cells from entering the mitotic phase of their first cell division cycle without affecting their ability to initiate or complete DNA replication. The drug, at a dose of 20 or 50 mg/kg of body weight, was most effective in reducing mitosis when injected between 1 and 2 hours after the proliferatively activating partial hepatectomy, which was 22 to 23 hours before the peak of DNA-synthetic activity. Propranolol also inhibited the early prereplicative surge of total liver cyclic AMP, which occurs shortly after partial hepatectomy, but this effect was not correlated to the mitosis-inhibiting activity. However, cyclic AMP or dibutyryl cyclic AMP completely reversed propranolol's mitosis-inhibiting action when injected between 1.5 and 2 hours (but not sooner or later) after partial hepatectomy, which was just before the total liver cyclic AMP content began to rise. Thus, there appears to be a transient, propranolol-inhibitable, probably cyclic AMP-initiated event in the early prereplicative development of rat hepatocytes that determines entry into mitosis rather than the initiation of DNA replication.", 
    "8": "In nine baboons (Papio papio) guide cannulae and electrodes were stereotaxically implanted into the medial basal or lateral hypothalamus, the anterior hypothalamus or the dorsal amygdala. Plasma GH responses were measured after microinfusion (1 microliter) of the alpha2 adrenergic agonist, clonidine, or the beta adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, or electrical stimulation, in each of these sites. Clonidine, 100 nmol/microliter, infused into the medial basal or lateral hypothalamus elevated plasma GH levels by 5-30 ng/ml, 30-45 min post-infusion. Plasma GH responses to clonidine infused into the anterior hypothalamus or the dorsal amygdala were all less than 10 ng/ml. The prior, intravenous, administration of piperoxane, 1.0 mg/kg prevented GH responses to clonidine. Propranolol, 50 nmol/microliter, infused into the dorsal amygdala consistently increased plasma GH levels by 5-15 ng/ml. Electrical stimulation of the medial basal or lateral hypothalamus elevated plasma GH levels by 7-35 ng/ml, 15-45 min post stimulation. Electrical stimulation of anterior hypothalamus or dorsal amygdala did not alter plasma GH levels. The stimulation of alpha 2 adrenergic receptors in the medial basal or lateral hypothalamus of the baboons appears to facilitate GH release.", 
    "9": "Enkephalins have peripheral vascular effects, and enkephalinergic innervation of the heart has been reported. To determine whether enkephalins have direct effects on myocardium, we studied the effects of [D-Ala2, Met5]enkephalinamide and [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]enkephalin on amplitude of contraction (measured with an optical-video system) in spontaneously beating monolayer cultures of chicken embryo ventricular cells, a preparation devoid of intact neural elements. [D-Ala2, Met5]enkephalinamide and [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]enkephalin as well as [Met5]- and [Leu5]enkephalin increased contractility in a concentration-dependent manner. The enkephalin-induced maximal contractile effects were 28% and 30% above control, with EC50 values of 0.53 and 0.17 microM for [D-Ala2, Met5]enkephalinamide and [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]enkephalin, respectively. The positive inotropic effect was antagonized by naloxone but not by propranolol, phentolamine, diphenhydramine, or cimetidine. Naloxone alone had no effect on contractility at a concentration (0.1 microM) that blocked positive inotropic effects of [D-Ala2, Met5]enkephalinamide and [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]enkephalin. To demonstrate the presence of opiate receptors, we studied [3H]naloxone binding in homogenates of cultured chicken embryo ventricular cells. Analysis of binding curves under equilibrium conditions indicated that [3H]naloxone bound specifically to membranes of cultured heart cells with KD = 18.5 +/- 5.4 nM and Bmax = 46.8 +/- 11.7 fmol/mg of protein. We conclude that enkephalins exert a direct positive inotropic effect on cultured heart cells, increasing contractile state via specific opiate receptors.", 
    "10": "The influence of the aromatic moiety of beta-adrenoceptor ligands on the affinity for the beta 2-adrenoceptor has been studied. Three classes of ligands have been examined, viz. N-isopropyl- and N-tert-butylphenylethanolamines and N-isopropylphenoxypropanolamines. Computer-assisted analysis of the inhibition by any of these ligands of the specific (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to the beta 2-adrenoceptors of a bovine skeletal muscle preparation in the presence of GppNHp (10(-4) M) yielded the affinities of these ligands at pH 7.5. The obtained values were adjusted for the amounts of cations present at this pH value. A significant correlation was found between the calculated lipophilicities and the experimentally determined affinities in the three classes. Furthermore, steric factors seem to play an important role, as these correlations were improved by the introduction of steric parameters for the aromatic substituents in the regression analyses. From the established equations it is concluded that the phenoxypropanolamine derivatives bind to the beta 2-adrenoceptor in a way different from that of the ligands in both ethanolamine classes.", 
    "11": "We have studied the contribution of neuronal and postjunctional dopamine (DA) receptors and of the DA1 and DA2 receptor subtypes to the blood pressure effects of DA and bromocriptine in the rabbit. The norepinephrine release rate, i.e., the rate of entry of endogenous norepinephrine into the plasma, was derived from the plasma level of endogenous norepinephrine and the plasma [3H]norepinephrine clearance. Bromocriptine (40 micrograms kg-1) lowered the norepinephrine release rate and the arterial blood pressure both in anesthetized rabbits and in pithed rabbits with electrically stimulated sympathetic outflow. These effects were antagonized by the selective DA2 antagonist domperidone but not by the selective DA1 antagonist SCH 23390. DA (10-160 micrograms kg-1 min-1) dose-dependently increased the norepinephrine release rate and caused only transient hypotension in anesthetized rabbits. However, after treatment with desipramine, DA did not change the norepinephrine release rate and produced a persistent fall in blood pressure. When DA and domperidone were given simultaneously to desipramine-treated rabbits, the hypotensive effect of DA was unchanged, but now DA increased the norepinephrine release rate. When DA and SCH 23390 were given simultaneously to desipramine-treated rabbits, DA failed to lower blood pressure and decreased the norepinephrine release rate. Propranolol did not change the effects of DA in desipramine-treated rabbits. These results suggest that bromocriptine decreases blood pressure by activating ganglionic and/or prejunctional, inhibitory DA2 receptors in the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. DA also activates these receptors, but in addition releases norepinephrine in the manner of an indirectly acting sympathomimetic amine and activates postjunctional vascular DA1 receptors, and the latter seems to be the main component in DA-induced hypotension.", 
    "12": "In normal man, converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) acutely increases plasma active renin and decreases plasma inactive renin. This reciprocal relationship suggests that conversion of inactive to active renin may be important in the acute response to stimulation of renin secretion. To determine whether the beta-adrenergic system or prostaglandins (PGs) participate in the acute effect of CEI on renin, we administered captopril (50 mg) alone and with either propranolol (P; 80 mg) or a PG cyclooxygenase inhibitor [PI; indomethacin (50 mg) or ibuprofen (800 mg)] to normal subjects ingesting a 25 meq/day Na diet. Supine blood pressure fell by 12 +/- 2 (+/- SE) mm Hg with CEI alone, 10 +/- 1 mm Hg with CEI plus P, and 7 +/- 1 mm Hg with CEI plus PI. Active renin rose 8-fold (P less than 0.01), with a peak at 1-2 h, after CEI and 3-fold (P less than 0.02) in response to CEI plus P or CEI plus PI. P did not block the fall in acid-activated inactive renin compared to CEI alone. The nadir of the inactive renin response to both CEI or CEI plus P occurred at 1-2 h. PI, however, prevented the fall in inactive renin. To extend this observation, we compared the effects of infusion of a vasodilator PG (PGA1; 0.6 micrograms/kg X min) and a pure beta-agonist (isoproterenol; 0.3 micrograms/kg X min). PGA1 increased active renin 2.5-fold and decreased inactive renin by 80% (both P less than 0.02), while isoproterenol increased active renin 4.1-fold, but did not significantly change inactive renin. These data suggest that the beta-adrenergic system and PGs at least acutely stimulate renin production at different steps of its biosynthesis or secretion.", 
    "13": "The effect of excess thyroid and thyroid plus propranolol on right and left ventricular structure was examined. Perfusion fixed hearts from untreated adults and those treated for 10 weeks with thyroid, propranolol, and thyroid plus propranolol were embedded in plastic and sectioned for light and electron microscopy. Hyperthyroidism stimulated a significant increase in heart rate, oxygen consumption, and systolic blood pressure. Propranolol was effective in normalizing the heart rate of hyperthyroid rats, but did not affect oxygen consumption or blood pressure. Both left and right ventricular weight increased similarly in thyroid and thyroid-propranolol treated animals, but right ventricular mass increased more than left ventricular mass in both groups. The majority (21 of 24) of right ventricles from thyroid and thyroid-propranolol treated animals had multifocal areas of histologically detected fibrosis. Left ventricular fibrosis was absent or minimal in both hyperthyroid groups. Neither left nor right ventricular fibrosis was observed in control or propranolol only treated animals. We conclude that beta adrenergic stimulation is unnecessary for thyroid induced cardiomegaly, and excess thyroid hormones induce right ventricular fibrosis which is not prevented by propranolol.", 
    "14": "The acute and chronic renal effects of the beta-adrenergic antagonists, alpha 1-adrenergic antagonists, central alpha 2-adrenergic agonists, and central and/or peripheral adrenergic-neuronal blocking agents are reviewed. In general, beta-adrenergic antagonists have little or no clinical effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow or renal blood flow (ERPF/RBF), renal vascular resistance (RVR), urinary sodium or potassium excretion, free water clearance, or body fluid composition. The alpha 1-adrenergic antagonists (prazosin and indoramin) have little or no clinical effect on GFR and ERPF/RBF; however, RVR is reduced. Sodium excretion is also reduced, leading to salt and water retention. The central alpha 2-adrenergic agonists (alpha-methyldopa, clonidine, and guanabenz) have little or no clinical effect on GFR and ERPF/RBF; however, RVR is reduced. Urinary sodium and potassium excretion and body fluid composition are unchanged. Free water clearance may be increased. The central and peripheral adrenergic-neuronal blocking agent reserpine has little or no clinical effect on GFR and ERPF/RBF; however, RVR is reduced. Urinary sodium, potassium, and water excretion and body fluid composition are unchanged. Finally, the peripheral adrenergic-neuronal blocking agents (guanadrel and guanethidine) decrease GFR and ERPF/RBF; RVR is also reduced. The filtered load and fractional excretion of sodium is decreased, producing expansion of body fluid spaces and weight gain.", 
    "15": "Several studies have attempted to assess the contribution of behavioral factors to coronary heart disease by relating the Type A behavior pattern to the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients undergoing coronary angiography. Although the earlier studies gave positive results, more recent results have been negative; overall the results are confusing. These differences cannot be easily explained by differences in study design. Possible confounding factors which may limit the usefulness of such studies include biased subject selection (approximately 70% of subjects were classified as Type A, and 70% had CAD) and the effects of beta blockers. Furthermore, other studies of similar design which have attempted to relate the three major risk factors to CAD have also yielded conflicting results: an association has been demonstrated consistently with cholesterol, less consistently with smoking, and not at all with hypertension. It is argued that such studies are not well suited to investigating relationships between behavioral factors and coronary heart disease.", 
    "16": "The potency and selectivity of the intrinsic beta-sympathomimetic activity (ISA) of dilevalol were studied with isolated guinea-pig trachea and pithed rat. This drug relaxed the contracture of isolated guinea-pig tracheal preparation induced by histamine in a dose-dependent manner. The dose-response curves of dilevalol and labetalol were shifted to the right with propranolol pretreatment. The relaxing potency of dilevalol was approximately 4.7 times more potent than that of labetalol. Dilevalol markedly reduced the diastolic blood pressure with only a slight increase of heart rate in pithed rats, while isoproterenol and pindolol caused moderate to marked positive chronotropic effects in proportion to their hypotensive effects. These results suggest that dilevalol has more potent ISA than labetalol and shows more beta 2-adrenoceptor selectivity than pindolol.", 
    "17": "The medicamentous treatment of the ischaemic heart disease with nitrates, beta-receptor blockers and calcium antagonists takes into account the in the ideal case evident pathomechanism and the essential principles of the effect of these groups of pharmaca. Apart from the influence on way of life and environmental factors at first the monotherapy is tried. As a rule, in individually possible full use of the dose a large part of the patients can sufficiently be improved. As to \"conventional therapy\", however, from the first the concerning the therapeutic mechanism favorable combination beta-receptor blocker and nitrates is understood. The increasing interest in calcium antagonists aprt from the increased application of these pharmaca in monotherapy led to the question of the combination with beta-receptor blockers and nitrates. Taking into consideration the different spectres of action of the calcium antagonists particularly in unstable angina pectoris, especially under haemodynamically controlled conditions a combination of three remedies is to be discussed. With regard to this there are no sufficient clinical experiences. At present there are no sufficient evidences for the superiority of this combination therapy.", 
    "18": "In coronary patients with relatively intact myocardial function, tobanum increases physical stress tolerance and produces positive central hemodynamic shifts, while myocardial contractility is depressed insignificantly. In patients with low myocardial functional reserve, these parameters, on the contrary, deteriorate, particularly during exercise. Combined use of tobanum and corinfar in patients with impaired myocardial contractility controls cardio- and hemodynamic shifts and increases physical stress tolerance.",

The calcium antagonists senzit and fenigidin were found to have high antianginal effect (44% and 78%, respectively) in patients with stable angina pectoris. It was found advisable to use the two drugs in combination with cardiac glycosides in patients with heart failure. A study showed the high antianginal effect of trasicor in postinfarction patients with refractory angina of effort.", 
    "20": "The effect of prolonged treatment with the beta-blocker trimepranol on left-ventricular function was assessed in patients who survived myocardial infarction. Pulmonary arterial catheterization with a floating catheter was used for hemodynamic investigation. Hemodynamic parameters were compared in the treated (20 patients) and control (20 patients matched for age and infarction site) groups. The treated patients showed a reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at rest, as well as stress-induced elevation of the pulmonary arterial pressure and peripheral resistance. Patients with pulmonary hypertension often demonstrated changes of the pressure curve in the pulmonary artery as a possible manifestation of stress-induced mitral regurgitation. Prolonged treatment with trimepranol is associated with increased incidence of pulmonary hypertension in myocardial infarction survivers. The clinical significance of this observation is yet to be established by further studies. Stress-induced mitral regurgitation associated with a mitral subvalvular dysfunction may occasionally be the cause of elevated pulmonary blood pressure.", 
    "21": "The informative value of various functional and laboratory diagnostic methods was reviewed in 150 patients with unstable angina (UA). High informativeness (92%) and sensitivity (83%) of isometric hand grip under computerized electrocardiographic monitoring was demonstrated for the diagnosis and control of treatment in these patients. Isometric loading brought out a dramatically reduced coronary reserve, latent heart failure and electrical instability of the myocardium. The cold test with a small area of skin exposure is of low diagnostic value in UA cases and cannot be recommended for clinical use. Serial myoglobin assays add to the accuracy of diagnosis and have high predictive value.", 
    "22": "Experience in the treatment of over 500 chronic coronary patients with various anti-anginal drugs or their combinations is summarized. Controlled (double blind) and open studies and acute pharmacologic tests demonstrated comparative efficacy of depot-nitrates, beta-blockers, oxyfedrine, cordaron, lidoflazinum, molsidamine (corvaton). The effects on exercise tolerance (bicycle ergometry) with isolated and combined use of the drugs are described. Indications for surgery are discussed.", 
    "23": "The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of adrenergic beta-blockers on agonistic behavior using quantitative ethological methods. In order to generate the agonistic behavior we employed the resident-intruder paradigm: An intruder male mouse is introduced into the home cage of a resident male mouse that has been cohabiting with a female for 5 weeks. The following drugs were administered orally to either resident or intruder mice: dl-Propranolol, oxprenolol, and carteolol. The injection-test interval was 60 min. Each test was recorded using a video TV monitor system, and at a later time several behavioral elements shown by both resident and intruder mice were measured. dl-Propranolol (5, 10, 20 mg/kg), oxprenolol (30, 50, 75 mg/kg), and carteolol (30, 50, 75 mg/kg) significantly suppressed the resident's aggressive episodes (offensive sideways posture, tail rattle, and attack bite) when resident mice were treated. By contrast, when intruder mice were treated with beta-blockers, aggressive episodes by untreated residents were not affected. The results suggest that dl-propranolol, oxprenolol, and carteolol have specific effects on the hostility of resident mice.", 
    "24": "The antihypertensive activity of terazosin, an investigational alpha 1-adrenergic-receptor blocker, and its effect on blood lipids were compared with placebo in a double-blind study. After a 3-week placebo baseline period, patients were randomized to receive terazosin (n = 22) or placebo (n = 16). The dose of terazosin was titrated over 2 weeks to a maintenance dosage of 10 mg once daily for 4 weeks. Antihypertensive efficacy was assessed: (1) at the end of the 24-hour dosing interval by comparing the average blood pressure (BP) after 3 and 4 weeks of maintenance therapy to the average BP after 2 and 3 weeks of placebo therapy, and (2) for 3 hours after drug ingestion at the final visit in comparison to the predose BP at that visit. At the end of the 24-hour dosing interval, 10 mg of terazosin reduced the mean supine systolic BP from 155.6 to 152.2 mm Hg and mean supine diastolic BP from 101.9 to 99.0 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). During the 3 hours after drug ingestion, mean supine systolic and diastolic pressures decreased maximally from 151.8 to 142.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and from 99.5 to 91.0 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) respectively. No supine BP reduction differed significantly from the placebo response. During terazosin therapy there was a nonsignificant increase in mean body weight of 1.4 +/- 2.9 kg and no change in blood lipids. Thus the drug demonstrated greater antihypertensive activity 1-3 hours after ingestion than at the end of the 24-hour dosing interval.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "The venodilating action of nipradilol was investigated by monitoring arterial blood pressure (BP), cardiac output (CO), heart rate (HR) and central venous pressure (CVP) in pithed rats treated with dihydroergotamine (DHE). DHE increased CVP and produced a simultaneous rise in BP and CO without appreciable changes in total peripheral resistance (TPR) and HR, indicating that DHE reduces venous capacity through venoconstriction. Nipradilol caused a fall in CVP, BP and CO without changing the TPR in the DHE-pretreated rat. By comparison, hydralazine reduced BP and TPR without changes in CO. Propranolol produced only a transient decrease in BP and TPR. These results indicate that nipradilol dilates venous capacitance vessels and thereby decreases cardiac filling pressure in animals with high venous tone, whereas hydralazine preferentially dilates resistance vessels.", 
    "26": "In order to elucidate possible mechanisms of the learning deficit produced by postnatal pretreatment with chlorpromazine (CPZ), changes in catecholamine receptors in the rat brain were investigated. Male neonates of Wistar strain rats were given s.c. 2 mg/kg/day of CPZ for 7 successive days from days 6 to 12 after birth. Effect of the postnatal pretreatment with CPZ on saturation constants for specific bindings of 3H-spiperone, 3H-WB 4101 and 3H-dihydroalprenolol, respectively, in 8 brain regions was investigated at 60 days after birth. Significant decreases in Bmax values of 3H-WB 4101 binding sites in the cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, mid brain and medulla oblongata/pons and decreases in Kd values of the binding sites in thalamus, hypothalamus and mid brain were observed in CPZ-pretreated rats when compared with corresponding Bmax and Kd values obtained in saline-pretreated rats. Furthermore, significant decreases in both Bmax and Kd values of 3H-DHA binding sites in the thalamus were detected in CPZ-pretreated rats when compared with those obtained in saline-pretreated rats. However, no alterations in 3H-spiperone binding sites in all brain regions were found between CPZ- and saline-pretreated rats. These results suggest that the learning deficit observed in CPZ-pretreated rats may be produced by a functional disorder of catecholaminergic, in particular alpha 1-noradrenergic neurons in the brain.", 
    "27": "Cardiac dysrhythmias occur in 60% or more of anaesthetized patients. While most are not immediately life-threatening, they are serious when 1) accompanied by atrioventricular (A-V) dyssynchrony and impaired myocardial performance, 2) a favourable myocardial oxygen balance is jeopardized, or 3) there is likelihood of progression to life-threatening dysrhythmias. Partial A-V dyssynchrony occurs with non-sinus origin supraventricular and A-V junctional rhythms, and complete A-V dyssynchrony with ventricular rhythms and advanced heart-block. Any tachydysrhythmia may increase the myocardial oxygen demand, and possibly reduce oxygen supply as well. Certain supraventricular tachydysrhythmias and most sustained ventricular rhythm disturbances are likely to predispose to life-threatening dysrhythmias. Thus, any cardiac rhythm disturbance should be of concern to the anaesthetist since it is a departure from normal and a sign of an untoward drug effect or altered physiological state. The purpose of this article is to summarize our current understanding of cardiac electrophysiological mechanisms, particularly how these apply to dysrhythmias that occur during anaesthesia, and to review the actions of, and indications for, antidysrhythmic drugs. A better understanding of electrophysiological mechanisms by anaesthetists should lead to improved patient management; hence, a reduced likelihood that dysrhythmias will occur that require specific drug or electrical management.",

Atropine blocked Oxo-tremor, an effect that was reversed by propranolol. Atropine pretreatment also antagonized the potentiating effect of propranolol on Oxo-tremor. Propranolol inhibited mice brain cholinesterase at doses which enhanced Oxo-tremor. Timolol and sotalol produced a dose-dependent antagonism of Oxo-tremor, whereas practolol failed to produce a similar effect. None of these three agents produced any significant enhancement of Oxo-tremor. These results suggest the involvement of a peripheral mechanism for the antagonism and a central cholinergic mechanism for the facilitation of Oxo-tremor by propranolol.", 
    "29": "The hypotensive effects of 4-(2-hydroxy-3-[(1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl)amino]propoxy)benzeneacetamide hydrochloride (KF-4317, a novel alpha- and beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker) were evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats and renal hypertensive dogs as well as in normotensive dogs, cats and rabbits, using various routes of administration. Single oral, intraduodenal and intravenous administrations of KF-4317 induced definite hypotensive effects. When intraduodenally given to anesthetized rabbits, KF-4317 elicited a much more prolonged effect on the blood pressure than labetalol, while neither atenolol nor propranolol showed hypotensive effects. Pretreatment with phentolamine abolished its depressor effect, but not its bradycardic effect, indicating that the former effect is mediated by alpha-blockade. When orally given to the conscious hypertensive rats and dogs, it exerted an extremely long-acting effect with a property of very gradual onset of action. Furthermore, KF-4317 neither showed any sign indicative of orthostatic hypotension in an experimental model nor exhibited any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, though a very weak local anesthetic effect was observed. From these results, it could be concluded that KF-4317 possesses some pharmacological properties similar to labetalol, but in contrast to labetalol it is beta 1-selective, and it may be useful in the treatment of patients with hypertension.", 
    "30": "There is increasing evidence implicating thromboxane A2 (TxA2) in vascular disease. Adrenergic blocking agents have been used with success in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to determine whether adrenergic blocking agents had any effect on the production of TxA2 and prostacyclin (PGI2) from whole blood in vitro. Fresh whole blood without anticoagulant was placed in glass tubes containing either drug or vehicle, the latter acting as control, and allowed to clot at 37 degrees C for 30 minutes. The serum PGI2 metabolites (PGI2M) and TxB2 (the stable hydration product of TxA2) were determined by radioimmunoassay. Labetalol, pindolol and propranolol all inhibited both PGI2M and TxB2 production in a dose dependent manner, while atenolol had no effect. Labetalol was the most potent significantly inhibiting TxB2 production at a drug concentration compatible with that found in-vivo. This inhibitory effect on TxB2 production may be of benefit in the treatment of vascular disease.", 
    "31": "We compared the ocular-hypotensive efficacy and systemic and ocular safety of an ophthalmic solution of levobunolol (0.5% and 1%) twice daily, with timolol (0.5%) twice daily in a long-term double-masked study of 391 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Patients received the test medication in both eyes for up to two years. Over the two-year period, both concentrations of levobunolol reduced mean IOP by 27% (range, -6 to -8 mmHg). This ocular-hypotensive effect was sustained throughout the study and was similar to that produced by timolol. Slight decreases in mean heart rate and blood pressure were observed. No unexpected adverse ocular or systemic reactions were reported. The results of these studies indicate that levobunolol is an effective therapy for the long-term treatment of glaucoma.", 
    "32": "The properties of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in right and left atria of rat heart, and their roles in mediating chronotropic and inotropic responses to beta-adrenoceptor agonists were examined. [125I](-)pindolol (125IPIN) bound saturably and specifically to a single class of high affinity sites in homogenates of both right and left atria. The k1's for association in right and left atria were 6.5 X 10(9) l/mol-min and 2.3 X 10(9) l/mol-min respectively, while the k-1's for dissociation were 0.20 min-1 and 0.17 min-1. The kinetically determined KD's were 75 pmol/l in right and 30 pmol/l in left atria and were similar to the equilibrium KD's determined from Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms of specific 125IPIN binding. Inhibition of 125IPIN binding by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was stereoselective and the order of potency was timolol greater than l-propranolol greater than d-propranolol greater than sotalol. Inhibition by beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor subtype selective antagonists yielded flat displacement curves with low Hill coefficients. Nonlinear regression analysis of displacement by beta 1-selective (practolol, atenolol and metoprolol) and beta 2-selective (ICI 118,551) antagonists gave estimates of the proportion of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors present in rat atria. Right atria contained 67 +/- 4.2% beta 1- and 33 +/- 4.2% beta 2-adrenoceptors, while left atria contained 67 +/- 2.8% beta 1- and 33 +/- 2.8% beta 2-adrenoceptors. Increases in the rate of spontaneously beating right atria and the force of electrically driven left atria caused by beta-adrenoceptor agonists were also measured. pA2 values for non-subtype selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in inhibiting isoprenaline-induced increases in rate and force were highly correlated with KD values determined for specific 125IPIN binding. pA2 values for beta 1- and beta 2-selective antagonists in inhibiting isoprenaline-induced increases in rate and force correlated well with the pKD values of these drugs in binding to beta 1-adrenoceptors, but not with the pKD values in binding to beta 2-adrenoceptors. Dose-response curves for stimulation of both rate and force by the beta 2-selective agonists procaterol and zinterol were shifted to a much greater extent by selective blockade of beta 1-adrenoceptors with metoprolol than by selective blockade of beta 2-adrenoceptors with ICI 118,551, suggesting that these compounds caused their effects by activating beta 1-adrenoceptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "34": "The response of the guinea-pig distal colon to distension and drugs expected to interfere with neural control of contractile activity were investigated in urethane anaesthetized animals and compared to results obtained in the isolated preparation. Under urethane anaesthesia bout 50% of the unloaded preparations had no detectable contractile activity. However these preparations contracted in response to topical acetylcholine. Saline distension induced the appearance of a phasic contractile activity in 'quiescent' preparations and enhanced amplitude of contractions in previously active ones. Atropine (1 mg/kg i.v.) reduced tone and transiently suppressed phasic contractile activity of the distal colon. When phasic contractile activity resumed a second dose of atropine had no further inhibitory effect. Topical physostigmine (20 micrograms in 0.1 ml) produced a marked and long lasting increase in tone paralleled by a marked enhancement in amplitude of the phasic contractile activity. These excitatory effects of topical physostigmine were suppressed by intravenous atropine (1 mg/kg). Hexamethonium (20 mg/kg i.v.) produced a sudden and transient increase in tone and suppressed DMPP (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) but not noradrenaline (2 micrograms/kg i.v.) induced relaxations. Propranolol (2 mg/kg i.v.) or phentolamine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) transiently increased tone of the guinea-pig distal colon and suppressed noradrenaline induced relaxations. DMPP induced relaxations were reduced by propranolol plus phentolamine. Topical tetrodotoxin (50 micrograms in 0.1 ml) had an overall slight excitatory effect on phasic contractile activity of the in vivo preparation. The effects of i.v. atropine, hexamethonium, phentolamine or propranolol on tone and spontaneous activity were prevented by pretreatment with tetrodotoxin. Isolated segments of guinea-pig distal colon exhibited a fairly regular spontaneous phasic contractile activity whose amplitude was increased by stretching of the preparation. Atropine (3 microM) produced a transient inhibition while hexamethonium (40 microM) had no effect on spontaneous contractile activity. Tetrodotoxin (0.5 microM) had both inhibitory and excitatory effects on tone and spontaneous activity of the preparation. At steady state amplitude of contractions was enhanced (15-30% increase) by tetrodotoxin. DMPP (1-100 microM) first induced a phasic contraction and then suppressed transiently the spontaneous activity of the isolated preparation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "35": "The effect of amosulalol on the accumulation of radioactivity from [3H]-noradrenaline and on the subsequent spontaneous and nerve stimulation-evoked outflow of radioactivity have been investigated in the rat isolated right ventricle. In addition the effect of amosulalol on the contractions of the electrically-driven directly muscle stimulated rat right ventricle to isoprenaline and of the rat isolated aorta to phenylephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine are reported. Amosulalol at 10(-6)M did not prevent the accumulation of radioactivity from a solution containing [3H]-noradrenaline. The spontaneous outflow of radioactivity, following loading of the ventricle with [3H]-noradrenaline, was increased by amosulalol at 10(-6)M by a cocaine- and idazoxan- insensitive mechanism. The nerve stimulation-evoked outflow of radioactivity was increased by amosulalol (10(-6)M), cocaine (10(-5)M) and idazoxan (10(-7)M). The ability of amosulalol to increase nerve-evoked outflow was maintained in the presence of cocaine but prevented by pretreatment with idazoxan. This suggests that amusulalol is an alpha 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist. The contractile response of the electrically-driven directly muscle stimulated right ventricle to isoprenaline were inhibited by amosulalol at 10(-7) and 10(-6)M with apparent pA2 values of 7.5 and 8.1, respectively. It is suggested that amosulalol at 10(-6)M may have an action additional to beta 1-adrenoreceptor antagonism on the right ventricle. The contractile responses of the rat aorta to phenylephrine were inhibited by amosulalol at 10(-7) and 10(-6)M with a pA2 of 8.6 which was independent of concentration. Amosulalol also reduced the magnitude of the maximal responses of the aorta to 5-hydroxytryptamine.", 
    "36": "The hemodynamic response to submaximal exercise was investigated in 38 mongrel dogs with healed anterior wall myocardial infarctions. The dogs were chronically instrumented to measure heart rate (HR), left ventricular pressure (LVP), LVP rate of change, and coronary blood flow. A 2 min coronary occlusion was initiated during the last minute of an exercise stress test and continued for 1 min after cessation of exercise. Nineteen dogs had ventricular fibrillation (susceptible) while 19 animals did not (resistant) during this test. The cardiac response to submaximal exercise was markedly different between the two groups. The susceptible dogs exhibited a significantly higher HR and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) but a significantly lower left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) in response to exercise than did the resistant animals. (For example, response to 6.4 kph at 8% grade; HR, susceptible 201.4 +/- 5.1 beats/min vs. resistant 176.2 +/- 5.6 beats/min; LVEDP, susceptible 19.4 +/- 1.1 mmHg vs. resistant 12.3 +/- 1.7 mmHg; LVSP, susceptible 136.9 +/- 7.9 mmHg vs. resistant 154.6 +/- 9.8 mmHg.) beta-Adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol reduced the difference noted in the HR response but exacerbated the LVP differences (response to 6.4 kph at 8% grade; HR, susceptible 163.4 +/- 4.7 mmHg vs. resistant 150.3 +/- 6.4 mmHg; LVEDP susceptible 28.4 +/- 2.1 mmHg vs. resistant 19.6 +/- 3.0 mmHg; LVSP, susceptible 122.2 +/- 8.1 mmHg vs. resistant 142.8 +/- 10.7 mmHg). These data indicate that the animals particularly vulnerable to ventricular fibrillation also exhibit a greater degree of left ventricular dysfunction and an increased sympathetic efferent activity.", 
    "37": "One hundred patients scheduled for surgery participated in a randomized double-blind trial designed to evaluate the effects of acute treatment with two doses of bopindolol (1 mg:BP1;2 mg:BP2) in comparison with those of 2.5 mg lorazepam (LR), 75 mg butalbital (BT) and placebo (PL). Anxiety was evaluated by the STAI X1 questionnaire on the day before surgery, in the late afternoon (time 0: basal) and in the evening (time 1). At the same times patients were requested to play a game of manual skill called \"Go Down\". The next day, in the morning (time 2), the patients were given the same questionnaire and were asked a series of questions about their sleep and awakening. Mean anxiety scores were significantly increased over basal values at both time 1 and time 2 in the PL and LR groups and at time 2 in the BT group, but neither in the BP1 nor in the BP2 group. The time needed to perform the \"Go Down\" test was significantly shorter than the basal value for both BP groups and significantly longer for the BT group, while nonsignificant modifications occurred in the PL and LR groups. Positive effects were obtained in patients treated with BP, at both doses, on ease of \"falling asleep\", number of \"night awakenings\" and \"reawakening mood\" while LR and BT were mostly ineffective, except for BT on ease of \"falling asleep\". It was concluded that a beta-blocker such as bopindolol may be more effective than a benzodiazepine or a barbiturate for the prevention of anxiety symptoms induced by a clearly defined stress situation, such as awaiting a surgical operation.", 
    "38": "Isolated opercular epithelia of killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) were mounted in an Ussing chamber. The epithelia displayed a transepithelial electrical potential difference (PD) of 10.6 +/- 0.3 mV (sea-water side negative) and a short-circuit current (SCC) of 72.1 +/- 2.1 microA cm-2. The electrical resistance was 160 +/- 3 omega cm2 (mean +/- SE, n = 269). The unidirectional flux of 36Cl from blood side to sea-water side compared well with the SCC. No net flux of 22Na or 24Na across the epithelium was observed. Raising of cyclic AMP levels by theophylline, 3-isobutyl-I-methyl-xanthine, isoprenaline and forskolin, increased SCC and PD. Prostaglandins PGE2 and to some extent PGF2 alpha inhibited SCC and PD. Inhibition of Na+-K+-ATPase by ouabain and orthovanadate reduced SCC and PD. Pretreatment of the epithelium with the stilbene disulphonic acid (DIDS) did not prevent the action of orthovanadate. Different types of diuretics were tested, but only the loop diuretics bumetanide, piretanide, and furosemide, rapidly and strongly inhibited PD and SCC and unidirectional 36Cl serosal to mucosal flux. Dose-response curves for these agents were parallel and EC50 values for effects on SCC were 40, 52, and 295 microM, respectively. The same relative activities of these diuretics have been seen in the renal thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TALH). It is concluded that the killifish opercular skin responds to hormonal stimuli and various pharmacological agents in a manner similar to that of mammalian renal TALH. It should therefore be a useful model for studies of the modes of action and the structure-activity relationships of diuretics which act by inhibition of chloride transport or Na+-K+-ATPase activity.", 
    "39": "Glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) and Triglyceride lipase (TGL) were measured in homogenates from non-ischaemic and ischaemic tissue from the isolated perfused rat heart. Ischaemia was produced by occlusion of the left descending coronary artery for 10 min. Compared to activities measured in tissue from normally perfused hearts, GPAT activity measured in tissue from the ischaemic area was considerably reduced. TGL activity in the ischaemic area was markedly increased compared to activity measured in normally perfused hearts. No change was seen in GPAT or TGL activity measured in tissue from the non-ischaemic area. The change in activities produced by ischaemia were prevented by pre-perfusion with the cardio-selective beta-antagonist Atenolol. Reperfusion of the ischaemic area resulted in TGL activity returning to the value measured in tissue from normally perfused hearts. However, GPAT activity, after 1 min of reperfusion, fell to a value lower than after 10 min ischaemia. The reperfusion-induced fall in GPAT activity was prevented by pre-perfusion with the alpha 1 antagonist Doxasozin. Pre-perfusion of the alpha 2 antagonist Yohimbine resulted in a prolongation of the increased TGL activity in the ischaemic area during reperfusion. All changes in enzyme activities were prevented by injection of 6 OH-dopamine 24 h before hearts were removed. These changes in enzyme activities show that during ischaemia there is an increased beta-adrenergic drive. On reperfusion the beta-adrenergic drive is removed but an alpha 1 adrenergic drive becomes apparent.", 
    "40": "Recent clinical trials in hypertension report more deaths due to coronary heart disease in mild hypertensives who received aggressive antihypertensive drug therapy and achieved better blood pressure control. Subset analyses of these trials suggest that diuretic therapy may have contributed to this outcome, possibly through a reduction in serum potassium or an elevation in serum lipids. Because of this, patients with an abnormal pretreatment electrocardiogram, history of myocardial infarction, unstable coronary heart disease, or diuretic-induced hyperlipidemia or hypokalemia unresponsive to management are candidates for alternative antihypertensive agents. A review of the literature suggests that most of the currently available beta-blockers, the alpha 1-antagonist prazosin, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, and the vasodilator hydralazine are effective alternatives to thiazide therapy in the initial management of hypertension and are recommended for particular subgroups of patients. Monotherapy with the centrally and peripherally acting sympatholytic agents is not recommended because of the frequent side effects encountered and the inferior hypotensive efficacy reported. Calcium channel blocking agents also appear to be suitable alternatives to thiazides in hypertension, but more experience with these is needed. Alternative pharmacologic agents may be selected on the basis of age, and, to a lesser extent, race.", 
    "41": "To assess the efficacy of long-term diltiazem therapy when added to beta blockers and nitrates, we prospectively studied patients with chronic exertional angina who were determined to have medically refractory angina pectoris which was too severe to enter placebo-controlled studies. The mean follow-up time was 24.6 months (8-47 months) and all patients were seen every 2-4 months. Angina frequency decreased from a prediltiazem frequency of 9.5 episodes per week (1-40 per week) to 3.3 attacks per week (0-21 per week) at 6 months and 3.3 attacks per week (0-40 per week) at the patients's last evaluation. Similar reductions in nitroglycerin consumption were reported. Five patients had an increase in angina frequency during the mean 24.6 months of follow-up, which necessitated coronary bypass surgery, 8, 10, 12, 19, and 23 months after study entry, respectively. Diltiazem daily dosage ranged from 120 to 480 mg/day, the mean daily dose was 298 mg/day. Twenty (65%) patients remained on beta-blocker therapy and 19 (61%) patients on nitrate therapy in an effort to achieve a completely pain-free state. New cardiovascular events were documented in 3 patients during the follow-up period, with one patient having an uncomplicated myocardial infarction at 6 months, one patient hospitalized for prolonged chest pain at 2 months, and one patient dying following cardioversion for unrelated atrial fibrillation at 14 months poststudy entry. Adverse effects were reported during 19 of the 354 patient visits, but no patient had to stop therapy because of these. Sinus bradycardia required reduction of beta-blocker dosage in three patients and prolonged PR interval was observed in two additional patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Twenty-four hours after the last exposure to stress crude synaptosomes isolated from the whole brain demonstrated an increase in the KD of 3H-dihydroalprenolol specific binding and a lowering of the Bmax of 3H-WB-4101 specific binding sites. Specific binding of 3H-flunitrazepam changes inconclusively: the decrease in the KD is followed by a reduction in the concentration of receptors. Specific binding of 3H-imipramine by brain membranes remains unchanged under the above conditions.", 
    "43": "The effects of a 21 infusion of isotonic sodium chloride on renal haemodynamics and sodium excretion were measured in nine normotensive volunteers. Changes in these responses to volume expansion induced by cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade by drugs with (epanolol) and without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (atenolol) were examined. Renal plasma flow was significantly lower before, during and after sodium chloride infusion whilst on treatment with atenolol compared with epanolol. Urinary sodium excretion was lower on atenolol than epanolol. Glomerular filtration rate was unchanged by either drug. Basal urinary kallikrein excretion was diminished by atenolol and both epanolol and atenolol inhibited the rise in urinary kallikrein excretion after sodium chloride infusion. Although some of these findings may be due to a more potent hypotensive effect of atenolol, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may contribute to the apparent protective effects of epanolol on renal function.", 
    "44": "Adrenoceptor subtypes have been localized in human lung by an autoradiographic method, using [125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) to label beta-receptors in tissue sections. The ICYP was incubated with cryostat sections of microscopically normal human lung method on microscope slides for 2 h at 37 degrees C. Nonspecific binding was determined by incubating adjacent serial sections in the presence of 200 microM (-)-isoproterenol. Specific binding, which accounted for greater than 90% of total counts bound to the sections, was saturable, of high affinity, and stereoselective, having the same pharmacologic characteristics as binding to homogenates prepared from the same lungs. Competition with selective beta-receptor antagonists ICI 118,551 (beta 2-selective) and betaxolol (beta 1-selective) showed that the ratio of beta 2 to beta 1-receptors in the sections was approximately 3:1. Autoradiography revealed that beta-receptors were widely distributed, with dense labeling over airway epithelium, alveolar walls, and submucosal glands, and a lower density of grains over airway and vascular smooth muscle. The beta-receptors of airway smooth muscle from large and small airways were entirely of the beta 2-receptor subtype, which is consistent with functional studies. Similarly, beta-receptors of airway epithelium and vascular smooth muscle were also entirely of the beta 2-receptor subtype. In bronchial submucosal glands and alveolar walls, both receptor subtypes appeared to coexist with beta 2-receptors, making up 10% of the total in glands and 30% in alveoli. The significance of beta 1- and beta 2-receptors in alveolar walls (which account for greater than 90% of total beta-receptors in human lung) remains to be determined.", 
    "45": "The properties of the binding of [125I]iodopindolol ([125I]IPIN) to beta adrenergic receptors on plasma membranes prepared from right atrial tissue removed during cardiac bypass surgery were investigated. Some of the patients from whom the tissue was removed had been treated before surgery with either a beta adrenergic receptor antagonist or a calcium entry blocker or both. The specific binding of [125I]IPIN to beta adrenergic receptors was saturable, stereoselective and rapidly reversible. Studies of the inhibition of the specific binding of [125I]IPIN by drugs selective for beta-1 or beta-2 adrenergic receptors suggested that both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors are present in the tissue, with approximately 55% of the receptors having the properties of beta-2 adrenergic receptors. The density of receptors in patients not treated with beta adrenergic receptor antagonists or calcium entry blockers was approximately 80 fmol/mg of protein, whereas the density of beta adrenergic receptors in treated patients was increased by approximately 50%. The relative proportion of beta-1 to beta-2 adrenergic receptors in subjects treated with beta adrenergic receptor antagonists and/or calcium entry blockers was not significantly different from that in untreated subjects. Studies were also carried out with a limited number of samples of human ventricular muscle obtained from untreated subjects at the time of surgery. The density of receptors was lower than that observed in studies with atrial tissue. However, as with atrial tissue, approximately half of the receptors appeared to be beta-2 adrenergic receptors.",

    "47": "Digital vasospastic phenomena have been reported to result from use of nonselective and cardioselective beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking drugs. The effects of 80 mg/day propranolol and 100 mg/day metoprolol on finger hemodynamics and clinical responses were compared with those of placebo in 16 patients with Raynaud's phenomenon. A double-blind, 2 week crossover study design was used with a 2 week washout placebo period between drugs. Total fingertip blood flow (FBF) as determined by venous occlusion plethysmography, fingertip capillary flow (FCF) as determined by radioisotope disappearance rate, and finger systolic blood pressure (FSP) were measured in a 28.3 degrees and a 20 degrees C room at the end of each period. Subjects kept diaries to record vasospastic attacks. There were no significant changes in FBF, FCF, or FSP in the warm or cool environment during drug treatment as compared with during the placebo period. A decrease in pulse rate occurred with both drugs and there was a decrease in blood pressure with metoprolol. There were no significant changes in the number of vasospastic attacks or in the patients' overall evaluation of their conditions while they were receiving the drugs. It is concluded that the presence of Raynaud's phenomenon is not a contraindication to the use of beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking drugs in the normotensive population.", 
    "48": "The interaction of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (BAB drugs) with isolated mast cells resulted, according to the compound, in either a liberation of biogenic amines or an inhibition of stimulated amine release. The liberatory drugs exaprolol and K\u00f6 1124 decreased the level of cAMP, stimulated the activity of cyclic nucleotide-phosphodiesterase, decreased the incorporation of orthophosphate into membrane phospholipids and rapidly displaced calcium from binding sites in mast cells. The inhibitory drugs alprenolol, metipranolol, oxprenolol, practolol and propranolol, possessing lower liposolubility, produced opposite effects. Drugs from both groups displaced histamine from binding sites in isolated mast cell granules. The interaction of BAB drugs with mast cells is a result of non-specific rather than specific receptor interactions. Inhibitory drugs interfere with mast cells at membrane sites while liberatory drugs penetrate the membrane, thus acting both at the level of membrane and intracellularly.", 
    "49": "The TX pacemaker uses a conventional transvenous electrode to sense T-waves of paced ventricular complexes and it adapts the pacing rate to varying physiological demands by responding to changes in the QT or, more correctly, the stimulus artifact-to-T-wave (stimulus-T) interval. This pacing system was assessed in 13 patients. The relation between heart rate and stimulus-T interval and the effect of programming on the performance of this pacemaker were studied on several occasions in each patient. Treadmill exercise performance during TX pacing mode was compared with atrial synchronized ventricular (VAT) and asynchronous ventricular demand (VOO and VVI--70 beats per minute) pacing modes. T-wave sensing problems arose in three patients. In one, this was overcome by reducing the pulse amplitude from 5.0 to 2.5 V. In another patient, spontaneous recovery of T-wave sensing occurred 5 months after pacemaker implantation. T-wave sensing deteriorated with the passage of time in most patients. Satisfactory rate response as assessed by treadmill exercise testing and Holter monitoring was achieved in 12 patients through adjustments of two programmable parameters: the slope that defines the alteration in heart rate in response to a millisecond change in stimulus-T interval and the \"sensing window\" that is the interval during which T-waves can be sensed and a rate response is possible. Exercise performance was significantly better during rate responsive pacing (TX) mode as compared with VVI pacing but was comparable to that during VAT pacing. The resting heart rate/stimulus-T interval can be described by the following linear regression equation: stimulus-T interval = 466 - 1.68 X paced-rate, r2 = -0.62. This relation, however, was subject to wide inter- and intra-patient variation. Consequently, given identical programmed parameters and exercise protocol, the chronotropic response differed significantly from patient to patient and in the same patient from one occasion to another. Our results show that a physiologically beneficial chronotropic response can be achieved in most patients. However, reprogramming, based on results of exercise tests and Holter monitoring, may be necessary to adjust for changes in T-wave sensing and the heart rate/stimulus-T interval relation and, thus to ensure that the pacemaker continues to function optimally.",

    "52": "Infusion of neurotensin, substance P and methionine-enkephalin induces colonic contraction in the cat. The present study was performed to investigate the effect of various pharmacological blocking agents on colonic contraction evoked by these peptides infused by the i.a. or i.v. route. The contractions caused by infusions of neurotensin were blocked by tetrodotoxin (1 micrograms kg-1 i.a.), hexamethionium (10 mg kg-1 i.v.), atropine (0.1 mg kg-1 i.v.) or somatostatin (100 pmol min-1 i.a.), but not by haloperidol, methysergide, mepyramine, cimetidine or naloxone. The contractile effect of substance P on the colon was abolished by the substance P receptor antagonist (D-Arg1, D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9, Leu11)-substance P (70 nmol min-1 i.a.). No other blockers used, such as tetrodotoxin, hexamethonium, atropine, mepyramine, cimetidine, methysergide, naloxone or somatostatin inhibited the response to substance P. Methionine-enkephalin produced a colonic contraction that was completely blocked by naloxone (1 mg kg-1 i.a.). Both atropine (0.1 mg kg-1 i.v.) and somatostatin (100 pmol min-1 i.a.) reduced the contractile response. However, tetrodotoxin, hexamethonium, mepyramine, cimetidine and methysergide did not affect the response to methionine-enkephalin. All adrenergic blockers tested, that is, guanethidine, propranolol and phentolamine, increased the contractile responses to the peptides. The results indicate that the colonic contraction induced by neurotensin is mediated via nervous cholinergic pathways. Substance P induces colonic contraction, probably by a direct effect on smooth muscle substance P receptors. Methionine-enkephalin induces colonic contraction which could be blocked by naloxone. However, a cholinergic or peptidergic link may also be involved in the response to methionine-enkephalin.", 
    "53": "In this study of 10 patients with essential hypertension inadequately controlled by standard beta-blocker-diuretic combination therapy, the addition of 5 mg of MDL-899, a peripheral arteriolar vasodilator, resulted in significant reductions in blood pressure, both supine and standing, which was maximal 4-8 h after dosing, with no additional orthostatic component. There were associated small rises in heart rate but no evidence of significant activation of the sympathetic or renin-angiotensin systems. Six patients continued for 4 weeks receiving MDL-899 twice daily with significant improvement in their blood pressure control--from a mean of 182/95 to 146/77 mm Hg (supine) and from 161/93 to 138/79 mm Hg (erect). These six patients experienced no significant side effects, but four patients were unable to proceed with the study as a result of adverse effects, particularly headache, following the first few doses. It seems likely that these side effects are dose related. In a combined drug regimen, MDL-899 is an effective vasodilator drug that significantly improved the blood pressure control of patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "54": "Nicardipine, a new 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium-entry blocker, was assessed for cardiovascular effects against nifedipine and verapamil in anesthetized open-chest beagle dogs, in the absence and presence of beta-adrenoceptor blockade (propranolol 1 mg/kg i.v.). In control conditions, intravenous nicardipine and nifedipine (30 nmol/kg) produced decreases in blood pressure of similar magnitude without evidence of cardiodepression. An equihypotensive dose of verapamil (300 nmol/kg), by contrast, induced long-lasting negative chronotropic and inotropic effects, which, when combined with the effects of propranolol, were so marked as to cause the death of two of five dogs (atrioventricular block). Dihydropyridine derivatives at higher doses (100 nmol/kg) produced different responses: nifedipine depressed cardiac performance significantly more than nicardipine and, in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade, caused the death of three of six dogs due to cardiovascular failure. In the nicardipine group, on the contrary, cardiac function was adequately preserved even in the presence of beta-blocker, and no animals died. The results of the present study confirm a previous in vitro observation: nicardipine is a calcium-entry blocker devoid of remarkable cardiodepressant effects and particularly selective for the vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "55": "The forearm arterial effects of enalapril and propranolol were compared by means of pulsed Doppler velocimetry in 28 patients with hypertension after treatment for 3-6 months. Enalapril decreased blood pressure, increased both brachial artery diameter and blood flow, decreased vascular resistance, and increased the arterial compliance of the forearm. Propranolol also decreased blood pressure but did not produce any other changes. It may be concluded that the treatment of hypertension with enalapril, but not propranolol, is associated with dilatation effects on the arterial circulation of the forearm.", 
    "56": "The hemodynamic effects of tetramethylpyrazine were examined in 27 anesthetized open chest dogs with electromagnetic flowmeter probes on the left circumflex coronary artery and ascending aorta. Tetramethylpyrazine, 2-15 mg/kg i.v., caused prominent systemic and coronary vasodilation, with a maximum reduction of mean aortic pressure from 92 +/- 5 mm Hg during control conditions to 62 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), a peak increase in cardiac output from 3.0 +/- 0.4 to 4.1 +/- 0.7 L/min (p less than 0.05), and a peak reduction of systemic vascular resistance from 2,450 +/- 400 to 1,210 +/- 329 dyne X s X cm-5 (p less than 0.01). Simultaneously, heart rate increased from 143 +/- 9 to 174 +/- 8 beats/min (p less than 0.01), and maximum left ventricular dP/dt increased from 2,410 +/- 120 to 4,020 +/- 60 mm Hg/s (p less than 0.01). Dose-related increases of coronary blood flow occurred from 37.3 +/- 3.7 to a maximum of 74.1 +/- 6.6 ml/min (p less than 0.01), while mean coronary vascular resistance decreased from 1,770 +/- 240 to 700 +/- 260 dyne X s X cm-3 (p less than 0.01). Myocardial oxygen consumption increased in proportion to the increase in coronary blood flow. Following beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.), ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium, or catecholamine depletion with reserpine (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.), the systemic and coronary vasodilator effects of tetramethylpyrazine persisted, but the increases in heart rate, maximum left ventricular dP/dt, and myocardial oxygen consumption were markedly attenuated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "57": "We measured plasma catecholamines, alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor numbers and the accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the unstimulated state and in response to 10 mumol/l (-) isoproterenol in blood cells from 29 euthyroid controls and from 18 patients with spontaneous hyperthyroidism. In the thyrotoxic patients plasma norepinephrine (1.14 +/- 0.5 nmol/l) and epinephrine (0.3 +/- 0.14 nmol/l) were significantly decreased compared with plasma norepinephrine (1.87 +/- 0.7 nmol) and epinephrine (0.41 +/- 0.19 nmol/l) in the controls (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively) and the values obtained in subjects rendered euthyroid by antithyroid treatment (P less than 0.001, respectively). alpha-adrenoceptor density in platelet membranes obtained from patients in the hyperthyroid state (114 +/- 38 sites per cell) was significantly decreased when compared with controls (159 +/- 48 sites per cell, P less than 0.01) and the values from patients under effective antithyroid treatment (136 +/- 35 sites per cell, P less than 0.01). On the contrary, a significant increase in beta-adrenoceptor density in mononuclear leucocyte (MNL) membranes was found in hyperthyroid patients (1751 +/- 237 sites/cell) when compared with controls (1510 +/- 351 sites/cell, P less than 0.05) and the same patients following antithyroid treatment (1455 +/- 260 sites/cell, P less than 0.001). The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) did not change in hyperthyroidism. Basal cAMP concentrations in MNL were higher in untreated thyrotoxicosis (45 +/- 18 pmol/10(6) cells/10 min) than in patients in the euthyroid state (35 +/- 9 pmol/10(6) cells/10 min, P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "58": "We have used cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes to assess direct effects of T3 on beta-adrenergic-mediated regulation of lipolysis and adenylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase activities. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were maintained under four conditions: in the presence of medium containing serum from a hypothyroid calf (hypothyroid medium), hypothyroid medium supplemented with T3 (T3-supplemented hypothyroid medium), medium with serum from a normal calf (control medium), and control medium supplemented with excess T3 (hyperthyroid medium). Compared to the two control groups, i.e. cells maintained in control medium or T3-supplemented hypothyroid medium, cells maintained in hypothyroid medium exhibited lower basal rates of lipolysis and lower sensitivity to isoproterenol. Hyperthyroid cells exhibited higher basal rates of lipolysis and higher sensitivity to isoproterenol. In the presence of maximally effective concentrations of isoproterenol, rates of lipolysis were similar in the four groups. Similarly, basal cAMP content and cAMP accumulation in the presence of isoproterenol were reduced in hypothyroid and increased in hyperthyroid adipocytes compared to those adipocytes maintained in control or T3-supplemented hypothyroid medium. Basal adenylate cyclase activity was similar in the four groups. Sensitivity to isoproterenol and maximal isoproterenol-stimulated cyclase activity were diminished in membrane preparations from hypothyroid adipocytes and increased in preparations from hyperthyroid adipocytes. Cyclase activity in the presence of NaF, however, was similar in preparations from cells maintained in hypothyroid, T3-supplemental hypothyroid, or control medium. NaF-stimulated activity was increased in preparations from hyperthyroid adipocytes. Thyroid status did not affect beta-receptor number of affinity for iodohydroxybenzylpindolol. Compared to control cells or cells maintained in T3-supplemented hypothyroid medium, both soluble and particulate cAMP phosphodiesterase activities were increased in hypothyroid cells and decreased in hyperthyroid cells. These results indicated that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, some of the effects of thyroid hormone on cAMP content and lipolysis can be explained by alterations in both production and degradation of cAMP.", 
    "59": "Adrenal glomerulosa was examined for the presence of an adrenergic influence on aldosterone production. Cultured rat adrenal capsular explants were transferred to a perifusion system where the effect of exposure to catecholamines on aldosterone production was assessed. At 10(-6) M, isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine significantly stimulated aldosterone production, whereas at 10(-8) M only isoproterenol showed significant stimulation. Propranolol, a beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist, inhibited stimulation by epinephrine, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, enhanced stimulation by a submaximal dose of epinephrine. Epinephrine and norepinephrine were found by radioenzymatic assay to be present in fresh as well as cultured capsular tissue, although levels were considerably lower in tissue that had been in culture (about one tenth that of fresh tissue). The epinephrine-norepinephrine ratio was similar in capsule and medulla, suggesting a medullary source of capsular catecholamines. Whether catecholamines in the capsule arose from the in vitro manipulation of adrenal tissue or existed in vivo is unclear. In summary, beta-agonists stimulate aldosterone production in cultured rat capsular explants.", 
    "60": "One hundred and eighty three hypertensive pregnant women were randomly assigned to antihypertensive treatment with oxprenolol (96 women) or methyldopa (87 women). Control of hypertension was equivalent in both treatment groups, and in 64 (35%) cases hydralazine had to be added to the treatment to achieve the therapeutic goal (diastolic blood pressure below 85 mm Hg). Five perinatal deaths occurred, one in the oxprenolol group and four in the methyldopa group. Detailed analysis confirmed a previous report of greater fetal growth in the group treated with oxprenolol; this trend was present regardless of severity of hypertension and parity. With increasing duration of treatment the differences between the two groups diminished, and there was no difference after 10 weeks of treatment, a finding that may explain some of the reported discrepancies among therapeutic studies. As hypertension in pregnancy may pursue an accelerated course, necessitating urgent delivery, and there is no satisfactory method of predicting the duration of treatment in individual patients fetal benefit is most likely to be achieved by treatment with oxprenolol, provided that there is no maternal contraindication to treatment with beta blockers.", 
    "61": "The effects on portal pressure of the vasodilatory drugs isosorbide dinitrate and verapamil and of an alpha and beta blocking agent, labetalol, were assessed in 21 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The wedged hepatic venous pressure gradient (wedged minus free hepatic venous pressures) was used as an index of portal pressure and was not significantly changed by treatment with labetalol (n = 5) but was significantly decreased by verapamil (n = 6; p less than 0.05) and isosorbide dinitrate (n = 10; p less than 0.01). Long term administration of isosorbide dinitrate also had a significant effect (p less than 0.01).", 
    "62": "The relation between Ca2+ efflux, Ca2+ mobilization from mitochondria and glycogenolysis was studied in perfused euthyroid and hypothyroid rat livers stimulated by Ca2+-mobilizing hormones. Ca2+ efflux, induced by noradrenaline (1 microM) in the absence or presence of DL-propranolol (10 microM) from livers perfused with medium containing a low concentration of Ca2+ (approx. 24 microM), was decreased by more than 50% in hypothyroidism. This correlated with an equal decrease of the fractional mobilization of mitochondrial Ca2+, which could account for 65% of the difference between the net amounts of Ca2+ expelled from the euthyroid and hypothyroid livers. With vasopressin (10 nM) similar results were found, suggesting that hypothyroidism has a general effect on mobilization of internal Ca2+. In normal Ca2+ medium (1300 microM), however, the effect of vasopressin on net Ca2+ fluxes and phosphorylase activation was not impaired in hypothyroidism, indicating that Ca2+ mobilization from the mitochondria in this case plays a minor role in phosphorylase activation. The alpha 1-adrenergic responses of Ca2+ efflux, phosphorylase activation and glucose output, glucose-6-phosphatase activity and oxygen consumption in hypothyroid rat liver were completely restored by in vivo T3 injections (0.5 micrograms per 100 g body weight, daily during 3 days). Perfusion with T3 (100 pM) during 19 min did not influence hypothyroid rat liver oxygen consumption and alpha 1-receptor-mediated Ca2+ efflux. However, this in vitro T3 treatment showed a completely recovered alpha 1-adrenergic response of phosphorylase and a partly restored glucose-6-phosphatase activity and glucose output. The results indicate that thyroid hormones may control alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation of glycogenolysis by at least two mechanisms, i.e., a long-term action on Ca2+ mobilization, and a short-term action on separate stages of the glycogenolytic process.", 
    "63": "Platelet aggregation and thromboxane A2 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several forms of vascular disease. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a wide range of adrenoceptor antagonists on platelet aggregation, and thromboxane A2 production, from normal human platelet rich plasma in vitro. Labetalol, pindolol and propranolol inhibited platelet aggregation to collagen in a dose dependent manner. Increasing the concentration of collagen \"shifted\" the dose response curve to the right. These 3 drugs also significantly inhibited thromboxane A2 generation in response to collagen but not to arachidonic acid. This effect was independent of any inhibitory effect of these drugs on platelet aggregation, and occurred at a drug concentration close to that obtained in vivo. Atenolol, metoprolol, prazosin and timolol were similarly assessed but had no effect on either platelet aggregation or thromboxane A2 generation. This ability of labetalol, pindolol, and propranolol to inhibit platelet aggregation and thromboxane generation, may be of clinical benefit in view of the increasing evidence implicating thromboxane A2 in the pathogenesis of vascular disease.", 
    "64": "Beta 2-receptor stimulation is required for catecholamine-induced hypokalemia to occur. This hypokalemia is not mediated by insulin, renin or aldosterone. Catecholamine-induced hypokalemia can be prevented by selective beta 2 blockade, which does not abolish the inotropic effect of epinephrine.", 
    "65": "Silent myocardial ischemia is one of the most important clinical manifestations of asymptomatic coronary artery disease, along with silent myocardial infarction. It may well be a forerunner of sudden cardiac death. Although our understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the syndrome is still unresolved, we do know that prognosis in certain subsets of patients is far from benign. For that reason, aggressive therapy is recommended in asymptomatic patients with advanced disease, especially if they have already experienced a myocardial infarction, silent or otherwise.", 
    "66": "Experimental evidence is presented that activation of beta 2 adrenoreceptors causes a dose-dependent decrease in plasma potassium, probably by shifting potassium into the cell. By this mechanism epinephrine may cause hypokalemia and predispose to cardiac arrhythmias. Prevention of these effects by nonselective beta blockers may contribute to the cardioprotective action of these drugs.", 
    "67": "Blood pressure control in mild and moderate hypertension may reduce morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, antihypertensive drugs may cause adverse metabolic, electrolyte, neural and hemodynamic alterations that detract from their effectiveness. The effect of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) on some of these factors was compared with that of HCTZ and a sympatholytic drug in 20 hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and retinopathy. HCTZ controlled blood pressure at rest and during maximum treadmill exercise (-12 mm Hg systolic and diastolic pressure (p less than 0.05), reduced left ventricular mass by 7% (p less than 0.05) and lessened aerobic impairment at maximum treadmill exercise by 45% (p less than 0.05). These effects were further improved after \"neural blockade.\" A potential adverse effect of HCTZ--hypokalemia (-0.6 mEq/liter, p less than 0.01)--and the associated incidence of ectopy during effort (50%) were lessened after neutralizing neural tone. Combination therapy with low-dose diuretic and sympatholytic drugs was effective and well tolerated in patients with cardiac and vascular sequelae of moderately severe hypertension.", 
    "68": "Acute or chronic administration of most beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs is associated with a fall in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. In patients with renal insufficiency this effect on renal function may be clinically important. Penbutolol is a non-cardioselective, pure laevo, beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Previous studies have suggested that penbutolol may increase the glomerular filtration rate. In this study eight hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency were studied during a three-week placebo period and then for four weeks while taking penbutolol in a dose of 40 or 80 mg daily. Penbutolol produced a fall in the pulse rate in all eight patients. Five of the eight patients had a fall in their supine and standing blood pressure. Effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate did not change significantly. In seven of the eight patients there was a fall in the calculated renal vascular resistance but the mean fall did not reach statistical significance. Penbutolol appears to be an effective beta-blocker and one that could be used appropriately in patients with renal insufficiency.", 
    "69": "The increases in activity of hepatic thymidylate synthetase and of thymidine kinase, which catalyze the formation of thymidylate via the de novo and salvage pathways, respectively, were significantly suppressed during liver regeneration in rats which had been given alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists (phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine) or adrenergic neuron blockers (guanethidine and reserpine). These suppressions were not observed with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (propranolol), or an anticholinergic agent (atropine methyl nitrate). The rise in the activity of the thymidylate-synthesizing enzymes was closely correlated with the increase in the DNA content of the liver. It is concluded that catecholamine regulates the increase in the activity of thymidylate synthetase and thymidine kinase, which are key enzymes in DNA synthesis in regenerating liver. It is also suggested that sympathetic nerves play an important role in liver regeneration.", 
    "70": "The role of an endogenous inhibitor of Na+,K+-ATPase in hypertension observed in one-kidney NaCl-loaded rats treated with deoxycorticosterone (DOC) was examined. Ouabain or digitoxin, an exogenous inhibitor of Na+,K+-ATPase, failed to cause hypertension in one-kidney NaCl-loaded rats without DOC treatment or one-kidney DOC-treated rats without NaCl loading. Moreover, neither ouabain nor digitoxin acted additively with a putative endogenous inhibitor of Na+,K+-ATPase to augment hypertension observed in one-kidney NaCl-loaded rats treated with DOC. The results do not support the hypothesis that an endogenous inhibitor of Na+,K+-ATPase plays an important role in the development or maintenance of hypertension in this animal model.", 
    "71": "In 1984, expenditures for health care in the United States were nearly $350 billion, more than 10% of the gross national product, and continued increases exceeding the general economic growth are projected. Cardiology and cardiovascular surgery represent a large part of this cost, reflecting the many new diagnostic and therapeutic procedures developed over the past 2 decades. Previous cost containment attempts failed because they provided no incentive to reduce spending for advanced technologies and procedures. A method of payment based on a case mix of 467 diagnosis related groups (DRGs), average duration of hospital stay and location of hospitals has been developed for Medicare. A 4-year trial using this method in New Jersey resulted in lower hospital costs per capita than in the rest of the country. In October 1983, a 3-year phase-in for all Medicare payments by the DRG method began. The 43 DRGs assigned to cardiology and cardiovascular surgery are among the highest-weighted for large reimbursement; thus, with the great number of aging patients with cardiac diagnoses, cardiology represents a very large share of the cost of medical care today. Because the quality of care can be determined and compared directly with costs, cardiology DRGs lend themselves to careful analysis. Three components will be examined. Coronary bypass surgery is the largest single reimbursement, thus the rationale for its use should be carefully studied. Coronary care units have markedly increased hospital costs for acute myocardial infarction, but have also improved care.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "The alpha and beta adrenoceptor blocking drug labetalol is a potent antihypertensive agent in widespread clinical use. Its interference in the classical chemical estimations of urinary catecholamines and their metabolites has been the subject of several reports. Factitiously raised values have been noted in both the fluorimetric catecholamine assay, and the standard spectrophotometric procedure for total (free and conjugated) metadrenalines. To avoid such drug interference, modification of these methods is required in the estimation of catecholamines and their o-methylated metabolites. Alternatively, VMA estimations or plasma/urinary catecholamine measurements by radioenzymatic assay may be used in patients on labetalol. Although high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD) methods for estimation of plasma catecholamines are now in widespread use, the interference of labetalol in this method has not been reported. We now report that significant direct interference of labetalol in the HPLC-ECD assay does indeed occur, and can yield spuriously raised adrenaline levels.", 
    "73": "Described is the case of an infant, exposed during gestation to the beta-blocker nadolol, who experienced cardiorespiratory depression, mild hypoglycemia, and growth retardation. The longer duration of action of nadolol and the fact that it is only 30% protein bound make it less desirable than propranolol for use as a beta-blocker during pregnancy."
