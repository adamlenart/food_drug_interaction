    "1": "Synthetic melanin was prepared from dopa by the action of tyrosinase. Timolol, dorzolamide, and bunazosin were incubated separately at a concentration of 10(-4) M in 2 ml of 0.066 M phosphate buffer containing 5 mg of synthetic melanin. After centrifugation, the absorbance of each free drug in the supernatant was measured at its optimum wavelength. The percentage of each drug bound to melanin was calculated directly from the change in absorbance relative to the initial value.", 
    "2": "The increase in the binding rates of all three drugs seemed to reach a plateau after 30 min. After incubating for 60 min, the binding rate of timolol was 22.2% +/- 4.9%, bunazosin 36.3% +/- 2.5%, and dorzolamide 8.5% +/- 1.9%. There were statistically significant differences between the binding rates of each drug.",

    "5": "A 32-yr-old previously healthy woman (gravida 4, para 2) presented to our tertiary care obstetrical hospital at 34 weeks five days gestation with a history of labile blood pressure and severe hypertension. A week prior to admission she began having episodes of severe headache, dizziness, sweating and nausea. On a routine obstetric visit she was noted to be severely hypertensive with a blood pressure of 200/120 mmHg. Biochemical investigations confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a 3 cm x 3 cm right adrenal mass. The patient was invasively monitored in the intensive care unit and treated with alpha- followed by beta-blockade with phenoxybenzamine and metoprolol. A multidisciplinary conference was organized involving endocrinology, anesthesiology, general surgery and obstetrics to determine the most appropriate management of the patient. An uncomplicated laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed following a period of recovery after an uneventful elective Cesarean delivery.", 
    "6": "The primary goals in the management of pheochromocytoma in pregnancy are early diagnosis, avoidance of a hypertensive crisis during delivery and definitive surgical treatment. Timing of surgical resection will depend on the gestational age at which diagnosis is made. Cesarean section is the preferred mode of delivery when the tumour is still present. This case illustrates that with antenatal diagnosis, advanced methods of tumour localization, adequate preoperative adrenergic blockade and team planning, pheochromocytoma in pregnancy can be treated successfully.", 
    "7": "Chronic exposure of pancreatic beta-cells to saturated fatty acids leads to loss of viability, an effect that has been implicated in the process of beta-cell 'lipotoxicity' associated with the progression of type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms involved are unknown but recent evidence has implicated the delta isoform of protein kinase C (PKCdelta) in mediating fatty acid toxicity. We have investigated this proposition in the clonal insulin-secreting cell line, BRIN-BD11. BRIN-BD11 cells were found to undergo apoptosis when exposed to palmitate and this response was attenuated by the purportedly selective inhibitor of PKCdelta, rottlerin. However, activation of PKCdelta with the phorbol ester, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), failed to promote cell death and down-regulation of PKCdelta did not prevent the cytotoxic effects of palmitate. Moreover, rottlerin remained effective as a blocker of the palmitate response in cells depleted of PKCdelta. Since rottlerin can inhibit various other kinases in addition to PKCdelta, a range of additional kinase inhibitors was also tested. Of these, only the putative Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) inhibitor, KN-62, was found to inhibit palmitate-induced cell death. However, this effect was not reproduced by a more selective pseudo-substrate inhibitor of CaM kinase II. Therefore, the present results reveal that palmitate induces cell death in BRIN-BD11 cells and suggest that this may involve the activation of a rottlerin (and KN-62)-sensitive kinase. However, it is clear that PKCdelta is not required for this response.", 
    "8": "This paper introduces a modified principal dynamic modes (PDM) method, which is able to separate the dynamics of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activities. The PDM is based on the principle that among all possible choices of expansion bases, there are some that require the minimum number of basis functions to achieve a given mean-square approximation of the system output. Such a minimum set of basis functions is termed PDMs of the nonlinear system. We found that the first two dominant PDMs have similar frequency characteristics for parasympathetic and sympathetic activities, as reported in the literature. These results are consistent for all nine of our healthy human subjects using our modified PDM approach. Validation of the purported separation of parasympathetic and sympathetic activities was performed by the application of the autonomic nervous system blocking drugs atropine and propranolol. With separate applications of the respective drugs, we found a significant decrease in the amplitude of the waveforms that correspond to each nervous activity. Furthermore, we observed near complete elimination of these dynamics when both drugs were given to the subjects. Comparison of our method to the conventional low-frequency/high-frequency ratio shows that our proposed approach provides more accurate assessment of the autonomic nervous balance. Our nonlinear PDM approach allows a clear separation of the two autonomic nervous activities, the lack of which has been the main reason why heart rate variability analysis has not had wide clinical acceptance.", 
    "9": "We performed a study in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) to determine whether carvedilol, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, activates capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons (CSSNs), thereby promoting the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide with an important role in maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis. Carvedilol given intravenously at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg transiently decreased the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and increased renal tissue blood flow with increases in CGRP levels in plasma and kidney. These effects induced by carvedilol were not seen in animals pretreated with capsazepine, an antagonist of capsaicin. Although 1.0 mg/kg cavedilol markedly decreased MABP, it neither increased renal tissue blood flow nor CGRP levels in plasma and kidney. Prazosin, a selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, and bisoprolol, a selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, decreased MABP with capsazepine, showing no antagonistic action in either cases, and these agents increased neither renal tissue blood flow nor levels of CGRP in plasma and kidney. Both ICI 118,551 [(+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol], a selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg and capsaicin mimicked effects induced by 0.3 mg/kg carvedilol. Administration of 1.0 mg/kg ICI 118,551 produced effects similar to those induced by 1.0 mg/kg carvedilol. These observations strongly suggested that the low dose of carvedilol might activate CSSNs in SHR to increase the release of CGRP, thereby decreasing blood pressure with an increase in renal tissue blood flow. The effects induced by carvedilol seemed to be mediated by its beta(2)-adrenoceptor blockade activity.", 
    "10": "The monolithic matrix type transdermal drug delivery system of metoprolol tartrate were prepared by the film casting on a mercury substrate and characterised in vitro by drug release studies, skin permeation studies and drug-excipients interaction analysis. Four formulations were developed, which differed in the ratio of matrix-forming polymers. Formulations MT-1, MT-2, MT-3 and MT-4 were composed of Eudragit RL-100 and polyvinyl pyrrolidone K-30 with the following ratios: 2:8, 4:6, 6:4 and 8:2, respectively. All the four formulations carried 10% (m/m) of metoprolol tartrate, 5% (m/m) of PEG-400 and 5% (m/m) of dimethyl sulfoxide in isopropyl alcohol: dichloromethane (40:60). Cumulative amounts of the drug released in 48 hours from the four formulations were 61.5, 75.4, 84.3 and 94.5%, respectively. The corresponding values for cumulative amounts of the permeated drug for the said formulations were 53.5, 62.5, 69.8 and 78.2%. On the basis of in vitro drug release and skin permeation performance, formulation MT-4 was found to be better than the other three formulations and it was selected as the optimized formulation.", 
    "11": "To investigate the role of adhesion molecules [intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and integrin alpha 5 beta 1] in the progression of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) under peritoneal dialysis, we examined changes in the expression of those adhesion molecules in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats treated with acidic dialysis solution with or without angiotensin II type 1a receptor blocker (ARB). We divided 48 WKY rats into 4 groups and dialyzed them with various solutions as follows: (1) pH 7 1.5% glucose dialysis solution (control group, n = 12); (2) pH 3.5 1.5% glucose dialysis solution (EPS group, n = 12); (3) pH 3.5 1.5% glucose dialysis solution, plus oral administration of CS866 5 mg/kg daily (ARB group, n = 12); and (4) pH 3.5 1.5% glucose dialysis solution, plus oral administration of amlodipine (CA group, n = 12). We injected the dialysis solutions into the abdominal cavity and administered the ARB and CA daily for 42 days. On days 3, 7, 14, and 42, three rats in each group were humanely killed by decapitation, and we studied the expression of adhesion molecules in peritoneum by the immunofluorescence method. In the EPS rats, expression of adhesion molecules was observed in peritoneum on day 3 after start of acidic solution treatment, in conjunction with an increment of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the dialysate. The peritoneum of EPS rats showed peritoneal fibrosis with interstitial cell infiltration. Treatment with ARB significantly suppressed expression of adhesion molecules in the peritoneum and suppressed peritoneal fibrosis. Treatment with a neutral solution induced no peritoneal fibrosis nor expression of adhesion molecules in the peritoneum. Our results suggest that adhesion molecules play an important role in the progression of peritoneal fibrosis and resultant EPS. Treatment with ARB prevents the progression of peritoneal fibrosis and suppresses expression of adhesion molecules in the peritoneum.",

    "15": "Neonatal thyrotoxicosis can be managed successfully using iopanoic acid. Iopanoic acid is essentially free of side effects and need only be administered every 3 to 4 days. When administered until (transplacental) maternal TSI has been metabolized by the neonate, iopanoic acid maintains euthyroid status with no risk of hypothyroidism. With conventional therapy, propylthiouracil (PTU) must be administered three times a day. PTU also carries a significant risk of toxic side effects and a week or more of therapy is required to correct the hyperthyroid state and may induce hypothyroidism.",

    "17": "Patients undergoing low-risk coronary artery surgery were enrolled. No routine antiarrhythmic drugs were administered before or after the operation. Ventral cardiac denervation was performed in 207 patients, and 219 patients were used as control subjects. Denervation was performed before cardiopulmonary bypass. The groups were comparable regarding demographic, clinical, and operative variables.", 
    "18": "The additional time for the denervation was 5 +/- 2 minutes, and there were no associated complications. Postoperative atrial fibrillation was present in 15 (7%) patients undergoing ventral cardiac denervation (95% confidence interval, 4%-12%) and in 56 (27%) control subjects (95% confidence interval, 18%-35%). Patients submitted to ventral cardiac denervation had fewer and less severe episodes of atrial fibrillation, and no patient had atrial fibrillation after discharge. Ventral cardiac denervation was the most significant predictor of postoperative atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 0.42; confidence interval, 0.23-0.78; P =.006). Age of greater than 65 years (odds ratio, 1.67; confidence interval, 0.96-2.9; P =.067) was a highly suggestive predictor. The analysis of the effect of ventral cardiac denervation correlated with the patient's age showed a more pronounced effect in patients younger than 70 years (odds ratio, 0.43; confidence interval, 0.22-0.86; P =.022)", 
    "19": "Ventral cardiac denervation is a fast and low-risk procedure. Its use significantly reduces the incidence and severity of atrial fibrillation after routine coronary artery bypass surgery. Patients younger than 70 years of age are expected to have a higher success rate than those older than 70 years.", 
    "20": "A great many cardiovascular drugs (CVDs) have the potential to induce adverse reactions in the mouth. The prevalence of such reactions is not known, however, since many are asymptomatic and therefore are believed to go unreported. As more drugs are marketed and the population includes an increasing number of elderly, the number of drug prescriptions is also expected to increase. Accordingly, it can be predicted that the occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), including the oral ones (ODRs), will continue to increase. ODRs affect the oral mucous membrane, saliva production, and taste. The pathogenesis of these reactions, especially the mucosal ones, is largely unknown and appears to involve complex interactions among the drug in question, other medications, the patient's underlying disease, genetics, and life-style factors. Along this line, there is a growing interest in the association between pharmacogenetic polymorphism and ADRs. Research focusing on polymorphism of the cytochrome P450 system (CYPs) has become increasingly important and has highlighted the intra- and inter-individual responses to drug exposure. This system has recently been suggested to be an underlying candidate regarding the pathogenesis of ADRs in the oral mucous membrane. This review focuses on those CVDs reported to induce ODRs. In addition, it will provide data on specific drugs or drug classes, and outline and discuss recent research on possible mechanisms linking ADRs to drug metabolism patterns. Abbreviations used will be as follows: ACEI, ACE inhibitor; ADR, adverse drug reaction; ANA, antinuclear antigen; ARB, angiotensin II receptor blocker; BAB, beta-adrenergic blocker; CCB, calcium-channel blocker; CDR, cutaneous drug reaction; CVD, cardiovascular drug; CYP, cytochrome P450 enzyme; EM, erythema multiforme; FDE, fixed drug eruption; I, inhibitor of CYP isoform activity; HMG-CoA, hydroxymethyl-glutaryl coenzyme A; NAT, N-acetyltransferase; ODR, oral drug reaction; RDM, reactive drug metabolite; S, substrate for CYP isoform; SJS, Stevens-Johnson syndrome; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; and TEN, toxic epidermal necrolysis.", 
    "21": "The objective of this 12-week double-blind randomized multicentre study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of nebivolol, a recently developed beta-blocking agent with vasodilating properties, to the classical beta-blocker atenolol. After a placebo run-in phase, 205 mild-to-moderate middle-age essential hypertensives were randomized to either nebivolol 5 mg daily (n = 105) or atenolol 100 mg daily (n = 100) over a period of 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study was the change in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP respectively) from baseline to week 12 of treatment. The two drugs induced similar significant antihypertensive effects, the SBP and DBP reduction amounting to -18.2 +/-14.0 and -14.6 +/-7.9 mmHg (mean +/- SD) for atenolol and -19.1 +/-12.9 and -14.8 +/- 7.1 for nebivolol (p < 0.01 for all). This was the case also for standing blood pressure. Sitting and standing heart rate values were significantly reduced by both drugs, the bradicardic response induced by nebivolol treatment being significantly less than atenolol. Distribution of responders and non- responders was similar for nebivolol and atenolol, while the former drug showed a better tolerability profile and a lower incidence of side-effects. These data provide evidence, that, for the same antihypertensive effects, nebivolol shows a better tolerability profile than atenolol and a lower incidence of adverse effects.", 
    "22": "Preclinical research suggests adrenal beta-adrenergic receptors to be involved in the regulation of steroid synthesis. In a group of healthy male volunteers, we compared ACTH-induced cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) secretion after pre-treatment with orciprenaline, propranolol or placebo. Neither baseline nor ACTH-induced steroid secretion differed between these conditions. Our data do not support the hypothesis that the adrenal beta-receptor plays a major role in steroid secretion in humans.", 
    "23": "Cardiac rehabilitation after acute coronary syndrome is an important but underused therapeutic intervention. The aim of the French nationwide PREVENIR survey was to improve knowledge on the management of cardiovascular risk factors, especially during cardiac rehabilitation after acute coronary syndrome. The purpose of this study was to specify the characteristics of patients referred to cardiac rehabilitation.", 
    "24": "The survey was performed in 77 of 501 (15.4%) public or private French coronary care units. All French regions were involved. All the patients admitted to the hospital during January 1998 who survived an acute coronary syndrome were included in the survey. Data on rehabilitation practice were collected from patient medical records, either during an outpatient consultation or from the patient and the general practitioner during the 6-month follow-up period.", 
    "25": "Of the 1394 patients included in the study (779 with myocardial infarction and 615 with unstable angina), only 310 (22%) underwent cardiac rehabilitation. Significant differences in patient characteristics were found between the cardiac rehabilitation and non-cardiac rehabilitation groups, respectively, in terms of gender (82% male vs 68%; P <.001), age younger than 65 years (56% vs 39%; P <.001), type of acute coronary syndrome (75% myocardial infarction vs 50%; P <.001), left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35% (6% vs 13%; P <.0004), and prevalence of percutaneous intervention (54% vs 46%; P <.02). Two risk factors were more common in the rehabilitated group: dyslipidemia (52% vs 44%; P <.02) and current smoking (51% vs 37%; P <.0001). In the multivariate analysis, female gender (odds ratio [OR], 0.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.87) and older age (>75 years vs. <65 years; OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.3-0.7) predicted decreased cardiac rehabilitation prescription. Conversely, previous history of dyslipidemia (OR,1.4; 95% CI, 1.04-1.8), post-myocardial infarction (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.13-3.89), and a percutaneous intervention (OR,1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.7) predicted increased cardiac rehabilitation prescription. Severe left ventricular impairment (< or =35% vs >50%) was not an independent factor for cardiac rehabilitation prescription. At 6-month follow-up assessment, rehabilitation patients had a lower rate of hypertension (18% vs 27%), elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (54% vs 62%), and continued smoking (34% vs 50%).", 
    "26": "The results of the PREVENIR survey underscore the low level of cardiac rehabilitation prescription in France, and the relative exclusion of women and elderly people. Among the risk factors, dyslipidemia and current smoking are more frequent among rehabilitated patients. These findings may help to modify the strategy for using cardiac rehabilitation after acute coronary syndrome, although it is an effective intervention for secondary prevention.", 
    "27": "We examined the basal adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels and forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) expressing different levels of human beta(2)-adrenoceptors. Both the basal and forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation in the cells that express higher density of beta(2)-adrenoceptors (CHO-beta(2)/H; 560 fmol/mg protein) were larger than those in the cells that express lower density of beta(2)-adrenoceptors (CHO-beta(2)/L; 270 fmol/mg protein). In addition, isoproterenol-induced cAMP accumulation was also augmented as the number of beta(2)-adrenoceptors was increased. ICI 118,551, a selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist with inverse agonist properties, decreased all the levels of cAMP observed in both cell lines. These results suggest that the agonist-independent (constitutive) activity of beta(2)-adrenoceptors plays a key role in the control of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation.", 
    "28": "Data feedback is a fundamental component of quality improvement efforts, but previous studies provide mixed results on its effectiveness. This study illustrates the diversity of hospital based efforts at data feedback and highlights successful strategies and common pitfalls in designing and implementing data feedback to support performance improvement.", 
    "29": "Open ended interviews with 45 clinical and administrative staff in eight US hospitals in 2000 concerning their perceptions about the effectiveness of data feedback in supporting performance improvement efforts were analysed. The hospitals were chosen to represent a range of sizes, geographical regions, and beta blocker improvement rates over a 3 year period. Data were organized and analyzed in NUD-IST 4 using the constant comparative method of qualitative data analysis.", 
    "30": "Although the data feedback efforts at the hospitals were diverse, the interviews suggested that seven key themes may be important: (1) data must be perceived by physicians as valid to motivate change; (2) it takes time to develop the credibility of data within a hospital; (3) the source and timeliness of data are critical to perceived validity; (4) benchmarking improves the meaningfulness of data feedback; (5) physician leaders can enhance the effectiveness of data feedback; (6) data feedback that profiles an individual physician's practices can be effective but may be perceived as punitive; (7) data feedback must persist to sustain improved performance. Embedded in several themes was the view that the effectiveness of data feedback depends not only on the quality and timeliness of the data, but also on the organizational context in which such efforts are implemented.",

    "32": "Diastolic heart failure (DHF) has become a social burden; however, evidences leading to its therapeutic strategy are lacking. This study investigated effects of addition of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) at advanced stage of DHF in hypertensive rats. Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed 8% NaCl diet from age 7 weeks served as DHF model, and those fed a normal chow served as control. The DHF model rats were arbitrarily assigned to 3 treatment regimens at age 17 weeks: ACEI (temocapril 0.4 mg/kg per day), combination of ACEI (temocapril 0.2 mg/kg per day) with ARB (olmesartan 0.3 mg/kg per day), or placebo. At age 17 weeks, this model represents progressive ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, relaxation abnormality, and myocardial stiffening. Data were collected at age 20 weeks. As compared with the monotherapy with ACEI, the addition of ARB induced more prominent suppression of ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, leading to suppression of myocardial stiffening, improvement of relaxation, and inhibition of hemodynamic deterioration. Such benefits were associated with greater decreases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, macrophage infiltration, and gene expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1) and interleukin (IL)-1beta, but not with changes in gene expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Thus, ARB added to ACEI provides more benefits as compared with ACEI alone in DHF when initiated at an advanced stage. The additive effects are likely provided through more prominent suppression of ROS generation and inflammatory changes without effects on expression of MCP-1 and TNF-alpha.", 
    "33": "1. CGP 12177A mediates cardiostimulation by activation of the 'putative' beta(4)-adrenoceptor; however, it has recently been reported that disruption of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor gene abolishes this effect. We have adenovirally overexpressed beta(1)-adrenoceptors in isolated, cultured adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes and observed the inotropic potency of isoprenaline and CGP 12177A (in the presence of 1 microm propranolol). 2. Isoprenaline was a full inotropic agonist at rat ventricular myocytes (pD(2) 7.69+/-0.12). CGP 12177A was a nonconventional partial agonist (pD(2) 6.34+/-0.09), increasing inotropy and lusitropy, with an intrinsic activity of 0.34 and antagonised by bupranolol. 3. beta(1)-adrenoceptor overexpression enhanced the inotropic potency of isoprenaline by 11.7-fold (pD(2) 8.76+/-0.14) and CGP 12177A by 5.9-fold (7.11+/-0.10), respectively. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) overexpression did not alter the potency of isoprenaline or CGP 12177A (pD(2) 7.41+/-0.24 and pD(2) 6.60+/-0.50, respectively). 4. The cardiostimulant effects of CGP 12177A were enhanced by IBMX (phosphodiesterase inhibitor) and decreased by Rp-cAMPS (cAMP antagonist). CGP 12177A also increased cAMP levels. CGP 12177A but not isoprenaline initiated arrhythmias at lower concentrations following beta(1)-adrenoceptor overexpression. 5. (125)I-Cyanopindolol saturation binding in Adv.beta(1) myocytes demonstrated approximately 18-fold increase in beta(1)-adrenoceptors. (3)H-CGP 12177A saturation binding, in the presence of propranolol, increased approximately 5-fold following overexpression of beta(1)-adrenoceptors. 6. This study demonstrates enhanced cardiostimulation by CGP 12177A (in the presence of propranolol) in rat ventricular myocytes overexpressing beta(1)-adrenoceptors, mediated by a Gs/cAMP signalling pathway. 'Putative' beta(4)-adrenoceptor pharmacology appears to be mediated by activation of a novel affinity state of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor.", 
    "34": "Although angiotensin II receptor blockade is considered to be useful for the treatment of human heart failure, little beneficial hemodynamic effect has been shown in some experimental failing hearts. In this study, we assessed the effect of an angiotensin II receptor blocker, valsartan, on sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) function, defectiveness of which is a major pathogenic mechanism in heart failure.", 
    "35": "SR vesicles were isolated from dog left ventricular muscle (normal or exposed to 4-week rapid ventricular pacing with or without valsartan). In the untreated and valsartan-treated paced dogs, cardiac function showed similar deterioration (compared with before pacing). However, both the density of beta-receptors and the contractile response to dobutamine were greater in the valsartan-treated paced dogs than in the untreated paced dogs. In untreated paced hearts, the ryanodine receptor was protein kinase A-hyperphosphorylated, showed an abnormal Ca2+ leak, and had a decreased amount of ryanodine receptor-bound FKBP12.6. No such phenomena were seen in the valsartan-treated paced hearts. Both the SR Ca2+ uptake function and the amount of Ca2+-ATPase were decreased in the untreated failing SR, but both were restored in the valsartan-treated SR.", 
    "36": "During the development of pacing-induced heart failure, valsartan preserved the density of beta-receptors and concurrently restored SR function without improving resting cardiac function.", 
    "37": "Phopholipidosis is a lipid storage disorder caused by cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) characterized by the lysosomal accumulation of phospholipids and drug. alpha-Tocopherol (alpha-Toc) has a reversible effect on phospholipidosis in rats and cell culture. We studied the influence of alpha-Toc on the partitioning of the CAD desipramine in a liposome/buffer system using equilibrium dialysis with the following lipid compositions: egg phosphatidylcholine (PhC) or wheat germ phosphatidylinositol (PhI) or a combination of PhC, PhI and cholesterol, containing between 1.5 and 20% (mol per mol total lipids) of alpha-Toc, alpha-tocopherol acetate (alpha-TocAc), 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-6-chromanol (PMC) or cholesterol. alpha-Toc (1.5%) enhanced the partition coefficient of neutral desipramine by up to 1.1 log units while it had no influence on the partitioning of the ionized compound. In the PhC liposome system, at pH 7.4 logD increased with increasing alpha-Toc concentrations but was unchanged at pH 4.5. Similar effects were found with PMC while alpha-TocAc or cholesterol, between 1.5 and 20%, had no influence on the partitioning of desipramine. From these results we postulate that in vivo, alpha-Toc could mediate a redistribution of CADs from lysosomal membranes (pH approximately 4.5) to membranes and lipoproteins at physiological pH.", 
    "38": "The aim of the present study was to analyse the role of beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors in the catecholamine-induced myocardial remodeling, especially the interstitial fibrosis. Wistar rats were subjected to a 2-week chronic isoprenaline administration (30 microg/kg/h). Rats received a concomitant treatment with the selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, bisoprolol (50 mg/kg/day p.o.) or were chronically pretreated with the selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol (40 microg/kg/h) for 1 week to induce beta(2)-adrenoceptor desensitization. The pretreatment with salbutamol induced a 59% down-regulation of left ventricular beta(2)-adrenoceptors compared to control. The extent of the isoprenaline-induced left ventricular fibrosis was significantly reduced in both the bisoprolol and salbutamol groups compared with the control isoprenaline-treated group especially in the apical region (1.7+/-0.6% and 1.4+/-0.3% versus 6.0+/-1.3%, respectively, P<0.005). beta(1)-adrenoceptor blockade and beta(2)-adrenoceptors down-regulation provided similar protection against isoprenaline-induced cardiac interstitial fibrosis suggesting that both beta-adrenoceptors are involved in such cardiac remodeling process.", 
    "39": "The congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is characterized by a prolonged QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram and an increased risk of recurrent syncope and sudden cardiac death. Mutations in seven genes have been identified as the molecular basis of LQTS. beta-blockers are the treatment of choice to reduce cardiac symptoms. However, long-term follow-up of genotyped families with LQTS has been rarely reported. We have clinically followed a four-generation family with LQTS being treated with beta-blocker therapy over a period of 23 years. Seven family members were carriers of two amino acid alterations in cis (V254M-V417M) in the cardiac potassium channel gene KCNQ1. Voltage-clamp recordings of mutant KCNQ1 protein in Xenopus oocytes showed that only the V254M mutation reduced the IKs current and that the effect of the V417M variant was negligible. The family exhibited the complete clinical spectrum of the disease, from asymptomatic patients to victims of sudden death before beta-blocker therapy. There was no significant reduction in QTc (556 +/- 40 ms(1/2) before therapy, 494 +/- 20 ms(1/2) during 17 years of treatment; n = 5 individuals). Of nine family members, one female died suddenly before treatment, three females of the second generation were asymptomatic, and four individuals of the third and fourth generation were symptomatic. All mutation carriers were treated with beta-blockers and remained asymptomatic for a follow-up up to 23 years. Long-term follow-up of a LQT1 family with a common mutation (V254M) being on beta-blocker therapy was effective and safe. This study underscores the importance of long-term follow-up in families with specific LQT mutations to provide valuable information for clinicians for an appropriate antiarrhythmic treatment.",

It is a rare disorder an the main risk factors are cirrhosis, hepatobiliary malignancies and prothrombotic disorders, which have been identified as major risk. Therapy with anticoagulants must to be considered in acute portal thrombosis or chronic one and proven hypercoagulability. We present the case of a twenty-nine years old patient, with extrahepatic portal hypertension secondary to portal and splenic vein thrombosis, who was diagnosed because of splenomegaly and a coagulation disorder. A protein C deficiency were discovered and anticoagulation and beta-blocker therapy were initiated.

It produced an 84% suppression of neointimal hyperplasia in rat carotid angioplasty model, but no data are available regarding its effect on stent restenosis in patients. We tested whether a sustained oral administration of carvedilol reduces restenosis after coronary stenting in patients.",

    "54": "Effects of serotonin (5-HT) on electrophysiological activities of single hypothalamic arcuate neurons in rat brain slices were observed by extracellular recording. The results showed that (1) of 385 arcuate neurons observed, the patterns of spontaneous firing were divided into 3 categories: \"slow irregular\" (46.0%), \"fast continuous\" (22.6%), and \"bursting\" firing (31.4%); (2) of 149 neurons tested for 5-HT, most (55.0%) responded to the drug by decreasing firing rate, 22.2% by increasing firing rate, 11.4% exhibit biphasic pattern, and 11.4% did not respond to 5-HT application; (3) substitution of low Ca2-high Mg2+ artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) for normal ACSF did not abolish the 5-HT-induced excitatory effect while it did abolish the 5-HT-induced inhibitory effect, suggesting the effect in latter cases was elicited by a Ca2+-dependent release of neuroactive substances; (4) cyproheptadine, a non-selective 5-HT receptor antagonist, antagonized the 5-HT-induced excitatory effect in all neurons tested, while pindolol, a 5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonist, antagonized the 5-HT-induced excitatory effect in 50% of neurons tested; (5) both cyproheptadine and pindolol antagonized the 5-HT-induced inhibitory effect; and (6) bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, antagonized the 5-HT-induced inhibitory effect. These results suggest that 5-HT may exert its excitatory effects directly through 5-HT1A/1B and other subtypes of 5-HT-receptors located on the surface of the neurons recorded, while its inhibitory effects are mediated indirectly through the activation of a local inhibitory GABAergic interneuron.", 
    "55": "Cardiac arrhythmias represent a major area of cardiovascular research, and for drug therapy, a large choice of antiarrhythmic agents have been available. However, clinical trials with antiarrhythmic drugs have recently indicated that serious side effects may considerably limit the use of various antiarrhythmic agents, in particular, for preventing arrhythmia-related mortality. Amiodarone with its complex mode of action, while exerting a strong and favorable antiarrhythmic action, posseses extracardiac untoward side effects originating from its chemical structure. In this paper, we report on our attempt to develop conceptually new, therapeutically valuable antiarrhythmic compounds, in which Class I/B and Class III features were combined into single molecules bearing no structural resemblance to amiodarone. Synthesis and pharmacological screening of series of N-(phenylalkyl)-N-(phenoxyalkyl)amines led us to discover some new promising compounds with the required dual mode of action. GYKI-16638, selected for further investigation, was also found to possess a remarkable in vivo antiarrhythmic effect, and it is now considered as a safe new antiarrhythmic drug candidate.", 
    "56": "The slowly (I(Ks)) and rapidly (I(Kr)) activating delayed rectifier K(+) currents play important roles in cardiac ventricular repolarization. Compared with I(Kr), however, I(Ks) has important distinguishing characteristics, including beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation and accumulation at rapid rates that may impart significant therapeutic relevance. Therefore, development of selective I(Ks) inhibitors has been pursued as a strategy for providing potentially safer and more effective Class III antiarrhythmic agents and pharmacological tools for elucidating the normal physiological and potential pathological role of I(Ks) in cardiac repolarization. We have identified a series of 3-Acylamino-1,4 benzodiazepines that are very potent and selective inhibitors of I(Ks). A representative compound, L-768,673 (1) (IC(50)~8nM), has been extensively characterized for its pharmacologic activity. L-768,673 concentration-dependently prolongs action potential duration in a frequency-independent manner in vitro, but decreases transmural dispersion of refractoriness, a risk factor for arrhythmia induction. In conscious dogs, L 768,673 administered IV (0.3-100 micro g/kg) and PO (0.03-1 mg/kg) elicits consistent but limited (5-15%) QT(c) prolongation, and increases ventricular refractory period more at fast than at slow pacing rates, indicating a \"forward\" rate-dependence in vivo. In an anesthetized canine model of anterior myocardial infarction, I(Ks) blockers suppress the development of ischemic ventricular fibrillation at intravenous doses that minimally prolong the QT interval. I(Ks) blockers display an interesting and intriguing profile of effects on cardiac electrophysiologic parameters that differ in remarkable ways from other selective Class III agents such as I(Kr) blockers. It remains to be determined if these properties can be exploited clinically to provide more effective and safer treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.",

    "63": "Single component equilibrium isotherms of six compounds (aniline, caffeine, ethylbenzene, phenol, propranolol, and theophylline) were determined by the inverse method on 10 Kromasil-C18 columns, using water-methanol solutions as the mobile phase. This method offers an economic and fast isotherm determination by means of the overloaded band profiles of the compounds. Five out of the ten columns used in this test come from the same batch whilst the other five columns represent five additional batches. Statistical evaluation was used to assess the reproducibility of the isotherm parameters. We found that the column-to-column reproducibility of the isotherm parameters is of the same magnitude as the batch-to-batch reproducibility (with the exception of one outlier column). In most of the cases, the reproducibilities of the saturation capacities and that of the retention factors are excellent, they are typically between 1.2 and 3%, and very often below 2%. Within the limits of the experimental precision, these results agree with those obtained earlier, using a conventional method of isotherm determination.",

However, the 5-cm abdominal muscle-fascia incision and a 5-cm laparotomy significantly delayed GI transit. Gastrointestinal transit after a 5-cm laparotomy was significantly delayed, as compared with that of a 1-cm laparotomy regardless whether intestinal manipulation was performed or not. Guanethidine and yohimbine, but not propranolol, significantly improved the impaired GI transit after a 5-cm laparotomy.", 
    "67": "The results suggest that the longer and deeper abdominal incision more profoundly inhibits GI transit. The inhibitory effect of abdominal incision is mediated via the activation of the somatosympathetic reflex and alpha-2 adrenoceptors.", 
    "68": "Sedatives and tranquillisers are frequently used to reduce stress during the transportation of food producing animals. The most widely used classes of sedatives include the butyrophenone azaperone, the phenothiazines acepromazine, propionylpromazine, chlorpromazine and the [small beta]-blocker, carazolol. For regulatory control purposes, tolerances for azaperone and carazolol have been set by the European Union as 100 and 25 [micro sign]g kg(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the use of the phenothiazines is prohibited and therefore has a zero tolerance. A method for the detection of residues of five tranquillisers and one [small beta]-blocker using a single ELISA plate has been developed. Kidney samples (2.5 g) were extracted with dichloromethane and applied to a competitive enzyme immunoassay using three polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits against azaperol, propionylpromazine and carazolol conjugates. In sample matrix, the azaperol antibody cross-reacted 28.0% with azaperone and the propionylpromazine antibody cross-reacted 24.9% with acepromazine and 11.7% with chlorpromazine. In the ELISA, the detection capabilities of the six sedatives, azaperol, azaperone, carazolol, acepromazine, chlorpromazine, and propionylpromazine are 5, 15, 5, 5, 20 and 5 [micro sign]g kg(-1), respectively.

    "69": "The antihypertensive effect of vanylidilol, a new alpha/beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with endothelium-dependent and K(+)-channel-opening activities, was investigated in normotensive and hypertensive Wistar rats. Vanylidilol competitively antagonized (-)isoproterenol-induced positive chronotropic effects, inotropic effects, and tracheal relaxation effects in isolated rat right atria, left atria, and guinea pig tracheal strips in a concentration-dependent manner. Vanylidilol's apparent pA(2) values were 6.36 +/- 0.08 (right atria), 6.41 +/- 0.07 (left atria), and 6.31 +/- 0.06 (trachea). Vanylidilol also produced a competitive antagonism of phenylephrine-induced contraction in the isolated rat aorta with pA(2) values of 6.79 +/- 0.18. In the radioligand binding assay, vanylidilol inhibited [(3)H]CGP-12177 binding to rat ventricle and lung tissues and [(3)H]prazosin binding to brain membranes with Ki values of 535.17, 2,066.69, and 431.11, respectively. In isolated rat thoracic aorta, vanylidilol's vasorelaxant effects on phenylephrine (10 micromol/l)-induced contractions were attenuated by removing endothelium and by the presence of L-N(G)-nitro arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 100 micromol/l), methylene blue (10 micromol/l), 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolol[4,3,-a] quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 10 micromol/l), tetraethylammonium (10 mmol/l), glibenclamide (1 micromol/l), apamin (1 micromol/l), and charybdotoxin (0.1 micromol/l). In addition, vanylidilol, in an equally antagonistic activity, inhibited phenylephrine-induced phasic and tonic contractions. Intravenous vanylidilol further reduced mean blood pressure in pentobarbital-anesthetized normotensive Wistar rats in a dose-dependent manner. The oral administration of vanylidilol to conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats had a long-lasting hypotensive effect on the heart rate and decreased it in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, vanylidilol's vasodilator effect can be attributed in part to the release of NO or NO-related substance from vascular endothelium, while the endothelium-independent mechanism involved in vanylidilol's relaxation is probably linked to the activation of the K(+) channels and the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking activity in these vessels.", 
    "70": "This study was performed to characterize the beta-adrenoceptor population in rabbit isolated corpus cavernosum (RbCC) by using nonselective and selective beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists in functional assays. Metaproterenol, ritodrine, fenoterol, and 8-hydroxy-5-[(1R)-1-hydroxy-2-[N-[(1R)-2-(rho-methoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]amino]ethyl]carbostyril (TA 2005) (3-100 nmol each) dose dependently relaxed the RbCC preparations. These relaxations were markedly reduced by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 10 microM) and 1H-[1,2,4]-oxadiazolo-[4,3,-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) (10 microM), whereas the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ 22,536 [9-(2-tetrahydrofuryl) adenine] (10 microM) had no effect. In contrast, neither L-NAME nor ODQ affected the isoproterenol-induced RbCC relaxations, but SQ 22,536 abolished this response. Sildenafil (1 microM) significantly potentiated the relaxations induced by beta(2)-agonists without affecting the isoproterenol-evoked relaxations. Rolipram (10 microM) enhanced the relaxations elicited by isoproterenol but had no effect on those induced by the selective beta(2) agonists. Propranolol and (+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol hydrochloride (ICI 118,551) determined a rightward shift in the concentration-response curves to isoproterenol in a noncompetitive manner with a reduction of maximum response at the highest antagonist concentration, with the slope values significantly different from unity. Propranolol and ICI 118,551 had no effect on the relaxations elicited by fenoterol, TA 2005, metaproterenol, and ritodrine. Atenolol and 1-[2-((3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxy)phenoxy) ethylamino]-3-[4-(1-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-2-imidazolyl)-phenoxy]-2-propanol methanesulfonate (CGP 20712A) (0.1-10 microM) failed to affect the relaxations induced by all tested beta-adrenoceptor agonists. Our study revealed the existence of two atypical beta-adrenoceptors in the rabbit erectile tissue. Isoproterenol relaxes the rabbit cavernosal tissue by activating atypical beta-adrenoceptors coupled to adenylyl cyclase pathway, whereas the selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists relax the RbCC tissue through another atypical beta-adrenoceptor subtype coupled to nitric oxide release from the sinusoidal endothelium.", 
    "71": "A simple, rapid method for the simultaneous determination of cardiovascular drugs: celiprolol, bisoprolol and irbesartan in human plasma is described. The two main features of the proposed method deal first, with a simultaneous solid phase extraction of weakly basic beta-blockers derivatives and irbesartan which exhibit weak acidic properties; second with an absorbance monitoring using diode array detection in order to insure an improved selectivity. The separation is performed on a C(18) Kromasil 4.6 mm x 150 mm column using a linear gradient to achieve an entire separation of the four species in less than 20 min. The full analytical validation is performed according to guidance for industry for bioanalytical method validation. Linearity of the response was demonstrated for each drug for a range fulfilling the reported plasma levels, that is 10-500, 5-250 and 20-1000 ng l(-1) for celiprolol, bisoprolol and irbesartan respectively. Intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations for all compounds were, in any case, lower than 11% and the method exhibits a convenient accuracy (percentage of relative error lower than 6% for each drug). In each case, the LOD were sufficient to detect post dose trough concentrations for checking patient's observance. Moreover, selectivity towards either endogenous species or co-administered drugs was demonstrated by combination of the use of the solid phase extraction process, gradient elution and diode array detection facilities, making thus, the proposed technique especially suitable for routine drug monitoring of resistant hypertensive patients.", 
    "72": "The aims of this study were to examine whether combined blockade of alpha(1) and beta-adrenoceptors with carvedilol postweaning affected the development of hypertension and renal vascular narrowing in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and whether these effects on pressure and renal vascular changes persisted after treatment withdrawal.", 
    "73": "From 4 to 12 weeks of age male SHR were administered carvedilol in rat chow at 1.2 mg/g chow (low-dose) or 2.4 mg/g chow (high-dose), or were given normal chow. At 12 weeks of age, rats from each group either underwent experimentation or had treatment withdrawn and were studied at 20 weeks. On the experimental day, conscious mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured and, as a functional test of renal vessel lumen characteristics, pressure-flow and pressure-glomerular filtration rate (pressure-GFR) relationships were determined in the maximally dilated kidney.", 
    "74": "At 12 weeks of age, SHR on low and high-dose carvedilol had significantly lower MAP than that of untreated SHR (137 +/- 3, 134 +/- 1, 152 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively; P <.001). The SHR treated with high-dose (but not low-dose) carvedilol demonstrated a steeper renal pressure-flow relationship (P <.001), and a leftward shifted (P <.01) and steeper (P <.001) pressure-GFR relationship compared with control SHR. Eight weeks after carvedilol withdrawal, there were no significant differences in MAP, pressure-flow, or pressure-GFR relationships between groups.", 
    "75": "These results suggest that postweaning alpha(1) and beta-adrenoceptor blockade with high-dose carvedilol attenuated the development of hypertension and led to a preferential reduction in preglomerular resistance (increased lumen dimensions) independent of the effects on MAP. However, treatment of SHR from 4 to 12 weeks of age with high-dose carvedilol did not lead to persistent, long-term effects on arterial pressure or renal vascular narrowing after treatment withdrawal.", 
    "76": "Central aortic systolic blood pressure (BP) is an important determinant of cardiac workload and cardiac hypertrophy. The relationship of central aortic systolic BP and brachial BP varies depending on the stiffness of blood vessels. It is not certain whether the different drug classes affect the brachial and aortic systolic BP in a similar manner. In a double-blind crossover study, we measured the effects of the four major drug classes compared with placebo on central aortic pressure. Central aortic pressure and various indices were determined using the Sphygmo Cor apparatus. The study was undertaken in patients aged 65 to 85 years with systolic BP >150 mm Hg at study entry. Results are reported for 32 patients who had satisfactory applanation tonometry in all five periods. Calcium channel blockers and diuretics caused a greater fall in brachial artery systolic BP than angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blocking drugs. On placebo, central aorta augmentation pressure and index were 23 mm Hg and 33.3%; on ACE inhibitors the values were 18 mm Hg and 30%; on beta-blockers, 26 mm Hg and 38.5%; on calcium channel blockers, 16 mm Hg and 28%; and on diuretics, 17 mm Hg and 28.8%. The augmentation pressure on beta-blocking drugs was greater than on the other three drug classes (P <.05), and augmentation pressures on ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics were less than on placebo (P <.05). The lowest central aortic pressures were achieved with calcium blocking drugs and diuretics. Therapy based on brachial artery recordings may thus overestimate the effect of beta-blocking drugs on central aortic systolic BP and underestimate the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors and calcium blocking drugs. The clinical importance of this discrepancy needs to be evaluated.", 
    "77": "A new method for the determination of enantiomeric compositions of a variety of drugs including propranolol, atenolol, and ibuprofen has been developed. The method is based on the use of the near-infrared technique to measure diastereomeric interactions between an added carbohydrate compound and both enantiomeric forms of a drug followed by evaluation of the data by partial least square analysis. The fact that the method works well with all three macrocyclic carbohydrates with different cavity sizes (i.e., alpha-, beta-, and gamma-cyclodextrin) and with sucrose, which is a linear carbohydrate, clearly demonstrates that it is not necessary to have inclusion complex formation to produce effective diastereomeric interactions. Rather a simple adsorption of the drug onto a carbohydrate is sufficient. Since inclusion complex formation is not a requisite, this method is not limited to the three drugs evaluated in this study but is rather universal as it can, in principle, be used for the sensitive and accurate determination of enantiomeric compositions of many different types of drugs with only about 1.5mg/mL concentration and enantiomeric excess as low as 0.80%, in water or in a mixture of water with organic solvent. Furthermore, it does not rely on the use of rather expensive carbohydrates such as cyclodextrins but is equally as effective even with a simple and inexpensive carbohydrate such as sucrose.",

In addition, isoproterenol was coinfused with the nitric oxide inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) (6.3 micromol/min [n = 6]), with selective blockers of calcium (Ca(++))-dependent potassium (K(+)) channels (tetraethylammonium, 300 microg/min [n = 6]) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K(+) channels (glyburide [INN, glibenclamide], 20 microg/min [n = 6]) or with the cyclic guanosine monophosphate inhibitor methylene blue (13 microg/min [n = 6]).

Coinfusion of isoproterenol and L-NMMA relaxed the veins to the same extent as in the presence of isoproterenol alone. Neither inhibition of ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (P =.196) nor blockade of Ca(++)-dependent K(+) channels (P =.640) modulated isoproterenol-induced venodilation. In contrast, methylene blue reduced the maximum response to isoproterenol by about one third (68.5% +/- 4.3% versus 41.7% +/- 5.5%, P =.001). Infusion of L-NMMA alone raised vein size to 38.8% +/- 6.5%, yielding an L-NMMA-sensitive increase of 20% (P =.001), which was antagonized by coinfusion of potassium chloride to 17.1% +/- 6.7% (P =.02).",

Although a contribution of endothelium-derived nitric oxide appears unlikely, the venodilating effect of L-NMMA could have obscured the nitric oxide component of isoproterenol. beta(2)-Adrenergic receptor-mediated dilation is mediated in part by cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent mechanisms, whereas ATP- and Ca(++)-dependent K(+) channels are not involved, excluding a significant contribution of smooth muscle cell hyperpolarization. In addition, high concentrations of the nitric oxide synthase blocker L-NMMA dilate human hand veins via activation of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors.", 
    "82": "In the present study, young (5-month-old (mo)) and aged (24 mo) adult male Fischer-344 (F344) rats were assigned to experimental groups based upon their performance of a reference memory task in the Morris water maze and reactivity to a novel palatable taste in a gustatory neophobia task. Levels of norepinephrine (NE) and its metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol (MHPG) were assayed via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in brain regions associated with the locus coeruleus (LC)-hippocampus-cortex system and A1/A2-hypothalamic system. Binding of ligands specific for alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, and beta-2 receptors was assessed in hippocampus and cortex with receptor autoradiography. Impaired acquisition and retention of the water maze task and gustatory neophobia in aged rats was primarily associated with decreased NE activity in cingulate cortex (CC) as indicated by a significant reduction in the MHPG/NE ratio coupled with increased NE content. No significant changes in adrenergic receptor binding were detected in any region sampled. The results suggest that an aging-related reduction in cortical NE neurotransmission is associated with the expression of increased neophobia and deficits in spatial learning and memory performance occurring with advanced age in rats.",

The aim of this study was to examine the therapeutic management of heart failure in patients admitted to Tasmania's three major public hospitals, with an assessment of the appropriateness of the therapy according to contemporary published guidelines.", 
    "84": "An extensive range of clinical and demographic data was retrospectively extracted from the medical records of consecutive adult patients admitted to the medical wards of the hospitals with heart failure, either as a primary diagnosis or as a comorbidity, during a 6-month period in late 1999-early 2001.", 
    "85": "The 450 patients (57% females) had a mean age of 77.8 +/- 10.2 years, and were being treated with a median of seven drugs on hospital admission. The percentages of patients being treated with the major drugs of interest were: ACE inhibitors (50%), beta-blockers (22%), spironolactone (15%), digoxin (24%), loop diuretics (65%) and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists (8%). Almost 10% were taking a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent. Less than one-half the patients who were receiving an ACE inhibitor were taking a target dose for heart failure. There were no significant differences in the pattern of drug use between the three hospitals. Underuse of heart failure medications was most pronounced in women and elderly patients.",

    "87": "As dronedarone a new noniodinated antiarrhythmic agent structurally related to amiodarone could inhibit CYP2D6 and is planned to be associated with beta-blockers, interactions with CYP2D6 metabolized beta-blockers such as metoprolol, have to be studied. Forty-nine healthy male subjects genotyped for CYP2D6 were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Metoprolol was administrated during 13 days (200 mg/day). After the initial 5 days, subjects received placebo (n = 12), 800 mg (n = 6), 1200 mg (n = 9), or 1600 mg (n = 17) of dronedarone daily during eight additional days. Pharmacokinetic parameters of metoprolol were investigated at day 5 and at day 13 in 44 subjects, 39 extensive metabolizers and five poor metabolizers for CYP2D6. Cardiac contractility function was evaluated by the rate-corrected electromechanical systole duration (QS2i) and the mean velocity of endocardial circumferential fiber shortening (Vcfmean). Cmax and AUC0--24 h of metoprolol increased from days 5 to 13 in proportion to dronedarone dose only in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers genotyped subjects (P < 0.001). In all subjects, from days 5 to 13, Vcfmean decreased and QS2i significantly increased in dronedarone groups. The Vcfmean changes were however significant only with the 1600 mg dronedarone dose compared with placebo while QS2i changes induced by addition of dronedarone were significant compared with placebo at all dose levels. Between days 5 and 13, QS2i and Vcfmean changes were significantly correlated with both dronedarone concentrations at day 13 and with metoprolol concentration changes between days 5 and 13. Plasma metoprolol concentrations were highest in poor metabolizer subjects and dronedarone did not further increase their level but increased QS2i in the two subjects receiving the 1600 mg dose. Addition of dronedarone (800-1600 mg daily) to metoprolol (200 mg daily) increases bioavailability of metoprolol in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and induces an additive dronedarone dose-dependent negative inotropic effect. Nevertheless at 800 mg daily (anticipated therapeutic dose) these effects were modest.", 
    "88": "This study was designed to investigate the possible synergism of atenolol and amlodipine on lowering and stabilizing blood pressure (BP) in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Sixty-four spontaneously hypertensive rats were randomly divided into eight groups. They were given 0.8% carboxymethylcellulose sodium (control), atenolol (10 mg/kg), amlodipine (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg) and the combinations of atenolol and amlodipine (10 + 0.5, 10 + 1 and 10 + 2 mg/kg), respectively. The drugs were given via a catheter of gastric fistula. BP was recorded for 25 h from 1 h before drug administration to 24 h after administration, in conscious, freely moving rats. It was found that combination of atenolol and amlodipine significantly decreased BP and systolic BP variability. From probability sum analysis it was found that the combination of atenolol and amlodipine, in a proportion as 10 : 1, was the best one (q = 1.54). In conclusion, the present work clearly demonstrated that there is a synergistic effect between atenolol and amlodipine in lowering and stabilizing the BP. The synergistic effect is highest when the dose proportion of the two drugs is 10 : 1.", 
    "89": "The development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is generally thought to correlate with cerebral accumulation of Abeta. It has previously been shown that Abeta peptides enhance vasoconstriction in isolated arteries and oppose certain vasorelaxants. Moreover, exogenous application of Abeta peptides causes cerebral vasoconstriction in rodents and in transgenic mouse models of AD that overexpress Abeta there is reduced cerebral blood flow. In the present study, we investigated the effect of nilvadipine, a dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blocker, on Abeta induced vasoconstriction in isolated arteries and in vivo on cerebral blood flow (CBF) of an AD transgenic mouse model overexpressing Abeta (Tg APPsw line 2576). Nilvadipine completely inhibited the vasoactivity elicited by Abeta in rat aortae and in human middle cerebral arteries. The effect of a short treatment duration (2 weeks) with nilvadipine on regional CBF was investigated in 13-month-old Tg APPsw mice and control littermates using a laser Doppler imager. Additionally, CBF was also measured in 20-month-old Tg APPsw mice and control littermates that were chronically treated with nilvadipine for 7 months. Untreated Tg APPsw mice showed a reduction of regional CBF compared to their untreated control littermates. Nilvadipine restored cortical perfusion levels in Tg APPsw to values similar to those observed in control littermates without notably affecting the CBF of control mice. All together, these data suggest that nilvadipine might be useful for the treatment of oligemia associated with AD.", 
    "90": "The mechanisms of diethylstilbestrol (1 to 30 microM)-induced relaxation on noradrenaline (30 nM)-raised tone in the rat aorta smooth muscle were studied. Neither the increase of calcium content in the medium (3, 6 and 9 mM) nor Bay K 8644 (3, 10 and 100 nM) reversed diethylstilbestrol relaxation. Tamoxifen (3 microM), the quaternary derivate (tamoxifen ethyl bromide, 3 microM), actinomycin D (30 microM), cycloheximide (100 microM), Rp-cAMPS (30 microM), TPCK (1 microM) and difluoromethylornithine (1 mM) inhibited diethylstilbestrol-induced relaxation. Incubation with 2 microg/ml pertussis toxin, propranolol (1 microM), H-7 (10 microM), 2',3'- and 2',5'-dideoxiadenosine (10 and 30 microM, respectively) and methylene blue (10 microM) did not modify diethylstilbestrol-induced relaxation. Our results showed that presumably an activation of membrane mechanisms, protein kinase A activation, genomic mechanisms and polyamine synthesis might participate in diethylstilbestrol-elicited relaxation in addition to the increase in K(ATP) permeability, as previously described. Actinomycin D produces a synergistic effect, with tamoxifen, difluoromethylornithine and glibenclamide antagonizing the effect of diethylstilbestrol. In the case of the association of actinomycin D and glibenclamide, the antagonism of relaxation is complete. The fact that tamoxifen- and difluoromethylornithine-dependent mechanisms participate in diethylstilbestrol relaxation inhibited by glibenclamide suggests that two transduction pathways are involved in the relaxation. Therefore, K(ATP) channels and genomic mechanisms, both modulated by cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent mechanisms, are associated with diethylstilbestrol relaxation.",

    "92": "Eye drop bottles were modified by placing sterile black tape around the bottle tip. Patients on regular timolol therapy were asked to use bottles with the modified tip for one month. They then completed a questionnaire comparing the black tips with the standard tips on the bottle they normally use.", 
    "93": "Eighty-eight per cent of patients found the black tipped bottles easier to use than bottles with the standard tip. Sixty-eight per cent of patients had fewer occasions on which they needed to instil a second drop and 30% of patients touched their eyelid less when using the modified bottle tips.", 
    "94": "Black coloured bottle tips aid ocular therapy. They are easier to use, result in less contact with the eye on instillation and patients note a reduction in need for a second or additional drop. This is likely to improve compliance and reduce contamination. A change in manufacturing practise should be encouraged.", 
    "95": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of replacing current dual local therapy (timolol and pilocarpine) with latanoprost 0.005% in 71 pseudoexfoliation glaucoma patients with controlled intraocular pressure (IOP). 39 patients switched to latanoprost 0.005%) and 32 patients continued timolol-pilocarpine therapy. Mean diurnal (IOP) was measured at baseline, after 0.5, 1, 3 and 6 months of treatment. After 6 months 38 patients with latanoprost and 30 patients with timolol-pilocarpine had completed the study. At baseline the mean diurnal IOP was 20.4 +/- 2.0 mmHg for patients in latanoprost treatment group and 21.4 +/- 2.1 mmHg for patients in timolol-pilocarpine group. At the end of the study, after 6 months of treatment, the mean diurnal IOP values were 16.6 +/- 2.4 and 17.9 +/- 2.0 mmHg respectively. IOP was statistically significantly reduced from baseline (p < 0.001). The mean diurnal IOP change from baseline was -3.3 +/- 0.5 mmHg (mean +/- SEM, ANCOVA) for the patients treated with latanoprost and -3.2 +/- 0.4 mmHg for the patients treated with timolol + pilocarpine. This difference in IOP reduction between groups was not statistically significant (z = 0.69; p = 0.49). This study showed that combination therapy (timolol plus pilocarpine) in pseudoexfoliation glaucoma can effectively be replaced by latanoprost monotherapy.", 
    "96": "Carvedilol ((+/-)-1-carbazol-4-yloxy)-3-[[2-(o-methoxyphenoxy)ethyl]amino]-2-propanol) is metabolized primarily into glucuronide conjugates. In the present study, we identified the human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms involved in the glucuronidation of carvedilol by thin-layer chromatography using microsomes from human liver or insect cells expressing recombinant UGT isoforms. We observed two forms of carvedilol glucuronides, namely G1 and G2, in hepatic microsomes. The glucuronidation of carvedilol was catalyzed by at least three recombinant UGT isoforms: UGT1A1, UGT2B4, and UGT2B7. UGT2B4 formed both G1 and G2, whereas UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 were responsible for the formation of glucuronide G2 and G1, respectively. The enzyme kinetics for carvedilol glucuronidation by UGT1A1, UGT2B4, and UGT2B7 in addition to human liver microsomes were examined by Lineweaver-Burk analysis. The values of Km and Vmax for human liver microsomes were 26.6 microM and 106 pmol/min/mg protein for G1, and 46.0 microM and 44.5 pmol/min/mg protein for G2, respectively. The Km values for UGT1A1, UGT2B4, and UGT2B7 for G1 and G2 (22.1-55.1 microM) were comparable to those of the liver microsomes, whereas the Vmax values were in the range of 3.33 to 7.88 pmol/min/mg protein. The Km and Vmax/Km values for UGT2B4 and UGT2B7 for G1 were similar, whereas UGT2B4 had lower Km and higher Vmax/Km values for G2 compared with those of UGT1A1. These results suggest that G1 formation is catalyzed by UGT2B4 and UGT2B7, whereas G2 is formed by UGT2B4 and UGT1A1. These three hepatic UGT isoforms may have important roles in carvedilol metabolism.", 
    "97": "The effect of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and/or CYP3A on the disposition of xenobiotics has been extensively investigated and is often of interest during drug discovery lead optimization. We have previously described a monkey pharmacokinetic screen to rapidly estimate absorption and first-pass extraction. In the present work, this monkey screen has been expanded to include an assessment of Pgp/CYP3A effects on absorption and first-pass extraction, using ketoconazole as a prototypic dual Pgp/CYP3A inhibitor. To generate a ketoconazole dosing regimen, the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole were first determined in the monkey and were found to be consistent with that previously described in the rat, dog, and human. Dose-ranging experiments demonstrated that a single 10-mg/kg intraduodenal ketoconazole dose would provide an appropriate exposure; this dose was used throughout subsequent interaction experiments. Next, erythromycin and propranolol were explored as positive and negative control substrates for Pgp/CYP3A interactions, respectively. As anticipated, ketoconazole produced no change in the absorption or first-pass extraction of propranolol but resulted in a substantial increase in absorption and decrease in first-pass extraction of erythromycin. Finally, this ketoconazole-based monkey screen was deployed in a drug discovery setting, and examples of such use are presented. These experiments have allowed a more complete characterization of ketoconazole as a prototypic dual Pgp/CYP3A inhibitor and its use as a tool in a preclinical setting and further demonstrate the use of the monkey to investigate the role of Pgp/CYP3A in limiting the oral bioavailability of new drug candidates.", 
    "98": "1. The observation that the immunosuppressants, cyclosporine A (CsA) and tacrolimus, have pressor effects, but sirolimus does not, has led to an hypothesis that generalised sympathoexcitation, resulting from inhibition of calcineurin by CsA and tacrolimus underlies their pressor effects, because sirolimus does not inhibit calcineurin. It is unknown if sirolimus has haemodynamic actions not accompanied by a pressor effect, and whether or not the pressor effects of CsA and tacrolimus are accompanied by similar haemodynamic changes. Therefore, the first aim of our studies was to investigate these possibilities in conscious, chronically-instrumented, male, Sprague-Dawley rats. 2. CsA (5.9 mg kg(-1) bolus i.v.) caused rapid-onset, prolonged hypertension, tachycardia and mesenteric vasoconstriction. There was a slower onset renal vasoconstriction, but no significant change in hindquarters vascular conductance; all the effects of CsA were significantly greater than those of vehicle. CsA given by infusion (over 30 min or 2 h) caused changes qualitatively similar to those above. Repeated administration of CsA over 4 days did not enhance its cardiovascular effects. 3. Pretreatment with the angiotensin (AT(1)) receptor antagonist, losartan, and the endothelin (ET(A) and ET(B)) receptor antagonist, SB 209670, reduced the pressor and mesenteric vasoconstrictor effects of CsA. Additional administration of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine, completely inhibited the cardiovascular effects of CsA. 4. Tacrolimus (450 microg kg(-1) bolus i.v.) caused similar peak pressor and tachycardic effects to CsA, but these were much slower in onset, and were maximal when there were no significant regional vasoconstrictions, indicating that the pressor effect was probably due to a rise in cardiac output. However, although propranolol reversed the tachycardic effect of tacrolimus, it did not influence the pressor response. 5. Sirolimus (450 microg kg(-1) bolus i.v.) had no tachycardic action, and only a modest, transient pressor effect, accompanied by equally brief reductions in renal, mesenteric, and hindquarters vascular conductances. 6. The differences between the regional haemodynamic profiles of equipressor doses of CsA and tacrolimus, and the finding that sirolimus has significant cardiovascular actions, indicate that generalised sympathoexcitation, resulting from calcineurin inhibition (with CsA and tacrolimus), is unlikely to be the sole explanation of their pressor effects.", 
    "99": "1. Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) are pacemaker cells that activate the periodic spontaneous inward currents (pacemaker currents) responsible for the production of slow waves in gastrointestinal smooth muscle. The effects of noradrenaline on the pacemaker currents in cultured ICCs from murine small intestine were investigated by using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques at 30 degrees C. 2. Under current clamping, ICCs had a mean resting membrane potential of -58+/-5 mV and produced electrical slow waves. Under voltage clamping, ICCs produced pacemaker currents with a mean amplitude of -410+/-57 pA and a mean frequency of 16+/-2 cycles min(-1). 3. Under voltage clamping, noradrenaline inhibited the amplitude and frequency of pacemaker currents and increased resting currents in the outward direction in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were reduced by intracellular GDP beta S. 4. Noradrenaline-induced effects were blocked by propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist). However, neither prazosin (alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist) nor yohimbine (alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist) blocked the noradrenaline-induced effects. Phenylephrine (alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist) had no effect on the pacemaker currents, whereas isoprenaline (beta-adrenoceptor agonist) mimicked the effect of noradrenaline. Atenolol (beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist) blocked the noradrenaline-induced effects, but butoxamine (beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist) did not. In addition, BRL37344 (beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist) had no effect on pacemaker currents. 5. 9-(Tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-9H-purine-6-amine (SQ-22536; adenylate cyclase inhibitor) and a myristoylated protein kinase A inhibitor did not inhibit the noradrenaline-induced effects and 8-bromo-cAMP had no effects on pacemaker currents. 8-Bromo-cGMP and SNAP inhibited pacemaker currents and these effects of SNAP were blocked by 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; a guanylate cyclase inhibitor). However, ODQ did not block the noradrenaline-induced effects. 6. Neither tetraethylammonium (a voltage-dependent K(+) channel blocker), apamin (a Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channel blocker) nor glibenclamide (an ATP-sensitive K(+) channel blocker) blocked the noradrenaline-induced effects. 7. The results suggest that noradrenaline-induced stimulation of beta(1)-adrenoceptors in the ICCs inhibits pacemaker currents, and that this is mediated by the activation of G-protein. Neither adenylate cyclase, guanylate cyclase nor a K(+) channel-dependent pathway are involved in this effect of noradrenaline.",

The enantiomeric ratios for several beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists at the cloned mouse, rat and human beta(3)-adrenoceptor were less than those reported at the cloned beta(1)-/beta(2)-adrenoceptor but higher than those reported in previous studies. The degree of stereoselectivity was relatively low for the agonists isoprenaline and noradrenaline but higher for antagonists and, in particular, tertatolol and propranolol. In mouse ileum, stereoselectivity of propranolol and tertatolol was observed under beta(1)-/beta(2)-adrenoceptor blockade. The (-)-enantiomers of propranolol and tertatolol were more effective at antagonism of (-)-isoprenaline-mediated relaxation of mouse ileum than their (+)-enantiomers. The recombinant mouse, rat and human beta(3)-adrenoceptors display stereoselective interactions for agonists and antagonists similar to the stereoselective profile of beta(3)-adrenoceptors in mouse ileum. The degree of stereoselectivity varied between species and the human beta(3)-adrenoceptor displayed higher affinities and enantiomeric ratios than the mouse or rat beta(3)-adrenoceptors.",

True anaphylaxis is a systemic reaction caused by antigen-specific cross-linking of IgE molecules or complement proteins on the surface of tissue mast cells and peripheral blood basophils, resulting in the immediate release of potent mediators. Immediate systemic reactions that resemble anaphylaxis but are not caused by an IgE-mediated immune response are referred to as anaphylactoid reactions.

    "102": "Strong cation exchange (SCX)-type chiral stationary phases (CSPs) based on beta-amino sulfonic acid-terminated dipeptide derivatives as chiral selectors, immobilized on thiol-modified silica particles (3.5 microm), were synthesized and applied to enantiomer separations of chiral bases by nonaqueous capillary electrochromatography (CEC). The effect of structural variations of the sulfodipeptide selectors on the separation factors alpha was investigated. These studies included variation of the acid-terminal amino sulfonic acid residue, variation of the configurations, i.e., comparison of the diastereomeric (S,S)- and (R,S)-configurations of the sulfodipeptides, and finally comparison of sulfodipeptide selectors with corresponding beta-amino sulfonic acid analogs. In general, the capillary columns (100 microm ID) packed with the new SCX-type CSPs showed enantioselectivity for an elaborated set of chiral basic drugs in CEC acting by an enantioselective cation-exchange retention mechanism. N-[N-(4-Allyloxy-3,5-dichlorobenzoyl)-leucyl]-2-amino-3,3-dimethylbutane sulfonic acid, in particular with (R,S)-configuration, turned out to be a more effective SCX-type selector than a more rigid analog based on N-[N-(4-Allyloxy-3,5-dichlorobenzoyl)-leucyl]-2-pyrrolidinemethane sulfonic acid. Both of the former diastereomers were capable to baseline-resolve the enantiomers of ca. 40% of the tested basic chiral solutes including sympathomimetics and beta-blockers, while for the latter SCX-type CSPs only 10-20% of the selected solutes afforded resolutions > 1.5.", 
    "103": "Carvedilol is a multiple-action drug with alpha(1)- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonistic, calcium channel blocker and antioxidant activities especially useful in the treatment of hypertension. The antioxidant activity of the drug depends on the carbazole moiety, which is unique to carvedilol and is also present in some of the metabolites lacking either the alpha(1)- or beta-adrenergic receptor blocking activity. These antioxidant properties account for the exceptional ability of carvedilol to reduce cardiac necrosis in animal models of myocardial infarction, as well as its neuroprotective activities in in vivo and in vitro models of brain ischemia. A further property of carvedilol is its ability to inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation, and neointima formation, after vascular injuries. The identification of all these activities of carvedilol indicates that it is a singular multiple-action antihypertensive agent with potential for cardiovascular organ protection beyond the normalization of high blood pressure.",

Relevant studies were identified by systematic searches of the literature for all reported studies of associations between beta-blocker underuse and secondary prevention of MI. Additional studies were identified by a hand search of references of original or review articles.", 
    "110": "English-language human studies were selected and analyzed.", 
    "111": "Associations were observed in studies of beta-blocker use as secondary prevention of MI. A lower rate of beta-blocker treatment occurred in older patients and in patients with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and peripheral arterial disease. In addition, underuse was attributed to the perception of high rates of adverse events associated with beta-blockers. beta-Blocker use as secondary prevention of an MI can lead to a 19-48% decrease in mortality and up to a 28% decrease in reinfarction rates. Nonetheless, beta-blockers are significantly underused in many patient populations due to concomitant disease states. Due to their normal physiologic deterioration, the elderly are at an increased risk of low cardiac output and bradycardia when given a beta-blocker; therefore, they should be started on a low dose that is then slowly titrated. In diabetic patients, beta-blockers can impair glucose control leading to hypoglycemia; therefore, post-MI diabetic patients must routinely monitor their blood glucose levels. In patients with decompensated heart failure, beta-blocker use can lead to further cardiac depression, but lower oral starting doses with slow titration can reduce this risk. beta-Blockers can induce bronchospasm in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, but cardioselective beta-blockers and appropriate use of medications such as albuterol can minimize these effects. Finally, in patients with peripheral arterial disease, with the exception of hypertensive patients with Reynaud's phenomenon, beta-blockers can be used safely. The only absolute contraindications to beta-blockers are severe bradycardia, preexisting sick sinus syndrome, second- and third-degree atrioventricular block, severe left ventricular dysfunction, active peripheral vascular disease with rest ischemia, or reactive airway disease so severe that airway support is required.",

    "113": "Previous studies have outlined an important role for serotonin (5-HT) in the development of synaptic connectivity and function in the cerebral cortex. In this study, we have examined the effects of 5-HT on synaptic function in prefrontal cortex at a time of intense synapse formation and remodelling. Whole-cell recordings in slices derived from animals aged postnatal (P) days 16-20 showed that administration of 5-HT induced a robust increase in synaptic activity that was blocked by CNQX but not by bicuculline. This 5-HT-induced increase in glutamate-mediated synaptic activity was pharmacologically heterogeneous as it was differentially inhibited by the receptor subtype-selective antagonists SB-269970, MDL 100907 and GR 113808 and thus involved 5-HT(7), 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(4) receptors. These results, obtained in juvenile cortex, contrast with those seen in adults where the increase in spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) was mediated solely by 5-HT(2A) receptors. In developing cortex, activation of 5-HT(7), but not 5-HT(2A) or 5-HT(4) receptors, elicited a robust inward current. However, the facilitation of synaptic activity mediated by all three of these receptors involved increases in both the amplitude and frequency of sEPSCs and was blocked by TTX. These results are best interpreted as indicating that all three receptor subtypes increase synaptic activity by exciting neuronal elements within the slice. No evidence was found for a postsynaptic facilitation of synaptic currents by 5-HT. Together, these results show that the repertoire of electrophysiologically active 5-HT receptors in prefrontal cortex is developmentally regulated, and that 5-HT(7) and 5-HT(4) receptors play a previously unsuspected role in regulating synaptic activity in this region.", 
    "114": "Rhythms in pineal melatonin synthesis are controlled by the biological clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei. The endogenous clock oscillations rely upon genetic mechanisms involving clock genes coding for transcription factors working in negative and positive feedback loops. Most of these clock genes are expressed rhythmically in other tissues. Because of the peculiar role of the pineal gland in the photoneuroendocrine axis regulating biological rhythms, we studied whether clock genes are expressed in the rat pineal gland and how their expression is regulated.Per1, Per3, Cry2 and Cry1 clock genes are expressed in the pineal gland and their transcription is increased during the night. Analysis of the regulation of these pineal clock genes indicates that they may be categorized into two groups. Expression of Per1 and Cry2 genes shows the following features: (1) the 24 h rhythm persists, although damped, in constant darkness; (2) the nocturnal increase is abolished following light exposure or injection with a beta-adrenergic antagonist; and (3) the expression during daytime is stimulated by an injection with a beta-adrenergic agonist. In contrast, Per3 and Cry1 day and night mRNA levels are not responsive to adrenergic ligands (as previously reported for Per2) and daily expression of Per3 and Cry1 appears strongly damped or abolished in constant darkness. These data show that the expression of Per1 and Cry2 in the rat pineal gland is regulated by the clock-driven changes in norepinephrine, in a similar manner to the melatonin rhythm-generating enzyme arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase. The expression of Per3 and Cry1 displays a daily rhythm not regulated by norepinephrine, suggesting the involvement of another day/night regulated transmitter(s).",

Nonselective beta-blockers combined with vasodilatory drugs result in enhanced lowering of portal pressures by targeting several mechanisms involved in this process. Unfortunately, this practice is associated with increased adverse effects, such as hypotension, and minimal reductions in mortality. Carvedilol possesses both nonselective beta-antagonist and alpha1-receptor antagonist activity. Given its combined mechanism of action, carvedilol presents a potential option for lowering portal pressures. Its effects on lowering portal pressures and its role in therapy are undefined. Using MEDLINE (1966-2003) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-2003), the English-language literature was searched to identify human studies assessing carvedilol's effects on lowering portal pressure. In general, carvedilol therapy was associated with mean reductions of 16-43% in portal pressure, assessed by the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) after single and multiple doses. Studies comparing carvedilol with propranolol revealed equal or enhanced efficacy in lowering HVPG. Large percentages of patients had significant HVPG reductions to levels that prevent variceal bleeding. Carvedilol also was associated with substantial symptomatic hypotension, especially in patients with ascites or Child-Pugh class B or C cirrhosis. Efficacy and adverse effects generally seem to be dose related. Carvedilol appears to be a potentially viable option for treating portal hypertension. Further multiple-dose trials comparing carvedilol with standard therapy are needed to assess the agent's long-term safety and effectiveness in preventing variceal bleeding.", 
    "116": "In this article, we document how an interdisciplinary committee of health professionals led to an approximate 50% reduction in the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) following a cardiac surgery procedure by using preoperative loading and dosing of PO amiodarone and beta blockade. Patients in this report (n = 3397) included all coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) and valve replacement/repair procedures from January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2002. The incidence of postoperative AF for a CABG or valve replacement/repair procedure was 19.0% for period A (preprotocol) and 13.5% for period B (postprotocol). This translates into an absolute risk reduction of 5.5% or 113 actual cases of postoperative AF reduced. The role of the clinical practice specialist, a master's prepared nurse, and participation in the national Society of Thoracic Surgeon's database allowed us to track our CABG outcomes, benchmark our outcomes against both national and regional institutions, and make changes in outcomes incidence through performance improvement.", 
    "117": "Increased production of terpenes and many other aroma-related volatiles occurs with the onset of ripening in apple ( Malus domestica Borkh.) fruit. The gaseous plant hormone ethylene plays a key role in the induction of volatile synthesis, but the mechanism is not yet understood. Using a degenerate primer based on a short conserved sequence shared by several sesquiterpene synthases, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with RNA isolated from peel tissue of 'Law Rome' apples yielded an approx. 800-bp gene fragment. This was used to screen a cDNA library generated from the peel tissue mRNA. A full-length terpene synthase (TS) cDNA 1,931 nucleotides long was isolated. The 1,728-bp open reading frame encodes a protein 576 amino acids long with a molecular mass of 66 kDa. Sequence analysis of the apple TS showed it to be most similar to several monoterpene synthases. Oddly, the TS includes an RR(X(8))W motif near the N-terminus that is common among monoterpene synthases but it lacks the plastid transit peptide sequence typically associated with genes of that group. Expression of the apple TS gene in Escherichia coli gave myc-epitope-tagged and untagged proteins estimated at approx. 68 and approx. 66 kDa, respectively. In assays of sesquiterpene synthase activity, with farnesyl diphosphate as substrate, the untagged bacterially expressed TS gene product synthesized ( E, E)-alpha-farnesene almost exclusively. In monoterpene synthase assays, with geranyl diphosphate as substrate, the untagged apple TS produced only ( E)-beta-ocimene, albeit at much reduced levels. Addition of a C-terminal myc tag appeared to completely prevent production of soluble protein under all of the expression conditions tested. This is the first report of an ( E, E)-alpha-farnesene synthase gene ( AFS1; GenBank accession number AY182241) from a flowering plant. RNA gel blots showed that AFS1 transcript increased about 4-fold in peel tissue of apple fruit during the first 4 weeks of storage at 0.5 degrees C. In contrast, when fruit were treated at harvest with 1-methylcyclopropene, a blocker of ethylene action, AFS1 mRNA declined sharply over the initial 4 weeks of cold storage, and fell to nearly undetectable levels by 8 weeks.", 
    "118": "Cardiovascular reactivity is hypothesized to increase the risk of hypertension and other CVD-related conditions. However, studies to date are inconclusive. We compared the association of blood pressure and pulse responses to three stressors (postural challenge, handgrip test, mental arithmetic) with sociodemographic characteristics and CVD risk factors. We included 782 participants from the Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Study. Blood pressure and pulse responses to stressors were defined as the difference between post- and pre-stress measurements. Stepwise regression analyses examined change in SBP and pulse in response to stressors as a function of sociodemographic and CVD risk factors. Age, race, and gender were forced into models and other variables (education, BMI, waist circumference, resting SBP and DBP, cigarette smoking, LDL and HDL cholesterol, glucose, and antihypertensive medications (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, ace inhibitors)) were retained if P<0.10. Age was a significant predictor of SBP response to all stressors. The SBP response to a change in posture was not related to other variables. The SBP response to mental arithmetic was significantly higher among men, those with larger waists, higher SBP, beta-blocker users, and lower among smokers. SBP response to the handgrip was significantly higher among those with higher SBP and beta-blocker users. Similarly, the association of the pulse response to the risk factors varied considerably across the stressors. Overall, the socio-demographic and CVD risk factors accounted for between 9 and 14% of the variance in the SBP response to the stressors and from between 4 and 12% of the variance in the pulse response to the three stressors. The associations between sociodemographic and CVD risk factors and the SBP and pulse response to stress were modest and inconsistent across stressors. The findings suggest that cardiovascular reactivity is a concept that needs to be defined in reference to specific stressors so that mechanisms leading to responses can be better understood.", 
    "119": "Results from clinical trials suggest that antiarrhythmic drugs (AD) can facilitate electrical cardioversion (EC) for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) (duration >48 hours, no spontaneous termination) by suppression of immediate reinitiation of AF following the procedure. Class IC agents may increase the atrial defibrillation threshold (DFT) by significantly reducing the availability of Na+-channel for depolarization. In contrast, class III agents may decrease the atrial DFT by markedly prolonging atrial refractoriness. Among all AD, ibutilide and amoidarone have been shown to be most effective in enhancing the acute outcome of EC. In patients who are over 65 years of age at high risks of stroke (e.g., atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, previous thromboembolism, etc.), the rhythm control strategy offers no survival advantage over the rate control strategy and frequently subjects patients to serious adverse effects of AD therapy. It can not be overemphasized that adequate anticoagulation (INR 2.0-3.0) with warfarin is needed regardless of whichever strategy is chosen unless there are contraindications. On the other hand, in patients who are under 65 years of age without structural heart disease or other risk factors of stroke, rhythm control can be the treatment of choice. Specifically, if a patient has failed EC alone or if the patient has characteristics (e.g., duration of AF >6 months, left atrium >50 mm, etc.) that EC could fail, AD may be given before the procedure to facilitate EC. In the subgroup of patients who are symptomatic with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe diastolic dysfunction requiring maintenance of sinus rhythm to have sufficient ventricular function for optimization of cardiac output, an aggressive approach for rhythm control with amiodarone along with adequate anticoagulation with warfarin should be encouraged.", 
    "120": "Many patients with atrial fibrillation develop symptoms attributable to the cardiac arrhythmia itself. These symptoms may be improved either by restoring sinus rhythm or by controlling the rapid and irregular ventricular response that often accompanies this arrhythmia. One of the principal goals of therapy of atrial fibrillation management is improvement of patient symptoms; it is important to quantify these symptoms by some form of quality of life analysis. The Canadian Trial of Atrial Fibrillation (CTAF) was a multi-centre randomized clinical trial of amiodarone compared with either propafenone or sotalol in patients with recent atrial fibrillation. The quality of life (QOL) substudy of CTAF was a prospective, comprehensive assessment of quality of life of patients enrolled in CTAF. Summary measures of physical and mental health on the generic QOL scale (SF-36) improved significantly with treatment from baseline to 3 months (41.9 +/- 9.6 to 43.7 +/- 9.2, p = 0.001 for the physical component and 47.5 +/- 10.4 to 49.0 +/- 9.8, p = 0.023 for the mental component). On an arrhythmia specific scale (SCL), a significant and larger improvement was noted from baseline to 3 months in both arrhythmia symptom frequency and severity (symptom frequency from 20.4 +/- 9.4 to 16.2 +/- 9.5, symptom severity from 16.7 +/- 8.2 to 12.9 +/- 7.6, both p < 0.001). The quality of life improvements were similar in the amiodarone group compared to the sotalol or propafenone groups, both for the SF-36 and the disease-specific symptom checklist (SCL) measures. In contrast, an atrial fibrillation severity scale (AFSS) did show differences between the assigned drug therapies, which were associated with different rates of arrhythmia recurrence in the parent study. By 3 months global well-being was significantly worse for patients who had recurrent atrial fibrillation compared to those who did not (6.9 +/- 1.8 versus 7.4 +/- 1.8, p = 0.04). Similarly, symptom severity at 3 months was 11.8 +/- 7.4 for patients without recurrence, compared to 14.8 +/- 7.4 for those with recurrence ( p = 0.001). Interestingly, none of the usual clinical variables that might be perceived to be associated with quality of life, e.g., male versus female sex, age, NYHA class, beta blocker use, and ejection fraction, had much impact on subjective quality of life measures. Quality of life improves with treatment atrial fibrillation and at least some of these improvements are related to the restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm.",

The first secondary endpoint of mortality plus hospitalization for heart failure was reduced by 31% ( p = 0.0000008). The results were remarkably consistent for both primary outcomes and the first secondary outcome across all predefined subgroups as well as nearly all post-hoc subgroups. Metoprolol CR/XL has been very well tolerated, overall as well as in all subgroups analyzed. Overall 87% of the patients reached a dose of 100 mg or more of metoprolol CR/XL once daily, and 64% reached the target dose of 200 mg once daily.", 
    "126": "Our results show that when carefully titrated, metoprolol CR/XL can safely be instituted for the overwhelming majority of outpatients with clinically stable systolic heart failure, with minimal side effects or deterioration. The time has come to overcome the barriers that physicians perceive to beta-blocker treatment, and to provide it to the large number of patients with heart failure in need of this therapy, including also high risk patients like elderly patients, patients with severe heart failure, and patients with diabetes. Because of the increased risk, these are the patients in whom treatment will have the greatest impact as shown by number of lives saved and number of hospitalizations avoided. The target dose should be strived for in all patients who tolerate this dose. We should expect some variation of the treatment effect around the overall estimate as we examine a large number of subgroups due to small sample size in subgroups and due to chance. However, we believe that the best estimate of treatment effect for any particular subgroup should be the overall effect observed in the trial.", 
    "127": "Heart failure is a serious disorder associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Approximately 15-30% patients with systolic heart failure are in atrial fibrillation and the proportion increases with severity of heart failure. Patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation have worse outcome than those in sinus rhythm. Beta-blockers, together with angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors, are the standard therapy in patients with chronic heart failure. Retrospective studies have suggested that despite the improvement in left ventricular systolic function after treatment with beta-blockers, the exercise capacity and symptoms in those heart failure patients with atrial fibrillation was not improved as much as those in sinus rhythm. Moreover, the use of bisoprolol in the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II, unlike those in sinus rhythm, failed to produce any survival benefit in patients with poor systolic function and atrial fibrillation. It seems that those patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation may have different response to beta-blocker therapy. Prospective trials to clarify the impact of beta-blocker therapy and the optimal therapeutic strategy in this high-risk group of patients are warranted.", 
    "128": "Large randomized trials have demonstrated that beta-blocker treatment reduces morbidity and mortality in patients in chronic heart failure. Questions remain about the influence of individual characteristics on the magnitude of the benefit of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure including the influence of heart rate and cardiac rhythm. In the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II, baseline heart rate and heart rate change over time had prognostic value but treatment with bisoprolol was associated with a benefit at all levels of baseline heart rate and additional benefit related to heart rate slowing was observed. In the subgroup of patients with atrial fibrillation, morbidity and mortality rates were similar in placebo and bisoprolol treated patients. It is possible that patients with atrial fibrillation had a higher level of sympathetic stimulation that would have required higher doses of bisoprolol to achieve a similar level of beta-blockade. Alternatively, the failure to observe improved outcome in the subgroup with atrial fibrillation may have been due to chance. However, because this finding was not observed in other large trials, and because there was no clear explanation, it should not be concluded that patients with chronic heart failure and atrial fibrillation do not benefit from beta-blockade.", 
    "129": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is present in a significant number of patients with heart failure (HF) caused by left ventricular systolic dysfunction and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The deleterious interaction of AF and HF is mediated through a number of mechanisms including hemodynamic alterations and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Beta-blockers have been shown to improve symptoms and survival in patients with HF. In addition, beta-blockers have been used in patients with AF, primarily for rate control. A retrospective analysis of the U.S. Carvedilol Heart Failure Trial demonstrated that carvedilol improves outcomes in the high-risk subgroup of patients with HF and concomitant AF.", 
    "130": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent arrhythmia that is difficult to treat and generates important health care costs. One consideration in the selection of various therapeutic options is the cost of a given treatment compared to that of alternatives. The Canadian Trial of Atrial Fibrillation (CTAF) evaluated the effectiveness of sinus rhythm maintenance with amiodarone compared to propafenone or sotalol in a prospective, randomized fashion. A subsequent CTAF substudy of the medical costs associated with amiodarone vs. propafenone/sotalol found that amiodarone decreased AF-related costs. This paper reviews the results of the CTAF cost-analysis substudy in the context of other analyses in the literature of the cost effectiveness of amiodarone in AF. The costs associated with amiodarone therapy are no greater than for other sinus rhythm maintenance drugs, and for some cost categories and some patient subgroups are likely to be less, despite amiodarone's greater therapeutic efficacy. However, additional considerations are important in evaluating the clinical place of amiodarone, including its adverse effect and pharmacokinetic profile. As well, the results of recent randomized clinical trials have highlighted the limitations of sinus rhythm maintenance as a primary therapeutic objective in AF. The decision about whether and at what point to use amiodarone in a given patient requires a careful analysis of the individual case, in terms of symptomatology during AF, the response to previous treatment regimes, and risk factors for various forms of adverse drug reactions.",

    "148": "Inhibition of ATP-sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channels by an increase in the ATP/ADP ratio and the resultant membrane depolarization are considered essential in the process leading to insulin release (IR) from pancreatic beta-cells stimulated by glucose. It is therefore surprising that mice lacking the sulfonylurea type 1 receptor (SUR1-/-) in beta-cells remain euglycemic even though the knockout is expected to cause hypoglycemia. To complicate matters, isolated islets of SUR1-/- mice secrete little insulin in response to high glucose, which extrapolates to hyperglycemia in the intact animal. It remains thus unexplained how euglycemia is maintained. In recognition of the essential role of neural and endocrine regulation of IR, we evaluated the effects of acetylcholine (ACh) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) on IR and free intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) of freshly isolated or cultured islets of SUR1-/- mice and B6D2F1 controls (SUR1+/+). IBMX, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, was also used to explore cAMP-dependent signaling in IR. Most striking, and in contrast to controls, SUR1-/-) islets are hypersensitive to ACh and IBMX, as demonstrated by a marked increase of IR even in the absence of glucose. The hypersensitivity to ACh was reproduced in control islets by depolarization with the SUR1 inhibitor glyburide. Pretreatment of perifused SUR1-/- islets with ACh or IBMX restored glucose stimulation of IR, an effect expectedly insensitive to diazoxide. The calcium channel blocker verapamil reduced but did not abolish ACh-stimulated IR, supporting a role for intracellular Ca2+ stores in stimulus-secretion coupling. The effect of ACh on IR was greatly potentiated by GLP-1 (10 nM). ACh caused a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i at 0.1-1 microM or biphasic changes (an initial sharp increase in [Ca2+]i followed by a sustained phase of low [Ca2+]i) at 1-100 microM. The latter effects were observed in substrate-free medium or in the presence of 16.7 mM glucose. We conclude that SUR1 deletion depolarizes the beta-cells and markedly elevates basal [Ca2+]i. Elevated [Ca2+]i in turn sensitizes the beta-cells to the secretory effects of ACh and IBMX. Priming by the combination of high [Ca2+]i, ACh, and GLP-1 restores the defective glucose responsiveness, precluding the development of diabetes but not effectively enough to cause hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.",

Twenty hours after the last multiple (7 days) oral administration, propranolol (100 mg/kg b.w.) decreased NADPH cytochrome c reductase activity and cytochrome P-450-dependent dealkylation of 7-benzyloxyresorufin (BROD) (CYP1A1, 2A1, 3A1) and 7-ethoxyresorufin (EROD) (CYP1A1) in RTII, while glutathione-S-transferase (GST), DT-diaphorase (QR), gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT) activities, intracellular reduced glutathione level and dealkylation of 7-pentoxyresorufin (PROD) (CYP2B1) were not changed. It was found that propranolol significantly increased NADPH cytochrome c reductase and BROD activities in RAM. The results suggest a different susceptibility of RTII and RAM to propranolol and its contrary effects on lung xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme activities in both types of cells.", 
    "159": "Many patients with chronic angina experience anginal episodes despite revascularization and antianginal medications. In a previous trial, antianginal monotherapy with ranolazine, a drug believed to partially inhibit fatty acid oxidation, increased treadmill exercise performance; however, its long-term efficacy and safety have not been studied in combination with beta-blockers or calcium antagonists in a large patient population with severe chronic angina.", 
    "160": "To determine whether, at trough levels, ranolazine improves the total exercise time of patients who have symptoms of chronic angina and who experience angina and ischemia at low workloads despite taking standard doses of atenolol, amlodipine, or diltiazem and to determine times to angina onset and to electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia, effect on angina attacks and nitroglycerin use, and effect on long-term survival in an open-label observational study extension.", 
    "161": "A randomized, 3-group parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 823 eligible adults with symptomatic chronic angina who were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 1 of 2 doses of ranolazine. Patients treated at the 118 participating ambulatory outpatient settings in several countries were enrolled in the Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina (CARISA) trial from July 1999 to August 2001 and followed up through October 31, 2002.", 
    "162": "Patients received twice-daily placebo or 750 mg or 1000 mg of ranolazine. Treadmill exercise 12 hours (trough) and 4 hours (peak) after dosing was assessed after 2, 6 (trough only), and 12 weeks of treatment.", 
    "163": "Change in exercise duration, time to onset of angina, time to onset of ischemia, nitroglycerin use, and number of angina attacks.", 
    "164": "Trough exercise duration increased by 115.6 seconds from baseline in both ranolazine groups (pooled) vs 91.7 seconds in the placebo group (P =.01). The times to angina and to electrocardiographic ischemia also increased in the ranolazine groups, at peak more than at trough. The increases did not depend on changes in blood pressure, heart rate, or background antianginal therapy and persisted throughout 12 weeks. Ranolazine reduced angina attacks and nitroglycerin use by about 1 per week vs placebo (P<.02). Survival of 750 patients taking ranolazine during the CARISA trial or its associated long-term open-label study was 98.4% in the first year and 95.9% in the second year.", 
    "165": "Twice-daily doses of ranolazine increased exercise capacity and provided additional antianginal relief to symptomatic patients with severe chronic angina taking standard doses of atenolol, amlodipine, or diltiazem, without evident adverse, long-term survival consequences over 1 to 2 years of therapy.", 
    "166": "A large number of ethnic Chinese and other oriental populations are living in the West because of the modern day migration of people. Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis attributable to thyrotoxicosis is a common presentation in an Asian emergency department. It is uncommon in the white communities. There is a difference in the genetic type in the different racial groups. Thyrotoxic features are often masked or absent. Life may be threatened because of severe hypokalaemia and therefore a prompt diagnosis of this condition in the certain ethnic group presenting with weakness and hypokalaemia is essential. Thyroid function studies are mandatory in these cases.", 
    "167": "Increased Na+/Ca(2+)-exchanger (NCX) and altered beta-adrenoceptor (betaAR) responses are observed in failing human heart. To determine the possible interaction between these changes, we investigated the effect of NCX overexpression on responses to isoproterenol in adult rat ventricular myocytes. Responses to isoproterenol were largely mediated through the beta1AR in control myocytes. Adenovirally-mediated overexpression of NCX, at levels, which did not alter basal contraction of myocytes, markedly depressed the isoproterenol concentration-response curve. Responses to isoproterenol could be restored to normal by beta2AR blockade, suggesting a beta2AR-mediated inhibition of beta1AR signalling. Pertussis toxin normalised isoproterenol responses in NCX cells, indicating that beta2AR effects were mediated by Gi. Negative-inotropic effects of high concentrations of ICI 118,551, previously shown to be due to beta2AR-Gi coupling, were increased in NCX cells. We conclude that NCX upregulation can markedly alter the consequences of betaAR stimulation and that this may contribute to the alterations in betaAR response seen in failing human heart.", 
    "168": "We investigated the dose-escalation profile of dorzolamide used in combination with other antiglaucoma agents in patients with primary glaucoma and ocular hypertension. In a prospective, open-label study, 78 patients received dorzolamide 0.5% in addition to other topical antiglaucoma agents for > or =4 weeks. The concentration of dorzolamide was then escalated to 1.0% and intraocular pressure (IOP) measured every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. Dose escalation of dorzolamide from 0.5% to 1.0% resulted in a significant reduction in IOP throughout the 12 weeks of treatment at the higher dose. Mean baseline IOP was 19.7 mmHg. At 4, 8, and 12 weeks after dose escalation, mean IOP had decreased to 17.8 (-9.4%), 17.6 (-10.8%), and 17.5 (-10.7%) mmHg. No serious drug-related adverse effects were reported. These results indicate that dose escalation of dorzolamide from 0.5% to 1.0% is effective and well tolerated as adjunctive therapy for patients in whom IOP is insufficiently controlled by combination therapy."
