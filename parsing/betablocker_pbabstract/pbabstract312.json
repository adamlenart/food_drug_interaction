Thirty-five eligible patients with atrial fibrillation of > 12 hours and < 7 days were enrolled in the study. Patients were classified as vagally mediated (group I, n: 14) and adrenergically mediated (group II, n: 21) PAF groups. All patients were given racemic sotalol at a dose up to 120 mg bid for 2 days. At the end of the observation period of 48 hours, 36% of patients (n: five) in group I returned to sinus rhythm. Conversion rate in group II was 71% (n: 15), and this figure was significantly higher than the success rate in group I. Mean times to cardioversion were 22 +/- 15 hours in group I and 16 +/- 14 hours in group II (p < 0.05). The result of this study suggests that oral sotalol is more effective for adrenergic PAF. This beneficial effect of sotalol is not apparent in vagal PAF patients.", 
    "1": "Myocardial ischemia and reperfusion result in endothelial and ventricular dysfunction. Beta-blockers protect the myocytes from injury by acting as anti-ischemia agents. These anti-ischemic effects of the beta-blockers are due not only to their negative inotropic/chronotropic effects but also to a lipid peroxidation reducing mechanism. Thus, beta-blockers enhance myocardial recovery. In the present study 20 isolated guinea-pig hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB) using a Langendorff apparatus. The animals were allocated into 2 groups. In the study group (Group I), metoprolol, as the beta-blocker agent, was added into the KHB and in the control group (Group II) perfusion was performed without metoprolol. The percentage change (%change) of heart rate, developed pressure and dP/dtmax; malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels of the perfusate and heart tissue were obtained as data. The %change of heart rate was 70.5+/-9.2 in the study group and 87.3+/-8.2 in the control (p = 0.003). The %change of developed pressure was 68.7+/-14.4 and 55.9+/-8.6 in the study group and control group, respectively (p = 0.04). The % change of dP/dt was 63.3+/-10.0 in the study group and 54.4+/-5.3 in the control group (p = 0.01). The tissue MDA level was 31.0+/-5.5 nmol/g tissue in the study group and 53.5+/-4.2 nmol/g tissue in the control group (p = 0.0002). The tissue GSH levels were 1.08+/-0.20 and 0.80+/-0.07 (mol/g tissue) in Groups I and II, respectively (p = 0.001). The levels of the perfusate MDA decreased and the levels of the perfusate GSH increased significantly in the metoprolol group in the postreperfusion period in comparison with the preischemia term (p = 0.003 and p = 0.03, respectively). Metoprolol reduces ischemic injury via prevention of lipid peroxidation and reduces the myocardial energy demand by decreasing the heart rate.", 
    "2": "We retrospectively examined the electrocardiograms in all of our patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and normal sinus rhythm before and after at least 3 months of metoprolol (n = 12), bucindolol (n = 8), carvedilol (n = 6), or no beta blocker (n = 9). Both beta1-selective and nonselective beta-adrenergic blockade reduced QTc dispersion equally in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.", 
    "3": "Currently d,l-sotalol is widely used to prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter, although a randomized dose-response study has not previously been conducted to guide therapy for this indication. This study summarizes findings of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized trial evaluating the efficacy, safety, and dose-response relation of 3 fixed doses of d,l-sotalol (80, 120, and 160 mg twice daily) for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in 253 patients with atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter. All patients were in sinus rhythm at randomization. Treatment (69 patients on placebo, 59 on 80 mg, 63 on 120 mg, and 62 on 160 mg given twice daily) was continued for 12 months or until documented recurrence of symptomatic atrial fibrillation and/or flutter. Transtelephonic electrocardiographic monitoring was used to detect symptomatic recurrences. Demographic characteristics were not different in the 4 groups. Structural heart disease was present in 57% of patients. Patients with a history of heart failure were excluded. The time from randomization to symptomatic arrhythmia recurrence was significantly longer in the 2 higher d,l-sotalol dose groups than in the placebo group. The median times to recurrence were 27, 106, 229, and 175 days for the placebo, 80, 120, and 160 mg groups, respectively. There were no deaths or cases of torsade de pointes, sustained ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation reported. Thus, d,l-sotalol appeared to be both safe and effective in maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation and/or flutter. Further, the 120-mg twice daily dose appeared to provide the most favorable benefit and/or risk.", 
    "4": "We have studied the effects of FR168888 (5-hydroxymethyl-3-(pyrrol-1-yl)benzoylguanidine methanesulfonate), a new Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor, on ischemia and reperfusion-induced arrhythmia and myocardial infarction in anesthetized rats and compared them with those of other cardioprotective compounds. FR168888 had a potent inhibitory effect on Na+/H+ exchange of rat lymphocytes acidified with Na+-propionate with a Ki value of 6.4 nM. Pretreatment with FR168888 (0.032-0.32 mg/kg, i.v.) reduced or completely abolished the ventricular fibrillation (VF) induced by reperfusion after 5 min of regional ischemia, while lidocaine, a class I antiarrhythmic agent, showed less effect against VF as compared with FR168888. The size of myocardial infarction induced by 60-min ischemia and 60-min reperfusion was attenuated by FR168888 dose-dependently (1.0-10 mg/kg, i.v.), and ventricular tachycardia and VF were significantly reduced during the ischemic period. In contrast, propranolol and diltiazem did not show such protective effects on myocardial infarct size. In addition, FR168888 did not change hemodynamic parameters in rats. These results indicate that FR168888 has a strong inhibitory effect on Na+/H+ exchange and that treatment with FR168888 can protect the heart from arrhythmia and myocardial cell death in ischemic and reperfused situations.", 
    "5": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is an increasing burden to health care. Pharmacological treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers improve survival and reduce hospitalizations in patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

It is not known if treatments are of benefit in this group.", 
    "6": "Candesartan in Heart Failure-Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity (CHARM) is a program designed to investigate the clinical usefulness of the long-acting angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, candesartan cilexetil, in a broad spectrum of patients with symptomatic heart failure. Patients with systolic dysfunction, tolerant or intolerant to an ACE-inhibitor, and patients with preserved systolic function are included. Specifically, the CHARM program consists of 3 independent, parallel, placebo-controlled studies in patients with (1) LVEF less than or equal to 40%, ACE-inhibitor treated (n = 2,300); (2) LVEF less than or equal to 40%, ACE-inhibitor intolerant (n = 1,700); (3) LVEF greater than 40%, not treated with ACE inhibitors (n = 2,500). The 3 studies will be combined to evaluate the effect of candesartan cilexetil on all-cause mortality in the broad spectrum of symptomatic heart failure. The primary objective in each trial is to evaluate the effects on the combined endpoint of cardiovascular mortality or CHF hospitalization. Other endpoints include the effects on myocardial infarction, all-cause hospitalization, and resource utilization. CHARM is intended to randomize 6,500 patients with symptomatic heart failure from 26 countries in Europe, the United States, Canada, South Africa, and Australia. The CHARM program started to enroll patients in March 1999. The follow-up period is a minimum of 2 years. The study is expected to end in the third quarter of 2002.", 
    "7": "A beta-adrenoceptor blocker and an anticholinergic agent are often prescribed concomitantly for the treatment of neuroleptic-induced akathisia. The aim of this study was to investigate possible pharmacokinetic interactions of neuroleptic haloperidol with the beta-blocker carteolol and the anticholinergic biperiden. In a 5-step, open-labeled, oral single-dose study, eight healthy male volunteers received 2 mg haloperidol, 10 mg carteolol hydrochloride, and 2 mg biperiden hydrochloride: first each drug alone, then a combination of haloperidol and carteolol, and then all three drugs concurrently. Serum concentrations of haloperidol, carteolol, and biperiden were determined up to 24 hr postdosing, and a safety evaluation was conducted throughout the study. Carteolol increased the area under the haloperidol serum concentration-time curve (AUC0-t) 1.4-fold (P = 0.0014) and decreased the serum clearance of haloperidol up to 67% (P = 0.0127). Biperiden reduced the serum haloperidol concentrations increased by the administration of carteolol. No significant changes of the serum pharmacokinetics of carteolol and biperiden were found as a result of any drug combinations. Adverse events of the central nervous system such as sleepiness and changes in pupil size were observed, but all were mild with clinical insignificance.", 
    "8": "Restriction of physical activities (which does not exclude participation in tailored rehabilitation programmes), limitation of water and sodium intake, diuretics and digitalis (at least in the presence of atrial fibrillation) have long been used in the therapy of symptomatic congestive heart failure. Nowadays, the value of inhibiting the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone response to cardiac output lowering is well established; ideally, this requires concomitant administration of an ACE-inhibitor, a beta-blocker and spironolactone. All treatable causes of myocardial dysfunction should be adequately corrected (including chronic myocardial ischemia). When needed, patients should also be protected against lethal ventricular arrhythmias, and thrombo-embolic complications.", 
    "9": "MERIT-HF study was a multicenter, double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study which enrolled 3.991 class II-IV heart failure patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40% who were already treated by optimal standard therapy (diuretic + ACE inhibitor or equivalent). Three thousand nine hundred ninety one patients were enrolled in the study: 2.001 received a placebo; 1.990 were assigned to metoprolol administration at the initial dose of 25 mg/day (12.5 mg for class III-IV patients) and progressively increased to a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. The study was prematurely stopped because, after an observation period of 3.980 patients x years, it demonstrated a significant mortality reduction in the treated group. All cause mortality was reduced by 34% (7.2% per patient x year vs 11%). Sudden death mortality and mortality due to progression of heart failure were reduced by 41% and 49%, respectively.", 
    "10": "We examined the influence of animal age on the functional response of guinea-pig (0-156 weeks) and rat (4-136 weeks) isolated tracheal tissue to beta-adrenoceptor agonists. In addition, the binding density and affinity of [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) binding to tracheal tissue was examined with respect to animal age. Significant age-related changes in isoprenaline potency were observed in tracheal ring preparations taken from animals during the early maturation phase of animal growth in the guinea-pig and rat. In addition, in rat isolated tracheal tissue, age-related decreases in fenoterol potency were observed during senescence, but not maturation. The changes in the functional responsiveness of tracheal tissue were not reflected by changes in the binding density or affinity for [125I]cyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) of beta-adrenoceptors, or in changes in specific autoradiographic grain density over smooth muscle tissue. In both guinea-pig and rat, no significant age-related changes in the influence of catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) or of extraneuronal uptake inhibition were detected. This study has demonstrated significant age-related changes in the responsiveness of guinea-pig and rat isolated tracheal tissue to beta-adrenoceptor agonists that were not related to changes in the density or affinity of the beta-adrenoceptor population or in the activity of COMT or extraneuronal uptake. The possibility of age-related changes in receptor-signal transduction coupling should be explored.", 
    "11": "Hypertension is a heterogeneous disease and this is reflected in the marked variability in response to monotherapy. Co-administering antihypertensive therapies has several theoretical benefits, namely enhanced efficacy, improved tolerability, increased compliance and, in some cases, potentially beneficial changes in biochemical variables associated with increased cardiovascular risk, such as improvements in lipid profiles. alpha 1-Blockers, such as doxazosin, have several favourable properties which should be advantageous when used with other agents. Their mechanism of action is complementary to that of each of the other four main groups of antihypertensive drugs and, in each case, enhanced efficacy has been observed when alpha 1-blockade has been added to monotherapy with other drug classes. Synergistic effects have been seen when an alpha 1-blocker is administered together with either a calcium channel blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. While alpha 1-blockers induce regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, the possibility of enhanced effects during multiple therapy has not been explored. alpha 1-Blockers exert positive effects on lipids (limited data suggest that they are able to reverse the deleterious lipid effects of diuretics and beta-blockers) and exert neutral or positive effects on glucose homeostasis. Further studies are needed to determine whether alpha 1-blockers can alleviate the adverse effects of beta-blockers or diuretics on glucose homeostasis. alpha 1-Blockers, when given concomitantly with other antihypertensive drugs, are well tolerated, conferring advantages with respect to patient compliance. The current data favour the use of alpha 1-blockers as an additional component of antihypertensive therapy, but further studies are needed to address the metabolic and end-organ effects of such treatment regimens.", 
    "12": "The efficacy of 0.5% timolol was compared with that of the prostaglandin derivative unoprostone in maintaining control of intraocular pressure (IOP) in subjects with chronic open angle glaucoma (COAG) or ocular hypertension (OH) already responding satisfactorily to beta-blocker monotherapy. In a two-centre, double-masked, randomised parallel group study, 40 subjects were placed on 0.5% timolol eyedrops twice daily for two weeks. They were then randomised either to continue with 0.5% timolol or to switch to 0.12% unoprostone, applied twice daily for six weeks. IOP was measured at two-weekly intervals. The status of the conjunctiva, iris, cornea and anterior chamber was kept under observation. Ocular safety was monitored by measurements of visual acuity, and any systemic adverse events were recorded. After six weeks' treatment, there were no statistically significant differences in mean change from baseline IOP within or between treatment groups. For the subjects treated with unoprostone, mean IOP increased by 0.69 mm Hg (p = 0.368) while that of the timolol-treated subjects fell by 0.47 mm Hg (p = 0.287). The difference in mean IOP between groups was 1.16 mm Hg (p = 0.211, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.69 to 3.02). The most common complaint was a mild and transient burning sensation on instillation which occurred more frequently in the unoprostone group. In conclusion, an aqueous solution of 0.12% unoprostone isopropyl, applied topically to the eye twice daily for six weeks, was as effective as 0.5% timolol in maintaining control of IOP in subjects with chronic open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Both treatments were safe and well tolerated.", 
    "13": "The objective of these studies was to clarify the role of Ca(2+) in the mechanism of death evoked by human amylin (hA) in islet beta-cells. hA forms fibrils in vitro and islet amyloid in vivo. Here we show that pure synthetic hA aggregated in solution, formed fibrils and evoked death in cultured RINm5F islet beta-cells in a time-dependent (0-24 h) and concentration-dependent (0-20 microM) manner. Dying cells underwent shrinkage of the nucleus, with clumping and segregation of chromatin into masses that lay against the nuclear envelope, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. These cells therefore show many features of apoptosis, although aspects of the morphology might be characteristic of this particular cell type rather than of a general apoptotic nature. Aurintricarboxylic acid, an inhibitor of both Ca(2+)-dependent and Ca(2+)-independent nucleases, suppressed this DNA fragmentation and inhibited apoptosis at concentrations between 25 and 200 microM. Direct measurements of the cytoplasmic free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (AM)-loaded beta-cells showed that neither hA nor its non-cytotoxic homologue, rat amylin were effective in raising [Ca(2+)](i). Modulators of Ca(2+) regulation were tested for their effects on hA-induced beta-cell apoptosis. Ca(2+) ionophore (A23187) and thapsigargin (an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticular Ca(2+)-ATPase activity) by themselves evoked apoptosis accompanied by increased [Ca(2+)](i). Neither the Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil, the extracellular Ca(2+) chelator EGTA nor the cytosolic Ca(2+) buffer bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid ('BAPTA')/AM protected beta-cells from hA-evoked apoptosis. Prolonged incubation of beta-cells with a lethal dose of hA altered neither the basal [Ca(2+)](i) nor the thapsigargin-induced release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. Furthermore, (45)CaCl(2) uptake by RINm5F cells did not differ in the presence or absence of hA. These results suggest that, whereas alterations in cytosolic Ca(2+) homoeostasis do have a significant role in certain forms of beta-cell death, they do not contribute to the pathway of apoptosis evoked by hA in islet beta-cells.", 
    "14": "Extracellular application of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) elevated intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The maximal response to LPA occurred between 0. 1 and 1 microM, at which point [Ca(2+)](i) was increased by approx. 500 nM. This increase was of similar magnitude to that caused by the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist methacholine (MCh), although the initial rate of release by LPA was slower. Both LPA and MCh released Ca(2+) from intracellular stores, as assessed by inhibition of their effects by thapsigargin, a blocker of endoplasmic reticular Ca(2+) uptake, and by the persistence of their action in nominally Ca(2+)-free extracellular medium. Similarly, both agonists appeared to stimulate store-refilling Ca(2+) entry. MCh produced a marked elevation in cellular Ins(1,4,5)P(3) and stimulated [(3)H]InsP accumulation in the presence of Li(+). In contrast, LPA failed to stimulate detectable phosphoinositide turnover. Chronic down-regulation of Ins(1,4,5)P(3) receptor (InsP(3)R) proteins with MCh did not affect Ca(2+) responses to LPA. In addition, heparin, a competitive antagonist of InsP(3)Rs, blocked Ca(2+)-mobilization in permeabilized SH-SY5Y cells in response to MCh or exogenously added Ins(1,4,5)P(3), but failed to inhibit Ca(2+)-release induced by LPA. Elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) elicited by LPA was blocked by guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]-diphosphate, indicating that this agonist acts via a G-protein-coupled receptor. However, pertussis toxin was without effect on LPA-evoked [Ca(2+)](i) responses, suggesting that G(i/o)-proteins were not involved. In the absence of extracellular Ca(2+), N,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS, 30 microM), a competitive inhibitor of sphingosine kinase, blocked LPA-induced Ca(2+) responses by almost 90%. In addition, MCh-induced Ca(2+) responses were also diminished by the addition of DMS, although to a lesser extent than with LPA. We conclude that LPA mobilizes intracellular Ca(2+)-stores in SH-SY5Y cells independently of the generation and action of Ins(1,4,5)P(3). Furthermore, the Ca(2+)-response to LPA appears to be dependent on sphingosine kinase activation and the potential generation of the putative second messenger sphingosine 1-phosphate.", 
    "15": "The effect of betaxolol on the specific binding of [3H]diltiazem and [3H]nitrendipine to rat cortical membranes was examined. Betaxolol inhibited specific [3H]diltiazem and [3H]nitrendipine binding with IC50 values of 19.7 and 46.3 microM, respectively. The effect of betaxolol on L-type Ca2+ channels showed little stereospecificity, since similar inhibitions of radioligand binding were observed with both racemic betaxolol and L-betaxolol. The dissociation kinetics of [3H]diltiazem were unaffected by 30 microM betaxolol, whereas it increased the [3H]nitrendipine dissociation rate, thus suggesting that betaxolol directly interacts with the benzothiazepine binding site and allosterically modulates the dihydropyridine binding site. Carteolol, propranolol and timolol were also found to inhibit both specific [3H]diltiazem and [3H]nitrendipine binding to rat cortical membranes, but with less potency than betaxolol. The ability of betaxolol to interact with L-type Ca2+ channels may have a role in its therapeutic effects in the management of systemic hypertension and in reducing neuronal death as occurring in glaucoma.", 
    "16": "Characterization of adrenergic stimuli on luteinizing hormone (LH) release induced by ovarian steroids in short-term ovariectomized (OVX) rats was studied. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were OVX about 1000 h on the diestrous day 1. After ovariectomy, rats were immediately inserted estradiol-containing Silastic capsules s.c. and implanted atrial Silastic tubing for frequent blood samplings. All the rats received 2 mg of progesterone s.c. at 0930 h the next morning. At 1200 h, the rats received additional treatments: a saline vehicle, prazosin HC1 (an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist), yohimbine HC1 (an alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist), or propranolol HC1 (a beta-adrenergic antagonist) s.c., respectively. Two different doses of individual adrenergic antagonists were used on an equimolar basis in order to show their effectiveness on steroids-induced LH secretion. Blood samples were collected before and 1, 3, and 5 hours after the treatments through indwelt tubings. LH surge induced by ovarian steroids was suppressed/delayed by prazosin and yohimbine, but potentiated by propranolol in a dose-dependent manner. Results suggested that the hypothalamic alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-adrenoreceptors were involved in the control of LH surge in the short-term OVX-steroids-primed rats. Principally, the alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoreceptors played a facilitatory role, and the beta-adrenoreceptors played an inhibitory role in the regulation of LH surge induced by ovarian steroids.", 
    "17": "Background-In long-QT syndrome (LQTS), heterozygosity for a mutation in 1 of the K(+) channel genes leads to prolongation of the cardiac action potential, because the aberrant protein exhibits \"loss of function.\" HERG, which is involved in LQT2, is the gene encoding the rapid component of the delayed rectifier, I(Kr). Methods and Results-In a consanguineous family, a stillbirth was followed by the premature birth of a child in distress due to ventricular arrhythmia in the presence of QT prolongation. LQTS was diagnosed, beta-blocker therapy was begun, and a pacemaker was implanted. She developed well and remained symptom-free for 1.5 years. In the index patient, we identified a duplication of bp 558 to 600 in exon 4 of HERG on both alleles. This will result in a frameshift and a premature stop codon before the S1 domain of the HERG protein. Because it is present on both alleles, no functional I(Kr) is anticipated. The same mutation was found heterozygously in both parents and homozygously in the stillborn brother. Conclusions-It is concluded that absence of I(Kr) gives rise to a severe cardiac phenotype, with no indication of malfunction of any other organ.", 
    "18": "Clinical studies have shown that pindolol can enhance the effects of antidepressant drugs, presumably by acting as an antagonist at somatodendritic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A) autoreceptors, which regulate the firing rate of central serotonergic neurons. The current study characterized the action of pindolol on the single-unit activity of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus of freely moving cats. (+/-)-Pindolol produced a dose-dependent inhibition of neuronal activity after i.v. (ED(50) = 0.25 mg/kg) and s.c. (ED(50) = 1.23 mg/kg) administration. The active enantiomer (-)-pindolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) also suppressed neuronal activity (maximal decrease, 88%). Upon p.o. administration, (+/-)-pindolol (10 mg/kg) produced a marked, long-acting suppression of neuronal activity similar to that observed after s.c. administration. In all cases, the reduction in firing rate produced by pindolol was completely reversed by low doses of N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]-ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cycloh exanecarboxamide (WAY-100635) (0.1 mg/kg i.v. or 0.2 mg/kg s.c.), a selective 5-HT(1A) antagonist. Systemic administration of (-)-tertatolol (1-5 mg/kg i.v.), another beta-adrenoceptor blocker/putative 5-HT(1A) antagonist, had no significant effect on neuronal activity. The ability of i.v. (+/-)-pindolol (0.1-1 mg/kg) to reverse the suppression of serotonergic neuronal activity produced by 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (10 microg/kg i.v.), a selective 5-HT(1A) agonist, also was examined. (+/-)-Pindolol had no appreciable effect on the action of 8-OH-DPAT. In contrast, the 5-HT(1A) antagonist drugs WAY-100635 (0.1 mg/kg i.v. ), 4-fluoro-N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinyl benzamide (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.), N-tert-butyl-3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-phenylprop anamid e [(S)-WAY-100135] (0.5 mg/kg i.v.), and (-)-tertatolol (1-5 mg/kg i. v.) reversed the effect of 8-OH-DPAT to varying degrees. Overall, these results indicate that pindolol acts as an agonist rather than an antagonist at 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors in awake animals.", 
    "19": "The ability of pindolol to enhance the clinical antidepressant response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is generally attributed to a blockade of the feedback inhibition of serotonergic neuronal activity mediated by somatodendritic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A) autoreceptors. The current study examined the ability of pindolol to restore the single-unit activity of serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus neurons in awake cats after acute treatment with the SSRI fluoxetine. The effects of pindolol were compared with those of N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohe xanecarboxamide (WAY-100635), a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist. Systemic administration of fluoxetine (0.5 and 5 mg/kg i. v.) decreased neuronal firing rates to approximately 50 and 1%, respectively, of baseline levels. The subsequent administration of cumulative doses of (+/-)-pindolol (0.1-5 mg/kg i.v.) failed to reverse the neuronal inhibition produced by either dose of fluoxetine. In addition to lacking efficacy as an antagonist in these experiments, (+/-)-pindolol produced an additional decrease in neuronal activity in animals pretreated with the low dose of fluoxetine. The active enantiomer, (-)-pindolol (1 mg/kg i.v.), also was ineffective in restoring neuronal activity after fluoxetine. In contrast, systemic administration of WAY-100635 completely reversed the effect of fluoxetine (5 mg/kg) at low doses (0.025 mg/kg i.v.), and further elevated the firing rate of these neurons above prefluoxetine baseline levels. Overall, these results indicate that pindolol, unlike WAY-100635, lacks appreciable antagonist activity at 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors. Thus, the clinical efficacy of pindolol in augmenting the antidepressant response to SSRIs, such as fluoxetine, may be unrelated to a restoration of serotonergic neuronal activity.",

Patients had echocardiography, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and Holter monitoring. Hypotension induced ischaemic (HII) events were defined as episodes of ST segment ischaemia occurring at least one minute after an ambulatory blood pressure measurement (systolic/diastolic) below 100/65 mm Hg during the day, or 90/50 mm Hg at night.", 
    "31": "25 suitable patients were enrolled, and 107 hypotensive events were documented. 40 ST events occurred in 14 patients, of which a quarter were symptomatic. Fourteen HII events occurred in eight patients, with 13 of the 14 preceded by a fall in diastolic pressure (median diastolic pressure 57.5 mm Hg, interquartile range 11, maximum 72 mm Hg, minimum 45 mm Hg), and six preceded by a fall in systolic pressure (chi(2) = 11.9, p < 0.001). ST events were significantly associated with preceding hypotensive events (chi(2) = 40.2, p < 0.0001). Patients with HII events were more frequently taking multiple hypotensive drug regimens (8/8 v 9/17, chi(2) = 5.54, p = 0.022).", 
    "32": "In patients with ischaemic heart disease and hypotension, symptomatic and silent ischaemia occurred in a temporally causal relation with hypotension, particularly for diastolic pressures, suggesting that patients with coronary disease may be susceptible to ischaemic events incurred as a result of low blood pressure caused by excessive hypotensive drug treatment.", 
    "33": "The importance of the adrenergic nervous system in supporting the failing heart has long been known. The adrenergic drive on cardiac structure and function has however some adverse effects, which include myocardial beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) downregulation and decreased beta-adrenergic responsiveness to cathecolamines. In dog lymphocytes, beta(1)-AR and beta(2)-AR populations are almost equally represented (with a slight prevalence of beta(2)) and a significant correlation between cardiac and lymphocytic adrenoceptors has been found. The aim of the present study was to investigate possible differences between the concentration of lymphocytic beta-AR in healthy dogs, dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and dogs with occult DCM. Three groups of great danes were considered: a control group (n =10), dogs with DCM (n =9) and dogs with occult DCM (n =4). Lymphocytic beta-AR populations were determined in all dogs. A substantial and significant decrease (P<0.05) in total-AR, beta(1)-AR and beta(2)-AR concentrations in the lymphocytes of dogs with symptomatic DCM and occult DCM compared to the control group was found. Although the mean value of the lymphocyte beta(1)-AR number in the asymptomatic group was double compared to the DCM group, this difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that in dogs beta-AR downregulation occurs early in the course of dilated cardiomyopathy. This finding may suggest the value of early use of a beta-blocker in the therapeutic regimen. Moreover, the continuous monitoring of lymphocytic beta-AR may represent a useful tool for the development of a more effective individual therapy.", 
    "34": "Serum catecholamine levels and myocardial and lymphocyte adrenergic receptor (AR) concentrations were measured in adult great danes affected by canine dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and compared to those of healthy animals. A non-homogeneous population of beta -AR, consisting of beta(1)-AR and beta(2)-AR, was observed in healthy (41 and 59%, respectively) and affected (17 and 83%, respectively) dog lymphocytes. Binding assays revealed that total beta -AR, beta(1)-AR and alpha(1)-AR were significantly downregulated (P<0.05;P<0.01;P<0. 001), both in lymphocyte and myocardial cell membranes of affected dogs. beta(2)-Adrenergic receptor concentrations were significantly reduced only in lymphocyte and right atrium cell membranes (P<0.05). Downregulation was not associated with alterations in receptor binding characteristics, as no significant differences in K(d)values were found. Mean plasma catecholamine levels were significantly higher (P<0.01) in DCM dogs (939+/-41) than in normal subjects (348+/-32), thus suggesting a sympathetic activation. The present study indicates a condition similar to that observed in human patients affected by DCM and that adrenergic receptors in canine lymphocytes reflect the fluctuation of adrenergic receptor concentrations in the myocardium.",

    "36": "Laser-Doppler flowmetry allowed for the characterization of medullary blood flow (MBF) over a wide range of renal arterial pressure (RAP), and was used for comparison among treatment groups. Renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure (RIHP) was also determined over a wide range of RAP.", 
    "37": "Enalapril or losartan was given to male 12-13-week-old SHR for 3 days (25 mg/kg per day in drinking water). Rats were anesthetized with Inactin, renal function was measured at resting levels of RAP and then RAP was varied over a range of 50-150 mmHg in 25 mmHg steps. MBF and RIHP were determined at each pressure.", 
    "38": "Resting mean arterial pressure (MAP) (mmHg +/- SE) for enalapril- and for losartan-treated SHR [114 +/- 3 (n = 18) and 124 +/- 3 (n = 20), respectively] were both significantly lower than for untreated SHR [159 +/- 5 (n = 20)]. Renal function at resting levels of MAP was not significantly different among groups. Enalapril and losartan both increased MBF by 30% at levels of RAP of 125 mmHg and over. Enalapril did not alter the relation between RAP and RIHP, but losartan shifted the RAP versus RIHP curve by approximately 40 mmHg to lower levels of RAP. Acute administration of the B2 kinin receptor antagonist HOE 140 [20 microg/kg intravenous (i.v.) bolus, then 10 microg/kg per h i.v.] did not significantly alter MAP in any group. HOE 140 did not significantly alter MBF or RIHP in the untreated or losartan-treated SHR. MBF in enalapril-treated rats receiving HOE 140 was not significantly different from that of the enalapril-only group; however, the relation between RAP and RIHP was shifted to lower levels of RAP by approximately 45 mmHg.", 
    "39": "Both enalapril and losartan increase MBF in SHR, suggesting that the medullary circulation of SHR is influenced by endogenous levels of angiotensin II. The failure of enalapril to increase RIHP in parallel with MBF appears to be due to an enhanced effect of kinins.", 
    "40": "The presence of bradykinin B2 receptors in the cardiovascular regulatory centres of the brain indicates that increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of bradykinin is mediated via stimulation of sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "41": "Adult Wistar- Kyoto (WKY) rats were instrumented chronically with an i.c.v. cannula, and the catheters were placed into the femoral artery and vein. Increasing doses of bradykinin (1 -300 pmol) were given i.c.v. and (i) MAP and heart rate, (ii) plasma dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline, and (iii) plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels were determined. In addition, following blockade of peripheral alpha1 -adrenoceptors with prazosin (50 and 250 microg/kg i.v.) beta1-adrenoceptors with atenolol (10 mg/kg i.v.) or V1 -receptors with TMe-AVP (Manning compound) (10 microg/kg i.c.v. and 100 microg/kg i.v.) the effects of bradykinin (100 pmol i.c.v.) on MAP and heart rate were determined.", 
    "42": "Bradykinin increased MAP and heart rate dose-dependently. The pressor effects of 100 pmol bradykinin i.c.v. were completely blocked by pretreatment with the specific B2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (3 pmol, i.c.v.). There was no change in plasma dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline or AVP levels after increasing doses of bradykinin. However, peripheral blockade of alpha1- and beta1-adrenoceptors reduced the bradykinin-induced increase in MAP and heart rate, whereas central and peripheral V1 receptor blockade did not alter the cardiovascular responses to i.c.v. bradykinin.",

    "44": "Hypertensive subjects have increased cardiovascular risk factors including dyslipidemia and increased rates of diabetes and hypertension. Insulin resistance is increased in hypertensive subjects, especially lean subjects. Increased insulin resistance in hypertensive subjects may partially mediate the more atherogenic pattern of cardiovascular risk factors in diabetic subjects. Hypertensive subjects are also at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes possibly by increasing insulin resistance. Hypertensive subjects at particularly high risk of developing type 2 diabetes (i.e. obese or with a family history of type 2 diabetes) should avoid beta-blockers and thiazides.", 
    "45": "The duration of the stimulating effect of transplacental transferred thyrotropin-receptor-antibodies (TRAb) is discussed by the example of a 23 years old woman suffering from Graves' disease with a severe hyperthyroidism. She became pregnant six weeks after the diagnosis was obtained and then discontinued her antithyroid medication on her own responsibility. On a check-up in the 20th week of pregnancy, a hyperthyroidism was once more found, leading to a therapy with propylthiouracil, which however, was again interrupted by the patient a few weeks later. In the 32nd week, she gave birth to a male child that already presented with distinct signs of thyrotoxicosis and developed a continuous deterioration of the condition, including a tachycardia with up to 190 beats per minute, fever, tremor and a respiratory disorder. Assay of the newborn serum revealed a severe hyperthyroidism. The TRAb level was 180 U/l (normal range < 15). A therapy with propranolol and prednisolone was initiated, leading to a significant improvement of the general condition. Nevertheless, after 12 days, there was still no notable decrease of the hormone levels. Therefore an antithyroid medication was started, which caused normal thyroid hormone levels within 9 days. However, after the therapy was stopped, a hyperthyroidism was again observed within one week, requiring another, low-dose antithyroid medication, which was administered for 26 days. After this period, the TRAb level was down to 25 U/l and no more hyperthyroidism was found. The biological half-life of the TRAb was 20 days in our case.", 
    "46": "Prostaglandins are known to play a key role in the initiation of labor in humans, but the mechanisms governing their synthesis in amnion are largely unknown. In this study, we have examined the regulatory pathways for prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production during protein kinase C-dependent activation of human WISH cells. In these cells, PGE(2) synthesis appears to be limited not by free arachidonic acid availability but by the expression levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Concomitant with the cells being able to synthesize and secrete PGE(2), we detected significant elevations of both COX-2 protein and mRNA levels. Specific inhibition of COX-2 by NS-398 totally ablated PGE(2) synthesis. All of these responses were found to be strikingly dependent on an active phosphatidate phosphohydrolase 1 (PAP-1). Inhibition of PAP-1 activity by three different strategies (i.e. use of bromoenol lactone, propranolol, and ethanol) resulted in inhibition of COX-2 expression and hence of PGE(2) production. These data unveil a novel signaling mechanism for the regulation of PGE(2) production via regulation of COX-2 expression and implicate phosphatidate phosphohydrolase 1 as a key regulatory component of eicosanoid metabolic pathways in the amnion.", 
    "47": "Transgenic (TG) mice with cardiac G(salpha) overexpression exhibit enhanced inotropic and chronotropic responses to sympathetic stimulation, but develop cardiomyopathy with age. We tested the hypothesis that cardiomyopathy in TG mice with G(salpha) overexpression could be averted with chronic beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) blockade. TG mice and age-matched wild-type littermates were treated with the beta-AR blocker propranolol for 6-7 months, starting at a time when the cardiomyopathy was developing but was not yet severe enough to induce significant cardiac depression (9.5 months of age), and ending at a time when cardiac depression and cardiomyopathy would have been clearly manifest (16 months of age). Propranolol treatment, which can induce cardiac depression in the normal heart, actually prevented cardiac dilation and the depressed left ventricular function characteristic of older TG mice, and abolished premature mortality. Propranolol also prevented the increase in myocyte cross-sectional area and myocardial fibrosis. Myocyte apoptosis, already apparent in 9-month-old TG mice, was actually eliminated by chronic propranolol. This study indicates that chronic sympathetic stimulation over an extended period is deleterious and results in cardiomyopathy. Conversely, beta-AR blockade is salutary in this situation and can prevent the development of cardiomyopathy.", 
    "48": "An AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan, has been reported to improve survival and quality of life in patients with congestive heart failure as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors do. Since many of the patients are normotensive, it may be a drawback if the compound decreases normal blood pressure. In this study, we investigated whether a novel AT1 receptor antagonist, TA-606, which is more potent than losartan, affects normal blood pressure and its regulatory system in comparison with losartan. TA-606 (30 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) did not change normal blood pressure, whereas losartan (100 mg/kg, p.o.) tended to decrease it. Although EXP3174 (1 and 10 mg/kg, i.v.), an active metabolite of losartan, suppressed the baroreceptor-heart rate (HR) reflex, 606A (1 and 10 mg/kg, i.v.), an active metabolite of TA-606, did not affect it. Since losartan is known to affect the L-glutamate receptor which is part of the central blood pressure regulatory system, we also investigated whether 606A affects L-glutamate receptor binding. We found that 606A did not affect the binding of the L-glutamate receptor, but EXP3174 inhibited the binding with IC50 values of 13.3 microM. These findings suggest that, even having the same AT1 receptor antagonist properties as losartan and EXP3174, TA-606 and its active metabolite do not influence normal blood pressure or its regulatory system.", 
    "49": "To identify factors that influence changes in the activities of daily living (ADL) assessed by a standardized scoring system, ADL-20, and factors affecting the self-estimate of the changes in ADL, we conducted a 1-yr follow-up study of 1,163 outpatients aged 50 yr or older. The follow-up rate was 83.1%. A decrease in the ADL score was associated with advancing age and a lower prescription rate of beta-blockers. Analysis of the modalities of ADL revealed an association between a decreasing mobility score and a lower prescription rate of beta-blockers. In patients with impaired ADL at the time of enrollment, worsening of the ADL score was also associated with a lower baseline ADL score and a history of cardiovascular events. The prescription rate of diuretics was lower in patients who exhibited an improvement in ADL score. There was a considerable dissociation between the self-estimate of changes in ADL and the actual change in ADL-20 score. In more than 60% of patients with impaired baseline ADL, the self-estimate of changes was worse than the actual change in the ADL score. The \"worse-than-actual\" self-estimate of changes in ADL was associated with a higher prescription rate of beta-blockers. Thus, a history of cardiovascular events accelerates the aging-related deterioration of ADL. The use of a beta-blocker may worsen the self-estimate of the changes in ADL, while the actual ADL is preserved or slightly improved during beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "50": "The effects of a combined therapy with a calcium channel antagonist and alphabeta-blocker in patients with accelerated-malignant hypertension on blood pressure and renal function were examined. Thirteen patients presented with the clinical features of malignant hypertension (diastolic blood pressure >130 mmHg, retinal damage and progressive renal failure) at our hospital, over the 3 yr period from 1995 to 1997. These patients were treated with both a calcium antagonist, 60-80 mg/d dose of long acting nifedipine, and an alphabeta-blocker, 20 mg/d dose of arotinolol, for over 12 mo. At admission, the average blood pressure of the patients was 233+/-8/144+/-3 mmHg. The level of serum creatinine in these patients was 6.2+/-1.0 mg/dl. Intermittent hemodialysis therapy was introduced in 7 patients. Three days after treatment, blood pressure decreased to 162+/-4/102+/-4 mmHg. A month later, blood pressure decreased to 148+/-3/89+/-2 mmHg and serum creatinine levels were 3.6+/-0.4 mg/dl. Renal function in these patients improved, and they completely recovered from renal dysfunction, allowing withdrawal of haemodialysis therapy. One year later, the blood pressure in all of these patients was well controlled and no further renal deterioration was observed, except in one patient. Despite the reduction in blood pressure, one patient was on hemodialysis three times a week after 8 mo of treatment. From these finding, it is concluded that combination therapy with a calcium antagonist and alphabeta-blocker is effective in both the reduction of highly elevated blood pressure and protection of the kidneys, resulting in amelioration of accelerated-malignant hypertension.", 
    "51": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic, disabling anxiety disorder that is characterized by recurrent obsessions and uncontrolled compulsions such as repetitive behavioral or mental acts that are performed in response to an obsession. OCD often occurs comorbidly with a number of depressive and anxiety disorders. In addition, patients with OCD suffer significant personal and social morbidity and may have difficulty maintaining a job, finishing school, and developing relationships. The backbone of pharmacologic treatment for OCD is a 10- to 12-week trial with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in adequate doses. In most cases, treatment should be initiated with an SSRI because of the superior safety, tolerability, and equivalent efficacy of this class of drugs compared with clomipramine. When dealing with patients who do not respond to one SSRI, effective alternatives include switching to a different SSRI, combining another medication or behavioral therapy with SSRI therapy, considering novel or experimental drug treatments, or employing nonpharmacologic biological approaches, such as electroconvulsive therapy, neurosurgery, or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. This article provides an update on the diagnosis and medical management of OCD and will discuss guidelines for the use of SSRIs and novel approaches for managing treatment-refractory patients.", 
    "52": "Effects of acetylcholine, noradrenaline, atropine and propranolol on cell number in connective tissue regenerates of the skin in wound healing were studied in white rats. Noradrenaline causes the decrease of inflammatory reaction, fibroblast content in regenerate and basophilia of their cytoplasm. Acetylcholine conversely increases cell reaction, but slows down the re-modelling of connective tissue regenerate. The definite dynamic balance between catecholamine and acetylcholine systems of reparation processes regulation in wound healing is noted. This balance could deviate under external influences. The expression of various cellular element reaction to the dermal regenerate on adreno- and cholinotropic influences tends to change during wound healing.", 
    "53": "Self-associating supramolecular organisation of molecules above critical micellar concentrations (c.m.c.) offers enormous potentials in figuring distinguished behaviour both within formulations as well as in the bioenvironment. The present study deals with the enhancement of the oral bioavailability of propranolol HCl by synthesising the amphiphathic prodrug, which tends to aggregate in supramolecular orientations. The palmitoyl derivative of propranolol HCl was prepared by esterification of the secondary OH group. The prepared palmitoyl propranolol HCl (PPH) was characterised for its structure by IR and NMR spectroscopy as well as its physicochemical properties, hydrolysis profile and interfacial behaviour. The degree of hydrolysis as well as the aminolysis of aggregated and molecular PPH was monitored as a function of varying pH. The aminolysis could be effectively ablated in the case of the aggregated form of PPH. The in vivo bioavailability was determined by calculating the area under the curve in the blood plasma profile after oral administration of PPH in the form of a liquid crystalline dispersion and molecular dispersion. The possible mechanism operating for the enhancement of oral bioavailability was established as lymphatic transportation.", 
    "54": "Clinical studies have implicated surgery in promoting infections and compromising immune functions, including natural killer cell activity. Animal studies indicate that surgery-induced suppression of natural killer cell activity also promotes tumor metastasis. Hypothermia, a common surgical complication, has been suggested to underlie some of the deleterious consequences of surgery. This study evaluated the effect of hypothermia on the activity and number of blood natural killer cells and on host susceptibility to metastasis. The involvement of adrenergic mechanisms was also considered.", 
    "55": "Fischer-344 rats remained awake in their cages (control group) or were anesthetized with 70 mg/kg thiopental and maintained for 2.5 h at core body temperatures of 30-32 degrees C (hypothermia group) or 38 degrees C (normothermia group). Thereafter, at several time points, blood was drawn so natural killer cell activity could be assessed, or rats were injected with syngeneic MADB106 tumor cells that metastasize only to the lungs. Lungs were removed 9 h later for assessment of lung tumor retention, or 4 weeks later for counting of metastases.", 
    "56": "Normothermic anesthesia reduced natural killer cell activity (lytic units at 30% specific killing, mean +/- SEM) to 39+/-6.2% of control levels and hypothermia further reduced it to 15+/-6.6%. These changes were not accompanied by alterations in the numbers of circulating natural killer cells. Hypothermia increased tumor retention to 250% of control levels, and the number of metastases increased from 1.1+/-0.4 to 4.7+/-1.2. Normothermia had no significant effects on this index. Nadolol (0.4 mg/kg), a beta-adrenergic antagonist, significantly attenuated the effect of hypothermia on tumor retention.", 
    "57": "Hypothermia under thiopental anesthesia suppresses natural killer cell activity and compromises host resistance to metastatic formation, possibly via adrenergic mechanisms. Such suppression may place patients with metastasizing tumors or dormant viral infections at greater risk for complications after intraoperative hypothermia.", 
    "58": "Antihypertensive drugs are commonly prescribed for the treatment of patients with both diabetes and hypertension. However, the role of selected agents in the development of hypoglycemia remains controversial. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of antihypertensive agents on the risk of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients receiving insulin or sulfonylurea therapy. A matched case-control study was conducted using Pennsylvania Medicaid data. Five control subjects, matched for sex and age, with no reported medical condition of hypoglycemia, were randomly selected for each case patient admitted for hypoglycemia in 1993, resulting in a total of 404 cases and 1375 controls. With these sample sizes, we were able to detect a difference of 10% (P < 0.05) for our primary outcome measure, hospitalization for hypoglycemia. The relative risk of hypoglycemia was estimated using an unconditional logistic regression. The risk of hypoglycemia was 5.5 times greater (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0 to 7.6) in insulin versus sulfonylurea users and was not influenced by use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors overall. However, use of the ACE inhibitor enalapril was associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia (odds ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 5.3) in sulfonylurea users, suggesting that analyzing the unintended side effects of a class of drugs can sometimes mask the adverse effects of individual drugs. Use of beta-blockers was not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia, providing further empiric evidence that beta-blockers are an appropriate treatment for persons with concomitant diabetes and hypertension. Per capita health care costs were approximately 3 times higher in patients hospitalized for hypoglycemia compared with controls (P < 0.05). Hospitalization for hypoglycemia is expensive and may be prevented with appropriate monitoring of diabetic patients taking selected antihypertensive agents such as enalapril.", 
    "59": "This study investigated the effect of a beta blocker on parturition, fetal membrane retention and subsequent fertility in mares. The animals were divided into an experimental group (150 mares treated during second stage labour with propranolol [50 mg i.v.]) and a control group (180 mares with no treatment). Administration of propranolol was associated with a significant decrease in time of expulsion of fetal membranes, and an increase in both exhibition of foal heat and pregnancy rates at this heat.", 
    "60": "We analysed the sensitivity to beta-adrenoceptor agonists in epididymal adipose cells from rats submitted to a stress protocol previously reported to induce alterations in sensitivity to catecholamines in cardiac tissue from rats. Food intake and body weight were lower, whereas adipocytes basal lipolysis was higher (control: 0.59 +/- 0.04; stress: 1.00 +/- 0.11, micromol glycerol/100 mg total lipids/100 min) in stressed compared to control rats. The responses to isoprenaline (pD(2) control: 7.46 +/- 0.11; stress: 8.11 +/- 0.17), adrenaline (pD(2) control: 5.78 +/- 0. 20; stress: 6.13 +/- 0.18), and salbutamol (pD(2) control: 5.64 +/- 0.28; stress: 5.92 +/- 0.34) were sensitized, and the lipolytic responses to norepinephrine (pD(2) control: 6.98 +/- 0.13; stress: 6. 41 +/- 0.12) and to BRL37344 (pD(2) control: 8.43 +/- 0.19; stress: 7.54 +/- 0.21) were desensitized. Responses to the higher concentration (100 microm) of isoprenaline (control: 1.80 +/- 0.18; stress: 2.24 +/- 0.10 micromol glycerol/100 mg total lipids/100 min), epinephrine (control: 1.64 +/- 0.17; stress: 2.24 +/- 0.14 micromol glycerol/100 mg total lipids/100 min), salbutamol (control: 0.65 +/- 0.11; stress: 1.21 +/- 0.41 micromol glycerol/100 mg total lipids/100 min), and d-butyryl-cAMP (control: 1.59 +/- 0.17; stress: 2.72 +/- 0.25) were significantly enhanced in adipocytes from stressed rats. pD(2) or maximum response to CGP12177 were not altered. Supersensitivity to isoprenaline was abolished by 50 nm ICI118,551 but was not modified by 100 nm metoprolol. However, subsensitivity to norepinephrine and to BRL37344 was abolished by 100 nM metoprolol. Our results suggest that in epididymal adipocytes from stressed rats there is a desensitization of the response to adrenoceptor agonists mediated by beta(1)-adrenoceptors together with a sensitization of the response mediated by beta(2)-adrenoceptors. beta(3)-adrenoceptors seem to be resistant to the stress effect.", 
    "61": "The use of dobutamine as selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor agonist in in vivo studies on human thermogenesis and lipid utilization was investigated in 20 men. At 2.5, 5, and 10 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1), dobutamine induced significant increases in energy expenditure, lipid oxidation, and lipolysis. The beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (bolus: 42.5 microg/kg, infusion: 1.02 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) blocked all dobutamine-induced effects on thermogenesis and lipid utilization. All parameters remained at levels comparable to those during saline infusion. The dose of atenolol used did not inhibit beta(2)-adrenoceptor-specific changes in energy expenditure, lipid oxidation, and lipolysis during salbutamol infusion (85 ng x kg(-1) x min(-1)). This indicates that atenolol was specific for beta(1)-adrenoceptors and did not camouflage concomitant beta(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation during dobutamine infusion. Therefore, we conclude that dobutamine can be used as a selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor agonist at dosages </=10 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) in in vivo studies on human thermogenesis and lipid utilization.", 
    "62": "A wide variety of pharmacological agents are currently used for prevention of recurrent neurally mediated syncope, especially the vasovagal faint. None, however, have unequivocally proven long-term effectiveness based on adequate randomized clinical trials. At the present time, beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, along with agents that increase central volume (eg, fludrocortisone, electrolyte-containing beverages), appear to be favored treatment options. The antiarrhythmic agent disopyramide and various serotonin reuptake blockers have also been reported to be beneficial. Finally, vasoconstrictor agents such as midodrine offer promise and remain the subject of clinical study. Ultimately, though, detailed study of the pathophysiology of these syncopal disorders and more aggressive pursuit of carefully designed placebo-controlled treatment studies are essential if pharmacological prevention of recurrent neurally mediated syncope is to be placed on a firm foundation.", 
    "63": "An intravenous injection of 2 microg of [Asp1,Val5]-ANG II attenuated fluid secretion by the nasal salt glands of Pekin ducks. Ganglionic blockade with mecamylamine stopped salt gland secretion. Flow was reestablished by intravenous methacholine bromide during ganglionic blockade. A second injection of 2 microg of [Asp1, Val5]-ANG II failed to attenuate secretion during ganglionic blockade, showing that the peptide acts via the central nervous system and postganglionic parasympathetic nerves that supply the salt glands. Sympathetic nerves are located in the walls of blood vessels within the salt glands, and adrenergic fibers with \"varicosities\" supply extensively the secretory tubules. [Asp1, Val5]-ANG II decreased salt gland secretion both before and after alpha1-adrenergic blockade with prazosin, showing that the lowered activity was not caused by the release of norepinephrine from nerve endings and/or duck adrenal chromaffin cells. beta-Adrenergic blockade with propranolol also failed to prevent the attenuation of secretion in response to an intravenous injection of 2 microg of [Asp1,Val5]-ANG II, which showed that epinephrine did not mediate the response to the peptide.", 
    "64": "The hypothesis that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A; PKA) is in an active state in small arteries possessing a myogenic tone was investigated in pressurized rat tail small arteries. At a pressure of 80 mmHg, these vessels constricted to 71.6 +/- 1.0% (n = 32) of the diameter of the fully relaxed state. The PKA inhibitors Rp-8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphothioate (Rp-CPT-cAMPS) and N-(2-([3-(4-bromophenyl)-2-propenyl]amino)-ethyl)-5- isoquinolinesulfonamide HCl (H-89) constricted these vessels dose dependently. For example, 300 microM Rp-CPT-cAMPS and 9 microM H-89 reduced vessel diameter by 11.0 +/- 1.2% (n = 8) and 14.3 +/- 3.6% (n = 5), respectively. The cGMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase G; PKG) inhibitor Rp-8-bromo-beta-phenyl-1,N(2)-etheno-guanosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphothioate (Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS) did not alter vessel diameter up to a concentration of 10 microM. Neither endothelium removal nor inhibition of neural transmission affected the action of Rp-CPT-cAMPS. The effect of 300 microM Rp-CPT-cAMPS was reduced by 82% after pretreatment of the vessel with 100 nM iberiotoxin, a blocker of calcium-activated potassium (K(Ca)) channels. However, the effect of 300 microM Rp-CPT-cAMPS was not altered after pretreatment with 1 mM 4-aminopyridine, a blocker of delayed rectifier potassium channels, or 10 microM ryanodine, a blocker of ryanodine receptor-generated calcium sparks. In inside-out patch-clamp experiments on cells isolated from rat tail small arteries, 10 U/ml of the catalytic subunit of PKA together with 100 microM MgATP increased K(Ca) channel activity 30.1 +/- 9. 8-fold (n = 9). Additionally, neither inhibition of PKA or PKG nor moderate activation of PKA or PKG altered the vessel response to a pressure step from 80 to 120 mmHg. These results suggest that in rat tail small arteries possessing a myogenic tone 1) PKA is in an active state modulating the level of the myogenic tone, and 2) K(Ca) channels mediate, at least partly, this effect of PKA.",

Procedural complications or electrocardiogram changes occurred in only 49% of the CK-MB-elevation cases; CK-MB elevation was more common after nonballoon devices (19.5% vs. 11.5% after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty; p < 0.01). Predictors of CK-MB elevation on multivariate analysis were diffuse coronary disease (p = 0.02), systemic atherosclerosis (p = 0.002), stent use (p = 0.04) and absence of beta-blocker therapy (p = 0.001). Adverse in-hospital cardiac events were more frequent in patients with >5x CK-MB elevation, with no significant difference between 1-5x CK-MB elevation versus normal CK-MB group.

In-hospital clinical events requiring prolonged monitoring were higher in >5x CK-MB-elevation patients only. Midterm survival of CK-MB-elevation patients was similar to those with normal CK-MB. Our prospective analysis shows a lack of adverse in-hospital cardiac events and suggests that early discharge of stable 1-5x normal CK-MB-elevation patients after successful coronary intervention is safe.",

The absolute configurations of some of these drugs are identified by comparison to VCD spectra of similar molecules and by VCD intensity calculations on fragments of the drugs, utilizing either the locally distributed origin gauge (LDO) model or a priori vibronic coupling theory (VCT) methods. The most abundant conformations of propranolol, flecainide and RAC 109 in non-aqueous solution are also identified from the VCD spectra. This study demonstrates the utility of VCD in this spectral region for identification of solution conformation and absolute configuration for pharmaceuticals of moderate size. The conformations deduced from the VCD spectra provide insight into the stereospecific binding of the antiarrhythmic drugs.", 
    "75": "Classification methods based on linear discriminant analysis, recursive partitioning, and hierarchical agglomerative clustering are examined for their ability to separate active and inactive compounds in a diverse chemical database. Topology-based descriptions of chemical structure from the Molconn-X and ISIS programs are used in conjunction with these classification techniques to identify ACE inhibitors, beta-adrenergic antagonists, and H2 receptor antagonists. Overall, discriminant analysis misclassifies the smallest number of active compounds, while recursive partitioning yields the lowest rate of misclassification among inactives. Binary structural keys from the ISIS package are found to generally outperform the whole-molecule Molconn-X descriptors, especially for identification of inactive compounds. For all targets and classification methods, sensitivity toward active compounds is increased by making repetitive classification using training sets that contain equal numbers of actives and inactives. These balanced training sets provide an average numerical class membership score which may be used to select subsets of compounds that are enriched in actives.",

There was a significant decrease in the MDA levels post-treatment (p < 0.001 in the PTU + PRP group and PTU + PRP + vitE group, p < 0.01 in the PTU group). In the hyperthyroidism, blood reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were lower, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were higher than in the control group, but these changes were not significant. Post-treatment in each of the three groups the GSH levels were increased significantly as compared to the pretreatment levels (p < 0.001). There was significant decrease in the SOD activity post treatment (p < 0.01 in all three groups). Post-treatment CAT activity was decreased (p < 0.05 in the PTU group, p < 0.001 in the other two groups). The erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) activity was lower significantly in the hyperthyroidism as compared to the control group (p < 0.001).

The results showed that the piloerection changed with age. Pharmacological studies showed that the piloerection was inhibited by an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, but, surprisingly, was not inhibited by anxiolytic diazepam. These findings strongly suggest that the neuronal system of piloerection is different from that of freezing behavior, and that the neuronal system of piloerection develops with age.", 
    "89": "The aim of our study was to assess whether acute variations in portal vein Doppler sonographic parameters induced by administration of a single beta-blocker agent are predictive of the long-term effects of these drugs in the prevention of a first episode of variceal bleeding. In 30 patients with liver cirrhosis at high risk for variceal bleeding, duplex Doppler sonographic parameters (maximal portal flow velocity, portal blood flow, and congestion index) were measured before and 4 h after the administration of 40 mg of propranolol. Twenty-three of these patients started chronic therapy with propanolol and were evaluated periodically (seven patients were excluded because they did not continue the therapy). The percentage of patients free from bleeding was 86.9% at the first year and 77.8% at the second year. Among a series of clinical, laboratory, and instrument-based parameters, the only one related to first bleeding, selected by the Cox regression model, was the percentage decrease in maximal portal flow velocity observed after initial administration of propranolol (P < 0.01). The best cutoff value for the percentage decrease in portal flow velocity (portal flow velocity test) was 12%. The prevalence of bleeding had been 25% (3 of 12) in patients with positive portal flow velocity test results (12% decrease or more), versus 64% (7 of 11) in patients with negative portal flow velocity test results. The actuarial probability of remaining free from bleeding (Kaplan-Meier analysis) was different in these two groups (log rank P < 0.01). The portal flow velocity test represents a safe and feasible method to predict the efficacy of beta-blockers in the prevention of a first bleeding episode in patients with cirrhosis. In patients with negative results on the portal flow velocity test, an alternative therapeutic approach should be considered.", 
    "90": "The present study investigated whether regional ventricular dyskinesia (ie, systolic bulging) is a direct cause of ST-segment elevation in canine hearts in vivo. Regional ventricular dyskinesia was induced in 33 anesthetized open-chest dogs by injection of negative inotropic agents into the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) without disruption of coronary blood flow. Regional myocardial contraction was assessed in terms of the percent systolic shortening (%SS) and percent systolic bulging (%bulging), which were measured using ultrasonic crystals. The ST-segment elevation of the LAD-perfused area was measured with a unipolar electrode. Lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, nicorandil, a potassium channel opener, propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, or verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, was administered by intracoronary injection during maximal vasodilation induced by adenosine. All drugs induced dose-dependent ST-segment elevation in association with a parallel reduction in %SS and a parallel increase in %bulging. The absence of myocardial ischemia was confirmed by the absence of NADH fluorescence. It was concluded that regional ventricular dyskinesia had an important role in ST-segment elevation not associated with myocardial ischemia.", 
    "91": "In this study, we examined the effect of adrenaline and interleukin-1beta on interleukin-6 secretion from cultured murine neurohypophyseal cells. Cells were cultured from neurohypophyses of 3- to 5-week-old mice and experiments were performed after 13 days in culture. Interleukin-6 was measured in 24-h samples using a sandwich fluoroimmunoassay. Unstimulated cells released 19+/-3 fmol interleukin-6/neurohypophysis/24 h (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 42). Adrenaline and interleukin-1beta increased the release of interleukin-6 from the cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Incubation with adrenaline (10(-6) M) or interleukin-1beta (11 pM) induced maximal secretion of interleukin-6, resulting in a 2.2-fold and 19.8-fold increase, respectively (P<0.01). The action of adrenaline (10(-6) M) and interleukin-1beta (1.1 pM) was examined separately and together. The sum of the effect of the two compounds given alone was significantly less (P<0.05) than the effect when adrenaline and interleukin-1beta were given together. We examined the effect of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (3.4x10(-6) M), the beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist (+/-)-1-[2,3-(Dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methyl-eth yl)amino]-2-butanol (ICI 118551) (10(-7) M) and the beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (10(-7) M and 10(-6) M) on the adrenaline-stimulated release of interleukin-6. Propranolol and ICI 118551 completely blocked the action of adrenaline, whereas atenolol was inactive. It is concluded that the stimulatory effect of adrenaline is mediated via beta2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "92": "The syndrome of angina and normal coronary arteries (syndrome X) comprises a heterogeneous group of patients with typical chest pain, a positive exercise test, angiographically smooth coronary arteries and no evidence of spasm. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to detect areas of myocardial ischemia and/or recent necrosis both in animal and human studies. Most of these studies have been conducted after intravenous administration of the paramagnetic contrast medium gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA), that is considered a sensitive marker of extracellular, probably ischemic in origin, edema. On the basis of these data, we used MRI to evaluate the possibility of myocardial Gd-DTPA deposition at rest in patients with syndrome X, and to assess the effects of oral treatment with atenolol.", 
    "93": "We have studied 24 patients with syndrome X, 10 patients with coronary artery disease and 10 age-matched control subjects. The protocol was similar in all study subjects. Exercise testing and MRI were undertaken off therapy after coronary arteriography. Following MRI, patients underwent a 10 day treatment period with atenolol and repeated exercise stress test and MRI while on therapy.", 
    "94": "In all patients with syndrome X and coronary artery disease were observed effort diagnostic ST-segment changes that were associated with angina in 9 (37%) and 7 (70%) patients, respectively. Of 24 patients with syndrome X, 16 (66.6%) showed areas of myocardial enhancement after Gd-DTPA in comparison to the precontrast imaging. In 4 out of 10 patients with coronary artery disease (40%), Gd-DTPA accumulation was documented. Finally, focal Gd-DTPA myocardial enhancement was not observed in any normal control subject. After beta-blockade, 22 (92%) patients with syndrome X and 2 (20%) with coronary artery disease did not show any ischemic ST-segment changes on effort; 14 syndrome X patients (88%) and 2 coronary artery disease patients (50%) showed complete disappearance of the previously Gd-DTPA enhanced areas on MRI.", 
    "95": "Patients with syndrome X often exhibit regional accumulation of Gd-DTPA on MRI. The agent is believed to trace interstitial water accumulation as occurs during ischemia and its accumulation is reduced or abolished by treatment with atenolol, probably by different mechanisms. It is likely that an overactivation of the sympathetic outflow to the cardiovascular system can induce most of the abnormalities observed in syndrome X patients. In this context, beta-blockers probably represent the mainstay of the medical treatment of this condition.", 
    "96": "The aim of this study was to analyze drug use in 347 residents in homes for the aged in Bergen, Norway. All drugs prescribed on a regular schedule were assessed, the prevalence of potentially harmful drug combinations, and inappropriately prescribed drugs were studied and related to mental capacity of the residents. Mental capacity was assessed by means of the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR). The median number of drugs used was 4.0 (range 0-11, 95% CI 3.0-4.0). Mentally impaired residents consumed fewer drugs than mentally intact ones. In a logistic regression analysis the use of NSAIDS, beta-blockers and anxiolytics was significantly lower in mentally impaired residents (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17-0.80, OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.13-0.95, and OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21-0.94, respectively), and the use of laxatives and vitamin B-12 higher (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.04-4.62, and OR 5.08, 95% CI 1.11-23.25, respectively). Twenty percent of mentally intact and 21% of mentally impaired residents have potentially harmful two-by-two drug combinations, and drugs augmenting sedating properties were dominating. The prevalence of inappropriately used drugs was significantly lower in mentally impaired residents (20%) than in mentally intact ones (33%). Antidepressants with anticholinergic properties, benzodiazepines with long half-life and phenothiazines were the most frequent.", 
    "97": "beta-Adrenergic receptors are involved in altering cerebral metabolism and blood flow. This study was performed to determine whether propranolol would alter the microregional O2 balance in the brain. Rats were anesthetized with 1.4% isoflurane. Isotonic sodium chloride solution (control group), propranolol 2 mg/kg (low propranolol group) or propranolol 20 mg/kg (high propranolol group) was administered IV to the rats. Twenty minutes later, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using the 14C-iodoantipyrine autoradiographic technique. Small (diameter <70 microm) arterial and venous oxygen saturation (SaO2 and SvO2, respectively) was determined using microspectrophotometry in the alternate slices of the tissue sections used to measure rCBF. In both the low and high propranolol groups, average cortical rCBF was 35% lower than that in the control group. The average O2 consumption of the cortex of the propranolol groups was significantly lower than control (low propranolol: -41%, high propranolol: -49%). In all groups, SaO2 was almost identi-cal. The heterogeneity of the microregional SvO2 expressed as the coefficient of variation (CV = 100 x sD/mean) was significantly lower in the propranolol groups (low propranolol: 8.0+/-2.3, high propranolol: 7.3 +/- 2.9) than in the control group (13.4 +/- 3.5). The proportion of cortical veins with Svo2 <55% was significantly smaller in the low and high propranolol groups (4 of 60 and 3 of 60, respectively) than that in the control group (15 of 60). In the other brain regions, the data followed a similar pattern. Our data demonstrated that propranolol is effective in decreasing O2 consumption, improving microregional O2 balance, and reducing its heterogeneity in the brain.", 
    "98": "Our data suggest that the linkage of O2 supply and consumption is not tightly coupled under isoflurane anesthesia. beta-Adrenergic blockers may tighten this linkage and reduce the number of low O2-saturated microregions.", 
    "99": "Propofol (iv) depresses cardiovascular function in both humans and animals. However, the mechanism underlying this action has not been well described. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that this effect of propofol results in part from an antagonism of adrenergic control of the heart. Experiments examined effects of propofol on: 1) [3H]CGP12177 (a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) binding in rat myocardial membranes; and 2) the inotropic and chronotropic actions of isoproterenol in rat left atrial muscle and right atria, respectively. Propofol (25-200 microM) increased the apparent dissociation constant for [3H]CGP12177 without affecting binding site density. Similarly, 200 microM propofol increased the 50% effective concentration values for the dose-dependent positive chronotropic and inotropic actions of isoproterenol in right and left atria, and depressed the maximum increase in spontaneous rate elicited by this beta-adrenoceptor agonist. Other experiments demonstrated that propofol does not alter muscarinic receptor binding as monitored using [3H]quinuclidi-nylbenzilate. In conclusion, these results indicate that propofol can decrease cardiac beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness; however, the concentrations of propofol required suggest that this action contributes to the cardiovascular depression produced by this anesthetic only during large-dose bolus injection.", 
    "100": "Experiments in membranes and cardiac preparations isolated from rat heart demonstrate that relatively high concentrations of propofol (25-200 microM) are required to antagonize beta-adrenoceptor binding and tissue responsiveness.", 
    "101": "The 'proof of concept' of beta-blockade for heart failure (i.e. that the pharmacologic actions of beta-blockers are beneficial) is now firmly established, as the treatment of heart failure has progressed from using positive inotropic stimulation, via drugs with no direct effect on cardiac function, to beta-blockers with negative intropic effects. This review addresses some remaining issues regarding beta-blockade in heart failure. The mechanism of action of beta-blockers in heart failure is more likely to be improved intrinsic cardiac myocyte function and prevention or reversal of remodeling, than restoration of beta-adrenergic signal transduction. The role of the differentiating characteristics of beta-blockers is not clear at this time, and there is no compelling evidence to select one agent over another on the basis of individual drug properties. Recent reports suggest that beta-blockers reduce the combined risk of all-cause mortality and hospitalizations by about 30-35%. These results are heavily influenced by experience with carvedilol, but other agents tested include metoprolol, bucindolol, bisoprolol, and nebivolol. Responsiveness to beta-blockers is not related to patients' age, sex, or race, or to the etiology or severity of heart failure. Beta-blockers are currently recommended as adjunctive treatment in patients who remain mildly to moderately symptomatic while receiving added digitalis, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Existing gaps in our knowledge must be filled in order to achieve optimal clinical application of beta-blockers. Ongoing studies will provide much of the information required. The role of beta-blockers will probably expand as we improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure, and especially of the remodeling process.", 
    "102": "1. Effects of bradykinin (BK) on renal haemodynamics and urine formation were examined in anaesthetized dogs. 2. Renal arterial infusion of BK at doses of 5 or 50 ng/kg per min produced dose-dependent increases in renal blood flow (RBF), without affecting systemic arterial pressure or glomerular filtration rate. There were also significant and dose-dependent increases in urine flow (UF), urinary excretion of sodium (UNaV) and fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) and decreases in urine osmolality during BK infusion. 3. Renal haemodynamic and excretory responses to the BK infusion were completely abolished by the simultaneous administration of Hoe 140 (icatibant, 100 ng/kg per min intrarenally), a selective BK B2-receptor antagonist. 4. In the presence of NG-nitro-L-arginine (NOARG; 40 micrograms/kg per min intrarenally), a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, BK-induced renal vasodilative and natriuretic effects were markedly attenuated, although responses of UF and urine osmolality to BK remained unchanged. The water diuretic effect of BK was abolished in dogs given both NOARG and ibuprofen (12.5 mg/kg bolus injection plus 12.5 mg/kg per h of sustained infusion intravenously), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. 5. These results clearly indicate that renal haemodynamic and excretory responses to BK were mediated exclusively by the B2-receptor. Renal vasodilative and natriuretic responses are mainly linked to NO generation, while both NO and prostaglandin biosynthesis are involved in the BK-induced water diuresis.", 
    "103": "The meta-analysis of multi-centre trials can be based on either fixed or random effect models. This paper argues for the general use of random effect models, and illustrates the value of non-parametric maximum likelihood (NPML) analysis of such trials. The same general approach unifies administrative 'league table' analyses in epidemiological and other studies. Several examples of the NPML analysis are given, including a 70-centre trial.", 
    "104": "The dissociating and/or residual inhibitory effects of bopindolol from beta-adrenoceptors (ARs) of atria strips pretreated with this drug and washed out with buffers on isoprenaline-induced chronotropic actions were determined. The effects of this drug were compared with those of its active metabolite 18-502, propranolol, and pindolol. Our results are as follows: (1) Lower concentrations of bopindolol (10(-9) and 10(-8) mol/l) and the active metabolite 18-502 (10(-9) mol/l), propranolol (10(-8) and 10(-6) mol/l) and pindolol (10(-8) mol/l) produced rightward shifts of concentration-response curves of isoprenaline. (2) Higher concentrations of bopindolol (10(-7) mol/l) and 18-502 (10(-8) and 10(-7) mol/l) produced a reduced maximum response by isoprenaline. (3) Bopindolol (10(-9)-10(-7) mol/l), 18-502 (10(-9)-10(-7) mol/l) and propranolol (10(-7) and 10(-6) mol/l) did not recover to control levels at 180 min even after washout with buffers. In conclusion, bopindolol and 18-502 may slowly dissociate and act as noncompetitive beta-antagonists rather than readily reversible beta-AR antagonists. These effects may differ from those of propranolol and pindolol, although propranolol did not recover to control levels after washout with buffer.", 
    "105": "There is now considerable clinical trial data to support the use of beta-blockers in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) due to systolic left ventricular dysfunction. A substantial database has accumulated over the last 20 years supporting the benefits of these agents on ventricular function and clinical status. In addition, morbidity and mortality benefits have been suggested, specifically with the non-selective vasodilating agent, carvedilol. More recently, a \"new wave\" of clinical trials have been conducted to definitively determine the mortality benefits of beta-blockers in patients with mild to moderate CHF as well as addressing other important clinical questions. These questions include whether the beneficial effects of carvedilol on survival can be reproduced by other agents in prospective, adequately powered studies; whether the benefits of carvedilol in systolic heart failure are due to its beta-blocking properties alone or to a combination of the beta-blocking and ancillary effects of the drug; whether beta-blockers are of benefit in patients with severe New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IIIB-IV CHF; and, whether beta-blockers are of benefit (additional to ACE inhibitors) in patients with evidence of systolic ventricular dysfunction when commenced in the immediate post-myocardial infarction period. Major studies are currently being undertaken to address the above questions. Most are still underway but 3 studies have recently reported their results: the second Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS II), the Research in Left Ventricular Dysfunction Study (RESOLVD), and the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomised Intervention Trial in Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) study. These studies have demonstrated that blockade with beta1-selective, non-vasodilating agents (i.e. bisoprolol and metoprolol) improve survival in patients with CHE Comparison of relative risk reduction in these recent studies with the earlier carvedilol studies raises mechanistic questions, specifically whether non-selectivity, vasodilation and other ancillary properties of carvedilol are critical to its benefit in CHF patients. This question is currently being addressed in the Carvedilol and Metoprolol European Trial (COMET), comparing metoprolol with carvedilol. The beneficial effects of beta-blockers on mortality in patients with mild to moderate CHF have also had major implications in ongoing studies of other agents in this condition. Open-label prescribing of beta-blockers is increasing in these studies and this is having an impact on event rates and thus required duration of administration of study drug. Furthermore, it would now appear unethical to deprive suitable NYHA Class II-III CHF patients of beta-blockers as part of the design of such studies. In conclusion, beta-blockers have now become the most extensively studied class of agents in the treatment of CHF, with a database of over 6000 patients in placebo-controlled studies, and ongoing clinical and mechanistic studies. Despite this, further questions remain regarding the use of these agents in CHF, including their role in the extreme elderly, in patients with diabetes mellitus and in patients with renal impairment.",

To characterize this action, cells were incubated in the presence of NEpi or Epi and different antagonists. The beta-adrenergic antagonist Propanolol showed no effect on the agonist's stimulation, whereas the alpha-adrenergic antagonist Phentolamine, reverted it completely at high concentrations (100 microM). The alpha1-adrenergic antagonist Prazosin (Pra) acted only at high concentrations, while the alpha2-adrenergic antagonist Yohimbine (Yo) reverted the stimulation at an EC50 of 0.11 microM. Likewise, when the cells were incubated in the presence of the specific alpha2-adrenergic agonist Clonidine (Clo), Thymidine incorporation was significantly stimulated at an EC50 of 0.298 pM. Again, the incubation of the cells in the presence of the alpha1-adrenergic antagonist Pra exerted its action at high concentrations, whereas the alpha2-adrenergic antagonist Yo showed a clear reversal of the agonist's enhancement at an EC50 of 0.136 microM. Moreover, Clo caused a clear and significant inhibition of stimulated cAMP levels both in the intracellular and the extracellular fractions. Yo showed a complete reversion of cAMP levels to control values in the presence of Clo, while Pra had the opposite effect. These data suggest that the stimulation provoked in Thymidine incorporation by the agonists Epi, NEpi, and Clo is, at least in part, due to an alpha2-adrenergic mechanism directly on tumoral cells, and that the effect is coupled with inhibition of cAMP levels, as described for this kind of receptors.", 
    "107": "We provide the first evidence that point mutations can constitutively activate the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (AR). Leucine 322 of the beta(1)-AR in the C-terminal portion of its third intracellular loop was replaced with seven amino acids (I, T, E, F, C, A and K) differing in their physico-chemical properties. The beta(1)-AR mutants expressed in HEK-293 cells displayed various levels of constitutive activity which could be partially inhibited by some beta-blockers. The results of this study might have interesting implications for future studies aiming at elucidating the activation process of the beta(1)-AR as well as the mechanism of action of beta-blockers.", 
    "108": "We previously reported that lung edema clearance was stimulated by dopamine (DA). The purpose of this study was to determine whether the DA-mediated stimulation of edema clearance occurs via an adrenergic or dopaminergic regulation of alveolar epithelial Na, K-ATPase. When isolated perfused rat lungs were coinstilled with DA and SCH 23390 (a specific D(1) receptor antagonist), there was a dose-dependent attenuation of the stimulatory effects of DA. Coinstillation with S-sulpiride (a specific D(2) receptor antagonist) or propranolol (a beta-adrenergic antagonist) did not alter DA-stimulated clearance. Similarly, the specific dopaminergic D(1) agonist fenoldopam increased lung edema clearance, but quinpirole (a specific dopaminergic D(2) agonist) did not. (125)I-SCH 23982 binding studies suggested that D(1) receptors are expressed on alveolar type II (ATII) cells with an apparent dissociation constant (K(d)) of 4.4 nM and binding maximum (Bmax) 9.8 pmol/mg. Consistent with these results, the D(1) receptor messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were detected in ATII cells by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism involving the activation of dopaminergic D(1) receptors which mediates DA-stimulated edema removal from rat lungs.",

On the first occasion cholestasis developed unusually in the first trimester, and on the second occasion, it presented in the way that obstetric cholestasis (OC) is commonly seen in the third trimester.", 
    "110": "The present results show that topically applied Betoptic(R)(0.5% betaxolol) to the rabbit or rat eye reaches the retina and can counteract the detrimental effects caused by ischaemia/reperfusion or N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA)-induced insults to the retina. Betaxolol is a beta(1)-adrenergic blocker but its neuroprotective action is generally thought to be due to its calcium channel blocking properties. Support for this view comes from studies on cultures of cortical neurones where it was found that betaxolol attenuated the NMDA-induced influx of(45)Ca(2+)while beta-adrenoreceptor agonists were ineffective. Topically applied Betoptic(R)to the rabbit eye was observed to reach the retina in maximal amounts within 60 min. Some of the substance was also found in the contralateral retina of the untreated eye suggesting that the agent reaches the retina by local systemic and retinal circulation. Concurrent treatment with Latanoprost(R)did not result in a greater amount of betaxolol reaching the retina. An ophthalmodynamometric procedure, which raises the intraocular pressure, was used to apply an ischaemic insult to the rabbit retina. After three days of reperfusion the b-wave of the electroretinogram was reduced by an average of 59% and the choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity in the retina was almost obliterated. However, when experiments were carried out on animals which had been treated with one drop of Betoptic(R) twice daily for 4 weeks before ischaemia and also during the reperfusion phase, the reductions in both the b-wave of the electroretinogram and retinal choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity due to ischaemia/reperfusion were greatly attenuated. Intravitreal injection of NMDA into the rat eye caused a decrease in the immunostaining for Thy-1 antigen which is associated with ganglion cells. The Thy-1 mRNA level was also reduced as was the mRNA for the common subunit of the NMDA receptor, the NR1 subunit. However, in animals subjected to a topical Betoptic(R)regime, before and after intravitreal injection of NMDA, the decreases in the mRNA levels of Thy-1 and NR1 were significantly attenuated.", 
    "111": "Salmeterol is a long-acting beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR) agonist used clinically to treat asthma. In addition to binding at the active agonist site, it has been proposed that salmeterol also binds with very high affinity at a second site, termed the \"exosite\", and that this exosite contributes to the long duration of action of salmeterol. To determine the position of the phenyl ring of the aralkyloxyalkyl side chain of salmeterol in the beta 2AR binding site, we designed and synthesized the agonist photoaffinity label [(125)I]iodoazidosalmeterol ([125I]IAS). In direct adenylyl cyclase activation, in effects on adenylyl cyclase after pretreatment of intact cells, and in guinea pig tracheal relaxation assays, IAS and the parent drug salmeterol behave essentially the same. Significantly, the photoreactive azide of IAS is positioned on the phenyl ring at the end of the molecule which is thought to be involved in exosite binding. Carrier-free radioiodinated [125I]IAS was used to photolabel epitope-tagged human beta 2AR in membranes prepared from stably transfected HEK 293 cells. Labeling with [(125)I]IAS was blocked by 10 microM (-)-alprenolol and inhibited by addition of GTP gamma S, and [125I]IAS migrated at the same position on an SDS-PAGE gel as the beta 2AR labeled by the antagonist photoaffinity label [125I]iodoazidobenzylpindolol ([125I]IABP). The labeled receptor was purified on a nickel affinity column and cleaved with factor Xa protease at a specific sequence in the large loop between transmembrane segments 5 and 6, yielding two peptides. While the control antagonist photoaffinity label [125I]IABP labeled both the large N-terminal fragment [containing transmembranes (TMs) 1-5] and the smaller C-terminal fragment (containing TMs 6 and 7), essentially all of the [125I]IAS labeling was on the smaller C-terminal peptide containing TMs 6 and 7. This direct biochemical evidence demonstrates that when salmeterol binds to the receptor, its hydrophobic aryloxyalkyl tail is positioned near TM 6 and/or TM 7. A model of IAS binding to the beta 2AR is proposed.", 
    "112": "Cardiovascular disease and depression are intimately related illnesses. Cardiovascular mortality is more common in persons with depression, and depression following a myocardial infarction is associated with significantly poorer cardiac outcome. Safe and effective simultaneous treatment of depression and cardiovascular illness can be difficult because of the interplay between these conditions. We examine the evidence for cardiovascular effects of depression, as well as the proposed mechanism for these effects. We also review the cardiovascular effects of antidepressant treatments and the mood-altering effects of common cardiovascular medications. Articles reviewed were derived from a Medline search of English-language articles published between 1970 and 1998 (search terms: cardiovascular disease, antidepressants, psychiatry, myocardial infarction, antihypertensive agents, depression).", 
    "113": "The present study analyses the presence of beta-adrenoceptors in the main telencephalic song nuclei of the goldfinch and parakeet, species belonging to the two most important groups of birds that reproduce learned songs: oscine songbirds and parrots, respectively. Brains of both species sectioned at appropriate levels were used to perform autoradiographic saturation studies using [3H]CGP 12177 as a radioligand. The results show similar K(D)values for both species (0.1-0.3 nM) and striking differences in Bmax. Thus, beta-adrenoceptors are abundant in the telencephalic vocal control nuclei of the parakeet but not of the goldfinch. The predominance of the beta2 subtype in the song nuclei of both species is also confirmed. We conclude that these receptors could be involved in functions unique to the parakeet and therefore may contribute to the greater flexibility of the vocal system of this species. Our findings also support the possible involvement of beta-adrenoceptors in the evolution of the avian brain.", 
    "114": "Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems overactivity play a major role in worsening the extent of heart failure. Attenuation of neurohumoral activation with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers has proven beneficial in congestive heart failure. Because ACE inhibition is a recommended treatment for heart failure, this study was designed to test the effects on neurohumoral activation, hemodynamics, and left ventricular (LV) volume of the combination of an ACE inhibitor (delapril) with a DA2-dopaminergic receptor/alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist (CHF-1024) or a beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist (metoprolol) after a moderate to large myocardial infarction (MI) in rats. MI was induced by left coronary artery ligation in 134 rats, and six were not operated on. After 2 months, the animals with ECG evidence of MI were treated for 1 more month with CHF- 1024, 0.33 mg/kg/day or with metoprolol (10 mg/kg/day), delivered through implanted osmotic minipumps, in addition to delapril (6 mg/kg/day) in the drinking water. Daily urinary excretion of norepinephrine (NE) and circulating concentration were measured. Hemodynamic variables were measured, and three-dimensional morphometric analysis was done on the diastole-arrested hearts to quantify infarct size and LV geometry. In conscious animals, delapril alone or with CHF-1024 or metropolol did not modify heart rate or systolic blood pressure. Both combination treatments, however, significantly reduced heart rate in anesthetized animals compared with the group receiving vehicle. Infarct size was not different between treatments, averaging 20-22% of LV volume. The threefold increase of LV chamber volume in infarcted rats was significantly attenuated by delapril alone or with CHF-1024 or metoprolol (-37 to -44%, p<0.05). Treatment with a combination of the ACEi and CHF-1024 tended to normalize the shape of the LV cavity. Urinary NE excretion was unaffected by delapril alone but was reduced by the addition of CHF-1024 or metoprolol. In conclusion, 1 month of treatment with doses of delapril having no hemodynamic effect, reduced LV volume in a model of chronic heart failure. When CHF-1024 or metoprolol was given with delapril, sympathetic activation decreased with no unwanted effects, such as excessive hypotension.", 
    "115": "Heart failure has become the most widely studied syndrome in cardiology over the recent years. Despite the encouraging achievements by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the mortality of patients with chronic heart failure remains high. There are several factors which can potentially be responsible for the fact that about 80% of patients with a failing heart defy protection by ACE inhibitors: different activation of tissue and systemic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in a particular heart disease and the distinct ability of various ACE inhibitors to block cardiac ACE, alternative pathways for angiotensin II formation (chymase), genetic polymorphism of the RAS system and the complexity of neuroendocrine activation. Moreover, chronic heart failure can provoke disturbances in the reactivity of peripheral vessels and metabolism of striated muscles. These factors may then potentiate the vicious circle of heart failure. New therapeutic approaches, which could further reduce the mortality in patients with heart failure involve angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists and blockers of the endothelin receptor. A number of questions associated with functions of the RAS still remain open and their solution could be of substantial benefit for patients with a failing heart.", 
    "116": "In a prospective, randomized study, sevoflurane-remifentanil (Group SR) was compared with fentanyl-etomidate (Group FE) for induction of anaesthesia in patients with ischaemic heart disease. Cardiovascular stability, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, rate pressure product, rescue medications and associated myocardial ischaemia were measured. For Group SR (n = 20), anaesthesia was induced with vital capacity breaths of sevoflurane 5% in oxygen. After loss of consciousness, the inspired sevoflurane was reduced to 3% and remifentanil was administered as a 0.5 microgram.kg-1 bolus over 90 seconds (0.33 microgram.kg-1.min-1) followed by a 0.025 microgram.kg-1.min-1 infusion. After intubation, the inspired sevoflurane was reduced to 2%. For Group FE (n = 20), anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl 10.5 micrograms.kg-1 and etomidate 0.2 mg.kg-1 given 60 seconds later. Isoflurane 1% in oxygen was administered after loss of consciousness. Both groups received rocuronium and the trachea was intubated two minutes later. Sevoflurane gaseous induction was smooth, with cardiovascular stability comparable to fentanyl-etomidate. Significantly more patients in Group SR (P < 0.05) were on beta-blocking medication, and, overall, the HR and RPP was lower pre-intubation in Group SR. Remifentanil administration was associated with severe bradycardia in three patients and asystole in a fourth. All four patients were on beta-blocking medication and three of the four were on diltiazem. The study was terminated due to the high incidence of bradycardic/asystolic complications in Group SR.",

The stimulatory alpha-adrenergic pathway is mediated by calcineurin, the target molecule for FK 506 and related compounds.

    "119": "FK 520 treatment induced a pronounced and dose-dependent decrease in PT Na+,K+-ATPase activity. This effect was completely reversed by the competitive FK 520 antagonist, L 685 818, indicating that the effect was dependent on inhibition of calcineurin. To test whether the FK 520-induced decrease in Na+, K+-ATPase activity was mediated by enhanced beta-adrenoceptor signaling, the FK 520 effect was examined in rats pretreated with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (propranolol) or rats subjected to renal denervation. Both of these procedures prevented the FK 520-induced decrease in Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Thus, during FK 520 treatment, renal sympathetic nerves mediate an inhibitory effect on PT Na+,K+-ATPase activity via beta-adrenoceptors. Propranolol pretreatment also prevented FK 506-induced decreases in GFR and urinary excretion of NAG, an index of PT dysfunction.", 
    "120": "The results support the hypothesis that the net effect of the neurotransmitter NE on Na+,K+-ATPase activity is dependent on the balance between the alpha- and beta-adrenergic signaling pathways and suggest that agents that interfere with these pathways may, by altering the activity of tubular Na+,K+-ATPase, also alter the function of the renal tubular epithelial cell.",

Tissue cAMP, adenylyl cyclase, and protein kinase A (PKA) activities and beta-adrenergic receptor characteristics were assessed at different times. The role of cAMP generation in eliciting PC was studied by investigation of functional recovery during reperfusion after 25 minutes of global ischemia after (1) cAMP increases in the trigger period were prevented with the beta-adrenergic blocker alprenolol 7.5x10(-5) mol/L and (2) increases in cAMP were elicited by administration of forskolin 10(-7) and 10(-6) mol/L or isoproterenol 10(-8), 10(-7), and 10(-6) mol/L. Intermittent ischemia resulted in reduced beta-adrenergic responsivity at the end of the protocol, although B(max) and K(d) values of the beta-adrenergic receptor population and adenylyl cyclase and PKA activities were increased. Abolishment of cyclic increases in cAMP before sustained ischemia attenuated myocardial protection against ischemia, whereas agonists elicited protection.

The presenting symptoms of 367 patients (mean age 64 years) were coded according to the Braunwald classification, 86% being in class IIIB (primary unstable angina with rest angina within 48 hours) and 7.4% in class IIIC (postinfarction angina). Thirty-two patients (8.6%) had myocardial infarction at presentation (defined as a creatine kinase level exceeding twice the reference range within 18 hours).

    "147": "Thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of Ca(2+)-pump Ca(2+)-ATPase in the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER), produces an endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation. In the present study, pharmacological features of thapsigargin-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation were functionally characterized in the isolated guinea-pig aorta especially focusing on the Ca2+ mobilization mechanisms in endothelial cells. Thapsigargin-induced endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation was markedly suppressed by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) and calmidazolium, suggesting that the vascular relaxation to thapsigargin is largely attributable to endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) produced as a result of the activation of Ca2+, calmodulin-dependent NO synthase (NOS). Removal of Ca2+ from the external solution abolished the endothelium-dependent relaxation of guinea-pig aorta in response to thapsigargin. Thapsigargin-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation was inhibited more strongly compared with the endothelium-independent relaxation to an NO donor, SIN-1 (3-(4-morpholinyl)-sydnonimine), when the artery preparation was preconstricted with a high concentration (80 mM) of KCl instead of agonistic stimulation. Endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by thapsigargin was not affected by diltiazem, a blocker of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. SK&F96365 (1-[beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl]-1 H-imidazole) and Ni2+, both of which block capacitative Ca(2+) entry, did not show any appreciable inhibitory effects on the endothelium-dependent relaxation to thapsigargin. These findings suggest that in guinea-pig aorta, endothelium-dependent NO-mediated relaxation induced by thapsigargin is preceded by the increase in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]cyt) following the depletion of stored Ca2+ in thapsigargin-sensitive store sites in endothelial cells. Although the increase in [Ca2+]cyt responsible for the activation of endothelium NOS leading to thapsigargin-induced vascular relaxation may be ascribed to the capacitative Ca2+ entry from extracellular space, the Ca2+ entry mechanism stimulated with thapsigargin is deficient in sensitivity to SK&F96365 and Ni2+ in the endothelium of guinea-pig aorta.", 
    "148": "Hypertension is a significant and prevalent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease and target organ damage. The urgency of treatment of high blood pressure depends on the level of blood pressure elevation and the presence of coexistent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Likewise, the level to which blood pressure is reduced is not restricted to the definition of high blood pressure but instead depends on the underlying disease. Diabetes and renal insufficiency, for example, require blood pressure goals below those that are traditionally defined. In the absence of contraindications, beta-blockers and diuretics are still recommended as first-line agents for treatment of uncomplicated hypertension. Calcium channel antagonists also may reduce mortality. In patients with diabetes, ACE inhibitors are effective first-line agents in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients who are hypertensive or have microalbuminuria. ACE inhibitors may be beneficial in patients with nondiabetic renal insufficiency as well. Calcium channel antagonists may have some effect in retarding progression of diabetic nephropathy although a recent trial found a higher incidence of death as a secondary endpoint in hypertensive diabetic patients who were treated with calcium channel antagonists. Beta-blockers seem to be safe and well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate intermittent claudication, although patients with rest pain or limb ischemia have not been studied. Beta-blockers should not be used in patients with asthma. Dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists are the preferred treatment of hypertension in patients with Raynaud's but should be avoided in patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux disease. NSAIDs, particularly piroxicam and indomethacin, raise mean blood pressure by approximately 5 mm Hg, enough to consider a change of either NSAID or antihypertensive to one that is not as affected by NSAIDs. Cyclosporine A can induce hypertension by its vasoconstrictive effects, particularly on the kidney. Calcium channel antagonists may antagonize this vasoconstriction while allowing the clinician to reduce the dose of cyclosporine A required to achieve its immunosuppressive effect."
