    "0": "To determine whether cardioselective and nonselective beta-blocking agents impair exercise training effects in patients with cardiovascular disease, 50 subjects were evaluated. All were in a 3-times-weekly medically supervised outpatient exercise program for 3 months or longer. Treadmill exercise tests were done initially and at 3-month intervals. Eight patients were receiving atenolol, 23 propranolol, 3 timolol, 6 metoprolol, and 8 nadolol and 1 patient receiving timolol changed to atenolol and 1 receiving nadolol changed to propranolol. Treadmill test duration increased significantly (p less than 0.05), from 7.5 +/- 2.5 to 9.9 +/- 2.3 minutes, with exercise training. In 35 of the 50 subjects heart rate at rest decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) from 67.5 +/- 11.7 to 60.4 +/- 10.5 beats/min. The other 15 subjects were excluded from heart rate analysis because beta blockade was begun 1 to 2 weeks after the initial exercise test. It is concluded that exercise training effects (increase in exercise test duration and decrease in resting heart rate) can be achieved in patients with cardiovascular disease in the presence of both cardioselective and nonselective beta-blocking agents.", 
    "1": "Two types of saturable binding, besides the well-known non-specific binding, were found when hydrophobic ligands were used for investigating the vesiculization of beta-adrenoceptors on cultured HeLa and Chang liver cells. The first (compartment I) representing beta-adrenoceptors with high affinity ([3H]DHA 0.8 nM, 125I-CYP 27 pM) and low capacity (10-20 fmol/mg protein), the second (compartment II) had a rather high affinity ([3H]DHA 400 nM, 125I-CYP 30 nM) and a very high capacity (20 000-25 000 fmol/mg protein). The affinity of adrenergic agents for compartment II correlates very well (r = 0.9418) with the calculated hydrophobicity. It is concluded that these types of binding sites might interfere with the determination of adrenoceptor binding sites when hydrophobic ligands are used. When using hydrophobic ligands like these special care should be taken to avoid such interference.", 
    "2": "Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes cultured in serum-free medium coexpress both alpha 1 and beta 1 receptors as determined by radioligand binding studies. In cells exposed to serum for 48 hr surface area increased 3.69 fold, but the maximum number of binding sites ([125I]-iodocynanopindolol) only increased 1.5 fold from 12956 +/- 7579 to 19676 +/- 5181 sites/cell (n = 5, p less than .05) yielding a value of 2.48 sites/um2 for cells grown in serum-supplemented medium compared with 6.96 sites/um2 for cells grown in serum-free medium. Thus serum-induced hypertrophy is associated with a decrease in beta 1 receptor density relative to cell size; however, adenylate cyclase response is unaffected. This cell culture system constitutes an excellent model for studying interventions that may influence the regulation of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy by nonhemodynamic factors, particularly through the adrenergic receptor system.", 
    "3": "Quantitative determination of tertatolol concentrations in plasma and urine was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the chemical-ionization mode with ammonia after successive extractions of the beta-blocking drug in alkaline, acid and final alkaline medium. [2H9]Tertatolol, isotopically stable under the operating conditions employed, was used as an internal standard, thus allowing quantities of 1 ng/ml to be specifically determined. Overall analytical error was less than 10%. Prior to isothermal chromatography at 240 degrees C on a column packed with 3% SE-30, both compounds were silylated with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide. Detection was performed by monitoring the quasimolecular ions of tertatolol, m/z 368 and m/z 377, for the [2H9]tertatolol in the chemical-ionization mode with ammonia. The calibration curves obtained had linear characteristics for the concentration range 1-1125 ng/ml.", 
    "4": "We recently demonstrated that heterologous desensitization of adenylate cyclase in turkey erythrocytes is highly correlated with phosphorylation of the beta-adrenergic receptor. In contrast, little is known of the biochemical mechanisms underlying the homologous form of beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization, which is agonist-specific and not cAMP-mediated. Accordingly, the present studies were undertaken to examine if phosphorylation of the beta-adrenergic receptor is also associated with this form of desensitization in a well studied model system, the frog erythrocyte. Preincubation of these cells with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol leads to a 45% decline in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity without significant changes in basal, prostaglandin E1-, NaF-, guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate-, forskolin-, or MnCl2-stimulated enzyme activities. There is also a 48% decline in [125I]iodocyanopindolol membrane binding sites. Conversely, preincubation of the cells with prostaglandin E1 attenuates only the prostaglandin E1-stimulated enzyme activity and does not affect [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding. Phosphorylation of the beta-adrenergic receptor was assessed by preincubating the cells with 32Pi and desensitizing them, and subsequently purifying the receptors by affinity chromatography. Under basal conditions there is about 0.62 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor whereas after desensitization with isoproterenol this increases to 1.9 mol/mol. This isoproterenol-induced receptor phosphorylation exhibits stereospecificity and is blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. In addition, preincubation with prostaglandin E1 does not promote beta-adrenergic receptor phosphorylation. These data suggest that receptor phosphorylation is involved in homologous as well as heterologous forms of desensitization and may provide a unifying mechanism for desensitization of adenylate cyclase-coupled hormone receptors.", 
    "5": "The influence of urapidil, clonidine, prazosin and propranolol on autonomic nerve activity was determined in anaesthetized cats and rats. The effects of these drugs on blood pressure and heart rate were also evaluated. Impulse output was recorded in the splanchnic and vagus nerve of the cat, and in the cervical sympathetic trunk of the rat. Urapidil increased activity in sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibres in cats at low doses without affecting blood pressure and heart rate. At higher doses which lowered blood pressure, urapidil reduced sympathetic impulse output in cats and rats while vagal output was increased. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking agent, prazosin, did not affect activity in sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibres while the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, propranolol, increased activity in these nerves in cats. The alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, reduced sympathetic impulse output at all doses tested in both rats and cats. The results provide evidence that urapidil, in addition to its peripheral alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties, affects cardiovascular regulation by a central action. Blockade of alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors in the brain is probably not responsible for the central effect of urapidil.", 
    "6": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of inhibitors of the Na+,K+-pump and membrane depolarizing agents on endothelium-dependent relaxation and elevated cyclic GMP levels induced by acetylcholine in rat thoracic aorta. Ouabain or exposure to K+-free or Mg2+-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution, agents and procedures known to inhibit the Na+,K+-pump, inhibited acetylcholine-induced relaxation and the associated increased levels of cyclic GMP. However, the inhibitory effect of ouabain on cyclic GMP levels was abolished in the absence of norepinephrine or in the presence of norepinephrine and the alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine. The membrane depolarizing agents KCl and tetraethylammonium also inhibited the acetylcholine-induced relaxation and the elevated cyclic GMP levels. Exposure to norepinephrine reduced the increased levels of cyclic GMP due to acetylcholine as compared to rested controls. This effect was inhibited by prior exposure to phentolamine, but not by the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol. These results suggest that increased activity of the Na+,K+-pump may mediate, in part, endothelium-dependent relaxation; inhibition of relaxation may be due to membrane depolarization; the endothelium-dependent increased levels of cyclic GMP may increase Na+,K+-pump activity; a complex interaction exists between membrane polarization, the Na+,K+-pump and alpha-adrenergic stimulation in regulation of cyclic GMP accumulation and relaxation.", 
    "7": "The selectivities of WY26392 and yohimbine for prejunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors have been evaluated in the anaesthetised dog. Clonidine inhibited the tachycardia evoked by cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation, WY26392 and yohimbine reversed this effect by 50% at doses of 3.3-12 and 7.5-69.5 micrograms/kg respectively, depending upon the frequency of nerve stimulation. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine evoked a pressor response which was reduced by 50% following approximately 1.0 mg/kg of either antagonists. Due to its greater potency at alpha 2-adrenoceptors, WY26392 consistently exhibited a greater selectivity than yohimbine for this receptor. The haemodynamic evaluation of WY26392 and yohimbine revealed that low doses of these compounds (0.03-0.1 mg/kg i.v.) increased systolic blood pressure, heart rate and dp/dtmax. WY26392 evoked a small rise in diastolic blood pressure over this dose range. These increases may be due to an increase in sympathetic nerve activity resulting from alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade. Higher doses of these compounds reduced these cardiovascular parameters, possibly as a result of alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "8": "We analyzed the action of adenosine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) on the chronotropism of the dog heart in situ. The compounds were administered either intravenously (i.v.) after bivagotomy and propranolol treatment, or intracoronary (i.c.) in the sinus node blood supply. Under these conditions the intervention of reflex reactions was eliminated, and a constant and dose-dependent negative chronotropic effect was obtained. From the dose-response curves the relative potencies of ATP and adenosine were calculated, and found to be similar for both routes of administration (potency ratio 0.77 (0.72-0.82) by i.v. administration, and 0.52 (0.36-0.78) by intracoronary administration). The effect was also mimicked by 2-chloroadenosine, (a long acting P1 agonist), and by 5'-adenylyl (beta, gamma-imido) diphosphonate, a non-hydrolysable ATP analog. The chronotropic effect of ATP and adenosine were not prevented by 1 mg/kg atropine intravenous. Theophylline, at 3 mg/kg i.v., shifted the dose-response curves of i.v. ATP and adenosine to the right, suggesting a competitive antagonism. At a dose of 6 mg/kg theophylline, the effects of i.c. adenosine were competitively blocked. Theophylline also antagonized, in a competitive manner, the hypotensive effect of the i.v. administration of both compounds. Our results suggest that the chronotropic effect of purine compounds in anaesthetized animals could be brought about by a specific purinergic theophylline-sensitive mechanism and not by direct vagal activation.", 
    "9": "CYF rats were anesthetized on various days of the 4-day cycle and blood samples were collected at 5-min interals from the ovarian vein before and after i.v. administration of 5 micrograms/100 g BW of luteinizing hormone (LH). Ovarian venous outflow, blood pressure and hematocrit were continuously recorded, and from the blood samples progesterone (P) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Ovarian blood flow and P secretion showed a parallel increase on Day 1 (estrus), on Day 2, and on the afternoon of Day 4 (proestrous). LH increased ovarian blood flow each day of the cycle together with P and E2 secretion; however, no relationship was seen between the initial value of hormone secretion and the LH-induced increase of ovarian blood flow. Inhibition of hormone secretion by cycloheximide prevented the LH-induced increase of ovarian blood flow; moreover, a decrease in ovarian blood flow parallel with the diminution of hormone secretion was observed. Indomethacin pretreatment abolished the hyperemic effect of LH and partially inhibited the LH-induced increase of hormone secretion. Propranolol blocked the LH-induced increase of ovarian blood flow and blunted the effect of LH on hormone secretion. It was concluded that in LH-induced hyperemia, cAMP, prostaglandins and other vasoactive metabolites released during the process of hormone synthesis, and also a beta-adrenergic mechanism, are involved in the regulation of ovarian blood flow.", 
    "10": "Experiments were performed to reinvestigate the importance of mammary engorgement for activation of the milk-ejection reflex in the rat. Reflex milk ejection (measured by intramammary pressure recordings during a 2-h suckling test under anaesthesia) was compared in rats with engorged mammary glands (15-h separation from the pups, followed by sham-removal of milk) and in rats with drained mammary glands (15-h separation, followed by milk removal using a foster litter and exogenous oxytocin). In experiment 1, multiple small (2 mu.) doses of oxytocin were used for milk removal: these were effective in emptying the mammary glands and caused no subsequent impairment or change in sensitivity of the mammary response to oxytocin. Using this draining procedure, no significant differences were observed in either the number or relative amplitude of the milk ejections, or the occurrence of pup stretch reactions between engorged and drained rats. Similar results were seen in experiment 2, where an identical draining protocol was used, but the rats were pretreated with propranolol before the suckling test. In experiment 3, large (250 mu.) oxytocin doses were used for milk removal, as in previous studies. Again mammary draining had no effect on milk ejection in a subsequent suckling test (with propranolol pretreatment). However, the number of stretch reactions shown by the pups was significantly (P less than 0.001) reduced from 8.6 +/- 1.4/2 h to 1.9 +/- 0.6/2 h. This effect probably related to long-term impairment of the oxytocin response of the mammary glands following the draining procedure, and could not be attributed to the draining per se.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "Both, beta-receptor blocking agents and calcium-antagonists have been proven to be very effective in the treatment of idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In the vast majority of patients they lead to a significant reduction of the predominant clinical symptoms--angina and dyspnea--or even abolish them. Since beta-blockers primarily act on the contractile behaviour of the left ventricle they are especially suited in the obstructive form of the disease where they reduce outflow tract obstruction. In contrast, calcium-antagonists seem to mainly influence diastolic muscle mechanics by increasing diastolic distensibility, and thus may be indicated in the nonobstructive forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In cases with severe, life-threatening arrhythmias especially if associated with syncope, an antiarrhythmic therapy is mandatory.", 
    "12": "Young adult, male and female, normotensive Sprague-Dawley (S-D) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were injected with propranolol three times daily for 3 weeks. None of the animals manifested signs of withdrawal when the injections were terminated. Seven days later, the animals were challenged with a dose of isoproterenol which would produce massive myocardial infarction and 50-60% mortality in non-treated animals. The propranolol pretreatment caused marked tranquilizing and blood pressure lowering effects in SHR exclusively. Despite the 7-day propranolol withdrawal period, very few animals died and myocardial damage was minimal. However, blood pressure levels dropped to shock-like levels, blood CPK and LDH levels showed dynamic increases, there was marked hypertriglyceridaemia, and plasma corticosterone rose to supranormal levels. Microscopically, the hearts of the propranolol pretreated animals showed little evidence of necrosis but the SHR hearts manifested large atrial and ventricular thrombi. It is suggested that in the rat, propranolol treatment causes positive myocardial protective effects mediated through hormonal and metabolic changes and propranolol withdrawal does not lead to hypersensitivity to catecholamines. In fact, the beta-blocking effects of propranolol remain effective for some time after withdrawal.", 
    "13": "In 16 people with essential hypertension, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and relative cardiac volumes were measured at rest and during submaximal upright exercise before and after 10 mg of sublingual nifedipine using radionuclide ventriculography. In 10 patients who had had no previous therapy (BP 152/103 +/- 5/3 mmHg) nifedipine produced a fall in BP of 6/12 +/- 3/3 mmHg (SEM) and a rise in HR of 15 +/- 5 bpm (P less than 0.001). This was associated with a rise in LVEF of 0.07 +/- 0.02 (P less than 0.005) and in cardiac output of 44 +/- 9%, presumably as a result of ventricular offloading. The cardiac response to exercise given the different starting values, was unchanged by nifedipine. Thus the HR was 101 +/- 6 bpm at rest after nifedipine and on exercise rose to 124 +/- 6 bpm (P less than 0.001): stroke volume was +22 +/- 8% at rest after nifedipine and rose to +43 +/- 12% on exercise. Thus cardiac output which had increased by 44 +/- 9% after nifedipine increased by 100 +/- 10% from the initial value. In 6 patients pre-treated with atenolol (100 mg) and with similar resting BP (158/101 +/- 5/4 mmHg) there was a fall in BP of 32/15 +/- 3/2 mmHg after nifedipine which was greater than in the previously untreated group (P less than 0.01). In this group HR increased by 8 +/- 3 bpm (P less than 0.05). Following nifedipine the exercise response was similar given the different starting values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "Oral administration of a new ergoline derivative (355/1057) produced a sustained arterial hypotension in conscious SHR rats. This effect was inhibited by the centrally acting DA blockers haloperidol and pimozide and by domperidone, a DA antagonist that does not cross the blood brain barrier. On the other hand it was unaffected by alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockers or by indomethacin. Moreover, the hypertension induced by 355/1057 in pithed SHR rats was reversed to hypotension when its alpha-adrenoceptor stimulant activity was inhibited by yohimbine. In anesthetized dogs the hypotensive activity of 355/1057 was abolished by pimozide but not by propranolol. In anesthetized cats, pretreatment with haloperidol prevented both the hypotensive activity of 355/1057 and its inhibitory effect on sympathetic nerve activity. These overall data suggest that 355/1057 lowers blood pressure in different species mainly by stimulating peripheral dopamine receptors.", 
    "15": "The short-term (1 month) and long-term (6 months) safety of combination lidoflazine-propranolol therapy was investigated in an open trial of 15 patients with stable angina of effort. The possible advantages of adding lidoflazine (titrated to 360 mg daily) to patients having a therapeutic response to propranolol (80-400 mg daily) was also evaluated. Effects on non-invasive indexes of left ventricular function (echocardiography, systolic time intervals, radionuclide ventriculography) and exercise tolerance (treadmill exercise testing) were determined. There was no change in mean resting heart rate with the combination therapy, although one patient developed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 44 and had to have his propranolol dose reduced. Electrocardiographic analysis showed significant prolongation of the QTc intervals on lidoflazine-propranolol therapy compared to propranolol alone, with 3 patients having QTc interval prolongation to above .53 seconds, but there was no evidence of increased arrhythmogenesis with the combination therapy compared to propranolol alone. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume index tended to rise with combination therapy. However, lidoflazine-propranolol therapy did not produce any significant effects on resting ejection fraction determined by M-mode echocardiography or by radionuclide ventriculography. Radionuclide ventriculography determined peak exercise ejection fractions were also not significantly changed with combination therapy compared to propranolol alone. There were only small, insignificant improvements in exercise tolerance with the lidoflazine-propranolol combination treatment compared to propranolol alone. It is concluded that lidoflazine-propranolol combination therapy is generally safe but has the potential of causing serious adverse effects in certain patients, i.e. those with sick sinus disease, prolonged QTc intervals, and severe baseline left ventricular dysfunction, and that caution must be exercised in its use. Furthermore, it would appear that combination therapy provides only slight, if any, improvements in exercise tolerance in patients with chronic stable angina having a therapeutic response to oral propranolol.", 
    "16": "Sixty four hypertensive patients working in railway and highway traffic security (engine operators, drivers, switchmen, etc.) were studied clinically and paraclinically and were also submitted to psychologic tests since the characteristics of their work requires a normal psychophysical state. The patients investigated, mostly males (93%), mean age 45.2 years, had essential arterial hypertension (AH) stages I (36 patients) and II (28 patients). After 3-4 days of low salt diet, therapy with propranolol (8 to 360 mg/day) and diuretics was started in most of the patients. In 8 patients with AH stage II, hydralazine (50-100 mg/days) was added to the treatment. The psychologic tests used were: the pencil-paper test \"Labyrinth\", \"Barrage\" and \"A.D. Praga\" and a motor test \"Piorkowsky\" used 2 times, i.e., before and after treatment. After 15 days of treatment the blood pressure values decreased: systolic from a mean value of 155 +/- 25 mmHg to 136 +/- 81 mmHg; diastolic from 102 + 18 mmHg to 84 +/- 11 mmHg. The marks for the psychologic test were: very poor, poor, medium, good, very good. The post-therapeutic changes obtained were noted in percentages. Improvements obtained: for the \"Praga\" test in 54% of the patients, for the \"Barrage\" in 44% of the patients and for the \"Labyrinth\" in 66% of the patients. Improvements for the first \"Piorkowsky\" test (slow rate stimuli) were obtained in 54% of the patients and for the second (faster rate stimuli) in 69%. No decrease of psychologic performance was observed in any of the patients. Therefore the psychologic tests used may contribute to the follow-up of the effectiveness and of the side effects of modern hypotensive therapy especially in patients working in traffic security in whom the psychophysical state should be at its best.", 
    "17": "The effect of an 8-week monotherapy with propranolol and pratsiol on plasma lipid levels and apo-Al and apo-B, apoproteins of high- and low-density lipoproteins (HDLP, LDLP) was studied in 20 patients with second-stage essential hypertension. Propranolol caused no significant changes in plasma lipid spectrum, however it produced a significant rise in apo-Al levels and reduced the cholesterol load index per weight unit of apo-Al in HDLP particles. Pratsiol treatment caused a significant reduction in plasma triglycerides, cholesterol of very-low-density lipoproteins, the cholesterol atherogenic coefficient and the apo-B/apo-Al ratio, and raised the level of HDLP cholesterol. The findings suggest that plasma lipoprotein effects should be taken into account in the choice of hypotensive agents.", 
    "18": "Paired bicycle ergometry was used in 24 anginal patients to compare the efficiency of 10-20 mg isosorbide dinitrate, 20-30 mg corinfar and 40-80 mg propranolol. Isosorbide dinitrate showed maximum efficiency in half of the patients, corinfar in 1/4, propranolol in 1/6. Isosorbide dinitrate produced an effect with the very first dose more frequently, as compared to other drugs. Heart rate patterns at rest and under the action of corinfar and isosorbide dinitrate varied in different individuals and were related to the time of onset of an exercise-induced anginal attack.", 
    "19": "A combination of isosorbide dinitrate (40-120 mg daily) and propranolol (80-160 mg) was administered to 146 patients during the early hours of myocardial infarction. The therapeutic effect was assessed for 10 days and compared to the effect observed in a control group of 70 patients selected at random. The combination used was shown to relieve the pain syndrome and extrasystolic arrhythmia during the early days of the disease. The occurrence of signs of heart failure was twice as low during the observation period, as compared to the control group. The treatment evoked typical hemodynamic changes: rhythm deceleration (by an average 7%), a fall in systemic arterial blood pressure (by 19%) and in \"double product\" (by 25%), a moderate reduction of cardiac output (by 15%) coupled with a marked drop in left-ventricular filling pressure (by 25%). The spread of infarcted area in the first days after the attack, as evidenced by serial electrocardiotopograms and the activity of serum CPK and its MB fraction, was recorded in 13.9% of the treated patients and in 44% of the controls (p less than 0.001).", 
    "20": "Blood pressure readings obtained by the physician in his office and ambulatory blood pressures recorded with the semi-automatic Remler device, were compared during a controlled antihypertensive drug trial. Either timolol or methyldopa was administered in in double-blind fashion to 30 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. All exhibited a diastolic office blood pressure greater than 95 mmHg at the end of a four-week placebo period. All patients then received a combination of hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/day) and amiloride (2.5 mg/day). After four weeks of diuretic therapy, timolol (10 mg/day, n = 14) or methyldopa (250 mg/day, n = 16) were added randomly for six weeks. The dose of all antihypertensive agents was doubled after two weeks of therapy with diuretics combined with timolol (n = 7) or methyldopa (n = 16) because of the persistence of diastolic blood pressure levels greater than 90 mmHg at the office. When assessed in the office, the antihypertensive effect of timolol and methyldopa was similar. During ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, however, pressure levels were lower in the patients given timolol (P less than 0.05 for the diastolic). With both regimens, the blood pressure response measured outside the clinic during usual daily activities could not be predicted from that observed with office blood pressure readings. Furthermore the magnitude of the drug induced blood pressure decrease was more reproducible in time when determined outside the clinic. These data suggest that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is more precise in evaluating the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy than office blood pressure measurement.", 
    "21": "After certain tear proteins had been found to be markers of duct cell activity in the rabbit lacrimal gland, different secretagogues were tested to increase volume and protein secretion. Carbamyl-choline and the peptides eledoisin and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) stimulated volume flux as well as secretion of the marker proteins indicating duct cell activation. Beta-adrenergic stimulation also increased secretion of a further tear protein. This might indicate that water is secreted by the duct cells. These are stimulated by the secretagogues mentioned above. Beta-adrenergic stimulation might in addition activate the acinar cell system.", 
    "22": "In the chick long term memory is known suddenly to become more resistant to disturbance 25 minutes after training. This was investigated using two bead pecking tasks: training involved either presentation of an ill-tasting bead (causing inhibition of spontaneous pecking) or habituation by prolonged presentation. Retention tests revealed two brief periods of improved recall, centred at 25 and at 30-32 minutes after learning. The first appeared to be associated with systems fed by the left eye and the second with right eye systems. In a final experiment memory formation in right or left hemisphere was directly disturbed by intracranial injection of the amnesic beta-antagonist sotalol. The first (and perhaps also second) period of improved recall was associated with interaction between the hemispheres. Right- and left-eyed birds differed markedly, both in the character of such interaction and in the outcome of learning.", 
    "23": "Administration iv of 50 mg X kg-1 acetazolamide (A) and 3 mg X kg-1 timolol (T) causes the formation of cerebrospinal fluid (f-CSF) to be reduced to 43.7% of the control rate compared with a reduction to 82.5% of control by T alone and to 52.6% of control by A alone. The effect of combined drugs is the same when A is combined with T initially, when A is added to T after studying T alone, or when T is added to A after studying A alone. In contrast, in rats f-CSF is not influenced by T, either alone or when in combination with A. The rate in rats is reduced to 55% of control by treatments with A or A and T. Decrease in formation of cerebrospinal fluid by A occurs through inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, but the means whereby T (a known blocker of beta-adrenergic receptors) causes a reduction in f-CSF is not established; it is known that it does not inhibit carbonic anhydrase. Control of f-CSF by the sympathetic nervous system is discussed.", 
    "24": "Pig isolated renal arteries contract in response to addition of noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine, histamine, angiotensin II, vasopressin and carbachol, whereas cholecystokinin, adenosine, and inosine produce relaxation. Transmural stimulation of the tissue causes contraction of circular muscle in the arterial wall which produces apparent elongation of the vessel. The effects of transmural stimulation are partially blocked by prazosin and potentiated by propranolol, indicating that noradrenaline acts through both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. Guanethidine (10(-5) M) reduces the size of responses to transmural stimulation in the presence of both prazosin (10(-6) M) and propranolol (10(-7) M). Both saralasin (10(-7) M), and desensitization of angiotensin II receptors by prolonged contact with the peptide, produced a reduction in response to transmural stimulation, indicating that angiotensin II may be involved in neurotransmission. This effect was blocked by tetrodotoxin. Transmural stimulation produces relaxation of renal arteries in the presence of maximal doses of saralasin, prazosin, and propranolol, suggesting that a third unidentified substance is also released from autonomic nerves.", 
    "25": "The pharmacokinetics of acebutolol and its major metabolite, diacetolol, following a single 400 mg oral dose, were investigated in patients with liver disease. No significant differences were found in any of the parameters measured.", 
    "26": "alpha 1-Acid glycoprotein (AAG) exists in a variety of sialylated states which can be influenced by certain disease states. The purpose of the present study was to establish the effect of the sialylation state of AAG on the binding of a model cationic drug (propranolol). Extensive in vitro enzymatic desialylation of isolated human AAG was achieved utilizing neuraminidase bonded to agarose beads. Propranolol binding to native and desialylated AAG was determined by equilibrium dialysis. Desialylated AAG exhibited a modest increase in propranolol free fraction due to a decrease in the affinity constant (Ka) compared to untreated AAG (3.3 X 10(5) M-1 versus 4.0 X 10(5) M-1, respectively). A modest 15% increase was predicted for the free fraction of propranolol in serum containing desialylated AAG at therapeutic propranolol concentrations (less than 0.1 microgram/ml). Therefore, the clinical significance of desialylated AAG appears to be minor with respect to propranolol binding.", 
    "27": "The effect of direct impact on the right ventricle was investigated in an anesthetized open-chest canine preparation. At each of five impact sites, direct local loading produced immediate ventricular asystole followed by varying degrees of AV conduction block, lasting 70 +/- 35 seconds. Sinus rhythm temporarily resumed in most cases for 30 +/- 25 seconds before ventricular tachycardia abruptly intervened for 150 +/- 70 seconds. Recovery to sinus rhythm usually followed the ventricular tachycardia. Impact over the ventricular aspect supplied by the right coronary artery above the conduction bundle branches caused a longer period of asystole than impact over other sites. The duration of the delayed tachyarrhythmia was independent of impact site. Denervation of the heart did not influence the conduction block or the tachyarrhythmia. Intravenous injection of propranolol (1.6 mg/kg) did not affect the immediate conduction block but prevented the ventricular tachycardia.", 
    "28": "The time-course of beta blockade induced by two formulations of propranolol was compared to their plasma concentration-time curves. Graded infusions of isoproterenol were used to assess the degree of beta blockade at different times after oral administration of 80 mg of propranolol to 11 healthy volunteers. The time-course of drug effect was measured as the decline of the systolic pressor dose 20 (SPD 20) and the chronotropic dose 20 (CD 20). Variability of plasma propranolol concentration was small, varying within subjects from 27% to 36% and between subjects from 19% to 28% at the various sampling times. Pharmacodynamic effects showed a similar reproducibility: intra-individual variation was 15% to 28% for CD 20 and 17% to 32% for SPD 20; interindividual variation was 10% to 24% for CD 20 and 13% to 23% for SPD 20. Pooling of the data of all subjects indicated a parallel decline of drug concentration and effect. However, three of the 11 subjects showed drug effects declining at a faster rate than drug levels. This dissociation between serum concentrations and effects points out the clinical relevance of complementing kinetic studies of propranolol with pharmacodynamic studies. The good reproducibility within subjects and the small interindividual variation suggests that isoproterenol dose-response curves may be a useful tool for such studies.", 
    "29": "Addition of the opioid peptides, [Leu]enkephalin and [Met]enkephalin, to isolated hepatocytes was shown to produce a stimulation of glycogenolysis comparable with that observed in the presence of maximal concentrations of glucagon, adrenaline or angiotensin. This stimulation was demonstrated to be the result of an activation of phosphorylase by a rapid Ca2+-dependent mechanism and was not decreased by the presence or either alpha- or beta-adrenergic antagonists, although it was dependent on the presence of the N-terminal tyrosine residue in the enkephalin molecule. It is suggested that this may be further evidence for specific opioid receptors in the liver. Addition of [Leu]enkephalin also inhibited lactate formation, indicating that the opioid peptides exert a concerted effect on hepatic carbohydrate metabolism to enhance glucose output. The transient nature of the effect of the enkephalins was shown to be the result of a rapid breakdown of the peptides in the incubation as a result of aminopeptidase activity, the initial product being the inactive des-tyrosine derivative.", 
    "30": "To assess the role of peripheral sympathetic nerves in the regulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) release rats subjected to bilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy (SCGx) 8-24 h earlier were used. SCGx did not result in significant changes of basal serum calcium (Ca) or immunoreactive PTH (iPTH) levels. The i.p. administration of EDTA every 30 min for up to 3 h brought about an impending decrease of serum Ca levels in both sham-operated and SCGx rats when assessed 23 h after surgery. The extent of hypocalcemia was significantly larger in the SCGx group. In sham-operated controls serum iPTH increased by 32-145%, 1-3 h after beginning EDTA treatment whereas such increases were considerably lower or absent in SCGx rats. In 3 out of 7 SCGx animals that survived to a double EDTA dose, iPTH increased to levels indistinguishable from controls. When SCGx rats subjected to surgery 23 h earlier and receiving d-1-propranolol (5 mg/kg) or phentolamine (10 mg/kg) 4 h and 30 min earlier were submitted to iterative EDTA injection serum iPTH increased, whereas no changes were detected in SCGx rats treated with vehicle and subjected to the same EDTA treatment. These data indicate that (1) SCGx does not affect basal release of iPTH or serum Ca concentration; (2) 23-26 h after SCGx there is a significant impairment of homeostatic iPTH responses to low Ca levels which can be overcome by suitable Ca stimulus; (3) circulating catecholamines may affect denervated parathyroid cells, as revealed by the changes in serum iPTH and Ca elicited by alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor-blocker treatment of SCGx rats.", 
    "31": "We studied the cardiovascular effects of phasic increases in intrathoracic pressure (ITP) by high-frequency jet ventilation in an acute pentobarbital-anesthetized intact canine model both before and after the induction of acute ventricular failure by large doses of propranolol. Chest and abdominal pneumatic binders were used to further increase ITP. Respiratory frequency, percent inspiratory time, mean ITP, and swings in ITP throughout the respiratory cycle were independently varied at a constant-circulating blood volume. We found that pertubations in mean ITP induced by ventilator adjustments accounted for all observable steady-state hemodynamic changes independent of respiratory frequency, inspiratory time, or phasic respiratory swings in ITP. Changes in ITP were associated with reciprocal changes in both intrathoracic vascular pressures (P less than 0.01) and blood volume (P less than 0.01). When cardiac function was normal, left ventricular (LV) stroke volume decreased, whereas in acute ventricular failure, LV stroke volume increased in response to increasing ITP when apneic LV filling pressure was high (greater than or equal to 17 Torr) and did not change if apneic LV filling pressure was low (less than or equal to 12 Torr). However, in all animals in acute ventricular failure, LV stroke work increased with increasing ITP. Our study demonstrates that the improved cardiac function seen with increasing ITP in acute ventricular failure is dependent upon adequate LV filling and decreased LV afterload in a manner analogous to that seen with arterial vasodilator therapy in heart failure.", 
    "32": "In 10 men with stable exertional angina, the changes in exercise capacity, hemodynamics, and left ventricular (LV) function were measured after 20 mg sublingual nifedipine (N) and again after adding 100 mg oral metoprolol (M). Nifedipine alone did not significantly improve exercise workloads (+18%) and duration (+21%), but the addition of metoprolol increased both parameters by a further 37 and 32%, respectively (both p less than 0.005 vs. N). After nifedipine the onset of angina was slightly delayed (5.14 +/- 2.41 min placebo (P), 6.00 +/- 2.31 min N, p less than 0.1) and occurred at higher workloads (36 +/- 17 W P, 43 +/- 8 W N, p less than 0.1). After the addition of metoprolol, the onset of angina was delayed substantially more (9.57 +/- 2.22 min, p less than 0.001 vs. P and N) and occurred at much higher workloads (62 +/- 20 W, p less than 0.001 vs. P and N). At rest (R) and during exercise (E), nifedipine decreased systemic vascular resistance (-36% R, -27% E, both p less than 0.001) and mean arterial pressure (-18% R, -21% E, both p less than 0.001), and increased heart rate (+15% R, +11% E, both p less than 0.001), Pulmonary artery wedge pressure on exercise increased less (22 +/- 7 mmHg P, 13 +/- 5 mmHg N, p less than 0.001). After adding metoprolol, the major change was a reduced heart rate (-25% vs. N at R and E, both p less than 0.001), and arterial pressure was unaltered. Pulmonary artery wedge pressure on exercise increased to 18 +/- 5 mmHg (p less than 0.05 vs. N). Exercise LV ejection fraction and volume did not change significantly after adding metoprolol despite marked improvement in angina. In this acute exercise study in patients with stable exertional angina, metoprolol added to nifedipine markedly improved exercise capacity by preventing the increase in heart rate seen with nifedipine. In our patients with relatively normal LV function at rest, the combination was safe and produced no deleterious effects on LV function.", 
    "33": "Portal vein pressure was measured before and after a week of oral propranolol hydrochloride therapy in 27 patients with alcoholic liver disease. Mean net portal pressure fell (14.5 +/- 3.3 to 12.5 +/- 4.5 mm Hg), but there was wide variation in individual response to the drug. Simultaneous transhepatic portal vein pressure and wedged hepatic vein pressure were similar before and one hour after a single oral dose of 40 mg of propranolol hydrochloride in six additional patients. Arterial, portal, and hepatic vein oxygen content did not change significantly. Propranolol hydrochloride appears not to dissociate portal and wedged hepatic vein pressure or to impair liver oxygenation. Because of variability of response, the portal hypotensive effect of propranolol should be documented before beginning therapy with the drug.", 
    "34": "To determine whether a reflex increase of sympathetic nervous system activity contributes to maintenance of blood pressure during acute beta-adrenergic blockade, we measured plasma norepinephrine levels and norepinephrine kinetics during propranolol administration. During a 90-min infusion of propranolol (10 mg iv + 80 micrograms/min) in 12 normal subjects, heart rate fell from 56 +/- 2 to 49 +/- 2 (SE) beats/min (P less than 0.001), but there was no fall in mean arterial blood pressure (84 +/- 3 mmHg before and 86 +/- 3 mmHg after propranolol). Arterial plasma norepinephrine levels rose from 183 +/- 20 to 250 +/- 29 pg/ml during propranolol (P less than 0.001), suggesting increased sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone. However, isotope dilution studies using tritiated norepinephrine infusion showed that arterial plasma levels of tritiated norepinephrine rose from 743 +/- 78 to 1,002 +/- 101 dpm/ml during propranolol (P less than 0.001), indicating a reduction in the rate of norepinephrine clearance from plasma. The calculated fall in clearance from 1.90 +/- 0.13 to 1.42 +/- 0.11 1/min (P less than 0.001) entirely accounted for the rise in plasma norepinephrine, since the calculated rate of norepinephrine spillover into plasma remained at the base-line level of 340 +/- 40 ng/min during propranolol. In control studies on four subjects, arterial plasma norepinephrine levels and norepinephrine kinetics did not change from base line during the control period. We conclude that maintenance of blood pressure during propranolol infusion is not due to a reflex generalized increase of sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone.", 
    "35": "Twenty-one patients were studied to investigate whether cardiac acceleration above control values occurred after cessation of enhanced vagal tone (postvagal tachycardia), and to determine the effects of selective autonomic blockade on postvagal tachycardia. Patients had neither sinus arrhythmia nor sinus nodal dysfunction. Enhanced vagal tone was induced by neck suction using a lead neck collar connected to a vacuum source. For each patient intracollar negative pressures of 50 to 60 mm Hg were induced for 2 seconds on 10 occasions. For all patients, sinus cycle length increased from 821 +/- 99 to 1,067 +/- 241 ms (p less than 0.001) during neck suction and decreased to 760 +/- 96 ms after termination of neck suction, a value significantly (p less than 0.001) less than control. Five of 16 patients had no postvagal tachycardia. Maximal shortening of sinus cycle length occurred 3 to 8 complexes after cessation of neck suction. Neck suction was induced in 7 patients before and during propranolol administration, 0.15 mg/kg intravenously, and the degree of postvagal tachycardia was unchanged. Atropine, 0.03 mg/kg intravenously, prevented neck suction-induced sinus slowing and acceleration in 3 of 3 patients. We conclude that postvagal tachycardia occurs and is not mediated through beta-adrenergic activity, but is inhibited by muscarinic blockade.", 
    "36": "Renal excretory and circulatory responses to nicotine were investigated in anesthetized dogs under three sets of conditions: (a) infusion of nicotine into the left renal artery (ia) at a dose of 0.5 microgram X min-1 X kg body wt-1 X 15 min; (b) ia nicotine after 1.0 mg/kg ia propranolol; and (c) ia nicotine after bilateral adrenalectomy. Measured and calculated left and right renal excretory variables included sodium, potassium, and chloride excretion rates (UNaV, UKV, and UClV, respectively), total solute excretion (UOsV), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), fractional sodium excretion (FENa), and urine flow rate. Systemic arterial pressure and left renal artery blood flow (RBF) were also measured. In seven intact dogs administered nicotine alone, there were significant increases in UNaV, UClV, UOsV, GFR, and urine flow rates from both kidneys. However, nicotine did not significantly affect UKV, FENa, arterial pressure, or RBF. The lack of circulatory effects of nicotine was also observed after either propranolol or adrenalectomy. However, when nicotine was administered after propranolol, the drug evoked significant decreases in UOsV, UNaV, UClV, and GFR, compared with prenicotine values. When nicotine was administered after bilateral adrenalectomy, the drug evoked decreases in the excretory parameters similar to those observed after propranolol. These findings seem to support several inferences: (a) nicotine stimulates renal excretory functions-the alkaloid is saluretic and diuretic; (b) the action of nicotine on the kidney is mediated mainly by the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla; (c) catecholamines released by nicotine act mainly on beta-adrenergic receptors; and (d) the saluresis prompted by the release of catecholamines in response to nicotine is due to a subsequent increase in GFR.", 
    "37": "Tryptamine and serotonin (5-HT) are relatively potent contractile agonists in the rat fundus, a tissue in which contraction to 5-HT is not mediated by interaction with 5-HT1 or 5-HT2 receptors. The identification of [3H]tryptamine binding sites in the brain and fundus that show high affinity for certain beta-carbolines raised the possibility that 5-HT and tryptamine may be interacting with a similar receptor that is best described as a tryptaminergic receptor in the fundus. The affinity of five 5-HT receptor antagonists, ketanserin, metergoline, 1-(1-naphthyl)piperazine, LY154930 and LY175041 was similar when 5-HT or tryptamine was the agonist, indicating that 5-HT and tryptamine are interacting with the same receptor in the fundus. Furthermore, maximum contractile response to both 5-HT and tryptamine was reduced to the same extent by the calcium channel blocker, diltiazem, and by the calmodulin inhibitor, trifluoperazine. Inasmuch as diltiazem and trifluoperazine did not similarly inhibit contraction to agents interacting with other receptors (i.e., carbamylcholine), these data are consistent with the contention that 5-HT and tryptamine are interacting with the same receptor in the fundus. Consistent with this conclusion is the observation that affinity of the beta-carbolines, harmaline and harmine was also similar when tryptamine or 5-HT was used as the agonist. However, affinity of the beta-carbolines for the tryptamine/5-HT receptor in the fundus was dramatically lower than reported for [3H]tryptamine binding sites in brain membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "The effect of propranolol on systemic and hepatic hemodynamics was studied in patients with cirrhosis. One hour after 40 mg propranolol by mouth as well as during continuous oral dosing at doses that reduced heart rate 25%, cardiac output and the hepatic venous pressure gradient fell significantly, whereas arterial pressure and hepatic blood flow did not change significantly. In six patients with cirrhosis and surgical end-to-side portacaval shunts, cardiac output and the hepatic venous pressure gradient also decreased 15 minutes after intravenous propranolol (5 mg), whereas hepatic blood flow did not change significantly. In the patients with surgical shunts, systemic vascular resistance rose significantly but hepatic arterial vascular resistance fell. Our data show that in patients with cirrhosis, propranolol induces an increase in the fraction of cardiac output reaching the liver.", 
    "39": "Effects of nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, propranolol and mannitol on the size of infarcted and peri-infarction areas were examined in 276 patients with acute left-ventricular anterior myocardial infarction. The study involved an assessment of electrocardiograms from 35 precordial leads, and the measurement of central venous blood pressure, hemodynamic parameters, serum enzymes, acid-base state and, in some patients, the pressure inside the pulmonary artery, right and left cavities of the heart and the aorta, left-ventricular kinetocardiography, etc. All the drugs examined were shown to have a favourable effect on the size of the peri-infarction area and reduce the extent of myocardial infarction. Indications for each of the drugs have been worked out on a differential basis. A detailed analysis of ECG patterns from multiple chest leads under the action of nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, propranolol and mannitol is presented.", 
    "40": "The object of this study was to confirm the electrophysiological effects of sotalol, a betablocker which increases the duration of the action potentials of myocardial cells, and to investigate the relationship of these effects with the doses used and plasma concentrations (PC) of the drug. 13 patients (23 to 72 years) were divided into 3 groups: Group 1 (n = 5): 0.6 mg/kg; Group 2 (n = 4): 1.2 mg/kg; and Group 3 (n = 5): 1.8 mg/kg. Measurements were performed before and 35 minutes after starting a 15 minute intravenous infusion of sotalol. At all doses, sotalol decreased the heart rate (HR), increased the corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT), prolonged the effective refractory periods (ERPA) and functional refractory periods (FRPA) of the right atrium. Atrioventricular conduction was depressed; prolongation of AH at an imposed rate of 100/min, prolongation of the nodal refractory periods (ERPN and FRPN), and an earlier Wenckebach point. The corrected QT interval (QTc) and ventricular refractory period (ERPV) increased. The QRS complexes and HV intervals were unchanged. Increases of CSNRT, AH, ERPN, FRPN, QTc, and ERPV were observed after the first dose (Group 1). At the dose of 1.8 mg/kg (Group 3) all parameters were modified (except the QRS and HV). All patients increased their ERPV by more than 20 p. 100. The parameters which illustrated the dose-effect relationship were the HR, ERPA, FRPN, and CSNRT. The PC of sotalol measured 60 minutes after starting the infusion were 0.58 +/- 0.23 microgram/ml (Group 1), 0.78 +/- 0.32 microgram/ml (Group 2) and 1.73 +/- 0.43 microgram/ml (Group 3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "In the frog heart isolated sinus node with intact extracardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways or intracardiac nerves, the intracellular pacemaker APs and extracellular nervous activity of the parasympathetic postganglionic intracardiac pathways were recorded. Two major sympathetic-parasympathetic interaction patterns were revealed: the antagonistic and the augmentative ones. In initial deep bradycardia, sympathetic stimulation diminished the parasympathetic inhibition, whereas in initial parasympathetic tachycardia, sympathetic stimulation augmented these parasympathetic effects. The recording of the intracellular pacemaker AP showed the effect of a complicated interaction between the sympathetic and parasympathetic transmitters on the heart pacemaker. Parasympathetic postganglionic nervous activity changed in two ways: there was either an attenuation during intense sympathetic stimulation or an augmentation during a weak sympathetic stimulation. Relative significance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems in the heart rate control and possible mechanisms of the two patterns of sympathetic-parasympathetic interactions, are discussed.", 
    "42": "It has been hypothesized that catecholamine (CA) accumulation in the axons of degenerating neurons may represent areas of functional neurotransmitter, and may be producing some of the consummatory and locomotory deficits which occur after central CA-depleting lesions. To test this hypothesis further, haloperidol (0.5 microliter of a 7 nM sol.), propranolol (0.5 microliter of a 175 nM sol.) or isotonic saline (0.5 microliter) were injected 1.5 h, 24 h and 48 h after the injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; 2 microliter of 8 micrograms/microliters) into the lateral hypothalamus (LH) of Sprague-Dawley rats to determine if the hypothermia, motor impairment and consummatory deficits could be reversed. Although haloperidol injection significantly enhanced the hypothermia seen 1.5 h after 6-OHDA injection, open field performance and consummatory responses were significantly improved after haloperidol was injected into the LH where accumulation is known to occur. Three consecutive days of intracerebral haloperidol treatment produced a recovery of body weight regulation lasting for 6 days. Treatment with propranolol enhanced open field performance 1 day after 6-OHDA injection but failed to enhance recovery of consummatory behaviour and body weight control. These results suggest that CA released from areas of accumulation act on adjacent CA receptors to participate in the production of behavioural deficits previously attributed only to the loss of functional neurotransmitter in terminal fields in the forebrain.", 
    "43": "The London School of Hygiene Cardiovascular Questionnaire (Rose Questionnaire) was compared with physician opinion in assessment of angina pectoris in the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, a long-term (June 1978-October 1981), multicenter study of 3,837 post-myocardial infarction patients, half of whom were treated with propranolol and half with placebo. At baseline, about three times as many patients were thought to have angina by the physician as were diagnosed by the Questionnaire (36.1% vs. 11.5%). Over the average 25-month follow-up period, angina was identified by the physician 50% more often than by the Questionnaire (60.3% vs. 38.6%). The results for each treatment group (propranolol or placebo) were very similar to these overall results. Associations between diagnosis of angina and other patient characteristics were similar for the two measures at baseline. Although the physician diagnosis of angina identified more patients who suffered a subsequent fatal or nonfatal event than did the Questionnaire, it also diagnosed more angina patients who did not have an event. Thus, each of the measures of angina predicted total mortality and coronary heart disease mortality to similar extents (comparable relative risks), even after adjustment for covariates. Neither measure was significantly predictive of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction. One measure is not clearly superior to the other in this population. Other factors, such as cost and type of personnel available to conduct the study, may determine which measure is preferred.", 
    "44": "In a 12-week double-blind randomised study the efficacy of atenolol and a new longer-acting formulation of trimazosin were compared when given once daily in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Two parallel groups, each consisting of 18 patients, were studied. At randomisation the two groups were well matched for age and sex distribution. They were also well matched for blood pressure, pulse rate and body weight; these latter measurements were recorded at regular intervals during the 12 weeks of study. Atenolol produced substantial reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and in heart rate, during 12 weeks of treatment. This therapeutic effect was maintained until the next dose after 24 hours. Trimazosin, by comparison, failed to reduce either systolic or diastolic pressure, or to alter heart rate. Side effects were minor with both agents and compliance with treatment was good. Atenolol caused significant elevation of plasma concentration of triglyceride, with reduction in high density lipoprotein concentration when compared with trimazosin. In conclusion, atenolol was confirmed as an effective agent for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. By comparison trimazosin in the longer-acting formulation was ineffective in this study. However, trimazosin may still find a place in treatment if used at higher dose.", 
    "45": "The effects of propranolol on lipid metabolism were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Male SHR and corresponding Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) were used at 5 weeks of age. The SHR were given 10 mg/kg/day of dl-propranolol . HCl by gavage for 10 weeks. Body weight gain in untreated SHR and propranolol-treated SHR (SHR-P) groups were low, as compared with those of the WKY group. Total cholesterol, phospholipid and total lipid of the serum and liver in the SHR-P group were higher than in the SHR group. In the early weeks of treatment, serum triglyceride and non-esterified fatty acid levels in the SHR-P group were slightly lower than those in the SHR group. Aortic lipid levels in the SHR-P group were lower than those in the SHR group. During the later weeks of treatment, blood glucose level in the SHR-P group was higher than in the SHR group. The serum immunoreactive insulin value in the SHR-P group was slightly lower than in the SHR group. These results may suggest that propranolol inhibits hormone-sensitive lipase activity in the early weeks of treatment and influences cholesterol biosynthesis and/or catabolism.", 
    "46": "We investigated the effects of Defibrotide (D), a natural polydeoxyribonucleotide, on acute myocardial ischemia (AMI) in anesthetized cats. A permanent ligature was placed around the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) 12-14 mm from its origin. Ventricular fibrillation and death were exceptional and when they occurred the cats were not included in the evaluation. Pretreatment of cats with D, 32 mg Kg-1 h-1, i.v. infusion, maintained throughout the 5 h occlusion period, reduced AMI-ST segment increases and increased the diminished pressure-rate index (PRI). AMI-induced changes in lactate, ATP and CPK in ischemic tissue were prevented by D. PGI2 gave the same results as D. Atenolol prevented the loss of myocardial CPK, but had no favourable effects on lactate and ATP in ischemic tissue. The beneficial effects of D in AMI reported here could be partly attributed to its ability to enhance PGI2 release from vascular walls; D might also relieve ischemia by improvement of local tissue oxygenation, energy supplies and platelet function by its ability to deaggregate platelet clumps.", 
    "47": "The effects of atenolol (50 mg once daily) on serum beta 2-microglobulin levels in 11 hypertensive diabetic patients uncomplicated by renal dysfunction were studied. Atenolol significantly decreased serum beta 2-microglobulin levels (micrograms/mL) at four weeks (1.5 +/- 0.13) and at eight weeks (1.4 +/- 0.09) from pretreatment level (1.8 +/- 0.17) (P less than 0.05, respectively), along with statistically significant antihypertensive effects. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1C levels, and body weight remained unchanged. The results suggest that atenolol provides a favorable effect on renal function in hypertensive diabetic patients uncomplicated by renal dysfunction.", 
    "48": "The comparative efficacy and safety of oxyfedrine and propranolol in the management of angina pectoris was evaluated in a double-blind randomized cross-over study. Out of 21 patients registered, 14 completed the study. Three patients dropped out due to poor response and 4 were lost to follow up. Both the drugs i.e. oxyfedrine (8-24 mg three times a day) and propranolol (40-80 mg three times a day) produced a significant reduction in the incidence of anginal attacks and the consumption of nitroglycerine tablets. Propranolol produced a better response than oxyfedrine although the difference was not significant. This may be due to the small sample size. No change in heart rate and rate-pressure product was observed with oxyfedrine, in contrast to that seen with propranolol. The beneficial effect of treatment on exercise tolerance and ST-segment depression was more marked with propranolol. No significant change in laboratory parameters was observed with either drug.", 
    "49": "In a double-blind cross-over study the effects of propranolol (80 mg) and of lorazepam (1 or 2.5 mg) were assessed in normal student volunteers using a number of performance tests and mood-rating and bodily symptom questionnaires. Drug effects on experimentally-induced anxiety were also studied. The high dose of lorazepam impaired performance in digit-symbol substitution, symbol copying and verbal learning tests, and increased subjects' ratings of dizziness. Both lorazepam and propranolol increased simple reaction time. Lorazepam but not propranolol increased ratings of sedation. Although the stressor increased subjects' ratings of anxiety, neither drug altered anxiety ratings. Propranolol decreased and lorazepam increased subjects' pulse. These changes were not reflected in subjects' self-ratings - lorazepam caused a reduction in ratings of palpitations. The results suggest that if administered acutely, neither drug is beneficial in the treatment of short-term anxiety associated with intellectual stress.", 
    "50": "To examine the importance of acute frusemide-induced renin release in the production of the acute peripheral venous and arterial responses to frusemide in man, the effects of two drugs, previously described as inhibitors of acute frusemide-induced renin release, propranolol and digoxin, were examined. Propranolol abolished the acute increases in venous capacitance and blood pressure and attenuated the increases in forearm vascular resistance produced by frusemide. The acute increases in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentrations were also abolished. Pre-treatment with digoxin had no effect on the acute peripheral vascular responses to frusemide and failed to inhibit the acute increases in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone produced by frusemide. The study provides further evidence of a relationship between acute frusemide-induced renin release and the acute peripheral vascular effects of frusemide in man.", 
    "51": "One hundred and six patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted to hospital within four hours after the onset of symptoms were randomised to treatment with intravenous timolol (54 patients) or placebo (52 patients). Serum potassium concentrations were estimated at frequent intervals during the first 24 hours of admission. Patients in both treatment groups, who did not receive subsequent diuretic treatment, had a transient rise in serum potassium concentration, which was maximal after four hours. This rise was abolished by diuretic treatment in the placebo group but not in the timolol group, in which there was a pronounced and prolonged rise in serum potassium concentration. The change in serum potassium concentration in the first four hours after admission correlated with cumulative creatine kinase release in the placebo group, but not in the timolol group. Hypokalaemia (serum potassium concentration less than or equal to 3.5 mmol/l) occurred in 15 (28.8%) patients in the placebo group and in seven (13%) in the timolol group and was independent of infarct size. The frequency of hyperkalaemia was not increased in the timolol group. By increasing the serum potassium concentration and preventing hypokalaemia, the use of intravenous timolol early in acute myocardial infarction may have important clinical effects in addition to reducing infarct size.", 
    "52": "Earlier studies have demonstrated the inhibitory nature of epinephrine and norepinephrine on pancreatic insulin release. The present study reports their effect on beta-cell IRI release in an isolated islet system. Results show that epinephrine and norepinephrine inhibit islet-IRI release at the 100-10 microM level. The alpha adrenergic blocker phentolamine (100 microM) but not the beta adrenergic blocker propranolol (100 microM) can reverse this catecholamine induced inhibition of islet-IRI release. This clearly suggests that epinephrine and norepinephrine inhibit insulin release via alpha-adrenergic pathway.", 
    "53": "The effects of intracerebroventricular administration of bombesin on mean arterial pressure and heart rate were studied in conscious, freely moving rats. Injection of bombesin produced dose-dependent elevations of mean arterial pressure and reductions of heart rate. These effects were not caused by leakage of bombesin into the peripheral circulation. Adrenalectomy abolished the pressor action of bombesin but did not alter bombesin-induced bradycardia. Systemic phentolamine pretreatment prevented bombesin-induced changes of mean arterial pressure, whereas rats treated intravenously with captopril or a vasopressin antagonist still exhibited pressor responses to bombesin administration. Bombesin-induced bradycardia was partially antagonized by intravenous atropine methyl nitrate administration, whereas systemic injections of propranolol did not modify this response. It is concluded that bombesin acts within the central nervous system to elevate mean arterial pressure through an adrenal-dependent mechanism involving alpha-adrenergic receptors and to reduce heart rate through an adrenal-independent mechanism involving, at least in part, cardiac parasympathetic nervous activation.", 
    "54": "Transcorneal permeation has traditionally been the mechanism by which topically applied ophthalmic drugs are believed to gain access to the internal ocular structures. Relatively little attention has been given to alternate routes by which drugs may enter the eye. A system has been developed which allowed the investigation in vivo of the contribution of noncorneal absorption to intraocular drug levels after topical dosing. Using timolol and inulin as probe drugs, it was shown that the noncorneal absorption route may contribute significantly to drug penetration into intraocular tissues. Furthermore, results demonstrated that drugs absorbed by the noncorneal route appeared to enter certain intraocular tissues by a mechanism which bypasses the anterior chamber. These studies suggested that intraocular penetration via noncorneal routes involves penetration of drug across the conjunctiva/sclera. Neither reentry from the general circulation after drug absorption into the blood or drug delivery by the local vasculature accounted for the observed results. In terms of topical ophthalmic drug delivery, the noncorneal absorption route may be important for drugs that are poorly absorbed across the cornea due to their physical-chemical properties. We have demonstrated this using inulin as a model for a poorly absorbed, high molecular weight substance.", 
    "55": "Oral metoprolol, in a dose sufficient to reduce resting pulse rate by 25%, was compared with repeated injection sclerotherapy for the long term management of variceal bleeding. The prospective, randomised study was undertaken in 32 patients with biopsy proven cirrhosis and variceal bleeding who were Grade A or B on a modified Child's classification. In the 15 patients receiving metoprolol, portal pressure showed a mean fall of 3.7 mmHg (17.3 +/- 1.2 to 13.6 +/- 1.2 mmHg, p less than 0.01) after four weeks of continuous therapy, as compared with pretreatment levels. Nine of the 15 patients taking metoprolol had further bleeding (total of 21 episodes) compared with six of 17 in the sclerotherapy group (nine episodes). The risk of bleeding per patient/month of follow up was three times higher in the metoprolol group compared with those treated by sclerotherapy (0.14 and 0.04 respectively, p less than 0.025). Rebleeding in the metoprolol group occurred in six of the patients who had a fall in portal pressure of 10% or more.", 
    "56": "Thirty-six normal subjects received a drop in either eye of two of four ophthalmic solutions, balanced saline (S), carteolol, 1% (C1), carteolol, 2% (C2), or timolol, 0.5% (T), in a double-blind, randomized trial in a balanced incomplete block design. Subjects reported immediately, at three, and again at ten minutes after administration whether one eye felt more irritated and marked an analog scale of irritation. An observer also made ratings at three minutes based on responses to stereotyped questions. Significant differences in irritation between timolol and each of the other drugs and placebo were shown by analog scale scores immediately after instillation of the solutions. Maximum likelihood estimates were calculated based on statements of subject preference, and a significant preference was demonstrated. Observer ratings also demonstrated a treatment effect. This simple clinical assay system provides a new, valid method for estimating irritation induced by ophthalmic solutions.", 
    "57": "Peptide HI (PHI)-immunoreactive nerve fibres were numerous around cerebral blood vessels of the cat. The number and distribution resemble that previously found for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), a peptide with which PHI co-exists in pial arteries, at least in some segments. PHI and VIP elicit dilatation in a concentration-dependent manner in isolated middle cerebral arteries; the maximum effects were similar but VIP was considerably more potent. Neither effect was blocked by atropine, cimetidine or propranolol, confirming an action at a non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic site. In chloralose-anaesthetized cats PHI and VIP elicited concentration-dependent dilatations; the magnitude of responses was similar, however, considerably more PHI was necessary to elicit the same response as that of VIP. The results suggest that though both peptides are co-localized and may act at the same receptor, VIP is a more likely candidate for eliciting dilatation during physiological conditions.", 
    "58": "In order to evaluate the role of beta 1-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade on lower limb haemodynamics, blood pressure, leg blood flow and vascular resistance were measured at rest and during reactive hyperaemia in 34 hypertensive patients. The study was performed as a randomized double-blind cross over trial involving four weeks' treatment with the beta 1-selective metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d., the non-selective propranolol 80 mg b.i.d., and placebo b.i.d. Blood pressure was equally reduced by both beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs. Reactive hyperaemic blood flow decreased by 19% (p less than 0.01) during propranolol and by 14% (p less than 0.01) during metoprolol treatment, when compared to placebo. Vascular resistance, however, was unaltered by these drugs. There were no significant differences between beta 1-selective and non-selective beta-blockade on lower limb haemodynamics in hypertensive patients. As the reason for diminished reactive hyperaemic blood flow we suggest a beta-blocking effect on the heart rather than a peripheral mechanism.", 
    "59": "Indomethacin has been reported to induce coronary vasoconstriction in patients treated with beta-adrenoceptor blockers and nitrates. In the present investigation, the possibility that coronary blood flow was affected by a direct or indirect interaction between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and propranolol was studied in the anesthetized dog. During beta-adrenoceptor blockade by propranolol, both indomethacin and etodolac failed to decrease coronary blood flow. When administered alone at doses sufficient to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, indomethacin and etodolac did not reduce the coronary blood flow. It was concluded that there was no interaction between propranolol and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs used. The results also suggested that the role of prostaglandins in the regulation of the coronary circulation remains an open question.", 
    "60": "A recently added goal in the control of primary hypertension is the reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy which may occur early in the disease and which can have serious consequences. We have attempted to define the hemodynamic parameters which distinguish most sensitively between the long-term effects of two antihypertensive drugs, alpha-methyldopa and propranolol, with a view to determining the optimal conditions under which each of the drugs may be used therapeutically. Twenty matched hypertensive patients, all with established left ventricular hypertrophy, were divided at random into two groups who received either alpha-methyldopa or propranolol as monotherapy. Dosage was titrated until blood pressures were normalized (diastolic blood pressure (DBP) less than or equal to 95 mmHg) (1 mmHg = 133.322 Pa); then therapy was maintained for 48-52 weeks. Supine and erect blood pressures, heart rates, and eight echocardiographic indices were recorded before commencement of therapy and at the 48- to 52-week period. Stepwise discriminant analysis identified erect DBP, erect heart rate, and posterior wall thickness of the left ventricle as being the parameters which distinguished most clearly the therapeutic effects of the chosen drugs. Using these three parameters, all 20 patients were correctly classified into their respective drug groups. We propose that these results may form the basis of a more rational choice of antihypertensive therapy with alpha-methyldopa or propranolol for hypertensive patients based on the initial determination of these three parameters.", 
    "61": "Ketanserin, an investigational, antiserotonergic agent, at a dose of 40 mg bid was given to 18 patients with mild to moderate primary hypertension in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, with 100-mg metoprolol bid for four weeks each. The following parameters were evaluated: blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac workload (product of systolic blood pressure and heart rate during bicycle exercise), systolic time intervals, and peripheral blood flow (by strain-gauge plethysmography). Significant reductions in diastolic and concomitant slight decreases in systolic blood pressure without changes in heart rate were observed during ketanserin treatment; cardiac oxygen demands during exercise test did not change, however. Pre-ejection period and left ventricular ejection time were unchanged, while significant increase in rest flow to the lower limbs and decrease in peripheral resistance were demonstrated by strain-gauge plethysmography. The results indicate that ketanserin has vasodilating properties and hypotensive activity that may be useful in the management of patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "62": "The in vitro effects of propranolol, a commonly used beta-adrenergic blocker, on the membrane structure and function of rat heart mitochondria were investigated. It was found that the respiratory control and oxidative phosphorylation of the isolated mitochondria decreased concomitantly when the drug was added to the assay medium. At the concentration higher than 1.0 X 10(-4) M, propranolol significantly inhibited the State 3 respiration but had little effect on the State 4 respiration of the mitochondria. On the other hand, the drug exhibited noncompetitive inhibitions toward the Mg2+-ATPase activity of submitochondrial particles and purified enzyme preparations at the concentrations ranging from 3.0 X 10(-4) to 1.5 X 10(-3) M. The inhibitory constants of propranolol toward the enzyme activity in submitochondrial particles and in the purified preparation were estimated to be 6.7 X 10(-4) and 1.4 X 10(-3) M, respectively. However, the drug did not show significant effect on the activity of any of the enzyme complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It is thus concluded that propranolol impairs the mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation mainly through its inhibition of the Mg2+-ATPase activity of the mitochondria. This effect of propranolol may explain, at least partly, its depression effects on the cardiac functions of the animal.", 
    "63": "Platelet activation has been reported to occur in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon; however, the effect of calcium channel blockers and thromboxane synthetase inhibitors has not been previously studied. The effect of two drugs that potentially inhibit platelet activation were studied: nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, and dazoxiben, a specific thromboxane synthetase inhibitor. Two platelet-specific proteins released during platelet activation, beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4, were measured during a double-blind clinical trial of these two drugs in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon. The plasma beta-thromboglobulin level was significantly elevated in the patient population (53.8 +/- 7.6 ng/ml) during the placebo period compared with that in a normal control population (27.0 +/- 3.1 ng/ml) (p less than 0.01). The plasma platelet factor 4 level was 8.7 +/- 2.2 ng/ml in the patients compared with 6.5 +/- 1.0 ng/ml in the normal subjects (p = NS). These findings indicate the presence of in vivo platelet activation in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon. Nifedipine lowered the levels of beta-thromboglobulin to near the normal range (33.4 +/- 4.6 ng/ml). The inhibition of platelet activation by nifedipine was associated with clinical improvement in Raynaud's phenomenon with fewer and less intense episodes. Beta-thromboglobulin was not lowered by dazoxiben (58.1 +/- 9.0 ng/ml) compared with the placebo. The reduction of beta-thromboglobulin levels by nifedipine indicates that in vivo platelet activation was inhibited by this agent. Since this was associated with a reduced frequency of attacks, it is not clear whether this was a direct effect of the drug on platelet activation, leading to decreased frequency of vasospasm, or an effect on vascular smooth muscle leading to decreased vasospasm and a secondary decrease in platelet activation.", 
    "64": "Progressive postbirth development of mammalian heart contractile function is accompanied by augmentations of aerobic metabolic potential and cardiac myofibrillar ATPase activity. The temporal similarity of the above developmental sequences suggested that a single, unifying factor may coordinate myocardial maturation. It was hypothesized that cardiac sympathetic nervous system development might be regulating other aspects of myocardial growth. To test this hypothesis, previously well-defined aspects of heart metabolism and contractile protein ATPase activity were determined in rats which were either sympathectomized with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or subjected to chronic, beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol) throughout the postbirth period from 3 to 6 weeks of age. Neither 6-OHDA treatment nor chronic, beta-adrenergic blockade resulted in a significant reduction of any metabolic enzyme specific activity or in myofibrillar ATPase. Myofibrillar creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity underwent greater enhancement relative to ATPase during normal heart growth. Significant and divergent influences were exerted by 6-OHDA and propranolol drug regimens on myofibrillar CPK/ATPase enzyme activity ratio. These results indicate (a) the potential for independent regulation of myofibrillar CPK and ATPase, and (b) the advisability of evaluating CPK, ATPase, and CPK/ATPase enzymatic activities as myofibrillar correlates of heart contractile function. Nevertheless, the majority of developmentally related processes in the heart are minimally influenced by chemical sympathectomy.", 
    "65": "Five male and 5 female clinically healthy volunteers, 17-37 years of age, gave systemic venous blood at 0600, 0800, 1200, 1800, 2000 and 0000 for RIA of (supine values) plasma renin-angiotensin (PRA) and aldosterone (PA) under 4 conditions: a. unrestricted sodium intake, no treatment; b. unrestricted sodium intake and 40 mg propranolol per os every 6 h; c. sodium restriction, no treatment; d. propranolol loading on sodium deprivation. Cosinor methods were used for data analysis. Sodium restriction amplifies the circadian rhythms of PRA and PA, whereas propranolol loading inhibits these same rhythms on a unrestricted sodium intake, but much less so under conditions of sodium deprivation. The propranolol-induced inhibition of the circadian rhythms investigated on a unrestricted sodium intake suggests that the beta-adrenergic system is an effective mechanism coordinating the circadian rhythmic functions investigated. The persistence of the rhythms in sodium-depleted subjects under pharmacological blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors is in keeping with the concept that a second mechanism of the circadian rhythms examined is located in the sodium-sensitive macula densa cells of the renal distal tubule.", 
    "66": "The messenger roles of cyclic AMP and the calcium ion in stimulus-secretion coupling are considered in the frog and bovine corneal epithelium, respectively. In the frog cornea, epinephrine stimulates net C1 transport by increasing cyclic AMP content. This stimulation is associated with a larger apical membrane C1 conductance and basolateral membrane ionic conductance. The response of the apical membrane conductance is thought to result from an increase in cyclic AMP content whereas the basolateral membrane ionic conductance increase is unrelated based on measurements of the effects of the calcium channel antagonist, diltiazem, and the beta agonist, isoproterenol, on the electrical parameters and cyclic AMP content. The basolateral membrane is essentially K permselective since the K channel blocker, Ba, depolarized the intracellular potential difference and increased the basolateral membrane resistance. Diltiazem had even larger effects on these parameters suggesting that this compound is a more effective inhibitor of K channel activity than barium. In broken cell preparations of bovine corneal epithelium, a high affinity form of Ca + Mg activated ATPase is present (Km = .06 microM for Ca) and is essentially of plasma membrane origin. This ATPase activation is at a Ca activity similar to the expected intracellular value and suggests that this activity is the enzymatic basis for net Ca transport.", 
    "67": "In order to evaluate the role of beta-receptor mediated effects of catecholamines in the metabolic deterioration following insulin withdrawal in insulin-dependent diabetic patients we have measured in 5 patients metabolic substrate and hormone concentrations during a 6 hours arrest of insulin infusion, without or with a simultaneous infusion of propranolol. During insulin deprivation plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine increased slightly (from 107 +/- 10 ng/L to 173 +/- 6 ng/L and from 307 +/- 37 ng/L to 518 +/- 77/ng/L respectively (p less than 0.05), cortisol decreased physiologically, but growth hormone and glucagon were not significantly modified. Free insulin decreased progressively from 12.2 +/- 2.5 mU/L to 5.4 +/- 1.1 mU/L (p less than 0.01). Blood glucose and ketone bodies rose sharply before any significant change in catecholamine levels. Plasma free fatty acids and blood glycerol increased progressively and their rise appeared somewhat temporally related to the variations of catecholamine levels. The addition of propranolol to insulin deprivation did not modify the changes in hormone concentrations in spite of a slightly greater rise of epinephrine (from 78 +/- 4 ng/L to 179 +/- 7 ng/L, p less than 0.05) and norepinephrine (from 395 +/- 80 ng/L to 679 +/- 153 ng/L, p less than 0.05). The rises of glucose and ketone bodies were unaffected whereas the increases of free fatty acids and glycerol were slightly blunted. In conclusion, we have no evidence for a beta-adrenergic mediated role for catecholamines in the development of hyperglycaemia and ketonaemia in non-stressed insulin deprived diabetic patients, and only small evidence for a permissive effect on lipolysis.", 
    "68": "The actions of the adenine dinucleotides beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) were examined on the carbachol-contracted taenia coli of the guinea-pig. Both were capable of inducing full relaxations in a concentration-dependent manner; NADP was 21.4 times more effective than NAD at EC50; the threshold for NADP was approximately 0.1 microM and for NAD approximately 1.0 microM. The P1-purinoceptor antagonist, 8-phenyltheophylline (10 microM), produced a large parallel rightward shift in the NAD concentration-response curve; in contrast it produced a small parallel leftward shift in the NADP concentration-response curve. Dipyridamole (0.2 microM), a purine nucleoside uptake inhbitor, markedly potentiated responses to NAD and slightly potentiated NADP. 8-Phenyltheophylline antagonized the dipyridamole potentiation of both NAD and NADP. By use of high performance liquid chromatography it was shown that the action of NAD involves a breakdown to adenosine. Apamin, a K+ channel blocker, which antagonizes P2-purinoceptor activation in the intestine, abolished responses to NADP but not to NAD. The alpha-and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, phentolamine (1 microM) and propranolol (1 microM), did not affect responses to NAD or NADP. Tetrodotoxin, a neurotoxin, did not abolish responses to either NAD or NADP. It is concluded that NAD acts largely indirectly as a P1-purinoceptor agonist following its breakdown to adenosine by ectoenzymes, while NADP acts in a similar manner to a P2-purinoceptor agonist.", 
    "69": "Changes in the properties of adenylate cyclase from the lungs of tuberculotic guinea pigs were revealed. The number of beta-adrenergic receptors in the lungs was found to be reduced by 30% at the second and by 70% at the third stage of the disease. The degree and the value of Ka for adenylate cyclase activation by isoproterenol remained thereby unchanged. The basal activity of adenylate cyclase was increased by 20% against the control level at the second stage and decreased by 20% at the third stage of the disease. At these periods, the stimulating effects of guanylyl imidodiphosphate, NaF and forskolin on lung adenylate cyclase were diminished. The experimental results point to the significant role of the enzymes of cAMP metabolism and reflect the course of the tuberculosis process in experimental animals.", 
    "70": "Direct impact of the heart on the right ventricle induces transient ventricular tachycardia. Preconditioning the heart with a moderate dose of propranolol (0.4 mg/Kg, IV) did not affect impact-induced tachyarrhthmia although effective beta adrenergic blockage was evident. A high dose of propranolol (1.6 mg/Kg, IV) or a moderate dose of quinidine (3 mg/Kg, IV) prevented impact-induced ventricular tachycardia. High-dose propranolol and quinidine, an agent with no beta blockade properties, share similar local effects on the myocardial cell membrane which was sufficient to prevent the tachyarrhythmia. Pacing of the right ventricular free wall at the impact site resulted in an ECG similar to that observed following impact. Pacing of the subjacent septem, the other possible arrhythmogenic site affected by the impact, resulted in a large aberrant S wave (Lead II) different from the QRS complex during impact-induced tachyarrhythmia. Therefore, impact-induced ventricular tachycardia originates from the impact site by a direct ventricular mechanism.", 
    "71": "In acute experiments on cats, the character and mechanisms of changes of the heart pumping function were studied in suppression of the carotid sinus baroreceptors with occlusion of the carotid arteries. In 65% of tests the cardiac output was reduced. Changes of venous return, at that, were diverse and opposite to those of the cardiac output in 50% of observations. Neither vagotomy, nor blockade of beta-adreno- and M-cholinoreceptors affected the character of cardiac output changes. The role of maximal responses of arterial pressure in forming of the cardiac output shifts in sino-carotid reflex, is discussed.", 
    "72": "Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the radioligand (-)-[125I]iodopindolol (125I-Pin) have been used to study isoproterenol-dependent protein phosphorylation and beta-adrenergic receptor availability, respectively, in cultured Sertoli cells and freshly isolated seminiferous tubular segments of sexually immature and mature rats. Sertoli cells prepared from sexually immature rats show progressive 125I-Pin binding in primary cultures that correlates with isoproterenol-induced cell shape changes, redistribution of immunoreactive vimentin, and phosphorylation of this intermediate filament protein. The development of 125I-Pin binding to Sertoli cell lysates is blocked by cycloheximide. Seminiferous tubules do not show significant isoproterenol-dependent vimentin phosphorylation nor 125I-Pin binding. However, vimentin phosphorylation can be induced by follicle-stimulating hormone or a cyclic nucleotide analog. This study stresses the need for correlating pharmacological-induced responses observed in Sertoli cell primary cultures with those in the intact seminiferous tubule."
