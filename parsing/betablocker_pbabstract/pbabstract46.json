The porcine buccal mucosa has been proposed as a substitute for the buccal mucosa barrier on ex vivo permeability studies avoiding unnecessary sacrifice of animals. But it is not always easy to obtain fresh buccal mucosa. Consequently, human and porcine buccal mucosa is sometimes frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen, but this procedure is not always feasible. One cheaper and simpler alternative is to freeze the buccal mucosa of freshly slaughtered pigs in a mechanical freezer, using DMSO and albumin as cryoprotective agents. This study compared the ex vivo permeability parameters of propranolol hydrochloride through porcine buccal mucosa using a Franz diffusion cell system and HPLC as detection method. The freezing effects on drug permeability parameters were evaluated. Equally histological studies were performed. Furthermore, the use of the parameter transmucosal water loss (TMWL) as an indicator of the buccal mucosa integrity was evaluated just as transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is utilized for skin integrity. The results showed no difference between fresh and frozen mucosal flux, permeability coefficient or lag time of propranolol. However, statistical significant difference in TMWL between fresh and frozen mucosa was observed.",

    "2": "Hepatic hydrothorax is refractory to salt restriction and diuretics in approximately 25% of cases. Primary management options for these patients include serial thoracenteses, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement, and insertion of an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC). Response rate to TIPS, being the first choice whenever possible, is about 80%. IPC is emerging as a feasible alternative in patients who require frequent therapeutic thoracenteses, particularly if TIPS is contraindicated. Pleurodesis is not advocated because of the low likelihood of a pleural symphysis owing to the rapid re-accumulation of pleural fluid. The only cure for hepatic hydrothorax, a defined complication of end-stage liver disease, is liver transplantation.",

This study was focused to evaluate the quality of prescriptions and to emphasize the placement of clinical pharmacist in health care team. This study was carried out in different outpatient settings of (in) Karachi, Pakistan. The study period was June 2011 till June 2012. Retrospective data was analyzed for the outpatients' prescription of beta blocker drugs. During the study, prescriptions (n=450) were collected from different outpatient settings of (in) Karachi, Pakistan. Prescription containing beta-blockers were analyzed for the essential elements to be mentioned in prescription. Drug-drug interactions were identified by the Micromedex.2.0 Drug-Reax database and severity of medication error was determined by NCCMERP Index. A total of 1627 medication errors were identified in 450 prescriptions. The most frequent error was not mentioning the patient's weight (95%), followed by missing diagnosis (79.4%) and drug-drug interactions (69.5%). Twenty-two prescriptions were placed in the most severe category I (4.88%). Average number of drugs per prescription was 4.76. Significant difference was observed (\u03c7(2)=52.418, p<0.05) using SPSS 19 for those prescription orders having more than 5 drugs with Beta-blockers. This indicates that the errors in prescription such as drug-drug interactions, wrong dose etc. was significantly increased with the number of drugs per prescription. Results showed that medication errors are very frequent in prescription written in outpatient setting of various hospitals and clinics in Karachi. This shows that the irrational prescribing is a common practice in developing countries. Placement of skilled pharmacist in the health care system is the only solution for avoidance of these medication related problems.",

We report the cases of 2 patients who presented with takotsubo cardiomyopathy and were subsequently found to have apical-variant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, after the apical ballooning from the takotsubo cardiomyopathy had resolved. The first patient, a 43-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse, presented with shortness of breath, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic features consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and no significant coronary artery disease. An echocardiogram 2 weeks later revealed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and newly apparent apical hypertrophy. The 2nd patient, a 70-year-old woman with pancreatitis, presented with chest pain, apical akinesis, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.39, consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. One month later, her left ventricular ejection fraction was normal; however, hypertrophy of the left ventricular apex was newly noted.

However, chronic stimulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors leads to impaired cardiac function, and \u03b2-blockers are widely used as therapeutic agents for the treatment of cardiac disease.

We studied the ability of the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan to cure or prevent AD hallmarks in aged (~18months at endpoint, 3months treatment) or adult (~12months at endpoint, 10months treatment) human amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. We tested learning and memory with the Morris water maze, and evaluated neurometabolic and neurovascular coupling using [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET and laser Doppler flowmetry responses to whisker stimulation. Cerebrovascular reactivity was assessed with on-line videomicroscopy. We measured protein levels of oxidative stress enzymes (superoxide dismutases SOD1, SOD2 and NADPH oxidase subunit p67phox), and quantified soluble and deposited amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), AngII receptors AT1 and AT2, angiotensin IV receptor AT4, and cortical cholinergic innervation. In aged APP mice, losartan did not improve learning but it consolidated memory acquisition and recall, and rescued neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling and cerebrovascular dilatory capacity. Losartan normalized cerebrovascular p67phox and SOD2 protein levels and up-regulated those of SOD1. Losartan attenuated astrogliosis, normalized AT1 and AT4 receptor levels, but failed to rescue the cholinergic deficit and the A\u03b2 pathology. Given preventively, losartan protected cognitive function, cerebrovascular reactivity, and AT4 receptor levels. Like in aged APP mice, these benefits occurred without a decrease in soluble A\u03b2 species or plaque load. We conclude that losartan exerts potent preventive and restorative effects on AD hallmarks, possibly by mitigating AT1-initiated oxidative stress and normalizing memory-related AT4 receptors.",

    "19": "When tested on the treadmill mice do not display a graded increase of heart rate (HR), but rather a sharp shift of cardiovascular indices to high levels at the onset of locomotion. We hypothesized that under test conditions cardiovascular reaction to physical load in mice is masked with stress-associated HR increase. To test this hypothesis we monitored mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate in C57BL/6 mice after exposure to stressful stimuli, during spontaneous locomotion in the open-field test, treadmill running or running in a wheel installed in the home cage. Mice were treated with \u03b21-adrenoblocker atenolol (2mg/kg ip, A), cholinolytic ipratropium bromide (2mg/kg ip, I), combination of blockers (A+I), anxiolytic diazepam (5mg/kg ip, D) or saline (control trials, SAL). MAP and HR in mice increased sharply after handling, despite 3weeks of habituation to the procedure. Under stressful conditions of open field test cardiovascular parameters in mice were elevated and did not depend on movement speed. HR values did not differ in I and SAL groups and were reduced with A or A+I. HR was lower at rest in D pretreated mice. In the treadmill test HR increase over speeds of 6, 12 and 18m/min was roughly 1/7-1/10 of HR increase observed after placing the mice on the treadmill. HR could not be increased with cholinolytic (I), but was reduced after sympatholytic (A) or A+I treatment. Anxiolytic (D) reduced heart rate at lower speeds of movement and its overall effect was to unmask the dependency of HR on running speed. During voluntary running in non-stressful conditions of the home cage HR in mice linearly increased with increasing running speeds. We conclude that in test situations cardiovascular reactions in mice are governed predominantly by stress-associated sympathetic activation, rendering efforts to evaluate HR and MAP reactions to workload unreliable.",

The compounds, which included atenolol, carbamazepine, meprobamate, phenytoin and primidone, were evaluated for both direct and sensitized photolysis. In the two wastewaters, direct photolysis did not lead to significant compound degradation; however, sensitized photolysis was an important removal pathway for the five pharmaceuticals. Upon solar irradiation, hydroxyl radical (HO) was quantified using the hydroxylation of benzene and singlet oxygen ((1)O2) formation was monitored following the degradation of furfuryl alcohol. Degradation via sensitized photolysis was observed following five-day exposures for atenolol (69-91%), carbamazepine (67-98%), meprobamate (16-52%), phenytoin (44-85%), and primidone (34-88%). Varying removal is likely a result of the differences in reactivity with transient oxidants. Averaged steady state HO concentrations ranged from 1.2 to 4.0\u00d710(-16)M, whereas the concentrations of (1)O2 were 6.0-7.6\u00d710(-14)M.

The introduction of a water plug in capillary before the electrokinetic injection provided the effective preconcentration of chiral compounds. And then the water was moving out of the column from the injection end under the effect of the EOF, which avoided dilution of the stacked \u03b2-blocker enantiomers concentration suffering from the presence of water in separation buffer. Moreover, the addition of H3 PO4 and methanol in the sample solution greatly improved the enhancement efficiency further. Under optimized conditions, more than 2700-fold enhancement in sensitivity was obtained for each enantiomer of bupranolol (BU), alprenolol (AL), and propranolol (PRO) via electrokinetic injection.

Different from BCOP, a modulating barrier was added to delay the drug release and obtain desired lag time (Tlag). The influences of the amount of pore-forming agent and modulating barrier, coating weight gain on the lag time (Tlag) and drug release rate (Rt) of TCOP were investigated. The central composite design-response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the formulation. Rhodamine B was added to modulating barrier to determine the release process of modulating barrier. A method used to correct the release profiles with a certain lag time by \u0394Tlag and interpolating was applied to compare TCOP with BCOP. Tlag was directly proportional to the amount of modulating barrier and coating weight gain, but inversely related to the amount of pore forming agent, which were contrary to the effects on Rt. The optimal formulation including 60\u2009mg PEO WSR N80, 3\u2009g PEG 4000 and 6% coating weight gain could obtain a 3.59-h Tlag. According to the release of Rhodamine B, the modulating barrier was completely pushed out at \u223c5.0\u2009h, longer than 3.59\u2009h, therefore, atenolol along with remaining modulating barrier was released together between 3.59 and 5.0\u2009h.

Age-matched untreated male SHR and Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) were used as hypertensive and normotensive controls, respectively. At the end of intervention we performed a histological study to analyze coronary artery wall width (WW), wall-to-lumen ratio (W/L), and media cross-sectional area (MCSA). Dose-response curves for acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside were constructed. We also assessed several plasma oxidative stress biomarkers, namely, superoxide scavenging activity (SOSA), nitrites, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC).

    "37": "Peripheral norepinephrine release is facilitated by presynaptic \u03b2-adrenoceptors, believed to involve the \u03b22-subtype exclusively. However, \u03b21-selective blockers are the most commonly used \u03b2-blockers in hypertension. Here the author tested the hypothesis that \u03b21AR may function as presynaptic, release-facilitating auto-receptors. Since \u03b21AR-blockers are injected during myocardial infarction, their influence on the cardiovascular response to acute norepinephrine release was also studied. By a newly established method, using tyramine-stimulated release through the norepinephrine transporter (NET), presynaptic control of catecholamine release was studied in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats. \u03b21AR-selective antagonists (CGP20712A, atenolol, metoprolol) reduced norepinephrine overflow to plasma equally efficient as \u03b22AR-selective (ICI-118551) and \u03b21+2AR (nadolol) antagonists in both strains. Neither antagonist lowered epinephrine secretion. Atenolol, which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, reduced norepinephrine overflow after adrenalectomy (AdrX), AdrX\u2009+\u2009ganglion blockade, losartan, or nephrectomy. Atenolol and metoprolol reduced resting cardiac work load. During tyramine-stimulated norepinephrine release, they had little effect on work load, and increased the transient rise in total peripheral vascular resistance, particularly atenolol when combined with losartan. In conclusion, \u03b21AR, like \u03b22AR, stimulated norepinephrine but not epinephrine release, independent of adrenal catecholamines, ganglion transmission, or renal renin release/angiotensin AT1 receptor activation. \u03b21AR therefore functioned as a peripheral, presynaptic, facilitating auto-receptor. Like tyramine, hypoxia may induce NET-mediated release. Augmented tyramine-induced vasoconstriction, as observed after injection of \u03b21AR-blocker, particularly atenolol combined with losartan, may hamper organ perfusion, and may have clinical relevance in hypoxic conditions such as myocardial infarction.",

Using an oral \u03b2-blocker was associated with an increased hazard of incident exudative AMD (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.04-2.82), but not pure GA (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.20-1.29) or progression of AMD (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.67-1.28) over the 20-year period.",

    "50": "Serial electrocardiographic monitoring of \u0394QTc as an assumed harbinger of proarrhythmia is currently recommended for dofetilide and sotalol initiation. Markers of repolarization heterogeneity such as increased peak to end of T-wave (TpTe) duration and abnormal T-wave morphology may also predict proarrhythmia. We investigated whether such T-wave measurements on baseline electrocardiogram will correlate with \u0394QTc after drug initiation. An analysis of 140 consecutive patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation hospitalized in sinus rhythm for sotalol or dofetilide initiation was performed. Baseline and serial electrocardiograms were analyzed using QT Guard Plus software (GE Healthcare), which measured QTc and TpTe and scored T-wave morphology for asymmetry, notching, and flatness using T-wave vector magnitude and principal component analysis algorithms. Sotalol and dofetilide were administered in 71% and 29% of patients, respectively. Mean age was 61 \u00b1 14 years, and 34% were women. After a single dose of either drug, there was a statistically significant increase in QTc and TpTe (p <0.01), as well as composite and individual T-wave markers of repolarization heterogeneity (p <0.01). QTc increased by a mean of 19 \u00b1 30 ms after initial antiarrhythmic dose. \u0394QTc was inversely related to baseline QTc and TpTe (p <0.01). After controlling for baseline QTc, there was no independent association between T-wave markers of repolarization heterogeneity and \u0394QTc. In conclusion, for patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation admitted for dofetilide or sotalol loading, T-wave markers of increased repolarization heterogeneity are measurable within hours after initiation. A shorter baseline QTc is associated with an increased \u0394QTc; however, there is no independent relation between baseline T-wave markers of repolarization heterogeneity and \u0394QTc.",

Contemporaneous guidelines provided clear recommendations regarding selection of patients for CRT, including that all patients should first receive GDMT with \u03b2 blockers and renin-angiotensin axis antagonists. Prevalence of GDMT among real-world patients receiving CRT defibrillators (CRT-D) has not been well studied. We identified 45,392 patients in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Registry who underwent first CRT-D implantation for primary prevention of sudden death from January 2006 to June 2008. We calculated the proportion of patients with contemporaneous class I guideline indications for CRT-D, the proportion receiving GDMT for heart failure, and the proportion receiving GDMT who had class I guideline indications for CRT-D. Among patients without contraindications, 87% were prescribed \u03b2 blockers, 78% an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor inhibitor, and 70% both a \u03b2 blocker and an angiotensin-converting enzyme or angiotensin II receptor inhibitor at discharge. Finally, 50% of patients met class I guideline indications and were prescribed GDMT at discharge; 9% neither met class I indications nor were prescribed GDMT at discharge. The major limitation of this study is the lack of dosage information in the Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Registry and lack of prescribing information at times other than discharge. In conclusion, many patients receiving CRT-D are not receiving GDMT at discharge. Ensuring that all patients receiving CRT-D are also receiving GDMT appears to be a quality improvement target.",

Carvedilol enantiomers were extracted from human serum (0.5 mL) via liquid-liquid extraction with methyl tert-butyl ether (2.5 mL). Carvedilol-related compound C served as the internal standard. The analyte and internal standard were separated on a Sino-Chiral AD column (150 \u00d7 4.6mm, 5 \u03bcm, amylose tris-3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate coated on silica-gel) using isocratic elution with mobile phases of methanol, water and diethylamine (94:6:0.01, v/v). The total run-time was 10.5 min. Carvedilol enantiomers were quantified using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in multiple-reaction-monitoring mode using positive electrospray ionisation. The mass transitions monitored for quantitation were carvedilol (m/z 407\u2192222) and carvedilol-related compound C (m/z 497\u2192222). The limits of quantification for the S- and R-carvedilol enantiomers in plasma were both 0.08 ng/mL. The method was validated in the linear range of 0.08-50 ng/mL with acceptable inter- and intra-assay precision and accuracy and stability suitable for routine laboratory practice. The method was successfully applied to samples taken from research volunteers treated with carvedilol sustained-release tablet 18 mg.

    "54": "Although primary chronic hypertension (HTN) is increasingly common in adolescence, secondary forms of HTN are more common among children. Primary HTN is associated with being overweight and/or a positive family history of HTN. Carotid intima-media thickness, a known risk factor for atherosclerosis is frequent in both adults and children with HTN and other associated cardiovascular (CV) risk factors including obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is also a common finding in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed HTN. Children with certain medical conditions such as congenital heart disease and Kawasaki disease can develop premature atherosclerosis heart disease that may lead to coronary heart disease and heart failure. Life-style interventions are recommended for all children with HTN, with pharmacologic therapy added for symptomatic children based on the presence of co-morbidities. As an example, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blocker and/or calcium channel blockers would be best for children with CV risk factors such as diabetes or renal disease, whereas an ACE inhibitor in combination with a beta-blocker and diuretics including spironolactone are recommended for patients with heart failure and reduced LV ejection fraction.

Following inhalation anesthesia, heart rate (HR) and SPO2 were acceptable while pentobarbital anesthesia decreased HR and SPO2 significantly. This indicates that inhalation anesthesia is more preferable than pentobarbital anesthesia when evaluating cardiovascular factors. Additionally, pentobarbital significantly increased HR variability (HRV), suggesting a regulatory effect of pentobarbital on the autonomic nervous system, and resulted in a decreased response of the baro-reflex system. Propranolol or atropine had limited effects on ECG recording following pentobarbital anesthesia. Taken together, these data suggest that inhalation anesthesia is suitable for conducting hemodynamic analyses in the rat.",

The structure and properties of the drug carriers were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Swelling kinetics of SCNs in various media was followed, and the conditions for effective MT loading were specified. MT-loaded SCNs with drug content up to 80\u00a0wt.% were produced.

The present study was focused on the retention and elution of pharmaceutically active substances based on several analyte-sorbent interaction properties. Basic drugs, such as \u03b2-blockers (i.e., atenolol, pindolol, acebutolol, metoprolol, labetalol, and propranolol) were selected as the model compounds for this study. These compounds are frequently encountered in anti-doping tests. The extraction efficiencies of the individual sorbents were compared based on the recovery of known amounts of the targeted analytes in a metered elution volume (500 \u03bcL) in three separate elution fractions. The elution efficiency of the total amount of the target analytes on various sorbents was not appreciably influenced by the volume of eluent required for complete elution. Based on the small matrix effects and clear baseline, SupelMIP was the most suitable sorbent for urine analysis. The relative analyte recoveries of the SPE-HPLC procedure proved satisfactory for the range from 94% to 105%, with an RSD ranging from 2% to 4%.

The potency of the compounds at the low- and high-affinity site of \u03b21-adrenoceptors (\u03b21L and \u03b21H; both increasing heart rate) was compared in the pithed rat. One compound was also studied in the isolated rat heart and its \u03b11-adrenolytic effect determined in the isolated rat mesenteric artery. In the pithed rat, four compounds blocked the \u03b21L-adrenoceptor at a \u226510-fold lower potency than the \u03b21H-adrenoceptor whereas the xanthone derivative (-)-MH-3 was equipotent. In the spontaneously beating right atrium (-)-MH-3 was a non-competitive antagonist of comparable potency at either receptor; its apparent pD'2 value for the \u03b21L-adrenoceptor ranged from 5.6 to 6.4 under various conditions, including the Langendorff preparation.

    "87": "Overactive bladder is defined by ICS as urgency frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence in the absence of urinary tract infection, or other obvious causative pathology Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are highly prevalent, especially in aging populations. Epidemiological studies reported LUTS in 62% of men and 67% of women, rising to 81% and 79%, respectively in adults over 60 years old. However the actual burden of LUTS remains relatively unrecognized. LUTS, mainly due to considerable distress including almost all aspects of social functioning, impact on sleep and mental health, may significantly affect quality of life. Management of LUTS including OAB has undergone dramatic changes since 1972, when the first antimuscarinic drug-oxybutynin, was introduced into clinical practice. In the last two decades, six new antimuscarinic drugs entered OAB field and this was accompanied by introduction of botulinum toxin into clinical practice in patients resistant to or not compliant with antimuscarinics. Nowadays, it is recognized that OAB is progressive, age-related and non sex-specific condition with most patients experiencing a combination of storage, voiding and post-micturition symptoms. In 2013, the next step was taken, with new therapeutic options for OAB, enabling an even more patient-tailored approach. This was possible for both, male and female OAB sufferers with new class of oral 3 adrenoreceptor agonist (mirabegron). This drug, by stimulation of 3-adrenoceptors, couples via Gs proteins to adenylyl cyclase, what results in an increase of intracellular cAMP levels and a subsequent activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, which then phosphorylates myosin light chain kinase responsible for inhibition of calcium-calmodulin dependent interaction of myosin with actin. Moreover the cAMP increase also leads to the reduction of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration by removal of calcium ions from cytoplasm. These both actions result in a significant increase in the storage bladder capacity and by this interval between micturitions is prolonged. Mirabegron was evaluated in three 12-week, double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trials in OAB patients with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency and frequency - study 046, 047 and 074. It should be pointed out that efficacy of mirabegron was maintained through the entire 12-month period in phase Ill long-term study Discoveries on the physiology of the normal bladder and on the pathophysiology underlying OAB have led to the development of new treatment options for OAB. Pharmacological management of OAB should be tailored to patient's characteristics. New and recent options of pharmacological treatment have undoubtedly expanded treatment possibilities, what should allow physicians to select the optimal treatment for each patient.",

Ranolazine used with BB or CCB showed benefits across all outcomes assessed, while LAN and trimetazidine used with BB or CCB have shown benefits across some outcomes. Ivabradine added to BB shows inconsistent effects from a single study, whilst there is no relevant evidence for nicorandil.",

A similar percentage was found at 3 months (65.6%) and 12 months (67.9%) after discharge. All-cause mortality and the composite of all-cause mortality and readmission for heart failure were significantly lower in patients treated with beta-blockers (hazard ratio=0.59, 95% confidence interval, 0.41-0.84 vs hazard ratio=0.64, 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.83). This decrease in mortality was maintained after adjusting by age, sex, ejection fraction, functional class, comorbidities, and concomitant treatment.",

Population-based control subjects were matched to the patients (n\u2009=\u2009395). LVSD was defined as echocardiographically determined left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <55%, and moderate or greater LVSD was defined as LVEF <45%. The prevalence of LVSD was significantly greater in patients than in controls (13.7% vs. 6.1%, P\u2009<\u20090.001). The prevalence of moderate or greater LVSD in participants not on treatment with a combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and beta-blocker was 2.3% in patients and 1.3% in controls (P\u2009=\u20090.31). When LEAD and SICAD were analysed together, adjusted for potential confounders, SICAD [odds ratio (OR) 2.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-6.32], but not LEAD (OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.80-3.18), was independently associated with LVSD.",

However, the prevalence of at least moderate LVSD in patients not on treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a beta-blocker was only 2.3% and not significantly different from controls. Stenotic artery disease in the internal carotid artery, but not in the lower extremities, was independently associated with LVSD.", 
    "107": "Arrhythmias have been treated for a long time with drugs that mainly target the ionic pumps and channels. These anti-arrhythmic regimens per se introduce new arrhythmias, which can be detrimental to patients. Advances in development of novel pharmacology without introduction of iatrogenic arrhythmias are thus favorable for an effective treatment of arrhythmias. Electrophysiological stability of the heart has been shown to be closely associated with cardiac metabolism. The present effective anti-arrhythmic drugs such as beta-blockers and amiodarone have profound beneficial effects in regulating myocardial metabolism. Aiming at decreasing production of toxic metabolites or preventing accumulation of arrhythmogenic lipids perhaps is a good strategy to effectively control arrhythmias. Therefore, a better understanding of the pro-arrhythmic profiles of cardiac metabolites helps to explore a new generation of metabolically oriented anti-arrhythmic medications. In this review, we present several lipid metabolites and summarize their arrhythmogenic characteristics.", 
    "108": "Lung function abnormalities, both at rest and during exercise, are frequently observed in patients with chronic heart failure (HF), also in absence of respiratory disease. It has been documented that, in HF, chronic adrenergic stimulation down-regulates \u03b2-adrenoceptors (\u03b2-ARs) and modifies airway relaxant responses. This study was designed to investigate in an animal model of HF whether a treatment with a \u03b2-AR blocker, metoprolol, could modify the altered airway hyperresponsiveness. In rats, randomly assigned to 3 experimental groups sham-operated rats (SH), rats with HF induced by left anterior descending coronaric occlusion (HF n\u00a0=\u00a010), and rats treated with metoprolol 100\u00a0mg/kg/die (MET\u00a0=\u00a010), HF was evaluated after 10 weeks and resulted in increases in plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine and left ventricular end diastolic pressure. \u03b22-ARs and G-protein-\u03b2AR2-kinase (GRK2) mRNA levels were determined by real time reverse transcriptase PCR. Carbachol-precontracted isolated tracheal rings were used to functionally assess airway smooth muscle relaxation. In pulmonary tissues, \u03b22-AR mRNA level was significantly decreased in HF groups (-48.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.18%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01); in the same groups the GRK2 mRNA-levels were significantly enhanced (+222.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.13%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001); in lung deriving from MET groups the levels of mRNA were significantly increased (+339.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.26%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), while the GRK2 mRNA-levels unchanged (-59.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.97%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), when compared to SH groups. Relaxation of tracheal strips in response to salbutamol was significantly reduced in HF groups; in tracheal rings, deriving from MET groups, the relaxant effects of salbutamol were significantly enhanced (SH, Emax: 34.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.98%, pD2: 7.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27; HF, Emax: 34.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.98%, pD2: 7.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27; MET, Emax: 85.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.80%, pD2: 6.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.59, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In HF, the down-regulation of pulmonary \u03b2-ARs results in a significant attenuation of airway relaxation. These effects have been reversed by a treatment with metoprolol, suggesting a potential role of \u03b2-AR blockers in the treatment of patients suffering from HF and chronic obstructive airway diseases.", 
    "109": "\u03b2-Adrenoceptors (\u03b2-ARs) modulate ERK1/2 and p38 in different cells, but little is known about the contribution of these signaling pathways to the function of \u03b2-ARs in vascular tissue. Immunoblotting analysis of rat aortic rings, primary endothelial (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) isolated from aorta showed that \u03b2-AR stimulation with isoprenaline activated p38 in aortic rings and in both cultured cell types, whereas it had a dual effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation, decreasing it in ECs while increasing it in SMCs. These effects were reversed by propranolol, which by itself increased p-ERK1/2 in ECs. Isoprenaline \u03b2-AR mediated vasodilation of aortic rings was potentiated by the ERK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, in the presence or absence of endothelium or L-NAME, whereas inhibition of p38 had no impact. Isoprenaline moderately decreased sprouting from aorta rings in the Matrigel angiogenesis assay; conversely propranolol not only prevented isoprenaline inhibition, but stimulated angiogenesis. ERK1/2 inhibition decreased angiogenesis, while a dramatic stimulation was observed by p38 blockade. Our results suggest that ERK1/2 activation after \u03b2-ARs stimulation in the smooth muscle hinders the vasodilator effect of isoprenaline, but in the endothelium \u03b2-ARs decreases ERK1/2 and increases p38 activity reducing therefore angiogenesis.", 
    "110": "The aims of the present study were to investigate, in diabetes mellitus (DM), the mechanism of NOX4 up-regulation, its link with 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inactivation and transforming growth factor (TGF) \u00df-1 signaling in determining the accumulation of kidney extracellular matrix (ECM), and the possible action of cocoa enriched with polyphenols (CH) in these events. After 16 weeks of DM, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed increased kidney TGF\u03b2-1 levels and expression of phosphorylated smad2, collagen IV and fibronectin in parallel with elevated NOX4 expression and reduced phosphorylated AMPK. CH treatment in diabetic rats prevented all of these abnormalities. In immortalized human mesangial cells exposed to high glucose (HG), or TGF\u03b2-1, CH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate blocker, or silencing NOX4 ameliorated enhanced phosphorylated smad2 and collagen IV. Reduction in phosphorylated AMPK induced by HG or TGF\u03b2-1 was ameliorated by CH or activation of AMPK, which reduced phosphorylation of smad2 and collagen IV via reduction in NOX4 expression. The effects of CH were abolished by AMPK blockade. These results suggest that inactivation in AMPK leads to NOX4 up-regulation, activation of TGF\u03b2-1 signaling and increased ECM accumulation. Additionally, increased TGF-\u00df1 per se leads to the amplification of ECM production by reducing AMPK and promoting the activation of NOX4. It is suggested that the activation of AMPK by CH followed by reduction in NOX4/TGF\u03b2-1 signaling may have a therapeutic potential in diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "111": "Column selection in reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) can become a challenge if the target compounds interact with the silica-based packing. One of such interactions is the attraction of cationic solutes to the free silanols in silica-based columns, which is a slow sorption-desorption interaction process that gives rise to tailed and broad peaks. The effect of silanols is minimised by the addition of a competing agent in the mobile phase, such as the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). In micellar-organic RPLC, the adsorption of an approximately fixed amount of SDS monomers gives rise to a stable modified stationary phase, with properties remarkably different from those of the underlying bonded phase. The chromatographic behaviour (in terms of selectivity, analysis time and peak shape) of eight C18 columns in the analysis of weakly acidic phenols and basic \u03b2-blockers was examined with hydro-organic and micellar-organic mobile phases. The behaviour of the columns differed significantly when the cationic basic drugs were eluted with hydro-organic mobile phases. With micellar-organic mobile phases, the adsorption of surfactant, instead of making the columns similar, gave rise to a greater diversity of behaviours (especially in terms of selectivity and analysis time), for both groups of phenols and \u03b2-blockers, which should be explained by the residual effect of the underlying bonded stationary phase and the different amount of surfactant covering the packing. Therefore, the implementation of a micellar-organic procedure in RPLC will depend significantly on the selected type of C18 column.", 
    "112": "In micellar liquid chromatography (MLC), chromatographic peaks are more evenly distributed compared to conventional reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). This is the reason that most procedures are implemented using isocratic elution. However, gradient elution may be still useful in MLC to analyse mixtures of compounds within a wide range of polarities, decreasing the analysis time. Also, it benefits the determination of moderately to low polar compounds in physiological fluids performing direct injection: an initial micellar eluent with a low organic solvent content, or a pure micellar (without surfactant) solution, will provide better protection of the column against the proteins in the physiological fluid, and once the proteins are swept away, the elution strength can be increased using a positive linear gradient of organic solvent to reduce the analysis time. This work aims to encourage analysts to implement gradients of organic solvent in MLC, which is rather simple and allows rapid analytical procedures without pre-treatment or the need of re-equilibration. The implementation of gradient elution is illustrated through the separation of eight basic compounds (\u03b2-blockers) in urine samples directly injected into the chromatograph, the most hydrophobic showing large retention in both conventional RPLC and MLC. The use of the DryLab(\u00ae) software to optimise gradients of organic solvent with eluents containing a fixed amount of surfactant above the critical micellar concentration is shown to provide satisfactory predictions, and can facilitate greatly the implementation of gradient protocols.", 
    "113": "In this work, the potential of electrochemical oxidation as a tool for the rapid prediction of transformation products in water appearing after ozonation is investigated. These two approaches were compared by choosing the two environmentally relevant model compounds diclofenac and metoprolol and comparison of their transformation products after electrochemical oxidation and treatment with ozone. Within these two approaches, certain similarities were observed in the resulting chromatograms: Six transformation products of the electrochemical oxidation of metoprolol were also detected in the ozone samples. For diclofenac two transformation products matched. Additionally, five of the electrochemically generated oxidation products were reported in literature to occur after water treatment processes. The application of a boron-doped diamond working electrode for electrochemical oxidation allowed the generation of hydroxyl radicals, which was shown by spin trapping experiments with p-chlorobenzoic acid. This allowed the generation of certain transformation products previously not obtained by electrochemical oxidation. Concluding, the hyphenation of electrochemistry with liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry offers a useful tool in transformation studies.", 
    "114": "Some reports have outlined many different treatment strategies for superior oblique myokymia (SOM) that attempt to reduce or eliminate patients' symptoms of monocular oscillopsia and/or diplopia. Most treatment strategies have focused solely on oral medications or invasive surgery. The following is a current and critical review of SOM along with its clinical findings/symptoms, demographics, theories of its pathogenesis, management/treatment options, new observations in SOM, as well as a case report to highlight a relatively novel idea for the treatment of SOM: topical timolol eye drops. It also highlights evidence of a new \"localized theory\" regarding topical \u03b2-blockers' mechanism of action in SOM compared to the previous systemic hypothesis proposed in 1994. The case report shows a 29-year-old female patient who suffered with SOM symptoms for 8-10 years and then experienced a worsening of her symptoms shortly postpartum. The patient was prescribed topical timolol eye drops by the author in the affected eye based on one case report(12) from 1994, which completely eliminated her symptoms within 1-2 days of starting the treatment with any recurrence with the daily use of the drop at the time of this article. Given the robust effect in this case, topical timolol may be a potentially useful drug in the management of SOM given its affordability and safer side effect profile in comparison to the oral medications traditionally used in SOM.",

Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) acts as a growth factor for keratinocyte proliferation. The aim of this study is to investigate whether FGF10 blockage, a new monoclonal antibody against FGF10 we generated, could mitigate topical propranolol-induced psoriasis-like lesions in guinea pigs.", 
    "116": "The monoclonal anti-FGF10 was generated by a routine method and purified by affinity chromatography. The effect of FGF10 and anti-FGF10 on human keratinocyte HaCaT cell proliferation was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). The back of the ears of individual guinea pigs was topically exposed to 5% propranolol emulsion to induce psoriasis-like lesions and randomly treated topically with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), hydrocortisone butyrate, or different doses of anti-FGF10. The pathologic changes and the degrees of inflammation in the auricular areas of individual animals were examined histologically.", 
    "117": "Characterization revealed that anti-FGF10 had a purity of 90% and a titer of 1:12800. We found that FGF10 stimulated HaCaT cell proliferation while treatment with different doses of anti-FGF10 inhibited FGF10-induced cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (100, 200 ng/ml, p < 0.05 vs. control; 400, 800, 1600 ng/ml, p < 0.01 vs. control). Compared to PBS-treated psoriatic animals, treatment with anti-FGF10, like hydrocortisone butyrate, greatly inhibited the severity of psoriasis-like lesions by reducing the Baker's scores, the thickness of epidermis, and the numbers of monocyte infiltrates in the dermis of animals.", 
    "118": "The newly generated anti-FGF10 monoclonal antibody inhibited the proliferation of human keratinocytes in vitro and mitigated inflammation and pathogenic changes in propranolol-induced psoriasis-like lesions in animals. Therefore, these findings may provide a proof of principle that blockage of FGF-10 may inhibit psoriasis-related inflammation.",

After cataract surgery, 25 patients received a single instillation of timolol 0.1% gel (group A); 20 a single instillation of timolol 0.5% eyedrops (group B); and 25 no treatment (group C). The IOP was measured before surgery (T0) and 5 minutes (T1), 2 hours \u00b1 30 minutes (T2), 4 hours \u00b1 30 minutes (T3), and 24 hours \u00b1 180 minutes after surgery (T4).",

    "123": "When faced with stress, animals use physiological and cellular strategies to preserve homeostasis. We were interested in how these high-level stress responses are integrated at the level of the whole animal. Here, we investigated the capacity of the physiological stress response, and specifically the \u03b2-adrenergic response, to affect the induction of the cellular heat shock proteins, HSPs, following a thermal stress in vivo. We predicted that blocking \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation during an acute heat stress in the whole animal would result in reduced levels of HSPs in red blood cells (RBCs) of rainbow trout compared to animals where adrenergic signaling remained intact. We first determined that a 1 h heat shock at 25 \u00b0C in trout acclimated to 13 \u00b0C resulted in RBC adrenergic stimulation as determined by a significant increase in cell swelling, a hallmark of the \u03b2-adrenergic response. A whole animal injection with the \u03b22-adrenergic antagonist, ICI-118,551, successfully reduced this heat-induced RBC swelling. The acute heat shock caused a significant induction of HSP70 in RBCs of 13 \u00b0C-acclimated trout as well as a significant increase in plasma catecholamines. When heat-shocked fish were treated with ICI-118,551, we observed a significant attenuation of the HSP70 response. We conclude that circulating catecholamines influence the cellular heat shock response in rainbow trout RBCs, demonstrating physiological/hormonal control of the cellular stress response.", 
    "124": "Previous studies demonstrate that skin wounds generate epinephrine (EPI) that can activate local adrenergic receptors (ARs), impairing healing. Bacterially derived activators of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) within the wound initiate inflammatory responses and can also impair healing. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that these two pathways crosstalk to one another, using EPI and macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP2) to activate ARs and TLR2, respectively, in human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and neonatal keratinocytes (NHKs). BM-MSCs exposed to EPI significantly (p < .05) increased TLR2 message (sevenfold BM-MSCs), TLR2 protein (twofold), and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) (fourfold). Conversely, activation of TLR2 by MALP2 in these cells increased \u03b22-AR message (twofold in BM-MSCs, 2.7-fold in NHKs), \u03b22-AR protein (2.5-fold), phosphorylation of \u03b2-AR-activated kinase (p-BARK, twofold), and induced release of EPI from both cell types (twofold). Treating cells with EPI and MALP2 together, as would be encountered in a wound, increased \u03b22-AR and p-BARK protein expression (sixfold), impaired cell migration (BM-MSCs- 21%\u2193 and NHKs- 60%\u2193, p < .002), and resulted in a 10-fold (BM-MSCs) and 51-fold (NHKs) increase in release of IL-6 (p < .001) responses that were remarkably reduced by pretreatment with \u03b22-AR antagonists. In vivo, EPI-stressed animals exhibited impaired healing, with elevated levels of TLR2, MyD88, and IL-6 in the wounds (p < .05) relative to nonstressed controls. Thus, our data describe a recipe for decreasing cell migration and exacerbating inflammation via novel crosstalk between the adrenergic and Toll-like receptor pathways in BM-MSCs and NHKs.",

This study aimed to investigate the role of miRNA let-7e in the up-regulation of \u03b2(1) -AR and arrhythmogenesis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in rats. \u03b2(1) -AR expression was significantly up-regulated and let-7a, c, d, e and i were markedly down-regulated in the infarcted heart after 6 and 24 hrs myocardial infarction. Forced expression of let-7e suppressed \u03b2(1) -AR expression at the protein level, without affecting \u03b2(1) -AR mRNA level, in neonatal rat ventricular cells (NRVCs). Silencing of let-7e by let-7e antisense inhibitor (AMO-let-7e) enhanced \u03b2(1) -AR expression at the protein level in NRVCs. Administration of the lentivirus vector containing precursor let-7e (len-pre-let-7e) significantly inhibited \u03b2(1) -AR expression in rats, whereas len-AMO-let-7e up-regulated \u03b2(1) -AR relative to the baseline control level, presumably as a result of depression of tonic inhibition of \u03b2(1) -AR by endogenous let-7e. Len-negative control (len-NC) did not produce significant influence on \u03b2(1) -AR expression. Len-pre-let-7e also profoundly reduced the up-regulation of \u03b2(1) -AR induced by AMI and this effect was abolished by len-AMO-let-7e. Importantly, len-pre-let-7e application significantly reduced arrhythmia incidence after AMI in rats and its anti-arrhythmic effect was cancelled by len-AMO-let-7e. Notably, anti-arrhythmic efficacy of len-pre-let-7e was similar to propranolol, a non-selective \u03b2-AR blocker and metoprolol, a selective \u03b2(1) -AR blocker. Down-regulation of let-7e contributes to the adverse increase in \u03b2(1) -AR expression in AMI and let-7e supplement may be a new therapeutic approach for preventing adverse \u03b2(1) -AR up-regulation and treating AMI-induced arrhythmia.",

Ischemia was assessed at the per-patient and per-vessel levels.

The physical properties of the prepared suppositories were characterized such as weight variation, hardness, disintegration time, melting range and the drug content uniformity. The in vitro release of MT from the prepared suppositories was carried out. The evaluation of the pharmacological effects of MT on the blood pressure and heart rate of the healthy rabbits after the rectal administration compared to the oral tablets was studied. Moreover, the formulation with the highest in vitro release and the highest pharmacological effects would be selected for a further pharmacokinetics study compared to the oral tablets. The results revealed that the emulsion bases gave the highest rate of the drug release than the other bases used. The reduction effect of the emulsion MT suppository base on the blood pressure and heart rate was found to be faster and greater than that administered orally. The selected emulsion suppository base (F11) showed a significant increase in the AUC (1.88-fold) in rabbits as compared to the oral tablets. From the above results we can conclude that rectal route can serve as an efficient alternative route to the oral one for systemic delivery of MT which may be due to the avoidance of first-pass effect in the liver.",

This leads to the need to elaborate novel approaches to treating HF. The latter is obviously due to impaired myocardial energy substrate metabolism. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are numerous and complex. These include reduced myocardial expression and activity of key free fatty acid oxidative enzymes. The expression of these enzymes is controlled by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-alpha (PPAR-alpha). Thus, PPAR-alpha activation is a direct method to regulate myocardial fatty acid metabolism. Evidence for the efficiency of therapeutic strategies based on the fact that fatty acid metabolism may be modulated is controversial, which indicates that there may be more complex molecular/biochemical changes than supposed before.

In vitro and in silico tools were used to evaluate the influence of media viscosity on drug bioperformance under fasted and fed conditions. The obtained results demonstrated that increased medium viscosity in the presence of food is one of the key factors limiting oral absorption of drugs with limited permeability and absorption restricted to the upper parts of the intestine, while having negligible effect on pharmacokinetic profile of drugs with pH- and site-independent absorption.

Indirect estimation of central aortic pressures is obtained by the study of the radial pulse wave compared with a central pulse wave contour measured at the carotid or femoral artery level. The sum of the forward pressure wave created by ventricular contraction and of the reflected pressure wave from the peripheral arterial system produce the peak systolic blood pressure in the aorta. Measurement of the peripheral reflected-wave contribution to aortic blood pressure can be quantified as the augmentation index. Also, the increase in the rapidity of this travelling wave can be measured as the pulse wave velocity. These 2 parameters are considered to be valid indices of the peripheral arterial stiffness. Along with the calculation of systolic and diastolic aortic pressures, these measurements can give a better understanding of the actual central blood pressure to which core organs like heart, brain, and kidneys are submitted.

    "182": "Current evidence discourages any attempt to discontinue RAAS inhibitors or beta-blockers in patients with stable HF, regardless of clinical and/or echocardiographic status. Formal withdrawal trials of other classes are needed.", 
    "183": "This study sought to determine whether circadian patterns in ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) occur in a current primary prevention defibrillator (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [ICD]) population.", 
    "184": "Cardiovascular events, including VAs, demonstrate biorhythmic periodicity.", 
    "185": "We tested for deviation from the previously described occurrences of a morning peak, early morning nadir, and peak on Mondays in ICD therapies using generalized estimating equations and Student t tests. All hypothesis tests were performed in the entire cohort of patients with VAs as well as pre-specified subgroups.", 
    "186": "Of 811 patients with an ICD, 186 subjects experienced 714 ICD therapy episodes for life-threatening VA. There was no morning (6 am to 12 pm) peak in therapies for the entire cohort or any subgroups. The overall cohort and several subgroups had a typical early morning (12 am to 6 am) nadir in therapies, with significantly less than 25% of therapies occurring during this 6-h block (all p < 0.05). A significant peak in therapies on Mondays occurred only in patients not on beta-blocker therapy (22% of events for the week, p = 0.029).", 
    "187": "In the SCD-HeFT (Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial) population, the distribution of life-threatening VA failed to show a typical early morning peak or increased VA events on Mondays. A typical early morning nadir was seen in the entire cohort. An increased rate of events on Mondays was found in the subgroup of subjects not on beta-blocker therapy. These findings may indicate suppression of the neurohormonal triggers for VA by current heart failure therapy, particularly the use of beta-blockers in heart failure.", 
    "188": "To evaluate the adequacy of atrial fibrillation (AF) management 6 years after the establishment of a coordinated AF Unit.", 
    "189": "Patients with AF attended during 14 consecutive days in the Emergency Room, Internal Medicine, Neurology and Arrhythmia departments of a tertiary hospital, and 3 primary health care centers of the same urban health care area were included. Treatment for AF and its adequacy to current clinical guidelines, tests performed and knowledge about the arrhythmia were evaluated. Results were compared with a population of 239 patients treated 6 years earlier.", 
    "190": "One hundred and sixty-eight patients were included. Knowledge of the arrhythmia improved. The adequacy of treatment (rate control, rhythm control and antithrombotic prophylaxis) remained at the same level as in the previous period in all areas. The adequacy of thromboprophylaxis was negatively associated with advanced age (P < .001) and positively associated with knowledge of arrhythmia (P = .026).", 
    "191": "Treatment of AF in a coordinated health area remains appropriate 6 years after the establishment of a coordinated AF unit. Elderly patients are still poorly anticoagulated. Health education may improve this deficit."
