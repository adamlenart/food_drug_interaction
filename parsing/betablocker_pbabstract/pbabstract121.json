As a result beta-blocking medication is routinely administered before investigation. In the present study, the use, contraindications, and efficacy of prescan beta blockade with regard to HR reduction and CTA image quality were assessed. In 537 patients referred for CTA, the baseline HR and blood pressure were measured on arrival, and contraindications for beta blockade were noted. Unless contraindicated, a single dose of metoprolol was administered orally 1 hour before data acquisition in patients with a HR of > or =65 beats/min according to a predefined medication protocol. After 1 hour, the HR was remeasured. A total of 283 patients (53%) had a HR of > or =65 beats/min. In this group, beta blockade was contraindicated in 46 patients (16%). Metoprolol was administered to the remaining 237 patients. However, 26 patients (11%) received suboptimal (lower dose than prescribed by protocol) beta blockade because of contraindications. Of the 211 patients receiving optimal beta blockade, 57 (27%) did not achieve the target HR. Of the patients with contraindications to beta blockade, 43 (60%) did not achieve the target HR. Compared to patients with optimal HR control, those receiving no or suboptimal beta blockade because of contraindications had significantly fewer examinations of good image quality (40% vs 74%, p <0.001), and significantly more examinations of poor image quality (20% vs 6%, p <0.001). In conclusion, most patients require HR reduction before CTA. Contraindications to beta blockade are present in a substantial proportion of patients. This results in suboptimal HR control and image quality, indicating the need for alternative approaches for HR reduction.",

We used stratified Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the multivariate-adjusted effect of propranolol compared to other BBs and controlled for demographic variables, risk factors for myopathy, other comorbidities, and health service use measures.

    "13": "The influence of the BGE composition, including the addition of a single-isomer sulfated beta-CD derivative, on the ionization performance of the model compound carvedilol in NACE-ESI-MS was studied using an alternative infusion method. This approach employs voltage-induced infusion of the BGE containing the analyte, and takes into account the effects of variations in EOF and effective analyte mobility on the ESI-MS intensity. First, the optimal composition of the sheath liquid for CE-MS in terms of signal abundance and stability was determined. The BGE ammonium formate, acetate, and camphorsulfonate were found to have similar effects on analyte ionization. Addition of single-isomer sulfated beta-CD derivatives (available as sodium salt) to the BGE revealed that the anionic CD derivatives did not give rise to the same ionization suppression effect. This result can be attributed to differences in the dissociation state of these sodium salts. Finally, it is shown that information about chiral selectivity can also be obtained with the applied infusion method.",

Infantile hemangioma develops during the first weeks of life, usually builds up over 3 to 6 months, and then regresses very slowly over a period of 3 to 7 years. Three quarters of these hemangiomas are lobular and are not associated with malformations. On the other hand, the hemangiomas referred to as segmental may be associated with developmental abnormalities (PHACES and PELVIS/SACRAL syndromes). Because of their spontaneous involution, most infantile hemangiomas do not require therapeutic intervention. In 10 to 15 % of cases, treatment is necessary because of complications when life or physiological functioning is threatened, or there are local complications or the long-term esthetic risk is too high. Until now, the standard first-line treatment has been general corticosteroid therapy. The usual choice for second-line treatment is interferon or vincristine.

Episcleral vein cauterization in unilateral eyes of Wistar rats was performed to produce elevated IOP. The animals were divided into five groups: control, experimental, and experimental treated with timolol, latanoprost or brimonidine. Histological sections of retina were studied by immunochemistry with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and the percentage of labeled area was measured to evaluate the degree of reactive gliosis. In the experimental group, the M\u00fcller cells showed hypertrophy and a significant increase in GFAP (4.39+/-0.32%) in relation to retinas of the control group (2.05+/-0.14%). Gliosis was detected in all three treated groups, with a varying increase in GFAP intensity. The timolol-treated group showed the most intense and persistent glial reactivity after 3 months of treatment (13.89+/-0.63%). Treatment with brimonidine, however, resulted in a decrease in the level of GFAP immunoreactivity (8.37+/-0.4%). The group treated with latanoprost showed the lowest glial reactivity (4.8+/-0.36%). Given that all three drugs are effective hypotensive agents, their neuroprotective effect could be related with other factors, such as gliosis, which, over long periods may have noxious effects on the neurons. Thus, hypotensives like brimonidine, and specially latanoprost, may afford greater neuroprotection to the ganglion cells by attenuating the retinal glial reaction.", 
    "17": "In this work, a capillary electrophoresis (CE) procedure was developed for the simultaneous determination of a pharmaceutical drug and its counter-ion, namely labetalol hydrochloride. For this purpose, an uncoated fused-silica capillary, a low conductivity background electrolyte (BGE) and a capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detector (C(4)D) were employed. This detection system is highly sensitive and enables detection of inorganic as well as organic ions unlike with direct UV detection. Moreover, to be able to simultaneously analyze the cationic drug (labetalol(+)) and its anionic counter-ion (Cl(-)) in the same electrophoretic run without the need of a coated capillary, a dual-opposite end injection was performed. In this technique, the sample is hydrodynamically injected into both ends of the capillary. This method is simple and easy to perform since the different injection steps are automated by the CE software. This novel CE-C(4)D procedure with dual-opposite end injection has been successfully validated and applied for the analysis of chloride content in an adrenergic antagonist (labetalol hydrochloride). Thus, the hereby developed method has been shown to enable fast (analysis time<10 min), precise (repeatability of migration times<0.7% and of corrected-peak areas < 3.3%; n=6) and rugged analyses for the simultaneous determination of a pharmaceutical drug and its counter-ion.",

Change in peak VO(2) after OLT (Delta peak VO(2)) was related to changes in hemoglobin level (r(2)=0.45, p=0.04), the stopping of beta-blocker therapy, and muscle impairment, as suggested by the correlation between Delta peak VO(2) and peak lactate concentration before OLT (r(2)=0.64, p<0.01).",

This report describes a middle-aged woman in whom hyperthyroidism and Still's disease developed concurrently. During the course of her illness, the hyperthyroidism was observed to be aggravated whenever her AOSD was in the active stage. After her AOSD activity was controlled, her hyperthyroidism improved clinically. The extent of activation of her hyperthyroidism was observed in parallel to the extent of activation of her AOSD. Furthermore, the patient developed neutropenia after receiving either propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole, both of which are standard accepted medications for treatment of hyperthyroidism. Immune mechanisms contributed to PTU induced neutropenia have been proposed, and hyperthyroid patients treated with standard antithyroid agents should be monitored for blood cell counts especially for AOSD patients. Corticosteroid may effect Graves' disease activity, and steroids may play a role in the treatment of hyperthyroidism if a patient had drug allergies to antithyroid agents.", 
    "27": "Myocardial ischemia is a frequent complication in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery and beta-blockers may exert a protective effect. The main benefit of beta-blockers in perioperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is believed to be linked to specific effects on myocardial oxygen supply and demand. beta-blockers may exert anti-inflammatory and anti-arrhythmic effects. Randomized clinical trials which evaluated the effects of beta-blockers on all-cause mortality in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery have yielded conflicting results. In 9 trials, 10,544 patients with non-cardiac surgery were randomized to beta-blockers (n = 5274) or placebo (n = 5270) and there were a total of 304 deaths. Patients randomized to beta-blockers group showed a 19% increased risk of all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95-1.50; p = 0.135). However, trials included in the meta-analysis differed in several aspects, and a significant degree of heterogeneity (I( 2) = 46.5%) was noted. A recent analysis showed that the surgical risk category had a substantial influence on the overall estimate of the effect of beta-blockers. Compared with patients in the intermediate-high-surgical-risk category, those in the high-risk category showed a 73% reduction in the risk of total mortality with beta-blockers compared with placebo (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10-0.71, p = 0.016). These data suggest that perioperative beta-blockers confer a benefit which is mostly limited to patients undergoing high-risk surgery.",

The microspheres were prepared by emulsification-cross-linking method and evaluated for size, shape, entrapment efficiency (EE), in vitro mucoadhesion, in vitro drug release, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The mucoadhesive properties were also evaluated by Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms. In vivo tests were carried out in rabbits. The microspheres were spherical with size of 20-50 microm, which is favorable for intranasal absorption. The EE was observed from 42% to 68% while percentage mucoadhesion was from 74% to 88%. A strong interaction between mucin and chitosan microspheres was detected explaining adsorption with electrostatic interaction. The microspheres released around 75% of drug in 8 h. DSC and XRD studies revealed that CRV was molecularly dispersed. The absorption rate was rapid and the absolute bioavailability was high, 72.29%. The gamma scintigraphy indicated that the microspheres cleared slowly from the nasal cavity. It was concluded that chitosan microspheres could be used to deliver CRV following nasal administration for improving the bioavailability.", 
    "29": "Standard microelectrode technique was used to study electrical activity of the isolated heart of the polychaete annelid, Arenicola marina. Typical pacemaker activity with slow diastolic depolarization was observed in all recordings. The average maximum diastolic potential (-58.4 +/- 3.2 mV), the average amplitude of the action potential (28.7 +/- 4.7 mV) and the average total duration of the action potential (2,434 +/- 430 ms) were determined. There has been no gradient of automaticity observed in our studies, which suggests that all regions of the Arenicola heart could possess pacemaker functions. Acetylcholine (ACh) produced a concentration dependent (5 x 10(-8)-5 x 10(-5) M) increase of the beating rate via increase in the rate of the diastolic depolarization. ACh (5 x 10(-5) M) increased beating rate by 2.5-fold compared to the control rate. A stronger action of ACh resulted in depolarization, block of action potential generation and contracture of the heart. The non-hydrolysable ACh analog carbacholine (10(-8)-10(-6) M) produced similar effects. All effects of ACh and carbacholine were abolished by 5 x 10(-6) M atropine. D-Tubocurarine (5 x 10(-5) M) did not significantly alter effects of ACh or carbacholine. Epinephrine (10(-8)-10(-6) M) caused the slowing of pacemaker activity and marked decrease of action potential duration. 10(-6) M epinephrine produced complete cardiac arrest. The effects of epinephrine were not significantly altered by the beta-blocker propranolol (5 x 10(-6) M). The beta-agonist isoproterenol (10(-7)-10(-5) M) and the alpha-agonist xylometazoline (10(-6)-10(-5) M) did not produce significant effects. Thus, cholinergic effects in the Arenicola heart are likely to be mediated via muscarinic receptors, while the nature of adrenergic effects needs further investigation.", 
    "30": "The purpose of the study was to investigate whether carvedilol has an antiproliferative effect alone and whether carvedilol provides an additive, synergistic or antagonistic effect on imatinib mesylate-induced cytotoxicity in both C6 glioma monolayer and spheroid culture. The C6 rat glioma chemoresistant experimental brain tumour cell line, that is notoriously difficult to treat with combination chemotherapy, was used both in monolayer and spheroid cultures. We treated C6 glioma cells with carvedilol alone and a combination of carvedilol and imatinib mesylate at a concentration of 10 microM. Following treatment, we evaluated cell proliferation index, bromodeoxyuridine labelling index (BrDU-LI), cell cycle distributions, apoptotic cell percentages, cAMP levels and three dimensional cell morphology at monolayer cultures. In addition BrDU-LI, volume and morphology of spheroids were also assessed. Carvedilol and imatinib mesylate alone reduced cell number, BrDU-LI, cAMP levels and spheroid volume. Carvedilol and imatinib mesylate arrested cells at G0/G1 phase in a time-dependent manner and time-independent manner, respectively. Carvedilol increased apoptosis rate only at the 24th h, but imatinib mesylate did for all time intervals. Interestingly carvedilol, drug with well-known protective effect on mitochondria, induced severe mitochondria damage, and imatinib mesylate induced autophagy confirmed only by transmission electron microscopy. These results suggest that carvedilol showed antitumour activity against rat C6 glioma cells and a combination of carvedilol with imatinib mesylate resulted in enhanced in vitro antitumour activity.",

It possesses a high content of avonoid derivatives, the most abundant of which is puerarin. Our goal was to find the effect of puerarin on cytochrome P450 enzymes in vivo. The study was conducted in 18 male volunteers of different genotypes (CYP2D6 *1/*1, *1/*10, *10/*10). Plasma was obtained at 6 h after oral administration and urine was collected from 0 to 8 h after probe drug administration. The logarithm value of metabolic rate decrease from -0.0055 +/- 0.1887 to -0.1754 +/- 0.2411 implied puerarin inhibited activity of CYP2D6. There was no significant relationship between the inhibition with the CYP2D6 genotypes. The paraxanthin/caffeine ratio in the plasma sample at 6th hour was increased by 30 +/- 47% (p = 0.003), implied puerarin induced the activity of CYP1A2. While puerarin used together with the substrates of both enzymes, drug interaction worth the attention and at sometimes precautions are needed.", 
    "51": "Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), also known as CCN2, is implicated in fibrosis through both extracellular matrix (ECM) induction and inhibition of ECM degradation. The role of CTGF in inflammation in cardiomyocytes is unknown. In some mesenchymal cell systems, CTGF mediates effects through TGF-beta or tyrosine kinase cell surface receptor, TrkA, signalling. In this study, cellular mechanisms by which CTGF regulates pathways involved in fibrosis and inflammation were explored. Murine H9c2 cardiomyocytes were treated with recombinant human (rh)CTGF and ECM formation gene expression: fibronectin, collagen type -I and -III and ECM degradation genes: TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and PAI-1 were found to be induced. CTGF treatment also increased pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6, MCP-1 and IL-8. CTGF upregulated TGF-beta1 mRNA and rapidly induced phosphorylation of TrkA. The CTGF-induced pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory effects were blocked by anti-TGF-beta neutralizing antibody and Alk 5 inhibitor (SB431542). A specific blocker of TrkA activation, k252a, also abrogated CTGF-induced effects on fibrosis and gene expresison of MCP-1 and IL-8, but not TNF-alpha or IL-6. Collectively, this data implicates CTGF in effects on pro-fibrotic genes and pro-inflammatory genes via TGF-beta pathway signalling and partly through TrkA.", 
    "52": "To understand the role of mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP) in regulating insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis, we created transgenicDrosophila lines with targeted UCP expression in insulin producing cells (IPCs). Increased UCP activity in IPCs results in decreased steady state Ca(2+) levels in IPCs as well as decreased PI3K activity and increased FoxO nuclear localization in periphery. This reduced systemic insulin signaling is accompanied by a mild hyperglycemia and extended life span. To test the hypothesis that ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels may link changes in metabolic activity (e.g., glucose mediated ATP production or UCP-mediated ATP reduction) with insulin secretion, we characterized the effects of glucose and a specific K(ATP) channel blocker, glibenclamide on membrane potential in adult IPCs. Exposure to glucose depolarizes membrane potential of IPCs and this effect is mimicked with glibenclamide, suggesting that K(ATP) channels contribute to the mechanism whereby IPCs sense changes in circulating sugar. Further, as demonstrated in mammalian beta-pancreatic cells, high glucose initiates a robust Ca(2+) influx in adult IPCs. The presence of functional K(ATP) channels in adult IPCs is further substantiated by in situ hybridization detecting the transcript for the sulfonylurea receptor (Sur) subunit of the K(ATP) channel in those cells. Quantitative expression analysis demon-strates a reduction in transcripts for both Sur and the inward rectifying potassium channel (Kir) subunits when IPCs are partially ablated. In summary, we have demonstrated a role for UCP in adult Drosophila IPCs in influencing systemic insulin signaling and longevity by a mechanism that may involve K(ATP) channels.", 
    "53": "Peak broadening and skewness are fundamental parameters in chromatography, since they affect the resolution capability of a chromatographic column. A common practice to characterise chromatographic columns is to estimate the efficiency and asymmetry factor for the peaks of one or more solutes eluted at selected experimental conditions. This has the drawback that the extra-column contributions to the peak variance and skewness make the peak shape parameters depend on the retention time. We propose and discuss here the use of several approaches that allow the estimation of global parameters (non-dependent on the retention time) to describe the column performance. The global parameters arise from different linear relationships that can be established between the peak variance, standard deviation, or half-widths with the retention time. Some of them describe exclusively the column contribution to the peak broadening, whereas others consider the extra-column effects also. The estimation of peak skewness was also possible for the approaches based on the half-widths. The proposed approaches were applied to the characterisation of different columns (Spherisorb, Zorbax SB, Zorbax Eclipse, Kromasil, Chromolith, X-Terra and Inertsil), using the chromatographic data obtained for several diuretics and basic drugs (beta-blockers).", 
    "54": "Evidence indicates that the monoamine neurotransmitter noradrenaline elicits anti-inflammatory actions in the central nervous system (CNS), and consequently may play a neuroprotective role where inflammatory events contribute to CNS pathology. Here we examined the ability of pharmacologically enhancing central noradrenergic tone to induce expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines in rat brain. Administration of the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor reboxetine (15mg/kg; ip) combined with the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (1mg/kg; ip) induced interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression in rat cortex and hippocampus. In addition, these drug treatments induced IL-10 signaling as indicated by increased STAT3 phosphorylation and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) mRNA expression. In contrast to the profound increase in IL-10 induced by the reboxetine/idazoxan combination, the other two broad spectrum anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and TGF-beta were not induced by this treatment. The ability of combined treatment with reboxetine and idazoxan to induce IL-10 and SOCS3 expression was mediated by beta-adrenoceptor activation, as their induction was blocked by pre-treatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. Moreover, administration of the brain penetrant beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in central IL-10 and SOCS3 expression, and the ability of clenbuterol to induce IL-10 and SOCS-3 expression was blocked by the centrally acting beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, and was mimicked by the highly selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist formoterol. In all, these data indicate that increasing central noradrenergic tone induces IL-10 production and signaling in the CNS, which may protect against neurodegeneration.",

Gap junction protein, connexin (Cx), is expressed in the endothelial cells of vessels, glomerulus, and renin-secreting cells of the kidney. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of Cx in renin release using Cx-overexpressing As 4.1 cells. The adenovirus-induced Cx overexpression was conducted by using recombinant adenovirus containing the cDNA encoding Cx37, Cx40, Cx43 (Ad-Cx), and beta-galactosidase (Ad-beta-gal). In 40-overexpressing cells, basal renin release increased in a time-dependent manner but it was significantly lower than that in Ad-beta-gal-treated cells. In Cx37- and Cx43-overexpressing cells, basal renin release was increased in a time-dependent manner, which was not different from control cells. 18-beta glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), a gap junction blocker, stimulated renin release dose-dependently and increased intracellular Ca(2+) in both Cx43-overexpressing cells and control cells. However, no significant differences were observed. An increase in renin release by 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid 8-(diethylamino)-octyl ester, a putative antagonist of Ca(2+) release from intracellular sequestration sites, was also similar between two groups. These results suggest that Cx43 may unlikely alter the regulation of renin release and intracellular Ca(2+) by gap junction blocker in As 4.1 cells.", 
    "73": "The biguanides, phenformin and metformin, are used in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus, as well as being routinely used in studies investigating AMPK activity. We used the patch-clamp technique and rubidium flux assays to determine the role of these drugs in ATP-sensitive K+ channel (K(ATP)) regulation in cell lines expressing the cloned components of K(ATP) and the current natively expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Phenformin but not metformin inhibits a number of variants of K(ATP) including the cloned equivalents of currents present in vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle (Kir6.1/SUR2B and Kir6.2/SUR2B) and pancreatic beta-cells (Kir6.2/SUR1). However it does not inhibit the current potentially present in cardiac myocytes (Kir6.2/SUR2A). The highest affinity interaction is seen with Kir6.1/SUR2B (IC50=0.55 mM) and it also inhibits the current in native vascular smooth muscle cells. The extent and rate of inhibition are similar to that seen with the known K(ATP) blocker PNU 37883A. Additionally, phenformin inhibited the current elicited through the Kir6.2DeltaC26 (functional without SUR) channel with an IC50 of 1.78 mM. Phenformin reduced the open probability of Kir6.1/SUR2B channels by approximately 90% in inside-out patches. These findings suggest that phenformin interacts directly with the pore-forming Kir6.0 subunit however the sulphonylurea receptor is able to significantly modulate the affinity. It is likely to block from the intracellular side of the channel in a manner analogous to that of PNU 37883A.",

The method involves a modified precolumn switching methodology replacing the small precolumn with a short C18 liquid chromatography column (50 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm particle size), thus allowing the preconcentration of large water sample volumes whereas interferences eluting at the first of the chromatogram were discarded to waste. This approach allowed to preconcentrate 30 mL river water samples, modified with 0.4% MeOH, achieving univariate method detection and determination limits ranged between 0.03 and 0.16 microg L(-1) and between 0.2 and 0.5 microg L(-1), respectively, with precision values lower than 9.4% for spiking levels at the quantitation limits of each analyte and lower than 4.0%, except bisoprolol (8.3%), for higher spiking levels (1.0 microg L(-1) of all analytes). Matrix background was reduced in three way data by a baseline correction following the Eilers methodology, whereas multivariate curve resolution and alternating least squares in combination with the standard addition calibration method, applied to these data, coped with overlapping peak, systematic (additive) and proportional (matrix effect) errors. The method was successfully applied for the determination of the target pharmaceuticals in river water from three places in a river stream with acceptable recoveries and precision values, taking into account the complexity of the analytical problem. The joint statistical test for the slope and the intercept of the linear regression between the nominal concentration values versus those predicted, showed that the region computed contained the theoretically expected values (0) for the intercept and (1) for the slope (at a confidence level of 95%), which indicates the absence of both constant and proportional errors in the predicted concentrations.",

Among its pathogenetic mechanisms, distal embolization is of prominent importance and several studies have shown that a high coronary thrombotic burden is associated with distal embolization. We aimed at assessing predictors of angiographic thrombus grade in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Ninety-one patients (62 +/- 12 years old, 79% men) presenting for a first STEMI and undergoing urgent coronary angiography within 12 hours from onset of symptoms were consecutively included in the study. Thrombus grade was evaluated by angiography according to the Gibson score and patients were allocated to the high thrombus grade (HTG; score 4 to 5) group or to the low thrombus grade (score 0 to 3) group. Variables predicting angiographic thrombus grade were assessed among clinical, angiographic, procedural, and laboratory data. Sixty-four patients (61 +/- 12 years old, 78% men) presented with HTG, whereas 27 patients (63 +/- 10 years old, 80% men) presented with low thrombus grade.

    "111": "Insulin resistance is associated with obesity and may be accompanied by left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and myocardial remodeling. Decreased insulin metabolic signaling and increased oxidative stress may promote these maladaptive changes. In this context, the beta-blocker nebivolol has been reported to improve insulin sensitivity, increase endothelial NO synthase activity, and reduce NADPH oxidase-induced superoxide generation. We hypothesized that nebivolol would attenuate diastolic dysfunction and myocardial remodeling by blunting myocardial oxidant stress and promoting insulin metabolic signaling in a rodent model of obesity, insulin resistance, and hypertension. Six-week-old male Zucker obese and age-matched Zucker lean rats were treated with nebivolol (10 mg x kg(-) x day(-1)) for 21 days, and myocardial function was assessed by cine MRI. Compared with untreated Zucker lean rats, untreated Zucker obese rats exhibited prolonged diastolic relaxation time (27.7+/-2.5 versus 40.9+/-2.0 ms; P<0.05) and reduced initial diastolic filling rate (6.2+/-0.5 versus 2.8+/-0.6 microL/ms; P<0.05) in conjunction with increased homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (7+/-2 versus 95+/-21; P<0.05), interstitial and pericapillary fibrosis, abnormal cardiomyocyte histoarchitecture, 3-nitrotyrosine, and NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide. Nebivolol improved diastolic relaxation (32.8+/-0.7 ms; P<0.05 versus untreated Zucker obese), reduced fibrosis, and remodeling in Zucker obese rats, in concert with reductions in nitrotyrosine, NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide, and improvements in the insulin metabolic signaling, endothelial NO synthase activation, and weight gain (381+/-7 versus 338+/-14 g; P<0.05). Results support the hypothesis that nebivolol reduces myocardial structural maladaptive changes and improves diastolic relaxation in concert with improvements in insulin sensitivity and endothelial NO synthase activation, concomitantly with reductions in oxidative stress.",

Thereafter, left atrial pressure and individualized therapy instructions guided by these pressures were disclosed to the patient. Event-free survival was determined over a median follow-up of 25 months (range 3 to 38 months). Survival without decompensation was 61% at 3 years, and events tended to be less frequent after the first 3 months (hazard ratio 0.16 [95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.68], P=0.012).

This inhibition of contraction was maintained during ventricular pacing. At 3 mmol/L, esmolol also abolished action potential conduction. To determine the cellular mechanism for the negative inotropism, we measured contraction (sarcomere shortening) and the calcium transient (fura-2 fluorescence ratio; Ca(tr)) in electrically-stimulated rat ventricular myocytes at 23 and 34 degrees C. The decrease in contraction (by 72% at 23 degrees C, from 0.16 +/- 0.01 to 0.04 +/- 0.01 microm, P < 0.001) was similar to that of isolated hearts and was caused by a large decrease in Ca(tr) (from 0.13 +/- 0.02 to 0.07 +/- 0.02, P < 0.001). There was no additional effect on myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity. Esmolol's effects on contraction and Ca(tr) were not shared or altered by the beta-blocker, atenolol (1 mmol/L). Sarcoplasmic reticulum inhibition with thapsigargin did not alter the inhibitory effects of esmolol. Whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments revealed that esmolol inhibited the L-type calcium current (I(Ca,L)) and the fast sodium current (I(Na)), with IC(50) values of 0.45 +/- 0.05 and 0.17 +/- 0.025 mmol/L, respectively.",

A vein draining segment of the upper jejunum was cannulated for blood flow and venous glucose measurements. The left femoral artery and vein were cannulated for arterial blood sampling and drug infusion respectively. Glucose uptake was calculated as a product of jejunal blood flow and the (A-V) glucose difference. The fasting blood glucose levels were 101.0 +/- 8.4 mg/dl and 127.0 +/- 11.3 mg/dl before and after anaesthesia respectively. Basal blood glucose was much higher than this following surgery. The upper jejunum had a resting glucose uptake of 24.1 +/- 7.0 mg/min. When nicotine (50 ug/kg) was infused intravenously, blood glucose rose from a basal value of 253.8 +/- 9.5 mg/dl to 379.8 +/- 20.3 mg/dl at the peak of response. Glucose uptake increased to 73.1 +/- 11.3 mg/min at the peak of response. These effects of nicotine are mediated through both beta and alpha adrenoceptors.

This guideline might induce physicians to increasingly use beta-blockers in the hope of preventing perioperative cardiac complications. However, beta-blockers have potential beneficial effects outside the prevention of cardiac events. In addition to reducing anesthetic and analgesic requirements during the perioperative period, beta-blockers have neuroprotective effects in patients with brain trauma and possible effectiveness in the management of intraoperative awareness-induced post-traumatic stress disorder. Moreover, intrathecal administration of beta-blockers may have antinociceptive effects. Physicians need to bear in mind the benefits of beta-blockers for purposes other than preventing cardiac events when applied in the perioperative period, and they should be familiar with the pharmacodynamics and risk-benefit ratio with their use.

Propranolol use has been examined in three phases of memory, including acquisition, formation, and encoding; emotional response and consolidation; and retrieval and reconsolidation. Early research focused on acquisition and consolidation with encouraging but inconsistent results, with more recent research directed towards memory reconsolidation, and dissociation of emotion and fear from memories. Ethical opposition to this research and therapy came from the President's Council on Bioethics, who argued in Beyond Therapy (2003) that this type of therapy disrupts sense of self, and from a target article and ensuing discussion in theAmerican Journal of Bioethics in 2007. These arguments preceded research on the effects of propranolol on reconsolidation, which impacts the ethical discussion. If propranolol use in dissociation of emotion and fear from memory is effective in individuals with PTSD, much of the argument against propranolol use is moot. Veterans who cannot function in society due to PTSD have essentially already lost their sense of self. The ethical issue is not how treatment may affect them, but whether withholding research and treatment that may alleviate the condition is justifiable.",

    "160": "We previously showed that bilateral vestibular lesion in rats induces a bone loss in weight bearing bones. To determine whether this effect is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), bone mineral density (BMD) was measured in 4 groups of 10 female Wistar rats: bilateral labyrinthectomy (Bilab), Bilab with propranolol treatment, sham operated with or withoutpropranolol. In untreated rats, 30 days after lesion Bilab animals showed a reduced BMD in distal femoral metaphysis comparatively to intact rats (p < 0.001). In treated rats, there was no difference in BMD 30 days after lesion. This protective effect of propranolol against bone loss suggests that the vestibular system influence on bone remodeling is mediated by SNS. If this hypothesis is correct, this could have important consequences in devising countermeasures to spaceflight induced bone loss.",

    "176": "Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a critical form of cellular plasticity that is greatly influenced by neural activity. Among the neurotransmitters that are widely implicated in regulating this process are serotonin and norepinephrine, levels of which are modulated by stress, depression and clinical antidepressants. However, studies to date have failed to address a direct role for either neurotransmitter in regulating hippocampal precursor activity. Here we show that norepinephrine but not serotonin directly activates self-renewing and multipotent neural precursors, including stem cells, from the hippocampus of adult mice. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that beta(3)-adrenergic receptors, which are preferentially expressed on a Hes5-expressing precursor population in the subgranular zone (SGZ), mediate this norepinephrine-dependent activation. Moreover, intrahippocampal injection of a selective beta(3)-adrenergic receptor agonist in vivo increases the number of proliferating cells in the SGZ. Similarly, systemic injection of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol not only results in enhancement of proliferation in the SGZ but also leads to an increase in the percentage of nestin/glial fibrillary acidic protein double-positive neural precursors in vivo. Finally, using a novel ex vivo \"slice-sphere\" assay that maintains an intact neurogenic niche, we demonstrate that antidepressants that selectively block the reuptake of norepinephrine, but not serotonin, robustly increase hippocampal precursor activity via beta-adrenergic receptors. These findings suggest that the activation of neurogenic precursors and stem cells via beta(3)-adrenergic receptors could be a potent mechanism to increase neuronal production, providing a putative target for the development of novel antidepressants.", 
    "177": "Antagonists of the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) impart anti-inflammatory activity even though, paradoxically, CB2 receptors are more predominant on cells of the immune system. We attempted to understand the mechanism of this activity by using an acute model of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation/stress in both rat and mouse, with selective antagonists to CB1 receptors. We demonstrate that the ability of a CB1 antagonist to inhibit release of proinflammatory cytokines is not dependent on either adrenal-derived catecholamines or corticosteroids or input from the pituitary or thymus glands but does involve the spleen. Furthermore, we show that the anti-inflammatory activity is retained without communication from the central nervous system following ganglionic blockade, suggesting a peripheral site of action. Finally, we show that the anti-inflammatory activity can be inhibited with the use of a selective beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist.", 
    "178": "In recent years ever-increasing amounts of pharmaceuticals are being detected in the aquatic environment and in some cases, they have even been discovered in drinking water. Their presence is attributed mainly to the inability of sewage treatment plants to adequately remove these compounds from the sewage influent. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility, kinetics and efficiency of using liquid-core microcapsules as a novel methodology, termed capsular perstraction, to remove seven pharmaceuticals commonly found in the environment, from water. The process involves the envelopment of pre-selected organic solvents within a porous hydrogel membrane to form liquid-core microcapsules, which can be used to extract a large range of compounds. Results indicate that this novel approach is capable of extracting the seven chosen compounds rapidly and with a variable efficiency. The simultaneous use of both dibutyl sebacate and oleic acid liquid-core microcapsules at a liquid volume ratio of only 4% (v/v) resulted in the following extractions within 50min of capsule addition to contaminated water: furosemide 15%; clofibric acid 19%; sulfamethoxazole 22%; carbamazepine 54%; warfarin 80%; metoprolol 90% and diclofenac 100%. The effects of different agitation rates, microcapsule size and membrane thickness on the rate of mass transfer of warfarin into the liquid-core (dibutyl sebacate) of microcapsules was also examined. Results showed that the main rate-limiting step to mass transfer was due to the stagnant organic film (microcapsule size) within the core of the microcapsules. A volumetric mass transfer coefficient of 2.28x10(-6)m/s was obtained for the smallest microcapsules, which was nearly 4-fold higher compared to the value (0.6x10(-6)m/s) obtained for the largest microcapsules used in this study. Even with this resistance liquid-core microcapsules are still capable of the rapid extraction of the tested compounds and may provide a platform for the safe disposal of the pharmaceuticals after removal.",

Hypertensive crisis can be further classified as a hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency depending on end-organ involvement including cardiac, renal, and neurologic injury. The prompt recognition of a hypertensive emergency with the appropriate diagnostic tests and triage will lead to the adequate reduction of blood pressure, ameliorating the incidence of fatal outcomes. Severely hypertensive patients with acute end-organ damage (hypertensive emergencies) warrant admission to an intensive care unit for immediate reduction of blood pressure with a short-acting titratable intravenous antihypertensive medication. Hypertensive urgencies (severe hypertension with no or minimal end-organ damage) may in general be treated with oral antihypertensives as an outpatient. Rapid and short-lived intravenous medications commonly used are labetalol, esmolol, fenoldopam, nicardipine, sodium nitroprusside, and clevidipine. Medications such as hydralazine, immediate release nifedipine, and nitroglycerin should be avoided. Sodium nitroprusside should be used with caution because of its toxicity.

Typically, there is no evidence of structural heart disease. In many cases, Brugada syndrome has been linked to a mutation of the gene SCN5A, which encodes for the fast cardiac sodium channel. In patients with the Brugada syndrome, pharmacologic sodium channel blockade can increase the degree of ST-segment elevation. Interestingly, even in patients with a normal baseline ECG and no clinical suggestion of the Brugada syndrome, toxic doses of class I antiarrhythmic agents as well as toxicities with several nonantiarrhythmic drugs that possess sodium channel blocking properties can induce the Brugada ECG abnormality. Specifically, the beta-receptor blocker propranolol, at high doses, binds to the cardiac sodium channels and inhibits sodium uptake.

However, the heat effects measured in the ITC experiment for step-wise addition of drug solution surprisingly increased for the first injections up to a maximum and only thereafter decreased. The heat effects do not exclusively represent the exchange reaction, but rather include a more complex pattern of reactions: shrinking of SP Sephadex C-25 upon addition of prop-HCl solution squeezes considerable amounts of the drug molecules out of the complex.

    "209": "Heart rate (HR) during exercise is controlled by cardiac sympathetic (CSNA) and vagal (CVNA) efferent nerve activity and plasma catecholamines. To determine their relative contribution to the exercise tachycardia, we examined the effects of adrenalectomy (ADX) and autonomic blockades on the HR response during treadmill exercise for 32min in 13 conscious rats. The baseline HR was not influenced by ADX, suggesting no significant role of adrenal catecholamines on the baseline HR. Since the baseline HR was increased 61beats/min by atropine methyl nitrate (1.5mg/kg) and decreased 26beats/min by atenolol (3mg/kg), CVNA determined the baseline HR more than CSNA. ADX did not affect the immediate increase in HR at 0-12s from the exercise onset but reduced the subsequent increase in HR at 13-30s. These increases in HR at the early period of exercise were more blunted by atenolol than atropine. On the other hand, the peak tachycardia response of 99+/-8beats/min at the end of exercise, which was the same between the intact and ADX conditions, was blunted to 73% by atenolol, to 77% by atropine, and to 35% by combined atenolol and atropine, respectively. In conclusion, it is likely that the tachycardia at the beginning of dynamic exercise is predominantly determined by the cardiac autonomic nerve activity, especially by a prompt increase in CSNA, and that the hormonal mechanism due to adrenal epinephrine contributes to a further increase in HR approximately in 13s from the onset of exercise.", 
    "210": "This paper proposes an approach for increasing drug release durations from contact lenses and other biomedical devices by in situ creation of transport barriers of Vitamin E that force drug molecules to diffuse through long tortuous path. Results show that the increase in release duration is quadratic in Vitamin E loading, which is consistent with proposed mathematical models. Loadings of 10 and 40% Vitamin E increase release time of timolol by a factor of about 5 and 400, respectively for NIGHT&DAY lens. Similar results have been obtained for other hydrophilic drugs including fluconazole and dexamethasone 21-disodium phosphate (DXP). Vitamin E loading in the NIGHT&DAY lens leads to slight increase in lens sizes (6.5% increase for 30% loading), a slight reduction in oxygen diffusion (about 40% reduction for 75% loading), and a more significant reduction in the ion permeability (50% reduction for 10% loading).

    "211": "In this work, the effect of the serum protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), on the detection of propranolol in artificial serum by ion-transfer voltammetry at an array of micro-interfaces between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (microITIES) is presented. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and differential pulse stripping voltammetry (DPSV) were examined for the detection of low concentrations of propranolol. Both CV and DPV had an interference effect from BSA, manifested as lower currents in the presence of the protein. DPSV proved to be the most effective technique, enabling the detection of 0.05 microM propranolol in the presence of BSA. The DPSV method employed a preconditioning step as well as a preconcentration step followed by the analytical signal generation step. The latter was based on the back-transfer of the drug across the microITIES. The preconcentration step was crucial to prevention of the adverse effects of BSA on the voltammetric detection. These results demonstrate that serum-protein effects on drug detection at low concentrations can be eliminated by use of DPSV at arrays of microITIES. CVs of propranolol with increasing concentrations of BSA revealed the influence of the drug-protein binding interaction, with decreases in current but no change in transfer potential. Therapeutic concentrations of propranolol were detected, demonstrating the viability of this approach for bioanalytical investigations.", 
    "212": "National guidelines recommend heart failure (HF) disease management programs to facilitate adherence to evidence-based practices. This study examined the influence of dedicated HF clinics on delivery of guideline-recommended therapies for cardiology practice outpatients with HF and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction.", 
    "213": "IMPROVE HF, a prospective cohort study, enrolled 167 cardiology practices to characterize outpatient management of 15,381 patients with chronic systolic HF. Adherence to guideline-recommended HF therapies was recorded, and the presence of a dedicated HF clinic was assessed by survey. Multivariate models identified contributions to delivery of guideline-recommended HF therapies.", 
    "214": "Of practices, 41.3% had a dedicated HF clinic. Practices with a dedicated HF clinic had greater adherence to 3 of 7 guideline-recommended HF therapy measures: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (P = .02), beta-blocker (P = .025), and HF education (P = .009). After adjustment, use of a dedicated HF clinic was associated with greater conformity in 2 of 7 measures: cardiac resynchronization therapy (P = .036) and HF education (P = .005) but not angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, beta-blocker, aldosterone antagonist, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy, and anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation.", 
    "215": "Use of dedicated HF clinics varied in cardiology outpatient practices and was associated with greater use of cardiac resynchronization therapy and HF education but not other guideline-recommended therapies.", 
    "216": "Previous reports have demonstrated that participation in GWTG-CAD, a national quality initiative of the American Heart Association, is associated with improved guideline adherence for patients hospitalized with CAD. We sought to establish whether these benefits from participation in GWTG-CAD were sustained over time.", 
    "217": "We used the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hospital Compare database to examine 6 performance measures and one composite score for 3 consecutive 12-month periods including aspirin and beta-blocker on arrival/discharge, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) for left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), and adult smoking cessation counseling. The differences in guideline adherence between the GWTG-CAD hospitals (n = 440, 439, 429) and non-GWTG-CAD hospitals (n = 2,438, 2,268, 2,140) were evaluated for each 12-month period. A multivariate mixed-effects model was used to estimate the independent effect of GWTG-CAD over time adjusting for hospital characteristics.", 
    "218": "Compared with non-GWTG hospitals, the GWTG-CAD hospitals demonstrated higher guideline adherence for 6 performance measures. The largest differences existed for (1) aspirin at arrival (2.3%, 2.1%, and 1.6% for each 12-month period, respectively), (2) aspirin at discharge (3.4%, 2.2%, and 2.3%), (3) beta-blocker at arrival (3.4%, 2.9%, and 2.6%), and (4) beta-blocker at discharge (2.8%, 1.8%, and 1.5%). In multivariate analysis, the GWTG-CAD hospitals were independently associated with better adherence for 4 of the 6 measures (the exceptions were ACE-I for LVSD and smoking cessation counseling). Superior performance was also found for the composite measures. Although there was some narrowing between groups, GWTG-CAD hospitals maintained superior guideline adherence than non-GWTG-CAD hospitals for the entire 3-year period (adjusted differences 1.8%, 1.6%, and 1.4%).", 
    "219": "Hospitals participating in GWTG-CAD had modestly superior acute cardiac care and secondary prevention measures performance relative to non-GWTG-CAD. These benefits of GWTG-CAD participation were sustained over time and independent of hospital characteristics."
