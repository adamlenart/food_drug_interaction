    "0": "The present correlational study compared behavioral and psychophysiological characteristics of coronary patients who were either medicated or not medicated with the beta-adrenergic blocking drug propranolol. Eighty-eight patients were given a structured Type A interview (SI) and a history quiz while heart rate and blood pressure were monitored. Data were analyzed controlling for age, sex, extent of coronary artery disease, and history of angina. Results indicated that patients taking propranolol (n = 65) were significantly lower in intensity of Type A behavior than patients not taking propranolol (n = 23). No effects were obtained for patients medicated or not medicated with diuretics, nitrates, or other CNS active drugs. Propranolol patients also showed lesser heart rate and rate-pressure product responses to the interview, but did not differ in blood pressure responses. Components of Type A which were lower in propranolol patients included speech stylistics (loud/explosive, rapid/accelerated, potential for hostility). Content of responses to the SI and scores on the Jenkins Activity Survey did not differ between the groups. An explanation for these results is offered in terms of the effects of propranolol on peripheral sympathetic responses, and evidence for a physiological substrate for Type A behavior. A conceptualization of the Type A pattern in terms of cognitive and physiological components is advanced, and implications for clinical intervention are discussed.", 
    "1": "In three experiments, behavioral toxicity induced by 5 different dose levels of digitoxin was investigated in mice that were treated with either clonidine or propranolol or were either young (70-140 days), middle aged (240-260) or old (450-600). Observed on four drug-induced behavior categories, it was found that both clonidine and propranolol attenuated the toxic effects of relatively low dose levels of digitoxin, while at higher digitoxin dose levels only propranolol was able to reduce significantly the ED50 and the LD50. The results were discussed in terms of adrenergic mechanisms mediating digitoxin toxicity. Aged mice were found to be the least and middle aged the most resistant to the toxic effects of digitoxin.", 
    "2": "1 The effect of hypothyroidism, induced by methimazole, upon the response of the isolated portal vein of the rat to adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists, to angiotensin II and to papaverine has been investigated. 2 The positions and maxima of log doses-response curves, to the vasoconstrictor agonists, noradrenaline and angiotensin II, and to the vasodilator agonists isoprenaline and papaverine, were unaffected by methimazole treatment. 3 The alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist phentolamine competitively inhibited the effects of noradrenaline to a similar extent in preparations from control and hypothyroid animals. The competitive antagonism of isoprenaline by the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol was similarly unaffected by hypothyroidism. 4 These results taken together indicate that hypothyroidism is without significant effect upon either the properties of postjunctional alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors in the rat portal vein, or upon the reactivity of this blood vessel to the vasoactive agonists studied.", 
    "3": "In ten hospitalized, hypertensive male patients (WHO stage I or II) an acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) pretreatment (p.o. 5.0 g/24 h) prevented the acute blood pressure (BP) lowering effect of pindolol (1 mg i.v.) as compared with a placebo pretreatment. Similarly in six other hospitalized male patients (four normotensive, two slightly hypertensive) a single dose of ASA (1.0 or 1.5 g orally), which alone tended to raise the BP, reduced the decrease in systolic BP and led to an increase in diastolic BP following propranolol (5 mg i.v.). The ASA pretreatment did not affect the decrease in heart rate and cardiac contractility (measured by systolic time intervals) after the application of pindolol and propranolol, respectively. In conformity with data in the literature, the results suggest a possible connection between endogenous prostaglandins and the hypotensive, but not negative chronotropic and inotropic activity of the beta-blocking agents investigated.", 
    "4": "1 The effectiveness of fixed combination tablets of timolol 10 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and amiloride 2.5 mg (Moducren) once daily in the control of blood pressure has been assessed in fully ambulant hypertensives by the technique of continuous intra-arterial recording. Highly significant blood pressure reduction (P less than 0.001) was obtained consistently throughout the whole day, confirming the potency and usefulness of the preparation for those patients who need more than one drug to control their blood pressure. 2 Blood pressure responses to both isometric and dynamic forms of exercise were also significantly lowered by combination therapy. 3 The addition of a diuretic to a beta-adrenoceptor blocker appears to be an advantage if the aim of treatment in hypertension is 24 h blood pressure control.", 
    "5": "Cerebrovascular responses to hemorrhage induced hypotension were tested in aged (24 month) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) after ten weeks of antihypertensive drug or sham treatment. Antihypertensive drug treatment consisted of 1 mg/kg/day minoxidil, 4 mg/kg/day hydralazine and 4 mg/kg/day propranolol given in the drinking water. Antihypertensive therapy produced a 30% decrease in systolic blood pressure in aged SHR to levels not significantly different from sham treated WKY. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), measured under control conditions using ketamine anesthesia, was not significantly different between sham and drug treated SHR and WKY. Cerebral oxygen metabolic rate (CMRO2) was significantly decreased in drug treated SHR and WKY compared to sham treated rats. Lowering blood pressure to a level between 80 and 95 torr produced no significant change in CBF or CMRO2 in sham or drug treated WKY or antihypertensive treated SHR, but a produced a significant decrease it both CBF and CMRO2 in sham treated SHR. Decreasing mean blood pressure to 50-60 torr produced a significant decrease in CBF but not CMRO2 in both WKY treatment groups and in hypertensive treated SHR, but again in sham treated SHR both CBF ana CMRO2 were significantly decreased. These results indicate that aged hypertensive rats are unable to maintain CBF or CMRO2 under even moderate hypotensive test conditions, and that cerebral autoregulation can be improved with antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "6": "Using an experimental design in which the addition of hypotaurine or epinephrine was staggered through time, evidence was found that suggests these two compounds are working independently and sequentially to stimulate the fertilizing capacity of hamster spermatozoa in vitro. Prior exposure of spermatozoa to hypotaurine is a prerequisite for the action of epinephrine in causing activation and penetration of hamster ova. A definite role for hypotaurine in inducing capacitation of hamster spermatozoa is also demonstrated. The alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, was more effective in blocking fertilization of hamster ova in vitro than was propranolol, a beta-antagonist. This indicates tha catecholamines may be working by way of alpha-adrenergic receptors in causing capacitation of hamster spermatozoa. The failure to block fertilization with phentolamine after epinephrine has exerted its effect implies that epinephrine acts in a hormone-like fashion.", 
    "7": "The beta-adrenergic agonist, isoprenaline, and antagonist, propranolol, had no effect on the delayed basal secretion of GH consistently observed in rats treated with the narco-analgesic gamma-hydroxybutyrate. Under the same experimental conditions, GH release was distinctly stimulated by infusion of the alpha-adrenergic agonist, clonidine, and by morphine; both responses were dose-dependent. The effects of beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists on these GH responses were as follows: in rats pretreated with isoprenaline -the GH release induced by clonidine and morphine was abolished whereas it was enhanced in rats pretreated with propranolol. These data confirmed and extended previous reports from this laboratory on the inhibitory role of beta-adrenergic receptors on GH regulation.", 
    "8": "The effects on cardiac output and portal venous pressure of atenolol, a cardioselective beta-blocker, and propranolol, a nonselective beta-blocker, were compared in patients with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis. One hour after p.o. administration of 100 mg of atenolol, cardiac output decreased by 32%, and portal venous pressure by 16%; the decrease in cardiac output and the decrease in portal venous pressure were significantly correlated. One hour after p.o. administration of 40 mg of cardiac output and the decrease in portal venous pressure were not correlated. Whereas the decrease in cardiac output was similar after atenolol or propranolol, the decrease in portal venous pressure was significantly less marked after the former than after the latter beta-blocker. It is concluded that: (a) the decrease in portal venous pressure determined by atenolol results mainly from reduction in cardiac output; (b) the decrease in portal venous pressure determined by propranolol results not only from reduction in cardiac output, but also from extracardiac effects of this beta-blocker, and (c) atenolol might be less efficient in the prevention of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhosis, since the decrease in portal venous pressure is less marked than that which occurs with propranolol.", 
    "9": "The authors describe a 62-year-old woman with symptoms of major depression presumed to be secondary to propranolol use. The patient responded poorly to imipramine; however, her symptoms cleared rapidly when atenolol was substituted for propranolol.", 
    "10": "To clarify the mechanisms controlling mesenteric venous membrane potential (Em) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats (WKY), Em was measured in vivo using flexibly mounted glass microelectrodes. Venous diameters were also measured. Ems under control conditions were significantly less in SHR. alpha-Adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine (PBZ) significantly dilated and hyperpolarized SHR small veins but failed to alter the membrane potential of WKY small veins. After blockade with PBZ, membrane potentials were similar in both strains. Propranolol suffusion failed to alter the SHR membrane potential but depolarized WKY small veins. During blockade with PBZ, propranolol depolarized venous membranes equally in both strains. Membrane potentials after spinal section were similar in both strains and equal to the Ems during total adrenergic blockade. The data indicate that, in SHR, the relatively depolarized Em derives from altered alpha-adrenergic input. In SHR, alpha-adrenergic input appears to exert its depolarizing effect, at least in party, by interfering with the expression of endogenous, beta-adrenergic hyperpolarization. The beta-adrenergic influence, like the alpha-adrenergic input in SHR, is dependent on intact supraspinal pathways.", 
    "11": "Little is known regarding the effects of propranolol (P) on sinus node function in children. In this study, corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT) and estimated sinoatrial conduction time (SACT) were measured in 10 children (ages 3 to 16 years; mean 8.3 years) without clinical evidence of sinus node dysfunction before and after intravenous P. The spontaneous sinus cycle length (SCL) increased after P(0.1 mg/kg) in all patients. Mean SCL increased 13.4% from 635 +/- 200 msec (+/- SD) to 720 +/- 202 msec (p less than 0.01). Maximum CSNRT increased in nine patients after P and mean CSNRT increased 63% from 203 +/- 61 msec to 330 +/- 190 msec (p less than 0.05). SACT changed in a random fashion after P. Mean SACT did not change significantly. We conclude that P significantly suppresses sinus node automaticity in children with normal sinus node function but has little or no effect on sinoatrial conduction.", 
    "12": "The electrophysiologic effects of epinephrine on canine subendocardial Purkinje fibers were examined 24 hours after two-stage ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Transmembrane action potential were monitored simultaneously in noninfarcted (NZ) and infarcted (IZ) zones during epinephrine superfusion at 37 degrees C. Epinephrine (10(-8) M to 10(-5) M) induced dose-dependent increases in maximum rate of phase O depolarization (Vmax), action potential amplitude (APA), and maximum diastolic potential (MDP) in both NZ and IZ. Epinephrine consistently shortened effective refractory period (ERP) in both regions No significant change in action potential duration (APD) was noted at either 50% or 90% repolarization. Impulse conduction through the NZ and into the IZ was significantly improved, as indicated by an increased maximum follow-rate in each region at 10(-6) and 10(-5) M epinephrine. The IZ fibers showed a marked hypersensitivity to this agent, in that responses were particularly pronounced in the IZ vs the NZ in terms of both absolute and percentage changes. The effects of epinephrine on Vmax, MDP, APA, and ERP were generally reversed by propranolol, while remaining relatively unaffected by phentolamine, suggesting a beta-adrenergic mechanism. Increased stimulation of ventricular beta-adrenoceptors in the period 16 to 72 hours after myocardial infarction may influence ventricular vulnerability to \"late-phase\" arrhythmias through nonuniform effects in Purkinje fibers.", 
    "13": "The effect of propranolol (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) on distal coronary pressure (DCP), distal bed (DR) and stenosis resistances (SR) and regional myocardial blood flow [endocardial-epicardial (endo/epi)] was studied in two groups of anesthetized dogs with a severe stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery. In group 1, the ability of the DR to autoregulate was left intact, whereas in group 2, the DR was maximally dilated by pretreatment with the coronary vasodilator, chromonar. Despite similar global hemodynamic effects in both groups after propranolol treatment significant differences were observed in the ischemic area. In group 1, propranolol produced a significant increase in subendo blood flow, endo/epi and DCP in the ischemic region. In addition, DR (1.7 +/- 0.4 to 3.3 +/- 0.6 U) increased and SR decreased (3.4 +/- 0.5 to 1.7 +/- 0.3 U) significantly. In group 2, the changes in endo/epi, DCP, DR and SR were prevented by maximal vasodilation. These results suggest that the favorable changes produced by propranolol on ischemic myocardium are the result of a restoration of the ability of the resistance vessels to autoregulate. This allows for a passive decrease in coronary arteriolar dilation which results in an increase in DR and DCP and a decrease in SR. The increase in DCP may also contribute to the increase in ischemic subendo blood flow after propranolol.", 
    "14": "A new drug interaction is described in which the plasma binding of propranolol is markedly stimulated by chronic phenobarbital administration in dogs. After 3 weeks of phenobarbital therapy, the percentages of unbound propranolol fell from 15.2 +/- 1.2 (mean +/- S.E.) to 2.4 +/- 0.3 (P less than .001). The time course of the induction and recovery of the binding of propranolol was also investigated. A half-maximal stimulation of binding was seen by day 3 of phenobarbital therapy and a plateau was reached after 2 weeks. After discontinuing phenobarbital, the recovery was delayed with the midpoint of the return to a normal binding value occurring on day 17. A new model of the time course for induction which includes the pharmacokinetics of the inducing agent has been developed. The stimulation of protein production by phenobarbital is assumed to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, but with a lag phase for the expression of the induction. Using this model, the Km for phenobarbital-stimulated production of the binding protein was 1200 ng/ml, the turnover T1/2 of the protein was 3.4 days and the T1/2 for the lag phase was also 3.4 days. The increased plasma protein binding was highly correlated (r = 0.97) with the elevated concentration of nonprecipitable glycoproteins. This most likely represents induction of alpha-1 acid glycoprotein which is the principal binding protein of propranolol in man. The plasma binding of propranolol was also stimulated with chronic phenytoin in these dogs and with a single dose of Arochlor 1254 in rats.", 
    "15": "Rats fed \"cafeteria\" diets with low (7%, LP) normal (23%, NP) or high (33%, HP) protein contents showed increases in metabolizable energy intake (kJ/kg 0.75, 23-41%) and in energy expenditure (36%) compared to controls fed stock diet (27% protein). The high metabolic rates were inhibited by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. All rats fed cafeteria diets deposited more fat than controls, but the LP diet depressed growth, and these animals also showed the lowest energetic efficiency. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) mass and protein content were increased in all groups fed cafeteria diets, but the largest changes occurred in LP-fed animals, and the smallest in the HP group. Hepatic mitochondrial alpha-glycerophosphate shuttle activity and plasma triiodothyronine levels were elevated twofold in rats fed LP cafeteria diet compared to controls, but the other cafeteria diet groups showed little or no changes, and shuttle activity in BAT was not affected by any of the diets. Blood glucose and plasma insulin levels were similar for control, NP and HP animals, whereas glucose levels were slightly lower and insulin levels were very much lower in the rats fed LP cafeteria diet.", 
    "16": "The possibility that intranasally administered phenylephrine might cause systemic vasoconstriction and an important increase in blood pressure if administered to susceptible individuals in higher doses was investigated in two groups potentially at high risk: 12 patients with chronic nasal congestion whose blood pressure was normal and 14 patients with hypertension receiving the beta-blocker metoprolol. On two separate days increasing doses (0.5 to 4 mg) of phenylephrine or a placebo of identical appearance were instilled into the nostrils at hourly intervals. The blood pressure and the heart rate were recorded every 10 minutes. The total amount of phenylephrine administered (7.5 to 15 mg) was 4 to 30 times the manufacturer's recommended dose. No significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate occurred in either group after the instillation of phenylephrine.", 
    "17": "The effects of exercise and beta adrenoceptor blockade on left ventricular function were assessed in eight patients with hypothyroidism before and during thyroxine replacement treatment. Left ventricular ejection fraction, measured by radionuclide ventriculography, was reduced in hypothyroid patients at rest and on exercise. The rise in ejection fraction with exercise was, however, similar in both groups. Pretreatment with intravenous propranolol reduced the ejection fraction at rest 9% in both hypothyroid and euthyroid patients and reduced the rise on exercise. Directional changes in a second index of myocardial contractility based on the shape of the ventricular volume curve paralleled the changes in the ejection fraction. Left ventricular function is therefore reversibly depressed by thyroid hormone deficiency but responses to exercise and beta adrenoceptor blockade are normal. There is no evidence of altered adrenergic sensitivity in the control of myocardial contractility in hypothyroidism.", 
    "18": "After a 4-minute i.v. dipyridamole infusion, 0.14 mg/kg/min, serial thallium-201 scans were obtained in 60 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Forty patients had significant (greater than or equal to 50% stenosis) coronary artery disease (CAD), and 20 patients had normal coronary arteries or trivial lesions. The images were graded qualitatively for thallium activity by three observers. Sensitivity was 93% (37 of 40) and specificity was 80% (16 of 20). The sensitivity and specificity of the thallium-201 study were not affected by the extent of CAD, the presence of Q waves, or propranolol therapy. Twenty-seven of 37 patients who had initial defects (73%) had complete thallium redistribution of one or more defects. Patient-by-patient analysis using a regression model of all patients showed that the fate of a segmental thallium defect predicted abnormal wall motion by angiography better than ECG Q waves. The presence of propranolol therapy or collaterals did not significantly affect the thallium redistribution results. We conclude that qualitative interpretation by multiple observers of thallium images after dipyridamole infusion is a highly sensitive and specific test for CAD. After dipyridamole, as with exercise stress, the extent of thallium redistribution is related to the degree of myocardial wall motion abnormality.", 
    "19": "The value of three agents in reducing the area of myocardial ischemia in rabbit hearts perfused with crystalloid solution was examined. Ten hearts received crystalloid solution with methylprednisolone (M), 0.25 mg/ml; 18 with hyaluronidase (H), 4 U/ml; and 10 with propranolol (P), 1 microgram/ml. Thirty-six hearts served as controls. The mitral valves were excised, the hearts were paced at 240 beats/min and a coronary artery was ligated. The ischemic area was evaluated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide autofluorescence photography, an intrinsic, high-resolution display of anoxic tissue. The ischemic area was determined by computer from standardized photographs. Myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) was determined and photographs were taken before and at 10-minute intervals after ligation. At 60 minutes, each heart was perfused with rhodamine dye and quick-frozen. In hearts treated with M and H, coronary blood flow increased by 151% (51.7 +/- 3 to 77.9 +/- 3 ml/min) and 150% (48.3 +/- 2 to 72.3 +/- 2 ml/min), respectively (p less than 0.001), whereas in hearts treated with U and P, coronary flow decreased at 60 minutes. In the control hearts, the ischemic area did not change between 5 and 40 minutes of ischemia. The ischemic area of H-treated hearts decreased from 136 +/- 4 mm2 to 110 +/- 9 mm2 between the postligation control and the end of the experiment (p less than 0.01). The ischemic area of M-treated hearts decreased from 131 +/- 5 mm2 to 113 +/- 5 mm2 (p less than 0.05). P produced no change in ischemic area (p greater than 0.4). There was no change in the oxygen-diffusion zone of P-treated or control hearts (439 +/- 13 vs 383 +/- 12 mu, p greater than 0.1). The oxygen-diffusion zone between perfused and anoxic tissue in the M and H hearts increased from 383 +/- 12 mu to 861 +/- 76 mu and 681 +/- 62 mu, respectively (p less than 0.001). We conclude that significant volumes of myocardium remain normoxic within nonperfused areas of M-, P- and H-treated hearts.", 
    "20": "Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) injected into the brains of rats produces hyperglycemia and an increase in plasma concentrations of glucagon, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Neither hypophysectomy nor adrenalectomy prevents CRF-induced hyperglycemia. However, a role of adrenal epinephrine release in mediating CRF-induced hyperglycemia is supported by the finding that the central nervous system-selective somatostatin analog, desAA1,2,4,5,12,13-[D-Trp8]somatostatin, totally prevents the elevation of plasma epinephrine and suppresses the rise of plasma glucose but does not alter the increase in plasma norepinephrine induced by CRF. Pretreatment with the ganglionic blocker chlorisondamine completely prevents the CRF-induced rises in plasma glucose, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. These results demonstrate that CRF acts within the brain to stimulate sympathetic outflow, which results in the development of hyperglycemia. In contrast to other peptides that act within the central nervous system, e.g. bombesin, TRF, and beta-endorphin, whose hyperglycemic actions depend exclusively on adrenal epinephrine secretion, CRF-induced hyperglycemia is secondary to the enhanced secretion of both epinephrine and norepinephrine.", 
    "21": "In order to examine the effect of adrenergic influences on gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) secretion, a series of glucose tolerance tests was carried out in seven healthy volunteers during intravenous infusion of epinephrine (6 microgram/min), epinephrine plus phentolamine (5 mg stat + 0.5 mg/min), epinephrine plus propranolol (5 mg stat + 0.08 mg/min), and saline. No drug infusion modified fasting GIP levels. Alpha-adrenergic stimulation (epinephrine + propranolol) significantly reduced the GIP response (P less than 0.02) and completely inhibited the insulin response (P less than 0.005) to oral glucose, compared with control experiments. Epinephrine alone and epinephrine + phentolamine did not influence glucose-stimulated GIP. These results suggest the possibility that the adrenergic nervous system may have a role in the regulation of GIP secretion in man.", 
    "22": "In 18 patients with stable effort angina, verapamil, 80 mg four times daily, was compared with propranolol, 80 mg four times daily, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effects on anginal threshold, exercise capacity and left ventricular function measured by gated equilibrium blood pool scanning. Both propranolol and verapamil improved exercise capacity (placebo 424 +/- 135 W-min; propranolol 513 +/- 168 W-min, p less than 0.01; verapamil 545 +/- 215 W-min, p less than 0.005) and prolonged the time to 1 mm of ST depression (placebo 4.5 +/- 1.3 minutes; propranolol 7.4 +/- 1.4 minutes, p less than 0.005; verapamil 6.6 +/- 1.9 minutes, p less than 0.005). At rest, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction did not change significantly during drug therapy (placebo 57 +/- 13%, propranolol 55 +/- 12%, verapamil 55 +/- 13%). While taking placebo, all 18 patients had a decrease in exercise ejection fraction. In contrast, 12 patients taking propranolol and 14 patients taking verapamil had a 5% or greater increase in ejection fraction during exercise. Verapamil is an effective primary therapy and a satisfactory alternative to propranolol in patients with stable effort angina.", 
    "23": "1 The effects of dopamine and the dopamine receptor agonists, SK&F 38393 and bromocriptine, on renal and coronary blood flow in the anaesthetized dog were examined. Dopamine was found to dilate both vascular beds, whereas SK&F 38393 increased renal blood flow but did not have any dilator activity in the coronary vasculature. Bromocriptine did not cause vasodilatation in either vascular bed. 2 The vasodilator responses to dopamine and SK&F 38393 were significantly reduced by the dopamine receptor antagonists, ergometrine or metoclopramide. 3 It is proposed that the selective action of SK&F 38393 on the renal vasculature suggests that the dopamine receptors of the renal and coronary vascular beds may be of different types.", 
    "24": "The gradient between wedged and free hepatic venous pressures was measured in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis before and 1, 3, and 9 months after continuous oral administration of propranolol at doses reducing the heart rate by 25% or after administration of a placebo. The gradient between wedged and free hepatic venous pressures decreased throughout the duration of propranolol administration, and it did not significantly change in the patients receiving placebo. Since the gradient between wedged and free hepatic venous pressures closely reflects portal venous pressure in alcoholic cirrhosis, it is concluded that continuous oral administration of propranolol produced sustained reduction in portal venous pressure in these patients.", 
    "25": "This case, from all appearances, seems to constitute a case of secondary thrombocytopenia caused by drugs. Whether the etiology is one of over-dosage achieved when the two drugs, propranolol and disulfiram, were used in combination, or the interaction of the two drugs, or a response to disulfiram is difficult to state definitely. The use of propranolol alone does not seem to be the triggering factor because the patient resumed use of the drug without ill effect. Either an overdosage, exceeding a triggering threshold, was achieved in the combined usage of these two potentially purpuric drugs, or a reaction to disulfiram occurred subsequent to prior sensitizing exposure to this drug. The case does point out that the practitioner, whether dental or medical, should take a careful drug history--particularly in cases of purpura but also in other conditions, such as xerostomia, lichenoid reactions, and burning mouth or tongue. A copy of a current Physician's Desk Reference should be available in every dental or medical office.", 
    "26": "Thirty-five patients whose hypertension was not adequately controlled with optimum doses of hydrochlorothiazide (50-200 mg) entered a long-term study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oxprenolol hydrochloride (60-480 mg). All patients were included in the analysis of safety and tolerability, while the data of 26 patients studied for at least 22 months were used for a parametric analysis of efficacy. Mean standing systolic/diastolic blood pressure was significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced from 171/106 mm Hg to 142/85 mm Hg within three weeks of treatment. There was a similar reduction in supine blood pressure. All 26 patients were normotensive at the end of the titration period and blood pressure control was maintained for at least 22 months of therapy. Oxprenolol produced no serious adverse effects. The results of this long-term study suggest that oxprenolol is effective, well tolerated, and safe in the treatment of thiazide-resistant hypertension.", 
    "27": "The authors describe a woman with chronic schizophrenia who experienced delirium, grand mal seizure, and photosensitivity after the addition of propranolol to her neuroleptic regimen. The pharmacokinetic synergism of this combination may be hazardous for some patients.", 
    "28": "Twice daily subcutaneous injections of norepinephrine (NE, 25 micrograms/100 g body wt) for 16 days, in adults rats, produced significant increases in resting oxygen consumption (VO2), thermogenic responses to NE, plasma triiodothyrone (T3) levels, interscapular brown fat mass, and hepatic mitochondrial alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity. These responses were absent in hypothyroid rats. Rats fasted for 72 h showed significant decreases in VO2 and plasma T3. Refeeding with carbohydrate (CHO, 40 kJ) produced a rapid rise in plasma T3 within 3 h and a delayed rise in VO2 (peak rise at 24 h). Treatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (2 mg/100 g body wt, sc) at the time of the meal blocked the rises in T3 and VO2. Injecting fasted rats with T3 (365 ng/100 g body wt, ip) had no effect on subsequent VO2 but NE (40 micrograms/100 g body wt, sc) produced similar increases in plasma T3 and VO2 to CHO refeeding. The delayed rise in VO2 after CHO refeeding was blocked by propranolol (0.5 mg/100 g body wt, sc) when given 24 h after the meal. These results provide evidence for catecholamine-induced changes in thyroid hormone metabolism and for a sympathetic involvement in thyroid-dependent responses to nutritional manipulations.", 
    "29": "Methods for obtaining and processing rat liver for determination of glycogen phosphorylase a and synthase I activity were studied. An extremely rapid and profound increase in phosphorylase was induced by hypoxia. The effect on synthase I was slower and less striking. Using alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists, a catecholamine-depleting agent, and a ganglionic blocking agent, it was determined that adrenergic stimulation secondary to the surgical procedure required to obtain the liver was not a significant factor. The anesthetic agent used also had a significant effect on the proportion of phosphorylase in the a form. Seconal anesthesia resulted in lower phosphorylase a levels than did ether or urethan anesthesia.", 
    "30": "Use of propranolol in acute myocardial infarction is limited by its cardiodepressant effects. The effects of nitroglycerin (0.4 mg intravenously) on regional myocardial dysfunction produced by total or partial (50 percent) coronary occlusion and intravenous administration of propranolol (1.0 mg/kg) were evaluated using pairs of ultrasonic crystals implanted subendocardially in the nonischemic and ischemic zones in 14 open chest dogs. During partial coronary occlusion, systolic shortening (% delta L) in the ischemic zone decreased from 20.9 +/- 5.3 to 7.2 +/- 6.4 (p less than 0.001). Propranolol did not change it significantly. Nitroglycerin increased % delta L from 6.7 +/- 4.5 to 11.2 +/- 5.3 (p less than 0.01). The nonischemic zone was unaffected by partial coronary occlusion but showed a decrease in % delta L from 18.6 +/- 6.2 to 15.6 +/- 5.1 (p less than 0.01) with propranolol. Nitroglycerin increased % delta L from 15.6 +/- 5.1 to 17.3 +/- 5.9 (p less than 0.02). During total coronary occlusion, nitroglycerin administration after propranolol improved % delta L in the nonischemic but not in the ischemic zone. Nitroglycerin caused a significant decrease in left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressures. Heart rate remained unchanged. It is concluded that nitroglycerin reversed myocardial depressant effects of propranolol in both the partially ischemic and the nonischemic zones after acute coronary occlusion.", 
    "31": "A multicentre double-blind, cross-over trial was planned to evaluate the prophylactic effect of timolol in migraine. The effectiveness of the drug was compared to propranolol and placebo. In the Norwegian part of the trial described in this paper, 18 patients completed the study. The data suggest that timolol is equivalent in effectiveness to propranolol in migraine prophylaxis. Firm conclusions should not be drawn until the results from the multicentre trial are available.", 
    "32": "We analyzed the efficacy of a single daily dose of labetalol (300 mg) administered at 9 a.m. in six inpatients suffering from medium-severe hypertension. The study was conducted on 3 consecutive days, during which the patients were on labetalol, placebo, and non-treatment (control) according to a trial design of the Latin square type, balanced for residual effects. The hypotensive effect of labetalol manifests itself between hours 1 and 2 after administration of the drug. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure values always proved lower after labetalol as compared to placebo and non-treatment (control) as well as to the average of the latter two values (placebo + control) divided by 2. No side effects were detected.", 
    "33": "Insulin resistance was estimated in nine subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and eleven healthy, age and body-weight matched controls. Glucose tolerance and insulin response were evaluated by means of a 2h-glucose infusion test. Insulin resistance was determined by measuring the steady state plasma glucose response (SSPG) to a continuous infusion of glucose (6 mg . kg-1 . min-1 or 12 mg . kg-1 . min-1), insulin, epinephrine and propranolol for 150 minutes as described previously by other authors. The endogenous insulin secretion (C-peptide) was inhibited by epinephrine and propranolol in controls and subjects with IGT irrespective of a low (6 mg . kg-1 . min-1) or high (12 mg . kg-1 . min-1) glucose infusion. Steady-state plasma levels of exogenous insulin were virtually identical in all groups studied. There were no significant differences in the pancreatic glucagon, growth hormone, FFA and glycerol response during the SSPG period between controls and subjects with IGT. In comparison to controls the mean SSPG was significantly higher in subjects with IGT (during low and high glucose infusion) suggesting the existence of insulin resistance in these subjects. A higher glucose dose as described earlier by other investigators does not provide a better discrimination of controls and subjects with IGT concerning their degree of insulin resistance. Finally, there was a direct correlation between the SSPG and glucose tolerance in the total group. In conclusion, our results have confirmed the validity of an infusion technique of glucose, insulin, epinephrine and propranolol for evaluation of insulin sensitivity in vivo. In addition, our findings have added further support for insulin resistance in subjects with IGT which is directly proportional to the degree of glucose intolerance.", 
    "34": "The hemodynamic variables, plasma noradrenaline and plasma renin concentrations were studied in a 57-year-old female with insulin-dependent diabetes of long-standing and orthostatic hypotension. For 6 months she had been bedridden because of severe orthostatic symptoms. Reflex responses in the heart rate and blood pressure during the Valsalva manoeuvre as well as beat-to-beat variations in heart rate were absent. Plasma noradrenaline concentrations were subnormal both in the supine and upright positions. After treatment with Pindolol 15 mg/day the patient was able to walk around and lead an almost normal life. The orthostatic symptoms recurred after withdrawal of therapy and disappeared on resumption of therapy. Arterial blood pressure measured intra-arterially decreased less in the up-right position during treatment with pindolol compared to that in the untreated condition. The heart rate did not change during treatment with Pindolol. Our findings suggest that Pindolol may be an important drug in the treatment of diabetic orthostatic hypotension.", 
    "35": "d-propranolol is almost devoid of beta-blocking effect but has the same membrane stabilizing properties as the dl-form. In order to study the importance of membrane stabilizing activity versus beta blockade in the therapeutical effect of propranolol on essential tremor, we compared d-propranolol with dl-propranolol in 24 patients in a placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over study. dl-propranolol reduced tremor intensity better than d-propranolol. The d-form did not significantly differ from placebo in its effects on tremor, although it did reduce the heart rate slightly. It is concluded that the membrane effect is not important in the therapeutic effect of propranolol in essential tremor.", 
    "36": "Recent publications have described increased vascular prostacyclin synthesis in vascular tissue from both spontaneous and experimental hypertensive animals and hypertensive humans. The only paper dealing with the platelet sensitivity reported that the cells are not abnormally sensitive to PGI2 in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In 22 patients with essential hypertension the platelet sensitivity to the antiaggregatory prostaglandins PGI2, PGE1, and PGD2 was studied on admission and two weeks after successful treatment with a beta-blocking agent. In all the age groups and in both sexes no differences in platelet sensitivity could be detected. These findings suggest that increased vascular PGI-2 synthesis is not counterbalanced by a change in platelet sensitivity in men.", 
    "37": "Data from two short-term double-masked studies using 24 and 16 subjects suggest that topically applied levobunolol safely and effectively treats open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. The onset of effect of a single drop of 0.5% levobunolol occurred within the first hour, producing a maximal hypotensive effect of more than 8 mm Hg after two hours. An intraocular pressure deceased of greater than or equal to 2 mm Hg was still observed after 24 hours for both concentrations of levobunolol tested (0.5% and 1%). Intraocular pressure decreases of more than 9 mm Hg persisted during a one-month trial in which patients were treated twice daily, confirming the results obtained in the 24-hour study. Systemic effects of both timolol (0.5%) and levobunolol (0.5% and 1%) included a consensual intraocular pressure-decreasing effect in the untreated eye and clinically significant reductions in heart rate. Diastolic blood pressure was decreased at two and four hours after administration of 0.5% levobunolol.", 
    "38": "The binding of (-)[3H]dihydroalprenolol, an antagonist of norepinephrine, to beta-adrenergic receptors in different regions of the brain of male and female rats of various ages was measured. The binding to the synaptosomal fraction of corpus striatum, hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum and the brainstems shows a significant decrease in the binding in old rats of both sexes. Only in the female corpus striatal region, the binding in the adult and the old is the same. In the case of females, the highest binding is seen in the young. In the male, an increase in binding occurs up to adulthood, after which it declines, suggesting a definite sex-related difference in the beta-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "39": "Two types of antibodies have been prepared against beta-adrenergic receptors: (1) antibodies against receptor, purified from turkey erythrocyte membranes by affinity chromatography on alprenolol sepharose, and (2) antiidiotypic antibodies raised against the anti-alprenolol immunoglobulins. Both types of antibodies specifically bind to cells which possess beta-adrenergic receptor and mimick the biological effect of the catecholamine hormone: they stimulate basal adenylate-cyclase and enhance adenylate-cyclase activation by catecholamines. The antiidiotypic antibodies only compete with (--)-3H-dihydroalprenolol for binding to the beta-adrenergic receptors on purified turkey erythrocyte membranes. The use of these antibodies as tools for the study of the mechanism of the beta-adrenergic receptor-cyclase complex is discussed.", 
    "40": "Ratios of cardiac to vascular beta-receptor blockade (C:V ratios) of atenolol and propranolol were determined in pentobarbital anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats. These values and the cardiovascular responses to isoproterenol were compared with those of age-matched normotensive control (Donryu, DON) rats reported previously. Mean blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded. Full dose-response curves for isoproterenol were constructed in BP and HR. In vivo pD2 values of isoproterenol (potencies), were not different between DON and SHR rats, although the maximal responses to isoproterenol (efficacy) were significantly suppressed in SHR rats. C:V ratios of atenolol and propranolol in SHR rats were 7.95 and 0.44, respectively. As the values in DON rats were 9.77 and 1.20, respectively, C:V ratios of atenolol and propranolol were decreased in SHR rats. Markedly decreased C:V ratios of propranolol in SHR rats may explain its relatively weak antihypertensive action.", 
    "41": "After a Collison cannula was implanted bilaterally in the cat for intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection, individual patterns of food intake were determined. A mixture of dry and canned cat food was provided to the animal every morning at the same time for 1.0 hr. Once intakes had stabilized, either norepinephrine (NE) or an adrenoreceptor blocking agent was infused in one lateral ventricle by gravity flow over an interval of 30-60 sec. NE given ICV in a dose of 25-75 micrograms 15 min before the period of feeding enhanced both the amount of food consumed by the cat and the duration of its feeding for up to 1.0 hr. When phentolamine in a dose of 25-100 micrograms was infused 15 min prior to the feeding interval, the cat's intake of food was attenuated in a dose-dependent manner, again in terms of both the quantity consumed and the interval of eating. Propranolol was essentially without effect on food intake. In the fully satiated cat, NE infused ICV 15-45 min following the termination of its morning feeding episode tended to augment food intake at the highest 100 micrograms dose, but the effect was not significant. The dose-dependent hypothermia typically observed after NE is given ICV to the cat was found to be entirely independent of the feeding response. Overall, these findings show that noradrenergic pathways in the cat's feeding system apparently bias or otherwise modulate the amount of food consumed. As in other species, the feeding mechanism appears to be mediated through alpha-adrenergic receptors presumed to be in the diencephalon of the cat.", 
    "42": "The direct extra-adrenal actions of adrenocorticotropin 1-39 (ACTH) on electrical (E) and mechanical (M) characteristics of canine atrial tissues (AT) were investigated in in vitro experiments. One hundred twenty-five mU/ml of ACTH 1-39 significantly augmented the catecholamine induced positive inotropism as seen by shortening the time to peak tension (10.6%, p = 0.01) and increasing peak isometric tension (3.5 times, p = 0.001). Effects on the M responses were inhibited by propranolol (10(-6) M) (P). ACTH did not significantly modify action potential E or M parameters during cholinergic receptor antagonism or alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonism. Existence of a specific ACTH receptor was demonstrated using 125I radioiodinated ACTH 1-24. Significant binding of 125I-ACTH to AT was observed. Intracellular C-AMP levels were also measured in AT using radioimmunoassay. Tissues were exposed to 125mU/ml ACTH 1-39 plus combinations of norepinephrine (10(-6) M) (NE) and P. ACTH alone did not elevate intracellular C-AMP levels. NE increased C-AMP levels were not further increased by ACTH. Exposure to antagonist returned elevated C-AMP levels to control values. In conclusion (1) ACTH augments the NE induced M positive inotropism of the beta adrenergic receptor system. (2) ACTH specifically binds to AT and (3) ACTH does not utilize the C-AMP second messenger system.", 
    "43": "Opiate receptor blockade with naloxone reverses the hypotension associated with severe hemorrhage in a variety of animal models. In the present study, we examined the mechanisms of naloxone's actions in conscious rabbits made hypotensive by hemorrhage. This was accomplished through pharmacological blockade of the efferent limbs of the sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous systems prior to naloxone injection. In addition, we examined the effects of naltrexone in the same model. Naloxone treatment in hypotensive-hypovolemic, conscious rabbits results in an increase in mean arterial blood pressure (BP) and a decrease in heart rate (HR). The bradycardia appears to be due to a reduction in beta-adrenergic and an increase in muscarinic-cholinergic activity. The pressor effect is apparently due to increased alpha-adrenergic receptor activation, and is accompanied by an increase in cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance. Naltrexone did not significantly affect BP but it did reduce HR. The results from the present study suggest that naloxone's effects are mediated by an integrated response of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The actions of naloxone may be mediated through antagonism of endogenous opiates.", 
    "44": "A diminished sympathetic activity has been related to training bradycardia seen at rest and during exercise. In order to evaluate if changes in heart adrenergic receptors can be one of the mechanisms by which the sympathetic responsiveness could be decreased by physical training, the number and affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors were determined in heart ventricular tissue of rats submitted to a 10-week running programme. Binding studies were done at different concentrations of (-)[3H] dihydroalprenolol (DHA) (0.5 to 14.4 nmol X litre-1) with ventricular membrane preparations from control and trained rats. Direct linear plot analysis revealed that physical training reduced the total number (1933 +/- 192 vs 2922 +/- 211 fmol X ventricles-1; P less than 0.01) density of beta-adrenergic receptors expressed either as fmol X mg-1 of membrane protein (34 +/- 3 vs 43 +/- 3; P less than 0.05) or as fmol X g-1 ventricle (1740 +/- 170 vs 2308 +/- 155; P less than 0.05). There was no significant change in the dissociation constant (3.11 +/- 0.14 vs 4.08 +/- 0.51 nmol X litre-1; P greater than 0.05). Basal plasma noradrenaline levels were not affected by training (116 +/- 18 vs 101 +/- 14 pg X cm-3; P greater than 0.10); however the adrenaline values were significantly higher in trained rats (91 +/- 16 vs 47 +/- 7 pg X cm-3; P less than 0.05). These data indicate that physical training induces changes at the level of beta-adrenergic receptors and this may partly explain the bradycardia seen in trained subjects and animals.", 
    "45": "Many patients presenting with anginal pain are on beta-blocker therapy and it has been suggested that noninvasive exercise tests for coronary artery disease are adversely affected by such therapy. Recently a new exercise test has been introduced claiming the ability accurately to detect the presence and severity of coronary heart disease in patients with anginal pain; the claim was based on results obtained in patients not undergoing beta-blocker therapy. Therefore using this test, the maximal rate of progression of ST segment depression relative to increases in heart rate during exercise (maximal ST/HR slope) as an index of the severity of myocardial ischaemia, 60 patients on beta-blocker therapy were studied and the results compared with results of coronary arteriography independently obtained. There was a complete agreement, without false results, between the maximal ST/HR slope and the number of significantly diseased coronary arteries. In 21 of these 60 patients the maximal ST/HR slopes obtained before and after beta-blockade were compared; the maximal ST/HR slopes after beta-blockade were not different from those before. It is concluded, that the maximal SR/HR slope can be used reliably to detect the pressure and the severity of coronary heart disease in patients with angina pectoris who are already on beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "46": "In rat adipocyte membranes, both beta-adrenergic agonists and beta-adrenergic antagonists competed with (--)[3H]dihydroalprenolol for high affinity (KD 2-4 nM) and low capacity binding sites. The antagonists but not the agonists competed with (--)[3H]dihydroalprenolol for lower affinity and higher capacity sites. The present studies were performed in order to characterize the adipocyte beta-adrenergic receptor and distinguish it from low affinity, higher capacity sites which were heat-labile and not stereoselective. When isoproterenol was used to define the nonspecific binding, saturation studies showed a single binding site with a capacity of approximately 100 fmol/mg membrane protein (corresponding to approximately 50,000 sites/adipocyte). Binding was saturated by 10 nM (--)[3H]dihydroalprenolol. Approximate KD's of 204 nM were observed. Kinetic analysis of (--)[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding provided an independent measurement of KD between 0.75 and 1.1 nM. This binding site had the characteristics of a beta 1-adrenergic receptor with the potency of isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine greater than or equal to epinephrine as competitors of binding. Furthermore, the KD of inhibition of (--)[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding correlated with the Ki of inhibition by antagonists or Ka of activation by agonists of glycerol release in isolated adipocytes (r = 0.968, P less than 0.001). These results suggest that beta-adrenergic agonists compete with (--)[3H]dihydroalprenolol for the high affinity binding site which represents the physiological site. Furthermore, the use of antagonists (propranolol, alprenolol) to define specific beta-binding includes nonspecific site(s) as well as the beta-adrenergic site. Previous characterization and quantitation of beta receptors in rat fat cell membranes may have been in error by incorporating both types of binding in their measurement.", 
    "47": "1 Low concentrations of isoprenaline (EC50 = 45.6 nM) inhibited contractions in the isolated field stimulated rat vas deferens. This inhibitory effect was markedly attenuated by the postjunctional beta 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist timolol, but not affected by the prejunctional alpha 2 or postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonists rauwolscine and prazosin, respectively. 2 In vas deferens of rats previously treated with reserpine, the postjunctional beta 2-adrenoreceptor-mediated inhibitory response to isoprenaline was markedly potentiated. 3 High concentrations of isoprenaline (EC50 = 1.5 microM) also inhibited contractility in tissues in which postjunctional beta 2-adrenoreceptors were maximally blocked by high concentrations of timolol. This contractile inhibition produced by isoprenaline was abolished by rauwolscine but not significantly altered by prazosin or pretreatment of the rats with reserpine indicating stimulation of prejunctional alpha 2-adrenoreceptors. 4 Rauwolscine pretreatment unmasked an ability of isoprenaline (EC50 = 17.1 microM) to produce enhancement of field stimulation-induced contractions. This response was abolished by prazosin but was unaffected by timolol or reserpinization indicating an action upon postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoreceptors. 5 The data indicate isoprenaline activates adrenoreceptor mechanisms in the field stimulated rat vas deferens by a direct action not dependent upon endogenous catecholamines and with an order of activity of beta 2 much greater than alpha 2 greater than alpha 1. Pretreatment with reserpine produces rapid and selective development of supersensitivity to the postjunctional beta 2-mediated inhibitory response of isoprenaline in this preparation.", 
    "48": "Adrenaline and noradrenaline produced both constriction and dilatation of the toad renal vasculature: constrictor effects were mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors; dilator effects were mediated by beta-adrenoceptors. Vasoconstriction was the predominant response to these amines. Dilatation was only revealed after blockade of alpha-adrenoceptors and constriction of the vasculature. There was a marked seasonal variation in the constrictor responses to adrenaline, but not to noradrenaline. The maximal increase in renal vascular resistance produced by adrenaline in summer was greater, by a factor of three, than the maximum constrictor response in winter. The response to adrenaline in summer was also significantly greater than the responses to noradrenaline in both summer and winter. However, after treatment with propranolol there was no difference between the maximum vasoconstrictions to these two amines, in summer or in winter. Determination of dissociation constants for phentolamine indicated that adrenaline and noradrenaline acted on the same population of alpha-adrenoceptors in both summer and winter. The enhanced vasoconstriction to adrenaline in summer appears to be due to a reduced potency of adrenaline on renal vascular beta-adrenoceptors. The reduction in potency may be caused by a subtle configurational change in the beta-adrenoceptors, perhaps induced by hormonal changes associated with the onset of breeding.", 
    "49": "1. Isolated papillary muscles from guinea-pig hearts were paced at a constant frequency and isometric contractions reported. 2. Guinea-pigs were either untreated or pretreated with reserpine. Three pretreatment schedules were used; a) 0.5 mg kg-1 i.p. at 24 h, b) 5.0 mg kg-1 at 72 h and 3.0 mg kg-1 at 48 and 24 h, or c) 0.1 mg kg-1 daily for 7 days. 3. Cumulative concentration-response curves for the isoprenaline-induced increases in tension were obtained. The geometric mean EC50 values after the 3 and 7 day reserpine pretreatment schedules were significantly (P less than 0.05) less than for untreated guinea-pigs indicating a supersensitivity. 4. EC50 values for the positive inotropic responses to histamine and calcium in papillary muscles from reserpine-pretreated guinea-pigs did not differ significantly (P less than 0.05) from those from untreated animals. This suggests that the supersensitivity to isoprenaline is beta-adrenoceptor specific. 5. Membrane fractions were prepared from the ventricles of the untreated and reserpine-pretreated guinea-pigs from which papillary muscles had been removed. Binding of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol ([3H]-DHA) to beta-adrenoceptors of these membranes was determined. Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) and total numbers of binding sites (Bmax) were determined by Scatchard analysis of the saturation curves for [3H]-DHA binding. 6. There was no increase in affinity (fall in KD value) or change in the total number of binding sites associated with reserpine-induced supersensitivity. The equilibrium inhibition constant (Ki) for the displacement of [3H]-DHA binding by isoprenaline was also identical in membranes from untreated and reserpine-pretreated animals. Thus reserpine-induced supersensitivity to isoprenaline does not appear to involve a change in affinity for the beta-adrenoceptor or in receptor numbers as determined by [3H]-DHA binding.", 
    "50": "The electrophysiological properties of a hormone-dependent, differentiated thyroid epithelial cell strain were studied using intracellular microelectrodes. The average membrane potential of solitary, isolated cells was -78.4 +/- 1.3 mV. The membrane potential depolarized 55 mV per tenfold increase in extracellular potassium concentration. Weak electrical coupling was recorded between contiguous cells. Like thyroid cells in vivo, these cells did not generate action potentials. In some cells a spontaneous, slow transition in the membrane potential from -80mV to -30 mV was accompanied by an increase in input resistance. Membrane potential transitions could be induced by perfusing cells with isotonic Hanks solutions saturated with CO2 (pH = 5.5) or by perfusing cells with hypotonic Hanks solutions (190-290 mOsm/kg). Membrane potential transitions were due to a decreased potassium permeability. Noradrenaline elicited both a fast depolarization and a slow depolarization. The fast depolarization was due to an increase in conductance of Na+ channels and of Cl- channels. Intracellular injection of Ca++ elicited the fast depolarization. Intracellular injection of EGTA or cobalt abolished the fast depolarization. Replacement of extracellular Ca++ by Mg++ did not affect the fast depolarization. Thus, the fast depolarization was due to accumulation of intracellular Ca++. The fast depolarization was abolished by the alpha adrenergic blocker phentolamine (10(-6) M), and was not abolished by the beta adrenergic blocker propranolol (10(-5) M).", 
    "51": "It has been postulated that the wide range of bronchial hyperresponsiveness to nonspecific stimuli, such as methacholine, found in asthmatics could be due to increased alpha-adrenergic receptor activity in the airways. We examined alpha 1- receptor responsiveness by comparing the responses obtained after inhaling the alpha 1-agonist phenylephrine (2 to 32 mg/ml) with the responses obtained after inhaling buffered saline in 10 asthmatics in whom the provocation concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ranged from 0.13 to 9.19 mg/ml. Subjects were pretreated with inhaled atropine (3 mg nebulized during tidal breathing) and inhaled propranolol (3 mg nebulized during tidal breathing) to exclude cholinergic and beta receptor activity influencing bronchial smooth muscle responsiveness. After pretreatment drugs, the mean value for FEV1 before phenylephrine inhalations did not differ significantly from that before the control inhalations of saline. There was no significant change in FEV1 after phenylephrine compared with that after saline, suggesting that bronchial smooth muscle alpha 1-adrenergic receptor activity was not present. We conclude that increased bronchial smooth muscle alpha 1-receptor activity is not the primary abnormality producing the variability between asthmatics in nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness.", 
    "52": "The in vitro release of pepsinogen was studied using a preparation of isolated gastric glands from rabbits. The pepsinogen content of the glands was estimated to be about 700 U/mg dry wt. Spontaneous release of pepsinogen was found to be less than 1% of the total per hour and relatively constant for at least 2 h. Pepsinogen release was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by both carbachol and isoproterenol. The cholinergic and beta-adrenergic stimulation was selectively inhibited by atropine and propranolol, respectively. Removal of external calcium inhibited the responses to both isoproterenol (partially) and carbachol (completely). Several agents, including histamine, prostaglandin (E2), and synthetic secretin, were found not to stimulate pepsinogen release. However, a crude secretin preparation (Boots) was found to produce significant stimulation. Dibutyryl cAMP increased pepsinogen release in a dose-dependent manner. Isoproterenol was found to increase the cAMP content of gastric glands and to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity in homogenates. The beta-adrenergic stimulation of adenylyl cyclase was found to be selective for a population of gastric cells that was relatively depleted of parietal cells and distinct from the histamine-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. The results indicate that pepsinogen secretion by the gastric chief cell is regulated, in part, by separate cholinergic and beta-adrenergic mechanisms and that both calcium and cAMP play a role in this regulation.", 
    "53": "The composition, morphology, beta-adrenergic receptor binding, and in vitro lipolysis were examined in lean and obese, 5- to 6-mo-old male Zucker rat interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT). IBAT pads from obese rats were heavier (283%), had more lipid (700%), and more (75%)( and larger (83%) adipocytes than those from lean rats. Also, IBAT from obese rats had no multiloculated cells, and 50% of their IBAT adipocytes were the size of white fat cells. High affinity binding for (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol (KD, 15-18 nM), as well as the estimated KD values for binding and the 1/2 Vmax values for adrenergic agonist-induced lipolysis were similar in isolated IBAT cells from lean and obese rats. However, adipocytes from IBAT in obese rats had 75% fewer high affinity beta-adrenergic binding sites per cell (Bmax) compared to those in lean rats. These findings are most compatible with the infiltration of IBAT by white adipocytes. Such infiltration would be expected to reduce the overall thermogenic capacity of IBAT in obese Zucker rats and thereby contribute to the maintenance of their obesity.", 
    "54": "The effect of diltiazem on ischemic myocardial acidosis was studied in the canine heart whose left anterior descending coronary artery was partially occluded to reduce coronary flow to about one-third (partial occlusion). Myocardial pH was measured by use of a micro glass pH electrode. The pH decreased from 7.53 to 6.93 by partial occlusion and appeared to reach a steady state within 30 min. Saline or drugs were injected i.v. 30 min after partial occlusion. The decreased pH increased spontaneously by 34% of the total reduction of pH in the next 60 min after saline injection. Diltiazem (100 micrograms/kg) potentiated the increase in pH; the pH increased by 76% 60 min after the injection. Propranolol (1 mg/kg) also potentiated the increase in pH that had been decreased by partial occlusion. The relation between pH decrease and the tissue levels of metabolites was also studied. The reduction of myocardial pH from 7.5 to 6.8 was accompanied by a 2-fold increase in the tissue lactate content and by decreases in the ATP and creatine phosphate contents. There was a significant correlation between the hydrogen ion concentration calculated from the pH and each of the lactate, ATP and creatine phosphate contents. The present study indicates that diltiazem attenuates ischemic myocardial acidosis.", 
    "55": "The known vagolytic effect of quinidine has been termed \"atropine-like.\" This effect was studied in vitro and in vivo. Unlike atropine, quinidine was not found to exert any competitive antagonism to acetylcholine at the muscarine-sensitive cholinoceptors of isolated guinea-pig atria. In the narcosed dog subjected to vagal stimulation, the effects of slow perfusion of quinidine (0.5 mg/kg/min for 120 min) were also different in several ways from those of atropine. The tachycardia induced by quinidine was not concomitant with an inhibition of the cardiomoderation caused by vagal stimulation. Tachycardia appeared at low plasma levels, whereas reduction of vagal influence only occurred at high concentrations. Even then, the effects of vagal stimulation were never totally suppressed. After propranolol, quinidine had no tachycardiac action. This could not be attributed to any difference in metabolism because plasma levels of quinidine were the same in dogs pretreated or not with propranolol. Evidence reported here suggests that the cardioacceleration induced by quinidine is not due to a direct vagolytic action. The slight lowering of vascular resistance and arterial pressure observed cannot fully account for this effect either. An adrenergic mechanism involving beta receptors seems likely. In any case, to describe the effects of quinidine on heart rate as atropine-like is evidently inappropriate and misleading.", 
    "56": "Norepinephrine (NE) may be a neurotransmitter in a nociceptive pathway in the mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF) of the rat. When NE is applied microiontophoretically to certain neurons in rat MRF, it produces a change in neuronal firing rate similar to that produced by a noxious stimulus (foot pinch) in these neurons. If NE is a neurotransmitter involved in the transmission of nociceptive information in the MRF, specific adrenergic receptor antagonists, administered microiontophoretically, should block both the firing evoked by NE, administered microiontophoretically, and the firing evoked by foot pinch in these neurons. When phentolamine (an alpha adrenoceptor antagonist) was administered microiontophoretically it blocked the increases in neuronal firing rate evoked either by foot pinch or by NE. In contrast, propranolol (a beta adrenoceptor antagonist) rarely blocked the firing evoked by either foot pinch or by the microiontophoretic administration of NE. Thus, it appears that if NE is involved in the transmission of nociceptive information in the MRF of the rat, this information transfer is mediated by alpha adrenergic receptors.", 
    "57": "The effect of administration of antidepressant drugs to rats on catecholamine-induced rises in the concentration of melatonin in the pineal gland and serum was studied. Increases in melatonin levels were produced by either the exogenous administration of different doses of L-isoproterenol or by exposure of rats to darkness. Repeated administration of either desmethylimipramine or nialamide reduced significantly the elevation in melatonin concentrations in the pineal gland produced by either L-isoproterenol or darkness. The rise in serum melatonin seen at night was also blunted significantly in rats treated repeatedly with these drugs. By contrast, the concentration of melatonin in either the pineal gland or serum was not reduced in rats given desmethylimipramine or nialamide acutely. In fact, daytime concentrations of melatonin both in the gland and in serum were significantly increased after either acute or repeated treatment with nialamide. The nialamide-induced increase in daytime concentrations of melatonin in the pineal gland was prevented if the rats were treated with propranolol. The diminished hormonal responsiveness produced by the repeated administration of antidepressants occurred at a time when the binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to pineal gland homogenates was reduced. Thus, a hormonal response to catecholamines regulated via beta adrenergic receptor activation is reduced by repeated antidepressant treatments in conjunction with the development of beta adrenergic receptor subsensitivity.", 
    "58": "Microassay procedures for cAMP-dependent protein kinase and phosphorylase were developed which detected these activities in less than 25 micrograms of frozen-dried epidermis from a punch biopsy of skin without homogenization. Using these procedures, the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and phosphorylase by beta-adrenergic stimulation in mouse skin was studied in vivo. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase was stimulated by isoproterenol and inhibited by propranolol. Isoproterenol stimulation also activated phosphorylase a in mouse skin. In normal epidermis and uninvolved and involved epidermis from psoriatic patients no significant differences were found in the activities of cAMP-dependent kinase and phosphorylase a. In all experiments we observed that the unstimulated activity ratios of phosphorylase a/total phosphorylase were around 20-30%; these values were much lower than those hitherto reported and show a preponderance of phosphorylase b rather than a. We suggest that in previous reports where phosphorylase a domination was found, phosphorylase b to a activation occurred during homogenization. The data also suggest that in the steady state no obvious defect in basic activities of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and phosphorylase is observed in psoriatic skin.", 
    "59": "The hemodynamic effects exerted by two chemically dissimilar calcium antagonists (tiapamil and nifedipine) were studied in anesthetized dogs during control conditions, following critical stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery, and in the presence of beta-receptor blockade with nadolol (1 mg/kg). Dose-dependent hemodynamic changes were observed following the intravenous administration of three different doses of tiapamil (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg) and nifedipine (2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 micrograms/kg) during control conditions. In the presence of critical coronary stenosis, tiapamil and nifedipine produced similar magnitudes of decreases in blood pressure and changes in heart rate. Tiapamil produced paradoxic increases in left ventricular (LV) dP/dt and contractile force since these changes were accompanied by a slight decrease in heart rate. Nifedipine, unlike tiapamil, resulted in reflex increases in heart rate and myocardial contractility in response to reduction in the afterload. Also, nifedipine, unlike tiapamil, produced relatively minor changes in the coronary flow of the unoccluded left anterior descending coronary artery. In the presence of nadolol and critical stenosis, both agents produced markedly different hemodynamic responses. In the tiapamil series, three out of five dogs died due to severe cardiodepression consisting of bradycardia, hypotension, reduced myocardial contractility, and coronary blood flow. No mortality was observed in the nifedipine series since the cardiac function was adequately maintained in the presence of beta-blockade. Our results are in close agreement with the clinical observations, indicating a much higher incidence of dangerous drug interactions with combined use of verapamil-like compounds (e.g., tiapamil) with beta-blockers than with nifedipine, especially in patients with coronary artery disease and AV conduction disturbances.", 
    "60": "Several new beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (sulfinalol, MK 761, and prizidilol) have been reported to possess direct vasodilator activity in addition to blocking beta-receptors. The mechanism of the hypotensive and vasodilator actions of these agents was examined and compared to that of pindolol and hydralazine. Intraarterial injection of each agent increased blood flow in the sympathetically denervated hindlimb of anesthetized dogs. Doses increasing flow by 50 ml/min (ED50) were 0.48, 0.24, 331, 0.3, and 51 micrograms for sulfinalol, MK 761, prizidilol, pindolol, and hydralazine, respectively, Intravenous injection of each agent reduced blood pressure of anesthetized, ganglion-blocked dogs. Vasodilation and hypotension to sulfinalol, MK 761, and pindolol, but not prizidilol or hydralazine were attenuated by propranolol pretreatment. Oral administration of sulfinalol (2.5 mg/kg), MK 761 (2.5 mg/kg), prizidilol (10 mg/kg), pindolol (0.1 mg/kg), and hydralazine (2.5 mg/kg) reduced pressure of conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats. Antihypertensive actions of sulfinalol and pindolol, but not MK 761, prizidilol, and hydralazine were inhibited by propranolol pretreatment (25 mg/kg, p.o.). With the exception of hydralazine, each agent demonstrated effective beta-adrenergic blockade at the antihypertensive dose tested as judged by inhibition of the chronotropic responses to sympathetic stimulation and isoproterenol in pithed rats. These data suggest that the acute vasodilator and blood pressure lowering effects of sulfinalol, MK 761, and pindolol, but not prizidilol and hydralazine, are mediated, at least in part, through activation of vascular beta-receptors.", 
    "61": "Using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (acquisition time of 3 min), we studied the effects of l- and d-propranolol on the ischemic derangement of myocardial energy metabolism in the isolated perfused guinea pig heart. The myocardial pH and concentration of high-energy phosphate were used as measures of the energy metabolism. Cardiac pH progressively declined during ischemia from 7.41 +/- 0.04 to 7.13 +/- 0.05, 6.91 +/- 0.04, 6.74 +/- 0.04, and 6.61 +/- 0.04 (before ischemia and 3, 6, 9, and 12 min after ischemia, respectively). After 3 min of reperfusion, pH rapidly returned to 7.42 +/- 0.04. Creatine phosphate (CP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contents were reduced, while inorganic phosphate (Pi) contents were increased during ischemia. Whereas CP and Pi contents were restored to the normal values after reperfusion, the recovery of ATP contents was poor. Both l- and d-propranolol (10(-6) M) significantly suppressed the fall of the myocardial pH. Changes in the high-energy phosphate contents were also attenuated by l- and d-propranolol. These results suggest that not only l-propranolol, but also d-propranolol can produce beneficial effects on the ischemic derangements of myocardial energy metabolism.", 
    "62": "Adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) metabolism was studied in the microcirculation (100- to 150-micrometers arterioles) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) at different stages of hypertension. Mesenteric arterioles from animals 4, 6, 12, and 18 wk old were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer for 30 min at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4, with and without the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (MIX). cAMP was assayed by radioimmunoassay. Arteriolar production of cAMP was age related in both WKY and SHR rats although the temporal patterns were different. At 6 wk (developmental stage of hypertension in SHR) cAMP accumulation in the presence or absence of MIX by SHR arterioles was higher than in the WKY before falling to normotensive levels at 12 wk. Salbutamol (a beta 2-agonist) stimulated dose-dependent increases in cAMP in both WKY and SHR at 6 wk. Stimulation of cAMP by salbutamol or by isoproterenol was blocked by propranolol. Neither agonist increased guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. These data indicate that differences in cAMP metabolism are evident at the arteriolar level during the developmental stage of SHR hypertension. These differences may contribute to the morphological and physiological changes occurring at this time.", 
    "63": "In 19 healthy men aged 50 with untreated mild essential hypertension (WHO group I classification) randomized into two groups, treatment (18 weeks) with oxprenolol (n = 10) lowered HDL cholesterol by 11.4% (P less than 0.02) and cholesterol ratio (HDL cholesterol X 100/LDL + VLDL cholesterol) by 13.7% (P less than 0.05) whereas atenolol (n = 9) lowered HDL cholesterol by 16.5% (P less than 0.02) and cholesterol ratio by 19.2% (P less than 0.01). In the total material (n = 19) the reduction of HDL cholesterol correlated positively with initial concentration of HDL (r = 0.48, P less than 0.05). Increments of total triglycerides by 20.0 and 17.9%, respectively, for the two drugs and small changes in total cholesterol, LDL + VLDL cholesterol and uric acid were not significant. The HDL cholesterol lowering effect of oxprenolol and atenolol observed in the present study may have clinical importance since such metabolic side effects have been postulated to counteract the beneficial effect of blood pressure reduction on development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease in mild essential hypertension.", 
    "64": "Concurrently controlled, randomized clinical trials play an important role in the validation of treatment and control measures of cardiovascular disease. As such trials have been carried to conclusion, a great deal has been learned not only about the treatment of the disease but also about the methodology of clinical trials. Seven recently completed clinical trials, the Coronary Drug Project, the Aspirin Myocardial Infarction Study, the Anturane Reinfarction Trial, the Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up Program and three drug trials of betablockers, are reviewed from the perspective of both their clinical and methodological significance.", 
    "65": "The pharmacokinetic behavior of sulfinalol hydrochloride, an antihypertensive agent with vasodilator and beta-adrenergic blocking activity, was determined in dogs after intravenous administration. The plasma concentrations of sulfinalol HCl were fit to an open two-compartment body model. The mean values for the alpha- and beta-phase constants were 33.3 hr-1 and 0.52 hr-1, respectively. The mean plasma clearance was 2.30 L/kg X hr. The steady-state volume of distribution was approximately four times the body weight of the animals. The urine data gave renal clearance rates approximately equal to the normal glomerular filtration rate in the dog. About 7.5% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine as free sulfinalol hydrochloride. The time course of the hypotensive effect of sulfinalol appears to be better correlated with calculated tissue levels of drug than with observed plasma levels.", 
    "66": "The acute effects of Metoprolol on blood pressure and heart rate were studied with reference to the plasma level of the betablocker in 10 patients (6 male and 4 female) with permanent moderate uncomplicated hypertension. Each patient was given a single oral dose of 200 mg Metoprolol: blood samples were taken over a 12 hour period at given times for Metoprolol estimation. The blood pressure was measured with a mercury manometer; heart rate was measured lying and during a stress test (glyceryl trinitrate). The antihypertensive effect of Metoprolol was significant from the 4th hour; at the 8th hour the systolic pressure was reduced by 15% and the diastolic pressure by 17% (p less than 0.001). The blood pressure then rose progressively. The heart rate in the recumbent position fell 10 to 15% during the study. The heart rate during the trinitrin test varied linearly with time (r = 0.991, p less than 0.001). The variation in systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not correlate with the plasma Metoprolol level (r = 0.03, and 0.19); no correlation was found between the fall in lying heart rate and the plasma betablocker level. On the other hand, the trinitrin heart rate (at the end of the test) correlated negatively with the logarithm of the plasma Metoprolol (n = 56, r = 0.688, p less than 0.001). These results confirm that the antihypertensive effect of Metoprolol is not directly related to the plasma level of the betablocker. On the other hand, the betablocker effect assessed by the trinitrin test, correlated with the plasma Metoprolol level. This relationship is similar to those previously observed with other betablockers; atenolol and oxprenolol.", 
    "67": "Hypertension and coronary heart disease occupy a decisive position among the cardiovascular concomitant diseases. The article presents the pathophysiological interlinks between these two diseased conditions. It is evident that the left ventricle is in danger of being exposed to ischaemia, which must be considered a major risk factor in anaesthesia and surgery. Pretreatment with beta-blockers and digitalis is discussed. To the present day, no generally valid recommendation can be given for a definite method of anaesthesia. It is of decisive importance to protect the patient against sympathetic stimulation by providing for satisfactory analgesia and sedation. The therapeutical concept in case of undesirable intraoperative states of hypertension is explained.", 
    "68": "A total of 178 patients with labile arterial hypertension were examined for the effect of propranolol and clonidine on the central hemodynamics, plasma renin, dopamine- beta-hydroxylase, urine kallikrein, and blood prekallikrein and kallikrein. The results suggest that basic to changes in the hemodynamics produced by a single administration of propranolol is its beta-adrenoblocking effect proper. The decrease in the general peripheral resistance due to prolonged propranolol therapy may be determined by activation of the blood kallikrein-kinin system and enhancement of the descending inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system because of activation of the central alpha-adrenoreceptors under long-term blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors of the central nervous system. The changes in the hemodynamics produced by low doses of clonidine may be accounted for by its central alpha-adrenomimetic effect.", 
    "69": "Pharmacokinetics of tritium-labeled exaprolol, 1-(2-cyclohexyl[2,4-3H]-3-isopropylamino-2-propanol, a potent beta-adrenergic blocker, was studied in rats. The assay of the parent drug in plasma and excreta was based on extraction into toluene and TLC. In rats elimination half-lives of exaprolol after iv and oral administration of 26.8 and 40.1 hr, respectively, were found; the bioavailability was 26.7%. After oral administration to rats, the drug was rapidly and completely absorbed. The long retention of exaprolol in tissues of iv injected rats was reflected by the steady-state distribution volume of 59.38 liters/kg and the clearance rate of 1.44 liters/hr/kg. The total 3H excreted in urine within 96 hr after iv or oral administration to rats amounted to 47.9 and 47.1% of dose, respectively, and in feces to 34.2 and 29.8%, respectively. The ratio of 3H-exaprolol to total 3H concentration in plasma, urine, and feces of rats indicated a moderately extensive metabolism of the parent drug. The substance was about 50% bound to human serum albumin. The rat erythrocyte/plasma partition coefficient rose with exaprolol concentration."
