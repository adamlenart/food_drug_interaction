    "0": "Previous studies suggest that catecholamines may be involved in the regulation of liver growth. Considerable evidence implicates alpha 1-adrenergic mechanisms in the initiation of hepatocyte proliferation, while the role of beta-adrenoceptors is less clear. We have examined further the adrenergic regulation of hepatocyte DNA synthesis, using primary monolayer cultures. In hepatocytes that were also treated with epidermal growth factor and insulin, epinephrine or norepinephrine added early after the seeding strongly accelerated the rate of S phase entry. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine also stimulated the DNA synthesis, but were less efficient than epinephrine and norepinephrine. Experiments with the alpha 1-receptor blocker prazosine and the beta-receptor blocker timolol showed that the stimulatory effect of norepinephrine consisted of both an alpha 1- and a beta-adrenergic component. The alpha 1-component was most prominent in terms of maximal response at high concentrations of the agonist, but the beta-component contributed significantly and predominated at low concentrations (less than 0.1 microM) of norepinephrine. At later stages (about 40 h) of culturing norepinephrine strongly but reversibly inhibited the cells, acting at a point late in the G1 phase. This inhibition was mimicked by isoproterenol and abolished by timolol but was unaffected by prazosine, suggesting a beta-adrenoceptor-mediated effect. The results confirm the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated stimulatory effect, but also show that beta-adrenoceptors may contribute to the growth stimulation by catecholamines. Furthermore, catecholamines, via beta-adrenoceptors and cyclic AMP, inhibit the G1-S transition, and may thus play a role in the termination of hepatic proliferation.", 
    "1": "The 0-8 hour urinary distributions of the metabolic ratios of sparteine (100 mg), debrisoquine (10 mg) and metoprolol (100 mg) were measured in 165 healthy, unrelated, black Nigerian medical students. There was a weak correlation (rs = 0.51, p < 0.001; n = 82) between the metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (M/HM) and the sparteine/total (2- + 5-) dehydrosparteine (S/DHS) ratios. No significant correlations were found between the debrisoquine/4-hydroxydebrisoquine (D/HD) and M/HM ratios (rs = 0.16, n = 33) and between the D/HD and S/DHS ratios (rs = 0.31, n = 38). Both visual inspection and kernel density analysis of the data suggested the presence of two phenotypic groups for sparteine oxidation, with 4% of the population studied being putative poor metabolizers. In contrast biomodality was not apparent in the distribution of the log10M/HM and log10D/HD ratios. These findings provide evidence for a dissociation in the control of metoprolol, sparteine and debrisoquine oxidation in Nigerians and highlight the difficulties in the interpretation of data from pharmacogenetic studies in different ethnic groups.", 
    "2": "When saponin-permeabilized rat parotid acinar cells were incubated with [adenylate-32P]NAD+, labelling of proteins (33, 27 and 23 kDa) in particulate fractions of the cells was stimulated by isoproterenol. The effect of isoproterenol was completely blocked by a beta-antagonist. Both forskolin or cAMP mimicked the effect of isoproterenol on the labelling. However, an inhibitor of cAMPdPK failed to induce complete inhibition of the effects of isoproterenol, forskolin and cAMP. When the labelled proteins were treated with snake venom phosphodiesterase, neither [32P]5'-AMP nor [32P]phosphoribosyladenosine was released. These results suggest that covalent modification of proteins with NAD+, which is distinct from ADP-ribosylation and cAMPdPK-dependent phosphorylation, is coupled to beta-receptor-cAMP signalling system in rat parotid acinar cells.", 
    "3": "The effect of DL-propranolol on NO release in perfused rat hindquarters was studied by using oxyhemoglobin as a capture system to allow the quantitative assay of NO production. In some experiments the stable prostacyclin metabolite 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (6-keto) was simultaneously assayed. We observed that: (1) DL-propranolol induced an increase in NO and 6-keto release. The dextro isomer was inactive; (2) DL-propranolol-induced NO release was only slightly reduced by acetylsalicylic acid in a concentration that inhibits prostacyclin synthesis, and was abolished by the chemical removal of the endothelium with 3-3 cholamidopropyl dimethylammonium 1-propane sulphonate (CHAPS) applied before or during stimulation; (3) NG-nitro-L-arginine blocked DL-propranolol-induced NO production, an effect that was antagonized by L-arginine but not by its dextro isomer.", 
    "4": "The effects of pindolol and timolol on ischemia reperfusion damage were studied in isolated working rat hearts. Ischemia (15 min) decreased the mechanical function and the energy state, and increased the tissue levels of free fatty acids (FFA). During reperfusion (20 min), the mechanical function did not recover, but the energy state recovered incompletely, whereas FFA increased further. Pindolol (50 microM) accelerated recovery of the mechanical function and the energy state that had been decreased by ischemia during reperfusion, and inhibited the accumulation of FFA during ischemia and reperfusion, especially when it was applied during the whole period of reperfusion. Timolol (50 microM), however, did not accelerate recovery of the mechanical function and the energy state during reperfusion, although it attenuated FFA accumulation during reperfusion. The pindolol-induced recovery of the mechanical function during reperfusion was reduced by timolol. The results suggest that the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of pindolol may play an important role, at least in part, in producing the cardioprotective effect, especially during reperfusion.",

    "9": "Isoprenaline (0.1 microM), in the presence of phentolamine (1 microM) to block autoinhibitory alpha-adrenoceptors, significantly increased the efflux of radioactivity produced by field stimulation (2 Hz for 60 s) from rat isolated atria in which the noradrenergic transmitter stores had been labelled with [3H]noradrenaline. This facilitatory effect of isoprenaline on noradrenergic transmission was not affected by the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712A (0.3 microM). However, the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551 (0.1 microM) not only abolished the facilitatory effect of isoprenaline but reversed it to an inhibitory effect, indicating that the prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors subserving facilitation of noradrenergic transmission in rat atria are of the beta 2-subtype. The inhibitory effect of isoprenaline that was revealed by blockade of beta 2-adrenoceptors was abolished by atenolol (3 microM) in a concentration which markedly reduced the effect of isoprenaline on the rate of atrial beating. This finding suggests that activation of beta 1-adrenoceptors on atrial myocytes by isoprenaline may have resulted in release of one or more substance(s) which inhibited stimulation-induced release of noradrenaline, presumably by activating prejunctional receptors. The inhibitory effect of isoprenaline on noradrenergic transmission was not affected by the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin (10 microM) suggesting that prostaglandins were not involved.", 
    "10": "Sotalol is a beta blocker with class III activity. Few investigators have reported its use in pediatric patients. From August 1985 to May 1990, 66 patients (mean age 8.7 years; range 9 days to 24 years), including 14 infants aged less than 3 months, were treated with oral sotalol alone (n = 46) or in association with digoxin (n = 20). Supraventricular reentrant tachycardia was present in 38 patients (20 with documented preexcitation), atrial flutter in 10 and atrial ectopic tachycardia in 7. Three patients had other types of supraventricular tachycardia. Tachycardia was of ventricular origin in 6 patients and both of supraventricular and ventricular origin in the remaining 2. Mean dose of oral sotalol was 135 mg/m2/day given in 2 doses. Congenital heart disease was present in 28 patients, 14 with previous cardiac surgery, mostly at the atrial level. Prior treatment with 1 or more antiarrhythmic agent had been unsuccessful in 83% of patients. Mean duration of treatment was 13.3 months (range 2 months to 5 years). Overall, treatment was successful in 79% of cases. Highest rate of success was observed in patients with supraventricular reentrant tachycardia with or without preexcitation (89%) and in those with atrial ectopic tachycardia (85.5%). Atrial flutter could be controlled in 60% of cases. Sotalol seemed less effective in ventricular tachycardia with a complete control of the arrhythmia being achieved in only 17%; however, it decreased the number of runs of ventricular tachycardia and the number of ventricular premature complexes in 50% of patients. There were no adverse effects in 89% of patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "We compared cardiovascular responses to various adrenergic agonists in conscious 3-month and 12-month old rats that had been treated with propranolol daily for 7 days, to determine whether changes in beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity induced by abrupt propranolol withdrawal would differ with age. Depressor and tachycardic responses elicited by beta-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol were still reduced during the first 3 days following propranolol withdrawal, but were restored to pretreatment levels, more slowly in 12-month than in 3-month-old rats. Opposite pressor and bradycardic responses to alpha-adrenergic stimulation with phenylephrine did not differ between age groups, either before or after propranolol withdrawal. By contrast, pressor and bradycardic responses produced by combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation with epinephrine after propranolol withdrawal, though unaltered in 3-month-old rats, were enhanced in 12-month-old rats. Hence after sudden propranolol withdrawal beta-adrenergic sensitivity in conscious rats was gradually restored, rather than being enhanced, but more slowly at 12 than at 3 months of age. These results suggest that following abrupt cessation of prolonged propranolol treatment, restoration of normal beta-adrenergic sensitivity becomes delayed in older rats.", 
    "12": "Thermoregulatory (brown adipose tissue temperature) experiments were conducted in age-matched anesthetized, male Sprague-Dawley and Long Evans rats kept at 37 degrees C given unilateral electrical stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus or the lateral preoptic area or after intravenous infusion of norepinephrine HCl (50 micrograms/kg total dose). Unilateral electrical stimulation (0.5 ms pulses of 250 microA at 50 Hz for 30 s) of the ventromedial nucleus or lateral preoptic area caused significant rises (greater than 0.6 degrees C) of intrascapular brown adipose tissue temperature in the Long Evans group only. Norepinephrine infusion (0.1 ml/min for 10 min), or intravenous bolus injection of propranolol HCl (2.5 mg/kg) caused significant yet similar increases (greater than 1.0 degrees C) and decreases (greater than -0.3 degrees C), respectively, of intrascapular brown adipose tissue temperature from pre-administration control temperatures in both Long Evans and Sprague-Dawley groups. The results demonstrate that intrascapular brown adipose tissue sensitivity towards exogenous norepinephrine or propranolol administration is similar between Sprague-Dawley and Long Evans rats acclimated to 21 degrees C as determined by increases in temperature in the intrascapular brown adipose tissue pad. However, intrascapular brown adipose tissue thermogenesis of 21 degrees C-acclimated Long Evans rats is also activated after CNS electrical stimulation of the ventromedial nucleus or lateral preoptic area, an activation not seen in Sprague-Dawley rats suggestive that the latter group has some inhibition of neural pathways that activate brown adipose tissue thermogenesis.", 
    "13": "We studied the relationship between phosphoinositide hydrolysis, phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis, and sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) formation in response to carbachol stimulation in rat parotid acinar cells. Previously, we demonstrated that DAG formation stimulated with 1 microM carbachol was biphasic: the first peak occurred at 5 min and the second one at 20 min. It was also demonstrated that the second peak was regulated in part by a calmodulin/protein kinase C-dependent mechanism. Based on the kinetic analysis of DAG formation and [32P]phosphoinositide breakdown, the first peak of carbachol (1 microM)-stimulated DAG accumulation was found to be related to the breakdown of [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate ([32P]PIP) and [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ([32P]PIP2). The second peak was found to be related to [32P]PIP2 breakdown. Carbachol stimulated the release of [3H]phosphocholine into the medium, indicating that the predominant pathway for phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis was via phospholipase C. Moreover, carbachol stimulated the release of [3H]choline metabolites in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This agonist slightly stimulated the release of [3H]ethanolamine metabolites. A calmodulin/protein kinase C-dependent mechanism was also studied and was found to be involved in carbachol-stimulated phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis; W-7, a calmodulin inhibitor and staurosporine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, inhibited the carbachol (1-microM)-induced release of [3H]choline metabolites at 20 min in a dose-dependent manner, but did not have inhibitory effects at 5 min. These results suggest that the first peak of DAG accumulation induced by carbachol is predominantly associated with the breakdown [32P]PIP and of [32P]PIP2 and that the second peak is predominantly associated with [32P]PIP2 breakdown and phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis.", 
    "14": "The basis of catecholamine-induced activation of glycogen phosphorylase was investigated in adult rat cardiomyocytes isolated from normal and alloxan-diabetic animals. Cells derived from diabetic animals exhibited a hypersensitive response to epinephrine stimulation that was apparent 3 h after cell isolation and was further enhanced on maintenance of the myocytes in culture for 24 h. Normal cells initially lacked the hypersensitive response to epinephrine stimulation, although on maintenance of these cells in culture for 24 h, the hypersensitive response was acquired in vitro. To assess alpha- and beta-adrenergic mediation of the response, normal and diabetic cardiomyocytes were incubated with propranolol, a beta-blocker, before direct alpha 1-receptor stimulation with phenylephrine. Both normal and diabetic myocytes failed to undergo activation of phosphorylase in 3- or 24-h cell cultures. In addition, the effects of epinephrine on phosphorylase activation were completely inhibited by propranolol, whereas prazosin, an alpha-blocker, was unsuccessful. The present data suggest that the hypersensitive response of glycogen phosphorylase in normal and diabetic cardiomyocytes is solely mediated through beta-adrenergic receptor activation.", 
    "15": "Previous studies in humans advanced the concept that cardiac filling pressure and contractility, the primary determinants of ventricular mechanoreceptor discharge, are important determinants of sympathetic outflow during orthostatic stress. Thus, intravenous propranolol greatly attenuated forearm vasoconstrictor response to venous pooling with lower body negative pressure (LBNP). The aim of this study was to reevaluate the experimental support for this concept by using direct measurements of sympathetic nerve activity.", 
    "16": "In 11 healthy humans, we recorded muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) with microelectrodes (peroneal nerve), as well as blood flow in the forearm and calf (venous occlusion plethysmography) at baseline and during graded LBNP. The same experiments were repeated after administration of propranolol (0.15 mg/kg i.v.), which is thought to decrease ventricular mechanoreceptor discharge. The major new findings are that propranolol neither increased baseline MSNA nor attenuated the increases in MSNA during graded orthostatic stress even though in the same subjects, propranolol simultaneously increased the baseline level of vascular resistance in both the forearm and calf and substantially attenuated the increases in regional vascular resistance during orthostatic stress.",

    "22": "Change in DBP at 6 months could be predicted from baseline plasma renin activity or renin index. The DBP was decreased after 6 months of therapy by 2 mm Hg for each unit increase in baseline plasma renin activity and by 0.16 mm Hg for each unit increase in baseline renin index. Patients in the highest renin index quartile had a greater DBP response to atenolol therapy, and patients in the lowest renin index quartile had a greater DBP response to chlorthalidone therapy. Weight loss diet achieved a greater reduction in DBP in patients with higher baseline renin index and had an additive effect on DBP response in both of the drug groups. Patients on a weight loss diet receiving placebo in the highest baseline renin index quartile had a reduction in DBP of 12.4 mm Hg, compared with 4.4 mm Hg in the lowest baseline renin index quartile (P = .009). A low sodium/high potassium diet had a lesser effect than a weight loss diet on pharmacologic therapy. As with the weight loss diet, patients on a low sodium/high potassium diet in the highest baseline renin index quartile had a greater reduction in DBP than patients in the lowest baseline renin index quartile.",

    "24": "The influence of adrenergic and cholinergic mediators on phospholipid secretion in rat sublingual salivary gland cells maintained in the presence of [3H]choline was investigated. The secretion of [3H]choline-containing phospholipids over 30 min period averaged 1.93% of the total cellular labeled phospholipids in the absence of any mediator, and was enhanced by beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, to a greater extent than the cholinergic agonists, pilocarpine and carbachol. A 2.9-fold increase in phospholipid secretion occurred with isoproterenol, while pilocarpine and carbachol evoked only 1.3-fold increase. The effect of isoproterenol was inhibited by alprenolol and that of pilocarpine and carbachol by atropine. In contrast to pilocarpine and carbachol, the enhanced phospholipid secretion due to isoproterenol was accompanied by an increase in cAMP concentration. The secretion of phospholipids was also stimulated by dibutyryl-cAMP and the protein kinase C activator, phorbol myristate acetate, but not by 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate which does not activate protein kinase C. Furthermore, the effects of dibutyryl-cAMP and phorbol myristate acetate were additive. The phospholipids secreted in response to isoproterenol exhibited a 52% decrease in lysophosphatidylcholine, while those secreted in response to pilocarpine and carbachol showed a 21-23% lower content of phosphatidylcholine, and were enriched in lysophosphatidylcholine (2.6-2.8-fold) and sphingomyelin (1.5-1.6-fold). The results indicate that salivary phospholipid secretion remains mainly under beta-adrenergic regulation, while the phospholipid makeup of the secretion is under cholinergic control.", 
    "25": "The effect of d-fenfluramine, 1.5 mg/kg i.p., on meal patterns was studied in rats treated i.p. with 1 mg/kg metergoline or 0.5 mg/kg ritanserin or s.c. with 3 mg/kg (+/-)cyanopindolol. d-Fenfluramine significantly reduced eating rate, meal size and total intake in the first 4 h of testing and the effects were antagonized by metergoline. (+/-)Cyanopindolol reduced total intake and the effect of d-fenfluramine on this measure; the effect of d-fenfluramine on meal size (but not on eating rate) was also reduced by (+/-)cyanopindolol. Ritanserin only reduced the rate of eating and the effect of d-fenfluramine on this measure. The results suggest that 5-HT1 receptors, possibly of the 5-HT1B type, are involved in the ability of d-fenfluramine to cause satiety in freely feeding rats.", 
    "26": "Propranolol treatment (1 mg/kg i.p. twice daily for 8 days) reduced atrial dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (D beta H) activity by 60.5% and lung D beta H activity by 53.5% but did not alter ventricle D beta H activity. Propranolol also significantly reduced atrial noradrenaline (NA) by 66.3%, adrenaline (A) by 40%, dopamine (DA) by 72.4% and lung NA by 46.6% but did not change plasma or cardiac ventricle catecholamines. The addition of propranolol (10(-6) M) to cardiac and lung tissue homogenates in vitro did not inhibit tissue D beta H activities. The results suggest that chronic propranolol treatment inhibits NA synthesis and support the hypothesis of a centrally induced inhibition of sympathetic activity caused by beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "27": "This study was aimed at exploring the role of 5-HT2/5-HT1C neurotransmission in male rat sexual behavior. The administration of the 5-HT2/5-HT1C agonist, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) (1 mg/kg), suppressed sexual activity in most of the animals. The suppressive effect of DOI was antagonized by treatment with amperozide, a selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, in doses which did not by themselves affect sexual activity. In addition, several other serotonin antagonists were tested with varying affinity profiles for 5-HT2/5-HT1C receptors, including ketanserin, ritanserin, and mesulergine. All these compounds antagonized the suppressive action of DOI. In contrast, no antagonizing effect was obtained by treatment with (-)-alprenolol, a 5-HT1A antagonist. The present findings suggest that 5-HT2/5-HT1C receptors might be involved in the neural control of male rat sexual behavior, presumably by exerting an inhibitory influence on the behavior.", 
    "28": "The potencies of the beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, noradrenaline, and the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, fenoterol, at beta-adrenoceptors in portal vein were examined using preparations isolated from control, methimazole-treated or l-thyroxine-treated rats. Tissues were preincubated with phenoxybenzamine (1 mumol/l) to block alpha-adrenoceptors and neuronal and extraneuronal uptake. Fenoterol was approximately 400 times more potent than noradrenaline (-log IC50 7.85 vs. 5.26) in inhibiting the spontaneous contractions of the portal vein. The beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551, was approximately 3000 fold more potent than the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol, in blocking the effects of fenoterol (pA2 9.32 and 5.88 respectively) and 400 times more potent in antagonising noradrenaline (pA2 8.96 vs. 6.23). Treatment of rats with methimazole led to decreased myogenic tone, and treatment with thyroxine to increased tone. beta-Adrenoceptor binding densities and the relative potencies of the agonists and antagonists used were unaffected by methimazole treatment. Thyroxine administration was also without effect on the relative potencies of these compounds. Our data indicate that although the portal vein is a target tissue for thyroxine, as indicated by its influence on myogenic tone, the beta-adrenoceptor population in this preparation, confirmed to be of the beta 2-subtype, is unaffected.", 
    "29": "In order to find a more specific blocker of the cardiac Cl- channel, we examined the effects of anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (9AC) and 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) on the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated decreases in resting potential and intracellular chloride ion activity (aiCl) in guinea-pig papillary muscles by using Cl- ion selective microelectrodes. 9AC (1 mM) significantly inhibited the isoproterenol (1 microM)-induced decreases in resting potential and aiCl in quiescent preparations. However, 1 mM DIDS did not significantly affect the changes in aiCl and resting potential during beta-adrenergic stimulation. Thus, in cardiac cells, 9AC is a more potent blocker of the Cl- channels activated by beta-adrenergic stimulation than DIDS.", 
    "30": "A series of novel arylpiperazines have been prepared in an attempt to incorporate both class II (beta-receptor blocking) and class III antiarrhythmic properties in a single molecule. The key step in the preparation of the new compounds involves a regioselective heterocyclic ring formation. All but four compounds significantly prolonged action potential duration in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers (class III activity). All but one of the compounds demonstrated beta-receptor affinity in a competitive binding assay and three had beta 1-receptor selectivity. Compared to sotalol, a reference class II/III agent, arylpiperazine 7a (4-[(methylsulfonyl)amino]-N-[(4- phenylpiperazin-2-yl)methyl]benzamide) demonstrated beta 1-selectivity and was 1 order of magnitude more potent in the in vitro class III and the beta 1-receptor screens. Compound 7a was evaluated further and found to be effective in preventing programmed electrical stimulation-induced arrhythmias in conscious dogs (class III activity) and against epinephrine-induced arrhythmias in halothane anesthetized dogs (class II activity).", 
    "31": "Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to determine the distribution patterns of 5-CT-sensitive and 5-CT-insensitive binding of [3H]5-HT to high-affinity sites in human cortex, putamen, and globus pallidus. The binding of 3H-5-HT was limited to 5-HT1D sites (5-CT-sensitive) by co-incubating pindolol and mesulergine with [3H]5-HT, and by using 10 microM 5-HT to determine non-specific binding. The difference in the levels of binding between tissues exposed to the 5-CT-containing incubation media and tissue exposed to [3H]5-HT in the presence of 100 nM 5-CT was defined as 5-CT-insensitive binding (5-HT1E). The 5-HT1D receptor density in the frontal cortex was 189 fmol/mg, 226 fmol/mg was present in the globus pallidus, while the density in the putamen was only 28 fmol/mg. The 5-HT1E receptor density was 146 fmol/mg in frontal cortex, 224 fmol/mg in putamen and 140 fmol/mg in globus pallidus. The differential distribution patterns of the high-affinity, 5-CT-sensitive and 5-CT-insensitive [3H]5-HT binding sites indicate that these sites are expressed independently in human brain tissues. These data are supportive of and consistent with previous pharmacological data that led to the division of 5-HT1D receptors into 5-HT1D and 5-HT1E receptors and do not support the division of 5-HT1D receptors into 5-CT-sensitive and 5-CT-insensitive states.", 
    "32": "We tested the hypotheses that the protective effect of intragastric nicotine against ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury is dependent on propranolol- or N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive mechanisms. Propranolol was administered in doses (2 and 20 mg/kg) that provided dose-related blockade of beta-adrenoceptors (significant decreases in heart rate). N-Ethylmaleimide was administered in doses that previously had been shown to increase gastric vascular permeability (10 mg/kg) or inhibit gastric mucosal sulfhydryl compounds (50 mg/kg). At 0.5 hr after these or control subcutaneous pretreatments, the rats received intragastric nicotine (4 mg/kg) or vehicle. One hour later 40% ethanol was given intragastrically. The gastric corpus mucosal lesions were recorded by polaroid photographs after another hour, and their areas measured unbiasedly by computerized image analysis. The results showed that N-ethylmaleimide, but not propranolol, aggravated ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury. The protective effect of intragastric nicotine was not modified by either pretreatment. We conclude that the mechanism mediating intragastric nicotine protection against 40% ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury is independent of propranolol- or N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive mechanisms.", 
    "33": "The plasma protein binding of propranolol has been described as nonrestrictive for its hepatic extraction to explain the observation that propranolol is efficiently removed by the liver, in spite of extensive protein binding. The present study was designed to examine the relationship between propranolol protein binding, metabolism by isolated hepatocytes, and extraction by the isolated perfused rat liver. In isolated hepatocytes, the intrinsic clearance of free drug increased three- to fourfold as albumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) concentrations increased, suggesting that albumin and AAG facilitate the elimination of propranolol by hepatocytes. In the isolated perfused liver, propranolol extraction was almost complete (E = 0.996) in the absence of albumin and AAG. With 40 g/L of albumin and 2 g/L of AAG in the perfusate, the free fraction of propranolol decreased to 0.031, but extraction remained high (E = 0.960). With 40 g/L of albumin and 10 g/L of AAG in the perfusate, the free fraction further decreased to 0.014 and extraction dropped sharply (E = 0.820). The observed relationship between propranolol extraction and the free fraction of propranolol was in good agreement with that predicted using estimates of intrinsic clearance measured in isolated hepatocytes suspensions. These data indicate that propranolol extraction is sensitive to changes in binding at very low free fraction values and suggest a facilitation of propranolol clearance by albumin and AAG.",

In the phosphate buffer, no difference was observed in the hydrolysis rate between the esters of (R)- and (S)-propranolol. In rat plasma and tissue homogenates, hydrolysis of the ester was both accelerated and stereoselective. Hydrolysis of O-acetyl (R)-propranolol was five times faster than that of the (S)-isomer in rat plasma. However, in the liver and intestine homogenates, the (S)-isomer was hydrolyzed faster than the (R)-isomer. Interconversion between the (R)- and (S)-isomers was not observed under the experimental conditions. The same stereoselective hydrolysis was also observed with racemic O-acetyl propranolol. However, observed rate constants for the hydrolysis were lower than those for the pure isomers. These results indicate that enzymatic hydrolysis of O-acetyl propranolol occurred stereoselectively and the selectivity of the plasma enzyme was different from those of liver and intestine enzymes.", 
    "35": "We studied the effect of manual nasolacrimal occlusion on the concentration of timolol in the aqueous humor of eyes of patients undergoing cataract extraction. Aqueous humor samples were obtained at various times after timolol maleate instillation from patients with or without 5 min of nasolacrimal occlusion; aliquots were assayed by HPLC. In patients receiving occlusion treatment, average timolol concentrations were statistically greater than those in control patients both between 15 and 90 min after instillation and also at 180 min. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that occlusion increased the concentration of timolol in the aqueous humor 1.7 times. In both groups, timolol concentrations were highest approximately 1 h after instillation. The decline in aqueous humor timolol concentrations occurred at similar rates in both groups.", 
    "36": "The plasma concentrations of metoprolol enantiomers have been determined by means of a direct phenyl carbamate-cellulose-based chiral high performance liquid chromatography assay using fluorimetric detection. This assay has been used to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of metoprolol enantiomers in the conscious goat. There is evidence that the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol in the goat occurs stereoselectively and that enantiomer-enantiomer pharmacokinetic interactions occur. R-Metoprolol is less effective in reducing the mean arterial blood pressure than S- and R/S-metoprolol.", 
    "37": "1. In the present study, the extent to which baroreflexes contribute to the cardiac effects of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) was assessed in conscious, Long Evans rats chronically instrumented with thoracic electromagnetic flow probes for the measurement of cardiac haemodynamics. 2. L-NAME (10 mg kg-1, i.v.) was administered in the absence (n = 6) and in the presence (n = 7) of atropine (1 mg kg-1) and atenolol (1 mg kg-1). 3. L-NAME caused a marked increase in mean arterial pressure and marked reductions in total peripheral conductance, cardiac output, heart rate, stroke volume, peak thoracic flow and the maximum rate of rise of aortic flow. 4. Administration of atropine, after the maximal bradycardic effect of L-NAME was established, restored the heart rate to resting levels. Concurrently, there was a reduction in stroke volume, such that cardiac output, although transiently elevated, did not show a sustained increase. No other variables were significantly affected by atropine. Additional administration of atenolol had no effect other than to cause a slight bradycardia, such that in the presence of atropine and atenolol, heart rate was not different from that in animals receiving atropine and atenolol before L-NAME. 5. In the presence of atropine and atenolol, L-NAME had similar pressor, vasoconstrictor and cardiac haemodynamic effects to those in untreated animals, although the bradycardia was significantly attenuated. However, there was still a significant reduction in heart rate following L-NAME in the presence of atropine and atenolol.6. These results indicate that the major component of the bradycardia following L-NAME is indirect and mediated through an increase in vagal efferent activity. However, the substantial reduction in cardiac function caused by L-NAME is not dependent on the autonomic control of the heart but rather, may depend on the increase in afterload and/or a direct effect of L-NAME on the heart and/or its vasculature.", 
    "38": "Macrophage cytocidal activation requires the sequential impingement on the macrophage of a priming stimulus (interferon [IFN] alpha, beta, or gamma) and a triggering stimulus (such as polyinosinic acid:polycytidylic acid [poly [I:C]] or bacterial lipopolysaccharide). The mechanism of progression from the IFN-primed state to the cytocidal state is poorly understood. By quantifying the level of expression of a gene product (complement component factor B [Bf]) associated with cytocidal activation and through the use of phenotypically distinct populations of macrophages (unprimed and IFN-primed), we have investigated the functional necessity of changes in intracellular concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca2+]i) in signaling the transition from the primed to the cytocidal state. Elevating the [Ca2+]i by incubation of unprimed macrophages with the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, failed to induce the expression of Bf. By contrast, Bf was expressed at high levels when IFN-primed macrophages were exposed to ionomycin, suggesting that priming induced within the macrophages the capacity to respond to a nonspecific change in [Ca2+]i. Quantification of the [Ca2+]i in response to exposure to ionomycin revealed an initial transient elevation, followed by a secondary sustained component. No differences in these changes were observed between unprimed and IFN-primed macrophages. We therefore questioned if changes in [Ca2+]i were also implicated in the transition between the primed and the cytocidal state using the ligand, poly [I:C]. In contrast to ionomycin, incubation of IFN-primed macrophages with poly [I:C] did not sustain measurable increases in [Ca2+]i, yet fully stimulated the transition from the IFN primed to the cytocidal state. However, incubation of IFN-primed macrophages with poly [I:C] in the presence of 1) a Ca2+/ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid buffer calculated to clamp the extracellular concentration of free calcium ions to a value approximately equal to the resting [Ca2+]i; 2) the calcium channel blocker verapamil; or 3) the intracellular Ca2+ antagonists (W-7, W-13, and TMB-8) substantially inhibited the induction of Bf. Collectively, these data support the following conclusions. First, that changes in [Ca2+]i comprise an important element in the induction of progression from the IFN-primed to the cytocidal state. Second, the failure to detect global changes in [Ca2+]i in response to the ligand, poly [I:C], suggests that changes in [Ca2+]i or Ca2+ movement may occur in either a spatially restricted or in an asynchronous cyclical fashion and are not detected by population fluorescence measurements. Third, the source of the relevant Ca2+ is extracellular. Fourth, our findings suggest that priming influences macrophage functional responses at a locus that is distal to the changes in [Ca2+]i, thereby potentially allowing signaling processes to be utilized to initiate different cellular responses.", 
    "39": "A number of factors affecting the stability of propranolol HCl during electrophoretic control were investigated. It was found that significant degradation of propranolol HCl and hydrolysis of water occurred when a current of 15 mA was used with platinized electrodes. This degradation was thought to be due to decomposition of propranolol HCl at the electrodes. Degradation could be significantly reduced by using uncoated platinum electrodes and currents in the range of 0 to 2.5 mA, while still allowing control of drug delivery rates. Electrode reaction processes were found at high ionic strengths and high drug concentrations but were not thought to be associated with drug decomposition.", 
    "40": "Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) improved mean arterial pressure (MAP) and myocardial contractility (dp/dtmax, -dp/dtmax, Vpm, and Vmax) and increased plasma epinephrine levels significantly at 10 min after TRH treatment in rabbits following shock, but the effects of TRH on MAP and myocardial contractility disappeared in reserpinized rabbits (4 mg/kg, 24 hr pre-treatment, iv). TRH had no effect on myocardial contractility and MAP at 20 and 30 min post-treatment in rabbits pre-treated with the beta adrenergic blocker propranolol (1 mg/kg, 1 hr before TRH treatment, iv), but the alpha adrenergic blocker phenoxybenzamine did not affect these responses to TRH. Experiments in vitro show that although TRH (10(-3) to 10(-8) M) had no direct effects on the isolated heart, left atrium, and aortic strip, it did potentiate the inotropic effects of isoprenaline and dopamine on the left atrium. These results suggest that the antishock effects of TRH are related to adrenergic systems, perhaps acting on the sympathomedullary system to secrete epinephrine and sensitize the beta receptors, but not alpha receptors. Thus, TRH improves cardiac contractility, cardiac output, and hemodynamics during hemorrhagic shock. The sensitization of the beta adrenergic and dopamine receptors may play an important role in the direct peripheral cardiovascular mechanism of TRH effects.", 
    "41": "The reactions of cardiac frequencies of 10 diabetic persons, seven of them dependent on insulin, aged 45.5 +/- 11.8 years, having had diabetes for 12.5 +/- 7.2 years, were investigated with the aid of provocations by a tilting table under selective pharmacological blockades of 1) the parasympathetic system (atropine 0.04 mg/kg body-weight), 2) sympathetic system (propranolol 0.2 mg/kg body-weight), and 3) of both systems (autonomic blockade). These reactions were compared with the reactions of 13 healthy subjects of comparable age (31.6 +/- 9.4 years), as well as with a group of elderly but healthy persons of 74.5 +/- 8.6 years. The well-known age-dependent disturbance of the vegetative control-system, characterized by the loss of sympathetic as well as parasympathetic efficiencies, was demonstrated by our study of different ages of subjects. Remarkable was that, in the group of diabetics, in principle, identical patterns of disturbance could be demonstrated in the sympathetic as well as in the parasympathetic systems, but also in the course of cardiac frequency after autonomic blockades. The only difference was that these patterns of disturbance already occur at younger ages. Therefore, one can possibly describe the harmful effect of diabetes on the autonomic nervous system as an acceleration of the process of degeneration, which we also find in connection with \"biological aging\".", 
    "42": "We compared the reactions of heart rate in long-term ECG as well as the heart rates and the blood pressures in orthostatic provocation tests using pharmacological blockades in 14 young human subjects aged 19 to 33 years (mean age = 22 +/- 2.2 years) with those of 16 healthy subjects between 67 and 89 years (m = 74 +/- 9.4 years). The blockades were carried out (following the schedule of Jose) first with only propranolol (0.2 mg/kg BW), then propranolol plus atropine (0.04 mg/kg BW), and, finally, only atropine was applied. For the interpretation of the frequency profiles in the long-term ECG prestudies were carried out with dogs, whose high vegetative tension provided us with essential knowledge about the specific type of the autonomous stimulation underlying the respective frequency reaction. Comparing the profiles between old and young human subjects the complete loss of instant reactions in the elderly can be stated. Variations of the heart rate result only from the modulation of the sympathetic stimulation. The \"intrinsic heart rate (IHR)\" after propranolol plus atropine is still below resting heart rate in the elderly, whereas IHR exceeded the resting heart rate in the younger subjects by nearly 50%. Thus, the basically initial vegetative situation is that, in the younger subjects, their resting heart rates are reached by a permanent parasympathetic slow-down of the IHR, whereas the elderly have to accelerate their slow IHR by permanent sympathetic stimulation in order to reach their \"resting\" heart rates. The orthostatic provocation tests with the respective blockades prove an age-dependent decrease in the sympathetic system and in the parasympathetic control. A down-regulation of the beta-receptors as a consequence of the permanent sympathetic drive is probable.", 
    "43": "Testicular function was assessed in nine men aged 17 to 35 years and seven men aged 36 to 46 years with Graves' disease. Levels of total testosterone, estradiol, sex hormone binding globulin, luteinizing hormone, and follicle stimulating hormone, and gonadotropin responses to gonadotropin releasing hormone were significantly greater than these levels and responses in age-matched controls. Although the percentage of free testosterone was lower than control values in the hyperthyroid men, calculated levels of free testosterone were not different from normal. Lower than normal percentages of free estradiol values resulted in higher than normal calculated free estradiol levels. As a result, the free testosterone/free estradiol ratio in the men with Graves' disease was lower than normal. Although mean sperm densities in the hyperthyroid men were not different from control values, the percent forward progressive motility of sperm from these men was significantly lower than control values. The hormonal and seminal abnormalities corrected when the patients became euthyroid after radioiodine therapy. The results of this study indicate that hyperthyroid men may have abnormalities in their hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axes.", 
    "44": "To minimize ocular discomfort while maintaining efficacy, a delivery system for a topical cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, betaxolol was developed. Betaxolol was formulated at 0.25% concentration in a cationic exchange resin, as a suspension. A polyacrylic acid polymer was added to increase viscosity and to increase residence time in the cul-de-sac. No significant settling was observed throughout a four-week observation period. Thus, resuspension of the formulation by frequent shaking was not required for uniformity. In rabbits, the ocular bioavailability of 0.25% betaxolol suspension was equivalent to that of 0.5% betaxolol solution.",

The calcium deposition progressed rapidly to involve 90% of the right cornea. Right penetrating keratoplasty was performed with subsequent visual rehabilitation of the patient. Left tectonic penetrating keratoplasty was performed 8 weeks later after corneal perforation. The corneal specimens were examined by light and electron microscopy, which showed an atypical calcareous degeneration involving Bowman's layer as well as the full thickness of the stroma. Transmission electron microscopy showed the granular calcification to consist of extracellular, radially orientated aggregates of fine, needle-shaped crystals. Both transplants remained clear with no evidence of postoperative recurrence. To our knowledge this is the first report of bilateral penetrating keratoplasty for acute calcareous degeneration.",

    "47": "The authors executed a two-period, randomized, double-masked, crossover study comparing once-daily to twice-daily levobunolol hydrochloride (0.5%) in 20 patients with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Modified diurnal curves were performed at four times for each study arm: baseline, day 1, day 14, and day 28. The mean diurnal corrected decrease in IOP from baseline ranged from 16% +/- 11% to 22% +/- 9% when the subjects were treated twice daily, and from 14% +/- 10% to 18% +/- 8% when the same subjects were treated once daily. At day 1, patients had a significantly greater IOP lowering after twice-daily therapy than after once-daily therapy (P less than 0.05). At 14 and 28 days, there was no clinically significant difference between the two treatment regimens. The results of our crossover study suggest that once-daily treatment with levobunolol (0.5%) is as effective as twice-daily treatment.", 
    "48": "Recent work from our laboratory suggests that a complex interaction exists between ovarian and adrenal steroids in the regulation of preovulatory gonadotropin secretion. Ovarian estradiol serves to set the neutral trigger for the preovulatory gonadotropin surge, while progesterone from both the adrenal and the ovary serves to (1) initiate, (2) synchronize, (3) potentiate and (4) limit the preovulatory LH surge to a single day. Administration of RU486 or the progesterone synthesis inhibitor, trilostane, on proestrous morning attenuated the preovulatory LH surge. Adrenal progesterone appears to play a role in potentiating the LH surge since RU486 still effectively decreased the LH surge even in animals ovariectomized at 0800 h on proestrus. The administration of ACTH to estrogen-primed ovariectomized (ovx) immature rats caused a LH and FSH surge 6 h later, demonstrating that upon proper stimulation, the adrenal can induce gonadotropin surges. The effect was specific for ACTH, required estrogen priming, and was blocked by adrenalectomy or RU486, but not by ovariectomy. Certain corticosteroids, most notably deoxycorticosterone and triamcinolone acetonide, were found to possess \"progestin-like\" activity in the induction of LH and FSH surges in estrogen-primed ovx rats. In contrast, corticosterone and dexamethasone caused a preferential release of FSH, but not LH. Progesterone-induced surges of LH and FSH appear to require an intact N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) neurotransmission line, since administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK801, blocked the ability of progesterone to induce LH and FSH surges. Similarly, NMDA neurotransmission appears to be a critical component in the expression of the preovulatory gonadotropin surge since administration of MK801 during the critical period significantly diminished the LH and PRL surge in the cycling adult rat. FSH levels were lowered by MK801 treatment, but the effect was not statistically significant. The progesterone-induced gonadotropin surge appears to also involve mediation through NPY and catecholamine systems. Immediately preceding the onset of the LH and FSH surge in progesterone-treated estrogen-primed ovx. rats, there was a significant elevation of MBH and POA GnRH and NPY levels, which was followed by a significant fall at the onset of the LH surge. The effect of progesterone on inducing LH and FSH surges also appears to involve alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenergic neuron activation since prazosin and yohimbine (alpha 1 and 2 blockers, respectively) but not propranolol (a beta-blocker) abolished the ability of progesterone to induce LH and FSH surges. Progesterone also caused a dose-dependent decrease in occupied nuclear estradiol receptors in the pituitary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "49": "The aim of this study was to determine whether the circadian cycle of core temperature (Tc) and oxygen consumption (VO2) in juvenile rats is correlated with changes in the thermogenic activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT). Nine-day-old rat pups derived from two colonies with 12:12 h light-dark cycles 180 degrees out of phase were artificially reared in continuous light for 12-48 h while Tc and VO2 were recorded. For measurement of GDP binding half the pups from each colony were killed during the maximum phase of their circadian Tc cycle and the other half during the minimum phase. During the maximum phase (0.5-2 h after lights-off in the colony of origin), when Tc was 36.1 +/- 0.1 degrees C, GDP binding (pmol/mg protein) was 575 +/- 31 (n = 19). During the minimum phase (0.5-2 h after lights-on), when Tc was 32.9 +/- 0.5 degrees C, GDP binding was 361 +/- 47 (n = 19). Moreover, the correlations between Tc, VO2, and GDP binding determined during the maximum plateau of the circadian cycle differ substantially from those determined during the minimum phase. Consequently, developmental studies of thermoregulation and BAT activity in suckling pups are seriously compromised if circadian phase is neglected.", 
    "50": "The dynamic effects of 1) brief bursts of vagal stimuli and 2) changing heart periods (A-A interval) on the atrioventricular conduction time (AVCT) were studied in open-chest, anesthetized (pentobarbital, 30 mg/kg) dogs (n = 8) under beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol, 1 mg/kg). Four different atrial and/or vagal stimulation paradigms were used to quantitate the interactions between these two separate effects. We measured the AVCT responses to identical vagal stimuli both when the heart was paced and when it was not paced. When the heart was not paced, we collected and stored in computer memory the sequences of dynamically changing heart periods that followed each vagal stimulus burst. Later, without vagal stimuli, we played these sequences of changing intervals back into the atrial pacing electrodes and measured the subsequent AVCT responses to those changes of heart period alone in the absence of vagal activity. We also measured the AVCT responses when we played these intervals back into the atrial pacing electrodes but when identical vagal stimuli were simultaneously applied, so as to absolutely fix the site of atrial activation. We found that these two separate effects of vagal stimuli and changing A-A intervals on AVCT were not linearly additive. For example, the response of the atrioventricular (AV) node to the two combined effects was less than the linear sum of the AV response to the two separate perturbations. Our results further suggest strongly that shifts in the pacemaker site may not be an important mechanism for the paradoxical response of the AV node to vagal stimulation under the present experimental conditions.", 
    "51": "Pharmacotherapy is the mainstay for patients with persistent headaches. When simple analgesics can no longer be used, combination analgesics are prescribed. Symptomatic medications also include antiemetics, ergot derivatives, corticosteroids, neuroleptics, and narcotics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used both symptomatically and prophylactically, and are the treatment of choice for menstrual migraine. Exertional migraine, benign orgasmic cephalalgia, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, cough headache, and \"ice-pick\" headache are treated with indomethacin. Ergotamine tartrate is often recommended when simple or combination analgesics do not relieve headaches. Dihydroergotamine (DHE) is effective for treating intractable headache; because it has fewer side effects than ergotamine, it is tolerated by patients unable to tolerate other ergotamine preparations. DHE is administered IM and, for occasional use, patients can be taught self-injection. Repetitive IV DHE therapy for chronic severe headaches requires hospitalization; most patients become headache-free within 3 days. Patients who refuse hospitalization, do not respond to the drug, or are not suitable candidates for DHE therapy may receive a short course of a corticosteroid, a neuroleptic or, rarely, a narcotic. For frequent headaches, prophylactic treatment usually begins with a tricyclic antidepressant or a beta blocker.", 
    "52": "The level of plasminogen activators was measured in 12 volunteers at rest and after maximum exercise. Two formulations of a beta-blocker \"propranolol,\" or placebo, were given (oral dose, 10 mg) 2 h before exercise commenced. At weekly intervals over 21 d, randomized double-blind, cross-over trials were conducted. Two hours after drug/placebo administration, subjects exercised to maximal capacity using an incremental exercise protocol on a bicycle ergometer. Before and 2 h after drug/placebo administration and immediately after maximum exercise, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen consumption were measured, venous blood was removed, and plasma separated for the measurement of plasminogen activators using the fibrin plate method. Duplicate portions of plasma were taken: portion 1 for determination of total plasminogen activators activity, by the addition of dextran sulphate and flufenamic acid; portion 2 to assay extrinsic plasminogen activator, intrinsic plasminogen activator being blocked by the addition of C1-inactivator. Resting and postmaximum exercise heart rates showed significant decreases (P less than 0.05), with a nonsignificant difference in the resting level of extrinsic and intrinsic activators when the subjects were premedicated with either of the two formulations. Total and extrinsic activities, but not intrinsic activity, were significantly increased (P less than 0.05) to maximum exercise when subjects were given placebo. However, premedication with the drug formulations 1 and 2 significantly decreased (P less than 0.05) the normal total and extrinsic activities response to maximum exercise, with no effect on the intrinsic activity.

While metoprolol prevented the cardiovascular effects of adrenaline infiltration, propranolol pretreatment was associated with a highly significant increase (P less than 0.01) in mean arterial pressure and a significant decrease (P less than 0.05) in heart rate. These results confirm the potentially serious interaction of propranolol and adrenaline during anaesthesia, and support the use of metoprolol instead, to obtund the cardiovascular effects of adrenaline infiltration.", 
    "54": "The effect of gallopamil on the late-phase response to inhaled allergen was evaluated in six young adults with allergic asthma in a crossover manner. During 2 study days, subjects received 20 mg of inhaled gallopamil or placebo 30 minutes before challenge with the same dose of allergen. In addition, a histamine challenge was performed 1 1/2 hours before and 24 hours after allergen challenge. On 2 additional study days, in the absence of allergen, basal airway responsiveness to histamine was measured before and after gallopamil or placebo administration. During the early phase, the mean +/- SD decrease in FEV1 was 28.0% +/- 11.3% after placebo and 25.1% +/- 8.4% after gallopamil administration (p greater than 0.05; beta = 0.14). During the late phase, the maximum decrease in FEV1 was 26.9% +/- 11.9% after placebo and 25.3% +/- 10.3% after gallopamil administration (p greater than 0.05; beta = 0.21). Airway reactivity to histamine 24 hours after allergen challenge could not be measured in three subjects after gallopamil administration and in one subject after placebo administration because of persistent bronchospasm. In contrast, basal responsiveness to histamine in the absence of allergen was modestly decreased by gallopamil. Since gallopamil is one of the most potent calcium channel blockers when it is administered by the inhaled route, it is unlikely that this group of drugs will be clinically useful for allergic asthma.",

No significant difference in maximum or minimum blood velocity or resistive index was detected between vessels 1 and 2, although significant differences were noted between both these vessels and vessel 3 (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.001, respectively). These regional variations are unaffected by small but significant rises in pulse (P less than 0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (P less than 0.01) induced by postural change. No significant change within each vessel was recorded in response to posture, reflecting autoregulation within these vessels. Using a similar technique, 10 healthy volunteers were studied at baseline and at 2 hr and 3 d following the unilateral instillation of 0.5% timolol eye drops. A fall in resistive index was recorded in vessel 3 for both eyes (P less than 0.05, timolol administered eye; P less than 0.01 timolol-free eye). This effect was independent of any simultaneous fall in intraocular pressure that occurred only in the eye receiving timolol drops (P less than 0.01).

    "58": "The efficacy and safety of oral nadolol in supraventricular tachycardia were evaluated prospectively in 27 children (median age 5.5 years). Fifteen patients had an unsuccessful trial of digoxin therapy. Intravenous nadolol was given to seven patients during electrophysiologic study; five of these had an excellent response and two had a partial response (25% decrease in tachycardia rate). Six of these patients had a similar response to oral nadolol. Twelve patients received both propranolol and nadolol. Among six patients, intravenous propranolol was successful in four and unsuccessful in two; all six had a similar response to oral nadolol. With oral propranolol, tachycardia was well controlled in four patients and persistent in two; five of five patients had a similar response to oral nadolol. Twenty-six patients were treated with oral nadolol; the arrhythmia was well controlled in 23, 2 had recurrent tachycardia and 1 patient had tachycardia at a 25% slower rate. The effective dose of nadolol ranged between 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg body weight once daily (median dose 1 mg/kg per day). During follow-up (3 to 36 months), compliance and tolerance were excellent; excluding 2 patients with reactive airway disease who developed wheezing, only 3 (12%) of 24 had side effects necessitating a change in drug therapy. Once a day nadolol is a safe and effective agent in the management of supraventricular tachycardia in children. Its long-term efficacy can be predicted by the short-term response to intravenous nadolol or propranolol during programmed electrophysiologic study.",

Half of the patients (n = 6) were randomized to a treatment group receiving intravenous infusion of propranolol in combination with the meal. No significant effects were observed on systemic hemodynamics after the meal alone. Heart rate (-14%; P less than 0.01) and cardiac index (-24%; P less than 0.01) decreased after meal in combination with propranolol. The mean hepatic venous pressure gradient increased significantly after ingestion of the meal alone with a maximal effect after 30 minutes (+13%; P less than 0.05) and returned to baseline values after 2 hours. Meal in combination with propranolol had no significant effect on the hepatic venous pressure gradient. Hepatic blood flow increased substantially after the meal alone with a maximal effect after 30 minutes (+28%; P less than 0.01), whereas no significant effect was observed after meal in combination with propranolol. Azygos blood flow increased significantly after the meal alone (+36%; P less than 0.05), whereas this effect was abolished in combination with propranolol. In conclusion, ingestion of a peroral mixed meal in cirrhotic patients has, contrary to what is observed in normal controls, no effects on systemic hemodynamics. Substantial changes in splanchnic hemodynamics were observed, and these effects were all abolished when the meal was administered in combination with propranolol.",

The portal pressure-reducing effect of propranolol is mediated by splanchnic arterial constriction, which decreases portal flow. A double-blind randomized control study (crossover on 2 consecutive days) was designed to compare the effects of propranolol vs. placebo on portal flow in cirrhotic patients during fasting and after a standardized meal. Portal flow was measured with an ATL Ultramark 8 echo-Doppler system (Advanced Technological Laboratories, Bothel, WA) in 23 cirrhotic patients. Fasting portal flow and heart rate were obtained at baseline and 2 hours after the administration of propranolol or placebo. A standard test meal was then given, and measurements were repeated 30 minutes later. Thirteen patients (group 1) received placebo on day 1 and propranolol on day 2, whereas 10 patients (group 2) received propranolol on day 1 and placebo on day 2. In group 1 patients, heart rate declined by 20% (P less than 0.0001) and portal flow decreased by 12% (P less than 0.05) after propranolol administration. Similar reductions were found in heart rate (-21%, P less than 0.0001) and portal flow (-17%, P less than 0.001) for group 2 patients. For all 23 patients, 2 hours after propranolol administration, heart rate declined by 21% (P less than 0.0001) and portal blood flow was reduced by 14% (P less than 0.0001). The 10 patients who received propranolol on day 1 (group 2) showed a carryover effect of propranolol on day 2. On day 2, baseline portal flow and heart rate values were significantly lower than baseline values on day 1. This long-lasting effect of a single dose of propranolol may be caused by the longer half-life of propranolol in cirrhotic patients. The postprandial portal blood flow percentage increase after the meal was similar for both placebo and propranolol. Propranolol did not blunt postprandial hyperemia. However, whereas the absolute value of blood flow after the meal increased significantly in comparison with baseline in placebo-treated patients (P less than 0.001), this did not occur with propranolol. Furthermore, in propranolol-treated patients the absolute value of blood flow after the meal was lower than in placebo-treated patients. This may constitute a protective effect of propranolol in portal hypertension.", 
    "61": "The total variability associated with the pharmacokinetic disposition of seven therapeutic agents was decomposed into its source components. After differentiating and isolating random components from fixed uniform components of variance, the proportional contribution of random intersubject and intrasubject variance was evaluated. Statistical analysis utilized a mixed-effects probabilistic model which incorporated both random effects and fixed day-to-day effects. In some cases, time-within-day diurnal effects were also incorporated. While significant intersubject effects were found for all seven drugs studied, three of them were characterized by predominant intrasubject variance. Since intrasubject variance represents a measure of the stability of drug disposition, characterization of its relative magnitude is fundamentally important in assessing the therapeutic consequences of a given treatment at any given time. Significant diurnal effects were found which were strikingly invariant.", 
    "62": "Serotonin (5HT) binding sites in autonomic portions of the dorsomedial medulla oblongata of the rat were localized using autoradiographic techniques with radioactive ligands that express high affinity for the 5HT1 (3H-5HT), 5HT1A (3H-8OH-DPAT), or 5HT1B (125I-CYP with isoproterenol) receptor subtypes. 5HT1A sites were densely distributed in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), with the highest densities localized to the interstitial subnucleus and the central subnucleus. 5HT1B sites were also found in the NTS, with the highest densities localized to the substantia gelatinosa subnucleus. The dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve and nucleus ambiguus exhibited low densities of 5HT1B sites. However, the nucleus intercalatus, a cerebellar relay nucleus that also contains dendrites of vagal parasympathetic preganglionic neurons and receives autonomic forebrain afferent input, showed very dense 5HT1B sites. The promontorium, paratrigeminal islands, and the dorsomedial portion of the trigeminal nucleus (DM5), which are areas of viscerosomatic integration, exhibited high densities of both 5HT1A and 5HT1B sites. The area postrema contained low levels of both 5HT1A and 5HT1B sites. Visceral deafferentation via cervical vagotomy or nodose ganglionectomy caused a significant decrease in 5HT1A sites in the interstitial subnucleus of the NTS ipsilateral to the lesion. No changes were seen in 5HT1B sites. These studies suggest that 5HT1A and 5HT1B sites are involved in the processing of visceral sensory information in the NTS and associated areas. Based upon viscerotopic organization of the NTS, 5HT1A sites appear preferentially distributed in portions of the NTS that are associated with the coordination of swallowing, respiration, and cardiovascular function, while 5HT1B sites appear preferentially distributed in areas of the NTS associated with gastrointestinal, hepatic, pancreatic, and cardiovascular function. However, since these association were not absolute and there was a great deal of overlap between the two sites, speculation regarding their specific functions in autonomic control must await pharmacological examination.", 
    "63": "Serotonin (5HT) binding sites in the medulla oblongata of the rat were localized using autoradiographic techniques with radioactive ligands that express high affinity for the 5HT1 (3H-5HT), 5HT1A (3H-80H-DPAT), or 5HT1B (125I-CYP with isoproterenol) receptor subtypes. 5HT1A sites were concentrated primarily in certain sensory regions of the medulla and in regions that contain serotonergic neurons. 5HT1B sites were diffusely distributed throughout the reticular formation and motor regions as well as being localized to certain sensory regions. A surprising finding was an association of 5HT1B binding sites with the corticospinal tract. 3H-5HT binding generally reflected the combined pattern of 5HT1A and 5HT1B sites but was also extremely dense in the choroid plexus, which exhibited virtually no 5HT1A or 5HT1B ligand binding. Presumably this binding, which was blocked by ketanserin, corresponds to 5HT1C sites. Administration of the serotonergic neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine reduced 5HT1A binding sites in regions of the medulla that contain serotonergic neuronal cell bodies. 5HT1B binding was not significantly altered in any area of the medulla. These studies indicate an important role for 5HT1A ligands in the processing of visceral and somatic sensory information, in regulation of certain cerebellar afferent projections, and in the regulation of serotonergic neuronal activity. 5HT1B ligands would be expected to regulate visceral and somatic efferent activity, as well as sensory information and reticular efferent activity, and might presynaptically regulate cortical inputs to the brain stem and spinal cord.", 
    "64": "Seventy-six hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were randomized to receive felodipine or felodipine plus metoprolol in a double-blind parallel-group study. The doses of each treatment regimen were titrated to obtain a diastolic blood pressure (BP) of less than 95 mmHg. The duration of the treatment was 9 months. At the end of the study, BP was significantly reduced in both groups, and the reduction did not differ between the groups. Left ventricular posterior wall and septum thickness were significantly and similarly reduced in both groups. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic end diameters were not significantly changed. Left ventricular mass (LVM) was significantly and similarly reduced in both treatment groups, as was the ratio of LVM and left ventricular end diastolic volume. In conclusion, felodipine and the combination of felodipine and metoprolol reduced left ventricular hypertrophy to the same extent when BP was similarly reduced.", 
    "65": "Twenty patients whose systemic hypertension was not controlled with chronic beta-blocker therapy were studied to evaluate the acute (first dose), short-term (4 weeks) and chronic (6 to 12 months) effects of the calcium antagonist felodipine on blood pressure (BP), left ventricular (LV) anatomy and function and on plasma norepinephrine. The first dose of felodipine rapidly reduced total peripheral resistance and BP, associated with significant increases in heart rate, cardiac output and plasma norepinephrine. During chronic therapy, at the end of the dosing interval (12 hours), significant decreases in BP persisted with minimal changes in the other variables. However, even after 1 year of therapy BP after dosing again rapidly decreased associated with 50 to 100% increases in plasma norepinephrine and small increases in heart rate and cardiac output. Despite the marked decreases in systolic BP, LV wall thickness and mass showed only small decreases (LV mass -- 17 +/- 7 g/m2 after 1 year) and significant LV hypertrophy persisted after 1 year. Both average systolic BP and plasma norepinephrine were significant determinants of LV mass over the duration of the study. It is concluded that during chronic treatment with the twice-daily tablet formulation of felodipine, major daily fluctuations in BP persist associated with persisting sympathetic hyperactivity. The latter may play a role in the modest regression of LV hypertrophy despite 30 to 40 mm Hg decreases in systolic BP for 1 year.", 
    "66": "The effects of chronic moderate (15%) ethanol consumption and ageing on rat hepatic cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activities were examined using diazepam, nordazepam, d-benzphetamine, erythromycin, ethylmorphine and nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) as substrates. In addition, the effects of moderate ethanol alone on the oxidation of metoprolol, morphine and temazepam were examined. Cytochrome P450 specific content increased significantly only in the 6-week ethanol-treated rats, and no changes in percentage liver to body weights were apparent in any of the ethanol-treated animals compared with pair-fed controls. Only cytochrome P450IIIA enzyme activities displayed age-related decreases, these being identified in the pair-fed animals. C3-hydroxylation of diazepam and nordazepam (36% of controls) and N-demethylation of erythromycin and ethylmorphine (58% and 64% of controls) were decreased in 6-week ethanol-treated animals, these effects being less pronounced in the 12, 24 and 48-week ethanol-treated groups. The decrease seen for diazepam and d-benzphetamine N-demethylation caused by ethanol consumption was approximately 80% of control groups for the duration of the treatment. NDMA and morphine N-demethylations were increased to 120% of control activities and metoprolol alpha-hydroxylase was increased to 140% of control activities at 6 weeks, whilst metoprolol O-demethylase activity remained unaltered. NDMA N-demethylase activity showed a two-fold induction at 24 and 48 weeks of ethanol treatment, compared with corresponding pair-fed control groups. These results support previous findings from this laboratory showing that the same or similar P450IIIA family isozymes are involved in the C3-hydroxylation of diazepam and nordazepam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "The task was to investigate secretory activity of sets of tissue basophils of the thyroid and parathyroids during administration of isoproterenol (novodrin) and propranolol (obsidan); 32 rats, divided into 2 groups, were given a single intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg of isoproterenol (the 1 st group) and 2.5. mg of propranolol (the 2nd group) with their subsequent decapitation with a 12-minute interval for 3 h. Six rats were controls. Increased tissue activity of tissue basophils was noted and interpreted as a result of elevated secretion of calcium regulating hormones developing under the influence of beta-adrenergic drugs.", 
    "68": "We studied whether small doses of propranolol given orally have an effect on headaches that are associated with intravenous cyclosporine therapy. In seven patients who had severe cephalalgia associated with intravenous cyclosporine post-bone marrow transplant, oral propranolol promptly relieved the symptoms in four patients. Intravenous propranolol was not effective in one patient who was unable to take oral medications. Propranolol should be considered as an alternative to chronic narcotics in patients with headaches due to cyclosporine.", 
    "69": "This communication reports on the effects of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on the oxidative metabolism of propranolol by the homogenate of the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2. The formation of multiple metabolites was monitored in the absence and presence of 0.1 to 2.0% of DMSO. For the primary cytochrome P450-mediated pathways, ring oxidation was significantly reduced by 1.3 to 2.0% DMSO, whereas side-chain oxidation was not affected. A gradual inhibition of the oxidative deamination of N-desisopropylpropranolol to its glycol metabolite was seen with 20% inhibition at a DMSO concentration of 0.1% and a maximum 75% inhibition at a DMSO concentration of 0.7%. This highly selective inhibitory effect of DMSO on oxidative drug metabolism appears to be directed towards MAO type A.", 
    "70": "The influence of aminergic pathways on basal and stimulated vasopressin (AVP) release was studied in conscious rats, the stimulus for hormone release being an intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of 5 microliters 0.85M sodium chloride. The animals were treated with either phenoxybenzamine, propranolol or haloperidol prior to administration of the central hypertonic stimulus. Phenoxybenzamine elevated basal plasma vasopressin concentrations, while propranolol and haloperidol had no effect. The secretion of AVP in response to the hypertonic stimulus was potentiated by phenoxybenzamine and haloperidol, but the effect of propranolol was equivocal. The antagonists had no effect on basal arterial pressure at the time of hypertonic saline administration or the pressor response to ICV sodium chloride.", 
    "71": "The power and duration of antipyretic actions of acupuncture under single or repeated stimulation of Shaoshang (Lu-11) and Shangyang (LI-1) acupoints were studied in rabbits. Under conditions of preliminary i. v. injection of propranolol (1-2 mg/kg), strengthening of acupuncture antipyretic activity was revealed. This effect suggests participation of norepinephrine system in mechanism of febrifugal action of acupuncture.", 
    "72": "Recently, the ability of beta-blockers to stimulate proliferative activity and induce lipid accumulation in cultured human aortic intimal cells has been demonstrated. Moreover, the addition of calcium antagonists completely blocked the increase in proliferative activity and abolished cholesterol accumulation caused by propranolol. In this study blood serum of rabbits treated with 20 mg of propranolol induced 2-fold cholesterol accumulation in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Papaverin did not influence this effect. In case of simultaneous administration of propranolol and papaverin rabbit serum did not exhibit the ability to accumulate intracellular lipids. Propranolol substantially stimulated the formation of myointimal thickening and neutral lipid accumulation in denuded rabbit aorta. Papaverin completely blocked the propranolol-produced atherogenic changes. The data suggest that in vitro and in vivo atherogenic effects of beta-blockers may be prevented by papaverin.", 
    "73": "Using electrocardiographic technique, the effect of a single hyperbaric oxygenation session (O2 pressure 1.5 atm, duration 40 min) in combination with antianginal drugs (nifedipine--20 mg, propranolol--40 mg, nitrong--6.5 mg, orally) on central hemodynamics and myocardial contractility has been studied in 35 patients with ischemic heart disease and angina pectoris of effort, NYHA functional class II-III. It has been shown that hyperbaric oxygenation reduced the degree of indirect hemodynamic effect of nifedipine, potentiated negative chronotropic and inotropic effects of propranolol and had no impact on the degree of hemodynamic effect of depot-glycerol trinitrate.", 
    "74": "The authors carried out a complex clinico-instrumental investigation of the effect of a new cardioselective beta-blocking agent leprozor in 116 patients with hypertensive disease (stage II). A quantitative evaluation of the hemodynamics of the left compartments of the heart with two-dimensional echocardiography was carried out. Evaluation of the efficacy of using leprozor in this category of patients was based on an analysis of the state of their hemodynamics against the background of systematic intake of the drug for 7 months. Selection of the dosage was individual under the control of circulation parameters. It is concluded that leprozor proved effective in normalization of the hemodynamics in patients with hypertensive disease.", 
    "75": "A simple, rapid and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of propafenone and 5-hydroxypropafenone in human serum is described. Method involves a single-step extraction of the drug and its metabolite with dichloromethane:2-propanol (4:1 v/v) mixture from 0.2 ml of serum. Separation of the investigated compounds on deactivated Supelcosil LC18-DB column is accomplished by ultraviolet detection at 210 nm. The limit of detection is 10 ng/ml for propafenone and 4 ng/ml for 5-hydroxypropafenone. The method is useful for the routine monitoring of propafenone and its main metabolite in serum as well as for the pharmacokinetic studies.", 
    "76": "The study was undertaken to examine the efficacy of beta-adrenoblockers used in 26 patients with chronic heart failure which had been caused by coronary heart disease in 12 patients, by rheumatic heart disease in 8 patients, by dilated cardiomyopathy in 5 patients, and by chronic myocarditis in 1 patient. beta-Blockers such as oxprenolol, propranolol, and metoprolol were supplemented to the therapy of the patients with chronic heart failure who were resistant to cardiac glycosides, diuretics, and vasodilators. This resulted in functional class improvement by the New York Heart Association from 3.67 +/- 0.1 to 2.29 +/- 0.1. The authors defined the following predictors of the efficacy of beta-blockers in chronic heart failure: duration of the disease, diastolic pressure, cardiac rhythm, and left ventricular ejection fraction and discussed the mechanisms responsible for their positive effect in chronic heart failure.", 
    "77": "The levels of pituitary and gonadal hormones were measured by radioimmunoassay during a long-term (12-month) therapy with prazosin and its combination in 23 patients aged 30-59 years who suffered from Stage II hypertensive disease. Prazosin monotherapy resulted in a significant decrease in prolactin levels, followed by inhibited elaboration of luteinizing, follicle-stimulating, and testicular hormones in the first 6 months of therapy without changing estradiol levels. The hypoprolactinemic effect of prazosin was significantly enhanced with an increase in therapy duration and more profound in patients who had high baseline prolactin levels and in younger patients. Prazosin in combination with nadolol was found to level off the hyperprolactinemic effect of the latter without potentiating the reduction in the levels of follicle-stimulating, luteinizing, and testicular hormones which was observed during therapy with each drug alone.", 
    "78": "1. Anaesthetized, open-chest dogs were subjected to 60 min of left circumflex coronary artery occlusion followed by 90 min of reperfusion. Endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxant responses of the isolated coronary arterial rings were then investigated. 2. The endothelium-dependent, acetylcholine-induced relaxation of ischaemic/reperfused arterial rings was significantly attenuated in comparison to control rings (1.9 fold rightward shift, ischaemic/reperfused maximum relaxation = 57 +/- 13% of control maximum relaxation; P less than 0.05). In contrast, glyceryl trinitrate produced similar relaxant responses in control and ischaemic rings. 3. Pretreatment of dogs with either amlodipine (3 micrograms kg-1 min-1, i.v.) or propranolol (1 mg kg-1, i.v.) completely prevented the postischaemic impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxant responses (100 +/- 3% and 90 +/- 5% of control maximum relaxation, respectively). 4. Allopurinol pretreatment (25 mg kg-1, p.o. 24 h previously, plus 50 mg kg-1 i.v. 5 min before arterial occlusion) partially protected against endothelial dysfunction by preventing the ischaemia-induced rightward shift of the acetylcholine relaxation curve and increasing the maximum relaxation response (83 +/- 7% of control rings). 5. These results confirm that endothelium-dependent coronary vascular relaxation is impaired by ischaemia and reperfusion, and that the ischaemia-induced impairment is reduced by pretreatment with amlodipine, propranolol or allopurinol.", 
    "79": "Transient growth signals which can be related to protein synthesis and cellular growth are of particular interest in the heart because of the incidence of cardiac hypertrophy in man. The isolated coronary perfused adult rat heart or the so-called Langendorff preparation, is an useful model in exploring not only protein synthesis but also c-fos/c-myc protooncogene and Heat Shock Protein (HSP) gene expression. Phenylephrine infusion in this preparation induces c-fos expression whether the heart is beating or reversibly or irreversibly arrested by solutions enriched in KCl. Norepinephrine has the same effect. Quantitative analysis with slot blots shows that in both cases the adrenergic effect has a dual origin since it is inhibited both by propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, and terazosine, a soluble alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist. We conclude that the isolated heart is a useful tool to explore the early changes in gene expression which occur in this tissue in response to various physiological stimuli.", 
    "80": "1. The cardiovascular effects of (-)-cis-diltiazem, an optical isomer of diltiazem, were studied in the isolated atrium and aortic strip. (-)-cis-Diltiazem (30 microM or more) increased the developed tension of the rat left atrium, while (+)-cis-diltiazem (1 microM or more) decreased it. 2. (-)-cis-Diltiazem (1 to 100 microM) decreased the rate of spontaneous beating in the right atrium as did (+)-cis-diltiazem. 3. The potency of the positive inotropic action of (-)-cis-diltiazem was almost the same as that of ouabain in the rat left atrium, but in the guinea-pig left atrium it was considerably weaker than that of ouabain. 4. In both endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded aortic strips, (-)-cis-diltiazem relaxed the Ca(2+)-induced contraction. In the endothelium-intact rat aortic strip depolarized by 15 mM KCl, Bay K 8644, a calcium channel agonist, increased the contractile force, whereas (-)-cis-diltiazem did not. 5. These results indicate that (-)-cis-diltiazem has a positive inotropic action in isolated atria in rats and guinea-pigs, but the mode of positive inotropic action of (-)-cis-diltiazem is different from that of ouabain or Bay K 8644.", 
    "81": "Hemodynamic responses to intravenous (i.v.) injection of DPMA [N6-[2-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(2-methylphenyl)ethyl] adenosine); PD 125,944], a potent adenosine agonist with a 32-fold selectivity for the adenosine-2 (A2) receptor subtype, were characterized in conscious and anesthetized rats. In conscious rats instrumented with miniaturized pulsed-Doppler flow probes, i.v. injection of increasing doses of DPMA (3-30 micrograms/kg) had little effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP, maximal decrease -8 +/- 4 mm Hg) or renal and mesenteric resistance (maximal change 8 +/- 14 and 0 +/- 15%, respectively). In contrast, DPMA markedly reduced MAP (maximal decrease -61 +/- 8 mm Hg) in a dose-dependent (1-30 micrograms/kg) fashion in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. The A2 agonist also caused a sustained, dose-dependent increase in heart rate (HR, maximal increase 75 +/- 12 beats/min) in conscious rats. The tachycardia and decrease in arterial pressure were completely reversed by i.v. administration of CGS 15943 (250 micrograms/kg), a selective adenosine receptor antagonist. Pretreatment with propranolol or hexamethonium significantly reduced but did not abolish the tachycardia, suggesting that the increase in HR was mediated only partially through reflex increases in sympathetic tone. These data indicate that (a) anesthesia potentiates the depressor actions of DPMA and (b) stimulation of A2 receptors increases HR through both direct and indirect mechanisms of action.", 
    "82": "In 7 patients with untreated mild essential hypertension, a single 200-mg dilevalol dose was administered orally. Blood pressure (BP, left brachial artery catheter), heart rate (HR), and left and right forearm blood flows were measured and left and right forearm vascular resistances were calculated before and for approximately 3 h after drug administration. Dilevalol administration was followed by a sustained reduction in BP, little change in HR, and a similar pronounced and sustained increase in left and right forearm blood flows and reduction in left and right forearm vascular resistances. At the end of the observation period, the changes in left forearm circulation were unaffected by left brachial artery infusion of saline but markedly reduced by left brachial artery infusion of propranolol at doses that had no effect on BP, HR, and contralateral forearm vasodilatation. Thus, at an oral dose exerting an antihypertensive effect, dilevalol induces a marked and persistent vasodilation due largely to the beta-adrenoceptor agonism of the drug.", 
    "83": "Conventional formulations of metoprolol have become well established in cardiovascular medicine and are particularly useful in the management of hypertension and ischaemic heart disease. Recently developed controlled release metoprolol delivery systems (metoprolol CR/ZOK and metoprolol OROS) were designed to overcome the drug delivery problems of matrix-based sustained release forms by releasing the drug at a relatively constant rate over a 24-hour period, and thus producing sustained and consistent metoprolol plasma concentrations and beta 1-blockade while retaining the convenience of once daily administration. Clinically and statistically significant reductions in blood pressure have been observed with metoprolol CR/ZOK and metoprolol OROS 24 hours after administration in mildly or moderately hypertensive patients. Studies in patients with mild to moderate hypertension have demonstrated that a similar or higher percentage of patients achieved a goal response with metoprolol CR/ZOK compared with matrix-based sustained release formulations of metoprolol, or conventional atenolol or bisoprolol, while metoprolol OROS achieved an equal or greater response rate compared with conventional or matrix-based sustained release metoprolol preparations. In patients with stable effort angina pectoris, once daily administration of metoprolol CR/ZOK provided at least equal antianginal efficacy as conventional metoprolol in divided doses, while metoprolol OROS reduced the mean number of anginal attacks by the same margin as atenolol. Controlled release metoprolol formulations have been well tolerated in clinical trials. Metoprolol CR/ZOK was associated with a similar or lesser degree of adverse effects related to the central nervous system compared with atenolol or long acting propranolol. Metoprolol CR/ZOK also demonstrated less pronounced beta 2-mediated bronchoconstrictor effects than atenolol in asthmatics, and less general fatigue and leg fatigue in healthy subjects. Metoprolol OROS produced less pronounced bronchoconstrictor effects than atenolol, matrix-based sustained release metoprolol or long acting propranolol in patients with asthma or obstructive airways disease, and healthy volunteers. These results are presumably due to the beta 1-selectivity of metoprolol in addition to the relatively low plasma concentrations maintained by metoprolol CR/ZOK and metoprolol OROS, and the avoidance of high peak plasma concentrations with these agents. Despite the relative safety of the controlled release forms of metoprolol, the use of all beta-adrenoceptor antagonists should be avoided in patients with a history of bronchospasm. Thus, controlled release metoprolol formulations offer the potential to maximise the confirmed benefits of this agent in the management of hypertension and angina, by maintaining clinically effective plasma concentrations within a narrow therapeutic range over a 24-hour dose interval.", 
    "84": "Enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor usually administered orally once daily, decreases blood pressure by lowering peripheral vascular resistance without increasing heart rate or output. It is effective in lowering blood pressure in all grades of essential and renovascular hypertension. Patients not responding adequately to enalapril monotherapy usually respond with the addition of a thiazide diuretic (or a calcium antagonist or beta-blocker), and rarely require a third antihypertensive agent. Enalapril is at least as effective as other established and newer ACE inhibitors, and members of other antihypertensive drug classes including diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and alpha-blockers, but therapy with enalapril may be less frequently limited by serious adverse effects or treatment contraindications than with other drug classes. The most frequent adverse effect limiting all ACE inhibitor therapy in clinical practice is cough. This favourable profile of efficacy and tolerability, and the substantial weight of clinical experience, explain the increasing acceptance of enalapril as a major antihypertensive treatment and supports its use as logical first-line therapeutic option.", 
    "85": "A 20 h continuous treatment of rats with catecholamines, using subcutaneously implantable retard tablets, had either no (adrenaline, isoproterenol, midodrine) or a slight (noradrenaline) suppressive effect on the in vitro responsiveness of peripheral blood T-lymphocytes. A marked suppression of the mitogen response ensued when adrenaline, noradrenaline or midodrine, but not isoproterenol, was applied together with the beta-receptor blocker propranolol, whereas the combination with the alpha-receptor blocker phentolamine had no effect. The mitogen response of splenic lymphocytes was not affected by any of these treatments. This alpha-mediated adrenergic suppression of peripheral blood T-cells was not correlated with general metabolic alterations, shifts in white blood cell counts or CD4+/CD8+ subsets, or with elevated glucocorticoid levels. The data suggest that to consistently influence the reactivity of rat peripheral blood lymphocytes by chronic adrenergic stimuli in vivo requires both high catecholamine levels and a bias towards alpha-adrenergic receptivity.", 
    "86": "The effect of 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, on the locomotor activity was analyzed in Albino Swiss mice. The studied drug (0.5-5 mg/kg) inhibited the spontaneous locomotor activity in mice. The hypoactivity induced by 8-OH-DPAT (1.5 mg/kg) was abolished by the dopamine (D1 and D2) receptor antagonist-haloperidol (0.00125 and 0.0025 mg/kg, but not in higher doses) and by the D2 antagonist with affinity for 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors-spiperone (0.0025 and 0.005 mg/kg, but not in higher doses). The effect of 8-OH-DPAT was slightly reduced by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists: idazoxan (4 mg/kg), yohimbine (2 and 4 mg/kg) and rauwolscine (4 mg/kg). On the other hand, the non-selective 5-HT antagonist metergoline (0.5-4 mg/kg), the 5-HT1A antagonist NAN-190 (0.5-2 mg/kg), the beta-adrenoceptor blockers with high affinity for 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors: pindolol and SDZ 21009 (2-8 mg/kg) and the agonist/antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors ipsapirone (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) did not affect the 8-OH-DPAT-induced hypoactivity. The obtained results suggest that the reduction of the spontaneous locomotor activity induced by 8-OH-DPAT results from a stimulation of dopamine autoreceptors, but not 5-HT receptors. Involvement of an alpha 2-adrenergic mechanism cannot be excluded.", 
    "87": "The effect of adrenergic blocking agents and adrenomimetics on sensitivity to insulin was studied in rat experiments. The sensitivity was judged from the duration of hypoglycemic coma development after intravenous infusion of 40 U/kg insulin. Sensitivity to insulin increased with the beta-adrenergic blocking agent obsidan and the alpha-adrenomimetic mesaton (phenylephrine hydrochloride) but diminished after infusion of the beta-adrenomimetic partusisten and the alpha-adrenergic blocking agent butyroxane. The obtained data are discussed from the standpoint of insulin-resistance control.", 
    "88": "The activity of the newly synthetized substance BL 343 Ac (propyl-3-acetyl-4[/2-hydroxy-3-isopropyl amino/propoxy] carbanylate of hydrochloride), a beta 1-adrenolytic with sympathomimetic activity was investigated by means of the electrophysiological method of sucrose gap. Its effect on the membrane potential of a population of neurons of the superior cervical ganglion (GCS) of the cat was analyzed with the aim to contribute to the knowledge on the selectivity of action of this substance. In the GCS of the cat, which contains predominantly beta 2-adrenoceptors, BL 343 Ac given in concentrations from 0.01 to 50 mumol.l-1 and after single application into the superfusion stream close to the ganglion in doses from 0.01 to 1,000 nmol did not induce an unequivocal change in the membrane potential or a response comparable to that elicited by isoprenaline. No blocking effect of the substance BL 343 Ac (0.01-50 mumol.l-1) was observed on isoprenaline induced depolarization of the cat GCS. The obtained results indicate that BL 343 Ac fails to exert either beta 2-adrenomimetic or beta 2-adrenolytic effect on the GCS of the cat. (Fig. 2, Ref. 11.)", 
    "89": "The mechanical, histological and pharmacological properties of the isolated cat ophthalmociliary artery are reported and compared for passively stretched ring segments from three locations on the artery. Ring segments were mounted in a modified myograph system after the method of Hogestatt, Andersson and Edvinsson (1983, Acta Physiol Scand. 117, 49-61) and comparative length tension curves were measured. The most distal segment (DOA), nearest the eye, developed by far the smallest maximal tension compared to the middle segment (MOA) and the most proximal segment (POA), despite the fact that lumen diameters were similar. All segments displayed a phasic and tonic component in response to passive stretching and during activation with K(+)-Krebs. Cumulative contractile dose-response curves were measured for nine agonists: histamine (HIS), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DOPA), adrenaline (A), noradrenaline (NA), tyramine (TYR), phenylephrine (PHE), isoproterenol (ISOP) and xylazine (XYL) and the maximum active tension developed at a concentration of 10(-3) M was compared with that for 0.124 M K(+)-Krebs. The order of contraction magnitude in the three segments was: POA, HIS much greater than Kmax much greater than NA greater than A greater than DOPA greater than PH = TYR greater than 5-HT = ISOP greater than XYL; MOA, Kmax much greater than NA much greater than A = HIS much greater than DOPA greater than ISOP = PHE greater than TYR = 5-HT greater than XYL; DOA, Kmax much greater than NA greater than A greater than HIS = DOPA greater than ISOP greater than PHE = 5-HT greater than XYL = TYR. Pre-activation did not produce relaxation in response to histamine and isoproterenol. Testing with specific alpha 1 and beta antagonists supported the presence of alpha 1 receptors but not beta receptors. It is concluded that functional HIS, alpha 1 and 5-HT receptors are present and that the ophthalmociliary artery is heterogeneous in its response to HIS, with the POA segment producing the largest responses. The magnitude of the contractile responses to A and NA grew with increasing passive tension, whereas the response to histamine was independent of passive tension.", 
    "90": "Differing effects of (+/-)-celiprolol at beta-adrenoceptors have been reported. The effects of (+/-)-, (+)- and (-)-celiprolol on the contractile responses of the rat left atria and portal vein have therefore been studied. (+/-)-Celiprolol did not augment the responses of the atria to electrical stimulation and is therefore not an agonist at beta 1-adrenoceptors. Prolonged treatment with (+/-)-celiprolol attenuated the contractile activity of the vein and this effect was blocked by ICI 118,551 and is therefore mediated by agonism at beta 2-adrenoceptors. The pA2 values for (+/-)-, (+)- and (-)-celiprolol at the beta 1-adrenoceptors of the atria were 8.0, 6.0 and 8.6, respectively. On the protal vein, (+/-)- and (-)-celiprolol produced non-parallel rightward shifts of log isoprenaline attenuation curves with a reduction in isoprenaline maximum responses. This effect of (+/-)-celiprolol on the vein was not due to slowly reversible antagonism, as the inhibitory effect of (+/-)-celiprolol was readily reversible.", 
    "91": "The effect of different beta-adrenoceptor blockers on free radical-mediated cardiac membrane lipid peroxidation (CMLP) was compared to their beta-blocking potency (pA2). CMLP was determined by the measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA) formation in rat cardiac membrane homogenates exposed to a free radical generating system (FeCL3/ADP/DHF) in the presence or absence of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers (1-1,000 microM). beta-adrenoceptor blocking potency (pA2) was determined using guinea pig right atria stimulated with isoproterenol. The catechol containing beta-blocker (DCC-10255) was shown to be a potent inhibitor of CMLP via an iron-dependent mechanism. On the other hand, the non-catechol beta-adrenoceptor blocker, timolol, was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CMLP. Furthermore, dl- and d-propranolol were active and equipotent though less potent than DCC-10255 in inhibiting CMLP. The myocardial cytoprotective efficacy for catechol and non-catechol beta-adrenoceptor blockers was evaluated in an isolated rat myocyte model. It was demonstrated that catechol-containing agents with either strong or weak beta-adrenoceptor blockade possess a relatively potent in vitro antioxidant and myocardial cytoprotective efficacy against free radical mediated CMLP and myocyte injury, respectively. It is concluded that the inhibition of CMLP by beta-adrenoceptor blockers is independent of their beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "92": "1. Experiments were performed to investigate the possible interaction between tertatolol and the \"atypical\" beta-adrenoceptor present in guinea-pig ileum. 2. In the electrically field stimulated guinea-pig ileum, both isoprenaline and BRL-37344 produce concentration-dependent inhibition of the \"twitch\" response. 3. Schild regression analysis of the interaction between isoprenaline and tertatolol indicated two sites of action and yielded an apparent pA2 value for tertatolol of 6.8 at the \"atypical\" beta-adrenoceptor. 4. BRL-37344 selectively activated the \"atypical\" beta-adrenoceptor and tertatolol again yielded an apparent pA2 value of 6.7 and 6.8."
