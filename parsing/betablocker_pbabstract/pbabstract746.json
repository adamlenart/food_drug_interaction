To test whether the preoptic area controls only non-shivering and the spinal cord only shivering thermogenesis, ten rats were chronically implanted with a preoptic and a spinal cord thermode each. The following were then studied: (a) the effect of propranolol (8 mg/kg.hr) on the metabolic response to cooling the preoptic area, and the spinal cord, (b) the effect of exogenous noradrenaline (0.5 mg/kg) on the metabolic response to cooling the preoptic area, and the spinal cord, and (c) the effect of warming the preoptic area on the metabolic response to cooling the spinal cord, and vice versa. 2. Administration of propranolol inhibited the metabolic response to cooling each of the thermosensitive areas, but the response to cooling the preoptic area was more strongly inhibited than that to cooling the spinal cord. 3. Administration of exogenous noradrenaline did not prevent the metabolic response to cooling either the preoptic area or the spinal cord. 4. Warming the spinal cord completely inhibited the metabolic response to cooling the preoptic area, and warming the preoptic area fully inhibited the metabolic response to cooling the spinal cord. 5. It is concluded that exogenous noradrenaline underestimates the capacity for non-shivering thermogenesis, and that both thermosensitive areas can control both forms of thermogenesis, but that the preoptic area threshold of non-shivering thermogenesis is probably lower than that of shivering, while the spinal cord threshold of shivering is probably lower than that of non-shivering thermogenesis.", 
    "1": "A method is described for the determination of antiarrhythmia drugs in serum by high-performance thin-layer chromatography. Baseline separations are achieved for all the drugs and clozapine, an internal standard, in two developments with solvents of different polarity. Lidocaine and diphenylhydantoin are scanned at 220 nm after the first development. Procainamide, propranolol and quinidine are scanned at 290 nm after the second development. The relative standard deviation of the determination varies between 3 and 14% depending on the nature of the drug and its concentration.", 
    "2": "In isolated organs of the white rats activation of noradrenaline-H3 and dophamine-H3 synthesis during action of the alpha-adrenoblocking agent phentolamine (1.10(-6) M) and inhibition of the amines synthesis under influence of the alpha-adrenoreceptor activator mezaton (1.10(-5) M) were due to a release from cells-effectors of respective humoral factors and to the latters' effect upon the processes of amine formation in the adrenergic neuron. Formation of the humoral factors altering the rate of catecholamines-H3 synthesis is associated with activation of the protein synthesis in cells-effectors and occurs during change of the functional state (excitation or blockade) of the post-synaptic adrenoreceptors. The processes occurring at the time in the adrenergic neuron, are not correlated with protein formation. The possibility of existence of a common mechanism for feed-back transsynaptic regulation of synthesis and neuronal uptake of noradrenaline via adrenoreceptors of cells-effectors by means of changing the intensity of thyrosin and noradrenaline transport into the neuron is discussed.", 
    "3": "Hormonal changes, occurring during electrocoagulation of the Gasserian ganglion under neuroleptanalgesia, and the effects of intravenous administration of pindolol 0.4 mg on these changes were investigated in two groups of 10 and 12 patients of advanced age. At the end of the operation there were marked increases of the concentrations of catecholamines, a rise of the plasma cortisol and a fall of the serum insulin. The administration of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent did not induce any statistically significant changes of the determined hormones compared to the control group.", 
    "4": "When examined 6-7 days after the unilateral removal of the pelvic ganglion, the detrusor muscle of the rat was found to be sensitized to methacholine and noradrenaline. The threshold doses were lower while the intravesical pressure responses to doses above threshold were increased. In contrast, bladders examined 25-30 days after the partial denervation lacked signs of sensitization. It is suggested that the contralateral nervous pathway is responsible for the rapid disappearance of the supersensitivity.", 
    "5": "Influence of labetalol and 5-(1-hydroxy-2-aminoethyl)salicylamide (SA), a part of the chemical structure of labetalol, on the fluorimetric assay of catecholamine (CA) was studied. Both labetalol and SA have a weak but significant fluorescence which is indistinguishable from that of CA with peaks of excitation/emission wavelengths at 410/490. It is thus concluded that an apparent increase in urinary CA observed in patients receiving labetalol is caused by the contamination of labetalol and/or its metabolite, and that the evaluation of urinary CA in hypertensive patients must be done prior to the use of labetalol to avoid any confusion in diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.", 
    "6": "Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is frequently complicated by hypertension, which has been ascribed to sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity. We report the case of a child with GBS and hypertension that appeared to be related to increased renin-angiotensin activity. Urinary catecholamine excretion was normal. Propranolol therapy successfully controlled the hypertension. Evaluation of the renin-angiotensin system and catecholamine excretion is indicated in patients with GBS and hypertension.", 
    "7": "The effect of beta-adrenergic block on the circulatory reactions of a human being induced by high altitude hypoxia was studied by multi-channel rheography and indirect determination of systolic pulmonary arterial pressure. In healthy people not subjected to a pharmacological effect, 25-day stay at an altitude of 3,200 m was marked by an increase in cerebral blood flow at the beginning of adaptation and the development of pulmonary hypertension the maximum signs of which were recorded during the first days in the mountains. Daily intake of 80 mg of obsidan begun 3 days before the ascent levelled out the adaptative increase in cerebral perfusion and intensified the marked character and stability of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. It is concluded that great care should be exercised in giving obsidan at high altitude to individuals with even latent forms of right ventricular pathology since under conditions of hypobaric hypoxia beta-adrenergic block increases the load suffered by the right ventricular myocardium.", 
    "8": "Hydroxy fatty acids and bile acids produce both intestinal fluid and electrolyte accumulation and increases in inulin clearance, a parameter of mucosal permeability. The relationship of the changes in mucosal permeability to the production of fluid and electrolyte accumulation is uncertain. These experiments were designed to determine whether the alterations of mucosal permeability produced by ricinoleic acid and deoxycholic acid were related to production of hydroxy fatty acid- and bile acid-induced fluid and electrolyte accumulation in the rat colon. Propranolol (1 mg per 100 g of body weight) administered daily for 3 days inhibited ricinoleic acid- and deoxycholic acid-induced Na and water accumulation. In contrast, propranolol did not affect either the increase in inulin clearance or the decrease in electrical potential difference produced by ricinoleic acid and deoxycholic acid. Further, amphotericin B increased inulin clearance by the colon and also increased water and Na absorption. These studies suggest that changes in mucosal permeability are not primarily responsible for hydroxy fatty acid- and bile acid-induced fluid and Na accumulation.", 
    "9": "In rat ventricular tissue, labetalol inhibited the accumulation of (-)-[3H]noradrenaline and released [3H] following preloading with (-)[3H]noradrenaline. Cocaine (30 micrometer) inhibited the release observed with tyramine (5 micrometer) and beta-phenethylamine (5 micrometer) but not that observed with labetalol (5 micrometer). Reserpine pretreatment of the animals abolished the release observed with labetalol (5 and 50 micrometer). Labetalol primarily increased the loss of deaminated metabolites of noradrenaline. It is suggested that labetalol may release (-)-noradrenaline from the vesicles.", 
    "10": "1 The effects of 5 mg/kg acebutolol given intravenously were investigated in anaesthetized dogs after (a) ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and (b) coronary reperfusion following 60 min of ligation of the anterior descending coronary artery. 2 Coronary artery ligation produced, after 4 to 6 h, persistent multiple ventricular ectopic beats and abnormalities of R and T waves and of the S-T segment. Administration of acebutolol, after the development of persistent ventricular arrhythmias, restored normal sinus rhythm within 5 min of injection. Electrocardiographic abnormalities were also reduced. 3 Coronary artery reperfusion (following 60 min of ligation) resulted in multiple ventricular ectopic beats, ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation. Pretreatment with acebutolol, 15 min before starting reperfusion, markedly reduced the arrhythmias. 4 Acebutolol did not affect peak inspiratory airway pressure. 5 Acebutolol produced significant bradycardia and slight, transient, hypotension. It was without effect on left ventricular systolic pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, cardiac output or pulmonary arterial pressure. 6 These results suggest beneficial effects of acebutolol in myocardial ischaemia and coronary reperfusion, without any significant risk of cardiodepression or bronchospasm.", 
    "11": "1 The putative 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor blocking drugs methysergide (10 mg/kg) and methergoline (5 mg/kg) were found to abolish some components of the hyperactivity syndrome, including head weaving and forepaw treading, which follow administration to rats of tranylcypromine (20 mg/kg) and L-tryptophan (100 mg/kg). Hyperactivity and hyper-reactivity were potentiated with a resultant increase in automated locomotor activity counts. In contrast (-)-propranolol (20 mg/kg) inhibited all features of the syndrome. The same results were obtained with these drugs when the behaviour was elicited by p-chloroamphetamine (10 mg/kg) or by tranylcypromine and tryptamine (10 mg/kg). 2 Methysergide and methergoline had similar effects on the syndrome produced by tranylcypromine and L-DOPA (50 mg/kg) whereas propranolol was without effect. 3 None of the putative 5-HT receptor antagonists affected brain 5-HT turnover as assessed by rate of accumulation of 5-HT following monoamine oxidase inhibition with tranylcypromine. 4 Microinjections of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine into the spinal cord resulted in a 70% fall in cord 5-HT concentrations without an effect on brain 5-HT concentrations. The behavioural response to the putative 5-HT receptor agonist, 5-methoxy N,N-dimethyltryptamine (2 mg/kg), was potentiated in these animals suggesting that 5-HT receptors become supersensitive on denervation, and that some components of the behavioural syndrome are mediated by spinal cord 5-HT receptors. 5 Pretreatment with alpha-methyl p-tyrosine (2 X 200 mg/kg) delayed the onset of all components of the behaviour elicited by tranylcypromine/L-tryptophan by 60 min, indicating an involvement of catecholamines in the syndrome. 6 p-Chloroamphetamine-induced 5-HT depletion had no effect on any component of the tranylcypromine-L-DOPA behaviour.", 
    "12": "The present experiments were designed to measure the direct effects of propranolol on carotid sinus pressoreceptor nerve activity in the semi-isolated, superfused sinus of the cat. Propranolol (5 microgram/ml) significantly enhanced carotid sinus nerve activity at perfusion pressures of 100, 150 and 250 mm Hg. The enhancement was due primarily to the recruitment of new fibers. In similar preparations, perfused at constant flow, propranolol increased sinus resistance in parallel with the increase in sinus discharge. These effects were rapidly dissipated by rinsing with drug-free perfusion solution. The evidence suggests that propranolol may produce a change in either the elastic or autoregulatory modalities of sinus smooth muscle. This may produce a functional \"resetting\" of the sinus and provide a mechanism to explain the antihypertensive effect of propranolol.", 
    "13": "The hemisuccinate ester of propranolol was administered to beagle dogs to test its applicability as a potential prodrug of propranolol. Following oral administration of propranolol hemisuccinate, plasma propranolol levels were eight times higher than after an equivalent dose of propranolol hydrochloride. The hemisuccinate was absorbed rapidly, with peak plasma levels observed at 0.5--1 hr. Following intravenous dosing, the disappearance half-life of the prodrug from the plasma was 0.5 hr while the propranolol half-life was 1.7 hr. This study demonstrated the potential usefulness of the prodrug approach when a highly metabolized drug such as propranolol is protected from first-pass elimination.", 
    "14": "1. A high performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of propranolol in human plasma and blood has been developed and used to confirm that cumulation occurred during chronic oral administration, steady-state being achieved within 48 h of beginning 80 mg of the drug every 8 h. 2. The method was adapted to measure [H3]-propranolol and native drug in the same blood sample and was applied to determine simultaneously the disposition of i.v. ([H3]-propranolol) and orally (non-labelled) administered drug after single oral dose of 80 mg and when steady-state had been established on an 80 mg, 8-hourly regimen. 3. Using this approach it was possible to show that a reduced oral clearance at steady-state was associated with a smaller reduction in systemic (i.v.) clearance and no change in liver blood flow. A direct estimate of bioavailability was also possible and was found to be increased at steady-state compared with a single oral dose. 4. We conclude that the accumulation of propranolol during the attainment of steady-state is due to a reduction in intrinsic clearance, resulting in reduced presystemic hepatic extraction.", 
    "15": "The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of N-dimethyl propranolol (DMP), the quaternary derivative of propranolol, and propranolol on the transmural distribution (endo/epi) of coronary blood flow in normal and ischemic regions of the myocardium. The distribution of blood flow between subendocardium and subepicardium of a nonischemic region and one distal to a severe left circumflex coronary artery stenosis was determined by use of tracer microspheres (15 microgram) in intact dog hearts. DMP (1,5 and 10 mg/kg I.V.) produced a small dose-related increase in endo/epi of the nonischemic region (1.15 +/- 0.04--1.24 +/- 0.05), whereas a larger increase was observed in the ischemic region (0.61 +/- 0.08--1.09 +/- 0.10). DMP also produced a significant increase in ischemic subendocardial blood flow (0.59 +/- 0.12--0.76 +/- 0.11 ml/min/g). Similarly, propranolol (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg I.V.) produced a small increase in endo/epi of the nonischemic region (1.18 +/- 0.08--1.30 +/- 0.07) and a larger increase in the ischemic region (0.72 +/- 0.17--1.18 +/- 0.09). However, propranolol did not increase ischemic subendocardial blood flow. It is concluded that DMP may be an alternative to propranolol in certain types of acute myocardial ischemia when beta-adrenergic blockade is undesirable.", 
    "16": "Erythrocytes from a heterogeneous group of hemolytic anemias have been found to release acetylcholinesterase-enriched fragments and show myelin forms during ATP depletion in vitro. The highest amount of fragmentation was found in hereditary spherocytosis and xerocytosis, two inherited membrane defects. Our data suggest ATP depletion plays a role in producing fragmentation or myelin forms. The addition of external CaCl2 1 mM had no effect on the degree of fragmentation. However, propranolol hydrochloride, a cationic anesthetic that does not prevent ATP depletion, inhibited fragmentation and the appearance of myelin forms in both hereditary spherocytes and xerocytes. A more detailed study of the xerocyte fragments showed that they had the same protein composition as those from normal red cells, primarily integral membrane proteins and glycoproteins. The red cells from patients with PNH and G6PD deficiency had the shortest survival in vivo (51Cr) and produced the smallest amount of fragmentation and myelin forms in vitro, whereas xerocytosis with only mild to moderate hemolysis in vivo was associated with the highest amount of myelin forms and membrane fragments in vitro.", 
    "17": "Autorhythmometry of blood pressure is a technique easy to be performed and well accepted by hypertensive patients. A simple inspection of data self-collected 5 times a day for many days constitute a sufficiently reliable automonitoring of blood pressure both in basal conditions and in relation to the efficacy of some dietary and/or pharmacological treatment. Several examples are reported to show that more sophisticated statistical manipulation of the data collected may give rise to a better understanding of some clinical and physiological aspects. Both analysis of variance, performed on individual subsets of data averaged at each sampling hour, and single cosinor, performed on longitudinal time series, may be used to detect and quantify a circadian rhythm as a systematic daily variation, averaging towards zero the noise superimposed to the actual time series. Serial section analysis of the data, along all the experimental span, is useful to detect a) the reproducibility of the rhythm b) the variation of its parameters induced by changes in the experimental conditions c) the long-term trend. In the first subject the influence on the circadian rhythm of the pulse rate, temperature and blood pressure, due to a 4 h advancing shift in the rest-activity synchronizer, is well documented. In the first hypertensive patient a circadian rhythm is demonstrated also in blood pressure during two non-consecutive months. No difference is detected in both mesor and amplitude of blood pressure and a full resynchronization of the acrophase is achieved when a 1 h delaying shift in the rest activity synchronizer is imposed. In the second patient a well reproducible rhythm of systolic blood pressure and a low noise/signal ratio is documented by the serial section display. In the third patient the 'lability' of hypertention seems mainly due to salt sensitivity, as documented by the significant lowering of the mesor in the second experimental span, when a lowering of only 30 mEq/day in salt intake is imposed. The serial section better documents the salt-sensitivity of this patient, during a span when loading and depressing of salt intake is imposed. In the last patient the prompt effect of therapy in lowering blood pressure within normal range is well documented by serial section with 3 day interval. A possible effect of masking the circadian rhythm of blood pressure, due to therapy, is inferred by the serial section display with an interval of the same length (33 days) as the subspan without therapy. The possibility of prevention in the hypertensive disease is discussed, with the aim of autorhythmometry and statistical methods employed in this paper.", 
    "18": "A random single-blind study of oxprenolol against perhexiline has been undertaken in angina pectoris. Both drugs were effective in treatment (P less than 0.01) but perhexiline was better than oxprenolol (P less than 0.05), 12 of the 14 patients preferring perhexiline. Offset against this was the greater incidence of side effects with perhexiline, including one patient who later developed peripheral neuropathy. Despite the greater efficacy of perhexiline, it is suggested that side effects should preclude its routine prescription as a drug of first choice in angina pectoris. It should remain of value in the special situations of resistant angina and angina with heart failure or bronchospasm, when its use should be carefully monitored for these side effects.", 
    "19": "Eleven healthy volunteers (mean age 30.1 +/- 4.3 yrs.) were repeatedly studied by measurement of systolic time intervals (QS2c, PEPc, LVETc, PEP/LVET) and arterial blood pressure (cuff method) before and after 24-hour oral application of four antiarrhythmic drugs (quinidine, disopyramide, prajmaliumbitartrate, propafenone) and two beta-blocking agents (propranolol, atenolol). The studies were repeated in the same group of volunteers with a different drug after an interval of one week. PEPc significantly increased after all antiarrhythmic agents at therapeutic doses by 6.1 to 9.4 ms (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01 resp.), whereas LVETc did not change significantly. PEP/LVET increased on an average by 0.033 +/- 0.006 (p less than 0.01). QS2c increased by 7.5 and 7.6 ms resp. (p less than 0.05) after prajmaliumbitartrate and propafenone. Heart rate remained unchanged after disopyramide and propafenone whereas it increased significantly (p less than 0.05) after quinidine and prajmaliumbitartrate. Blood pressure did not change significantly after any of these antiarrhythmic drugs. After application of the two beta-blocking agents propranolol and atenolol, no significant changes in STI could be observed. Mean arterial blood pressure significantly dropped after both, propranolol (minus 2.8 mm Hg) and atenolol (minus 9.7 mm Hg; p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, resp.). Heart rate decreased by minus 8.1 b.p.m. after propranolol (p less than 0.01) and minus 11.5 b.p.m. after atenolol (p less than 0.01). The results clearly indicate that at the dosage used, the four antiarrhythmic agents (quinidine, disopyramide, prajmaliumbitartrate, propafenone) exert a negative inotropic effect on left ventricular function as far as it can be judged from the measurement of STI. The lack of a significant negative inotropic effect of an oral treatment with beta-blocking agents on the STI can be explained by opposing effects of a decrease in blood pressure and a negative inotropic action.", 
    "20": "Fifteen men with chronic airways obstruction received a test dose of propranol 20 mg orally. Six developed increased breathlessness. Nine who tolerated the test dose received metoprolol (100 mg) and propranolol (80 mg) on different days in a randomized double-blind fashion. Changes in resting and exercise heart rate, spirometry and exercise tolerance were measured 1 and 6 hours later. The drugs had similar effects on heart rate. Propranolol, but not metoprolol, caused significant reduction in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate. Neither drug produced significant changes in forced vital capacity (FVC) or exercise performances in the group as a whole, although the range of changes was wide. Despite considerable reduction in FEV1 and FVC in some individuals, most reported no increase in symptoms. Changes in exercise tolerance at 1 hour correlated significantly with changes in FVC but not with those in FEV1. It is proposed that changes in FEV1, though of pharmacological interest, may be less relevant clinically than changes in FVC.", 
    "21": "Minoxidil was used to treat 26 patients (17 to 67 years old) with severe hypertension and varying degrees of renal function. Our object was to assess long-term clinical efficacy, kinetics (acute and chronic), and bioavailability of minoxidil in chronic renal insufficiency. Minoxidil, 27 to 30 mg per day, decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure during the first three months of therapy. Between the third and 24th months (30 months in one patient) there was no further change. Propranolol or clonidine was needed to control heart rate, and furosemide or dialysis was needed to control edema induced by minoxidil. Renal function improved in some of the mildy azotemic patients. Minoxidil kinetics after the customary dose did not differ whether the drug was taken as tablet or solution. Kinetic parameters during chronic administration of minoxidil did not differ from those after acute administration. The kinetics in chronic renal insufficiency do not differ from these in subjects with normal renal function.", 
    "22": "We conducted a double-masked, six-week crossover study comparing bilateral twice-a-day therapy with timolol maleate (0.1%, 0.25%, and 0.5%) and epinephrine hydrochloride (0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%) in 36 otherwise untreated patients. Increasing concentrations of each drug were administered until an arbitrary level of control was achieved before each of the six-week follow-up periods. Seventeen patients were controlled by both drugs and four patients were controlled by neither drug. Timolol, but not epinephrine, was effective in ten patients, whereas epinephrine, but not timolol, was effective in two patients. Three patients did not complete the study. The mean decrease in intraocular pressure from baseline was significantly greater with timolol than with epinephrine both before crossover and overall at both the lowest and highest concentrations of drug used. Significantly toxicity was produced in four patients during treatment with epinephrine, but in no patients during treatment with timolol.", 
    "23": "1. Eleven hypertensive patients were studied in a double-blind comparison of acebutolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, and placebo. 2. Optimum dosage defined in an open assessment varied from 200--600 mg twice daily. 3. Blood pressure and pulse rate fell significantly while patients were lying, standing and after exercise. 4. Blood pressure remained as well controlled on each patient's optimum daily dose when taken once daily, and assessed 24 h post dose. 5. There was no correlation between blood pressure reduction and changes in heart rate. On once daily therapy while blood pressure remained unchanged at 24 h post dose there was a signficant reduction in beta-adrenoceptor blockade as measured by percentage reduction in exercise tachycardia. 6. There was no significant change in urinary catecholamine excretion or echocardiographically estimated cardiac output. 7. A correlation was found between the change in plasma renin activity (log transformed) and blood pressure reduction.", 
    "24": "Serotonin (5HT) (5 mg/kg-25 mg/kg; i.p.) induced a dose-related increase of plasma glucagon (IRG) (using 30K antibody) 3 to 60 min after administration to overnight fasted rats. Blood glucose (BS) also increased as early as 10 min post-injection whereas plasma insulin (IRI) increased in a non dose-related (30 min to onset) manner. Adreno-demedullation prevented the rise of BS and IRI, but not IRG. Pretreatment with reserpine (5 mg/kg; i.p.; 24 hr earlier) did not prevent the actions of 5HT. Pretreatment with the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine (3 mg/kg-6 mg/kg; i.p.) reduced but did not prevent the subsequent rise of IRG, whereas beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (5 mg/kg-10 mg/kg; i.p.) was without effect. Phentolamine and the lower dose of propranolol (5 mg/kg) reduced the 5HT-induced hyperglycemia; whereas the higher dose (10 mg/kg) prevented the hyperglycemia. Phentolamine potentiated and propranolol prevented (5 mg/kg) or reversed (10 mg/kg) the 5HT-induced IRI rise. Pretreatment with the 5HT-antagonist, methysergide, prevented all the effects of 5HT. Precursor loading with 5HTP (5 mg/kg-50 mg/kg; i.p.) also resulted in a dose-related increase of IRG and a slight increase of IRI. Blockade of the conversion of 5HTP to 5HT with Ro-4-4602 (an L-aromatic acid decarboxylase inhibitor) blocked the subsequent rise of IRG. These results suggest that the 5HT-induced changes in BS and IRI may be secondary to a release of epinephrine and/or norepinephrine, but that the effects of 5HT on the release of IRG cannot be explained solely by this mechanism.", 
    "25": "A review of adverse reactions following practolol therapy is presented. The appearance of antinuclear antibodies seems to herald the clinical manifestations. Antinuclear antibodies were found in 30% of patients treated with practolol for prolonged periods. It is suggested that patients who develop an immune reaction following practolol metabolize the drug differently than those who do not.", 
    "26": "Capacitation and the acrosome reaction of mammalian spermatozoa are essential for fertilization. In vitro results are presented that demonstrate that catecholamines stimulate activation (a whiplash flagellar movement characteristic of capacitated hamster spermatozoa) and the acrosome reaction. Protein-free ultrafiltrates of bovine adrenal cortex and medulla preparations stimulated motility, activation, and acrosome reactions of hamster spermatozoa in the presence of bovine serum albumin. The medulla preparation was more effective than the cortex preparation in the stimulation of activation and acrosome reactions. Epinephrine (0.5-50 muM) and norepinephrine (50.0 muM) in the presence of bovine serum albumin and a partially purified protein-free cortex preparation also stimulated activation and the acrosome reactions. Both activation and acrosome reactions in the presence of epinephrine were inhibited by the adrenergic antagonists phentolamine and propranolol, suggesting the involvement of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors in the stimulation of capacitation and the acrosome reaction. In addition, phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, was as potent as epinephrine in the stimulation of acrosome reactions, but activation was reduced. Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, was as potent as epinephrine in the stimulation of activation, but acrosome reactions were reduced. High percentages of both activation and acrosome reactions were observed only in the presence of epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine and isoproterenol together.", 
    "27": "The existence of aminergic receptors in mouse Ehrlich ascites tumor cells was studied. L-Isoproterenol in vitro stimulated the formation of cAMP in isolated Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. Stimulation by isoproterenol of cAMP formation was not significantly inhibited by practolol, a beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist-Salbutamol, a beta2-adrenoceptor agonist, markedly stimulated the formation of cAMP in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells at concentrations from 10(-8)-10(-3) M. After the addition of salbutamol, cAMP levels reached a maximum in 10 min and declined to about 2-fold of the basal level to 30 min. The stimulation by salbutamol of cAMP formation was markedly inhibited by butoxamine, a beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist, but not by practolol. Furthermore, the effect of a maximal dose of salbutamol was additive to that of prostaglandin E2. Histamine and 4-methylhistamine, a histamine H2 receptor agonist, had no significant effects. Therefore, it is suggested that a beta2-adrenergic receptor exists in the membranes of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells in terms of the adenylate cyclase-cAMP system.", 
    "28": "Human PMNs have well-described responses to beta-adrenergic catecholamines; these include elevation of cellular levels of cyclic AMP and inhibition of the release of lysosomal contents. Using the radioactive beta-adrenergic antagonist (-)-[3H]DHA in direct ligand-binding studies, we have identified and characterized beta-adrenergic receptors on particulate preparations of PMNs. These particulates bind DHA rapidly (t1/2 less than 1 min) and reversibly (t1/2 = 8 to 9 min). DHA binding is saturable and of high affinity (dissociation constant = 1 to 5 nM) and low capacity (870 +/- 128 receptors/cell, mean +/- S.D.) to a single class of binding sites. Competition for DHA binding sites by both beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists is stereoselective [(-)-isomers more potent that (+)-isomers]. The rank order of potency of adrenergic agents in such competition studies indicates that these receptors are of the beta2 type. Since PMNs can be obtained in high purity with relative ease, the combined use of pharmacologic and ligand-binding studies in PMNs provide a useful system for studying beta-adrenergic receptors and their function in human subjects.", 
    "29": "Five hypoglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic patients (three with proven benign insulinoma, one with proven metastasizing insulinoma, one with probable insulinoma not found at surgery) were treated with propranolol for a variable time ranging from two weeks to one year. Three patients showed favourable clinical results and a significant increase of the mean basal blood glucose level was found while two patients showed no improvement of the frequency of neuroglycopenic episodes and no significant increase of their mean blood glucose level. No patient showed a significant decrease in mean basal IRI concentration. A decrease of insulinaemic responses was observed during oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests, a prolonged fast, and tolbutamide and glucagon tests performed in some patients. The results suggest that propranolol may induce in certain patients an improvement of basal clinical status through not understood effects (probably hepatic), which leave the peripheral concentrations of insulin unchanged, whereas inhibition of insulin secretion may represent the main way by which the improvement of metabolic situation during physiological or pharmacological stimulation may have been achieved.", 
    "30": "Pretreatment of guinea pigs with 5 microgram/kg isoprenaline or 10 microgram/kg salbutamol s.c. thrice daily for 7 days reduced the responsiveness of lung slice and tracheal ring adenylate cyclase to isoprenaline, but not to prostaglandin E1. Pretreatment of guinea pigs with isoprenaline also reduced the sensitivity of tracheal smooth muscle strip adenylate cyclase to isoprenaline. Cross-tolerance developed to noradrenaline in lung slices obtained from guinea pigs pretreated with isoprenaline. Propranolol blocked the response of lung slice adenylate cyclase of control and isoprenaline-pretreated animals to approximately the same degree. The presence of phentolamine in the incubation medium did not affect the reduced sensitivity to isoprenaline. Possible mechanisms of development of tolerance to sympathomimetic bronchodilator drugs are discussed.", 
    "31": "[3H]-Dihydroalprenolol ([3H]-DHA) binds to cerebral membranes of the frog, chick, rat, mouse, rabbit and human with a dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) of about 1 nM and displays binding characteristics indicative of an interaction with beta-adrenoceptors. However, the maximum number of specific binding sites labelled by this beta-adrenoceptor ligand varies substantially between the species with the chick and mouse having the highest, and the frog the lowest density. The structure--activity relationships of adrenergic agents to inhibit specific [3H]-DHA binding suggests that whereas the membrane sites from all the species had similar affinities for non-selective beta-adrenergic agents, several drugs that have been reported to show selectivity for beta1-adrenoceptors demonstrated considerably higher affinities for mammalian rather than avian or amphibian membrane sites. By this pharmacological criteria it is likely that all the beta-adrenoceptor binding sites in frog and chick cerebral tissue have properties resembling beta2-receptors. However, in mammalian cerebral cortex, evidence is presented that beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors coexist in a ratio of 70%/30% respectively.", 
    "32": "Bronchodilating action of l-MTI was investigated by intravenous administration to anesthetized animals and the results were compared to those seen with isoproterenol. Bronchoconstriction was induced by histamine or serotonin. Under pentobarbital anesthesia, the bronchodilating activity of l-MTI was approx. 1/20 that of isoproterenol in cats and dogs, but less than 1/100 that of isoproterenol in monkeys and guinea pigs. The results indicate that the bronchodilating activity of l-MTI is variable and species dependent. It was demonstrated, however, that in guinea pigs, l-MTI did not produce any bronchodilating activity, when the animals were anesthetized with urethane. The absence of the bronchodilating response in animals under this anesthesia was also seen in vagotomized, adrenalectomized and reserpinized, norepinephrine-infused guinea pigs. On the contrary, l-MTI exhibited the bronchodilating action in reserpinized, pithed or hexamethonium-treated guinea pigs anesthetized with urethane. On th other hand, isoproterenol produced a bronchodilating action in all preparations mentioned above. It was also evident that l-MTI suppressed the bronchodilating action of isoproterenol in pentobarbital anesthetized guinea pigs. In addition, l-MTI increased the heart rate of guinea pigs with a low beating rate, but decreased it when the control rate was high. These results suggest that at least in guinea pigs, l-MTI acts as a partial agonist and that the effect of l-MTI on the bronchial system depends on the sympathetic tone and/or sympathetic bronchodilator reflex, as proposed by McCULLOCH ET AL. (9).", 
    "33": "The electrophysiological effects of the combined administration of digoxin and propranolol were studied in 40 patients, compared with the effects of digoxin alone and considered in relation to anomalies of the conduction pathways. The cycle of the sinus node was only lengthened by digoxin in patients who had an anomaly of sinus node function. In contrast the addition of propranolol always increased it (from 1 109 +/- 53 ms to 1 232 +/- 58 ms). Sinus node recovery time was only increased by combined administration (from 1 331 +/- 101 ms to 1 450 +/- 68 ms). Changes in sino-atrial conduction intervals were not very marked. The AH interval was increased by digoxin (from 97 +/- 4 ms to 109 +/- 6 ms), with propranolol exerting a synergistic effect (119 +/- 6 ms). When there was pre-existing supra-His block only combined administration increased the conduction defect. The HV interval and QRS duration were not altered. The effective atrial refractory period was increased by combined administration (from 264 +/- 10 ms to 304 +/- 14 ms) except in subjects who had supra-His block. The effective refractory period of the AV node (385 +/- 26 ms) was increased by digoxin (450 +/- 37 ms). This effect was potentiated by propranolol (478 +/- 34 ms) except in those subjects who had supra-His block. In three cases in which there were two conduction pathways at A V node level the refractory periods of the rapid and slow pathways were increased by digoxin, with a synergistic effect from propranolol. The ventriculo-atrial conduction time changed from 151 +/- 24 ms to 172 +/- 22 ms following digoxin, then to 193 +/- 34 ms after the addition of propranolol.", 
    "34": "10 control subjects and 27 patients with prosthetic valves (15 with Bj\u00f6rk aortic valves, 6 with mitral prostheses, 4 with aortic and mitral valves, 1 with a Bj\u00f6rk mitral and a Starr aortic valve, and 1 with a Beall mitral valve) underwent, at intervals of 24 hours, two maximal exercise tests, initially without (day J) and subsequently with (day J + 2) propranolol in a dose of 80 mg/24 h, haemolysis and platelet function being assessed immediately before and immediately after each test. Exercise tolerance was not altered by propranolol in this dose, provided the heart size was not more than 1500 ml. Haemolysis, as assessed by the level of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH1) was increased by exercise, especially in the aortic prosthesis cases in which the LDH1 was increased by 21.6% (p less than 0.025). The increase was less marked under propranolol treatment, when it was 12.3% (p less than 0.05). Propranolol did not correct the platelet clumping caused by the prosthetic mitral valves, but did decrease platelet stickiness on exercise in the patients with prostheses (delta = -11.7%; p less than 0.05). Propranolol can not therefore be recommended for increased haemolysis if there is no demonstrable dysfunction of the prosthetic valve. Neither would we advise its use at present with the aim of reducing thrombotic accidents.", 
    "35": "Cardiac output (isotopic dilution method) and systolic time intervals were studied in 11 sustained and 8 borderline essential hypertensive patients, before and after intravenous administration of atenolol, a potent beta-blocking agent. Atenolol decreased significantly (p less than 0.01) cardiac output and heart rate. In borderline hypertensives, the preejection periods were significantly reduced. Atenolol prolonged the preejection periods more significantly (p less than 0.01) in borderline than in permanent hypertensives. Non invasive hemodynamic technics enabled the cardiac performance to be evaluated in hypertensives and the contribution of neurogenic factors in borderline hypertension to be estimated.", 
    "36": "The role of coronary adrenergic receptors in response to nitroglycerine and in the regulation of large and small coronary vascular resistance was evaluated in two separate studies involving fifteen anesthetized mongrel dog preparations, before and after alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade, respectively. Coronary blood flow (CBF) was measured through the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery by a non-cannulating electromagnetic flow probe. Pressure catheters were inserted into the arch of the aorta and into a distal apical branch of the LAD coronary artery to measure, respectively, aortic pressure (coronary perfusion pressure (PA), peripheral coronary pressure )PC), and coronary artery pressure gradient (PG = PA -PC). End-diastolic resistances to flow were computed as: (a) large coronary end-diastolic resistance (RL = PG/CBF), and (B) small coronary end-diastolic resistance (RS = PC/CBF). Nitroglycerine (NG) alone increased RL to approximately 180--220% of control and reduced RS to about 60% of control, respectively. Following pharmacologic blockade with propranolol (PRO), NG increased RL to about 180% of control and reduced RS to about 60% of control. Following alpha blockade with phenoxybenzamine (PBZ), NG decreased RL to about 78% of control and decreased RS to about 56% of control. It is concluded that while the overall effect of NG on the coronary vascular resistance is one of vasodilation, RL appears to be increased transiently and RS transiently decreased. Alpha adrenergic blockade appears to abolish this response. The increase in RL in response to NG appears to be associated with the systemic hypotensive effect in response to NG. It is proposed that the observed increase in RL is produced by the increase in cardiac sympathetic nerve activity which is initiated by the systemic hypotensive effect of NG.", 
    "37": "Ambulatory monitoring of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the electroencephalogram (EEG) in 12 untreated patients with frequent ventricular extrasystoles showed a significant decrease in both ventricular extrasystoles and heart rate during sleep. The decrease in ventricular extrasystoles correlated more closely with the change in heart rate than with the level of arousal. During wakefulness, similar changes in ventricular extrasystoles and heart rate could be produced by the intravenous administration of propranolol and, to a lesser extent, by phenylephrine. Exercise produced an initial increase in ventricular extrasystoles, with suppression at higher levels in most patients. Thus, the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles is usually reduced at both extremes of heart rate, and the changes that occur during sleep can be explained by autonomic mediation, with the sympathetic limb of the autonomic nervous system having a greater effect than the vagus.", 
    "38": "In the isolated atria, trachea and aorta of the guinea pig and in the heart-lung preparation (HLP) of the dog, labetalol was 3.6 approximately 5.9 times less potent than phentolamine in blocking alpha-adrenoceptors, 1.4 approximately 3.6 times less potent as beta 1-blocker and 6 times less potent as beta 2-blocker than propranolol. Beta 1 and beta 2-blocking actions were 12 approximately 28 and 7 times more potent than alpha-blocking action, respectively. As regards beta 1-blockade, attenuation of the heart rate increase was more prominent than that of the augmentation of the contractile force. Both in the isolated atrial preparation of the guinea pig and in canine HLP, labetalol produced a positive inotropic and chronotropic effect and a slight increase in the coronary flow associated with a slight increase in the myocardial O2 consumption and improvement of the myocardial redox potential. Myocardial extraction and usage of lactate, pyruvate and glucose tended to be decreased and those of FFA decreased significantly. The positive inotropic and chrontropic effect was observed in HLP of 6-hydroxydopamine-pretreated dogs and was abolished with propranolol. Labetalol produced a relaxation of the isolated trachea of the guinea pig, which was inhibited with propranolol. In doses higher than those required for alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade, labetalol produced calcium-antagonistic action.", 
    "39": "The appropriateness of hypertrophy was analyzed in 64 patients with essential hypertension during diagnostic cardiac catheterization and left ventriculography. The degree of hypertrophy may be described by the relationships between peak systolic pressure, mass to volume ratio and peak systolic wall stress. The peak systolic wall stress represents an important determinant of the appropriateness of hypertrophy and has great influence on left ventricular function and myocardial energy demand. The hypertrophy in essential hypertension may be subdivided into 3 different types of hypertrophy: (a) inappropriate hypertrophy associated with increased mass-to-volume ratio and decreased systolic wall stress, (b) appropriate hypertrophy with normal systolic wall stress and (c) inappropriate hypertrophy with normal or decreased mass-to-volume ratio, however with significantly increased systolic wall stress. On the basis of the appropriateness or degree of left ventricular hypertrophy in essential hypertension the therapeutical consequences are being discussed with special reference to beta receptor blockade and digitalis glycosides.", 
    "40": "Drugs used in obstetrics which affect carbohydrate metabolism are reviewed in regard to their mode of action and their effects on diabetic pregnancies. Hyperglycemic reactions can be expected following administration of diuretics (especially with long acting thiazides), diazoxide, beta-adrenergic stimulants (tocolytics), glucocorticoids, and prolactin. Hypoglycemic reactions can occur with high doses of acetylsalicylic acid and in the presence of insulin with beta-adrenergic blockers or other inhibitors of the sympathetic system such as guanethidine. Other drugs affecting the carbohydrate metabolism are listed in regard to their hypo- or hyperglycemic effects.", 
    "41": "The effect of catecholamines and adrenergic blocking agents on the oxidative desaturation of linoleic acid in rat liver microsomes was studied. Epinephrine (1 mg/kg/body weight) produced a significant decrease on the conversion of [1-14C]linoleic acid to gamma-linolenic acid. The effect of epinephrine was blocked by single injections of the beta blockers propranolol (10 mg/kg body weight) or dichloroisoproterenol 30 min before the hormone treatment. Isoproterenol (100 microgram/kg body weight) produced a significant decrease on the activity of the linoleyl-CoA desaturase. The effect of the catecholamines was postulated to be mediated through beta receptors by an enhancement of the intracellular levels of cyclic AMP.", 
    "42": "The effect of the introduction of a 2-methoxy substituent on the beta-adrenergic antagonistic properties of a series of 3- and 4-substituted phenylethanolamines (1) was studied. Both the series of bromo- and methyl-substituted compounds behaved similarly, indicating that electronic forces are not significant in determining beta-adrenergic antagonist activity. When compared with the corresponding phenylethanolamines without a 2-methoxy substitutent, the 2-methoxy-4-substituted derivatives (3a and 3d) had enhanced potency and selectivity but the 2,3- (3b and 3e) and the 2,5-disubstitution patterns (3c and 3f) showed a loss of activity. The inconsistent changes in activity prevented any firm conclusions being made about the effect of the ether oxygen and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity of phenoxypropanolamines.", 
    "43": "Timolol maleate is an effective agent of reducing intraocular pressure in patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma. To date, there are no adverse side effects demonstrable with use of this medication. Its mechanism of action is not clearly delineated but preliminary data suggest an effect on outflow facility.", 
    "44": "Comparative clinical and experimental study of the efficacy of the currently used anti-arrhythmic agents was conducted on 610 patients (828 cases) with various disorders of the cardiac rhythm. The modern classification of these agents is given. The indications and contra-indications for the prescription of the drugs, the optimum doses, and the routes of administration are discussed. Differentiated therapy in various disorders of the cardiac rhythm is recommended.", 
    "45": "Lipolytic activity was studied in brown and white adipose tissue of rats in vitro. 5-Hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT), phenylephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoprenaline were used as adipokinetic agents. All stimulated lipolysis in brown adipose tissue, but 5-HT and phenyl-ephrine did not in white adipose tissue. A beta-blocking drug, propranolol, inhibited the stimulatory effect of the agents in both adipose tissues. However, an alpha-blocking drug, phentolamine, further increased the lipolysis induced by noradrenaline or adrenaline in brown adipose tissue and inhibited the effect of isoprenaline. In white adipose tissue, its action was to marginally decrease the effect of adrenaline and noradrenaline. Increase in the pH of the incubation medium stimulated FFA and glycerol release in brown adipose tissue, but not in the epididymal adipose tissue. This effect of pH on lipolysis was further enhanced by phentolamine and decreased by propranolol. Increase of lipolysis with pH was not seen with brown fat tissue from the reserpine-treated rats. These results show that brown adipose tissue of the rat has an alpha-receptor with inhibitory effects on lipolysis that is affected by alpha- or mixed-type adrenergic agonists, noradrenaline and adrenaline.", 
    "46": "The effect of bilateral renal denervation on water intake and urine volume during specific thirst challenges was studied in rats. Renal denervation attenuated significantly the drinking response elicited by the administration of 30% polyethylene glycol (PG, extracellular challenge) but had no effect on the drinking response after an intracellular challenge (2.5 M NaCl) or after a 24-h water deprivation period. Furthermore, during a PG challenge total water intake was the same in two groups of rats, one with denervated kidneys and the other with beta-adrenergic neural activity in efferent renal nerves eliminated by blocking agents. Urine volumes were not affected by PG administration or water deprivation in denervated rats but were increased significantly after administration of 2.5 M NaCl. These results indicate that renal nerves play an important role in the physiological processes controlling extracellular thirst, and suggest that this role may be related to the neural control of release of renin.", 
    "47": "1 The effect of various beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents on the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-induced hyperactivity response produced in rats by administration of tranylcypromine (10 mg/kg i.p.) followed by L-tryptophan (50 mg/kg i.p.) has been investigated. 2 (+/-)-Alprenolol, (+/-)-timolol, (+/-)-sotalol, (+/-)-pindolol (all at 40 mg/kg) all inhibited the hyperactivity response to some degree when given 45 min before the tranylcypromine, as did (+/-)-oxprenolol when given after the L-tryptophan. 3 beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists that are not found in the brain appreciable amount after peripheral injection, (+/-)-atenolol, (+/-)-practolol, (+/-)-labetalol and (+/-)-acebutalol, did not inhibit the 5-HT-mediated behaviour. 4 Neither the beta1-selective drug (+/-)-metoprolol, nor the beta2-selective drug (+/-)-butoxamine inhibited the behavioral response. 5 The drugs that blocked the 5-HT-mediated behaviour did not alter brain 5-HT concentrations, synthesis rate or the accumulation of 5-HT following tranylcypromine/L-tryptophan. However, they did inhibit the hyperactivity produced by the suggested 5-HT agonist, 5-methoxy N,N-dimethyltryptamine, indicating that the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs were inhibiting the post-synaptic 5-HT-mediated response. 6 Circling produced by methamphetamine (3 mg/kg) in unilateral nigro-striatal lesioned rats was not altered by alprenolol, sotalol, pindolol or metaprolol, indicating that these drugs do not alter dopamine-mediated behaviour. 7 It is concluded that non-selective (beta1 and beta2) adrenoceptor antagonists which have a high brain/blood ratio following their peripheral injection, block 5-HT-mediated behavioural responses in the rat.", 
    "48": "4 cases of accidental fenfluramine poisoning in children are reported. Excitation, coma, convulsions, tachycardia, mydriasis, nystagmus, and rubeosis of the face were the most important signs. They appeared 30--60 min after ingestion, and some of them lasted for several days. 2 children had severe trismus and therefore had to be given muscle relaxants before intubation and gastric lavage became possible. These observations agree well with informations collected in our poisoning control center and with previously published data. Less than 5 mg/kg of body weight are toxic, 5--10 mg/kg may produce coma and convulsions, and the smallest lethal doses were 28,7 and 33,3 mg/kg. Early gastric lavage, good monitoring of the vital functions and, if necessary, administration of anticonvulsive drugs, beta-blocking agents, lidocaine, chlorpromazine, and artificial ventilation and cardiac defibrillation are the most important therapeutical measures.", 
    "49": "When tracheas were isolated from rats pretreated with isoproterenol (ISO) or terbutaline, they were found to be considerably less sensitive to the relaxant action of ISO than tracheas which were isolated from saline-pretreated rats. The dissociation constant (Kb) for the propranolol-beta receptor complex was determined to be up to 400-fold larger in the tracheas isolated from beta agonist-pretreated rats (1.1 +/- 0.1 X 10(-6) M) than in tracheas isolated from saline-pretreated rats (3.0 +/- 0.3 X 10(-9) M). The longer the duration of pretreatment and the higher the dose of ISO or terbutaline used, the more attenuated was the response of tracheal smooth muscle to ISO, and the greater was the Kb for propranolol-beta receptor complex. These findings provide strong evidence which shows that desensitization, which occurs as a result of in vivo pretreatment with beta agonist drugs, results from pronounced reduction in this affinity of the beta receptors for beta agonist drugs. We observed that the in vivo treatment of rats with aminophylline (Amino), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, did not affect the responsiveness of their isolated tracheas to either ISO or Amino. In addition, the responsiveness to Amino was determined in tracheal preparations taken from rats desensitized to ISO in vivo. The response to ISO was attenuated and the Kb for the propranolol-beta receptor complex was elevated (1.1 +/- 0.1 X 10(-6) M); however, Amino was half as effective in these tissues as in the saline control tissues. It is postulated, therefore, that the intracellular enzymes controlling the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate may be affected by the ISO-induced desensitization process, but are not affected by pretreatment with Amino.", 
    "50": "1. The antihypertensive effect of a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, trimepranol (10--14 mg/twice daily), chlorthalidone (50 mg every second day) and their combination was studied in eighteen patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. In a controlled randomized cross-over study the drugs were given for 6 week periods. 2. A significant and equal decrease in blood pressure was achieved both with trimepranol and chlorthalidone, whereas their combination was significantly more effective. 3. Trimepranol significantly antagonized the chlorthalidone-induced hypokalemia. 4. The results favor the use of diuretic or diuretic-beta-adrenoceptor blocker combination over beta-adrenoceptor blocker monotherapy in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "51": "Thirty-two eyes from 19 patients with either capsular glaucoma, pigmentary glaucoma or primary open angle glaucoma were given topical timolol and followed through a 3--6 months period. Twelve eyes were previously out of control on full medication including pilocarpine, epinephrine and acetazolamide. Eight of these eyes could be adequately controlled throughout the follow-up period on topical timolol or a combination of timolol and pilocarpine, but without resorting to acetazolamide. One eye needed acetazolamide in combination with timolol, and three eyes had to be referred to surgery. Twelve eyes were adequately controlled either on pilocarpine or full medication, but could be equally well controlled on timolol alone, or timolol and pilocarpine in combination. Acetazolamide could be withheld from all of the six patients who used this drug. Eight eyes were previously untreated. They could all be adequately controlled either on timolol (5 eyes) or timolol and pilocarpine (3 eyes). The study indicates that the effect of timolol 0.5% X 2 may be stronger than the combined effect of epinephrine 1% X 2 and acetazolamide 500 mg a day. Topical timolol was well tolerated. No side reactions occurred and the pupillary size and reactions were not influenced by the timolol treatment.", 
    "52": "The relationship between long-term propranolol hydrochloride therapy and subsequent coronary bypass operation was prospectively investigated in 119 patients who were grouped three ways: propranolol therapy continued in full dosage to operation (group A), propranolol therapy discontinued or tapered 24 to 72 hours preoperatively (group B), and no preoperative propranolol therapy (control group). During preoperative hospitalization, one patient in each group A and the control group suffered an increase in anginal symptoms compared with 15 patients in group B, three of whom also had new ventricular arrhythmias. During anesthesia up to the period of cardiopulmonary bypass, 26% of group A patients showed signs of ischemia (eg, ST segment deviation or ventricular arrhythmias) as compared with 51% of the control group and 70% of group B. Hypotension and bradycardia were not more common in group A patients. No differences among groups were noted in case of emergence from bypass, need for cardiac stimulants, or mortality.", 
    "53": "The effects of cold-acclimation, reserpine and propranolol were investigated on the survival time, rectal temperature and urinary excretion of histamine and 5-HT in guinea-pigs at -20 degrees C. Both reserpine and propranolol shortened survival time by 3 hours and 1.5 hours respectively, the shortest time being in the cold-acclimated reserpine-treated animals. There was a trend in severe cold exposure to increased excretion of histamine both in the non-acclimated and in cold-acclimated animals. Reserpine did not change the excretion but increased the concentration of histamine from 0.08 to 0.25 microgram/ml. Propranolol proved to be a histamine liberator by increasing the excretion in non-acclimated from 0.10 to 1.40 microgram/h and concentration from 0.10 to 4.52 microgram/ml and in cold-acclimated animals the excretion from 0.20 to 2.85 microgram/h and the concentration from 0.08 to 3.23 microgram/ml. Severe cold increased the excretion of 5-HT in the non-acclimated animals from 0.08 to 0.21 microgram/h and cold acclimation increased this to 0.17 microgram/h. Reserpine diminished the excretion from 0.08 to 0.03 microgram/h in the non-acclimated animals, but propranolol had no effect. The results showed that the excretion of histamine and 5-HT into urine are changed in cold and can be modified with drugs. The application of the findings in proving a cold stress deserves further study.", 
    "54": "A standardized ergometric test, suitable for recognizing abnormally high exercise blood pressures as well as the influence of hypotensive drugs on blood pressure, was employed in 13 of 28 hypertensives being treated with a combination of beta-receptor blockers (oxprenolol, 80 mg), a diuretic (chlortalidone, 10 mg), and a vasodilator (hydralazine, 25 mg). This combination was an effective antihypertensive measure with few side effects, particularly so in reducing elevated exercise blood pressures.", 
    "55": "Lanthanum (0.25 mM) does not penetrate into fresh or Mg2+-depleted cells, whereas it does into ATP-depleted or ATP + 2,3-diphosphoglycerate-depleted cells, into cells containing more than 3 mM calcium, or cells stored for more than 4 weeks in acid/citrate/dextrose solution. In fresh cells loaded with calcium, extracellular lanthanum blocks the active Ca2+-efflux completely and inhibits (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase (ATP phosphohydrolase, EC 3.6.1.3) activity to about 50%. In Mg2+-depleted cells Ca2+-Ca2+ exchange is inhibited by lanthanum. Ca2+-leak is unaffected by lanthanum up to 0.25 mM concentration; higher lanthanum concentrations reduce leak rate. In NaCl medium Ca2+-leak +/ S.D. amounts to 0.28 +/ 0.08 mumol/1 of cells per min, whereas in KC1 medium to 0.15 +/ 0.04 mumol/1 of cells per min at 2.5 mM [Ca2+]e and 0.25 mM [La3+]e pH 7.1. Lanthanum inhibits Ca2+-dependent rapid K+ transport in ATP-depleted and propranolol-treated red cells, i.e. whenever intracellular calcium is below a critical level. The inhibition of the rapid K+ transport can be attributed to protein-lanthanum interactions on the cell surface, since lanthanum is effectively detached from the membrane lipids by propranolol. Lanthanum at 0.2--0.25 mM concentration has no direct effect on the morphology of red cells. The shape regeneration of Ca2+-loaded cells, however, is blocked by lanthanum owing to Ca2+-pump inhibition. Using lanthanum the transition in cell shape can be quantitatively correlated to intracellular Ca2+ concentrations."
