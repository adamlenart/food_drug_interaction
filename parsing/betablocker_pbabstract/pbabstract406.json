Pressure was measured by micromanometer. Cardiac-specific assessment of change in chamber contractility and diastolic compliance due to each drug was determined.", 
    "6": "Both drugs lowered contractility by approximately 30% (P < 0.01). Esmolol slowed relaxation and reduced early peak filling rate, whereas verapamil delayed the time to peak filling (all P < 0.05). In contrast to the effects of both drugs on active contraction and early diastole, late-diastolic compliance was unaltered, and end-diastolic pressure-volume relations were almost identical.", 
    "7": "Neither beta-receptor nor calcium channel blockade acutely alters left ventricular compliance despite substantial active effects manifest in systole and early diastole. This supports the notion that chamber compliance is principally determined by passive structural elements in the heart rather than by active processes.", 
    "8": "The barrier function of cultured, macrovascular endothelial cells derived from bovine aorta was analyzed using confluent monolayers of cells and measuring the exchange of fluorescein dextrans of different molecular masses. The effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists with different selectivity for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors (AR) were investigated. Formoterol, a novel high-affinity agonist for beta 2-AR recently introduced in the treatment of bronchial asthma, showed a significant reduction of cell permeability with subnanomolar concentrations, whereas the catecholamines (-)-isoproterenol and (-)-norepinephrine only showed significant effects with micromolar concentrations. In order to elucidate if this difference in potential to regulate cell permeability is related to appropriate changes in the selectivity and affinity of the agonists for beta 2 AR, we investigated the beta AR-coupled adenylate cyclase (AC) in membranes from endothelial cells and compared AC stimulation with the binding of agonists to the receptors using [125I](-)-iodopindolol as radioligand. beta-Adrenoceptors revealed to be closely coupled to AC as assessed by a similar magnitude of effects by receptor agonists in comparison to GTP analogues and direct stimulants of AC activity. AC activity was increased by formoterol in parallel to its receptor occupancy of beta 2AR with nanomolar concentrations which were 50-fold higher than those used for the regulation of cell permeability indicating the existence of spare receptors. In contrast to formoterol, the catecholamines (-)-isoproterenol and (-)-norepinephrine stimulated AC activity through both beta 1AR and beta 2AR. From the overproportional high contribution of beta 1AR to AC stimulation (42%) in comparison to its low fraction (13%) in receptor binding we calculated that beta 1AR is 3-4-fold more effectively coupled to AC than beta 2 AR.", 
    "9": "A case-control study, with both retrospective and concurrent subject selection, was performed (1) to determine whether greater risk for anaphylactoid reaction from contrast media associated with beta-blocker exposure reflects presence, or is independent of underlying cardiovascular disorder; and (2) to characterize further the risk of anaphylactoid reaction from contrast media in patients with cardiovascular disorders and patients with asthma.", 
    "10": "Adverse reactions from intravenous contrast media were recorded in accordance with quality assurance guidelines. Anaphylactoid reactions were classified as mild to moderate (urticaria/angioedema), severe (stridor, bronchospasm, or hypotension), or major and life-threatening (hypotension with or without the need for subsequent hospitalization). Medical records from reactors were compared with those from matched (gender, age, date, and type of contrast study) controls who received conventional contrast media without adverse reaction.", 
    "11": "Of 34,371 intravenous contrast media procedures performed, 122 anaphylactoid reactions were recorded. The risk of anaphylactoid reaction was significantly associated with asthma (odds ratio [OR], 8.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.36 to 32.35; P = .0012). The risk of bronchospasm was associated with beta-blocker exposure (OR, 3.73; 95% CI, 1.18 to 11.75; P = .025) and with asthma (OR, 16.39; 95% CI, 4.30 to 62.46; P = .0001). The risk of major and life-threatening reaction was associated with the presence of cardiovascular disorder (OR, 7.71; 95% CI, 1.04 to 57.23; P = .046). Among patients with severe reactions, the risk of hospitalization was elevated by the presence of cardiovascular disorder (P = .001), exposure to beta-blockers (OR, 7.67; 95% CI, 1.79 to 32.85; P = .029), or asthma (OR, 20.7; 95% CI, 1.21 to 355.55; P = .065). Although beta-blocker exposure and the presence of cardiovascular disorder were highly associated (chi 2 = 49, P < .001), a greater risk of bronchospasm with severe reaction was observed in nonasthmatic patients with cardiovascular disorders receiving beta-blockers (OR, 15.75; P = .023). Among reactors with asthma, receiving beta-blockers, or with a cardiovascular disorder, 60.8% (31/51) experienced severe anaphylactoid reactions, compared with 35.2% (25/71) of patients without these risk factors (OR, 3.62; P = .005).",

    "13": "A chiral high-performance liquid chromatographic assay for the separation of the four stereoisomers of labetalol, an antihypertensive, in biological fluids has been developed. Baseline separation of the isomers was achieved using an alpha 1-acid glycoprotein stationary phase. No interference from endogenous substances was observed following extraction from various biological fluids obtained from pregnant (ewe and fetus) and non-pregnant sheep. The concentration of the individual isomers of labetalol was determined by first measuring the total concentration of racemic labetalol obtained from an achiral assay followed by reassay of each sample by the chiral method after which, by using the estimate of the percentage of each individual isomer, the individual concentration of each of the four isomers was determined. The mobile phase was 0.02 M phosphate buffer containing 0.015 M tetrabutylammonium phosphate. The pH of the mobile phase was adjusted to 7.10. The detector was set at an excitation wavelength of 230 nm and emission wavelength of 400 nm to monitor the nascent fluorescence intensity of the isomers of labetalol. The limit of detection of the individual isomers was 0.15 ng (0.6 ng of injected racemic labetalol). The assay was linear over the range 0.6-15.0 ng of labetalol (injected) with the intra- and inter-day mean coefficients of variation being less than 9.0 and 6.0%, respectively. Application of the assay in the study of pharmacokinetics of the stereoisomers of labetalol in sheep following administration of racemic labetalol has been demonstrated.", 
    "14": "3H-Labeled 9-methyl-7-bromoeudistomin D ([3H] MBED), the most powerful inducer of Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), was successfully prepared with a high specific activity of 10.2 Ci/mmol. [3H]MBED bound to terminal cisternae (TC) of skeletal muscle SR in a replacable and saturable manner, indicating the existence of its specific binding site. Caffeine inhibited the [3H]MBED binding to the TC-SR membranes from skeletal muscle with an IC50 value of 0.8 mM, in close agreement with a concentration that causes Ca2+ release from SR. Scatchard analysis gave values of KD = 40 nM and Bmax = 10 pmol/mg protein. The KD value was increased by caffeine, while that of Bmax was not changed, indicating a competitive mode of inhibition. Adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-methylene)triphosphate enhanced [3H]MBED binding, but ryanodine and Ca2+ did not affect it. [3H]MBED binding to TC-SR membranes was inhibited by procaine, a representative blocker of Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release channels, whereas that was not changed by Mg2+, suggesting that procaine but not Mg2+ may exert its inhibitory effect on Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release by affecting the caffeine-binding sites. These results suggest that MBED shares the same binding site as that of caffeine in TC-SR. The [3H]MBED is the first radiolabeled ligand for caffeine-binding sites in Ca2+ release channels and thus may provide an essential biochemical tool for elucidating this site.", 
    "15": "1. The alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist and beta 2-partial agonist activity of dilevalol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with vasodilating properties and labetalol were investigated in two studies. 2. In the first study, six healthy male subjects received serially increasing concentrations phenylephrine after single oral doses of dilevalol 200 mg, labetalol 400 mg and placebo at weekly intervals in a randomised double-blind manner. An exercise step test was performed at the end of the infusions. 3. The doses of phenylephrine required to increase systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 20 mmHg (PS20 and PD20 respectively) were increased by labetalol 400 mg (P < 0.05) but unchanged by dilevalol 200 mg. The dose ratios for PS20 (means +/- s.d.) were: dilevalol 200 mg 1.1 +/- 0.1, labetalol 400 mg 2.2 +/- 0.1. There was no difference in the percentage reduction in exercise tachycardia between dilevalol and labetalol. 4. In the second study, 10 healthy male subjects received infusions with serially increasing concentrations of phenylephrine and angiotensin II before and after single oral doses of dilevalol 200, 400 and 800 mg, labetalol 200 mg and placebo at weekly intervals in a double-blind randomised manner. Finger tremor was measured (piezoelectric accelerometer) with each infusion. An exercise step test was performed at the end of the infusions. 5. The PS20 and PD20 of phenylephrine were increased by labetalol 200 mg and unchanged by dilevalol. The dose ratios for PS20 were: dilevalol 200 mg 1.1 +/- 0.2. dilevalol 400 mg 1.1 +/- 0.4, dilevalol 800 mg 1.4 +/- 0.4 and labetalol 200 mg 2.5 +/- 0.7. The dose ratios for PD20 were: dilevalol 200 mg 1.1 +/- 0.4, dilevalol 400 mg 0.9 +/- 0.3. dilevalol 800 mg 1.3 +/- 0.4 and labetalol 200 mg 2.3 +/- 0.9. 6. The PS20 and PD20 of angiotensin II were unchanged by any of the drugs. 7. Exercise heart rate was reduced by dilevalol 200 mg (130 +/- 13 beats min-1), 400 mg (123 +/- 12 beats min-1), 800 mg (125 +/- 9 beats min) and labetalol 200 mg (143 +/- 12 beats min-1) vs placebo (161 +/- 17 beats min-1). 8. Finger tremor was significantly increased by dilevalol 800 mg (13.17 +/- 10.51 vs 6.62 +/- 4.51 centivolts for placebo: P < 0.01). Neither phenylephrine nor angiotensin II had an effect on finger tremor. 9. In conclusion, dilevalol 200, 400 and 800 mg demonstrated beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist activity with no evidence of alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist activity. Labetalol 200 and 400 mg showed both beta 1- and alpha 1-antagonist activity. Dilevalol 800 mg demonstrated significant partial beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist activity by increasing finger tremor.", 
    "16": "Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is frequently employed as an intra- and interindividual index of cardiac parasympathetic tone, although the relationship of RSA to interindividual differences in cardiac vagal tone remains questionable. Our study examined between- and within-subject relations among RSA, cardiac vagal tone, and respiratory parameters. Twenty-nine young adults performed two sessions of tasks under no medication and single and double autonomic blockade (intravenously administered propranolol and atropine). Parasympathetic tone was determined from heart period responses to complete vagal blockade. Results indicated the following. Resting RSA does not accurately predict individual differences in cardiac vagal tone. However, RSA and heart period together do predict such individual differences reasonably well. The relationship between individual variations in RSA and vagal tone is not improved by controlling respiratory parameters. Substantial cardiac vagal activity occurs during inspiration, and intraindividual variations in respiratory measures confound the association between RSA and cardiac vagal tone.", 
    "17": "To compare the efficacy of oral propranolol and sclerotherapy in the prevention of first hemorrhage from esophageal varices, 65 cirrhotic patients with moderate to large esophageal varices and no history of bleeding were included in the prospective controlled trial. After randomization, 33 patients received propranolol at a does reducing the heart rate by 25%; 32 patients were treated with intra-variceal and extra-variceal injection of ethanolamine oleate. On entry to the trial, the two groups were comparable in terms of clinical and biological parameters. The patients were observed for up to 60 months, with an average of 31 months. Nine patients bled (5 in propranolol and 4 in sclerotherapy) during follow-up. No significant difference were observed between propranolol and sclerotherapy in the cumulative bleeding rate and survival. The multivariate Cox model indicated that drug compliance in the propranolol group and high portal pressure in the sclerotherapy group were factors predictive of the first hemorrhage. These data support that propranolol and sclerotherapy are of comparable value in preventing the first hemorrhage in cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices.", 
    "18": "A case of surgical treatment of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) in a 5-year-old boy is reported. This is the youngest case in Japan. He had been diagnosed as HOCM and treated conservatively with beta-blocker and Ca-antagonist, but his complaints of dyspnea and chest oppression during efforts had increased. Cardiac catheterization showed a peak systolic pressure gradient of 110 mmHg between the left ventricle and systemic artery, and echocardiogram disclosed a systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve and mitral regurgitation (MR). At operation transaortic septal myectomy and myotomy were performed according to preoperative findings by echocardiogram and MRI, and a marked reduction in pressure gradient and a decrease in SAM and MR were obtained. Thus, a satisfactory result can be obtained by myectomy and myotomy without mitral valve replacement in a pediatric patient with HOCM, based on the preoperative image analysis.", 
    "19": "1. A possible role for the ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the pathogenesis of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis was investigated. 2. We assessed insulin release and muscle strength after intravenous glucose loading with and without the potassium channel opener pinacidil and the potassium channel blocker glibenclamide in three patients with hypokalaemic periodic paralysis and in a pair of matched control subjects for each patient. 3. A significantly higher initial insulin response (1.5-30 min) was found in the patients with hypokalaemic periodic paralysis in comparison with the control subjects. During potassium channel blocking with glibenclamide the insulin release was more enhanced in patients than in control subjects. On the other hand, the potassium channel opener pinacidil impaired the insulin release in healthy control subjects but not in patients. The serum glucose levels showed no differences between patients and control subjects. In one of the patients with hypokalaemic periodic paralysis glucose loading resulted in a fall in muscle strength, which did not occur during the administration of pinacidil. 4. These findings suggest a disturbance in the ATP-sensitive potassium channel in patients with hypokalaemic periodic paralysis, which is not limited to pancreatic beta cells, but may be also involved in the abnormal behaviour of skeletal muscle.", 
    "20": "Changes in microvascular permeability induced by platelet activating factor (PAF) were measured in the isolated, perfused cat hindlimb preparation, and compared to the effect produced by another inflammatory mediator, histamine. Permeability was assessed from changes in the protein reflection coefficient, as measured from changes in hematocrit and protein concentration resulting from microvascular fluid filtration. The findings were 1) PAF produces transient increases in permeability similar to histamine, but PAF is approximately 30 times as potent; 2) the permeability changes induced by 76 nM PAF can be totally inhibited by the specific PAF receptor blocker WEB-2086, but the blocker can only partially inhibit 380 nM PAF, a dose that produces a maximal increase in permeability; 3) Diphenhydramine (2 microM), an H1-receptor blocker, totally inhibits the transient permeability increase produced by 2 microM histamine; 4) Cimetidine (2 or 20 microM), an H2 blocker, could not inhibit this latter increase; 5) Isoproterenol (1 microM), a beta-agonist, totally inhibited the permeability increase produced by 1 microM histamine, but 10 microM isoproterenol only partially inhibited the maximal permeability increase produced by 10 microM histamine; 6) Isoproterenol could not inhibit PAF's permeability effect; and 7) PAF's effects were unchanged by depletion of white blood cells in the perfusate. These results suggest that PAF and histamine work through different pathways to increase permeability, but the final step of endothelial contraction, which opens large inter-endothelial gaps, occurs in response to both mediators. In addition, when concentrations of these inflammatory agents are sufficient to produce maximal permeability increases, as can occur in shock situations, then the permeability increases are more sustained and resistant to receptor inhibition.", 
    "21": "Changes in the distribution of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase in two subcellular fractions, the sarcolemma and the light vesicle, of rat heart during sepsis were studied. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The alpha-subunit of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase was photoaffinity labeled with [alpha-32P]8-N3ATP. The results show that septic rat heart exhibits hyperdynamic (hypermetabolic) phase during early (9 hr post-CLP), followed by hypodynamic (hypometabolic) phase during late (18 hr post-CLP) sepsis. Marker enzyme and beta-adrenergic receptor assays depict that the light vesicle fraction is the intracellular site of surface receptor. The incorporation of the photolabel into the alpha-subunit (M(r) = 98,000) of the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase in sarcolemmal fraction was increased by 60% (P < 0.01) during early sepsis, but was decreased by 63% (P < 0.01) during late sepsis. In contrast, the binding of 98,000-M(r) peptide in light vesicles was decreased by 40% (P < 0.01) in early sepsis, but was increased by 102% (P < 0.01) during late sepsis. The ouabain-sensitive (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity was increased by 31% (P < 0.05) during the early sepsis, but was decreased by 32% (P < 0.01) during late sepsis in the sarcolemmal fraction; while in the light vesicle fraction, the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity was decreased by 21% (P < 0.01) during early sepsis, but was increased by 47% (P < 0.01) during the late phase of sepsis. The yield of membrane proteins for each specific fraction remained unchanged for control, early sepsis, and late sepsis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "30": "The ability of phosphatidic acid to induce O2- generation was examined in intact and electropermeabilized neutrophils. In intact cells, after a long lag (approximately 11 min), 1,2-didecanoylphosphatidic acid (PA10, 10 microM) elicited O2- generation (30-40 nmol/min/10(7) cells at maximum) which lasted for 8-9 min. Electropermeabilization facilitated the response by shortening the lag (within 30 s) and enhancing the maximal rate (120-130 O2- nmol/min/10(7) cells). The induction by PA10 was concentration-dependent and the half-maximal concentrations for intact and permeabilized cells were 11 and 3 microM, respectively. In permeabilized cells, the rate of O2- release by PA10, which was similar to that by fMet-Leu-Phe or phorbol myristate acetate, was not enhanced by addition of dioctanoylglycerol. Also, the response was unaffected by propranolol, an inhibitor of phosphatidate-phosphohydrolase that converts phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol. Phosphatidic acids with longer acyl chains (C12-C14) also activated the permeabilized cells, although the degree of activation decreased as the chain length was increased. These results indicate the ability of phosphatidic acid to induce respiratory burst independently of diacylglycerol and support the idea that phosphatidic acid can be an activator of NADPH oxidase in human neutrophils.", 
    "31": "The effect of the alpha-adrenergic blocker moxisylyte was examined on smooth muscle cells isolated from human corpus cavernosum, and compared with that of other adrenergic agents and papaverine. Isolated smooth muscle cells were shown to contract (reduction of the mean cell length) under noradrenaline and carbachol stimulations in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner (maximum at 30 seconds, EC50 [noradrenaline] = 5 nM., EC50 [carbachol] = 1 nM.). The contractile effect of noradrenaline was dose-dependently inhibited by moxisylyte (IC50 = 0.5 +/- 0.2 microM.) and by prazosin (IC50 = 0.9 +/- 0.2 microM.). The dose-response curves were parallel and no statistically significant difference could be shown between the IC50 values. The alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist tolazoline also inhibited noradrenaline-induced contraction, whereas the alpha-adrenergic agonist methoxamine did not change the mean cell length. As expected, isoproterenol caused relaxation of noradrenaline-precontracted cells by interaction with a beta 2-adrenergic receptor. Papaverine was also found to inhibit the contraction induced by noradrenaline in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 2 +/- 0.3 nM.). Tritiated-dihydroergocryptine (3H-DHE) specific binding was competitively inhibited by moxisylyte and prazosin with the same IC50 value of 0.01 microM. Methoxamine and tolazoline also inhibited this binding with lower affinity (IC50 = 0.1 +/- 0.02 microM.), while isoproterenol did not change specific binding. Scatchard plots from saturation experiments with 3H-DHE and with 3H-N-methyl scopolamine revealed the presence of 15 times more adrenergic than muscarinic binding sites (650,000 and 45,000 sites per cell, respectively). Together, these data support evidence for the presence of postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenergic receptors on smooth muscle cells from human corpus cavernosum. These receptors are coupled with the contraction of the cell and are blocked by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonists moxisylyte or prazosin. They also show that the phosphodiesterase inhibitor papaverine and the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induced relaxation. This model constitutes a new approach to study the potential targets of the adrenergic agents in the erectile tissue.", 
    "32": "The effects of neuron blockers on neurotransmitter accumulation in synaptic vesicles were investigated. Upon addition of ATP, brain synaptic vesicles accumulated chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and propranolol against concentration gradients of more than 100-fold. Bioenergetic analysis indicated that the transmembrane pH gradient (delta pH) established by the vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase is a direct driving force for these uptakes. Essentially the same results were obtained with vesicles from bovine adrenal chromaffin granules and proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified vacuolar H(+)-ATPase, indicating that the energy-dependent accumulation is due to diffusion and does not involve transport carriers specific for the blockers. Incubations of the two organelles with the blockers resulted in dissipation of delta pH and slight increase of membrane potential (delta psi) without affecting ATPase activity. Under the same conditions, uptake of dopamine or gamma-aminobutyrate (delta pH-driven transport) was inhibited by neuron blockers, whereas uptake of glutamate (delta psi-driven transport) was slightly stimulated. Thus, neuron blockers inhibited delta pH-driven uptake of neurotransmitter by dissipating the driving force. These results strongly suggest that synaptic vesicles are one of the target sites of neuron blockers.",

    "37": "beta-Agonists cause an inhibition of contractility and a transient stimulation of Na+/K+ pumping in smooth muscle cells of the stomach from the toad Bufo marinus. To determine if the stimulation of Na+/K+ pumping causes changes in intracellular [Na+] ([Na+]i) that might link Na+ pump stimulation to decrease Ca2+ availability for contraction, [Na+]i was measured in these cells with SBFI, a Na(+)-sensitive fluorescent indicator. Basal [Na+]i was 12.8 +/- 4.2 mM (n = 32) and was uniform throughout the cell. In response to isoproterenol, [Na+]i decreased an average of 7.1 +/- 1.1 mM in 3 sec. Since this decrease in [Na+]i could be completely blocked by inhibition of the Na+ pump, or by blockade of the beta-receptor, [Na+]i reduction is the result of occupation of the beta-receptor by isoproterenol and subsequent stimulation of the Na+ pump. 8-Bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and forskolin mimicked the effect of isoproterenol, indicating that the sequence of events linking beta-receptor occupation to Na+ pump stimulation most likely includes activation of adenylate cyclase, production of cAMP, and stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The decrease in [Na+]i is sufficiently large and fast that it is expected to stimulate turnover of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in the Ca2+ extrusion mode, thereby accounting for the observed linkage between stimulation of the Na+/K+ pump and inhibition of contractility in response to beta-adrenergic agonists.", 
    "38": "Therapy in hypertensive urgencies is debated and complicated by the side effects of available agents. In a prospective, randomized, open labeled study, the use of oral labetalol, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocker, with oral nifedipine in hypertensive urgencies in the emergency department was compared. Patients with diastolic blood pressures (DBP) of more than 120 mm Hg without criteria for a hypertensive emergency were eligible. The drugs were given in a loading manner with doses and timing based on their respective pharmacokinetics until a DBP of 110 mm Hg or lower was obtained or 4 hours had passed.

Data were collected on 115 patients (aged > 18 years) with atrial fibrillation or flutter who were treated with digoxin for rapid ventricular rate (> or = 120 beats/min). The median time to ventricular rate control (i.e., resting ventricular rate < 100 beats/min, decrease in ventricular rate of > 20%, or sinus rhythm) was 11.6 hours from the first dose of digoxin for all evaluable patients (n = 105) and 9.5 hours for those only receiving digoxin (n = 64). Before ventricular rate control, the mean +/- SD dose of digoxin administered was 0.80 +/- 0.74 mg, and a mean of 1.4 +/- 1.8 serum digoxin concentrations were ordered per patient.

The effect of thrombolysis on the incidence of LPs after AMI is controversial and its impact on subsequent arrhythmic events is not known. Moreover, the effects of beta blockers on the SAECG have not been studied. Six hundred eighteen patients with AMI were studied; thrombolysis was given to 228 (37%). In comparison with patients treated conventionally, those receiving thrombolysis were significantly younger and more frequently male, had higher peak values of creatine kinase, a lower prevalence of non-Q-wave AMI, and a higher incidence of ventricular fibrillation in the acute phase, and more frequently received beta blockers. An SAECG obtained 6 to 8 days after AMI showed LPs in 24% of patients receiving and in 25% not receiving thrombolysis (p = NS). On admission, intravenous beta blockers were administered to 110 patients (18%); those receiving beta blockers were younger, had lower peak values of creatine kinase and more frequently received thrombolysis.

The rate-pressure product was closely correlated with myocardial oxygen uptake before and after administration of each drug. However, the slope of the regression line of rate-pressure product (X) and myocardial oxygen uptake (Y) became significantly steeper after the calcium channel blocker administration, and the Y-intercept was significantly increased by administration of the beta-blocker. Myocardial oxygen uptake was increased after administration of the calcium channel blocker and the beta-blocker compared with control values at corresponding rate-pressure product. These observations should be considered when the rate-pressure product is used to predict myocardial oxygen uptake in patients with angina pectoris who are receiving antianginal drugs.",

Loading and maintenance doses were used to produce stable plasma concentrations, and computer-based 112-electrode epicardial mapping was used to study atrial conduction and activation during atrial fibrillation. Clinically used doses of procainamide and propafenone terminated atrial fibrillation in 13 of 13 (100%) and 7 of 10 (70%) dogs, respectively, but a dose of sotalol (2 mg/kg IV) in the clinical range terminated atrial fibrillation in only 2 of 8 (25%) dogs (P = .0005 vs procainamide, P = .08 vs propafenone). Procainamide and propafenone prevented atrial fibrillation induction in 13 of 13 (100%) and 7 of 10 (70%) dogs, respectively, compared with none of 8 dogs for 2 mg/kg sotalol (P < .0001 vs procainamide, P = .004 vs propafenone). A larger dose of sotalol (cumulative dose, 8 mg/kg) was uniformly effective in terminating atrial fibrillation and preventing its induction. All drugs significantly increased atrial refractory period, with effects that were use dependent for propafenone but reverse use dependent for sotalol. Effective doses of all drugs significantly increased the wavelength for reentry at rapid atrial rates in the presence of vagal stimulation into the range observed under drug-free conditions in the absence of vagal input. The inefficacy of clinical doses of sotalol was explained by the reverse use dependence of its effects on refractoriness, which resulted in reduced effects on wavelength at rapid rates. The effects of propafenone on refractoriness were significantly increased at rapid rates, contributing to its ability to increase wavelength and terminate atrial fibrillation. Activation mapping showed that drugs terminated atrial fibrillation by reducing the number and increasing the size of reentry circuits, leading to termination by mechanisms related to block in the remaining circuit(s).",

    "52": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible value of continuous administration of propranolol in the prevention of recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis undergoing chronic endoscopic sclerotherapy. Among 239 patients admitted for acute variceal bleeding, 85 with cirrhosis were randomized to receive sclerotherapy either alone (40) or in combination with propranolol (45). Sclerotherapy was carried out with an intravariceal injection of 5% ethanolamine oleate through a fiberoptic endoscope. The procedure was performed every week, until the esophageal varices at the gastroesophageal junction were too small for any further injections. Varices were reinjected if they recurred. Propranolol was given orally twice a day until heart rate was reduced by 25% in the resting position. The mean follow-up period was 23.2 and 24.2 months for sclerotherapy and the sclerotherapy plus propranolol groups, respectively. During this period a significant (P = 0.001) reduction in the recurrence of esophageal varices was observed in patients treated with the combination of sclerotherapy plus propranolol compared with those treated with sclerotherapy alone. However, the time of rebleeding from any source or from esophageal varices did not differ significantly between the two groups. In the sclerotherapy group 21 patients rebled (35 bleeding episodes) compared with 14 (22 episodes) in the combination therapy group. Patients in the sclerotherapy group were more prone to bleed from gastric varices and congestive gastropathy than patients treated with the combination of sclerotherapy plus propranolol (P = 0.012). Twenty-five patients in the endoscopic sclerotherapy group developed complications attributed to sclerotherapy compared with 23 patients in the sclerotherapy plus propranolol group. Complications directly attributable to propranolol were observed in 11 patients. Three of these patients stopped taking the drug due to heart failure (1) and flapping tremor (2). Eight patients (17.8%) died in the latter group while the corresponding figure in the sclerotherapy group was nine (22.5%). It is concluded that the continuous administration of propranolol may reduce incidences of recurrent upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage from gastric sources in patients with cirrhosis undergoing chronic sclerotherapy.",

All patients had had at least one documented episode of variceal bleed in the previous 4 weeks. Fifty-eight patients received propranolol and 56 received placebo in addition to weekly EST. Rebleeding occurred in 12 (21%) patients in the placebo group and 10 (17%) patients in the propranolol group during a mean follow-up period of 24.4 +/- 10.4 months in the former and 23.8 +/- 9.2 months in the latter group (P > 0.1). The number of episodes of rebleeding (14 in the placebo and 12 in the propranolol group) were also similar (P > 0.1). The median bleeding-free period was more than 40 months in both treatment groups (P > 0.1). The mean transfusion requirements and the number of hospital admissions for rebleeding were also similar in the two treatment groups (P > 0.1). Complete obliteration of varices was achieved in 44 (78.9%) patients in the placebo group and 43 (75.5%) patients in the propranolol group (P > 0.1). Recurrence of new varices was seen in two patients in the placebo and in three of those in the propranolol group. Seven patients in the placebo group and five in the propranolol group died (P > 0.1). Complications related to EST were similar in the two treatment groups but additional adverse effects were observed in the propranolol group. The cumulative incidence of rebleeding in the placebo group was 12.7 and in the propranolol group it was 11.2 per 100 patient years of follow-up. It is concluded that the addition of propranolol in patients with portal hypertension and fair hepatic function on long-term EST does not confer any additional benefit.",

    "58": "The structure-toxicity relationship of monoketones, a class of organic solvents widely used in industry, was investigated with respect to their in vitro effects on synaptosomal membrane proteins. The toxic parameters used were Na(+)-K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase), a well-known marker enzyme often used as a membrane toxicity model, and 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA)-labeled beta-adrenergic receptor binding that has been shown to be vulnerable to solvent-induced changes in membrane fluidity. In vitro treatments with 12 kinds of monoketones (carbon chain length from 3-10) dose-dependently inhibited both 3H-DHA binding to mouse synaptosomes and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity. The potency of inhibition (IC50) for both the two parameters was linearly related to n-octanol/water partition coefficient and synaptosome/buffer partition coefficient of the test compounds. Additions of monoketones did not significantly alter the number of 3H-DHA binding sites but markedly decreased their affinity. In each monoketone, the IC50 values for 3H-DHA binding and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity were generally within the same range. The anisotropy of fluorescence probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene-labeled synaptosomal membranes was dose-dependently decreased by the monoketones, implying increased membrane fluidity. These results indicate that increasing lipophilicity of monoketones results in increased solvent penetration of synaptic membrane preparations, leading to conformational changes in membrane structure and increased ability to inhibit both neuroreceptor binding and enzyme activity. The present data confirm the importance of the lipid micro-environment of membranes in maintaining the normal functions of membrane-bound proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "1. In precollicular decerebrate rabbits we investigated the effect of sympathetic stimulation, at frequencies within the physiological range, on the tonic vibration reflex (TVR) elicited in jaw closing muscles by small amplitude vibrations applied to the mandible (15-50 microns, 150-180 Hz). The EMG activity was recorded bilaterally from masseter muscle and the force developed by the reflex was measured through an isometric transducer connected with the mandibular symphysis. 2. Unilateral stimulation of the peripheral stump of the cervical sympathetic by the TVR, and a marked decrease or disappearance of the ipsilateral EMG activity. No significant changes were detected in the EMG contralateral to the stimulated nerve. Bilateral CSN stimulation reduced by 60-90% the force reflexly produced by the jaw closing muscles and strongly decreased or suppressed EMG activity on both sides. This effect was often preceded by a transient TVR enhancement, very variable in amplitude and duration, which was concomitant with the modest increase in pulmonary ventilation induced by the sympathetic stimulation. 3. During bilateral CSN stimulation, an increase in the vibration amplitude by a factor of 1.5-2.5 was sufficient to restore the TVR reduced by sympathetic stimulation. 4. The depressant action exerted by sympathetic activation on the TVR is mediated by alpha-adrenergic receptors, since it was almost completely abolished by the I.V. administration of either phentolamine or prazosin, this last drug being a selective antagonist of alpha 1-adrenoceptors. The sympathetically induced decrease in the TVR was not mimicked by manoeuvres producing a large and sudden reduction or abolition of the blood flow to jaw muscles, such as unilateral or bilateral occlusion of the common carotid artery. 5. The effect of sympathetic stimulation was not significantly modified after denervation of the inferior dental arch and/or anaesthesia of the temporomandibular joint, i.e. after having reduced the afferent input from those receptors, potentially affected by CSN stimulation, which can elicit either a jaw opening reflex or a decrease in the activity of the jaw elevator muscle motoneurons. 6. These data suggest that, when the sympathetic nervous system is activated under physiological conditions, there is a marked depression of the stretch reflex which is independent of vasomotor changes and is probably due to a decrease in sensitivity of muscle spindle afferents.", 
    "60": "1. The present study investigated the mechanisms by which endogenous opioids regulate oxytocin secretion at the level of the posterior pituitary gland. Effects of the selective kappa-agonist U50,488 on oxytocin secretion were studied in urethane-anaesthetized lactating rats. Oxytocin secretion in response to electrical stimulation (0.5 mA, matched biphasic 1 ms pulses, 50 Hz, 60-180 pulses) of the neurohypophysial stalk was bioassayed on-line by measuring increases in intramammary pressure, calibrated with exogenous oxytocin. Intravenous (I.V.) U50,488 inhibited electrically stimulated oxytocin secretion, without affecting mammary gland sensitivity to oxytocin. The inhibition was dose related, with an ID50 of 441 (+194, -136) micrograms/kg and was naloxone reversible. Antagonism of endogenous beta-adrenoceptor activation by propranolol (1 mg/kg) reduced the potency of U50,488. The selective mu-agonist morphine (up to 5 mg/kg), had no effect on electrically stimulated oxytocin secretion, but depressed the mammary response to oxytocin. 2. In lactating rats given intracerebroventricular (I.C.V.) morphine infusion for 5 days to induce tolerance and dependence, I.V. U50,488 still inhibited electrically stimulated oxytocin secretion, but the ID50 was reduced to 170 (+78, -54) micrograms/kg; thus at the posterior pituitary the sensitivity of kappa-receptors is enhanced rather than reduced in morphine-tolerant rats, indicating the absence of cross-tolerance. In these rats, naloxone produced a large, sustained, fluctuating increase in intramammary pressure indicating morphine-withdrawal excitation of oxytocin secretion; I.V. U50,488 diminished this response, confirmed by radioimmunoassay, demonstrating the independence of mu- and kappa-receptors regulating oxytocin secretion. 3. In pregnant rats, I.C.V. infusion of morphine from day 17-18 of pregnancy delayed the start of parturition by 4 h, but did not significantly affect the progress of parturition once established, indicating tolerance to the inhibitory actions of morphine on oxytocin secretion in parturition, and lack of cross-tolerance to endogenous opioids restraining oxytocin in parturition. 4. Neurointermediate lobes from control and I.C.V. morphine-infused virgin rats were impaled on electrodes and perifused in vitro. Vasopressin and oxytocin release from the glands was measured by radioimmunoassay. Each gland was exposed to two periods of electrical stimulation (13 Hz, for 3 min).

Bisoprolol, a cardioselective beta-blocker, was used in a dose of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg. HCTZ was used at a dose of 6.25 mg. This low-dose compound was developed to minimize dose-related adverse effects. The addition of HCTZ to each of the doses of bisoprolol was compared with monotherapy and placebo. Results of both studies demonstrated that this once-a-day, low-dose option effectively reduced sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure measured at the end of the 24-hour dosing period. Drug-related adverse effects, including those generally associated with traditional beta-blocker therapy, were infrequent in individuals who received the low-dose bisoprolol/HCTZ regimen. Dose-related side effects were minimized because of the low doses of the two agents used together. There were no significant changes in mean total cholesterol, triglycerides, or serum glucose with bisoprolol/HCTZ 6.25 mg therapy versus placebo (analysis of variance statistical methods). The incidence of treatment-induced hypokalemia with bisoprolol/HCTZ 6.25 mg was not significant; uric acid elevations were minimized, and the incidence of hyperuricemia was significantly (P < 0.01) less with bisoprolol/HCTZ 6.25 mg than with 25 mg of HCTZ. Once-a-day dosing with the low-dose agent controlled (defined as a sitting diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mmHg and/or a decrease from baseline > or = 10 mmHg) blood pressure in up to 80% of patients for a full 24 hours after dosing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "63": "Previous studies in children have shown inconsistent, poorly reproducible GH responses to exogenous GH-releasing factor (GRF), with wide individual variability. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that prior administration of the long-acting somatostatin analog, SMS 201-995 (SMS), will enhance GH responsiveness to a subsequent GRF challenge. Two study protocols were employed in 37 children with short stature [M = 31, F = 6, ages 11.8 +/- 1.6 yr (mean +/- SEM), height -2.25 +/- 0.55 SDS (SD scores)]. In both studies, each subject served as his/her own control. In the first study, which was designed to determine optimal SMS dose and regimen, SMS, in doses ranging from 0.8-2.2 micrograms/kg sc, was randomly administered or omitted at 0800 h after an overnight fast, and a GRF bolus (50 micrograms, iv) was given 4 h later. In the second study, we employed a protocol identical to study 1 except for the use of standard doses of SMS (1 microgram/kg, sc) and GRF (1 microgram/kg, iv) and an additional 1-h delay of the GRF injection. Plasma GH levels were measured every 20 min from 0800 h until 2 h after the GRF injection in both studies.

Secretion production was not altered at rest by any treatment and increased during exercise in all four (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between weights of secretions produced between any of the treatment groups during exercise. Salbutamol significantly decreased nasal peak expiratory flow at rest compared with placebo (p < 0.05). During exercise nasal peak flow increased in all groups, but peak exercise values were significantly reduced by both salbutamol and isoprenaline (p < 0.05). Atenolol appeared to have no effect on nasal peak expiratory flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "We investigated whether the putative beta 3-adrenoceptors mediated metabolic responses to isoprenaline. Seven normal volunteers received infusions of isoprenaline, a (beta 1, beta 2 and beta 3-agonist), at 0.5-3.0 micrograms/min. They were pretreated with either placebo, 25 mg atenolol (a selective beta 1 antagonist), or 5, 20 and 80 mg nadolol (which blocks beta 1 and beta 2 but not beta 3-adrenoceptors). Isoprenaline markedly (30.6%) increased basal metabolic rate (BMR): this increase was significantly reduced by 25 mg atenolol but not by 5 mg nadolol. Significant beta 2-blockade (from tremor data) occurred with 5 mg nadolol but not with 25 mg atenolol. This suggests that beta 1 but not beta 2-adrenoceptors are involved in the mediating thermogenic effects of isoprenaline. However, the rise in BMR was not totally blocked even by 80 mg nadolol (9.5%), which produced complete beta 1/beta 2 blockade, as evidenced by the elimination of the chronotropic effect of isoprenaline. This implies that the thermogenic response has a non-beta 1/beta 2-mediated component. There were also significant increases in plasma free fatty acids, glycerol, glucose, insulin and lactate, but these were completely abolished by beta 1/beta 2 blockade. Overall, isoprenaline produced an increase in BMR which is only partly due to stimulation of beta 1-adrenoceptors, and which is not associated with beta 1/beta 2-mediated effects on carbohydrate and fat metabolism. This suggests the possibility of thermogenic beta 3-adrenoceptors in man, although their location and role remain unknown.",

Employing a resident-intruder paradigm, administration of pindobind 5-HT1A (0.5-10 mg/kg) to resident animals produced a reduction in offensive sideways and chasing behaviour. Defensive postures were unchanged except for evasion, which was reduced. Within social behaviour, nonspecific social behaviour and following behaviour were reduced while stretch/attend behaviour was enhanced. Nonsocial behavioural changes included an increase in resident cage exploration and rearing. Intruder data indicated no significant change in offensive behaviours, an attenuation of defensive sideways posturing and evasion, decreases in attend behaviour, and increases in cage exploration, rearing, and digging. Results are discussed in relation to the effects of 5-HT1A receptor (ant)agonism on murine offensive behaviour.", 
    "67": "Death from cocaine intoxication results from one or more of the multiple mechanisms including seizures, cardiovascular collapse, or apnea. In the free-moving rat model, continuous seizures are a major cause of death. To study other mechanisms of death unrelated to seizures in this model, we suppressed lethal seizures with diazepam (DZP) and investigated the effect of several pharmacological agents. Rats were pretreated with vehicle alone, diazepam 5 mg/kg alone, or a combination of DZP plus either nifedipine (NIFD) 2 mg/kg, propranolol (PROP) 10 mg/kg, or prazosin (PRAZ) 5 mg/kg. Five minutes after pretreatment, all animals received cocaine 100 mg/kg. Each test group consisted of 15 animals and all agents were given IP. Two animals in each group had cortical electrodes implanted. Animals that received vehicle followed by cocaine had 100% incidence of seizures and death. Those rats that received DZP alone followed by cocaine had no seizures and 53% death. Rats that received DZP plus NIFD or DZP plus PROP had suppression of seizures but no significant change in the incidence of death. The group that received DZP and PRAZ followed by cocaine had no seizures and 13% incidence of death (p < 0.001). Electroencephalogram recordings showed cortical electrical spike activity or spike-and-wave afterdischarges in all animals clinically observed to have seizures. In the absence of clinical seizure activity, no significant cortical spike activity was noted. It is concluded that animals protected from seizures with diazepam can still have nonseizure deaths after high-dose cocaine. The incidence of death in these animals is not reduced with nifedipine or propranolol pretreatment but is reduced with prazosin pretreatment.",

Pindolol (10-40 mg/kg, IP) and NAN190 (2.5-10 mg/kg, IP) produced a dose-related block of 8-OH-DPAT-induced LLR. Pindolol (10-40 mg/kg, IP) when administered alone was also found to cause LLR, suggesting that pindolol behaves as a partial agonist in this model. This was not the case with NAN190 (2.5-10 mg/kg, IP), which failed to produce LLR; however, NAN190 (2.5-10 mg/kg, IP) produced a dose-related block of the pindolol-induced LLR. These results clearly demonstrate that the LLR model can be used to detect 5-HT1A agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists.", 
    "69": "The prognostic importance psychosocial factors after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is still debated. A fourfold increase in risk of mortality after AMI was reported for participants in the beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial who were described as being socially isolated and having high levels of life stress. This study was designed to determine the influence of social isolation and/or life stress on mortality after AMI in an English population. It was a follow-up study of a subset of patients recruited for the Anglo-Scandinavian Study of Early Thrombolysis (ASSET), between November 1986 and February 1988. The study group comprised 1,376 patients with suspected AMI (1,073 men and 303 women), from coronary care units in six English hospitals. Patients who were alive at 7 days and had completed a psychosocial questionnaire within seven days post-infarction were followed up for a median time of three years, the sole outcome measure being death from all causes. All deaths were notified by the National Health Service Central Registry (NHSCR). Cox's regression was used to allow for independent clinical prognostic factors such as age-group, previous documented infarct, complications in hospital, history of diabetes and history of hypertension. Socially isolated patients (in terms of lack of membership of any club or religious group or lack of contact with family and friends) were 49% more likely to die after an infarction than patients classified as not being socially isolated. While this statistic is of borderline significance it does suggest that such patients are at an increased risk of death after AMI. No associations with mortality risk were found with life-stress level, type A behaviour pattern or depression.", 
    "70": "Nurse practitioners who are responsible for the clinical management of patients with hypertension must choose antihypertensive medications that minimize side effects. Nurse practitioners must be aware of the drugs' potential influences on physiologic and psychological variables and include adequate assessment of these responses in patients during treatment. Pindolol, propranolol, and hydrochlorothiazide were equally effective in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure in essential hypertensives, although pindolol and hydrochlorothiazide did not affect resting heart rate (an advantage in some patients). Hydrochlorothiazide was associated with a trend for several negative mood changes in black subjects; depression scores of black subjects were significantly increased with hydrochlorothiazide. The results of this study indicate the need to consider race and other factors in research about antihypertensive mood responses.",

Field stimulation (0.3 ms pulses, 60 V nominal, 2 min trains) at frequencies > or = 2 Hz evoked a frequency-dependent increase in baseline tension which was maximum at frequencies > or = 16 Hz. Evoked contractions were significantly reduced (P = 0.02) by the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (10(-6) M) although they were unaffected by the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists phentolamine, rauwolscine and prazosin (3 x 10(-6) M). Similarly, responses were unaffected by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (10(-6) M), the cholinergic antagonist atropine (10(-6) M) or the uptake blocker cocaine (10(-6) M). Field-evoked contraction was also unaffected by a 30 min exposure to alpha,beta-methylene ATP (10(-6) M). The results suggest that bovine lymph node capsular smooth muscle is innervated by excitatory nerves which are non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic and non-purinergic in nature.", 
    "72": "The renal and biliary excretion of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent dilevalol (CAS 75659-07-3) and its conjugates was examined in a preliminary pharmacokinetic study. Plasma, urine and bile dilevalol concentrations were determined with a simplified procedure that is based on alkaline liquid-liquid extraction using diethyl ether and subsequent reversed-phase HPLC separation of the reconstituted samples (on a PRP-1 stationary phase using a mixture of methanol and pH 9.8 carbonate buffer as mobile phase). Triamterene was used as internal standard. The quantification of the conjugates was accomplished indirectly via enzymatic hydrolysis (glusulase) with and without addition of the beta-glucuronidase inhibitor 1,4-saccharolactone (at a final concentration of 5.5 mmol/l). In the pharmacokinetic study healthy volunteers and cholecystectomised patients with a T-drain received a single oral dose of 200 mg dilevalol. Furthermore, to healthy volunteers an i.v. dose of 60 mg dilevalol was given in order to estimate the absolute bioavailability. From the obtained data the systemic plasma clearance was calculated to be 1708 ml/min. The oral bioavailability was calculated to be 16%. The log concentration-time curves of the metabolites paralleled those of dilevalol in the terminal section with average terminal half-lives of approx. 5 h. In volunteers the fractions of the dose excreted renally were 0.5% for parent drug, 23% for the glucuronide(s) and 8% for the sulfate. The corresponding values found for the patients were not significantly different.

Mean age was 9 years 9 months (range 3-16 years) and mean bone age was 7 years 6 months (range 2-14 years). Tests were of 9 different types: 1) arginine (n = 625); 2) clonidine (n = 339); 3) insulin (n = 198); 4) ornithine (n = 162); 5) insulin + arginine (n = 203); 6) clonidine + betaxolol (n = 2,003); 7) L-dopa (n = 685); 8) glucagon = propranolol (n = 443); 9) glucagon + betaxolol (n = 815). All growth hormone determinations were performed using the same radioimmunoassay. Distribution of values obtained with each test was gausso-logarithmic. Mean peak levels with their 95% confidence limit were as follows: 1) 10.2 and 0.45; 2) 11.5 and 0.7; 3) 11.8 and 0.8; 4) 14.2 and 1.2; 5) 14.3 and 0.9; 6) 15.7 and 1.1; 7) 19.8 and 2.1; 8) 20.8 and 2.3; 9) 21.0 and 2.5. These data indicate low specificity, with up to two-fold differences in mean peak levels from one test to another; proportions of peaks under 10 ng/ml ranged from 29% to 69%. Thus, the rate of patients diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency may vary substantially according to the test used. To reduce these discrepancies, we suggest adjustment of test results using a weighting coefficient of 1) 1.9; 2) 1.48; 3) 1.4; 4) 1.16; 5) 1.06; 6) 1.01; 7) 0.73; 8) 0.69; 9) 0.66.", 
    "74": "The blood esterase that mediates the metabolism of flestolol, an ultra short-acting beta blocker, was characterized. Esterase activity occurred in plasma of human, dog, rat, and guinea pig and not in erythrocytes of the same species. The esterase activity was greatest in humans and guinea pigs followed by dogs and rats. Purified human serum cholinesterase was very active against flestolol while human serum albumin was slightly active. Human and bovine erythrocyte membrane acetylcholinesterases, electric eel acetylcholinesterase, human hemoglobin, dog, rat, chicken, and bovine serum albumin were all inactive. Esterase activity with flestolol was inhibited in human, dog, and rat blood by echothiophate, eserine, and sodium fluoride. Guinea pig blood esterase activity was inhibited by echothiophate and sodium fluoride, but not by eserine. Metabolic interaction studies indicated that succinylcholine, procaine, and chloroprocaine interfere with the metabolism of flestolol in human blood. Succinylcholine prolonged the in vitro half-life of flestolol in dog blood, but acetylcholine, procaine, and chloroprocaine had no effect. Flestolol did not affect the metabolism of procaine or chloroprocaine in human and dog blood. The metabolism rate of flestolol decreased in individuals with atypical, fluoride-resistant and silent forms of serum cholinesterase.", 
    "75": "An adenosine A1 receptor agonist R-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA) elicited a pronounced negative inotropic effect with the EC50 value of 0.69 mumol/l in the presence of a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent bupranolol (0.3 mumol/l) in the isolated ferret papillary muscle. The negative inotropic effect of R-PIA was not associated with changes in cyclic AMP level. Adenosine and other A1 receptor agonists also elicited a negative inotropic effect. DPCPX (1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentyl xanthine) antagonized the negative inotropic effect of R-PIA in a competitive manner (pA2 value = 8.4). The inhibitory action of R-PIA was markedly attenuated in the ventricular muscle preparation isolated from ferrets pretreated with pertussis toxin that caused ADP-ribosylation of 39 kDa proteins in the membrane fraction. In the membrane fraction derived from the ferret ventricle, [3H]-DPCPX bound to a single binding site in a saturable and reversible manner with high affinity (Kd value = 1.21 +/- 0.41 nmol/l; Bmax = 12.8 +/- 3.02 fmol/mg protein; n = 7). The binding characteristics of [3H]-DPCPX in the rat ventricle (Kd value = 1.51 +/- 0.09 nmol/l; Bmax = 12.7 +/- 1.47 fmol/mg protein; n = 5) were similar to those in the ferret. On the other hand, the content of G(o), a major pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein in the ferret heart, was much higher in the ferret than in the rat ventricle. The present results indicate that adenosine receptors may play an important role in the inhibitory regulation of ventricular contractility in the ferret in contrast to other mammalian species. The signal transduction process subsequent to agonist binding to A1 receptors including the pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein and ion channels may be responsible for the unique inhibitory action of adenosine in this species.", 
    "76": "The effects of a 3-day intramuscular (i.m.) administration of clenbuterol (25 micrograms/Kg), propranolol (12 mg/kg), clenbuterol (25 micrograms/kg) plus propranolol (12 mg/Kg) and estradiol (0.5 microgram) upon the female reproductive system were investigated in immature Sprague-Dawley rats. Clenbuterol and estradiol treatments induced a significant increase in uterus weight and in relative uterus weight, whereas in the groups treated with propranolol and clenbuterol plus propranolol no differences were detected versus controls. The uterine estrogen receptor levels were significantly increased by clenbuterol administration. In the rats dosed with propranolol and clenbuterol plus propranolol, no modifications occurred in estrogen receptor concentrations when compared with control values. Uterine progesterone receptors were never significantly affected by any of the considered treatments. Data obtained indicate that clenbuterol treatment induces an increase in uterus weight and in estrogen receptor levels and that these effects are regulated by acute beta-adrenergic stimulation, as the contemporaneous administration of high doses of a beta-blocker inhibit such effects.", 
    "77": "A new anionic composite bead system with a transient membrane-matrix structure, capable of prolonged constant-rate drug release, has been developed from suspension-polymerized poly(methyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) (PMMA/MAA). These composite beads have a thin PMMA/MAA surface layer and a core consisting of the sodium salt form of the polymer (PMMA/MANa). The high loading (> 20%) of a model drug (oxprenolol HCl) that is achievable in this system from a loading solution concentration as low as 0.5% suggests the formation of a drug-polymer complex in the form of an ionic salt in the core. The release of oxprenolol from such composite beads shows an initial burst effect followed by an extended constant-rate region before leveling off. Apparently, the surface PMMA/MAA layer functions as a transient rate-controlling membrane before it is completely ionized. Because the ionization process is slow, the rate-controlling characteristics of the surface layer and the resulting constant rate of drug release are both sustained for an extended period. The unique feature of the present system is not only its high drug loading capability, but also the transient nature of the rate-controlling surface layer, which is completely ionized towards the latter part of the drug release, thus avoiding prolonged tailing of drug release that is normally associated with permanent membrane-matrix systems.", 
    "78": "Human milk contains numerous factors such as immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, lysozyme, macrophages, etc., which serve an immunoprotective role. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is one of the most proinflammatory agents thus far described. PAF is metabolized to the biologically inactive lysoPAF by the enzyme PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH). In the present study we have demonstrated that PAF-AH activity is present in human milk. The activity was associated with aqueous phase and was not stimulated by the addition of bile salts or Ca2+. The activity of PAF-AH in human milk was not affected by the addition of propranolol or NaCl. PAF, and 1-acyl-2-acetyl-glycerophosphocholine were the only substrates cleaved by the enzyme. Based on these properties it is concluded that the milk PAF-AH is not the lipoprotein or bile salt-stimulated lipase known to be present in milk. Inhibitor studies revealed that the enzyme in human milk was the plasma type PAF-AH. The activity of PAF-AH was stable at pH 4.0 at 37 degrees C and the activity varied in milk samples obtained from various species. The enzyme was secreted by milk macrophages. The presence of PAF-AH in human milk may explain, in part, the beneficial effects of breast feeding in the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis by inactivating the potent proinflammatory autacoid, PAF.",

Primary treatment of SVT attempts to influence the underlying disease.

Antiarrhythmic agents which slow conduction and suppress premature beats are efficient for emergency and long-term treatment of supraventricular tachycardias. We evaluated some of the most relevant antiarrhythmic drugs for SVT including propafenone, diprafenone, cibenzoline, lorcainide and sotalol; in addition, usage and efficacy of quinidine/verapamil, disopyramide, amiodarone, ajmaline, adenosine and flecainide are summarized.

The duration of the QRS (QRSD) and the duration of the terminal low amplitude signal (LASD) was measured from each beat.

Patients with inducible sustained VT (n = 9) showed higher LASD variability than patients without inducible VT (12.3 vs 9.3 ms.beat-1, P < 0.01). Patients with VLP (n = 17), as defined by the signal averaged ECG, also had higher QRSD and LASD variability (11.8 vs 9.5 ms.beat-1, P < 0.05; 11.5 vs 8.2 ms.beat-1, P < 0.01, respectively) compared to those without VLP. All class I drugs lengthened QRSD and LASD in terms of the absolute values, but only propafenone increased QRSD and LASD variability (9.7 to 12.0 ms.beat-1, P < 0.01; 8.9 to 11.9 ms.beat-1, P < 0.01, respectively). In patients with inducible VT, sotalol decrease LASD variability from 14.3 to 9.3 ms.beat-1 (P < 0.05).

    "89": "1. Compound II is a novel analogue of sotalol which has been reported to be free of beta-adrenoceptor and L-type calcium channel blocking actions. The effects of compound II on the contraction of guinea-pig papillary muscles (at 2 microM) and single ventricular myocytes (at 100 nM) were investigated. 2. Exposure to compound II caused a significant increase in the contraction of both preparations. 3. Compound II prolonged the action potential of the single myocytes and increased the magnitude of the Ca-activated current which was used as a qualitative indicator of the intracellular calcium transient. 4. The ratio of first/steady state Ca-activated currents evoked by short action potentials was not modified. This may indicate that compound II does not influence the normal functioning of the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores. 5. The observations are consistent with the hypothesis that action potential prolongation by compound II reduces Ca2+ extrusion via the Na-Ca exchange. This in turn allows increased uptake of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores so that more calcium is available for release by subsequent action potentials, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium transients and contractions.",

The effects of a non-selective P2-receptor agonist ATP and a selective P2x-receptor agonist alpha,beta-methylene-ATP on intracellular free Ca2+ level ([Ca2+]i) and force were examined in rat isolated aorta without endothelium. 2. Both ATP (1-1000 microM) and alpha,beta-methylene-ATP (0.1-100 microM) induced transient increase followed by small sustained increase in [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner. Compared with the force induced by a high concentration of KCl, the force induced by alpha,beta-methylene-ATP was smaller and that induced by ATP was much smaller at a given [Ca2+]i. 3. An L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, verapamil (10 microM), completely inhibited the high K(+)-stimulated [Ca2+]i and force. Verapamil partially inhibited the transient and sustained increases in [Ca2+]i induced by 10 microM alpha,beta-methylene-ATP and the sustained increase but not the transient increase induced by 1 mM ATP. 4.

ATP, but not alpha,beta-methylene-ATP, increased the tissue adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) level. 6. These data suggest that ATP and alpha,beta-methylene-ATP increase [Ca2+]i by an activation of both L-type and non-L-type Ca2+ channels. In addition, ATP, but not alpha,beta-methylene-ATP, increases [Ca2+]i by a release of Ca2+ from an intracellular Ca2+ store.

Norepinephrine and insulin independently stimulated glucose transport in L-LA, O-LA, and L-SHR brown adipocytes, but their stimulatory effects were markedly reduced in O-SHR cells. Both insulin responsiveness and the total number of insulin receptors were significantly decreased in O-SHR adipocytes but not in O-LA cells. The number of high-affinity beta 1/beta 2-adrenoceptors was significantly increased (+70%) in O-LA adipocytes but was similar in L-SHR and O-SHR cells. These results indicate that 1) major metabolic defects are present in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of O-SHR but not of O-LA, although these two strains are homozygous for the cp allele, 2) postreceptor defects are predominantly involved in O-SHR adipocyte refractoriness to norepinephrine, and 3) a reduced mitochondrial content may represent the principal metabolic alteration explaining the decreased effects of norepinephrine on both thermogenesis and glucose transport. It is postulated that the marked insulin resistance of O-SHR leads to a decreased mitochondriogenesis in BAT, resulting in a diminished tissue thermogenic capacity and reduced glucose metabolism, thereby contributing to obesity and diabetes.", 
    "99": "The present study investigated the hypothesis that the increase in plasma angiotensinogen after nephrectomy is mediated by endogenous renin and angiotensin (ANG) II. Rats were divided into control, nephrectomy, or nephrectomy plus adrenalectomy groups. In addition, similar cohorts were divided as just mentioned and then given either atenolol (selective beta 1-adrenoceptor inhibitor that prevents renin release) or Dup-753 [ANG II (AT1) receptor antagonist]. The plasma angiotensinogen levels increase approximately fivefold after 24 h in nephrectomized rats. Pretreatment with atenolol blunted this increase. A significant reduction was observed 4 h (P < 0.05) and 8 h (P < 0.005) after surgery. Dup-753 nearly abolished the increase in angiotensinogen plasma levels. After pretreatment with Dup-753, significantly higher angiotensinogen levels (P < 0.005) were found only after 24 h. Nephrectomy plus adrenalectomy also blunted the rise in plasma angiotensinogen. A significant increase in angiotensinogen plasma levels could only be observed after 8 h (P < 0.005) and 12 h (P < 0.005) but not after 24 h. Atenolol further reduced this increase. After atenolol pretreatment, significantly higher angiotensinogen levels could only be observed after 12 h (P < 0.05). Dup-753 completely abolished the increase of plasma angiotensinogen after nephrectomy plus adrenalectomy. In anesthetized control rats at time 0 the plasma ANG I levels were 0.7 nM. Pretreatment with atenolol decreased the ANG I values by 30%, whereas Dup-753 caused a sixfold increase in plasma ANG I levels in the control rats at time 0.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "101": "Our study is prompted by the arrival of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in connection with the evolution of postoperative ileus (PI) and by its avoidance of the intraabdominal handling implied in conventional cholecystectomy. With this aim a prospective, controlled, randomized, and blind clinical trial was designed using 100 patients divided into five groups (n = 20): I, conventional cholecystectomy (CC): II, CC+injection of 20 ml bupivacaine 0.5% into the mesentery root; III, CC + 7.5 mg propranolol i.v. and 0.5 mg neostigmine s.c., postoperatively until the first defecation; IV, II+III; and V, laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The shortest period of PI was observed in group V. This period increases notably in group IV (53 h), group II (72 h), and group III (84 h) relative to the control group with (89 h). This reduction in PI time runs parallel with an improvement in the patient's general state of well-being. We concluded that after laparoscopic cholecystectomy PI is nonexistent. Furthermore, this study confirms the correlation between the avoidance of intraabdominal manipulation and the evolution of postoperative ileus.",

The overall weighted average blood pressure reduction was 13/6 mm Hg. The pooled odds ratio was 0.61 (95% confidence interval: 0.55, 0.68), indicating approximately a 39% (32 to 45%) reduction in stroke occurrence. Percent reduction was somewhat higher in studies of mild-moderate hypertension (47%) and somewhat lower in studies of the elderly (35%). There was no differential effect by gender (reductions of 37% for women, 34% for men) or by race (32% for blacks, 37% for whites). The magnitudes of reductions for fatal (41%) and nonfatal (37%) strokes, and for diuretics and beta-blockers (odds ratio diuretic versus beta-blocker, 0.86; 95% CI: 0.69, 1.08) were similar. Implications for the decline in stroke mortality in the United States are discussed.", 
    "103": "The mode of action of prostaglandin E2 was investigated on the rat femoral arterial vascular bed in vivo and on the isolated femoral artery in vitro. In in vivo preparations, prostaglandin E2 (0.01-0.3 microgram), as well as acetylcholine (0.01-0.3 microgram) and nicardipine (0.1-3 micrograms), administered into the femoral artery (i.a.), elicited a dose-dependent increase (vasodilatation) in femoral blood flow, without markedly influencing systemic blood pressure or heart rate. The vasodilator response to prostaglandin E2 was not affected by i.v. pretreatment with atropine (0.5 mg/kg), propranolol (0.5 mg/kg), glibenclamide (20 mg/kg) or NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (100 mg/kg), whereas it was significantly attenuated, like that to acetylcholine, by i.a. infusion of methylene blue. However, methylene blue did not affect the vasodilator response to nicardipine even at a dose sufficient to attenuate the responses to prostaglandin E2 and acetylcholine. In isolated femoral arterial strips, prostaglandin E2 (3 x 10(-8) - 3 x 10(-4) M), phenylephrine (3 x 10(-8) - 1 x 10(-4) M) and U46619 (1 x 10(-9) - 1 x 10(-6) M) induced a concentration-dependent vasoconstriction. The vasoconstrictor responses to prostaglandin E2 and phenylephrine were significantly potentiated by removal of the endothelium and by the presence of methylene blue (3 microM) or NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (100 microM), whereas those to U46619 remained unaffected in the same conditions. The present results indicate that the endothelium may play a role in the vascular response to prostaglandin E2.",

Both drugs caused a significant decrease in maximum (propranolol, P = 0.002; isosorbide-5-mononitrate, P = 0.021). Four patients responded to propranolol, three to isosorbide-5-mononitrate, and eight to both drugs; three did not show any change.

    "105": "1. beta-Adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation of rat oesophageal smooth muscle was investigated by studying the effects of beta 1- and beta 2-selective antagonists on the relaxation induced by (-)-isoprenaline, the beta 2-selective agonists fenoterol and clenbuterol and the beta 3-agonist, BRL 37344. 2. The highly beta 1-selective antagonist CGP 20721A did not antagonize (-)-isoprenaline- or BRL 37344-induced relaxations in concentrations up to 10 microM. Only at 100 microM of CGP 20712A were clear rightward shifts of the agonist concentration-response curves (CRCs) observed, with pA2 values of 4.70 and 4.97 against (-)-isoprenaline and BRL 37344, respectively. 3. ICI 118,551, a potent and selective beta 2-antagonist, at 100 nM caused moderate rightward shifts of the CRCs of (-)-isoprenaline, fenoterol and clenbuterol; with fenoterol and clenbuterol, this was accompanied by a clear steepening of the curve. Only at the highest concentration (100 microM ICI 118,551) did the shifts to the right further increase substantially. Resulting Schild-plots were clearly biphasic. BRL 37344-induced relaxations were only antagonized at 100 microM ICI 118,551, yielding a pA2 value of 5.48. 4. These results clearly demonstrate that the BRL 37344-induced relaxation of rat oesophageal muscularis mucosae is mediated solely through beta 3-adrenoceptors, whereas (-)-isoprenaline-, fenoterol- and clenbuterol-induced relaxations were shown to involve both beta 2- and, predominantly, beta 3-adrenoceptors.", 
    "106": "1. The pharmacological and electrophysiological effect of 2-phenyl-4-oxo-hydroquinoline (YT-1), a new synthetic agent, were determined in rat isolated cardiac tissues and ventricular myocytes. 2. YT-1 was found to have a positive inotropic effect in both atria and ventricular muscles but did not cause significant increases in the spontaneously beating rate of right atria. 3. The positive inotropic effect of YT-1 was antagonized neither by beta-nor by alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists but was partially antagonized by a Ca2+ channel blocker (verapamil) and a K+ channel blocker (4-AP). 4. The action potential duration and amplitude of ventricular cells were progressively increased as the concentration of YT-1 was increased from 3 to 30 microM. 5. A voltage clamp study revealed that the prolongation of action potential duration by YT-1 was associated with a prominent inhibition of 4-AP-sensitive transient outward current (I(to)). At potentials negative to the reversal potential of K1-channels, the inward current through these channels was partially reduced by YT-1. At potentials positive to the reversal potential, the outward current through these channels was affected very little. 6. Although YT-1 blocked the amplitude of I(to), the voltage-dependence of the steady-state inactivation of I(to), was unaffected. 7. Apart from the inhibition of K+ currents, YT-1 also inhibited the sodium inward current. 8. The evidence suggests that YT-1 increases the slow inward Ca2+ current (ICa) significantly. 9. It is concluded that the positive inotropic effect of YT-1 is due predominantly to the increase of ICa and inhibition of I(to).", 
    "107": "1. Acute psychological stress, which could be related to the release of a large amount of catecholamines, may cause oesophageal motility disorders. Therefore, the aim of our study was to elucidate the influence of adrenoceptor agonists on the striated muscle portion of the oesophagus by use of isolated strips from dogs. 2. Contractions were evoked in isolated striated muscle strips by electrical field stimulation (1 pulse min-1, 1 ms/pulse, submaximal voltage). The effects induced by administration of adrenoceptor agonists alone or in the presence of antagonists were tested to determine the nature of the adrenoceptors on this muscle preparation. 3. The administration of both the natural adrenoceptor agonists, adrenaline and noradrenaline, and the synthetic beta-adrenoceptor agonists, isoprenaline (beta 1 + beta 2), dobutamine (beta 1) or ritodrine (beta 2), enhanced the amplitude of the contractions induced by electrical stimulation in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximum responses were 82.6 (adrenaline), 66.2 (noradrenaline), 86.2 (isoprenaline), 34.6 (dobutamine) and 80.8% (ritodrine). The EC20 values obtained were respectively 2 nM, 0.2 microM, 0.91 nM, 3 microM and 80 nM. The administration of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine, also enhanced the contractile response in a concentration-dependent manner (EC20 value = 0.3 microM) and the maximum response was 64.6%, but the administration of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, did not influence the contractile response. These data suggest the involvement of beta 2- and possibly alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the responses of these adrenoceptor agonists. 4 The selective P2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551 (3-100nM) shifted the concentration-effect curves for noradrenaline, phenylephrine and ritodrine to the right in a concentration-dependent manner.ICI 118551 (3 nM) also shifted the concentration-effect curves for adrenaline and isoprenaline to the right, but increasing the concentration of ICI 118551 did not cause any further antagonist activity until a concentration of 100 nM, when a further rightward shift was obtained.5. The selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (30-300 nM), did not affect the increased contractile responses induced by adrenaline, noradrenaline, phenylephrine, isoprenaline or ritodrine.6. In conclusion, it appears that beta2-adrenoceptors are present in the striated muscle portion of the canine oesophagus, where they mediate an enhancement of contractile responses evoked by electrical stimulation. The alpha l-agonist, phenylephrine, appears to interact with beta2-adrenoceptors on this preparation.beta 3-Adrenoceptors have already been demonstrated in smooth muscle from various parts of the gastrointestinal tract, and our study does not exclude the possibility that there is an additional population of beta 3-receptors in the canine striated muscle part of the oesophagus.", 
    "108": "1. Sympathetic neurones derived from superior cervical ganglia of neonatal rats and maintained in tissue culture were used to investigate the modulation of neurotransmitter release by presynaptic receptors. Three week old cultures of neurones were loaded with [3H]-noradrenaline to label endogenous neurotransmitter stores. Release of noradrenaline was evoked by depolarization with raised extracellular K+ in the presence of desipramine and corticosterone to prevent uptake of released catecholamine. 2. Potassium (55 mmol l-1) depolarization for 30 s caused more than a four fold increase in 3H overflow from basal levels but this increase was reduced by up to 40% in the presence of exogenous noradrenaline (1 mumol l-1). The inhibition by noradrenaline of depolarization-evoked overflow was blocked by the alpha 1/alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine. Phentolamine alone did not increase K(+)-evoked 3H overflow. 3. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, produced a concentration-dependent block of the inhibition by noradrenaline of K(+)-evoked overflow, while the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, was without effect at concentrations up to 0.1 mumol l-1. 4. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, neither reduced K(+)-evoked overflow nor increased the degree of inhibition caused by the addition of 1 mumol l-1 noradrenaline. 5. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (1 mumol l-1) was less effective than noradrenaline at inhibiting K(+)-evoked overflow, while the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine (1 mumol l-1) had no significant effect. 6. The L-channel calcium blocker, nicardipine (1 mumol l-1) significantly inhibited 3H overflow evoked by K+. In the presence of L-channel block, however, noradrenaline still inhibited residual evoked overflow.7. In the presence or absence of nicardipine, pertussis toxin pretreatment (1 nmol 1-1) reduced, but did not prevent, the effect of noradrenaline (1 micromol 1-1). Pertussis toxin alone caused a significant enhancement of K+-evoked 3H overflow.8. The data indicate that on postganglionic neurones of cultured rat sympathetic ganglia there are alpha 2-adrenoceptors that modulate neurotransmitter release, but no functional beta-adrenoceptors that mediate an enhancement of transmitter release. The data suggest further that in this preparation the mechanism of alpha2-adrenoceptor modulation may involve pertussis toxin sensitive and insensitive G-proteins and effects on calcium channels other than L-type.", 
    "109": "The haemodynamic effects of nipradilol, a new non-selective beta-adrenoreceptor blocker with vasodilating actions like nitroglycerin, were examined in rats with portal hypertension due to portal vein stenosis. Portal hypertensive rats were divided into five groups receiving infusion of placebo, 3 mg of propranolol, 300, 600 and 1200 micrograms of nipradilol. At its highest dose, nipradilol achieved a reduction of 34.4 +/- 4.4% in heart rate which was similar to that in the propranolol group (36.5 +/- 2.4%). Also for other systemic haemodynamic parameters, the nipradilol 1200 micrograms group exhibited changes not significantly different from those in the propranolol group; mean arterial pressure (-13 vs -14%), cardiac index (-37 vs -31%) and systemic vascular resistance (+29 vs +32%). In contrast to the similar changes in the systemic circulation, a 1200 micrograms dose of nipradilol lowered portal pressure significantly more than propranolol (-4.3 +/- 0.6 vs -2.9 +/- 0.2 mmHg, P < 0.05). Nipradilol then reduced portal blood flow by 22% (P < 0.05) without a significant change in portocollateral resistance. On the other hand, propranolol not only caused a reduction in portal blood flow of 30% (P < 0.01), but also an increase in portocollateral resistance of 21% (P < 0.05). The results suggest that nipradilol may ensure a more effective control of portal hypertension than propranolol, presumably via its venodilatory action on portocollateral vessels.", 
    "110": "We examined factors mediating a 70% increase in arterial blood pressure that occurs during feeding in newborn lambs. We report that the increase in blood pressure during feeding was significantly reduced (to approximately 50%) and delayed in onset by combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade. Plasma angiotensin and vasopressin levels did not increase significantly during feeding, nor was the pressor response to feeding attenuated while using captopril to block the production of angiotensin II. Adrenalectomy or muscarinic cholinergic blockade with atropine was also unsuccessful in attenuating the pressor response to feeding. We demonstrated that the component of the pressor response to feeding that was insensitive to alpha, beta, and muscarinic blockade was mediated by the autonomic nervous system because it was completely eliminated by ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium. Thus nonadrenergic noncholinergic autonomic mechanisms mediate approximately half the pressor response to feeding in lambs.", 
    "111": "The chronotropic response to bradykinin (BK) injected into the sinus node artery was evaluated in anesthetized dogs. The animals (n = 14) were vagotomized and pretreated with propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) to prevent baroreceptor-mediated effects. Dose-dependent decreases in heart rate (from 2.4 +/- 1.3% for 1 microgram of BK to 13.1 +/- 3.7% for 10 micrograms of BK), as well as a significant fall in systemic systolic and diastolic blood pressures, were observed. Captopril (2 mg/kg i.v.) caused significant decreases in systolic (from 117 +/- 11 to 77 +/- 12 mmHg, P < 0.001) and diastolic (from 87 +/- 8 to 52 +/- 8 mmHg, P < 0.001) blood pressures but had no effect on heart rate. Converting-enzyme inhibition potentiated the BK-induced bradycardia. The new potent B2-receptor antagonist, HOE 140 (100 micrograms), significantly blocked the BK-induced chronotropic effect, whereas desArg9-BK, a B1-receptor agonist, was without effect. Prostaglandin involvement was excluded, since pretreatment with indomethacin did not prevent the bradycardia. In conclusion, in vivo BK induces a direct negative chronotropic effect, which is potentiated by converting-enzyme inhibition and is mediated by the B2-receptors independently of the prostaglandins.", 
    "112": "The effect of propranolol on the process of thyroid hormone formation was studied in a physiological culture system. Porcine thyroid follicles were preincubated with propranolol for 24 h. Iodide transport, iodine organification, and de novo thyroid hormone formation were measured by incubating these follicles with the mixture of carrier-free 0.1 microCi Na125I and 50 nM NaI for 2 to 6 h at 37 degrees C. A concentration of propranolol greater than 100 microM inhibited iodide transport in a dose-dependent manner; this inhibition was non-competitive with iodide and independent of thyrotropin (TSH). Reduced iodine organification and thyroid hormone formation was seen with 150 microM propranolol or greater. The inhibitory action of propranolol was not caused by beta-blocking activity, since D-propranolol (devoid of beta-blocking activity) inhibited iodide transport, and other beta-blockers (metoprolol, atenolol, and labetalol) did not inhibit iodide transport. The inhibition of iodide transport was most likely caused by membrane stabilizing activity since quinidine, which possesses the same membrane stabilizing activity as propranolol, also inhibited iodide transport. TSH-mediated cAMP generation and Na+K+ ATPase activity, membrane functions for iodide transport, were unaffected by propranolol. Our study has shown, for the first time, that propranolol has a direct antithyroid action, namely inhibition of iodide transport in the intact thyroid follicle.",

ISO alone increased operant responding for exogenous heat but decreased body temperature and increased net heat loss. These effects of ISO were blocked by erythro-dl-1-(7-methylinden-4-yloxy)3-isopropylamino-2-ol in a dose-dependent manner, whereas atenolol at the highest dose tested (2 mg/kg) exacerbated the effects of ISO. The beta 3 agonist, (R*,R*-(+/-)-methyl 4-[2-[2-hydroxy-2-(3-chlorophenyl)ethylamino]propylphenoxyacetate hydrobromide, reduced operant responding for heat and net heat loss in the cold; these effects were sustained in the presence of both beta 1 and beta 2 antagonists. The beta 2 adrenoceptor agonist, fenoterol, produced a dose-dependent increase in operant behavior but colonic temperature fell and thermal balance reflected the characteristic effects of a thermolytic agent. The beta 1 agonist, prenalterol, had no apparent effect on thermoregulatory behavior, colonic temperature or thermal balance but it blocked the thermolytic effects of fenoterol when both agonists were coadministered. Fenoterol had no significant effect on metabolic rate or colonic temperature when tested in a warm ambient temperature of 23 degrees C but it decreased colonic temperature without a significant effect on metabolic rate at an ambient temperature of 5 degrees C, suggesting an effect on heat loss mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We investigated the cardiovascular and myocardial metabolic effects of a T1-T12 epidural block in 18 patients (age < 65 yr, ejection fraction > 0.5), receiving chronic beta-adrenergic blocker medication and scheduled for aortocoronary bypass surgery. After randomization into a light or deeper general anesthetic group, the cardiovascular and myocardial metabolic effects of a subsequent general anesthesia induction were investigated. Thoracic epidural analgesia induced a moderate decrease in mean arterial pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, free fatty acids, and myocardial consumption of free fatty acids. General anesthesia with thiopental (2-4 mg/kg) and a low fentanyl dose (5 micrograms/kg) increased heart rate, coronary perfusion pressure, and coronary vascular resistance, whereas mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased. After thiopental (2-4 mg/kg) and a high fentanyl dose (30 micrograms/kg), mean arterial pressure and left ventricular stroke work index decreased. We conclude that a T1-T12 epidural block in well sedated, beta-adrenergic blocked patients does not induce clinically significant cardiovascular effects. Induction of general anesthesia was well tolerated, but the light general anesthetic could not prevent an increase in heart rate and coronary vascular resistance, whereas the deeper anesthetic induced slight myocardial depression. No effect on the atrioventricular conduction, as measured by the PQ-time, was noted.",

Concentration-response curves to (-)-epinephrine were constructed in the presence and absence of selective antagonists for beta 1 AR (CGP 20712A) and beta 2 AR (ICI 118,551). Responses to (-)-epinephrine were antagonized to a variable degree by the blockers, suggesting heterogeneous contribution of beta 1AR and beta 2AR among cells. The most common response in single myocytes was that ICI 118,551 (50 nmol/L) shifted the concentration-response curve less than 10-fold: this was lower than the 100-fold shift expected for a pure beta 2AR effect. Inclusion of CGP 20712A (300 nmol/L) with ICI 118,551 shifted the (-)-epinephrine curve still further. These observations suggest that both beta 1AR and beta 2AR contribute to the increase in contraction amplitude with (-)-epinephrine in this group of myocytes. When 300 nmol/L CGP 20712A was present as the sole antagonist, only a marginal shift of the concentration-response curve for (-)-epinephrine was usually observed, indicating that beta 1AR were not mediating the effect of these low concentrations of (-)-epinephrine.

Studies from other countries discovered insulin resistance; in people with essential hypertension in was also associated with obesity, however, insulin resistance was found in lean people too. In obesity, insulin resistance occurs secondarily to many physiopathological states and circulating factors which adversely affects insulin action. The metabolic abnormality in this action was mainly found in relation to abdominal fat; in other cases, insulin resistance was found to be inherited. Hyperinsulinaemia can actually increase blood pressure and is associated with venous and arterial thrombosis and it also rises lipid levels. It is interesting too that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia are associated with impaired fibrinolysis through high levels of fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor of endothelial type and in identifying individuals prone to myocardial infarction. Some antihypertensive drugs like beta-blockers, methyl-dopa and diuretics increase insulin resistance, while angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors have not shown any adverse metabolic affects. Alfa-1-blocker were beneficial and alfa-2-agonists were neutral, whereas calcium channel-antagonists are still in controversy. Treatment should be designed to improve the metabolic state; physical exercise, a diet rich in fruit, vegetable and rott vegetables, the reduction of abdominal fat and, finally, the use of antihypertensive drugs which decrease insulin resistance would be expected to reverse hyperinsulinaemia.

    "130": "The present study was designed to investigate the role of the autonomic nervous system in experimental hypertension induced by chronic administration of N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) in the drinking water (1 mg/mL) over 6 days. L-NAME ingestion caused a large rise in resting mean arterial pressure (MAP) (175 +/- 5 mm Hg) and heart rate (HR) (440 +/- 17 beats per minute) compared to nontreated control rats (resting MAP: 112 +/- 2 mm Hg and HR: 345 +/- 8 beats per minute). Ganglionic blockade induced by trimethaphan (5 mg/kg, intravenously) caused a significantly (P < .01) greater decrease in MAP (delta -86 +/- 7 mm Hg) compared to control rats MAP (delta -44 +/- 4 mm Hg). This strongly suggests that the level of central sympathetic tone in L-NAME-treated rats is much greater than in nontreated rats. Using atenolol and atropine alone and combined, the level of resting sympathetic drive to the heart was found to be significantly increased in L-NAME-treated rats compared to control rats. However, vagal tone to the heart was found to be virtually abolished in L-NAME-treated rats compared to control rats. These results indicate that an increase in central sympathetic drive plays an important role in the hypertension induced by chronic inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis with L-NAME.", 
    "131": "Twenty healthy nonsmokers, 20 asymptomatic mild smokers and 20 asymptomatic moderate smokers were assessed for ventilatory functions, before and after equipotent dosages of atenolol, propranolol and oxprenolol in a single blind longitudinal study. The basal spirometric values were significantly lower in smokers than non smokers. After propranolol significant reduction was seen from basal values in FEV1, FEF 75%, MMFR, FEF 200-1200 in all the three groups. After oxprenolol significant difference was seen only with MMFR in the moderate smokers. With atenolol the variation was not significant in any group. Intercomparison of values after the drugs in each group was done. The values after propranolol was significantly lower than values after atenolol or oxprenolol for FEF 75%, MMFR and FEF 200-1200 in both the smoker groups whereas values after oxprenolol and Atenolol did not differ significantly from each other. Thus, in smokers atenolol offers a safe choice. If propranolol is to be used, the possibility of significant bronchospasm should be considered.", 
    "132": "The aim of the study was to determine whether tachycardia which is associated with the use of beta 2-sympathomimetic tocolytic agents is caused by baroreflex activation or by direct stimulation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors. In conscious male rats, tachycardiac responses following intravenous injection of hexoprenaline, ritodrine and fenoterol were compared following (i) bilateral sinoaortic denervation (SAD) or (ii) sham-operation, and (iii) ganglionic-blockade using hexamethonium. Dose-ranges were chosen to result in similar reductions in diastolic blood pressure (DAP). Furthermore, following ganglionic blockade, the relative contribution of beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulation was assessed using the selective beta 2-receptor antagonist ICI 118,551. In intact rats, increases in HR induced by all beta-adrenoceptor agonist were comparable. In SAD and ganglion-blocked rats, DAP fell more pronounced at even lower doses. The corresponding increases in HR were approximately 3 times smaller than in intact rats but not different between agents. During ganglionic blockade ICI 118,551 significantly inhibited HR responses to fenoterol and hexoprenaline but not ritodrine. The conclusion is that in intact male rats, baroreflex activation is the major determinant of tachycardia following injection of ritodrine, fenoterol or hexoprenaline. Increasing the beta 2-selectivity of these drugs will not limit the tachycardic effects.", 
    "133": "Self-injurious behavior (SIB) is a serious and moderately prevalent problem behavior among developmentally disabled persons, and it frequently leads to treatment with psychotropic medication. The empirical literature relating to the efficacy of pharmacological intervention is comprehensively reviewed. The rationales for using some \"newer\" agents, such as serotonin reuptake blockers, opiate blockers, and beta-adrenergic blockers are described. In general there are insufficient data to draw conclusions about specific agents. Evidence for a possible role in managing SIB is strongest for thioridazine, lithium carbonate, and the opiate antagonists. However, further research is needed to define the specific indications, if any, for each of these. Impediments to past research are discussed, possible refinements are offered for future research, and recommendations for treatment are offered.", 
    "134": "Turpentine oil treatment (0.2 mL kg-1, s.c.) was used to increase the plasma concentration of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (0.13 mg mL-1 in control rats) to 1.72 mg mL-1 after 2 days, and allow assessment of its effects on the pharmacokinetics and stereoselective binding of three beta-blockers. Racemates (5 mg kg-1) were administered intravenously to control and turpentine oil-pretreated rats and the plasma concentrations were determined up to 90 min. Stereoselective analysis showed the apparent distribution volume and the area under plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) of R-(+)-propranolol to be, respectively, one-quarter and twice those of the S-(-)-enantiomer and differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between the two were magnified by turpentine oil pretreatment. Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxprenolol enantiomers were essentially similar for the controls but after turpentine oil pretreatment, a higher affinity of the R-(+)-enantiomer for plasma was observed. Acebutolol enantiomers behaved non-stereospecifically throughout. These results were consistent with predictions from the in-vitro stereospecific binding properties of these agents to purified rat alpha 1-acid glycoprotein."
