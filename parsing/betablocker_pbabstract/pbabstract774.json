    "0": "1. The human isolated basilar artery has been used as a model to investigate the aetiology of cerebral arterial spasm associated with rupture of intracranial aneurysms. 2. The isolated artery is contracted by 5-hydroxytryptamine, noradrenaline, six prostaglandins and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with ruptured aneurysms and cerebral arterial spasm. 3. These contractions are reversed by (+/-)--, (+)-- and (--)-propranolol in concentrations known to produce local anaesthetic effects on isolated frog sciatic nerve; the (+) isomer was 2.5 to 10 times more potent (-)-propranolol in antagonising all contractions. 4. As the two isomers are known to have similar local anaesthetic potency but (-)-propranolol has greater beta-adrenoreceptor blocking effects we conclude that the antagonistic effects described do not involve beta-adrenoreceptor blockade. 5. The data indicate that propranolol may be of clinical use in reversing cerebral arterial spasm.", 
    "1": "1. The acute haemodynamic effects of metoprolol (0.15 mg/kg body weight) intravenously were studied at rest and during exercise, in a recumbent position in five patients with arterial hypertension of WHO Stage 1 or 2. 2. Significant decreases in heart rate, cardiac output and arterial blood pressures, both at rest and during exercise, were seen. There were no changes in the calculated stroke volume or systemic vascular resistance. 3. The apparent absence of any relative preponderance of the alpha-adrenoreceptors after acute beta-adrenoreceptor blockade with metoprolol warrants further studies on metoprolol in arterial hypertension.", 
    "2": "1. Oral labeltalol and propranolol have been compared in healthy men with regard to the effects on heart rate, blood pressure and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at rest and the changes induced by exercise. 2. Labetalol caused a dose-related reduction in standing diastolic pressure at rest whereas propranolol did not but neither drug altered standing systolic pressure at rest. 3. In the doses compared, propranolol was consistently more potent than labetalol in influencing blood pressure changes induced by exercise, in lowering heart rate at rest and reducing PEFR at rest. 4. Labetalol and propranolol are both beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists and the observed differences in the profiles of the two drugs are probably directly related to the additional alpha-adrenoreceptor blocking property of labetalol not possessed by propranolol. Because of these differences labetalol may be expected to have advantages in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "3": "The role of the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN) in central cardiovascular regulation was investigated in cats. In 15 cerebellectomized and nine intact chloralosed cats stimulation of 115 histologically verified sites in the LRN elicited increases in arterial pressure and heart rate; the latter was abolished by propranolol but not by bilateral cervical vagotomy. The pressor response was significantly greater in intact animals. Electrical activity was recorded from the right inferior cardiac nerve (ICN) during stimulation fo the LRN and of a vasomotor region in the posteromedial hypothalamus (PMH). Stimulation of sites in the LRN and in the PMH, on both sides, elicited a response in the right ICN that was consistently abolished during baroreceptor excitation. Medullary transection 3 mm rostral to the LRN did not abolish the ICN response to LRN stimulation. The conclusions are drawn that stimulation of the LRN elicits cardiovascular responses probably due to excitation of groups of neurons in this nucleus located in a descending sympathetic pathway originating in the PMH and that these responses can be inhibited by excitation of baroreceptors. In view of the known functional connections of the LRN with the somatomotor system it is suggested that this nucleus may play a major role in somatosympathetic reflexes.", 
    "4": "The influence of five most common antiarrhythmic drugs on exercise-electrocadiogram was investigated: prajmaliumbitartrat, quinidinbisulfate, diphenylhydantoine, propranolol, and verapamil. All exercise-tests were performed in eight healthy males. During exercise and the subsequent resting period, the changes in the following parameters were analysed: blood pressure, heart rate, P-Q-time, Q-T-time, and the formal course of the Ecg as well as individual reactions. None of the drugs produced a pathological ECG. As for the analysed parameters, diphenylhydantoine was entirely neutral, whereas propranolol caused the most significant changes. Propranolol lowered heart rate by more than 20% and blood pressure by 10%. Verapamil had a less pronounced effect on diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. Prajmaliumbitartrat and quinidine had no definite effect during exercise and resting period.", 
    "5": "Two children with exercise-induced syncopes are described. There was no evidence for congenital or acquired cardiac defects, cardiomyopathy or myocarditis in either of them. Both had sinus bradycardia and a consistently normal QT-interval at rest. In both, exercise induced regularly a multiform ventricular tachycardia, additionally in one on occasion a bidirectional, in the other a supraventricular tachycardia. Beta receptor blocking agents prevented tachyarrhythmias in both. Under treatment with beta receptor blocking agents, one child remained without syncopes, the other died suddenly. These cases underline the possiblility that exercise-induced syncopes may be caused by tachyarrhythmias even if the QT-interval of the resting Ecg is normal. In suspicious cases an exercise-Ecg is indicated.", 
    "6": "The renal effects of dopamine were studied using clearance and micropuncture techniques in rats. Intravenous infusion of dopamine (4.7 - 10(-6) mol - kg-1 - h-1) increased glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow. Renal blood flow was measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter. The increase in filtered fluid and sodium was nearly completely matched by increased tubular reabsorption. Thus, only a small rise in urine flow and in urinary sodium excretion was observed. The micropuncture experiments using the split oil droplet method of Gertz demonstrated a stimulation of the transepithelial fluid transfer after injection of dopamine (10(-4) M) into the proximal tubular lumen. This effect was abolished by simultaneous injection of propranolol (10(-3) M) which, by its own, did not affect transtubular volume fluxes. It is concluded that dopamine, by stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors, may increase reabsorptive capacity of the proximal tubular epithelium independent of changes in renal hemodynamics.", 
    "7": "An unexpected inhibition of human platelet aggregation by dopamine -- the precursor of epinephrine and norepinephrine -- is presented. Human platelet-rich plasma was incubated in an aggregometer for 120 seconds at 37 degrees C, with either dopamine or saline control. Adenosine diphosphate, epinephrine or collagen was added as the aggregating agent. Dopamine inhibits induction of platelet aggregation by all three agents and causes platelet disaggregation. At low doses (400 mug/ml or less), dopamine induces platelet aggregation and enhances ADP-induced aggregation. In addition, a concentration of dopamine of 40 mug/ml induces aggregation, enhances ADP-induced aggregation and inhibits epinephrine aggregation. Phentolamine is able to block dopamine enhancement of ADP aggregation, but propranolol and haloperidol fail to prevent dopamine inhibition of epinephrine aggregation. These observations are explained neither by the currently known intracellular actions of dopamine which involve competition with serotonin nor by a single mediator such as cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate. It appears that dopamine may exert its effects via the platelet membrane.", 
    "8": "The effect of sustained beta-adrenergic blockade (BB) on the hemodynamic response to graded exercise has been studied in 31 patients with high blood pressure. Hemodynamic investigations were conducted during a control period and were repeated after 1 mo of BB. Similar readjustments were observed at rest and during submaximal and maximal exercise. No significant change occurred in maximal physical working capacity during beta blockade. This resulted from hemodynamic readjustments. Maximal exercise heart rate was reduced by 34%, and this was compensated for by a 31% enhancement in stroke index. Consequently cardiac index decreased by only 14%. In the Fick equation the decrease in cardiac index was further compensated by an increase of the total arteriovenous O2 difference of 8%, thereby maintaining O2 delivery to the tissues. At maximal exercise mean brachial artery pressure dropped 14.5%, while mean pulmonary artery pressure increased by 20%. It is concluded that the compensatory action of the stroke volume, resulting from the interaction of an increased preload and a decreased impedance, played a major role in the hemodynamic readjustments following chronic BB to maintain maximal working capacity.", 
    "9": "In eight dogs, cellotomy, rubbing the small bowel, and exposing it to air suppressed the migrating bursts of action potentials and contractions that occur in the gastrointestinal tract during fasting and greatly slowed (one to three days) the gastrointestinal transit of 7-mm plastic spheres. The operation also caused a transient one-day increase in the concentration of epinephrine and a more prolonged five-day increase in the concentration and norepinephrine in arterial and venous plasma. Phentolamine mesylate and propranolol hydrochloride prevented the inhibition of the bursts of gastric action potentials brought about by operation, but these drugs did not alter the inhibition of the small intestinal action potentials or the speed of gastrointestinal transit of spheres.", 
    "10": "A family had an unusual and perhaps unique familial dysrhythmia. The proband had a short PR interval with normal QRS and chronic recurrent paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome). The arrhythmia produced left ventricular dysfunction. Both paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (PAT) and left ventricular dysfunction were reversed with administration of digoxin and propranolol hydrochloride. Three family members had paroxysmal or chronic atrial fibrillation, first diagnosed at a relatively young age (23 years, 38 years, and early 40s, respectively). Five additional family members had short PR intervals with normal QRS, and eight other family members had borderline short PR intervals. The mode of inheritance appeared to be autosomal dominant with varying expressivity. We have described a familial syndrome characterized by PAT or atrial fibrillation in its advanced form with short PR interval as a possible identifying trait. The future course of members with isolated short PR is unknown.", 
    "11": "Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) was observed in 41 patients, 35 of whom were in acute respiratory distress. A hospital mortality of 37% reflected the seriousness of their underlying conditions. In no patient was the arrhythmia the primary cause of death. The MAT preceded and/or followed atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (Af) in 19 patients (46%). The MAT simulated AF in several cases in which P-waves were inconspicuous. Our cases suggest that MAT is not a manifestation of digitalis intoxication. Quinidine sulfate, procainamide hydrochloride, lidocaine, and phenytoin (diphenythydantoin) did not affect the rhythm. Digitalis was usually not effective in slowing the ventricular response in patients with MAT. Propranolol hydrochloride was given to seven patients and was effective in slowing the atrial rate in all cases. An attempt at electrocardioversion was unsuccessful in one patient.", 
    "12": "A case of sustained hypertension produced by unilateral section of the glossopharyngeal nerve is reported. Special tests revealed baroreceptor dysfunction. The hypertension was responsive to propranolol therapy. Review of the literature revealed no other documented cases of sustained hypertension although transient hypertension is common.", 
    "13": "Propranolol was given to five patients with severe hemolytic anemia from arotic prostheses. Red cell survival, lactic dehydrogenase, serum hemoglobin, and 24 hour urine iron values were used to evaluate the severity of hemolysis with and without propranolol treatment. Three patients had a clear decrease in the level of hemolysis with propranolol therapy. One patient developed congestive failure after 6 months on propranolol. The decrease in hemolysis is most likely related to a slower heart rate.", 
    "14": "Ventricular ectopic activity in a young person with an otherwise normal heart usually requires no treatment. In older patients, 10 or more ectopic beats per minute, multiform beats and ectopy occurring close to the preceding beat are indications for drug control. Exercise-induced ectopic beats may respond to physical training. Three or more consecutive ventricular ectopic beats constitute ventricular tachycardia, which requires prevention. Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, when paroxysmal, may be aborted by maneuvers to enhance vagal tone. When they are frequent, treatment is required.", 
    "15": "Tremor can be categorized into three general types: resting, action, and intention, Each requires different therapy. Resting tremor is present when the hands are at rest; it disappears with movement. It is characteristic of Parkinson's disease and responds to treatment with L-dopa either alone or in combination with a decarboxylase inhibitor. Action tremor is maximal when the hands are outstretched to the front; it may persist during movement. It is not rare and is often misread as a sign of Parkinson's disease. Propranolol is beneficial. Intention tremor occurs with movement and is characteristic of cerebellar disease. Pharmacologic agents are not helpful. The only known effective treatment is stereotaxic surgery.", 
    "16": "Recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias required multiple resuscitative efforts with electrical countershock in a 45-year-old woman with previously undiagnosed asymptomatic congenital prolongation of the Q-T interval. This patient represents the oldest person with symptoms relating to idiopathic prolongation of the Q-T interval found in the literature. Exacerbating factors, including diuretic-induced hypokalemia and the concomitant administration of perphenazine, were present. In such cases, initially refractory to therapy with antiarrhythmic agents, insertion of a transvenous pacemaker with overdrive suppression of the ventricular tachyarrhythmias may be lifesaving, allowing for the institution of therapy with agents that can selectively shorten the Q-T interval.", 
    "17": "The minimum current required to cause ventricular fibrillation was determined by electrical stimulation of the normal or ischemic canine left ventricle. The threshold for ventricular fibrillation in the normal heart decreased when the heart rate was rapid. Strong vagal stimulation did not affect the ventricular fibrillation threshold when the heart rate was fixed. The fall in the ventricular fibrillation threshold in the presence of acute myocardial ischemia was greater and more prolonged when the heart rate was rapid. These findings indicate the importance of the immediate correction of tachycardia in patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "18": "In 10 insulin-independent diabetic patients and 5 healthy volunteers the basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was tested before and during oral treatment with the beta-blocker 1-(4-nitrophenyl)-2-isopropylaminoethanol (nifenalol, Inpea). In diabetic patients the insulin secretion was not changed by Inpea. The fasting blood sugar levels were slightly elevated in 8 of these patients. This result, which could not be ascertained statistically, may be due to a slight intrinsic activity of this beta-blocker. The normal subjects showed different responses. In one person the glucose tolerance deteriorated by Inpea.", 
    "19": "The effect of five sympathomimetic amines and some of their acetyl derivatives on the blood pressure of the rat was determined on the left carotid artery. After pretreatment with chlorisondamine (1 mg/kg subcutaneously) the blood pressure rise by sympathomimetic amines and their acetyl derivatives was compared with that of adrenaline. If the potency of adrenaline is specified as 100, the potencies of the other drugs are phenylephrine (metaoxedrinum, NFN) 37, tyramine 1.1, O-acetyltyramine 0.52, amphetamine 0.50, O-diacetylphenylephrine 0.25, ephedrine 0.23, O-acetylephedrine 0.02, N-acetylphenylephrine 0.01. The effects of N-acetyltyramine, N-acetylephedrine and N-acetylamphetamine are even weaker. Reserpine 5.0 or 0.05 mg/kg intraperitoneally 24 hours before the experiment increased the blood pressure rise by the directly acting sympathomimetic amines and their acetyl derivatives, but decreased the effects of the indirectly acting drugs. After treatment with phenoxybenzamine (2 mg/kg intraperitoneally), adrenaline exhibited the greatest blood pressure decrease and the effects of the other drugs in descending order: orciprenaline, O-acetyltyramine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, amphetamine, O-diacetylphenylephrine and O-acetylephedrine. Tyramine did not show any blood pressure decrease. The blood pressure decrease by sympathomimetic amines and by their acetyl derivatives was probably due to beta-receptor stimulation because it was prevented by propranolol. The N-acetyl derivatives recembled their parent drugs with regard to the immediate onset and short duration of their effects. The O-acetyl derivatives exhibited slower onset and longer duration of effect than their parent drugs. Physostigmine-pretreatment diminished the rise in blood pressure by O-acetyltyramine, but the effect of tyramine remained unchanged.", 
    "20": "The cardiovascular responses to acute mental \"stress\" were compared in the Milan strain of spontaneously hypertensive rats (MHS) and in normotensive control rats (NR). Blood pressure and heart rate were followed in pairs of awake MHS and NR, while defence reactions were provoked by alerting stimuli (noise, vibration). No differences were noted between the two groups in response to \"stress\" although resting heart rate in MHS was lower than in NR. Administration of atropine or propranolol to MHS and NR showed the MHS to have a higher resting vagal tone and lower sympathetic tone than the NR. Subsequent (at least two weeks later) hemodynamic investigation, under nembutal anesthesia, showed no difference in cardiac output between MHS and NR but a higher stroke volume, presumably related to the lower heart rate in MHS. Thus, total peripheral resistance was increased in MHS as was the ratio left ventricular weight/body weight, and in good proportion to the blood pressure rise. Thus MHS differ substantially in both their responses to \"stress\" and also hemodynamically from the Okamoto strain of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), being the so far most studied and best known model of essential hypertension in man. In MHS the hypertension is more of a systolic type and is of primarily renal origin. As such, MHS provide another model for investigating the polygenic nature of hypertension in man.", 
    "21": "The effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agents on the serum prolactin levels of six women with hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea were investigated. There was no indication that pituitary adenomas were etiologic agents for the hyperprolactinemia. Serum prolactin could be lowered with oral L-dopa. When intravenous phentolamine (an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent) or intravenous propranolol (a beta-adrenergic blocking agent) were administered for 1 hour, there was no significant change in serum prolactin levels.", 
    "22": "In thirteen patients with coronary insufficiency and angina pectoris the therapeutic effects of verapamil, 80 mg three times/day and practolol, 100 mg three times/day, were compared and tested against placebo in a double-blind cross-over fashion. Verapamil proved to be the most efficient drug as regards attack frequency and glyceryl trinitrate consumption as well as physical working capacity, bringing about a statistically significant increase of the exercise tolerance as compared to placebo after a treatment period of four weeks. Verapamil is a good alternative to beta-blockers in the prophylactic treatment of angina. Possible modes of action of verapamil in angina pectoris are discussed. The study had to be interrupted because of the reports of side effects of practolol, explaining the small number of patients.", 
    "23": "1 The effects of the disodium salt of ethylenediamine tetra-acetate (EDTA) and 1, 2, bis, 2 aminoethoxyethane-NNN'N'-tetra-acetic acid (EGTA) on renin secretion and vascular resistance were studied in the isolated perfused kidney of the rat. 2 Both substances produced a significant increase of renin release 3 In the absence of calcium and magnesium, EDTA still increased rein release and there was now a considerable increase of perfusion pressure. 4 The rise of pressure but not the rise of renin was inhibited by the removal of potassium from the perfusate when EDTA was administered in the absence of calcium. 5 Propranolol and phenoxybenzamine had no effect on the vasoconstrictor action of EDTA. 6 EGTA was less effective as a renin releaser than EDTA until magnesium was removed from the perfusate. Furter, it had only a small effect on perfusion pressure in contrast to EDTA.", 
    "24": "In a double-blind study on student nurses the curves of three affectivity components and the pulse rate under exam conditions were observed. One group had received 1-(o-allyloxy-phenoxy)-3-isopropylamino-propan-2-ol hydrochloride (oxprenolol, Trasicor and the other group a placebo. In the examination stress the affectivity component \"aggression\" was particularly obvious. With placebo the states and actions of aggression were more extreme than in the oxprenolol group. It appeared that the severe affectivity inclinations resulted in a reduction of examination performance. Under oxprenolol, in accordance with recently published results, there was no decrease in performance under exam conditions. Quite the opposite: as it seems to curb extreme affectivity inclinations the decreases in performance connected with them are often prevented.", 
    "25": "The effect of 4-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylamino-propoxy)-phenyl acetamide (atenolol, ICI 66 082) (100 mg) on airway resistance (Rt), thoracic gas volume (IGV), pulse rate and blood pressure was tested as a double blind study in 20 patients with chronic obstructive airway disease in comparison to propranolol (80 mg) and placebo. The effect on pulse rate was equipotent, but when using propranolol the mean increase of Rt was larger and increased Rt-values (greater than or equal 1.5 cm H2O/l/sec) were observed more frequently than after atenolol application. These differences were significant for 1 h after application. The augmentation of IGV was significantly larger after propranolol than after atenolol. We conclude that atenolol, in comparison to propranolol, has a relative but no specific cardioselectivity.", 
    "26": "The effects of propranolol, digoxin and combination therapy (/D) on the resting and exercise ECG were studied in ten normal subjects and 20 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) given a sequence of oral placebo, propranolol, P/D, digoxin and placebo, for two week periods. Digoxin produced a significant decrease in T-wave amplitude and often resulted in ST segment depression in the resting ECG. Propranolol, digoxin, and P/D tended to decrease the QTc interval and prolong the PR interval. However, CAD patients were more sensitive to PR prolongation than normals while receiving propranolol or digoxin alone. Propranolol therapy did not significantly affect the ST segment of the exercise ECG in the normal subjects or the CAD patients without an ischemic control exercise ECG. By contrast, 50 per cent of the normal subjects developed \"false-positive\" ischemic ST segment responses to exercise while receiving digoxin of P/D and three of eight CAD patients without ischemic control exercise ST segments had a similar response to digoxin or P/D. In 12 CAD patients with ischemic control exercise ST segments, propranolol did not affect the amount of ST segment depression at the onset of angina or the maximum amount of ST segment depression. Digoxin or P/D both uniformly increased the maximum amount of ST segment depression which was greater with digoxin than P/D. However, the maximum heart rate on P/D was significantly reduced as compared to that on digoxin. It is concluded that (1) CAD patients are more sensitive to propranolol or digoxin-induced AV block than normals, (2) propranolol does not change the magnitude of ischemic exercise ST segment depression, (3) digoxin increases ischemic exercise ST segment depression and results in a high incidence of false-positive exercise tests, and (4) the addition of propranolol to digoxin attenuates the effects of digoxin on the exercise ST segment.", 
    "27": "The treatment of patients with angina pectoris is commonly evaluated according to such indexes as the frequency of anginal attacks, quantity of supplemental nitroglycerin, and exercise performance in an ergometric laboratory test. None of these indexes demonstrates the clinical change in ordinary functional limitations that may have been the major reason why a patient sought medical help. The New York Heart Association ratings of functional capacity do not refer to different types of activity and the four categories of the scale are too coarse to show distinct changes that can occur while a patient retains the same rating. A new taxonomy has been devised for rating transitions in functional capacity as noted in three different kinds of functional performance: occupation, customary activities, and sporadic activities. The ratings of change in these three activities can be combined into single global rating. When applied to conventional questionaire data for 309 patients in a randomized double-blind therapeutic trial, the new classifications showed a statistically significant superiority, in each type of functional transition and in the global ratings, for patients receiving timolol maleate rather than placebo. By augmenting the conventional information used for therapeutic evaluation, the new taxonomic indexes can expand the scientific scope of antianginal treatment. Data derived from history-taking can be just as statistically significant as \"harder\" forms of information, while simultaneously being more pertinent for the clinical challenge of choosing and evaluating the agents used in patient care.", 
    "28": "Excessive reactivity of blood platelets may contribute to atherosclerotic vascular disease. Hence drugs which alter platelet function may be protective. Prompted by findings that propranolol therapy normalized hyperactive platelet aggregation in patients with coronary artery disease, we studied propranolol in vitro to assess its action on platelets. At concentrations similar to those achieved in vivo (0.1-1 muM), propranolol raised the thresholds for aggregation of some normal paltelets by adenosine diphosphate (ADP). At higher concentrations (10-50 muM), propranolol abolished the second wave of platelet aggregation induced by ADP and epinephrine, and inhibited aggregation induced by collagen, thrombin, and the ionophore A23187. Propanolol blocked the release of 14C-serotonin from platelets, inhibited platelet adhesion to collagen, and interfered with clot retraction. Propranolol blocked ionophore-induced uptake of 45Ca by platelets. Inhibition appeared unrelated to beta-adrenergic blockage, as d(+) propranolol (which lacks beta-blocking activity) was equipotent with 1(-) propranolol. Moreover, practolol, a beta-blockading drug which is nonlipophilic, did not inhibit platelet function. These studies suggested that propranolol, like local anesthetics, decreased platelet responsiveness by a direct action on the platelet membrane, possibly by interfering with calcium availability. Modulation of platelet function by propranolol may occur at concentrations achieved at usual clinical doses of the drug.", 
    "29": "Ten children with hypertension poorly controlled with other drugs and high peripheral plasma renin activity after renal transplantation were treated with propranolol. The mean systolic pressure decreased from 139 to 127 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and the mean diastolic pressure from 98 to 83 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Eight children had an antihypertensive response; two did not respond. The maximum dose of propranolol in responders varied from 1.0 to 6.2 mg/kg/day and duration of treatment until response varied from four to 49 days. PRA, repeated in seven responders, decreased in all (p less than 0.01). There was no correlation between changes in PRA and blood pressure. Propranolol was well tolerated and was a valuable antihypertensive drug in these children.", 
    "30": "Isopropylnoradrenaline (ISO), 3',5'-AMP and dibutyryl-3',5'-AMP decreased the oxygen tension (pO2) in the liver and the spleen and increased the body oxygen consumption (VO2). Time dynamics of these two effects was closely correlated for ISO and 3',5'-AMP. An increase of heat output was not accompanied by any significant changes in the respiration coefficient. Pempidine and dihydroergotamine failed to prevent 3',5'-AMP effects; inderal somewhat decreased these effects. Apparently, the catecholamine influence upon pO2 was a result of the VO2 increase through 3'5'-AMP effects are largely direct, but they include the in vivo and beta-receptor component; 2',3'-AMP decreased pO2 and VO2.", 
    "31": "Barbital-sedated, cold-acclimated (CA) or warm-acclimated (WA) rats were given different doses and combinations of noradrenaline, theophylline, and the adrenergic-blocking agents propranolol and phentolamine, to stimulate or inhibit calorigenesis in various ways. To see whether the effects of these drugs on calorigenesis could be ascribed to effects on the adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) - cyclic AMP system, and to try to assess thereby the significance of this system in the regulation of nonshivering thermogenesis (NST), changes in the concentration of plasma cyclic AMP were measured as an index (Broadus, A.E., Hardman, J.G., Kaminsky, N. I., Ball, J. H., Sutherland, E.W., and Liddle, G. W.: 1971. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 185, 50-60) of changes in tissue levels of cyclic AMP. In CA rats, which have a severalfold greater capacity for NST than WA rats, calorigenic responses to noradrenaline, theophylline, noradrenaline plus theophylline, or phentolamine plus theophylline were as much as four times larger than in WA rats, However, the changes in level of plasma cyclic AMP produced by each of these and other treatments were virtually the same for both groups. It would appear, therefore, that the difference between WA and CA rats in ability to produce heat by NST is not a function of the amplitude of changes in tissue levels of cyclic AMP. Nevertheless, it was also observed, and was particularly striking in CA rats, that when a drug or combination of drugs had a stimulatory, inhibitory, or synergistic effect on calorigenesis, it had a similar effect with respect to elevation of plasma cyclic AMP. Altogether, the results indicate that adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP are likely to be participants in the regulation of NST in the rat, but that they would be subservient in this regard to whatever factors are responsible for acclimation-related differences in capacity for NST.", 
    "32": "Acute administration of morphine sulfate at 20 mg/kg decreased mouse cerebellar adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate (cAMP) levels while not affecting cAMP phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.17). The cAMP levels and cAMP phosphodiesterase activies were not affected by chronic treatment. However, cAMP levels increased during abrupt withdrawal both with and without naloxone precipitation, with cAMP phosphodiesterase activities being correspondingly decreased. Propanolol prevented the cAMP increase during abrupt withdrawal.", 
    "33": "The new sulphonylurea CS 476 does not potentiate the effect of insulin on plasma glucose levels in diabetic dogs in which an oral glucose load does not cause insulin release. In normal dogs propranolol 0.3 mg/kg intravenously inhibites the insulin release and the hypoglycaemia due to CS 476 suggesting involvement of beta-adrenergic receptors in its action on the pancreas. Pretreatment of dogs with phentolamine leads to an augmentation of the insulin response to CS 476.", 
    "34": "Supramaximal preganglionic volleys did not elicit detectable postsynaptic potential in the curare-treated superior cervical ganglion cell of the guinea pig whereas, a tetanic stimulation (10-30 Hz, 1-5 seconds) consistently evoked a monophasic depolarizing potential resembling the slow excitatory postsynaptic potential. The depolarizing potential was not preceded by a detectable hyperpolarization. In non-curare-treated preparations, norepinephrine in concentrations of 1 to 10 muM consistently and reversibly suppressed the fast excitatory postsynaptic potential elicited by submaximal preganglionic stimulation without appreciably affecting the resting membrane potential, the total membrane resistance or the cell membrane excitability. Pretreating the ganglion with phenoxybenzamine (10 muM) completely prevented, whereas propranolol (30 muM) failed to antagonize, the ganglionic depressant action of norepinephrine. The amplitude and time course of the iontophoretically induced acetylcholine potential were not significantly altered by norepinephrine in concentrations which markedly attenuated the response of the fast excitatory postsynaptic potential. The frequency but not the amplitude of the miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials was significantly reduced by norepinephrine (1-10 muM). These results demonstrate that norepinephrine inhibits ganglionic transmission in the guinea pig principally by reducing the output of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminals. These data are discussed with respect to their relation to the presence in the guinea pig superior cervical ganglion of norepinephrine-containing small intensely fluorescent cells which are not connected synaptically with the postganglionic neurons.", 
    "35": "Systemic administration of drugs affecting central noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems was used to evaluate their role in the regulation of TSH secretion in the rat. Alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MT) caused a depletion of brain norepinephrine and dopamine and a gradual decrease of serum TSH levels. Specific inhibitors of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) and FLA 63, depleted central norepinephrine only and led to a simultaneous striking decrease of serum TSH. Blockade of alpha adrenergic receptors with phenoxybenzamine, but not with phentolamine, also depressed serum TSH. Blockade of beta receptors with propranolol had no effect. In contrast, the centrally and peripherally acting alpha receptor agonist, clonidine, increased serum TSH, whereas the peripherally acting methoxamine caused a decrease, probably due to non specific stress effect. A dose-related rapid inhibition of TSH secretion was observed following stimulation of dopamine receptors with apomorphine. Injection of L-Dopa had a similar effect. Blockade of the dopamine receptors with pimozide did not alter serum TSH, while blockade with spiroperidol led to a slight increase. The cold-induced surgeof TSH was abolished by pretreatment with DDC or phenoxybenzamine, reduced by apomorphine, but unaffected by pimozide or propranolol. The pituitary responsiveness to exogenous TRH was unaffected by administration of DDC or apomorphine. On the basis of these results, it is assumed that the central noradrenergic system has a stimulatory effect on the release of TRH from the hypothalamus, reflected in our experiments by the changes of serum TSH levels. It probably provides the drive for the tonic release of TRH in resting conditions and stimuli for the enhanced secretion during cold exposure. The effect is probably mediated by a central alpha-adrenergic mechanism. Activation of the dopaminergic system is inhibitory, but the physiological role of this effect remains to be established.", 
    "36": "Tissue auto-antibodies were investigated in fifty-one patients (twenty-five female, twenty-six male) receiving practolol for ischaemic heart disease or dysrhythmias and compared with those found in 204 patients (fifty-eight female, 146 male) with ischaemic heart disease who did not receive practolol. Antinuclear factor (ANF) was found in 24% female and 16% male patients receiving practolol, but only in 5% of female and 4% of male patients who were not taking practolol. Thyroid cytoplasmic antibody (TCA) was detected in 16% female and 20% of male patients receiving practolol, compared to 10% of females and 6% of males in the control group. The incidence of ANF and TCA was significantly higher (P less than 0-05) in patients receiving practolol compared to the control group. The occurrence of gastric parietal cell antibody (PCA) and smooth muscle antibody (SMA) was not associated with practolol therapy (odds ratio of 2-4 and 1-9 respectively). The incidence of skin and eye complications was found to be 10% and the female to male ratio of this complication was 4 : 1. The correlation between autoantibody production and oculo-cutaneous complications could not be established in such a small group but three of the patients with the complications were found to have PCA, although PCA was found not to be associated with practolol therapy. Four of the five patients with the complications did not have circulating ANF.", 
    "37": "We have demonstrated recently that grayanotoxin I (GTX I) produces a positive inotropic effect in isolated guinea-pig atria. In order to determine whether this effect of GTX I is related to the reported action of this compound to increase the sodium permeability of cytoplasmic membranes, the effect of GTX I and alpha-dihydrograyanotoxin II (alpha-2H-GTX II) on electrical and mechanical properties and transmembrane cation movements were studied in guinea-pig myocardium. In electrically driven guinea-pig left atrial preparations, both grayanotoxins produced a slight depolarization and appear to decrease the upstroke velocity of the action potential, with a concomitant increase in isometric contractile force in the presence or absence of propranolol. Pretreatment with propranolol shifted the dose-response curves for the inotropic effect of both grayanotoxins slightly to the right. The magnitudes of changes in the electrical and mechanical properties induced by GTX I and alpha-2H-GTX II were similar. The rate of development and subsequent washout of the positive inotropic effects, however, was faster with alpha-2H-GTX II than with GTX I, consistent with a previous report that the action of alpha-2H-GTX II to increase membrane sodium permeability develops more rapidly than that of GTX I. At higher concentrations, both grayanotoxins produced arrhythmias. Arrhythmias induced by GTX I were characterized by extrasystoles whereas those induced by alpha-2H-GTX II were characterized by initial extrasystoles followed by a failure of the atria to follow electrical stimulation. Positive inotropic and arrhythmic effects of both grayanotoxins were reversible after the washout of the drug. Both types of arrhythmias produced by either GTX I or alpha-2H-GTX II were reversed by tetrodotoxin, an agent which has been demonstrated to antagonize the action of the grayanotoxins to increase membrane sodium permeability. Although both grayanotoxins had no marked effect on partially purified Na+, K+-adenosine triphosphatase, they produced dose-dependent increases in ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake of ventricular slices under conditions in which the intracellular sodium concentration determines the rate of active monovalent cation transport by the Na+, K+-adenosine triphosphatase system. These data suggest that the positive inotropic effects of grayanotoxins are due to an increased membrane sodium permeability and are consistent with a hypothesis that alterations in transmembrane sodium movements result in an altered myocardial contractility.", 
    "38": "Studies were made on tritiated histamine binding to the receptor-rich membrane fraction and solubilized sites and its displacement by various drugs. H1-Agonists and antagonists displaced histamine most effectively. A H2-agonist and atropine were less effective and propranolol, phentolamine and imidazole acetic acid had little effect. The solubilized binding sites showed the same specificity of binding as the membrane fraction. Membrane fragments had two binding constants, whereas solubilized sites had only one. Solubilized sites bound similar amounts of histamine and dibenamine: the latter was applied to intact tissue under conditions which would presumably cause specific binding to histamine receptors. These binding characteristics show that the method used was adequate for purification of histamine receptors from smooth muscle of cat small intestine.", 
    "39": "The effects of metiamide, a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, and propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, on gastric secretion were studied in anesthetized dogs. Metiamide, 1.45 mg/kg i.v., markedly inhibited the gastric secretion induced by a continuous i.v. infusion of tetragastrin (8 microng/kg-hr), histamine dihydrochloride (160 microng/kg-hr), or methacholine bromide (100 microng/kg-hr). Propranolol 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg i.v. produced a significant potentiation of tetragastrin-induced gastric secretion but no influence of the secretion induced by methacholine. Propranolol at 5 or 10 mg/kg i.v. produced a slight reduction of the tetragastrin-induced secretion and a significant reduction of methacholine-induced secretion. Histamine-induced gastric secretion was not affected by propranolol at either 1 and 10 mg/kg i.v. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that interactions among histamine, gastrin and acetylcholine receptors do occur though the degree would not be the same in all directions.", 
    "40": "The effects of both alpha and beta adrenergic agonists and blockers on antigen-stimulated DNA synthesis in human lymphocyte cultures were studied. Results show that antigen-induced responses were enhanced by the presence of the beta blockers, propranolol and dichloroisoproterenol, and that this effect appeared to be specific blocking of the lymphocyte beta receptor since D (+) propranolol, a compound devoid of such acitvity, has no effect. Similarly, and alpha adrenergic agonist such as norepinephrine enhanced lymphocyte responsiveness.", 
    "41": "The adenylate cyclase-coupled beta-adrenergic receptors of frog erythrocyte membranes have been identified by direct radioligand binding techniques using the potent catecholamine agonist (+/-)[3H]hydroxybenzylisproterenol (2-[3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl]-2-hydroxy-1', 1'-dimethyl-2'-[4-hydroxyphenyl]-diethylamine). The successful experimental conditions included the use of (i) high concentrations of catechol and ascorbic acid to suppress nonreceptor binding, (ii) a very potent radiolabeled catecholamine (10 times more potent than isoproterenol), and (iii) membranes rich in binding sites for beta-adrenergic receptors. Thus, previous problems in accomplishing successful catecholamine binding to the beta-receptors have been overcome. The binding sites identified with (+/-)[3H]hydroxybenzylisoproterenol in the erythrocyte membranes have all the characteristics expected of true beta-adrenergic receptors. These include rapidity of binding, saturability, specificity for beta-agonists and antagonists, and stereospecificity [(-)isomers more potent than (+)isomers]. Physiologically inactive compounds containing a catechol moiety do not compete for occupancy of these binding sites. Dissociation of the radiolabeled agonist from the receptors is slow and incomplete in the absence of guanine nucleotides. In the presence of nucleotide, however, dissociation is rapid and complete. beta-Adrenergic agonists and antagonists compete for the (+/-)[3H]hydroxybenzylisoproterenol binding sites in a fashion parallel to their competition for the receptors, as previously delineated with the beta-adrenergic antagonist (-)[3H]dihydroalprenolol.", 
    "42": "A technique for the study of epidermal growth factor (EGF) secretion from salivary gland pieces in vitro is described and the responses to a variety of drugs are compared to the results of previously reported in vivo studies. Adrenaline stimulates secretion of the growth factor as does the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine, while isoprenaline is less active in stimulating EGF secretion. Phentolamine, but not propranolol, blocks the secretory activity of adrenaline and isoprenaline in this system. Pretreatment of the salivary gland pieces with colchicine reduces the secretory response to adrenaline, suggesting an involvement of microtubular proteins in the process. It is anticipated that the in vitro technique described will provide a means by which detailed investigation of the secretion of epidermal growth factor can be made.", 
    "43": "In dogs, anaesthetized with chloralose, fentanyl (5 mug/kg i.v.) augmented the bradycardia produced by electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus nerves. In contrast, the same dose of the drug did not change the bradycardic response to stimulation of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) indicating that a central facilitation of baroreceptor impulses occurs within the NTS, probably at the first synapse of baroreceptor reflex fibres. Bilateral destruction of the NTS caused a fulminating hypertension and tachycardia similar to that after cutting the baroreceptor afferent fibres. After both procedures, fentanyl (20 mug/kg i.v.) produced marked hypotension and bradycardia. The bradycardic effect was abolished by cutting both vagal nerves when the dogs were pretreated with a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent (S 2395, 50 mug/kg i.v.). The results provide evidence that the NTS is not the main site of action either for the hypotensive effect or for the vagally mediated bradycardia of fentanyl. Since the dorsal nucleus of the vagal nerve was destroyed together with the NTS, this nucleus does also not appear to be a major site of the action of fentanyl. Blockade of dopamine receptors by haloperidol or pimozide or of serotonin receptors by methysergide did not change the hypotensive, bradycardic and sympathoinhibitory effects of fentanyl.", 
    "44": "The effect of 3',4'-dihydroxy-alpha-methylpropiophenone (U-0521) on the rate of spontaneously contracting cultured rat heart cells and right atria of rats and kittens was investigated. The action of U-0521 on the cellular content of cyclic AMP and on the adenylyl cyclase of heart membrane particels was also studied. 1. U-0521 caused positive chronotropic effects on single cultured heart cells and right atria of the rat. U-0521 was about 10(5) times less potent than (--)-isoprenaline. The maximum effect of U-0521 was smaller than the maximum effect of (--)-isoprenaline. A small positive chronotropic effect of U-0521 was also observed on kitten atria. 2. The beta-adrenoceptor blocker (--)-bupranolol antagonized the positive chronotropic effects of U-0521 to the same extent as the effects of (--)-isoprenaline on single cells and atria of the rat. The effects of both U-0521 and (--)-isoprenaline appear therefore mediated through the same beta-adrenoceptors. The positive chronotropic effects of U-0521 on kitten atria were also blocked by (--)-bupranolol. 3. Up to 0.1 mM U-0521 did not block the effects of (--)-isoprenaline on rat atria, not even in the presence of corticosterone or hydrocortisone. 4. 1 min incubations with equieffective (increase in cellular beating rate) concentrations of U-0521 (0.1 mM) and (--)-isoprenaline (1 nM) caused a significant increase in the cellular content of cAMP; this effect of both drugs was antagonized by 10 nM (--)-bupranolol. 5. 0.1--3.3 mM U-0521 did not stimulate the adenylyl cyclase of cell-free membrane particles of kitten ventricles. The cyclase was depressed by 10 mM U-0521. 3.3 mM U-0521 caused a 20% decrease of the maximum cyclase-stimulating effect of (--)-isoprenaline and a 1.6-fold increase of its apparent Km. 6. The results with U-0521 suggest that beta-adrenoceptors can be activated by agonists devoid of nitrogen. However, the affinity of U-0521 for the beta-adrenoceptor is very low (KU-0521 approximately 5.5 mM). The concentration of U-0521 (0.1 mM) causing maximal increases in beating rate of cultured cells probably occupies less than 7% of the available beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "45": "1. In isometrically contracting kitten papillary muscles, dibutyryl cyclic AMP (DBcAMP) enhanced peak tension, increased rates of contraction and relaxation, decreased tension of a phasic but not of a small tonic component of KCl-contractures, and caused aftercontractions. These effects resemble closely those of catecholamines. 2. The effects of DBcAMP on kitten papillary muscle were not influenced by (-)-bupranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. 3. DBcAMP decreased KCl-contractures in strips of frog ventricle. 4. Phasic KCl-contractures in kitten papillary muscles were decreased by (-)- and (+)-isoprenaline. For similar effects, 100-fold higher concentrations of (+)-isoprenaline than of (-)-isoprenaline were required. 5. Increases in maximum rates of contraction and relaxation, increases in peak tension of isometric contractions and reduction of phasic KCl-contractures by catecholamines were antagonized competitively to a similar extent by (-)-bupranolol. Mean apparent equilibrium constants for the beta-adrenoceptor-(-)-bupranolol complex of 0.46-0.70 nM were estimated. These constants were quite similar irrespective of whether (-)-isoprenaline, (+)-isoprenaline or (-)-noradrenaline were used as agonists. 6. Increases in contractile strength, maximum rates of contraction and of relaxation of isometric contractions and decreases in KCl-contractures by (-)-isoprenaline were surmountably blocked by (+)-bupranolol. Mean apparent equilibrium constants for the receptor-(+)-bupranolol complex were 40-50 nM. 7. The equilibrium constants of (-)- and (+)-bupranolol for the receptors mediating positive inotropic and relaxant effects of catecholamines were not significantly different from constants for bupranolol-receptor complexes in cell-free membrane particles of kitten heart ventricle. It is suggested that the same beta-adrenoceptor triggers positive inotropic, relaxant and adenylyl cyclase-activating effects of catecholamines in kitten papillary muscle. 8. The partial agonist (-)-dichloroisoprenaline (DCI) (1 muM) reduced by 79% the phasic KCl-contractures of the kitten papillary muscles. DCI stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity of ventricle membranes to less than 1/4 of maximum stimulation by (-)-isoprenaline. If cyclic AMP produced by DCI is involved in the decrease of phasic KCl-contracture, small increase in cyclic AMP should be sufficient to induce this effect.", 
    "46": "Three groups of dogs were anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated at constant rates with the spleen clamped. Two groups were isovolemically hemodiluted with warm dextran and plasma to hematocrits just above and below that at which O2 uptake (VO2) could not be maintained at preanemic levels. One of these groups was given propranolol to reduce the cardiac output response to anemia. The third group was ventilated on a low O2 gas mixture to decrease oxygen uptake. VO2 was thus limited at a high-delivery O2 pressure (PO2) in anemia and a low-delivery PO2 in hypoxic hypoxia. VO2 was reduced at a mixed venous PO2 of 45 Torr in anemia and at 17 Torr in hypoxic hypoxia. VO2, mixed venous PO2, and O2 delivery decreased precipitously at hematocrits below 10%. Once VO2 was limited by O2 availability, a single linear relationship (r = 0.91) was found for percent VO2 as a function of total O2 delivery (cardiac output X arterial O2 content) during both anemic and hypoxic hypoxia. The critical value for O2 delivery was 9.8 ml/kg-min. When O2 supply became limiting, VO2 apparently was not diffusion limited because it was more dependent on volume delivery rates than on delivery PO2.",

    "49": "The molecular basis for the aberrant catecholamine responsiveness of the adenylate cyclase of adrenocortical carcinoma 494 was explored. The adenylate cyclase of this corticosteroid-producing, transplanted, adrenal cancer of the rat was stimulated not only by adrenocorticotropic hormone and fluoride, but also by the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol. The adenylate cyclase of normal adrenal tissue was unresponsive to isoproterenol. Direct binding studies with the specific high affinity B-adrenergic ligand, (-)[3H]dihydroalprenolol, demonstrated the pressure of 0.094 pmol of specific binding sites per milligram of tumor membrane protein. By contrast, normal adrenal membranes contained too few binding sites to accurately measure and study using these techniques. The tumor binding sites had high affinity for (-)[3H] dihydroalprenolol with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 2.1 nM. Adrenergic agonists competed for the binding sites in an order of potency, [(-) isoproterenol greater than (-) epinephrine (-) norepinephrine], paralleling their order of potency as beta-adrenergic agonists. The beta-adrenergic antagonist, (-) propranolol, competed for binding, causing half-mzximal inhibition of specific binding at a concentration of 6 nM. The alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, and several catecholamine metabolites and precursors did not effectively compete for the binding sites at high concentrations. Binding was stereospecific, the (+) stereoisomers of beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists requiring 40- to 300-fold higher concentrations than the corresponding (-) stereoisomers to half maximally inhibit (-) [3H] dihydroalprenolol binding. These results indicate that adrenocortical carcinoma 494 membranes contain beta-adrenergic receptor-binding sites which are not normally present in membranes of adrenal tissue. These ectopic beta-adrenergic receptors presumably confer on the neoplastic tissue the catecholamine sensitivity of its adenylate cyclase.", 
    "50": "The effect of administration of lidocaine on left ventricular performance was studied using systolic time intervals in nine normal subjects, eight patients with stable angina, and 15 patients with acute myocardial infarction. The greatest response in systolic time intervals occurred at three minutes after intravenous injection of lidocaine (100 mg), with values returning to baseline at 10 to 15 minutes. Administration of lidocaine produced a significant prolongation of the preejection period (PEP) corrected for heart rate in all groups and a prolongation of the ratio of PEP to left ventricular ejection time (PEP/LVET) in patients with angina. The group with acute myocardial infarction exhibited a hyperadrenergic state, as shown by a short baseline QS2I. The QS I was lengthened by administration of lidocaine in all groups, but this was more profound in those with acute myocardial infarction. These changes in systolic time intervals were still present at two hours after injection in six patients with acute myocardial infarction in whom an infusion of lidocaine followed the initial bolus. The effect of administering lidocaine after intravenous injection of propranolol (5 mg) was also studied in six normal subjects. Although propranolol therapy along prolonged the PEP/LVET, a further significant prolongation followed subsequent injection of lidocaine.",

A decrease in both supine and standing arterial pressure and heart rate was observed with no change in cardiac output and few side effects. Exercise tolerance was unaltered by the drug, but the heart rate and arterial pressure response to exercise were significantly blunted. The infusion rate of isoproterenol required to produce tachycardia was increased sevenfold by 800 mg/day labetalol and tenfold by 1600 mg/day. More than twice the control dose of phenylephrine was required during labetalol therapy to produce a rise in diastolic arterial pressure reflex tachycardia to amyl nitrite-induced hypotension was attenuated.

    "53": "In liver cells isolated from fed female rats, glucagon (290nM) increased adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) content and decreased cyclic AMP binding 30 s after addition of hormones. Both returned to control values after 10 min. Glucagon also stimulated cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase activity at 30 s and decreased protein kinase activity assayed in the presence of 2 muM cyclic AMP at 1 min. Glucagon increased the levels of glycogen phosphorylase a, but there was no change in total glycogen phosphorylase activity. Glucagon increased glycogen phosphorylase a at concentrations considerably less than those required to affect cyclic AMP and protein kinase. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 1-methyl-3-isobutyl xanthine, potentiated the action of glucagon on all variables, but did not increase the maximuM activation of glycogen phosphorylase. Epinephrine (1muM) decreased cyclic AMP binding and increased glycogen phosphorylase a after a 1-min incubation with cells. Although 0.1 muM epinephrine stimulated phosphorylase a, a concentration of 10 muM was required to increase protein kinase activity. 1-Methyl-3-isobutyl xanthine (0.1 mM) potentiated the action of epinephrine on cyclic AMP and protein kinase. (-)-Propranolol (10muM) completely abolished the changes in cyclic AMP binding and protein kinase due to epinephrine (1muM) in the presence of 0.1mM 1-methyl-3-isobutyl xanthine, yet inhibited the increase in phosphorylase a by only 14 per cent. Phenylephrine (0.1muM) increased glycogen phosphorylase a, although concentrations as great as 10 muM failed to affect cyclic AMP binding or protein kinase in the absence of phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Isoproterenol (0.1muM) stimulated phosphorylase and decreased cyclic AMP binding, but only a concentration of 10muM increased protein kinase. 1-Methyl-3-isobutyl xanthine potentiated the action of isoproterenol on cyclic AMP binding and protein kinase, and propranolol reduced the augmentation of glucose release and glycogen phosphorylase activity due to isoproterenol. These data indicate that both alpha- and beta-adrenergic agents are capable of stimulating glycogenolysis and glycogen phosphorylase a in isolated rat liver cells. Low concentrations of glucagon and beta-adrenergic agonists stimulate glycogen phosphorylase without any detectable increase in cyclic AMP or protein kinase activity. The effects of alpha-adrenergic agents appear to be completely independent of changes in cyclic AMP protein kinase activity.", 
    "54": "Clonidine, propranolol, bethanidine and debrisoquine effectively decrease blood pressure by suppressing renin secretion or interfering with function of the sympathetic nervous system. In man these compounds exert an antihypertensive effect within several hours or days and their duration of action is sufficient to permit administration twice or thrice daily. Clonidine and propranolol are especially useful if sexual dysfunction or postural hypotension is undesirable. Although bethanidine and debrisoquine may produce these adverse effects, they are beneficial in severe hypertension and produce fewer side effects than guanethidine. Clonidine frequently causes sedation, and rebound hypertension may occur with sudden cessation of therapy. Injudicious use of propranolol may provoke heart failure or asthma in susceptible individuals. The combination of a thiazide diuretic with propranolol and one of hydralazine, bethanidine and debrisoquine may be used to treat severe or complicated hypertension.", 
    "55": "Dopamine, apomorphine, isoproterenol and norepinephrine all increased the concentration of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in the rat kidney particulate preparation, which was composed of tubules, glomeruli and blood vessels. The concentrations of dopamine, apomorphine, isoproterenol and norepinephrine causing a half-maximal increase were 50, 83, 0.1 and 10 muM, respectively. The alpha-blocker, phentolamine, at a concentration as high as 1 mM, did not significantly reduce the effect of these drugs on the adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate concentration. The beta-blocker, propranolol (50 muM), blocked the effect of isoproterenol and norepinephrine, but not that of dopamine. The effect of dopamine was selectively blocked by spiroperidol (50 muM), a dopamine receptor antagonist, whereas the effects of isoproterenol and norepinephrine was not blocked by spiroperidol. These results suggest that in the rat kidney particulate preparation there is a specific dopamine receptor which can lead to the increase in the concentration of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate.", 
    "56": "Using the technical procedure of transvenous cardiac pacing right ventricular myocardium was stimulated with various pulse duration (voltage-duration curves) and with paired stimuli utilizing double pacing technique, to determine diastolic threshold profile up to the absolute refractory period. Two kinds of cardiac drugs were tested: Digitalis glycosides increase distolic excitability and shorten refractory period. Anitarrhythmic drugs have different effects: Lidocaine and Phenytoine in several cases decrease slightly the stimulatory threshold and can shorten the refractory period. Procainamide and Ajmaline prolong the refractory period and increase the stimulatory threshold. Propranolol and Verapamil have no significant effect. Their major action is supraventricular. The results are important in view of clinical pharmacology of cardiac drugs and of long term cardiac pacemaker therapy.",

Treatment on active medication was maintained for 6 weeks and was started after a 2-week washout and a 2-week placebo period. Twelve patients dropped out of the trial for reasons not related to the drugs and 1 patient was regarded as a therapeutic failure. Efficacy was assessed by measuring the diastolic and systolic blood pressure, pulse rate and by noting any significant ECG changes. All treatments reduced and maintained a lower blood pressure. However, a reduction with 360 mg propranolol per day was not statistically significant. Metoprolol 120 mg/d was significantly superior to propranolol 240 mg/d in holding the diastolic supine blood pressure at less than or equal to 90 mmHg. Metoprolol 120 mg/d and 210 mg/d pooled results were significantly superior to the propranolol 240 mg/d and 360 mg/d pooled data in maintaining a diastolic blood pressure of less than or equal to 90 mmHg. All treatments were well tolerated and in no case was it necessary to withdraw owing to adverse effects. No significant difference was detected between the treatments with respect to therapeutic emergent symptoms and signs. Laboratory results remained normal with all treatments.",

    "61": "Combined treatment with low doses of different drugs is widely used for moderate hypertension. The effects of atenolol and methyldopa at two dose levels and in combination at the lower doses were studied in patients with moderate hypertension on continuous treatment with moderate hypertension on continuous treatment with chlorthalidone. The mean reduction in standing blood pressures obtained with atenolol 150 and 300 mg/day was about 27/17 mm Hg and with methyldopa 750 and 1500 mg/day about 28/14 mm Hg. Combined treatment with atenolol 150 mg/day and methyldopa 750 mg/day for four weeks resulted in a reduction of 38/25 mm Hg. No difference was observed between the two doses of methyldopa. The lower dose of atenolol was better than the lower dose of methyldopa in reducing lying and standing diastolic blood pressures. These findings show that in patients on continuous treatment with chlorthalidone the addition of atenolol alone or methyldopa alone or of atenolol and methyldopa in combination is effective in the treatment of moderate hypertension.", 
    "62": "The effects of free and albumin-bound arachidonic acid, which is the precursor of the prostaglandins E2 and F2alpha, were studied on the spontaneous rate, contractile force and myocardial fatty acid metabolism in isolated, spontaneously beating atria of guinea pigs. Both free and albumin-bound arachidonic acid (10(-6)-10(-3) M) produced a dose-dependent positive chronotropic and a modest inotropic action. Tachyphylaxis to the positive chronotropic action of arachidonic acid developed in the course of repeated applications. Beta-Adrenoceptor blockade (pincolol) and pretreatment with reserpine or prostaglandin-synthetase inhibitors (indomethacin, fenoprofen, aspirin, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid) failed to affect the chronotropic activity of arachidonic acid significantly. The action of arachidonic acid was independent of the decarboxylation of the fatty acid. Linoleic and oleic acids did not show any positive chronotropic activity. The data are interpreted as suggesting that changes induced by arachidonic acid might be partly due to peroxides formed from arachidonic acid.", 
    "63": "The present studies demonstrate that adenylate cyclase and cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-phosphodiesterase activities in dog bronchus are comparable to those found in other smooth muscle preparations. Catecholamines, in the order isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine, increase the rate of cAMP formation. This effect can be competitively inhibited by propranolol and potentiated by a cAMP-phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The kinetic study of bronchial cAMP-phosphodiesterase showed two different rates of cAMP hydrolysis, with apparent Km values of 1.4 and 48.0 muM. The high affinity cAMP-phosphodiesterase was inhibited competitively by theophylline and papaverine, the latter being about 20 times more potent than the former. The potency of each compound to inhibit the enzyme and to relax the bronchial strip was comparable. These results, the similar order of potency of the catecholamines to relax the bronchus and to increase the rate of cAMP formation, the competitive inhibition of both effects by propranolol, and the relaxing effect of dibutyryl cAMP on bronchial strip, are compatible with the assumption that the cAMP system is one of the biochemical mechanisms mediating bronchial smooth muscle relaxation.", 
    "64": "The standard treatment of ischemic heart disease consists in the administration of nitrates and beta-sympathicolytic agents. Calcium antagonists are likewise promising. They should be used particularly if beta-sympathicolytic agents are contraindicated. In the beginning special caution should be exercised on combining a beta-sympathicolytic agent with a calcium antagonist. This is best done under clinical supervision since sudden cardiac decompensation, extreme bradycardia and/or disturbed atrioventricular conduction is to be expected. Today the administration of \"coronary dilators\" is no longer a part of the standard treatment but can at best be regarded as supplementary therapy.", 
    "65": "The effect on heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) of metoprolol, propranolol and terbutaline, applied alone or in combinations was studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Terbutaline had little effect on BP and HR. Propranolol combined with terbutaline had no effect while metoprolol combined with terbutaline decreased BP by 48 mm Hg without affecting HR. Thus the beta2-mediated increase in peripheral vascular resistance after terbutaline was revealed by a drop in BP after beta1-blockade by metoprolol, but not when both beta1-and beta2-receptors were blocked by propranolol.", 
    "66": "Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of the major metabolites of noradrenaline (4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl glycol, HMPG), serotonin (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid) and dopamine (homovanillic acid) were measured before and during the administration of clonidine or alprenolol to hypertensive patients. The noradrenaline receptor stimulant clonidine significantly decreased the CSF level of HMPG, but there was no consistent change in the concentration of serotonin or dopamine metabolites. Patients on alprenolol showed no change in the levels of these metabolites in CSF.", 
    "67": "In healthy normal subjects following the administration of labetalol the pharmacological effects were measured and compared with the plasma concentrations achieved. The inhibition of exercise induced tachycardia and inhibition of exercise induced increases in systolic pressure were significantly related to the administered dose of labetalol. Labetalol was rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and peak plasma concentrations occurred two hours after oral administration. There was a linear correlation (r = 0.84) between the logarithm of the plasma concentration and the maximum inhibition of exercise tachycardia at two hours. After intravenous administration there was an immediate reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure with a concomitant small increase in heart rate. There was a rapid decline in the associated plasma concentration but the pharmacological effects were maintained in excess of two hours. Our findings are consistent with those of others who have studied the relationship between pharmacological events and plasma concentrations after single doses of other adrenoceptor blocking drugs."
