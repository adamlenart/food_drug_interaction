Although are unusual cause of hypertension (HT) accounting for at most 0.1-0.2 % of cases, they may lead to severe and potentially lethal hypertensive crisis due to the effects of the released catecholamines. However, both PH and PG may be asymptomatic as ~30 % of subjects are normotensive or have orthostatic hypotension and in these cases the 24 h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring is an important toll to diagnose and treat HT. HT treatment may be difficult when PH or PG occurs in pregnancy or in the elderly subjects and in these cases a multidisciplinary team is required. When surgical excision is mandatory the perioperative management requires the administration of selective \u03b11-adrenergic blocking agents (i.e., doxazosin, prazosin or terazosin) followed by a \u03b2-adrenergic blockade (i.e., propranolol, atenolol). This latter should never be started first because blockade of vasodilatory peripheral \u03b2-adrenergic receptors with unopposed \u03b1-adrenergic receptor stimulation can lead to a further elevation of BP. Although labetalol is traditionally considered the ideal agent due to its \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic antagonism, experimental studies do not support its use in this clinical setting. As second regimen, the administration of vasodilators as calcium channel blockers (i.e., nicardipine, nifedipine) may be required to control BP. Oral and sublingual short-acting nifedipine are potentially dangerous in patients with hypertensive emergencies and are not recommend.

In this study, the photochemical production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were examined in colloidal dispersions of hydroxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT-OH) under simulated solar irradiation using a Xenon lamp. Two kinds of ROS, (1)O2 and OH, were confirmed by their molecular probes, furfuryl alcohol (FFA) and p-chlorobenzoic acid (PCBA). The steady-state concentrations of (1)O2 and OH were calculated as 1.30\u00d710(-14) M and 5.02\u00d710(-16) M, respectively. The effects of MWNT-OH on photodegradation of atenolol (ATL) were investigated in the presence of natural water components, i.e., dissolved organic matters (DOMs), nitrate (NO3(-)) and ferric ions (Fe(3+)). Photoproducts of atenolol were identified by solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS) analysis techniques. Three potential photochemical pathways of atenolol, including the hydroxylation on aromatic ring, the loss of amide group and the cleavage of ether oxygen bond as well as di-polymerization of reaction intermediates were tentatively proposed. Using the radical quenching method, reaction with OH was determined as the major photolysis pathway of atenolol in irradiated MWNT-OH suspensions. These findings of the production of ROS and their effects on the photodegradation of organic contaminants provided useful information for assessing environmental risk of MWNT-OH.",

Doses were titrated until systolic blood pressure (SBP) was <130\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg. Radial artery applanation tonometry and pulse wave velocity (PWV) analysis were used to derive central aortic pressures and hemodynamic indices at repeated visits at intervals during a 6-month period.

In the SSCTA group, HR was reduced to <65 beats per minute (bpm) with \u03b2-blocker (n = 27), while in the DSCTA group patients whose HR was >65 bpm were selected (n = 27). The diagnostic accuracy for significant coronary stenosis was calculated by comparing the invasive coronary angiography. Using dual-Doppler echocardiography, isovolumic relaxation time (IRT) and diastasis time (DT) were evaluated in these patients. In SSCTA, sensitivity was 89 %, specificity 99 %, the positive predictive value (PPV) 94 %, and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 98 %. In DSCTA, sensitivity was 96 %, the specificity was 99 %, PPV was 91 %, and NPV was 99 % (all NS compared to SSCTA). When HR was >75 bpm, DT was markedly shortened (<83 ms), however IRT was maintained >85 ms. Thus, the image reconstruction at the phase of IRT is feasible in DSCTA because of its temporal resolution of 83 ms. High temporal resolution of DSCTA shows equivalent accuracy of coronary stenosis detection to SSCTA, without reducing heart rate, because of its image reconstruction at IRT.",

We established a prospective registry with confirmed PPCM present in 115 patients (mean baseline left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF: 27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09\u00a0%). Follow-up data (6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0months) showed LVEF improvement in 85\u00a0% and full recovery in 47\u00a0% while 15\u00a0% failed to recover with death in 2\u00a0% of patients.

In conclusion, low baseline LVEF is a predictor for poor outcome while pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders are associated with a better outcome in this European PPCM cohort. The high recovery rate in this collective is associated with a treatment concept using beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors/ARBs and bromocriptine.

Pulse wave velocity (PWV) had been the most popular index and was known to be a predictor of cardiovascular events. But, it depends on blood pressure at measuring time. To overcome this problem, cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) is developed. CAVI is derived from stiffness parameter \u03b2 by Hayashi, and the equation of Bramwell-Hill, and is independent from blood pressure at a measuring time. Then, CAVI might reflect the proper change of arterial wall by antihypertensive agents. CAVI shows high value with aging and in many arteriosclerotic diseases and is also high in persons with main coronary risk factors. Furthermore, CAVI is decreased by an administration of \u03b11 blocker, doxazosin for 2-4 hours, Those results suggested that CAVI reflected the arterial stiffness composed of organic components and of smooth muscle cell contracture. Angiotensin II receptor blocker, olmesartan decreased CAVI much more than that of calcium channel antagonist, amlodipine, even though the rates of decreased blood pressure were almost same. CAVI might differentiate the blood pressure-lowering agents from the point of the effects on proper arterial stiffness. This paper reviewed the principle and rationale of CAVI, and the possibilities of clinical applications, especially in the studies of hypertension.",

We hypothesized that nebivolol, but not metoprolol, could attenuate prooxidant and profibrotic mechanisms of hypertension and therefore protect against the vascular remodeling associated with hypertension. Hypertension was induced in male Wistar rats by clipping the left renal artery. Six weeks after surgery, hypertensive and sham rats were treated with nebivolol (10 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) or metoprolol (20 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) for 4 weeks. Systolic blood pressure was monitored weekly. Morphologic changes in the aortic wall were studied in hematoxylin/eosin and picrosirius red sections. Aortic NAD(P)H activity and superoxide production were evaluated by luminescence and dihydroethidium, respectively, and TBARS levels were measured in plasma. Aortic nitrotyrosine staining was evaluated to assess peroxynitrite formation. TGF-\u03b2 levels and p-ERK 1/2 expression were determined by immunofluorescence and Western blotting, respectively. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and expression were determined by in situ zymography, gel zymography, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence, and TIMP-1 was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Both \u03b21-receptor antagonists exerted very similar antihypertensive effects. However, while metoprolol had no significant effects, nebivolol significantly attenuated vascular remodeling and collagen deposition associated with hypertension. Moreover, nebivolol, but not metoprolol, attenuated hypertension-induced increases in aortic NAD(P)H oxidase activity, superoxide production, TBARS concentrations, nitrotyrosine levels, TGF-\u03b2 upregulation, and MMP-2 and -9 expression/activity. No effects on p-ERK 1/2 and TIMP-1 expression were found.

Data from four trials (542 participants) showed that divalproex sodium (a stable combination of sodium valproate and valproic acid in a 1:1 molar ratio) more than doubled the proportion of responders relative to placebo (RR 2.18; 95% CI 1.28 to 3.72; NNT 4; 95% CI 2 to 11). One study of sodium valproate (34 participants) versus placebo supported the latter findings (RR for responders 2.83; 95% CI 1.27 to 6.31; NNT 3; 95% CI 2 to 9). There was no significant difference in the proportion of responders between sodium valproate versus flunarizine (one trial, 41 participants) or between divalproex sodium versus propranolol (one trial, 32 participants).

Skin tissues from diabetic model were collected, and the primary cultured fibroblasts were treated with Ang II receptor inhibitors before Ang II treatment. The collagen type I (Coll I) and collagen type III (Coll III) were measured by histochemistry. The expressions of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), MMP-1, TIMP-1 and propeptides of types I and III procollagens in skin tissues and fibroblasts were quantified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Collagen dysfunction was documented by changed collagen I/III ratio in streptozotocin (STZ)-injected mice compared with controls. This was accompanied by increased expression of TGF-\u03b2, TIMP-1 and propeptides of types I and III procollagens in diabetic skin tissues. In primary cultured fibroblasts, Ang II prompted collagen synthesis accompanied by increases in the expressions of TGF-\u03b2, TIMP-1 and types I and III procollagens, and these increases were inhibited by losartan, an Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker, but not affected by PD123319, an Ang II type 2 (AT2) receptor antagonist. These findings present evidence that Ang-II-mediated changes in the productions of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 occur via AT1 receptors and a TGF-\u03b2-dependent mechanism.",

Adderall(\u00ae) (amphetamine dextroamphetamine) and a variety of brand names and generic versions of this combination are available by prescription to treat ADHD and narcolepsy. Both immediate and sustained release products are used as are single agent amphetamine medication. Knowing the exact agent ingested can provide information of dose labeled and length of clinical effects. These drugs are used off label by college students for memory enhancement, test taking ability, and for study marathons. These agents are DEA Schedule II controlled substances with high potential for abuse. For humans with ADHD or narcolepsy, standard recommended dosage is 5-60 mg daily. Amphetamine and its analogues stimulate the release of norepinephrine affecting both \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor sites. \u03b1-Adrenergic stimulation causes vasoconstriction and an increase in total peripheral resistance. \u03b2-Adrenergic receptor stimulation leads to an increase in heart rate, stroke volume, and skeletal muscle blood flow. Clinical signs of Adderall(\u00ae) overdose in humans and dogs include hyperactivity, hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, mydriasis, tremors, and seizures. In addition, Adderall intoxication in dogs has been reported to cause hyperthermia, hypoglycemia, hypersegmentation of neutrophils, and mild thrombocytopenia. Diagnosis can be confirmed by detecting amphetamine in stomach contents or vomitus, or by positive results obtained in urine tests for illicit drugs. Treatment is directed at controlling life-threatening central nervous system and cardiovascular signs. Seizures can be controlled with benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, pentobarbital, and propofol. Cardiac tachyarrhythmias can be managed with a \u03b2-blocker such as propranolol. Intravenous fluids counter the hyperthermia, assist in maintenance of renal function, and help promote the elimination of amphetamine and its analogues. Prognosis after poisoning with Adderall(\u00ae) depends upon the severity and duration of clinical signs at presentation. Differential diagnoses that should be considered in cases of suspected amphetamine overdose are any other agents that can cause central nervous system stimulation, tremors, and seizures.

    "117": "Prognosis and quality of life of chronic heart failure (HF) patients have greatly improved over the last decade. Consequently, many patients are willing to spend leisure time at altitude, usually <3500\u2009m, but their safety in doing so is undefined. HF is a syndrome that often has relevant co-morbidities, such as pulmonary hypertension, COPD, unstable cardiac ischemia, and anemia. HF co-morbidities may per se impede a safe stay at altitude. Exercise at simulated altitude is associated with a reduction in performance, which is greater in HF patients than in normal subjects and greater in patients with most severe HF. In normal subjects, the reduction in performance is \u223c2% every 1000\u2009m altitude increase, whereas it is 4% and 10% in HF patients with normal or slightly diminished exercise capacity and in HF patients with markedly diminished exercise capacity. On-field experience with HF patients at altitude is limited to subjects driven to altitude (3454\u2009m) for a few hours. The data showed a reduction in exercise capacity similar to that reported at simulated altitude. \"Optimal\" HF treatment in patients spending time at altitude is likely different from optimal treatment at sea level, particularly as regards \u03b2-blockers. Carvedilol, a \u03b21-\u03b22-\u03b1-blocker, reduces the hypoxic ventilatory response through a reduction of the chemoreflex response, and it reduces alveolar-capillary gas diffusion, which is under control by \u03b22-receptors. These actions are not shared by selective \u03b21-blockers such as bisoprolol and nebivolol, which should be preferred for treatment of HF patients willing to spend time at altitude. In conclusion, spending time at altitude (<3500\u2009m) is safe for HF patients, provided that subjects are free of co-morbidities that may directly interfere with the adaptation to altitude. However, HF patients experience a reduction of exercise capacity in proportion to HF severity and altitude. Finally, HF patients should undergo a specific \"altitude-tailored treatment\" to avoid pharmacological interference with altitude adaptation mechanisms.",

    "119": "In smooth muscles of mollusc Anodonta cygnea, hormones produce regulatory effects on the adenylyl cyclase (AC) signaling system via receptors of the serpentine (biogenic amine, isoproterenol, glucagon) and of tyrosine kinase (insulin) types. Intracellular mechanisms of their action are interconnected. Use of hormones, their antagonists, and pertussis toxin at the combined action of insulin and biogenic amines or of glucagon on the AC activity allows revealing possible intersection points in mechanisms of their action. The combined effect of insulin and serotonin or of glucagon leads to a decrease of stimulation of AC by these hormones, whereas at action of insulin and isoproterenol the AC-stimulatory effect of insulin is blocked, while the AC-inhibitory effect of isoproterenol is preserved both in the presence and in the absence of the non-hydrolyzed GTP analog - guanylylimidodiphosphate (GppNHp). Specific blocking of the AC-stimulatory serotonin effect by cyproheptadine - an antagonist of serotonin receptors - did not affect stimulation of AC by insulin. Beta-adrenoblockers (propranolol and alprenolol) interfered with inhibition of the AC activity by isoproterenol, but did not change the AC stimulation by insulin. Pertussis toxin blocked the AC-inhibitory effect of isoproterenol and attenuated the AC-stimulatory effect of insulin. Thus, in muscles of the mollusc Anodonta cygnea there have been revealed negative interrelations between the AC system, which are realized at the combined effect of insulin and serotonin or of glucagon, probably at the level of receptor of the serpentine type (serotonin, glucagon), while at action of insulin and isoproterenol - at the level of interaction of G1 protein and AC.",

We recently reported that synthetic biotinylated peptides having a Tyr-Lys-Asp-Gly sequence inhibit PAF-induced inflammation by directly binding to PAF. In this study, we investigated the effect of two synthetic biotinylated peptides, both of which have a sequence similar to Tyr-Lys-Asp-Gly-an endothelin-3 (ET-3)-related biotinylated pentapeptide (Tyr-Lys-Asp-Lys-Glu, BPET3) and a scavenger receptor CD36-related biotinylated tetrapeptide (Tyr-Lys-Gly-Lys, BPCD36)-on PAF-induced inflammation by using a rat model of hind paw oedema. BPET3 markedly inhibited PAF-induced oedema in a dose-dependent manner, and the dose that caused 50% inhibition was estimated to be approximately 2.64 nmol/paw. The inhibitory effect of BPCD36 on PAF-induced paw oedema was less than that of BPET3, while a synthetic biotinylated pentapeptide (Lys-Lys-Tyr-Asp-Glu) shuffling amino acid sequence of BPET3, an ET-1-related synthetic biotinylated pentapeptide (Leu-Met-Asp-Lys-Glu), or an ET-2-related synthetic biotinylated pentapeptide (Trp-Leu-Asp-Lys-Glu) did not inhibit PAF-induced paw oedema. Furthermore, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence studies demonstrated that ET-3 specifically interacted with both PAF and its metabolite/precursor lyso-PAF. These results provide evidence that the Tyr-Lys-Asp region in both ET-3 and BPET3 is essential for marked inhibition of the peptide on PAF-induced inflammation, and strongly suggest that BPET3 may be useful as a novel anti-inflammatory drug targeting PAF.",

Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the primary in vivo effect of hCG on cardiac contractility and coronary blood flow and the involvement of autonomic nervous system and nitric oxide (NO). Moreover, in coronary endothelial cells (CEC), the intracellular pathways involved in the effects of hCG on NO release were also examined. In 25 anesthetized pigs, intracoronary 500 mU/ml hCG infusion at constant heart rate and aortic blood pressure increased coronary blood flow, maximum rate of change of left ventricular systolic pressure, segmental shortening, cardiac output, and coronary NO release (P < 0.0001). These hemodynamic responses were graded in a further five pigs. Moreover, while blockade of muscarinic cholinoceptors (n = 5) and of \u03b1-adrenoceptors (n = 5) did not abolish the observed responses, \u03b21-adrenoceptors blocker (n = 5) prevented the effects of hCG on cardiac function. In addition, \u03b22-adrenoceptors (n = 5) and NO synthase inhibition (n = 5) abolished the coronary response and the effect of hCG on NO release. In CEC, hCG induced the phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase through cAMP/PKA signaling and ERK1/2, Akt, p38 MAPK involvement, which were activated as downstream effectors of \u03b22-adrenoceptor stimulation. In conclusion, in anesthetized pigs, hCG primarily increased cardiac function and perfusion through the involvement of \u03b2-adrenoceptors and NO release. Moreover, cAMP/PKA-dependent kinases phosphorylation was found to play a role in eliciting the observed NO production in CEC.",

Noradrenergic (NA) receptor systems have also been implicated in similar behaviors. Dynorphinergic projections terminate within the locus coeruleus (LC), a primary source of norepinephrine in the forebrain, suggesting a possible link between the NA and dynorphin/kappa opioid systems, yet the implications of these putative interactions have not been investigated. We isolated the necessity of KORs in the LC in kappa opioid agonist (U50,488)-induced reinstatement of cocaine CPP by blocking KORs in the LC with NorBNI (KOR antagonist). KOR-induced reinstatement was significantly attenuated in mice injected with NorBNI in the LC. To determine the sufficiency of KORs in the LC on U50,488-induced reinstatement of cocaine CPP, we virally re-expressed KORs in the LC of KOR knockout mice. We found that KORs expression in the LC alone was sufficient to partially rescue KOR-induced reinstatement. Next we assessed the role of NA signaling in KOR-induced reinstatement of cocaine CPP in the presence and absence of a \u03b12-agonist (clonidine), \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist (propranolol), and \u03b2(1)- and \u03b2(2)-antagonist (betaxolol and ICI-118,551 HCl). Both the blockade of postsynaptic \u03b2(1)-adrenergic receptors and the activation of presynaptic inhibitory adrenergic autoreceptors selectively potentiated the magnitude of KOR-induced reinstatement of cocaine CPP but not cocaine-primed CPP reinstatement. Finally, viral restoration of KORs in the LC together with \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockade did not potentiate KOR-induced reinstatement to cocaine CPP, suggesting that adrenergic receptor interactions occur at KOR-expressing regions external to the LC. These results identify a previously unknown interaction between KORs and NA systems and suggest a NA regulation of KOR-dependent reinstatement of cocaine CPP.",

    "158": "Two different proinflammatory transgenic mouse models with cardiac overexpression of myotrophin (a prohypertrophic molecule) or TNF\u03b1 showed that TNF\u03b1 alone is sufficient to mediate \u03b2AR desensitization as measured by cardiac adenylyl cyclase activity. M-mode echocardiography in these mouse models showed cardiac dysfunction paralleling \u03b2AR desensitization independent of sympathetic overdrive. TNF\u03b1-mediated \u03b2AR desensitization that precedes cardiac dysfunction is associated with selective upregulation of G-protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in both mouse models. In vitro studies in \u03b22AR-overexpressing human embryonic kidney 293 cells showed significant \u03b2AR desensitization, GRK2 upregulation, and recruitment to the \u03b2AR complex following TNF\u03b1. Interestingly, inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase abolished GRK2-mediated \u03b2AR phosphorylation and GRK2 recruitment on TNF\u03b1. Furthermore, TNF\u03b1-mediated \u03b2AR phosphorylation was not blocked with \u03b2AR antagonist propranolol. Additionally, TNF\u03b1 administration in transgenic mice with cardiac overexpression of G\u03b2\u03b3-sequestering peptide \u03b2ARK-ct could not prevent \u03b2AR desensitization or cardiac dysfunction showing that GRK2 recruitment to the \u03b2AR is G\u03b2\u03b3 independent. Small interfering RNA knockdown of GRK2 resulted in the loss of TNF\u03b1-mediated \u03b2AR phosphorylation. Consistently, cardiomyocytes from mice with cardiac-specific GRK2 ablation normalized the TNF\u03b1-mediated loss in contractility, showing that TNF\u03b1-induced \u03b2AR desensitization is GRK2 dependent.",

    "160": "Tesofensine is a novel triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor which is in development for the treatment of obesity. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that appetite suppression is an important mechanism by which tesofensine exerts its robust weight reducing effect. Notably, the strong hypophagic response to tesofensine treatment is demonstrated to be linked to central stimulation of noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission. The sympathomimetic mode of action of tesofensine may also associate with the elevated heart rate and blood pressure observed in clinical settings, and we therefore sought experimentally to address this issue.",

Interestingly, combined treatment with metoprolol (b1 adrenoceptor blocker, 10-20 mg/kg, p.o.) fully prevented the cardiovascular sympathetic effects of tesofensine while leaving the robust inhibitory efficacy on food intake unaffected. Similarly, the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist telmisartan (1.0-3.0 mg/kg, p.o.) did not interfere with the anti-obesity effects of tesofensine, however, telmisartan only partially reversed the increase in systolic blood pressure and had no effect on the elevated heart rate induced by tesofensine.",

A total of 183 patients suspected of having ischemic cardiac disease and scheduled to undergo an invasive coronary angiography were randomized to groups treated with landiolol hydrochloride (0.06 or 0.125-mg/kg) or placebo. The heart rate, safety, and the performance of coronary diagnosis using landiolol hydrochloride were evaluated in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel study. The patients' heart rates during the coronary CTA were 67.6 \u00b1 8.7 and 62.6 \u00b1 7.8 beats/min in the 0.06 and 0.125-mg/kg landiolol hydrochloride groups, respectively, both of which were significantly lower than the heat rate of 73.7 \u00b1 11.8 beats/min in the placebo group (P = 0.003 and P < 0.001, respectively). No adverse events or reactions occurred at an incidence of 5 % or greater, confirming the safety of landiolol hydrochloride. The proportion of correctly classified patients was significantly higher in the 0.125-mg/kg landiolol hydrochloride group than in the placebo group (73.6 vs. 50.0 %). Landiolol hydrochloride at doses of 0.06 and 0.125-mg/kg significantly decreased the heart rate compared with a placebo.

    "165": "We have previously reported that intermittent hypoxic stress, which is relevant to sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), increases oxidative stress and induces left ventricular (LV) remodeling. Celiprolol, a \u03b21-selective adrenoreceptor blocker, is known to have not only an antihypertensive effect but also an antioxidant effect through releasing nitric oxide. The aim of this study was to examine the hypothesis that celiprolol might ameliorate the LV remodeling induced by intermittent hypoxia through its antioxidant effect. Male C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks old) were exposed to intermittent hypoxia (30 s of 5% oxygen followed by 30 s of 21% oxygen) for 8 h day(-1) during the daytime for 10 consecutive days or were maintained under normoxic conditions. Animals were treated with either celiprolol (100 mg kg(-1) day(-1) by gavage) or vehicle. Hypoxic stress caused fluctuations in blood pressure (BP), an increase in the mean cardiomyocyte diameter, perivascular fibrosis and a decrease in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression. These changes were associated with increased levels of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal protein, superoxide, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 mRNA and brain natriuretic peptide mRNA in the LV myocardium. Celiprolol significantly suppressed BP fluctuation, restored eNOS expression and reduced oxidative stress and superoxide production, thus ameliorating hypoxia-induced LV remodeling in mice. These findings suggest that treatment with celiprolol might prevent cardiovascular events in borderline hypertensive patients with SAS.",

In a pyruvate tolerance test, olanzapine significantly increased blood glucose levels. In addition, olanzapine increased the mRNA levels of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), a gluconeogenic enzyme, in the liver. Furthermore, olanzapine increased phosphorylated AMPK in the hypothalamus of unfasted mice, and olanzapine-induced hyperglycaemia was inhibited by the AMPK inhibitor compound C. Central administration of the AMPK activator AICAR significantly increased G6Pase mRNA levels in the liver and blood glucose levels. Moreover, both olanzapine- and AICAR-induced hyperglycaemia were attenuated by the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol, suggesting that olanzapine and AICAR induce hepatic glucose production through the sympathetic nervous system.",

    "183": "Migraine is a very common primary headache disorder associated with intermittent attacks and great suffering. Despite extensive research efforts in the recent years, many pathophysiological aspects remain unclear. An altered cortical adaptability and the brainstem as a migraine generator are probably involved in the initiation of a (silent) cortical spreading depression and other processes that lead to neurogenic inflammation of the meninges causing the headache. Numerous studies in the last years have examined somatic, especially cerebrovascular and also psychological comorbidities. For attack therapy, CGRP antagonists have emerged as promising non-vasoconstrictive acting alternatives for triptans. However, they were so far not approved due to liver enzyme elevations in safety studies. Another new approach without vasoconstrictive action are the selective 5-HT1F agonists (especially Lasmiditan). Large placebo-controlled and triptan-controlled trials need to be awaited. For migraine prophylaxis, a comparable effect of sports and pharmacological prophylaxis using topiramate could be found. Particularly the combination of drug and non-drug therapies (such as the combination of stress management training with a beta-blocker treatment) achieves high efficacy. Also interdisciplinary, multimodal treatment approaches are important options.

We examined the acute cardiovascular effects of a sarin-like organophosphorus agent, bis(isopropyl methyl)phosphonate (BIMP), in anaesthetized, artificially ventilated rats. Intravenous administration of BIMP (0.8mg/kg; the LD50 value) induced a long-lasting increase in blood pressure and tended to increase heart rate. In rats pretreated with the non-selective muscarinic-receptor antagonist atropine, BIMP significantly increased both heart rate and blood pressure. In atropine-treated rats, hexamethonium (antagonist of ganglionic nicotinic receptors) greatly attenuated the BIMP-induced increase in blood pressure without changing the BIMP-induced increase in heart rate. In rats treated with atropine plus hexamethonium, intravenous phentolamine (non-selective \u03b1-adrenergic receptor antagonist) plus propranolol (non-selective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist) completely blocked the BIMP-induced increases in blood pressure and heart rate. In atropine-treated rats, the reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine (1mg/kg) induced a transient increase in blood pressure, but had no effect on heart rate. These results suggest that in anaesthetized rats, BIMP induces powerful stimulation of sympathetic as well as parasympathetic nerves and thereby modulates heart rate and blood pressure. They may also indicate that an action independent of acetylcholinesterase inhibition contributes to the acute cardiovascular responses induced by BIMP.",

Objetivo: evaluar en el adulto mayor el efecto en el estre\u00f1imiento cr\u00f3nico del consumo de alimentos con alto contenido de fibra, el estado nutricio, y la actividad f\u00edsica. Material y m\u00e9todos: estudio comparativo, prospectivo y transversal efectuado en 140 adultos mayores de la consulta externa de la Unidad de Medicina Familiar51 del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social en la ciudad de Le\u00f3n, Guanajuato, durante el periodo del 4 mayo al 30 de octubre de 2009. Se valor\u00f3 si padec\u00edan o no estre\u00f1imiento de acuerdo con los criterios de Roma III. Se valor\u00f3: peso,talla, circunferencia del brazo, pliegue cut\u00e1neo tricipital; se aplic\u00f3 un cuestionario de actividad f\u00edsica validado, y se obtuvo el registro diet\u00e9tico de tres d\u00edas (dos de entre semana y uno de s\u00e1bado o domingo). Resultados: la ingesti\u00f3n promedio de fibra y agua no esult\u00f3 estad\u00edsticamente diferente entre los grupos estudiados.

    "213": "One significant disadvantage of using reverse osmosis (RO) for reclamation purposes is the need to dispose of the RO retentates. These retentates contain a high concentration of micropollutants, effluent organic matter (EfOM) and other inorganic constituents, which are recalcitrant to biological treatment and may impact the environment. The occurrence of 11 pharmaceuticals (concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 1.6 \u03bcg L(-1)) and their mitigation in RO retentates by a UV/H2O2 process and ozonation was studied using a wide range of oxidant dosages. Eleven pharmaceuticals were identified at. Initial observed kinetic constants (kobs) were calculated for the different pharmaceuticals. Other typical wastewater parameters were also monitored during the UV/H2O2 and ozonation reactions. The range for kobs was found to be 0.8-12.8L mmol O3(-1) and 9.7-29.9 L mmol H2O2(-1) for the ozonation and UV/H2O2 process, respectively. For ozonation, Atenolol, Carbamazepine, Codeine, Trimethoprim and Diclofenac showed the lowest initial kobs (in the order mentioned). Atenolol and Carbamazepine appeared as the most ozone resistant pharmaceuticals, exhibiting the lowest percentage of elimination at low ozone doses. On the other hand, despite the non-selectivity of HO, differences in the initial kobs were also observed during the UV/H2O2 process. Trimethoprim, Paroxetine and Sulfamethoxazole exhibited the lowest initial kobs values (in the order mentioned). Trimethoprim and Paroxetine also exhibited the lowest percentage removal when low H2O2 doses were assayed. The compounds that were identified as problematic during ozonation were more efficiently removed by the UV/H2O2 process. UV/H2O2 generally appeared to be a more efficient technology for removing pharmaceuticals from RO brines compared to ozonation.", 
    "214": "Inhibiting the healing of wounds to ensure that the aqueous humor can drain into the scleral space unimpeded and form a filtering bleb plays a crucial role in determining the success rate of glaucoma surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the novel use, with cell culture and animal models, of some commercial intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering drugs in inhibiting the healing of fibroblast wounds. The Tenon's fibroblasts of rabbits were cultured to evaluate 13 IOP-lowering drugs for cellular proliferation, collagen formation, and migration. These were measured using [(3)H]thymidine and [(3)H]proline uptake, and Transwell chambers. A preservative of benzalkonium chloride (BAK) was initially used, with 0.02% as a maximal original concentration. All of the drugs and the BAK were diluted from original commercial concentrations to 1/10, 1/100, and 1/1000. The more inhibitive drugs screened from the cell cultures were then selected for further short-term application during and after trabeculectomy surgeries had been performed on the rabbits. Expression of the proliferative cell nuclear antigen was immunohistochemically examined 3 and 7 days after surgery. The results revealed that the inhibitive effects of BAK in cellular [(3)H]thymidine and [(3)H]proline uptake, and cellular migration were only evident at 0.002% concentrations. Based on the results of the cell cultures, timolol, latanoprost, and unoprostone exhibited a greater inhibitory effect than the other drugs. Moreover, the animal studies showed that latanoprost and unoprostone significantly suppressed the positive expression of proliferative cell nuclear antigen around the operative excision area 7 days after the trabeculectomy surgeries. The results indicate that short-term use of some IOP-lowering drugs, such as latanoprost and unoprostone, may inhibit postoperative wound healing after glaucoma surgery.", 
    "215": "The efficacy of antihypertensive agents in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is controversial. It has been tested here whether some antihypertensive drugs might influence AD through mechanisms independent of blood pressure-lowering activity. The effects of treatment with the antihypertensive propranolol on cognition and AD-related markers have been studied in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD. Propranolol, at a lower dose than that used as antihypertensive (5 mg/kg, 6 wk), attenuated cognitive impairments shown by Tg2576 mice aged 9 months in the novel object recognition and fear conditioning tests. Propranolol was also able to counteract the increases in hippocampal levels of A\u03b2(42) present in Tg2576 mice. This effect was accompanied by an increased expression of insulin degrading enzyme. Changes in markers of synaptic pathology, as shown by decreases in phosphorylation of Akt and in the expression of BDNF in Tg2676 mice, were also counteracted by propranolol treatment. Tau hyperphosphorylation shown by Tg2576 mice was also decreased in the hippocampus of propranolol-treated mice, an effect probably related to an increase of GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation (inactive form) and a decreased JNK1 expression. Overall, these data further strengthen the potential of propranolol as a therapeutic agent for AD.",

Various solvents and extraction techniques and different ways of clean-up were tested and verified with incurred pig kidney from an animal study. The best extraction efficiency was reached by extraction with a mixture of ammonia in ethyl acetate and overhead shaking without SPE clean-up. The optimised method with a twofold sample extraction was validated according to Commission Decision 2002/657/EC in a matrix-comprehensive in-house validation supported by the InterVal software, taking into account the defined MRLs and recommended concentrations. The validated method can be used for residue control of the above-mentioned analytes in bovine and porcine kidney of food-producing animals in accordance with Council Directive 96/23/EC.", 
    "217": "Two stability-indicating chromatographic methods are described for simultaneous determination of amiloride hydrochloride (AMI), atenolol (ATE), and chlorthalidone (CHL) in combined dosage forms. The first method was based on HPTLC separation of the three drugs followed by densitometric measurements of their bands at 274 nm. The separation was carried out on Merck HPTLC silica gel 60F254 aluminum sheets using chloroform-methanol-ammonia 27%, w/w (9 + 2 + 0.3, v/v/v) mobile phase. Analysis data was used for the linear regression graph in the range of 0.1-0.5, 0.8-5.0, and 0.3-1.5 microg/band for AMI, ATE, and CHL, respectively. The second method was based on an RP-HPLC separation of the cited drugs performed on an RP stainless steel C18 analytical column (250 x 4.6 mm id) with a gradient elution system of methanol and 0.05 M aqueous phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 4 as the mobile phase, at the flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Quantitation was achieved with photodiode array detection at 275 nm for AMI and 225 nm for ATE and CHL. The calibration graphs for each drug were rectilinear in the range of 2-50, 25-150, and 2-100 microg/mL for AMI, ATE, and CHL, respectively. The proposed chromatographic methods were successfully applied for determination of the investigated drugs in pharmaceutical preparations. Both methods were validated in compliance with International Conference on Harmonization guidelines in terms of linearity, accuracy, precision, robustness, LOD, and LOQ.",

    "219": "Constitutive activation of STAT3 is frequently observed and closely linked with proliferation, survival, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis in tumor cells. In the present study, we investigated whether \u03b2-caryophyllene oxide (CPO), a sesquiterpene isolated primarily from the essential oils of medicinal plants such as guava (Psidium guajava), and oregano (Origanum vulgare L.), can mediate its effect through interference with the STAT3 activation pathway in cancer cells. The effect of CPO on STAT3 activation, associated protein kinases and phosphatase, STAT3-regulated gene products and apoptosis was investigated using both functional proteomics tumor pathway technology platform and different tumor cell lines. We found that CPO suppressed constitutive STAT3 activation in multiple myeloma (MM), breast and prostate cancer cell lines, with a significant dose- and time-dependent effects observed in MM cells. The suppression was mediated through the inhibition of activation of upstream kinases c-Src and JAK1/2. Also, vanadate treatment reversed CPO-induced down-regulation of STAT3, suggesting the involvement of a tyrosine phosphatase. Indeed, we found that CPO induced the expression of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 that correlated with the down-regulation of constitutive STAT3 activation. Interestingly, deletion of SHP-1 gene by siRNA abolished the ability of CPO to inhibit STAT3 activation. The inhibition of STAT3 activation by CPO inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis and abrogated the invasive potential of tumor cells. Our results suggest for the first time that CPO is a novel blocker of STAT3 signaling cascade and thus has an enormous potential for the treatment of various cancers harboring constitutively activated STAT3.",

    "224": "Landiolol (Onoact(\u00ae)) is an intravenously administered, ultra short-acting \u03b21-blocker with an elimination half-life of 3-4 min and \u22488-fold greater cardioselectivity than esmolol in vitro. It is approved in Japan for the treatment of intraoperative and postoperative tachyarrhythmias, but in clinical practice is also used to prevent postoperative tachyarrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting. Randomized controlled trials in patients undergoing open-heart surgery demonstrated that various dosages of landiolol (0.0005-0.04 mg/kg/min) [0.5-40 \u03bcg/kg/min] were more effective than diltiazem in converting postoperative atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm during the first 8 h after surgery, and were more effective than placebo (or no landiolol) in preventing the development of atrial fibrillation during the first week after surgery (primary efficacy endpoints). In patients undergoing surgical procedures, landiolol 0.125 mg/kg/min for 1 min followed by 0.04 mg/kg/min for 10 min was superior to placebo in improving intraoperative tachycardia in randomized double-blind trials. The beneficial effects of landiolol in attenuating adverse haemodynamic or other changes that can occur during surgery or invasive procedures (e.g. percutaneous coronary intervention) have been demonstrated in a large number of randomized controlled trials. For example, several studies showed that landiolol attenuated the increase in heart rate associated with tracheal intubation, without adversely affecting blood pressure or other haemodynamic parameters. Landiolol was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with a relatively low risk of hypotension and bradycardia, although routine monitoring of cardiac function during landiolol administration is important. In general, adverse events such as reduced blood pressure resolve quickly after discontinuation of landiolol. Thus, as an ultra short-acting \u03b21-blocker with a rapid onset of action and readily titratable and rapidly reversible effects, landiolol represents an important agent for the management of intraoperative and postoperative tachyarrhythmias.",
