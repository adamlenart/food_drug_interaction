The combination of nemaline myopathy and cardiomyopathy is rare, and this is the first reported case of dilated cardiomyopathy associated with childhood-onset nemaline myopathy. A novel mutation, p.W358C, in ACTA1 was detected in this patient. An unusual feature of this case was that the patient's cardiac failure developed during early childhood with no delay of gross motor milestones. The use of a \u03b2-blocker did not improve his clinical course, and the patient died 6 months after diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy. Congenital nonprogressive nemaline myopathy is not necessarily a benign disorder: deterioration can occur early in the course of dilated cardiomyopathy with neuromuscular disease, and careful clinical evaluation is therefore necessary.",

However, the physiological relevance of AC-AKAP5 binding is largely unexplored. We now show that postsynaptic targeting of AC by AKAP5 is important for phosphorylation of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluA1 on Ser-845 by PKA and for synaptic plasticity. Phosphorylation of GluA1 on Ser-845 is strongly reduced (by 70%) under basal conditions in AKAP5 KO mice but not at all in D36 mice, in which the PKA binding site of AKAP5 (i.e. the C-terminal 36 residues) has been deleted without affecting AC association with GluA1. The increase in Ser-845 phosphorylation upon \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation is much more severely impaired in AKAP5 KO than in D36 mice. In parallel, long term potentiation induced by a 5-Hz/180-s tetanus, which mimics the endogenous \u03b8-rhythm and depends on \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation, is only modestly affected in acute forebrain slices from D36 mice but completely abrogated in AKAP5 KO mice. Accordingly, anchoring of not only PKA but also AC by AKAP5 is important for regulation of postsynaptic functions and specifically AMPA receptor activity.", 
    "15": "Educational campaigns and legislative actions may have led to an overall decrease in the prevalence of volatile substance misuse (VSM) in many countries; however, it is still a common practice throughout the world. Studies currently suggest that girls are misusing volatile substances more than before and at a prevalence rate equal to or exceeding that of boys in several countries. Products that may be misused are ubiquitous and relatively easy to acquire. The most commonly misused substances in recent studies are fuels such as butane or petrol and compressed gas dusters and deodorants that may contain fluorocarbons and/or butane. Detection of VSM is challenging, therefore physicians must maintain a high level of suspicion based on history and clinical presentation. Clues to misuse are often subtle and may include the patient's proximity to a volatile substance or paraphernalia when found intoxicated, dermal burns, blisters, pigments, or rashes, and chemical odors. The primary targets of toxicity are the brain and the heart. The leading cause of death from VSM is from ventricular dysrhythmias. Treatment of toxicity begins with support of airway, breathing, and circulation. Exogenous catecholamines should be avoided if possible due to the theoretical \"sensitized\" and irritable myocardium. In the case of ventricular dysrhythmias, direct current defibrillation and/or beta-adrenergic receptor antagonism should be used. New evidence demonstrates the addictive potential of VSM yet effective therapy remains uncertain. Further research is needed in developing methods for preventing, detecting, and treating the harmful effects of VSM.", 
    "16": "Preclinical and epidemiologic evidence supports a possible role for beta-adrenergic blocking drugs (beta-blockers), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in promoting survival after breast cancer. However, these drugs are often used concurrently with aspirin, and there is a growing body of evidence indicating a survival benefit for aspirin. Therefore, we analyzed the use of beta-blockers and ACEIs after a breast cancer diagnosis and their association with breast cancer mortality, both individually, combined with each other, and in combination with aspirin use in the Nurses' Health Study, using updated measures of medication use and Cox proportional hazards models. There were 4,661 women with stages I-III breast cancer included; 292 breast cancer deaths occurred during median follow-up time of 10.5 years. Modeled individually, the multivariable relative risk and 95 % confidence intervals (RR, 95 % CI) for breast cancer death were (0.76, 0.54-1.05) for beta blockers, (0.89, 0.60-1.32) for ACEIs, and (0.46, 0.35-0.60) for aspirin. Modeled simultaneously, the multivariable (RR, 95 % CI) for breast cancer death were (0.83, 0.60-1.16) for beta blockers, (1.00, 0.68-1.46) for ACEIs, and (0.46, 0.35-0.61) for aspirin. We did not see a significant association with beta blockers and survival, but there was a suggestion. Our study was limited in that we could not assess type of beta blocker and the number of events among users was still quite low. We found no evidence of a protective effect for ACEIs. The strong protective association with aspirin use confounds the associations with these other drugs and underscores the importance of considering aspirin use in analyses of breast cancer survival.",

A liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) method was developed and validated for the determination of bisoprolol, ramipril and simvastatin. Whole blood spiked with target analytes was used to produce 30 \u03bcl blood spots on specimen collection cards. An 8mm disc was cut from the dried blood spot and extracted using methanol: water (70:30, v/v) containing the internal standard, atenolol. Extracts were vortexed, sonicated and then centrifuged.

MS detection was carried out in electrospray positive ion mode for the three target drugs and for the IS. Drug recoveries from spiked blood spots were \u2265 92% for bisoprolol and ramipril and ~43% for simvastatin and the drugs were stable in DBS for at least 12 weeks. Validation of the LC-HRMS method showed good linearity and the accuracy (relative error) and precision (coefficient of variation) values were within the pre-defined limits of \u2264 15% at all concentrations. Matrix effects and the effects of different volumes of blood applied to the collection card were investigated. The LC-HRMS method successfully identified control volunteers who were known to be either adherent or non-adherent. There were no false positives from volunteers taking other cardiovascular drugs or from volunteers receiving no medication.",

Recent findings suggest that activation of \u03b23-adrenoceptors causes DSM relaxation. However, it is unknown whether the \u03b23-adrenoceptor-mediated DSM relaxation is BK channel-dependent during nerve-evoked contractions. To test this hypothesis, we induced nerve-evoked contractions in rat DSM isolated strips by using a tissue bath system equipped with platinum electrodes for electrical field stimulation (EFS). (\u00b1)-(R(*),R(*))-[4-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl]phenoxy] acetic acid sodium hydrate (BRL37344), a \u03b23-adrenoceptor agonist, significantly decreased the amplitude and muscle force of the 20 Hz EFS-induced DSM contractions in a concentration-dependent manner.

We further isolated the cholinergic from the purinergic component of the 0.5-50 Hz EFS-induced DSM contractions by using selective inhibitors, atropine as well as suramin and \u03b1,\u03b2-methylene-ATP. We found that BRL37344 inhibited both the purinergic and cholinergic components of the nerve-evoked contractions in rat DSM isolated strips. The pharmacological blockade of the BK channels with iberiotoxin, a selective BK channel inhibitor, increased the amplitude and muscle force of the 20 Hz EFS-induced contractions in rat DSM isolated strips. In the presence of iberiotoxin, there was a significant reduction in the BRL37344-induced inhibition of the 20 Hz EFS-induced contractions in rat DSM isolated strips.

No immediate risk for acute toxic effects of these compounds on P. tricornutum were apparent at the concentrations observed in the Belgian marine environment. In two Belgian coastal harbours however, a potential chronic risk was observed for the \u03b2-blocker propranolol. No additional risks arising from the exposure to mixtures of pharmaceuticals present in the sampling area could be detected. However, as risk characterization ratios for mixtures of up to 0.5 were observed, mixture effects could emerge should more compounds be taken into account.",

Outbursts of anger are associated with an abrupt increase in cardiovascular events; however, it remains unknown whether greater levels of anger intensity are associated with greater levels of AMI risk or whether potentially modifiable factors can mitigate the short-term risk of AMI. We conducted a case-crossover analysis of 3,886 participants from the multicenter Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study, who were interviewed during the index hospitalization for AMI from 1989 to 1996. We compared the observed number and intensity of anger outbursts in the 2 hours preceding AMI symptom onset with its expected frequency according to each patient's control information, defined as the number of anger outbursts in the previous year. Of the 3,886 participants in the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study, 1,484 (38%) reported outbursts of anger in the previous year. The incidence rate of AMI onset was elevated 2.43-fold (95% confidence interval 2.01 to 2.90) within 2 hours of an outburst of anger. The association was consistently stronger with increasing anger intensities (p trend <0.001). In conclusion, the risk of experiencing AMI was more than twofold greater after outbursts of anger compared with at other times, and greater intensities of anger were associated with greater relative risks. Compared with nonusers, regular \u03b2-blocker users had a lower susceptibility to heart attacks triggered by anger, suggesting that some drugs might lower the risk from each anger episode.", 
    "41": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM), otherwise cardiomyopathy,apical ballooning syndrome or broken heart syndrome is a reversible cardiomyopathy, predominantly occurs in post-menopausal women and commonly due to emotional or physical stress. Typically, patients present with chest pain and ST elevation or T wave inversion on their electrocardiogram mimicking acute coronary syndrome, but with normal or non-flow limiting coronary artery disease. Acute dyspnoea, hypotension and even cardiogenic shock may be the presenting feature of this condition. The wall motion abnormalities typically involve akinesia of the apex of the left ventricle with hyperkinesia of the base of the heart. Atypical forms of TCM have also recently been described. An urgent left ventriculogram or echocardiogram is the key investigation to identify this syndrome. Characteristically, there is only a limited release of cardiac enzymes disproportionate to the extent of regional wall motion abnormality. Transient right ventricular dysfunction may occur and is associated with more complications, longer hospitalisation and worse left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Recently, cardiac MRI has been increasingly used to diagnose this condition and to differentiate from acute coronary syndrome in those who have abnormal coronary arteries. Treatment is often supportive, however beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocking agent are being used in routine clinical practice. The syndrome is usually spontaneously reversible and cardiovascular function returns to normal after a few weeks. This review article will elaborate on the pathophysiology, clinical features including the variant forms, latest diagnostic tools, management and prognosis of this condition.",

It is the final common pathway of various systemic diseases and underlying intraocular conditions, with diabetes mellitus being the most frequent cause. Other causes include venous occlusive disease, intraocular surgery, and inflammatory conditions of the posterior segment of the eye. Macular edema is a recognized side effect of various systemic and local medications and requires special consideration among ophthalmologists and other clinicians. Recently, antidiabetic thiazolidinediones have been implicated in the development of macular edema, and a review of the English literature revealed that other systemically administered drugs like fingolimod, recently approved for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, the anticancer agents tamoxifen and the taxanes, as well as niacin and interferons have been reported to cause macular edema. Ophthalmologic pharmaceutical agents, like prostaglandin analogs, epinephrine, timolol, and ophthalmic preparation preservatives have also been reported to cause macular edema as an adverse event. The purpose of this article is to provide a short, balanced overview of the available evidence in this regard. The available data and the possible pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to the development of macular edema are discussed. Possible therapeutic strategies for drug-induced macular edema are also proposed.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and \u03b21-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) gene polymorphisms could affect metoprolol antihypertensive efficacy. However, even for patients with essential hypertension who have the same genotype in CYP2D6 and ADRB1 genes, their response to metoprolol is still different. Recently, we found that antihypertensive effects of metoprolol would be improved by increasing the expression level of myocardial Adrb1 in spontaneously hypertensive rats which had the same genotype. Therefore, we present a hypothesis that the expression level of myocardial ADRB1 could affect the antihypertensive effects, which may be a novel mechanism for interindividual difference in patients with essential hypertension treated by metoprolol.",

These studies have contributed significantly to currently recommended SCIT safety guidelines. Recent surveillance studies indicate stable SR rates, and a possible decline in the incidence of fatal reactions since the implementation of evidence-based safety guidelines. This review will provide a detailed summary of the evidence from surveillance studies for risk factors associated with SCIT reactions, including: uncontrolled asthma, prior systemic reactions, dosing during peak pollen seasons, epinephrine being delayed or not given, dosing or administration errors, inadequate waiting times, reactions occurring more than 30 min after injections, injections given in medically unsupervised settings, concomitant beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) use, and accelerated build-up regimens.",

The current report is designed to dissect the role of TJ0711, a novel \u03b2-blocker with a 1:1 ratio for the \u03b21/\u03b11 blocking activities, in renoprotection in SHR rats. It was noted that TJ0711 possesses similar potency for control of blood pressure as that of Carvedilol. However, TJ0711 is much more potent in terms of protecting SHR rats against hypertension induced renal injury. Specifically, SHR rats treated with 20mg/kg/day of TJ0711 manifested significantly lower levels for urine albumin and total protein. In line with these result, TJ0711 treated rats displayed much less severe pathological changes in the kidneys. Mechanistic studies revealed that TJ0711 improves kidney perfusion during the course of hypertensive insult by enhancing eNOS expression through suppressing inflammatory cytokine secretion. TJ0711 also attenuates Vasohibin-1 expression to prevent HIF-1\u03b1 from signal-induced degradation, and by which it promotes HO-1 expression to protect SHR rats against oxidative stress induced by hypertension in the kidneys. Together, our data suggest that TJ0711 possesses higher potency for renoprotection while manifesting the similar effect on hypertension therapy as Carvedilol.",

In the present study, we investigated thermal dependence of cholinergic and adrenergic cardiovascular tone in embryonic American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) and assessed possible phenotypic plasticity in a chronic hypoxic incubation treatment. We compared changes in heart rate (f H) and mean arterial blood pressure (P M) for chronically hypoxic and normoxic-incubated embryos after cholinergic and adrenergic blockade following three different acute temperature treatments: (1) 30\u00a0\u00b0C (control incubation temperature), (2) acute, progressive decrease 30-24\u00a0\u00b0C then held at 24\u00a0\u00b0C, and (3) acute, progressive increase 30-36\u00a0\u00b0C then held at 36\u00a0\u00b0C. f H progressively fell in response to decreasing temperature and rose in response to increasing temperature. P M did not significantly change with decreasing temperature, but was lowered significantly with increasing acute temperature in the normoxic group at 90\u00a0% of development only. Propranolol administration (\u03b2 adrenergic antagonist) produced a significant f H decrease at 24, 30, and 36\u00a0\u00b0C that was similar at all temperatures for all groups. For normoxic-incubated embryos at 90\u00a0% of development, atropine administration (cholinergic antagonist) significantly increased f H in both 24 and 36\u00a0\u00b0C treatments, but not in the 30\u00a0\u00b0C control treatment. This atropine response at 24 and 36\u00a0\u00b0C demonstrated acute thermally dependent cholinergic tone on f H late in development for normoxic-incubated, but not chronically hypoxic-incubated embryos. Collectively, data indicated that cardiovascular control mechanisms in embryonic alligators may be activated by thermal extremes, and the maturation of control mechanisms was delayed by chronic hypoxia.",

Characterization of the modified electrode was carried out by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). A strategy based on experimental design was followed. Operating conditions were improved with central composite rotatable design (CCRD) and response surface methodology (RSM), involving several chemical and instrumental parameters. Then second order data were built from variable pulse heights of DPV and after correction in potential shift analyzed by MCR-ALS. Analytical parameters such as linearity, repeatability, and stability were also investigated and a detection limit (DL) of 0.19 and 0.29 \u03bcM for Bet and Ate was achieved, respectively.

    "70": "Right ventricular failure (RVF) is the most frequent cause of death in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); however, specific therapies targeted to treat RVF have not been developed. Chronic treatment with carvedilol has been shown to reduce established maladaptive right ventricle (RV) hypertrophy and to improve RV function in experimental PAH. However, the mechanisms by which carvedilol improves RVF are unknown. We have previously demonstrated by microarray analysis that RVF is characterized by a distinct gene expression profile when compared with functional, compensatory hypertrophy. We next sought to identify the effects of carvedilol on gene expression on a genome-wide basis. PAH and RVF were induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by the combination of VEGF-receptor blockade and chronic hypoxia. After RVF was established, rats were treated with carvedilol or vehicle for 4 wk. RNA was isolated from RV tissue and hybridized for microarray analysis. An initial prediction analysis of carvedilol-treated RVs showed that the gene expression profile resembled the RVF prediction set. However, a more extensive analysis revealed a small group of genes differentially expressed after carvedilol treatment. Further analysis categorized these genes in pathways involved in cardiac hypertrophy, mitochondrial dysfunction, and protein ubiquitination. Genes encoding proteins in the cardiac hypertrophy and protein ubiquitination pathways were downregulated in the RV by carvedilol, while genes encoding proteins in the mitochondrial dysfunction pathway were upregulated by carvedilol. These gene expression changes may explain some of the mechanisms that underlie the functional improvement of the RV after carvedilol treatment.", 
    "71": "It is shown that the heart rate (HR) is a predictor of the general and cardiovascular death rate. Ivabradine, being the If current inhibitor, induces a selective reduction in the HR and produces related positive effects on the course of basic cardiovascular diseases including ischemic heart disease, arterial hypertension, chronic heart failure, atherosclerosis, etc. Ivabradine is the powerful antiischemic and antianginal drug that acts by means of selective HR decrease. It can be used both in monotherapy and in a combination with beta-adrenoblockers. Ivabradine improves the function of left ventricule at chronic heart failure, increases stroke volume, and maintains cardiac output on a higher level. It optimises the energy consumption by myocardium and reduces heart electrophysiological and structural remodeling at patients with chronic heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The drug also produces a pronounced antiatherogenic effect.", 
    "72": "Many studies have reported that there is no significant difference in survival rate between rhythm control and rate control strategies in combination of with anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation. Even in patients with atrial fibrillation and with heart failure there is no significant difference in survival rate between both strategies. There is no need of strict rate control. In patients with permanent atrial fibrillation, lemient rate control(resting heart rate of below 110 beats per minute) is as effective as strict rate control (< 70 beats per minute) and easier to achieve. Digitalis, beta-blockers and Ca channel blockers are used for rate control treatments. Digitalis is the only drug that has both decreasing ventricular response by suppressing atrioventricular conduction and inotropic effects. However, digitalis can not suppress heart rates during exercise. Beta-blockers and Ca channel blockers can suppress heart rates not only at rest but also during exercise. Ca channel blockers can not be used for patients with heart failure due to reduction in contractility of heart muscle. It has been reported that cardiac function and survival rate can be improved by beta-blockers in patients with heart failure if starting low dose and increasing gradually.", 
    "73": "Although several recent studies have reported that GPCRs adopt multiple conformations, it remains unclear how subtle conformational changes are translated into divergent downstream responses. In this study, we report on a novel class of FRET-based sensors that can detect the ligand/mutagenic stabilization of GPCR conformations that promote interactions with G proteins in live cells. These sensors rely on the well characterized interaction between a GPCR and the C terminus of a G\u03b1 subunit. We use these sensors to elucidate the influence of the highly conserved (E/D)RY motif on GPCR conformation. Specifically, Glu/Asp but not Arg mutants of the (E/D)RY motif are known to enhance basal GPCR signaling. Hence, it is unclear whether ionic interactions formed by the (E/D)RY motif (ionic lock) are necessary to stabilize basal GPCR states. We find that mutagenesis of the \u03b22-AR (E/D)RY ionic lock enhances interaction with Gs. However, only Glu/Asp but not Arg mutants increase G protein activation. In contrast, mutagenesis of the opsin (E/D)RY ionic lock does not alter its interaction with transducin. Instead, opsin-specific ionic interactions centered on residue Lys-296 are both necessary and sufficient to promote interactions with transducin. Effective suppression of \u03b22-AR basal activity by inverse agonist ICI 118,551 requires ionic interactions formed by the (E/D)RY motif. In contrast, the inverse agonist metoprolol suppresses interactions with Gs and promotes Gi binding, with concomitant pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. Taken together, these studies validate the use of the new FRET sensors while revealing distinct structural mechanisms for ligand-dependent GPCR function.",

The etiology of PBC is undefined, but immunologic and environmental disturbances may contribute to the disease. Infertility is often associated with PBC and cirrhosis, but pregnancy may well occur in women with PBC and without cirrhosis or in some others with compensated cirrhosis. A pluridisciplinary approach including gastroenterologists and obstetricians is recommended. The patient must be closely monitored throughout her pregnancy with maternal and routine antenatal care. Medical treatment requires ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). In non-cirrhotic UDCA-treated women with PBC, pregnancy often follows a normal course with vaginal delivery. In cirrhotic patients, UDCA must be continued during pregnancy, esophageal and gastric varices must be evaluated before pregnancy, and endoscopic ligature is recommended for treating large varices. Additionally, beta-blocker therapy may be associated, especially when variceal rupture occurred previously. Elective cesarean section is recommended in patients with large esophageal or gastric varices because of the potentially increased risk of variceal bleeding during maternal expulsive efforts in case of vaginal delivery.",

It has a low oral bioavailability that is speculated to be due to its hepatic first-pass metabolism. Inflammation is known to suppress the clearance of drugs with efficient hepatic metabolism. However, inflammation does not influence nebivolol clearance. Therefore, we looked into the mechanism involved in the drug's low bioavailability and stereoselectivity. Single 1 mg/kg i.v. or intraperitoneal (i.p.) or 2 mg/kg oral doses were administered to male Sprague-Dawley rats and the plasma nebivolol concentration was measured using chiral and achiral assays. The passage of nebivolol enantiomers through the gut was also measured using everted rat sacs. The serum protein binding of the enantiomers was studied in vitro using the ultrafiltration method. Plasma nebivolol concentrations were significantly lower after p.o., but not after i.p., compared with i.v. doses suggesting the gut as the site of pre-systemic loss. Approximately 50% of the enantiomers were lost during 90 min incubation in the presence of gut. Only 0.1% of the added drug crossed the gut wall with no evidence of stereoselectivity. Thus stereoselectivity in the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol (+ > -) is likely at the level of plasma protein binding. The low nebivolol bioavailability is due to its loss in the gut as well as its limited permeability through the intestinal wall.",

Five cationic model drugs (dextromethorphan, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, propranolol and salbutamol) were loaded into PSNIE. The loading capacity, release and release kinetics of the exchangers were investigated. PSNIE were successfully prepared by electrospinning and were allowed to crosslink for 10 min, resulting in a maximum IEC of 2.86\u00b10.1 meq/g dry PSNIE. The diameter of the fibers after sulfonation was 464\u00b135 nm.

HPLC methods have been reported to include 0.6-26 min as the run times and 0.01 ng/mL to 25 \u00b5g/mL as detection limits. The most commonly used columns were C18 with various buffers as the mobile phases, along with various organic modifiers. The optimization of HPLC conditions has been discussed. It has been observed that the reported methods are quite satisfactory for the analyses of \u03b2-adrenergic blockers in biological samples. Future perspectives in the hyphenation of solid-phase microextraction-nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry have also been highlighted to achieve detections at nanogram and picogram levels.

    "116": "The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is the major site for termination of visceral sensory afferents contributing to homeostatic regulation of, for example, arterial pressure, gastric motility, and breathing. Whereas much is known about how different neuronal populations influence these functions, information about the role of glia remains scant. In this article, we propose that glia may contribute to NTS functions by modulating excitatory neurotransmission. We found that acidification (pH 7.0) depolarizes NTS glia by inhibiting K(+)-selective membrane currents. NTS glia also showed functional expression of voltage-sensitive glutamate transporters, suggesting that extracellular acidification regulates synaptic transmission by compromising glial glutamate uptake. To test this hypothesis, we evoked glutamatergic slow excitatory potentials (SEPs) in NTS neurons with repetitive stimulation (20 pulses at 10 Hz) of the solitary tract. This SEP depends on accumulation of glutamate following repetitive stimulation, since it was potentiated by blocking glutamate uptake with dl-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartic acid (TBOA) or a glia-specific glutamate transport blocker, dihydrokainate (DHK). Importantly, extracellular acidification (pH 7.0) also potentiated the SEP. This effect appeared to be mediated through a depolarization-induced inhibition of glial transporter activity, because it was occluded by TBOA and DHK. In agreement, pH 7.0 did not directly alter d-aspartate-induced responses in NTS glia or properties of presynaptic glutamate release. Thus acidification-dependent regulation of glial function affects synaptic transmission within the NTS. These results suggest that glia play a modulatory role in the NTS by integrating local tissue signals (such as pH) with synaptic inputs from peripheral afferents.",

One might expect highly selective antagonists are available for the human \u03b2-adrenoceptor subtype involved in these diseases, yet few truly \u03b21-selective molecules exist. To address this clinical need, we re-evaluated LK 204-545 (1), (1) a selective \u03b21-adrenoceptor antagonist, and discovered it possessed significant partial agonism. Removal of 1's aromatic nitrile afforded 19, a ligand with similar \u03b21-adrenoceptor selectivity and partial agonism (log KD of -7.75 and -5.15 as an antagonist of functional \u03b21- and \u03b22-mediated responses, respectively, and 34% of the maximal response of isoprenaline (\u03b21)). In vitro \u03b2-adrenoceptor selectivity and partial agonism of 19 were mirrored in vivo. We designed analogues of 19 to improve affinity, selectivity, and partial agonism. Although partial agonism could not be fully attenuated, SAR suggests that an extended alkoxyalkoxy side chain, alongside substituents at the meta- or para-positions of the phenylurea, increases ligand affinity and \u03b21-selectivity.",

In case of dissolution, an inverse relationship was noted between amount of xanthan gum and release rate of propranolol HCl and the drug release was gradually enhanced as the amount of the lactose increased. The direct release was observed between swelling index and xanthan gum concentration. Significant difference in different media was observed in release profile, indicating that propranolol HCI has better solubility in HCI buffer pH 1.2. Moreover, dissolution data at differing stirring speeds was also analyzed, indicating that the drug release profile was at 50 rpm comparative to 100 rpm. The kinetic treatment showed the best fitted different mathematical models (zero order, first order, Higuchi's, Hixson-Crowell and Korsmeyer Peppas model.

We compared the effect of contrasted sodium diets on the pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of 8 mg candesartan cilexetil, 160 mg valsartan, 10 mg ramipril, and 50 mg atenolol administered to 64 (16 per group) normotensive male subjects randomly assigned to sodium depletion (SD) or sodium repletion (SR) in a crossover study. Pharmacodynamic response was assessed as the increase in plasma renin concentration for renin-angiotensin system blockers and electrocardiographic changes in PR interval duration for atenolol. The area under the curve (AUC) for plasma candesartan and atenolol concentrations was significantly lower for SR than for SD (respective ratios of AUC0-\u221e: 0.74; [90% CI, 0.66-0.82] and 0.69 [90% CI, 0.54-0.88], respectively), indicating a lack of bioequivalence between SR and SD. SR did not affect the pharmacokinetics of valsartan or ramipril. The increase in plasma renin concentration with the 3 renin-angiotensin system blockers was 10 times lower during the SR than the SD period. In the multiple regression analysis, the AUC0-24 of plasma drug concentration explained <1% and 21% of the variance of the AUC0-24 of delta plasma renin concentration for candesartan (P=0.8882/P=0.0368) during the SR and SD periods, respectively. The atenolol-induced lengthening of PR interval was fully reversed by SR. Thus, sodium balance modulates the pharmacokinetics of candesartan cilexetil and atenolol, with measurable effects on the selected pharmacodynamic end points.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ranolazine and propranolol when administered either alone or combined prior to I/R induction in a pig model. Thirty domestic pigs were randomly assigned to five groups of six animals including (i) sham animals; (ii) untreated animals with 45-min ischemia and 1-min reperfusion; animals administered intravenously with (iii) ranolazine, or (iv) propranolol, or (v) both combined, prior to 45-min ischemia and 1-min reperfusion. The heart rate (HR), duration of monophasic action potentials (dMAP), and peak of the time derivative of left ventricular pressure (LV dP/dt max) were measured during ischemia and after 1 min of reperfusion. Structural and functional parameters of mitochondria were analyzed in tissue samples taken from the left ventricle ischemic area at the end of the experiment. I/R induced expected effects, namely accelerated HR, decreased dMAP and LV dP/dt max, and altered mitochondrial structural and functional parameters including decreased oxygen consumption, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and reduced calcium retention capacity resulting in the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTP). Ranolazine and propranolol administered either alone or combined prior to I/R significantly decreased all of these deleterious consequences. The protective effects of ranolazine and propranolol are seemingly due to the prevention of calcium overload and resulting lesions in mitochondria.",

Four patients with a documented history of cardiac disease and one patient with unknown cardiac issues experienced severe respiratory distress and presented with pulmonary edema; the local emergency medical service was utilized. In all of the patients, the saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2) was severely low, and the patients were rapidly treated with oxygen, diuretics, morphine, and nitrates. However, only a small increase in oxygen saturation was observed. Intravenous atenolol was administered and led to a dramatic increase in SpO2.

Different ratios of Compritol(\u00ae)888 ATO versus MPL were utilized and the effect of various formulation methods was evaluated to sustain the release of MPL. MPL: Compritol(\u00ae)888 ATO in 1:2 ratio could successfully retard the release of MPL. Melt granulation method \"as hot process\" was found to be effective when compared to direct compression and wet granulation. The in vitro release characteristics of tablets were studied in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer at 50 rpm using USP Type II apparatus. Formulation F7 retarded MPL release with ~90% release after 20 h.

    "164": "Kidney transplanted patients are often treated with immunosuppressive, antihypertensive, and antibiotic drugs such as cyclosporine A (CsA), \u03b2-blockers, and fluoroquinolones, respectively. Organic cation transporters (OCT) expressed in the basolateral membrane of proximal tubules represent an important drug excretion route. In this work, the renal expression of OCT after syngeneic and allogeneic kidney transplantation in rats with or without CsA immunosuppression was studied. Moreover, the interactions of CsA, \u03b2-blockers (pindolol/atenolol), and fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin/norfloxacin) with rOCT1, rOCT2, hOCT1, and hOCT2 in stably transfected HEK293-cells were studied. Kidney transplantation was associated with reduced expression of rOCT1, while rOCT2 showed only reduced expression after allogeneic transplantation. All drugs interacted subtype- and species-dependently with OCT. However, only atenolol, pindolol, and ofloxacin were transported by hOCT2, the main OCT in human kidneys. While CsA is not an OCT substrate, it exerts a short-term effect on OCT activity, changing their affinity for some substrates. In conclusion, appropriate drug dosing in transplanted patients is difficult partly because OCT are down-regulated and because concomitant CsA treatment may influence the affinity of the transporters. Moreover, drug-drug competition at the transporter can also alter drug excretion rate.", 
    "165": "Evidence-based animal experimental research concerning the effects of acupuncture on autonomic function was performed by two research teams from China and Austria. This study describes measurements in beagles. Heart rate variability (HRV) recordings were performed under stable conditions in Beijing, China, and the data analysis and interpretation were completed in Graz, Austria. The electrocardiograms were recorded during bilateral body acupuncture (PC6, Neiguan). Power of the low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and the ratio (LF/HF) changed significantly during acupuncture stimulation in beagles after injection of atropine and \u03b2 -blocker. However, there was no significant change in HF power after needling the Neiguan acupoint when a cervical vagotomy has been performed. Our findings show that acupuncture can mediate the HRV even after pharmaceutical blocking of autonomic function. Acupuncture effects on HRV should rely not only on autonomic nervous system but on complete central nervous system.", 
    "166": "Sublingual administration of certain buffered propranolol may improve the rate and extent of absorption compared to oral administration. The main objectives of this study were to (1) compare the plasma propranolol concentrations (Cp-prop) following sublingual administration of a specially buffered formulation (Promptol\u2122) to that following oral administration of Inderal(\u00ae) and (2) evaluate the utility of a special pharmacokinetic model in describing the Cp-prop following sublingual administration. Eighteen healthy volunteers received 10\u00a0mg sublingual Promptol\u2122 or oral Inderal(\u00ae). Multiple Cp-prop were determined and their pharmacokinetics compared. Additional data following sublingual 40\u00a0mg Promptol\u2122 or Inderal(\u00ae) were utilized for evaluation of a special advanced compartmental absorption and transit (ACAT) model. For model simulation, the physicochemical parameters were imported from AMET predictor, whereas the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated and optimized by Gastroplus(\u00ae). Based on this model, the quantity of drug absorbed via buccal/sublingual mucosa was estimated. Cp-prop was higher at earlier times with 3-fold greater relative bioavailability following sublingual Promptol\u2122 compared to that from oral Inderal(\u00ae). The special ACAT model provided excellent goodness of fit of Cp-prop-time curve and estimated a 56.6% increase in absorption rate from Promptol\u2122 and higher initial Cp-prop compared to the regular formulation. The modified ACAT model provided a useful approach to describe sublingual absorption of propranolol and clearly demonstrated an improvement of absorption of Promptol\u2122. The sublingual 10\u00a0mg Promptol\u2122 achieved not only a similar systemic exposure as 30\u00a0mg oral Inderal(\u00ae) but an earlier effective Cp-prop which may be advantageous for certain clinical conditions.", 
    "167": "Anxiolytic-like effects of dietary flavonoids are relatively well known. Ellagic acid is a naturally occurring flavonoid compound which is abundant in many plants and fruits. The present study was designed to investigate the antianxiety-like effect of ellagic acid in mice using an elevated plus-maze test. The involvement of the GABAergic and serotonergic systems in the antianxiety-like activity of ellagic acid was also studied. Our results showed that ellagic acid treatment (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.), produced a significant increase in the percentage of time spent and entry into the open arms, with a profile comparable to that of diazepam (1 mg/kg, p.o.). Unlike diazepam, the anxiolytic doses of ellagic acid did not prolong the duration of sodium thiopental-induced loss of righting reflex, indicating that this flavonoid is non-hypnotic. The anxiolytic effect observed with ellagic acid treatment (25 mg/kg, p.o.) was antagonized by pretreatment with picrotoxin (a non-competitive GABAA receptor antagonist, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) and flumazenil (a benzodiazepine site antagonist, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) but not with p-chlorophenylalanine (a serotonin synthesis inhibitor, 100 mg/kg, i.p.) and pindolol (a \u03b2-adrenoceptors blocker/5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonist, 10 mg/kg, i.p.). Taken together, the data demonstrated that acute and chronic administration of ellagic acid to mice has produced antianxiety-like effect when tested in the elevated plus-maze. The experiments with different receptor blockers suggest an involvement of GABAergic system in the anxiolytic action of this bioflavonoid. However, this action is not seems to be mediated through serotonergic system.", 
    "168": "Nitric oxide is implicated in the target action of Nebivolol, a selective \u03b21 adrenoceptor blocker used in hypertension treatment. As the Nitric Oxide (NO) production and the actin cytoskeleton are linked, the aim of this work was to study the involvement of actin cytoskeleton on mechanism of action of Nebivolol in cultured endothelial cells. We studied the effect of Nebivolol (200 \u03bcM) on actin filaments remodeling and its impact on NO production and eNOS activation. Results showed that Nebivolol perturbs actin filaments polymerization, increases NO production and eNOS activity between 30 minutes and 1 h. Stabilization of actin filaments with phallo\u00efdine (50 \u03bcM) abolishes Nebivolol effects on eNOS activation and NO production. Furthermore, Rho-kinase activity decreased during the first hour of Nebivolol treatment, then increased after 3 h, while actin filaments repolymerized, eNOS activation and NO production decreased. In SMCs, Nebivolol induced a decrease in the Rho-kinase activity from 1 h until 24 h of incubation. In conclusion, we suggest that Nebivolol induced NO production in Endothelial Cells (ECs) via complementary actions between actin cytoskeleton remodeling inducing eNOS activation and Rho-kinase implication. The effect of Nebivolol on ECs occurs during the first hour, this effect on SMCs seems to be maintained until 24 h, explaining persisted action of Nebivolol observed in vivo.",

Propranolol may have a potential role in its treatment, since it leads to regression or stabilization of cutaneous infantile hemangiomas. To date, only 4 previous case reports (7 patients) in which propranolol was used for AH have been published. Based on encouraging preliminary data on propranolol use for AH treatment, our goal was to further investigate propranolol as an effective initial treatment of upper AHs that cause significant obstruction symptoms. In this retrospective case series, we reviewed the medical records of 5 consecutive pediatric patients with AH (glottic and subglottic) treated with propranolol at a tertiary care children's hospital. All 5 patients were 2 months of age at the time of hemangioma diagnosis and had stridor and physical signs of severe upper airway obstruction. Hemangioma was diagnosed by flexible laryngoscopy or flexible bronchoscopy. All patients received propranolol 2 mg/kg/day and showed significant relief of obstruction symptoms within 24 hours of treatment initiation.

However, an episode occurred a few weeks after discontinuation and brimonidine 0.2%-timolol 0.5% therapy was ruled out as a cause. Despite the benefit, off-label use of brimonidine 0.2%-timolol 0.5% therapy served as a pitfall in the evaluation of an unusual constellation of worrisome symptoms. In conclusion, brimonidine 0.2%-timolol 0.5% therapy is a promising alternative in the topical treatment of haemangiomas.

    "194": "A sympathetic shift in heart rate variability (HRV) from high to lower frequencies may be an early signal of deterioration in a monitored patient. Most chronic heart failure (CHF) patients receive \u03b2-blockers. This tends to obscure HRV observation by increasing the fast variations. We tested which HRV parameters would still detect the change into a sympathetic state.", 
    "195": "\u03b2-blocker (Carvedilol\u00ae) treated CHF patients underwent a protocol of 10 min supine rest, followed by 10 min active standing. CHF patients (NYHA Class II-IV) n = 15, 10m/5f, mean age 58.4 years (47-72); healthy controls n = 29, 18m/11f, mean age 62.9 years (49-78). Interbeat intervals (IBI) were extracted from the finger blood pressure wave (Nexfin\u00ae). Both linear and non-linear HRV analyses were applied that (1) might be able to differentiate patients from healthy controls under resting conditions and (2) detect the change into a sympathetic state in the present short recordings. Linear: mean-IBI, SD-IBI, root mean square of successive differences (rMSSD), pIBI-50 (the proportion of intervals that differs by more than 50 ms from the previous), LF, HF, and LF/HF ratio. Non-linear: Sample entropy (SampEn), Multiscale entropy (MSE), and derived: Multiscale variance (MSV) and Multiscale rMSSD (MSD). In the supine resting situation patients differed from controls by having higher HF and, consequently, lower LF/HF. In addition their longer range (\u03c4 = 6-10) MSE was lower as well. The sympathetic shift was, in controls, detected by mean-IBI, rMSSD, pIBI-50, and LF/HF, all going down; in CHF by mean-IBI, rMSSD, pIBI-50, and MSD (\u03c4 = 6-10) going down. MSD6-10 introduced here works as a band-pass filter favoring frequencies from 0.02 to 0.1 Hz.", 
    "196": "In \u03b2-blocker treated CHF patients, traditional time domain analysis (mean-IBI, rMSSD, pIBI-50) and MSD6-10 provide the most useful information to detect a condition change.", 
    "197": "The circulatory system is one of the first systems that develops during embryogenesis. Angiogenesis describes the formation of blood vessels as a part of the circulatory system and is essential for organ growth in embryogenesis as well as repair in adulthood. A dysregulation of vessel growth contributes to the pathogenesis of many disorders. Thus, an imbalance between pro- and antiangiogenic factors could be observed in infantile hemangioma (IH). IH is the most common benign tumor during infancy, which appears during the first month of life. These vascular tumors are characterized by rapid proliferation and subsequently slower involution. Most IHs regress spontaneously, but in some cases they cause disfigurement and systemic complications, which requires immediate treatment. Recently, a therapeutic effect of propranolol on IH has been demonstrated. Hence, this non-selective \u03b2-blocker became the first-line therapy for IH. Over the last years, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of IH has been improved and possible mechanisms of action of propranolol in IH have postulated. Previous studies revealed that gap junction proteins, the connexins (Cx), might also play a role in the pathogenesis of IH. Therefore, affecting gap junctional intercellular communication is suggested as a novel therapeutic target of propranolol in IH. In this review we summarize the current knowledge of the molecular processes, leading to IH and provide new insights of how Cxs might be involved in the development of these vascular tumors.", 
    "198": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a critical role in cognitive functions, including working memory, attention regulation, behavioral inhibition, as well as memory storage. The functions of PFC are very sensitive to norepinephrine (NE), and even low levels of endogenously released NE exert a dramatic influence on the functioning of the PFC. Activation of \u03b2-adrenoceptors (\u03b2-ARs) facilitates synaptic potentiation and enhances memory in the hippocampus. However, little is known regarding these processes in the PFC. In the present study, we investigate the role of \u03b22-AR in synaptic plasticity and behavioral memory. Our results show that \u03b22-AR selective agonist clenbuterol facilitates spike-timing-dependent long-term potentiation (tLTP) under the physiological conditions with intact GABAergic inhibition, and such facilitation is prevented by co-application with the cAMP inhibitor Rp-cAMPS. Loading postsynaptic pyramidal cells with Rp-cAMPS, the PKA inhibitor PKI(5-24), or the G protein inhibitor GDP-\u03b2-S significantly decreases, but does not eliminate, the effect of clenbuterol. Clenbuterol suppresses the GABAergic transmission, while blocking GABAergic transmission by the GABA(A) receptor blocker partially mimics the effect of clenbuterol. In behavioral tests, a post-training infusion of clenbuterol into mPFC enhances 24-h trace fear memory. In summary, we observed that prefrontal cortical \u03b22-AR activation by clenbuterol facilitates tLTP and enhances trace fear memory. The mechanism underlying tLTP facilitation involves stimulating postsynaptic cAMP-PKA signaling cascades and suppressing GABAergic circuit activities.", 
    "199": "In this study, we synthesized eight novel 1-phenyl-2-(4-substituted-piperazin-1-yl)-propanol derivatives and evaluated their antidepressant-like activities. The chemical structures of the synthesised compounds were elucidated by spectroscopy and elemental analyses. Potential antidepressant-like effects of the test compounds (20 mg kg(-1)) were investigated using the tail-suspension test and modified forced swimming test (MFST) in mice. Additionally, the spontaneous locomotor activity of the mice was assessed using the activity cage apparatus. Both the reference drug fluoxetine (20 mg kg(-1)) and the test compounds 3a-3e and 3g significantly shortened the immobility time of the mice in both the behavioural tests. These test compounds also increased the swimming time in MFST without any change in the climbing duration. Compounds 3c-3e and 3g were significantly more potent in inducing these effects than 3a and 3b. None of the compounds changed the locomotor activities of the animals, thus antidepressant-like effects of test compounds were specific. The findings support those of previous studies that reported antidepressant-like activities of aryl alkanol piperazine derivatives.", 
    "200": "The genetic background of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) has been extensively investigated for the last decade in Western countries, but it remains unstudied in the Asian population.", 
    "201": "In 50 Japanese probands from unrelated families who satisfied clinical criteria for CPVT, genetic testing was conducted in all exons on 3 CPVT-related genes: cardiac ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) and inward rectifier potassium channel 2 (KCNJ2), and the clinical features between RYR2-genotyped and -non-genotyped patient groups were compared. Genetic and clinical evaluation was also done in 46 family members. In the genetic screening, 28 (18 novel) RYR2 (56.0%), 1 compound heterozygous CASQ2 (2.0%) and 1 KCNJ2 (2.0%) mutation carriers were identified. In the RYR2 mutation-positive group, the frequency of bidirectional ventricular tachycardia and the use of \u03b2-blockers were significantly higher than in the mutation-negative group. In contrast, there was no significant difference in supraventricular arrhythmias between the 2 groups. With regard to disease penetrance, the number of family members of RYR2-genotyped probands with a clinical diagnosis of CPVT was high.", 
    "202": "Thirty gene mutation carriers were found for 3 genes in 50 probands clinically diagnosed as having CPVT. The penetrance of CPVT phenotype was significantly higher in RYR2 mutation carriers, thus RYR2 gene screening in CPVT patients would be indispensable to prevent unexpected cardiac sudden death of young family members.",

    "206": "Primary outcome was methacholine challenge. Secondary outcomes included histamine challenge, pulmonary function, mini-asthma quality of life questionnaire (mini-AQLQ), and asthma control questionnaire (ACQ). Eighteen patients completed (mean [SEM]): age, 36 (4) yr; FEV1%, 93 (2); ICS, 440 (66) \u03bcg/d. No significant difference was observed in methacholine or histamine challenge after exposure to propranolol versus placebo. For methacholine challenge, the doubling dilution difference was 0.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.56 to 0.63), P = 0.89. Albuterol recovery at 20 minutes after histamine challenge was partially attenuated by propranolol versus placebo: FEV1% mean difference, 5.28 (95% CI, 2.54-8.01), P = 0.001. After chronic \u03b2-blockade there was a small worsening in FEV1 % predicted of 2.4% (95% CI, -0.1 to 4.8), P = 0.055. No difference was found for ACQ or mini-AQLQ.",

In mammals transcription of the ABCB1 gene encoding Pgp is under cAMP/PKA-mediated regulation; whether this is true in mollusks is not fully clarified.", 
    "209": "cAMP/PKA regulation and ABCB mRNA expression were assessed in haemocytes from Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) exposed in vivo for 1 week to 0.3 ng/L fluoxetine (FX) alone or in combination with 0.3 ng/L propranolol (PROP). FX significantly decreased cAMP levels and PKA activity, and induced ABCB mRNA down-regulation. FX effects were abolished in the presence of PROP. In vitro experiments using haemocytes treated with physiological agonists (noradrenaline and serotonin) and pharmacological modulators (PROP, forskolin, dbcAMP, and H89) of the cAMP/PKA system were performed to obtain clear evidence about the involvement of the signaling pathway in the transcriptional regulation of ABCB. Serotonin (5-HT) decreased cAMP levels, PKA activity and ABCB mRNA expression but increased the mRNA levels for a putative 5-HT1 receptor. Interestingly, 5-HT1 was also over-expressed after in vivo exposures to FX. 5-HT effects were counteracted by PROP. Forskolin and dbcAMP increased PKA activity as well as ABCB mRNA expression; the latter effect was abolished in the presence of the PKA inhibitor H89.",
