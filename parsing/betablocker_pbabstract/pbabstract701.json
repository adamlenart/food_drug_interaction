    "0": "The aim of antiarrhythmic drug therapy is to terminate or suppress specific arrhythmias and improve cardiovascular function. Short-term studies of the new Class I drugs encainide, mexilitine, and tocainide have demonstrated only minor falls in cardiac index with modest rises in mean aortic pressure. In contrast, disopyramide has been shown to depress myocardial function in both animals and patient studies. Heart failure may be precipitated by therapy with disopyramide and electromechanical dissociation has been reported. Class II agents with beta-adrenergic blocking actions all produce a degree of myocardial depression. Atenolol resembles propranolol in patients with coronary artery disease in its hemodyanmic effects, whereas acebutolol is less of a depressant, resembling practolol. The Class III agent amiodarone has only a mild depressant effect associated with a reduction in afterload and an increase in coronary blood flow. The Class IV agent verapamil, which is a calcium channel blocker, has potent myocardial depressant actions and causes peripheral vasodilatation. Hypotension, heart failure, and shock have been precipitated particularly in patients receiving beta-blocking drugs concurrently. While all the new antiarrhythmic drugs currently studied will cause some degree of hemodyanmic depression in an appropriately high concentration, present investigations suggest that particular caution needs to be taken when disopyramide, aprindine, atenolol, and verampamil are administered either acutely by the intravenous route or chronically by the oral route.", 
    "1": "This paper describes an inhibitory effect of propranolol on insulin secretion in rats with pancreatic islet cell tumors which have been induced by streptozotocin (65 mg/kg body weight) and nicotinamide (500 mg/kg). Following glucose ingestion (3 g/kg), propranolol (4 mg/kg) was injected into the tumor-bearing rats. Plasma insulin decreased paradoxically despite an increase in blood glucoses. In contrast, propranolol did not suppress insulin secretion in normal rats. The drug was found to have no effect on glucagon secretion in either experimental or control animals during glucose load. This may suggest that the experimentally induced insulinoma in hypersensitive to propranolol for inhibiting insulin secretion.", 
    "2": "At rest supine acute intravenous administration of the combined adrenergic alpha- and beta-receptor blocking compound labetalol (1 mg/kg body weight) to young, healthy, male subjects, produced a clear-cut fall in arterial blood pressure. During dynamic forearm exercise, forearm blood flow decreased by 17.2%, and calculated vascular resistance increased by 11.3% after labetalol. Forearm oxygen uptake decreased (14.6%), suggesting an increased mechanical efficiency. Lactate release from the exercising forearm decreased (17.6%), probably because of the beta-receptor blockade. Forearm uptake of glucose and free fatty acids remained unchanged. Arterial blood glucose concentration attained a higher level after labetalol. Arterial plasma concentration of FFA was reduced during exercise and post-exercise probably because beta-receptor mediated lipolysis was antagonized.", 
    "3": "Doxepin binds to intact astrocytes in primary cultures. The binding is competitively displaceable by excess cold doxepin and it is pronounced (Bmax = 27 nmol/mg protein) but the affinity is rather low (KD = 30 microM). The binding is inhibited by other antidepressants (amitriptyline, desipramine, tranylcypromine, iprindole) and propranolol but not by isoproterenol. Nevertheless, doxepin counteracts effectively the increase in the production of cyclic AMP evoked by isoproterenol.", 
    "4": "Rabbit antibodies induced against alprenolol, a potent beta-adrenergic antagonist, bind to other antagonists, and, with less avidity, to catecholamine agonists. Anti-idiotypic antibodies were raised against the anti-alprenolol immunoglobulins. The anti-idiotypic antibodies specifically bind and agglutinate turkey erythrocytes; this is not observed for human agglutinate turkey erythrocytes; this is not observed for human or sheep erythrocytes, which are devoid of beta-adrenergic receptors. The anti-idiotypic antibodies compete with (--)-[3H]-dihydroalprenolol for binding on the beta-adrenergic receptors on purified turkey erythrocyte membranes. The binding to the membrane-bound receptors is prevented by preincubation of the anti-idiotypic antibodies with their immunogen, the antialprenolol immunoglobulins. The binding to the receptor is not merely passive: the anti-idiotypic antibodies stimulate basal adenylate cyclase activity [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] and enhance adenylate cyclase activation by catecholamine. These observations support the notion that antiidiotypic antibodies may constitute an \"internal image\" of the original antigen and may mimic its biological effects.", 
    "5": "In order to characterize the beta-adrenoceptors coupled to the human fat cell adenylate cyclase more extensively the effects of the beta 2-selective agonist salbutamol on basal and isoproterenol-stimulated rates of cAMP-accumulation were studied. Although exhibiting only low intrinsic activity salbutamol displayed only slightly lower affinity towards the beta-adrenoceptors linked to the human fat cell adenylate cyclase than isoproterenol. In addition, the beta 2-selective antagonist butoxamine was slightly more potent in inhibiting the isoproterenol-stimulated fat cell enzyme than the cardioselective beta-blocking agent practolol. These results further emphasize the difficulties in classifying the lipolytic response of adipose tissue to beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists within a uniform beta-receptor theory.", 
    "6": "1 The effect of drugs acting on beta-adrenoceptors on the absorption and excretion of paracetamol was studied in 26 volunteers and nine patients with mild hypertension, each subject acting as his/her own control. 2 Isoprenaline given 30 min before paracetamol significantly slowed absorption, the effect being dose related, and blocked by prior administration of propranolol. 3 When isoprenaline was given immediately before the paracetamol, absorption was not altered, although a cardiovascular response was seen. 4 Oral salbutamol also delayed paracetamol absorption. 5 Propranolol given alone increased the rate of paracetamol absorption. 6 These results with the changes in the rate of gastric emptying produced by these agents.", 
    "7": "The electrophysiological analysis of the taste total impulse activity of the rat revealed the inhibitory influence of the gastric distention on the salt and sour taste responses to be decreased by cutting of the neck sympathetic nerve and prevented by the propranolol injection into the taste epithelium. Salt and sour taste responses were diminished by the injection of isoproterenol, cAMP, dibutyril--cAMP, and the inhibitors fo phosphodiesterase theophilline and paraverine; the activator of phosphodiesterase nicotine acid increased the taste responses. The finding suggest that the adrenergic transmitters and cAMP take part in the actualization of the inhibitory centrifugal influences.", 
    "8": "The postnatal development of mammalian skeletal muscle is associated with an increased capacity for glycogenolysis. In the present study rabbit skeletal muscle underwent a 7-fold increase in glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase activity over the postnatal period of 0--8 weeks. An enriched fraction of sarcolemma was prepared from neonatal and adult muscle to examine the development of the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase system. Adult membranes possessed a 2-fold greater Na+K+(Mg2+)-ATPase activity and a 6--8 fold greater sodium fluoride- and epinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. The activation ratio (effector activity/basal activity) increased 2--3 fold for epinephrine and sodium fluoride in adult sarcolemma. The activation by catecholamines conformed to the physiological beta 2 type response with isoproterenol (1.8 . 10(-8) M) > epinephrine (1.1 . 10(-7) M) > norinephrine (3.2 . 10(-6) M). In contrast, binding studies employing (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol showed little difference between neonatal and adult membranes with respect to (1) number of binding sites, (2) equilibrium dissociation constant and (3) displacement of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol by catecholamine agonists. Protein and lipid components of the sarcolemma were also modified during development. Neonatal membranes possessed two glycopeptides of Mr 80000 and 86000, whereas in the adult only a single Mr 113000 species was evident. The total lipid phosphorus and phospholipid composition was unchanged during development. The content of linoleic acid increased approx. 3-fold during development in the phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine phospholipids. The cholesterol content of adult membranes was decreased by 29% compared to neonatal membranes.", 
    "9": "Release of LH occurred in ovariectomized, oestrogen-primed rats when the medial preoptic area (mPOA) was electrically stimulated with monophasic square pulses of 1 ms duration (50 Hz, 150 microA, 15 s on and 15 s off for 30 min). Electrochemical stimulation of the anterior cingulate area applied immediately after the first 15 min period of stimulation in the mPOA completely prevented the rise in LH normally observed during the following 15 min. This effect was suppressed either by selective blockade of noradrenaline synthesis with diethyldithiocarbamate, or following systemic or intraventricular injection of the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, whereas it did not change after systemic atropine, pimozide or phenoxybenzamine. Isoprenaline, a beta-adrenergic agonist, injected into the third ventricle of rats stimulated in the mPOA mimicked the effect of the cortical stimulation, this effect was also blocked by propranolol. Intraventricular administration of propranolol or of isoprenaline had no effect on the release of LH induced by the injection of gonadotrophin releasing hormone, showing that their action is not directly on the pituitary gland. Intraventricular injection of noradrenaline, which failed to affect the release of LH induced by stimulation in the mPOA, inhibited this release when animals were pretreated with phenoxybenzamine. On the other hand, the LH-releasing potency of noradrenaline was greatly increased if the beta-receptors were blocked. From these results it may be concluded (1) that inhibition of the secretion of LH evoked by electrochemical stimulation of the anterior cingulate cortex is mediated by an adrenergic mechanism involving a beta-receptor and (2) that noradrenaline exerts an inhibitory effect on the secretion of LH through a beta-receptor in addition to the known facilitatory action through an alpha-receptor.", 
    "10": "The effects of exercise training and food restriction on the regulation of lipolysis were studied comparatively in adipocytes isolated from male and female rats. Exercise training inhibited cell proliferation in parametrial, but not in epididymal adipose tissue, whereas it significantly reduced adipocyte size in both fat depots. Adipocyte capacity for responding lipolytically to epinephrine (10 microns) or to ACTH (1 micron) was markedly increased by exercise training. Enhanced lipolysis was also observed when cells isolated from exercise-trained animals were stimulated by bypassing with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (5 mM) or theophylline (5 mM) the early metabolic steps associated with hormonal activation of the adenylate cyclase complex. Significantly, binding of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol to cellular receptor sites was not affected by exercise training. It is therefore concluded that exercise training increases adipocyte responsiveness to lipolytic hormones at a metabolic step distal to stimulus recognition by adrenoreceptors, possibly at the level of protein kinases or lipases. Food restriction markedly reduced adipocyte size and partially mimicked the effects of exercise training on adipocyte proliferation and lipolysis.", 
    "11": "Recently, we reported that chronic administration of several antidepressants of different classes produced larger reductions in numbers of serotonin2 (5-HT2) receptors in rat brain labeled by [3H[spiroperidol than in beta adrenergic receptors. In the present study, we examine detailed properties of 5-HT2 receptor regulation by chronic treatment with amitriptyline. Chronic but not acute treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline reduces binding to 5-HT2 receptors by [3H]spiroperidol and beta adrenergic receptor binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol in brain membranes. The decrease is time-dependent, gradually reversible and represents a change in the number of binding sites with no alteration in drug affinities for 5-HT2 receptors. The effect can be observed at daily doses of 2.5 mg/kg, similar to clinically effective doses in humans. At all doses and time intervals, the decrease in 5-HT2 receptors is more marked than the concurrent change in total beta adrenergic receptor binding. The properties of 5-HT2 receptor reduction after chronic antidepressant treatment indicate that this alteration could be associated with therapeutic response.", 
    "12": "The excitatory innervation of isolated thoracic duct segments was studied using tissue bath techniques. No spontaneous activity was present in longitudinal or helical strips obtained from a portion of the thoracic duct cephalad to the hilum of the lung. Norepinephrine (10(-8) to 10(-5) M) and tyramine (3 x 10(-5) M) produced contractions that were antagonized by phentolamine (2 x 10(-5) M) and phenoxybenzamine (10(-7) M). Acetylcholine (10(-7) to 10(-4) M) produced contractions that were antagonized by atropine (5 x 10(-9) M). Thoracic duct strips also contracted in response to field electrical stimulation, and maximal responses were obtained with a stimulus of 15 V, 15 Hz, and 1-ms pulse duration. These electrically induced contractions were abolished by tetrodotoxin (5 x 10(-7) M), phentolamine (2 x 10(-5) M), phenoxybenzamine (10(-7) M), and guanethidine (3 x 10(-6) M), but not by atropine (10(-6) M). We conclude that smooth muscle of the canine thoracic duct contains alpha-adrenergic and acetylcholine receptors, both of which cause contraction when stimulated. However, only the alpha-receptors appear to be innervated.", 
    "13": "1. The effect of membrane stabilizers and cytochalasin-B on amylase secretion, basal and induced by ionophore A23187, CCK-PZ, bethanechol and glucagon, was studied in dissociated mouse pancreatic acinar cells. 2. Cytochalasin-B did not affect basal or secretagogue-stimulated amylase secretion. 3. Membrane stabilizers [thymol (10(-7)-10(-4) M), chlorpromazine (10(-7)-10(-4) M) and propranolol (10(-7)-10(-5) M) did not alter basal release of amylase. At higher concentrations of thymol (10(-3) M), chlorpromazine (10(-3) M) and propranolol (10(-4) M), dissociated acinar cells were lysed as indicated by an increase in release of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). 4. Ionophore A23187, CCK-PZ (maximal effective concentrations, 0.01 u. ml.-1), bethanechol (maximal effective concentrations, 10(-4) M) and glucagon increased amylase secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. Concentrations of CCK-PZ and bethanechol beyond optimal levels decreased amylase secretion. Concentrations of ionophore A23187 and glucagon when tested beyond 10(-6) M and 10(-4) M respectively increased the release of LDH. In concentrations that were non-toxic, membrane stabilizers blocked the stimulating effect of cholecystokinin-pancreozymin and bethanechol on amylase secretion but did not alter the response to A23187 and glucagon. 5. Unlike bethanechol, glucagon neither increased the uptake of 45Ca nor did it alter the release of 45Ca from cells previously loaded with 45CaCl2. 6. These data provide evidence that stimulus-secretion coupling in dissociated pancreatic acinar cells is basically similar to cells in situ. The effect of glucagon is consistent with the model in which hormone-dependent mobilization of Ca2+ from intra- or extracellular sources is bypassed leading to digestive enzyme secretion.", 
    "14": "1. Continuous intravenous noradrenaline infusion for 1 week into rats by osmotic minipumps significantly increased blood pressure and left ventricular weight. 2. Concomitant alpha-receptor-blockade infusion significantly lowered blood pressure and the aortic weight without significant reduction in left ventricular weight. 3. Two beta-receptor-blocking agents in noradrenaline-infused rats normalized left ventricular weight and significantly reduced the aortic weight, although blood pressure was still higher than control non-infused rats. 4. In 7-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats, propranolol (perorally for 2 weeks) did not lower blood pressure but reduced significantly cardiovascular protein synthesis ([14C]lysine and [3H]uridine incorporation into non-collagen protein and RNA respectively) in both left ventricle and aorta. This effect was in contrast to hydralazine, which normalized blood pressure but did not reduce cardiovascular protein synthesis. 5. Results suggest that beta-receptors play a modulating role in the structural cardiovascular response to blood pressure.", 
    "15": "Longlasting overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system can be considered as one of the causes of the hypermetabolism developing in patients with head injury or tetanus. In tetanus elevated plasma levels of catecholamines can be demonstrated as long as disturbances of the motor nervous system are present. In patients with head injury the plasma catecholamines, mainly noradrenaline, start to increase with the onset of the transition stage from midbrain syndrome to the apallic syndrome. The activity of the sympathetic nervous system remains elevated also in the full stage of the apallic syndrome and during the remission. The influence of such a longlasting sympathetic overactivity on the metabolism is discussed. For the suppression of hypermetabolism caused by sympathetic overactivity the use of the adrenergic neuron blocking drug debrisoquine combined with a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking drug is suggested. This treatment enables a normocaloric nutrition in patients with head injury or tetanus. Additionally such a treatment protects the cardiovascular system against the consequences of a longlasting sympathetic overactivity. The influence of debrisoquine on the plasma levels of noradrenaline is demonstrated in a patient with head injury.", 
    "16": "Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) stimulated cyclic AMP formation in the anterior pituitary, hypothalamus, pons and cerebral medulla of rat in vitro. The concentration of VIP above 10(-7) M significantly raised cyclic AMP level of these tissues with dose-dependency and the maximum stimulation of cyclic AMP formation was obtained at 5 min incubation. This stimulatory effect of VIP was not inhibited by propranolol or somatostatin. However, no enhancement of hormone release from the anterior pituitary or hypothalamus into the incubation medium by VIP was observed. These results suggest that VIP may act through adenylate cyclase in specific areas of rat central nervous system independent of beta-adrenergic receptor, but it may not necessarily be related to hormone release from the anterior pituitary or hypothalamus.", 
    "17": "The compound GYKI-41 099, as a beta-adrenergic antagonist, is 3-8 times more potent than propranolol in vitro and in vivo. Its antiarrhythmic effectiveness surpasses that of propranolol and pindolol inhibiting the ouabain arrhythmia in dogs and cats. GYKI-41 900 has a negligible cardiodepressant activity; it is not cardioselective. The compound shows a rapid and long lasting effect. There was a prolonged elimination of the radioactivity after the injection of 14C-41 099 to rats and dogs. The half life of the unlabeled substance in humans was more than 10 hours.", 
    "18": "Hypertension occurs frequently in diabetics. In these patients anti-hypertensive treatment is difficult and still imperfectly resolved. The drugs used to treat hypertensive diabetics are the same as those for the non-diabetics, but their side effects are more important in patients with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. When hypertension is discovered in a diabetic, the addition of further dietary constraints and drugs often limits compliance with therapy. Diuretics increase orthostatic hypotension which is frequent in diabetics. Their deleterious effects on carbohydrate, lipid and uric acid metabolism are not clearly defined in these patients already at high risk. In diabetics liable to hypoglycaemic attacks, cardioselective beta-blockers are safer to use than non-selective beta blockers. They have considerably improved control of blood pressure, but are not effective in all cases. In addition, their effects on lipoproteins and carbohydrate metabolism require further study. The centrally acting anti-hypertensives and the vasodilators produce side effects which are particularly frequent and undesirable in the diabetic. They are usually used in combination at low dose when the control of blood pressure is not achieved with the use of diuretics and/or beta-blockers. Over the past few years, information concerning the use of the different anti-hypertensive agents in diabetes has accumulated with a resulting improvement in blood pressure control. Normalization of blood pressure is a goal not always reached but necessary if cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the main problem in diabetics, are to be reduced.", 
    "19": "1 SK & F 92657 is a new compound which in animals has both precapillary vasodilator and beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity. The effects of the drug on forearm blood flow and dorsal hand vein distensibility have been studied in healthy volunteers. 2 Forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. The drug was infused directly into a brachial artery. The effects of SK & F 92657 on resting flow and on the dose-response relationship for intra-arterial isoprenaline were studied. 3 Venous distensibility was measured in the large veins on the back of the hand. The drug was infused directly into a selected vein and its effects on resting tone and on the responses to noradrenaline and to isoprenaline were investigated. 4 Intra-arterial infusion of SK & F 92657 over 2 min caused a dose-dependent increase in forearm blood flow which developed gradually to reach a maximum after approximately 40 min. Infusion into dorsal hand veins at 100 ng/min and 500 ng/min had no dilator effect in veins preconstricted with noradrenaline. At higher doses SK & F 92657 potentiated the constrictor effect of noradrenaline. 5 In both veins and arteries SK & F 92657 attenuated the dilator effects of isoprenaline. The drug had no effect on the venodilator effects of bradykinin, histamine or sodium nitroprusside. 6 The pattern of response of these vessels to locally infused SK & F 92657 is exactly that expected of a drug combining the properties of hydralazine-like vasodilatation and beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Furthermore, in the arterioles, both properties were manifest at the same dose.", 
    "20": "1. The effect of beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on gastric emptying of a solid meal labelled with Indium113m was measured by a gamma camera in healthy volunteers or patients with hypertension. Each subject acted as his own control. 2 In ten subjects given isoprenaline (10 or 20 mg) sublingually 30 min before the meal, gastric emptying half-times were significantly prolonged (P less than 0.05). No effect was observed when isoprenaline was given immediately before the meal. 3 Salbutamol, 4 mg four times daily for 1 week also significantly prolonged gastric emptying in four subjects (P less than 0.05). 4 The effect of isoprenaline on gastric emptying was blocked by propranolol 40 mg four times daily for 1 week. 5 In ten subjects propranolol 40 mg four times daily alone for 1 week was found to significantly speed up gastric emptying (P less than 0.005), suggesting that emptying of the normal stomach is subject to some degree of adrenergic inhibition.", 
    "21": "A number of substances have been used by athletes in an attempt to improve performance in sports. The use of these substances, which are referred to as ergogenic aids, has become widespread; some pose serious health hazards. Ergogenic aids are divided into five broad classifications: physiological, physical, psychological, nutritional and chemical. It is possible, although conclusive proof is lacking, that some substances may give an athlete who takes them an advantage over one who does not. However, the health hazards posed in general by these materials far outweigh any possible advantage.", 
    "22": "1. The antihypertensive effect of the new drug, SKF 92 657, a hydrazinopyridazine derivative, possessing both beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking and vasodilating properties, was investigated in essential hypertension. 2. Single oral doses of 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg did not produce any consistent decrease in blood pressure; 4.0 mg/kg was the threshold dose for a mild but not significant blood pressure reduction, whereas 8.0 mg/kg caused a significant and marked blood pressure decrease without clinically relevant changes in heart rate. 3. Continued administration of the drug for 7 days induced a significant and uniform reduction in blood pressure without tachycardia. The increase in systolic blood pressure and in heart rate caused by dynamic exercise was left unaffected by the drug.", 
    "23": "The interaction of adrenergic beta-receptor blockers and epinephrine on intraocular pressure and pupil size was investigated in healthy volunteers. Oral (atenolol and propranolol) and local (timolol) beta-blockers were studied. The experiment was carried out under double-blind randomized crossover conditions. The results showed that the combination of oral beta-blockers with topical epinephrine had an additive hypotensive effect on IOP, while timolol and epinephrine eyedrops both reduced the IOP used alone, but combined had an antagonistic effect, resulting in the disappearance of the epinephrine-mediated IOP reduction.", 
    "24": "In the past decade a number of new antiarrhythmic drugs ahve been introduced. They have been extensively used in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. Few, if any, long-term comparative trials of these newer agents have been reported. Most of these newer agents have been shown to be able to reduce the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias but not the mortality rate. Beta blockers and some antiplatelet adhesive drugs, however, have reduced the mortality rate following myocardial infarction. There is a need for long-term properly stratified trials of these effective agents.", 
    "25": "The administration of beta-receptor blocking drugs and antiarrhythmic drugs in close proximity may result in hemodynamic, electrophysiologic, or pharmacokinetic interactions. We examined the hemodynamic and electrophysiologic effects of 0.20 mg/kg intravenous metoprolol followed by a 15-minute infusion of 0.75 mg/kg/min tocainide. In the six patients sutided, metoprolol produced a fall in cardiac rate and output which was not further altered by tocainide. Both drugs decreased peak left ventricular (LV) dP/dt, ejection fraction, and mean Vcf. There was no change in LV end-diastolic pressure or echo dimension and in clinical ill effects. In eight patients without sinus A-V nodal disease electrophysiologic studies showed mild depression of A-V conduction by metoprolol. Tocainide depressed sinus node function and shortened the functional refractory period of the His-Purkinje system. There were no clinical sequelae. However, three patients with preexisting electrophysiologic abnormalities developed asystole. There was no evidence of pharmacokinetic interaction. It is concluded that metoprolol and tocainide can be given concurrently with reasonable safety to cardiac patients without electrophysiologic abnormalities.", 
    "26": "Cardiovascular adaptation to stress is highly dependent on adrenergic stimulation. It may be hypothesized that the diminished cardiovascular response to acute stress that occurs in advanced age may result in part from an age-related decrease in the effectiveness of adrenergic stimulation. Studies employing beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists in both man and animals provide support for this hypothesis. In addition, a postsynaptic decrement in sympathetic responsiveness is indicated from in vitro studies in both cardiac and vascular tissue. However, while a strong case for diminished adrenergic responsiveness of the aged cardiovascular system can be made from these data, further information at both the tissue and the organismal level is required to fully elucidate the nature of this age-related decline.", 
    "27": "Eighteen patients with essential hypertension were treated in a single-blind, crossover study with pindolol and with propranolol. The two drugs were compared because of known differences between them on renin secretion. We noted that plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration were suppressed by propranolol but not by pindolol. Blood pressure was reduced about equally by both drugs. Serum potassium levels rose in 17 patients on pindolol (p < 0.001) and in 14 patients on propranolol (p = 0.08). Our data suggest that serum potassium elevations induced by beta blockade do not depend on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Alternative possibilities are discussed.", 
    "28": "The dopamine receptor in the intermediate lobe (IL) of the hypophysis of the rat is characterized on the basis of the ability of dopamine and other dopaminergic agonists to decrease the consequences of activation of the beta-adrenoceptor. Stimulation of the dopamine receptor diminishes the L-isoproterenol-induced accumulation of cAMP and the catecholamine-stimulated enhancement of adenylate cyclase activity. The dopamine receptor in the IL can be assigned to the category of dopamine receptor designated D-2 on the basis of the following criteria: 1) occupancy of the dopamine receptor does not result in enhancement of adenylate cyclase activity or an accumulation of cAMP, 2) the dopaminergic ergots and apomorphine mimic the inhibitory effect of dopamine upon cAMP formation or alpha MSH release, and 3) metoclopramide and sulpiride, substituted benzamides, block the inhibitory effect of dopamine. The sympathetic neurotransmitter, norepinephrine, interacts with the dopamine receptor and the beta-adrenoceptor in the IL.", 
    "29": "Thirty hypertensive patients treated with a drug regimen which contained a beta-receptor antagonist (either propranolol, pindolol or metoprolol) exhibited an improvement in blood pressure control when atenolol was substituted for the corresponding beta-blocker in the drug regimen. Additional benefits noted were a reduction in concomitant drug therapy and an improvement in reported side effects. Atenolol caused a significant decrease in heart rate in the group for which the mean follow-up period was 23.6 months.", 
    "30": "Labetalol was administered as the sole antihypertensive agent to 20 ambulatory patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures (+/- standard error of the mean) with the patients sitting fell significantly (P < 0.001), from 145.5 +/- 3.2 and 103.7 +/- 1.6 mm Hg respectively at the start of labetalol therapy (after a period free of antihypertensive medication) to 125.7 +/- 2.0 and 87.2 +/- 1.1 mm Hg by the end of the trial. The diastolic blood pressure was well controlled (90 mm Hg or less) with labetalol therapy in 90% of the patients. The medication was well tolerated, and no orthostatic fall in the diastolic blood pressure was observed. Pharmacologically labetalol most closely resembles a combination of a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker like propranolol and a postsynaptic alpha-adrenergic blocker like prazosin.", 
    "31": "Human placental cells maintained were used to determine the direct effect of beta-adrenergic agonists on progesterone accumulation by the placenta. In five studies, when either of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonists, terbutaline or isoproterenol, 1.5 micrograms/ml, was incubated for 24 hours with the placental cells, significantly more progesterone was present in the culture medium than in the medium of matched controls. Compared with the medium of matched controls, progesterone in medium increased 36 +/- 6% (mean +/- SE) when cells were treated with terbutaline and 38 +/- 7% when cells were treated with isoproterenol. In two dose-response studies with terbutaline, a minimal dose of 0.15 micrograms/ml was required to significantly increase progesterone in medium compared with that in matched controls. In three studies, propranolol at a concentration of 1.5 micrograms/ml completely blocked the stimulatory effect of 1.5 micrograms/ml of terbutaline.", 
    "32": "Phenylephrine (0.1-100 microM) in the presence of 1 microM propranolol increased the force of contraction in electrically driven papillary muscles from cats. This presumably alpha-adrenoceptor mediated positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine occurred without any influence on (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity.", 
    "33": "A method for the determination of d- and l-propranolol in human plasma is described. The method involves extraction of propranolol from plasma, and the formation of diastereomeric derivatives with the chiral reagent N-trifluoroacetyl-1-prolylchloride. Separation and quantitation of the diastereomeric propranolol derivatives are carried out by a reversed-phase high-performance liquid-chromatographic system with fluorimetric detection. The reproducibility in the determination of d- and l-propranolol in human plasma was 4.5% (relative standard deviation) at drug levels of 10 ng/ml. In two subjects who received a single 40-mg tablet of racemic propranolol the plasma levels of the d-isomer were lower than of the l-propranolol. The half-lives of d- and l-propranolol were similar.", 
    "34": "Melatonin and L-propranolol, which inhibits melatonin synthesis, were administered to rats at 07.45 h and 19.45 h. Melatonin given in the morning decreased non-REM sleep, but when given at night had no effect on sleep stages. L-propranolol given in the morning had no effect on non-REM sleep, but increased it at night. L-propranolol produced decreased in percentage REM sleep at both times.", 
    "35": "Twenty-four black patients (Zulus) with hypertension participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial of the efficacy of a beta-blocking agent (atenolol) 100 mg once daily as compared with chlorthalidone 25 mg once daily. The two drugs were also given combined at these doses and the effects compared with those of the drugs given alone. Atenolol as sole treatment had no appreciable effect on blood pressure as compared with placebo. Chlorthalidone produced a small decrease, but this was not statistically significant. Combining the two drugs, however, produced a significant reduction in blood pressure (mean lying blood pressure p < 0.001; mean standing blood pressure p < 0.0002). These findings suggest that beta-blockers should not be regarded as baseline treatment of hypertension in blacks.", 
    "36": "1. Gluconeogenesis from various substrates has been demonstrated in hepatocytes from 48 h fasted rabbits. Maximum rates of gluconeogenesis (expressed as mumol glucose formed/30 min per 10(8) cells) are: D-fructose, 9.86; dihydroxyacetone, 5.28; L-lactate, 5.26; L-lactate/pyruvate, 3.83; pyruvate, 3.32; glycerol, 2.92; L-alanine, 2.24. 2. Gluconeogenesis from L-lactate is enhanced 1.3--1.5-fold over control values by glucagon, L-epinephrine, L-norepinephrine, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, L-phenylephrine and L-isoproterenol. Glucogenesis from both dihydroxyacetone and D-fructose is stimulated 1.7--2.0-fold of control values by glucagon, epinephrine and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. 3. Gluconeogenesis from lactate is enhanced by both alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulations based on findings with alpha- and beta-agonists and antagonists. 4. Enhancement of gluconeogenesis by epinephrine and norepinephrine is apparently due to both alpha- and beta-adrenergic effects, as either propranolol or phentolamine partially inhibits such enhancement. The consistently more pronounced inhibition produced by propranolol implies that stimulation of glucose formation by catecholamines is more strongly beta-adrenergic related. Epinephrine-induced glycogenolysis in rabbit hepatocytes is severely inhibited by propranolol but insensitive to phentolamine, suggesting that glycogen breakdown is solely beta-adrenergic related. These observations contrast with those of others that stimulation of both gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis by catecholamines while sensitive to both alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation in rats, at least young rats, is primarily alpha-adrenergic mediated, especially in adult rats.", 
    "37": "[3H]Dihydroalprenolol binding and adenylate cyclase activity in the myocardial membranes of Kyoto Wistar normotensive rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats were compared at various stages of postnatal development ranging from 2 to 36 weeks. Basal as well as agonist-stimulated myocardial adenylate cyclase activity was consistently decreased in spontaneously hypertensive rats as compared to normotensive rats as early as 2 weeks of age with significant differences (P < 0.05) observed after 6 weeks of age. When results were expressed as percent stimulation over the basal activity, only isoproterenol plus GTP-stimulated enzyme activity was reduced by 25--30% in spontaneously hypertensive rats, suggesting a specific loss of stimulation by isoproterenol in hypertensive animals. The number of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites of KD for dihydroalprenolol binding were comparable between spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats at 3, 6 and 12 weeks of age. The competition of isoproterenol with [3H]dihydroalprenolol for the specific binding sites showed that the affinity of isoproterenol binding was decreased 3--4-fold in spontaneously hypertensive compared with normotensive rats. With postnatal development in age, basal as well as agonist-stimulated activities decreased progressively in both spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats. Similarly, the number of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites decreased with the development in age, whereas affinity of dihydroalprenolol binding increased up to 12 weeks of age. These results therefore suggest that adenylate cyclase activity and the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in rat heart, decrease with age and that in hypertension, specific decrease in isoproterenol stimulation of cyclase appears at all stages of development.", 
    "38": "In the study of food-procuring conditioned reflex in rats it was found that microinjection of noradrenaline and dopamine in the medial hypothalamus impedes its realization, prolonging the reflex latency, lowering its value and the number of conditioned food-procuring movements. The effects of catecholamines on food-procuring conditioned activity are specific and effectuated correspondingly via alpha-adrenoreceptors or receptors of the hypothalamic neurones sensitive to haloperidol and aminazine. Local administration of GABA to the hypothalamus prolongs the latency of the food-procuring conditioned reflex, but does not change its value and the number of conditioned food-procuring movements. The effect of GABA is not due to the effect on adreno- and dopamine receptors of the hypothalamus.", 
    "39": "The authors believe that the epinephrines should be employed as the initial therapy in both primary open angle glaucoma and, when treated, ocular hypertension. Unlike pilocarpine, epinephrine does not produce miosis and accommodative spasm. Because of longer experience with epinephrine than with costly timolol, its longterm effectiveness and side effects are better known. Although the side effects of epinephrine are usually not serious, they may be intolerable to the patient. However, allergic blepharoconjunctivitis may be ameliorated by concomitant hydroxymesterone therapy. The availability of dipivalyl epinephrine (DPE) may decidedly shift the balance of the treatment of ocular hypertension, when indicated, to an epinephrine compound.", 
    "40": "Electrical stimulation on the posterior portion in the caval margin of the right atrium caused a biphasic chronotropic and inotropic response, i.e., a negative response followed by a positive response, in the isolated blood-perfused canine atrial preparation. The threshold of pulse duration for inducing negative responses was approximately 0.05 msec at 2 v and 20 Hz, but that for inducing positive responses was approximately 0.5 msec. When the voltage and pulse duration of electrical stimulation were increased, both the degree of negative and positive responses became greater. However, muscle contracture was frequently induced by increasing the voltage or pulse duration. The optimal frequency was 20 to 40 Hz for inducing marked chronotropic and inotropic responses. The negative chronotropic and inotropic response to subthreshold electrical stimulation was significantly suppressed by the treatment with tetrodotoxin, hexamethonium or atropine, while it was enhanced by physostigmine treatment. These suggest that subthreshold electrical stimulation readily caused a release of acetylcholine by excitation of parasympathetic preganglionic fibers in this atrial preparation. The positive chronotropic and inotropic response was significantly suppressed not only by treatment with propranolol but also by tetrodotoxin, while it was enhanced by imipramine, hexamethonium, or atropine. From these results, it is indicated that this blood-perfused preparation is very suitable to evaluate both cardiac mechanisms controlled by autonomic nervous system and drug actions on effects of endogenous hormone.", 
    "41": "An equation is presented which describes the changes in drug clearance through an isolated organ due to alterations in the blood flow to the organ or the intrinsic clearance of the drug by the organ. In the case of hepatic clearance, example calculations of alterations in both parameters are presented from literature data for marker drugs having high and low extraction ratios. The predicted hepatic clearance of d-propranolol based on these calculations compares with observed values. For the particular example of the kidney, the blood flow and the intrinsic clearance change in proportion and, therefore, yield a simple equation relating renal clearance of any drug to endogenous creatinine clearance. This equation, though used clinically, has previously not been derived theoretically.", 
    "42": "In the isolated canine heart-lung preparation modified to measure coronary outflow and myocardial oxygen consumption, an infusion of carbochromen of 1 mg/min produced an increase in coronary outflow of 120.0% and a decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption of 11.0% at a cumulative dose of 28.0 +/- 3.8 mg, resulting in an increase in efficiency of 22.4%. At a total dose of 40 mg, the corresponding figures were +181.0%, -15.0% and +38.0% respectively. No change in heart rate was observed. An infusion of propranolol of 1 mg/min, on the other hand, was characterized by decreases in myocardial contractility and heart rate starting with cumulative doses of 20 mg and 40 mg respectively. At a cumulative dose of 62.9 +/- 3.0 mg a marked degree of myocardial failure occurred (peak failure) characterized by a decrease in cardiac output (-53.3%), dp/dt (-50.8%), heart rate (-18.5%) and myocardial oxygen consumption (-25.5%). In a separate series exposed to the same infusion of propranolol but in which the decrease in heart rate was prevented by pacing, identical changes were observed except that myocardial oxygen consumption decreased only by 7.7%. It may be concluded from this study that carbochromen, in confirmation of reports by other investigators, increases coronary outflow markedly. Carbochromen decreases myocardial oxygen consumption by a direct effect on myocardial metabolism as is evident from the fact that this decrease is not accompanied by changes in any of the parameters which are known to influence myocardial oxygen consumption such as heart rate. Propranolol has no effect on myocardial oxygen consumption unless it is given in a dose which produces myocardial failure and a decrease in heart rate. The decrease in heart rate following propranolol bears a close relationship to the decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption.", 
    "43": "A high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method using reverse phase paired-ion chromatography and ultraviolet detection at 280 nm has been developed to determine labetalol, an alpha and beta adrenoceptor blocking agent, in Purina No. 5001 rodent chow. The method is simple and rapid, and demonstrates a separation technique applicable to other acidic and basic drugs. It requires only extraction of the drug with methanol--water--acetic acid (66 + 33 + 1) and separation of insoluble material by filtration before HPLC. Labetalol, is chromatographically separated from soluble feed components by means of a microBondapak C18 column and methanol--water--acetic acid (66 + 33 + 1) mobile phase, 0.005M with respect to sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate paired-ion reagent. Average recovery is 98.7% with a relative standard deviation of +/- 2.3% for the equipment described."
