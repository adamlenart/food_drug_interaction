    "1": "Six beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (propranolol (+ and - isomers); ICI-118,551; oxprenolol; timolol; metoprolol; and practolol (+ and - isomers), chosen to represent a spectrum of physicochemical and pharmacological properties, inhibited the response of human platelets to all aggregating agents tested. For any given aggregating agent the extent of inhibition correlated with the lipid solubility of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist and showed no relation to other properties of these compounds. Inhibition of aggregation by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was manifested as a parallel shift to the right in the dose-response curve. Analysis of these data according to Arunlakshana and Schild (Br. J. Pharmac. 14, 48-58 (1969] showed a dependence of the apparent pA2 on the agonist employed and gave a slope approximating unity when ADP, 9,11-epoxymethanoprostaglandin H2 (U-46619), adrenaline, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine (PAF) or arachidonate were used as agonists. Slopes significantly greater than unity, and approaching a value of 2, were obtained when this analysis was applied to data obtained using collagen in the presence or absence of aspirin, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or a divalent cation ionophore (A-23187) as agonists. Inhibition by (+/-) propranolol of secretion induced by collagen was manifested as a parallel shift to the right in the dose-response curve for collagen. The Schild plot of these data has a slope of unity. (+/-)-Propranolol inhibited thromboxane B2 production induced by collagen but over a similar concentration range had little effect on conversion of arachidonate to thromboxane B2. (+/-)Propranolol had no significant effect on the level of cyclic-3',5'-AMP (cAMP) in unstimulated platelets or on the increase in the level caused by addition of forskolin, but caused partial inhibition of the increase in platelet cAMP induced by prostaglandin E1. It also completely abolished inhibition by ADP of the increase in [cyclic-3',5'-AMP] induced by prostaglandin E1. These data are interpreted on the basis of a model in which interaction of propranolol with phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol causes inhibition of phospholipases C and A2, inhibition of protein kinase C and alteration of membrane receptor properties as a consequence of distortion of their microenvironment.", 
    "2": "Cardiac arrhythmia causing sudden cardiac death is a serious worldwide public health problem. Antiarrhythmic agents have been available for therapy, but the conventional agents cause a high degree of intolerable side effects. The recent development of many new experimental antiarrhythmic agents has increased our capacity to effectively treat cardiac arrhythmias. Using a multifaceted approach of programmed electrical stimulation studies, drug level determinations, exercise testing and 24-hour ambulatory Holter monitoring, it can reasonably be decided which patient needs therapy and if therapy is going to be effective. Both aspects of the sudden death equation, ectopy frequency (triggering mechanism) and the ability to propagate sustained ventricular tachycardia (substrate), may be examined. Careful follow-up is needed to determine continued drug efficacy and the presence of side effects that may compromise patient compliance with therapy. If side effects intervene that may cause continued therapy to be intolerable, changing the antiarrhythmic agent, as opposed to decreasing the dosage to an ineffective range, may be appropriate. A comprehensive approach to arrhythmia management may begin to reduce the high incidence of sudden death due to fatal arrhythmias.", 
    "3": "Our current understanding of human cardiac arrhythmias is primitive and their treatment is largely empirical. For a few arrhythmias for which the mechanism is known, this information is valuable in selecting therapy. Primary methods for arrhythmia detection are 24-hour electrocardiographic recordings, patient-activated recordings, exercise and cardiac electrophysiologic studies. A search for removable causes of arrhythmia should be sought before instituting specific treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs, surgery or implantable devices. Over the past 20 years, the spectrum of antiarrhythmic drug action has broadened; sodium channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers have extended our therapeutic options, but the ideal drug has yet to appear. Efficacy and convenience of antiarrhythmic drugs have improved significantly, but adverse effects and drug interactions still occur much too frequently. The outlook for patients with malignant arrhythmias has improved significantly. However, the 2 methods for evaluating therapy of malignant arrhythmias are time-consuming, uncomfortable and expensive. Basic and clinical research is rapidly advancing our knowledge and effectiveness in dealing with cardiac arrhythmias. As a result, we can expect substantial improvements in arrhythmia control in the future.", 
    "4": "Intracarotid prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) infusions (10 ng X kg-1 X min-1) increased arterial pressure in conscious dogs, sheep, and calves. Total and regional peripheral resistances (renal, superior mesenteric, and iliac) increased in conscious calves. Arterial pH and CO2 tension did not change, implying no activation of the chemoreflex. The arterial baro-reflex was reset upward during intracarotid PGE2 infusion; arterial pressure increased with little heart rate change, but baroreflex sensitivity was unchanged. In contrast, equipotent intracarotid angiotensin II infusions (10 ng X kg-1 X min-1) both reset the baroreflex upward and decreased baroreflex sensitivity. Pretreatment with alpha-, but not beta-, adrenoceptor blocking agents attenuated the intracarotid PGE2 pressor effect. Increasing PGE2 infusions (10-200 ng X kg-1 X min-1) caused dose-related arterial pressure increases; plasma renin activity was increased only at the largest infusion rate. Pretreatment with captopril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, attenuated the PGE2 pressor effect. During barbiturate-halothane and chlorolose-urethan anesthesia, no pressor effect was observed during intracarotid PGE2. We conclude that intracarotid PGE2 acts centrally to augment sympathetic vasomotor outflow. The central action of PGE2 is not affected by activation of the arterial chemoreflex or alteration of baroreflex sensitivity and has a small renin-angiotensin component.", 
    "5": "Myocardial ischemia increases the release of adenosine (RADO), inosine (RINO), and norepinephrine; however, it is not known whether norepinephrine contributes to nucleoside production via the beta-adrenergic receptor. We used a Langendorff preparation (guinea pig) to study the time course of RADO and RINO during myocardial hypoperfusion (MH) produced by decreasing perfusion pressure from 60 to 30 cmH2O. Data are expressed as means +/- SE. RADO and RINO significantly increased from 21 +/- 2 and 418 +/- 89 pmol X min-1 X g-1 to 206 +/- 26 and 2,401 +/- 598, respectively, by 10 min of MH. By 20 min, RADO and RINO had decreased significantly to 111 +/- 15 and 912 +/- 169 pmol X min-1 X g-1. RADO remained at that level for the remaining 160 min, whereas RINO returned to the control level. Coronary flow and myocardial O2 consumption were constant during MH. In the presence of 10(-7) M dl-propranolol MH did not produce the initial peak RADO; RADO increased to 95 +/- 18 pmol X min-1 X g-1 at 10 min and then did not change. Also, the initial peak RINO was significantly reduced (687 +/- 67 pmol X min-1 X g-1 at 10 min). Similar results were obtained with atenolol (5 X 10(-6) M), a beta-receptor antagonist without membrane-stabilizing effects. In the presence of 10(-5) M dl-propranolol, MH did not increase nucleoside release above control. Nucleoside release was similarly blocked during MH in the presence of 5 X 10(-6) M d-propranolol, which does not have the beta-blocking properties of the l-isomer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "A method for the determination of metoprolol and its main metabolites in urine is presented. The method comprises derivatization of the aminopropanol side-chain with phosgene at alkaline pH and isolation in an organic phase at acidic pH. After trimethylsilylation, separation and quantification are performed by capillary column gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. The reaction is performed at pH 12 with 60 microliters of 2 M phosgene in toluene added in three portions. Diethyl ether--dichloromethane is used as extraction medium and bis(trimethylsilyl) acetamide as silylating agent. With spiked samples linear standard curves were obtained for metoprolol and three of its main metabolites with a detection limit varying between 4 and 20 mumol/l of urine. The method was applied to urine samples from a normal individual who had taken 292 mumol of metoprolol as tartrate.", 
    "7": "Indirect evidence suggests that the genetically defective metabolism of drugs such as debrisoquine and bufuralol observed in up to 10% of the population (poor metabolizers) is caused by the absence or functional deficiency of a cytochrome P450 isozyme. Using bufuralol-1'-hydroxylation to carbinol to optimize the procedure, 3 cytochrome P450 isozymes (P450A, P450buf, P450C) were purified to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity from human liver microsomes. P450buf had a specific activity of 20.3 nmol carbinol X nmol P450-1 X 15 min-1 as compared to microsomes (10.0 nmol carbinol X nmol P450(-1) X 15 min-1) when (+)-bufuralol was used as substrate. The stereoselective metabolism of (-)- and (+)-bufuralol to carbinol by purified P450buf [(-)/(+) ratio: 0.13] was strikingly different from that in the microsomes of either an extensive [(-)/(+) ratio: 0.4] or poor metabolizer [(-)/(+) ratio: 0.83] of bufuralol. We propose that this isozyme is the major bufuralol and debrisoquine hydroxylating species and is the target of the genetic deficiency.", 
    "8": "The effect of experimental variations of the blood flow rate on hepatic elimination of propranolol was studied in livers from 200 g rats perfused in a recirculating system given a constant infusion of propranolol into the reservoir throughout each experiment. This design ensures that, at steady state, the elimination rate of propranolol is the same as the infusion rate of propranolol, and equal to the hepatic blood flow rate multiplied by the hepatic inlet to outlet propranolol concentration difference. Thus, when flow is increased, the concentration difference will decrease, and vice versa. It is currently a matter of debate whether or not this change in concentration difference will influence the outlet substrate concentration. The venous equilibration model (Rowland et al., J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm. 1: 123-136, 1973) predicts that at a given elimination rate, the outlet concentration is flow-independent, whereas the sinusoidal perfusion model (Bass et al., J. Theor. Biol. 61: 393-410, 1976) predicts that both inlet and outlet concentrations will change. In 13 of 14 experiments, increasing the flow rate (from an average 9 to 14 ml/min) resulted in a decrease of the inlet concentration and elevation of the outlet concentration (each P less than .005). Thus, the data reject the venous equilibration model but are consistent with the sinusoidal perfusion model under the experimental conditions investigated.", 
    "9": "AQA-39 is a new bradycardia-inducing drug chemically related to verapamil that reduces potassium conductance and blocks calcium channels. In canine ventricular trabeculae studied at 25 degrees C and at a pacing rate of 12 stimuli per minute. AQA-39, in concentrations of 1 and 2 X 10(-5) M, had a significant positive (and only positive) inotropic effect. Propranolol significantly diminished this positive inotropic action of AQA-39. After catecholamine depletion with reserpine, AQA-39 still elicited a significant increase in contractility but the magnitude of the increment in contractile performance was considerably less than the one observed when normal muscles were exposed to AQA-39. AQA-39 had no significant inotropic action on reserpinized and atropinized muscles. From these results we can conclude that AQA-39 is not a beta adrenoceptor agonist although adrenergic influences via neuronal norepinephrine release are mediating part of the inotropic effect of the drug. Furthermore, at this low rate of stimulation and at the concentrations used, AQA-39 has no direct inotropic action of its own but part of its indirect stimulatory action is mediated through an antimuscarinic effect.", 
    "10": "Serum protein binding was measured in six women 38 wk pregnant and in five control subjects. Three distinct binding sites for drugs on human serum albumin have been identified. To determine whether changes in binding during pregnancy occur for common drugs or only for drugs that bind to a specific binding site, serum protein binding of three drugs--diazepam (site I), warfarin (site III), and salicylate--and four fluorescent probes--dansylsarcosine (site I), 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (site I), 7-anilinocoumarin-4-acetic acid (site II), and 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonamide (DNSA) (site III)--were determined in control and pregnant sera. Unbound fractions of diazepam and salicylate in pregnant women increased but the unbound fraction of warfarin did not change. Dissociation constants (Kd1) of all fluorescent probes but DNSA were almost the same in control and pregnant sera, while the Kd1 of DNSA in pregnant serum was approximately 50% of control. Binding capacities of all probes decreased, which was attributed to decreased serum albumin concentration. We concluded that serum protein binding of drugs that bind to site I or site II on albumin decreased largely because of the reduced serum albumin concentration during pregnancy and that the binding of drugs that bind to site III changed little because of compensating effects of the decrease in serum albumin concentration and the increase in binding affinity to serum albumin. Serum concentration of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and serum binding of propranolol did not change in pregnant women.", 
    "11": "In a single-blind, randomized study, the cardiovascular and metabolic effects of sotalol, 40 to 160 mg/day, in six patients with mild essential hypertension were compared to those of placebo at rest and during submaximal dynamic exercise. Resting blood pressure was controlled by sotalol but not the pressor response to exercise, despite reduction of tachycardia. The major metabolic finding on sotalol was an approximately 40% decrease in lipid mobilization during exercise. Alterations in muscle lactate concentrations were much like those caused by other beta-blockers. Plasma concentrations of norepinephrine and epinephrine were doubled during exercise on sotalol, epinephrine disposition more so. No effects on serum lipoproteins were observed after 6 wk on sotalol in therapeutic doses. Despite its special electrophysiologic properties, sotalol appears to induce the same cardiovascular and metabolic changes during exercise as do other beta-blockers.", 
    "12": "We report on serum lipoprotein changes after antihypertensive therapy in nine subjects with type II hyperlipoproteinemia and eight subjects with normolipidemia. They received placebo for 6 wk, followed by random order crossover between methyldopa and propranolol for 6 mo. Physical activity, diet, and other drugs were monitored for constancy. No other antihypertensive drugs were used. Doses required for normalization of blood pressure ranged between 40 to 360 mg/day for propranolol and 500 to 2500 mg/day for methyldopa. Mean blood pressure was equally lowered to normal by both drugs. Triglyceride levels increased after propranolol and after methyldopa. Subjects with normocholesterolemia developed higher serum triglyceride levels after each drug, whereas such a change did not occur in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were reduced by methyldopa only in patients with baseline hypercholesterolemia. There was no correlation between lipoprotein level changes, dose required of either drug, or propranolol blood levels. The baseline lipoprotein metabolism disorder appears more likely to determine the type of changes in serum lipoprotein levels after these antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "13": "Verapamil and a number of other Ca2+ antagonists were found to potentiate DNA damage induced by 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin-9-(4,6-O-ethylidene-beta-D-glucop yra noside (VP-16) in L1210 cells in vitro. The potentiating effect of verapamil on DNA single-strand breaks in vitro was concentration dependent, relevant to clinically achieved levels of Ca2+ antagonists, and showed good correlation with enhanced cytotoxicity when VP-16 and Ca2+ antagonists were combined in soft agar colony-forming assays. Onset of verapamil activity was observed within 20 min of addition to cells whether VP-16 had been preincubated with cells or was added simultaneously with the Ca2+ blocker. The presence of the extracellular Ca2+ antagonist was required for potentiation as evidenced by the rapid reversal of increased DNA single-strand breaks when cells were washed free of verapamil. Neither ethyleneglycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid nor the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 altered verapamil potentiation of VP-16-induced DNA damage, suggesting that this Ca2+ antagonist acts by a mechanism other than by inhibition of Ca2+ influx. In isolated L1210 nuclei, verapamil did not enhance VP-16- or 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin-9-(4,6-O-2-thenylidene-beta-D- glucopyranoside (VM-26)-induced single-strand breaks suggesting a requirement for the intact cell. Even though VM-26 was 5- to 10-fold more potent than VP-16, verapamil potentiated the DNA damage caused by these two epipodophyllotoxins in L1210 cells to the same extent when these agents were used at equipotent doses. Potency differences between VM-26 and VP-16 were evident in isolated nuclei suggesting that nuclear binding or activation is a more important parameter than were previously reported membrane transport differences. The significance of Ca2+ antagonist potentiation of VP-16-induced DNA damage is discussed in terms of overcoming resistance to epipodophyllotoxins and characterizing more precisely the intracellular disposition, binding, and activation of VP-16.", 
    "14": "A 64-yr-old asthmatic patient underwent a two-vessel aortocoronary vein grafting. Before surgery, the patient received cimetidine 400 mg and labetalol 650 mg. During the first 60 min of bypass, hypotension (40-45 mm Hg) was observed in spite of phenylephrine 14 mg. This initial hypotension was followed, during rewarming, by a slow increase in arterial pressure to 150 mm Hg. On cessation of bypass, bronchospasm was observed and was protracted. It is assumed that labetalol clearance and metabolism were reduced by cimetidine, that labetalol alpha-antagonism was responsible for the vasodilatation withstanding the phenylephrine, and that a combination of labetalol beta-antagonism and phenylephrine alpha-agonism initiated the bronchospasm. These observations indicate that, after labetalol therapy, higher doses of vasopressor agents such as phenylephrine may be necessary, but that such therapy may lead to bronchospasm in asthmatic patients.", 
    "15": "Sequential measurements of systolic time intervals, left ventricular dimensions, and the derived indices of contractility were undertaken at rest and during isometric exercise in 15 hyperthyroid patients before, during, and after antithyroid treatment. At rest hyperthyroidism was characterised by a shortened pre-ejection period and increased velocity of circumferential shortening of the left ventricle. During isometric exercise, however, the pre-ejection period increased significantly beyond that predicted for normal subjects, and the velocity of circumferential fibre shortening fell by 30%. In contrast, both the pre-ejection period and the velocity of circumferential fibre shortening were unchanged during exercise after a stable euthyroid state had been achieved for at least three months. Comparison between exercise responses and thyroid status during antithyroid treatment showed that a biochemical euthyroid state may be achieved many weeks before normalisation of contractile response to exercise. These findings support the hypothesis of reversible depression of left ventricular function in hyperthyroidism. Responses at rest principally reflect the peripheral actions of thyroid hormone excess.", 
    "16": "Radioligand receptor binding techniques were used to characterize the muscarinic cholinergic receptor in the vas deferens, bladder, prostate and penis of the rabbit. This study represents the first comparative investigation of a neurotransmitter receptor in the genitourinary tract using radioligand receptor binding methods. A single high affinity muscarinic binding site was identified in the vas deferens (Kd = 0.16 nM), bladder (Kd = 0.15 nM) and prostate (Kd = 0.17 nM), using [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS), a muscarinic antagonist. Two high affinity [3H]NMS binding sites (Kd1 = 0.08 nM; Kd2 = 1.39 nM) were found in the penis. The pharmacology of the NMS binding sites in the vas deferens, bladder and prostate was characterized by competitive binding experiments with [3H]NMS and several unlabelled muscarinic and nonmuscarinic drugs. Noncholinergic drugs, as expected, were weak inhibitors of [3H]NMS binding. The values of the IC50's for the muscarinic drugs atropine, pirenzepine and oxotremorine in the genitourinary tissues of the rabbit were similar to values reported in nongenitourinary tissues demonstrating homogeneity of muscarinic receptors. The mean Hill coefficients for the muscarinic antagonist (atropine 0.81 to 0.878) were significantly different than for the muscarinic agonist (oxotremorine 0.39 to 0.44) in all genitourinary tissues, a binding property of muscarinic receptors identified in other tissues. The requirements for the characterization of cholinergic muscarinic receptors have been fulfilled for several genitourinary tissues of the rabbit. Radioligand receptor binding methods can now be applied to investigating the relationship between genitourinary dysfunction and alterations in the muscarinic cholinergic receptors.", 
    "17": "The physiological relationship of increased circulating angiotensin II and vasopressin to circulatory changes during combined hypoxemia and hypercapnic acidosis is unclear. To evaluate the role(s) of angiotensin II and vasopressin, seven unanesthetized female mongrel dogs with controlled sodium intake (80 meq/24 h X 4 d) were studied during 40 min of combined acute hypoxemia and hypercapnic acidosis (PaO2, 36 +/- 1 mmHg; PaCO2, 55 +/- 2 mmHg; pH = 7.16 +/- 0.04) under the following conditions: (a) intact state with infusion of vehicles alone; (b) beta-adrenergic blockade with infusion of d,l-propranolol (1.0 mg/kg bolus, 0.5 mg/kg per h); of the vasopressin pressor antagonist d-(CH2)5Tyr(methyl)arginine-vasopressin (10 micrograms/kg); and (d) simultaneous vasopressin pressor and angiotensin II inhibition with the additional infusion of 1-sarcosine, 8-alanine angiotensin II (2.0 micrograms/kg per min). The rise in mean arterial pressure during the combined blood-gas derangement with vehicles appeared to be related to increased cardiac output, since total peripheral resistance fell. Beta-adrenergic blockade abolished the fall in total peripheral resistance and diminished the rise in cardiac output during combined hypoxemia and hypercapnic acidosis, but the systemic pressor response was unchanged. In addition, the rise in mean arterial pressure during the combined blood-gas derangement was unaltered with vasopressin pressor antagonism alone. In contrast, the simultaneous administration of the vasopressin pressor and angiotensin II inhibitors during combined hypoxemia and hypercapnic acidosis resulted in the abrogation of the overall systemic pressor response despite increased cardiac output, owing to a more pronounced fall in total peripheral resistance. Circulating catecholamines were increased during the combined blood-gas derangement with vasopressin pressor and angiotensin II blockade, suggesting that the abolition of the systemic pressor response in the last 30 min of combined hypoxemia and hypercapnic acidosis was not related to diminished activity of the sympathetic nervous system. These studies show that vasopressin and angiotensin II are major contributors to the systemic pressor response during combined acute hypoxemia and hypercapnic acidosis.", 
    "18": "Chlorpromazine (CPZ) microinjected into the posterior part of the lateral hypothalamus (p-LH) and the lateral preoptic area (1-POA) of OB rats shows anti-muricide and cataleptogenic effects as well as a drowsy pattern in cortical EEG, while imipramine (IMP) injected into p-LH shows anti-muricide and cataleptogenic effects without change of cortical EEG. The present study examined the effects of drugs injected into p-LH and 1-POA on muricide, catalepsy and cortical and limbic EEG. CPZ (20, 50 micrograms) suppressed muricide and induced catalepsy and an EEG drowsy pattern in the two regions. The effects of CPZ in p-LH were similar to those of propranolol (PRO). In 1-POA, the anti-muricide effect of CPZ was similar to that of phenoxybenzamine, whereas the cataleptogenic and EEG effects were similar to those of PRO. IMP (10, 20 micrograms) in p-LH showed anti-muricide and cataleptogenic effects and induced a slight drowsy pattern in limbic EEG. The effects were similar to those of atropine. Lidocaine did not show any effects in the two regions. The cataleptogenic effects of CPZ and IMP did not appear related with the anti-muricide effects. The results suggest that the anti-muricide effect of CPZ in the hypothalamus depends on its adrenoceptor blockage, while that of IMP relates to its anticholinergic effect. In addition, beta-receptors in the hypothalamus appear related to the arousal system and dopaminergic functions.", 
    "19": "The formation of four major metabolites of propranolol by the liver was examined at steady state in three dogs that had undergone surgical portacaval transposition, following which injection of drug into the hindlimb delivers the total dose to the liver. Propranolol was infused directly into the liver via a hindlimb vein at dose rates ranging from 1.01 to 6.3 mg/min. In all dogs the formation of 4-hydroxypropranolol, alpha-naphthoxylactic acid, and propranolol glycol was saturable. Vmax and Km values were determined at steady state by relating the rate of excretion of each metabolite into bile and urine to the blood concentration of propranolol. The formation of propranolol glucuronide was a first order process. The use of a dog with a portacaval transposition has permitted development of a method to estimate, in vivo, the kinetic properties of enzymes responsible for hepatic first-pass metabolism of drugs.", 
    "20": "The effect of acute renal failure (ARF) on the pharmacokinetics of propranolol was investigated. The model of ARF was produced by the subcutaneous injection of uranyl nitrate to rats (10 mg/kg) and was used 3 d after treatment. Uranyl nitrate-treated rats showed significantly higher plasma concentrations of propranolol after oral administration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve increased about 3-fold compared to control rats. The plasma disappearance of propranolol after intravenous administration did not differ significantly between control and ARF. The mean availability of propranolol after oral administration increased from 0.120 in control to 0.215 in ARF (p less than 0.005). Absorption of propranolol was almost complete and no significant difference was found between two groups. No changes in plasma protein binding of propranolol and hepatic blood flow were observed in ARF. On the other hand, hepatic clearance of propranolol determined by liver perfusion studies showed a significant reduction in ARF and the calculated intrinsic clearance of unbound propranolol at a dose of 6.25 mg was 26.8 +/- 2.3 ml/min in control and 16.0 +/- 2.3 ml/min in ARF (p less than 0.01). These results demonstrate that the oral availability of propranolol increased in ARF due to a reduction in the hepatic presystemic elimination as compared to healthy control rats.", 
    "21": "Primary cultures of beating myocardial cells were obtained from 5-d-old offspring of trained (T) and untrained (UT), pregnant, Sprague-Dawley rats. The myocardial cells from the T and UT groups were evaluated for their beating responses to three cardioactive drugs: verapamil (V), isoproterenol (ISO), and propranolol (PRO). The myocardial cell cultures from the UT group showed complete loss of beating when the calcium (Ca++) antagonist, V, was added to the cultures for 1 h or more; the T group was able to show some beating at comparable concentrations and durations of exposure with V. The beta agonist, ISO, markedly stimulated the beating rate of both the T and UT groups, but the beating rates were higher in the UT group at comparable concentrations and durations of exposure than with the T group. When the cultures were pretreated with the beta blocker, PRO, before treatment with ISO, a concentration inhibitory effect on the beating rate was observed in both groups. However, the T cultures were more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of PRO. These results demonstrate that primary cultures of rat myocardial cells isolated from the offspring of trained and untrained pregnant rats show differential beating responses to three well-known cardioactive drugs.", 
    "22": "Fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) counteracts the inhibition of contractile strength of rabbit cardiac muscle induced by KCl \"in vitro\" and the valinomycin induced depolarization. FDP also protects in a dose-dependent fashion, up to 100 mg/kg, different strains of mice from the lethal effect of KCl that is due to a complete atrio-ventricular block and related to a high value of plasma potassium level. A protective effect of FDP is observed when increasing doses of (+/-) propranolol are injected before maximum non lethal dose of KCl.", 
    "23": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2.5 mg indapamide in 24 hypertensive patients failing to respond to oxprenolol alone. An additional 6 patients were assessed by ambulatory blood pressure recordings over a 15-hour period with a Remler M2,000 semi-automatic sphygmomanometer. On average, indapamide reduced supine blood pressure by 18.5/10 mmHg and standing blood pressure by 19.6/8.9 mmHg. The ambulatory recordings carried out in 6 patients detected a fall in diastolic pressure not observed using clinic readings in these 6 patients, suggesting that this is a more sensitive method of detecting antihypertensive effect. These responses were not associated with significant changes in heart rate or body weight and there was no significant postural fall in blood pressure. No serious side-effects were reported. Changes in serum potassium, chloride and urate similar to those seen with diuretics were observed. These results suggest that indapamide is a useful and safe adjunct to beta-adrenoceptor blocking therapy for uncontrolled hypertension.", 
    "24": "Adrenaline in concentrations of 10(-7)-10(-4) M increased the incorporation of 125I-low density lipoproteins (LDLP) into the perfused rabbit aorta, stimulating predominantly the non-specific uptake of 125I-LDLP. It was parallelled by the swelling of the endothelial lining of the aorta, expansion of the intercellular borders and an increase in the argyrophilic cell properties. The adrenoreceptor blockers phentolamine and propranolol prevented the morphological changes in the endothelium and in the incorporation of 152I-LDLP into the vascular wall. The authors feel that the catecholamine-induced damage to the endothelial lining of the aorta presents one of the mechanisms of atherogenesis stimulation following psychoemotional stress.", 
    "25": "After administration of mepindolol, a reduction of the portal pressure was demonstrated in an acute study in six patients with varying degrees of cirrhosis of the liver and in a chronic study in 5 patients. The reduction of the portal pressure did not correlate very closely with the decrease in the cardiac output. It is therefore assumed that a beta 2-receptor effect with dilatation of the splanchnic vessels is the main mechanism. However, further studies are required to clarify the situation unequivocally. The properties of mepindolol (intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, slight negatively inotropic effect, non-selective action, primarily renal elimination) appear to be advantageous in this respect.", 
    "26": "Ninety-five hypertensive out-patients, whose lying diastolic blood pressure was still greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg after a 4-week treatment with oxprenolol slow release 160 mg/day or chlorthalidone 25 mg/day, restricted their daily sodium intake for a 4-week period, while continuing to receive the previous pharmacological therapy. The dietary intervention, appositely formulated to moderately restrict sodium intake, resulted in a high patient compliance as assessed by the significant (p less than 0.01) reduction in the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion. At the end of the 4-week dietary period, a significant (p less than 0.01) decrease in lying and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed in both the oxprenolol and chlorthalidone treated groups. These results suggest that a moderate reduction in sodium intake, obtained from a low sodium diet characterized by high patient compliance and easily followed in everyday life, is effective in lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients who don't respond satisfactorily to pharmacological therapy alone.", 
    "27": "Fifteen essentially hypertensive patients were treated with a fixed combination of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist acebutolol and the diuretic substance mefruside for 6 weeks. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as the heart rate were significantly reduced. Before and after the treatment period, total-body and serum potassium were examined. Both parameters were not significantly changed. Diuretic therapy causes hypokalemia by increased potassium excretion in the distal tubulus, whereas beta-adrenoceptor antagonists could compensate this effect by a mechanism which is not yet clarified.", 
    "28": "The binding of propranolol enantiomers to human albumin (ALB), alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP) and plasma was studied. (-) propranolol is more bound than (+)propranolol to alpha 1-AGP (P less than 0.001) and to plasma (P less than 0.05). In solutions containing ALB at a constant concentration (580 mumol/l) and alpha 1-AGP at increasing concentrations, the binding of both isomers increases but the stereo selectivity is evident throughout the alpha 1-AGP concentration range examined (25-100 mumol/l).", 
    "29": "Cyclosidimine is a new vasodilator drug with a direct action on vascular smooth muscle. Oral administration of 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 mg in five normal volunteers had no effect on blood pressure in the supine position but reduced systolic and diastolic pressure in the erect position. In both positions heart rate was significantly greater after cyclosidimine than after placebo. Propranolol prevented the increases in heart rate produced by cyclosidimine which then produced greater reductions in blood pressure.", 
    "30": "Three hypotensive anaesthetic methods were compared in 123 patients undergoing middle ear microsurgery. Hypotension was induced with halothane (1 vol.%), nitroprusside (4.4 micrograms/kg/min) or the combination of halothane (0.5 vol.%) and nitroprusside (1.2 micrograms/kg/min). The compensatory rise in the heart rate was controlled with a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, practolol, the mean need for which was 0.03 mg/kg in the halothane group and 0.1 mg/kg in the other groups. The mean duration of the hypotensive period ranged from 79 to 107 min in the groups. During the hypotension, the average mean arterial pressure ranged from 55 to 60 mmHg (7.33 to 8.00 kPa) and the mean heart rate from 67 to 79 beats/min in the groups. The PaO2 value in the nitroprusside and halothane + nitroprusside groups, but not in the halothane group, decreased statistically and in some cases clinically significantly. The only peroperative side effects were ECG changes (mostly junctional rhythm), the incidence of which ranged from 16 to 24% in the groups. The mean values for the degree of haemostasis rated by the otologist on a visual analogue scale between poor (0 mm) and excellent (100 mm) were 90, 73 and 89 mm in the halothane, nitroprusside and halothane + nitroprusside groups, respectively. Recovery in the halothane group was statistically highly significantly longer than in the other groups. No rebound hypertension occurred in any of the groups after discontinuation of the hypotension. The most common side effect was nausea + vomiting, the incidence of which ranged from 15 to 26% in the groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "Hypoxaemia in fetal sheep causes a decrease in vascular resistance of the heart, brain and adrenal gland which results in increased blood flow to these organs. Placental blood flow is maintained. To investigate whether increased beta-adrenergic activity during hypoxaemia is involved in these changes, the effects of propranolol on organ blood flows (using the microsphere method) and other cardiovascular variables were studied during fetal hypoxaemia (50% reduction of fetal haemoglobin saturation) in 5 chronically catheterized fetal sheep at 126 to 130 days of gestation. Beta-blockade during hypoxaemia caused a fetal bradycardia and a 30% drop in cardiac output. Placental and myocardial blood flows fell by 39% and 37% respectively. Total peripheral resistance increased by 35% mainly due to increased fetal placental vascular resistance. Heart and lung vascular resistances increased following propranolol. In 3 similarly catheterized animals, propranolol administered in the absence of hypoxaemia led to a 9% drop in cardiac output and placental blood flow but no redistribution of blood flow to fetal organs. It is concluded that the increased beta-adrenergic activity associated with fetal hypoxaemia limits the negative chronotropic effects of concomitantly increased vagal activity, maintains placental blood flow through its inotropic and chronotropic activity as well as by maintenance of placental vasodilatation and may be one of several factors which increase myocardial blood flow during hypoxaemia.", 
    "32": "This study was carried out on 12 hospitalized hypertensive patients to assess the antihypertensive efficiency and the duration of action of a once daily dose of atenolol. 100 mg of atenolol was given at 8 am every day for 5 days. Before and during the therapeutic period. 24-h blood pressure recordings were obtained with a continuous, automatic, non-invasive method working on the principle of oscillometry (Dinamap 845.950). Atenolol induced a significant reduction in mean blood pressure from 119 +/- 3.6 to 102.3 +/- 4.7 (P less than 0.001). This effect was significant from the very first day of treatment and was maintained over the duration of the study in ten patients. The decrease in blood pressure induced by atenolol lasted 24 h. Clinical tolerance of atenolol was excellent. In particular no case of excessive bradycardia was noted.", 
    "33": "Autonomic blockade is commonly employed as a test of sinus node dysfunction. We compared primary and secondary atrial postpacing pauses and postextrasystolic sino-atrial responses before and after autonomic blockade in 56 patients with the clinical diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome. Pharmacological autonomic blockade was achieved by atropine 0.04 mg kg-1 and propranolol 0.2 mg kg-1, i.v. In a group of patients with a normal intrinsic heart rate the number of positive electrophysiologic variables associated with sinus node dysfunction declined after autonomic blockade. In 91% of these patients, sinus node function was characterized by a normal intrinsic recovery time, gradual exponential return to the constant sinus cycle length, and biphasic postextrasystolic return responses. Three patients in this group had intrinsic SA-block revealed by atrial pacing and verified by Holter monitoring. Besides normal intrinsic pacemaker properties in 53% of patients, rhythm monitoring revealed severe sinus node dysfunction as manifested by bradycardia and the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome. SA-block and sinus arrest up to 29120 ms. In the abnormal intrinsic heart rate group, disturbed intrinsic rhythmicity was characterized in all by a prolonged corrected intrinsic recovery time (2320 +/- 2740 ms [+/- SD]), arrhythmia and/or bradycardia in the secondary postpacing cycles, chaotic postextrasystolic patterns, or prolonged sinoatrial conduction times. Significantly slow minimal heart rates during sleep significantly prolonged average sinus cycle lengths and positive ECGs for sinoatrial disorders in the waking period were present on the 24-h rhythm recording. It is concluded that intrinsic heart rate obtained by autonomic blockade is the best and most simple method for the diagnosis of intrinsic sinus node dysfunction. Combined autonomic blockade and electrophysiological tests can be of great value in unmasking the severity and degree of intrinsic dysfunction and analyzing the abnormality of secondary pacemaker function. These investigations, however, are rather insensitive and therefore ineffective in detecting autonomic sinus node dysfunction. To assess the role and significance of the autonomous neurovegetative tone in the genesis of sinoatrial disorders, rhythm monitoring is required.", 
    "34": "Our goal was to determine what nervous mechanisms mediate the secretion of macromolecules from tracheal submucosal glands of ferrets. To do this, we studied the secretion of 35SO4-labeled macromolecules in vitro in response to electrical or pharmacological stimulation in the absence and presence of a specific nerve blocker and autonomic antagonists. We found that electrical field stimulation and the agonists acetylcholine, phenylephrine, terbutaline, and norepinephrine each cause secretion of radiolabeled materials. The molecular weights of the labeled materials released during base line and after electrical stimulation were greater than 1,000,000. The antagonists atropine, phentolamine, and propranolol alone prevented the responses to acetylcholine, phenylephrine, and terbutaline, respectively, without preventing responses to any other of these agonists or changing baseline secretion. Only phentolamine and propranolol together prevented the response to norepinephrine. Tetrodotoxin prevented the response to electrical stimulation but not the responses to the agonists. Each of the antagonists inhibited a significant portion of the response to electrical stimulation, but the combination of all three did not completely prevent secretion. We conclude that cholinergic nerves mediate secretion via muscarinic mechanisms, that adrenergic nerves mediate secretion via both alpha- and beta-adrenergic mechanisms, and that nonadrenergic-noncholinergic nerves mediate secretion via unidentified mechanisms.", 
    "35": "The acute intravenous effects of therapeutic doses of procainamide, lignocaine, metoprolol, digoxin and atropine on the monophasic action potentials (MAP) and effective refractory periods of the right ventricle (VERP) were studied in 48 healthy volunteers. Procainamide prolonged the VERP in the apex region. Lignocaine shortened the MAP duration at 90% repolarisation. Metoprolol did not affect any of the measured variables in spite of a significant decrease in heart rate. Digoxin produced a significant increase in the VERP at the outflow tract, but not in the apex region and the MAP variables did not change. Following atropine, the VERP at both recording sites decreased but the MAP signal was unaffected. In summary, the effects of procainamide, lignocaine, metoprolol and digoxin were in good agreement with previous studies in normal ventricular muscle cells in vitro. In addition, the findings following atropine, digoxin and procainamide are indicative of a parasympathetic innervation of the endocardial surface of the right ventricle.", 
    "36": "To determine the effect of timolol maleate on corneal epithelial wound closure, 6.4-mm (diameter) epithelial defects were created chemically in five experiments. In rabbits, wound closure was not significantly altered by the administration of 0.5% Timoptic (a commercially prepared timolol maleate solution) every eight hours, but it was inhibited during the first 15 hours of healing when a 4% solution was applied every two hours. Monkeys received a 5% solution every 12 hours and were divided into treated and control groups. Two phases of wound healing were apparent: a rapid initial phase and a slower final phase. Wound closure was inhibited in treated eyes during the initial rapid phase. This experiment repeated on the same monkeys, but with the control and treated animals switched, yielded the same result. Another experiment, with the fellow eye of the monkey used as a control, showed no significant difference in wound closure.", 
    "37": "The effects of left ventricular diastolic pressure changes on the values of the time constant (T) of isovolumic pressure fall are controversial. Normally, T is calculated either by linear regression of 1n left ventricular pressure (LVP) vs. time (TL) or by using an exponential model with asymptote (PB, extrapolated base-line pressure to which LVP would fall if decay continued indefinitely). This study, in intact dogs, has been designed to revise the effects that drugs that alter load (angiotensin and nitroprusside, without and with autonomic blockade) and inotropism (isoproterenol and propranolol) might have on the relaxation rate using different numerical methods. We found that 1) the upward or downward translation of the LVP curve had an important effect on the value of TL calculated by the semilogarithmic method; 2) when a model with asymptote was used, the simultaneous changes of T and PB, were not related to the dose of the drug; 3) the values of TL and the -dP/dt values extrapolated to 15 mmHg from a model with PB, were much more sensitive to beta-agonist or antagonist drugs than to others whose action was through load alteration. We feel that some of the earlier studies on relaxation rate determinants should be revised as possibly some of the conclusions have been based on artifacts introduced by the method chosen for the computation of the relaxation parameters.", 
    "38": "The effects of beta-agonists (epinephrine, isoproterenol, and ITP) and beta-antagonists (propranolol, metoprolol, and butoxamine) on renal potassium excretion were examined using the isolated perfused rat kidney preparation. Following 30 min of control perfusion, one of the above beta-adrenergic agonists or antagonists was added to the perfusion medium. Following epinephrine, a combined beta 1- and beta 2-agonist, urinary potassium excretion (UKV; 0.55 +/- 0.55 vs. 0.36 +/- 0.04 mueq/min, P less than 0.001) and fractional excretion of potassium (FEK; 24.6 +/- 2.4 vs. 18.2 +/- 2.0%, P less than 0.001) both decreased. When isoproterenol, a nonspecific beta-agonist, was added to the perfusate, UKV (0.49 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.27 +/- 0.04 mueq/min, P less than 0.02) and FEK (29.0 +/- 5.2 vs. 16.3 +/- 2.9%, P less than 0.01) again decreased. ITP, a specific beta 1-agonist also caused a decrease in UKV (0.60 +/- 0.13 vs. 0.39 +/- 0.04 mueq/min, P less than 0.02) and FEK (30.2 +/- 5.1 vs. 17.8 +/- 2.8%, P less than 0.02). In contrast, when propranolol, a nonspecific beta-antagonist, was added to the perfusate, the opposite effects on renal potassium handling were observed. UKV (0.45 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.70 +/- 0.07 mueq/min, P less than 0.001) and FEK (23.0 +/- 2.1 vs. 42.5 +/- 3.1%, P less than 0.001) both increased. Metoprolol (50 ng/ml), a specific beta 1-antagonist, increased UKV (0.56 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.68 +/- 0.15 mueq/min, P less than 0.02) and FEK (31.0 +/- 3.8 vs. 48.0 +/- 7.1%, P less than 0.02).

    "39": "This study examines the efferent mechanisms of carotid sinus baroreflex influence on ventricular repolarization and refractory period compared with effects on atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction. Pressure was controlled in both carotid sinuses by the Moisejeff technique in 16 chloralose-anesthetized dogs. Increases in carotid sinus pressure during pacing produced graded prolongation of AV nodal conduction, ventricular repolarization and refractory period with a threshold at a carotid sinus pressure of 120 mm Hg and a peak response at 200 mm Hg. Atropine, 0.4 mg/kg, attenuated the peak percent change in ventricular repolarization interval by only 12 +/- 14% (+/- standard error of the mean) despite a significantly greater attenuation (48 +/- 11%, p less than 0.05) in peak percent change in AV nodal conduction. However, stellate ganglionectomy attenuated the peak percent change in ventricular repolarization (42 +/- 19%), similar to effects on AV nodal conduction (59 +/- 21%, p greater than 0.25). Changes in mean arterial pressure, ventricular end-diastolic segment length or segment length shortening with systole (sonomicrometer technique) did not account for the electrophysiologic responses. Latency to peak effect on ventricular repolarization (43 +/- 7 seconds) was slower than that on AV nodal conduction (23 +/- 6 seconds, p less than 0.05). This difference in time course was not abolished by atropine. Thus, the carotid sinus baroreflex prolongs ventricular repolarization and refractoriness mainly by withdrawal of sympathetic influence; AV nodal conduction is prolonged by both vagal activation and sympathetic withdrawal. In addition, differences in time course between ventricular and AV nodal electrophysiologic responses are not explained by different efferent autonomic mechanisms.", 
    "40": "The effect of propranolol on precordial ST-segment elevation was studied in 24 patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction. The electrocardiographic response to the drug was correlated with the early angiographic appearance of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). After a 30-minute observation period, intravenous propranolol (average dose 3.5 +/- 2.2 mg) was given a mean of 2.8 +/- 1.9 hours after the onset of persistent chest pain. Coronary angiography was performed 3.6 +/- 2.0 hours after the onset of symptoms. Patients were classified into 2 groups according to the angiographic findings. Group A consisted of 7 patients with a stenotic but patent LAD and 1 patient with excellent collateral blood flow to that area. Group B consisted of 16 patients with a completely occluded LAD and poor or absent collateral blood flow. Patients in group A showed a mean reduction in precordial ST-segment elevation of 77 +/- 18% and patients in group B showed a mean reduction of 13 +/- 14% (p less than 0.005). Left ventricular ejection fraction at discharge was 0.6 +/- 0.07 in group A and 0.37 +/- 0.08 in group B (p less than 0.001). Thus, the electrocardiographic response to intravenous propranolol given early in the course of acute anterior myocardial infarction predicts the presence of blood flow to the infarcting zone. The combination of residual blood flow and reduction of ST-segment elevation secondary to propranolol is associated with preservation of ventricular function.",

    "42": "Growth hormone (GH) response to provocative tests was compared in normal short children. Seven of 23 children failed to respond to insulin hypoglycemia. Using insulin hypoglycemia followed by L-dopa only 2 of 23 children did not respond and giving bromocriptine combined with insulin hypoglycemia only 1 of 8 children failed to respond. All children submitted to propranolol followed by exercise (n = 14) and to bromocriptine followed by exercise (n = 6) responded with a satisfactory increase in plasma GH levels. The increase elicited by propranolol and exercise was higher than that induced by insulin hypoglycemia alone (p less than 0.005), exercise alone (p less than 0.05) or L-dopa after insulin hypoglycemia (p less than 0.01). The rise of GH induced by bromocriptine and exercise was higher than that obtained with insulin hypoglycemia alone (p less than 0.05). This study suggests that both adrenergic and dopaminergic mechanisms are involved in exercise induced GH release and confirms that combined tests are more useful than a single test to evaluate GH secretion.", 
    "43": "The antianginal action of a fixed combination of pindolol (7.5 mg) and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN, 30 mg slow release) was compared with placebo in sixteen patients with stable, exercise-induced angina pectoris. Exercise tests were performed on a bicycle ergometer before and 90 min after the oral application of active drug or placebo. All patients showed an ischemia-induced ST-depression in the ECG during and shortly after exercise. There was no effect of placebo on blood pressure, heart rate, ST-segment depression or work tolerance. The combination of pindolol and ISDN significantly reduced systolic blood pressure and heart rate at rest and during exercise. ST-segment depression was reduced (2 p less than or equal to 0.001), when compared with placebo at the same workload. Mean total work was higher (2 p less than or equal to 0.001) after active drug, leading to an improved exercise-tolerance in 11 out of 16 patients.", 
    "44": "The effects of single oral doses of indoramin (mean dose 58 mg), abetalol (mean dose 150 mg), alinidine 80 mg and placebo on arterial pressure and heart rate in the supine and standing positions were studied in six normal volunteers. Doses were chosen to give equivalent reductions of arterial pressure in the standing position. Observations were made before and at 2 and 4 h after drug administration. Plasma noradrenaline (NA) was measured at each time interval in the supine position, and after 4 min of standing. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was measured at each time interval after 30 min in the standing position. In the supine position, alinidine produced a significant reduction of systolic arterial pressure from 124.0 +/- 3.0 mm Hg to 104.3 +/- 4.1 mm Hg at 2 h (P less than 0.01) and to 101.7 +/- 2.2 mm Hg at 4 h (P less than 0.01). Diastolic pressure was reduced from 74.7 +/- 2.6 mm Hg to 57.0 +/- 4.6 mm Hg at 4 h (P less than 0.01). Arterial pressure was unchanged after indoramin or labetalol administration. In the supine position, heart rate was unchanged after indoramin, and small reductions were observed after labetalol and alinidine. Indoramin produced a significant increase in plasma NA. A small increase of plasma NA was observed after labetalol, and a small decrease after alinidine. In the standing position, the three active drugs reduced systolic arterial pressure to a similar extent (indoramin, -26.7 mm Hg at 4 h after drug administration; labetalol, -21.3 mm Hg at 2 h; alinidine, -21.7 mm Hg at 4 h).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "46": "Adrenergic effects on plasma levels of glucagon, insulin, glucose and free fatty acids were studied in fasted rabbits by infusing epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol, phentolamine (an adrenergic alpha-receptor blocking drug) and propranolol (an adrenergic beta-receptor blocking drug). The adrenergic effects on the plasma levels of insulin, glucose and free fatty acids were similar to those found in other species. The plasma levels of insulin were increased by beta-receptor stimulation (isoproterenol, phentolamine + epinephrine) and decreased by alpha-receptor stimulation (epinephrine, norepinephrine, propranolol + epinephrine). The plasma levels of glucose were increased by both alpha- and beta-receptor stimulation, and the epinephrine-induced hyperglycaemia was only blocked by combined infusions with phentolamine and propranolol. The plasma levels of free fatty acids were increased by saline and further increased by beta-receptor stimulation (isoproterenol), while epinephrine and norepinephrine gave variable results. Alpha-receptor stimulation (propranolol + epinephrine) slightly decreased the plasma levels of free fatty acids. The plasma levels of glucagon, however, were mainly increased by alpha-receptor stimulation (epinephrine, norepinephrine, propranolol + epinephrine) and increased only to a minor extent by beta-receptor stimulation (isoproterenol, phentolamine + epinephrine) in rabbits. This is in contrast to results reported for humans, where beta-receptor stimulation seems to be most important in stimulating glucagon release.",

The walking capacity was not affected by the antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "48": "In a double-blind trial, 30 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction with onset of symptoms within the previous 24 h were randomized to treatment with 10 mg nifedipine/placebo orally 4 times a day during hospitalization. All patients were given 15 mg metoprolol intravenously 20 min after the initial administration of nifedipine/placebo, and thereafter, 50 mg 4 times a day. The combined therapy resulted only in moderate changes in systolic blood pressure and heart rate compared with metoprolol alone. Three of the 15 patients in the nifedipine group versus 2 of the 15 in the placebo group were withdrawn because of hypotension and/or bradycardia. None was withdrawn because of congestive heart failure or A-V block. It is concluded that the combination of nifedipine and metoprolol seems to be a relatively well-tolerated combination in acute myocardial infarction.",

Clinical tremor scores and tremor amplitude as measured by an accelerometer were significantly decreased for both head and hand tremor by 160-mg/d and 320-mg/d doses of propranolol. Placebo and 80 mg/d were without effect. In individual patients, the responsiveness of head tremor tended to parallel that of hand tremor. The head tremor of essential tremor can be treated successfully with propranolol therapy.", 
    "50": "beta-Carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (beta-CCE) binds with high affinity to brain benzodiazepine receptors and has potent behavioral and physiologic effects in primates. Dose-related increases in behavioral agitation, plasma cortisol level, BP, and heart rate were observed after administration of doses between 50 and 500 micrograms/kg of beta-CCE to rhesus monkeys. All of these effects were blocked by pretreatment with diazepam. Pretreatment with clonidine hydrochloride and propranolol hydrochloride, both of which have been reported to have anxiolytic actions in man, attenuated only selective aspects of the response to beta-CCE. The behavioral, endocrine, and physiologic effects of low doses of beta-CCE in monkeys are similar to those observed in anxious patients or normal subjects under anxiety-provoking or stressful situations. Administration of benzodiazepine receptor active antagonists such as beta-CCE to primates may, therefore, provide a valid and reproducible model of human anxiety that could be used to investigate specific biologic aspects of anxiety disorders.",

Specific [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding was defined by the difference between binding in the presence and in the absence of 330 nM (+)oxprenolol. Significant binding was detected at prenatal stages. The dissociation constants (KD) of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding were similar at gestational day (GD) 19 3/4 and postnatal day (PN) 31. Binding was first detected in forebrain at GD 15 3/4.

Drugs with established cardiotonic effects include cardiac glycosides, beta 1-adrenergic agents, glucagon, histamine and the methylxanthines. New agents discussed are prenalterol, beta 2- and alpha-adrenergic drugs, amrinone and sulmazole. Prenalterol is a beta 1-adrenergic agent. Beta 2-adrenergic drugs, amrinone and sulmazole, combine a positive inotropic and a vasodilator effect. The latter resemble theophylline and other methylxanthines in that they appear to act mainly as phosphodiesterase inhibitors with a subsequent increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The mechanism of the positive inotropic effect of alpha-adrenergic stimulating agents (for example, phenylephrine) is unknown. It is independent of the cAMP system and is not accompanied by changes in frequency.",

The treatment of this category of patients requires the echocardiographic monitoring of the parameters of the central hemodynamics and myocardial contractility.", 
    "54": "Electrophoretic and enzyme techniques have been used to study the structure and function of the contractile protein system in the myocardium of dogs before and after beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Animals were examined after acute beta-adrenoceptor blockade by using intravenous atenolol (0.2 mg/kg) and following chronic therapy with oral atenolol (100 mg twice daily) for a mean period of 106 days. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide-gel electrophoretic techniques were used to examine the myocardial contractile and regulatory proteins present in endomyocardial biopsy specimens obtained after acute and chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade. No differences in charge, molecular weight or the relative proportions of actin, myosin light chains, tropomyosin or troponin-C were seen after either acute or chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The maximal activity and calcium sensitivity of the myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) was also unchanged after acute and chronic atenolol therapy. It is concluded that beta-adrenoceptor blockade has no significant adaptive effect on the structural or functional properties of the myofibril.", 
    "55": "It was shown that rRNA and HnRNA synthesis in rat liver nuclei does not change-within 30 min after intraperitoneal injection of acetylcholine (0.005 mg per 100 g of body weight) but decreases after injection of norepinephrine and epinephrine (0.05 mg per 100 g of body weight). The synthesis of rRNA (but not of HnRNA) increases after injection of hydrocortisone (2,5 mg per 100 g of body weight). The synthesis of HnRNA (but not of rRNA) increases after injection of ACTH1-24 (3 ME per 100 g of body weight) and oxytocin (1 ME per 100 g of body weight). The synthesis of rRNA decreases after injection of propranolol and atropine (0.5 mg per 100 g of body weight). At the same time, the synthesis of HnRNA does not change thereby. The inhibitory effect of propranolol and atropine was corrected by electrostimulation of hypothalamus. The content of cAMP and Ca2+ and the phosphorylation degree of nuclear proteins are increased after stimulation of hypothalamus. The phosphorylation of nuclear proteins is increased by 10(-8)-10(-6) M cAMP. The synthesis of RNA in liver nuclei is increased by 10(-6) M cAMP only after addition of cytosol. In this case the activity of RNA-polymerase II increases in a greater degree than that of RNA-polymerase I + III. It is assumed that the regulatory mechanisms of rRNA and HnRNA synthesis are different. The role of hypothalamus electrostimulation, neurotransmitters, hormones, and cAMP in the mechanisms of RNA synthesis in rat liver nuclei is discussed.", 
    "56": "In the United Kingdom, about half the patients with Graves' disease who are given antithyroid drugs are still in remission one year after treatment is stopped. The most widely held view is that such remission rates are due only to the biochemical effects of the drugs, the disease either spontaneously remitting or abating when the immune system is no longer subject to the stimulatory effects of excessive thyroid hormone. We review here the accumulating evidence against both of these alternatives. In contrast, there is now a large body of work which shows that thyrotrophin receptor antibody levels, central to the aetiology of Graves' hyperthyroidism, fall during antithyroid treatment and that remission may be related to this fall in a fashion which is dependent on the dose and duration of treatment. This immunosuppressive effect is supported by experimental data and on the basis of these results we propose that antithyroid drugs may modify the natural history of Graves' disease and contribute to the remission which occurs in a proportion of treated patients.",

Following A1 lesions there was a profound (over 100%) rise in total peripheral resistance and a fall in cardiac output which was mainly due to a fall in stroke volume since it occurred even in animals in which the heart rate was held constant by atrial pacing. This reduced stroke volume occurred despite a 40% increase in myocardial contractility (peak LV dP/dt) and elevation of left ventricular end diastolic pressure. beta-Adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol abolished the rise in peak LV dP/dt, while vagal blockade with methylscopolamine abolished the bradycardia and combined blockade with propranolol and methylscopolamine abolished the rise in peak LV dP/dt and reduced the bradycardia. In rabbits which developed pulmonary oedema, left ventricular end diastolic pressure rose to 35 +/- 3.5 compared to 16 +/- 2.7 mmHg in those which did not, suggesting that the pulmonary oedema was due to raised left ventricular filling pressure.", 
    "59": "Excellent recent trials have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that beta-blockade started during convalescence from confirmed myocardial infarction reduces mortality in the next year or two by about a quarter. Similar confidence does not extend to the mechanisms of action, choice of drug, defining treatment criteria in relation to severity and age, or to the duration of treatment.", 
    "60": "Nipradilol but not desnitro nipradilol [N-) nipradilol) inhibited the norepinephrine (NE)-induced depolarization and contraction of the rabbit portal vein. The NE-induced contraction and depolarization were also blocked by prazosin, but not blocked by yohimbine. Therefore, nipradilol possesses an alpha 1-blocking action. The order of potency was prazosin greater than nipradilol greater than yohimbine greater than (N-)-nipradilol = 0. With applications of field stimulations to muscle tissues, the smooth muscle membrane was depolarized with a latency of several seconds, and the action potential was generated. These phenomena were blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX), prazosin or nipradilol, but not by yohimbine. Isoproterenol (Isop) inhibited the 30 mM K-induced contraction, and this inhibitory action was blocked by (N-), nipradilol, nipradilol or propranolol, dose-dependently. The potency of beta-blocking actions of nipradilol was much the same as that observed by propranolol and (N-) nipradilol. When nipradilol (10(-5) M) was applied to the tissue, the amplitude of the 30 mM K contraction was slightly reduced. Such inhibitory action was not observed by application of (N-) nipradilol. The Ki values of nipradilol for blocking actions on the NE-induced contraction and Isop-induced relaxation were of the same order of 10(-7) M. Therefore, the potencies of alpha 1-blocking and beta-blocking actions of nipradilol may be the same in the rabbit portal vein. These findings suggest that the vasodilating action of nipradilol on the rabbit portal vein is mainly due to the alpha 1-blocking action and that the nitrate action of this agent may be weak.", 
    "61": "There are many reports describing the receptorial distribution in animal eyes but only a few reports concerned with human eyes. Because of this, we have studied five fresh human eyes, in vitro, by a very sensitive method. We have proved the existence of alpha exciting and beta 2 relaxing receptors on the iridial dilatator muscle and the absence of cholinergic, serotoninergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic receptors. On the contrary, on the circular muscle we have found muscarin cholinergic receptors without adrenergic ones.", 
    "62": "The secretion of tears was evaluated by the Schirmer test in 96 patients and 66 controls. This article reports on the pharmacologic and not the immunologic effects of adrenergic beta-blockers on tear flow. The facilitation of lacrimal flow depends not only on the parasympathetic nerves but also on the beta adrenergic nerves. We found that the unselective adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, decreased the tear flow while, oxprenolol because of its intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, did not decrease significantly lacrimal secretion.", 
    "63": "The disposition and metabolism of amosulalol hydrochloride, a combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, were studied in rats, dogs and monkeys. After oral administration of [14C]amosulalol hydrochloride, the plasma concentration of radioactivity reached a maximum at 0.5 to 1 h in all species and declined with half-lives of about 2 h in both rats and monkeys, and of about 4 h in dogs. The ratios of unchanged drug to total radioactivity in the rat and dog plasma were 8 and 43% at 0.5 h after administration, respectively. The radioactivity in the rat tissues was high in the liver, kidney, blood and pancreas after oral administration. Following oral dosage, the urinary excretion of radioactivity was 26-34% of the dose in rats, 45% in dogs and 46% in monkeys in 48 h. The biliary excretion after oral dosage amounted to 66% and 41% in rats and dogs, respectively. Six metabolites were isolated and identified from the urine of rats and dogs. They were derived from one or two of the following pathways: I, hydroxylation of the 2-methyl group of the methylbenzenesulphonamide ring; II, demethylation of the o-methoxy group of the methoxyphenoxy ring; III, hydroxylation at the 4 or 5 position of the methoxyphenoxy ring; IV, oxidative cleavage of the C-N bond yielding o-methoxyphenoxy acetic acid. Moreover, some metabolites were metabolized to glucuronide or sulphate.", 
    "64": "The pharmacokinetics of an alpha, beta-adrenoceptor blocker, amosulalol hydrochloride, were studied after i.v. and oral administration to rats, dogs and monkeys. After an i.v. dose (1 mg/kg), the plasma concentration-time curve fitted a two-compartment open model with terminal half-lives of 2.5 h in rats, 2.1 h in dogs and 1.8 h in monkeys. The order of plasma clearances for amosulalol was: rats greater than dogs greater than monkeys. After oral administration, the maximum plasma concentration was obtained at 0.5-1 h in rats (10-100 mg/kg) and dogs (3-30 mg/kg), and at 1.7-2.7 h in monkeys (3-10 mg/kg). A linear relationship between the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and dose administered was obtained for all three species. The systemic availabilities of the drug in rats, dogs and monkeys were 22-31%, 51-59% and 57-66%, respectively. After repeated oral administration (10 mg/kg) to dogs for 15 days, the pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly from those on the first day.", 
    "65": "Esmolol is an ultra-short-acting beta-blocker currently in Phase II clinical trials. The ester functionality in esmolol results in rapid metabolism of the beta-blocker into an acidic metabolite and methanol. Dichloromethane was used to denature blood esterases and quantitatively extract esmolol from the blood. A deuterated analogue of esmolol was selected as the internal standard, and both compounds were chromatographed as the trimethylsilyl derivatives. Blood levels of esmolol were quantitated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with selective-ion monitoring, focusing on specific ions corresponding to esmolol and the internal standard. The lower limit of sensitivity of the assay was 2.5 ng/mL. Using the assay, blood samples from a dose-ranging study in humans were analyzed for concentrations of esmolol. Steady-state blood levels of esmolol after intravenous infusion rates of 40, 100, 200, 300, 450, and 650 micrograms/kg/min were 0.202, 0.464, 0.977, 1.31, 1.92, and 2.97 micrograms/mL of blood. The elimination t1/2 and total body clearance were estimated to be approximately 10 min and 220 mL/kg/min, respectively. The high clearance of esmolol suggested that metabolism by blood esterase(s) was the primary determinant of the duration of action of the drug.", 
    "66": "Graded intravenous isoprenaline infusions produce dose-related increases in finger tremor. The dose-response curves constructed with intra-arterial or intravenous isoprenaline behave similarly in the presence of both atenolol 50 mg and propranolol 40 mg. In Five subjects, practolol 120 mg, atenolol 50 mg, propranolol 40 mg and sotalol 200 mg reduced exercise heart rate by 20.2 +/- 2.3, 21.4 +/- 1.8, 17.4 +/- 2.5, 23.9 +/- 3.6% respectively: the differences were not significant. The corresponding dose-ratios for reduction of an isoprenaline tachycardia were 2.8, 2.3, 19.1 and 16.9 respectively. At doses which had comparable effects on an exercise tachycardia, the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, propranolol 40 mg and sotalol 200 mg, attenuated the finger response to isoprenaline (dose ratios 33.3 and greater than 25.0 respectively) more than the beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonists, practolol 120 mg and atenolol 50 mg (dose ratios 1.0 and 2.3 respectively). In two out of five subjects, dose-response curves could not be constructed with sotalol, either at a dose of 200 or 100 mg. The enhancement of physiological finger tremor by intravenous infusions of isoprenaline may be useful in the investigation of beta 2-adrenoceptors and their antagonists in man.", 
    "67": "The sympathetic nervous control of rectal motility was studied in anesthetized cats. Division of the sympathetic nerves, i.e. the hypogastric nerves and the lumbar colonic nerves and alpha-adrenergic blockade reduced rectal tone indicating that these nerves are tonically active. Efferent electrical stimulation of the nerves at high intensities caused an immediate and sustained contraction which was inhibited after phentolamine but unaffected by hexamethonium suggesting a direct alpha-adrenergic effect on the rectal smooth muscle. However when prevailing rectal tone was high beta-adrenergic inhibitory responses unaffected by hexamethonium were observed. In addition the hypogastric nerves seem to convey cholinergic excitatory fibres to the rectum. The results imply that the sympathetic nerves are integrated in the nervous regulation of rectal motility in a fashion similar to the nervous control of the internal anal sphincter.", 
    "68": "The effects of 3 beta-adrenergic agonists (clenbuterol, isoproterenol and salbutamol) on the spontaneous motor activity of mice were studied. The present research indicated that motor activity was significantly decreased 30 minutes after IP injection of either clenbuterol (0.06 mg/kg), isoproterenol (0.5 mg/kg) or salbutamol (2 mg/kg). Hypomotility induced by clenbuterol was also significantly antagonized by propranolol in doses ranging from 1 to 8 mg/kg and by penbutolol in doses from 0.03 to 0.5 mg/kg. However, practolol, which does not cross the blood brain barrier, did not antagonize the effect of clenbuterol. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that beta adrenergic agonists decrease motor activity by a central mechanism. It was also found that tachyphylaxis or resistance to treatment, observed in cardiovascular and bronchopulmonary systems with beta-adrenergic agonists, developed after 7 injections of clenbuterol (0.25 mg/kg IP, twice daily) in the behavioral model of spontaneous motor activity in mice.", 
    "69": "(-)-Isoprenaline and the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist RO363 were tested for their inotropic effects in left atrial (beta 1) and relaxant effects in K+-depolarized uterine (beta 2) preparations from the guinea-pig. The drugs had similar activities as positive inotropic agents but RO363 was approximately 400 times less active than (-)-isoprenaline as a uterine relaxant. RO363 had intrinsic activities of 0.8 and 0.25 ((-)-isoprenaline = 1) in atrial and uterine preparations, respectively. Apparent dissociation constants (KD values) determined from the ability of the agonists to displace (-)-[125I]-iodocyanopindolol ([125I]-CYP) bound to membranes prepared from both tissues were used as a measure of affinity. The [125I]-CYP binding sites possessed the characteristics of homogeneous populations of beta 1-adrenoceptors in atrial and beta 2-adrenoceptors in uterine membrane preparations. The pKD values for (-)-isoprenaline were similar in the two tissues (left atria 6.4, uterus 6.0) whilst for RO363 the atrial value (7.8) was considerably greater than that for the uterus (6.0). The latter value is very similar to the pKB value determined from shifts in (-)-isoprenaline curves produced by RO363 in uterine preparations. Graphical plots of the fraction of receptors occupied vs response were constructed. The relative efficacy of (-)-isoprenaline with respect to RO363 was calculated to be 25 in atrial and 2633 in uterine preparations. The selective beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulant actions of RO363 are a reflection of both its greater affinity and efficacy for beta 1- as opposed to beta 2-adrenoceptor sites. The potent actions of (-)- isoprenaline in both tissues are largely dependent on efficacy.", 
    "70": "Lung inflation is known to produce reflex relaxation of tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) and dilation of the upper airway, but the specific efferent pathway involved has not been established. Therefore we examined TSM tone in four trained awake dogs by measuring pressure changes in the water-filled cuff of an endotracheal tube that was inserted into the lower cervical trachea through a permanent tracheostomy. Under control conditions, sustained lung inflation with 1 liter of air produced apnea (Hering-Breuer inflation reflex) and a decrease in cuff pressure (Pcuff) of 37.4 +/- 12.0 (mean +/- SD) cmH2O. beta-Adrenergic blockade with propranolol had no effect on either the apneic or TSM responses to lung inflation. Efferent parasympathetic blockade with atropine sulfate (1.2-2.4 mg) abolished TSM tone, which was then restored to control levels by a continuous intravenous infusion of serotonin (14-28 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1). Under these conditions, lung inflation still induced reflex apnea but no longer relaxed TSM tone (mean decrease in Pcuff, 2.7 +/- 1.4 cmH2O, P less than 0.001). The findings indicate that reflex tracheal dilation in response to lung inflation is mediated by an efferent cholinergic (parasympathetic) pathway.", 
    "71": "Hypertension in pregnancy has implications for both maternal and fetal welfare. Extrapolation from concepts of mechanisms operating in hypertension in general to pregnancy-related hypertension is not justified. In the latter, the major features are a hyper-adrenergic state, plasma volume reduction and an increased systemic resistance. A reduction in uteroplacental perfusion may result from or may activate the mechanisms that elevate blood pressure. Humoral factors (e.g. hormonal attenuation of vascular reactivity) and prostacyclin deficiency may be central to the disordered physiology. Treatment of hypertension in pregnancy should aim at avoiding the vascular damage due to blood pressure elevation but not cause a reduction in uteroplacental perfusion. Unlike earlier antihypertensive regimens using centrally acting sympatholytics, adrenergic neuron blockers or diuretics, regimens using beta-blockers or combinations of beta-blockers with alpha-blockers or vasodilating agents such as hydralazine permit effective blood pressure control, even in severe hypertension, and pregnancy can often proceed until term or until fetal maturity is secured. Adverse effects on the fetus (growth retardation, cardiorespiratory depression, hypoglycaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia) formerly attributed to beta-blockers are more likely related to poorly controlled hypertension. Specific benefits of maternal beta-adrenoceptor blockade are suggested by evidence for prevention of proteinuric deterioration and a decrease in the incidence and severity of respiratory distress in premature infants. Hypertension in pregnancy still presents a formidable therapeutic challenge and requires comprehensive management with close monitoring of fetal welfare. The presence or development of proteinuria in a hypertensive pregnant woman implies a major increase in risk to the fetus and warrants immediate admission to hospital for specialist management.", 
    "72": "Studies of two models of human glucose counterregulation, glucose recovery from insulin-induced hypoglycemia and the transition from exogenous glucose delivery to endogenous glucose production late after glucose ingestion, indicate that the principles of rapid hypoglycemic and nonhypoglycemic glucose counterregulation in these models are the same. 1) Neither is solely explicable on the basis of dissipation of insulin; 2) glucagon plays a primary counterregulatory role in both; 3) epinephrine compensates largely for deficient glucagon secretion in both; and 4) counterregulation fails to occur only in the absence of both glucagon and epinephrine in both. Thus, prevention as well as correction of hypoglycemia is effectively accomplished by redundant glucose counterregulatory systems, primarily glucagon and secondarily epinephrine, coupled with dissipation of insulin in humans. Other hormones, neural mechanisms, or autoregulation may be involved but need not be invoked and are not sufficiently potent to prevent or correct hypoglycemia when both of the key glucose counterregulatory hormones, glucagon and epinephrine, are deficient. Although confirmed in that they predict the impact of disease-related deficiencies of glucagon, epinephrine, or both, the extent to which these principles can be generalized to additional models of glucose counterregulation remains to be established. However, they provide a basis for plausible, testable hypotheses concerning the physiology and pathophysiology of glucose counterregulation.", 
    "73": "Many recent studies provide evidence that increased platelet activation occurs in a significant number of patients with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. The mechanisms responsible for this activation are unknown, although there have been studies suggesting a correlation with abnormal lipoproteinemia, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. We studied 84 patients undergoing standardized treadmill exercise using either a Bruce [N = 63] or symptom-limited Naughton protocol [N = 21]. In contrast to ten healthy volunteer subjects, the patient group demonstrated a significant increase in plasma concentrations of platelet factor 4 [PF4] between pre- and postexercise blood samples confirming earlier reports of exercise-induced platelet activation and secretion. As with previous studies, however, only a subset of patients demonstrated this response. When the entire group was analyzed for the presence or absence of electrocardiographic ischemic changes and the presence of documented versus suspected coronary artery occlusions, there were no differences noted between groups that explained the variable responses measured. However, there was a significant difference between patient groups when analyzed by whether or not they were being treated with beta-blocking agents. Patients who were being treated with propranolol or one of the longer-acting beta-blocking agents did not have a significant increase in plasma PF4 following exercise, in contrast to patients who were not beta-blocked. Plasma concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and lactic acid were measured in 49 patients and all normal subjects. There was no correlation between the changes in plasma PF4 concentrations and any of these three variables, suggesting that platelet activation was not occurring through direct platelet activation by circulating catecholamines. This study provides further evidence that there is a subset of CAD patients with platelet hyperactivity. This is the first time that beta-blockade has been demonstrated to modify this platelet response. The effectiveness of beta-blocking agents in CAD may be in part related to their antiplatelet effect.", 
    "74": "Bucindolol is a newly developed, nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and direct vasodilator properties. In 14 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, the effects of bucindolol, hydrochlorothiazide and their combination on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and parameters of the renin-aldosterone system were compared with those after placebo. Bucindolol's antihypertensive effect was evident within the first hour after drug administration, maximal at 2 to 3 hours, and lasted for as long as 12 hours. Compared with placebo values (108 +/- 5 mm Hg), both bucindolol (97 +/- 9 mm Hg) and hydrochlorothiazide (99 +/- 10 mm Hg) alone significantly and comparably reduced the 12-hour averaged standing diastolic BP, with the combination resulting in approximately additive effects (91 +/- 9 mm Hg). Although bucindolol alone did not affect HR, it attenuated the hydrochlorothiazide-induced increase in HR. There was a tendency for bucindolol to decrease plasma renin activity. Except for transient postural hypotension in 2 patients, bucindolol was well tolerated.", 
    "75": "Patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were treated with beta-blockers and diuretics given separately and in combination. During single-drug therapy, the majority of patients exhibited clearly superior antihypertensive responses to either one type of drug or the other; only rarely were the beta-blockers and the diuretic equally effective in an individual patient. A poor response to diuretic therapy tended to predict a good response to a beta-blocker, and vice versa. Pretreatment renin measurements were not helpful in predicting the differing responses to single-drug treatment in this study population. These findings indicate that when one of these types of drug is ineffective as monotherapy in treating hypertension, the other type should be substituted before considering combination treatment. Combined therapy with the beta-blockers and diuretics also gave variable results, although poor antihypertensive responses could be attributed to excessive stimulation of the renin-aldosterone system by the diuretic component of the combination. The effectiveness of this form of treatment might thus be enhanced by the use of low diuretic doses.", 
    "76": "Beta-blocking agents are widely used in the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease. Their negative chronotropic and inotropic actions may alter the effects of physical training in cardiac rehabilitation programs. Therefore, resting and exercise cardiac output, stroke volume, heart rate, and arteriovenous oxygen content difference were measured before and after training in 15 male patients with coronary artery disease, who were treated with beta blockers, and in a control group of 14 patients not treated with beta-blocking agents. At the end of a 3-month training period, oxygen uptake at peak exercise increased similarly in the two groups, 37% and 34%, respectively; this was related to increases in stroke volume and heart rate, and therefore cardiac output, and to increases in arteriovenous oxygen content difference. The effects were similar whether or not the patients were treated with beta blockers. Also, at rest and submaximal exercise, beta blockade did not affect the training-induced changes of cardiac output, heart rate, and arteriovenous oxygen content difference. In both groups heart rate decreased with training while stroke volume and cardiac output increased significantly. In conclusion, beta blockade did not significantly alter the hemodynamic effects of training.", 
    "77": "Novel [(arylcarbonyl)oxy]propanolamines were synthesized and investigated as potential ultrashort-acting beta-adrenergic receptor blockers. Many of these analogues exhibited good potency and short duration. The N-ureidoalkyl analogue 85 (ACC-9089) has a potency equal to propranolol and a duration of action of about 21 min in the dog. It has been selected as a candidate for further clinical study. Structure-activity relationships and structure-duration relationships for these new beta-blockers are also discussed.", 
    "78": "The modulatory effects of alpha adrenergic drugs on the induction of rat pineal acetyl-CoA:arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity were characterized using both in vivo and organ culture techniques. Intraperitoneal administration of phenoxybenzamine (POB) to rats was followed by a 2- to 3-fold increase in activity of pineal NAT, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the putative pineal hormone melatonin. The increase was greater than 60-fold when POB was administered to ganglionectomized rats. NAT induction after POB administration to ganglionectomized rats was not influenced by adrenalectomy, suggesting that the response to POB was not mediated through the release of catecholamines from adrenomedullary catecholamine stores. To determine whether the pharmacologic site of the activity of POB was located within the pineal body itself, pineals were incubated with POB in organ culture. Significant induction of pineal NAT was not observed when pineals were cultured with POB alone. However, POB shifted the dose-response curve for NAT induction by norepinephrine (NE) to the left. Modulation of NAT induction by POB in organ culture was blocked by dl-propranolol HCl, suggesting that such modulation is mediated through a beta adrenergic mechanism. POB did not modulate NE-mediated NAT induction in pineals extracted from superior cervical ganglionectomized rats. Similarly, the modulatory response to POB was eliminated by 24-hr preincubation in culture medium. These results suggest that elements that are disrupted after ganglionectomy or during a period of preincubation are vital for expression of the modulatory activity of POB.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "79": "The cardiovascular effects of the dihydropyridine slow channel calcium blocking agents, nifedipine, nitrendipine, FR 34235, niludipine and nisoldipine were compared to the vasodilator, hydralazine, in conscious, instrumented dogs before and after propranolol (2 mg/kg i.v.). The calcium-blocking agents (1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 and 25.0 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) and hydralazine (0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.25 mg/kg/min i.v.) produced dose-related decreases in blood pressure and reflex increases in heart rate and heart rate-systolic pressure product, an index of myocardial oxygen consumption. Hydralazine also produced a reflex increase in myocardial contractility (+dP/dt); however, minimal changes in contractility were observed with the dihydropyridines. Nisoldipine, nitrendipine and FR 34235 were relatively more effective in reducing arterial pressure than niludipine, nifedipine and hydralazine. For any given reduction in pressure, hydralazine produced the greatest reflex tachycardia at low doses. Of the calcium channel blockers, nifedipine produced the greatest and niludipine the least reflex tachycardia. Propranolol attenuated the reflex increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product produced by all vasodilators studied. Only slight changes in global contractility were observed after combined use of the dihydropyridines and propranolol. Nisoldipine, FR 34235 and nifedipine produced the greatest coronary vasodilation whereas niludipine, nitrendipine and hydralazine were less effective. In addition, the dihydropyridines produced a greater increase in systolic than diastolic flow. The present results demonstrate that while all dihydropyridine calcium channel blocking agents exhibit many similarities, certain differences exist. Furthermore, the \"reflex\" tachycardia observed with these drugs was not solely related to the degree of reduction in arterial pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
