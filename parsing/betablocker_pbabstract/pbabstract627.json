    "0": "In a double blind, within patient investigation of twenty-four patients (nineteen males and five females) with a mean age of 46.3 years (SD 10.9 years) with mild to moderate essential hypertension a comparison between equipotent beta-blocking doses of propranolol, metoprolol and labetalol was carried out. Blood pressure and pulse rate were measured in lying, sitting and standing positions and before, during and after isometric and dynamic exercise. Peak expiratory flow was recorded before and during dynamic exercise. All the active treatments were better than placebo in reducing blood pressure and heart rate. Comparing the effects of treatment, labetalol lowered sitting diastolic pressure significantly more than propranolol and standing diastolic pressure than both propranolol and metoprolol. Metoprolol and propranolol were more effective in reducing heart rate. Propranolol significantly reduced peak flow rate compared to labetalol. During the exercise, both isometric and dynamic, the heart rate and the blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic, of the treated patients were lower than those on placebo. There was little difference between the drugs in the influence on blood pressure, but metoprolol and propranolol were significantly more effective than labetalol in lowering the heart rate.", 
    "1": "The metabolic and hormonal responses to exhaustive short-term supramaximal exercise were studied in 10 male physical education students. The exercise task was a single bout of running on the treadmill at 22 km X h-1 and 7.5% slope. It was performed with single oral doses of 100 mg Bupranolol (non-selective beta-blockade), 100 mg Metoprolol (beta-1-selective blockade), and placebo. Arterialized capillary and venous blood were sampled until 30 min post exercise. Time to exhaustion was 52.0 +/- 2.6, 47.6 +/- 2.0, and 46.0 +/- 1.9 s in the control, Metroprolol, and Bupranolol experiments. At cessation of exercise, adrenaline and noradrenaline were grossly elevated in all three conditions. Lactate and glucose increased markedly, this being accompanied by increasing insulin in the control and Metoprolol, but not the Bupranolol trials. Glycerol increased moderately, while FFA were depressed. Growth hormone showed a delayed increase at 15 and 30 min post exercise. Cortisol was unaffected by exercise. beta-blockade reduced the increases of lactate, glucose, glycerol, insulin, and growth hormone, exaggerated the depression of FFA and had no effect on cortisol. The results demonstrate that the strong sympatho-adrenal response to exercise of this nature is a major determinant of the increase of glucose at cessation of exercise. The hyperglycemia in concert with beta-2-adrenergic stimulation leads to elevation of insulin. Furthermore, lipolysis is controlled by beta-adrenergic stimulation. The delayed increase of growth hormone seems to be triggered by the declining glucose level during recovery.", 
    "2": "The angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (MK-421), at a dose of 1 mg/kg or more by gavage twice daily, effectively inhibited the pressor response to angiotensin I for more than 12 h and less than 24 h. Plasma renin activity (PRA) did not change after 2 or 4 days of treatment at 1 mg/kg twice daily despite effective ACE inhibition, whereas it rose significantly at 10 mg/kg twice daily. Blood pressure fell significantly and heart rate increased in rats treated with 10 mg/kg of enalapril twice daily, a response which was abolished by concomitant angiotensin II infusion. However, infusion of angiotensin II did not prevent the rise in plasma renin. Enalapril treatment did not change urinary immunoreactive prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) excretion and indomethacin did not modify plasma renin activity of enalapril-treated rats. Propranolol significantly reduced the rise in plasma renin in rats receiving enalapril. None of these findings could be explained by changes in the ratio of active and inactive renin. Water diuresis, without natriuresis and with a decrease in potassium urinary excretion, occurred with the higher dose of enalapril. Enalapril did not potentiate the elevation of PRA in two-kidney one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats. In conclusion, enalapril produced renin secretion, which was in part beta-adrenergically mediated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "A review is made to sum up the indications when diuretics may be the drug of choice in the treatment of hypertension. Advantages from the combined treatment of thiazide diuretics and other antihypertensive agents are also emphasized. Adverse effects from diuretic treatment, i.e. hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, impaired glucose tolerance and risks associated with unfavourable serum lipoprotein patterns are discussed. It is concluded that from a hemodynamic point of view thiazide diuretics can be a good therapeutic alternative for most patients, excepting those with hyperkinetic circulation. It is recommended to use lower doses of thiazide diuretics than previously and the monitoring of S-potassium is necessary in all patients.", 
    "4": "A review is made of the metabolic side effects of diuretics and beta-adrenoceptorblockers. The review is based on results from a population study, performed by the author, of women and on a survey of the literature. While diuretics give rise to hypokalemia, which may be of clinical importance, beta-adrenoceptorblockers tend to increase the serum potassium levels. This does not, however, seem to be of clinical significance. Both diuretics and beta-adrenoceptorblockers increase serum uric acid levels. Beta-adrenoceptorblockers increase serum triglycerides, which is not observed when diuretics are used. Total cholesterol in serum is usually not changed either by diuretics or by beta-adrenoceptorblockers. These drugs seem to have no influence on body weight when studied during long-term treatment. A further deterioration of glucose tolerance may be expected in subjects with an initially impaired glucose tolerance when diuretics are administered, while results from studies on glucose tolerance in subjects taking beta-adrenoceptorblockers have been controversial. Diabetes mellitus seems to be more common among subjects on diuretics as well as among subjects on beta-adrenoceptorblockers, but as yet it cannot be stated whether this is an effect of the antihypertensive drugs or of the hypertension per se or of some other factor or factors.", 
    "5": "Forty-seven male patients with essential hypertension were randomized to treatment with either a beta-adrenoceptorblocker (metoprolol), (n = 24), or a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide), (n = 23). If their diastolic blood pressure was not lowered below 95 mm Hg by the maximum dose of either drug, hydralazine (15 patients) and in a few cases (6 patients) spironolactone was given. After five years of treatment all the patients were examined with respect to intraerythrocyte sodium (IeNa) and potassium (IeK), sodium influx and sodium efflux. Patients treated with the diuretic (D) tended to have a higher IeNa (9.8 +/- 0.4 mmol/l red cells) and sodium influx (0.044 +/- 0.002 mmol Na/l X min) compared with those taking the beta-adrenoceptorblocker (B) (8.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/l and 0.041 +/- 0.002 mmol Na/l X min), but neither of these differences was statistically significant. Sodium efflux, however, was significantly increased in D (0.073 +/- 0.003 mmol Na/l X min vs 0.061 +/- 0.003 mmol/l X min). No difference in IeK was noted between the two groups. Six patients taking spironolactone had a low IeNa (7.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/l), sodium influx (0.039 +/- 0.001 mmol Na/l X min) and sodium efflux (0.050 +/- 0.006 mmol Na/l X min).", 
    "6": "At present beta-blockers are the therapy recommended in hyperkinetic heart syndrome. This therapeutical advice was investigated by two cross over studies: the first trial was a comparison between the circulatory effects of Celiprolol and Pindolol, the second one between Oxprenolol and the calcium antagonist Verapamil. All beta-blockers tested effected a safe reduction in heart rate, which is elevated in hyperkinetic state, but failed to lower diastolic blood pressure by at least 15 mm Hg. Verapamil however, also effected bradycardia but did not reduce heart-rate in the same amount as beta-blockers. Furthermore the calcium antagonist's hypotensive effects are more pronounced by comparison with beta-blockers. According to these findings beta-blockers are not to be seen as therapy of first choice in hyperkinetic heart syndrome, they are only recommended combined with diuretics or vasodilators. As alternative therapy Verapamil could be prescribed, which disadvantage is the necessity of taking it several times per day.", 
    "7": "Ischaemic heart disease is the main cause of death. Most of these deaths are sudden and occur within the first few hours of onset of symptoms and before the patient reaches the hospital. It is generally accepted, that sudden death is due to ventricular fibrillation. The aim of this presentation is to review the studies of long-term antiarrhythmic therapy and beta-blockade in the prevention of sudden cardiac death. Studies, in which a given antiarrhythmic drug was routinely applied, have universally failed to show any protective effect. However, when effective patient specific drugs are selected during programmed ventricular stimulation, long-term treatment in high risk patients may be beneficial. Recently suggestive evidence has been presented, that long-term beta-blockade is beneficial in preventing sudden death and reducing overall mortality in ischaemic heart disease although the antiarrhythmic properties of beta-blockers are relatively weak.", 
    "8": "The effects of adrenergic agonists and antagonists on blood pressure and heart rate were investigated in 18 chronically catheterised pig fetuses aged between 102 and 109 days of gestation (term is 114 days). One fetus had been decapitated in utero at 42 days of gestation. The alpha adrenergic agonist methoxamine produced a small but dose dependent hypertension and a dose related slowing in heart rate. The beta adrenergic agonist isoprenaline decreased mean arterial pressure in a dose related manner and produced tachycardia. Propranolol, a beta adrenergic blocker, increased mean arterial pressure and decreased heart rate. The response to subsequent alpha adrenergic blockade with phentolamine was hypotension and a slight bradycardia. Decapitation at 42 days of gestation did not seem to change the fetal responsiveness to adrenergic agonists but removed the blood pressure response to beta blockade. These observations indicate that the heart and circulation of the pig fetus are under adrenergic vasomotor control during late gestation.", 
    "9": "The electromyographic activity (EMG) of the uterus was recorded in vivo in 6 conscious ovariectomized ewes treated with oestrogen. In 6 cyclic ewes, changes in intrauterine pressure were recorded at the same time as the EMG. Motor responses to noradrenaline, isoprenaline and adrenaline injections were studied at 3 uterine sites in the ovariectomized ewes. Uterine activity was stimulated by noradrenaline and inhibited by isoprenaline, providing evidence that there were both alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors in the myometrium of the oestrogen-treated ovariectomized ewes. Adrenaline caused an increase of myometrial activity at the cervical end and the middle of the uterine horn, demonstrating that alpha-receptors were predominant. Adrenaline had little effect on activity at the tubal end of the horn, but after the administration of propranolol, a blocker of beta-adrenergic receptors, there was a stimulatory effect. These results show that the alpha-receptor/beta-receptors, there was a stimulatory effect. These results show that the alpha-receptor/beta-receptor ratio along the uterine horn was not constant. In cyclic ewes, the effects of noradrenaline and adrenaline in the middle of the uterine horn were stimulatory during oestrus and luteal phase, indicating that alpha-receptors were predominant in that region under both oestrogenic and progesteronic dominance. The perfusion of phentolamine, a blocker of alpha-adrenergic receptors, into ovariectomized ewes treated with oestrogen provided evidence that endogenous catecholamines modulate uterine activity.", 
    "10": "A review of anxiolytic drugs is presented, including ethyl alcohol, barbiturates, diphenylmethane derivatives, glycerol and propanediol derivatives, antipsychotics, and antidepressants. Focus on the benzodiazepines and their metabolism and method of action follows. The newest two groups are then reviewed: triazolobenzodiazepines and azaspirodecanediones. The first member of this latter group, buspirone, is then reviewed in detail including the author's personal studies of the drug. The fact that it appears nonaddicting, nonsynergistic with alcohol, lacks impairment of driving-related skills, and is very effective in treating anxiety, may represent a breakthrough.", 
    "11": "The ethyl ester of beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid (beta-CCE) has a high affinity for benzodiazepine receptors and can antagonize some of the pharmacologic actions of benzodiazepines in rodents. Administration of beta-CCE (2.5 mg/kg) to chair-adapted, male rhesus monkeys (7-9 kg) elicited a behavioral syndrome characterized by extreme agitation, head and body turning, distress vocalization and other behaviors which might be termed 'anxious'. Concomitant increases in plasma cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, heart rate, and mean arterial blood pressure were observed. Pretreatment of animals with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 (5 mg/kg) antagonized the behavioral, endocrine, and somatic changes produced by beta-CCE, but did not elicit any significant changes in these parameters when administered alone. Thus, administration of beta-CCE to primates may be a reliable and reproducible model of human anxiety and, as much, may prove valuable for studying the postulated role of 'stress' or 'anxiety' in a variety of human disorders. In toto, these results strongly suggest that benzodiazepine receptors not only mediate the pharmacologic actions of benzodiazepines, but may also subserve both the affective and physiologic expression of anxiety.", 
    "12": "The effects of intrarenal administration of isoproterenol on excretion of urinary enzymes were examined in dogs. Urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GTP) originated from lysosomes and the brush border membrane of the kidney, respectively. NAG excretion was elevated for 10 min by isoproterenol (0.2 microgram/kg/min) without a drastic change in glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow. This elevation was inhibited by pretreatment with d,l-propranolol (0.6 mg/kg bolus injection 0.3 mg/kg/30 min) but less so by d-propranolol. Urinary gamma-GTP excretion was little affected by isoproterenol. In light of these findings, the possibility that beta-receptors may be involved in the excretion of NAG has to be considered.", 
    "13": "Effects of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation by phenylephrine (10(-7)-10(-4) mol/l) in the presence of pindolol (10(-7) mol/l) on the action potential and force of contraction were observed in the rabbit left atrium. Phenylephrine reduced resting potential, prolonged action potential duration (APD), decreased maximum rate of rise of action potential (Vmax) and increased force of contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. Effects of phenylephrine (10(-5) mol/l) were antagonized by prazosin (10(-7) mol/l) or phentolamine (10(-6) mol/l). APD which had been prolonged by phenylephrine (10(-5) mol/l) was slightly shortened by Ni2+ (0.3 mmol/l) at the level of 50% repolarization but almost unaffected at the level of 90% repolarization. TTX (10(-6) mol/l) had no effect on ADP which had been prolonged by phenylephrine (10(-5) mol/l). Cs+ (10 mmol/l), which inhibits outward current ik1, depolarized resting potential, but in contrast with phenylephrine Cs+ did not affect APD at 90% repolarization. Phenylephrine (10(-5) or 3 X 10(-5) mol/l) restored Ca2+-dependent action potential and force of contraction in 20 mmol/K+-Tyrode solution. These responses were suppressed by prazosin (10(-7) mol/l) or Ni2+ (0.3 mmol/l). Phenylephrine (10(-5) or 10(-4) mol/l) had no effect on steady-state membrane potential--Vmax relationship. It is concluded that in the rabbit left atrium phenylephrine, via alpha-adrenoceptors may suppress outward currents perhaps ik1 and ix, and might increase slow inward current.", 
    "14": "The effects of PGs (PGA2, PGB2, PGE2, PGF2 alpha, PGI2, and 6-keto PGF1 alpha) were investigated quantitatively in insolated bovine mesenteric lymphatics for elucidating the possible significance of PGs in lymph propulsion. 10(-8) M PGF2 alpha, PGA2, and PGB2 produced recognizable increases of frequency and amplitude of spontaneous contractions. The positive chrono- and inotropic responses were enhanced with increasing concentration of the PGs from 10(-8) to 10(-6) M. Both PGE2 and PGI2 in a concentration range from 10(-8) to 10(-6) M caused dose-related reductions in the amplitude of spontaneous contractions. No decrease in contraction rhythm was observed by the administration of PGI2 and PGE2 at concentrations lower than 5 X 10(-7)M. All of the above-mentioned responses induced by PGF2 alpha, PGA2, PGB2, PGI2, and PGE2 were not inhibited by pretreatment with alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agents, muscarinic antagonist, antihistamics, and serotonic antagonist. These findings suggest that PGF2 alpha, PGA2, and PGB2 in a low concentration may facilitate lymph flow of bovine mesenteric lymphatics in the living body, since the spontaneous contractions of lymphatic smooth muscle may drive lymph centripetally in the presence of direction valves. On the other hand, PGI2 and PGE2 may cause an inhibition of lymph transport.", 
    "15": "The effect and possible side effects of the new beta-blocker Befunolol 0.25% and 0.5% were investigated for the first time in Europe in an open case study lasting 3 months. Good reduction of intraocular pressure was achieved with both concentrations. The statistical evaluation gave no indications of any significant influences on pulse, blood pressure, corneal sensitivity, tear production, pupil diameter, ECG, visual acuity or perimetry. No local side effects were observed and subjective tolerance was good. There was no diminution of the effect on IOP during the 3 months of the study.", 
    "16": "Beta-blocking agents may induce vascular syndromes related to environmental temperature, accentuation of arterial diseases, gangrene of the extremities. Incidence and severity are variable with beta-blocking agent's properties: cardioselectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, cardiac depression, and with the patient's disease. The risk of complication is greater with hypertension disease because of the reduction of arterial compliance and quantitative and qualitative alterations of adrenergic receptors.", 
    "17": "Direct comparison of drug interaction with intraocular relative to extraocular beta-adrenergic receptors was used to test the hypothesis that the receptors in ocular tissues are of the beta 2-subtype. Potencies for the displacement of 3H-dihydroalprenolol radioligand binding to membranes obtained from rabbit-iris ciliary bodies by beta-adrenoceptor agonists was in the order: isoproterenol greater than or equal to epinephrine greater than salbutamol greater than terbutaline greater than tazolol greater than norepinephrine. Similar radioligand displacement by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was in the order of potency: alprenolol greater than or equal to bupranolol = oxprenolol = timolol = propranolol greater than ICI 118,551 = IPS 339 much greater than betaxolol greater than metoprolol. Finally, for the above beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, a highly significant correlation was obtained for displacement of radioligand to ocular tissues (pKi values) relative to antagonism (pA2 values) of isoproterenol-induced guinea-pig tracheal relaxation but not guinea-pig atrial chronotropic effects. Consequently, the above three observations reinforce the notion that rabbit-iris ciliary bodies contain beta-adrenergic receptors predominantly of the beta 2-subtype.", 
    "18": "Canine cardiac Purkinje fiber automaticity is modified by adrenergic agonists. Alpha adrenergic agonists slow and beta agonists increase the rate of automatic discharge. These effects vary with maturation and development. We used standard microelectrode techniques to study the effects of the alpha agonist, phenylephrine, on automaticity in isolated neonatal (less than 10 days) and adult canine cardiac Purkinje fibers. Fibers were superfused with 5 X 10(-8) M phenylephrine dissolved in Tyrode's solution. 75% (24/32) of adult and 52% (12/23) of neonatal fibers showed a decrease in rate. The magnitude of the decrease was similar at both ages and the effect was blocked during superfusion with 1 X 10(-9) M phentolamine. The remaining adult and neonatal fibers demonstrated a significant increase in rate in response to 5 X 10(-8) M phenylephrine. This effect was blocked by 5 X 10(-7) M propranolol in the adult group but not in the neonates. However, the increase in rate of fibers from 0- to 2-day neonates was blocked by phentolamine. As an indicator of adrenergic innervation of neonatal hearts, we assayed the myocardial norepinephrine concentration. There was a 6- to 8-fold increase in concentration during the first 10 days of neonatal life, suggesting that innervation was rapidly increasing during this time. In summary, neonatal Purkinje fibers can show an alpha adrenergic-induced acceleration of automatic rate. This alpha adrenergic acceleration is not seen in adults. The change in response from neonate to adult may be effected by growth and development of autonomic nerves and associated changes in receptor function.", 
    "19": "Betaxolol, a beta selective adrenoceptor antagonist recently approved for the treatment of hypertension, was determined by monitoring in chemical ionization mode with ammonia the [MH]+ ions of the trimethylsilyl derivatives of the drug and of its internal standard [2H5)betaxolol). Its pharmacokinetic profile obtained following administration of a 20 mg oral dose was characterized by a half-life of 22 h and a bioavailability of 85%. The main acid metabolite formed by elimination of the isopropylamino group may also be determined as the methyl TMS derivative but methylation with BF3-methanol should be used with caution since it may induce the opening of the cyclopropyl group. The routine electron capture determination procedure was compared to this mass spectrometric method and an excellent correlation was found (r = 0.9974). Both procedures have the same sensitivity (1 ng ml-1). Finally it was observed that under electron impact mode betaxolol trimethylsilyl side chain rearranged to lose TMS-O-CH=CH2; this elimination was confirmed by deuterium labelling studies.", 
    "20": "We studied pulmonary epithelial permeability and bronchial reactivity in 10 smoking and 8 nonsmoking adults. Permeability was measured as the disappearance half-life (T 1/2) of aerosolized 99mTc-DTPA from the lungs, and a permeability index (PI) calculated that reflected the appearance of the tracer in the blood. Smokers had increased permeability with a T 1/2 of 44.6 +/- 12.2 min and PI values at 10, 25, and 60 min of 27.3 +/- 13.2, 32.5 +/- 10.2, and 34.3 +/- 9.9, compared with those in nonsmokers with a T 1/2 of 110.0 +/- 62.7 min and PI values of 9.4 +/- 5.7, 14.9 +/- 8.3, and 23.1 +/- 9.0. Bronchial reactivity to histamine was measured with and without prior exposure to aerosolized propranolol (to achieve beta-blockade of airway smooth muscle). Reactivity increased significantly (p less than 0.001) in both groups after beta-blockade, but no difference was found between smokers and nonsmokers. Despite the increased permeability in smokers, there was no evidence of increased reactivity.", 
    "21": "Data from six placebo-controlled prevention trials studying the effect of beta-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction are reviewed for comparison. The beta-blockers chosen for this review were practolol, oxprenolol, timolol, sotalol and propranolol. All studies had a duration of at least 12 months and treatment was started not earlier than 4 days and not later than 4 months after the onset of infarction. The patient selection did not reveal marked differences concerning the pre-infarct history whereas risk factors at entry varied considerably between the trials. In spite of these differences, all of the six studies showed a reduction in overall mortality and in the rate of non-fatal reinfarctions of the treated group as compared with placebo. Based on these results, the practical implications are discussed in an attempt to draw some general guidelines concerning the management of therapy. Finally, it appears that beta-blocking activity is the common factor for improving the long-term survival of post-infarction patients.", 
    "22": "The new vasodilator Roche 12-4713, an oxodiazolo-pyrimidine with long-acting direct arteriolar dilating properties, was tested in 13 patients (ages 33-66 years, mean 53 +/- 7 SD) previously uncontrolled on a beta blocker-diuretic combination. The addition of Ro 12-4713 (30-180 mg per day) for 134 +/- 62 days resulted in a fall of blood pressure from 191 +/- 24/110 +/- 8 to 150 +/- 23/88 +/- 8 (p less than 0.001) without changes in heart rate (73 +/- 8 vs 74 +/- 11 bpm). Edema occurred in five patients, this was controlled in four by increasing the dose of the diuretic. Hypertrichosis appears to limit the drug's use in females. This new vasodilator proved highly effective in the treatment of severe hypertension. The long duration of action makes once a day administration possible.", 
    "23": "Beta-adrenoceptor mechanisms in guinea-pig taenia caecum were studied by means of a receptor-binding technique. Hill plots of test drugs obtained from inhibition curves were linear with slopes which were equal to 1.00. pKi-values of isoprenaline and desisopropylprocaterol were in agreement with those pD2-values. pKi-value of carteolol was in agreement with its pA2-value. The beta-adrenoceptor is suggested to have two different sites; one can interact with the agonist and partial agonist and the other can interact with the antagonist and partial agonist.", 
    "24": "Most potential adrenergic compounds did not stimulate lipolysis in swine adipose tissue slices. Most of the sympatholytic agents antagonized lipolysis. Most beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic agonists were not active but many were active with rat adipose tissue. Catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine and isoproterenol), the resorcinol containing beta 2-agonists (terbutaline, metaproterenol and fenoterol) and the beta 1-agonist, dobutamine were active. The beta 1-antagonists were generally more potent and efficacious than the beta 2-antagonists. The swine adipose tissue adrenoceptor was not readily classified as either beta 1- or beta 2-specific.", 
    "25": "Fenoterol (beta 2-agonist) and several analogs stimulated swine adipose tissue lipolysis in addition to epinephrine, norepinephrine and isoproterenol. Lipolytic activity was inhibited by propranolol (beta 1 + beta 2) greater than metoprolol (beta 1) greater than ICI 118,551 (beta 2) greater than practolol (beta 1) much greater than butoxamine (beta 2) regardless of the agonist used in the test system. The swine adipose adrenoceptor is not readily classified into a beta 1 or beta 2 subtype. It may be unique or the classification systems devised in laboratory animals may not be applicable across species.", 
    "26": "Thermogenesis induced by carbohydrates of differing chemical complexity has been investigated. In piglets aged 6-10 weeks and fed standard feed, doubling the energy intake with glucose did not alter the resting oxygen consumption 12-21 hr after a meal. Addition of sucrose or glucose polymer to standard feed increased the resting rate of oxygen consumption slightly. Nevertheless the rate was still considerably less than after a meal of complex carbohydrate. Although propranolol had no effect on metabolic rate immediately after a meal high in glucose, it reduced the rate significantly after 7-15 hr.", 
    "27": "Experiments performed on isolated perfused hearts of the eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) showed that the heart spontaneously released catecholamines (i.e. Adrenaline, Noradrenaline, Dopamine) suggesting that they take part in the cardiac regulation. Stimulation of cardiac vagus branches significantly increased catecholamines levels, measured in a perfusion medium and simultaneously the heart rate and the systolic pressure. The effect of Desmethylimipramine showed that the catecholamines were released from nervous endings and not from endothelial cells.", 
    "28": "Melanophores of Papiliochromis ramirezi aggregate their melanosomes in the presence of catecholamines. Their order of potency are: at 10(-4) M, norepinephrine greater than isoproterenol = epinephrine; at 10(-6) and 10(-8) M, norepinephrine = isoproterenol greater than epinephrine. These effects are antagonized not only by phentolamine but also by propranolol. The catecholamines are unable to induce pigment dispersion. Melanosome dispersion is obtained with cholinergic drugs and the order of potency is nicotine greater than acetylcholine = pilocarpine. Their effects are inhibited by atropine and also by d-tubocurarine and potentiated by physostigmine. The evidences suggest the presence of undifferentiated adrenoceptors, related to the melanosome aggregation and undifferentiated cholinoceptors related to the melanosome dispersion.", 
    "29": "In man, circulating adrenaline has little or no direct effect on the control of blood pressure. A small proportion of adrenaline secreted by the adrenal medulla is accumulated in sympathetic nerve endings and may be re-released by sympathetic nerve stimulation. Recent pharmacological studies have suggested that adrenaline acts on a presynaptic beta-receptor on sympathetic nerve endings to facilitate noradrenaline release, and it has been proposed that adrenaline re-released from these nerve endings is therefore a functionally important \"co-transmitter\". Intermittently elevated secretion of adrenaline from the adrenal medulla could therefore lead indirectly to a sustained increase in neuronal release of noradrenaline and hence to hypertension.", 
    "30": "In a double blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial of 24 weeks 31 patients with Raynaud's syndrome were treated with the alpha-blocker phenoxybenzamine (10-20 mg daily) and with the combination of the alpha-blocker phenoxybenzamine (10-20 mg daily) and the beta-blocker sotalol (40-80 mg daily). A favourable effect on recovery of finger temperature after finger cooling was demonstrated after alpha-blockade as compared to the before treatment situation. This favourable effect was not different when the group received the combined alpha- and beta-blockade. The blood pressure was not influenced by either of the 2 medications. Fluid retention appeared with alpha-blockade and was absent with combined alpha- and beta-blockade. Decrease of heart rate occurred with alpha- plus beta-blockade and was absent with alpha-blockade alone. Clinical symptoms of Raynaud's syndrome equally were alleviated by the two medications. Common, and equally frequent side effects of the two medications were nasal congestion, disturbed ejaculation and potency, dry mouth, exercise-induced and orthostatic dizziness. We conclude that alpha-blockade is beneficial in Raynaud's syndrome and that additional beta-blockade counteracts the alpha-blocker side-effect fluid retention, reduces the heart rate and thus may prevent alpha-blocker induced tachycardia, and that it does not cause hypotension.", 
    "31": "To evaluate the effects of two beta-adrenergic blocking agents on cardiopulmonary function, we investigated two topical ophthalmologic preparations, betaxolol 1% and timolol 0.5%, in nine patients (eight men and one woman, ranging in age from 25 to 69 years) with reactive airway disease. The randomized, double-masked, crossover study used placebo eyedrops as the control, and each drug was tested on separate days. Spirometric measurements, respiratory rate, pulse rate, and blood pressure were observed at frequent intervals for four hours after the test solutions were instilled. At the end of the test, an inhaled beta-adrenergic stimulant (isoproterenol) was administered, and the measurements were repeated. Timolol produced a significant decrease in airflow, measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and the ratio of FEV1 to vital capacity at each observation time beyond 15 minutes. Betaxolol and placebo eyedrops produced no significant change from control values. These results suggested that timolol can adversely affect patients with reactive airway disease. Betaxolol eyedrops, conversely, caused no decrease in airflow in the same patients with proven airway disease.", 
    "32": "In 580 patients with a definite myocardial infarction (MI) and no previous MI, the enzymatically estimated infarct size was related to the clinical course including various complications. In all patients, heat-stable lactate dehydrogenase activity (EC 1.1.1.27, LD) was analyzed every 12 hours for 48-108 hours and in a subgroup (n = 170) creatine kinase activity (EC 2.7.3.2, CK) and creatinine kinase subunit B (CK B) were analyzed every 6 hours for 48 hours. The highest recorded enzyme activity was used as a rough estimate of infarct size. A positive correlation was found between serum enzyme activity and most of the clinical variables studied, such as incidence of congestive heart failure, treatment with furosemide, incidence of hypotension, cardiogenic shock, pericarditis, post myocardial infarction syndrome, AV block III, and the duration of hospitalization. We conclude that the enzymatically estimated infarct size determined by heat-stable LD, CK and CK B closely reflects the severity of the infarction.", 
    "33": "The effects of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade on plasma concentrations of insulin and glucose were studied in the anaesthetized rat. Infusion of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker prazocin (80 micrograms/min), the alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocker yohimbine (15 micrograms/min) or the non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phentolamine (15 micrograms/min) during 50 min increased plasma insulin levels by about 1.5-2.5 ng/ml. The effects of phentolamine and prazosin on circulating insulin persisted throughout the infusion whereas the effect of yohimbine seemed to be more transient. Plasma glucose levels increased slightly during infusion of prazosin, but tended to decrease in response to phentolamine and yohimbine. The beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol (15 micrograms/min) lowered basal plasma insulin and glucose levels. It also depressed plasma insulin during infusion of all three alpha-adrenoceptor blockers without any appreciable influence on plasma glucose. It is suggested that both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor as well as beta-adrenoceptors are involved in the regulation of basal insulin secretion in the rat.", 
    "34": "We investigated the protective effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents on ischemia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in 42 anesthetized mongrel dogs. The animals, divided into 6 groups of 7 dogs each, were premedicated with either saline for the controls, or D, L-propranolol (0.5 mg/kg), D-propranolol (0.5 mg/kg), D, L-acebutolol (2.5 mg/kg), D, L-pindolol (0.1 mg/kg), or L-isoproterenol (0.2 microgram/kg/min, for 10 min). Myocardial mitochondria were prepared from both the normal and the ischemic areas after 30 min of coronary ligation. The concentration of long-chain acyl-CoA was measured enzymatically. Respiratory control index, ADP/O, and the rate of oxygen consumption in State III of mitochondria were also measured. In the control group, acyl-CoA in ischemic mitochondria increased significantly compared with that in normal mitochondria, and mitochondrial dysfunction was observed. Administration of L-isoproterenol further increased acyl-CoA level and accelerated the dysfunction, whereas premedication with beta-blocking agents reduced the elevation of acyl-CoA level and prevented the dysfunction. Premedication with D-propranolol had no effect on mitochondria. Since the accumulation of acyl-CoA interferes with normal mitochondrial function, these results suggest that the protective effects of beta-blocking agents are based, at least in part, on the prevention of the accumulation of acyl-CoA esters.", 
    "35": "The influence of a range of nine anti-inflammatory drugs on the octan-1-ol aqueous phosphate buffer pH 7.4 apparent partition coefficients of propranolol and oxprenolol has been examined. All produced a change in the apparent partition coefficient which can be explained in terms of partitioning of hydrophobic ion-pairs formed between the ionic anti-inflammatory compound and the protonated cationic drug.", 
    "36": "The interactions between ICI 118, 587 (Corwin) a beta 1-selective partial adrenergic agonist, and atenolol (Tenormin), propranolol (Inderal) and verapamil were examined first in anaesthetised dogs pretreated with syrosingopine and vagotomised. ICI 118, 587 was administered iv in cumulative doses of 0.1 to 1000 micrograms X kg-1. In four animals, heart rate increased from 102 +/- 4 to 188 +/- 12 beats X min-1 with a KA of 2.5 +/- 0.9 micrograms X kg-1. ICI 118, 587 was then administered to five groups each of four animals pretreated with atenolol (250 micrograms X kg-1 and 500 micrograms X kg-1iv), propranolol (250 micrograms X kg-1 and 500 micrograms X kg-1) or verapamil (200 micrograms X kg-1 plus 5 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 iv). Both atenolol and propranolol shifted the dose response curve to the right but verapamil did not. Atenolol did not lower the maximal heart rate response to ICI 118,587. Both propranolol and verapamil slowed heart rate significantly (P less than 0.05) after, but not before, ICI 118,587. Further studies were then carried out in vitro. Cat papillary muscles were superfused with physiological saline at pH 7.4 and with either atenolol or ICI 118,587 at 5 X 10(-5) mol X litre-1. Tension was recorded at Lmax over a [Ca2+] range of 0.5 to 8 X 10(-3)mol X litre-1. The pA2 for verapamil against Ca2+ in the presence of atenolol and ICI 118,587 was 5.25 +/- 0.10 and 6.57 +/- 0.22 respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "A possible route of metabolism of beta-adrenoceptor stimulating drugs used in obstetrics consists of conjugation by the enzyme phenol sulphotransferase. The substrate specificities of the platelet and the placental enzymes towards these drugs were tested. The specific activities of the beta-adrenoceptor agonists were found to be relatively similar to those obtained with the catecholamine dopamine but their Km values were considerably higher.", 
    "38": "The use of cimetidine, the histamine H2 receptor antagonist, is associated with a relatively low incidence of adverse reactions. However, its liberal use has led to the identification of several clinically significant cimetidine-drug interactions that can lead to drug accumulation, toxicity, and life-threatening sequelae. A review of the literature and the clinical significance and physiologic basis of these interactions are presented. Recommended management of cimetidine-drug interactions is discussed.", 
    "39": "Seventy patients having aortocoronary vein bypass grafting surgery for angina pectoris underwent preoperative invasive exercise testing to symptom limits and again 6 to 14 months postoperatively. Cardiac output was measured using the direct Fick principle. Postoperatively at maximal exercise, there was a 3.11 liters/min (p less than 0.0001) increase in cardiac output in men (n = 61) and a 2.04 liters/min (p less than 0.01) increase in women (n = 9). Patients with complete revascularization showed a significantly greater improvement in cardiac output postoperatively than did those with incomplete revascularization (26 versus 6%, p less than 0.0001). The major reason for the increased maximal cardiac output was a marked increase in heart rate while stroke volume was maintained at the same preoperative level. These findings were true irrespective of preoperative use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.", 
    "40": "A double-blind crossover trial was performed to assess the effect of metoprolol in 10 patients (mean age 55 years) with severe dilated cardiomyopathy. All patients clinically had idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy; however, at coronary angiography, four had occult coronary disease. All were in New York Heart Association functional class III with a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35% as assessed by rest radionuclide ventriculography. Studies were performed before treatment, after 4 weeks of metoprolol therapy and after 4 weeks of placebo administration. Erect bicycle sprint exercise was used to determine maximal work load. Hemodynamic variables and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction were recorded at rest and during graded supine bicycle exercise. Cardiac medications were unchanged throughout the trial. The mean (+/- standard error of the mean) dose of metoprolol was 130 +/- 13 mg/day. Metoprolol did not change symptoms, chest X-ray findings or exercise tolerance (baseline 700 +/- 73, placebo 690 +/- 85, metoprolol 710 +/- 81 kilopond-meters [kpm]/min). Metoprolol produced a significant decrease in heart rate at rest and during exercise (p less than 0.001). Mean blood pressure and left ventricular filling pressure did not differ significantly in the baseline, placebo and metoprolol studies. There was a slight, but significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in cardiac index with metoprolol compared with placebo and baseline studies. The small, but significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction from baseline to the metoprolol and placebo studies (p less than 0.001) was considered a result of spontaneous improvement rather than of therapy. No significant differences were found between the patients with and without coronary disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "While the reflex influence of selective coronary arterial occlusion on the resistance vasculature has been well delineated, the reflex influence of coronary occlusion on the total capacitance vasculature has not been examined. Thus, selective coronary occlusions were performed in 65 anesthetized dogs. Blood was drained from the vena cavae and returned to the right atrium at a constant rate so that changes in total intravascular volume could be recorded as reciprocal changes in extracorporeal reservoir volume. In 10 animals, 2.5 min of left anterior descending occlusion was associated with only an insignificant total volume increase of 6 +/- 4 ml (SEM), whereas 2.5 min of left circumflex occlusion was associated with a 27 +/- 4 ml (P less than 0.001) increase in volume, which was significantly attenuated (P less than 0.001) to only a 7 +/- 3 ml increase after cervical vagectomy. Epicardial lidocaine in four animals reduced the volume increment associated with circumflex occlusion from 30 +/- 3 to 11 +/- 4 ml (P less than 0.025). The volume increase was attenuated from 45 +/- 6 to 24 +/- 5 ml with propranolol administration (P less than 0.001) (seven animals) and from 26 +/- 5 to 17 +/- 6 ml with atropine (P less than 0.025) (eight animals), but was not attenuated with phenoxybenzamine (28 +/- 7 ml before and 25 +/- 2 ml after phenoxybenzamine) (five animals). Double blockade with propranolol and atropine reduced the volume increase to 3 +/- 2 ml (NS) in four of these animals. In order to compare the influences of selective beta-1 adrenergic blockade and combined beta-1 and beta-2 blockade, volume responses were assessed before and after administration of metoprolol or propranolol in doses that produced the same amount of beta-1 blockade (15 animals). The volume increase associated with circumflex occlusion was not attenuated after beta-1 blockade (20 +/- 4 ml before and 18 +/- 5 ml after metoprolol) (eight animals) but was attenuated from 30 +/- 5 to 14 +/- 5 ml after propranolol (P less than 0.05) (seven animals). To examine further the efferent limb of the observed reflex, circumflex occlusions were performed before and after either vagectomy at the level of the diaphragm or section of the sympathetic splanchnic nerves in 12 animals. The volume increment was significantly attenuated after either procedure. In four animals undergoing prior arterial baroreceptor denervation, volume still increased 30 +/- 6 ml (P less than 0.001) with circumflex occlusion. Thus, inferior myocardial ischemia is associated with an autonomic reflex that acts to increase total intravascular volume. The afferent limb is mediated through the vagi, and the efferent limb, throug", 
    "42": "Three patients with accessory nodoventricular pathways and re-entry tachycardia are reported. In all three patients the accessory nodoventricular pathway formed the anterograde limb of the re-entry circuit while the His-Purkinje-atrioventricular node axis formed the retrograde limb of the tachycardia in two of the patients and a concealed accessory pathway formed the retrograde limb in the remaining patient. All three patients also manifested dual anterograde atrioventricular nodal pathways with conduction through the accessory nodoventricular pathways being associated with the atrioventricular nodal fast pathway. Type I antiarrhythmic drugs, especially disopyramide and quinidine, were effective for the treatment of the re-entry tachycardia because of their depressive action on the nodoventricular pathway. Beta blockers were also effective because of their action on the atrioventricular nodal portion of the re-entry circuit in one patient and most probably due to atypical (atrioventricular nodal like) properties of a retrogradely conducting accessory pathway in a second patient.", 
    "43": "Binding studies with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist ligand [3H]-dihydroalprenolol ([3H]-DHA, spec. act, 90-102 Ci/mmol) were performed with ventricular membranes L-D-synchronized (L:0.7-19 hr, D:-07 hr) male rats, sacrificed either at 08 hr or at 20 hr. Saturation experiments with crude or washed and preincubated membranes revealed two affinity states of specific [3H]-DHA binding which were abolished after addition of the guanine nucleotide Gpp(NH)p. In crude membranes the apparent Bmax-value at 20 hr was about 40% higher than at 08 hr, in washed and preincubated membranes the nocturnal increase in the apparent Bmax-value was not observed. Pretreatment of rats with isoprenaline (50 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased and catecholamine depletion (reserpine plus inhibition of tyrosine-hydroxylase) increased Bmax-values in crude membranes. The circadian-stage-dependent and the drug-induced effects on the apparent number of beta-adrenoceptors are assumed to be due to circadian or drug-induced variations in the turnover of cardiac noradrenaline.", 
    "44": "The pharmacological control in vitro of meiotic resumption in Xenopus laevis oocytes was undertaken with a variety of drugs or agents which either mimic a steroidal hormone, progesterone, the physiological inducer of meiosis in vivo and in vitro, potentiate progesterone-induced meiosis (e.g. insulin) or inhibit the action of steroidal and non-steroidal inducers. Most steroidal and non-steroidal inducers trigger a cascade of cellular events which seem to be initiated at the oocyte membrane. One membrane target seems to be the enzyme adenylate cyclase which is inhibited (with concomitant dephosphorylation of yet unknown cellular substrates) by progesterone as well by several other inducers, or activated by inhibitors of meiosis such as cholera toxin or forskolin. However, additional, complementary or subsequent interaction(s) of inducers with other membrane and/or cellular constituents, such as calcium, phospholipids and protein kinase C have been also suggested by experiments with cycloheximide (a protein synthesis inhibitor) or with a serine protease inhibitor, which both inhibit progesterone-induced meiosis. Furthermore, dideoxyadenosine was shown to decrease particulate adenylate cyclase, although it did not induce meiosis in vitro. It is hoped that the great variety of pharmacological agents which can be used at the present time to study in vitro the meiotic resumption of Xenopus laevis oocytes may help to clarify the complex sequence of meiotic events which start at the cell membrane level and progress to the second meiotic metaphase.", 
    "45": "The extent to which beta-adrenergic receptor mediated renin release contributes to the maintenance of blood pressure during hypotension induced by sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 40 micrograms/kg/min for 30 min) was assessed in conscious Wistar rats fitted with chronic aortic and vena caval catheters. Propranolol, (1.5 mg/kg, i.v.), reduced the basal level of plasma renin activity (PRA) in control rats from 4.4 +/- 0.4 to 2.4 +/- 0.4 ng angiotensin I/ml/min (p less than .05) and decreased PRA obtained during SNP infusion from 35.3 +/- 6.6 to 16.7 +/- 2.2 ng angiotensin I/ml/min (p less than .01). Despite the reduced PRA, the hypotensive response to SNP was not enhanced after propranolol. Treatment of these animals with captopril in order to block the actions of the remaining non-beta-receptor released renin, resulted in augmentation of the SNP hypotension. Captopril also potentiated SNP hypotension in rats that had not received propranolol. The addition of propranolol to the captopril treated rats produced no further change in SNP hypotension. The results of this study indicate that beta-receptor-mediated and beta-receptor-independent mechanisms contribute to the renin released during SNP hypotension. However, if the beta-receptor-mediated component alone is blocked, the remaining renin secretion is adequate to maintain blood pressure during SNP infusion.", 
    "46": "We have characterized and quantified specific binding of [3H]-flunitrazepam (FNZ; (benzodiazepine), [3H]-naloxone (NAL; (opiate) and [3H] CGP-12177(CGP; (beta-adrenergic) to thick slices (230-400 micron) of mouse and rat brain. The binding sites are stereospecific, saturable and of high affinity. In all cases, the binding of the ligands is readily reversible and demonstrates the appropriate drug specificity. In mouse brain [3H]-NAL binding is elevated by chronic treatment with naloxone (via capsules). We have been unsuccessful in quantifying beta adrenoreceptors with the archetypal ligand [3H]-dihydroalprenolol (DHA). However, the use of [3H]-CGP 12177 enabled us to detect high-affinity beta adrenoreceptors in brain slices. [3H]-CGP also permits the demonstration of rapid and reversible agonist-induced down-regulation (internalization) of beta binding sites. We have been successful in quantifying beta adrenergic sites in single pineal glands of rat and hamster.", 
    "47": "The loss of beta-adrenergic responsiveness during reticulocyte maturation was studied under tissue culture conditions in a defined cell population from rats. Initial beta-receptor density and receptor-mediated cAMP formation in culture medium (RPMI 1640) exceeded the values obtained in isotonic KC1-buffer by 56 and 120% respectively. During cell cultivation receptor density and hormonal responsiveness decreased rapidly by 40-50% of their initial values within the first 20 h. In the following 3 days the rate of loss varied between 10 and 15%/d. The same time course was observed for the maturation-dependent decrease in forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation. ATP depletion of cultivated cells caused a complete and irreversible loss of cAMP response within 90 min. Our results indicate that cell metabolism regulates the strength of the hormonal response. A defect in adenylate cyclase or in cyclase N-protein interaction seems to be rate-limiting for the functional inactivation of the beta-adrenergic system during reticulocyte maturation.", 
    "48": "Alpha 1 and beta adrenergic receptor metabolism was investigated by studying receptor reappearance after an irreversible blockade. Phenoxybenzamine was used to irreversibly block alpha 1 adrenergic receptors both in vitro in the BC3H1 cell line and in vivo in rat submaxillary glands. In these two systems, the alpha 1 adrenergic receptor reappearance followed a monoexponential kinetic allowing to determine the half-life of the receptor (23h in vitro, 33h in vivo) as well as the rate of receptor synthesis and degradation. the receptor reappearance was due to receptor synthesis since it was blocked by cycloheximide. The irreversible blockade of beta adrenergic receptors was done with an alkylating beta adrenergic antagonist that we recently developed: Br-pindolol (1). This ligand has high efficiency and blocked at 10(-7)M 80-90% of the beta adrenergic receptors present in C6 glioma cells in culture. After this irreversible blockade, receptors reappeared only during cell division. At confluency, when cells did not significantly divide, receptor synthesis could hardly be detectable. Therefore, at confluency, the metabolic stability of the beta adrenergic receptor is considerable, compared to that of the alpha 1 adrenergic receptor. This stability was confirmed by the observation that after an almost complete \"down-regulation\" of the beta adrenergic receptor, receptor repopulation of the C6 glioma cells was total and occurred in the presence of cycloheximide.", 
    "49": "Mononuclear leucocytes (MNL) were isolated from blood of 11 healthy blood donors. Lymphocyte subsets were sorted in a Cytofluorograf after direct (B cells) or indirect immunofluorescence labeling with monoclonal antibodies directed against the phenotypes of T-, T helper (Th)- and T suppressor (Ts) cells. The sorted cells were incubated with (+/-)125iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) for the determination of beta-adrenergic receptors. Beta-adrenergic receptors on B cells were increased two-fold (3700 sites/cell, p less than 0.004) and had a lower affinity (dissociation constant KD 40pM, p less than 0.03) when compared with T cells (1400 sites/cell, KD 17pM). Receptors on Th- and Ts cells showed a similar binding capacity, but Ts cells had a slightly higher [125I]CYP binding affinity (KD 13 pM) than Th cells (KD 27 pM, p less than 0.02). The different densities and affinities of beta-adrenergic receptors in human lymphocyte subsets, as assessed by antagonist binding should be considered in the interpretation of receptor alterations of unfractionated MNL, which may occur simultaneously to changes of the blood leucocyte distribution.", 
    "50": "Rat adipocytes possess typical beta 1 adrenoceptors that can be identified by 125I-cyanopindolol binding but the receptor mediating isoprenaline adenylate cyclase activation possesses properties quite unlike beta 1 or beta 2 receptors. Separation of these sites has been attempted using the photoaffinity antagonist para-amino-benzyl-carazolol. Preincubation of rat reticulocyte and adipocyte membranes with this agent followed by washing induced a concentration-dependent loss of specific 125I-cyanopindolol sites in both tissues, though the maximal loss was apparently greater in the reticulocyte. However, the loss of sites in both tissues induced a different effect on isoprenaline-stimulated adenylate cyclase. In the reticulocyte, the loss of specific sites was accompanied by an equivalent fall in the maximal stimulation of adenylate cyclase. In the adipocyte there were no significant effects of receptor site loss on the isoprenaline dose-response curve. It is suggested that this data supports the concept that an atypical beta-adrenoceptor, with relatively low affinity for many antagonists, mediates catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase (and lipolysis) in the adipocyte.", 
    "51": "CGP-12177, like isoproterenol, has a lower affinity for desensitized receptors. Experiments were performed to study whether this property of CGP-12177 is due to its partial agonist activity or its impermeability for membranes. Reduced binding of [3H]DHA to desensitized receptors at 0 degrees C as well as a reversal of the reduced binding in the presence of digitonin indicate a permeability barrier. A partial agonist effect of CGP-12177 was only found in intact C6 cells and neither in C6 membranes nor in S49 cells. This peculiar effect in intact C6 cells is stereospecific and not due to an inhibition of phosphodiesterases.", 
    "52": "The effect of a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, pindolol, on uteroplacental blood flow was determined in 10 women with pregnancy hypertension using an isotope technique giving a very low radiation dose. 0.5 mCi 113mIn was injected intravenously before and 30 min after 10 mg pindolol was given orally. After the administrations of 113mIn serial scintigrams were recorded for 240 s by a gamma camera on line with a computer, and the placenta was outlined for time-activity analysis of the isotope accumulation curves. From these curves a relative measure of the uteroplacental blood flow could be determined. Pindolol induced a significant fall in mean arterial pressure but there was no reduction of uteroplacental blood flow index.", 
    "53": "Isoprenaline was microinjected into the cerebroventricular spaces of anesthetized or unanesthetized rats and the blood pressor effects recorded prior to or after intraventricular administration of pharmacologic antagonists. Injection of 1-20 micrograms of isoprenaline produced only depressor responses in both groups of animals. Pretreatment with 400-200 micrograms of propranolol partially antagonized the depressor effect of isoprenaline, whereas pretreatment with 40 micrograms of phenoxybenzamine or 100 micrograms phentolamine potentiated the depressor response to isoprenaline. The involvement of central beta-adrenoceptors and a propranolol-insensitive mechanism in the depressor response to intracerebroventricular isoprenaline is proposed. Indirect evidence of a central alpha-adrenoceptor mediation of pressor mechanisms counteracting the depressor responses elicited by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation is presented.", 
    "54": "The effects of catecholamines in the central and peripheral nervous systems appear to be mediated through interactions with 2 major classes of receptor: alpha-adrenoceptors and beta-adrenoceptors. Subtypes of both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors exist. In the periphery, alpha 1-receptors are located postsynaptically, mediating the excitatory effects of catecholamines at alpha-receptors. alpha 2-Adrenoceptors, on the other hand, are autoreceptors involved in the regulation of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) release. In the central nervous system, both alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptors exist on postsynaptic cells; there are also 2 principal subtypes of beta-adrenoceptors. beta 1-Receptors have a high affinity for both noradrenaline and adrenaline (epinephrine) and are found in the heart, brain, and adipose tissue. beta 2-Receptors have a low affinity for noradrenaline and are involved in mediation of relaxation of vascular and other smooth muscles and in many of the metabolic effects of catecholamines. A variety of effector systems have been implicated in the actions of catecholamines. Most, though not all, of the effects of catecholamines at beta-receptors are mediated through activation of adenyl cyclase and increases in cyclic AMP accumulation. The effects of catecholamines at alpha-receptors generally involve other second messenger systems. Thus, in at least some systems, stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors mediates increases in phosphoinositide breakdown, while alpha 2-adrenoceptors appear to act through inhibition of adenyl cyclase activity. The pharmacological effects of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors were initially characterised by measuring responses observed in intact preparations. The advent of the use of radioligand binding techniques has allowed direct approaches to the characterisation of receptor properties. The use of radioligands makes it possible to determine the affinities of receptors for specific ligands, and it is possible to determine the density of receptors in a tissue. Finally, in vitro assays serve as a means through which receptors can be followed during solubilisation, isolation, and reconstitution. Several ligands are now available for the study of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. In general, relatively selective radioligands are available for the study of alpha-receptors. Thus, 3H-WB 4101 and 3H-prazosin are selective ligands for alpha 1-receptors; the ligand 125I-IBE 2254 also shows high selectivity for alpha 1-receptors. 3H-Yohimbine and 3H-rauwolscine are selective antagonists for the labelling of alpha 2-receptors and 3H-clonidine is a selective agonist used for studying alpha 2-receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "55": "In this study the authors' purpose was to observe the effects of surgical stress on the number of lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptors in hypertensive and normotensive subjects. It was noticed that after surgery a significant reduction occurred in the number of binding sites of lymphocytes of both hypertensive and normotensive subjects. The time course of recovery to the pre-operative values of binding sites varied between the two groups, being slower in normotensive than in hypertensive patients. This might suggest a different pattern of regulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor between hypertensive and normotensive subjects.", 
    "56": "A study was carried out to determine whether beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity occurs in normal subjects following the abrupt withdrawal of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. Sixteen normal subjects took propranolol, orally, 120 mg twice daily for one week. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured supine and standing as well as during exercise. Heart rate was measured during and following the Valsalva manoeuvre. Measurements were made on the last day of the treatment period and on two occasions during the six days following withdrawal. Three subjects were removed from the analysis because of failure to take medication and one more was excluded because of protocol variation. In the remaining twelve, propranolol treatment reduced all parameters measured. Following abrupt withdrawal of the drug, there was no measurable increase in any of the parameters above baseline or placebo values within six days of the withdrawal. These findings, from normal subjects, do not support the phenomenon of beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity following propranolol withdrawal.", 
    "57": "Significant positive correlation between the ligand binding values for beta-adrenergic receptors and those for muscarinic cholinergic receptors was found in five inbred strains of mice (r = 0.84) and in different vertebrate species (r = 0.99). Comparative analysis of analogous receptor studies done on various brain regions in other laboratories revealed high positive correlation between regional binding values for these two receptors. In conjunction with the work presented here, an overlap in the genetic determination of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors is suggested.", 
    "58": "In order to distinguish the effects of beta-receptor stimulation on the ECG from other factors during short-term adjustment to hypoxic aerohypoxia, the ECG of 19 volunteers were compared during moderately acute, stepwise exposure to high altitude (6,000 m) in a low pressure chamber, once with and once without beta-receptor blockade (propranolol), and after isoprenaline inhalation at ground level. The results show that beta-receptor stimulation accounts mainly for most ECG changes during altitude exposure, i.e., for the shortening of R-R interval, the lengthening of Q-T and in particular for the ST-T flattening, the latter therefore being only an indirect sign of hypoxia. After exclusion of the catecholamines, the minor but still significant ECG changes at altitude (shortening of R-R interval, increase of P wave, prolongation of P-Q, deviation of the R vector, T wave flattening in the left precordial leads) may be attributed to other, so far undefined factors, such as cardiac hypoxia, vagal withdrawal, or increase of pulmonary resistance.", 
    "59": "To investigate whether, in developing fetal rabbit myocardium, the affinity of beta-adrenoreceptors (beta-AR) for beta-AR agonists is regulated by guanosine triphosphate (GTP), we performed in vitro competition experiments utilizing 125I-hydroxybenzylpindolol (I-HYP), a beta-AR antagonist, as the radioligand, and l-isoproterenol (l-I) and l-propranolol (l-P), as beta-AR agonist and antagonist, respectively. At gestational ages from 21 to 31 days (term 31 days), in the presence of GTP, there was a 4-fold increase in the KI for the inhibition of specific I-HYP binding by l-I but not by l-P. Moreover, in the presence of GTP, there was a significant shift of the Hill coefficient to values closer to 1 only in the case of l-I. We conclude that: (1) beta-AR can form a 'high affinity' complex with l-I in the absence of GTP, detectable from days 21 to 31 of gestation; (2) the conversion of the former to a 'low affinity' state appears to be a GTP-dependent process.", 
    "60": "A randomized double-blind trial was carried out to determine the relationship of the changes in blood pressure and heart rate with changes in echocardiographic left ventricular indices in moderate to severe hypertensive patients with established left ventricular hypertrophy who were being treated chronically with enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide plus propranolol for 26 weeks. After a 2-week period on placebo, drug dosages in the two groups were adjusted to individual needs until blood pressure was normalized (diastolic less than 90 mmHg). Patients in Group I received 10 to 40 mg enalapril/day; those in Group II received 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide plus 80 to 240 mg propranolol/day. Echocardiographic measurements were made at the end of the placebo and 26-week active treatment periods. Significant correlations were observed between the changes in four pairs of variables in each group. In the 8 patients receiving enalapril, there were negative correlations between interventricular septal thickness and supine systolic blood pressure, erect and supine heart rates, and a positive correlation between relative wall thickness and erect diastolic blood pressure. In the 7 patients on hydrochlorothiazide plus propranolol, there were negative correlations between relative wall thickness and erect and supine heart rate, and positive correlations between left ventricular mass and erect diastolic blood pressure, and the percentage change in internal diameter of the left ventricle and supine systolic blood pressure. Possible explanations for and implications of these regional changes are discussed.", 
    "61": "An unexpected distribution of the beta-adrenergic receptor in the rat lung was revealed by an autoradiographic technique. [3H]-Dihydroalprenolol binding was stereoselective. L-propranolol was 300 times more potent than D-propranolol in competition experiments. Scatchard analysis revealed a Kd of 1.1 nM and Bmax of 14 fmol/mg wet weight. Relative potencies of beta-adrenergic ligands were: propranolol greater than alprenolol greater than timolol greater than pindolol greater than isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than soterenol greater than metoprolol greater than terbutaline greater than norepinephrine. The autoradiograms generated revealed a diffuse pattern with binding always associated with tissue structures. We conclude that beta-adrenergic receptors are extensively distributed in the lung, being present in large and small airways and blood vessels.", 
    "62": "beta 2-Adrenoceptor characteristics of human mononuclear leukocytes were assayed in hypertensive patients before and after treatment with 100 mg/day atenolol. While no changes have been observed in receptor affinity, a statistically significant increase (36%) has been demonstrated in receptor density following treatment. Blood pressure and heart rate were also measured in order to test the efficacy of the administered drug. All these parameters showed a fall in the post-treatment values. It is concluded that at therapeutic concentration, beta 2-adrenoceptors undergo up-regulation by atenolol in spite of its cardioselectivity. Such a regulation, which may represent a fundamental step in the mechanism leading to withdrawal syndrome, may, therefore, be suggested being quite widespread.", 
    "63": "Various studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of timolol, an S-enantiomer, relative to its R-enantiomer upon intraocular pressure and related ocular systems in the rabbit. The R-enantiomer was about one-third as potent as timolol in displacing 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding to iris-ciliary body tissue, reducing aqueous humor formation, and lowering intraocular pressure of alpha-chymotrypsin hypertensive eyes. In contrast, the R-enantiomer was 50 to 90 times less potent than timolol in antagonizing the effects of isoproterenol on pulmonary and atrial beta-adrenergic receptors. The data indicate that the R-enantiomer may lower intraocular pressure in man at concentrations less likely than timolol to block extraocular beta-adrenergic receptors. Finally, to account for the differential effect of the R-enantiomer upon ocular as opposed to extraocular beta-adrenergic receptors, it is tentatively suggested that this agent may also act upon a population of ocular beta-adrenergic receptors showing relatively poor stereoselectively.", 
    "64": "The effect of chronic ethanol consumption on the binding (125I)-iodohydroxybenzylpindolol to beta-adrenergic receptors in rat brain microvessels has been studied. The results show that chronic ethanol treatment increases the number of beta-receptors present in brain microvessels without changing the binding affinity of the binding site for the beta-adrenoceptor ligand. This effect is apparently not associated with changes in peripheral adrenergic tone, since no differences in platelet epinephrine or norepinephrine concentrations were found between ethanol-treated and control animals. An increase in beta-receptor density in brain microvessels might contribute to the alterations of cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption reported during chronic ethanol intoxication.", 
    "65": "In a 36-year-old woman with malignant hypertension and moderate renal insufficiency from nephrosclerosis normotension was not achieved by the combination of a beta-blocker, a vasodilator, and a loop-diuretic. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril was then added to the therapy. The blood pressure control was good. However, due to adverse reactions, captopril had to be withdrawn. Later on, the patient was successfully treated with enalapril, another ACE inhibitor, without the relapse of any adverse reactions.", 
    "66": "The efficacy and tolerability of the new ACE-inhibitor enalapril (MK 421) and the beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocker atenolol for the treatment of primary hypertension were compared in a double blind parallel study. 12 patients were randomized to each drug. The doses of enalapril were 20 and 40 mg o.d. and of atenolol 50 and 100 mg o.d. for 4 weeks each, whereafter hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 or 50 mg o.d. was added if necessary to achieve a supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) less than 90 mm Hg 24 hours after drug intake. Supine BP was reduced from 160 +/- 7/111 +/- 4 mm Hg to 153 +/- 13/101 +/- 9 mm Hg (p less than 0.05/p less than 0.005) with enalapril and from 163 +/- 17/109 +/- 6 mm Hg to 145 +/- 11/95 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.005/p less than 0.001) with atenolol. The addition of HCTZ caused a profound additive BP reduction to 132 +/- 7/88 +/- 6 mm Hg with enalapril and to 130 +/- 10/88 +/- 7 mm Hg with atenolol. There was no significant difference between the efficacy of enalapril and atenolol alone or combined with HTCZ. The reduction in mean arterial pressure with enalapril tended to correlate with pre-treatment stimulated plasma renin activity and 24 hours urinary kallikrein excretion. Both drugs tended to reduce serum and urinary aldosterone and kallikrein excretion to the same extent. There was one drop-out in each group, one due to impotence on the combination of enalapril and HCTZ and one due to peripheral coldness during atenolol treatment. Other side effects were mild. No toxic adverse effects were registered.", 
    "67": "In order to test the hypothesis of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in asthma bronchiale directly at the site of the asthmatic reaction, the tracheobronchial tree, we searched for mechanical and biochemical differences between isolated tracheae of actively sensitized and normal guinea pigs. The dose-response curves of terbutaline on isolated tracheae of actively sensitized guinea pigs were significantly shifted to the right in comparison with control trachea (ED50 11.8 X 10(-8) and 5.2 X 10(-8) M respectively). The sensitized organs dilated significantly slower than did controls (0.186 and 0.350 cm H2O/s, respectively) after addition of terbutaline, whereas the dilation velocity after addition of theophylline did not differ. The stimulation with fenoterol led to significantly lower amounts of cAMP in sensitized than in control tracheae (24.3 and 33.2 pmol/mg protein, respectively). The Km1 and Km2 of cAMP-phosphodiesterases of tracheal homogenates did not differ in both groups. Beta-adrenergic receptor binding studies with 3H-dihydro-alprenolol did not reveal a remarkable difference between sensitized and normal tracheae. The results indicate, that sensitization led to a partial blockade of the beta-adrenergic receptor adenylatecyclase system. However, the exact site of this effect remains obscure.", 
    "68": "Adrenergic receptors are present on lymphocytes but the extent to which their activation modulates lymphocyte function remains unclear. We studied beta-adrenergic receptors on mouse spleen lymphocytes using the antagonist 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) as a specific ligand. We report a significant increase in beta-receptor density in spleen lymphocytes from mice treated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to destroy peripheral sympathetic nerve endings (axotomy). Mouse spleen lymphocytes were separated into T and B subpopulations on nylon wool columns or by panning. B cells from both control and axotomized mice were found to bear twice as many beta-receptors as T lymphocytes. Finally, using flow cytometry to identify cells labeled with goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (lg), axotomized mouse spleen lymphocyte populations were shown to contain 25% fewer B cells than controls. This work demonstrates differences in beta-adrenergic receptor density on functionally distinct populations of lymphocytes. Furthermore, we show adaptive changes in receptor density on T and B lymphocytes following sympathetic denervation. Both of these observations serve to link the immune and sympathetic nervous system in a regulatory network.", 
    "69": "Intramammary pressure was recorded in anaesthetized lactating rats during electrical stimulation of the anterolateral pathways in the T12/L1 region of the spinal cord. In 18 rats, electrical stimulation at 10 Hz or more for 10-30 s caused a reproducible increase in intramammary pressure. The mammary gland responses were similar to those resulting from stimulation of the neurohypophysis with the same parameters, and were eliminated after complete destruction of the neural stalk; they were not associated with any consistent change in blood pressure. In 3 rats, a mammary gland response to spinal cord stimulation was obtained only after administration of the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, which facilitates suckling-induced reflex milk-ejections. These results suggest that spinal cord stimulation can cause the release of oxytocin; the functional significance of such a release is discussed in relation to the milk-ejection reflex.", 
    "70": "beta-Adrenergic receptors were mapped in the rat lung using a light microscopic technique that identifies binding sites for 3H-labeled dihydroalprenolol in intact slide-mounted tissue sections, which were also used for biochemical analysis of ligand binding. Grain density measurements were combined with morphometric data. These results indicate that, although over 97% of the specific binding is to cells of alveolar walls, beta-adrenergic receptors are present and can be quantified in tissues that represent a small fraction of total lung mass, such as bronchial epithelium and smooth muscle of bronchial walls and pulmonary vessels. Repeated administration of isoproterenol decreased the receptor number, as determined biochemically and from grain density measurements, in all anatomic regions studied, but did not alter the distribution of binding.", 
    "71": "In essential hypertension, calcium-influx-dependent vasoconstriction is enhanced, and free calcium concentration in platelets is elevated. To investigate calcium-influx-dependent vasoconstriction as related to platelet calcium concentration blood pressure, forearm blood flow (FAF) and free calcium concentration in platelets were measured in five patients with essential hypertension before and after a 6-week treatment with nitrendipine or acebutolol. Starting from comparable basal values, the increase in FAF (ml/min/100 ml tissue) to intraarterially infused nitrendipine (20 micrograms/100 ml tissue) was 40.7 +/- 6.1 before and 30.7 +/- 12.3 after chronic nitrendipine treatment (p less than 0.05) and 41.6 +/- 6.2 before and 34.6 +/- 14.9 after chronic acebutolol treatment. The \"nonspecific\" vasodilator response to intraarterial sodium nitroprusside or to postischaemic reperfusion were similar before and during treatment. Platelet-free calcium concentration fell on nitrendipine (p less than 0.05) and on acebutolol (p less than 0.01) treatment. Antihypertensive treatment with calcium entry as well as beta-adrenoceptor blockade resulted in a reduction of calcium-influx-dependent vasoconstriction and a fall in free calcium concentration in platelets. Thus, increased calcium platelets may reflect increased calcium in vascular smooth muscle cells and arteriolar tone.", 
    "72": "Interactions between calcium channel blockers like nifedipine and concurrently administered drugs like digoxin or cimetidine have been described in the literature. Therefore, possible interactions of the new calcium channel blocker nitrendipine (20 mg daily) with digoxin (0.5 mg daily), digitoxin (0.1 mg daily), cimetidine (1,000 mg daily), ranitidine (300 mg daily), atenolol (100 mg daily), metoprolol (200 mg daily), and acebutolol (400 mg daily) were studied following 1 week of combined treatment of nitrendipine with each of these drugs. Six healthy volunteers were investigated (mean age, 30.2 +/- 2.1 years; mean body weight, 69.7 +/- 4.7 kg; means +/- SEM). Under nitrendipine monotherapy, maximum plasma levels (Cmax) averaged 41.6 +/- 12.8 ng/ml, and they were reached after 2 h. Mean area under the curve was 131.5 +/- 40 ng ml-1 h, and \"oral\" plasma clearance (Clpl) amounted to 80.8 +/- 27.5 L/h. The H2 receptor antagonists cimetidine and ranitidine and the digitalis glycosides like digoxin or digitoxin did not alter nitrendipine kinetics significantly. Also simultaneous treatment with beta-blockers did not significantly influence kinetic values of the calcium channel blocker, but atenolol showed a tendency to increase Cmax of nitrendipine to 54.2 +/- 19.7 ng/ml, when its Clpl was distinctly lowered to 42.7 +/- 10.4 L/h (p greater than 0.05 compared with 80.8 +/- 27.5 L/h under nitrendipine monotherapy). Increased digoxin plasma levels and digoxin-induced side-effects were seen under nitrendipine co-administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "73": "The antihypertensive effect of nitrendipine (2 X 10 to 2 X 20 mg/day) was compared with that of propranolol (2 X 80 to 2 X 160 mg/day) in a randomized crossover study. Twenty-five patients were treated over two 4-week periods following a placebo period of 2 weeks. Three patients dropped out of the study because of side-effects (two on nitrendipine and one on propranolol). Arterial pressures decreased in a comparable manner from 171/107 mm Hg (measured in a sitting position) to 147/91 mm Hg after 4 weeks on nitrendipine and to 145/93 mm Hg after 4 weeks on propranolol. The frequency of side-effects possibly related to treatment was comparable for both drugs, but decreased with the duration of therapy with nitrendipine only. The antihypertensive effect of nitrendipine, but not of propranolol, correlated positively with age and plasma noradrenaline."
