    "3": "Study patients experienced 204 cardiac events during follow-up, of which 44% were associated with arousal triggers, 13% with exercise activity, and 43% with nonexercise/nonarousal triggers. Risk factors for arousal-triggered cardiac events included gender (female:male > 13 years: hazard ratio [HR] 9.10, P < .001) and the presence of pore-loop mutations (HR 2.19, P = .009). In contrast, non-pore-loop transmembrane mutations were the predominant risk factor for exercise-triggered events (HR 6.84, P < .001), whereas gender was not a significant risk factor for this endpoint. Nonexercise/nonarousal events were associated with heterogeneous causes. Risk factors for this endpoint included gender, mutation location and type, and prolonged QTc (\u2265 500 m) Beta-blocker therapy was associated with a pronounced reduction in the risk for exercise-triggered events (HR 0.29, P < .01) but had a nonsignificant effect on the risk for arousal and nonexercise/nonarousal events.",

    "5": "Direct developing frogs lack a free-living larval phase, such that miniature adults hatch directly from the eggs. Even under such extreme reorganization of the ancestral biphasic developmental pattern, direct developers still undergo thyroid hormone (TH)-dependent post-embryonic development. Hypothalamic regulation of TH synthesis and release plays a central role in controlling the timing of metamorphosis in biphasic developers. In particular, the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) regulates TH in tadpoles, but in adults, both thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and CRF regulate TH. Because direct developers lack a tadpole stage, it was not clear whether hypothalamic regulation of TH would be tadpole-like or adult-like prior to hatching. To test this, we injected pre-hatching Eleutherodactylus coqui daily with CRF, TRH or astressin (a CRF receptor blocker). CRF but not TRH significantly accelerated the developmental rate compared to controls. Astressin-treated animals showed a near complete developmental arrest, which confirmed that development requires CRF. To support the idea that CRF acts to regulate development in E. coqui via thyroid physiology, we showed the TH-direct response gene TR\u03b2 is up-regulated 24 and 48 h after CRF injection. In addition, treatment with 50 nM T3 (triiodothyronine, the active form of TH) increased the developmental rate similar to CRF injections. Our results extend the evidence for a cryptic metamorphosis in direct developers by showing that neuroendocrine signaling is conserved between biphasic and direct developers. Furthermore, the conserved neuroendocrine regulation implies that changes at the peripheral level of hormone action underlie the evolution of the radically divergent development in direct developers.", 
    "6": "Metoprolol succinate extended release tablets comprise a multiple unit system containing metoprolol succinate in a multitude of controlled release pellets. Each pellet acts as a separate drug delivery unit and is designed to deliver metoprolol continuously over the dosage interval. Despite the flexibility that controlled release pellets may offer, segregation is one of the challenges that commonly occur during tableting for such drug delivery system. Since all commercial metoprolol succinate extended release tablets are scored, they are deemed suitable for splitting. The present study was aimed at utilizing an innovative technology to determine the dose uniformity for split tablets. Four marketed drug products consisting of innovator and generics were evaluated for effect of splitting on weight, assay and content uniformity. Novel analytical tool such as near infrared (NIR) chemical imaging was used to visualize the distribution of metoprolol succinate and functional excipients on the surfaces of the marketed tablets. The non-homogeneous distribution of directly compressed metoprolol succinate beads on the surface of the tablets as well as the split intersection explained the large variation in the split tablets' weight and content uniformity results. The obtained results indicated the usefulness of NIR chemical imaging to determine the need for content uniformity studies for certain split tablets.",

EV bleeding is a life-threatening complication of liver cirrhosis with a high probability of recurrence. Treatment to prevent first EV bleeding or rebleeding is mandatory. In small EV with high risk of bleeding, nonselective \u03b2-blockers should be used for the prevention of first variceal bleeding. For medium to large EV, nonselective \u03b2-blockers or endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) may be recommended to high risk varices. But, nonselective \u03b2-blockers are the first treatment option to non-high risk varices and EVL is an alternative when nonselective \u03b2-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated. For the prevention of rebleeding, a combination of nonselective \u03b2-blockers and EVL may be the best option. A great improvement in the prevention of variceal bleeding has emerged over the last years.

Recently new perspectives opened and erstwhile paradigm has been changed to focus on increased resistance to portal blood flow and the formation of portosystemic collateralization. Several studies revealed the clear-cut mechanisms of hepatic endothelial dysfunction and abnormal angiogenesis contributing to the development of portal hypertension. Thus the modulations of hyperdynamic circulation or angiogenesis seem to be valuable therapeutic targets. In the current review update, we discuss the multidisciplinary management of modulating hepatic vascular resistance and abnormal angiogenesis associated with portal hypertension. However, these new pharmacological approaches are still under investigation and widescale clinical application are needed to develop effective strategies.",

These functional responses were associated with compromised phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3\u03b1. In contrast, isolated single cardiomyocytes from banded PI3K\u03b3KO mice maintained their hypercontractility, suggesting compromised interaction with the extracellular matrix as the primary defect in the banded PI3K\u03b3KO mice. \u03b2-Adrenergic stimulation increased cAMP levels with increased phosphorylation of CREB, leading to increased expression of cAMP-responsive matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), MMP2, MT1-MMP, and MMP13 in cardiomyocytes and cardiofibroblasts. Loss of PI3K\u03b3 resulted in increased cAMP levels with increased expression of MMP2, MT1-MMP, and MMP13 and increased MMP2 activation and collagenase activity in response to biomechanical stress. Selective loss of N-cadherin from the adhesion complexes in the PI3K\u03b3KO mice resulted in reduced cell adhesion. The \u03b2-blocker propranolol prevented the upregulation of MMPs, whereas MMP inhibition prevented the adverse remodeling with both therapies, preventing the functional deterioration in banded PI3K\u03b3KO mice. In banded wild-type mice, long-term propranolol prevented the adverse remodeling and systolic dysfunction with preservation of the N-cadherin levels.",

At least five reports in the literature have described the rapid, successful treatment of airway hemangiomas with oral propanolol. We describe the first reported treatment failure with propanolol for subglottic hemangioma in an infant who initially responded dramatically to the medication.", 
    "30": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) represent a significant health problem in all countries world-wide and in the developed world, including the Czech Republic, in particular. The underlying cause in the majority of CVD patients is atherosclerosis and its complications, respectively. The present paper focuses on prevention and timely treatment of atherosclerosis. Management should be comprehensive and should target the risk factors (RF). Hypertension, hyperlipoproteinaemia and dyslipidemia (HLP and DLP), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), visceral fat obesity and cigarette smoking are the dominating RFs. Even though all RFs have to be managed simultaneously and it is not possible to focus on just one of them, for the sake of clarity, this paper discusses hypertension and the use of telmisartan, a representative of one the most up-to-date group of antihypertensives. There is a growing evidence that it is not always just a reduction of a specific risk that is important but also the mode of treatment. For example, to reduce a CV risk in a patient with hypertension but also, for example, with metabolic syndrome, it is more beneficial to treat the patient with rennin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocking agents, possibly in a combination with calcium channels antagonists, than to use \"traditional\" (older) treatment approach with a combination of a beta/blocker and diuretic. Among the RAS-modifying agents, ACE inhibitors and sartans are the most widely used. Among sartans, telmisartan is very well-tolerated and has evidence from a large interventional study for its effect on reducing the CV risk.", 
    "31": "\u03b2-Adrenoceptor antagonists are used widely to reduce cardiovascular sympathetic tone, but withdrawal is accompanied by sympathetic hyperactivity. Receptor supersensitivity accounts for some but not all aspects of this withdrawal syndrome. Therefore, we investigated effects of \u03b2-blockers on sympathetic innervation. Rats received infusions of adrenergic receptor blockers or saline for 1 week. The nonselective \u03b2-blocker propranolol and the \u03b2(1)-antagonist metoprolol both increased myocardial sympathetic axon density. At 2 d after propranolol discontinuation, \u03b2-receptor sensitivity and responsiveness to isoproterenol were similar to controls. However, tyramine-induced mobilization of norepinephrine stores produced elevated ventricular contractility consistent with enhanced sympathetic neuroeffector properties. In addition, rats undergoing discontinuation showed exaggerated increases in mean arterial pressure in response to air puff or noise startle. In sympathetic neuronal cell cultures, both propranolol and metoprolol increased axon outgrowth but the \u03b2(2)-blocker ICI 118551 did not. Norepinephrine synthesis suppression by \u03b1-methyl-p-tyrosine also increased sprouting and concurrent dobutamine administration reduced it, confirming that locally synthesized norepinephrine inhibits outgrowth via \u03b2(1)-adrenoceptors. Immunohistochemistry revealed \u03b2(1)-adrenoceptor protein on sympathetic axon terminations. In rats with coronary artery ligation, propranolol reversed heart failure-induced ventricular myocardial sympathetic axon depletion, but did not affect infarct-associated sympathetic hyperinnervation. We conclude that sympathetic neurons possess \u03b2(1)-autoreceptors that negatively regulate axon outgrowth. Chronic \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockade disrupts this feedback system, leading to ventricular sympathetic axon proliferation and increased neuroeffector gain, which are likely to contribute to \u03b2-blocker withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "32": "Renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) activation is a key neurohormonal contributor to the progression of chronic heart failure. Strategies that block this activation have consistently demonstrated major beneficial impacts on morbidity and mortality in this setting. Direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) present a novel opportunity to block at an additional or alternative step in this pathway, that being conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Theoretical benefits of blocking at the level of renin include: inhibition of the reflex activation of plasma renin activity induced by conventional downstream RAAS blockers. Minimization of angiotensin II and/or aldosterone escape and blocking upstream at the rate-limiting step of angiotensin I production. Preclinical and early-phase clinical studies have largely supported this hypothesis. In the Aliskiren Observation of Heart Failure Treatment study, patients with systolic chronic heart failure receiving background angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and \u03b2-blockers benefited from aliskiren in reduction vs placebo of plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide, the primary efficacy endpoint of that study. Large-scale outcome trials are, however, required to definitively determine the benefits of a DRI strategy additional to, or as an alternative to, conventional approaches such as ACE inhibitors in the systolic chronic heart failure setting.

This study was conducted to examine whether carazolol can influence hydroxyl radical formation by a Fenton-like reaction [Co(II) + H(2)O(2) + HO(-)] in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The oxygen free radicals and singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) formation was traced by three different assay methods: chemiluminescence (CL), an electron spin resonance (ESR) spin trapping with 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidine and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide, and spectrophotometric determination of (1)O(2) based on bleaching of p-nitrosodimethylaniline. The effect of hydroxyl radical inhibitors and (1)O(2) quenchers on peroxidation of carazolol was also examined. The results indicated that carazolol enhanced the HO radical and (1)O(2) formation in a Fenton-like reaction.", 
    "34": "Anthracyclines are common chemotherapeutic agents used to treat many different types of cancer. Unfortunately, the use of anthracyclines is limited by their cardiotoxic effects, which may become manifest as late as 20\u00a0years from initial exposure. Studies in cells and animals suggest that the mechanism of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC) is multifactorial. Anthracyclines induce multiple forms of cellular injury by free radical production. In addition, anthracyclines alter nucleic acid biology by intercalation into DNA and modulate intracellular signaling, leading to cell death and the disruption of homeostatic processes such as sarcomere maintenance. In an effort to decrease AIC, many strategies have been tested, but no specific therapies are universally acknowledged to prevent or treat anthracycline-induced cardiac dysfunction. Newer imaging modalities and cardiac biomarkers may be useful in improving early detection of cardiac injury and dysfunction. As long as there is no cardiac-specific therapy for AIC, evidence suggests that high-risk patients will benefit from prophylactic treatment with neurohormonal blockade by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers.",

    "40": "Non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) is the commonest acute presentation of coronary artery disease (CAD). Mortality and morbidity of the condition has improved substantially over the last few decades as a result of the cumulative effect of multiple interventions acting via different mechanisms. Despite a significant increase in the rate of coronary intervention, medical therapy continues to retain a central role in the treatment of NSTE-ACS particularly in frail patients where revascularization is inappropriate or when it is incomplete. Several antiischemic agents have been used in the treatment of the condition. Beta blockers are often the first-line choice with calcium channel blockers and nitrates being used as an alternative when beta blockers are contraindicated, or as an addition to achieve optimal symptom control. Newer agents, such as nicorandil, ivabradine, and ranolazine have also been used in refractory cases. Although most of these agents have been extensively studied in large randomized controlled trials in patients with stable CAD or ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (STE-ACS), the evidence supporting their use in NSTE-ACS is less clear cut. In this article, we review various drugs available for controlling ischemia and the latest evidence in support of their use in NSTE-ACS.",

The effects of betablockade on different systems solicited in the exercise, particularly on the cardiocirculatory response during exercise test, rise many questions about the impact of beta blocker treatment on the changes induced by physical training. The cardioselective and vasodilating properties of beta-blockers play a role. It seems that the improved performance assessed by peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) resulting from physical training is not limited by the beta-blocker treatment in patients with chronic heart failure. Synergistic effects have been observed, but many issues remain unsolved.", 
    "52": "Although adrenergic receptors (AR) and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) are implicated in heart failure, their role in diabetic cardiomyopathy is not completely understood. We tested the hypothesis that glucose mediated depletion of beta2-AR and HHcy impair contractile function of cardiomyocytes leading to diabetic cardiomyopathy. To prove the hypothesis, cardiac function was assessed in 12week male diabetic Ins2+/- Akita and C57BL/6J mice by echocardiography, pressure-volume loop, and contractile function of cardiomyocytes. The results revealed cardiac dysfunction in Akita. To investigate the mechanism, the levels of beta2-AR, GLUT4, sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATP-ase-isoform 2 (SERCA-2) and homocysteine (Hcy) metabolic enzymes-cystathionine beta synthase (CBS), cystathionine gamma lyase (CTH), and methyl tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) were determined in the heart. It revealed down-regulation of beta2-AR, GLUT4, SERCA-2, CBS, CTH, and MTHFR in Akita. Attenuation of beta2-AR in hyperglycemic condition was also confirmed in cardiomyocytes at in vitro level. Interestingly, the ex vivo treatment of cardiomyocytes with beta2-AR antagonist deteriorated whereas beta-AR agonist ameliorated contractile function. It points to the involvement of beta2-AR in diabetic cardiomyopathy. We conclude that degradation of beta2-AR and impairment of Hcy metabolism is implicated in diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

    "54": "The authors conducted a chart review study of ED AMI care as part of the National Emergency Department Safety Study (NEDSS). Using a primary hospital discharge diagnosis of AMI (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM], codes 410.XX), a random sample of ED visits for AMI in 58 urban EDs across 20 U.S. states between 2003 and 2006 were identified. Concordance with American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline recommendations was evaluated using five individual quality measures and a composite concordance score. Concordance scores were calculated as the percentage of eligible patients who received guidelines-recommended care. These percentage scores were rescaled from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating perfect concordance.",

The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation [SD]) ED composite concordance score was 61\u2009\u00b1\u20098), with a broad range of values (42 to 84). Except for aspirin use (mean concordance, 82), ED concordance scores were low (beta-blocker use, 56; timely electrocardiogram [ECG], 41; timely fibrinolytic therapy, 26; timely ED disposition for primary percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] candidates, 43). In multivariable analyses, older age (beta-coefficient per 10-year increase, -1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u2009-2.4 to -0.5) and southern EDs (beta-coefficient, -5.2; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-9.6 to -0.9) were associated with lower guideline concordance, whereas ST-segment elevation on initial ED ECG was associated with higher guideline concordance (beta-coefficient, 3.6; 95% CI\u2009= 1.5 to 5.7).",

Inferior alveolar and buccal nerve blocks were performed with 2% lidocaine hydrochloride (HCl), 2% prilocaine HCl or 3% mepivacaine HCl without vasoconstrictor. Hemodynamic parameters namely systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), saturation rate (SR), rate pressure product (RPP) and pressure rate quotient (PRQ) were investigated before and at different intervals after anesthetic injection.",

    "64": "Angiotensin II (ANG II) contributes to hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction; however, it is difficult to separate the cardiac effect of ANG II from its hemodynamic action in vivo. To overcome the limitations, we used transgenic mice with cardiac-specific expression of a transgene fusion protein that releases ANG II from cardiomyocytes (Tg-ANG II) and treated them with deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt to suppress their systemic renin-angiotensin system. Using this unique model, we tested the hypothesis that cardiac ANG II, acting on the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT(1)R), increases inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, accelerating cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Male Tg-ANG II mice and their nontransgenic littermates (n-Tg) were uninephrectomized and divided into the following three groups: 1) vehicle-treated normotensive controls; 2) DOCA-salt; and 3) DOCA-salt + valsartan (AT(1)R blocker).Under basal conditions, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and cardiac phenotypes were similar between strains. In DOCA-salt hypertension, SBP increased similarly in both n-Tg and Tg-ANG II, and cardiac function did not differ between strains; however, Tg-ANG II had 1) greater ventricular hypertrophy as well as interstitial and perivascular fibrosis; 2) a higher number of deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells and infiltrating macrophages; 3) increased protein expression of NADPH oxidase 2 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2(1); and 4) downregulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation. Valsartan partially reversed these effects in Tg-ANG II but not in n-Tg. We conclude that, when hemodynamic loading conditions remain unchanged, cardiac ANG II does not alter heart size or cardiac functions. However, in animals with hypertension, cardiac ANG II, acting via AT(1)R, enhances inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell death (most likely via downregulation of PI 3-kinase and Akt), contributing to cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.",

    "66": "Frequently measured pharmaceuticals in environmental samples were tested in fish embryo toxicity (FET) tests with Danio rerio, based on the draft OECD test protocol. In this FET test 2-h-old zebrafish embryos were exposed for 72 h to carbamazepine, diclofenac and metoprolol to observe effects on embryo mortality, gastrulation, somite formation, tail movement and detachment, pigmentation, heartbeat, malformation of head, otoliths and heart, scoliosis, deformity of yolk, and hatching success at 24, 48 and 72 h. We found specific effects on growth retardation above 30.6 mg/l for carbamazepine, on hatching, yolk sac and tail deformation above 1.5mg/l for diclofenac, and on scoliosis and growth retardation above 12.6 mg/l for metoprolol. Scoring all effect parameters, the 72-h-EC(50) values were: for carbamazepine 86.5mg/l, for diclofenac 5.3mg/l and for metoprolol 31.0mg/l (mean measured concentrations). In conclusion, our results for carbamazepine and metoprolol are in agreement with other findings for aquatic toxicity, and also fish embryos responded in much the same way as rat embryos did. For diclofenac, the FET test performs comparably to Early Life Stage testing.", 
    "67": "A clinically significant interaction between epinephrine or levonordefrin with nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agents, although apparently rare in the dental setting, is potentially serious and can lead to significant hypertension with a concomitant reflex bradycardia. Based on the results of epinephrine infusion studies, the severity of the interaction seems dose related; small epinephrine doses cause less of a pressor response than larger doses. The interaction can be seen after intraoral submucosal injections but is generally of a smaller magnitude, at least with only 1 or 2 cartridges of lidocaine plus 1:100,000 epinephrine. However as demonstrated by 1 case report, some individuals are hypersensitive to this interaction. Inadvertent intravascular injections of local anesthetic plus vasoconstrictor and the use of high doses of vasoconstrictor are likely to result in a more pronounced response. Patients with significant cardiovascular disease may be especially vulnerable to the most serious sequelae resulting from the pressor reactions of the drug combination.", 
    "68": "Dispensing medicines into compliance aids is a common practice in pharmacy contrary to manufacturers' advice and studies have shown the appearance of light-sensitive tablets is compromised by such storage; we previously found evidence of reduced bioavailability at elevated temperature and humidity. Our objective was to examine the physicochemical stability of two generic atenolol tablets in different compliance aids and with aspirin co-storage at room temperature and at 40 \u00b0C/75% relative humidity.",

    "70": "The response to storage was brand-dependent and not straightforward. With one make of atenolol (Alpharma), storage in compliance aids even at room temperature impacted on physical stability, reducing tablet hardness, with storage in Dosett exerting a greater impact than storage in Medidos (t-test P<0\u00b7001). Co-storage at elevated temperature and humidity also impacted on the appearance of non-coated aspirin tablets (Angette). The chemical stability of atenolol was not affected and we did not find evidence of changes to bioavailability with either make. Certainly data for one atenolol make (CP Pharmaceuticals) co-stored with aspirin (Angette and Nu-Seals) in both compliance aids at room temperature provided evidence of short-term stability. But medicines are dispensed into compliance aids in multi-factorial ways so our study highlights not only the lack of evidence but also a realization that evidence to support real practice may not be accomplished through research.",

For this purpose, a D-optimal design with 21 experimental points was applied. Four antifungal agents (econazole, isoconazole, miconazole, sulconazole), three local anesthetics (bupivacaine, mepivacaine and prilocaine), two sympathomimetics (salbutamol and terbutaline) and one \u03b2-blocker (carvedilol) were selected as basic model analytes. The influence on the enantiomeric resolution of anionic CD and BGE anion concentrations as well as the BGE anion nature was investigated. For all studied analytes, the enantiomeric resolution was shown to be significantly influenced by the CD concentration. Based on the observed results, a generic NACE system was recommended, namely 20mM HMAS-\u03b2-CD and 10mM ammonium camphor SO(3)(-) in methanol acidified with 0.75 M formic acid. Moreover, this NACE system was compared to previous conditions with heptakis(2,3-di-O-methyl-6-O-sulfo)-\u03b2-CD (HDMS-\u03b2-CD) or heptakis(2,3-di-O-acetyl-6-O-sulfo)-\u03b2-CD (HDAS-\u03b2-CD). Finally, two generic systems using either HDAS-\u03b2-CD or HMAS-\u03b2-CD were proposed and evaluated for the enantioseparation of ketamine and norketamine after incubation of ketamine in phenobarbital-induced male rat liver microsomes systems.", 
    "73": "The kinetics of oxidation and disinfection processes during ozonation in a full-scale reactor treating secondary wastewater effluent were investigated for seven ozone doses ranging from 0.21 to 1.24 g O(3) g(-1) dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Substances reacting fast with ozone, such as diclofenac or carbamazepine (k(P, O3) > 10(4) M(-1) s(-1)), were eliminated within the gas bubble column, except for the lowest ozone dose of 0.21 g O(3) g(-1) DOC. For this low dose, this could be attributed to short-circuiting within the reactor. Substances with lower ozone reactivity (k(P, O3) < 10(4) M(-1) s(-1)) were only fully eliminated for higher ozone doses. The predictions of micropollutant oxidation based on coupling reactor hydraulics with ozone chemistry and reaction kinetics were up to a factor of 2.5 higher than full-scale measurements. Monte Carlo simulations showed that the observed differences were higher than model uncertainties. The overestimation of micropollutant oxidation was attributed to a protection of micropollutants from ozone attack by the interaction with aquatic colloids. Laboratory-scale batch experiments using wastewater from the same full-scale treatment plant could predict the oxidation of slowly-reacting micropollutants on the full-scale level within a factor of 1.5. The Rct value, the experimentally determined ratio of the concentrations of hydroxyl radicals and ozone, was identified as a major contribution to this difference. An increase in the formation of bromate, a potential human carcinogen, was observed with increasing ozone doses. The final concentration for the highest ozone dose of 1.24 g O(3) g(-1) DOC was 7.5 \u03bcg L(-1), which is below the drinking water standard of 10 \u03bcg L(-1). N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation of up to 15 ng L(-1) was observed in the first compartment of the reactor, followed by a slight elimination during sand filtration. Assimilable organic carbon (AOC) increased up to 740 \u03bcg AOC L(-1), with no clear trend when correlated to the ozone dose, and decreased by up to 50% during post-sand filtration. The disinfection capacity of the ozone reactor was assessed to be 1-4.5 log units in terms of total cell counts (TCC) and 0.5 to 2.5 log units for Escherichia coli (E. coli). Regrowth of up to 2.5 log units during sand filtration was observed for TCC while no regrowth occurred for E. coli. E. coli inactivation could not be accurately predicted by the model approach, most likely due to shielding of E. coli by flocs.", 
    "74": "Acute psychological stress challenges the cardiovascular system with an increase in BP (blood pressure), HR (heart rate) and reduced BRS (baroreflex sensitivity). \u03b2-adrenergic blockade enhances BRS during rest, but its effect on BRS during acute psychological stress is unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that BRS is higher during acute psychological stress in healthy subjects under \u03b2-adrenergic blockade. Twenty healthy novice male bungee jumpers were randomized and studied with (PROP, n=10) or without (CTRL, n=10) propranolol. BP and HR responses and BRS [cross-correlation time-domain (BRSTD) and cross-spectral frequency-domain (BRSFD) analysis] were evaluated from 30 min prior up to 2 h after the jump. HR, cardiac output and pulse pressure were lower in the PROP group throughout the study. Prior to the bungee jump, BRS was higher in the PROP group compared with the CTRL group [BRSTD: 28 (24-42) compared with 17 (16-28) ms\u00b7mmHg-1, P<0.05; BRSFD: 27 (20-34) compared with 14 (9-19) ms\u00b7mmHg-1, P<0.05; values are medians (interquartile range)]. BP declined after the jump in both groups, and post-jump BRS did not differ between the groups. In conclusion, during acute psychological stress, BRS is higher in healthy subjects treated with non-selective \u03b2-adrenergic blockade with significantly lower HR but comparable BP.",

We assessed trends in adherence to angiotensin-system blockers (ABs), \u03b2-blockers (BBs), and spironolactone (SL) for HF in Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in two statewide pharmacy benefit programs from 1995 to 2004. The proportion of days covered (PDC) (%) was assessed after the first dispensing among users of an AB, BB, or SL. Proportions of full adherence (PDC >80%) did not change over time for ABs (54% in both 1996 and 2003) but increased slightly for BBs (from 47% in 1996 to 57% in 2003) and SL (from 31% in 1996 to 42% in 2003).

    "82": "Once considered as nothing more than a nuisance after cardiac surgery, the importance of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) has been realized in the last decade, primarily because of the morbidity associated with the condition. Numerous causative factors have been described without any single factor being singled out as the cause of this complication. POAF has been associated with stroke, renal failure and congestive heart failure, although it is difficult to state whether POAF is directly responsible for these complications. Guidelines have been formulated for prevention of POAF. However, very few cardiothoracic centers follow any form of protocol to prevent POAF. Routine use of prophylaxis would subject all patients to the side effects of anti-arrhythmic drugs, while only a minority of the patients do actually develop this problem postoperatively. Withdrawal of beta blockers in the postoperative period has been implicated as one of the major causes of POAF. Amiodarone, calcium channel blockers and a variety of other pharmacological agents have been used for the prevention of POAF. Atrial pacing is a non-pharmacological measure which has gained popularity in the prevention of POAF. There is considerable controversy regarding whether rate control is superior to rhythm control in the treatment of established atrial fibrillation (AF). Amiodarone plays a central role in both rate control and rhythm control in postoperative AF. Newer drugs like dronedarone and ranazoline are likely to come into the market in the coming years.",

Inhibition of ADMA synthesis or intensification of metabolism of this compound might indirectly lower ADMA. Antioxidants, estrogen, vitamin A, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists, and also some hypolipemic, hypoglycemic and beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs decrease ADMA levels. In some situations like neurological disorders, decreased plasma levels of ADMA are noticed and drugs increasing the concentration of this compound could exert protective effects. It is reasonable to explore which drugs can increase or decrease ADMA levels and what their mechanism of that action is.",

Microspheres of different mucoadhesive polymers including hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) K15M and carbopol 971P were prepared. In this technique cross linking of sodium alginate with calcium chloride was done which retarded the release of drug from the mucoadhesive polymer. In the present work atenolol was used as model drug. Interaction studies performed using FT-IR spectroscopy revealed that there was no drug to polymer interactions. Multiparticulates so prepared were discrete, bulky, free flowing and showed an average encapsulation efficiency ranging from 23-74%. Particle size of the multiparticulates as determined by the scanning electron microscopic analysis (SEM) studies was found to be between 561-831 microm. The prepared formulations also exhibited a good mucoadhesive strength which was determined in in vitro conditions through falling film technique. The multiparticulate so prepared also exhibited a good swelling index which confirmed the strong mucoadhesive property of the formulation. Atenolol release from the multiparticulate system was regulated and extended until 12 h and exhibited a non-Fickian anomalous transport from the swellable microspheres, as evident from the release rate exponent values which varied between 0.569-0.622. The stability studies performed on the optimized batch at 40 degrees C/75% RH for 90 d indicated no significant change in the physicochemical properties. In vivo radioimaging studies in rabbits showed the residence of mucoadhesive microspheres for 6-8 h in upper part of gastrointestinal tract (GIT).",

Age may be linked to an increased consumption of drugs: aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-blockers, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). A case-control study comparing anaphylaxis and mild food allergies has shown a sharp increase of consumption of these drugs in patients with anaphylaxis, with odds ratio respectively of 10.8 [CI 95%: 3.10-41.3], 8.2 [CI 95%: 1.37-62.51], 6.8 [CI 95%: 1.78-27.78] and 13 [CI 95%: 1.34-310.38]. Besides, exercise potentiates the relative risk of drug consumption. Predominant mechanisms could be an increase of gut permeability enhancing the passage of food allergens in the mucosa and in blood, and the inhibition of ACE, so that the angiotensin homeostatic mechanism deteriorates. Main sites of interference may be endothelium and gut epithelium. Preventive measures excluding the intake of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs before the meals can be recommended for food allergic and food sensitized adults.

However, the mechanisms involved in life extension in this animal model with increased longevity have not been clarified, although a decrease in oxidative stress has been proposed as mediator. Two traits link longevity and oxidative stress. Long-lived mammals and birds have a low rate of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitROS) generation and a low degree of membrane fatty acid unsaturation, but these key factors have not been studied in AC5 KO mice. In the present investigation, male C57BL/6 mice were treated with the \u03b2-blocker atenolol in drinking water, and oxidative stress-related parameters were measured in the heart. Atenolol treatment did not change the rate of mitROS production and oxidative damage to mitDNA (8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine [8-oxodG]), but strongly decreased the degree of fatty acid unsaturation and the peroxidizability index, mainly due to decreases in 22:6n-3 and 20:4n-6 and to increases in 18:1n-9, 16:1n-7 and 16:0 in the atenolol group. Protein oxidation and lipoxidation were lower in the atenolol group than in the controls. The mitochondrial complex I and IV content and the amount of p-ERK1/2 signaling proteins were significantly higher in the atenolol-treated than in the control animals. These results support the idea that the increased longevity of the AC5 KO mice can be due in part to an ERK signaling-mediated stress-resistance due to a decrease in fatty acid unsaturation, leading to lower lipid peroxidation and decreased lipoxidation-derived damage to cellular proteins.",

Here we investigated the feasibility of modifying Alzheimer's pathology with the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blockers verapamil, diltiazem, isradipine and nimodipine. All four compounds protected MC65 neuroblastoma cells from amyloid beta protein precursor C-terminal fragment (APP CTF)-induced neurotoxicity. Isradipine was the most potent blocker, preventing APP CTF neurotoxicity at nanomolar concentrations. Intracellular beta amyloid expression was associated with increased expression of Cav 1.2 calcium channels and increased intracellular calcium influx from the extracellular space. Despite the cytoprotection afforded by calcium channel blockers, amyloid beta oligomer formation was not suppressed. The mechanism of cell death in MC65 cells is appeared to be caspase-3 independent. With the goal of determining if there is sufficient experimental support to move forward with animal trials of isradipine, we determined its bioavailability in the triple transgenic mouse model of AD. Subcutaneous implantation of carrier-bound isradipine (3 \u03bcg/g/day) for 60 days resulted in nanomolar concentrations in both the plasma and brain. Taken together, our in vitro results support the theory that calcium blockers exert protective effects downstream of the effects of beta amyloid. Isradipine's neuroprotective effect at concentrations that are clinically relevant and achievable in vitro and in vivo suggests that this particular calcium blocking agent may have therapeutic value in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

The exclusion criteria included previous myocardial infarction (MI) or HF, ejection fraction < or =45%, and a discharge diagnosis of MI/beta-blocker treatment. Baseline PRA measurements were evaluated as risk categories (< or =0.50, 0.51 to 2.30, and >2.30 ng/ml/h) and as tertiles (< or =0.40, 0.41 to 1.90, and > or =1.90 ng/ml/h). Predefined cardiovascular outcomes were assessed for a minimum follow-up of 3 years (mean 6.4 +/- 3.2, maximum 14.6) using Cox regression analysis to adjust for the baseline characteristics. The mean patient age was 64.4 years; most patients were men (73.1%) and hypertensive (63.2%). Elevated baseline PRA (high vs low category; >2.30 vs < or =0.50 ng/ml/h) was associated with a significantly increased risk of 3-year cardiac morbidity/mortality (hazard ratio 1.96; p = 0.004), MI (hazard ratio 2.41; p = 0.02), HF hospitalization (hazard ratio 4.39; p = 0.03), and all-cause death (hazard ratio 1.80; p = 0.01). Elevated baseline PRA was also associated with longer-term HF hospitalization (hazard ratio 2.12; p = 0.004) and all-cause death (hazard ratio 1.56; p = 0.002). Similar results were observed for the PRA tertiles. The association of PRA with outcomes was observed after correction for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, a family history of cardiovascular events, smoking, renal failure, and the use of statins. In conclusion, elevated baseline PRA is associated with cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease but normal left ventricular function and no previous MI or HF.",

To evaluate the pain intensity changes in outpatient groups, who receive these drugs as a therapy, a cross-sectional sampled, randomized patient groups receiving the calcium channel blocker amlodipine for blood hypertension (n=45), beta adrenergic receptor blockers (propranolol, atenolol or pindolol; n=40) for blood hypertension, or digoxin (n=40) for heart failure, were compared to an aparently healthy volunteers control group (n=60). A calibrated noxious pressure of 890 g/mm2 was applied for 5 seconds on the patient's sternum. Subjective pain intensity was reported by the visual analog scale (VAS, 0 to 10).

The analgesic effect of the beta blockers group (propanolol, atenolol, pindolol) was dosage-dependant (-36.8%; P = 0.0000003), without differences among them. The calcium channel blocker amlodipine showed lower pain scores (-50.6%; P = 0.0000003) than beta-receptor blockers (P = 0.0000003). Digoxin presented the highest pain scores (+56.5%; P = 0.0000003). All pain scores for the second stimulus were lower than the first stimulus and were differentially affected by beta-blockers (atenolol, pindolol and propanolol) and calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), but not by digoxin.

Low activities for dealkylation of ethoxyresorufin and pentoxyresorufin were seen in recombinant monkey mfCYP3A4 and mfCYP3A5 and in recombinant human CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 expressed in bacterial membranes. Hydroxylation activities of mfCYP3A4 and mfCYP3A5 toward coumarin, paclitaxel, diclofenac, flurbiprofen, and S-mephenytoin were below detectable levels, as was also true for CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Monkey mfCYP3A5 and mfCYP3A4 were highly active in bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation. mfCYP3A5 was efficient at dextromethorphan O-demethylation, although human CYP3A5 was unable to catalyze this reaction. Apparent bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation and dextromethorphan O-demethylation activities of monkey liver microsomes were higher than those of human liver microsomes, possibly because of contributions of mfCYP3A5 to these P450 2D-dependent drug oxidations. mfCYP3A5 and CYP3A5 catalyzed midazolam 1'-hydroxylation at a low substrate concentration more efficiently than the corresponding CYP3A4. mfCYP3A5 had higher testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase activity than mfCYP3A4, but the reverse relationship was observed in oxidation of nifedipine and hydroxylation of dexamethasone. These results demonstrate that monkey P450 3A enzymes have similar substrate selectivity to that of human P450 3A enzymes, but exhibit wider substrate selectivity toward P450 2D substrates.",

    "156": "A number of structural and functional mechanisms have been identified in the pathogenesis of hypertensive vascular disease, each of which requires effective therapy to reduce global cardiovascular risk. Hypertension, together with other cardiovascular risk factors, promotes endothelial dysfunction as evidenced by decreased nitric oxide (NO) release and reduced vascular responsiveness to normal vasodilatory stimuli. In addition, the mechanical forces inherent in hypertension activate neurohormonal mechanisms, including the renin-angiotensin system, which modulate vessel wall structure and function. Antihypertensive drugs may have class-specific hemodynamic and physiologic effects that attenuate these vascular disease processes. Pharmacologic approaches that enhance endothelial NO bioavailability have been shown to restore vasodilation while reducing clinical events. These agents improve NO bioavailability by increasing endogenous production through enzymatic mechanisms or by promoting the direct release of NO by its redox congeners in a spontaneous fashion. In this article, we review the basic mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction along with the use and comparative therapeutic benefits of various pharmacologic interventions, with particular emphasis on antihypertensive agents.", 
    "157": "Treatment of rodents with a bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS-3) agonist reduces food intake and increases fasting metabolic rate, causing weight loss with continued treatment. In small mammals, core body temperature (T(b)) is regulated in part by nutritional status, with a reduced T(b) during fasting. We report that fed Brs3 knockout mice have a lower T(b), which is discordant with their nutritional status. Treatment of wild-type mice with a BRS-3 agonist increased T(b), more so when the baseline T(b) was reduced such as by fasting or during the inactive phase of the light cycle. With repeated BRS-3 agonist dosing, the T(b) increase attenuated despite continued weight loss efficacy. The increase in T(b) was not prevented by inhibitors of prostaglandin E (PGE) production but was partially reduced by a \u03b2-adrenergic blocker. These results demonstrate that BRS-3 has a role in body temperature regulation, presumably secondary to its effect on energy metabolism, including effects on sympathetic tone. By making use of this phenomenon, the reversal of the fasting T(b) reduction was developed into a sensitive single-dose pharmacodynamic assay for BRS-3 agonism and other antiobesity compounds acting by various mechanisms, including sibutramine, cannabinoid-1, and melanin-concentrating hormone-1 receptor blockers, and melanocortin, \u03b2\u2083-adrenergic, and cholecystokinin-1 receptor agonists. These drugs increased both the fasted T(b) and the fasted, resting metabolic rates. The T(b) assay is a robust, information-rich assay that is simpler and has a greater throughput than measuring metabolic rate and is a practical, effective tool for drug discovery.", 
    "158": "Activation of vascular adrenoreceptors (ARs) governs the magnitude and distribution of muscle blood flow in accord with the distribution of AR subtypes. Functional studies in the rat cremaster muscle indicate that \u03b11ARs predominate in proximal arterioles (first-order, 1A) while \u03b12ARs predominate in distal arterioles (third-order, 3A). However, little is known of AR subtype distribution in arteriolar networks of locomotor skeletal muscles, particularly in the mouse. We tested the hypotheses that functional AR subtypes exhibit heterogeneity among branches of arteriolar networks in a locomotor muscle and that the nature of this heterogeneity can vary between muscles having diverse functions. In anaesthetized male C57BL/6J mice (3 months old), concentration-response curves (10(-9) m to 10(-5) m, 0.5 log increments) were evaluated in the gluteus maximus muscle superfused with physiological saline solution (35\u00b0C, pH 7.4; n \u2265 5 per group). Noradrenaline (NA, non-selective \u03b1AR agonist) constricted 1A, 2A and 3A with similar potency and efficacy. Phenylephrine (PE; \u03b11AR agonist) evoked greater (P < 0.05) constriction in 3A (inhibited by 10(-8) m prazosin; \u03b11AR antagonist) while UK 14304 (UK; \u03b12AR agonist) evoked greater (P < 0.05) constriction in 1A (inhibited by 10(-7) m rauwolscine; \u03b12AR antagonist). Isoproterenol (isoprenaline; \u03b2AR agonist) dilated 1A, 2A and 3A near-maximally with similar potency and efficacy; these dilatations were inhibited by 10(-7) m propranolol (\u03b2AR antagonist) which otherwise had no effect on responses to NA, PE, or UK. Complementary experiments in the mouse cremaster muscle revealed a pattern of \u03b1AR subtype distribution that, while distinct from the gluteus maximus muscle, was consistent with that reported for the rat cremaster muscle. We conclude that functional \u03b1AR subtype distribution in arteriolar networks of skeletal muscle varies with muscle function as well as vessel branch order.", 
    "159": "Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial arrhythmic syndrome caused by mutations in genes encoding the calcium-regulation proteins cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) or calsequestrin-2 (CASQ2). Mechanistic studies indicate that CPVT is mediated by diastolic Ca(2+) overload and increased Ca(2+) leak through the RyR2 channel, implying that treatment targeting these defects might be efficacious in CPVT.",

Treatment effects on ventricular arrhythmia, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein expression and Ca(2+) transients of isolated myocytes were assessed. Each study agent reduced the frequency of stress-induced ventricular arrhythmia in mutant mice. The Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil was most efficacious and completely prevented arrhythmia in 85% of mice. Verapamil significantly increased the SR Ca(2+) content in mutant myocytes, diminished diastolic Ca(2+) overload, increased systolic Ca(2+) amplitude, and prevented Ca(2+) oscillations in stressed mutant myocytes.",

Verapamil-induced partial normalization of SR Ca(2+) content in mutant myocytes implicates CASQ2 as modulator of RyR2 activity, rather than or in addition to, Ca(2+) buffer protein. Agents such as verapamil that attenuate cardiomyocyte calcium overload are appropriate for assessing clinical efficacy in human CPVT.",

New-onset AF occurred most frequently in patients who were aged > or =60 years and who had no history of beta-blocker use. In addition, patients were more likely to develop new-onset AF if they had valve surgery alone (16.5%) or CABG plus valve surgery combined (9.6%), needed intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABC), or had a long cardiopulmonary bypass time. Multivariate analysis identified the following predictors of postoperative AF: older age, history of renal failure, congestive heart disease, operation type, longer perfusion time, and use of IABC.
