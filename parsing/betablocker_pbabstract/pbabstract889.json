    "0": "We have investigated the possibility that alterations in the duration of the systolic preejection period can be used to estimate adrenergic influences on the human left ventricle. The preejection period was determined from high speed, simultaneous recordings of the phonocardiogram, carotid pulse tracing, and electrocardiogram. The preejection period was shortened by isoproterenol, epinephrine, and moderate doses of norepinephrine-all of which activate beta adrenergic receptors-and by cedilanid-D. It was unaltered by changes in heart rate induced by atropine and right atrial electrical pacing. Beta adrenergic receptor blockade by propranolol abolished the shortening effects of the three catecholamines but did not inhibit that due to cedilanid-D. Vasoconstriction, both alpha adrenergic (epinephrine and norepinephrine after propranolol) and nonadrenergic (angiotensin), prolonged the preejection period. Most of the shortening of the preejection period by beta adrenergic receptor activating agents and cedilanid-D and all of the prolongation accompanying pharmacologic vasoconstriction occurred after the onset of the first heart sound, thereby excluding changes in electrical-mechanical delay as a major factor in the observed preejection period responses. Shortening of the preejection period by beta adrenergic activity induced with isoproterenol was dose-related. Increasing doses of propranolol produced parallel shifts to the right in the isoproterenol dose-response curve. In 37 normal resting subjects intravenous propranolol (10 mg) prolonged the preejection period an average of 10 (SE +/- 1) msec. In six patients with psychogenic sinus tachycardia and a patient with a pheochromocytoma the presence of excessive beta adrenergic influences on the left ventricle was demonstrated by the finding of an initially short preejection period which responded with an abnormally great prolongation to beta adrenergic receptor blockade.", 
    "1": "1. Changes in temperature were determined following injection of noradrenaline, adrenaline, isoprenaline, dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) into the cerebral ventricles of the conscious mouse.2. Noradrenaline (1-20 mug) and dopamine (10-160 mug) caused falls in body temperature. Adrenaline (1-20 mug) caused a slight and transient rise in body temperature followed by a fall. Isoprenaline (5-20 mug) caused a rise in body temperature, hypothermia only occurring after very high doses (200 mug) of this catecholamine.3. alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agents, phentolamine (> 2 mug) and propranolol (> 5 mug) respectively, caused falls in body temperature when injected into the cerebral ventricles of the mouse.4. Specific drug antagonism studies were limited owing to the intrinsic effects of the alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agents. However, some evidence was obtained to indicate that noradrenaline mediated its effects through a central alpha-type adrenergic receptor.5. 5-HT (10-160 mug) caused a fall in body temperature. The action of this indoleamine and the catecholamines in regard to thermoregulatory function is discussed.", 
    "2": "The in vivo metabolic events which follow the administration of epinephrine, norepinephrine, or isoproterenol were examined in normal, Bordetella pertussis-vaccinated, and alpha and beta adrenergically blocked mice. The normal hyperglycemic response to epinephrine was suppressed in all experimental groups. The pertussis-sensitized and beta-blocked animals produced similar split patterns of altered response not duplicated by the alpha-blocking compounds. Those catecholamines that normally increase free fatty acids and lactic acid in the circulation failed to do so in the pertussis-sensitized and beta-blocked animals; the inhibition of free fatty acid mobilization was also demonstrated with adipose tissue incubated in vitro. An extract of the pertussis organism added to incubation media prevented the catecholamine-induced free fatty acid response. The epinephrine-stabilizing effect of bovine serum albumin (Cohn-fraction V) was observed. The results of these studies further emphasize a correlation between pertussis-sensitized and beta-adrenergically blocked mice."
