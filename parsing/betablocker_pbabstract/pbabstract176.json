Because of a growing expectancy of lives, the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases is increasing, and thus the number of surgical patients presenting with a cardiovascular risk profile. Based upon pathophysiological considerations, different interventions to lower perioperative cardiovascular risk have been evaluated. The mostly discussed intervention believed to prevent cardiovascular complications in the perioperative period is the use of beta-blockers. Although many authors agree that perioperative beta-blockade is effective in high-risk patients, less is known about the optimal timing, dosage and the identification of patients in whom the intervention would be beneficial. Based upon the available data we try to answer questions about timing and dosage, and we discuss possible side effects and economic questions. Another cardioprotective option is the use of statins. Besides their lipid-lowering properties, so called pleiotropic effects are believed to decrease cardiac risk. Furthermore, different interventions can be used in addition to or as an alternative to perioperative beta-blocker therapy, such as alpha-2 agonists, thoracic epidural analgesia or coronary revascularization.",

Atrial interstitial fibrosis has been seen in patients with CHF and in animal models of pacing-induced heart failure. With atrial fibrosis, conduction abnormalities result in increased AF vulnerability. The mechanism of AF associated with CHF is under debate, as both focal and reentrant mechanisms have been observed in animal models of CHF. However, recent studies using frequency-domain analysis have shown that the AF within this model is characterized by discrete, stable, high-frequency areas. The precise signaling processes involved in the development of atrial fibrosis are unknown. Angiotensin appears to play a role, as inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (or angiotensin-receptor blocker) blunts atrial fibrosis in animal models of heart failure and decreases the incidence of AF in patients with heart failure. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) also appears to play an important role. Mouse models that overexpress TGF-beta1 have profound atrial fibrosis and AF (with normal ventricles). Heart failure in canine models also produces increases in atrial TGF-beta1 expression, and inhibition of this expression prevents atrial fibrosis and the development of a substrate for AF. Atrial fibrosis appears to play a role in the development of a vulnerable substrate for AF, especially in the setting of CHF.",

Peristalsis moves the capsule to the desired location in the gut where it is anchored before administration via the tube. Drug uptake is followed by plasma sampling. One capsule type is used for solutions, another for solid formulations. With solutions, repeated administrations could be done with the capsule being anchored for 24h or longer or, alternatively, at several locations along the gut. This communication presents the method and an overview of 13 uptake and enzyme/transporter localization studies. Altogether, 268 intubations were undertaken in a total of 128 subjects. Plasma concentrations found with terbutaline and metoprolol are presented showing that terbutaline has its best uptake in the upper small intestine, whereas metoprolol shows the same bioavailability along the whole gut. Subjects could undertake most of their normal activities while carrying the equipment. No serious adverse events (AEs) occurred.

    "37": "The roles of beta-NER (beta-noradrenergic receptor), GR (glucocorticoid) and mineral corticoid receptors (MR) in the consolidation of anxiogenic effects of predator stress were studied. One minute after predator stress, different groups of rats were injected (ip) with vehicle, propranolol (beta-NER blocker, 5 and 10 mg/kg), mifepristone (RU486, GR blocker, 20 mg/kg), spironolactone (MR blocker, 50 mg/kg), propranolol (5 mg/kg) plus RU486 (20 mg/kg) or the anxiolytic, chloradiazepoxide (CPZ, 10 mg/kg). One week later, rodent anxiety was assessed in elevated plus maze, hole board, light/dark box, social interaction and acoustic startle. Considering all tests except startle, propranolol dose dependently blocked consolidation of lasting anxiogenic effects of predator stress in all tests. GR receptor block alone was ineffective. However, GR block in combination with an ineffective dose of propranolol did blocked consolidation of predator stress effects in all tests, suggesting a synergism between beta-NER and GR. Surprisingly, MR block prevented consolidation of anxiogenic effects in all tests except the light/dark box. CPZ post stress was ineffective against the anxiogenic impact of predator stress. Study of startle was complicated by the fact that anxiogenic effects of stress on startle amplitude manifested as both an increase and a decrease in startle amplitude. Suppression of startle occurred in stressed plus vehicle injected groups handled three times prior to predator stress. In contrast, stressed plus vehicle rats handled five times prior to predator stress showed increases in startle, as did all predator stressed only groups. Mechanisms of consolidation of the different startle responses appear to differ. CPZ post stress blocked startle suppression but not enhancement of startle. Propranolol post stress had no effect on either suppression or enhancement of startle. GR block alone post stress prevented suppression of startle, but not enhancement. In contrast blocking GR and beta-NER together prevented startle enhancement. MR block also prevented startle enhancement. Effects of MR block on startle suppression were not tested. Delay of habituation to startle was found in all stressed rats. Consolidation of delay of habituation was blocked or attenuated by post stress MR block, GR plus beta-NER block and CPZ but not by post stress GR or beta-NER block alone. Taken together, present findings suggest consolidation of lasting anxiogenic effects of predator stress may share some of the same neurochemical mechanisms implicated in some forms of fear memory consolidation. Implications of these findings for the study of stress-induced changes in affect including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are discussed.", 
    "38": "Stress-induced activation of the locus ceruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system produces significant cognitive and behavioral effects, including enhanced arousal and attention. Improvements in discrimination task performance and memory have been attributed to this stress response. In contrast, for other cognitive functions that require cognitive flexibility, increased activity of the LC-NE system may produce deleterious effects. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of pharmacological modulation of the LC-NE system on stress-induced impairments in cognitive flexibility performance in healthy individuals. Cognitive performance, plus psychological and physiological parameters for 16 adults without any history of anxiety disorders, was assessed during four test sessions: stress and no-stress, with each condition tested after administration of propranolol and placebo. The Trier Social Stress Test, a public-speaking and mental arithmetic stressor, was presented to participants for the stress sessions, whereas a similar, but nonstressful, control task (reading, counting) was utilized for the no-stress sessions. Tests of cognitive flexibility included lexical-semantic and associative problem-solving tasks (anagrams, Compound Remote Associates Test). Visuo-spatial memory and motor processing speed tests served as control tasks. Results indicate that (1) stress impaired performance on cognitive flexibility tasks, but not control tasks; (2) compared to placebo, cognitive flexibility improved during stress with propranolol. Therefore, psychological stress, such as public speaking, negatively impacts performance on tasks requiring cognitive flexibility in normal individuals, and this effect is reversed by beta-adrenergic antagonism. This may provide support for the hypothesis that stress-related impairments in cognitive flexibility are related to the noradrenergic system.",

This was achieved by testing healthy young men during exercise while varying both the condition of beta-adrenergic blockage and the presence of a well-controlled simulated competitive environment to simulate activity of the sympatho-adrenal systems. Subjects (n = 10) performed maximal exercise (running) to exhaustion on a treadmill during four conditions: (1) placebo non-competitive [PNon] (2) after administration of 80 mg propranolol non-competitive [betaNon] (3) in a simulated competition after a placebo intake [PCom], and (4) in a simulated competition after propranolol intake [betaCom]. Blood samples were obtained before (pre-) and 3 min after (post-) exercise and assayed for cortisol (C). The data were analyzed with a multi-factorial repeated measures ANCOVA procedure. Statistical analysis revealed a significant three-way interaction for the drug versus competition versus sampling time effects (P < 0.05). Post-hoc tests revealed that the pre-exercise cortisol values did not differ significantly among the conditions. Cortisol did increase from pre- to post-exercise in all experimental conditions (P < 0.01), and the magnitudes of increase in the PCom, betaNon and betaCom conditions were greater than that of the PNon condition. Furthermore, the cortisol increases for both beta-blockage conditions post-exercise (betaNon, betaCom) did not differ from one another (P > 0.05). The findings suggest beta-adrenergic blockage and competitive conditions enhance the exercise cortisol response. In combination, however, these conditions do not act in an additive fashion. This suggests that perhaps there may be two separate influences or mechanisms (i.e., excitatory, inhibitory) on the adrenergic control of adrenocortical function, or a sympathetic compensation for beta-blockage during exhaustive maximal exercise. Furthermore, the data suggests a possible \"ceiling\" on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to exercise in endurance-trained men.",

It has been proposed that nebivolol and carvedilol activate microvascular endothelium into producing NO by the release of extracellular ATP and subsequent stimulation of endothelial P(2) receptors. Here we tested this hypothesis in the coronary circulation of the isolated guinea pig heart. We analyzed the role of NO in the coronary vasodilatation induced by nebivolol and carvedilol as well as a possible involvement of extracellular ATP in these responses. Nebivolol and carvedilol (3-30 x 10(-6) M) induced a concentration-dependent coronary vasodilatation that was inhibited by NO-synthase inhibitor, L-NAME (10(-4) M). In contrast to nebivolol and carvedilol, neither atenolol nor labetalol acted as a coronary vasodilator. Vasodilatation induced by nebivolol and carvedilol was affected neither by the P(1) receptor antagonist, 8-sulfophenyl theophylline (8-SPT, 10(-5) M), nor by the P(2) receptor antagonist, suramin (10(-5) M). On the other hand, ATP-induced coronary vasodilatation (0.3-10 x 10(-6) M) was strongly inhibited by L-NAME (10(-4) M), partially inhibited by 8-SPT (10(-5) M), while suramin (10(-5) M) had a minor effect. In conclusion, in the isolated guinea pig heart nebivolol and carvedilol, but not their classical counterparts (atenolol, labelatol), act as NO-dependent coronary vasodilators. It seems unlikely that this response is mediated by the release of extracellular ATP.", 
    "56": "Plasma nitrite/nitrate levels reflect oxidation of formed nitric oxide (NO ) but are not indicative of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) function due to interference by dietary nitrates and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nitrosyl hemoglobin (NOHb), a metabolic product of nitric oxide, may better correlate with bioavailable NO but it may depend on the activity of different nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms and may be affected by dietary nitrite/nitrate. We examined the correlation between vascular endothelial NO release and circulating blood levels of NOHb. We measured NOHb in blood using electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometry and also quantified vascular production of NO using colloid Fe(DETC)(2) and ESR in mouse and human venous blood before and after treatment with the beta-blocker carvedilol. Exclusively the inhibition with L-NAME and not the treatment with the selective neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor, N-AANG or with the selective inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor, 1400W, halved NOHb formation, which reflects the complete inhibition of NO release by aortic endothelium. The relationship between NOHb and NO production by the endothelium (0.23 microM NOHb to 3.73 microM/hour of NO per mg of aorta dry weight) was found to be identical for both C57Blk/6 mice and for mice with vascular smooth muscle-targeted expression of p22phox associated with strong increase in eNOS activity. Furthermore, the treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases with carvedilol for 3 weeks increases up to 2 times the circulating NOHb concentration. These results demonstrate the important role of eNOS in the formation of circulating NOHb and suggest that NOHb can be used as a noninvasive marker of endothelial NO production in vivo.",

After awakening, inflammatory pain was induced by 10 microL of 5% formalin solution injected into the dorsal surface of the right hind paw. The nociceptive behaviours including licking, biting and lifting of the injected paw were cumulatively recorded as seconds of behaviours/min during phase I (0-10 min) and phase II (10-45 min). The c-Fos protein expressions in the spinal dorsal horn were detected with immunohistochemical techniques in the control and landiolol 750 microg.kg(-1) groups.",

    "65": "Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are widely used in cardiovascular medicine. However, the main side effect of these drugs is due to antagonism of beta(2)-adrenoceptors in the airways, resulting in bronchospasm. Therefore, more cardioselective beta-blockers have been developed to offer a lower side effect profile. We have studied a new aryloxypropanolamine derivative (PP-34) with more cardioselectivity and efficacy against ischaemia/reperfusion injury in rats. Oxalate salts of 1-(tert-butylamino)-3-(5-tert-butylaminomethyl-2-methoxyphenoxy) propan-2-ol (PP-34) is a novel beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. In-vitro studies in rat isolated right atria, guinea-pig trachea and rat distal colon preparations were carried out to investigate the potency of PP-34 towards different beta-adrenoceptor subtypes. pA(2)/pK(B) values of PP-34 for beta(1), beta(2), and beta(3) adrenoceptor were 7.89+/-0.15, 6.13+/-0.09 and 6.30+/-0.19, respectively. The beta(1)/beta(2) selectivity ratio calculated was in the order of PP-34 > atenolol > propranolol. Pre-ischaemic administration (20 min before coronary occlusion) of PP-34 (0.3 or 1 mg kg(-1)) showed cardioprotective effects against ischaemia/reperfusion injury in rats and significantly reduced arrhythmias, infarct area and necrosis induced by ischaemia/reperfusion injury. The efficacy of PP-34 was found to be greater then atenolol. In conclusion, PP-34 is a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, possessing potent anti-arrhythmic and cardioprotective effects against ischaemia/reperfusion injury in rats.", 
    "66": "Aerobic physical exercise is broadly recommended as a helpful adjunct to obtain blood pressure control in hypertension. Beta-blockade interacts with heart rate, sympathetic tone, maximal workload and local lactate production. In the present randomized-controlled study, we compared the cardiovascular effects of an endurance training programme in elderly hypertensives with or without beta-blockers and developed a first approach to determine a lactate-based training heart rate in presence of beta-blockade. Fifty-two patients (23 with beta-blocker, 29 without beta-blocker) > or =60 years with systolic 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) > or =140 mm Hg and/or antihypertensive treatment were randomly assigned to sedentary activity or a heart-rate controlled 12-week treadmill exercise programme (lactate 2.0 mmol/l). In the exercise group, the training significantly decreased systolic and diastolic 24-h ABP, blood pressure on exertion (100 W) and increased endothelium-dependent vasodilation (flow-mediated vasodilation, FMD) and physical performance both in the presence and absence of beta-blockade (P<0.05 each). The extent of ABP reduction did not significantly differ in the presence or absence of beta-blockade (Delta systolic ABP 10.6+/-10.5 vs 10.6+/-8.8 mm Hg, Delta diastolic ABP 5.7+/-8.6 vs 5.8+/-4.0 mm Hg). Mean training heart rate was significantly lower in the patients on beta-blockers (97.2+/-7.7 vs 118.3+/-7.5/min, P<0.001). Lactate-based aerobic endurance training evokes comparable cardiovascular benefits in the presence and absence of beta-blockade including a marked improvement of endothelial function. In the present study, target training heart rate with beta-blockers is about 18% lower than without.",

Most of the patients used a three-drug combination (36.8%), more rarely--two-drug (24.1%) or four-drug complex (19.8%). One drug was used only in 12.1% of cases; 7.2% of patients did not use any cardiac drugs. Beta-adrenoblocker with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was the most common (40.3%) used drug combination in patients on two drug complex. The combination of beta-adrenoblocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and antithrombotics was more frequently used in patients on three drug complex. The combination of two or three cardiac drugs with statin was used in several cases (1.6-10.3%).",

    "71": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of glycerol-induced acute renal failure (ARF) on the pharmacokinetics and hepatic extraction of metoprolol in rats. Experimental ARF in rats was induced by injections of 50% glycerol into the leg muscle (10 ml/kg). Pharmacokinetics and hepatic extraction of metoprolol was evaluated by means of intravenous, intra-intestinal, and intra-portal administration of the drug. The blood metoprolol concentration following intravenous infusion in ARF rats was similar to that in control rats. On the other hand, the blood metoprolol concentration at 5--10 min after intra-intestinal administration in ARF rats was significantly higher than that in control rats, and the oral clearance (CL/F) of the drug was significantly decreased in ARF rats. Hepatic extraction following intra-portal infusion was not altered by glycerol-induced ARF; however, hepatic first-pass extraction of metoprolol was dose-dependent and saturable in both ARF and control rats. These results suggested that the decreased CL/F of metoprolol in rats with glycerol-induced ARF is mainly a result of the increased initial absorption rate in the intestine followed by partial saturation of hepatic first-pass metabolism.",

The same tendency was found in the frequency of CYP2D6*5, though there was no significant difference. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the polymorphism on pharmacokinetics of carvedilol by population pharmacokinetic analysis. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using 373 plasma concentrations from 41 patients with chronic heart failure or angina pectoris. A one compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption (for oral dosing) was used to describe the concentration-versus-time data for carvedilol. We examined the effects of various clinical and genetic covariables in the regression models for clearance and volume of distribution. The results suggested that the factors of interindividual variation for carvedilol clearance were creatinine clearance and polymorphisms of UGT2B7 and CYP2D6 in the Japanese population with heart disease. It was estimated that UGT2B7*3 decreased the clearance of carvedilol by 37%, but UGT2B7*2 did not show any effect. Clearance in the patients who have intermediate activity of CYP2D6 was decreased by 39%.",

Results suggested that direct photolysis in optically dilute solutions followed pseudo first-order kinetics. The measured half-lives of propranolol, atenolol, and metoprolol were approximately 16, 350, and 630 h, respectively. These were 3-5 orders of magnitude slower than the estimated minimum half-lives. The measured half-lives were related to day light surface conditions by comparing the light intensity of the lamp and the sun at different latitudes and seasons. Major direct photolysis products were identified from propranolol that led to a proposed reaction pathway, involving ring oxidation, rearrangement, and deoxygenation. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy results confirmed that at least one carbon-based radical intermediate was formed during the direct photolysis of propranolol in aqueous solutions. The overall results demonstrated that with fast direct photolysis half-lives, propranolol is unlikely to be persistent in natural waters. Further work is needed to investigate indirect photolysis of atenolol and metoprolol in surface waters in order to understand the overall persistence of these APIs in the environment.", 
    "85": "Nebivolol is a novel beta1-blocker with a greater degree of selectivity for beta1-adrenergic receptors than other agents in this class and a nitric oxide (NO)-potentiating, vasodilatory effect that is unique among beta-blockers currently available to clinicians (nebivolol is approved in Europe and is currently under review in the US). A NO-potentiating agent such as nebivolol may have an important role in hypertensive populations with reduced endothelial function such as diabetics, African-Americans and those with vascular disease. Nebivolol is a racemic mixture with beta-blocker activity residing in the d-isomer; in contrast, l-nebivolol is far more potent in facilitating NO release. Nebivolol is unique among beta-blockers in that, at doses < 10 mg, it does not inhibit the increase in heart rate normally seen with exercise. The efficacy ofnebivolol has been tested successfully in clinical trials against other agents including other beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors and calcium channel antagonists in patients with hypertension, angina, and congestive heart failure. The tolerability of nebivolol has been shown to be superior to that of atenolol and metoprolol. In controlled clinical trials, nebivolol has a side effect profile that is similar to placebo, in particular as it relates to fatigue and sexual dysfunction.

Optimized patches (F4) showed satisfactory bioadhesive strength of 9.6 +/- 2.0 g, and ex vivo mucoadhesion time of 272 minutes. The surface pH of all patches was between 5.7 and 6.3 and hence patches should not cause irritation in the buccal cavity.

From a total sample of 944 women, we identified 158 women who were taking beta blockers and 341 age-matched women as controls. Bone geometry was investigated at the femoral neck on DXA images. Microarchitecture was evaluated by the H mean fractal parameter at the calcaneus.", 
    "109": "The odds ratio for fracture (at all sites) in the beta blocker users was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.30-0.99). beta blocker use was associated with a higher BMD at the femoral neck (+4.2%, p<0.05) and L1-L4 (+3.2%, p<0.05). Proximal femur scans revealed significantly higher cortical width (+3.6%, p<0.05) at the femoral neck under beta blockers. Femoral shaft measurement did not significantly differ under beta blockers. Medication use and lifestyle factors indicated no association between beta blockers and smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, corticosteroids and estrogen therapies.

    "111": "A high throughput and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method has been developed and validated for the estimation of bisoprolol in human plasma using multiplexing technique (two HPLC units connected to one MS). Bisoprolol was extracted from human plasma using solid-phase extraction technique using metoprolol as internal standard. A Betabasic 8 column provided chromatographic separation of analytes followed by detection with mass spectrometry. The mass transition ion-pair was followed as m/z 326.2-->116.1 for bisoprolol and m/z 268.2-->191.0 for metoprolol. The method involves a simple multiplexing, rapid solid-phase extraction, simple isocratic chromatography conditions and mass spectrometric detection which enable detection at sub-nanogram levels. The proposed method has been validated for a linear range of 0.5-70.0 ng/mL with correlation coefficient > or =0.9991. The precision and accuracy were within 10% for intra-HPLC runs and inter-HPLC runs. The overall recoveries for bisoprolol and metoprolol were 93.89% and 77.65%, respectively. Total MS run time was 0.90 min only. The developed method was applied for the determination of pharmacokinetic parameters of bisoprolol following a single oral administration of a 10mg bisoprolol tablet in 18 healthy male volunteers.", 
    "112": "1. Ischaemia-reperfusion injury is known to be associated with a range of functional and structural alterations in the liver. However, the effect of this injury on drug disposition is not well understood. The present study was designed to examine the effects of hypoxia/reperfusion on the disposition of glutamate and propranolol in the rat isolated perfused liver. Both glutamate and propranolol are mainly metabolised in the pericentral region of the liver. 2. Hypoxia/reperfusion was established using the slow flow-reflow method of perfusion in both anterograde and retrograde perfusion. Glutamate metabolism was measured by the recovery of [(14)C]-glutamic acid and [(14)C]-labelled metabolites in a single pass in both anterograde and retrograde perfusion in the presence of a steady state concentration of unlabelled glutamic acid. Propranolol disposition, mean transit time and normalized variance were assessed from the outflow concentration-time profile of unchanged [(3)H]-propranolol determined after a bolus injection of [(3)H]-propranolol using HPLC and liquid scintillation counting. 3. Hypoxia/reperfusion of livers did not affect oxygen consumption, but caused significant changes in enzyme release, lignocaine hepatic availability and bile flow. 4. Hypoxia/reperfusion did not affect the hepatic metabolism of glutamate to carbon dioxide or the hepatic extraction of propranolol. Small but significant changes were evident in the distribution parameters of mean transit time and vascular disposition for the hypoxic-ischaemic liver. 5. It is concluded that reperfusion injury induced by slow flow-reflow perfusion did not influence the extraction of glutamate or propranolol, but may have affected pericentral morphology and solute distribution.", 
    "113": "1. Hypertensive men treated with beta-blockers frequently complain of erectile dysfunction. The present study investigated the effects of two beta(1)-adrenoceptor-selective antagonists, namely nebivolol and metoprolol, on erectile function in hypertensive men. 2. Male out-patients (age range 40-55 years) with newly diagnosed or existing stage 1 essential hypertension (mean seated systolic blood pressure 140-159 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure 90-99 mmHg) were enrolled in the study. All patients lived in a stable, heterosexual partnership and had no history of sexual dysfunction. After a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients were randomized double-blind to either Treatment group A (comprising nebivolol 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks, followed by placebo for 2 weeks and then metoprolol succinate 95 mg once daily for 12 weeks) or Treatment group B (comprising metoprolol succinate 95 mg for 12 weeks, placebo for 2 weeks and then nebivolol 5 mg for 12 weeks). An international index of erectile function (IIEF) questionnaire and a diary documented patients' sexual function and activity. 3. Nebivolol and metoprolol lowered blood pressure to a similar extent. Metoprolol, but not nebivolol, significantly decreased the IIEF erectile function subscore by 0.92 in the first 8 weeks after onset of beta-blocker treatment. In contrast with metoprolol, nebivolol improved secondary sexual activity scores and other IIEF subscores. 4. Despite similar antihypertensive efficacy of the cardioselective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists nebivolol and metoprolol, nebivolol may offer additional benefits by avoiding erectile dysfunction in male hypertensive patients on long-term beta-adrenoceptor antagonist therapy.",

Among them, anti-beta 1 adrenoreceptor antibody (ARAb) had been proven to act as agonist on beta 1 adrenoreceptor and cause DCM. Cardiomyopathy is also serious problem in progressive muscular dystrophy (PMD). Because cardiac dysfunction is quite variable even in siblings sharing identical mutations, it is highly possible that there are some modifier factors. Thus, we measured ARAb in 93 patients with PMD and 11 patients with DCM to clarify immune function for cardiac impairment of PMD. The titer was abnormally elevated in 30.1% of PMD, 72.7% of DCM and 75.0% (9/12) of PMD patients with symptomatic cardiac failure. ARAb was weakly correlated to fractional shortening, brain natriuretic peptide, noradrenalin and severity of premature ventricular contractions (Lown grade). During the study period, four patients developed cardiac failure and ARAb was increased in all these patients. In DMD, although the patients receiving both beta blocker and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor showed worst cardiac function, the titers were rather low compared to patients with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor alone. Four of five patients initiating beta blocker showed decrease of ARAb. Autoantibodies for myocardium actually exist in PMD in certain ratio as is the case with DCM. It is highly possible that immune system plays some role in cardiac impairment even in PMD. We should pay enough attention to immune system to elucidate the mechanism of cardiac dysfunction and refine strategy of cardiac treatments.", 
    "119": "In most patients with hypertension, especially Stage 2 hypertension, adequate control of blood pressure (BP) is only achieved with combination drug therapy. When using combination therapy, antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action are recommended, for example, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), a beta-blocker + HCTZ, an ACE inhibitor + HCTZ, or a calcium channel blocker + an ACE inhibitor. One such combination is olmesartan medoxomil + HCTZ, which is available as fixed-dose, single-tablet combinations for once-daily administration. In clinical trials, olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ reduced systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) to a greater extent than either component as monotherapy. A clinical study in patients with Stage 1 or 2 hypertension showed that olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ achieved a similar mean reduction in DBP, but a significantly greater mean reduction in SBP and higher rate of BP control (< 140/90 mmHg) than observed with losartan/HCTZ, at US/European-approved starting doses. In a non-inferiority trial, the antihypertensive efficacy of olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ was comparable to that of atenolol/HCTZ. Furthermore, indirect comparisons have shown that olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ compares favorably with other antihypertensive combination therapies, including other ARB/HCTZ combinations and amlodipine besylate/ benazepril. Olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ is generally well tolerated. In conclusion, olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ is an effective and well-tolerated combination antihypertensive therapy that results in significant BP reductions and BP control in many patients.", 
    "120": "Olmesartan medoxomil is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. In pooled analyses of seven randomized, double-blind trials, 8 weeks' treatment with olmesartan medoxomil was significantly more effective than placebo in terms of the response rate, proportion of patients achieving target blood pressure (BP) and mean change from baseline in diastolic (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Olmesartan medoxomil had a fast onset of action, with significant between-group differences evident from 2 weeks onwards. The drug was well tolerated with a similar adverse event profile to placebo. In patients with type 2 diabetes, olmesartan medoxomil reduced renal vascular resistance, increased renal perfusion, and reduced oxidative stress. In several large, randomized, double-blind trials, olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg has been shown to be significantly more effective, in terms of primary endpoints, than recommended doses of losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, or candesartan cilexetil, and to provide better 24 h BP protection. Olmesartan medoxomil was at least as effective as amlodipine, felodipine and atenolol, and significantly more effective than captopril. The efficacy of olmesartan medoxomil in reducing cardiovascular risk beyond BP reduction is currently being investigated in trials involving patients at high risk due to atherosclerosis or type 2 diabetes.", 
    "121": "(1) When people who are physically dependent on alcohol stop drinking, they experience an alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms generally resolve spontaneously within a week, but more severe forms may be associated with generalised seizures, hallucinations and delirium tremens, which can be fatal. (2) We carried out a literature review in order to obtain answers to the following questions: how to predict or rapidly diagnose a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome; how to prevent and treat this syndrome; how to manage severe forms; and how to deal with the risk of vitamin B1 deficiency. (3) The main risk factors for severe withdrawal syndrome are: chronic heavy drinking; a history of generalised seizures; and a history of delirium tremens. (4) Anxiety, agitation, tremor, excessive sweating, altered consciousness and hallucinations are signs of a severe withdrawal syndrome. (5) Individual support and effective communication seem to reduce the risk of severe withdrawal syndrome. (6) Oral benzodiazepines are the best-assessed drugs for preventing a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly the risk of seizures. When given for a maximum of 7 days, the adverse effects are usually mild. (7) Clinical trials of other antiepileptics suggest they are less effective than benzodiazepines, and their addition to benzodiazepine therapy offers no tangible advantage. (8) Betablockers increase the risk of hallucinations, and clonidine increases the risk of nightmares, and the efficacy of these two drugs is not well documented. Neuroleptics increase the risk of seizures. There are no convincing data to support the use of magnesium sulphate or meprobamate (the latter carries a risk of serious adverse effects). Acamprosate, naltrexone and disulfiram are not beneficial in alcohol withdrawal. (9) Gradual withdrawal, i.e. ingestion of decreasing amounts of alcohol, has not been compared with other methods but is generally not recommended. (10) There are no specific recommendations on hydration. Note that excessive water-sodium intake carries a risk of pulmonary oedema in patients with heart disease. (11) As vitamin B1 deficiency is frequent and can lead to serious complications in alcohol-dependent patients, oral vitamin B1 supplementation is widely recommended, despite the absence of comparative trials. High doses must be used to compensate for poor absorption. Intravenous administration is best if patients have very poor nutritional status or severe complications such as Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy (a medical emergency), even though rare anaphylactic reactions have been reported after vitamin B1 injection. (12) Planned alcohol withdrawal in specialised hospital units has been extensively studied. Outpatient withdrawal may be more appropriate for patients who are at low risk of developing severe withdrawal syndrome. (13) A large proportion of alcohol-dependent patients were excluded from trials of withdrawal strategies. These include elderly patients, patients with serious psychiatric or somatic disorders, and patients who are also dependent on other substances. (14) An oral benzodiazepine is the best-assessed treatment for a single episode of generalised seizures or hallucinations during alcohol withdrawal. (15) In randomised comparative trials benzodiazepines were more effective than neuroleptics in preventing delirium-related mortality. Currently, with appropriate fluid-electrolyte support, continuous monitoring of vital signs, and respiratory support if necessary, the mortality rate for delirium tremens is under 3%. (16) In practice, patients who are attempting to stop drinking alcohol need close personal support and communication, and a reassuring environment, as well as regular monitoring for early signs of a withdrawal syndrome; the latter may require benzodiazepine therapy.",

Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography ruled out structural causes of migraines. The patient took 20 mg daily for five days and then decided, on her own, to decrease the dosage after experiencing insomnia, a common adverse effect of duloxetine. She opened the 20-mg capsules and took half of the contents to \"create\" the 10-mg dose, placing the contents of the opened capsule directly onto her tongue. She did this for two weeks and found the migraines to be significantly reduced in number and intensity. At that time, she began to experience what she described as a hot flash and facial flushing. The flushing was not accompanied by itching and did not spread beyond the face. The flushing occurred one to two hours after administering the 10-mg dose and typically resolved the following day. One week later, the patient noticed that the vessels in her face were more prominent. Concomitant therapies included pindolol for hypertension and duloxetine and botulinum toxin type A injections for migraines. The patient weaned herself off duloxetine. Facial flushing continued for one week after discontinuation of the drug. At a one-month follow-up visit, she stated that the flushing had resolved and not occurred since the original episodes.",

    "125": "Simple photoreceptors, namely photoresponsive neurons, designated as A-P-1, Es-1, Ip-2 and Ip-1, exist in the sea slug Onchidium ganglion. Previous works has shown that, of these, Ip-2 and Ip-1 respond to light with a hyperpolarizing receptor potential, caused by the opening of light-dependent, cGMP-gated K+ channels, whereas A-P-1 and Es-1 are depolarized by light, owing to the closing of the same K+ channels. The present study of Ip-2 or Ip-1 cells was undertaken to identify the G-proteins that couple light to the activation of guanylate cyclase (GC), thereby leading to the opening of K+ channels and the consequent hyperpolarizing photocurrents. The specific channel blocker, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and a GC inhibitor, LY-83583, both suppressed this hyperpolarizing photocurrent. N-ethylmaleimide and GDP-beta-S also inhibited this photocurrent, consistent with the involvement of G-proteins. Mastoparan an activator of both Go- and Gi-type G-proteins, induced an outward current. Furthermore, benzalkonium chloride (C(16)BAC), a selective activator of Go, dose-dependently generated an outward current similar to that induced by mastoparan. Both of these outward currents were susceptible to 4-AP, LY-83583 and N-ethylmaleimide. Taken together, these results suggest that phototransduction in Ip-2 or Ip-1 cells is triggered by a Go-type G-protein coupled to GC. Thus, this new cGMP cascade contrasts with the conventional phototransduction cGMP cascade mediated by the Gt-type G-protein coupled to phosphodiesterase, seen in the vertebrate photoreceptors and the above A-P-1 or Es-1 cells.", 
    "126": "About 5 million Americans suffer from heart failure. Given the correlation of heart failure with age and the rising life expectancy, the prevalence of heart failure continues to increase in the general population. Sympathetic stimulation intensifies with progressive heart failure. The rationale to use beta-blockers in individuals with impaired myocardial function is based on experimental evidence supporting the notion that prolonged alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation leads to worsening heart failure. Until recently, safety concerns have precluded the use of beta-blockers in patients with diabetes and heart failure. However, several large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials such as Metoprolol Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) have shown that beta-blockers can be safely used in patients with diabetes and heart failure. Moreover, beta-blockers significantly improved morbidity and mortality in this population. Based on this evidence, it is now recommended to add beta-blockers such as metoprolol CR/XL with an escalating dosage regimen to the treatment of patients with symptomatic heart failure who already are receiving a stable medical regimen including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, vasodilators, or digitalis.",

The positive inotropic effects of (-)-noradrenaline are blunted by phosphodiesterase4 (PDE4) but not PDE3, while both PDE isoenzymes, acting in concert, prevent the effects of (-)-CGP12177 through beta(1)-adrenoceptors in rat ventricle. We sought to unravel the role of PDE3 and PDE4 on signals through the H and L sites in human myocardium. The kinetics of matching positive inotropic effects of (-)-noradrenaline (20 nM) and (-)-CGP12177 (100 nM) were investigated on human atrial trabeculae in the absence and presence of the PDE3 inhibitor cilostamide (300 nM), PDE4 inhibitor rolipram (1 microM) or both. The influence of cilostamide and rolipram on agonist-evoked cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) increases were also compared in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing recombinant human beta1 -adrenoceptors. (-)-Noradrenaline and (-)-CGP12177 caused matching inotropic responses that faded during a 60-min time course. Cilostamide, but not rolipram, increased the positive inotropic effects and abolished the time dependent fade of both agonists. In CHO cells, rolipram, but not cilostamide, enhanced the cAMP signals caused by both (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-CGP12177. PDE3, but not PDE4, blunts the positive inotropic effects of both (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-CGP12177 through H and L sites, respectively, of human atrial beta1 -adrenoceptors. However, in CHO cells, PDE4 blunts the cAMP signals of both (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-CGP12177.

In 1,221 patients in the MADIT II, Q-wave MI was observed in 763 patients (62%), 115 (10%) had non-Q-wave MI, and 343 (28%) had conduction abnormalities. In patients with Q-wave MI, anterior MI was present in 430 (57%), inferior in 155 (20%), and combined in 178 (23%) patients. Study end points included all-cause mortality, hospitalization or death due to worsening congestive heart failure, and episodes of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation requiring implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy. In a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model predicting mortality, the following clinical variables entered the predictive model at a p value <0.10: treatment (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator vs conventional therapy), age dichotomized at 65 years, angina pectoris, ejection fraction dichotomized at 25%, serum urea nitrogen dichotomized at 25 mg/dl, and beta-blocker use. After adjustment for these covariates, risk of mortality was not significantly different in non-Q-wave MI versus Q-wave MI. However, when analyzing location of MI, inferior wall MI was associated with a significantly (hazard ratio 1.58, p = 0.048) higher risk of mortality than anterior wall MI. In addition, patients with conduction abnormalities had a higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio 1.36, p = 0.088) than patients with anterior wall MI.

Wistar rats of both sexes received daily doses of 20 mg/kg (i.p.) of an aqueous solution of stevioside or physiological solution (controls), then were narcotized with urethane and connected to the ECG apparatus for the first recording. The jugular vein was prepared and connected to an infusion pump to administer one of the drugs: adrenaline (0.1 mg/ml), verapamil (2.5 mg/ml) or metoprolol (1 mg/ml) to rats in both groups, while recording their ECGs. In the second part of the study, the animals were treated in the same way but instead of the stevioside solution received a single dose of 4 mg/kg of monoketocholic acid methyl ester (ME) or sodium salt of the same bile acid (MKHNa), 30 minutes before cardioactive drug infusion. The infusion rate of cardioactive drugs was 0.2 ml/min, except for verapamil (0.1 ml/min). The events observed on ECG recordings were the first myocardial reaction to drug infusion, the second longer-lasting reaction (observed as more extended extrasystoles, decrease in intensity of the QRS complex, or changes in heart rate frequency), and toxicity effect. In the control animals, adrenaline induced a decrease in heart rate frequency at a dose of 0.094 mg/kg, while with stevioside-pretreated rats this effect appeared significantly earlier (at a dose of 0.018 mg/kg). No toxic effect of adrenaline was observed, either in control or stevioside-pretreated group. Bile acids caused no changes in myocardial reaction to adrenaline. Only in the group of animals that received MKHNa, a significant decrease in the QRS complex was observed. Finally, the infusion of stevioside to intact animals at doses of 45 and 55 mg/kg caused no significant changes in the ECG patterns. The myocardial reaction to metoprolol remained unchanged in rats of all groups when compared with controls except for a mild decrease in heart rate frequency. Stevioside induced/produced a significant increase in myocardial sensitivity to verapamil, but no toxic effect was observed in any of the cases. A similar conclusion also holds for the interaction with MKHNa, whereas ME caused an increase in the toxicity of verapamil.",

A rapid coupling of Ca(2+) entry with BK channel activation is necessary for this to occur, which might result from an identified coupling of Ca(2+) entry through N-type Ca(2+) channels to BK channel activation. This selective coupling was extremely rapid and resistant to intracellular BAPTA, suggesting that the two channel types are close. Using reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation, we found that N-type channels were more abundantly associated with BK channels than L-type channels (Ca(V)1.2) in rat brain. Expression of only the pore-forming alpha-subunits of the N-type (Ca(V)2.2) and BK (Slo(27)) channels in a non-neuronal cell-line gave robust macroscopic currents and reproduced the interaction. Co-expression of Ca(V)2.2/Ca(V)beta(3) subunits with Slo(27) channels revealed rapid functional coupling. By contrast, extremely rare examples of rapid functional coupling were observed with co-expression of Ca(V)1.2/Ca(V)beta(3) and Slo(27) channels. Action potential repolarisation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons was slowed by the N-type channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA, but not by the L-type channel blocker isradipine. These data showed that selective functional coupling between N-type Ca(2+) and BK channels provided rapid activation of BK channels in central neurons.",

To assess changes of NT-proBNP during short term use of simvastatin in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and chronic systolic heart failure. Patients and methods. Statin naive patients (n=70) with coronary heart disease (CHD), NYHA class II-IV hart failure and LV ejection fraction (EF) 35% or less after correction of treatment and 1 month of stabilization on standard therapy were randomized to open simvastatin 40 mg/day (n=36) or no statin (n=34). In 65.1% of pts (65.6 and 64.5% in statin and control groups, respectively) beta-blockers were either initiated or their dose was corrected during <stabilization> phase of the study. Blood plasma lipids, NT-proBNP were measured and echocardiography carried out at randomization and in 4 months. Seven patients were not restudied and analysis included data from 32 (statin) and 31 (control) patients. Results. Baseline characteristics of groups were similar. Addition of statin to standard therapy was associated with lowering of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (-42%) and triglycerides (-14%). Changes of other parameters were similar in both groups including equal increases of NT-proBNP (from 540.9 to 1082.2 fmol/ml, p<0.0001, and from 639.6 to 1119.72 fmol/ml, p<0.0001, in control and simvastatin group, respectively). Baseline NT-proBNP correlated negatively with ejection fraction and positively with left ventricular dimensions, heart failure class and blood serum creatinine. The patients were followed for 1 year. Baseline NT-proBNP level was related to hospitalizations because of heart failure exacerbation during this year. Conclusion. In a group of patients with systolic heart failure due to CHD and trivial relationships between baseline NT-proBNP level and characteristics of heart failure severity short term simvastatin use caused expected LDLCH lowering but was associated with NT-proBNP increase equal to that observed in control group. Rise of NT-proBNP in both groups was probably related to activation of beta-blocker therapy.",

Considerable attention is now being afforded to the significant minority of patients who do not achieve early, complete myocardial reperfusion, despite restoration of adequate flow down the epicardial IRA.

Some epidemiological studies have found protective effects of beta-blockers on fracture risk. However, there is limited information on the association with cumulative dose and type of beta-blockers used. We conducted two case-control studies using data from the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD) and the Dutch PHARMO Record Linkage System (RLS). Cases were patients with a first hip or femur fracture; controls were individually matched on practice/region, gender, year of birth, and calendar time. Current use of beta-blockers was defined as a prescription in 90 days before the index date. We adjusted for medical conditions and drugs associated with falling or bone mineral density. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using conditional logistic regression analysis. The study population included 22,247 cases and controls in the GPRD and 6,763 cases and 26,341 controls in the PHARMO RLS. Current use of beta-blockers was associated with a reduced risk of hip/femur fracture in both the GPRD (adjusted OR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.74-0.91) and PHARMO RLS (adjusted OR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.95) study populations. However, this reduction of risk was not associated with cumulative dose, lipophilicity, or receptor selectivity of beta-blockers. The protective effect of beta-blockers was only present among patients with a history of use of other antihypertensive agents (GPRD adjusted OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.64-0.83; PHARMO RLS adjusted OR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.67-0.86) but not in patients using beta-blockers only (GPRD adjusted OR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.82-1.14; PHARMO RLS adjusted OR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.90-1.14). Also, in patients with a history of use of other antihypertensive agents, no dose-response relationship with beta-blocker use was found. The effect was constant with cumulative dose and the OR was below 1.0 even among patients who just started treatment with beta-blockers. As the mechanism by which beta-blockers could influence bone mineral density is likely to need some time to exert a clinically relevant effect, all these finding suggests that the association between beta-blockers and fracture risk is not causal.",

To assess the relative contribution of intrinsic cardiac and counterregulatory components to the overall response, infusions were repeated combined with a ganglionic blocker in the young groups. Epinephrine-induced increases in heart rate were similar in the four groups. Increases in stroke volume, ejection fraction, and cardiac index were similar in the two hypertensive and two young normotensive groups. In contrast, they were attenuated in the older normotensive group, resulting in higher left ventricular responses in older hypertensive than in normotensive subjects. Heart rate and left ventricular responses to epinephrine in the presence of ganglionic blockade did not differ between the two young groups. Increases in plasma norepinephrine due to epinephrine infusion were larger in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects.

Patients taking 50% or less of indicated medications at discharge had a significantly higher 2-year rate of death or myocardial infarction (8.0% versus 4.2%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 2.55; p = 0.013) than those taking all indicated medications.",

T-Wave alternans was performed using an atrial pacing protocol and interpreted using standard criteria. Beta-blocker status was determined based on oral beta-blocker use in the 24 hours preceding the test: beta-blocker (-) (n = 62), beta-blocker (+) (n = 325). Follow-up for ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and death was obtained from chart review, device interrogation, and the Social Security Death Index. Estimated sensitivity and specificity of TWA and EPS stratified by beta-blocker use were calculated based on event-free 2-year survival.",

Biological samples were extracted with tert-methyl-butyl ether, and the pindolol enantiomers were resolved on a Chiralpak AD column. Amniotic fluid/plasma and milk/plasma concentrations ratios ranged from 0.4 to 4.5 and from 0.6 to 3.7, respectively, for (+)-R-pindolol and from 0.5 to 3.5 and from 1.1 to 2.8, respectively, for (-)-S-pindolol. Preliminary data suggest that amniotic fluid and breast milk are routes of fetal exposure to pindolol enantiomers.", 
    "207": "Endomorphins (EMs), the endogenous, potent and selective mu-opioid receptor agonists, have been shown to decrease systemic arterial pressure (SAP) in rats after intravenous (i.v.) administration. In the present study, cardiovascular responses to intrathecal (i.t.) injection of EMs were investigated in urethane-anesthetized rats. It is noteworthy that EMs elicited decreases in SAP and heart rate (HR) in a dose-dependent manner; 10-300nmol/kg were injected intrathecally. Furthermore, these vasodepressor and bradycardic effects were significantly antagonized by naloxone (0.5mg/kg, i.t.). Interestingly, i.t. (5mg/kg) or i.v. (50mg/kg) administrations of N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methylester (l-NAME) attenuated the vasodepressor and bradycardic effects. Moreover, pretreatment of the rats with muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (2mg/kg, i.v.) and alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (1mg/kg, i.v.) significantly reduced the vasodepressor effects of EMs. Nevertheless, pretreatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (2mg/kg, i.v.) could only block the bradycardia effects induced by EMs, but had no significant effects on the hypotension. In summary, all the results suggested that i.t. administration of EMs decreased SAP and HR which were possibly mediated by the activation of opioid receptors in the rat spinal cord. In addition, nitric oxide (NO) release in both the spinal cord and in peripheral tissues might regulate the cardiovascular activities of EMs, and the muscarinic receptor and adrenoceptor played an important role in the regulation of the cardiovascular responses to i.t. administration of EMs.",

Of these, 15 IDC patients on standard heart failure therapy were studied prior to and at 1 and 6 months after initiation of carvedilol therapy and compared to the controls.", 
    "211": "There was significant mechanical dyssynchrony in IDC compared with control patients. Patients placed on carvedilol demonstrated a significant decrease in the inferoseptal to lateral wall delay in peak strain (normalized to the R-R interval) between baseline and 1 month and between baseline and 6 months. Similarly, global time to peak segmental strain (455 +/- 51 ms vs. 423 +/- 59 ms, respectively, p = 0.02, and 455 +/- 51 ms vs. 415 +/- 50 ms, respectively, p = 0.01) and the coefficient of variation of the time to peak segmental strain decreased (17 +/- 4% vs. 15 +/- 5%, respectively, p = 0.02, and 17 +/- 4% vs. 14 +/- 5%, respectively, p = 0.03), from baseline to 1 month and between baseline and 6 months, respectively.

    "213": "Leptin, a 16-kDa protein, is produced by white adipose tissue (WAT), and is thought to serve as a feedback signal indicating the size of fat stores. Considerable amount of data have shown that leptin can mediate lipid metabolism. However, its possible direct effects on the metabolism of lipids in vivo and the mechanisms involved have not been fully characterized. In this study, we investigated the in vivo effects of leptin on the autonomic nerve activity and lipolysis. We found that intravenous administration of leptin (10 microg/rat) excited the sympathetic nerves innervating WAT, and this effect was abolished by the pretreatment with diphenhydramine, a histamine H(1) receptor antagonist. Moreover, intraperitoneal administration of leptin (130 microg/kg) elevated the levels of plasma glycerol and free fatty acid (FFA). The effect of leptin on plasma FFA was eliminated by pretreatment with diphenhydramine and propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, and disappeared in suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)-lesioned rats. Our results suggest that leptin might regulate the lipolytic processes in adipose tissue through facilitation of the sympathetic nerves, driven by histamine neurons through the H(1) receptor, and a beta-adrenergic receptor, probably the beta(3)-receptor, is involved in the lipolytic response to leptin. The actions of leptin in this study are supposed to be controlled by the SCN.",

The mRNA levels of RANKL were increased by phenylephrine (alpha(1)-agonist) in time- and dose-dependent manners. Prazosin (alpha(1)-antagonist) suppressed the phenylephrine-induced RANKL mRNA expression, but yohimbine (alpha(2)-antagonist) and propranolol (beta-antagonist) did not. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, PKC activator) increased RANKL mRNA expression and GF109203X (PKC inhibitor) suppressed the phenylephrine-induced RANKL mRNA expression. Both phenylephrine and PMA stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK, while both prazosin and GF109203X inhibited phenylephrine-induced ERK activation. Pretreatment with PD98059 (ERK kinase inhibitor) inhibited both the phosphorylation of ERK and the expression of RANKL gene induced by phenylephrine in MC3T3-E1 cells.",

    "219": "In official doping controls, about 300 drugs and metabolites have to be screened for each sample. Moreover, the number of determinations to be routinely processed increases continuously as the number of both samples and potential illicit drugs keeps growing. As a consequence, increasingly specific, sensitive, and, above all, fast methods for doping controls are needed. The present study presents an efficient fast-GC/MS approach to the routine screening of two different classes of doping agents, namely beta-adrenoceptor ligands and diuretics (belonging to the S3, P2, and S5 groups of the WADA list of prohibited substances). Narrow bore columns (100 mm id) of different lengths and coated with apolar stationary phases were successfully used to separate the derivatized analytes; preliminary experiments (results not shown) showed better performances with OV-1701 for the separation of beta-adrenoceptor ligands. On the same stationary phase some diuretics required too high a temperature or a long isothermal time for elution, in which case a DB1-MS column was preferred. Two methods of sample preparation, derivatization, and analysis were used on aqueous standard mixtures of, respectively, (i) eight beta-adrenoceptor ligands, including five beta-antagonists (acebutolol, alprenolol, atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol) and three beta2-agonists (salbutamol, clenbuterol, terbutaline) and (ii) seventeen diuretic drugs (acetazolamide, althiazide, bendroflumethiazide, bumethanide, canrenone, chlorothiazide, chlortalidone, clopamide, ethacrinic acid, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, hydroflumethiazide, indapamide, indomethacine, spironolactone, triamterene, trichloromethiazide) and one masking agent (probenecid). The mixture of beta-adrenoceptor ligand derivatives was efficiently separated in about 5.6 min, while the one of 18 diuretics and masking agents required less than 5 min for analysis. Limits of detection were from 1 microg/L for pindolol, ethacrinic acid, furosemide, indomethacine, and trichloromethiazide, to 20 microg/L for terbutaline, salbutamol, and metoprolol, and 50 microg/L for clopamide; the instrumental repeatability proved to be excellent (area RSD% <2 for almost all analytes). For this work a quadrupole MS with inert ion source has been used, demonstrating that the quadrupole technology is perfectly adequate to provide precise integration of 400 ms-wide GC peaks.", 
    "220": "The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that administration of thyroid hormone [3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T(3))] could result in oxidation of myofibrillar proteins and, in turn, induce alterations in respiratory muscle function. Daily injection of T(3) for 21 days depressed isometric forces of diaphragm fiber bundles across a range of stimulus frequencies (1, 10, 20, 40, 75, and 100 Hz) (P < 0.05). These reductions in force production were accompanied by a remarkable increment (104%; P < 0.05) in carbonyl groups of myofibrillar proteins. In contrast, T(3) treatment has no effects on the carbonyl content in myosin heavy chain. In additional experiments, we have also tested the efficacy of carvedilol, a nonselective beta(1)- beta(2)-blocker that possesses antioxidative properties. Treatment with carvedilol dramatically improved isometric tetanic force production at stimulus frequencies from 40 to 100 Hz (P < 0.05). Carvedilol also prevented T(3)-induced contractile protein oxidation (P < 0.05). These data suggest that the oxidative modification of myofibrillar proteins may account, at least in part, for an impairment of diaphragm in hyperthyroidism.", 
    "221": "beta-Blockers are used to treat high blood pressure as well as patients recovering from heart attacks. In several studies, they were detected in surface water, thus indicating incomplete degradability of these substances in sewage treatment plants (STPs). In this study, we determined the sorption coefficients (K(D)) and degradation rates of the four beta-blockers sotalol, atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol in sludge from an STP operating with municipal wastewater. The sorption coefficients (K(D), standard deviations in brackets) were determined as 0.04(+/-0.035), 0.04(+/-0.033), 0.00(+/-0.023) and 0.32(+/-0.058) Lg(-1)(COD), and the pseudo-first-order degradation rate constants were estimated to be 0.29(+/-0.02), 0.69(+/-0.05), 0.58(+/-0.05) and 0.39(+/-0.07) Ld(-1)g(-1)(COD) for sotalol, atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol, respectively. These values translate into a typical elimination in STPs (sludge concentrations of 4g(COD)L(-1) and a hydraulic retention time of 6h) of 25%, 37%, 44% and 50% for sotalol, propranolol, metoprolol and atenolol, respectively. These results are also confirmed by measurements in two municipal STPs for atenolol, sotalol and propranolol. The estimated eliminations are slightly too high for metoprolol.", 
    "222": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a pivotal role in diabetic retinopathy (DR) and hypertension has been identified as an independent risk factor for DR. The aim of the present study was to: (1) explore whether beta-adrenergic blockers influence retinal VEGF expression; (2) determine the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) on retinal VEGF expression independently of their anti-hypertensive actions; and (3) investigate the correlation between retinal VEGF expression and changes in retinal capillary basement membrane thickness (BMT). Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and control animals were assigned at random to receive the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol, the ACEI fosenopril sodium, or vehicle for 24 weeks. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to assess VEGF protein and mRNA expression. Computer-assisted morphometric measurements of transmission electron microscopy photographs were performed to evaluate BMT. Vitreous fluid and retinal VEGF protein and retinal VEGF mRNA expression were significantly higher in diabetic rats than in control rats, with a significant reduction in fosenopril sodium-treated diabetic rats (p<0.01). There was no significant difference in VEGF levels in diabetic rats and propranolol-treated diabetic rats (p>0.05), but there was a significant difference in VEGF protein and mRNA expression in propranolol-treated diabetic rats and fosenopril sodium-treated diabetic rats (p<0.01) without any significant difference in systolic blood pressure in the latter two groups (p>0.05). There was a significant correlation between the level of retinal VEGF expression and changes in retinal BMT (p<0.01). These findings suggest that the effect of ACEI on retinal VEGF expression is independent of their anti-hypertensive actions and that ACEI could offer particular benefits beyond blood pressure reduction in the treatment of DR with or without hypertension. beta-adrenergic blockers had no influence on retinal VEGF expression in normal or diabetic rats.", 
    "223": "Molecular imaging has been focused in the field of cardiovascular medicine. With use of suitable radiopharmaceuticals, neuronal function in the cardiovascular system has been assessed in vivo. Of particular, positron emission tomography(PET) plays an important role for in vivo quantification of various neurotransmitter and receptor functions. We have recently developed 11C-labeled CGP12177, hydrophilic beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist, to measure myocardial beta-receptor density(Bmax) in vivo. The basic study showed high uptake in the lung and myocardium which was significantly suppressed by propranolol pretreatment in the rat model, suggesting specific binding of this ligand in the beta-receptors. Bmax was significantly reduced in patients with congestive heart failure. In addition, Bmax was inversely correlated with washout rate of 123I-MIBG from the myocardium in these patients. These new imaging technique has a potential role for assessing severity of heart failure and providing appropriate treatment strategy.", 
    "224": "Recent-onset noncompaction of the myocardium is a rare but serious entity with uncertain prognosis. Cerebral infarction is among the forms of presentation, and pregnancy and hypercoagulability increase risk. We report the case of a pregnant woman brought to the emergency department with ischemic cerebral infarction. Investigation demonstrated the cause to be cardiac embolism, and noncompaction of the myocardium was diagnosed. She was stabilized and a few days later underwent elective cesarean section under general anesthesia. Surgery and postoperative recovery were uneventful, and she was transferred for rehabilitation. Myocardial injury and progression to cerebrovascular accident must be prevented in such cases; the patient must be stabilized and antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy initiated before surgery. Hemodynamic stability must be maintained throughout the perioperative period and neonatal depression avoided after delivery. Various approaches are available to be adapted to the patient's situation."
