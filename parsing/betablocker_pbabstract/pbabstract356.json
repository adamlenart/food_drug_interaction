    "0": "Although initial patient response to timolol maleate in Gelrite (Timoptic XE) has been generally favorable in clinical settings, anecdotal reports of blurred vision warrant further investigation comparing the tolerability of this new formulation with that of timolol maleate in conventional solution.", 
    "1": "A prospective, double-masked, randomized, cross-over study was performed using 28 normal volunteers who had no evidence of ocular disease, including glaucoma. Mean subject age was 32.5 years. Subjects were randomized to receive one drop in each eye of either timolol maleate in solution (TS) 0.5 percent or timolol maleate in Gelrite (TXE) 0.5 percent. Subjects rated each medication, using a visual analog scale, at the following time intervals: prior to drug instillation, immediately following instillation, 1 min, and at 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours.", 
    "2": "Wilcoxon Matched Paris Test showed statistically significant differences at 1 minute for tearing (p = 0.003), blurred vision (p = 0.001) and drug acceptance (p = 0.028) in favor of TS. At 15 minutes and thereafter, however, none of the differences between groups was significant. Visual acuities were unaffected by either TS or TXE.", 
    "3": "These data suggest that TXE may impair visual function more than TS, but these effects are briefly and transitory. TXE appears to be a clinically acceptable drug delivery vehicle for use during the young glaucoma patient's waking hours.", 
    "4": "The effects of bunazosin and atenolol on serum lipids and lipoproteins after 6 months of treatment were compared in this multicentric, double-blind, randomised trial. A total of 174 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension from 15 hospitals in Germany and Poland was included in the study. Eighty-seven were treated with the alpha-receptor blocker bunazosin and the same number with the beta-blocker atenolol. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly in both groups, whereas only atenolol decreased pulse rate. In the bunazosin group HDL-cholesterol was significantly increased after 6 months of treatment, whereas all other analysed parameters remained unchanged. In the atenolol group total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, total triglycerides, apolipoprotein E, VLDL-cholesterol and VLDL-triglycerides were significantly increased after 6 months of therapy. There was a significant difference between bunazosin and atenolol for total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, VLDL-triglycerides and apolipoprotein B levels. As a consequence, there was a significant difference in the atherogenic index of both groups. We conclude that bunazosin is favorable in the treatment of high blood pressure, because the coronary risk is not negatively influenced as shown for atenolol.", 
    "5": "In this study, we explored the possible mechanism of cooling-induced relaxation of the isolated guinea-pig trachea. A rapid cooling (-4 degrees C/min) from 37 +/- 0.5 degree C to 25 +/- 0.5 degree C induced a transient and small contraction followed by a sustained cooling-relaxation. This relaxation was not blocked by propranolol or tetrodotoxin. Various concentrations of four contractile agonists (histamine, carbachol, 5-HT and ryanodine) all enhanced cooling-relaxation in a concentration-dependent manner which correlated well with their increase in the developed muscular tension, suggesting an inherent counterbalance between cooling-relaxation and the bronchoconstriction. Treating with either indomethacin or nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) did not affect the contractile properties of histamine, carbachol and 5-HT except ryanodine, but reversed cooling-relaxation into sustained cooling-contraction. Indomethacin partially inhibited but NDGA abolished cooling-relaxation induced by ryanodine. Moreover, ryanodine, but not the other three contractile agonists, could antagonize indomethacin in inducing cooling-contractions by various agonists. From above findings, we can conclude that eicosanoids including prostaglandins particularly leukotrienes, which would be produced by the elevated Ca(2+)-release from the ryanodine sensitive Ca(2+)-store, play prominent roles in inducing cooling-relaxation.", 
    "6": "The safety and ocular hypotensive efficacy of twice-daily administration of brimonidine 0.2% solution or betaxolol 0.25% suspension were compared in subjects with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. A total of 206 adult patients were enrolled in a prospective, 3-month, multicentered, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group study. Both drugs significantly (p < 0.001) reduced peak and trough intraocular pressure (IOP) at every scheduled follow-up visit over the 3-month study. At peak, the overall mean decrease from baseline IOP was greater (p = 0.004) in the brimonidine-treated group (5.8 mm Hg) than in the betaxolol-treated group (3.8 mm Hg). At trough, the overall mean decrease from baseline (p < 0.001) was 3.9 mm Hg in the brimonidine-treated group and 3.2 mm Hg in the betaxolol-treated group. The IOP-lowering effect of brimonidine was sustained throughout the 3-month study period. Terminations from the study due to lack of efficacy included 2.9% (3/103) of patients in the brimonidine group and 4.2% (4/96) of those in the betaxolol group. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups, with the only significant (p = 0.027) between-group difference being that ocular blurring was reported more often by patients receiving betaxolol suspension than by those receiving brimonidine treatment. Instillation of drug was reported to be comfortable (p = 0.036) by more brimonidine-treated patients than betaxolol-treated patients. Overall, brimonidine 0.2% solution was well-tolerated, safe and clinically and statistically more effective than betaxolol 0.25% suspension in lowering intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.", 
    "7": "The ocular hypotensive efficacy and safety of brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, a highly selective alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, was compared with that of timolol 0.5%, a nonselective beta-blocker in two multicenter, randomized, double-masked studies. Combined data from a 12-month completed study and 6-month interim data from an ongoing study are reported. Efficacy and safety were evaluated at baseline, weeks 1 and 2, and months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at peak (2 hours after the morning dose) and trough (12 hours after the evening dose). Patients (n = 926) instilled either brimonidine tartrate 0.2% or timolol maleate 0.5% twice daily. At peak, the mean decreases from baseline IOP ranged from 5.9 +/- 3.2 mm Hg to 7.6 +/- 3.6 mm Hg for brimonidine and 6.0 +/- 3.4 mm Hg to 6.6 +/- 3.6 mm Hg for timolol (p < 0.001 within groups compared with baseline). No significant between-group differences were seen at peak except for weeks 1 and 2 and month 3 (p < or = 0.04), when brimonidine had lower mean IOP. At trough the mean decreases from baseline ranged from 3.7 +/- 4.0 mm Hg to 5.0 +/- 3.0 mm Hg for brimonidine and 5.9 +/- 3.4 to 6.6 +/- 3.0 for timolol. A significant between-group difference was seen at trough at all visits (< 0.001), when timolol had a lower mean IOP. Brimonidine and timolol showed sustained efficacy. Both drugs were well-tolerated. The brimonidine group had more ocular allergy, oral dryness and conjunctival follicles. The timolol group had more burning and stinging. In the brimonidine group, 38/513 (7.4%) discontinued treatment due to ocular allergy. The timolol group had significantly lower mean heart rate compared to baseline. The effect on blood pressure was minimal for both drugs. Brimonidine showed efficacy similar to timolol and a relatively low rate of ocular allergy. Brimonidine 0.2% administered twice daily is an effective and safe ocular hypotensive agent that maintains IOP-lowering in chronic use.", 
    "8": "It is well established now that adrenocortical function, besides being regulated through systemic factors, is influenced by intra-adrenal mechanisms. In this context paracrine influences between the sympathoadrenal system and the adrenal cortex play an important role. As a prerequisite for these interactions, adrenal medullary cells and cortical cells are highly interwoven as revealed by immunohistochemistry. The potential role of VIP in the regulation of human adrenal steroidogenesis was now investigated in human adrenal cells in primary culture. The primary cultures contained both, cortical and chromaffin cells which were found to be in close cellular contact as revealed by immunocytochemistry. VIP enhanced cortisol secretion from adrenal cells in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal effect at 10(-7) M. VIP stimulated the release of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone, androstenedione, and aldosterone significantly. The addition of propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, to the incubation medium attenuated VIP-induced corticosteroid secretion. It is concluded that VIP is a paracrine messenger in the human adrenal that could regulate adrenocortical function at least in part via catecholamines released from the medulla.", 
    "9": "Nipradilol is a new type of beta-blocker which possesses nitroglycerin-like vasodilating action in addition to beta-blocking action. We investigated the efficacy and safety of nipradilol for treating tremor in 20 patients with essential tremor (ET group) and 20 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD group). All patients received nipradilol (6 mg per day) for more than 8 weeks. Improvement of tremor appeared within 2 or 4 weeks after the start of nipradilol therapy, and the efficacy rate, defined as \"moderately effective\" or over, was 42.5% in all 40 patients, while that defined as \"slightly effective\" or over was 87.5%. The efficacy rate tended to be higher in the ET group compared with the PD group. Mean blood pressure was significantly decreased from the 4th week after the start of treatment and heart rate was significantly reduced from the 2nd week of treatment. Laboratory examination showed no significant changes.", 
    "10": "The purpose of the present study is to test the possibility that oleic acid might increase the permeability of buccal mucosa and thereby facilitate transmucosal drug delivery. Propranolol, a commonly used beta-blocking agent, was chosen as the model drug, and propylene glycol was chosen as a vehicle in which both propranolol and oleic acid are soluble. The flux of propranolol through porcine tissue mounted in perfusion chambers is monitored by ultraviolet spectroscopy. It is found that oleic acid in propylene glycol increases both the initial flux and the flux at steady state. With oleic acid concentrations in the range of 1 through 10%, there was a 3- to 4-fold increase in permeability to propranolol as judged by changes in permeability constant (KP) values. Oleic acid and propranolol also led to a virtual elimination of the lag time and a maximum drug flux exceeding that at steady state within 2 hours. Similar results were obtained with methyl oleate. Oleic acid has a cis double bond between carbons 9 and 10 in an 18-carbon chain, and it is thought that this double bond fluidizes membranes in the outer portion of the epithelium. This effect on membrane fluidity can account for the increase in KP. The effect of oleic acid in propylene glycol on the initial drug flux is mechanistically more complex and is though to be related to changing thermodynamic activity of the drug as water is displaced by propylene glycol in the tissue. Taken together, the present results indicate that permeability enhancement for the purpose of drug delivery through oral mucosa is feasible.", 
    "11": "We have examined the 4-hydroxylation of bunitrolol in rabbit and rat liver microsomes. Significant species differences (rabbit < rat of both sexes) and sex (male > female of both species) were observed in the formation of 4-hydroxybunitrolol from racemic bunitrolol (10 microM). The 4-hydroxylation of bunitrolol racemate and enantiomers showed biphasic kinetics, a low-Km system and a high-Km system, in liver microsomes from rabbits of both sexes. There were significant differences in Km and Vmax values [(+) > (-)] for 4-hydroxylations of (+)-bunitrolol and (-)-bunitrolol in the low-K(m) system. Furthermore, the rate of clearance (Vmax/Km) was 20- to 200-fold for the low-Km system compared with the high-Km system, indicating that enzymes in the low-Km system play a major part in the rabbit liver microsomal bunitrolol metabolism. Inhibition studies using cytochrome P450 inhibitors such as quinidine, quinine, and alpha-naphthoflavone or polyclonal antibodies raised against rat P450-2D and -1A enzymes did not make clear which P450 enzymes are involved in bunitrolol 4-hydroxylation in rabbit liver microsomes. The 4-hydroxylase activity of (+)-bunitrolol was slightly higher than that of (-)-bunitrolol in separated incubations containing male rabbit liver microsomes and an enantiomer concentration of 10 microM. However, the 4-hydroxylation of (+)-bunitrolol (10 microM) was markedly suppressed in the presence of its antipode (10 microM), whereas (-)-bunitrolol 4-hydroxylation was not affected by the presence of its antipode, resulting in a change of the stereoselectivity from (+) > (-) for enantiomer to (+) < (-) for racemate. The difference in the Michaelis constants in the low-Km system, where the Km value of (-)-bunitrolol is one-eighth that of (+)-bunitrolol, is thought to cause the change in the stereoselectivity in rabbit liver microsome-mediated bunitrolol 4-hydroxylation.", 
    "12": "This study analyses the relaxation induced by the hydroalcoholic extract of stems, leaves and roots from Phyllanthus urinaria (Euphorbiaceae) in the guinea-pig trachea (GPT) pre-contracted by carbachol. The hydroalcoholic extract of P. urinaria (0.1-10 mg mL-1) caused a graded relaxation in GPT with or without epithelium, with mean EC50 values of 1.94 (1.41-2.67) and 2.00 (1.47-2.78) mg mL-1 and Emax of 717 mg (+/- 16) and 627 mg (+/- 12), respectively. The relaxation in response to hydroalcoholic extract, like that to cromakalim (EC50 3.57 (2.75-4.64 microM) in GPT without epithelium, was fully abolished in the presence of high KCl concentrations (80 mM), and was significantly attenuated by tetraethylammonium (10 or 30 mM) or glibenclamide (0.1 or 3 microM). However, the relaxation caused by the hydroalcoholic extract was unaffected by apamin (0.1 or 1.0 microM), nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG, 100 microM), methylene blue (10 microM) or by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) (8-37) (a CGRP antagonist, 0.1 microM). Both propranolol (1 or 3 microM) and [D-p-Cl-Phe6,Leu17]VIP (a vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptor antagonist, 0.1 microM) produced a significant displacement to the right (about 2-fold) of the relaxation response to hydroalcoholic extract of P. urinaria. Thus, the present results indicate that the ATP-activated potassium channels sensitive to glibenclamide, but not the small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels sensitive to apamin, largely contribute to the relaxation effect of the hydroalcoholic extract of P. urinaria in GPT. In addition, both beta 2 and VIP-mediated responses seem to account, at least in part, for the relaxation effect of the hydroalcoholic extract, as its relaxant response was partially attenuated by both propranolol and VIP receptor antagonist.", 
    "13": "The perforated patch technique was used to study the effects of hypotonic extracellular solutions on membrane potential and whole-cell currents in intact rat pancreatic beta-cells. A 30% reduction in osmolarity resulted in activation of an outwardly rectifying CI(-)-selective conductance in rat beta-cells. This conductance was inhibited by the anion channel blocker 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (DIDS). Exposure to a hypotonic medium also led to a transient stimulation of electrical activity accompanied by cell swelling and a gradual return towards control volume. These effects were also associated with the generation of an inward current at a holding potential of -70mV, and a stimulation of insulin release from intact perifused islets. All of the above effects were inhibited by DIDS. It is suggested that the stimulation of insulin release by hypotonic solutions results from activation of a volume-sensitive anion conductance generating an inward current and leading to a subsequent depolarization of the beta-cell.", 
    "14": "Brain catecholamines have been implicated in the regulation of gonadotrophin release. It has been recently reported that noradrenaline (NA), applied within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, suppresses the pulsatile release of LH in the rat through a corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH)-dependent mechanism. Prolactin (PRL) is also able to suppress hypothalamic GnRH release following activation of the CRH-releasing neurone. Given that PRL stimulates the release of NA from hypothalamic explants and that NA stimulates the release of hypothalamic CRH, we hypothesized that this neurotransmitter may be involved in the intrahypothalamic neuroendocrine circuit mediating the inhibitory effects of PRL on GnRH release. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of PRL on GnRH release in the presence of alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists using a static hypothalamic organ culture system which enabled us to evaluate immunoreactive GnRH (iGnRH) release from individually incubated, longitudinally halved hypothalami. As previously shown, PRL at a concentration of 100 nM inhibited basal iGnRH release by about 35%. Phentolamine, a non-selective alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist, prazosin, an alpha 1-receptor antagonist, and yohimbine, an alpha 2-receptor antagonist, overcame the inhibitory effect of PRL on iGnRH release in a concentration-dependent fashion. In contrast, propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, atenolol, a beta 1-receptor antagonist, and ICI-118,551, a beta 2-receptor antagonist, had no effect. None of these compounds had any effect on basal iGnRH release. These findings suggested that an alpha-adrenergic mechanism is involved in the suppressive effects of PRL on GnRH release. Since the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors increases hypothalamic CRH release, we evaluated whether PRL stimulates CRH release via an alpha-adrenergic mechanism. PRL stimulated basal CRH release by about twofold and this effect was inhibited by phentolamine in a concentration-dependent fashion. In conclusion, alpha-, but not beta-, adrenergic receptors mediate the inhibitory effects of PRL on GnRH release in vitro. We speculate that, at least under these experimental conditions, PRL inhibits GnRH release through an alpha-adrenergic mechanism which activates the CRH-secreting neurone.", 
    "15": "In 1962 propranolol, the first beta adrenoceptor antagonist (beta blocker), was brought on to the market. There is now a host of different beta blockers available, and these compounds are among the most commonly prescribed groups of drugs. The efficacy of beta blockers has been proven predominantly for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Beta blockers are also used for certain types of CNS disorders, such as anxiety disorders, essential tremor and migraine. While low toxicity means that they have a favorable risk-benefit ratio, given the high intensity of use, it is essential to have a comprehensive knowledge of adverse events. Adverse events of beta blockers that can be related to the CNS are quite often neglected, even in textbooks of clinical pharmacology or review articles, and thus often misdiagnosed. The following article, therefore, after summarizing the use of beta blockers for CNS indications, critically reviews the literature on centrally mediated adverse events. General pharmacological features of beta blockers and their molecular basis of action will briefly be addressed to the extent that they are or may become relevant for central nervous pharmacotherapy and side-effects.", 
    "16": "It is recognized that heart failure in patients with atherosclerotic lesion is the result of ischemia. However, there may also be cardiac cell dysfunction independent of ischemia, as factors advancing both of atherosclerosis and heart failure are discovered. The renin-angiotensin system is one of factor and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) prevents progression of atherosclerotic lesion and heart failure. To elucidate the association of atherosclerosis and cardiac cell dysfunction, we investigated the effects of ACEi on cultured cardiac myocytes. Captopril increased beta-receptor density of myocytes and augmented the response to isoproterenol. CV-3480, a ACEi, also up-regulated beta-receptors but angiotensin I, angiotensin II and angiotensin type I receptor antagonist did not. Bradykinin B2 receptor blocker, HOE140, suppressed the effect of captopril on cultured cells. The results suggest that ACEi up-regulated beta-receptors and augmented the response to beta-receptor agonist through BK potentiation.", 
    "17": "Treatment of hyperthyroidism in those neonates born to mothers with Grave's disease is difficult. Calcium ipodate, an agent for oral cholecystography, inhibits extra-thyroid conversion of T3 to T4 and diminishes thyroid secretion.", 
    "18": "Two neonates with clinical manifestations and biological findings of hyperthyroidism were given calcium ipodate orally, 400 mg every 3 days, from day 26 to 50 for the first patient and from day 9 to 18 for the second in association with a beta blocker. Clinical manifestations disappeared within 2 days and circulating levels of T3 and T4 were normalized within 2-5 days.", 
    "19": "This treatment was effective and well-tolerated in both patients and in three others previously reported; it should be confirmed in a larger number of patients and controlled by measuring levels of antibodies directed against thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptors in order to avoid relapse after cessation of treatment as seen in our second patient.", 
    "20": "A rapid and simple reversed-phase micellar liquid chromatographic procedure for the simultaneous determination of the beta-blockers atenolol, metoprolol and oxprenolol, the diuretics amiloride, bendroflumethiazide, chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide and the vasodilator hydralazine in pharmaceuticals, is proposed. An interpretive optimization procedure, which uses the chromatographic data for only five mobile phases, was applied to select a suitable micellar mobile phase. A comparative study was also made of the performance of micellar and aqueous-organic mobile phases in the analysis of pharmaceuticals that combine beta-blockers and diuretics. The determination of all the drugs could be made with a micellar mobile phase of 0.15 mol l-1 sodium dodecyl sulfate and 7% propanol in 0.01 mol l-1 phosphate buffer at pH 3, with retention times below 20 min, whereas two different aqueous-organic mobile phases were needed to make the same analyses.", 
    "21": "1. We investigated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of (+/-)-sotalol administered orally to healthy male volunteers in single doses of 40, 80 and 160 mg and in multiple doses of 80 mg twice daily for 7 consecutive days. 2. In the single dose studies, the half-life of (-)-sotalol (7.2-8.5 h) was significantly (P < 0.01) shorter than that of (+)-sotalol (9.1-11.4 h) while the renal clearance of (-)-sotalol (110.6-126.4 ml min-1) was significantly (P < 0.01) faster than that of (+)-sotalol (102.2-110.1 ml min-1). In the multiple dose studies, similar differences in the pharmacokinetics of (+)- and (-)-sotalol were observed. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of both (+)- and (-)-sotalol on day 4 were shown to be essentially the same as those on day 7. 3. In pharmacodynamic examinations, (+/-)-sotalol prolonged QTc intervals on electrocardiograms dose-dependently after single doses of 80 and 160 mg (3.81 +/- 2.96%, 13.23 +/- 5.66%). The correlation between the plasma concentration of (+/-)-sotalol and prolongation of QTc intervals was nearly linear, and showed no hysteresis. 4. In conclusion, we demonstrated that QTc interval was prolonged with a linear correlation to the plasma concentration of (+/-)-sotalol. In addition, our study suggested that differences in the pharmacokinetics of (+)- and (-)-sotalol may be attributable to faster urinary excretion of (-)-sotalol.", 
    "22": "The stereoselectivity in 4-hydroxylation of bunitrolol (BTL), a beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent, was examined in liver microsomes from monkeys (marmosets and Japanese monkeys) and compared with the results of human liver microsomes. The formation of (+)-4-OH-BTL from (+)-BTL from (+)-BTL was significantly higher than that of (-)-4-OH-BTL from (-)-BTL in the liver microsomal fractions from the two kinds of monkeys. The 4-OH-BTL-forming activity from racemic BTL was significantly lower than from enantiomeric BTL, indicating a possible metabolic interaction between BTL enantiomers. The in vitro profiles observed in the monkeys were very similar to those in humans, but the stereoselectivity in BTL metabolism [(+)-BTL > (-)-BTL] in the primates was found to be reverse to that in rats [S. Narimatsu et al., Anal. Biochem., 222, 256-261 (1994)]. The 4-OH-BTL-forming activity from BTL enantiomers was significantly suppressed by quinidine and quinine, while the former was more potent than the latter, and also by alpha-naphthoflavone. Furthermore, the activity was also suppressed by antisera against rat cytochromes P450-2D2 and -1A2 in concentration-dependent manners. However, kinetics showed that enantiomeric BTL 4-hydroxylation was monophasic in liver microsomes from marmosets of both genders and from male Japanese monkeys. These results suggest that cytochrome P450-2D and -1A enzymes with similar Km values are involved in BTL 4-hydroxylation in monkey liver microsomes.", 
    "23": "Mechanisms of the stimulatory release of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity from isolated rat fat pads by sodium orthovanadate (vanadate) were studied through a cAMP-dependent process. A potent inhibitor of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, quercetin, inhibited the vanadate-increasing effect on the LPL activity in fat pads, but did not inhibit the vanadate-stimulated release of LPL activity from the fat pads. Propranolol and N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H-8) decreased the vanadate-stimulated release in a dose-dependent manner. Isoproterenol and dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) stimulated the release of LPL activity from fat pads. Vanadate, as well as isoproterenol, rapidly increased the cAMP content in fat pads, and this increase was almost completely inhibited by propranolol. Vanadate increased the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity ratios calculated from the measurement in the presence or absence of cAMP or PKa inhibitor. These results suggest that the vanadate-stimulated release of LPL activity is associated with a process involving a rapid increase in the cAMP content accompanied by the activation of PKA.", 
    "24": "The effects of some beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (atenolol, betaxolol, bunitrolol, labetalol, pindolol, and propranolol) on Ca2+ (pCa 5.8)-activated tension development in chemically skinned fibers from canine coronary artery and right ventricular trabeculae were studied. In skinned coronary arteries, Ca(2+)-activated tension development was decreased by betaxolol and propranolol at concentration of more than 10(-5) and 10(-4) M, respectively. The pCa-tension relationships were shifted to the right and down by betaxolol. In contrast, in skinned cardiac muscle Ca(2+)-activated tension development was increased by betaxolol and propranolol at the same range of concentrations as in coronary arteries, with no change in maximum tension. The pCa-tension relation was shifted to the left by betaxolol. Other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (atenolol, bunitrolol, labetalol, and pindolol) had no effect on Ca(2+)-induced contraction in either muscle type. These results indicate that among beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, only betaxolol and propranolol can directly modulate the Ca2+ sensitivity of myofilaments and have opposite effects on the contractile system in canine cardiac and vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "25": "Atrial fibrillation is associated with a resting heart rate in excess of age-matched subjects in sinus rhythm, and there is an additional steep rise in rate during exertion. This article reviews the factors responsible for this tachycardia, the pharmacologic agents commonly used for heart rate control, and the effects of atrial antiarrhythmic agents on the heart rate during paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.", 
    "26": "Treatment of atrial fibrillation is often unsatisfactory because no available drug has been shown to be clearly superior for maintaining patients in sinus rhythm, and all agents have significant potential for toxicity. Selection of an antiarrhythmic drug is more likely to be based on the drug's potential for toxicity, rather than its demonstrated superior efficacy in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Careful assessment of each patient for contraindications to individual agents and the likelihood of treatment success needs to be done before initiating antiarrhythmic therapy.", 
    "27": "Biliary clearance (Clb) of sotalol (STL) enantiomers was assessed in anaesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats (419 +/- 9 g, mean +/- SEM, n = 4) following administration of a 10 mg kg-1 i.v. dose of the racemate. Clb for S- and R-STL (0.0675 +/- 0.0090 and 0.0662 +/- 0.0089 mL min-1 kg-1, respectively) represented approximately 0.3% of systemic clearance (Cls) values for S- and R-STL (20.4 +/- 2.2 and 20.7 +/- 2.0 mL min-1 kg-1, respectively). Bile:plasma concentration ratios at 1, 2, and 3 h post-dose were approximately 1.4, 1.3, and 1.2 for both STL enantiomers. Renal clearance (Clr) and intestinal clearance (Cli) of STL enantiomers were assessed in conscious Sprague-Dawley rats (325 g, n = 4) following administration of a 10 mg kg-1 i.v. dose of the racemate. STL enantiomers were predominantly eliminated intact in the urine: Clr for S- and R-STL (26.3 +/- 3.2 and 28.7 +/- 4.2 mL min-1 kg-1 respectively) accounted for approximately 96% of Cls for S- and R-STL (27.5 +/- 3.3 and 29.9 +/- 4.2 mL min-1 kg-1, respectively). Approximately 4% of the dose was recovered in the faeces, corresponding to Cli values of 1.16 +/- 0.17 and 1.26 +/- 0.19 mL min-1 kg-1 for S- and R-STL, respectively. Total recovery of the administered dose in urine and faeces was 99.7 +/- 0.2 and 99.8 +/- 0.5% for S- and R-STL, respectively. It is concluded from these results in the rat model that (i) STL enantiomers are predominantly eliminated intact in urine; (ii) STL enantiomers are excreted intact in bile, and to a much larger extent in the faeces, thus suggesting the presence of intestinal exsorption of STL; (iii) STL does not appear to be metabolized; and (iv) Cls, Clr, Clb, and Cli are negligibly stereoselective.", 
    "28": "A 40-year-old female receiving divalproex sodium (VPA) monotherapy for epilepsy developed a tremor secondary to the drug. Propranolol treatment was initiated. While receiving propranolol 40 mg, VPA clearance was reduced from 1.66 L/hr to 1.19 L/hr and dropped to 1.08 L/hr on propranolol 80 mg. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. To evaluate the potential for a drug interaction between these two agents, 12 patients on VPA monotherapy, ages 19-55, were studied. The subjects were maintained on a constant dose of VPA. Each was then randomly assigned to receive placebo, or long-acting propranolol 60 mg/day or 120 mg/day. Mean VPA serum concentrations did not change among the three groups. Plasma half-life of VPA ranged from 7.3-18 hours and did not change with coadministration of propranolol.

The current study was conducted to determine their effects alone and in combination on cognitive function and sexual differentiation. Pregnant Long-Evans rats (N = 19) were exposed to either cocaine (15 mg/kg/dose b.i.d. SC on GD 8-20); nicotine (4 mg/kg/day continuous SC infusion on GD 4-20); both nicotine + cocaine; or vehicle only. Birth weight and anogenital distance (AGD) were measured in all pups at birth. Learning and memory were tested in the Morris water maze (MWM) during prepubertal and pubertal ages in five daily consecutive sessions and a sixth session 1 week later and in the radial-arm maze (RAM) during adulthood. In the RAM, a drug challenge of the beta-noradrenergic antagonist propranolol (10-20 mg/kg) was given after acquisition training. Maternal weight gain was reduced 13-42% and offspring birth weight was reduced by 7-12% in all three exposure groups compared to controls. Cocaine decreased the AGD of males (2.68 mm) compared to 2.88 mm in noncocaine-exposed male pups (p < 0.025). A sex-selective cocaine effect was also seen after adjustment of AGD measurements for body weight. With this measure cocaine-treated females showed significantly (p < 0.05) greater AGD than those not exposed to cocaine. In the MWM, there were two types of trials: cued reference memory trials and uncued spatial working memory trials. On cued reference memory trials significant cocaine-induced latency deficits were seen on only the first session. On spatial working memory trials cocaine-induced latency deficits were seen throughout daily training on sessions 1-5, but not the retention session 6, 1 week later. During RAM acquisition, there were no significant differences in choice accuracy between exposure groups. Following propranolol challenge, deficits in choice accuracy were demonstrated in rats prenatally exposed to cocaine or nicotine. These rats did not show any response to propranolol, whereas the controls slightly improved their choice accuracy. The results of this study indicated that prenatal cocaine exposure altered long-term cognitive function under basal conditions in the MWM and drug challenge in the RAM, birth weight, and genital development. Cocaine-induced cognitive deficits were predominately in working memory rather than reference memory or long-term retention. Prenatal nicotine exposure was only observed to alter birth weight and cognitive function in response to propranolol challenge in the RAM.", 
    "30": "We evaluated the hypothesis that fluctuations in systemic arterial pressure (SAP) are under the influence of the respiratory pumping mechanism subjected to a modulatory action by the autonomic nervous system that is exerted primarily on the heart. Computer-generated broad-band mechanical ventilation (0-3 Hz) was applied to Sprague-Dawley rats that were anesthetized with ketamine and paralyzed with pancuronium. We observed excellent coherence between lung volume and SAP signals at ventilatory rates between 0.5 and 2.5 Hz; this coherence was unaffected by phentolamine, propranolol, atropine, bilateral vagotomy, or ventilatory stroke volume at 2-4 ml. Whereas bilateral vagotomy exerted no discernible effect, propranolol elicited a significant frequency-dependent (0.5-1.5 Hz) reduction in the magnitude of lung volume-SAP and lung volume-pulse pressure transfer functions. There was also a shift toward 0 degree for the phase of the lung volume-SAP transfer function over the same frequency range. We conclude that the high-frequency component (0.8-2.4 Hz) of the SAP spectrum may be generated by the respiratory pumping mechanism. However, the lower-frequency end of this mechanical influence is subjected to additional amplification by the autonomic nervous system, in which the beta-adrenergic system played a major role via its influence on the heart.", 
    "31": "The contribution of nitric oxide (NO) formation to the dilation of large epicardial coronary arteries to beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor stimulation was investigated in conscious dogs. After beta 1-adrenergic blockade (atenolol, 1.0 mg/kg iv), selective beta 2-adrenergic receptor activation with intracoronary bolus injections of pirbuterol (50 ng/kg) increased coronary blood flow (CBF) by 95 +/- 19% from 48.5 +/- 8.4 ml/min and external epicardial coronary diameter (CD) by 0.14 +/- 0.03 from 3.23 +/- 0.31 mm. After intracoronary N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 50 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 x 12 min) was administered, baseline CD decreased but CBF was not altered. After L-NAME, bolus injections of pirbuterol resulted in smaller (P < 0.01) CBF responses (40 +/- 12%), and increases in CD were abolished. When pirbuterol (500 ng.kg-1.min-1) was given as a continuous infusion, CBF increased by 36 +/- 5% from 55.4 +/- 5.8 ml/min and CD by 0.16 +/- 0.03 mm from 3.44 +/- 0.16 mm. L-NAME abolished CD increases and limited (P < 0.01) CBF responses to 9 +/- 3%. When increases in CBF caused by pirbuterol before L-NAME were prevented by arterial constriction, CD increases were suppressed. In contrast, CBF and CD responses to beta 1-adrenergic stimulation were maintained after L-NAME. Thus beta 2-adrenergic dilation of epicardial conductance arteries is primarily a flow-dependent process involving NO formation. In contrast, beta 1-adrenergic activation produces epicardial coronary dilation independent of an L-NAME-sensitive mechanism.",

    "35": "Intravenous injections of PGI2 caused dose-dependent increases in CBF, and decreases in MAP and late diastolic coronary resistance (LDCR). For instance, CBF increased by 128 +/- 19% (P < 0.05) from 30 +/- 3.5 ml/min and LDCR decreased by 73 +/- 3% (P < 0.05) from 2.57 +/- 0.20 mmHg/ml/min following injection of PGI2 (1.0 microgram/kg). After infusion of nitro-L-arginine (NLA, 35 mg/kg) intravenously, the coronary vasodilation induced by PGI2 was partially attenuated. PGI2 (1.0 microgram/kg) increased CBF by 55 +/- 15% from 33 +/- 5.3 ml/min and decreased LDCR by 42 +/- 9% (both P < 0.05, compared with before NLA) from 3.29 +/- 0.39 mmHg/ml/min. Infusion of L-arginine (100 mg/kg) reversed the action of NLA. For example, PGI2 (1.0 microgram/kg) increased CBF by 115 +/- 15% from 36 +/- 6 ml/min and decreased LDCR by 68 +/- 3% from 3.02 +/- 0.36 mmHg/ml/min (both P > 0.05, compared with before NLA). Atropine (0.1 mg/kg) partially attenuated the coronary vasodilation induced by PGI2 the magnitude of which was almost identical to that by NLA. NLA or atropine also blunted the coronary vasodilation induced by acetylcholine, while the coronary vasodilation induced by nitroglycerin was not affected by NLA.", 
    "36": "Our results indicate that the coronary vasodilation induced by PGI2 was partially attenuated by NLA or atropine, suggesting that the coronary vasodilation induced by PGI2 is due to two components: a reflex parasympathetic cholinergic vasodilation mediated by NO and a direct action of PGI2.",

    "38": "Experiments were performed on 8 open-chest dogs anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. A micromanometer-tipped catheter was used to measure left ventricular pressure, dp/dt and the time constant of isovolumic relaxation. Rapid atrial pacing was used to induce alternans and the left stellate ganglion was stimulated electrically to alter sympathetic tone. The longest pacing cycle length that showed a significant alternation in peak systolic pressure was defined as the alternans threshold. Electrical alternans was detected by comparing the ST-T area in the surface ECG (lead II) on alternate beats.", 
    "39": "The alternans threshold was 305(s.e.m. 10.4) ms under control conditions and decreased to 271(12.1), 225(33.4), and 177(6.2)ms, as the frequency of left stellate stimulation was increased to 1, 2, and 5 Hz, respectively (P < 0.001). Tau and peak -dp/dt began to alternate at the same pacing cycle length as peak +dp/dt and peak systolic pressure. Electrical alternans was only observed during mechanical alternans and the ST-T area of the strong beat was 243(143)% greater than the ST-T area of the weak beat (P < 0.001). Timolol (1 mg.kg-1) blocked the effect of left stellate stimulation (1 and 2 Hz) on mechanical and electrical alternans.", 
    "40": "Left sympathetic activation causes a frequency-dependent reduction in the threshold cycle length for global mechanical and electrical alternans. Alternation in relaxation occurs at the same pacing cycle length as does alternation in contraction. Repolarization alternans in the surface ECG appears to reflect underlying mechanical events.",

Experiments were performed in the absence (Series 1, 10 dogs) and in the presence (Series 2, 22 dogs) of a controlled heart rate and prior to and after the administration of a sensitive and selective vasoactive intestinal peptide antagonist (Series 3, 16 dogs).", 
    "43": "Right ventricular contraction (+dp/dtmax), relaxation (-dp/dtmin) and heart rate increased significantly during 20 Hz vagal nerve stimulation for 5 min. Vagal nerve stimulation in Series 1 increased right ventricular +dp/dtmax by 28% from a control value of 480 +/- 11 (P < 0.001) and right ventricular -dp/dtmin by 23% from a control value of 341 +/- 11 (P < 0.002). Left ventricular +dp/dtmax and -dp/dtmin increased slightly but not significantly. Vagal nerve stimulation also increased the heart rate by 29% from a control value of 149 +/- 2 (P < 0.001). During controlled heart rate in Series 2, vagal nerve stimulation at 20 Hz consistently increased right ventricular +dp/dtmax and -dp/dtmin comparable to Series 1 experiments but did not increase left ventricular +dp/dtmax or -dp/dtmin. Injection of the vasoactive intestinal peptide antagonist [4Cl-DPhe6, Leu17]VIP into the right coronary artery of 16 dogs in Series 3 did not affect right ventricular +dp/dtmax, -dp/dtmin, or heart rate. However, this antagonist substantially decreased the vagal-induced increases in right ventricular +dp/dtmax, -dp/dtmin, and heart rate by 85, 63, and 71% (P < 0.005), respectively.",

    "45": "Endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] is a cell wall polymer derived from Gram-negative bacteria that stimulates macrophages to produce a variety of inflammatory mediators. In these studies, we examined LPS-stimulated formation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by cultured rat Kupffer cells. Cytochalasin B and methylpalmitate, blockers of endocytosis, decreased LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha release by > 92%. Bafilomycin A, monensin, and chloroquine, which prevent endosomal acidification, also blocked LPS-stimulated release of TNF-alpha by > 90%. Cytochalasin B and bafilomycin A decreased TNF-alpha mRNA levels by > 90% after LPS stimulation. Consistent with the requirement for LPS uptake and processing was the observation that Kupffer cells required 30 min of contact with LPS for maximal TNF-alpha release. LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha release was unaltered by incubation in Ca(2+)-free ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid medium, and A-23187, a Ca2+ ionophore, failed to stimulate TNF-alpha release in the absence of LPS. However, nisoldipine, a Ca2+ channel blocker, suppressed LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha release in cells cultured both in Ca(2+)-containing and Ca(2+)-free media. Although thapsigargin did not block TNF-alpha release, this depleter of intracellular Ca2+ stores blocked LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha synthesis in Ca(2+)-free medium and decreased TNF-alpha mRNA levels by 80%. Furthermore, LPS induced a late rise in intracellular free Ca2+ demonstrated by video microscopy of fura 2-loaded Kupffer cells. De novo protein and RNA synthesis were required, since cycloheximide and actinomycin D also inhibited LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha release. We compared free TNF-alpha secreted into culture supernatants with cell-associated TNF-alpha and found that cytochalasin B, bafilomycin A, chloroquine, monensin, and nisoldipine did not increase bound, cell-associated TNF-alpha. We conclude that endocytosis and endocytic processing may be necessary for LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha release from Kupffer cells. Ca2+ release, regulated by dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels, also appears to be necessary for LPS-induced signaling and may arise from intracellular stores associated with the endosome/lysosome compartment.", 
    "46": "The present study examined whether hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) attenuates norepinephrine (NE) effectiveness in small arteries by interfering with function of alpha 1a- and/or alpha 1b- adrenoceptor subtypes. Small mesenteric arteries (approximately 150 microns) were obtained from rats mounted on a small vessel myograph in oxygenated physiological salt solution (PSS), and the relationship between NE concentrations and contractile tension was assessed. Hypoxia was induced by bubbling the vessels with 95% N2-5% CO2 for 15 min. Vessels were then reoxygenated for 30 min, and NE responses were reevaluated. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were added to the PSS in one group of vessels to investigate the role of reactive oxygen metabolites. In other groups, alpha 1b-receptors were blocked with chloroethylclonidine and alpha 1a-receptors were blocked with 5-methylurapidil or WB-4101 to produce exclusive alpha 1a- or alpha 1b-responses to NE. H/R decreased the NE negative logarithm of the mean effective concentration (pD2: i.e., -log[EC50], where EC50 is mean effective concentration) from 6.26 +/- 0.24 to 5.84 +/- 0.12 (P < 0.05). SOD and CAT prevented the H/R-induced contractile dysfunction. alpha 1a-Receptor responses to NE were not altered by H/R. In contrast, alpha 1b-receptor responses were significantly attenuated after H/R. The results indicate that alterations in NE responsiveness after H/R are due to dysfunction of the alpha 1b signal transduction pathway.", 
    "47": "Chronic administration of clenbuterol, a beta 2-adrenergic agonist, attenuates the exercise training-induced improvement in muscle insulin resistance of the obese Zucker rat. The present study was conducted to determine whether clenbuterol also attenuates the increase in muscle GLUT-4 protein that occurs with exercise training and whether the action of clenbuterol is related to its ability to downregulate the beta-adrenergic receptors. Female obese Zucker rats were randomly assigned to one of the following four groups: control (CON, n = 7), clenbuterol (CL, n = 8), exercise training (TR, n = 8), and clenbuterol with exercise training (CL+TR, n = 8). Rats assigned to the training groups were run on a rodent motor-driven treadmill for 6-7 wk. Rats receiving clenbuterol were intubated with 0.8 mg/kg body weight 30 min before running each day. Red quadriceps (RQ) and white quadriceps (WQ) GLUT-4 protein concentrations of TR rats were significantly greater than those of CON and CL+TR rats. The RQ GLUT-4 protein concentration of the CL+TR rats was significantly greater than that of CON rats, but this difference did not occur in the WQ. GLUT-4 protein concentrations were not different between the CON and CL rats. The patterns of RQ and WQ GLUT-4 mRNA were similar to those of their respective GLUT-4 proteins. Rats receiving daily injections of propranolol (30 mg/kg body wt), a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, demonstrated no increase in GLUT-4 protein in RQ or WQ after 6 wk of exercise training. These results indicate that 1) clenbuterol can attenuate the increase in muscle GLUT-4 protein associated with exercise training and 2) this effect is likely mediated by a downregulation of the beta-adrenergic receptors.",

Treatment was masked for the first 6 months and open-label during the second 6 months.", 
    "50": "Of the 272 patients initially enrolled, withdrawals were due to inadequate IOP control (1%), increased iris pigmentation (5%), other ocular problems (3%), systemic medical problems (3%), and nonmedical reasons (14%). Latanoprost significantly (P < 0.0001) reduced diumal IOP from 25.3 +/- 3.0 mmHg (mean +/- standard deviation) at baseline to 17.4 +/- 2.7 mmHg (32% reduction) at 12 months in the 198 patients who completed 1 year of treatment. The IOP reduction was maintained at a consistent level throughout the 12 months without evidence of drift, and was not affected by sex, age, race, or eye color. Overall, latanoprost caused a possible or definite increase in iris pigmentation in 12% of the 272 patients, all of whom had multicolored irides at baseline. One half of these patients with increased pigmentation withdrew before completing 1 year of therapy. Visual field, optic disc cupping, visual acuity, refractive error, conjunctival hyperemia, aqueous flare, anterior chamber cellular response, lens examination, blood pressure, heart rate, blood tests, and urinalysis were not appreciably altered.",

The secondary objective was to investigate the relationship between human jejunal effective permeability values and physicochemical properties for four different drugs.", 
    "53": "Nine healthy male volunteers were included in the study, which consisted of two sequential study parts. In the first part, the jejunal effective permeability of fluvastatin, antipyrine, metoprolol, and atenolol was assessed with use of the regional jejunal perfusion approach (150 minutes, 2.0 ml/min). After a washout period of at least 5 days, the same subjects received an intravenous infusion of fluvastatin (20 minutes, 2.0 mg). Plasma samples were taken in both parts of the study and were analyzed for the content of fluvastatin.", 
    "54": "The mean hepatic extraction of fluvastatin was 67% after the jejunal perfusion and 73% after the intravenous infusion. The half-life of fluvastatin was approximately 60 minutes after both administration routes. The jejunal effective permeability and the fraction absorbed both correlated (r2 = 0.968, p < 0.05; and r2 = 0.994, p < 0.05) with the partition coefficient (log D, pH 6.5) but not with the molecular size or the hydrogen bond number.", 
    "55": "Fluvastatin is extracted by the liver to a large extent (about 70%) and has a short half-life after both oral and intravenous administration. In this study, the human jejunal effective permeability and the fraction absorbed for these four drugs were better predicted by log D (pH 6.5) than both the molecular size and the hydrogen bond number.", 
    "56": "The cholinergic system exerts an important modulatory effect on hippocampal functions. Presynaptic inhibition of hippocampal and neocortical acetylcholine (ACh) release by serotonin (5-HT) has been reported in both rat and human brain. There is some controversy, however, concerning the 5-HT receptor which mediates the inhibitory effects of 5-HT. Using slices of the hippocampal formation of rat prelabelled with [3H]-overflow ([3H]-choline, superfused and depolarized electrically (2 min, 3 Hz, 2 ms, 24 mA) or by K+ (20 mM) we observed that 5-HT inhibits hippocampal and entorhinal [3H]-overflow ([3H]-ACh release) by 5-HT1B receptors located on cholinergic terminals. However, this inhibition requires the functional elimination of substance P/gamma-aminobutyric acid (SP/GABA) interneurons which express 5-HT2A receptors as shown by in situ hybridisation histochemistry. Activation of these somadendritically located 5-HT2a receptors facilitates SP release. SP, in turn, stimulates hippocampal [3H]-ACh release through NK1 receptors present on cholinergic terminals. These findings suggest close links between cholinergic afferents, SP interneurons and 5-HT2 receptors. A loss of cholinergic afferents and 5-HT2 receptors, along with a reduction in substance P-immunoreactive neurons, have been observed in the brains of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, suggesting the concept that these three alterations reflect a disruption of a functional unit. The present findings might help to explain early pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "57": "A prospective double-blind, randomized study was conducted to compare the effects of the beta 1 antagonist, beta 2 agonist celiprolol (200 mg daily) on renal hemodynamics and protein excretion with those of the beta 1 antagonist atenolol (50 mg daily), the ACE-inhibitor ramipril (2.5 mg daily), and placebo in 11 patients with proteinuria > 400 mg/24 h due to chronic glomerulonephritis. All 4 substances were given in a double-blind, randomized manner according to a latin-square design over a period of 4 weeks with a wash-out period of 2 weeks in between. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured by inulin and PAH clearance. Proteinuria was assessed by urine sampling at the end of each treatment period. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was reduced significantly (p < 0.01) by all 3 drugs compared to placebo (108 +/- 9 mmHg placebo, 98 +/- 12 mmHg atenolol, 101 +/- 11 mmHg celiprolol, and 98 +/- 8 mmHg ramipril). Celiprolol induced a significant increase in ERPF compared to placebo (322 +/- 109 ml/min under placebo versus 391 +/- 110 ml/min under celiprolol, p < 0.05). GFR was slightly but insignificantly increased under atenolol and celiprolol. Filtration fraction (FF) remained unchanged in case of atenolol and celiprolol treatment and was slightly but not significantly reduced by ramipril. Proteinuria was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced compared to placebo by all 3 drugs (1.8 +/- 1.3 g/24 h under placebo, 1.2 +/- 1.2 g/24 h under atenolol, 1.2 +/- 1.1 g/24 h under celiprolol, and 1.4 +/- 1.4 g/24 h under ramipril). These data demonstrate that new beta-blocking agents show favorable effects on proteinuria and renal blood flow in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and arterial hypertension. This may be attributed to their vasodilating properties.", 
    "58": "1. Previous experiments have suggested a potential atypical antipsychotic activity of the ergoline derivative LEK-8829. In vitro experiments showed a high affinity to 5-HT1A, 5-HT2 and D2 receptors (the ratio of pKi values 5-HT2/D2 = 1.11) and a moderate affinity to D1 receptors. In vivo experiments showed antagonism of dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor-linked behaviours. 2. In the present study, the rats with unilateral dopaminergic deafferentation of the striatum, induced by the lesion of the median forebrain bundle with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), were used to determine the effects of LEK-8829 on turning behaviour and on striatal c-fos mRNA levels. 3. The administration of LEK-8829 induced a long lasting contralateral turning behaviour that was dose-dependent. It was found that the specific D1 receptor antagonist SCH-23390 but not the D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol or 5-HT1A antagonist pindolol, dose-dependently inhibited the turning behaviour induced by LEK-8829. 4. In an attempt to clarify the D1:D2 receptor interactions involved in the action of LEK-8829 in the 6OHDA model, we used in situ hybridization histochemistry to compare the effect of SCH-23390 pretreatment on striatal c-fos mRNA expression induced either by LEK-8829 or by the typical antipsychotic haloperidol. 5. LEK-8829 induced a bilateral striatal c-fos mRNA expression that was significantly higher in the denervated striatum as compared to the intact striatum and was completely blocked on both sides by pretreatment with SCH-23390. In contrast, haloperidol-induced striatal c-fos mRNA expression was limited to the innervated striatum and was not blocked by SCH-23390. 6. Our data demonstrate an intrinsic activity of LEK-8829 on D1 receptors that is potentiated in the dopamine-depleted striatum. We conclude, therefore, that the putative atypical antipsychotic LEK-8829 may prove useful as an experimental tool for the study of D1:D2 receptor interactions and could have beneficial effects in the treatment of drug-induced psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease.", 
    "59": "1. It has recently been suggested that therapy with beta-adrenoceptor blockers reduces peripheral arterial resistance via enhanced vascular dilatation. Therefore, we studied the effects of celiprolol, which is a specific beta 1-antagonist that has a weak beta 2-agonist action, on arterial tone in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. 2. Two doses of celiprolol (5 and 50 mg kg-1 day-1) were administered to the SHR, while the WKY rats received only the higher dose of the drug. During the 12-week treatment period the higher dose attenuated the increase in blood pressure by approximately 20 mmHg in SHR, whereas the lower dose was without significant antihypertensive effect. Celiprolol therapy did not affect blood pressure in the normotensive WKY rats. 3. Responses of mesenteric arterial rings in vitro were examined at the end of the study. Interestingly, endothelium-mediated relaxations of noradrenaline (NA)-precontracted rings to acetylcholine (ACh) in the absence and presence of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, diclofenac, were equally enhanced in both celiprolol-treated SHR groups. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) practically abolished the relaxations to ACh in all SHR irrespective of whether they had received celiprolol, whereas in WKY rats L-NAME only attenuated the responses to ACh. However, no differences were found between the SHR groups in relaxations to ACh when hyperpolarization of smooth muscle was prevented by precontractions induced by 50 mM KCl. Vasorelaxation of NA-precontracted rings to the exogenous nitric oxide donor, nitroprusside, was also moderately augmented in both celiprolol-treated SHR groups, while the relaxation to beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline, remained equally impaired in all SHR whether or not they had received celiprolol. No differences were observed between the two WKY groups in the responses to ACh, nitroprusside or isoprenaline. 4. Contractile sensitivity of mesenteric arterial rings to the receptor-mediated agonists, NA and 5-hydroxytryptamine, was comparable in all study groups. 5. In conclusion, SHR treatment with either the low or the higher dose of celiprolol was accompanied by enhancement of both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent nitric oxide-mediated arterial relaxation, possibly via a hyperpolarization mechanism. Interestingly, this effect appeared to be independent of the reduction in blood pressure.",

The new reagents were tested in the derivatization of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and anti-arrhythmic agents and allowed derivatization in the presence of water. (+)- and (-)-NAB-C were compared with other reagents with a 6-methoxy-2-naphthyl moiety as a chromophore.

    "62": "Treatment with beta-blockers and diuretics has been associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus in three prospective cohort studies. Prospective, randomized studies with antihypertensive drugs have demonstrated differences between different classes of drugs regarding effects on insulin sensitivity. Thus, treatment with beta-blockers or diuretics is associated with impairment in insulin sensitivity, whereas most modern calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are neutral. However, there are exceptions within the different classes. Captopril seems to differ from the other ACE inhibitors and results in improvement of insulin sensitivity. The most pronounced improvements have been obtained with alpha 1-blockers. In populations at high risk for diabetes mellitus, it may be justified to select drugs that improve insulin sensitivity when treating hypertension in insulin resistant individuals.", 
    "63": "While indirect evidence suggested that the responsiveness of frog adrenoceptors changes in response to temperature, direct measurement of adrenoceptor binding following acclimation to warm and cold temperatures had not been done. In the present study, the radioligands [3H]prazosin, [3H]RX821002, and [125I]cyanopindolol were used to label and quantify alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-adrenoceptors in bullfrogs acclimated to warm or cold environments. The number of alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-adrenoceptors in atrium, ventricle, and kidney membranes was not significantly different between warm- and cold-acclimated frogs. Characterization of receptor subtypes using pharmacological antagonists demonstrated that alpha 2-adrenoceptors in frog spinal cord and kidney were of the same pharmacological subtype, which is similar to the mammalian alpha 2A-subtype. The beta-adrenoceptor in frog ventricle, atrium, and kidney was the beta 2-subtype. These results suggest that while the alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-adrenoceptor types have evolved in the frog, multiple subtypes of adrenoceptors are not necessary for physiological regulation in this species.", 
    "64": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla play a role in the sympathoinhibitory response elicited by i.v. administration of cocaine and, if so, to identify the type(s) of receptors involved. Adrenergic antagonists were microinjected bilaterally into the rostral ventrolateral medulla in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats in an attempt to block the decrease in sympathetic nerve discharge (SND) elicited by cocaine (1 mg/kg i.v.). After the bilateral microinjection of saline, cocaine elicited a -56 +/- 5% (mean +/- S.E.) decrease in SND lasting 36 +/- 3 min. Cocaine also increased arterial pressure (21 +/- 3 mm Hg). Prior microinjection of the alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist idazoxan (0.3, 3 or 10 nmol) did not alter the magnitude of the sympathoinhibitory response to cocaine; however, the duration of the response was significantly reduced by all 3 doses (range 21 +/- 3 to 11 +/- 2 min). Similarly, microinjection of the alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist piperoxan (10 nmol) decreased the duration (from 45 +/- 8 to 23 +/- 4 min), but not the magnitude of the sympathoinhibitory response. Microinjection of either the alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist terazosin (0.24 nmol) or the beta adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (2 nmol) did not attenuate the decrease in SND elicited by cocaine. The cocaine-mediated pressor response was not affected by any of the antagonist treatments. These data show that the decrease in SND elicited by cocaine is mediated centrally and involves, at least in part, the activation of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the rostral ventrolateral medulla.", 
    "65": "The effects of carvedilol, a novel vasodilating beta-blocker and antioxidant, and propranolol on survival, neurobehavioral deficits, cardiovascular parameters, plasma renin, plasma aldosterone levels and renal pathology were determined in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats were allowed access to 1% NaCl as the drinking solution and a high fat diet supplemented with carvedilol (1200 or 2400 ppm) or propranolol (2400 ppm). The control group consisted of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats placed on the same diet with no drug supplement. Animals fed propranolol had a blood level of 864 +/- 68 ng/ml, whereas carvedilol-fed animals had blood levels of 24 +/- 4 ng/ml at 1200 ppm and 471 +/- 145 ng/ml at 2400 ppm. Carvedilol and propranolol treatment resulted in significant beta adrenoceptor blockade. Both compounds reduced heart rate, but had no significant effects on systolic arterial blood pressure. Carvedilol- and propranolol-treated animals also exhibited significant, prolonged protection from neurobehavioral deficits and mortality (P < .01). Elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels seen in untreated controls were significantly decreased by propranolol (P < .05), and to a considerably greater extent by the same dose of carvedilol (P < .01). Carvedilol decreased renal histopathological damage and cardiac hypertrophy to a greater extent (P < .01) than propranolol (at equal doses). Both carvedilol (P < .01)- and propranolol (P < .01)-treated animals had considerably reduced renal damage at 18 weeks of treatment. Carvedilol reduced renal damage more than propranolol (P < .05). In addition, the lower (1200 ppm) dose of carvedilol, which decreased neurobehavioral deficits and mortality, had no significant effects on organ mass or renal function, but significantly (P < .01) reduced renal damage. These data indicate that both beta adrenoceptor blockers, especially carvedilol to a considerably greater degree, convey significant protection in a genetic model of severe hypertension that results in renal and cardiovascular organ pathology, neurobehavioral deficits and premature death.",

    "67": "Myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density was measured in 11 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, eight patients with left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to arterial hypertension or aortic valve disease and 18 normal control subjects, using positron emission tomography with 11C-CGP-12177 as the myocardial beta-adrenoceptor ligand.", 
    "68": "Reflecting the natural incidence of the conditions, the age of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients was 37 (10) [mean (SD), range 20-51] years and that of the secondary hypertrophy patients 64 (18), [range 26-80] years; P < 0.01. The controls' ages were 50 (13), [range 21-65] years; however, since beta-adrenoceptor density is known to be influenced by age, the controls' data was split into groups matched to the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and secondary hypertrophy patient sets. For the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients, mean left ventricular beta-adrenoceptor was 7.70 (1.86) pmol.g-1 compared to 10.17 (2.44) pmol.g-1 for a matched set of 15 controls; P < 0.01. In secondary left ventricular hypertrophy, beta-adrenoceptor was 6.35 (1.70) pmol.g-1 compared to 9.16 (2.00) pmol.g-1 for a matched set of 10 controls; P < 0.01. Plasma noradrenaline was 5.5 (2.2) nmol.l-1 in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 2.5 (1.0) nmol.l-1 for the matched controls; P < 0.01. The results for adrenaline were 2.2 (1.1) vs 0.4 (0.3) nmol.l-1 respectively; P < 0.001. For the secondary hypertrophy patients, the corresponding figures were 2.5 (1.2) vs 2.5 (1.0) nmol.l-1 for noradrenaline for patients and controls respectively (P = ns); and for adrenaline 0.2 (0.1) and 0.3 (0.2) nmol.l-1 respectively, P = ns. On multiple regression analysis, no relationships could be demonstrated amongst plasma catecholamines, beta-adrenoceptor, myocardial blood flow and echocardiographic E/A ratio and fractional shortening.",

    "70": "Experience accumulated from several large trials strongly suggests that beta-blockers should be used for the management of chronic heart failure[87]. It is appropriate to add beta-blockade to conventional therapy such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors and digoxin, as this was the approach used in the major trials. It is appropriate to treat patients with mild, moderate and, when stable, severe chronic heart failure. The benefits obtained include improvements in left ventricular function, reductions in symptoms and morbidity, improvement of quality of life, and delay of clinical progression, reflected in a reduced need for cardiac transplantation and, probably, a reduction in mortality. beta-blockers are much better tolerated, when used appropriately in selected patients, than was previously supposed. To confirm the improvement in survival recently reported with carvedilol, further prospective trials using different beta-blockers are warranted. No major comparative trials have been carried out between beta-blockers in chronic heart failure, therefore it is not known whether the differences between them are clinically significant. The optimal dose of beta-blocker and the effect in patient groups excluded from or poorly represented in the clinical trials (e.g. elderly patients) have yet to be determined. Placebo-controlled mortality trials with bucindolol (BEST) and bisoprolol (CIBIS-II) are under way[89,90]. A large study of carvedilol versus metoprolol (COMET), added to conventional treatment, is planned.", 
    "71": "Two patients with long-standing tetraplegia after spinal cord injury developed reflex penile erection in the operation theatre. One had not received any anaesthesia, and penile erection occurred after introduction of the cystoscope into the urethra, and also autonomic dysreflexia. Intravenous salbutamol, in a dose of 10 micrograms, produced immediate and persistent penile detumescence and salbutamol-induced fall in blood pressure was of therapeutic value. In the second patient, penile erection occurred during general anaesthesia prior to cystoscopy. Immediate and persistent penile detumescence was achieved with intravenous salbutamol 20 micrograms. There was transient fall of blood pressure which responded to intravenous infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride. Salbutamol-induced fall in blood pressure is of therapeutic value in those spinal cord injury patients who develop, in addition to penile erection, autonomic dysreflexia precipitated by urethral instrumentation, or bladder distension with the irrigating fluid. Intravenous salbutamol is preferable to intra-cavernosal phenylephrine, noradrenaline, metaraminol, and epinephrine, or intravenous ephedrine which are contraindicated in patients with hypertension.",

    "73": "Isoproterenol-induced relaxations of rat aortic rings with and without endothelia were examined in the absence and presence of halothane. Studies were also done in the presence of inhibitors of nitric oxide-synthase, adenylyl cyclase, calmodulin, protein kinase A, and intracellular Ca2+ release mechanism. The relaxations under some of these conditions were compared with those induced by acetylcholine. Cyclic nucleotide contents of the rings were also measured.", 
    "74": "Isoproterenol relaxed aortic rings via the endothelium-dependent nitric oxide-cyclic GMP mechanism. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or of protein kinase A attenuated the isoproterenol-induced relaxations significantly but did not affect those induced by acetylcholine. Inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ release abolished the acetylcholine-induced relaxations but did not affect those induced by isoproterenol. Calmodulin inhibition attenuated both agonist-induced relaxations significantly. Unlike acetylcholine-induced relaxation, that induced by isoproterenol was not affected by halothane. Isoproterenol increased both the cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cGMP contents of rings significantly when endothelia were intact. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase attenuated the isoproterenol-induced cGMP content increases significantly but did not affect the cyclic adenosine monophosphate content increases. Halothane (2%) did not affect isoproterenol-induced increases in nucleotide content.", 
    "75": "Isoproterenol-induced nitric oxide formation requires the activation of constitutive nitric oxide synthase, but the Ca2+ release mechanism is not involved in activating this enzyme. Halothane can inhibit the nitric oxide-cyclic GMP mechanism only when Ca2+ release is greatly involved in the activation of constitutive nitric oxide synthase.",

Chest pain was induced in 63% of dynamic mid-ventricular obstruction and beta blockers suppressed either dynamic mid-ventricular obstruction or Chest pain.", 
    "77": "Three experiments were conducted examining the contribution of beta-adrenergic receptors to stress-induced cholesterol increases. Rats were exposed to 3 90-min sessions of inescapable tailshock, or left undisturbed in their home cage. Propranolol, a nonselective beta-blocker, attenuated the stress-induced cholesterol increase when administered prior to the daily shock session. Atenolol, a beta-1 specific antagonist, also attenuated the stress-induced cholesterol increase. Butoxamine, a beta-2 specific antagonist, had no effect on the stress-induced cholesterol increases.

Both echocardiographic tests showed an overall specificity (dipyridamole, 97%; dobutamine, 95%) higher than exercise stress test (79%; p < 0.05). Sensitivity of dipyridamole testing decreased from 93 to 61% (p = 0.002) if patients were receiving antianginal treatment but sensitivity of dobutamine-atropine testing was not affected (77% in patients receiving and not receiving treatment). When results were considered as positive-negative, agreement between dipyridamole and dobutamine-atropine echocardiography was 85% (kappa = 0.70). With regards to regional analysis, concordance was good (93% for segments, kappa = 0.76; and 95% for coronary arteries, kappa = 0.92).

    "85": "Chronic hypertension has been reported to produce adverse cognitive effects in elderly individuals, perhaps by altering central nervous system hemodynamics. The beneficial or adverse effects of antihypertensive drugs on these processes are not well understood. We examined the effects of captopril (90 mg/kg/day) and propranolol (80 mg/kg/day) on cognitive function and brain blood flow in hypertensive and normotensive rats. Cognitive function was assessed by the Morris water maze, and regional brain blood flow was measured by the [14C]iodoantipyrine method. Nineteen-month-old propranolol-treated hypertensive rats exhibited poorer performance (p < .05) than control rats and had lower brain blood flows, particularly in white matter regions (p < .01). Captopril-treated hypertensive rats did not differ significantly from control rats with regard to either cognitive performance or brain blood flow. In the normotensive rats, there were no effects of either drug on cognitive performance or brain blood flow. Thus, blood pressure reduction by propranolol but not captopril has an adverse effect on cognitive function and brain blood flow in hypertensive rats.", 
    "86": "Treatment of hypertension with ACE inhibitors in diabetic patients reduces proteinuria and slows progression of nephropathy compared with agents that do not maintain declines in proteinuria. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have variable effects on proteinuria; their long-term effects on progression of diabetic nephropathy are not known. The current study examines the hypothesis that CCBs that maintain reductions in proteinuria slow progression of nephropathy associated with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) by a degree comparable to ACE inhibitors, given similar levels of blood pressure control. To test this hypothesis we randomized 52 patients with NIDDM associated nephropathy and hypertension, mean age of 63 +/- 8 years, to either the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril (N = 18), nondihydropyridine CCBs (NDCCBs), verapamil SR (N = 8) or diltiazem SR (N = 10), or the beta blocker, atenolol (N = 16). Goal blood pressure was < or = 140/90 mm Hg. Patients were followed for a mean period of 63 +/- 7 months. The primary end point was change in creatinine clearance (CCr) slope in each group. There was no significant difference in mean arterial pressure reduction among the groups over the study period (P = 0.14). The mean rate of decline in CCr was greatest in the atenolol group (-3.48 ml/min/year/1.73 m2; P < 0.0001). There was no difference in the CCr slopes between lisinopril and NDCCBs groups (P = 0.36). Proteinuria was reduced to a similar extent in the lisinopril and NDCCBs groups (P > 0.99). Therefore, in persons with renal insufficiency secondary to NIDDM, similar levels of blood pressure control with either lisinopril or NDCCBs slowed progression of renal disease to a greater extent than atenolol. Moreover, this enhanced slowing of renal disease progression correlated with sustained and significant reductions in proteinuria, findings not observed in the atenolol group.",

To determine phenoxybenzamine placental passage, at the time of cesarean section simultaneous samples were obtained from the cord blood, maternal blood, and amniotic fluid. Additional blood samples were obtained from the newborn at 32 and 80 hours of life. Mean concentrations of phenoxybenzamine from cord and maternal plasma and in amniotic fluid were 103.3, 66, and 79.3 ng/mL, respectively; the newborn's plasma concentration at 32 hours of life was 22.3 ng/mL.

    "91": "Skeletal muscle L-type channels are the pharmacological receptors for Ca2+ channel antagonists, including dihydropyridines (DHPs). High affinity DHP binding to these channels in skeletal muscle membranes has been reported to be independent of Ca2+ addition and to become dependent on Ca2+ after solubilization. The channel is a multimeric complex composed of alpha 1, beta, gamma, and alpha 2 delta, of which alpha 1 is the pore-forming and DHP-binding component. In this study we coexpressed non-alpha 1 components with alpha 1 in L and COS cells and investigated their roles in the regulation of high affinity DHP binding by Mg2+ and Ca2+. No DHP binding to membranes of cells expressing alpha 1 beta alone was detected in the absence of Ca2+ or Mg2+. Addition of Mg2+ revealed the presence of (+)-PN200-110 (DHP) binding sites with a Kd of 1 nM. This affinity was 4-fold lower than that of skeletal muscle membrane binding sites (Kd = 0.25 nM). Addition of Ca2+ increased the affinity for DHP in membranes from alpha 1 beta-expressing cells to that seen in skeletal muscle membranes (Kd = 0.2-0.3 nM; EC50 of 0.2 microM). Ca2+ did not affect DHP binding to skeletal muscle membranes. Coexpression of all of the subunits completely recapitulated the high affinity DHP binding seen with skeletal muscle membranes in the absence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Kd = 0.15 nM). This affinity was unaffected by addition of Ca2+ or Mg2+. Coexpression of alpha 1 beta with either alpha 2 delta or gamma alone resulted in DHP binding intermediate between levels seen with alpha 1 beta and alpha 1 beta alpha 2 delta gamma. Thus, this study demonstrates that alpha 2 delta and gamma are essential for full reconstitution of the DHP binding characteristics of the skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channel/DHP receptor.", 
    "92": "In human subjects, chronic beta2-agonist dosing reduces mononuclear leukocyte (MNL) beta-adrenoceptor numbers. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this downregulation also occurs in the lung. Seven healthy male subjects were treated for 2 wk with oral (up to 16 mg/d) and inhaled (up to 1.6 mg/d) albuterol (salbutamol in Europe). Pulmonary maximal beta-adrenoceptor binding capacity (Bmax) was determined in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) and the beta-receptor antagonist ligand, 11C-labeled CGP-12177, before and after the 2-wk chronic dosing. MNL Bmax was also measured, using a radioligand binding assay and 3H-labeled CGP-12177. Bronchodilator responses to the beta2-agonist were determined after each PET scan by measuring the change in specific airway conductance (SGaw) after increasing doses of inhaled albuterol. Pulmonary and MNL Bmax fell by 22% +/- 14% (p < 0.05) and 42% +/- 19% (p < 0.05) respectively. The changes in pulmonary and MNL Bmax were correlated (r = 0.9, p < 0.05). There was also a reduction in the bronchodilator response to inhaled albuterol. In a further six subjects, pulmonary and MNL Bmax did not change during an acute infusion of albuterol (2 to 4 microg/kg/h). The reduction in pulmonary beta-adrenoceptor numbers after chronic albuterol dosing may be predictable from the changes observed in circulating MNL cells.", 
    "93": "The role of Ca2+ influx in the regulation of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPases (SERCA) associated with intracellular Ca2+ pools was investigated during smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). We first defined that the previously described up-regulation of the SERCA2a isoform found in vascular SMC after a 24-h stimulation with PDGF (Magnier, C. , Papp, B., Corvazier, E., Bredoux, R., Wuytack, F., Eggermont, F., Maclouf, J., and Enouf, J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 15808-15815) was precisely associated with SMC entry into S phase as it appeared linked with [3H]thymidine incorporation. This was further confirmed by testing the effect of transforming growth factor-beta1, which inhibited both aortic SMC proliferation associated with G1 cell cycle arrest and PDGF-induced SERCA2a up-stimulation. Then, we tested the role of Ca2+ influx by using SR 33805, a new Ca2+ channel blocker, which was characterized with regard to the voltage Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine and the capacitative entry Ca2+ blocker SKF 96365. SR 33805 was found to be the most potent inhibitor of both PDGF-induced SMC proliferation and the associated rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration with IC50 values of 0.2 +/- 0.1 and 0.31 +/- 0. 04 microM, respectively. Finally, by examining in parallel both SERCA2a and SERCA2b isoforms, in terms of activity and expression, we could determine that PDGF-induced stimulation of total SERCA activity (detected by formation of the phosphorylated intermediate, E approximately P) and of SERCA2a expression (Western blotting) were abolished when extracellular Ca2+ entry was prevented by SR 33805. This study demonstrates that SERCA2a up-regulation is: 1) related to the G1/S transition step of cell cycle and 2) dependent on Ca2+ entry during PDGF-induced SMC proliferation.",

Emergency physicians should understand the necessity of electrocardiography in all pediatric patients who present with multiple spontaneous falls, episodes of dizziness, new-onset seizure activity and syncopal episodes.", 
    "95": "The aim of our work was to study the hemodynamic effects of dynamic cardiomyoplasty on an acute animal model of atrial fibrillated heart failure. Eight anesthetized open chest dogs suffering from atrial fibrillation and heart failure, obtained by topic acetylcholine and propranolol, were treated by a cardiomyoplasty procedure performed with an electrostimulated latissimus dorsi muscle flap (LDMF). Values considered for analysis during LDMF stimulation were selected from cardiac cycles with R-R intervals similar to those when the LDMF was not stimulated (+/- 20 ms). Atrial fibrillated heart failure showed a significant increase of systemic vascular resistance, end diastolic left ventricular pressure (EDLVP) and right atrial pressure (p < 0.05), and a significant decrease in cardiac output, systolic left ventricular pressure (SLVP), and mean aortic pressure (p < 0.05) compared with control values. LDMF stimulation in atrial fibrillated heart failure resulted in a significant increase of SLVP, cardiac output, and mean aortic pressure (p < 0.05) and a significant decrease of systemic vascular resistance, EDLVP, and right atrial pressure (p < 0.05) compared with nonstimulated values. The highest LVP values were obtained with R-R intervals long enough to allow an adequate LV filling. We conclude that dynamic cardiomyoplasty provides an appropriate recovery in this animal model of atrial fibrillated heart failure. Cardiomyoplasty is an appropriate procedure for cardiac assist when R-R intervals allow an adequate LV filling.", 
    "96": "The effect of norepinephrine (NE) was examined on the whole-cell Ba2+ current through L-type Ca2+ channels of freshly isolated smooth muscle cells of guinea-pig vas deferens. The magnitude of maximum Ba2+ current [1Ba(max)] varied in different cells, although the capacitance of the cell membrane was similar (approximately 50 pF). Application of dbcAMP augmented 1Ba(max) by 37%, which was canceled by Rp-cAMPs, while PMA decreased the current by 32%, which was canceled by staurosporine. NE increased 1Ba(max) of the cells which originally showed relatively small 1Ba(max), and decreased the current of the cells which showed larger 1Ba(max). In the presence of phentolamine, NE increased 1Ba(max), and this effect was remarkable in cells showed smaller 1Ba(max). In the presence of propranolol, NE decreased 1Ba(max). The excitatory beta-adrenoceptor activation was canceled by Rp-cAMPs, and the inhibitory alpha-adrenoceptor effect was canceled by staurosporine. It is suggested that NE shows dual (excitatory and inhibitory) actions on the L-type Ca2+ channels of smooth muscle of guinea-pig vas deferens. The excitatory beta-adrenoceptor action mediated through cAMP/PKA is predominant in cells with lower density of the Ca2+ channels, while inhibitory alpha-adrenoceptor action mediated through PKC is predominant in cells with higher channel density.", 
    "97": "The increased mortality among patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome has been explained in part by the increased incidence of arterial and pulmonary hypertension. A decreased heart rate variability (HRV) has been shown to be associated with an increased mortality as well. We investigated 53 patients, admitted to the hospital for chest pain for sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) with an ambulatory screening device (MESAM-IV). HRV was recorded simultaneously. All patients received coronary artery catheterization and 36 had significant coronary artery disease (CAD; 67.9%). Standard time domain parameters were compared by a 4-way Anova for patients with an oxygen desaturation index of more and less than 5/hour and the factors CAD, diabetes and beta-blocker use. The percentage of differences between RR intervals that differ more than 50 ms (pNN > 50: 9.0 +/- 11.1 vs. 19.2 +/- 22.2%: p < 0.05) as well as the root mean square of these differences (38.0 +/- 29.0 vs. 59.2 +/- 51.5 ms; p < 0.05) were significantly decreased in patients with SRBD. In an hourly breakdown the number of desaturations was not correlated with a change in HRV. Mean oxygen saturation was significantly decreased in patients with SRBD (95.2 +/- 1.8 vs. 96.2 +/- 1.42%, p < 0.05), and positively correlated with the pNN > 50 (r = 0.34, p < 0.01). This correlation might suggest a more profound pathophysiological interaction between HRV and SRBD than short-term vagal activation alone. The results favor HRV for inclusion in future risk stratification models in patients with sleep apnea syndrome.", 
    "98": "In this study we determined whether cAMP is metabolized to adenosine in vascular smooth muscle cells and whether cAMP-derived adenosine modulates vascular smooth muscle cell growth. Confluent smooth muscle cells were exposed to cAMP (0.01 to 30 mumol/L) in the presence and absence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, 1 mmol/L; an inhibitor of both extracellular and intracellular phosphodiesterase), alpha, beta-methyleneadenosine 5'-diphosphate (AMP-CP, 100 mumol/L; an ecto-5'-nucleotidase inhibitor), and 1,3-dipropyl-8-p-sulfophenyl-xanthine (DPSPX, 100 mumol/L; a xanthine that can inhibit extracellular phosphodiesterase) for 0 to 60 minutes. Medium was then sampled and assayed for AMP, adenosine, and inosine. cAMP increased the amount of AMP, adenosine, and inosine in the medium in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The conversion of cAMP to adenosine and inosine was inhibited by blockade of phosphodiesterase with IBMX, of ecto-phosphodiesterase with DPSPX, and of ecto-5'-nucleotidase with AMP-CP. To evaluate the physiological relevance of cAMP-derived adenosine in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, we studied the inhibitory effects of cAMP (10(-4) mol/L) and 8-bromo-cAMP (10(-4) mol/L) on fetal calf serum-induced DNA synthesis ([3H]thymidine incorporation) in the presence and absence of erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA, an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase), dipyridamole (a blocker of adenosine transport), KF17837 (a selective A2 adenosine receptor antagonist), and DPSPX (a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist). cAMP inhibited DNA synthesis, and both EHNA and dipyridamole enhanced this effect. Both KF17837 and DPSPX significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of cAMP on DNA synthesis; however, they did not reduce the inhibitory effects of 8-bromo-cAMP on DNA synthesis. These results indicate that vascular smooth muscle cells metabolize cAMP to adenosine via the sequential action of ecto-phosphodiesterase and ecto-5'-nucleotidase and provide the first evidence that cAMP-derived adenosine can inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell growth. Hence, this cAMP-adenosine pathway may importantly contribute to the regulation of vascular biology.", 
    "99": "Gallbladder distension in anesthetized pigs reflexly increases heart rate and arterial pressure by means of afferent vagal pathways and efferent sympathetic mechanisms. The effect of such distension on the coronary circulation is unknown. The present study was undertaken to determine whether gallbladder distension primarily causes reflex changes in left circumflex blood flow.", 
    "100": "In 21 pigs anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (16) or alpha-chloralose (5), left circumflex blood flow was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter. A balloon positioned within the gallbladder was distended with volumes of Ringer's solution equal to the volumes of bile previously withdrawn (mean vol: 62 mL; mean gallbladder pressure: 12 mm Hg). Heart rate and arterial pressure were kept constant by atrial pacing and by a pressurized reservoir connected to the left femoral artery. Gallbladder distension always caused a decrease in circumflex blood flow. In 6 of the 16 sodium pentobarbitone-anesthetized pigs, this decrease was graded by step increments of distension. In 5 of these 16 pigs, the decrease in circumflex blood flow was not affected by atropine. In 10 of these 16 pigs, including those given atropine, the response was not affected by propranolol but was abolished by subsequently giving phentolamine. Cervical vagotomy abolished the coronary vasoconstriction in the remaining 6 pigs. In the 5 alpha-chloralose-anesthetized pigs, the response was not significantly affected by cutting the splanchnic nerves but was abolished by subsequent cervical vagotomy.", 
    "101": "The present study showed that innocuous distension of the gallbladder in anesthetized pigs caused a reflex coronary vasoconstriction that involved efferent sympathetic mechanisms related to alpha-adrenoceptors and afferent vagal pathways.",

    "103": "We examined prospectively the relationship of anger to CHD incidence in the Veterans Administration Normative Aging Study, an ongoing cohort of older (mean age, 61 years) community-dwelling men. A total of 1305 men who were free of diagnosed CHD completed the revised Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2) in 1986. Subjects were categorized according to their responses to the MMPI-2 Anger Content Scale, which measures the degree to which individuals have problems controlling their anger. During an average of 7 years of follow-up, 110 cases of incident CHD occurred, including 30 cases of nonfatal myocardial infarction hostility. (MI), 20 cases of fatal CHD, and 60 cases of angina pectoris. Compared with men reporting the lowest levels of anger, the multivariate-adjusted relative risks among men reporting the highest levels of anger were 3.15 (95% confidence interval) [CI]: 0.94 to 10.5) for total CHD (nonfatal MI plus fatal CHD) and 2.66 (95% CI: 1.26 to 5.61) for combined incident coronary events including angina pectoris. A dose-response relation was found between level of anger and overall CHD risk (P for trend, .008).",

    "105": "Propofol is being used more often in cardiac surgery, particularly after hypothermic, hyperkalemic cardioplegic arrest (HHCA). The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of propofol on isolated myocyte contractile function under both normothermic conditions and after simulated HHCA and rewarming. Myocytes were isolated from the left ventricle of eight pigs. Myocyte contractile function was measured under both normothermic conditions and after simulated HHCA (incubation at 4 degrees C for 2 h in crystalloid cardioplegia; K+ = 24 mEq/L) using computer-assisted videomicroscopy in the presence of 2, 4, and 6 micrograms/mL propofol (11.2, 22.4, and 33.6 microM/L, respectively). Isoproterenol (25 nM) was then added and contractile function measurements repeated. Propofol caused significant dose-dependent reductions in myocyte velocity of shortening (baseline = 67 +/- 2 microns/s; propofol = 2 micrograms/mL, 45 +/- 4 microns/s; and propofol = 6 micrograms/mL, 27 +/- 3 microns/s; P < 0.05). HHCA and rewarming caused a significant reduction in myocyte velocity of shortening (29 +/- 0.9 microns/s, P < 0.05), with further significant dose-dependent reductions in contractile function after the addition of propofol. Propofol caused a decrease in beta-adrenergic responsiveness under normothermic conditions, but not after simulated HHCA. Results from the present study demonstrated for the first time that the reduction in isolated myocyte contractile function after simulated HHCA is further decreased by propofol administration.", 
    "106": "Dynamic cardiomyoplasty is being used clinically worldwide, and evaluated by a clinical trial (phase III) in the United States. Some centers stimulate the skeletal muscle wrap with every heart beat (1:1 [muscle:heart]), whereas others use every other heart beat (1:2). Recent concern over the possible deleterious effects of too-frequent stimulation of the muscles motivated the attempt to evaluate, in a canine model of chronic, double cardiomyoplasty, the effects of two different pacing ratios on several hemodynamic parameters of interest.", 
    "107": "Double cardiomyoplasty was performed using both latissimus dorsi muscles in 11 dogs. Fatigue resistance was achieved using the clinical transformation protocol. At a final experiment, acute cardiac failure was induced by administration of propranolol. Hemodynamic measurements of eight physiologic variables were averaged over complete pacing cycles, including the nonpaced beat at a 1:2 pacing ratio.", 
    "108": "The net effects of latissimus dorsi muscle stimulation at each of two pacing ratios were compared using nonparametric statistics. With the exception of left ventricular pressure (p = 0.0262) and its first derivative, dP/dt (p = 0.0099), there was no significant difference between hemodynamic performance at the two pacing ratios.", 
    "109": "In this canine model, pacing every other beat produces hemodynamic results that are statistically similar to pacing every beat. Less frequent stimulation of the latissimus dorsi muscle may preserve its function and improve clinical results without compromising hemodynamic benefit.", 
    "110": "This study was undertaken to compare the effects of alpha-receptor blockade and beta-receptor blockade on left ventricular structure and function in essential hypertension. The increase in left ventricular mass in patients with essential hypertension is at least partly induced by the sympathetic nervous system. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial to compare the effects of alpha-blockers and beta-blockers on left ventricular structure and function. Forty-three patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were randomly allocated to receive antihypertensive therapy with either the alpha-blocker bunazosin (n = 23) or the beta-blocker metoprolol (n = 20). Twenty-four-hour blood pressure measurements and echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular structure and function were performed before therapy, after 6 months of therapy, and 4 weeks after discontinuation of therapy. Bunazosin and metoprolol led to similar reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure (-11 +/- 11/-9 +/- 8 mm Hg vs -11 +/- 12/-8 +/- 9 mm Hg, respectively) and left ventricular mass (-25 +/- 42 gm vs -28 +/- 44 gm, respectively) (p = no significant difference, bunazosin vs metoprolol). Neither metoprolol nor bunazosin significantly affected left ventricular systolic function. Diastolic left ventricular filling, however, was increased with beta-blocker medication, as indicated by a decrease in atrial filling fraction (39% +/- 5% to 34% +/- 5%; p < 0.05), but not with the alpha-blocker. The effect of metoprolol resulted from its bradycardiac effect. Four weeks after discontinuation of therapy, blood pressure and left ventricular mass increased to pretreatment levels in both groups similarly. Furthermore, the increase in diastolic filling was lost shortly after withdrawal of metoprolol concomitant with the increase in heart rate. We conclude that alpha-blockers and beta-blockers are equally capable of reducing left ventricular mass in hypertensive patients. beta-Blockers lead to an increase in diastolic left ventricular filling. This effect may be of therapeutic value because diastolic dysfunction may precede systolic dysfunction in hypertensive heart disease.", 
    "111": "The efficacy and safety of sotalol therapy for ventricular arrhythmias was evaluated in 133 patients with drug-refractory ventricular arrhythmias. All patients had baseline electrophysiologic studies before and after oral sotalol therapy. Sixty-six patients were discharged home, treated with sotalol (52 patients without inducible ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation and 14 patients with hemodynamically stable inducible ventricular tachycardia). The mean follow-up period was 41 +/- 27 months for the 14 patients with hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia. Sotalol was effective in 8 of these 14 patients. Recurrent nonlethal ventricular tachycardia occurred in 3 patients; 2 patients had sudden death; and 1 patient had adverse side effects. The 52 patients without inducible ventricular tachycardia were followed up for a mean period of 36 +/- 30 months. Thirty-five of 52 patients were successfully treated. Two patients had recurrent ventricular tachycardia; both of these episodes of ventricular tachycardia occurred within the first year. Four patients had sudden cardiac death; three of these deaths occurred within the first month, and the last episode of sudden death occurred after 8 years of sotalol therapy. The actuarial incidence of sotalol efficacy was 76% at 1 year, 72% at 2 years, 64% at 4 years, and 52% at 5 years. Approximately 46% of patients receiving long-term sotalol treatment reported side effects. Side effects severe enough to warrant withdrawal of sotalol occurred in 7 (11%) patients. The results of our study suggest that sotalol is effective for selected patients with drug refractory ventricular arrhythmias. Although the incidence of side effects are high, patients appear to tolerate long-term sotalol therapy well.", 
    "112": "IgG fractions of patients were screened for autoantibodies against the beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors and the M2 acetylcholine receptor by enzyme immunoassays and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using peptides corresponding to the second extracellular loop of these receptors. A high prevalence of anti-M2 acetylcholine receptor and, in decreasing order, of anti-beta1- and anti-beta2-adrenoceptor autoantibodies was shown. The enzyme immunoassays and the SPR studies on the anti-beta1 adrenoceptor and the M2 acetylcholine receptor autoantibodies were dependent on the ionic strength of the interaction buffer, suggesting the importance of electrostatic interactions in Ab recognition. IgG fractions showed chronotropic effects on neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in vitro. The positive chronotropic effect was enhanced in the presence of 1 microM of atropine, demonstrating a muscarinic stimulation by the IgG fractions in the presence of a beta-adrenergic stimulation, which was blocked by the use of 1 microM of the beta1-selective antagonist bisoprolol. The beta2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 only partially inhibited the positive chronotropic effect induced by the IgG fractions, confirming the minor functional importance of autoantibodies against the beta2-adrenoceptor. Affinity-purified Abs confirmed that Abs against the beta1-adrenoceptors and the M2 muscarinic receptors exist together with an Ab population recognizing a cross-reactive epitope on both receptors. This epitope could be identified as a polyanionic stretch present in the second extracellular loop of both the beta1-adrenoceptor and the M2 acetylcholine receptor. This stretch corresponds to the previously determined cross-reactive epitope between the P0 ribosomal protein of Trypanosoma cruzi and the beta1-adrenoceptor.", 
    "113": "Studies predicting mortality after myocardial infarction (MI) usually rely on in-hospital data, and combine patients admitted for the first MI with recurrent MI patients. Since treatment decisions are often made or modified at the first outpatient clinic visit, this study was designed to evaluate the importance of post-hospital data on mortality prediction after a first myocardial infarction (MI). An inception cohort of patients enrolled in the Beta-Blocker in Heart Attack Trial (n = 2830) was included. Forty-three variables (including in-hospital and post-hospital data) were evaluated using stepwise logistic regression. Ten variables were independently associated with 1-year mortality: five used in-hospital data (history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, congestive heart failure [CHF], ventricular tachycardia, and age); and five variables depended on post-hospital data collected at the first outpatient visit (CHF after discharge, New York Heart Association functional class, heart rate, pulmonary rates, and smoking). Two predictive systems were developed that partitioned patients into one of four classes with distinct mortality risks: a composite system using the 10 in- and post-hospital variables, and a system using only the 5 in-hospital variables. Mortality risk for the composite system classes ranged from 0.6 to 20.0% (I [n = 861], 0.6%; II [n = 1151], 2.3%; III [n =698], 4.3%; IV [n = 120], 20.0%). In contrast, the range of mortality risk using the in-hospital data only system was less (1 to 8.3%). Most importantly, a distinct gradient within each class of the in-hospital data only system was created by the addition of the post-hospital data. This study demonstrates that risk stratification after an acute first MI is improved by the addition of post-hospital data.", 
    "114": "The conserved leucine residues at the 9' positions in the M2 segments of alpha1 (L264) and beta1 (L259) subunits of the human GABAA receptor were replaced with threonine. Normal or mutant alpha1 subunits were co-expressed with normal or mutant beta1 subunits in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus/Sf9 expression system. Cells in which one or both subunits were mutated had a higher \"resting\" chloride conductance than cells expressing wild-type alpha1beta1 receptors. This chloride conductance was blocked by 10 mM penicillin, a recognized blocker of GABAA channels, but not by bicuculline (100 microm) or picrotoxin (100 microm) which normally inhibit the chloride current activated by GABA: nor was it potentiated by pentobarbitone (100 microM). In cells expressing wild-type beta1 with mutated alpha1 subunits, an additional chloride current could be elicited by GABA but the rise time and decay were slower than for wild-type alpha1beta1 receptors. In cells expressing mutated beta1 subunits with wild-type or mutated alpha1 subunits (alphabeta(L9'T) and alpha(L9'T)beta(L9'T)), no response to GABA could be elicited: this was not due to an absence of GABAA receptors in the plasmalemma because the cells bound [3H]-muscimol. It was concluded that in GABAA channels containing the L9'T mutation in the beta1 subunit, GABA-binding does not cause opening of channels, and that the L9'T mutation in either or both subunits gives an open-channel state of the GABAA receptor in the absence of ligand.", 
    "115": "The locus coeruleus (LC)-noradrenergic system modulates forebrain electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in halothane-anesthetized rat. For example, unilateral enhancement of LC neuronal activity increases cortical EEG (ECoG) and hippocampal EEG (HEEG) indices of arousal bilaterally (Berridge and Foote, 1991). Conversely, bilateral suppression of LC discharge activity increases EEG measures of sedation (Berridge, et al., 1993b). The EEG-activating effects of LC stimulation appear to involve noradrenergic beta-receptors (Berridge and Foote, 1991). Two candidate sites at which LC efferents could influence ECoG and HEEG are the medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (MS) and the substantia innominata/nucleus basalis of Meynert (SI). To determine whether norepinephrine mediates such actions within either of these regions, the EEG effects of small infusions of a beta-agonist or antagonist into MS or SI were examined in halothane-anesthetized rat. Unilateral infusions (150 nl) of the beta-agonist isoproterenol (ISO) (3.75 microg, 17 nmol) into MS, but not SI (150-450 nl), elicited robust bilateral activation of ECoG and HEEG. Infusions of glutamate (0.5 microg, 3.0 nmol) into either MS or SI elicited bilateral ECoG and HEEG activation. Neither vehicle infusions into MS nor infusions of ISO into regions adjacent to MS altered forebrain EEG activity. Bilateral, but not unilateral, MS infusions of the beta-antagonist timolol (3.75 microg, 8.7 nmol) decreased EEG indices of arousal in the lightly anesthetized preparation. Power spectral analyses provided quantitative confirmation of these qualitative observations. These results indicate that under these experimental conditions, noradrenergic efferents, presumably arising from LC, modulate forebrain EEG state via actions at beta-receptors located within MS. The results presented in the accompanying report extend these observations to the unanesthetized preparation and incorporate additional measures of behavioral state.", 
    "116": "Computer-modeling techniques have been used to generate docked complexes for a series of beta adrenergic agonists and antagonists with a three-dimensional model of the beta 2 adrenergic receptor. For all ligands tested, it proved possible to dock low-energy conformers in the receptor model, with sensible electrostatic, steric, and hydrogen-bonding interactions, many of which are supported by experimental studies of the beta 2 receptor. Our results illustrate the power of molecular modeling techniques, when coupled with appropriate experimental methods and data, to investigate structure-function properties of integral membrane receptor proteins that cannot yet be studied by direct structural methods.", 
    "117": "1-[6-[17 beta-3-Methoxyestra-1,3.5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]-1 H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U-73122), an inhibitor of processes involved in the activation of phospholipase C, was used to assess the role of phospholipase C activation in the synergistic elevation of cAMP induced by carbachol and prostaglandin E2 in human neuroblastoma (SK-N-BE(2)C cells. Pre-treatment of the cells with U-73122 resulted in inhibition of carbachol-induced intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) rise and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) generation, with maximal and half maximal inhibition (IC50) occurring at approximately 15 microM and 3.2 microM, respectively. U-731222 also inhibited the synergistic enhancement of cAMP accumulation induced by carbachol and prostaglandin E2 in a concentration-dependent manner with maximum and IC50 at 12 +/- 4 microM and 3.4 +/- 0.3 microM, respectively. However, U-73122 did significantly inhibit prostaglandin E2-induced production. While 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,'N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA/AM) treatment decreased the synergistic cAMP accumulation by 28%m addition U-73122 further decreased it down to complete inhibition. Furthermore, GTP gamma S- and A1F4(-)-induced InsP3 generation in digitonin-mediated permeabilized cells was also inhibited by U-73122 treatment. Pre-treatment of the cells with neomycin, another blocker of the phospholipase C pathway, also resulted in inhibition of the carbachol-induced [Ca2+]i rise, InsP3 generation, and the enhancing effect on cAMP accumulation, to a comparable extent. But, Ca2+ chelation by BAPTA/AM in addition to neomycin treatment further decreased the cAMP accumulation. These results suggest that the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ and the coupling process between muscarinic receptor-like G-protein and phospholipase C are important for the synergistic activation of adenylyl cyclase in SK-N-BE(2)C cells.", 
    "118": "This study examined the effect of carvedilol, a vasodilating beta-adrenoceptor antagonist and antioxidant, on lethal reperfusion injury in feline hearts subjected to 40 min of regional ischemia and 180 min of reperfusion. 30 open chest anaesthetized cats were randomized into three groups. A control (n = 10) was compared with a group given carvedilol before coronary artery occlusions (n = 10) and a group given carvedilol immediately before and during early reperfusion (n = 10). Regional myocardial function was measured by sonomicrometry. Infarct size was determined by staining the left ventricle with triphenyl tetrazolium chloride. Myocardial blood flow was measured by radiolabeled microspheres. Tissue levels of glutathione were measured after reperfusion. Infarct size was significantly reduced compared to control both when carvedilol was given before ischemia (0.2 +/- 0.1 vs. 17.6 +/- 3.6%, P < 0.05). and when given immediately before reperfusion (3.7 +/- 1.3 vs. 17.6 +/- 3.6%, P < 0.05). Regional shortening improved significantly and the incidence of ventricular fibrillation during early reperfusion was reduced in both groups treated with carvedilol compared to control. Oxidized glutathione did not differ between groups in the post-ischaemic myocardium. This study supports that lethal reperfusion injury is a significant phenomenon. Furthermore, carvedilol reduces infarct size and reperfusion arrhythmias, and improves post-ischaemic regional myocardial function by protecting against both ischaemic and lethal reperfusion injury. The present study does not answer whether it is the non-selective beta- or alpha 1-receptor antagonism, the antiarrhythmic or the antioxidant actions of carvedilol that is responsible for the protective effect.", 
    "119": "Hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT, EC 2.1.1.4) catalyzes the methylation of acetylserotonin to complete the synthesis of melatonin in the pineal and retina. A complete 1728 nucleotide cDNA encoding rat pineal HIOMT was isolated, characterized, and used to evaluate day/night levels of HIOMT mRNA. As previously reported for HIOMT enzyme activity, HIOMT mRNA levels were also greater in the pineal than in the retina. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization were useful for detection of HIOMT mRNA in the pineal but not the retina, whereas the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction or RNase protection assay revealed transcripts for HIOMT both in the pineal and retina. Investigating HIOMT mRNA levels in rat pineal and retina at 6 time-points throughout a 24 h period revealed higher levels of HIOMT message during darkness. The daily fluctuation in HIOMT mRNA persisted in constant darkness, verifying an endogenous circadian rhythm both in the pineal and retina. In mammalian pineals, sympathetic innervation, synthesizing norepinephrine that activates beta (beta) adrenergic receptors, entrain several circadian bodily functions through the synthesis and release of melatonin. A single injection of the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, induced a dramatic increase of HIOMT mRNA levels in the light-adapted pineal, in vivo. Moreover, a single injection of the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, prevented the nocturnal increase of pineal HIOMT mRNA. Using a combination of methods, it has been shown that the level of HIOMT mRNA fluctuates daily in both the pineal gland and retina. This day/night rhythm can be modulated either by beta receptor agonists or antagonists when applied appropriately during the circadian cycle, suggesting that the mRNA changes in HIOMT may be controlled at the transcriptional level.", 
    "120": "When rat polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were treated with N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), the release of arachidonic acid in preference to other fatty acids was observed. Levels of arachidonic acid reached a plateau within 5 min, and were accompanied by an approximately 4-fold increase in in vitro phospholipase (PL) A2 and PLD activities in PMN lysates. Treatment of PMN with ethanol (an inhibitor of PLD-mediated phosphatidic acid formation), propranolol (a phosphatidic acid phosphatase inhibitor), or 4-bromophenacylbromide (a PLA2 inhibitor), each suppressed fMLP-stimulated arachidonate release. Treatment with RHC-80267 (a diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor), however, had no such effect. The cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) inhibitor, arachidonoyl trifluoromethyl ketone, suppressed PLA2 activity in PMN homogenates and arachidonate release by fMLP-treated PMN. These results suggest that fMLP-elicited arachidonate release is mediated by cPLA2 but not diacylglycerol lipase, and that the activation of cPLA2 is downstream of the PLD-dependent signaling pathway.", 
    "121": "Roles of monoaminergic neurons in synaptic plasticity are not well clarified at mammalian central synapses. We therefore examined the actions of serotonin and noradrenaline on cerebellar excitatory and inhibitory synapses using the whole-cell recording with rat cerebellar slices. Applications of the two amines selectively elicited long-lasting facilitation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibitory transmission, possibly through a presynaptic mechanism. The facilitatory action of the amines on GABAergic transmission was mimicked by forskolin and blocked by protein kinase inhibitors, suggesting the involvement of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent mechanism in their action. A monoamine uptake inhibitor, imipramine, enhanced the GABAergic transmission, whereas it was suppressed by monoamine receptor antagonists, propranolol and methiothepin, suggesting that endogenous monoamines released by stimulation enhance the inhibitory transmission at cerebellar GABAergic synapses in sustained and activity-dependent manner. Such monoaminergic facilitation may provide a likely mechanism for synaptic plasticity in motor coordination within the mammalian cerebellar function.", 
    "122": "The influence of adriamycin (ADR) and ADR complexes with transitional metals Fe2+, Cu2+ and Co2+ on Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels of human erythrocytes was investigated. We show that the anthracycline moiety of ADR increases Ca(2+)-dependent K+ efflux from erythrocytes, induced by low concentrations of propranolol, while the whole molecule of ADR has not any effect on Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels, induced by propranolol or A23187 and on Pb(2+)-dependent K+ efflux. Ethidium bromide, verapamil and trifluoroperazine inhibited Ca(2+)-dependent K+ efflux, induced by high doses of propranolol. The anthracycline moiety of ADR is able to abolish blocking effect of ethidium bromide and verapamil, but does not influence the blocking effect of trifluoroperazine. We further show that ADR complexes with Fe2+, Cu2+ and Co2+ are potent inhibitors of Ca(2+)-dependent K+ efflux, induced by propranolol, but not of Pb(2+)-dependent K+ efflux. On the contrary, ADR-Fe3+ complex activates K(+)-permeability of human red blood cell. It is suggested that opposite effects of anthracycline moiety of ADR and ADR complexes with transitional metals on Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels, induced by propranolol is due to their influence on the pathways of Ca2+ transport into cells, rather than their action directly on K+ channels.", 
    "123": "More than 400,000 patients undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) each year in the United States. At least 20-30% of these patients have atrial fibrillation (Afib), making this arrhythmia one of the most common postoperative problems. This generally benign problem can increase surgical morbidity and the cost and length of hospital stay. If not treated promptly and effectively, Afib can delay a full and rapid recovery. Afib usually occurs in paroxysms between the second and fifth postoperative day and appears directly related to effects of surgery (pericarditis, changes in autonomic tone, cardioplegia, myocardial damage, fluid shifts, etc.). Although similar to Afib in other settings, beta-adrenergic blockade is more effective in preventing and terminating Afib in the postoperative setting. The unique circumstances that precipitate postoperative Afib may explain the favorable therapeutic and prophylactic actions of beta-adrenergic blockade. Other therapies such as amiodarone, sotalol, and digoxin are surprisingly ineffective for postoperative Afib, while intravenous diltiazem is not well tested in this setting. Despite the lack of proven benefit for some of these therapies, they are still frequently used in current clinical practice. Management of postoperative Afib is initially directed at ventricular rate control, but the ultimate goal is return to sinus rhythm. The approach to therapy depends on several clinical variables, including the time course of the arrhythmia, but hemodynamic stability of the patient is the key issue. Return to sinus rhythm may be difficult to achieve early after surgery, so opting for rate control is the best initial approach. If tolerated, beta-adrenergic blockade and calcium antagonism are the best first options. Class IA and III antiarrhythmic drugs should be reserved for persistent or poorly tolerated and prolonged episodes of Afib. Elective cardioversion, either by direct current or with drugs, should be delayed for as long as possible after surgery. Anticoagulation for post-CABG Afib remains controversial. More prudent use of presently available drugs to treat Afib could reduce morbidity, cost, and duration of hospital stay after CABG. More rapid-acting and reliably effective antiarrhythmic therapies with minimal adverse effects would greatly improve management of post-CABG Afib.",

Compared with healthy controls, patients exhibited significant elevated concentrations of triglycerides (226 +/- 86 vs. 146 +/- 73 mg/dl) and fasting insulin (22.2 +/- 1.8 vs. 9.8 +/- 4.6 microU/ml).",

Fasting blood glucose levels, insulin, fructosamine, HbA1c and free fatty acids remained unchanged.

    "128": "Up to now, transgenic mice models created to study the physiological impact of alterations in the human beta-adrenoceptor system have only focused on cardiac tissues and carried hybrid transgenes with strong cardiac promoters. We have developed a transgenic mouse strain (F28) carrying the human beta 2-adrenoceptor gene with its natural promoter region with the aim of producing a model that more closely reproduces the natural human beta 2-adrenoceptor tissue expression pattern. By means of northern blot analyses, using the appropriate probes, we have obtained evidence that (a) the human beta 2-adrenoceptor's structural gene is transcribed in several tissues of F28 mice; (b) the tissue distribution pattern of human beta 2-adrenoceptor mRNA in F28 mice completely differs from that of mouse beta 2-adrenoceptor mRNA; and (c) the tissue distribution pattern of mouse beta 2-adrenoceptor mRNA in F28 mice is very similar to that observed in their non-transgenic littermates. Like humans, F28 mice express human beta 2-adrenoceptor mRNA in liver, lung, brain, heart, and muscle. However, unlike humans, F28 mice do not accumulate human beta 2-adrenoceptor mRNA in kidney and spleen. By using [125I]iodocyanopindolol to label all beta-adrenoceptors and ICI 118,551 to discriminate between the binding to beta 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptors we have demonstrated that the beta 2-adrenoceptor binding activity increases over control values in F28 mouse tissues that accumulate transgenic mRNA. Accordingly, the number of beta 2-adrenoceptors increased slightly over the control values in muscle, heart, brain, and lung of F28 mice, while in liver these receptors were strongly overexpressed. We further showed that transgene beta 2-adrenoceptors couple to GTP-binding proteins, mediate beta-adrenoceptor agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activation, and cause a strong enhancement of this response in liver membranes of F28 versus control mice. Finally, F28 mice show a phenotype of depressed ponderal development and perturbed hindquarter movements. This unique model should be useful to further investigate beta 2-adrenoceptor causal relationships with human pathologies.",

Stimulation of Tau release by ammonia, but not by 65 mM potassium, was correlated with a dose-dependent increase of intracellular cAMP levels. The release, as measured at 5 mM ammonia, was abolished by compounds that prevented cAMP increase: an adenylate cyclase inhibitor, miconazole, a protein kinase A inhibitor HA 1004, an anion channel blocker, niflumic acid, and a Tau transport site agonist, beta-alanine. The release by ammonia differed from potassium-induced release in its resistance to 1) increase of medium tonicity by addition of 50 mM sucrose; 2) addition of the anion/cation cotransport blocker, furosemide; and 3) removal of calcium from the superfusion medium. The results suggest that ammonia-induced Tau release is mediated by intracellular accumulation of cAMP and may occur either via an osmoresistant, cAMP-controlled channel or a cAMP-activated Tau transporter. The release observed at the physiological concentration of ammonium chloride suggest a role for ammonia as a signal molecule.", 
    "130": "We studied the effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation on the formation of adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and on the cell volume in Rana ridibunda red blood cells under O2 (high oxygen atmosphere) and under N2 (hypoxia) gases. Adrenergic stimulation caused the accumulation of cAMP and the swelling of R. ridibunda erythrocytes. 10(-5) M adrenaline and 10(-5) M isoproterenol seem to be the more efficient concentration in causing greater cell swelling. The amount of cAMP required for adrenergic swelling was minimal; swelling was observed at cAMP concentrations higher than 20 nM. Maximal swelling was seen when the cellular cAMP concentration reached 40 nM at high oxygen atmosphere. Isoproterenol caused a greater increase in water content than adrenaline. At hypoxic conditions the water content and cAMP concentrations obtained after stimulation with adrenaline and isoproterenol were greater than at high oxygen atmosphere. Since the adrenergic response seems to be blocked both by prazosin and propranolole the adrenoreceptors of R. ridibunda red cells may be classified as alpha 1- and beta-receptors. The enhancement of cAMP and cell swelling may be either due to an increase in the number of adrenoreceptors, or to increased responsiveness of the erythrocyte Na(+)-H+ antiporter to catecholamines during hypoxia. These responses are believed to enhance blood oxygen transport during periods of increased oxygen demands.", 
    "131": "Glucose was found to induce large amplitude oscillations of cytoplasmic Sr2+ and Ca2+ in individual pancreatic beta-cells exposed to the respective cation. Subsequent addition of 20 nM glucagon or other agents raising cAMP triggered pronounced transients superimposed upon the large amplitude oscillations. Hyperpolarization with diazoxide prevented both the large amplitude oscillations and the superimposed transients. After short exposure to carbachol or ATP there was a temporary, and after addition of the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin a permanent, disappearance of the transients with persistence of the glucose-induced large amplitude oscillations. The Ca2+ channel blocker methoxyverapamil exhibited opposite specificity in preventing the large amplitude oscillations under conditions when the transients often remained. In the presence of methoxyverapamil the transients disappeared during diazoxide hyperpolarization and were restored by subsequent K+ depolarization, which also elevated the content of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) by 45%. The glucagon-induced transients were obliterated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, insensitive to ryanodine and paradoxically inhibited by high concentrations of caffeine. The IP3-mediated intracellular ion mobilization induced by carbachol was amplified by glucagon. The results indicate that depolarization-dependent formation of IP3 causes intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in individual beta-cells when the IP3 receptors are sensitized by cAMP. This mechanism may be an important determinant for the electrophysiological burst activity in intact pancreatic islets due to the presence of endogenous glucagon.", 
    "132": "Left ventricular systolic function is reduced during episodes of silent ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is increased at least 5 absolute percent during exercise in most normal subjects; however, in patients with CAD, LVEF often remains unchanged or decreases. The anti-ischemic effect of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade is well documented, including a reduction of exercise-induced electrocardiographic ST depressions; however, the effect of these drugs on left ventricular volume changes during exercise in patients with silent ischemia is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a cardio-selective beta-blocking agent, metoprolol, on rest and exercise LVEF in patients with silent ischemia, using radionuclide cardiography. Fifteen patients with silent ischemia completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study at rest and during submaximal exercise. LVEF remained unchanged during exercise in the placebo phase (56% to 58%; p = NS), but even though LVEF tended to decrease 56% during rest after metoprolol versus 52% after placebo (p = NS), the LVEF increase from rest to exercise resembled a normal LVEF response, 52% to 58% (p = 0.005). Exercise-induced electrocardiographic ST depressions were also reduced during metoprolol treatment. In patients with silent ischemia, the exercise-induced change in LVEF rises significantly during metoprolol treatment. The mechanism may be a reduction in myocardial ischemia as indicated by a reduction in ischemic electrocardiographic findings."
