    "2": "The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate, on an intention-to-treat basis, the efficacy of d,l-sotalol and metoprolol with regards to the recurrence of arrhythmic events after implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation. After ICD implantation, 70 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either metoprolol (mean dosage 104+/-37 mg/day in 35 patients) or d,l-sotalol (mean dosage 242+/-109 mg/day in 35 patients). During follow up ventricular tachycardia (VT), fast VT, and ventricular fibrillation (VF) episodes were calculated. Metoprolol treatment led to a marked reduction in the recurrence of arrhythmic events. Actuarial rates for absence of VT recurrence at 1 and 2 years were significantly higher in the metoprolol group compared with the d,l-sotalol group (83% and 80% vs 57% and 51%, respectively, p=0.016). The actuarial rates for absence of fast VT or VF were 80% in the metoprolol group compared with 46% in the d,l-sotalol group (p=0.002). During a follow up of 26+/-16 months, there were 3 deaths in the metoprolol group compared with 6 deaths in the d,l-sotalol group. Actuarial rates of overall survival were not significantly different in the 2 groups (91% vs 83%, p=0.287). In this prospective, randomized, controlled study the recurrence rate of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients treated with metoprolol was lower than in patients treated by d,l-sotolol.",

    "11": "The development of a nonsurgical repeatable method of site-specific delivery to the gastrointestinal tract in the canine is described. Studies to characterize and validate this method were performed utilizing propranolol and etodolac due to their well-known pharmacokinetic properties. Using a catheter placed through the auxiliary port of a flexible fiberoptic endoscope, liquid dosage formulations were consistently delivered to the canine stomach, duodenum, ileum, and colon. It was shown that differences in site-specific delivery could be demonstrated with this model. Propranolol tended to have the highest exposure following dosing to the ileum as compared to other sites. The anesthetic regimen used to perform endoscopy affected certain pharmacokinetic parameters of the compounds being tested including decreasing the intrinsic clearance of propranolol. However, since decreased intrinsic clearance should similarly affect AUCo regardless of the site of delivery, this does not preclude site-specific comparisons to be made. Further, no evidence has been reported for the effect of anesthesia on one GI segment but not another. Thus for other compounds, assuming there are either no anesthetic effects on intestinal pharmacokinetic parameters (absorption, intestinal metabolism, etc.) or that they are consistent and uniform throughout the intestinal tract, this model allows comparisons of the exposure following delivery to differing intestinal sites.", 
    "12": "The aim of this study was to determine whether the blockade of beta-adrenoceptors would enhance cAMP-mediated signal transduction processes in vivo. The administration of the membrane permeable cAMP analogue, 8-(4-chlorophenylthiol)-cAMP (8-CPT-cAMP, 10 micromol/kg, i.v.) produced an increase in heart rate (+27 +/- 2%, P < 0.05), a fall in mean arterial blood pressure (-21 +/- 3%, P < 0.05) and falls in hindquarter (-12 +/- 3%, P < 0.05) and mesenteric (-32 +/- 3%, P < 0.05) vascular resistances in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.) lowered heart rate (-12 +/- 3%, P < 0.05) but did not affect mean arterial blood pressure or vascular resistances. The tachycardia, hypotension and vasodilation produced by 8-CPT-cAMP were exaggerated after administration of propranolol (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). The nitric oxide-donor, sodium nitroprusside (2 microg/kg, i.v.), produced falls in mean arterial blood pressure and vascular resistances of similar magnitude to those produced by 8-CPT-cAMP. These sodium nitroprusside-induced responses were unaffected by propranolol (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Sodium nitroprusside also produced a minor increase in heart rate (+5 +/- 1%, P < 0.05) which was abolished by propranolol. These findings suggest that 8-CPT-cAMP directly increases heart rate and that blockade of beta-adrenoceptors enhances the potency of cAMP within the heart and vasculature.",

In addition, a progressive maximal exercise test was performed after the treatments.", 
    "16": "Propranolol reduced heart rate, cardiac output and arterial pulse wave velocity, and increased systemic vascular resistance clearly more effectively than placebo. In addition, captopril effectively decreased arterial resistance and pulse wave velocity. However, the influence of verapamil on cardiovascular parameters did not significantly differ from those observed in placebo-treated subjects.

    "18": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of valsartan, a new angiotensin II receptor antagonist, versus atenolol in the treatment of severe primary hypertension. A total of 103 adult out-patients were randomised to receive either valsartan 160 mg or atenolol 100 mg once daily for 6 weeks. If necessary, additional blood pressure (BP) control could be provided as add-on therapy. Both valsartan and atenolol decreased mean sitting diastolic BP (DBP) and mean sitting systolic BP (SBP): least squares mean change from baseline in DBP; valsartan, -20.0 mm Hg; atenolol, -20.4 mm Hg: in SBP; valsartan, -30.0 mm Hg; atenolol, -25.5 mm Hg. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups. Add-on hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg was required by 97.2% of patients receiving atenolol and 83.6% of patients receiving valsartan; additional verapamil SR 240 mg was also required by 58.3% of patients receiving atenolol and 64.2% receiving valsartan. Valsartan was well tolerated, with a comparable incidence of treatment-related adverse experiences in both groups. In conclusion valsartan 160 mg is as well tolerated and effective as atenolol 100 mg in lowering BP in severely hypertensive patients.",

    "27": "Adenosine attenuates the myocardial metabolic and contractile responses induced by ss-adrenergic stimulation. Our study was conducted to investigate the longevity of this antiadrenergic action after adenosine exposure. Adenosine (33 micromol/L) was infused into isolated perfused rat hearts for 1, 5, 30, or 60 minutes, and the adrenergic responsiveness (AR) to isoproterenol (10(-8) mol/L) was determined at the end of each infusion period and during a 45-minute adenosine washout period. Interstitial levels of adenosine, as determined from epicardial surface transudates, returned to preinfusion levels within 10 minutes of washout. The duration of adenosine infusion had no effect on the extent of attenuation of AR at the end of the infusion. Whereas AR returned to preadenosine levels with washout of shorter adenosine infusions (1 and 5 minutes), there was a slow and incomplete recovery of AR after the longer exposures (30 and 60 minutes) to adenosine. The magnitude of this persistent antiadrenergic effect (PAE) of adenosine at 15 minutes of washout was proportional to the epicardial concentration of adenosine during infusion of the nucleoside. Infusion of adenosine either with the nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist 8-p-sulfophenyl theophylline or with the selective A1-receptor antagonist 1,3-dipropyl, 8-cyclopentylxanthine, abolished the PAE during the washout period. In addition, the PAE could be demonstrated only with the selective A1-receptor agonist 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine and not with the selective A3-receptor agonist 4-aminobenzyl-5'-N methylcarboxamido-adenosine. When the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine was coadministered with adenosine, the PAE of adenosine was not apparent during adenosine washout. A 30-minute infusion of phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist that enhances PKC activity, produced a PAE that lasted for up to 30 minutes of washout. This effect was prevented by the coinfusion of chelerythrine. Thus, it is concluded that the PAE of adenosine is determined by the myocardial concentration of this nucleoside and is manifested when myocardial concentrations of adenosine returned to baseline levels. Moreover, a 5-minute duration of adenosine exposure is required for the expression of the PAE. This latter effect seems to be dependent on adenosine-induced PKC activation via A1-receptors.", 
    "28": "We studied the mechanisms of retinal and choroidal vasorelaxation elicited by nitric oxide (NO) using piglet eyes. The NO donors sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and diethylamine-NONOate caused comparable concentration-dependent relaxation that was partially (approximately 40%) attenuated by the guanylate cyclase inhibitors methylene blue and LY83583 and reduced to a lesser extent (approximately 25%) by the inhibitor of cGMP-dependent kinase, KT 5823. In contrast, NO-induced dilatation (by NO donors and endogenous NO after stimulation with bradykinin) was substantially (approximately 70%) diminished by the KCa channel blockers tetraethylammonium (TEA), charybdotoxin, and iberiotoxin; by the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin and ibuprofen; by the prostaglandin I (PGI2) synthase inhibitor trans-2-phenyl cyclopropylamine (TPC); and by the removal of endothelium; whereas relaxation of endothelium-denuded vasculature to SNP was unaltered by indomethacin, TPC, and charybdotoxin but was nearly nullified by methylene blue and the Kv channel blocker 4-aminopyridine. NO donors significantly increased PGI2 synthesis and the putative PGI2 receptor-coupled second messenger cAMP, from ocular vasculature (retinal microvessels and choroidal perfusate), and this increase in PGI2 formation was markedly reduced by TPC, tetraethylammonium, charybdotoxin, and/or the removal of endothelium, but it was only slightly reduced by methylene blue and LY83583. Also, SNP and KCa channel openers NS1619 and NS004 caused an increase in PGI2 synthesis in cultured endothelial cells, which was virtually abolished by KCa blockers. Finally, vasorelaxation to a cGMP analogue, 8-bromo cGMP, and protein kinase G stimulant beta-phenyl-1,N2-etheno-8-bromoguanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate was mostly Kv dependent and, in contrast to NO, largely unrelated to PGI2 formation. In conclusion, data indicate that NO-induced ocular vasorelaxation is partly mediated by cGMP through its action on smooth muscle, and more importantly, by stimulating PGI2 formation of endothelial origin via a mechanism mostly independent of guanylate cyclase, which involves the opening of a KCa channel.", 
    "29": "Anorectic drugs are increasingly being used in obesity to induce and/or maintain weight loss. We have focused on the development of metabolic enhancers. These compounds increase energy expenditure, which is important because weight loss is associated with metabolic re-adjustment to reduce energy output. Thus, metabolic enhancers ensure that energy expenditure is maintained when food intake is reduced. Beta3-adrenoceptor agonists are thermogenic agents that increase energy output by stimulating heat generation. Early selective beta3-agonists were effective in producing weight loss in obese rats, but were largely ineffective in humans. In addition, many interacted with other types of beta receptor to produce side-effects. The development of a Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO) transfection system, using the human beta3-adrenoceptor gene, resulted in potential new selective human beta3-agonists being identified. However, the in vitro activity of these agents does not necessarily reflect their action in vivo, due to the presence of other receptor types and G proteins in the target cells, and interactions between them. The characterization of a selective beta3-antagonist, SR59230A, has allowed us to examine beta3-agonist activity in different experimental systems. The CHO transfection system has been used to show that SR59230A is effective in blocking agonist activity against both the rat adrenoceptor, and three human beta3-receptor isoforms. In addition, SR59230A shows competitive inhibition of agonist activity in both rat and human model systems. This antagonist may therefore provide a pharmacological tool for the functional study of by newly identified beta3-receptor agonists.", 
    "30": "Pro-convulsant withdrawal properties have been reported for a variety of GABA-modulatory drugs, such as the benzodiazepines (BDZs, [S.E. File, The history of BDZ dependence: a review of animal studies, Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 14 (1990) 135-146; P.R. Finley, P. E. Nolan, Precipitation of BDZ withdrawal following sudden discontinuation of midazolam, DICP 23 (1989) 151-152]), barbiturates and ethanol [N. Kokka, D.E. Sapp, U. Witte, R.W. Olsen, Sex differences in sensitivity to pentylenetetrazol but not in GABAA receptor binding, Pharm. Biochem. Behav. 43 (1992) 441-447]. In this report, we test the hypothesis that pro-convulsant effects are produced by withdrawal from the GABA-modulatory neurosteroid 3alpha-OH-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP) after sustained exposure to elevated circulating levels of its parent compound progesterone (P). Seizure activity was precipitated by picrotoxin or with the BDZ inverse agonist n-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (beta-CC), and a seizure rating determined 24 h after abrupt discontinuation of P following a multiple withdrawal/chronic administration paradigm. In some cases, a pseudopregnant rat model was employed to produce increased ovarian production of P prior to withdrawal (ovariectomy). Rats undergoing P withdrawal exhibited greater seizure-like activity than vehicle-treated controls, and received seizure scores in the same range as rats undergoing BDZ withdrawal. Administration of a 5alpha-reductase blocker, MK-906, along with P, prevented this pro-convulsant effect of P withdrawal, suggesting that the GABA-modulatory 3alpha,5alpha-THP is the active compound responsible for this withdrawal effect. Combined administration of P and diazepam produced synergistic effects upon withdrawal and produced a seizure score higher than observed after withdrawal from either agent alone. These results suggest that P exhibits withdrawal properties via the neuroactive steroid 3alpha, 5alpha-THP, that include exacerbation of seizure activity. These results may have clinical relevance, as increased incidence and severity of seizures has been reported in susceptible women during times of declining circulating levels of P across the menstrual cycle [T. Backstrom, B. Zetterlund, S. Blom, M. Romano, Effects of intravenous progesterone infusions on the epileptic discharge frequency in women with partial epilepsy, Acta Neurol. Scand. 69 (1984) 240-248; A.G. Herzog, Progesterone therapy in women with complex partial and secondary generalized seizures, Neurology 45 (1995) 1660-1662].", 
    "31": "We evaluated the hypotheses that on acute exposure to hypobaric hypoxia, sympathetic stimulation leads to augmented muscle lactate production and circulating [lactate] through a beta-adrenergic mechanism and that beta-adrenergic adaptation to chronic hypoxia is responsible for the blunted exercise lactate response after acclimatization to altitude. Five control and 6 beta-blocked men were studied during rest and exercise at sea level (SL), on acute exposure to 4,300 m (A1), and after a 3-wk sojourn at altitude (A2). Exercise was by leg cycling at 49% of SL peak O2 consumption (VO2 peak) (65% of altitude VO2 peak or 87 +/- 2.6 W); beta-blockade was by propranolol (80 mg 3x daily), femoral arterial and venous blood was sampled; leg blood flow (Q) was measured by thermodilution, leg lactate net release [ = (2) (1-leg Q) venous-arterial concentrationL] was calculated, and vastus lateralis needle biopsies were obtained. Muscle [lactate] increased with exercise and acute altitude exposure but regressed to SL values with acclimatization; beta-blockade had no effect on muscle [lactate]. Arterial [lactate] rose during exercise at SL (0.9 +/- 0.1 to 1.5 +/- 0.3 mM); exercise at A1 produced the greatest arterial [lactate] (4.4 +/- 0.8 mM), and exercise at A2 an intermediate response (2.1 +/- 0.6 mM). beta-Blockade reduced circulating [lactate] approximately 45% during exercise under all altitude conditions. increased transiently at exercise onset but then declined over time under all conditions. Blood and muscle \"lactate paradoxes\" occurred independent of beta-adrenergic influences, and the hypotheses relating the blood lactate response at altitude to beta-adrenergic mechanisms are rejected. During exercise at altitude, arterial [lactate] is determined by factors in addition to hypoxemia, circulating epinephrine, and net lactate release from active muscle beds.", 
    "32": "It has been reported that arginine vasopressin (AVP) plays a thermoregulatory action, but very little is known about the mechanisms involved. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that nitric oxide (NO) plays a role in systemic AVP-induced hypothermia. Rectal temperature was measured before and after AVP, AVP blocker, or NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; NO synthase inhibitor) injection. Control animals received saline injections of the same volume. The basal body temperature (Tb) measured in control animals was 36.53 +/- 0.08 degreesC. We observed a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in Tb to 35.44 +/- 0.19 degreesC after intravenous injection of AVP (2 micrograms/kg) and to 35.74 +/- 0. 10 degreesC after intravenous injection of L-NAME (30 mg/kg). The systemic injection of the AVP blocker [beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionyl1,O-Et-Tyr2,Val4,Arg8]vasopressin (10 micrograms/kg) caused a significant increase in Tb to 37.33 +/- 0.23 degreesC, indicating that AVP plays a tonic role by reducing Tb. When the treatments with AVP and L-NAME were combined, systemically injected L-NAME blunted AVP-induced hypothermia. To assess the role of central thermoregulatory mechanisms, a smaller dose of L-NAME (1 mg/kg) was injected into the third cerebral ventricle. Intracerebroventricular injection of L-NAME caused an increase in Tb, but when intracerebroventricular L-NAME was combined with systemic AVP injection (2 micrograms/kg), no change in Tb was observed. The data indicate that central NO plays a major role mediating systemic AVP-induced hypothermia.", 
    "33": "We investigated the proarrhythmic effects of MS-551 and KCB-328, class III antiarrhythmic drugs using adrenaline-induced arrhythmia models in halothane anaesthetized, closed-chest dogs. In the control period, adrenaline, starting from a low dose of 0.25 to up to 1.0 microg/kg/50 s i.v., was injected to determine the arrhythmia inducing dose and the non-inducing dose. After MS-551 or KCB-328 administration, the adrenaline injection was repeated and the interval between the injection and the occurrence of arrhythmia (latent interval), the changes in arrhythmic ratio (as calculated by dividing the number of ventricular premature contraction by the number of the total heart rate) and the severity of arrhythmia were observed. MS-551 infusion, 1 mg/kg/30 min, decreased the heart rate (HR) by 16% (P<0.01) and prolonged the QTc interval by 20% (P<0.01). During the 30 min of MS-551 infusion, arrhythmias occurred in three out of seven dogs (torsades de pointes (TdP) type VT in one dog). After these arrhythmias disappeared, MS-551 decreased the latent interval of the adrenaline arrhythmias produced by the inducing dose (30+/-2 s compared with 43+/-3 s of the control interval, P < 0.05), increased the arrhythmic ratio (P<0.05) and induced arrhythmias by non-inducing adrenaline doses (P<0.05). Effect of a new class III drug KCB-328 infusion, 0.3 mg/kg/30 min, was compared witih MS-551 using the same model. KCB-328 decreased the HR by 21% (P<0.01) and prolonged the QTc interval by 25% (P<0.01). During the 30 min of infusion, arrhythmias occurred in five out of seven dogs (TdP in two dogs). KCB-328 also decreased the latent interval of the adrenaline arrhythmias produced by the inducing doses (31+/-3 s compared with 49+/-7 s of the control period, P<0.05), but did not significantly alter the arrhythmic ratio. Adrenaline induced TdP only after MS-551 or KCB-328 was administered, i.e. after MS-551, 1 mg/kg/30 min, 3/7 versus 0/7 in the control; KCB, 0.3 mg/kg/30 min, 3/7 versus 0/7 in the control. To examine the direct arrhythmogenic effect of MS-551 and whether an adrenergic mechanism plays some role on this arrhythmogenesis, a bolus injection of MS-551, 3 mg/kg, was injected either without pre-treatment or after pre-treatment with propranolol 0.3 mg/kg. MS-551 induced arrhythmias in five out of seven dogs (TdP in one dog). Also in the propranolol pre-treated dogs, MS-551 induced arrhythmias in five out of seven dogs (TdP in 1 dog). In conclusion, these observations indicate that MS-551 and KCB-328 induced arrhythmias and intensified proarrhythmic effects of adrenaline, MS-551 being stronger than KCB-328 at the same QTc prolonging doses. The direct arrhythmogenic effect of MS-551 was not influenced by beta-blocker treatment.", 
    "34": "The beta3-adrenoceptor plays an important role in the adrenergic response of brown and white adipose tissues (BAT and WAT). In this study, in vitro metabolic responses to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation were compared in adipose tissues of beta3-adrenoceptor knockout and wild type mice. The measured parameters were BAT fragment oxygen uptake (MO2) and isolated white adipocyte lipolysis. In BAT of wild type mice (-)-norepinephrine maximally stimulated MO2 4.1+/-0.8 fold. Similar maximal stimulations were obtained with beta1-, beta2- or beta3-adrenoceptor selective agonists (dobutamine 5.1+/-0.3, terbutaline 5.3+/-0.3 and CL 316,243 4.8+/-0.9 fold, respectively); in BAT of beta3-adrenoceptor knockout mice, the beta1- and beta2-responses were fully conserved. In BAT of wild type mice, the beta1/beta2-antagonist and beta3-partial agonist CGP 12177 elicited a maximal MO2 response (4.7+/-0.4 fold). In beta3-adrenoceptor knockout BAT, this response was fully conserved despite an absence of response to CL 316,243. This unexpected result suggests that an atypical beta-adrenoceptor, distinct from the beta1-, beta2- and beta3-subtypes and referred to as a putative beta4-adrenoceptor is present in BAT and that it can mediate in vitro a maximal MO2 stimulation. In isolated white adipocytes of wild type mice, (-)-epinephrine maximally stimulated lipolysis 12.1+/-2.6 fold. Similar maximal stimulations were obtained with beta1-, beta2- or beta3-adrenoceptor selective agonists (TO509 12+/-2, procaterol 11+/-3, CL 316,243 11+/-3 fold, respectively) or with CGP 12177 (7.1+/-1.5 fold). In isolated white adipocytes of beta3-adrenoceptor knockout mice, the lipolytic responses to (-)epinephrine, to the beta1-, beta2-, beta3-adrenoceptor selective agonists and to CGP 12177 were almost or totally depressed, whereas those to ACTH, forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP were conserved.", 
    "35": "Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, performed for the control of angina pectoris, leads to postoperative relief from symptoms in most patients. Amelioration of ischemia and improvement in exercise capacity after CABG are well documented. However, patients currently undergoing CABG are more complex than in the past--they are older and are maintained on medical therapy for longer periods. A large number of these patients have had one or more previous myocardial revascularization procedures. The post-operative period would appear to be a time of vulnerability for coronary events. However, previous investigators have focused on the pre- and intraoperative aspects of peri-CABG ischemia. Outcome data suggest that the postoperative interval is at least equally important as a determinant of short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. We discuss the epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of ischemic syndromes in the postoperative period after CABG. In addition, we review recent data from a series of 14 patients, observed at our institution, who underwent cardiac catheterization and, in some cases, angioplasty of the culprit vessel in the immediate postoperative period.",

    "41": "In this double-blind, randomized study, we administered betaxolol (a) or placebo (b) ocularly to 131 patients scheduled for cataract surgery. The patients were randomly divided into ten groups. In groups 1a and 1b, the drug was scheduled to be instilled 1-2 h, in groups 2a and 2b 12 h, in groups 3a and 3b 24 h, and in groups 4a and 4b 48 h before surgery. The pupil was dilated in all eyes prior to surgery. The IOP was measured with Perkins' applanation tonometer before the instillation of the drug and just before the peribulbar block. Twenty microlitres of 0.5% betaxolol or placebo solution was instilled into the eye. IOP was also measured before instillation of the drug and after 1 2 h in undilated eyes of 20 patients, whose contralateral eye was to be operated on, to rule out the effect of pupil dilation on IOP (groups 5a and 5b). Aqueous humour betaxolol concentrations were analysed using a radioreceptor assay.", 
    "42": "Betaxolol did not decrease IOP significantly in eyes with pupillary dilation. Both betaxolol and placebo decreased IOP significantly in patients without pupillary dilation, the effect of betaxolol being slightly more pronounced. The betaxolol concentration in aqueous humour was 731 ng m-1 in group la, 2.4 h after drug instillation. Measurable concentrations of betaxolol were also detected in aqueous humour in group 4a 47.7 h after drug administration.",

A single betaxolol dose did not decrease IOP significantly in patients undergoing cataract surgery, but the IOP decreasing effect was, however, clearly seen in patients who did not receive mydriatic drugs. The routine use of topical betaxolol prior to cataract surgery to decrease IOP is not recommended.", 
    "44": "1. Effects of tetrapentylammonium ions (TPA+) on contractile responses induced by electric field stimulation and by exogenous agonist such as noradrenaline, ATP and high K+ were examined in the isolated epididymal half of the rat vas deferens. 2. The electrically evoked monophasic contractions (0.5 Hz, 1 ms pulse duration, 40 V) were potentiated by TPA+ at low concentrations (1-3 microM) and inhibited by TPA+ at a concentration greater than 10 microM. 3. TPA+ (0.3-3 microM) potentiated the contractile responses induced by noradrenaline and ATP, whilst, TPA+ (10 microM) concentration-dependently reduced the agonist-induced contractions. TEA+ enhanced both electrically evoked and agonist-induced contractions. 4. TPA+ (0.3 microM) potentiated 30 mM K+-induced phasic contraction which was inhibited by pretreatment with alpha,beta-methylene ATP (3 microM) and prazosin (3 microM). 5. TPA+ (10-300 microM) reduced the contractions induced by 100 mM extracellular K+ while TBA+ and TEA+ had no effect. 6. The present results show that TPA+ at low concentrations may act at prejunctional nerve membranes to enhance release of contractile transmitters and act as a putative K+ channel blocker at postjunctional membranes to increase muscle contractility in rat vas deferens; whilst at high concentrations TPA+ mainly acts on smooth muscle probably as a non-selective relaxant against the agonist-induced contraction probably through inhibition of Ca2+ influx; this inhibitory effect appears unique for TPA+ since TEA+ and TBA+ did not induce muscle relaxation.", 
    "45": "1. The present authors recently found that a marked hyperpnoea-induced bronchoconstriction (HIB) only occurred in guinea-pigs after treatment with propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. This study investigated tachykinin-dependent and antioxidant-modulated mechanisms for this propranolol-augmented HIB. 2. Guinea-pigs were pre-treated with an antioxidant, dimethylthiourea (DMTU), or saline for 3 days. On the day of study, each animal was given a dose of propranolol (0.5 mg kg(-1)), then the airway function was examined in the anaesthetized-paralysed animal before, during and after hyperpnoea with a dry 95% O2:5% CO2 gas mixture. Tracheal neutral endopeptidase (NEP) activity and plasma substance P (SP) level were measured after functional study. 3. In the presence of propranolol, HIB was augmented, and was found to be associated with decreased NEP activity and an increased plasma SP level. The augmented HIB was attenuated by DMTU. 4. Therefore, the present results suggest that propranolol-augmented HIB is tachykinin-dependent and is modulated by DMTU.",

    "47": "Oral metoprolol (30-150 mg/day) was added to conventional therapy in 14 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of <0.45, and New York Heart Association class II or III. Norepinephrine plasma levels, which are an index of sympathetic activation, decreased by 27.57 +/- 18.03% after 1 month (P < .005), but returned to pretreatment levels after 6 months. LVEF increased by 7.7 +/- 6.0 ejection fraction units after 6 months (P < .005 vs baseline and P < .05 vs 1 month). Long-term beta-blockade resulted in nonsignificant improvements in functional class, symptom score, and oxygen consumption at peak exercise. After 1 month, the reduction in plasma norepinephrine levels and the changes in LVEF were inversely correlated (P < .01). No other correlation emerged during short- or long-term treatment.", 
    "48": "In conclusion, the reduction in plasma norepinephrine levels during short-term beta-blockade was not proportional to the clinical benefits and may have been attributed to the direct inhibition of sympathetic outflow. The early reduction in circulating norepinephrine levels may decrease cardiac performance through withdrawal of sympathetic support when the favorable effects of beta-blockade have not had time to occur. The role that sympathetic modulation may exert in the long-term clinical benefits of metoprolol deserves further investigation.", 
    "49": "We experienced two cases of circulatory failure after local infiltration of 0.0005% epinephrine solution for the purpose of prophylactic hemostasis during tonsillectomy under sevoflurane anesthesia. Case 1: A 14 year-old girl developed ventricular bigeminy, tachycardia and hypertension following infiltration of the epinephrine solution 6ml around the tonsil. Sinus rhythm returned with intravenous lidocaine 40 mg and propranolol 0.4 mg. However, the patient showed gradually decreasing heart rate, depressed ST segments and inverted T waves and poor peripheral circulation. Her blood pressure decreased abruptly at the same time and finally the pulsation of the radial and femoral arteries was not palpable. She was treated with intravenous ephedrine in vain. Therefore, she received intravenous epinephrine and cardiac massage, and then recovered from the circulatory failure with her ECG showing normal sinus rhythms. Emergence from the anesthesia was smooth. Her cardiac failure may have been caused by the decreasing cardiac contraction and the increasing afterload due to the vasoconstriction after the intravenous beta-blocker. Case 2: An eleven year-old boy showed ventricular tachycardia and hypertension after infiltration of the epinephrine solution 11.5 ml around the tonsil. Lidocaine was given intravenously. This restored sinus rhythm but the ST segments on his ECG were elevated. ST segments became normalized after intravenous nitroglycerin. However, pulmonary edema developed suddenly, and it was cured by intensive treatment. His ventricular tachycardia and hypertension after the local administration of epinephrine were presumably responsible for the acute heart failure causing the pulmonary edema. Our experience suggests that the maintenance of cardiac function and the reduction of afterload are important to overcome the circulatory disaster following the local infiltration of epinephrine.", 
    "50": "To determine whether 123I-MIBG (MIBG) scintigraphy is useful for predicting the effect of beta-blocker therapy in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), we studied MIBG scintigraphy in 11 controls and 9 patients with DCM before starting beta-blocker therapy. First, initial and delayed heart-to-mediastinum ratios (H/M ratio) of MIBG activity in patients with DCM were significantly lower than those in 11 controls, respectively (initial H/M; 1.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.3, p < 0.02, delayed H/M; 1.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.2, p < 0.0001), and MIBG washout rate from the heart was significantly higher in patients than in controls (washout rate; 33 +/- 7% vs. 22 +/- 4%, p < 0.0005). Second, beta-blocker therapy improved LVEF in 7 patients (improved group), while it resulted in deterioration of heart failure, followed by death in 2 patients (deteriorated group). Although initial and delayed H/M ratios in the improved group were not significantly different from those in the deteriorated group, respectively, MIBG washout rate was significantly higher in the deteriorated group than in the improved group (45 +/- 8% vs. 30 +/- 3%, p = 0.04). Our study suggests that DCM patients with markedly rapid MIBG clearance may be deteriorated by beta-blocker therapy. In contrast, there were no differences in LVEF and plasma norepinephrine between improved and deteriorated groups. In conclusion, 123I-MIBG scintigraphy is useful for predicting the effects of beta-blocker therapy in patients with DCM.", 
    "51": "The effect of urocortin (UCN), a recently characterized mammalian member of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-related peptide and a putative endogenous ligand for CRF type 2 beta receptor in the regulation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) release, was investigated using cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Treatment with UCN (10(-10)-10(-6)M) resulted in significant increase in ANP and BNP secretions, and the effect of UCN on ANP and BNP secretions was more potent than that of CRF on an equimolar basis. The effect of UCN (10(-7)M) was completely blocked by alpha-helical CRF (9-41), a specific CRF type 2 receptor antagonist. The effect of UCN (10(-7)M) was not only blunted by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, H-89 (10(-5)M), but also diltiazem (10(-7)M), a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker. Further, UCN stimulated cAMP production in cardiomyocytes. Also, UCN (10(-7)M) itself stimulated [3H]leucine uptake into neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and potentiated endothelin-1-induced increase of [3H]leucine uptake. These results suggest that activation of CRF type 2 receptor, especially type 2 beta receptor, with UCN induces ANP and BNP secretions, at least in part, via PKA pathway during cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "52": "Drugs of choice in secondary prevention strategies reduce complication rates of certain diseases. Unfortunately, these strongly indicated drugs remain underused. A model was developed to predict the cost-effectiveness of clinical pharmacy services assumed to improve use of drugs of choice to unity in hypothetical cohorts of three diseases that commonly accompany hypertension and in which clear drugs of choice exist. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with diabetes who have proteinuria, use of beta blockers after myocardial infarction, and use of ACE inhibitors in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction were analyzed. Clinical pharmacy services could be cost-saving in all three diseases in this model if use of the drug of choice in standard practice did not exceed 0.899 in patients with diabetes who have proteinuria, 0.512 in patients after infarct, and 0.804 in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. This model may help decision makers by accessing local patient demographics and prescribing habits before any resource allocation.",

We used a database covering all prescriptions to elderly people to measure the change in proportion of newly treated patients who received each class of drug as first-line therapy. We used a matched cohort design for assessment of the teleconference and workshops, a randomised community design for the newsletters, and time-series analysis for the media impacts.",

This proportion was not affected by two waves of adverse news about CCBs in 1995, but fell by 5% for 5 months and by 3% for 1 month after two waves in 1996. The proportion of patients who received either a CCB or an ACE inhibitor as first-line therapy, contrary to guidelines, was still 42% overall in 1996.

    "57": "Nicotine use has been associated with augmented dopaminergic neurotransmission within the central nervous system by a number of researchers. We wished to determine if acute nicotine treatment would augment the pulmonary vasodilatory response to dopamine. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with either subcutaneous nicotine or equivolume saline and a dose-response curve for dopaminergic pulmonary vasodilation was constructed ex vivo in isolated, salt-perfused rat lungs preconstricted with the synthetic thromboxane analogue U-46619. Nicotine pretreatment augmented the vasodilatory response to dopamine at doses falling within the mid range of the dopamine dose-response relationship, and this augmentation was blocked by the nicotinic ganglionic receptor antagonist mecamylamine. In contrast, nicotine did not augment the vasodilatory response produced by either the preferential DA1-dopaminergic receptor agonist SKF-38393 or the preferential DA2-dopaminergic receptor agonist quinpirole. Acute nicotine pretreatment did not affect the maximal pulmonary vasodilatory response produced by dopamine. Similarly, nicotine pretreatment failed to augment the vasodilatory response to the beta-adrenergic receptor agonists isoproterenol or terbutaline, but significantly diminished the response to dobutamine. Even though acute nicotine pretreatment did not augment beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated pulmonary vasodilation, the augmentation of dopaminergic responsiveness was inhibited by prior treatment with propranolol, suggesting beta-adrenergic receptor involvement. Finally, nicotine pretreatment did not alter the vasodilation produced by the nitric oxide dependent agents arginine vasopressin or sodium nitroprusside. These data demonstrate that nicotine alters dopaminergic vasodilation in the pulmonary vascular bed.", 
    "58": "Lan and DeMets (1983, Biometrika 70, 659-663) proposed a flexible method for monitoring accumulating data that does not require the number and times of analyses to be specified in advance yet maintains an overall Type I error, alpha. Their method amounts to discretizing a preselected continuous boundary by clumping the density of the boundary crossing time at discrete analysis times and calculating the resultant discrete-time boundary values. In this framework, the cumulative distribution function of the continuous-time stopping rule is used as an alpha spending function. A key assumption that underlies this method is that future analysis times are not chosen on the basis of the current value of the statistic. However, clinical trials may be monitored more frequently when they are close to crossing the boundary. In this situation, the corresponding continuous-time boundary should be used. Here we demonstrate how to construct a continuous stopping boundary from an alpha spending function. This capability is useful in the design of clinical trials. We use the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT) and AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 021 for illustration.", 
    "59": "Tramadol is a clinically-effective, centrally-acting analgesic. This drug is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, each one displaying different mechanisms: (+)tramadol displays opioid agonist properties and inhibits serotonin reuptake while (-)tramadol inhibit preferentially noradrenaline reuptake. The action of tramadol on the monoaminergic reuptake is similar to that of antidepressant drugs. Therefore, we have examined the effects of (+/-)tramadol, (+)tramadol and (-)tramadol in a test predictive of antidepressant activity, the forced swimming test in mice. Both (+/-)tramadol and its (-) enantiomer displayed a dose-dependent reduction on immobility; while the effect induced by the (+) enantiomer was not significant. Inhibition of noradrenaline synthesis, but not of serotonin synthesis, was capable of blocking the effect of (+/-)tramadol. The alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine, as well as the alpha2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine, and the beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol countered the immobility-reducing action of (+/-)tramadol. Moreover, neither the serotoninergic blocker methysergide nor the opioid antagonist naloxone antagonized the effect of (+/-)tramadol. Our results show that (+/-)tramadol and (-)tramadol have antidepressant-like effect in mice, probably mediated by the noradrenergic system rather than the serotoninergic or opioidergic ones.", 
    "60": "A review of the results of randomised trials of the use of betablockers in acute myocardial infarction shows by techniques of meta-analysis that their prescription in the early hours of the acute event leads to a reduction in short-term mortality: the reduction of risk is 12% as compared with groups which are not given betablockers. In addition to its impact on mortality, early betablocker therapy is associated with a reduction in the risk of recurrence of myocardial infarction and a proven antalgic effect. However, in patients receiving thrombolysis, the beneficial effect on mortality and recurrence of infarction of intravenous betablockers seems less evident. In daily clinical practice, the prescription of betablockers in the first days of infarction has significantly increased over the last ten years. In the USIK trial carried out in France in November 1995, nearly two thirds of patients received betablocker therapy. In the same study, the prescription of betablockers is associated with a reduction in mortality independent of the classical risk factors and the prescription of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These results confirm the value of this therapeutic class in the acute phase of myocardial infarction.", 
    "61": "Antiarrhythmic therapy is a special case in the therapeutic strategy of acute myocardial infarction. There are very few controlled therapeutic trials and its use is mainly based on clinical experience rather than on scientific evidence. The most common arrhythmias requiring treatment in acute myocardial infarction are atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. There is no evidence to support the use Class I antiarrhythmics. Lidocain may be used in some cases. Similarly, contradictory results have been reported with the use of magnesium salts and the general tendency is not to use this ion in acute myocardial infarction. The most commonly used antiarrhythmic agents are the betablockers and amiodarone. The general principles of treatment should be respected: all antiarrhythmic drugs have negative inotropic effects, apart from digitalis. All antiarrhythmics may have a proarrhythmic effect including digitalis, especially in this clinical context. Whenever possible, continuous intravenous infusions are to be preferred to bolus injections. In addition, and when possible, electrotherapy is preferable to antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Finally, a number of cardiac arrhythmias observed in acute myocardial infarction should be \"respected\" or treated by electrotherapy but never by antiarrhythmic drugs.", 
    "62": "Ventricular tachycardia is rare and poorly understood in the neonate. The authors undertook a retrospective study in 2 foetus and 8 neonates aged 1 to 20 days at the time of diagnosis. The tachycardia was permanent in 2 cases, observed in runs of variable variation in the other 8, incessant in 7 of these cases. Only two cases were symptomatic: cardiac failure with shock 16 hours after birth and hydramnios at 16 weeks gestation. The electrocardiographic criteria of ventricular tachycardia (wide QRS complexes of different morphology to the sinus QRS complexes, atrioventricular dissociation) were fulfilled in all patients. The arrhythmia was monomorphic 9 times out of 10 with a fixed (3 cases) or variable (7 cases) rate which was always > 150/min. Intravenous magnesium sulphate in the severe and permanent forms, oral betablockers in forms triggered by acceleration of the sinus rhythm, oral amiodarone alone or associated in one case with propranolol were prescribed but three neonates were not treated, either from the outset or after inefficacy of amiodarone: nine of the patients were cured and are treatment-free 12 to 24 months later: the other patient has a slow, well tolerated ventricular tachycardia. No aetiology was detected in 9 cases; the other had a metabolic disease of B-oxidation of long chain fatty acids. The authors conclude that isolated, idiopathic ventricular tachycardia of the neonate usually carry a good prognosis which is not dependent on the tachycardia of the permanence of the arrhythmia. Simple treatment (betablocker or amiodarone) is usually associate with restoration of sinus rhythm and definitive cure during the first year of life.", 
    "63": "A great deal of uncertainty persists regarding the exact nature of the interaction between autonomic nervous activity and thyroid hormones in the control of heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP). Thyrotoxicosis was produced by a daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of L-thyroxine (0.5 mg/kg body wt in 1 ml of 5 mM NaOH for 5 days). Control rats received i.p. daily injections of the thyroxine solvant. Autonomic blockers were administered intravenously: atropine (0.5 mg/kg), atenolol (1 mg/kg), atenolol + atropine or prazosin (1 mg/kg). Eight animals were studied in each group. Thyroxine treatment was sufficient to induce a significant degree of tachycardia (423 +/- 6 vs 353 +/- 4 bpm; p < 0.001, unpaired Student's tests), systolic BP elevation (142 +/- 3 vs 127 +/- 2 mmHg; p < 0.001), pulse pressure increase (51 +/- 2 vs 41 +/- 2 mmHg, p < 0.01), cardiac hypertrophy (1.165 +/- 0.017 vs 1.006 +/- 0.012 g, p < 0.001), weight loss (-21 +/- 2 g; p < 0.001) and hyperthermia (37.8 +/- 0.1 vs 37.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C, p < 0.001). The intrinsic HR observed after double blockade (atenolol + atropine) was markedly increased after treatment with thyroxine (497 +/- 16 vs 373 +/- 10 bpm, p < 0.05). Vagal tone (difference between HR obtained after atenolol and intrinsic HR) was positively linearly related to intrinsic HR (r = 0.84; p < 0.01). Atenolol neither modified HR nor BP variability in rats with hyperthyrodism. The thyrotoxicosis was associated with a reduction of the 0.4 Hz component of BP variability (analyses on 102.4 sec segments, modulus 1.10 +/- 0.07 vs 1.41 +/- 0.06 mmHg; p < 0.01). Prazosin was without effect on this 0.4 Hz component in these animals. These data show a functional diminution of the vascular and cardiac sympathetic tone in experimental hyperthyroidism. Increased intrinsic HR resulting from the direct effect of thyroid hormone on the sinoatrial node is the main determinant of a tachycardia leading to a subsequent rise in cardiac output. The resulting BP elevation could reflexly induce a vagal activation and a sympathetic (vascular and cardiac) inhibition.", 
    "64": "A possible effect of the sympatholytic carvedilol on alloxan-induced diabetes mellitus in the laboratory rat was examined in experiments. The animals were divided into a group treated with carvedilol in a single daily dose of 10mg/kg in 1 ml of diluting solution i.p and the control group which received only diluting solution in the pertinent amount. The values of malondialdehyde and glucose in the serum, diuresis and total losses of sugar in the urine within 24 hours were estimated and histopathological examination of the kidneys of the treated and control groups was performed. The results show an effect of the tested dose of the drug, primarily in the region the proximal renal tubule.", 
    "65": "Changes in the distribution of beta-adrenoceptors (beta ARs) in the plasma membrane and the light vesicle fractions of rat liver during different phases of sepsis were studied using [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding and photoaffinity labeling with [125I]iodocyanopindolol diazirine. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Septic rats exhibit an initial hypermetabolic (hyperglycemic) phase (9 h after CLP; early sepsis) followed by a hypometabolic (hypoglycemic) phase (18 h after CLP; late sepsis). The radioligand studies show that in the plasma membranes, the density of beta ARs was decreased by 28-32% and 46-69% during the early and the late phases, respectively, of sepsis. In the light vesicles, the density of beta ARs was increased by 25-30% and 30-35% during the early and the late phases, respectively, of sepsis. The total number of the receptor binding sites (the sum of that in plasma membrane plus light vesicle) was decreased by 11-12% and 21-35% during the early and the late phases, respectively, of sepsis. These results indicate that beta ARs were progressively internalized from surface membranes to the intracellular sites and, furthermore, they were underexpressed in the rat liver during the progression of sepsis. Since hepatic glucose metabolism is known to be regulated by catecholamines, in part, through beta AR mediation, an internalization/underexpression of hepatic beta ARs may play a role in the altered glucose homeostasis during sepsis, particularly in the late hypometabolic phase of sepsis.", 
    "66": "Neuroleptics induce several extra-pyramidal side effects, such as akathisia, acute dystonia and parkinsonism. Although recently developed atypical neuroleptics ameliorate some of these side effects, akathisia remains a common and severely distressing adverse reaction. Several drugs are reported to be of clinical use for the pharmacological treatment of akathisia. In particular, the beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol, has been widely used for the treatment of akathisia, but it does not ameliorate other extra-pyramidal side effects. To identify the neural substrates of akathisia, we investigated the effects of propranolol on haloperidol-induced Fos expression in rat brain. Haloperidol (1 mg/kg) induced Fos-positive nuclei in several regions of the brain, including the cingulate cortex area 3, piriform cortex nucleus accumbens, caudate-putamen, ventral lateral septum and parietal cortex. Pretreatment with propranolol (5 mg/kg) reduced the number of Fos-positive nuclei in the cingulate cortex area 3, the piriform cortex and area 1 of the parietal cortex. Injection of vehicle by itself tended to increase Fos expression in the cingulate cortex area 3 and the piriform cortex. Considering the functions of these brain regions, we speculate that the most plausible neural framework for haloperidol-induced akathisia involves area I of the parietal cortex, but possible roles for the cingulate cortex area 3 and the piriform cortex cannot be ruled out.", 
    "67": "1. We investigated the effect of adrenergic receptor stimulation or inhibition on the hepatic ultrastructural changes in a porcine faecal peritonitis model of multi-organ failure. We infused either the alpha1 adrenergic receptor agonist methoxamine or the beta2 adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI 118551 during 8 h of the study.2. Anaesthetized pigs (25-30 kg) were divided into four non-septic groups (control, non-septic, non-septic methoxamine and non-septic ICI 118551) and three septic groups (septic, septic methoxamine and septic ICI 118551).3. Changes in hepatic ultrastructure were measured by morphometric analysis. The septic group was significantly worse than all the non-septic groups. Septic methoxamine and septic ICI 118551 were significantly worse than the septic group.4. Septic methoxamine and septic ICI 118551 had a significantly increased perisinusoidal space; septic methoxamine had significant hepatocyte vacuolation.5. Hepatic ultrastructural changes were independent of hepatic blood flow.6. Septic methoxamine had significant myocardial depression.7. The alpha1 adrenergic receptor agonist methoxamine or the beta2 antagonist ICI 118551 both amplified the hepatic injury normally found during sepsis in our porcine model.8. These findings suggest that during sepsis a protective endogenous beta2 adrenergic receptor-mediated anti-inflammatory response is activated via cell membrane transduction to stimulate the trimeric G-protein complex Gs and activate the second cell messenger cAMP.9. In addition, it is likely that alpha1 adrenergic receptor agonists amplify the inflammatory response by stimulating the cell-surface receptor-linked trimeric G-protein complex to activate Gq and the second cell messenger phospholipase C.",

Phenylephrine (80 microM) increased the current by up to 31.0 +/- 5.4% of control at all membrane potentials tested both below and above the reversal potential. The reversal potential (+21.0 +/- 3.2 mV), which corresponded with the theoretical reversal potential for the Na+/Ca2+ exchange current under our ionic conditions (+21.3 mV), was not changed by phenylephrine (+23.2 +/- 4.1 mV). Applying phenylephrine in the absence of Na+/Ca2+ exchange (0 Na+e, 0 Ca2+e) did not change the current. The effect was resistant to propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, but prevented by prazosin, an alpha-receptor antagonist, by neomycin, an inhibitor of phospholipase C, and by chelerythrine, a selective inhibitor of protein kinase C. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate failed to stimulate the current. The effect remained similar under conditions of high (HEPESi = 5 mM) and low (HEPESi = 0.5 mM) intracellular pH buffering.",

The first beat of the PVTs occurred with a coupling interval of several hundred ms to the preceding idioventricular beat (IDV) without any bridging activity and its earliest EPI breakthrough occurred in areas overlying the terminations of the right or left bundle branch. ARI values measured in IDV (295 +/- 47 ms) were significantly prolonged prior to PVT (462 +/- 92 ms). Prolongation was greater in apical than in basal epicardial areas, and at endocardial than epicardial sites (to > 500 ms). Maximum delays > 200 ms developed in the regions of marked ARI prolongation and, in later beats, circus movement re-entry occurred around refractory barriers, shifting between various regions of the ventricles.", 
    "75": "Thus, PVTs occurring spontaneously under conditions of delayed repolarisation originate from shifting sites in the ventricular conduction system and re-entrant activity shifting between various regions of the ventricle may occur in later beats of the more sustained arrhythmias.", 
    "76": "In light of recent evidence implicating the upregulation of outward K+ current in mediating several forms of neuronal apoptosis, we tested the hypothesis that such an upregulation might specifically contribute to the pathogenesis of beta-amyloid peptide (A beta)-induced neuronal death. Exposure to A beta fragment 25-35 (20 microM) or 1-42 (20 microM) enhanced the delayed rectifier K+ current IK, shifting its activation voltage relationship toward hyperpolarized levels and increasing maximal conductance, but did not affect the transient K+ current IA or charybdotoxin-sensitive BK current. Reducing IK by adding the channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA, 5 mM) or raising extracellular K+ to 25 mM attenuated A beta-induced neuronal death, even in the presence of nifedipine or gadolinium to block associated increases in Ca2+ influx. The IA blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 5 mM) and the CI- channel blocker anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (ACA, 500 microM) were not neuroprotective. These data raise the intriguing possibility that manipulations aimed at reducing outward K+ current may provide an approach to reducing neuronal degeneration in patients with Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "77": "Because the use of spectral powers of blood pressure (BP) and R-R interval (RR) in the low (LF) and high frequencies (HF) to quantify sympathetic and parasympathetic activities is still under debate, we questioned whether nonlinear methods may give better results. The BP signal was recorded for 30 min before and after intravenous injection of hexamethonium (20 mg/kg), atropine (0.5 mg/kg), atenolol (1 mg/kg), and prazosin (1 mg/kg) in conscious, normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. Three nonlinear indexes [percentage of recurrence, percentage of determinism, and length index (Lmax)] extracted from the recurrence plot method were used to analyze the BP signal. Sympathetic but not parasympathetic blockade reduced BP level and its LF component. RR increased and decreased after beta- and alpha-blockades, respectively. Hexamethonium increased HF, and atropine reduced LF, of RR. Sympathetic blockade and, in particular, alpha-sympathetic blockade increased nonlinear indexes of BP. In contrast, parasympathetic blockade by atropine increased nonlinear indexes of RR. These results suggest that, compared with spectral indexes, nonlinear indexes may be more specific markers of sympathetic and parasympathetic tones.", 
    "78": "On-line capillary electrophoresis-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS) has been employed for the determination of racemic mixtures of the chiral drugs, terbutaline, ketamine, and propranolol. Separation of the different chiral forms has been achieved by introducing cyclodextrins (CDs), which act as chiral selectors, into the CE operating electrolytes. Cyclodextrins function as chiral selectors in CE because of their ability to form host-guest complexes (inclusion complexes) of varying stability with an array of chiral drugs and other compounds. Derivatized forms of beta-CD (i.e., dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin) were used in this study due to their higher solubilities in the aqueous methanolic operating electrolyte than native beta-CD. Addition of minor quantities of methanol to the aqueous-based CE operating electrolytes improved the stability of electrospray ionization conditions and further enhanced CE resolution of the enantiomeric pairs relative to purely aqueous systems. Introduction of the CDs into the CE operating electrolytes caused suppression of analyte signals in ESI-MS, and the dependence of analyte signal intensities on the solution concentrations of the derivatized beta-CDs was examined. Under optimized conditions, the different enantiomeric forms of the compounds under investigation were successfully separated and detected by CE-ESI-MS.", 
    "79": "Mesaconitine, one of the main alkaloids contained in Aconiti tubers, is a centrally acting analgesic without affinity to opioid receptors. It has been reported that the antinociception is due to an interaction with the noradrenergic system. In the present study, the effect of mesaconitine on the uptake of noradrenaline and on neuronal activity was examined in rat hippocampus. Experiments were performed as a study of [3H]noradrenaline uptake into rat hippocampal synaptosomes. Mesoconitine inhibited [3H]noradrenaline uptake in a concentration-dependent manner with a Ki of 111.95+/-18 nM. In a further series of experiments, the effects of mesaconitine on the extracellularly recorded population spike were investigated in rat hippocampal slices. At a concentration of 10 nM, mesaconitine increased the amplitude of the postsynaptic population spike by 31.10%+/-6.7% of control and elicited one or two additional spikes. The presynaptic fiber spike and the field excitatory postsynaptic potential were not affected by this alkaloid. The enhancement of neuronal activity was abolished by 1 microM propranolol as well as by 1 microM timolol. It is concluded that mesoconitine increased the excitability in rat hippocampal pyramidal cells by an involvement of the noradrenergic system, with at least one mechanism being inhibition of noradrenaline uptake leading to an enhanced extraneuronal noradrenaline level.", 
    "80": "The report describes the results of a study the effect of pH and binding of six physiologically active compounds (isoproterenol, yohimbine, theophylline, propranolol, clonidine and carbachol) on the molecular structure of human serum albumin (HSA) using dynamic light scattering. It was found that the albumin globule had the most compact configuration (Stokes diameter 59-62A) at physiological pH 7.4. The changes in pH both increased to 8.0 and decreased to 5.4, resulting in the growth of globule size to 72-81A. At acidic shift of pH an additional peak arose in the correlation spectra. This peak was caused by the light scattering on the structures with the Stokes diameters of 29-37A, which conformed to the sizes of the albumin subdomains. The additional peak was not displayed at basic shift of pH. The interaction with propranolol, clonidine and carbachol, which hinder adenylate cyclase (AdC) signaling system of a cell, initiated structural rearrangements similar to acidic transitions. Isoproterenol, yohimbine and theophylline, which activate AdC, caused the conformational changes of HSA similar to basic transitions.", 
    "81": "A comparison was carried out of the efficacy of psychological and drug treatments for children with migraine. Forty-three children aged between 8 and 16 years (mean age: 11.3 years) who suffered from migraine received either progressive relaxation or cephalic vasomotor feedback, both with stress management training, or metoprolol, a beta-blocker. Psychological treatment was administered in ten sessions lasting six weeks and the drug treatment lasted ten weeks. Relaxation and stress management training reduced the headache index (frequency x intensity of headache episodes), more effectively than metoprolol with cephalic vasomotor feedback and stress management training in between. An overall improvement over time was found with regard to frequency and intensity of headache episodes and analgesics intake. When comparing pre- to post-treatment data, children treated with relaxation training improved significantly in headache frequency and intensity, whereas those treated with cephalic vasomotor feedback improved significantly in headache frequency and duration as well as mood. The clinical improvement was stable at an 8-months follow-up.", 
    "82": "In anesthetized dogs with chronic, complete AV block we studied the characteristics of ventricular repolarization and refractoriness. Therefore, we determined: (1) steady-state values of ventricular effective refractory period (VERP), action potential duration (APD), and stimulus T interval (STI) before and after d-sotalol treatment at various pacing cycle lengths (PCLs); and (2) the dynamics of VERP, APD, and STI before and after d-sotalol treatment after the abrupt PCL decreases. VERP, APD, and STI showed a normal frequency dependency. All three parameters increased significantly after d-sotalol administration. During steady-state and dynamic measurements, STI was always longer than APD and APD was always longer than VERP in an individual animal, irrespective of PCL and conditions. Standard deviations of steady-state and dynamic values indicated a considerable interindividual variation. However, the dynamics of VERP, APD, and STI after an abrupt decrease in PCL were highly correlated (linear regression analysis: r2 > or = 0.93). The best mathematical model to describe these dynamics was a bi-exponential model (r2 > or = 0.98) with a very short first and a much longer second time constant. We found that there was a very consistent relation between VERP, APD, and STI, not only during steady-state but also in the dynamic situation after various abrupt PCL decreases. This relation does not change after the administration of d-sotalol. Therefore, STI could be used to predict steady-state and dynamic values of VERP and APD. Since STI can be made available online in implantable pacing systems this could lead to the development of new features in these devices.",

    "91": "Electrophysiological techniques were used to study the effects of paroxetine, sertraline, and fluvoxamine on the basal activity of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of rats. Acute i.v. administrations of paroxetine (20-1280 microg/kg), sertraline (20-1280 microg/kg), and fluvoxamine (20-1280 microg/ kg) caused a slight but significant reduction in the firing rate of the VTA dopaminergic cells studied. Paroxetine produced a maximal inhibitory effect of 10 +/- 11% at the cumulative dose of 160 microg/kg. Sertraline induced a dose-related inhibition of VTA dopaminergic neurons, which reached its maximum (10 +/- 7%) at the cumulative dose of 1280 microg/kg. The effect of fluvoxamine on the basal firing rate of VTA dopaminergic neurons was more pronounced as compared to that of paroxetine and sertraline, in that it produced a maximal inhibition of 17 +/- 12% at the cumulative dose of 1280 microg/kg. Acute i.v. injections of paroxetine (20-1280 microg/kg), sertraline (20-1280 microg/kg), and fluvoxamine (20-5120 microg/kg) caused a dose-dependent decrease in the basal firing rate of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Paroxetine and sertraline stopped the spontaneous firing of serotonergic neurons at the cumulative dose of 1280 microg/kg, whereas fluvoxamine reached the same effect only at the cumulative dose of 5120 microg/kg. Pretreatment with the 5-HTA1A receptor antagonist tertatolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.) reduced the inhibitory effects of paroxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline on the basal activity of serotonergic neurons in the DRN. Administration of tertatolol induced a 15-fold increase in the ED50 for fluvoxamine. The antagonistic effect of tertatolol was much less evident in blocking the inhibitory action exerted by paroxetine and sertraline on the activity of serotonergic neurons. Pretreatment with tertatolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.) potentiated the inhibitory effect of fluvoxamine on the basal activity of VTA dopaminergic neurons. Tertatolol did not affect the inhibitory action exerted by paroxetine and sertraline on these neurons. It is concluded that inhibition of the basal firing rate of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA is a common characteristic of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The effects of SSRIs on VTA dopaminergic cell activity might be relevant for their therapeutic action and may explain the origin of the reported cases of akathisia.",

    "93": "We combined the results of all 18 published double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials of beta-blockers in heart failure. From this combined database of 3023 patients, we evaluated the strength of evidence supporting an effect of treatment on left ventricular ejection fraction, NYHA functional class, hospitalizations for heart failure, and death. beta-Blockers exerted their most persuasive effects on ejection fraction and on the combined risk of death and hospitalization for heart failure. beta-Blockade increased the ejection fraction by 29% (P<10(-9)) and reduced the combined risk of death or hospitalization for heart failure by 37% (P<0.001). Both effects remained significant even if >90% of the trials were eliminated from the analysis or if a large number of trials with a neutral result were added to the analysis. In contrast, the effect of beta-blockade on NYHA functional class was of borderline significance (P=0.04) and disappeared with the addition or removal of only 1 moderate-size study. Although beta -blockade reduced all-cause mortality by 32% (P=0.003), this effect was only moderately robust and varied according to the type of ss-blocker tested, ie, the reduction of mortality risk was greater for nonselective beta-blockers than for beta1-selective agents (49% versus 18%, P=0.049). However, selective and nonselective beta-blockers did not differ in their effects on other measures of clinical efficacy.",

Past experience with clinical trials in cardiovascular disease has shown that the results are often unanticipated and at odds with the scientific rationale that existed beforehand. Also, important lessons have been learned concerning sample size and the choice of end-points. One of these has been the unreliability of surrogates (such as blood pressure, exercise capacity and number of anginal attacks) in predicting the effect of treatment on morbidity and mortality. The current drug therapy for staple angina in patients without a history of myocardial infarction has not been tested in large-scale clinical trials. No data exist for organic nitrates. The rationale for using beta-blockers comes from trials in patients who had a history of myocardial infarction. Recent experience with sustained release calcium channel antagonists suggests that they appear to be safe in patients with stable angina. Their effect on overall clinical outcome remains to be established, however. It is for this reason that trials such as ACTION are both justifiable and needed.", 
    "96": "Previously the authors showed that myocardial beta-adrenergic (betaAR) function is reduced after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in a canine model Whether CPB results in similar effects on betaAR function in adult humans is not known.

    "98": "Catecholamine levels increased significantly during CPB (P < 0.005). Myocardial betaAR adenylyl cyclase coupling decreased during CPB, as evidenced by a 21% decrease in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (750 [430] pmol cyclic adenosine monophosphate per milligram total protein 15 min before CPB compared with 540 [390] at the end of CPB, P = 0.0062, medians [interquartile range]) despite constant betaAR density. Differential activation along the betaAR signal transduction cascade localized the defect to the adenylyl cyclase moiety. Administration of long-term preoperative betaAR antagonists did not prevent acute CPB-induced myocardial betaAR dysfunction.", 
    "99": "These data indicate that the myocardial adenylyl cyclase response to betaAR agonists decreases acutely in adults during aortocoronary surgery requiring CPB, regardless of whether long-term preoperative betaAR antagonists are administered. The mechanism underlying acute betaAR dysfunction appears to be direct impairment of the adenylyl cyclase moiety. Similar increases in manganese-stimulated activity before and at the end of CPB show preserved adenylyl cyclase catalytic activity, suggesting that other mechanisms (such as decreased protein levels or altered isoform expression or function) may be responsible for decreased adenylyl cyclase function.",

    "107": "The in vitro effects of the nitric oxide (NO) substrate L-arginine on ciliary beat frequency and the in vivo effects of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on mucociliary activity were investigated in the rabbit maxillary sinus mucosa with photoelectric techniques. L-Arginine increased ciliary beat frequency in vitro with a maximum response of 27.1% +/- 6.4% at 10(-3) mol/L, and this effect was reversibly blocked by pretreatment with the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine, whereas D-arginine had no such effect. SNP increased mucociliary activity in vivo, the peak response of 36.8% +/- 4.2% being obtained at the dose of 30.0 microg/kg. No tachyphylaxis was observed after repeat challenge with SNP. The increase in mucociliary activity caused by SNP was largely unaffected by pretreatment with the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac, and the cholinergic antagonist atropine. The nonselective beta-blocker propranolol delayed the peak response of SNP to 7 to 8 minutes after challenge, compared with 1 to 2 minutes after challenge in animals without pretreatment. The results show the NO substrate L-arginine and the NO donor SNP to have ciliostimulatory effects in vitro and in vivo, respectively. The occurrence of NOS production in the sphenopalatine ganglion and sinus mucosa of the rabbit was studied by immunohistochemistry for NOS activity or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase histochemistry. The latter is an indirect sign of neuronal NOS activity. Numerous NOS-containing cell bodies were seen in the sphenopalatine ganglion; in the sinus mucosa a moderate supply of thin NOS-immunoreactive nerve fibers was seen. Taken together, the morphologic findings and the functional results indicate NO to be a regulator of mucociliary activity in upper airways.", 
    "108": "Combination therapy is a cost-effective and rational approach to treatment of severe hypertension and of mild to moderate hypertension that is refractory to monotherapy. The method has several advantages, most notably improved tolerability and enhanced antihypertensive efficacy. Long-term prospective studies are needed to confirm that such agents as calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and alpha 1 blockers reduce end-organ damage more effectively than do older antihypertensive drugs. However, scientific evidence strongly suggests that reducing risk factors for end-organ damage reduces heart, brain, kidney, and large-artery injury. Alpha 1 blockers appear to be a particularly suitable choice for use in combination regimens. The only class of agents that should be avoided in combination with alpha 1 blockers is central alpha agonists; all other agents act in an additive or synergistic fashion. Unlike diuretics and beta blockers, alpha 1 blockers do not adversely affect serum lipid, glucose, or insulin levels. In fact, alpha 1 blockers may improve these measurements and also counteract the adverse effects of other antihypertensive agents on them. Alpha1-blocker therapy may bring about regression of LVH, and it does not have deleterious effects on disorders that often coexist with hypertension (e.g., gout, chronic obstructive lung disease, peripheral ischemia).",

A crude extract of Limacia scanden injected intravenously as a single bolus induced a dose-dependent increase in arterial blood pressure in anaesthetized rats and cats. Pretreatment with a non-specific alpha blocker phentolamine (10(-5) M) blocked this effect, whereas the beta blocker propanolol (10(-5) M) did not. The extract also reduced intestinal motility and this response could be blocked by pretreatment with phentolamine (10(-5) M) and specific alpha1-blocker, prazosin (10(-5) M). In superfused rabbit aorta preparations, it induced an increase in contractions. This effect was blocked by pretreatment with prazosin (10(-5) M), whereas the alpha2-blocker yohimbine (10(-5) M) had only a slight effect. The effects of NA on superfused aorta strip contraction were similar to extract. Toxic symptoms were manifested in less than 5 min when the mice were given 465 mg/kg of extract intraperitoneally. Physiological and behavioural changes observed in dying mice implicated serious malfunctioning of the autonomic nervous system and motor activity. Electrophysiological studies on the tonically autoactive neuron (TAN) of the snail Achantina fulica F\u00e9russac revealed that crude extract of Limacia scanden induced excitatory responses which were similar to those of serotonin (5-HT) stimulation. Studies with different ionic compositions of the bathing saline revealed that this excitatory effect of Limacia scanden could be attributed either to release of endogenous serotonin or inhibition of 5-HT reuptake in the CNS. This observation could tentatively be used to provide the framework towards elucidating the mechanism and rationale for the use of this plant in traditional medicine in the treatment of depression and affective disorders.",

In addition, although studies have shown that stimulation of macrophage beta-adrenoceptors results in an increase in cAMP and an associated reduction in macrophage phagocytic activity, it remains unknown whether Kupffer cell beta-adrenoceptor characteristics and cAMP levels are altered during polymicrobial sepsis. To study this, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). At 5 h (i.e., the early stage of sepsis) or 20 h (late sepsis) after CLP or sham operation, the liver was perfused with collagenase solution and Kupffer cells were isolated. beta-Adrenoceptor characteristics of the isolated Kupffer cells were determined using [125I]iodopindolol, and basal levels of cAMP were measured by radioimmunoassay. The results indicate that while maximum binding capacity (Bmax) of Kupffer cell beta-adrenoceptors was not altered at 5 h, it increased significantly at 20 h after CLP. Similarly, basal levels of cAMP in Kupffer cells did not change at 5 h but increased markedly at 20 h after the onset of sepsis. In contrast, the dissociation constant (Kd, 1/affinity) of Kupffer cell beta-adrenoceptors was not significantly affected by sepsis at both 5 h and 20 h after CLP. Thus, upregulation of beta-adrenoceptors and increase in cAMP levels in Kupffer cells occur during the late stage of polymicrobial sepsis, and this may contribute to the depression of macrophage phagocytic function under such conditions.",

Controlling for these differences, there was no variation in the use of effective agents between patients cared for by a cardiologist attending physician and a generalist with a consultation by a cardiologist. However, there was a consistent trend toward increased use of aspirin, thrombolytics, and beta-blockers in these patients compared with those with a generalist attending physician only (P<.05 for beta-blockers only). Differences between groups in the use of lidocaine were not statistically significant. The adjusted probabilities of use of thrombolytics for consultative care and cardiologist attending physicians were 0.73 for both.

We have used a potent and selective alpha1A agonist, A-61603, to test whether activation of the alpha1A-adrenergic receptor subtype is sufficient to mediate the morphological, biochemical and molecular alterations associated with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In neonatal rat cardiomyocyte cultures, 48 h incubation with 50 nm A-61603 led to a marked increase in myocardial cell size that was associated with a significant elevation in the rate of protein synthesis. The increased rate of incorporation of radiolabelled amino acids into protein stimulated by A-61603 was totally abolished by the selective alpha1A antagonist KMD-3213. A-61603 increased ANF secretion three-fold, and ANF mRNA 12-fold above control levels in cardiomyocyte cultures. RNase protection analysis demonstrated a A-61603-mediated two to three-fold increase in alpha1A-adrenergic receptor mRNA with a concomitant 50% decrease in alpha1B mRNA levels by 48 h. Identical responses of differential regulation of alpha1A- and alpha1B-adrenergic receptor mRNA were observed with phenylephrine. Both the stimulation of alpha1A- and repression alpha1B-adrenergic receptor mRNA caused by A-61603 could be abolished by 10-20 nm KMD-3213. The present data provide evidence that selective activation of alpha 1A-adrenergic receptors on cardiomyocytes is sufficient to mediate the phenotypic changes associated with cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, the differential regulation of alpha1A and alpha1B mRNA in response to selective alpha1A-adrenergic receptor stimulation suggests that cross-talk between receptor subtypes may be involved in regulating receptor populations during chronic agonist exposure.",

Eleven beta-blockers, formed by cyclic boronation with n-butylboronic acid and TEA, produced higher yields than by on-column thermal reaction and seven beta-blockers were shown to give the highest yields in the phenyl cyclic boronation with pyridine or TEA by on-column thermal and general reaction. The phenyl cyclic boronate of nadolol produced one peak in the chromatogram and the n-butyl cyclic boronate showed two peaks. On-column derivatization and n-butylboronic acid and pyridine was effective in saving analysis time and for convenience, even though some n-butyl cyclic boronates by cyclic boronation with TEA gave a better yield. In n-butyl cyclic boronation with pyridine by on-column thermal reaction the detection limits were 0.1 to 4 ng/microL in urine with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10:1.", 
    "141": "To link glucose signaling to its long-term pleiotropic effects in the pancreatic beta-cell, we have investigated whether glucose regulates immediate-early response genes (IEGs) coding for transcription factors implicated in cell proliferation and differentiation. Glucose causes a coordinated transcriptional activation of the IEGs c-fos, c-jun, JunB, zif-268, and nur-77 in the pancreatic beta-cell line INS-1. This activation is entirely dependent on the presence of the cell-permeant cAMP analog chlorophenylthio-cAMP, which has only a modest effect by itself. The accumulation of c-fos, JunB, and nur-77 mRNA occurs at physiological concentrations of glucose (3 to 11 mM), requires a 1-2 h period, and is mimicked by other nutrient stimuli including mannose, leucine plus glutamine, and pyruvate. Glucose is synergistic with the glucoincretin peptides GLP-1 and PACAP-38, whereas these neurohormonal agents have no effect at low (3 mM) glucose. Mechanistically, the synergy between glucose and the glucoincretins is not based on cAMP alone as glucose does not further increase intracellular cAMP in response to GLP-1 and PACAP-38. A role for Ca2+ signaling is inferred, since the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine markedly reduces the induction of c-fos and nur-77 by glucose and GLP-1. The induction of IEGs by glucose and chlorophenylthio-cAMP or GLP-1 and the inhibitory effect of nifedipine are also observed in the betaHC9 cell line. The results indicate that GLP-1 and PACAP-38 act as competence factors for the action of glucose on c-fos, JunB, and nur-77. It is suggested that the synergistic effect of glucose and glucoincretins on IEG expression plays an important role in the adaptive processes of the beta-cell to hyperglycemia.", 
    "142": "Although implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) can successfully terminate ventricular arrhythmias, antiarrhythmic drugs are often required to prevent recurrent events. Class III antiarrhythmic agents have emerged as the safest, most effective, and widely used agents in the 40-70% of ICD patients who require concomitant antiarrhythmic medication. Antiarrhythmic agents can influence the effectiveness of ICDs to terminate arrhythmias through their effect on defibrillation threshold. All class III agents share the ability to prolong ventricular refractoriness and those with \"pure\" class III activity consistently decrease defibrillation threshold in the normal canine heart model. Sotalol, amiodarone, and bretylium all have other Vaughan Williams class actions that influence their respective effects on defibrillation threshold. Sotalol has been associated with a decrease in defibrillation threshold in both animal and in clinical studies, whereas amiodarone has been associated with variable effects in animal models and an increase in defibrillation threshold in clinical studies. Additionally, antiarrhythmic agents may prolong ventricular tachycardia (VT) cycle length, which may affect the ability to pace terminate or cardiovert VT. Amiodarone has a moderate slowing effect on the VT cycle length. Finally, class III drugs also have proarrhythmic potential that may affect the defibrillator's function. Sotalol can be associated with dose-related torsade de pointes, whereas amiodarone may slow the VT cycle length below the tachycardia detection rate cutoff. In conclusion, class III pharmacotherapy can be safely administered in conjunction with ICD therapy as long as the interaction between these therapeutic modalities is appreciated.", 
    "143": "Ischemic heart disease is the most frequent cardiac abnormality in patients with sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The goals of therapy in such patients are to decrease the severity and incidence of symptoms and prolong life. In this article, we review the current views on antiarrhythmic drug therapy and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in patients with ischemic heart disease. The importance of beta blockade as part of the therapy is emphasized. In addition, the superiority of sotalol and amiodarone over class I drugs, the benefits of combined treatment with amiodarone and a beta blocker, and the impact and limitations of current trials comparing the effectiveness of drug therapy with that of an ICD are all considered. Also discussed is the combined use of an antiarrhythmic drug and an ICD. In this approach sotalol is generally the agent of choice, with amiodarone the second choice.", 
    "144": "Appreciation has grown for the impact of the autonomic nervous system on the development of clinical cardiac arrhythmias. Antiarrhythmic medications work to significantly prolong cardiac repolarization and slow conduction. The question has arisen whether these pharmacologic actions of antiarrhythmic drugs can be modulated by alterations in the sympathetic nervous system. This article examines the data pertaining to modulation of the class I and class III effects of antiarrhythmic drugs during beta-adrenergic stimulation, the body's natural response to stress. The actions of several antiarrhythmic drugs can be fully reversed during beta-adrenergic sympathetic stimulation. Overall, the data suggest that pure class III drugs are the most susceptible to reversal of their effects on refractoriness, followed by class IA agents, amiodarone (which has partial resistance), and d,l-sotalol (which is highly resistant to reversal). Whereas retrospective analyses of a number of trials suggest that sympathetic-stimulation-induced reversal of the electrophysiologic effects of certain antiarrhythmic drugs can decrease their clinical efficacy, prospective trials examining this issue are needed. At the current time it appears reasonable to administer beta blockers to patients receiving antiarrhythmic agents that do not have intrinsic antiadrenergic effects.", 
    "145": "Beta blockers have traditionally been considered relatively poor antiarrhythmic agents for patients with ventricular arrhythmias. This view is based on the observations that beta blockers are less effective in suppressing spontaneous ventricular ectopy or inducible ventricular arrhythmias than are the class I and class III agents. However, there are convincing data that beta blockers can have a clinically important antiarrhythmic effect and prevent arrhythmic and sudden death. Beta blockers have multiple potential effects that can contribute to a therapeutic antiarrhythmic action, including an antiadrenergic/vagomimetic effect, a decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold, and prevention of a catecholamine reversal of concomitant class I/III antiarrhythmic drug effects. Postinfarction trials, recent congestive heart failure studies, and observations in patients who are at risk for sustained ventricular arrhythmias all suggest a potent antiarrhythmic effect of beta blockade.",

    "150": "The metabolic management of heart disease represents a promising new strategy for ischemic syndromes. This review focuses on the clinical studies performed with trimetazidine, a cellular anti-ischemic agent, either as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs. Acute and chronic administration of trimetazidine significantly increased total work, exercise duration, and time to 1-mm ST segment depression, without any change in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, or rate-pressure product at the same workload, as compared with placebo. Chronic administration studies have been performed comparing the anti-ischemic effects of trimetazidine with nifedipine or propranolol in patients with chronic stable angina. In these studies, the number of anginal attacks was significantly decreased in all groups. Ergometric results showed that trimetazidine increased duration of exercise, time to 1-mm ST segment depression, time to angina, and decreased ST segment depression at peak exercise similarly to propranolol or nifedipine treatment. Rate-pressure product at the same workload remained unchanged in the patients treated with trimetazidine in comparison with baseline treatment, suggesting no effect of the drug on oxygen demand, whereas it was decreased during treatment with nifedipine and propanolol, because of the hemodynamic activity of these drugs. The therapeutic value of adding trimetazidine to either calcium antagonists or beta blockers in patients with ischemic heart disease has also been demonstrated. Unlike classic anti-ischemic agents, treatment with trimetazidine is not accompanied by any modification in hemodynamic parameters, confirming the experimental data showing a unique mechanism of action via a direct effect on the ischemic myocardium.",

We have calculated therapeutic dose which reduced heart frequency/min of the animals by 25%. This was 10 mg/kg. The blood glucose and triglyceride values of healthy rats are in the normal human domain. Blood glucose was high after the first metoprolol dose and increased further with continued treatment. Drug administration period comprised 16 days. At finishing experiments diminished glycogen content was measured which may be related to higher glucose output. In blood samples obtained one hour after last 16. metoprolol dose administration triglyceride values were high and HDL-C decreased.

Hospital length of stay and estimated cost of hospitalization based on DRG and specific payer ratio of cost-to-charge were also compared between groups. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the influence of estimated risk and procedures on hospital costs. The four groups were well matched for gender, hypertension, tobacco history, and previous percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and myocardial infarction. Group 4 had a higher incidence of previous coronary bypass grafting (35% vs 10%, p=0.001) and triple vessel or left main coronary artery disease compared with Group 1 (44% vs 13%, p=0.041).

The preparations were superfused with Tyrode's solution at 31 degrees C while attached to a force transducer to measure peak tension developed (PTD), maximum velocity of development of tension (Vmax T) and time to peak tension (TPT). The positive force staircase was not affected by propranolol or phentolamine, but it was abolished by nifedipine. Cocaine 1 mg/l (2.9 microM) enhanced PTD and Vmax T, while TPT remained unchanged. On the other hand, cocaine did not modify the increase in PTD induced by the increase in frequency of stimulation, but significantly reduced the magnitude of the increase in Vmax T. The cocaine-induced attenuation of the increase in Vmax T in response to changes in the frequency of stimulation was abolished by both propranolol and phentolamine. It is concluded that the effect of cocaine on the force-frequency relationship required background activation of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors."
