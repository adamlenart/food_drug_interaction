    "0": "Atypical antipsychotic (AA) drugs cause significant metabolic side effects, and clinical data are emerging that demonstrate increased fracture risk and bone loss after treatment with the AA, risperidone (RIS). The pharmacology underlying the adverse effects on bone is unknown. However, RIS action in the central nervous system could be responsible because the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is known to uncouple bone remodeling. RIS treatment in mice significantly lowered trabecular bone volume fraction (bone volume/total volume), owing to increased osteoclast-mediated erosion and reduced osteoblast-mediated bone formation. Daytime energy expenditure was also increased and was temporally associated with the plasma concentration of RIS. Even a single dose of RIS transiently elevated expression of brown adipose tissue markers of SNS activity and thermogenesis, Pgc1a and Ucp1. Rankl, an osteoclast recruitment factor regulated by the SNS, was also increased 1 hour after a single dose of RIS. Thus, we inferred that bone loss from RIS was regulated, at least in part, by the SNS. To test this, we administered RIS or vehicle to mice that were also receiving the nonselective \u03b2-blocker propranolol. Strikingly, RIS did not cause any changes in trabecular bone volume/total volume, erosion, or formation while propranolol was present. Furthermore, \u03b22-adrenergic receptor null (Adrb2(-/-)) mice were also protected from RIS-induced bone loss. This is the first report to demonstrate SNS-mediated bone loss from any AA. Because AA medications are widely prescribed, especially to young adults, clinical studies are needed to assess whether \u03b2-blockers will prevent bone loss in this vulnerable population.",

    "6": "Inorganic phosphate (Pi) plays an important role in cell signaling and energy metabolism. In insulin-releasing cells, Pi transport into mitochondria is essential for the generation of ATP, a signaling factor in metabolism-secretion coupling. Elevated Pi concentrations, however, can have toxic effects in various cell types. The underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we have investigated the effect of Pi on secretory function and apoptosis in INS-1E clonal \u03b2-cells and rat pancreatic islets. Elevated extracellular Pi (1~5 mM) increased the mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m), superoxide generation, caspase activation, and cell death. Depolarization of the \u0394\u03a8m abolished Pi-induced superoxide generation. Butylmalonate, a nonselective blocker of mitochondrial phosphate transporters, prevented \u0394\u03a8m hyperpolarization, superoxide generation, and cytotoxicity caused by Pi. High Pi also promoted the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) pore, leading to apoptosis, which was also prevented by butylmalonate. The mitochondrial antioxidants mitoTEMPO or MnTBAP prevented Pi-triggered PT pore opening and cytotoxicity. Elevated extracellular Pi diminished ATP synthesis, cytosolic Ca(2+) oscillations, and insulin content and secretion in INS-1E cells as well as in dispersed islet cells. These parameters were restored following preincubation with mitochondrial antioxidants. This treatment also prevented high-Pi-induced phosphorylation of ER stress proteins. We propose that elevated extracellular Pi causes mitochondrial oxidative stress linked to mitochondrial hyperpolarization. Such stress results in reduced insulin content and defective insulin secretion and cytotoxicity. Our data explain the decreased insulin content and secretion observed under hyperphosphatemic states.", 
    "7": "Despite extensive debate about the first choice for treating essential hypertension, monotherapy effectively normalizes blood pressure (BP) values in only a limited number of hypertensive patients. Thus, the aim of combination therapy should always be to both improve BP control and to reduce cardiovascular events. Antihypertensive drugs can be effectively combined if they have different and complementary mechanisms of action. This is crucial to obtain additive BP-lowering effects without impacting on tolerability. One typical combination is the association of drugs blocking and stimulating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and calcium antagonist or diuretic, respectively). In contrast, some combinations (e.g., calcium antagonists plus diuretics or beta-blockers plus RAS blockers) have no additive BP-lowering effects, while other combinations (e.g., clonidine plus alpha-1 receptor blockers) can have a negative interaction. Regardless, BP reduction is not the only mechanism that reduces cardiovascular risk. Scientific evidence indicates that some drug classes are better than others in this respect, and therefore some drug combinations are also better than others. The results of the ASCOT-BPLA and ACCOMPLISH trials suggested that an ACE inhibitor/calcium antagonist combination had better cardioprotective effects than beta-blocker/diuretic or ACE inhibitor/diuretic combinations. It is worth noting that no controlled clinical trials have used hard endpoints when investigating the effects of an angiotensin receptor blocker/calcium antagonist combination. In conclusion, combination therapy is needed for optimal antihypertensive management, with the first choice being an ACE inhibitor plus a calcium antagonist. This approach should improve BP control and provide better cardiovascular protection.", 
    "8": "Orexin, also known as hypocretin, is a secreted neuropeptide implicated in the regulation of sleep and food intake. In the present study, we examined the importance of orexin in regulation of the sympathetic nervous system using an orexin/ataxin-3 transgenic (OXTg) rat, which has a minimal number of orexin neurons. RT-PCR analysis identified expression of prepro-orexin and orexin receptor-1 (OX1R) in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), and expression of another receptor (OX2R) was marginal in the wild-type rat. The orexin/ataxin-3 transgenic rat showed increased expression of OX1R and OX2R, whereas expression of prepro-orexin was undetectable, suggesting a compensatory increase in both receptors. In the ECG recording (R-R interval), orexin/ataxin-3 transgenic rats showed decreased responsiveness to the \u03b2-adrenergic blocker propranolol. Furthermore, OXTg rats had deteriorated R-R interval regulation, indicating involvement of the orexin system in sympathetic nerve regulation. This was accompanied by decreased baroreflex and responsiveness to \u03b2-adrenergic blocker in blood pressure recording, also suggesting involvement of the orexin system in sympathetic nerve regulation. Histological examination revealed hypotrophic changes in the transgenic heart, suggesting involvement of the orexin system in cardiac development. Taken together, our present results indicate involvement of the orexin system in sympathetic nerve control.", 
    "9": "The spectacular advances in G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structure determination have opened up new possibilities for structure-based GPCR ligand discovery. The structure-based prediction of whether a ligand stimulates (full/partial agonist), blocks (antagonist), or reduces (inverse agonist) GPCR signaling activity is, however, still challenging. A total of 31 \u03b21 (\u03b21R) and \u03b22 (\u03b22R) adrenoceptor crystal structures, including antagonist, inverse agonist, and partial/full agonist-bound structures, allowed us to explore the possibilities and limitations of structure-based prediction of GPCR ligand function. We used all unique protein-ligand interaction fingerprints (IFPs) derived from all ligand-bound \u03b2-adrenergic crystal structure monomers to post-process the docking poses of known \u03b21R/\u03b22R partial/full agonists, antagonists/inverse agonists, and physicochemically similar decoys in each of the \u03b21R/\u03b22R structures. The systematic analysis of these 1920 unique IFP-structure combinations offered new insights into the relative impact of protein conformation and IFP scoring on selective virtual screening (VS) for ligands with a specific functional effect. Our studies show that ligands with the same function can be efficiently classified on the basis of their protein-ligand interaction profile. Small differences between the receptor conformation (used for docking) and reference IFP (used for scoring of the docking poses) determine, however, the enrichment of specific ligand types in VS hit lists. Interestingly, the selective enrichment of partial/full agonists can be achieved by using agonist IFPs to post-process docking poses in agonist-bound as well as antagonist-bound structures. We have identified optimal structure-IFP combinations for the identification and discrimination of antagonists/inverse agonist and partial/full agonists, and defined a predicted IFP for the small full agonist norepinephrine that gave the highest retrieval rate of agonists over antagonists for all structures (with an enrichment factor of 46 for agonists and 8 for antagonists on average at a 1% false-positive rate). This \u03b2-adrenoceptor case study provides new insights into the opportunities for selective structure-based discovery of GPCR ligands with a desired function and emphasizes the importance of IFPs in scoring docking poses.",

The ecotoxicity of propranolol hydrochloride and losartan potassium was evaluated, both individually and combined in a binary mixture, by using the Lemna minor growth inhibition test. The endpoints evaluated in the single-pharmaceutical tests were frond number, total frond area and fresh weight. For the evaluation of the mixture toxicity, the selected endpoint was frond number. Water quality criteria values (WQC) were derived for the protection of freshwater and saltwater pelagic communities regarding the effects induced by propranolol and losartan using ecotoxicological data from the literature, including our data. The risks associated with both pharmaceutical effects on non-target organisms were quantified through the measured environmental concentration (MEC)/predicted-no-effect concentration (PNEC) ratios. For propranolol, the total frond area was the most sensitive endpoint (EC50 = 77.3 mg L(-1)), while for losartan there was no statistically significant difference between the endpoints. Losartan is only slightly more toxic than propranolol. Both concentration addition and independent action models overestimated the mixture toxicity of the pharmaceuticals at all the effect concentration levels evaluated. The joint action of both pharmaceuticals showed an antagonistic interaction to L. minor. Derived WQC assumed lower values for propranolol than for losartan. The MEC/PNEC ratios showed that propranolol may pose a risk for the most sensitive aquatic species, while acceptable risks posed by losartan were estimated for most of aquatic matrices.

Use of the Weibull function to describe the in vitro drug-release profiles allowed discrimination between the selected formulations with respect to the drug-release mechanisms. Comparison of the release data from the same formulation in different in vitro set-ups showed that the methodology used can affect the mechanism of in vitro release. We also evaluated the ability of the in vitro methods to predict in vivo activity by comparing simulated plasma concentration-time profiles acquired from the application of the biopharmaceutical software GI-Sim to the in vitro observations. In summary, the simulations based on the miniaturized-method release data predicted the plasma profiles as well as or more accurately than simulations based on the historical release data in 71% of the cases and this miniaturized in vitro method appears to be applicable for both solid and non-solid formulations.",

Filmogenic solutions were loaded with timolol maleate (TM) as a model drug, to be used as drug delivery devices, a novel application for this material.

Furthermore, it was determined that PLA coating decreased TM release rate compared to that of uncoated films. Similarly, this behavior was observed via indirect estimation of the release by assessing the hypotensive effectiveness of the films by in-vivo assays. Through intraocular pressure (IOP) determination tests in rabbits, it was demonstrated that, through the use of high crosslinked and coated films, a significant decrease in IOP could be achieved for prolonged time periods.

    "42": "There has been much research linking elevated resting heart rate to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Based on these findings, a lower resting heart rate would be of theoretical benefit in patients with cardiovascular disease. From a pathophysiologic perspective, a lower resting heart rate would be of particular benefit in patients with ischemic heart disease and/or heart failure. Although \u03b2-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are effective at lowering heart rate, they have many other pharmacologic effects that may not be desirable in some patients, such as negative inotropy. Ivabradine is a drug designed to lower heart rate without any other demonstrable pharmacologic effects; in other words, a pure heart rate-lowering drug. It functions by blocking the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated channels (f-channels) specific for the sinoatrial node and disrupting If ion current flow. This effectively prolongs diastolic depolarization and slows firing in the sinoatrial node, which lowers heart rate. The effects of ivabradine are most pronounced at higher heart rates (use-dependence), which is important in minimizing the development of symptomatic bradycardia. Clinical trials have demonstrated ivabradine to be an effective antianginal drug both alone and in combination with \u03b2-blocker therapy, although it has not been shown to produce a demonstrable effect on reducing major adverse cardiovascular events. In patients with heart failure, ivabradine has demonstrated many hemodynamic benefits, but its effect on clinical outcomes have been mixed and dependent on baseline heart rate, ie, the drug may be of benefit with higher baseline heart rates, but detrimental with low baseline heart rates. The adverse effects of ivabradine are not uncommon, but are rarely severe and include visual disturbances, bradycardia, and atrial fibrillation. Although ivabradine is a very interesting new agent, its variable benefits in large-scale clinical trials leave its exact place in therapy still somewhat nebulous. Unanswered questions include which patient populations would benefit most from this drug, and which concomitant medications would produce the best clinical outcomes when used with ivabradine.", 
    "43": "At the \u03b21-adrenoceptor, CGP 12177 potently antagonizes agonist responses at the primary high-affinity catecholamine conformation while also exerting agonist effects of its own through a secondary low-affinity conformation.

The dissociation rate of 3 nM BODIPY-TMR-CGP was 0.09 \u00b1 0.01 min(-1) in the absence of competitor ligands, and this was enhanced 2.2- and 2.1-fold in the presence of 1 \u00b5M CGP 12177 and 1 \u00b5M propranolol, respectively. These effects on the BODIPY-TMR-CGP dissociation rate were markedly enhanced in \u03b21-adrenoceptor homodimers constrained by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (9.8- and 9.9-fold for 1 \u00b5M CGP 12177 and 1 \u00b5M propranolol, respectively) and abolished in \u03b21-adrenoceptors containing TM4 mutations vital for the second conformation pharmacology. This study suggests that negative cooperativity across a \u03b21-adrenoceptor homodimer may be responsible for generating the low-affinity pharmacology of the secondary \u03b21-adrenoceptor conformation.",

Compared with verapamil SR, atenolol also increased the prevalence of BP and HR nighttime dipping among prior non-dippers (BP: OR = 3.37; 95% CI: 1.26-8.97 P = 0.015; HR: OR = 4.06; 95% CI: 1.35-12.17; P = 0.012) and blunted HR morning surge (+2.8 vs. +4.5 beats/min/hr; P = 0.019).

    "45": "During incremental exercise tests, chronotropic incompetence (CI), which is the inability of the heart rate (HR) to rise in proportion to an increase in metabolic demand, is often observed in patients with type\u00a02 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Despite the fact that CI is associated with exercise intolerance and elevated risks of development of cardiovascular disease and premature death, this clinical anomaly is often ignored or overlooked by clinicians and physiologists. CI is, however, a significant clinical abnormality that deserves further attention, examination and treatment. The aetiology of CI in T2DM remains poorly understood and is complex. Certain T2DM-related co-morbidities or physiological anomalies may contribute to development of CI, such as altered blood catecholamine and/or potassium levels during exercise, structural myocardial abnormalities, ventricular and/or arterial stiffness, impaired baroreflex sensitivity and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. Clinicians should thus be aware of the potential presence of yet undetected anomalies or diseases in T2DM patients who experience CI during exercise testing. However, an effective treatment for CI in T2DM is yet to be developed. Exercise training programmes seem to be the only potentially effective and feasible interventions for partial restoration of the chronotropic response in T2DM, but it remains poorly understood how these interventions lead to restoration of the chronotropic response. Studies are thus warranted to elucidate the aetiology of CI and develop an effective treatment for CI in T2DM. In particular, the impact of (different) exercise interventions on CI in T2DM deserves greater attention in future studies.",

Lipins exhibit dual function as enzymes catalyzing the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol and as co-transcriptional regulators. Thus, they are able to regulate lipid homeostasis at several nodal points. Here, we show that lipin-1 is up-regulated in several cancer cell lines and overexpressed in 50 % of high grade prostate cancers. The proliferation of prostate and breast cancer cells, but not of non-tumorigenic cells, was repressed upon lipin-1 knock-down. Lipin-1 depletion also decreased cancer cell migration through RhoA activation. Lipin-1 silencing did not significantly affect global lipid synthesis but enhanced the cellular concentration of phosphatidic acid. In parallel, autophagy was induced while AKT and ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation were repressed. We also observed a compensatory regulation between lipin-1 and lipin-2 and demonstrated that their co-silencing aggravates the phenotype induced by lipin-1 silencing alone. Most interestingly, lipin-1 depletion or lipins inhibition with propranolol sensitized cancer cells to rapamycin. These data indicate that lipin-1 controls main cellular processes involved in cancer progression and that its targeting, alone or in combination with other treatments, could open new avenues in anticancer therapy.",

Here we report that memory retrieval (reactivation) induces the activation of \u03b21-adrenergic \u03b2-arrestin signaling in the brain, which stimulates ERK signaling and protein synthesis, leading to postreactivation memory restabilization. \u03b2-Arrestin2-deficient mice exhibit impaired memory reconsolidation in object recognition, Morris water maze, and cocaine-conditioned place preference paradigms. Postreactivation blockade of both brain \u03b2-adrenergic Gs protein- and \u03b2-arrestin-dependent pathways disrupts memory reconsolidation. Unexpectedly, selective blockade of the Gs/cAMP/PKA signaling but not the \u03b2-arrestin/ERK signaling by the biased \u03b2-adrenergic ligands does not inhibit reconsolidation. Moreover, the expression of \u03b2-arrestin2 in the entorhinal cortex of \u03b2-arrestin 2-deficient mice rescues \u03b21-adrenergic ERK signaling and reconsolidation in a G protein pathway-independent manner. We demonstrate that \u03b2-arrestin-biased signaling regulates memory reconsolidation and reveal the potential for \u03b2-arrestin-biased ligands in the treatment of memory-related disorders.",

Female rats were divided into 4 groups: sedentary control (SC), sedentary hypertensive (SH), sedentary hypertensive ovariectomized (SHO), and resistance-trained hypertensive ovariectomized (RTHO). Resistance exercise training was performed on a vertical ladder (5 days/week, 8 weeks) at 40-60% maximal load. Direct arterial pressure was recorded. Vagal and sympathetic tones were measured by heart rate (HR) responses to methylatropine (3 mg/kg, iv) and propranolol (4 mg/kg, iv). Ovariectomy resulted in additional increases in blood pressure in hypertensive rats and was associated with decreased vagal tone. Resistance exercise trained rats had lower mean arterial pressure than untrained rats (RTHO: 159\u00b12.2 vs SHO: 177\u00b13.4 mmHg), as well as resting bradycardia (RTHO: 332\u00b19.0 vs SHO: 356\u00b15 bpm). Sympathetic tone was also lower in the trained group. Moreover, sympathetic tone was positively correlated with resting HR (r=0.7, P<0.05). The additional arterial pressure increase in hypertensive rats caused by ovarian hormone deprivation was attenuated by moderate-intensity dynamic resistance training. This benefit may be associated with resting bradycardia and reduced cardiac sympathetic tone after training, which suggests potential benefits of resistance exercise for the management of hypertension after ovarian hormone deprivation.",

DM was more prevalent in Arabs (68 vs. 32%), but its burden showed a decreasing trend over time compared with South Asians. More diabetics presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (47.5 vs. 22.7%), which tended to occur 8 years earlier compared with heart failure. Over the study period, beta-blocker use increased substantially (from 10 to 71%).

However, whether Hif-1\u03b1 contributed to the Ang II-mediated cardiac fibrosis after MI, and whether interaction or synergetic roles between Hif-1\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2 pathways existed in the process was unclear. In vitro, cardiac cells were incubated under hypoxia or Ang II to mimic ischaemia. In vivo, valsartan was intravenously injected into Sprague-Dawley rats with MI daily for 1 week; saline and hydralazine (another anti-hypertensive agent like valsartan) was used as control. The fibrosis-related proteins were detected by Western blotting. Cardiac structure and function were assessed with multimodality methods. We demonstrated in vitro that hypoxia would induce the up-regulation of Ang II, TGF-\u03b2/Smad and Hif-1\u03b1, which further induced collagen accumulation. By blocking with valsartan, a blocker of Ang II type I (AT1) receptor, we confirmed that the up-regulation of TGF-\u03b2/Smad and Hif-1\u03b1 was through the Ang II-mediated pathway. By administering TGF-\u03b2 or dimethyloxalylglycine, we determined that both TGF-\u03b2/Smad and Hif-1\u03b1 contributed to Ang II-mediated collagen accumulation and a synergetic effect between them was observed.

    "82": "Beta-adrenoceptors (\u03b2-AR), members of the G protein-coupled receptors play important roles in the regulation of heart function. A positive inotropic action of catecholamines is mediated through their interaction with \u03b2-AR, located on the sarcolemma, while they can also mediate some deleterious effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias or myocardial apoptosis. The well-known \u03b2-AR-associated signaling in heart is composed of a coupled mechanism among both \u03b21- and \u03b22-AR and stimulatory G protein (G(s)). This coupled mechanism further leads to the activation of adenylyl cyclase and thereby increases in intracellular cAMP level. However, recent studies have emphasized the contribution of constitutive \u03b23-AR coupling to G(i) proteins, thereby initiating additional signal transduction pathways, particularly under physiopathological conditions. Diabetic cardiomyopathy, as a distinct entity is recognized due to its diminished responsiveness to \u03b21-AR agonist stimulation in the heart from diabetic rats with no important changes in the responses mediated with \u03b22-AR. Furthermore, an upregulation of \u03b23-AR has been shown in diabetic rat heart with a strong negative inotropic effect on left ventricular function. Experimental data provide evidences that the mechanisms for the negative inotropic effect with \u03b23-AR activation appear to involve a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G protein and the activation of a nitric oxide synthase pathway. On the other hand, \u03b2-blockers demonstrate marked beneficial effects in heart dysfunction with scavenging free radicals and/or acting as an antioxidant with both sex- and dose-dependent manner. However, further investigations are needed to clarify the roles of both altered expression and/or responsiveness of \u03b2-AR and the benefits with \u03b2-blocker treatment in diabetes.

A dose of each drug that caused 10\u00a0% prolongation of Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) was calculated, which was compared with respective known hERG K(+) IC50 value and currently obtained heart/plasma concentration ratio. Each positive drug prolonged the QTcF in a dose-related manner, whereas such effect was not observed by the negative drugs. Drugs with more potent hERG K(+) channel inhibition showed higher heart/plasma concentration ratio, resulting in more potent QTcF prolongation in vivo. The potency of dl-sotalol for QTcF prolongation was flat middle, although its hERG K(+) channel inhibitory property as well as heart/plasma concentration ratio was the smallest among the positive drugs, which may be partly explained by its lack of binding to plasma protein.",

In vivo rat luminal concentrations of FITC-dextran (FD-4), a nonabsorbable marker, and drugs (metoprolol and atenolol) after oral coadministration as solutions with different osmolarity were determined by direct sampling of residual water in each segment of the GI tract. The luminal FD-4 concentration after oral administration as hyposmotic solution was significantly higher than that after administration as isosmotic or hyperosmotic solution. As the change in FD-4 concentration reflects the change in the volume of luminal fluid, it indicated that the luminal volume was greatly influenced by osmolality of solution ingested orally. Then, fraction of drug absorbed (Fa) in these segments was calculated by comparing the area under the luminal concentration-time curve of FD-4 with those of drugs. Fa values of two model drugs in each GI segment decreased with increase in luminal fluid volume, and the impact of the fluid volume was marked for Fa of atenolol (a low permeable drug) than for that of metoprolol (a high permeable drug). These findings should be beneficial to assure the effectiveness and safety of oral drug therapy.", 
    "90": "Crigler-Najjar type 1 disease is a rare inherited metabolic disease characterized by high levels of unconjugated bilirubin due to the complete absence of hepatic uridine diphosphoglucuronate-glucuronosyltransferase activity. Hepatocyte transplantation (HT) has been proposed as an alternative treatment for Crigler-Najjar syndrome, but it is still limited by the quality and the low engraftment and repopulation ability of the cells used. Because of their attachment capability and expression of adhesion molecules as well as the higher proportion of hepatic progenitor cells, neonatal hepatocytes may have an advantage over adult cells. Adult or neonatal hepatocytes were transplanted into Gunn rats, a model for Crigler-Najjar disease. Engraftment and repopulation were studied and compared by immunofluorescence (IF). Additionally, the serum bilirubin levels, the presence of bilirubin conjugates in rat serum, and the expression of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1 family polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) in rat liver samples were also analyzed. Here we show that neonatal HT results in long-term correction in Gunn rats. In comparison with adult cells, neonatal cells showed better engraftment and repopulation capability 3 days and 6 months after transplantation, respectively. Bilirubinemia decreased in the transplanted animals during the whole experimental follow-up (6 months). Bilirubin conjugates were also present in the serum of the transplanted animals. Western blots and IF confirmed the presence and expression of UGT1A1 in the liver. This work is the first to demonstrate the advantage of using neonatal hepatocytes for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar in vivo.",

To this end, the pharmacokinetic literature, the University of Minnesota's Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database Pathway Prediction System aerobic microbial degradation software, and photolysis literature pertaining to \u03b2-blockers and SSRIs were used to determine their most likely TPs formed via human metabolism, aerobic biodegradation, and photolysis, respectively. Monitoring data from North American and European surface waters receiving human wastewater inputs were the basis of the exposure characterizations of the parent compounds and the TPs, where available. In most cases, where monitoring data for TPs did not exist, we assumed a conservative 1:1 parent-to-TP production ratio (i.e., 100% of parent converted). The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)'s EPISuite and ECOSAR v1.11 software were used to estimate acute and chronic toxicities to aquatic organisms. Hazard quotients, which were calculated using the 95(th) percentile of the exposure distributions, ranged from 10(-11) to 10(-3) (i.e., all significantly less than 1). Based on these results, the TPs of interest would be expected to pose little to no environmental risk in surface waters receiving wastewater inputs. Overall, we recommend developing analytical methods that can isolate and quantify human metabolites and TPs at environmentally relevant concentrations to confirm these predictions. Further, we recommend identifying the major species of TPs from classes of pharmaceuticals that could elicit toxic effects via specific modes of action (e.g., norfluoxetine via the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]1A receptors) and conducting aquatic toxicity tests to confirm these findings. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative probabilistic ecotoxicological assessment of all of the predicted and probable TPs of these pharmaceuticals, and our approach provides a framework for future such studies with other compound classes as data become available.",

However, defining the extent of metabolism relies upon clinical data. Drugs exhibiting high passive intestinal permeability rates are extensively metabolized. Therefore, we aimed to determine if in vitro measures of permeability rate or in silico permeability rate predictions could predict the extent of metabolism, to determine a reference compound representing the permeability rate above which compounds would be expected to be extensively metabolized, and to predict the major route of elimination of compounds in a two-tier approach utilizing permeability rate and a previously published model predicting the major route of elimination of parent drug. Twenty-two in vitro permeability rate measurement data sets in Caco-2 and MDCK cell lines and PAMPA were collected from the literature, while in silico permeability rate predictions were calculated using ADMET Predictor or VolSurf+. The potential for permeability rate to differentiate between extensively and poorly metabolized compounds was analyzed with receiver operating characteristic curves. Compounds that yielded the highest sensitivity-specificity average were selected as permeability rate reference standards. The major route of elimination of poorly permeable drugs was predicted by our previously published model, and the accuracies and predictive values were calculated. The areas under the receiver operating curves were >0.90 for in vitro measures of permeability rate and >0.80 for the VolSurf+ model of permeability rate, indicating they were able to predict the extent of metabolism of compounds. Labetalol and zidovudine predicted greater than 80% of extensively metabolized drugs correctly and greater than 80% of poorly metabolized drugs correctly in Caco-2 and MDCK, respectively, while theophylline predicted greater than 80% of extensively and poorly metabolized drugs correctly in PAMPA.

    "111": "In this work, the ion-transfer voltammetric detection of the protonated \u03b2-blocker propranolol was explored at arrays of nanoscale interfaces between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES). Silicon nitride nanoporous membranes with 400 pores in a hexagonal arrangement, with either 50 or 17 nm radius pores, were used to form regular arrays of nanoITIES. It was found that the aqueous-to-organic ion-transfer current continuously increased steadily rather than reaching a limiting current plateau after the ion-transfer wave; the slope of this limiting current region was concentration dependent and associated with the high ion flux at the nanointerfaces. Electrochemical data were examined in terms of an independent nanointerface approach and an equivalent microdisc approach, supported by finite element simulation. In comparison to the larger interface configuration (50 nm radius), the array of 17 nm radius nanoITIES exhibited a 6.5-times higher current density for propranolol detection due to the enhanced ion flux arising from the convergent diffusion to smaller electrochemical interfaces. Both nanoITIES arrays achieved the equivalent limits of detection, 0.8 \u03bcM, using cyclic voltammetry. Additionally, the effect of scan rate on the charging and faradaic currents at these nanoITIES arrays, as well as their stability over time, was investigated. The results demonstrate that arrays of nanoscale liquid-liquid interfaces can be applied to study electrochemical drug transfer, and provide the basis for the development of miniaturized and integrated detection platforms for drug analysis.", 
    "112": "The differential effects of a selective kappa- (\u03ba-) opioid receptor agonist, U50488, were elucidated by monitoring the contraction of isolated guinea pig atrial and ventricular muscles. In electrically driven left atria, U50488 in nanomolar concentration range decreased the contractile force. Norbinaltorphimine (norBNI), a selective \u03ba-receptor antagonist, and pertussis toxin (PTX) abolished the negative inotropic effect of U50488. In contrast, the inhibitory effect was not affected by the pretreatment of atropine or propranolol. Even though U50488 exerted a negative inotropic effect in the left atrium, it did not affect the contractile force of the right atrium and ventricles paced at 2\u2009Hz. Similarly, the beating rate of the spontaneously beating right atrium was also unaffected by U50488. These results indicate that the activation of \u03ba-opioid receptors can only produce negative inotropic effect in left atria via activation of PTX-sensitive G protein in guinea pigs. The absence of negative inotropic effects in right atria and ventricles suggests that there may be a greater distribution of functional \u03ba-opioid receptors in guinea pig left atria than in right atria and ventricles, and the distribution of the receptors may be species-specific.",

Nonischemic cardiomyopathy and other structural abnormalities such as arrhythmogenic ventricular dysplasia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may also be causative. Patients without structural disease have a primary electrical abnormality, such as long-QT syndrome or Brugada syndrome. Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction is the main marker for sudden death in patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy. In other conditions, other markers for structural heart disease and electrical abnormalities need to be considered.

Several lines of evidence support the cardioprotective effects of RAS blockers: they reduce ischemic events and improve outcome in heart failure independently of their effect on heart function and blood pressure. Moreover, early RAS blocker administration has remarkable survival and heart function benefits in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Nevertheless, perioperative studies on the effects of RAS blockers remain few and inconclusive. Results from clinical trials and observational studies are conflicting, and they raise more questions than answers.

Stress response has been associated with the incidence and development of cancer. The catecholamines (CA), adrenaline (AD) and noradrenaline (NA), are crucial mediators of stress response, exerting their effects through interaction with \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (AR). Colon cancer cells express \u03b2-AR, and their activation has been implicated in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Interest concerning the efficacy of \u03b2-AR blockers as possible additions to cancer treatment has increased. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of several AR agonists and \u03b2-blockers following cell proliferation of HT-29 cells, a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line. For this purpose, HT-29 cells were incubated in the absence (control) or in the presence of the AR-agonists, AD, NA and isoprenaline (ISO) (0.1-100 \u00b5M) for 12 or 24 h. The tested AR agonists revealed proliferative effects on HT-29 cells. In order to study the effect of several \u03b2-blockers following proliferation induced by AR activation, the cells were treated with propranolol (PRO; 50 \u00b5M), carvedilol (CAR; 5 \u00b5M), atenolol (ATE; 50 \u00b5M), or ICI 118,551 (ICI; 5 \u00b5M) for 45 min prior, and simultaneously, to incubation with each of the AR agonists, AD and ISO, both at 1 and 10 \u00b5M. The results suggested that adrenergic activation plays an important role in colon cancer cell proliferation, most probably through \u03b2-AR. The \u03b2-blockers under study were able to reverse the proliferation induced by AD and ISO, and some of these blockers significantly decreased the proliferation of HT-29 cells.

    "126": "Nicotine and soluble semi-stable aldehydes and ketones in cigarette smoke are key mediators of the elevated risks for vascular disease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease observed in smokers. Nicotine, via sympathetic stimulation, increases risk for both vascular disease and cancer. Comprehensive suppression of sympathetic activity with the well-tolerated drug carvedilol, which inhibits betal 1, beta2 and alphal adrenergic receptors, may be protective to smokers and other nicotine addicts. The soluble aldehydes and ketones in tobacco smoke appear to exert their adverse effects through activation of NADPH oxidase complexes in vascular tissues and in the lungs. The phytochemical phycocyanobilin (PhyCB), richly supplied by the edible cyanobacterium spirulina, in studies on rodents and in human cell cultures has shown the ability to safely mimic intracellular bilirubin's physiological role as an inhibitor ofNADPH oxidase activity. It therefore may have potential for mitigating the pro-oxidative effects of tobacco smoke aldehydes and ketones. Joint administration of carvedilol and spirulina merits exploration as a strategy for moderating the pathogenic impact of smoking in chronic tobacco users who either fail to quit or refuse to try cessation of tobacco. Carvedilol may be appropriate for those who manage a nicotine addiction in other ways (smokeless tobacco, e-cigarettes, nicotine gum). Further clinical studies to evaluate the impact of carvedilol on cardiovascular risk factors in nicotine addicts, and rodent studies to assess markers of lung inflammation in smoke- exposed rodents fed PhyCB, are recommended.",

Although pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling and dysfunction, hypertrophic gene reprogramming, AT1-R and \u03b21-AR expression, and ERK phosphorylation were significantly attenuated by QL alone, QL + ARB, QL + ACEI, and QL + BB, the attenuation was stronger in the combination treatment groups. Moreover, apoptosis was reduced to a larger extent by each combination treatment than by QL alone, whereas autophagy was more strongly attenuated by either QL + ARB or QL + ACEI. None of the treatments significantly upregulated ErbB2 or ErbB4 phosphorylation, and none significantly downregulated C/EBP\u03b2 expression.

However, prolonged stimulation induces functional desensitization of the \u03b22-adrenoreceptors (\u03b22-AR), potentially leading to reduced clinical efficacy with chronic or prolonged administration. ASM-024, a small synthetic molecule in clinical stage development, has shown activity at the level of nicotinic receptors and possibly at the muscarinic level and presents anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator properties. Aerosolized ASM-024 reduces airway resistance in mice and promotes in-vitro relaxation of tracheal and bronchial preparations from animal and human tissues. ASM-024 increased in vitro relaxation response to maximally effective concentration of short-acting beta-2 agonists in dog and human bronchi. Although the precise mechanisms by which ASM-024 promotes airway smooth muscle (ASM) relaxation remain unclear, we hypothesized that ASM-024 will attenuate and/or abrogate agonist-induced contraction and remain effective despite \u03b22-AR tachyphylaxis. \u03b22-AR tachyphylaxis was induced with salbutamol, salmeterol and formoterol on guinea pig tracheas. The addition of ASM-024 relaxed concentration-dependently intact or \u03b22-AR desensitized tracheal rings precontracted with methacholine. ASM-024 did not induce any elevation of intracellular cAMP in isolated smooth muscle cells; moreover, blockade of the cAMP pathway with an adenylate cyclase inhibitor had no significant effect on ASM-024-induced guinea pig trachea relaxation. Collectively, these findings show that ASM-024 elicits relaxation of \u03b22-AR desensitized tracheal preparations and suggest that ASM-024 mediates smooth muscle relaxation through a different target and signaling pathway than \u03b22-adrenergic receptor agonists. These findings suggest ASM-024 could potentially provide clinical benefit when used adjunctively with inhaled \u03b22-adrenoreceptor agonists in those patients exhibiting a reduced response to their chronic use.",

Our previous study demonstrates that \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22-AR) and Her2 comprise a positive feedback loop in human breast cancer cells and that crosstalk between Her2 and \u03b22-AR affects the bio-behaviors of breast cancer cells, suggesting that the \u03b22-AR activation may be involved in trastuzumab resistance. In this study, we show that the expression of \u03b22-AR, which mediates most catecholamine-induced effects, negatively correlates with trastuzumab response in the patients with Her2-overexpressing breast cancer. Catecholamines potently antagonize the anti-proliferative effects of trastuzumab both in vitro and in vivo. Catecholamine stimulation upregulates the expression of miR-21 and MUC-1 by activating Her2 and STAT3, leading to deficiency of phosphatase and tensin homolog and activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt. Through inhibition of miR-199a/b-3p, catecholamines induce the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation. Thus, trastuzumab resistance-dependent PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is controlled by catecholamine-induced \u03b22-AR activation. The data indicate that \u03b22-AR is a reliable molecular marker for prediction of response probability to trastuzumab-based therapy in breast cancer. We also demonstrate that \u03b2-blocker propranolol not only enhances the antitumor activities of trastuzumab but also re-sensitizes the resistant cells to trastuzumab. Our retrospective study shows that concurrent treatment of \u03b2-blocker and trastuzumab significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival in the patients with Her2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer, implicating the possibility for combination therapy with trastuzumab plus \u03b2-blocker in Her2-overexpressing breast cancer.", 
    "174": "This study examines the effect of the L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil on mechanical strain-induced extracellular matrix genes in optic nerve head lamina cribrosa (LC) cells.", 
    "175": "Changes in LC cell intracellular calcium [Ca(2+)]i following hypotonic cell membrane stretch were measured with the fluorescent probe fura-2/AM. Fluorescence intensity was measured, after labelling, by calcium (Ca2+) imaging confocal microscopy. Confluent human LC cell cultures were serum starved for 24\u2005h prior to exposure to cyclical mechanical strain (1\u2005Hz, 15%) for 24\u2005h in the presence or absence of verapamil (10\u2005mm). Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 1 (TGF-\u03b21), collagen 6A3 (COL6A3) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 2 (CSPG2) mRNA expression levels were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR.", 
    "176": "Hypotonic cell membrane stretch of LC cells from normal donors significantly increased [Ca2+]i (p<0.05). Exposure to cyclical mechanical strain (15% strain) produced a statistically significant increase in the three matrix genes that were examined (TGF-\u03b21, COL6A3 and CSPG2). This response in both cyclical and mechanical stretch was significantly reduced by pretreating LC cells with the L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil (p<0.05).", 
    "177": "This study provides evidence of a novel mechanotransduction pathway linking mechanical strain, cation channel function and the induction of LC cell matrix gene transcription. This highlights the potential involvement of calcium influx in the activation of matrix remodelling responses in the optic nerve head and supports the rationale that calcium channel blockers may attenuate disease progression in glaucoma.", 
    "178": "Experimental studies indicate that short-term fasting alters drug metabolism. However, the effects of short-term fasting on drug metabolism in humans need further investigation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of short-term fasting (36 h) on P450-mediated drug metabolism. In a randomized crossover study design, nine healthy subjects ingested a cocktail consisting of five P450-specific probe drugs [caffeine (CYP1A2), S-warfarin (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19), metoprolol (CYP2D6), and midazolam (CYP3A4)] on two occasions (control study after an overnight fast and after 36 h of fasting). Blood samples were drawn for pharmacokinetic analysis using nonlinear mixed effects modeling. In addition, we studied in Wistar rats the effects of short-term fasting on hepatic mRNA expression of P450 isoforms corresponding with the five studied P450 enzymes in humans. In the healthy subjects, short-term fasting increased oral caffeine clearance by 20% (P = 0.03) and decreased oral S-warfarin clearance by 25% (P < 0.001). In rats, short-term fasting increased mRNA expression of the orthologs of human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 (P < 0.05), and decreased the mRNA expression of the ortholog of CYP2C9 (P < 0.001) compared with the postabsorptive state. These results demonstrate that short-term fasting alters cytochrome P450-mediated drug metabolism in a nonuniform pattern. Therefore, short-term fasting is another factor affecting cytochrome P450-mediated drug metabolism in humans.", 
    "179": "We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of losartan (100 mg QD) versus atenolol (50 mg QD) for 6 months in adults with Marfan syndrome. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), central augmentation index (AIx), aortic diameter and left ventricular (LV) function were assessed with arterial tonometry and echocardiography. Thirty-four subjects (18 female; median age 35 years, IQR 27, 45) were randomized. Central systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased comparably with atenolol and losartan (p = 0.64 and 0.31, respectively); heart rate decreased with atenolol (p = 0.02), but not with losartan. PWV decreased in patients treated with atenolol (-1.15 \u00b1 1.68 m/s; p = 0.01), but not in those treated with losartan (-0.22 \u00b1 0.59 m/s; p = 0.15; between-group difference p = 0.04). In contrast, AIx decreased in the losartan group (-9.6 \u00b1 8.6%; p < 0.001) but not in the atenolol group (0.9 \u00b1 6.2%, p = 0.57; between-group difference p < 0.001). There was no significant change in aortic diameters or LV ejection fraction in either treatment group. In adults with Marfan syndrome, 6 months of treatment with atenolol improves PWV, whereas losartan reduces the AIx. By improving vascular stiffness via distinct mechanisms of action, there is physiologic value to considering the use of both medications in individuals with Marfan syndrome.", 
    "180": "The production of new blood cells relies on a hierarchical network of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). To maintain lifelong hematopoiesis, HSPCs must be protected from ionizing radiation or other cytotoxic agents. For many years, murine models have been a valuable source of information regarding factors that either enhance or reduce the survival of HSPCs after exposure of marrow to ionizing radiation. In a recent series of studies, however, it has become clear that housing-related factors such as the cool room temperature required for laboratory mice can exert a surprising influence on the outcome of experiments. Here we report that the mild, but chronic cold-stress endured by mice housed under these conditions exerts a protective effect on HSPCs after both non-lethal and lethal doses of total body irradiation (TBI). Alleviation of this cold-stress by housing mice at a thermoneutral temperature (30\u00b0C) resulted in significantly greater baseline radiosensitivity to a lethal dose of TBI with more HSPCs from mice housed at thermoneutral temperature undergoing apoptosis following non-lethal TBI. Cold-stressed mice have elevated levels of norepinephrine, a key molecule of the sympathetic nervous system that binds to \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. We show that blocking this signaling pathway in vivo through use of the \u03b2-blocker propanolol completely mitigates the protective effect of cold-stress on HSPC apoptosis. Collectively this study demonstrates that chronic stress endured by the standard housing conditions of laboratory mice increases the resistance of HSPCs to TBI-induced apoptosis through a mechanism that depends upon \u03b2-adrenergic signaling. Since \u03b2-blockers are commonly prescribed to a wide variety of patients, this information could be important when predicting the clinical impact of HSPC sensitivity to TBI.", 
    "181": "Despite its salutary effects on health, aerobic exercise is often avoided after receipt of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) because of fears that exercise may provoke acute arrhythmias. We prospectively evaluated the effects of a home aerobic exercise training and maintenance program (EX) on aerobic performance, ICD shocks, and hospitalizations exclusively in ICD recipients.", 
    "182": "A total of 160 patients (124 men and 36 women) were randomly assigned who had an ICD for primary (43%) or secondary (57%) prevention to EX or usual care (UC). The primary outcome was peak oxygen consumption, measured with cardiopulmonary exercise testing at baseline and 8 and 24 weeks. EX consisted of 8 weeks of home walking for 1 h/d, 5 d/wk at 60% to 80% of heart rate reserve, followed by 16 weeks of maintenance home walking for 150 min/wk. Adherence to EX was determined from exercise logs, ambulatory heart rate recordings of exercise, and weekly telephone contacts. Patients assigned to UC received no exercise directives and were monitored by monthly telephone contact. Adverse events were identified by ICD interrogations, patient reports, and medical charts. ICD recipients averaged 55\u00b112 years and mean ejection fraction of 40.6\u00b115.7; all were taking \u03b2-blocker medications. EX significantly increased peak oxygen consumption (EX, 26.7\u00b17.0 mL/kg per minute; UC, 23.9\u00b16.6 mL/kg per minute; P=0.002) at 8 weeks, which persisted during maintenance exercise at 24 weeks (EX, 26.9\u00b17.7 mL/kg per minute; UC, 23.4\u00b16.0 mL/kg per minute; P<0.001). ICD shocks were infrequent (EX=4 versus UC=8), with no differences in hospitalizations or deaths between groups.",

    "185": "Topical propranolol has been used for the therapy of superficial infantile hemangiomas (IH). A retrospective investigation was conducted in 50 patients to evaluate the clinical effect of a new type of topical nano-propranolol-dispersed hydrogel. Participants were treated 3 times per day for 2 weeks to 11 months. 68% of patients were female and 12% had received other treatments before therapy. The nano-propranolol 0.5% hydrogel was initiated at a mean age of 5.010 months and for a mean duration of 3.610 months. The response rate was 86%. No recurrence and rebound growth occurred after withdrawal of hydrogel. Slight side effects (application site itching, erosion and crusting) were observed in only 2 cases. All the local irritations were evaluated as mild and were tolerated without discontinuing the medication. We suggest that topical nano-propranolol hydrogel could be an alternative option for the treatment of uncomplicated superficial IH with satisfactory tolerability and optimal effectiveness.", 
    "186": "The current recommended treatment for infantile hemangiomas is oral propranolol. Nonetheless, a small proportion of patients will have systemic side effects. In this article, the authors developed topical nano-propranolol hydrogel and tested this on clinical patients and found favorable response.",

The patient was diagnosed as pityriasis rosea-like adverse reaction to atenolol based on her history, dermatological examination and histopathological findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pityriasis rosea-like adverse reaction to atenolol that is widely used in hypertension treatment."
