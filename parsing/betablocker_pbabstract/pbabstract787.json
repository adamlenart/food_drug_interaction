The binding is displaceable by a one thousand-fold excess of cold isoproterenol and consists of two fractions, only one of which is inhibitable by the beta antagonist (--)-propranolol. The total displaceable binding to intact cells amounts to 80 or 127 molecules per cell at a (+/-)-isoproterenol concentration of 0.4 muM depending on the method employed to analyze the binding. Under similar conditions, the total displaceable binding to isolated membrane ghosts is 12600 molecules per cell. The propranolol-inhibitable binding to intact cell reaches saturation within 5 min at 4 degrees C and gives by scatchard analysis a maximum binding of 108 molecules per cell and with a KD of 0.4 muM. 50% inhibition of binding is obtained with 0.3 muM unlabeled (--)-isoproterenol as compared to 20 muM unlabeled (+)-isoproterenol. The binding of isoproterenol thus shows a marked stereospecific preference for the (--)-isomer.", 
    "1": "The mode of action of some classical and newer drugs used in the preventive interval treatment of migraine is discussed in the light of a modern theory of the pathogenesis of migraine headache. This headache is produced when two elements--a passive distension of the extracranial arteries and a lowering of the pain threshold of the receptors situated in the walls of the affected vessels--are present simultaneously. The main humoral factors involved in this phenomenon are plasma-kinins, serotonin and--to a lesser degree--histamine. The role played by serotonin which is released by the blood platelets at the onset of the attack is twofold: on the one hand, free serotonin increases the permeability of the capillaries, favouring transudation of plasmakinins, and lowers the pain threshold, while on the other hand, its increased excretion causes a secondary reduction in its plasma concentration, promoting hypotonicity of the extracranial vessels. Among the substances used for prophylactic interval treatment, some, such as dihydroergotamine, clonidine and the beta-blocking agents have a purely vascular site of action, maintaining--by various mechanisms--the tone of the extracranial arteries and thus reducing their lability. Methysergide and pizotifene have a chiefly indirect effect on the vessels, by potentiating the effect of catecholamines or helping to maintain free serotonin at a certain level. They act primarily against the humoral elements responsible for lowering the pain threshold: methysergide by inhibiting the release and blocking the effects of serotonin, by countering the potentiating effect of serotonin on the pain induced by plasmakinins and by inhibiting histamine release; pizotifene by inhibiting the release and blocking the effects of histamine, by blocking the effects of serotonin and by slightly inhibiting the peripheral effects of plasmakinins. Thus, the multifactorial pathogenesis of migraine helps to explain the effectiveness against migraine of substances possessing the most varied pharmacodynamic profiles.", 
    "2": "The QRS complex of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is thought to represent a fusion beat resulting from conduction over the normal pathway and an anomalous pathway. This report demonstrates utilization of both of these pathways resulting in two ventricular responses from a single supraventricular impulse. The presence of \"1:2\" atrioventricular conduction in this case firmly supports the fusion beat theory of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.", 
    "3": "A syndrome previously recognized by Romano and Ward is characterized by prolonged QT interval on the ECG, and spells of unconsciousness. The case of a patient is reported with successive ECG recordings during the attacks; ventricular flutter and multifocal ventricular tachycardia were noted, with rapid spontaneous recovery and relapse. Cases of stillbirth and sudden death in infancy among the siblings, together with QT interval tachycardia were noted, with rapid spontaneous recovery and relapse. Cases of stillbirth and sudden death ininfancy among the siblings, together with QT interval prolongation in the relatives point to an autosomal dominant transmission, with the propositus being apparently homozygous. The chromosomes of the patient are normal. The attacks were controlled by the association of propranolol and digitalis which seems to be the optimal long-term therapy in such cases. In view of the poor prognosis in untreated cases, and the good results of a correct therapy, an ECG should be recorded at rest and after exercise in all children suffering from spells of unconsciousness.", 
    "4": "Circulating angiotensin II is said to inhibit renin release by a direct, intrarenal action. This effect of angiotensin was studied indirectly using the selective angiotensin II antagonist saralasin (1Sar-8-Ala-angiotensin II) in conscious normal, sodium-depleted, and sodium-loaded rats. Saralasin caused a dose-related increase in plasma renin concentration (PRC) in normal and sodium-depleted rats, but had no effect on PRC in sodium-loaded animals. However, saralasin was 300 times more active in sodium-depleted rats than in normal rats. Saralasin caused hypotension and tachycardia in sodium-depleted rats, but not in normals. Propranolol inhibited saralasin-induced renin release by 99% in normal rats and by 75% in sodium-depleted rats but not alter the hypotensive effect of saralasin in the latter. Saralasin potentiated phentolamine-induced renin release, hypotension, and tachycardia in normal rats, and this potentiated renin release was blocked by propranolol. We conclude that a portion of saralasin-elicited renin release in sodium-depleted rats is mediated by hypotensive activation of the carotid baroreceptor reflex which increases sympathetic nervous activity in the kidney. However, in sodium-depleted rats saralasin induced a 42-fold increase in PRC, whereas an equipotent hypotensive dose of the vasodilator hydralazine caused only a 3.5-fold increase in PRC. Thus, we find that saralasin appears to have a selective effect on renin release over and above its hypotensive effect, which suggests an angiotensin-mediated, feedback mechanism inhibitory to renin release. Thus, we have come to the conclusion that for part of saralasin-induced renin release appears to be caused by disinhibition of angiotensin suppression of renin secretion. This \"short-loop\" feed-back mechanism is closely associated with intrarenal beta-adrenergic receptors, since propranolol impaired saralasin-induced renin release under all circumstances in our experiments.", 
    "5": "Veratridine exerts a biphasic action on the perfused frog ventricle. The initial immediate response is a depression, which is maximal at 10(-10) M. The initial depression is followed by a late potentiation of contraction which is maximal at 10(-6) to 10(-7) M veratridine. Reduction of external calcium from 1.0 mM to 0.5 mM prevents the initial depression and allows only the potentiation of contraction to be observed. The force of contraction in 0.5 mM Ca2+ is increased by veratridine to 200% of the contraction observed at 1.0 mM Ca2+. The primary site for the enhancement of contraction in the frog ventricle by veratridine is the adrenergic nerve fibers whose increase in excitability leads to an increase in epinephrine release. The beta blocker sotalol at 10(-6) M prevents the increase in contractility by veratridine in 0.4 mM Ca2+. Calcium itself depressed potentiation of contractility by veratridine by stabilizing the adrenergic nerves and antagonizing the labilizing action of veratridine. The mode of action of veratridine on the frog ventricle is attributed to the enhancement of transmitter release from cholinergic and adrenergic nerve fibers.", 
    "6": "The effect of catecholamines and adrenergic blocking agents on the transport of Cl- and Na+ of the isolated frog cornea was studied. Cl- transport was stimulated by the three catecholamines tested at 10(-6) to 10(-5) M concentration. The stimulation produced by 10(-6) M epinephrine was partially inhibited by both the alpha-blocker phentolamine and the beta blocker propranolol. The stimulation produced by 10(-6) M isoproterenol was not affected by 10(-5) M phentolamine but was completely prevented by 10(-5) M propranolol. The stimulation produced by 10(-5) M norepinephrine was completely blocked by the 10(-5) M propranolol and partially by 10(-5) M phentolamine. Catecholamines had no effect on the normally small Na+ transport. When the Na+ transport was previously increased by amphotericin B, epinephrine and isoproterenol produced a small and inconsistent stimulatory effect. Norepinephrine was without effect. It is concluded that both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors are present in the frog cornea and that the Cl- transport is increased by the stimulation of either receptor. The minimal effect on the Na+ transport further suggests the separation of pathways of the Cl- and Na+ transport in the frog cornea.", 
    "7": "The effects of reserpine on the sensitivity to catecholamines and adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol and azapetine were studied on the fundus strips of the rat. The results obtained in this study would support the view that reserpine may increase the sensitivity of beta receptor to isoprenaline and adrenaline by the mechanism which may be independent of the uptake of catecholamines in the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "8": "The chonotropic response to noradrenaline, tyramine, acetylcholine and transmural electrical stimulation was compared in atria isolated from rabbits at different stages of developmental after birth (day 2 to day 210). Pacemaker rates understeady state conditions were related inversely to days after birth; the rate in atria from rabbits at day 2 was significantly greater than that at days 10-210. The rate of neonatal rabbit atria was not significantly reduced by propranolol and the positive chontropic response to noradrenaline was not significantly reduced by propranolol and the positive chronotropic response to noradrenaline was not significantly different in atria from ages of rabbits as far as threshold concentrations for inducing tachycardia and ED50's were concerned. The maximum rate induced by noradrenaline was higher in neonatal rabbit atria than in adult rabbit atria. The effect of tyramine was approx. the same regardless of age. Increase in the pacemaker rate induced by transmural neural stimulation varied directly with age. The negative chronotropic effect of acetylcholine was greater in neonatal than in adult rabbit atria; the ED50 in the former was significantly less than in the latter. Bradycardia induced by transmural stimulation of intracardiac cholinergic nerves was related directly to age. Tachycardia in the neonatal rabbit atria may be due to electrogenic characteristics of pacemaker cells which differ from those in adult rabbit atria. Our evidence strongly suggests that the adrenergic and cholinergic nerves innervating the S-A node develop at an early postnatal stage in the rabbit.", 
    "9": "The pressor response to the intracisternal (i.c.) injection of carbachol (1 mug) in anesthetized rats was analyzed. This response was significantly reduced by the intravenous (i.v.) injection of guanethidine (5 mg), hexamethonium (10 mg) or phentolamine (5 mg), and conversely, potentiated by i.v. desmethylimipramine (0.3 mg), while propranolol (0.5 mg) i.v. selectively inhibited the enlargement of pulse pressure and the tachycardia following i.c. carbachol (1 mug). On the other hand, the pressor response to i.c. carbachol (1 mug) was almost completely blocked by i.c. atropine (3 mug) or hexamethonium (500 mug), and significantly reduced by i.c. chlorpromazine (50 mug) but significantly potentiated by i.c. desmethylimipramine (30 mug). The pressor response to i.c. carbachol (1 mug) remained unchanged after sectioning of the bilateral cervical vagal nerves but disappeared after sectioning of the spinal cord (C7-C8). From the above result it is suggested that the pressor response to i.c. carbachol ortral and peripheral adrenergic mechanisms, and that the sympathetic trunk is the main pathway.", 
    "10": "1 The effect of pindolol administered to twenty-six patients with hypertension of unknown origin was compared with respect to blood pressure and plasma renin activity change after increase of the dose over a period of 6 weeks. 2 There was no clear correlation between the fall of plasma renin activity, which in some patients was very marked, and the fall in blood pressure. Some patients with a fall in plasma renin activity did not drop their pressure. Conversely, some with a fall of pressure did not drop their plasma renin activity. 3 The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to the pindolol finally caused further lowering of the blood pressure in all but one patient and the plasma renin activity rose in all but two patinets. There was no clear correlation between change in plasma renin activity and the effect on blood pressure.", 
    "11": "1 Thirteen men with untreated essential hypertension in WHO stage I were studied on an outpatient basis to evaluate the haemodynamic long-tern effect of a new beta-adrenoceptor blocker, atenolol. 2 Oxygen consumption, heart rate, cardiac output (Cardiogreen) and intraarterial branchial pressure were recorded at rest in a supine and sitting position and during steady state work at 300, 600 and 900 kpm/min. 3 The subjects were treated with atenolol (dose 100-200 mg/day) as the sole drug for 1 year and the haemodynamic study was repeated. 4 The blood pressure was reduced approximately 18% both at rest and during exercise, the heart rate approximately 25% and the cardiac output 16% at rest supine and 27% at rest sitting. During exercise the reductions in cardiac output were approximately 20%. The calculated total peripheral resistance was not decreased compared to pretreatment values. The mean arterial pressure-heart rate product was reduced almost 40%. 5 Apart from temporary muscular fatigue during the first weeks, no side-effects were seen. 6 Atenolol is an effective blood pressure lowering drug in mild and moderate hypertension, but the drop in blood pressure is associated with marked reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at rest as well as during exercise.", 
    "12": "1. Contracture was induced in cat myocardium by exposure to 140 mM-KC1 In isotonic Tyrode solution. Force of contracture expressed as mg/mm2 (muscle cross-sectional area) falls with increasing cross-sectional area. 2. The effect of temperature on isometric force developed during contracture was evaluated both in normal (untreated) atrial and ventricular muscle and following treatment with sympatholytic drugs. 3. The force of contracture was not significantly affected by sympatholytic drugs at 36 degrees C. 4. In normal atrial and ventricular muscle, force of contracture decreased when the muscle was cooled from 36 to either 29 or 20 degrees C. 5. In atrial muscle, the effect of temperature was not changed by sympatholytic drugs. In contrast, exposure to sympatholytic drugs increased contracture force developed by ventricular muscle at 20 degrees C. Also, contracture force was significantly greater at 20 than at 36 degrees C in ventricular muscle from reserpine-pretreated cats. 6. It is suggested that ventricular muscle becomes more sensitive to the relaxing effects of endogenous catecholamines at temperature is lowered. 7. The differences shown between atrial and ventricular muscle with respect to the effect of temperature and sympatholytic drugs on contracture force may result from the differing amounts of sarcoplasmic reticulum found in these types of cardiac muscle and also from different mechanisms of \"excitation-contracture\" coupling in atrial and ventricular muscle.", 
    "13": "The effects of methionine, cysteine and serine on the rate and strength of contractions of isolated Langendorff preparations of perfused dog heart and on spontaneous release of catecholamine (CA) from these hearts were investigated. These neutral amino acids increased the amplitude of ventricular contractions. Methionine and cysteine also stimulated the ventricular rate. They induced release of noradrenaline (NA) from the isolated heart. Their inotropic and chronotropic effects were significantly inhibited by pretreatment of the heart with propranolol.", 
    "14": "The respiratory characteristics of mitochondria isolated from the subcutaneous brown adipose tissue of newborn harp seals indicate that the tissue is thermogenically active. Temperature recordings in vivo revealed, in fact, that the tissue was maintained at a temperature close to that of the body core during immersion of the pups in ice-water. Beta-adrenergic blockade markedly increased the cooling rates at both locations in ice-water, while curarization, accompanied by artificial respiration did not. We conclude that nonshivering thermogenesis through activated brown adipose tissue plays a decisive role in the defence against cold in the newborn harp seal.", 
    "15": "Net transvascular movement of fluid has been studied in the isolated, autoperfused subcutaneous adipose tissue of the dog, during and after sympathetic nerve stimulation (1-15 Hz) and during infusion of 50% glucose i.a. Net fluid movement was calculated as the difference between change in tissue volume and change in blood volume. Tissue volume was measured by plethysmography and blood volume by external monitoring of circulating 131I-albumin. No net fluid movement of statistical significance was found during or after nerve stimulation except during the first minute of stimulation at 15 Hz when a small net absorption (p less than 0.05) was obtained. In contrast, infusion of glucose at 25-75 mOsm/kg H2O produced a dose-dependent net absorption lasting several minutes, amounting maximally to 0.30 ml x min-1 x 100 g-1. The absence of prolonged net absorption in subcutaneous adipose tissue during nerve stimulation as well as the absence of net filtration after stimulation may be explained by an essentially unaltered mean hydrostatic capillary pressure. The results indicate that adipose tissue does not contribute to the fluid homeostasis of the body via sympathetic resetting of the pre-postcapillary resistance ratio. Thus, mobilisation of fluid from the interstitial space in adipose tissue into the blood does not seem to occur by nerve activity.", 
    "16": "Blood pressure responses to amphetamine have been studied both in humans and in rats. Blood pressure was monitored in patients who had experienced an adverse behavioral reaction to the drug. All of the patients had self-administereed amphetamine, and later sought medical attention for their adverse reaction. In a series of 14 patients, there was no evidence that amphetamine had evoked a sustained increase in blood pressure. In rats, experiments were conducted in two steps: (1) a determination of the doses of amphetamine that cause behavioral stimulation, and (2) an evaluation of the blood pressure effects of the same dose of amphetamine. In control animals, behavioral stimulant doses of amphetamine exerted only transient effects on blood pressure. In pithed animals, ie, animals devoid of all central mechanisms, amphetamine exerted a sustained effect on blood pressure. It is concluded that the potential ability of amphetamine to evoke sustained cardiovascular responses is damped by the central nervous system of intact animals.", 
    "17": "The mechanisms underlying protamine-induced hypotension and bradycardia were the subject of this investigation. Six groups of dogs with intact circulation were tested in controlled circumstances with various drugs. The following parameters were observed: femoral arterial pressure, central venous pressure, left ventricular pressure and its rate of rise, left ventricular contractile element velocity of shortening, maximal Vce, and cardiac output. The six groups were studied under these pharmacological conditions: ganglionic and adrenal medullary block with hexamethonium chlroide, postganglionic parasympathetic blockade by atropine sulphate, alpha and beta adrenergic receptor block by phenoxybenzamine and propranolol respectively, and depletion of endogenous histamine by compound 48/80 (a condensation product of p-methoxyphenethyl methylamine with formaldehyde). The last group was put on extracorporeal circulation to isolate the vascular tree from the heart. The effect of the drug on this isolated vasculature was observed by recording the femoral arterial pressure. Our findings show that the hypotension and bradycardia are produced by a direct effect of protamine on the myocardium and peripheral vascular system.", 
    "18": "1 The effects of propranolol and practolol, at equivalent myocardial beta-adrenoceptor blocking doses, (as assessed by the degree of shift of isoprenaline dose-response curves) were investigated in anaesthetized greyhounds before and after acute coronary artery ligation. 2 When administered intravenously to the intact close-chest dog, propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) and practolol (0.5 mg/kg) caused similar decreases in heart rate, left ventricular dP/dt max, myocardial blood flow and cardiac output. Only propranolol increased peripheral vascular resistance. 3 When administered 2-3h after acute coronary artery ligation, propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) significantly decreased blood flow in both normally perfused and ischaemic regions of the heart. There was also electrocardiographic evidence of further deterioration after propranolol; two out of seven animals died following this treatment. 4 Practolol (0.5 mg/kg) when administered after coronary artery ligation also decreased normal myocardial blood flow but flow in the ischaemic area remained unchanged. Evidence was obtained from electrocardiographic, myocardial temperature, myocardial O2 consumption and lactate measurements that the administration of practolol, in contrast to propranolol, benefited the ischaemic myocardium. 5 Analysis of the results suggests that this beneficial action of practolol may be related to at least two mechanisms. Firstly the ability of practolol to increase the period during diastole when perfusion of the subendocardium is possible, without decreasing the transventricular pressure during this period. Secondly that practolol does not unmask alpha-adrenoceptor vasoconstriction in the ischaemic region.", 
    "19": "Prostaglandin E (PGS) is synthesized and released in isolated canine trachealis muscle (CTM), and the PGE threshold concentration for an effect on isometric tension is very low, indicating this prostaglandin is a most likely candidate for an endogenous prostaglandin that modulates or regulates tension. Prostaglandin F (PGF) is also released, but the threshold concentration for a mechanical effect is probably too high for endogenous PGF to have a direct effect on tension in this muscle. Indomethacin and aspirin, at concentrations commonly used to inhibit prostaglandin synthetase, had effects on tension, membrane potential, and membrane resistance, but these effects were not appropriate if their only action was to inhibit PGE or PGF concentration in CTM. Release of PGE from CTM was increased fourfold by treatment with carbachol, but even under this condition, where presumably cell [PGE] was increased, electrophysiological studies failed to give convincing evidence that the actions of indomethacin on mechanical tension were related to inhibition of PGE or PGF synthesis.", 
    "20": "The conditions associated with prolapse of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve are multiple. The mechanisms of mitral valve prolapse as well as the pathogenesis of pain and ectopic impulse formation are reviewed. Propranolol appears to be the drug of choice for the symptomatic treatment of patients with this syndrome since it decreases myocardial oxygen demand and wall tension thus reducing or abolishing the discrepancy between myocardial oxygen demand and supply within the mitral apparatus. It has also been reported to modify the auscultatory findings associated with this condition. The frequency of this mitral valve abnormality in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease is reviewed. It appears that prolapse of the posterior leaflet scallops in patients with significant obstructive coronary artery disease represents an intermediate stage before mitral insufficiency occurs. This group of patients with papillary muscle dysfunction includes those with prolapsed leaflets without mitral insufficiency, those with systolic murmurs and compensated heart failure and others with progressive cardiac decompensation and severe mitral regurgitation.", 
    "21": "This study describes seven patients with the mitral valve prolapse or click-murmur syndrome who have survived one or more episodes of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. These arrhythmias include cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, recurrent ventricular tachycardia causing syncope or sustained ventricular tachycardia requiring electroversion. These patients were seen over a two-year period in a single medical center. Five of the seven had repolarization abnormalities in the resting electrocardiogram. Premature ventricular contractions were present in the routine resting electrocardiograms of six of the seven patients and were frequent during treadmill testing and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in all six tested. There were electrolyte abnormalities or changes in medications known to affect myocardial repolarization during the week before the episode in three of the four patients with cardiac arrest. The diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse click-murmur syndrome was made prior to the episode of life-threatening arrhythmia in only two of the seven patients. Varying forms of antiarrhythmic therapy were given to these patients during follow-up periods of five to 26 months. Although the incidence of fatal arrhythmias in the mitral prolapse syndrome is probably small, we suggest that such arrhythmias may not be extremely rare, particularly among those patients who have repolarization abnormalities in the resting electrocardiogram and frequent premature beats. Patients with unexplained ventricular arrhythmias should be screened for mitral valve prolapse.", 
    "22": "The course of HOCM is characterized by a slow progression. Symptoms can often be influenced favourably by medical treatment. Altogether there is some difference between the course of untreated and the propranolol-treated patient groups which is, however, not statistically significant. Furthermore, the rate of sudden death is uninfluenced. Comparing clinical and haemodynamic results in medicically treated patients we find a reduction of the outflow tract obstruction in case with clinical improvement but not a reduction of the enddiastolic pressure. Independent on the clinical course there was a significant increase of the enddiastolic pressure after 5.5 years. We may conclude that there is a progredient process of hypertrophy which is uninfluenced by the obstruction and by conservative management. The best results are obtained in the operated group. According to our results a surgical intervention should possibly be considereed more generously.", 
    "23": "The effects of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent (propranolol) on erythropoietin production in carbon monoxide intoxicated mice were studied. The raise in plasma erythropoietin after a 4 hour intoxication with carbon monoxide was 47% less in the propranolol treated group. A decrease of 65% in the endogenous erythropoietic response after 75 minutes of carbon monoxide intoxication was found in policithemic treated mice, as against the untreated ones. The tissue oxygen tension was reduced in the propranolol treated group. No changes was found in the hemoglobin oxygen affinity.", 
    "24": "Dogs were given d,1-propranolol before and after thoracic inferior vena cava constriction (TIVCC) or renal artery constriction (RAC) to determine if the increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) and associated biological activity could be suppressed. Oral propranolol administration (240 mg twice daily) was begun at least 2 days prior to TIVCC in six dogs; heart rate was reduced from 133 to 95 beats/min but PRA did not change with propranolol administration. After TIVCC and during continued propranolol administration, daily renal sodium excretion fell from an average value of 50 to less than 3 mEq sodium/day and PRA was elevated two- to fourfold. With prolonged propranolol administration during TIVCC, PRA returned toward normal levels but renal sodium excretion remained low. At this time, hourly measurements of sodium excretion showed no change after a 240-mg oral dose or propranolol although very high plasma levels of propranolol were achieved; also, PRA was unchanged and low. The effects of RAC were studied before and during an intravenous propranolol infusion (0.2 mg/kg/hour) in conscious animals. Before propranolol administration, arterial pressure increased during RAC from 120 to 136 mm Hg and PRA doubled. Propranolol infusion lowered heart rate from 110 to 84 beats/min, but arterial pressure and PRA were not attentuated by propranolol during RAC. The data indicate that non-beta-adrenergic mechanisms are involved in renin release during TIVCC and RAC.", 
    "25": "The effect of histamine on serum free fatty acid (FFA) and glycerol levels was examined in humans and dogs in vivo. By the end of a 15-minute infusion of histamine diphosphate (11 mug of histamine per min i.v.), FFA levels in six male human volunteers had risen from basal values of 424 +/- 41 (mean +/- S.E.M.) to 909 +/- 45 muEq/1, and glycerol levels had risen from 66 +/- 5.5 to 124 +/- 9.3 mumol/1. These effects in man were not blocked by diphenhydramine, an H1-receptor antagonist, but were entirely blocked by propranolol, a beta adrenergic antagonist. Similar infusions of histamine (11 mug/min i.v.) in six anesthetized dogs caused FFA levels to rise from 189 +/- 13 to 461 +/- 92 muEq/1 and glycerol levels to rise from 58 +/- 3.7 to 157 +/- 22.4 mumol/1. These effects in the dog were not blocked by diphenhydramine or by propranolol but were entirely blocked by metiamide, an H2-receptor antagonist. These observations illustrate that low levels of histamine in vivo can produce significant elevations of serum FFA and glycerol levels in both humans and dogs. These results further suggest that the action of histamine in humans is indirect whereas the effect in dogs may be due to a direct action of histamine at the H2-receptor in canine adipose tissue.", 
    "26": "The effects of pentagastrin on lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure has been studied in trained, unanesthetized dogs. LES pressure was monitored by an infusion manometric technique. Increasing doses of pentagastrin up to 3 mug/kg given as an i.v. bolus resulted in increasing rises in LES pressure; larger doses resulted in a lesser effect of shorter duration. Increasing i.v. boluses of methacholine produced greater increases in LES pressure up to a maximum of 5 mug/kg; higher doses had similar effects. Atropine (50-100 mug/kg) slightly diminished the response of the LES to 2 or 6 mug/kg of pentagastrin. In large doses (500-2,000 mug/kg), atropine did not diminish the response to pentagastrin and prolonged the response of 6 mug/kg pentagastrin. Hexamethonium (2 mg/kg i.v.) depressed the peak response to 3 mug/kg pentagastrin slightly but the response to 6 mug/kg was increased and prolonged. Propranolol (2 mg/kg i.v.) significantly prolonged the effect of 6 mug/kg pentagastrin on the LES. We conclude that the stimulatory effect of pentagastrin is mainly due to a direct action on the LES. A lesser stimulatory effect is due to an action on preganglionic cholinergic neurons. Large doses of pentagastrin have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects. The inhibitory effect is mediated at least in part via preganglionic neurons acting through adrenergic receptors. Ganglionic transmission of the effect may be through muscarinic as well as nicotinic receptors.", 
    "27": "Seven men ran at 60% of individual maximal oxygen uptake to exhaustion during beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (P), during lipolytic blockade with nicotinic acid (N), or without drugs (C). The total work times (83 +/- 9 (P), 122 +/- 8 (N), 166 +/- 10 (C) min, mean and SE) differed significantly. Epinephrine rose progressively above preexercise levels (0.06 +/- 0.01 ng/ml); at exhaustion concentrations in P experiments (2.15 +/- 0.41) were larger than in N (1.08 +/- 0.31) and C (0.72 +/- 0.28) experiments. Norepinephrine increased consistently while insulin decreased. After an initial decrease glucagon concentrations increased progressively in parallel with declining plasma glucose and were at exhaustion always three times preexercise values. Thus beta-adrenergic blockade did not diminish the glucagon response. Nor was this response increased when alpha-receptor stimulation in P experiments was intensified. Carbohydrate combustion was smaller and NEFA and glycerol concentrations in serum larger during C experiments. Alanine concentrations were never raised at exhaustion. Accordingly, neither stimulation of adrenergic receptors nor NEFA and alanine concentrations are major determinants for the exercise-induced glucagon secretion in man. It is suggested that decreased glucose availability enhances the secretion of glucagon and epinephrine during prolonged exercise.", 
    "28": "1 Plasma concentrations of oxprenolol have been compared in six healthy volunteers after 80 and 160 mg doses of a new slow release (SR) oxprenolol preparation, after an 80 ng dose of conventional oxprenolol (CO), and after the second of two 80 mg doses of conventional oxprenolol given 12 h apart. Basal pulse rates and blood pressures, and pulse rates before and after a standard exercise test have been compared after the four active treatments and after a placebo. 2 Peak plasma concentrations of oxprenolol attained after 160 mg of the slow release preparation were similar to the peak concentrations after the single 80 mg dose of conventional oxprenolol. Higher concentrations, however, persisted for much longer after the slow release preparations than after the conventional preparations. 3 Neither oxprenolol formulation had any effect on resting pulse rate or blood pressure in normotensive volunteers. 4 Comparison with placebo showed that the single dose of the conventional oxprenolol produced a significant reduction in exercise induced tachycardia for 8 h whereas the high dose of the slow release preparation produced a similar reduction which lasted for at least 14 hours.", 
    "29": "The effect of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol was tested on positional tremor occurring during acute alcohol withdrawal using a double-blind crossover method and electrical recording of tremor amplitude and frequency. The difference between the effects of propranolol and placebo was not significant.", 
    "30": "Extreme hyperinsulinism was observed in endotoxin-shock dogs made hyperglycemic by glucose infusion. Qualitatively (at least in terms of gel filtration characteristics), the insulin secreted under these conditions was normal. Hyperinsulinism was not observed in endotoxin-shock dogs not given glucose. Thus hyperinsulinism does not explain the hypoglycemia so frequently observed in endotoxin-treated dogs. Hyperinsulinsm could not be impaired degradation of insulin as disappearance of labeled insulin as well as cold insulin was comparable in control and endotoxin-treated animals. An adrenergic mechanism (either beta receptor stimulation or postadrenergic hyperresponsiveness of the beta cells) probably does not explain the hyperinsulinism observed in endotoxin-shock dogs given glucose as beta blockade failed to inhibit the hyperinsulinsm. Hyperinsulinism was not observed in endotoxin-shock dogs given tolbuamide. A tenfold rise in plasma IRG was observed in endotoxin-treated dogs whether glucose was infused or not. The persistently low IRI levels in endotoxin-treated dogs not given glucose suggest that hyperresponsiveness of the beta cell to glucagon was not present in these animals. Extreme hyperinsulinsm in response to induced hyperglycemia in endotoxin-shock dogs is unexplained. Hyperresponsiveness of the beta cell to glucose during endotoxin shock seems likely.", 
    "31": "The effect of halofenate on beta adrenergic blockade by propranolol was studied in 4 subjects during chronic drug administration in a randomized, double-blind study. The plasma propranolol concentration was significantly lower during treatment with halofenate than with placebo. The reduction in propranolol levels correlated with a decrease in beta adrenergic blockade. The mechanism for the decrease in plasma concentration has not been determined.", 
    "32": "In experiments with mice evidence was obtained that a combination of apressin with obsidan and diprazine; of adenosine with nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide (NAD) and also a mixture of both combinations produce a marked protective effect in hypo and normobaric hypoxic hypoxia.", 
    "33": "The compound N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-naphthoxy)-propyl]-N'-bromoacetylethylenediamine (NHNP-NBE) was found to label covalently the beta-adrenergic receptor in turkey erythrocytes. The compound inhibits irreversibly 1-epinephrine-dependent adenylate cyclase activity [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] in the whole turkey erythrocyte as well as in the erythrocyte membranes possessing the beta-receptor. The affinity label blocks, also irreversibly, the specific [3H] propranolol binding, whereas other bromoacetyl compounds tested have no effect on binding, even at high concentrations, which cause enzyme inactivation. 1-Epinephrine and propranolol offer protection against the affinity label in whole turkey erythrocytes as well as in membranes prepared from these cells. The potential usefulness of an irreversible beta-antagonist is discussed.", 
    "34": "The present study was initiated to determine whether specific hormones would influence adenylate cyclase activity within the maxillary-palatal complex during formation of the hamster secondary palate. Stages from initial appearance of the palatal processes to shortly after birth were studied. Highest basal adenylate cyclase activities occurred during the earliest periods of palate development. This basal enzyme activity began to diminish as palatal fusion occurred and remained lowered until birth. Activation of adenylate cyclase by fluoride was maximal at concentrations of 5-10 mM, and was observed throughout the span of palatal development. Fluoride activation of adenylate cyclase was greatest prior to fusion of the palatal processes, then decreased until birth when a slightly increased enzymatic stimulation was seen. Norepinephrine and epinphrine were the catecholamines most capable of inducing increased activation of adenylate cyclase at most periods of palatal growth. Increased enzyme activity in the presence of norepinephrine was more susceptible to antagonism by the beta adrenergic agent, propranolol, than to the alpha adrenergic agent, phentolamine. The remaining catecholamines, namely isoproterenol and dopamine, displayed a lesser ability to activate the enzyme, and adenylate cyclase was not equally responsive to these catecholamines at identical developmental stages. Other hormones, i.e. histamine, serotonin, thyrotropin, growth hormone, thyroxine and glucagon were generally ineffective in activating the enzyme. Phosphodiesterase activity was not detected until shortly before birth.", 
    "35": "The hemodynamic changes observed in patients with the \"hyperkinetic\" form of borderline (labile) essential hypertension (BEH) could be related to the hyperresponsiveness of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors to catecholamines. The isoproterenol-induced increase in plasma cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) reflects the response of adenylate cyclase to beta-adrenergic stimulation, whereas a non-beta-receptor-mediated increase occurs with the administration of glucagon. Both substances were infused into 13 control subjects and 14 patients with the hyperkinetic form of BEH before and after propranolol administration. Baseline plasma cAMP concentrations were comparable in both groups. After 30 minutes of isoproterenol infusion (20 ng/kg per min) a significantly higher increase in plasma cAMP and heart rate and a smaller decrease in diastolic blood pressure were seen in this type of BEH than in control subjects. The increase in plasma cAMP and in heart rate correlated positively when all subjects were considered together. Propranolol abolished hemodynamic and humoral responses to a similar degree in both groups. The plasma cAMP responses to glucagon (200 ng/kg per min) were slightly lower in our patients with BEH than in control subjects and were not suppressed by propranolol. The data are compatible with a hyperreactivity of the beta-adrenergic receptors or of the adenylate cyclase or both in hyperkinetic BEH and could correspond to the previously observed exaggerated beta-adrenergic drive to the heart in this type of hypertension. The non-beta-receptor-mediated rise in plasma cAMP (glucagon), however, remains comparable in control subjects and BEH.", 
    "36": "1 The effects of acebutolol, practolol and propranolol (0,5-3 mM) on calcium uptake, calcium binding and ATPase activities of the rabbit and rat heart microsomal and mitochondrial fractions were investigated. 2 Dose-response and time course experiments revealed that propranolol greatly inhibited microsomal and mitochondrial calcium uptake whereas both acebutolol and practolol showed slight depressant effects. 3 The ATPase activities of microsomal and mitochondrial fractions were decreased by acebutolol, practolol and propranolol; however, the latter agent was more effective than the other two. 4 The inhibitory effects of acebutolol, practolol and propranolol on mitochondria and microsomes were not antagonized by adrenaline. 5 Propranolol decreased calcium binding by the microsomal fraction only, whereas acebutolol and practolol had no effect on microsomal or mitochondrial calcium binding. 6 The sensitivity of the rabbit heart subcellular fractions to the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs was similar to that of the rat heart; however, the calcium uptake and ATPase activities of microsomes were more sensitive to propranolol than mitochondria in both species. 7 Perfusion of rat hearts with 0.2-1 mM propranolol decreased contractile force, and microsomal and mitochondrial fractions obtained from these hearts accummulated less calcium in comparison to the control. On the other hand, acebutolol and practolol (0.2-1nM) had no appreciable effects on contractile force or subcellular fractions under similar conditions. 8 The negative inotropic effect of propranolol may partly be due to its inhibitory actions on calcium transport by subcellular organelles of the myocardium; the depressant action of propranolol on calcium transport is unlikely to be due to its beta-adrenoceptor blocking property.", 
    "37": "We advocate the use of propranolol in very low dosage at the end of operation to determine a prognosis of the long-term results to be expected after valvulotomy in diverse types of pulmonary stenosis.", 
    "38": "Experiments were conducted on dogs, cats and rats in which various disturbances of the cardiac rhythm were induced. Beta2-adrenoblocker alpheprol proved to produce a marked antiarrhythmic action. The preparation arrested the auricular arrhythmias caused by electric stimulation of the auricles or by aconitine application, eliminated the auricular arrhythmias resulting from occlusion of a branch of the coronary artery or oubaine intoxication, prevented lethal auricular fibrillation in rats after the calcium chloride intoxication. It is supposed that along with the beta-adrenoreceptor block the antiarrhythmic effect of alpheprol was also caused by quinidine-like action of the preparation.", 
    "39": "The assessment of ventricular vulnerability by inducing ventricular fibrillation (VF) presents limitations when neural activity is being investigated, especially in the unanesthetized animal. As repetitive extrasystoles (RE) have been observed to precede the occurrence of VF, it was relevant to determine whether the RE threshold provides a reliable index of cardiac susceptivility to fibrillation. The RE and VF threshold relationships were studied in 32 chloralose-anesthetized dogs during left stellate ganglion stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, and beta-adrenergic blockage with practolol. The vulnerable period was scanned at 1-ms intervals and at 2-mA increments with a single, 2-ms, constant-current cathodal stimulus; RE and multiple RE were induced reproducibly when 66% and 82%, respectively, of the fibrillatory current was administered. The nadirs for RE and multiple RE were coincident in the cardiac cycle with the vulnerable-period threshold for VF. Stellate and vagal stimulation and beta-adrenergic blockade resulted in comparable changes in RE and VF thresholds and produced equivalent shifts in the cardiac cycle of the RE and VF vulnerable-period nadirs. These observations suggest that RE and VF phenomena share a common electrophysiologic basis and that the RE threshold can be used as an end point for measuring ventricular vulnerability to VF.", 
    "40": "Nonachlazine (2 micrometer) blocked significantly the uptake 1 of endogenic noradrenaline in the myocardial tissues and in adrenergic neurons of vas deferens. The uptake II, as well as the intensity and dynamics of the noradrenaline release were not affected by nonachlazine. These processes resulted in an increase of free noradrenaline concentrations in the synaptic space. The latter seems to be a result of the mediator's passage into the nerve fibers (through axonal membranes) and into the granule, this being due to the nonachlazine-induced block. It is suggested that the metabolic and functional nonachlazine effects are related to the beta-adrenergic receptors stimulation, mediated through the agency of noradrenaline.", 
    "41": "A new theory is presented to describe the effect of functional antagonism on the competitive antagonism between adrenergic beta-mimetics and beta-blockers. According to this theory the shape of the log (dose ratio-1) vs.--log [B] curve and the apparent pA2 value in competitive antagonism should be affected by functional antagonism when the agonist is taken up by the saturable uptake process, and this was experimentally confirmed. The competitive antagonism between isoproterenol (ISO) and propranolol (Prop) was influenced by the functional antagonism between ISO and spasmogens (histamine and carbachol). The log (dose ratio-1) vs. --log [B] curve is ISO-Prop competitive antagonism was shifted variously depending on the concentration of a spasmogen used. Theoretical predictions and experimental results were in good parallel.", 
    "42": "New equations which can explain the following characteristic phenomena in the functional antagonism between isoproterenol (ISO) and spasmogens in guinea-pig trachea are proposed: (1) The amplitude of relaxation of the muscle induced by ISO varied depending on the concentration of a spasmogen used (histamine or carbachol). (2) The dose-response curves for the relaxation by ISO shifted to the right in a parallel manner as the concentration of the spasmogen increased, and became stationary at high concentrations of the spasmogen. (3) The slope of the dose-response curve became steeper with increasing concentrations of the spasmogen. When the saturable uptake process of ISO was taken into consideration, a satisfactory parallel was seen between the theoretical dose-response curves and the present experimental results.", 
    "43": "Experiments were performed with preparations obtained by medial transection of the rat vas deferens. Eight sympathomimetic drugs: noradrenaline, alpha-methylnoradrenaline, phenylephrine, dopamine, tyramine, amphetamine, cocaine and isoprenaline, were applied to preparations which were field-stimulated at 10 sec intervals. On the testicular half of the tissue all except isoprenaline enhanced twitches and/or caused contractions. These effects were blocked by alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists. On the urethral preparation all except phenylephrine, which often enhanced twitches, inhibited responses to field stimulation. These effects were not blocked by alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists or by propranolol, though the latter blocked inhibitory effects of isoprenaline on both segments. Inhibitory responses to tyramine persisted in urethral segments treated with cocaine and in urethral segments taken from reserpine-treated rats, and thus tyramine may have some direct action. No regional variation was observed in response to acetylcholine or carbachol. High potassium concentrations were equally effective in contracting both segments, but the time courses of contractions differed. These experiments confirm a density gradient of excitatory alpha-adrenoreceptors along the length of the rat vas deferens.", 
    "44": "The effect of Trimepranol on the binding of 3H norepinephrine to myocardial particles from dogs (to fractions 1,000 g and 78,000 g resp.) has been studied and compared with the effect of propranolol, isoprenaline, phentolamine and ephedrine. Displacement of 3H norepinephrine by propranolol and isoprenaline was found in both fractions. Trimepranol, in low concentrations, inhibited the binding of 3H norepinephrine; in higher concentrations the binding of 3H norepinephrine was stimulated. Phentolamine and ephedrine were without effect in both fractions. The problem of specificity of adrenergic binding sites is discussed.", 
    "45": "Since 1-(7-indenyloxy)-3-isopropylaminopropane-2-ol hydrochloride (YB-2) has been reported to be a potent beta-adrenergic blocking agent with antiarrhythmic effects, the electrophysiological effects of this compound on guinea-pig and canine heart muscle were examined. YB-2 was found to have typical quinidine-like actions such as decrease in rate of rise of the action potential, prolongation of refractory period and decrease in conduction velocity.", 
    "46": "The cyclic AMP generating system in slices of the rat limbic forebrain was investigated. In consists of: (u) A noradrenergic system which responds to norepinephrine (NE) and isoproterenol. Though the rise of the nucleotide elicited by isoproterenol is more rapid than that caused by NE, the maximal effect is less than half of that induced by NE; (2) an adenosine-dependent system. The noradrenergic cyclic AMP generating system in the limbic forebrain displays a number of properties of a central NE receptor: it develops supersensitivity to NE and isoproterenol following prolonged deprivation of NE at postsynaptic sites (chronic treatment with reserpine or chemosympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine). When noradrenergic terminals are protected from 6-hydroxydopamine by desmethylimipramine, the responses to NE are not enhanced. Responses to NE are blocked by both propranolol and phentolamine, while responses to isoproterenol are blocked by propranolol but not by phentolamine. The adenosine-dependent system does not develop supersensitivity after central chemosympathectomy and is not blocked by either alpha- or beta-antagonists. While not altering the basal level of the nucleotide, clinically effective antipsychotic drugs caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the limbic noradrenergic cyclic AMP response with clozapine and pimozide being particularly potent (IC50 0.06 and 0.08 muM, respectively). Antipsychotic drugs do, however, not affect cyclic AMP responses elicited by adenosine. The results are compatible with the view that the central NE receptor is closely related to or may be an integral part of an adenylate cyclase system and that its blockade in the limbic forebrain by antipsychotic drugs may contribute to their therapeutic action.", 
    "47": "The epinephrine-induced loss and subsequent uptake of K+ by the liver was studied by measuring hepatic arterio-venous K+ differences and splanchnic blood flows in anesthetized dogs with chronically implanted portal vein catheters and celiac and superior mesenteric artery flow probes. When epinephrine was administered intraportally, neither alpha- nor beta-adrenergic blockade, singly or in combination, had significant effects upon the hyperkalemic or the hypokalemic phases in either hepatic venous or systemic arterial blood. It was concluded that the movements of K+ into and out of the liver caused by epinephrine are not mediated by the classical adrenergic receptors as defined by inhibition by specific blocking agents.", 
    "48": "Beta-Adrenergic stimulation of the ventral prostate cyclic-AMP system was investigated by examining the influence of isoproterenol on endogenous cyclic-AMP levels as well as on the activities of adenylate cyclase CEC 4.6.1.1) and cyclic-AMP-dependent and independent protein kinases (EC 2.7.1.37). Administration of isoproterenol (1 mg/kg, ip) resulted in rapid elevation of adenylate cyclase activity (119%) and cyclic-AMP levels (593%). The observed isoproterenol-stimulated changes in cyclic-AMP metabolism of the ventral prostate were time-dependent and maximal stimulation was seen 5 min after treatment with this beta-adrenergic agonist. The increases in prostatic adenylate cyclase and cyclic-AMP also were related to the dose of isoproterenol administered and maximal enhancement of these parameters was seen with 1 mg/kg dose of the agonist. Whereas pretreatment of rats with propranolol (3mg/kg, ip) partially reversed these alterations, administration of an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, even at a dose of 5 mg/kg, failed to elicit any appreciable effect. Stimulation of prostatic soluble protein kinase by isoproterenol was associated with a decrease (33%) in the activity of the cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase with a concomitant increase (25%) in that of the independent enzyme. Whereas the ability of the enzyme to bind cyclic-(3H) AMP in vitro was decreased (54%) following isoproterenol treatment, the protein kinase activity ratio (-cyclic-AMP/+cyclic AMP) was significantly elevated from 0.51+/0.05 to 0.95+/0.08. Although propranolol alone had little or no effect on these parameters, it inhibited partially the isoproterenol-induced alterations in cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase and the cyclic-AMP binding capacity. Treatment with propranolol also blocked the increases in the kinase activity ratio and in the activity of cyclic-AMP-independent enzyme seen with isoproterenol. Data suggest that the concentration of ventral prostate cyclic-AMP as well as the activities of adenylate cyclase and cyclic-AMP-dependent and independent form of protein kinases are subject to modulation by beta-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "49": "Urinary output of Na+ and K+, and volume of urine have been studied in conscious, unrestrained, water-loaded male rats following the intraseptal injection of catecholamines. Natriuresis and kaliuresis increased after injecting noradrenaline (NA), the intensity being dose related. The dose-response curve suggests that a monomolecular interacting takes place between NA and pharmacological receptors present in the septal area. No change was observed in diuresis. Systematic mapping of the septal area yielded about the same results for all sites except a zone located in the lateral nucleus that was more sensitive. An alpha blocker (dibenamine), injected intraseptally before NA, showed an inhibitory effect while a beta blocker (propranolol) yielded a potentiation effect. These same effects of the blocking agents were observed when adrenaline was used instead of NA. Lidocaine, which inhibits the re-uptake of NA, showed an enhancement of the natriuretic and kaliuretic effect of NA, and the same effect was observed when the enzymatic destruction of NA was prevented by nialamide, an inhibitor of monoaminoxidase. Dopamine showed a natriuretic effect, but no effect was observed on K+ and urine output. Serotonin had no action on natriuresis, kaliuresis and diuresis.", 
    "50": "The influence of beta-adrenergic antagonists (propranolol, pronethalol, alprenolol, isopropylmethoxamine, H 35/25, sotalol and practolol) on isotonic contractile responses to norepinephrine (NE) was studies. All drugs caused an increase in the maximum responses while depressant effects were seen only with high doses of propranolol, pronethalol and alprenolol. The enhancement of responses to NE was considerably greater at low concentrations of calcium (0.5-1.0 mM) than at high (8 mM) concentrations. The inhibitory effects of propranolol, pronethalol and alprenolol were diminished but not completely overcome by increasing calcium concentrations form 1.8 to 8 mM. Cumulative dose-response curves of calcium showed no increase in maximum responses although responses to low concentrations of calcium were augmented by sotalol and practolol. Evidence suggests that the enhancing effects of these drugs may be due to their facilitatory effect on calcium mobilization following alpha-adrenoceptor activation while their depressant properties probably reflect their membrane stabilizing properties.", 
    "51": "Hemodynamic studies (using (131)I-labeled albumin [RISA]) Were performed before and 5 and 42 weeks after the oral administration of pindolol (av. 30 mg/day), oxprenolol (av. 216 mg/day), propranolol (av. 75 mg/day) or bufetolol hydrochloride (av. 30 mg/day) in 40 patients with essential hypertension. Responders to the antihypertensive actions of short-term (5 weeks) pindolol or bufetolol showed a reduction in total peripheral resistance (pindolol, from av. 2622 to 2022 dyne-sec-cm-5-m2; befetolol, from av. 3301 to 2620, p less than 0.05), without significant changes in cardiac index, while hypotensive actions of propranolol or oxprenolol appeared to be due mainly to a decrease in cardiac output (propranolol, from av. 4.03 to 2.99 L/min/m2; oxprenolol, from av. 3.97 to 3.29 L/min/m2), although the decrease in cardiac output was not significant. In long-term (42 weeks) oxprenolol therapy, antihypertensive effects seemed to be related to reduced cardiac output and a readaptation of peripheral resistance to chronic reduction of cardiac output was not always observed. Circulation time was determined in 9 patients with oxprenolol therapy and 8 with pindolol therapy by the measurement of the arrival time in the cerebral hemisphere of the intravenously injected radioisotope. The patients with oxprenolol therapy showed significant prolongation in circulation time (short-term administration, av. 6.6 to 8.4 sec; long-term administration av. 6.6 to 9.2 sec, p less than 0.05), while no prolongation was observed in pindolol therapy. These results suggest that hemodynamic responses to beta-blocking agents are not uniform and that the antihypertensive actions of beta-blockers depend on the effects on both cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance.", 
    "52": "1 The compound Org 6001 (3alpha-amino-2beta-hydroxy-5alpha-androstan-17-one hydrochloride) was found in recent experiments to exhibit anti-arrhythmic activity. Evidence is presented in this paper concerning its mode of action. 2 Org 6001 was 1.8 times more potent than procaine as a local anaesthetic on desheathed frog nerve. 3 Org 6001 had no effect on the resting potential of isolated cardiac muscle of rabbit, but greatly reduced the maximum rate of depolarization tion (MRD).

    "53": "1 The potencies of fifteen beta-adrenoceptor agonists of widely differing chemical structures were compared with that of (-)-isoprenaline on bronchial muscle, soleus muscle, blood pressure and heart rate in the anaesthetized cat. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist potencies of propranolol and practolol were determined against (-)-isoprenaline in the same model. 2 (-)-Isoprenaline was the most potent agonist and its action was essentially unselective. Thus, on all four parameters the minimal effective dose was 0.003-0.01 mug/kg and maximal or near maximal responses were produced by 0.3-1 mug/kg. Trimetoquinol was also an essentially unselective agonist. 3 For thirteen of the remaining fourteen agonists, potency was similar on bronchial muscle, soleus muscle and blood pressure but significantly lower on heart rate. 4 The remaining agonist - AH 7616 (4-hydroxy-alpha1-[[(1-methyl-3,3-diphenyl-propyl)amino]-methyl]-m-xylene-alpha1, alpha3-diol, acetate) - was also significantly less potent on heart rate than on the other parameters; in addition, it was clearly less potent on soleus muscle and blood pressure than on bronchial muscle when 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was used to induce bronchospasm. However, when acetylcholine was used instead of 5-HT the potency of AH 7616 on induce bronchospasm. However, when acetylcholine was used instead of 5-HT the potency of AH 7616 on bronchial muscle, soleus muscle and blood pressure was very similar. AH 7616 may therefore possess a specific 5-HT antagonist action in addition to its beta-adrenoceptor agonist action. 5 The fifteen test agonists were longer acting than (-)-isoprenaline and this was particularly true of trimetoquinol and soterenol. 6 The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist potency of propranolol was almost identical on bronchial muscle, soleus muscle and blood pressure and very slightly lower on the heart. Practolol was 10-12 times more potent on the heart than on bronchial muscle, soleus muscle and blood pressure. 7 These findings suggest that it may not be possible to separate the bronchodilating and tremorenhancing properties of beta-adrenoceptor agonists. The results with agonists and antagonists are in accord with Lands' dual beta-adrenoceptor sub-classification.", 
    "54": "Cardiac slowing during elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) could be due to direct activation of central nervous system (CNS) centers or it may be secondary to baroreceptor reflexes activated by the associated pressor response. In five pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs when ICP was raised to 50 mmHg the heart rate decreased 34.4 beats/min (+/-4.8 SE). This cardiac slowing occurred when ICP was elevated after sinoaortic denervation (-24 +/- 4.43 beats/min) and also during elevated ICP when changes in arterial pressure were prevented (-32.3 +/- 4.25 beats/min). These results indicate that the cardiac slowing is largely of CNS origin. In dogs given morphine with pentobarbital to achieve slower heart rates, raising ICP to 50 mmHg by left-sided intracranial balloon inflation led to cardiac dysrhythmias in 9 of 12 dogs. By contrast, raising ICP to 50 mmHg by right-sided intracranial balloon inflation only produced progressive sinus bradycardia. These responses were related to a combined enhancement of vagal and sympathetic activity. Differences observed between right- and left-sides balloon inflation may be partly related to asymmetrical engagement of the cardiac autonomic nerves. The results suggest that left-sided intracranial lesions are more likely to produce cardiac dysrhythmias.", 
    "55": "Recent studies indicate that coronary vessels have alpha- and beta-2-adrenergic receptors and that the alpha receptors are functionally innervated. We studied whether the beta-2-vasodilator receptors are functionally innervated, using a dog in situ modified Langendorff preparation with constant coronary perfusion pressure. The beating, nonworking heart and systemic circulation were supported with a pump oxygenator. Stimulation of the left stellate ganglion increased coronary blood flow and decreased coronary sinus oxygen tension from prestimulation control values. After beta-1-receptor blockade (practolol, 10 mg/kg), stellate stimulation decreased coronary blood flow and decreased coronary sinus oxygen tension from prestimulation control values, revealing alpha-receptor vasoconstriction. After the addition of alpha-receptor blockade (Dibozane, 5 mg/kg), stellate stimulation increased coronary blood flow and coronary sinus oxygen tension a small amount from prestimulation values. Finally, after the addition of beta-2-receptor blockade (propranolol, 2 mg/kg), stellate stimulation increased flow and coronary sinus oxygen tension slightly from prestimulation control values. Direct intracoronary injections of isoproterenol, norepinephrine, and epinephrine gave results consistent with the presence of beta-1 myocardial receptors and alpha and beta-2 coronary receptors. We conclude that there is little functional innervation of coronary vascular beta-2 receptors. Intracoronary injections of isoproterenol and epinephrine activated beta-2-receptor coronary vasodilation after beta-1-receptor blockade, but norepinephrine did not.",

    "57": "Timolol ophthalmic solutions 0.5 per cent, 1.0 per cent, and 1.5 per cent lowered intraocular pressures significantly in normal human volunteers. Maximum lowering of the intraocular pressures was reached at two hours with the 0.5 per cent solution of timolol and at one hour with the 1.0 per cent and 1.5 per cent timolol ophthalmic solutions. The effect lasted the full seven hours of observations. No objective or subjective evidence of ocular irritation could be attributed to the drug. A single dose of timolol applied topically to the eyes of normal human volunteers had no effect on pupillary size, visual acuity, blood pressure, or pulse rate.", 
    "58": "The effect of vagus nerve stimulation on ventricular excitability was studied in 28 dogs under various conditions of adrenergic neural tone. Strength-interval curves were delineated from the apex of the right ventricular endocardium with a transvenous bipolar catheter. Vagus nerve stimulation in both closed chest and open chest dogs shifted the strength-interval curve 6 to 8 msec later into electrical diastole (P less than 0.001). Left stellate ganglion stimulation shifted the strength-interval curve 9 to 11 msec earlier into diastole (P less than 0.001). The effect of simultaneous left stellate ganglion and vagus nerve stimulation was not significantly different from that of left stellate ganglion stimulation alone. The influence of vagus nerve stimulation on the strength-interval curve under basal conditions was abolished by acute beta adrenergic blockade with propranolol. It is concluded that vagus nerve stimulation affects ventricular excitability as well as vulnerability by opposing the effects of sympathetic neural tone.", 
    "59": "Dopamine and isoproterenol, although used primarily for their inotropic effects, are also potent vasoactive substances. To determine their effects on the pulmonary circulation, we cannulated the left lower lobe bronchus in 20 dogs to permit ventilation with either air or a mixture of 95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide; systemic oxygenation was maintained by venitlating the right lung with 95% oxygen. The lobe was perfused at a controlled flow rate and left atrial pressure was held constant. Hypoxic ventilation increased the lobar vascular resistance by 52% (p less than 0.001). Dopamine infusion (20 mcg. per kilogram per minute) during air ventilation also increased lobar vascular resistance by 50% (p less than 0.001). During hypoxic ventilation, dopamine increased the resistance by an additional 19% (p less than 0.001). In contrast, isoproterenol (0.2 mcg. per kilogram per minute) abolished the hypoxic pressor response (p less than 0.001). Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade did not alter hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction, whereas phentolamine blocked the dopamine response and propranolol abolished the isoproterenol-induced vasodilation. These results indicate the following: (1) The hypoxic pressor response is independent of sympathetic innervation; (2) dopamine in dogs is a pulmonary vasoconstrictor; and (3) isoproterenol is a pulmonary vasodilator. If these findings can be extrapolated to man, isoproterenol may be the preferred inotropic agent in patients with an elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.", 
    "60": "To explore the possibility that the presence of propranolol-induced beta-adrenergic blockade might have an adverse effect upon homeostatic circulatory reflexes activated by the administration of a potent vasodilator agent, arterial blood pressure and pulse rate response to rapid intravenous diazoxide injection was monitored before and after pretreatment with propranolol in ten hypertensive patients. It appeared that beta-adrenergic blockade had no clinically significant effect on the magnitude of hypotension or the degree of heart rate acceleration induced by the administration of the potent vasodilator diazoxide. This reflex vasodilator-induced cardio-acceleration after propranolol adminstration could be the result of incomplete blockade of endogenously released neurotransmitter, inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system, or a direct pharmacologic action of diazoxide. Diazoxide administration to hypertensive patients in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade was not associated with any clinically significant hemodynamic consequences.", 
    "61": "Increased renal prostaglandins activated by beta-catecholamines could produce renal tubular sodium wasting and angiotensin pressor resistance observed in Bartter's syndrome. We therefore measured plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone and prostaglandin A (PGA) by radioimmunoassay, and body composition by isotope dilution prior to and following beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (200 mg/day for 4 days) and prostaglandin synthesis inhibition by indomethacin (200 mg/day for 4 days) in a patient with Bartter's syndrome on a 250 meq sodium diet. After the administration of propranolol, body weight increased 3 kg, daily urine sodium decreased within 24 hours from 230 to 64 meq, and urine potassium from 102 to 45 meq, but PRA and the aldosterone level remained elevated. With the administration of indomethacin, body weight increased 5 kg, daily urinary sodium decreased within 24 hours to 11meq and urine potassium to 16 meq, PRA (normal less than 3 ng/100 ml/hour) decreased from 55 to 4.3 ng/ml/hour, plasma aldosterone (normal less than 8 ng/100 ml) from 74.1 to 3.6 ng/100 ml, and whole blood PGA (normal 546 +/- 307 pg/ml) decreased from 1,390 and 945 to 86 pg/ml. After the administration of propranolol or indomethacin, exchangeable sodium, total body water, extracellular volume and plasma volume all increased from less than to greater than predicted, and pressor resistance to angiotensin was normalized. These results suggest that Bartter's syndrome results from beta adrenergic and prostaglandin-mediated proximal tubular rejection of sodium leading to increased distal sodium-potassium exchange.", 
    "62": "The blood pressure response to propranolol treatment was analyzed retrospectively in 187 patients with benign essential hypertension. In most patients (102 patients, 54 per cent) systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure was decreased by more than 10 per cent (responders). No significant change in blood pressure occurred in 35 per cent (65 patients) of the patients (nonresponders). Surprisingly, in 20 patients (11 per cent) systolic (8 patients) and/or diastolic (14 patients) blood pressure was increased by more than 7 per cent (pressor-responders). All three subgroups received similar amounts of propranolol and irrespective of the effect on the blood pressure, propranolol produced a similar reduction in pulse rates, suggesting similar degree of beta blockade. The three subgroups did not differ in their clinical characteristics, except that the nonresponders were significantly older than the responders. Pretreatment renin values were highest in the responders, somewhat lower in the nonresponders and significantly lower in the pressor-responders. In a representative subset of 66 patients, control and treatment values for plasma renin activity and aldosterone excretion were compared. The responders had the most pronounced decreases in both renin and aldosterone. In striking contrast, no significant changes were observed in the two hormones in those patients whose blood pressure levels rose. Moreover, in the pressor-responders, the drug produced the greatest increases in body weight, reflecting sodium retention. The differences in blood pressure responses observed in different patients may be explained by various interplays between the drug-induced suppression of renin and aldosterone, and the operation of unapposed or reactive alpha sympathetic activity. The latter is presumably active in all patients tending to cause vasoconstriction and hence an increase in peripheral resistance. In the pressor-responders such unopposed alpha-tone combined with the demonstrated lack of renin and aldosterone suppression with attendant fluid retention could work to produce the paradoxical pressor responses. In contrast, in those whose blood pressure levels drop, the drug-induced suppression of renin leads to decreased peripheral resistance despite the unopposed alphatone. The accompanying decrease in aldosterone limits sodium retention and contributes to the fall in blood pressure levels.", 
    "63": "The treatment response to beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs was compared in two groups of patients with primary (essential) hypertension and different renin levels. Each group consisted of 25 patients and was equally distributed regarding age, severity and stage of hypertension. In the first group (group 1), the mean upright plasma renin activity was 0.8 ng ml-1h-1 (range 0.3 to 1.5) and the patients were considered to have low renin hypertension. In the other group (group 2) the patients had a mean plasma renin activity of 2.1 ng ml-1h-1 (range 1.1 to 5.1) and were considered to have normal to high renin hypertension. In both groups the patients were initially treated with beta-blocking drugs; in group 1 with a beta-blocker corresponding to an average dose of 311 mg propranolol a day for at least eight weeks and in group 2 with propranolol 320 mg a day in a fixed dose for eight weeks. The hypotensive response differed significantly between the two groups (p less than 0.001). In group 1 the pretreatment blood pressure was 197/117 mm Hg supine and 198/120 mm Hg standing. During treatment blood pressure decreased only 5/3 mm Hg supine and 9/5 mm Hg standing. The pretreatment blood pressure in group 2 was 187/114 mm Hg supine and 186/117 mm Hg standing. Beta-blocking therapy reduced blood pressure 36/23 and 34/18 mm Hg, respectively (both p less than 0.001). Pulse rates fell significantly in the two groups, both in the lying and standing positions. In 17 patients with low renin hypertension (group 1), a volume-depleting drug was added (spironolactone, 14 patients; thiazides, 3 patients) and this achieved a marked fall in blood pressure levels of 38/16 mm Hg supine and 37/19 mm Hg standing (both p less than 0.001). These results suggest the following: (1) Most patients with normal to high plasma renin activity respond well to moderate doses of propranolol. (2) Propranolol given in the same doses is almost without antihypertensive effect in patients with low renin hypertension. (3) A volume factor may be operating in patients with low renin hypertension since a hypotensive effect is demonstrated after the addition of volume-depleting drugs. (4) Determination of plasma renin activity with adequate methods can predict the treatment response to hypotensive agents.", 
    "64": "Acebutolol, a new cardioselective beta-blocking agent, was administered for 48 hours to 44 patients with essential hypertension at a total dosage of 2.0 g (2,000 mg). The slowing down of their pulse rate and the decrease in blood pressure were highly significant, whereas eight subjects treated with placebos had no change in either the pulse rate or blood pressure. Plasma renin activity decreased from 2.26 +/- 2.11 ng/ml/hour to 0.87 +/- 1.04 ng/ml/hour. The decrease in blood pressure was correlated with the initial plasma renin activity and with the decrease in plasma renin activity. These results demonstrate that a rapid decrease in blood pressure can be obtained in patients with essential hypertension treated with acebutolol and that the decrease in blood pressure is related to the initial state of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "65": "There is good evidence from many sources that beta-adrenoreceptor blockade is an effective form of therapy in mild, moderate and severe hypertension either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Although a number os such beta blocking compounds are now available, they appear to have a hypotensive effect of approximately equal magnitude. This hypotensive effect is obtained in both the supine and standing positions thus avoiding postural hypotension. The maximum hypotensive effect may take some time to become apparent. Despite considerable work the mode of action remains uncertain, reduction in cardiac output, resetting of baroreceptors, reduction in plasma renin and a central nervous system effect have been suggested but remain unproved. There is evidence to suggest that these compounds can control, to some degree, the surges in blood pressure resulting from either mental or physical stress. A low incidence of serious side effects has been reported by many workers. Only the long-term use of these compounds in comparison with other antihypertensive agents will determine their place in the management of hypertension.", 
    "66": "Ten patients, mean age 48 years, with essential hypertension of stage I and II according to the WHO classification, were studied at rest and during work before and after an average of two and 16 months of oral treatment with the beta-adrenergic blocking agent, pindolol. The pindolol treatment caused a significant decrease in the systemic systolic and diastolic blood pressure, both at rest and during work. Three mechanisms seem to be involved in the antihypertensive effect of pindolol: (1) a negative chronotropic effect on the heart, (2) a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, and (3) an increase in venous capacitance affecting the venous return. However, the significance of these mechanisms seems to differ when the situations after two months of treatment are compared with those after 16 months of treatment. In the beginning, a decrease in cardiac output seems to be the main cause of the lowering of the blood pressure; later, a decrease in systemic vascular resistance might be of greater importance.", 
    "67": "The antihypertensive effect of intravenous (acute) and oral (long-term) beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol or pindolol was evaluated in 46 male patients with either borderline (group I; 23 patients) or sustained (group II; 23 patients) essential hypertension. Arterial pressure, plasma renin activity and plasma concentration of aldosterone were determined during continuous recumbency overnight every 30 minutes before and after treatment. Patients of group I exhibited a marked variation of their recumbent plasma renin activity with relatively low values before midnight and large increases early in the morning. In contrast, low plasma renin activity values and only minimal fluctuations in renin were observed in patients of group II. Plasma renin activity had a consistent relationship with blood pressure both after acute (r = 0.79) and long-term (r = 0.4) beta-blockade. In four patients of group I, who had high plasma renin activity and had responded to intravenous propranolol, infusion of angiotensin II inhibitor did not lower pressure. In group I following beta-blockade, day-night profiles of renin were similar to those observed in group II before treatment. Thus in this latter subgroup, low renin profiles might reflect reduced beta-adrenergic activity. Acute as well as long-term beta-blockade consistently eliminated the day-night rhythm of plasma renin activity, but it did not change rhythm of plasma concentration of aldosterone. Plasma concentration of aldosterone was lower in group II but appeared to be inappropriately high relative to renin levels. These observations suggest that in hypertensive patients classified according to blood pressure and recumbent plasma renin activity profiles a significant relationship exists between changes in plasma renin activity and arterial pressure responses. Thus, patients with high renin levels respond better to treatment than patients with low renin levels. We conclude that in the patients studied, sympathetic nervous system activity mainly determined renin levels as well as antihypertensive effectiveness of the beta-blocking drugs.", 
    "68": "The unique action of propranolol and other beta blockers in lowering raised arterial pressure is discussed. Although the onset of the antihypertensive effect is not immediate, many trials have confirmed the efficacy of these drugs. Animal experiments have thrown little light on the mechanism of action of beta blockers in hypertension: this may be because in animals, especially the rat, peripheral beta adrenoceptor vasodilatation is relatively more important than in man. Five principal theories have been advanced to explain the antihypertensive effect. None of these, the renin, central nervous system, cardiac, baroceptor or metabolite theory, is totally satisfactory. A new theory is proposed suggesting that the essential action is to diminish sympathetic nerve output by damping sensory input to the central nervous system from a heart whose capacity to respond to exercise and stress is blunted by beta adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "69": "DL-Propranolol was shown to reduce the elevated urinary excretion of porphyrins and their precursors in a patient with variegate porphyria and to improve the patient's symptoms during attacks of the disease."
