    "0": "Although arginine vasopressin (AVP) is elevated in heart failure, inhibition of the vasopressinergic V1-receptor produces minimal changes in blood pressure. To determine whether the V1 vasoconstrictor effect is attenuated in heart failure, we randomly administered three increasing doses of AVP and methoxamine intravenously to 11 dogs with right-sided congestive heart failure (RHF) and 7 sham-operated dogs. Plasma AVP was elevated in RHF (21 +/- 3 pg/ml) compared with sham-operated dogs (3.8 +/- 0.6 pg/ml). While the pressor response to methoxamine was similar in the two groups, AVP caused a smaller increase in mean aortic pressure in RHF dogs than sham-operated dogs. To determine whether the difference in the pressor response to AVP was caused by greater reflex withdrawal of the sympathetic activity in RHF than sham-operated dogs, we also administered AVP after these animals had been pretreated with prazosin and propranolol. Adrenoceptor blockade exaggerated the pressor response to AVP; however, the increase in mean aortic pressure was still smaller in RHF than sham-operated dogs. The diminished pressor response in adrenoceptor-blocked RHF dogs was associated with a smaller increase in total peripheral vascular resistance compared with similarly treated sham dogs. Thus, although the pressor response to AVP was offset by baroreflex activation, the attenuated pressor effect of AVP in heart failure cannot be explained by sympathetic withdrawal alone. AVP probably exerts a smaller direct vasoconstrictor effect when the vasopressinergic system is chronically activated in heart failure.", 
    "1": "Adenosine exerts pronounced depressant effects on cardiac pacemakers. Previous studies in vitro have indicated that different pacemakers exhibit variable sensitivity to adenosine: ventricular greater than junctional greater than sinus node pacemakers. This study tested the hypothesis that ventricular pacemakers are more sensitive to adenosine than sinus node pacemakers in vivo in an experimental canine model and determined the mechanism involved in this phenomenon using specific pharmacological interventions. For this purpose, dogs with chronic atrioventricular block, stable ventricular escape rhythm, and bilateral stellectomy and cervical vagotomy were studied. Dose-response curves for negative chronotropic action of adenosine in the sinus node and ventricular pacemakers were obtained in group 1 under base-line conditions, during isoproterenol infusion, and after subsequent administration of propranolol; in group 2 before and after administration of quinidine; in group 3 before and after administration of aminophylline; and in group 4 before and after administration of 1,3-dipropyl-8-phenylxanthine amine congener (XAC). Adenosine exerted a dose-dependent negative chronotropic effect on sinus node and ventricular pacemakers. At all doses tested, this action was more pronounced in the ventricle. Isoproterenol accentuated the action of adenosine in the sinus node (by 60-138%; P less than 0.05) but suppressed it in the ventricle (-37 to 53%; P less than 0.05). These effects of isoproterenol were attenuated by propranolol. Quinidine suppressed the action of adenosine in the sinus node (-38 to -52%; P less than 0.05) but not in the ventricle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "Thirty patients suffering from WHO I-II class slight-moderate essential arterial hypertension were treated with a beta-blocker (Penbutolol) alone and once a day to assess its antihypertensive effectiveness and its affect on heart frequency, lipid metabolism and kidney function. The drug proved highly effective in reducing P.A.S. and P.A.D. values and no negative influence was documented on lipid metabolism, kidney function or heart frequency.", 
    "3": "Deep hypothermia with total circulatory arrest is an important technique in the surgical treatment of complex congenital heart defects. The effects of propranolol on cerebral electrical activity in lambs undergoing a 90-minute period of circulatory arrest after initial surface cooling to 26 degrees C and subsequent core cooling to 15 degrees C was studied by means of the cerebral function analyzing monitor. Five of the lambs were pretreated with intravenous propranolol 0.2 mg/kg (group I) and five acted as controls (group II). The surface cooling phase was associated with a continuous decrease in mean electroencephalographic voltage +/- standard error, which decreased from 82.8 +/- 11.8 microV at 37 degrees C to 31.6 +/- 2.4 microV at 26 degrees C in the control group compared with 75.0 +/- 7.4 microV and 63.2 +/- 9.2, respectively, in the propranolol group (p less than 0.05). During the rewarming phase, the latency to (1) initial appearance of electrical activity, (2) continuous recording with the cerebral function analyzing monitor, and (3) maximum voltage and frequency recovery was 2.0 +/- 1, 5.9 +/- 4, and 32.4 +/- 8 minutes in the propranolol group, which was significantly (p less than or equal to 0.01) shorter than in the control group (18.4 +/- 3, 38.2 +/- 5, and 111.0 +/- 9 minutes, respectively). These results suggest that pretreatment with propranolol may play an important part in the brain tolerance to deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest.", 
    "4": "We have previously demonstrated that Chinese subjects are more sensitive than white subjects to beta-blockade produced by propranolol. To determine if this difference was because a greater proportion of the total propranolol was the more active (-)-isomer of propranolol in the Chinese subjects than in the white subjects, the relative pharmacokinetics of (+)- and (-)-isomers of propranolol after administration of a single, 80 mg oral dose of racemic propranolol was studied in 10 Chinese male and in 9 white male healthy subjects. The plasma concentrations of both (+)- and (-)-propranolol were lower in Chinese than in white subjects, resulting in significantly lower peak plasma concentrations and areas under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in Chinese subjects, the half-life of elimination did not differ significantly between Chinese and white subjects or between the two isomers. The concentrations of the active (-)-propranolol were higher in both groups of subjects because of the lower clearance of the (-)-propranolol compared with the (+)-propranolol. An excellent correlation between the clearance of (+)- and (-)-propranolol was seen in the same individual. The ratio of AUC of (-)- and (+)-propranolol did not differ between Chinese subjects (0.64 +/- 0.03) and white subjects (0.71 +/- 0.09). The data suggest that the proportion of the two isomers found in Chinese and white subjects did not differ, and therefore differences in stereoselective disposition of propranolol cannot explain the increased sensitivity seen in Chinese individuals.", 
    "5": "Because both quinidine and propranolol bind to the cytochrome P-450 responsible for the oxidation of debrisoquin, six healthy male subjects were studied to determine whether an interaction occurred between the two drugs and the pharmacodynamic consequences of that interaction. The coadministration of quinidine resulted in a doubling of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of (+/-)-propranolol (530 +/- 99 versus 1051 +/- 138 ng.hr/ml; p less than 0.05) and a reduction in the clearance of (+/-)-propranolol from 3087 +/- 648 to 1378 +/- 173 ml/min (p less than 0.05). The metabolism of propranolol by the 4-hydroxylation pathway was almost abolished by quinidine, resulting in a fall in the partial metabolic clearance by this pathway from 678 +/- 246 to 56 +/- 11 ml/min (p less than 0.05). Quinidine differentially affected the metabolism of (+)-propranolol and (-)-propranolol, resulting in an increase of 176.6% +/- 45.5% and 100.4% +/- 25.5% in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of (+)-propranolol and (-)-propranolol, respectively (p less than 0.05). The pharmacokinetic changes were associated with pharmacodynamic effects. The combination of propranolol and quinidine resulted in increased beta-blockade measured by reduction in exercise heart rate and prolongation of the QTc and PR intervals. We conclude that quinidine stereoselectively inhibits the metabolism of propranolol through inhibition of the debrisoquin isozyme. The increased concentration of propranolol produced by quinidine results in increased beta-blockade.", 
    "6": "Three experiments examined the effect of propranolol injected IP on a series of 16 extinction trials at 24-hour intertrial intervals after continuously rewarded running. In Experiment I, propranolol (1, 5 or 10 mg/kg) was injected, in different groups, shortly before or shortly after each extinction trial, but without effect. In Experiment II, the same doses were injected daily for 18 days preceding extinction, to allow longer for any long-term drug effect to accumulate. Propranolol (1 mg/kg) facilitated extinction. In Experiment III, a single dose (7.5 mg/kg) was injected before or after extinction trials as in Experiment I; the acute effect was to impair extinction. These results are consistent with previous findings in the Skinner box that propranolol has an acute disinhibitory effect on nonrewarded responses and a long-term inhibitory one. These effects have different dose-response relationships.", 
    "7": "In human infants and newborn rats, white light at the intensity used to treat hyperbilirubinemia lowers serum calcium concentration. Occipital shielding or (in newborn rats) exogenous melatonin prevents this effect. Propranolol, by inhibiting melatonin synthesis, also causes hypocalcemia, which is preventable by melatonin. Metyrapone or adrenalectomy prevents hypocalcemia after light exposure or propranolol. Exogenous corticosterone lowers serum calcium; this is prevented by supplementary melatonin. In adult rats, the change in calcium after light, propranolol, or corticosterone is minimal. After parathyroidectomy or a diet with a high calcium/low phosphorus ratio, the hypocalcemic effect of these three agents is restored. Bone samples removed after light exposure or corticosterone administration show increased calcium uptake; this is blocked by supplementary melatonin in vivo or by addition of melatonin to the incubation medium. We postulated that the hypocalcemic effect of light or propranolol was due to an acute increase in corticosterone-mediated bone calcium uptake when circulating melatonin was decreased by reduction of the rate of melatonin synthesis. In our study, pinealectomized rats showed no change in serum calcium after light or propranolol; their hypocalcemic response to corticosterone was greater than that of sham-operated controls. Exogenous parathyroid hormone prevented light-induced hypocalcemia in newborn rats.", 
    "8": "The antihypertensive effects of penbutolol, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, was assessed in nonobese black South Africans aged 25 to 65 years with uncomplicated mild to moderate essential hypertension. After a 4-week placebo run-in period 50 patients entered a randomized placebo-controlled study with a crossover design. For 8 weeks they received a once daily dose of 40 mg penbutolol (or placebo) which was increased to 80 mg per day for the next 4 weeks in poor responders. This was followed by a 4-week placebo washout period after which a crossover of treatment was achieved and a second 12-week period of treatment initiated. Thirty-five patients completed the whole study and in 15 patients diastolic blood pressure was reduced below 95 mm Hg. The mean systolic pressures of these patients decreased by 21 mm Hg and their mean diastolic pressure decreased by 11 mm Hg during treatment with penbutolol. These results suggest that penbutolol monotherapy is an alternative therapeutic approach to hypertension in black South Africans.", 
    "9": "The safety and efficacy of labetalol and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were compared in a group of 34 patients aged 65 years or older with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, during which all previous antihypertensive medication was discontinued, patients were randomized to receive either labetalol (100 mg bid) or HCTZ (25 mg bid). The patients' blood pressure and heart rate were evaluated biweekly and drug dosage was titrated (up to 400 mg and 50 mg bid of labetalol and HCTZ, respectively) to achieve a standing diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg. Patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring at the end of the placebo run-in period and again after the 6-week titration period. Both labetalol and HCTZ significantly (P less than .01) reduced standing systolic (-19.4 vs -27.7 mm Hg) and diastolic (-14.0 vs -15.2 mm Hg) blood pressures following 12 weeks of treatment. Both antihypertensives effectively controlled the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, however, the labetalol group experienced a significantly lower rate of rise in diastolic blood pressure (P = .02) and mean arterial pressure (P = .02) during the acceleration period (400-1200) compared to the HCTZ group. HCTZ caused significant decreases in serum potassium (P less than .01) and alkaline phosphatase (P less than .05) and increases in uric acid (P less than .01) and urea nitrogen (P = .07). These results indicate that labetalol may offer some unique advantages over thiazide diuretics that may be particularly important in the treatment of elderly patients with hypertension.", 
    "10": "BTS 49465 (flosequinan), a putative selective, balanced arterial and venous vasodilator, displays positive inotropic effects in doses lower than those producing vasodilation. Thus rather than unloading the myocardium, flosequinan may increase myocardial work and oxygen consumption (MVO2), and may adversely affect the patient with myocardial ischemia or compromised coronary blood flow. This study compared the effects of flosequinan with milrinone, a mixed positive inotropic agent and vasodilator, and with nitroprusside (SNP), a standard direct-acting vasodilator, on myocardial dP/dT, MVO2, and myocardial energetics in the normal pentobartital-anesthetized dog. The effect of flosequinan on myocardial work was also evaluated in the dog with propranolol-induced heart failure (PIHF). Fifteen minutes after intraduodenal (id) administration of flosequinan (0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg) to seven dogs, mean myocardial dP/dT was increased by 11%, 27%, and 54%, respectively, whereas stroke MVO2 was increased by 10%, 24%, and 47%, respectively. Doses of flosequinan greater than 0.3 mg/kg decreased left ventricular (LV) work but LV efficiency decreased in a dose-related manner. Milrinone (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg, id) increased LV dp/dt by 34%, 68%, and 104% above basal values, while increasing stroke MVO2 by 24%, 106%, and 249%, respectively (n = 7). LV work and LV efficiency decreased after each dose of milrinone. SNP (0.001, 0.003, and 0.01 mg/kg/min, intravenously) did not increase dP/dT but decreased LV work by 28%, 42%, and 46% (n = 5). In animals with PIHF, flosequinan (1 and 3 mg/kg, id) increased LV dP/dT 58% and 87% and increased LV work by 58% and 76% above control values. It was concluded that (1) flosequinan is a positive inotropic agent as well as a vasodilator; (2) in the normal animal the energy cost of positive inotropic activity is less with flosequinan than with milrinone, despite the lesser vasodilating action of the former; and (3) in the animal with a depressed myocardium, flosequinan may adversely affect myocardial work and wall tension.", 
    "11": "Twenty children and adolescents treated orally with atenolol for chronic paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia (n = 10) or Long QT Syndrome (n = 10) over a 5 year period were retrospectively evaluated to ascertain the efficacy of arrhythmia suppression, the effective dosage, the cardiovascular effects, and the incidence of adverse effects. Patients with paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia were classified by their response to exercise or catecholamines. Atenolol was effective in each patient (n = 5) whose tachycardia was precipitated or exacerbated by exercise or catecholamines when the patient was receiving a dosage of approximately 1.7 mg/kg/day. In those patients (n = 4) in whom exercise or catecholamines either suppressed or had no effect on the tachycardia, none were effectively treated in spite of receiving comparable dosages. Three of these four patients also had structural abnormalities or myocardial dysfunction. Atenolol was effective in treating 4 of 10 patients with long QT syndrome with a dosage of approximately 1.5 mg/kg/day. Six ineffectively treated patients received similar dosages, and four required either additional medication or surgical sympathectomy for persistent syncope. The other two patients died suddenly. Cardiovascular side effects included bradycardia in three patients and hypotension in one. Noncardiovascular effects included mild fatigue (four patients) headache (two), sleep disturbance (two), and difficulty concentrating (one). The medication was discontinued because of side effects in two patients. Atenolol is more likely to be effective in the suppression of paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia in children if the tachycardia is exacerbated by exercise or catecholamines and if the heart is otherwise normal.", 
    "12": "Sixteen anesthetized New Zealand white rabbits were subjected to thoracotomy, and a reversible snare occluder was attached around a large branch of the left circumflex coronary artery. A 1.3 cm. diameter nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) surface coil was placed adjacent to the myocardium perfused by this vessel. The animals were divided into two groups of eight animals each, treatment and control. The rabbits were studied using a 2.0 T magnetic resonance (MR) spectrometer, and baseline spectra were acquired. The treatment animals then received intravenous propranolol (1.5 mg/kg) and the control animals received an equal volume of saline. Spectra were then acquired during a 20-minute occlusion period and during subsequent reperfusion. Animals in both groups showed expected decreases in phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate and an increase in inorganic phosphate during occlusion; these changes reverted toward baseline values with reperfusion. There were no significant differences between the two groups. The myocardium became acidotic during occlusion in both groups, but significantly more so in the control animals: during the first 10 minutes of occlusion pH was 7.30 +/- 0.41 in the treatment group versus 6.55 +/- 0.24 for controls (p = 0.0005). During the second 10 minutes of occlusion pH was 7.05 +/- 0.65 in the treatment group versus 6.24 +/- 0.25 in controls (p = 0.0053). We conclude that attenuation of intracellular acidosis by propranolol during myocardial ischemia was evident by MR spectroscopy in this animal model.", 
    "13": "In 378 placebo patients enrolled in the European Infarction Study (EIS), a secondary prevention study after acute myocardial infarction, 24-h baseline Holter monitoring was done 14 to 31 days after MI, and the relationship of electrical (ventricular arrhythmias) and mechanical (clinical signs of ventricular dysfunction) risk factors was analysed on the basis of mortality during the subsequent 2 years of follow-up. There was a rather low overall 2-year mortality rate of 6.9%. Consecutive arrhythmias (ventricular pairs and runs of ventricular premature beats) and left-ventricular dysfunction alone were associated with a low mortality of 4.0% and 3.6%, respectively. However, the combination of both defined a high-risk group characterized by a 2-year mortality rate of 16.7%. Additionally, the risk of dying was dependent on the frequency of consecutive arrhythmias: 22.2% of the patients with greater than 10 ventricular pairs per day died during the follow-up period in contrast to 9.9% of those with only 1-10 ventricular pairs per day. Thus, only the combination of electrical and mechanical risk factors, and especially the frequency of consecutive VPB, is helpful in identifying a subgroup of postMI patients with poor clinical outcome. An intervention study should restrict itself to this risk population only.", 
    "14": "Electrophysiological properties were studied in a heterotopic heart transplant model developed in 44 dogs (Group I). Cycle length was 359.5 +/- 55.2 ms in the recipient heart and 500.9 +/- 77.9 ms in the donor heart (P less than 0.001). Sinoatrial conduction time was 38.6 +/- 13.6 ms in the recipient heart and 38.6 +/- 10.4 ms in that of the donor (not significant). The Wenckebach point was 175.4 +/- 31.1 ms in the recipient organ and 214.3 +/- 42.6 ms in the donor heart (P less than 0.001). The retrograde block point was 271.6 +/- 48.0 ms in the recipient heart and 353.6 +/- 47.3 ms in that of the donor (P less than 0.01). The effective antegrade refractory period was 133.4 +/- 28.7 ms in the recipient heart and 167.3 +/- 46.3 ms in the donor organ (P less than 0.001). An epicardial atrial cartography was performed at 44 preset points in both hearts, revealing a normal activation sequence and delays of 36-98 ms (mean 58 ms) in the recipient heart and from 39 to 59 ms (mean 50 ms) in the donor heart (not significant). In another 11 dogs (Group II), the same electrophysiological study was carried out under basal conditions and after pharmacological blockade of the autonomic nervous system with atropine (0.04 mg (kg body weight)-1) and propranolol (0.2 mg (kg body weight)-1). No significant differences were found in any of the parameters studied upon comparison of Group II animals in basal conditions with Group I recipients, and Group II dogs after blockade with Group I donors. These results demonstrate that the differences in automatism, conduction and refractoriness between the donor and recipient hearts are not attributable to differences in the haemodynamic situation or in the anaesthetic technique, but to denervation.", 
    "15": "A patient with a history of corrected Type B dissecting aortic aneurysm and current Type III dissection of the aortic arch was successfully treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) without complications. During ECT, intravenous nitroprusside and esmolol drips with arterial line monitoring were used to control the rise in blood pressure and heart rate. This case provides further evidence that ECT can be administered safely to patients with aortic aneurysm.", 
    "16": "A 31-year-old man being treated for asthma accidently received 3 mg SQ epinephrine. He began retching and vomiting and developed agitation and profuse diaphoresis. He was treated with 5 mg IV labetalol. His symptoms improved significantly, and he required no further treatment. Although he felt a transient increase in his respiratory effort shortly after administration of the drug, he did not develop wheezing or require additional therapy for bronchospasm. The beta-blocking effect of labetalol is greater than the alpha antagonism. The patient exhibited evidence of mild alpha stimulation due to incomplete blockade. This is consistent with previous studies in that labetalol tends to less completely antagonize the alpha effects of a mixed alpha/beta agonist, resulting in a net clinical picture of mild alpha agonism.", 
    "17": "The effect of adding propranolol to procainamide, quinidine, propafenone or disopyramide was prospectively evaluated in 37 patients, all with prior infarction and inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT). After showing that VT remained inducible during therapy with a type I drug, 23 patients received intravenous propranolol. The ventricular effective refractory period, prolonged by the type I agent, was further increased by propranolol. The cycle length of the VT also increased after the type I drug and propranolol exaggerated this effect. Seven of the 23 patients were rendered noninducible after propranolol and another 10 manifested a greater than 100 ms increase in induced VT cycle length. In the other 14 patients, propranolol was infused immediately after the basal study. If VT remained inducible, testing was repeated after a type I drug was added. The ventricular effective refractory period, as well as the VT cycle length, increased after propranolol and was further prolonged after the addition of a type I agent. Seven of these 14 patients were rendered noninducible, 3 with propranolol alone and 4 others with the combination, and in 4, the VT cycle length was prolonged by greater than 100 ms. A total of 17 patients were discharged on either propranolol alone (3 patients) or on an effective combination (14 patients). During a mean follow-up of 20 months, 1 patient died suddenly, 2 had recurrence of well-tolerated VT and 9 remain on therapy. Thus, propranolol has a demonstrable antiarrhythmic effect in the invasive laboratory and may supplement the antiarrhythmic efficacy of conventional type I antiarrhythmic drugs.", 
    "18": "Sotalol is unique among beta-blocking agents having significant Class III antiarrhythmic action. In a series of 22 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and seven patients with atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) resistant to multiple drugs, sotalol was studied by acute electrophysiologic means, as well as by long-term clinical follow-up ranging from 1 to 47 months. Sustained reciprocating tachycardia was rendered noninducible in 13 of 18 patients with WPW and in 5 of 6 with AVNRT. Long-term control of symptomatic tachycardia was achieved in 77% of patients with WPW and in 57% of patients with resistant AVNRT. Side effects were those associated with beta blockade. Two patients developed ventricular irritability associated with excessive QT prolongation.", 
    "19": "Sotalol has a virtually unique antiarrhythmic profile in that it combines the properties of the Class II beta-blocking agents with the Class III properties that prolong repolarization. The Class II action exerts a marked effect on atrioventricular nodal conduction and makes sotalol a suitable drug for the treatment of adrenergic-induced supraventricular tachycardias. Sotalol helps to prevent or slow supraventricular arrhythmias involving the atrioventricular node as part of a reentrant pathway and also helps to control the ventricular rate during supraventricular arrhythmias conducted to the ventricles over the normal atrioventricular pathway. The capacity of conduction of accessory pathways is diminished by sotalol, thereby decreasing the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The effects of sotalol on conduction of the cardiac impulse (Class I effects) have been probably overlooked and those on true refractoriness (Class III effects) overestimated.", 
    "20": "Oral sotalol was given to 64 patients (78% postinfarction) with recurrent, reentrant ventricular tachycardia (VT) during an average follow-up period of 19.7 months. Fifty-nine (92%) patients had previously experienced recurrent ventricular tachycardia, in spite of having received an average of three conventional antiarrhythmic drugs (13 had previously failed on other Class III drugs). The nature and mechanism of the VT was proved with electrophysiologic testing (EPS), and the chronic sotalol dosage was determined by repeated EPS at 3- to 4-day intervals until the VT was no longer inducible. Sotalol failed in five patients and was discontinued in six patients because of severe side effects (three proarrhythmic effects, including two with torsades de pointes)--a total of 18%. Sotalol was successful alone in 42 patients (65%) and in combination with another antiarrhythmic drug in 11 patients (18%). The average dose of sotalol required for success was 589 mg; 658 mg was the mean daily dose when given alone and 486 mg when given in combination. Side effects were common and were due mainly to the beta-blocking effects of sotalol. Dual chamber pacing was required by 11 patients because of poorly tolerated bradycardia, and 14 patients remained symptomatic from worsening of the cardiac failure in spite of pacing, increased diuretics, or vasodilator therapy. The average drug dosage was the same for symptomatic (680 mg) and asymptomatic (627 mg) patients. Sotalol is a valuable antiarrhythmic drug for reentrant ventricular tachycardia. High doses are needed, and at these doses the beta-blocking activity is responsible for most of the side effects.", 
    "21": "In two separate, double-blind, multicenter antiarrhythmic studies, sotalol was compared with propranolol or quinidine using placebo for baseline and/or washout periods. The comparison with quinidine was a crossover study. To be enrolled in these studies, patients were required to have a premature ventricular contraction (PVC) rate of at least 30/hr on a baseline 24-hour ambulatory ECG. At doses calculated to produce equivalent degrees of beta blockade, sotalol was more effective than propranolol in reducing the frequency of PVCs, and the two drugs produced similar reductions in ventricular tachycardia (VT) events. The side effects for sotalol and propranolol were mainly due to beta blockade, and the incidence of side effects with the two drugs was similar. Sotalol was comparable with quinidine in reducing PVCs and VT events. The side effects on sotalol were primarily related to beta-adrenergic blockade, while those on quinidine were predominantly gastrointestinal or neurologic in nature.", 
    "22": "The beginning of thought about a discrete Class III antiarrhythmic action stemmed from the observation that sotalol produced a very marked increase in the time course of repolarization with little or no change in conduction velocity in cardiac muscle. It is known that in patients with hypothyroidism or hypocalcemia, both of which are associated with a marked lengthening of the cardiac action potential, arrhythmias are exceedingly rare. The acetyl metabolite of procainamide also produces, as its sole action, a marked increase in the action-potential duration, and it has antiarrhythmic activity. It is clear that lengthening the action-potential duration is antiarrhythmic. Sotalol is a unique beta blocker in not only antagonizing sympathetic stimulation competitively, but also in exerting a potent antiarrhythmic effect by prolonging repolarization. Because of the augmented tension that is associated with the increase in action-potential duration, sotalol produces a less negative inotropic effect than that seen with other beta blockers. Sotalol is a potent broad-spectrum antiarrhythmic agent because of its Class III properties, resulting from an increase in the length of cardiac repolarization, a property that is modulated by its beta-adrenergic blocking actions.", 
    "23": "UIe effects of propranolol and atenolol on free radical mediated injury in myocytes were examined. Freshly isolated adult canine myocytes were incubated with a superoxide generating (from dihydroxyfumarate) and Fe-catalyzed free radical system. Exposure of the myocytes to free radicals for 20 min resulted in more than a 5-fold increase in thiobarbituric acid reactant (peroxide) formation and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity released into the media compared to controls. Ultrastructurally, severe sarcolemmal damage, mitochondrial and myofibril derangements were evident. At 40 min, cellular viability (trypan blue exclusion) in the samples exposed to free radicals decreased to about one-third of controls; concomitantly, major losses in total cellular phospholipids occurred. When the cells were pretreated with 200 microM propranolol before the addition of free radicals, both peroxide formation and increased LDH release were inhibited; in agreement, complete ultrastructural preservation was observed. In addition, the subsequent losses in cellular viability and phospholipids were prevented. For comparison, the more water soluble beta-blocker, atenolol at 200 microM was shown ineffective in providing significant protection against the induced injury. The results suggest that propranolol may provide antiperoxidative protection to myocytes when elevated levels of free radicals are present.", 
    "24": "The safety and efficacy of a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, nisoldipine, were studied in comparison with propranolol, in patients with stable angina. Following 2 weeks of wash-out of the current therapy and 1 week of placebo, 26 patients underwent two cycloergometer tests, before and 2 hours after placebo administration. Subsequently, 10 mg of nisoldipine twice daily or 40 mg of propranolol three times daily were administered over a 4 week period, in a randomized single-blind fashion. Cycloergometer tests were performed after 2 and 4 weeks, before and two hours after drug administration. Two patients, one out of the nisoldipine group and one out of the propranolol, were considered drop outs. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using two-way variance analysis. With both drugs, time to 1 mm exercise induced ST-segment depression (p less than 0.01), time to angina (p less than 0.01), and exercise tolerance (p less than 0.01) improved furthermore, ST-segment and heart rate recovery time decreased (p less than 0.01). Rate-pressure product values at ischemic threshold and at peak exercise remained unchanged with nisoldipine, while significant reductions were observed with propranolol (p less than 0.01). Maximum ST-segment depression was reduced (p less than 0.01) with both drugs and a further improvement was observed two hours after drug administration (p less than 0.05). At submaximum work-load, rate pressure product values and ST-segment depression were improved with both drugs (p less than 0.01); this improvement was more evident two hours after drug administration. No significant side effects were observed with either drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "Heparin, aspirin with dipyridamol or 5% dextrose were administered to 266 patients admitted to the coronary unit with unstable angina. All patients were concurrently treated with isosorbide dinitrate, a beta-blocker and nifedipine. The number of patients who developed an acute myocardial infarction (IM) during the subsequent 72 hours was comparable in all three groups. However, in the heparin treated group only 3.2% patients developed Q IM, as compared with 20% patients treated with aspirin and dipyridamol (p = 0.005) and with 19% in the control group (p = 0.006). The magnitude of the IM was evaluated according to the highest serum value of creatine phosphokinase. In the heparin treated group its value was 810.5 +/- 538 i.u./l which was significantly less than in the aspirin + dipyridamol group where it was 1229 +/- 829 i.u./l (p = 0.048) and in the control group where it was 1417 +/- 919 i.u./l (p = 0.009). The authors defined the group of patients with a high risk of development of IM who had protracted anginous pain longer than 45 mins. with ST segment depression deeper than 1 mm on the ECG on admission. 55% of these patients developed an infarction in the course of the subsequent 72 hours.", 
    "26": "The effect of enalapril was evaluated in 67 patients with essential hypertension, and its therapeutic efficacy was compared with atenolol in a placebo run-in, single-blind, cross-over trial. Enalapril significantly reduced blood pressure in all grades of essential hypertension. As monotherapy it 'normalized' blood pressure in 88%, 50% and 25% of patients with mild, moderate and severe hypertension respectively. Optimal dose for most of the patients was 20 to 40 mg/day. Comparison with atenolol revealed almost parallel efficacy of the two drugs, although enalapril produced a significantly greater reduction in systolic blood pressure in patients with mild and moderate hypertension (P less than 0.01 in each group). No serious side effects were encountered with either drug. Enalapril, therefore, has a potent and slightly superior antihypertensive effect to that of atenolol, and may be used as a 'first-step' drug in the treatment of hypertensive patients.", 
    "27": "The study was undertaken to examine effects of anapriline on bicycle ergometric and echocardiographic parameters and catecholamine excretion in 17 patients with thyrotoxicosis and 21 healthy subjects. A single dose of anapriline contributed to transition of hyperkinetic central hemodynamics to eukinetic one and a more saving regimen of heart performance at rest and submaximal exercise levels in the healthy subjects. In contrast, the patients maintained hyperkinetic hemodynamics and had a high energy demand during exercise and showed a reduction in left ventricular systolic and diastolic function and a significant decrease in catecholamine excretion. Disintegration of regulatory mechanisms in thyrotoxicosis was found to be due to the function interrelationship between thyroid hormones and catecholamines.", 
    "28": "1. Intravenous infusion of (+/-) isoprenaline (1-100 micrograms kg-1 h-1) enhanced airway responses (resistance, RL; and compliance, Cdyn) to histamine (1.0-1.8 micrograms kg-1) and bombesin (100-240 ng kg-1), whereas airway responses to vagal stimulation remained unchanged. 2. Bilateral vagotomy before intravenous infusion of (+/-)isoprenaline (100 micrograms kg-1 h-1) prevented development of airway hyperreactivity to histamine or bombesin, yet vagotomy after infusion of isoprenaline was without effect. 3. Prior treatment with atropine (1 mg kg-1) did not influence the capacity of (+/-)isoprenaline (100 micrograms kg-1 h-1) to increase airway reactivity to bombesin. 4. Despite a 500-fold difference in spasmolytic potency in vivo, infusion of (+)isoprenaline (100 micrograms kg-1 h-1) or (-)isoprenaline (100 micrograms kg-1 h-1) increased reactivity of the airways to histamine or bombesin to a comparable extent. 5. Neither adrenaline (100 micrograms kg-1 h-1) nor forskolin (600 micrograms kg-1 h-1) increased reactivity of the airways to histamine or bombesin. 6. Intravenous infusion of dopamine (100 micrograms kg-1 h-1) or noradrenaline (100 micrograms kg-1 h-1) increased reactivity of the airways to histamine or bombesin. 7. Intravenous infusion of (+/-) propranolol (100 micrograms kg-1 h-1) increased reactivity of the airways to histamine or bombesin which was partially inhibited by bilateral vagal section. 8. Depletion of circulating platelets by lytic anti-platelet serum or concomitant infusion of an antagonist of platelet-activating factor (PAF), ginkgolide B (1 mg kg-1 h-1) did not diminish the capacity of (+/-)isoprenaline (100 micrograms kg-1 h-1) to induce hyperreactivity of the airways to histamine or bombesin. 9. These observations indicate that (+/-)isoprenaline can induce airway hyper-reactivity by a mechanism unrelated to beta-adrenoceptor activation, but which is dependent upon intact vagus nerves.", 
    "29": "1. In urethane-anaesthetized dogs, an intra-arterial infusion of capsaicin (0.7-14 nmol min-1) into a separated jejunal segment inhibited a vagally evoked cholinergic contraction of the other non-infused segments. The mechanism of this reflex was investigated. 2. The inhibition by capsaicin was abolished after bilateral splanchnic nerve section or cervical spinal cord transection (C5 or C6), but was unaffected by bilateral vagotomy. Decerebration partially reduced the inhibition. 3. The inhibition by capsaicin was abolished by pre-treatment with phentolamine or yohimbine, but was unaffected by prazosin or propranolol. 4. Sympathetic efferent discharge of the mesenteric nerve increased with capsaicin application, during which time vagally evoked contractions were inhibited. 5. Single-unit discharges of the major splanchnic and mesenteric afferents increased with capsaicin infusion to the loop which was innervated by the units. 6. Together the results implied that capsaicin stimulated canine intestinal primary afferents, resulting in the sympathetic intestinointestinal inhibitory reflex supraspinally. The inhibition of vagally evoked contractions may be due to a presynaptic inhibition via alpha 2-adrenoceptors, which are activated by the reflex.", 
    "30": "Careful consideration of all relevant scientific evidence and a critical assessment of data quality show that thiazide diuretics are not cardiotoxic. Of 12 reported trials only two recorded more coronary heart disease events in thiazide-treated patients than in controls. One of these two was a subgroup of a larger study (Heart Attack Prevention in Primary Hypertension, HAPPHY) which found no difference between thiazide-treated and beta-blocker-treated patients. The other, the Oslo study, was too small to allow valid conclusions. Results from a subgroup in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) that appeared to supply evidence for thiazide-related cardiotoxicity are suspect when examined critically. Further evidence from 24- to 28-h ECG monitoring does not support the hypothesis that thiazide diuretics, either in the presence or absence of hypokalemia, increase the frequency or severity of ventricular arrhythmias. Reports of a thiazide-induced intracellular magnesium deficiency as a cause of ventricular arrhythmias have also not been confirmed; the development of arrhythmias in acute myocardial infarction appears to be due to an increase in catecholamine levels rather than hypokalemia. There appears to be little evidence to support the assumption that long-term use of thiazide diuretics aggravates or accelerates atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries; any fall in serum cholesterol appears to be transient. For the great majority of patients with uncomplicated hypertension, without a previous myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus or gout, thiazide diuretics appear to be both safe and effective antihypertensive agents.", 
    "31": "The 12 h IOP control achieved by a single application of a newly developed ophthalmic solution containing 0.5% timolol and 2% resp. 4% pilocarpine was compared with that obtained by 1 dose of timolol 0.5% alone in 33 patients with manifest open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The combined solutions gave a significantly better 12 h IOP control, evidenced by both a reduced mean diurnal IOP and a decreased frequency of larger pressure peaks.", 
    "32": "1. In this double-blind randomized study, after a 4-weeks placebo period, 18 patients with mild to moderate primary hypertension were assigned to treatment with either dilevalol (n = 9) daily or atenolol (n = 9) over a period of 3 months. 2. Expiratory flows, lung volumes and airway responsiveness (AR) to methacholine were assessed at the end of the placebo period and after an active treatment of 12 weeks. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and ECG were monitored during the methacholine challenges. Twice daily peak expiratory flow rates and respiratory symptoms were recorded on a diary card. 3. No significant effects on ECG, HR and BP were observed after methacholine inhalation. In all but one subjects there was no significant change in expiratory flows, lung volumes or AR throughout the study. Mean FEV1, FVC, PEFR, FRC and PC20 methacholine were unchanged after 3 months of treatment, and not statistically different between patients on dilevalol or atenolol. 4. One subject, without previous history of asthma, developed transient airflow obstruction 8 weeks after beginning dilevalol. 5. Dilevalol and atenolol have no significant effects on pulmonary function and AR in most subjects with no baseline airflow limitation. 6. Airflow obstruction may develop in normal subjects on dilevalol. Methacholine challenges are safe in subjects with uncomplicated hypertension.", 
    "33": "The present study was performed to see if the combined treatment with propranolol and dilazep offers any advantage over monotherapy with propranolol alone in angina of effort. Thirty-four patients out of 40 with classical stable angina of effort completed this double-blind, randomized, parallel design comparative clinical trial. Both propranolol alone (20-80 mg) and in combination with dilazep (50 mg) three times a day produced a significant reduction in anginal attacks, consumption of nitroglycerin tablets and increased exercise tolerance. Propranolol in combination with dilazep produced more reduction in these parameters as compared to when it was given alone. However, this difference was not significant. The combination of the two drugs produced a significant reduction in supine systolic blood pressure and in rate-pressure product. Laboratory data did not reveal any dysfunction of liver, kidneys and hemopoietic system. The results obtained support the anticipated additional benefit from combined therapy with propranolol and dilazep in terms of some increase in efficacy.", 
    "34": "The contribution of Ca2(+)-activated and delayed rectifying K+ channels to the voltage-dependent outward current involved in spike repolarization in mouse pancreatic beta-cells (Rorsman, P., and G. Trube. 1986. J. Physiol. 374:531-550) was assessed using patch-clamp techniques. A Ca2(+)-dependent component could be identified by its rapid inactivation and sensitivity to the Ca2+ channel blocker Cd2+. This current showed the same voltage dependence as the voltage-activated (Cd2(+)-sensitive) Ca2+ current and contributed 10-20% to the total beta-cell delayed outward current. The single-channel events underlying the Ca2(+)-activated component were investigated in cell-attached patches. Increase of [Ca2+]i invariably induced a dramatic increase in the open state probability of a Ca2(+)-activated K+ channel. This channel had a single-channel conductance of 70 pS [( K+]o = 5.6 mM). The Ca2(+)-independent outward current (constituting greater than 80% of the total) reflected the activation of an 8 pS [( K+]o = 5.6 mM; [K+]i = 155 mM) K+ channel. This channel was the only type observed to be associated with action potentials in cell-attached patches. It is suggested that in mouse beta-cells spike repolarization results mainly from the opening of the 8-pS delayed rectifying K+ channel.", 
    "35": "Eighteen male patients (aged 40-66 years) with confirmed ischaemic heart disease and a minimum of four angina attacks per week were included in a double-blind comparison of dilevalol 200 mg, dilevalol 400 mg and atenolol 100 mg. Following a one-week placebo run-in period patients were randomly allocated to one of the three treatments, after which they crossed to the remaining two treatments according to a balanced Latin square design. Each treatment was given once-daily over four weeks. Symptom-limited treadmill exercise testing using a modified Bruce protocol was performed at the end of placebo, and after each treatment around 24 hours post-dosing. The mean exercise time on placebo was 7.0 (+/- 0.91) minutes which changed to 7.8 (+/- 0.93) minutes on dilevalol 200 mg, 7.3 (+/- 0.88) minutes on dilevalol 400 mg and 8.2 minutes (+/- 1.06) on atenolol 100 mg. Nine patients had a greater exercise tolerance on dilevalol (200 or 400 mg), and nine a greater exercise tolerance on atenolol. Maximum exercise heart rate on placebo was 113 (+/- 5.0) beats per minute (bpm) which was reduced to 101 (+/- 3.6), 96 (+/- 2.7) and 98 (+/- 4.9) bpm. on dilevalol 200 mg, dilevalol 400 mg and atenolol 100 mg, respectively. Correspondingly, the rate-pressure product was reduced from 18.1 (x 10(3)) units on placebo to 14.8, 13.4 and 14.4 (x 10(3)) units on each treatment. Pairwise comparisons by the least square mean procedure showed no significant differences between treatments for any of the measured parameters. All treatments caused a reduction in both angina attack rates and trinitrate consumption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "Dilevalol, 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg, and placebo were given to eight normal volunteers and the effect on blood pressure and heart rate studied at rest and on exercise. There was a dose-dependent fall in exercising heart rate and in the increased heart rate on exercise with dilevalol, while exercising systolic blood pressure and the rise in systolic blood pressure on exercise fell dose-dependently up to 200 mg, but the effect of 400 mg was similar. Diastolic blood pressure was not affected. Supine heart rate and blood pressure changes were not different from placebo. Tilt heart rate fell most constantly from 200 mg. Some fall in tilt systolic blood pressure was seen but this was not dose-dependent, diastolic blood pressure was not affected. There was wide variation in plasma concentration of dilevalol, as might be expected from a liver metabolised drug, with a relatively larger amount absorbed of the 400 mg dose compared to the 100 or 200 mg doses.", 
    "37": "The present single-blind, randomised, cross-over, placebo-controlled study was set up to compare the first-dose effects upon blood pressure (BP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF, measured by Xenon inhalation) of a single oral dose of atenolol 50 mg and enalapril 5 mg in ten hypertensive patients receiving a thiazide diuretic. It was found that a) the timing and degree of fall in BP after the first dose of atenolol and enalapril on a diuretic background were similar and generally not associated with symptoms or a fall in CBF, and b) dizziness, which is sometimes associated with the first-dose effect of ACE inhibitors in hypertensives on diuretics, can occasionally occur accompanied by a substantial fall (43%) in CBF in the absence of marked falls in systolic blood pressure. It is suggested that the latter event may be linked to a disturbance of cerebral autoregulation in part dependent on localised renin-angiotensin systems.", 
    "38": "This randomized, double-blind parallel study compared the effects of atenolol, captopril, enalapril and propranolol in 360 men with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Patients were titrated until diastolic blood pressure (Korotkoff phase V) decreased by at least 10 mmHg or to 90 mmHg or less. Quality of life assessments, based on validated psychometric questionnaires and objective measurements of cognitive function, occurred after three study phases: placebo run-in (3-5 weeks), titration (1-4 weeks), and maintenance (4 weeks). After four weeks of maintenance therapy, atenolol, captopril and enalapril generally had equivalent effects on quality of life, as measured by psychometric questionnaires, whereas propranolol consistently evidenced worsening or less improvement. Global scores of distressing psychological symptoms differed as a function of specific treatment (P = 0.01), with improvements significantly better for the atenolol, captopril and enalapril groups as compared with the propranolol group. There were no statistically significant differences among treatments for changes in cognitive function at maintenance. Thus, the quality of life questionnaires differentiated among drugs of the same class, indicating that selection among antihypertensive drugs should be based on their specific qualities, not on general class characteristics.", 
    "39": "The cardiorenal actions of endothelin-1 (ET-1) were evaluated in rats following nephrectomy, in rats during alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine, and in rats during beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. Female rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital and, following surgery, were allowed 60 min to stabilize before 3 x 20 min-control clearances were collected. ET-1 was then infused at a rate of 100 ng kg-1 min-1 for 30 min, the infusion was stopped, and three additional clearances were collected. Four groups of rats were studied: in Group 1 (n = 10), ET-1 was infused; in Group 2 (n = 5), a bilateral nephrectomy was performed 120 min before infusing ET-1; in Group 3 (n = 5), ET-1 was infused into rats treated with phentolamine (0.015 mg kg-1 min-1); and in Group 4 (n = 5), ET-1 was infused into rats treated with propranolol (0.015 mg kg-1 min-1). At 30 min during infusion of ET-1 into Group 1 rats, mean arterial blood pressure had increased (P less than 0.01) by 27 +/- 2% (SE) and the glomerular filtration rate had decreased (P less than 0.01) by 71 +/- 6% of baseline values. Nephrectomy potentiated and prolonged the ET-1-induced systemic vasoconstriction. Phentolamine had no effect on the cardiorenal actions of ET-1 whereas propranolol enhanced ET-1-induced changes in mean arterial blood pressure; mean arterial blood pressure increased 38 +/- 2% at 30 min during ET-1 + propranolol infusion (P less than 0.01 versus value with ET-1 alone). These data indicate that the kidney affects ET-1-induced systemic vasoconstriction and that beta-adrenergic (but not alpha-adrenergic) receptors are activated during infusion of ET-1 with a resultant attenuation of ET-1-induced changes in systemic blood pressure.", 
    "40": "The effects of antihypertensive therapy on the atherosclerotic process and differences among various treatment approaches have been studied in several animal models. Studies in cholesterol-fed rabbits have indicated that beta blockers and calcium antagonists can inhibit the development of aortic atherosclerosis induced by marked hypercholesterolemia. However, no such antiatherosclerotic action has been apparent with these agents in the Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit. A study was conducted to determine the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril administered orally for 9 months on the development of atherosclerosis in normotensive WHHL. Compared with controls, the treated animals had a significant reduction in atherosclerosis of the descending thoracic aorta. These effects were associated with significantly lower blood pressure, though within the normal range, in captopril-treated versus control animals. In the captopril group, the atherosclerotic plaques were thinner and less cellular than plaques of similar gross severity in control WHHL. The findings indicate that the ACE inhibitor captopril can inhibit atherogenesis in the WHHL, which has been resistant to such therapy with other antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "41": "Beta blockers represent the only documented effective long-term prophylactic treatment for patients after myocardial infarction (MI). Concern continues to be expressed about the lipid-altering effects of their long-term use, especially beta blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity such as propranolol. Data collected for the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, the largest long-term clinical trial of beta-blocker use in patients after MI, have been analyzed to address the following questions. To what extent does propranolol alter lipid levels at least 6 months after MI and initiation of therapy? How predictive of subsequent coronary events and mortality are lipid levels 6 months after MI? Is there any evidence that altered lipid levels attenuate any of the beneficial effect of propranolol on coronary morbidity and mortality? By the 6-month post-MI visit, propranolol was shown to raise serum triglyceride levels by about 17% (approximately equal to 35 mg/dl) and lower serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by about 6% (approximately equal to 3 mg/dl). There was no effect on total cholesterol or low density lipoprotein cholesterol. In other analyses, no lipid measured 6 months after the MI was strongly predictive of subsequent coronary events or mortality. For example, every 1-mg-lower HDL value was associated with only a 0.7% relative increase in the mortality rate. Theoretically, the estimated relative increase on all-cause mortality associated with propranolol-induced HDL reduction is about 2%. In multivariate analyses adjusting for changes in HDL and serum triglyceride, propranolol-induced beneficial reductions in mortality and morbidity remained on the order of 20%, 10 times the estimated hazard.", 
    "42": "1. Beta-adrenoceptor linked regulation of plasma active and inactive renin was investigated in sheep with indwelling artery, vein and bladder catheters. Concurrent changes in renal function were also monitored. 2. The beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline (bolus intravenous (i.v.) dose 0.5 mg/kg, 0.05 microgram/kg per min) increased plasma active renin concentration within 15 min and reached a plateau increase of 306%. Initially plasma inactive renin remained unchanged but after 105 min it decreased. 3. The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (bolus i.v. dose 4 mg/kg, 40 micrograms/kg per min) did not significantly alter basal plasma active renin but selectively reduced inactive renin. The absence of any change in active renin may reflect the relatively low level of stress-induced sympathetic activation in these conscious animals compared to equivalent studies carried out on human subjects. 4. Using the same dose schedules, propranolol completely blocked the isoprenaline-induced increases in plasma active renin secretion even though it had no effect on the basal active renin levels. 5. The selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (bolus i.v. dose 5 mg/kg) decreased basal plasma active renin by 24% (+ 135 min) but reduced plasma inactive renin by 75% compared to control. 6. Therefore, both a beta-adrenoceptor agonist (isoprenaline) and two beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (propranolol and atenolol) decreased plasma inactive renin concentration in conscious sheep. 7. These results are discussed in relation to the accompanying changes in arterial blood pressure and aspects of renal function.", 
    "43": "1. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity (ACEA) and plasma renin activity (PRA) were determined in rats under different experimental conditions such as: nephrotic syndrome (NS), bilateral nephrectomy (BN), renovascular hypertension (RH), dehydration (DEH), anaesthesia (AN), low sodium diet (LSD) and high sodium diet (HSD), and injection with propranolol (PRO) and isoprenaline (ISO). 2. PRA increased in LSD, AN, NS, RH, DEH and IPT groups, and decreased in HSD, BN, and PRO groups. Serum ACEA did not change in RH, HSD, IPT, DEH, AN, and PRO groups, increased in NS group, and decreased in LSD and BN groups. 3. Serum ACEA changed in the opposite direction to PRA only in the LSD group. This finding suggests that ACE may limit the full expression of the renin-angiotensin system in the LSD group, but not in the other groups.", 
    "44": "In the pineal gland numbers of synaptic ribbons (SR) undergo day/night changes which parallel the rhythm of melatonin synthesis. Since pineal biosynthetic activity is controlled by activation of adrenoreceptors, we investigated the effects of adrenergic agonists and antagonists on pineal synaptic ribbon numbers and N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity, the key enzyme of melatonin synthesis in rats. In vivo application of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol decreased melatonin synthesis when given during the dark phase but did not affect SR numbers. Treatment during daytime with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol increased pineal NAT activity whereas SR numbers did not change. Norepinephrine stimulated NAT activity in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, but did not elevate SR numbers. Incubation with an analog of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate increased both NAT activity and SR numbers. These results suggest that the beta-adrenergic system does not play a decisive role in the regulation of the nocturnal increase in SR numbers observed in the rat pineal gland.", 
    "45": "The properties of the autonomically regulated chloride current (ICl) were studied in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes. This current was elicited upon exposure to isoproterenol (ISO) and reversed upon concurrent exposure to acetylcholine (ACh). ICl was time independent and exhibited outward rectification. The responses to ISO and ACh could be blocked by propranolol and atropine, respectively, and ICl was also elicited by forskolin, 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, and 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine, indicating that the current is regulated through a cAMP-dependent pathway. The reversal potential of the ISO-induced current followed the predicted chloride equilibrium potential, consistent with it being carried predominantly by Cl-. Activation of ICl produced changes in the resting membrane potential and action potential duration, which were Cl- gradient dependent. These results indicate that under physiological conditions ICl may play an important role in regulating action potential duration and resting membrane potential in mammalian cardiac myocytes.", 
    "46": "Several recent reports have shown that the hepatic uptake and subsequent elimination of some substrates is faster in the presence of albumin than in its absence, as if some of the substrate bound to albumin was also available for uptake. In the present study, we examined the effect of albumin on the clearance of propranolol by isolated rat hepatocyte suspensions. The clearance of total drug decreased progressively as albumin concentration increased. There was also a progressive decrease in the free fraction of propranolol and the net result was an increase in the clearance of unbound drug (+50% at 40 g/L albumin). This increase was not due to an oncotic pressure effect of albumin, nor to the presence of fatty acids bound to albumin. The clearance of propranolol by isolated hepatocytes from cirrhotic rats was decreased compared with controls (-50%), and albumin also increased propranolol free clearance, albeit to a lesser extent than in control animals. Our results indicate that albumin facilitates the elimination of propranolol by hepatocytes, possibly because of surface-mediated catalysis of the albumin-propranolol complexes.", 
    "47": "We examined the effect of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine and the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine on the attenuation of cardiac vagal action seen following stimulation of the cardiac sympathetic nerve. In the presence of phentolamine both the maximum percentage of inhibition of cardiac vagal action and the half-time to recovery were significantly increased. In the presence of clonidine both the maximum percentage of inhibition of vagal action and the half-time to recovery were significantly reduced. The results demonstrate that the inhibition of cardiac vagal action seen following sympathetic stimulation--an effect which is attributed to actions of the co-transmitter neuropeptide Y released during sympathetic stimulation--can be modulated by drugs acting on alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "48": "P1,P4-Di(adenosine-51) tetraphosphate (AP4A) is a metabolically inactive nucleotide which can be released from platelet dense granules. This study was designed firstly, to investigate whether platelet content of AP4A was decreased in patients with classical migraine and secondly, whether the content of AP4A was changed by beta-adrenoceptor blockade. No significant difference in platelet dense granule content of AP4A, was observed between 10 migraine patients and 10 normal controls. Both metoprolol, a beta 1-selective blocker and propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker significantly decreased the migraine attack rate. However, while propranolol significantly reduced the platelet content of AP4A, metoprolol did not. Therefore, the present data suggest that platelet dense granule release, as estimated by the content of AP4A is not of major importance in migraine.", 
    "49": "To characterize the actions of heparin and its common preservative benzyl alcohol (BA) on airway smooth muscle functions, we studied the effects of purified heparin, commercial heparin salt solution (HSS) containing heparin and BA, and BA on the contractile responses of canine bronchial segments to various agonists under isometric conditions in vitro. Addition of HSS or the equivalent volume of BA reversibly depressed acetylcholine-induced contraction in a dose-dependent fashion, IC50 values being 5.7 +/- 1.1 (SE) mM of BA, whereas purified heparin had no effect. This depression was not affected by pretreatment of tissues with propranolol, indomethacin or ouabain, or removal of epithelium, and BA at sufficient concentrations to cause muscle relaxation did not alter intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate contents. BA also attenuated the contractile responses to electrical field stimulation, histamine, and serotonin, but it was without effect on those to KCl. In addition, the acetylcholine-induced enhancement of hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate in the lipid fraction and the resultant production of phosphatidic acid were inhibited in the presence of BA. These results suggest that the heparin preservative BA but not heparin relaxes airway smooth muscle, probably through the decrease in intracellular Ca2+ release by inhibiting agonist-mediated phosphatidylinositol turnover.", 
    "50": "Beta-Adrenergic blockade with propranolol (PRP) has been reported to cause an increase in plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels in humans, which suggests that a reflex increase in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) vasoconstrictor tone compensates for the hypotensive effect of beta-adrenergic blockade. However, plasma NE levels are an indirect measure of SNS activity. We have developed a two-compartment model of NE kinetics to estimate NE release into an extravascular compartment as a more comprehensive measure of systemic SNS activity. To determine whether beta-adrenergic blockade alters extravascular NE release, we studied nine healthy subjects during sequential infusions of saline and PRP. During PRP infusion, there was an increase in plasma NE levels [1.03 +/- 0.13 to 1.27 +/- 0.21 (SE) nM; P = 0.05], but the extravascular NE release rate decreased significantly (15.5 +/- 1.6 to 9.2 +/- 1.2 nmol.min-1.m-2, P = 0.0002). The plasma NE concentration increased despite the fall in extravascular NE release rate primarily because the clearance of NE from plasma declined (1.55 +/- 0.08 to 1.18 +/- 0.07 l.min-1.m-2, P = 0.0001); the NE spillover rate into plasma did not change (1.73 +/- 0.18 to 1.75 +/- 0.23 nmol.min-1.m-2, P = 0.89). We conclude that PRP decreases extravascular NE release in humans. Suppression of SNS activity may be an additional mechanism of action of nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonists in humans.", 
    "51": "With use of direct brachial artery infusion and measurement of forearm blood flow and vascular resistance by strain gauge plethysmography, the effect of verapamil on phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction was determined. Seven healthy men (age range, 19 to 47 years; weight range, 68 to 108 kg; mean blood pressure, 74 to 100 mm Hg; five nonsmokers) were systemically beta-blocked with intravenous administrations of 10 mg propranolol. Each subject then received ascending doses of phenylephrine (0.191 to 7.6 micrograms/min) alone and with concurrent verapamil (19.1 micrograms/min) by brachial arterial infusion. Dose-ratio during verapamil infusion compared with control was 8.1 (p less than 0.05). No change in slope of the phenylephrine dose-response curve was noted; however, consistent with the dose ratio, verapamil shifted the curve to the right with a decrease in the y intercept determined by linear regression (60.0 versus 40.3 mm Hg ml/100 ml forearm volume/min; p less than 0.05). Verapamil-induced attenuation of forearm vasoconstriction elicited by phenylephrine indicates that, in humans, in vivo verapamil forearm vasodilating effects are, in part, a result of alpha 1-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "52": "Propafenone is a class 1c antiarrhythmic agent with moderate beta-blocking activity as a result of a structural similarity to beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. In a randomized, double-blind crossover exercise study, eight healthy volunteers were examined before and 2 1/2 hours after oral administration of 300 mg (R,S)-, 150 mg (R)-, and 150 mg (S)-propafenone hydrochloride. The mean rate pressure product was significantly reduced by (R,S)-propafenone hydrochloride (-5.2%; p = 0.045) and half-dosed (S)-propafenone hydrochloride (-5.9%; p = 0.013), whereas the (R)-enantiomer caused no significant changes. There was a significant difference between the effects of (R)- and (S)-propafenone (p = 0.033). In beta-adrenoceptor-binding inhibition experiments with (S)-(125I)iodocyanopindolol in a sarcolemma-enriched cardiac membrane preparation, the eudismic ratio of (S)- over (R)-propafenone was 54. On the spontaneously beating Langendorff-perfused guinea pig heart, 3 x 10(-6) mol/L of both (R)- and (S)-propafenone resulted in significant changes (p less than 0.01) on His bundle conduction (+79% +/- 27% and +69% +/- 9%), as well as comparable decreases in the maximal rate of pacing with 1:1 conduction of the atrial (-54% +/- 10% and -57% +/- 8%) and ventricular myocardium (-42% +/- 6% and -43% +/- 6%), indicating equal effects in sodium channel-dependent antiarrhythmic class 1 activity. Thus (R)- and (S)-propafenone exert different beta-blocking actions but equal effects on the sodium channel-dependent antiarrhythmic class 1 activity. More specific antiarrhythmic class 1 therapy with reduction of beta-blocking side effects may be attained with optically pure (R)-propafenone hydrochloride instead of the currently used racemic mixture.", 
    "53": "Autoantibodies against the cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptor are present in the sera of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and may modulate the responsiveness of cardiac beta-adrenergic pathways to agonists. The regulation of cardiac adenylate cyclase activity by autoantibodies was examined in 50 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Inhibition of isoproterenol-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity could be demonstrated by serum dilutions or IgG in 52% (26 of 50) of the patients; basal and NaF-stimulated activities, in contrast, were unaffected. In 14 patients, both ligand binding to beta-receptor and isoproterenol-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity were inhibited by 100-fold serum dilutions. Pretreatment of cardiac membranes with pertussis toxin did not affect inhibition of adenylate cyclase indicating that the effect of sera does not depend on Gi. The immunogenetic control of antireceptor antibodies was examined by comparing the distribution of HLA antigens in antibody-positive and antibody-negative patients. HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR1 were strongly associated with antibodies inhibiting ligand binding and adenylate cyclase activity (71% of patients with such antibodies typed as either DR4 or DR1). Conversely 58% of patients with HLA-DR4 and 71% of patients with HLA-DR1 antibodies showed inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity compared to 46% of those who lacked both HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR1 antibodies. These results strongly suggest that cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase activity in dilated cardiomyopathy can be modulated by circulating autoantibodies, the presence of which is under the control of the major histocompatibility complex.", 
    "54": "We have studied the binding characteristics and functional effects of beta-adrenoceptors on human and guinea pig eosinophils. We determined the binding of the beta-antagonist radioligand [125I]pindolol (IPIN) to intact eosinophils obtained from the peritoneal cavity of guinea pigs and from blood of patients with eosinophilia. Specific binding was saturable, and Scatchard analysis showed a single binding site with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 24.6 pM and maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) of 7,166 per cell. ICI 118,551, a beta 2-selective antagonist, inhibited IPIN binding with a Ki value of 0.28 nM and was approximately 5,000-fold more effective than the beta 1-selective antagonist, atenolol. Isoproterenol increased cAMP levels about 5.5-fold above basal levels (EC50 = 25 microM); albuterol, a beta 2-agonist, behaved as a partial agonist with a maximal stimulation of 80%. Binding to human eosinophils gave similar results with a Kd of 25.3 pM and a Bmax corresponding to 4,333 sites per cell. Incubation of both human and guinea pig eosinophils with opsonized zymosan (2 mg/ml) or with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (10(-8) and 10(-6) M) resulted in superoxide anion generation and the release of eosinophil peroxidase; albuterol (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) had no inhibitory effect on the release of these products. Thus, eosinophils from patients with eosinophilia and from the peritoneal cavity of guinea pigs possess beta-receptors of the beta 2-subtype that are coupled to adenylate cyclase; however, these receptors do not modulate oxidative metabolism or degranulation. The possible therapeutic consequences of these observations to asthma are discussed.", 
    "55": "Celiprolol, a new highly cardioselective beta blocker, also has direct vasodilating properties. Since the noninvasive echo Doppler technique applied to the forearm circulation (brachial artery) allows the differentiation of arteriolar vasodilation (revealed by the increasing arterial blood flow velocity) from vasodilation of large arteries (shown by an increase in arterial diameter), it seems important to study the site of celiprolol's vasodilating effect. Thirty-five hypertensive patients, (21 male, 14 female; mean age, 59 +/- 11, range 42-79 years) were treated with increasing doses of celiprolol, 200 and 400 mg, over 15 days. The duplex echo Doppler technique (Aloka 7.5 M Hz probe) was used before and during each celiprolol dose period. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's paired t test. It was observed that celiprolol significantly increases the brachial artery diameter in a dose-dependent manner, and also increases the blood flow velocity (not being direct dose-related). Since the increase in diameter was clear with a higher dose, a dose-dependent increase in blood volume, a decrease in peripheral resistance, and an increase in compliance followed. Since the higher dose of celiprolol did not further reduce blood pressure (BP) in comparison to the lower dose, and a dose-dependent increase in arterial diameter and compliance occurred and a vasodilating effect of celiprolol on arterial wall ensued that was not related to BP. In conclusion, in the doses used, celiprolol dilates both arterioles and large arteries, but the mechanism of action needs to be clarified.", 
    "56": "The effects of bopindolol, a new nonselective beta-blocking agent, on platelet function have been studied in 10 male hypertensive patients given the drug (1 mg/day) in turn for eight weeks. Bopindolol significantly (p less than 0.01) decreased the bicycle exercise- (1.5 W/kg body weight for 6 minutes) induced increase in platelet aggregation. During bopindolol-treatment both the slope and the height of the platelet aggregation response curve were moderately decreased at rest before exercise and significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased at rest after exercise. During exercise the slope amounted to 75.4 +/- 44 degrees before and to 70.8 +/- 5.3 degrees after therapy (p less than 0.01), the height to 64.0 +/- 11.9% before and to 58.1 +/- 14.7% (p less than 0.05) after therapy. Furthermore, bopindolol significantly increased the exercise-induced decrease in platelet sensitivity to PGI2 (p less than 0.05; IC-50-value: 2.10 +/- 0.47 vs 1.88 +/- 0.31 ng/ml) and PGD2 (p less than 0.05; IC-50-value: (19.88 +/- 2.10 vs 18.57 +/- 1.63 ng/ml). Bopindolol also significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased the exercise-induced elevation in serum-TXB2 (244.9 +/- 35.2 vs 237.3 +/- 27.2 ng/ml) and plasma-TXB2 (15.7 +/- 6.3 vs 13.1 +/- 3.7 pg/ml). The platelet count, the plasma levels of 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha, beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) and platelet factor 4 (PF4) were not affected by bopindolol. It is concluded that bopindolol favourably affects platelet function, in that it lowers exercise-induced platelet aggregation and TXB2-formation in therapeutical doses and increases platelet sensitivity to antiaggregatory prostaglandins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "57": "The 5-HT1A receptor antagonistic properties of 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimmido)butyl] piperazine (NAN-190) were studied in rats: its effect on the 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT)-induced behavioural syndrome (flat body posture and reciprocal forepaw treading), hypothermia and secretion of corticosterone, i.e. responses mediated by 5-HT1A receptors, were examined. The drug NAN-190 (1-8 mg/kg) antagonized dose-dependently behavioural effects of 8-OH-DPAT (in both non-reserpinized and reserpine-pretreated animals); however, when administered in doses of 0.5-4 mg/kg, it did not affect the hypothermic or the hormonal response to 8-OH-DPAT. However, NAN-190 (1-8 mg/kg) given alone, produced hypothermia and increased the concentration of corticosterone in serum. The latter effects of NAN-190 were not reduced by (-)pindolol or spiperone. Moreover, the NAN-190-induced secretion of corticosterone was not affected by ketanserin, prazosin or yohimbine. The above results indicate that NAN-190 acts as a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, only in the model of the 8-OH-DPAT-induced behavioural syndrome. The lack of effect of NAN-190 on the hypothermic or corticosterone response to 8-OH-DPAT most probably results from its own action which mimics the effects of 8-OH-DPAT. The mechanisms responsible for the NAN-190-induced hypothermia and secretion of corticosterone are still unknown, though stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors (either effect), 5-HT2 receptors and alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors (corticosterone response) seems to be excluded.", 
    "58": "The efficacy, tolerability and safety of dilevalol in essential hypertension has been documented in an international clinical trials programme which was conducted with doses up to 1600mg daily. Initial double-blind trials confirmed the superiority of dilevalol over placebo in essential hypertensive patients and documented the suitability of a once-daily dosage. Almost all of the subsequent trials have been randomised, double-blind comparative trials of dilevalol versus established anti-hypertensive agents with the duration of treatment ranging from four weeks up to one year. The recommended dosage range of dilevalol, of 200-400 mg once-daily, has generally been shown to be at least as effective at lowering raised blood pressure as established antihypertensive agents given according to their recommended doses. In one study in elderly hypertensives, dilevalol was significantly more effective than atenolol in lowering systolic blood pressure. Safety data is available from a consolidated database of 2011 dilevalol-treated patients representing over 500 patient-years exposure. Overall, dilevalol was well tolerated and evidence of dose-related adverse effects became apparent only for nausea and dizziness above the recommended dose range. The most common adverse effects considered probably or definitely related to treatment were fatigue (2.5%), nausea (1.9%), headache (1.8%) and dizziness (1.7%). 'Typical' beta-blocker adverse effects were observed, though many of these effects were less frequent than seen with comparator beta-blockers. Evidence of excessive vasodilation was rarely found, consistent with the counter-balancing effect of beta-blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "We evaluated bronchial responsiveness to inhaled albuterol (salbutamol), ipratropium bromide, methacholine, and propranolol in eight heart-lung transplant (HLT) recipients 2.3 +/- 1.5 months (mean +/- SD) (range, 1 to 4.5 months) after HLT. All patients had a restrictive ventilatory defect but none had airflow limitation (FEV1/FVC = 0.93 +/- 0.05) (range, 0.86 to 0.97). Specific airway conductance (sGaw) improved significantly with both albuterol (p less than 0.01) and ipratropium bromide (p less than 0.01) but FEV1 did not. Only one HLT patient had bronchoconstriction with propranolol, whereas all but one were hyperresponsive to methacholine. Prior inhalation of ipratropium bromide blocked the response to methacholine (p less than 0.005). Serial methacholine provocation tests performed in seven long-term survivors of HLT 24.6 +/- 16.0 months (range, 12 to 51 months) after HLT revealed no time-dependent evolution of bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. Limited maximal airway narrowing to methacholine was seen in five HLT recipients who showed a 29 +/- 4 percent (range, 23 to 35 percent) fall in FEV1 compared with two patients who did not achieve a plateau with a 47 percent and 63 percent fall in FEV1, respectively. These results further our understanding of bronchial responsiveness in the denervated transplanted lung. The findings of stable hyperresponsiveness to methacholine over a prolonged time interval, limited maximal airway narrowing to methacholine, and blockade of methacholine hyperresponsiveness by ipratropium bromide support the concept of denervation hypersensitivity of muscarinic receptors.", 
    "60": "Several physiological parameters were examined for inducing acinar cell proliferation and corresponding increased expression of beta 1-4 galactosyltransferase. In this study, dietary changes causing acinar cell proliferation included the following: the introduction of animals to a liquid diet (causing gland atrophy) followed by re-introduction of solid chow, gustatory stimulation provided by the introduction of 0.5% citric acid to animal drinking water, and removal of the submandibular gland with subsequent reliance on the parotid gland for saliva protein and fluid. Alterations in growth factor levels were produced by injecting animals with a chronic (three-day) regimen of either nerve growth factor (NGF) or epidermal growth factor (EGF). In all cases of acinar cell proliferation in vivo, generated by the above treatments, cell-surface galactosyltransferase was detected along with the unique expression of a 4.5-kb proliferation-associated mRNA. Parotid gland proliferation could be blocked in all cases by the injection of the galactosyltransferase specific modifier protein, alpha-lactalbumin. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, blocked proliferation in all cases except EGF treatment. EGF-induced proliferation could, however, be prevented if the animals were treated with monoclonal antibody to EGF receptor or with the galactosyltransferase modifier alpha-lactalbumin. As a comparison, human parotid tissue samples obtained from neoplastic pleomorphic adenomas, muco-epidermoid carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and a bulimia patient were analyzed for galactosyltransferase expression by Northern blot of mRNA and plasma membrane isolation. Elevated levels of galactosyltransferase were found in all neoplastic tissue preparations as well as in the bulimia sample. Amylase synthesis was reduced in samples compared with surrounding normal tissue from the same patient. In vitro cell culturing of pleomorphic adenoma cells in the presence of galactosyltransferase modifier alpha-lactalbumin and substrate UDP-galactose inhibited proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion. Southern blot analysis of DNA from neoplastic parotid cells showed an alteration in chromosomal gene structure for the galactosyltransferase activator cDNA from the adenoid cystic carcinoma. These results for induced acinar cell proliferation as well as human neoplastic pathologies suggest a direct role for cell surface beta 1-4 galactosyltransferase in signaling growth. Furthermore, the proliferation-associated activity of galactosyltransferase suggests that it may be considered as a new type of cell growth regulator.", 
    "61": "1. We have utilised a new non-imaging echo-Doppler cardiac output device, using the principle of attenuated compensated volume flow (ACVF), to assess the cardiovascular effects of atenolol and buccal nitroglycerin (NTG) in a placebo-controlled study of 30 patients with coronary disease. 2. Atenolol (4 mg i.v.) reduced heart rate, cardiac output and time-averaged mean aortic velocity (P less than 0.01) and increased systemic vascular resistance (P less than 0.01). 3. Buccal NTG (5 mg) reduced systemic mean arterial pressure (P less than 0.01), cardiac stroke volume (P less than 0.05) and stroke length (P less than 0.01). 4. Thus although both drugs reduced time-averaged aortic velocity (an index of cardiac performance), the concomitant reduction in cardiac stroke length and tachycardia suggested sub-optimal cardiac filling for buccal NTG, whereas for atenolol (with the associated increased systemic vascular resistance but unchanged stroke length) attenuation of sympathetic stimulation at cardiac beta-adrenoceptors. 5. The ACVF method of cardiovascular monitoring should prove useful in human pharmacodynamic studies.", 
    "62": "The influence of beta-adrenergic blockade by oral propranolol on the variability of GH responses to GHRH and on GH responsiveness to repeated GHRH administrations was investigated. Eight normal volunteers underwent three tests on three separate occasions. Each test consisted of two administrations of 80 micrograms GHRH at 2-h intervals without other medication (test 1) or combined with oral administration of 80 mg propranolol 90 min before the first (test 2) or the second GHRH injection (test 3). In test 1 GH levels increased significantly after the first, but not the second GHRH bolus (net incremental area under the curve [nAUC], mean +/- SD: 1453 +/- 974 and 178 +/- 309 micrograms.l-1.(120 min)-1, respectively). In test 2 basal GH secretion was not influenced by propranolol administration, whereas the GH response to the first GHRH injection was significantly greater than in test 1 (2327 +/- 1814 micrograms.l-1.(120 min)-1; p less than 0.05). However, individual subjects showed the same variability of GH response as in test 1. The GH response to the second GHRH bolus remained negligible. In test 3 administration of propranolol 90 min before the second GHRH bolus led to a clear GH increase (690 +/- 1002 micrograms.l-1.(120 min)-1), not significantly different from the GH response to the first bolus (1796 +/- 1375 micrograms.l-1.(120 min)-1). However, only 4 subjects showed a marked restoration of the GH responsiveness to the second GHRH administration. In conclusion, oral administration of propranolol is able to increase GH responsiveness to GHRH without changing the great individual variability. The response to a repeated GHRH stimulation is only partially restored by propranolol.",

    "64": "Neotenic larval Ambystoma tigrinum were subjected to hypercapnia (3% CO2, 22 Torr) for 24 h under different conditions: alpha-adrenergic blockade using phentolamine, beta-adrenergic blockade using propranolol, and sham treatments. The sham animals were able to carry out a partial extracellular pH compensation that consisted of an increase in extracellular [HCO3-]. Animals treated with catecholamine antagonists did not compensate to the same extent. Analysis of plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection revealed a significant increase in circulating norepinephrine, but not epinephrine, during the high-CO2 exposure. Measurements of cutaneous ion transport showed that beta-antagonists block the increased Na+ influx associated with hypercapnia, whereas alpha-antagonists inhibited the decrease in cutaneous Cl- influx that is also associated with respiratory acidosis. Additionally, both alpha- and beta-blockers inhibited the increase in transcutaneous potential difference that accompanied the respiratory acidosis. The results are consistent with a role for circulating catecholamines in compensatory ion transport responses to respiratory acidosis in this species.", 
    "65": "Administration of nerve growth factor (NGF) twice daily for 2 days to young rats (11 days old at the time of the initial injection) resulted in an 8.1-fold increase in [3H]thymidine levels of the parotid gland, and a 9.7-fold increase in levels of the submandibular gland when compared to untreated controls. Isoproterenol (ISO), a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, caused an 8.7-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA of the parotid gland, and a 10.7-fold increase in [3H]thymidine in the submandibular gland when compared to controls. The increase in thymidine was accompanied by parotid gland enlargement as well as an increase in cell surface beta 1-4 galactosyltransferase, an enzyme whose expression has been associated previously with acinar cell proliferation. Administration of NGF and ISO together were not additive in their effects on the parotid and submandibular glands. The introduction of propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, completely negated the ISO effects on the salivary glands but was only partially effective in blocking the NGF effects on the glands. An assay of parotid levels of norepinephrine showed NGF treatment to cause an increase in gland-associated levels of neurotransmitter. Removal of the submandibular/sublingual glands prior to administration of ISO prevented the above changes in the parotid gland. NGF administered to partially sialoadenectomized rats was also less effective in inducing parotid gland hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Simultaneous administration of NGF and ISO to the partially sialoadenectomized rats had an additive influence on [3H]thymidine incorporation, galactosyltransferase expression and gland hypertrophy. The results suggest that NGF influences salivary gland cell growth in part through activation of cell-surface beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "66": "Hemodynamic effects of intravenous and oral pindolol and atenolol were assessed in ten healthy volunteers by left ventricular echocardiography and systolic time intervals. Measurements were made at rest and during hand-grip-induced isometric exercise. Drug doses were pindolol 0.015 mg/kg intravenously and 10 mg/day orally, atenolol 0.1 mg/kg intravenously, and 50 mg/day orally. Heart rate at rest was reduced by both drugs. The reduction caused by atenolol during oral treatment was significantly greater (p less than 0.01). Intravenously only pindolol reduced mean arterial pressure. During oral treatment atenolol reduced the mean arterial pressure nonsignificantly. Both drugs lowered heart rate during isometric exercise, atenolol being significantly more effective. During oral treatment atenolol blunted the heart-rate reaction to exercise. Mean arterial pressure during isometric exercise rose slightly with both drugs after intravenous administration. During oral treatment only atenolol reduced the mean arterial pressure significantly. Intravenous atenolol reduced cardiac contractility at rest, indicated by significant decreases in fractional shortening, ejection fraction, and the mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening. In contrast, intravenous pindolol and oral therapy with either drug did not change contractility. Intravenous atenolol raised total peripheral resistance. The preejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio decreased with intravenous pindolol, while atenolol increased it. In conclusion, atenolol had more negative inotropic and chronotropic effects, especially after acute intravenous administration. Only atenolol reduced cardiac output and increased peripheral resistance. After repeated oral administration, these effects were less apparent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "A lidocaine bolus of 2 mg/kg has been shown to decrease the incidence of ventricular fibrillation in cardiac surgical patients during reperfusion following aortic cross-clamp release (CCR). In an effort to extend this effect into the immediate postoperative period, many centers routinely administer a prophylactic lidocaine infusion for the first 12 to 24 hours after surgery. Sequential total serum lidocaine levels were measured over 6 hours in 28 adult cardiac surgical patients without liver, kidney, or respiratory disease, and free serum lidocaine levels were measured in 15 of these patients. In addition, pharmacokinetic data were collected and analyzed in 8 of these patients. Each patient received a lidocaine bolus of 1.5 mg/kg and an infusion at 2 mg/min immediately before CCR. Serum levels were determined just before CCR, and at 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 minutes after CCR. More than 50% of patients had subtherapeutic total serum lidocaine levels from 20 to 120 minutes after CCR, but free lidocaine levels remained within the therapeutic range. No patient showed malignant ventricular dysrhythmias during the study. The results suggest that (1) it may be misleading to estimate free lidocaine concentration based on total lidocaine levels; and (2) free drug is the moiety responsible for lidocaine's antiarrhythmic effect.", 
    "68": "The combination of benzodiazepines and high-dose narcotics has been reported to produce hypotension in patients undergoing coronary artery surgery. This study was performed to evaluate the cardiovascular effects of lower doses of the narcotic sufentanil administered with the benzodiazepine midazolam. Thirty adult patients with good ventricular function undergoing elective coronary revascularization received sufentanil, 2.5 micrograms/kg, and midazolam, 0.1 mg/kg, followed by infusions of sufentanil, 0.7 to 1.5 micrograms/kg/h, and midazolam, 0.07 to 0.15 mg/kg/h. Overall, stable hemodynamics were achieved before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Patients who were not receiving preoperative beta-adrenergic blockade (n = 15) had increases from baseline heart rate and rate-pressure product after sternotomy, during aortic dissection, and after CPB that were not clinically significant. Five patients developed hypertension (increases greater than 20% over the baseline value), which was controlled with additional sufentanil or a vasodilator. Hypertension requiring vasodilator therapy did not occur in patients taking beta-adrenergic blockers. Blood pressure decreases exceeding 20% of the baseline value did not occur. Two of 15 patients receiving beta-blockers, versus 3 of 15 not receiving beta-blockers, developed ischemic electrocardiographic changes before CPB (NS); one of these patients without beta-blockade had a postoperative myocardial infarction. The results of this study show that the infusion of low doses of sufentanil with midazolam provides a hemodynamically safe and stable anesthetic for coronary artery surgery and avoids the hypotension seen when a high-dose narcotic is combined with a benzodiazepine.", 
    "69": "Beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents have been used to relieve symptoms mainly in patients with ischemic heart disease. Prophylactic use of beta blockade in patients after acute myocardial infarction has shown a reduction in total mortality and also in sudden death. The overall total mortality reduction amounts to about 30%, whereas the reduction in the sudden death rate is 50%. The mechanisms behind this reduction in sudden death are probably manifold. Antiarrhythmic effects in ischemic myocardium, prevention of new ischemia, and also perhaps other factors may play a role. Apart from the prevention effect in chronic ischemic heart disease, beta blockers have also been able to reduce the sudden death rate in the long QT syndrome and are suggested for use in congestive cardiomyopathy.",

To all patients concluding the study (n = 92), felodipine was given openly, and the antihypertensive effect and tolerability was studied for 1 year. Patients with a diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mmHg, despite beta-blocker treatment, were randomized to treatment with felodipine 5 mg twice daily (n = 51) or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (n = 52) once daily for 4 weeks. The dose was then doubled in all patients for a second 4-week period. During open follow-up, all patients were given felodipine 5-15 mg (starting dose 5 mg) twice daily in addition to the beta-blocker. Hydrochlorothiazide could also be added. Reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly greater with felodipine than with hydrochlorothiazide at both the low and high dose levels. There were significantly more responders (diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mmHg or fall of greater than or equal to 10 mmHg) in the felodipine group. Felodipine and hydrochlorothiazide were both well tolerated. Hydrochlorothiazide treatment was accompanied by a decrease in serum potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. One year of treatment felodipine therapy resulted in a blood pressure fall from baseline of 34/23 mmHg. The most commonly reported adverse event was ankle edema. No clinically important changes in blood tests were seen during felodipine treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "Induced hypotension is frequently used during cerebral aneurysm dissection and clipping to reduce the risk of rupture. The ideal hypotensive agent does not exist and many drugs are currently used for the purpose of inducing hypotension. When used correctly serious complications are rare. These complications are either related to (1) the physiological effects of hypotension on the vital organs, namely, the brain, the heart, the lungs, the liver and the kidneys, or (2) the pharmacology of the respective hypotensive agent used which currently include the direct vasodilators-sodium nitroprusside and nitroglycerin; inhalation agents--isoflurane, enflurane and halothane; ganglionic blocker--trimethaphan; alpha/beta blockers- labetalol, esmolol; calcium channel blockers; and the experimental compound adenosine.

    "74": "The effect of nipradilol, a newly developed beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent with a vasodilatory action, on myocardial energy metabolism has been examined in the dog ischaemic heart, and compared with that of propranolol. Ischaemia was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. Either saline, nipradilol (0.3 mg kg-1), or propranolol (1 mg kg-1) was injected intravenously 5 min before coronary ligation. After 3 or 30 min of coronary ligation, the ischaemic region of the myocardium was removed, and the endocardial portion used to determine the levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP), creatine phosphate (CrP) and lactate. Ischaemia decreased the levels of ATP and CrP, and increased the levels of ADP, AMP and lactate. Immediately after the injection of nipradilol, rapid falls in blood pressure and heart rate were observed. Pretreatment with nipradilol lessened the decreases in the levels of ATP and CrP and the increases in the levels of AMP and lactate, caused by 3 min of ischaemia, to the same extent as propranolol. However, after 30 min of ischaemia, nipradilol had no effect on myocardial metabolism unlike propranolol. These results indicate that nipradilol can reduce ischaemic influences on myocardial metabolism as well as propranolol, but only in the early stages of ischaemia.", 
    "75": "The paper analyses the results of a 10-year prospective study of 396 patients with coronary heart disease concurrent with stable angina pectoris of different functional classes without serious concomitant diseases. In all the patients. coronary angiography revealed stenosis of one-to-three great coronary arteries and ventriculography showed no severe abnormalities in left ventricular contractility. A long-term drug therapy promoted not only improvement of the clinical status in most patients, but maintenance of work capacity and increase of their lifespan. The annual mortality rate was 3.0%, the incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction was 5.9%. Repeated coronary angiography indicated that progression of coronary atherosclerosis was accompanied by a clinical deterioration in the patients' health and a decrease in exercise tolerance.", 
    "76": "The effects of beta-antagonists (propranolol, pindolol, atenolol) and beta 1-partial agonists (xamoterol, denopamine) on the pulmonary circulation, and on the pressor response to 5-HT were investigated and compared with those of a beta-agonist, isoproterenol. These agents (at doses of 0.002-20 mg) were administrated into the isolated lung lobe perfusion system excised from mongrel dogs (7-12 kg in weight). Under standard conditions (mean pulmonary inflow pressure, 15 mmHg; mean outflow pressure, 5 mmHg), propranolol and atenolol had no effect on pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) at the tested doses, but pindolol which has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) and two beta 1-partial agonists significantly decreased PVR in a dose-dependent manner (each n = 7). Isoproterenol, up to a dose of 0.2 mg, markedly decreased PVR, but induced vasoconstriction in larger doses (n = 7). Propranolol and xamoterol similarly reduced the pressor response to 30 micrograms of 5-HT from a dose of 2 mg, and these inhibitory actions were greater than those of the other drugs. Pindolol and denopamine inhibited the 5-HT response in a dose of 20 mg, whereas atenolol only augmented the response in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, beta-antagonists with ISA (including beta 1-partial agonist activity) can dilate the pulmonary vessels in a dose-dependent manner, but not beta-antagonists without ISA. Furthermore, the 5-HT inhibitory effects caused by relatively large doses of beta-antagonists, except for atenolol, may be related to the 5-HT receptor blockade or other unknown mechanisms, including calcium influx or prostaglandin synthesis, but not to the beta-receptor blockade.", 
    "77": "Thiazide diuretics may be more effective as antihypertensive agents in many subsets of patients than other medications, especially in reducing systolic blood pressure. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers are less effective than calcium blockers or diuretics in black hypertensives and beta-blockers may be less effective in the elderly. Calcium blockers are equally effective in blacks, whites and the elderly but may not be as efficacious as diuretics. When used as initial monotherapy, most available antihypertensive drugs produce significant adverse subjective effects in about 8-10% of patients; centrally acting drugs, however, may produce annoying side effects in 20-30% of patients. Usually, some medication can be found that lowers blood pressure and is acceptable to the patient. Adverse metabolic effects are probably of limited long-term clinical significance except in a few patients. An approach to therapy that will prove effective in a majority of patients is outlined. Any one of the four classes of agents may appropriately be used as initial monotherapy (diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium blockers). Diuretics are recommended as the second drug of choice if one of the other agents is used first. With this approach approximately 80% or more of patients can be controlled at normotensive levels on one or at most two drugs.", 
    "78": "The effect of intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of noradrenaline (NA) on the blood pressure was studied in anaesthetised rabbits. Adrenoceptor blockers were used to study the specific adrenoceptor mediating the response. The results indicated a hypotensive response to icv injection of NA. This hypotensive response to NA was blocked by alpha-2 (yohimbine) and beta-1 (metoprolol) but not by alpha-1 (prazosin) and beta-2 (butoxamine) adrenoceptor blockers.", 
    "79": "This article reports thin-layer chromatographic data (corrected Rf-values; Rcf-values) of 20 commonly used beta-blockers which are regularly encountered in toxicological analysis. Silica gel was used as stationary phase and ten systems according to the proposals of the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; DFG) were chosen as solvents.", 
    "80": "Oesophageal varices: prophylactic treatment? Patients with oesophageal varices as a result of liver cirrhosis are at risk of bleeding from these varices. Because of the high mortality, specially from the first variceal haemorrhage, it would seem justified to pose the question: does prophylactic treatment of oesophageal varices reduce the risk of bleeding and improve life expectancy? A review of the literature shows that until now no mode of prophylactic therapy has succeeded in accomplishing these goals. It is not, therefore, possible at this time to advise the use of prophylactic treatment of oesophageal varices as a routine therapy.", 
    "81": "A human intestinal cell line, Caco-2, was used as a model to study the passive diffusion of drugs across intestinal epithelium. The cells formed continuous monolayers when grown on permeable filters of polycarbonate. After 10 days in culture, the monolayers had a transmembrane resistance of approximately 260 ohms.cm2 and a cell density of 0.9 x 10(6) cells/cm2. At this time the cells were impermeable to [14C]polyethyleneglycol (MW 4000). These characteristics remained constant for 20 days (i.e., from day 10 to day 30). Six beta-blocking agents with a 2000-fold range of lipophilicity were studied for their transepithelial transport properties. The transport parameters were independent of drug concentration and transport direction. The apparent permeability coefficients ranged from 41.91 +/- 4.31 x 10(-6) cm/s for the most lipophilic drug, propranolol, to 0.203 +/- 0.004 x 10(-6) cm/s for the most hydrophilic drug, atenolol. The transport parameters were compared with those published for rat ileum. The transport rates were similar for four out of five drugs. Atenolol was transported at a slower rate in the Caco-2 model, which may be explained by the fact that the Caco-2 cells form a tighter epithelium than the rat ileal enterocytes. The findings of this paper indicate that Caco-2 cells may be used to model the intestinal absorption of drugs.", 
    "82": "1. In 24 patients who were undergoing coronary arteriography for the assessment of ischaemic heart disease, the relationship between the systemic and coronary vascular responses to acute intravenous digoxin administration (500 micrograms) and concurrent drug therapy with the calcium antagonist verapamil (group I) or a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (group II) or neither of these agents (group III) was examined. 2. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) tended to rise rapidly after digoxin injection in patients in groups II and III, and tended to decline initially in patients in group I; however, these differences were not statistically significant (variance ratio [VR] = 0.77). 3. No significant differences were observed in coronary vascular responses to acute digoxin administration between the three groups of patients (VR = 0.34). 4. For the entire group of 24 patients, no statistically significant digoxin-induced effects on resistance could be demonstrated in either the systemic or coronary circulations, although in individual patients vasoconstrictor effects were observed. 5. We conclude that acute intravenous administration of digoxin does not consistently cause systemic or coronary vasoconstriction in patients with ischaemic heart disease. Variability in vasomotor responses to digoxin is not clearly related to concurrent drug therapy with verapamil or a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. The observation that systemic vascular resistance tends to increase in the first few minutes after digoxin injection should be addressed in future studies.", 
    "83": "Using the cannula inserting method, vasodilator responses to alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists (clonidine, guanabenz, DJ7141 and xylazine) were investigated in isolated and perfused rat common carotid arteries. Alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists dose-dependently induced a vasodilation in preparations preconstricted by noradrenaline. The potencies were in the order of clonidine greater than guanabenz greater than DJ-7141 greater than or equal to xylazine. Removal of the endothelium inhibited ACh-induced vasodilation, but not the alpha 2-agonist-induced dilation. Atropine treatment inhibited ACh-induced vasodilation, but not the alpha 2-agonist-induced dilation. Alpha 2-agonist-induced dilations were not modified by beta-blockade, which significantly suppressed isoprenaline-induced vasodilations. The potent alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist DG5128 did not influence the alpha 2-agonist-induced vasodilation. In preparations preconstricted by PGF2 alpha, clonidine and xylazine never induced a vasodilation, and clonidine frequently induced vasoconstrictions that were completely blocked by bunazosin. It is concluded that alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist-induced vasodilation is independent from the existence of the endothelium, and that it is not related to vascular beta- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors and muscarinic receptors, suggesting that the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist-induced vasodilation is due to an antagonistic activity towards the vascular alpha 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "84": "The present study was conducted to determine the influence of dibutyryl-cAMP (dbcAMP), epinephrine, ractopamine and clenbuterol on insulin binding to porcine adipocytes. Dibutyryl-cAMP decreased insulin binding to swine adipocytes by 40 and 20% at 1.8 and 25.8 ng insulin/ml, respectively. Ractopamine and clenbuterol directly reduced insulin binding at the low insulin concentration and decreased binding at high insulin concentrations in the presence of adenosine deaminase. Scatchard analysis suggested that the reduction of insulin binding was due to a decrease in receptor number. Epinephrine alone did not influence insulin binding. In the presence of theophylline, epinephrine decreased binding at both low and high insulin concentrations; however, ractopamine plus theophylline decreased binding only at the low insulin concentration. Clenbuterol did not affect insulin binding in the presence of theophylline. Propranolol blocked the inhibitory effect of epinephrine on insulin binding. These beta-adrenergic agonists can inhibit insulin binding and, thus, antagonize insulin action in swine adipocytes.", 
    "85": "The antihypertensive effect of betaxolol, a highly selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, was investigated in renal hypertensive dogs, and the mechanism was also studied. A single oral administration of betaxolol (1 and 10 mg/kg) lowered blood pressure dose-dependently. The hypotensive effect of betaxolol was enhanced by daily oral administration for 10 days. In anesthetized dogs, intraarterial injection of betaxolol produced a dose-dependent increase in femoral artery flow; and in this test, betaxolol was 3 times less potent than papaverine. The increase in blood flow with betaxolol was not affected by pretreatment with propranolol. These findings indicate that a certain vasodilating activity may contribute to the antihypertensive mechanism of betaxolol.", 
    "86": "Betaxolol is a highly selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. In this study, the antihypertensive effect of betaxolol was investigated in experimental hypertensive rats; and the antihypertensive mechanism was also studied. Betaxolol (1 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) produced acute hypotensive effects in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), renal hypertensive rats, deoxycorticosterone/saline hypertensive rats and normotensive rats. The effect was particularly marked in SHR. Furthermore, daily oral administration of betaxolol to SHR for 3 weeks showed sustained antihypertensive effects without producing tolerance. In pithed rats, the pressor response induced by an electrical stimulation of the spinal cord was inhibited by both betaxolol and atenolol. However, only betaxolol reduced the pressor response to norepinephrine. These findings suggest that a certain relaxing effect on peripheral vascular beds in addition to inhibition of presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors may contribute to the antihypertensive mechanism of betaxolol.", 
    "87": "The effect of betaxolol, a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, on ischemic myocardial metabolism was studied in dog hearts subjected to an occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 10 or 30 min. Betaxolol (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg) was injected i.v. 5 min before ischemia. Betaxolol decreased heart rate, (+)dp/dt, coronary flow and blood pressure. Coronary occlusion decreased the levels of creatine phosphate, adenosine triphosphate, total adenine nucleotides and energy charge potential in the ischemic myocardium. Ten minutes after ischemia, betaxolol significantly diminished these impairments of energy metabolism. Even 30 min after ischemia, a higher dose of betaxolol significantly inhibited the depletion of total adenine nucleotides. Myocardial ischemia produced a breakdown of glycogen, an accumulation of lactate and an inhibition of glycolytic flux through the phosphofructokinase reaction. Betaxolol also reduced these alterations of carbohydrate metabolism 10 min after ischemia. These results indicate that betaxolol delays the onset of myocardial metabolic change from aerobic to anaerobic during ischemia and hence reduces the severity of myocardial ischemic injury.", 
    "88": "1. Pretreatment of rats with the non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist dihydroergotamine counteracts the inhibition of glucose-induced insulin secretion caused by lithium both in vitro and in vivo. The present study was therefore carried out to specify further which type of adrenoceptor is involved in lithium-induced hyperglycaemia and inhibition of insulin secretion. 2. The lithium-induced effects were reversibly blocked by pretreatment of rats with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine or a combination of yohimbine and the non-selective beta-receptor antagonist propranolol, whereas the alpha 1-receptor antagonist prazosin and propranolol alone were ineffective in blocking these effects. 3. These findings suggest that the effects of lithium on plasma glucose and insulin levels are mediated mainly by the stimulation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "89": "1. The effect of 1 week of treatment with propranolol LA (160 mg), atenolol (100 mg) and metoprolol CR (100 mg) on awareness of and the physiological responses to moderate hypoglycaemia were compared with placebo using a randomised, cross-over design in 12 healthy volunteers. 2. All three beta-adrenoceptor antagonists reduced resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure and heart rate responses to submaximal exercise compared with placebo. 3. Under hyperinsulinaemic (60 mu m-2 min-1) clamp conditions, at a blood glucose of 2.5 mmol l-1, atenolol prevented the rise in systolic and atenolol and metoprolol CR prevented the fall in diastolic blood pressure usually associated with hypoglycaemia. At this level of hypoglycaemia, the expected increase in heart rate was inhibited by atenolol but not metoprolol CR. Pre-treatment with propranolol LA resulted in a significant pressor response and a bradycardia during hypoglycaemia. In addition the normal increase in finger tremor was abolished by propranolol LA. 4. During hypoglycaemia all three beta-adrenoceptor blockers augmented sweating compared with placebo but hypoglycaemic symptoms, awareness and slowing of reaction time were the same with drugs and placebo. 5. The rise in plasma adrenaline and other counter-regulatory hormones during hypoglycaemia was enhanced by beta-adrenoceptor blockade. 6. We conclude that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists modify the physiological and hormonal responses to, but do not adversely affect awareness of, moderate hypoglycaemia in healthy volunteers."
