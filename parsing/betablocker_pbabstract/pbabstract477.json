    "0": "The safety and efficacy of oral sotalol, an investigational beta-adrenergic blocker with class III antiarrhythmic drug properties, were examined in a multicenter study in 236 patients with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. In 104 patients, the index arrhythmia was a cardiac arrest, and all patients had undergone at least 3 previous unsuccessful antiarrhythmic trials (mean = 5 per patient). In the 106 patients assessed by programmed electrical stimulation, sotalol completely suppressed induction of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 33 (31%) and rendered VT slower (greater than 100 ms prolongation of cycle length) or more difficult to induce in 29 (27%). Using continuous 24-hour ambulatory monitoring methods, sotalol complete- and partial-response rates were 51 and 12%, respectively. Of the 236 acute-phase patients, 151 were discharged receiving long-term sotalol therapy. The median sotalol dose was 480 mg/day. At a mean follow-up of 346 +/- 92 days, 27 patients (18%) had recurrence of sustained arrhythmia; 9, sudden death; 11, sustained VT; 5, automatic defibrillator discharge; and 2, syncope. Adverse effects forced discontinuation of therapy in 10 patients (7%): 6 secondary to symptomatic bradyarrhythmia, 2 due to refractory heart failure, 1 due to torsades de pointes, and 1 from bronchospasm. Life-table analysis of sotalol's overall long-term efficacy at 6, 12 and 18 months were 80, 76 and 72%, respectively. Although mean follow-up was short (less than 1 year), neither acute-phase programmed stimulation nor 24-hour ambulatory monitoring responses were significantly predictive of subsequent arrhythmic outcome. Proarrhythmia was documented in 18 patients (7%), 17 during the acute phase and 1 during long-term follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "Sotalol, one of the first beta-receptor antagonists synthesized, is a promising investigational agent with remarkable efficacy for treatment of patients with ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. Unlike other beta blockers, sotalol also possesses class III antiarrhythmic action, evidenced by prolongation of the myocardial action potential duration. This additional action probably accounts for the greater antiarrhythmic efficacy of sotalol compared with other beta blockers. Sotalol's class III antiarrhythmic action becomes apparent at concentrations higher than those necessary for significant beta-receptor antagonism, both in vitro and in human subjects. In a study correlating dosage and antiarrhythmic response with prolongation of rate-corrected QT (QTc) (a measure of class III action) and the degree of beta-receptor blockade (assessed by the reduction of the maximal exercise-induced heart rate), 11 of 17 patients had an antiarrhythmic response. Eight of these 11 responders had been unresponsive to conventional beta-receptor antagonists. The plasma concentration associated with significant QTc prolongation (2.55 micrograms/ml) was found to be much greater than that associated with 50% reduction in maximal slowing of heart rate (0.8 micrograms/ml). As with other beta-receptor antagonists, the activities of sotalol's 2 stereoisomers differ, with the I-isomer having far more beta-blocking activity. However, both isomers have equal class III antiarrhythmic activity. When increasing doses of the d-isomer of sotalol (50 to 400 mg every 12 hours) were evaluated in patients with chronic ventricular arrhythmias, arrhythmia frequency was suppressed greater than 80% in 3 patients and 50% in 1 patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "Beta-blocking drugs have been shown to reduce the overall mortality and risk of sudden cardiac death in survivors of acute myocardial infarction. It is not known whether such an effect is mediated by suppression of ventricular premature complexes (VPCs). The circadian rhythmicity of ventricular arrhythmia can also be suppressed by beta-blocking drugs, and this may help reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death during the morning hours. Recent studies have also shown that beta blockers can provide a safe and effective combination with class IA antiarrhythmic agents when arrhythmias cannot be controlled with class IA agents alone. Sotalol, a nonselective beta antagonist, has unique electrophysiologic properties, and several studies have shown it to be more effective than conventional beta blockers in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias. However, direct comparative studies of the suppression of VPCs are lacking. In a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study, the antiarrhythmic effects of sotalol and propranolol were compared in 172 patients with greater than 30 VPCs/hour. After the initial 1-week washout and 1-week placebo period, patients were randomly assigned to either 160 mg of sotalol administered twice daily (76 patients) or 40 mg of propranolol administered 3 times daily (91 patients). Those responding to therapy (decreases greater than 75% VPCs) continued to take these doses, but nonresponders were given higher doses, 320 mg of sotalol twice daily or 80 mg of propranolol 3 times daily, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "Rats were trained on a fixed interval (FI 20 s) schedule of food reinforcement, then subjected to drug trials on an ABBA design. Responses, recorded in 2 s post-reinforcement bins, formed a temporal generalization gradient. d,l-propranolol (7.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) decreased responding in bins two to four, in which control response rates were relatively low, but increased responding in bins five to eight, in which control response rates were higher. The effect was weaker at 5 mg/kg, non-significant at 2.5 mg/kg and absent at 1 and 10 mg/ kg. A similar effect was seen in a single trial of d,l-propranolol (7.5 mg/kg) on FI 40. I- propranolol (3.75 mg/kg) reproduced this effect in part, whereas d-propranolol (7.5 mg/kg) and the peripherally acting beta-blocker, atenolol (10, 20 mg/kg), were without any effect.", 
    "4": "Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that epinephrine via alpha(2)-adrenoreceptor modulation can restore the sensitivity of aspirin-treated platelets to the action of agonists independent of secretion of granule contents or synthesis of prostanoids. The present study has evaluated the effects of full strength aspirin (take on alternate days) and low dose aspirin (taken daily) and sought to determine whether agents which antagonise alpha or beta adrenergic receptors can prevent the corrective influence of epinephrine on aspirin-treated platelets. Adult volunteers were given 325 mg aspirin every other day or 80 mg aspirin daily. After confirming the inhibitory effect of aspirin, these individuals were given yohimbine (5 mg), atenolol (100 mg), verapamil (160 mg) or ethanol (white wine 8 oz). Two hours later, blood was drawn for platelet studies. Cells exposed to aspirin did not aggregate when stirred with arachidonate (0.45 mM) or epinephrine (5 M) alone. Addition of epinephrine to aspirin treated platelets restored the sensitivity to the action of arachidonate and resulted in irreversible aggregation. Ethanol and verapamil at the concentrations tested did not potentiate the action of aspirin. Ingestion of yohimbine, an alpha(2)-adrenergic antagonist, or atenolol, a beta blocker, prevented the corrective influence of epinephrine on aspirin-treated refractory platelets. Results suggest that alpha and beta blockers may serve a useful role in reinforcing the antithrombotic influence of aspirin in vivo.",

    "6": "The efficacy of treatment with diuretics and vasodilators in heart failure has shown that compensatory mechanisms may induce vicious circles that can precipitate the deterioration of congestive heart failure (CHF). By counteracting sympathetic stimulation of cardiac beta-receptors, beta-blocking drugs could provide some benefit in CHF. Indeed, the sympathetic stimulation enhances metabolic costs and could lead to a further deterioration of myocardial fiber function. This could be counteracted by beta-blockade. On the contrary, the loss of adrenergic responsiveness due to beta-adrenergic downregulation and depletion of norepinephrine stores from sympathetic nerves could be responsible for the progressive deterioration of cardiac function. Moderate doses of beta-blocking agents could restore such a catecholamine sensitivity by upregulation of beta-receptors and restoration of norepinephrine stores. Results of clinical trials with beta-blockade in CHF are so far controversial. Most studies enrolled patients with cardiomyopathy and included small numbers of patients or were uncontrolled. The CIBIS trial (Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study) has been launched in Europe to answer the question of the potential benefit on prognosis of beta-blockade therapy in heart failure from any etiology, especially ischemic CHF. It is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind multicentric trial involving two parallel groups of patients (300 in each group) followed over a 2-year period. Results from the CIBIS trial should provide conclusive information concerning the use of beta-blocking therapy in CHF.", 
    "7": "Forty outpatients (11 men and 29 women) aged between 65 and 85 years (mean age of 68 years) with mild to moderate hypertension [mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) after 2 weeks on placebo of 175/102 mm Hg] were included in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to compare the efficacy and tolerance of 10 mg of bisoprolol once daily (o.d., n = 20) and 20 mg of nifedipine sustained release (SR) b.i.d. (n = 20) during 4 weeks of treatment. SBP and DBP were significantly reduced compared to baseline with both treatments. There was no significant difference in efficacy between the two treatments after 2 and 4 weeks. After 2 weeks, the number of patients with normalized DBP (< or =90 mm Hg) was higher with bisoprolol than with nifedipine, this difference no longer being present after 4 weeks. Resting heart rate was significantly reduced with bisoprolol from 78+/-8 to 68+/-9 beats/min after 4 weeks, but there was no change in heart rate with nifedipine. Adverse events were reported by 6 patients on bisoprolol (20 events) and 12 patients on nifedipine (51 events) and the overall tolerance of bisoprolol was considered to be significantly better than that of nifedipine. Because bisoprolol is equally effective when administered once daily in comparison with nifedipine SR, which has to be given twice daily, and since bisoprolol exhibits a better tolerance, this beta-blocker appears to be a useful drug of first choice for the treatment of elderly hypertensive patients.", 
    "8": "The aim of the study was to assess the course of the alerting reaction during an effective antihypertensive treatment, and to discuss its interference with the conduct of therapy. In 28 patients suffering from mild to moderate hypertension, the basal blood pressure was measured in an outpatient clinic according to a standardized procedure, first by a nurse, then by a 12-min recorded monitoring, and then by a physician using a mercury sphygmomanometer with the patient in the upright and then the supine position. In comparison with the monitoring (mean values recorded at 6, 9, and 12 min), there was a significant increase in diastolic and systolic blood pressure taken by the nurse and by the physician, which diminished at the end of the visit with the physician. Patients then received 10 mg of bisoprolol each morning and presented again on day 30 and day 60, following the same procedure and under identical conditions. Despite the desired antihypertensive effect, the alerting reaction persisted at each visit up to the end of the study, being unchanged in the case of the systolic blood pressure and accentuated in the case of the diastolic blood pressure. Our results confirm those of previous investigations showing that even an effective antihypertensive therapy is unequivocally associated with a persisting alerting reaction irrespective of the antihypertensive drug applied. Thus, patients may be exposed to the potential risk involved with false failures and unnecessary overtreatment. The physician must compare his or her own measurements with readings made outside the consulting office and must program ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in the case of discrepancy. This is a suitable means of confirming and validating blood pressure measurements, as this method does not record the alerting reaction.", 
    "9": "There are important pharmacodynamic differences between the various beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs, whereas the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors differ mainly in their pharmacokinetic properties. The differing properties of the beta-blocking drugs may contribute to their antihypertensive effect; possibly, the beta1-selective agents are slightly more effective. Comparisons between groups of drugs may not be fully applicable to all members of the group. Overall, however, beta-blocking drugs and ACE inhibitors appear to control the resting blood pressure to a similar degree, whereas on exercise the rise in blood pressure is inhibited to a greater extent by beta1-blockade. ACE inhibitors reverse the hemodynamic changes of hypertension in contrast to beta1-blocking drugs without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). Neither group of drugs interferes with cardiovascular reflexes such as the response to posture. The beta-blocking drugs have specific contraindications such as asthma and heart failure. Although some earlier studies suggested otherwise, more recent smaller investigations suggest that overall patient acceptability of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers is similar. In certain instances, particularly in the presence of diuretics, a large first-dose effect with a profound fall in blood pressure may be seen with ACE inhibitors. In contrast to other drugs, there is some evidence that beta-blocking drugs have a cardioprotective effect. ACE inhibitors and beta-blocking drugs have a similar spectrum of activity, with black patients responding less well. Although in dispute, drugs are often useful in the elderly. Both groups possess additional therapeutic indications that may influence the choice to treat hypertension.", 
    "10": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of long-term monotherapy with four beta-blockers provided with different pharmacological properties on plasma lipids in both normocholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic hypertensive patients. After a 1-month run-in period on placebo, 70 hypertensive patients with basal total cholesterol (TC) < or = 220 mg/dl were treated for 3 years with propranolol 160 mg/day or atenolol 100 mg/day or bisoprolol 10 mg/day or mepindolol 10 mg/day, while 59 hypertensive patients with basal TC > 220 mg/dl were given the same beta-blockers at the same dosage for 6 months. In both normocholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic hypertensive patients. HDL-C and triglyceride (TG) levels showed significant changes that appeared to be related to the type of beta-blocker used and to the duration of therapy. Nonselective, non-ISA (intrinsic sympathomimetic activity) propranolol caused the most pronounced changes, decreasing HDL-C and increasing TG concentrations; beta1-selective atenolol and bisoprolol had similar, but less remarkable effects; even more discrete changes were observed on mepindolol (with ISA). The variations in HDL-C and TG values reached their peak in 6-12 months of beta-blocker therapy; then, after a plateau phase, they showed a progressive trend toward pretreatment levels. In hypercholesterolemic patients, the percent change in both HDL-C and TG values was lower compared to normocholesterolemic patients.", 
    "11": "The MAPHY primary prevention study in hypertensive men aged 40-64 years with diastolic blood pressure above 100 mm Hg showed that total mortality, sudden cardiovascular death, and the pooled incidence of fatal and definite nonfatal coronary events were significantly lower in patients randomized to metoprolol (n = 1,609) than in patients randomized to diuretics (n = 1,625) (p = 0.028, p = 0.017, and p = 0.001, respectively). The publication of the mortality results aroused great interest as well as a number of comments in the literature. The aim of this review is to present comments on the study design, results, and clinical implications of primary preventive studies performed with beta-blockers in hypertension. Statistical analyses of the MAPHY study results convincingly show a substantially lower risk for coronary events in patients on metoprololin relative terms, about a 25% reduction compared with diuretics-with beneficial preventive effects on coronary events both in smokers and nonsmokers. Supporting evidence for the MAPHY study results are available from several other clinical studies in hypertensive men and also from experimental, clinical, and animal studies. The results indicate that the difference in mortality and coronary events in the studies performed probably is mediated via mechanisms other than blood pressure control. Benefits have been attributed to the beta1-blockade of treatment, and evidence suggests that relatively lipophilic beta-blockers are best documented. Cardioselectivity appears to be an advantage for the risk reduction in smokers and also concerning side effects and quality of life. Thus, available data support the choice of a beta-blocker as antihypertensive therapy in patients with increased risk for coronary events unless contraindications limit the choice of these agents. Furthermore, primary prevention and risk reduction in hypertensives is dependent not only on the choice of the antihypertensive agent but also on improved detection and management of the other cardiovascular risk factors.", 
    "12": "The effects of antihypertensive treatment on cerebrovascular disease and coronary artery disease (CAD) end points reported in the large-scale national trials have differed. All trials have shown stroke benefit, whereas CAD benefit has not been convincingly demonstrated in any. In three trials, the effects of thiazide- and beta-blocker-based regimens can be directly compared. In the MRC Treatment Trial for Mild Hypertension in Britain, the largest of the trials and the only one to compare these two classes of drugs with each other and with untreated controls, stroke benefit was significantly greater in the thiazide than in the beta-blocker group (p = 0.002). Indeed, the 70% reduction in fatal strokes and 65% reduction in nonfatal strokes suggested an effect on cerebral infarction as well as on cerebral hemorrhage. Opposing trends were found for CAD end points with beta-blockers and thiazides when compared with controls. For coronary events, sudden deaths, and ECG changes of infarction, significant differences were found between the reduced rates for those receiving propranolol and the higher rates for those receiving bendrofluazide. Weak evidence has been put forward by four trials-MRFIT, HDFP, the Oslo trial, and the MRC trial-suggesting that thiazide treatment for those who already have evidence of coronary disease may be harmful. In no case is the evidence conclusive, and it involves only a small (but important) subgroup. In the MRC trial, a nonselective beta-blocker, propranolol, provided greater CAD benefit as measured by the incidence of myocardial infarction, sudden death, and ECG changes, but only in nonsmokers. Hypotheses generated by these trials need further investigation.", 
    "13": "The adaptation processes under physical activity are regulated through an increase in the sympathetic impulse, whereby the circulation adaptation is mediated specifically by way of beta1-receptors and the energy supply predominantly by way of beta2-receptors. The maximum performance capacity, therefore, is restricted through every form of beta-blockade. However, it follows from the receptor pattern that the mixed beta1/beta2-blockade exhibits a substantially clearer effect. For everyday performance, the predominant beta1-selective blockade represents practically no handicap. The special advantages of beta1-selective-compared to nonselective-blockade are discussed. Beta1-blockers practically do not affect glycogenolysis. Under beta1/beta2-blockers, hypoglycemia could reactively lead to reflective pressure increases and bradycardia through epinephrine release. Beta1-blockers additionally influence the cellular potassium homeostasis to a substantially lower extent. Under nonselective blockers, a distinct increase in the serum potassium and a retardation of the reuptake in the cells are observed. Also, lipolysis is strongly negatively influenced under nonselective blockers. Especially for atherogenesis, the important high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is negatively influenced under nonselective blockers in contrast to selective ones. Under these aspects, results are demonstrated that were obtained in 16 hypertensive patients treated with bisoprolol. In conclusion, beta1-selective blockers are largely \"metabolically neutral\" and are therefore to be preferred.", 
    "14": "Forty outpatients suffering from angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease and concomitant reversible. chronic obstructive bronchitis were treated with the beta1-selective beta-blockers atenolol (50 mg) and bisoprolol (5 mg) for 6 months in each case, following a randomized, double-blind crossover study design. Lung function tests were carried out by means of whole-body plethysmography before and then several times during treatment. 2 to 4 h after drug intake (once daily in the morning). The main target variables for the factorial analysis of variance for comparison of the two beta-blockers were the airway resistance (AWR), the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), and the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Bicycle ergometry was performed before and after therapy in order to check the cardiovascular effects of the two beta-blockers. The patients were questioned as to their angina pectoris and bronchitis symptoms at the monthly check-ups. There was no difference between the two beta-blockers (p > 0.05), both causing a slight increase in AWR, which increased with therapy duration, and a small but significant decrease in FEV1 and PEFR (p < 0.01). The bronchitis symptoms were not affected; however, seasonal influences were detected. Atenolol and bisoprolol had comparably pronounced effects on the cardiovascular parameters during ergometry (blood pressure, heart rate, W x min product, and ST-segment depression) and the frequency of angina pectoris attacks. Even beta1-selective beta-blockers may cause an impairment of lung function in patients with chronic obstructive bronchitis. This may be due to the presence of beta1-adrenoceptors in the bronchial tissue. Fifty milligrams of atenolol and 5 mg of bisoprolol once per day are effective in the treatment of angina pectoris.", 
    "15": "The effect of systemic adrenergic blockade on hypertensive brachial arteries was studied in humans with pulsed Doppler flowmetry. Blockade of beta-receptors by the nonselective beta-blocking agent propranolol did not modify the brachial artery diameter, whereas pindolol increased this parameter for the same degree of blood pressure reduction. The beta1-selective blocking agents atenolol and bisoprolol caused similar decreases in blood pressure and a reduction in the diameters of the brachial artery and abdominal aorta, respectively. The combination of alpha- and beta-blockade produced a rapid drop in blood pressure but did not change the brachial arterial diameter. Thus, following beta-blockade, the arterial diameter increased, did not change, or even decreased despite an adequate blood pressure reduction. It is suggested that beta-blockade in some instances resets the pressure-diameter curve and therefore has a direct action on the arterial wall independent of the mechanical effect of blood pressure reduction.", 
    "16": "Beta-blockers are effective antiarryhthmic agents for certain types of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. They are able to prevent arrhythmias associated with sympathetic hyperactivity, suppress automaticity, and slow conduction in myocardial tissue with predominant slow-response activity. In animal experiments, beta-blockers have been shown to exert pronounced antifibrillatory effects following occlusion of a main coronary artery. This effectiveness may be the basis for the improved survival of patients with chronic coronary artery disease under long-term beta-blockade. Side effects are often dose-related; the optimal and minimal effective doses of the beta-blocker are critical in limiting adverse effects. As conventional antiarrhythmic agents have not been shown to reduce the risk of mortality in postmyocardial infarction patients, a broader application of beta-blockers as antiarrhythmic agents within the future, possibly in combination with class I or III drugs, seems conceivable.", 
    "17": "Beta-adrenoceptor function appears to be diminished in the elderly, although the exact mechanisms are still uncertain. Some evidence suggests that this attenuation is predominantly of beta1-receptor activity, with beta2-receptor activity remaining intact. Pharmacokinetic changes also occur in the elderly with beta-blockers. Absorption is unchanged but bioavailability may be increased, particularly with lipophilic drugs such as propranolol that are subject to \"first-pass\" effects. Both hepatic and renal clearance may be diminished, and this suggests that, in general, elderly patients will require smaller doses than those normally given to younger ones. Although antihypertensive response to beta-blockers has been linked to renin status, clinical trial evidence indicates that beta-blockers are effective antihypertensive agents in the elderly, and clinical experience suggests that this is true also for ischemic heart disease. Provided attention is given to patient selection, associated diseases, and dosage, in general, beta-blockers appear to be well tolerated in the elderly. However, careful clinical supervision is required, particularly during treatment initiation.", 
    "18": "The purpose of the study was to assess the efficacy and tolerance of the beta1-selective beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent bisoprolol in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. A total of 236 outpatients (158 male and 78 female) over 21 years of age (mean age of 57 years and 60 years for men and women, respectively) were included in an open trial of 4 weeks duration. A total of 32.5% of the patients were smokers. After a washout period of at least 1 week, patients were initially treated with 10 mg of bisoprolol o.d. for 2 weeks, after which the dose could be adjusted to 5, 15, or 20 mg in accordance with clinical criteria (efficacy, tolerance). Eighty-eight percent of the patients were maintained on 10 mg of bisoprolol. The frequency of angina attacks was reduced in 89% of all patients: 56% became free of angina attacks. There were no differences in response as related to age and smoking habits. Bisoprolol was well tolerated. Beta-blocker-specific side effects were observed in 12 patients (5.1%). In conclusion, bisoprolol administered once daily appears to be an effective and safe antianginal agent.", 
    "19": "The different mechanisms of action of beta-blockers and calcium antagonists could result in an additive therapeutic effect in patients with angina pectoris. Twenty-one male patients aged between 41 and 68 years and suffering from chronic stable angina pectoris and coronary artery disease confirmed by angiography took part in a randomized, double-blind study to examine the acute effect of 10 mg of bisoprolol, 20 mg of nifedipine, and a combination of the two drugs on hemodynamics at rest and during exercise [heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), rate-pressure product (RPP), cardiac index (CI), total peripheral resistance (TPR), and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCP)], the behavior of the ST segment (ST), and exercise tolerance until occurrence of an ST-segment depression of 0.1 mV (W-ST01) and until onset of anginal pain (W-AP1). Following a baseline exercise test, 11 patients were given 10 mg of bisoprolol orally, whereas 10 patients received placebo. Two hours later, a second exercise test was carried out. All patients in both groups then received 20 mg of N orally. A third exercise test was performed 2 h later. On exercise, bisoprolol resulted in significant changes in HR (-16%), RPP (-22%), and CI (-16%), as well as in TPR (+ 13%); PCP was not significantly affected. Nifedipine led to significant changes in CI (+9%) and PCP (-34%). The effects of bisoprolol on HR and RPP and of nifedipine on PCP were retained in the combination. Competition was detectable as regards the opposing effects on CI and TPR. Measured by W-ST01 and ST, bisoprolol had a marked anti-ischemic effect, whereas that of nifedipine was distinctly less. There was an increase in effect after combination of the drugs (not significant). In patients with chronic angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease, bisoprolol and nifedipine had different hemodynamic profiles after acute administration; when the two drugs were combined, these effects were partly intensified and partly canceled out. There was a tendency for the effect of bisoprolol to be intensified by nifedipine in the combination. The combination of bisoprolol and nifedipine was well tolerated in the doses selected.", 
    "20": "The efficacy of beta-blockade after myocardial infarction (MI) has been investigated in a series of studies. When beta-blockers are used during the first hours after the onset of MI, a reduction in infarct size, mortality, and nonfatal reinfarction may occur. Bisoprolol is a highly beta1-selective beta-blocker, without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), and with a plasma elimination half-life of 10-12 h, permitting treatment with one daily dose. Because no experience with bisoprolol was available in MI, its safety and efficacy were studied in two open, uncontrolled pilot studies. The first study was a dose-finding study in 37 patients with a 3-day-old MI. Bisoprolol was given intravenously and carefully titrated in steps of 1 mg up to a cumulative maximum dose of 5 mg. Subsequently, the patients received 10 mg of oral bisoprolol once daily (o.d.) until the end of the study. Based on the results of this first pilot study, a second pilot study was performed in which bisoprolol was given within the first 6 h after the onset of MI. Intravenous (i.v.) bisoprolol was titrated in two steps of 2.5 mg each, directly followed by 10 mg of oral bisoprolol o.d. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of i.v. and subsequent oral bisoprolol on central hemodynamics. The results of these studies demonstrate that i.v. and subsequent oral administration of bisoprolol is well tolerated and indicate that the selected dose regimen is hemodynamically safe.", 
    "21": "Combined treatment of beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agents and class I antiarrhythmic drugs can potentially have profound and deleterious effects on cardiac impulse formation and conduction. We studied the effect of 5 mg of oral bisoprolol daily and 10 mg/kg of procainamide intravenously with programmed electrical stimulation of the heart in 10 patients with postinfarction ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Oral bisoprolol slowed sinus rhythm and atrioventricular nodal conduction; ventricular effective refractory periods were increased significantly after several days of oral bisoprolol treatment. Combined treatment of oral bisoprolol and intravenous procainamide did not produce clinically relevant changes in parameters of cardiac impulse formation and conduction. This study shows that combined use of bisoprolol and a class I antiarrhythmic drug appears to be safe in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythrhythmias late after myocardial infarction.", 
    "22": "The orthosympathetic nervous system is involved in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. In this study, we carried out tests of sympathetic stimulation using successfully an isometric exercise and a psychological stress. The efficacy of the two tests in 10 normotensive patients (NTs) was assessed by a significant increase in blood pressure and heart rate and a significant increase in metanephrine urinary excretion. These tests, repeated 2 months later, were perfectly reproducible in NTs. The cardiovascular response during exercise and stress was significantly higher in 10 hypertensive patients (HTs) than in NTs. At rest, urinary norepinephrine excretion was significantly higher in HTs. In contrast to NTs, stress in HTs significantly increased urinary excretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine, whereas exercise failed to increase urinary catecholamine excretion in both groups. In HTs, both tests induced an increase in microalbuminuria. Among functional renal parameters, only proximal sodium reabsorption (measured by lithium clearance) was significantly lower in HTs than in NTs, compensated by a higher distal reabsorption. In HTs, 2 months of treatment with bisoprolol reduced rest and peak heart rate and blood pressure, but failed to reduce blood pressure reactivity to the orthosympathetic stimulation. Proximal sodium reabsorption at rest was normalized by the treatment. Bisoprolol was also able to reduce microalbuminuria during the 24 h and in the rest period preceding the test, but the same percent increase was observed during tests.", 
    "23": "The antihypertensive effect and tolerance of bisoprolol and chlorthalidone were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial during 4 weeks of treatment. A total of46 patients, aged 18-65 years, were initially included; 41 patients presenting with a diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 120 mm Hg at the end of a previous placebo period completed the trial. They were randomly allocated to two groups: 22 patients were treated with bisoprolol 10 mg o.d., and 19 patients with chlorthalidone 50 mg o.d. Both treatments induced a significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.001). No difference in antihypertensive efficacy was found between the two treatments after 4 weeks. However, with chlorthalidone, significant changes were found with regard to serum potassium (decrease; p < 0.001) and uric acid (increase: p < 0.05) and the incidence of clinical side effects was higher in the chlorthalidone group (37%) in comparison to the patients treated with bisoprolol (13%).", 
    "24": "In an open multicenter study, 2,012 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were treated for 8 weeks with the beta1-selective blocker bisoprolol. A total of 570 general practitioners participated in this study. A total of 1,597 patients whose resting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ranged from 95 to 115 mm Hg were considered eligible for this study. Patients received one tablet of bisoprolol (5 mg) o.d. for the first 4 weeks. In patients not responding satisfactorily to treatment, the dose could be increased to 10 mg o.d. for the following 4 weeks. A total of 1,201 patients were evaluated for efficacy and all 2,012 patients were evaluated for tolerability. After 4 weeks of therapy, mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was lowered significantly from 170+/-15 to 151+/-14 mm Hg, and mean DBP was lowered from 104+/-5 to 92+/-7 mm Hg. A further 4-week treatment lowered the blood pressure even more: mean SBP from 151+/-14 to 144+/-13 mm Hg and mean DBP from 92+/-7 to 88+/-7 mm Hg. The total extent of both SBP and DBP reduction was equal in all age groups and showed no dependency of the initial blood pressure value. At the end of the study. the responder rate was 94.9% in patients aged under 60 years, and 90.6% in patients aged over 60 years. The age group 31-40 years showed the highest responder rate (97.5%). After 8 weeks of treatment, 69.5% of the patients were still on 5 mg of bisoprolol and 27.6% on 10 mg of bisoprolol. Of all 2,012 patients, 11.6% reported side effects such as vertigo, fatigue. gastrointestinal disturbances, and headache. The incidence of adverse drug reactions was highest in the age group 31-40 years. Bisoprolol proved in this study to be an effective and safe antihypertensive agent when given to patients with mild to moderate hypertension for 8 weeks.", 
    "25": "The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and the safety of bisoprolol (B) and acebutolol (A) on blood pressure at rest and during exercise in hypertensives. The design was a comparative, single-blind study with two phases following a 10-day washout period for pretreated patients: a 15 day-placebo phase and an 8-week therapeutic phase. Forty-six outpatients suffering from mild to moderate essential hypertension [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ranging between 95 and 120 mm Hg] were randomly given either 10 mg of bisoprolol or 400 mg of acebutolol once a day for 8 weeks; this dosage was doubled after 4 weeks if DBP was still above 90 mm Hg. Blood pressure measurements were made 24 h after drug intake at rest and during exercise stress tests and were performed at the end of the placebo period and after 1 and 2 months of active treatment. Serum lipid levels were also measured before and at the end of the study. Forty-four patients (21 B/23 A) were analyzed for resting blood pressures and 33 (15 B/18 A) for exercise blood pressure profile. At the end of the first month of treatment, a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in supine and upright systolic (SBP) and DBP was noted in both groups. The reduction in supine DBP after 4 weeks was significantly greater with B (p = 0.036). A further decrease of blood pressure was observed in both groups during the second month of treatment, which was significant only in supine SBP (p < 0.05). After 2 months, the heart rate decreased by 24% with B and 13% with A (B vs. A; p = 0.002). Regarding the BP profile during exercise, B and A caused a similar and significant reduction in both SBP and DBP (p < 0.001). The reduction in heart rate during exercise was more marked with B, with no significant difference between the two groups. Side effects were reported in three patients on B and six on A. Both at rest and during exercise, at a level of effort similar to that of daily activities, B exerted a hypotensive effect at least equivalent to that of A in mild and moderate hypertensive patients.", 
    "26": "Long-term efficacy and safety of the beta1-selective adrenoceptor-blocking agent bisoprolol was investigated in 164 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension who had already been treated successfully with bisoprolol once daily for 1 year in preceding studies. The good therapeutic effect of bisoprolol was maintained for another 1 or 2 years. There was no need for further dose adaptations, and the patients remained on their individually titrated dose. At the end of the third year, 22.6% of the patients required 5 mg or less, 63.7% needed 10 mg, and 13.7% of the patients required 20 mg. Four patients received a diuretic in addition to maintain a reasonable blood pressure reduction. Thirty-four of the 164 patients experienced adverse events, which necessitated a premature study withdrawal only in 2 cases. The repeatedly checked laboratory parameters did not adversely change under long-term treatment with bisoprolol up to 36 months. In particular, this also holds true for total cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood glucose.", 
    "27": "The objective of this study was to assess the electrophysiological properties of intravenous bisoprolol in patients with and without coronary artery disease (CAD) by programmed stimulation. Sixteen inpatients subjected to an electrophysiological investigation because of dizziness or palpitations were given 10 mg of intravenous bisoprolol after basal measurement and were checked again 15 and 45 min after infusion. Eight patients with CAD (seven males and one female; mean age of 60+/-4 years) and eight patients without CAD (five males and three females; mean age of 59+/-4 years) were investigated after washout of prior antiarrhythmic drugs. For coronary patients, the CAD was documented by a history of myocardial infarction or by a confirmatory coronary arteriography. Main outcome measures were parameters of invasive electrophysiological exploration, with measurement of conduction intervals at rest and during pacing and of refractory periods by means of extrastimulus technique. No significant difference was noted at baseline between the two groups except for CSNRT. After infusion of 10 mg of bisoprolol, with the exception of CSNRT (increased in the group without CAD), no significant differences were noted on comparison between coronary and noncoronary patients. Bisoprolol significantly increased the sinus cycle length, SACT, and FRP of the atria. Regarding atrioventricular nodal conduction, bisoprolol significantly increased the AH 100, ERP, and FRP and significantly decreased the Wenckebach point. In the right ventricle, bisoprolol moderately, but significantly, decreased the corrected QT and induced a small, temporary, significant increase in ERP. Bisoprolol appears to be a very potent beta-blocker that is well tolerated at an intravenous dose of 10 mg. Its depressant effects concern mainly the atrial function and the nodal conduction, without significant differences between the two groups of patients. The decrease in QTc may be a favorable aspect regarding its electrophysiologic tolerance especially in the acute phase of myocardial infarction.", 
    "28": "Many patients receiving bisoprolol treatment might also require warfarin or theophylline therapy. Two studies were carried out in healthy volunteers to investigate the possibility that bisoprolol might interact with warfarin or theophylline, both of which have low therapeutic ratios. In a balanced, two-way, crossover study, eight men and four women took bisoprolol 10 mg daily for 14 days. They were divided into two groups of six volunteers. On the tenth day of treatment, six subjects received theophylline 375 mg (Nuelin tablets) by mouth and the pharmacokinetics of theophylline were determined. After a washout period of 7 days, they also underwent determination of single-dose theophylline kinetics. The other six subjects had single-dose theophylline kinetics determined 7 days before the first dose of bisoprolol, and then again after 10 days of bisoprolol treatment. Concurrent administration of bisoprolol did not influence the tolerability of theophylline and had no significant effect on any of the pharmacokinetic parameters for theophylline. In a separate study, 12 healthy men received warfarin daily until their prothrombin times were about 1.5 x control. They then received bisoprolol 10 mg daily p.o. for 10 days; warfarin was continued until 5 days after the end of bisoprolol treatment. Bisoprolol and warfarin treatments were well tolerated, and there was no effect on prothrombin times of either starting or stopping bisoprolol treatment. These studies show no effect of bisoprolol treatment upon theophylline pharmacokinetics, and no evidence of an effect of bisoprolol upon low-level anticoagulation with warfarin. Nevertheless, care should always be taken when changes are made in the medication of patients receiving theophylline or warfarin.", 
    "29": "Approximately 40-50% of the patients with end-stage cardiac failure (either ischemic or nonischemic) die suddenly and unexpectedly, most probably from ventricular fibrillation. It is unclear whether the complex ventricular arrhythmias observed in large numbers of these patients were related to the mode of death. Theoretically, it seems quite reasonable to attempt to suppress the development of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) in those patients. If antiarrhythmic drug therapy is ineffective, alternative antiarrhythmic interventions (antiarrhythmic surgery or implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator) should be considered. In patients with so-called potentially malignant ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., nonsustained ventricular tachycardia), antiarrhythmic drug therapy remains controversial as presently there is no definitive proof that this therapy prolongs life or reduces the incidence of sudden cardiac death. In patients with end-stage cardiac failure, beta-blockade can result in a decrease in resting tachycardia, improvement in clinical heart failure symptoms, and increase in work load capacity. It remains controversial whether treatment with these agents can also improve prognosis and prevent sudden cardiac death. Therefore, at this time, only patients in the earlier stages of this clinical syndrome and with clinical signs of markedly increased sympathetic tone can be treated with low doses of beta-blockers.", 
    "30": "Both beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to cause left ventricular hypertrophy regression in hypertensive patients. So far, no study allowed a true comparison of these drugs in this regard. Therefore, 56 hypertensive patients (38 newly recognized and 18 without any antihypertensive drugs for more than 2 months, mean of 9.5+/-14 months) were randomized to enalapril (En, n = 30) or a beta-blocker, bisoprolol (Bi, n = 26), once daily and underwent before and after 2 and 6 months on treatment (a) office and 24-h ambulatory monitoring of BP, (b) M-mode echo assessment of left ventricular mass (LVM) index and fractional shortening (FS), and (c) Doppler evaluation of left ventricular filling. All recordings were read blindly by two observers. The intraobserver coefficient of variation of LVM was 9%. After 6 months, office BP (146+/-18/90+/-10 vs. 170+/-14/104+/-8 mm Hg) and 24-h BP(120+/-17/77+/-9 vs. 138+/-15/90+/-9 mm Hg) were similarly reduced with both drugs. The LVM index was significantly reduced (p < 0.001) (Bi, 11%; En, 7%) and FS was unchanged. The early to late diastolic left ventricular flow ratio (E/A) was increased with bisoprolol (1.06+/-0.29 vs. 0.85+/-0.17, p < 0.0001) but not with enalapril (0.95+/-0.24 vs. 0.88+/-0.34), but this was mainly due to heart rate reduction with bisoprolol. We found no correlation between the reductions in 24-h BP and in LVM index. Bisoprolol and enalapril were similarly effective in lowering blood pressure (BP) in the office and during 24-h monitoring and in reducing the left ventricular mass index in hypertensive patients.", 
    "31": "Positive inotropic stimulation of the failing cardiac muscle seems to be useful, if certain requirements are met: (a) there is some cardiac contractile reserve left, (b) the positive inotropic agent of choice is able to mobilize this contractile reserve, and (c) peripheral vascular resistance is not increased permanently by this agent. On the other hand, the physiological response (i.e., positive inotropic effect) to circulating catecholamines in heart failure is decreased or even absent due to receptor desensitization and an alteration of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (increased Gi). It has been proved that functionally active beta-adrenoceptors may be restored by treatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. However, these agents necessarily will have negative inotropic effects in the failing cardiac muscle, if the force of contraction is largely dependent on a permanent stimulation by catecholamines and if there are no spare beta-adrenoceptors. To clarify these as-yet unresolved problems, we have determined the contractile reserve as well as its utilization by positive inotropic agents in human cardiac muscles of failing and nonfailing hearts. The number and functional activity of cardiac glycoside receptors, beta-adrenoceptors, and alpha-adrenoceptors were measured as well as the positive inotropic and negative inotropic effects of partial agonists. Furthermore, we have accumulated evidence that, in fact, there are no spare beta-adrenoceptors in the human cardiac muscle. The lack of spare beta-adrenoceptors has consequences for the therapeutic approach in patients with heart failure. At least initially, the administration of beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agents to patients with heart failure depending on agonist-induced stimulation will lead to a worsening of cardiac function. If this situation can be tolerated, however, the subsequent restoration of functionally active beta-adrenoceptors after beta-blockade may lead to restored physiological regulation of force of contraction by norepinephrine.", 
    "32": "Substantial evidence has accumulated that in the human heart both beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors coexist. As a rule, the amount of beta2-adrenoceptors is higher in the atria (about 30% of the total beta-adrenoceptor population) than in the ventricular myocardium (about 20%). Both beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors couple to adenylate cyclase and mediate positive inotropic effects of isoproterenol and epinephrine on isolated, electrically driven cardiac preparations. In the atria, stimulation of both beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors causes maximal increases in contractile force; in the ventricular myocardium, however, only beta1-adrenoceptor stimulation maximally increases contractile force, whereas beta2-adrenoceptor stimulation evokes only submaximal increases. On the other hand, norepinephrine induces its positive inotropic effect on atrial and ventricular preparations solely via beta1-adrenoceptor stimulation. Because norepinephrine is the main transmitter of the human sympathetic nervous system, this indicates that under normal physiological conditions, the heart rate and contractility are under the control of cardiac beta1-adrenoceptors, whereas cardiac beta2-adrenoceptors play only a minor role, if at all. However, in situations of stress, when large amounts of epinephrine (acting at both beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors with the same affinity) are released from the adrenal medulla, activation of cardiac beta2-adrenoceptors may contribute to an additional increase in heart rate and/or contractility. In chronic heart failure, cardiac beta-adrenoceptor function decreases (presumably due to endogenous \"downregulation\" by the elevated catecholamines), and this decrease is related to the severity of the disease (judged clinically by NYHA functional class). However, cardiac beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors seem to be differentially affected in different kinds of heart failure: in end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy, beta1-adrenoceptors selectively decrease, whereas beta2-adrenoceptors are nearly normal. Under these (pathological) conditions, beta2-adrenoceptors may substitute for the loss in beta1-adrenoceptors, thereby maintaining contractility, at least partially. On the other hand, in end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy, tetralogy of Fallot, and mitral valve disease, both beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors concomitantly decrease. The reason for this differential regulation of cardiac beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors in different forms of heart failure remains to be elucidated.", 
    "33": "Heart failure is characterized by the inability of the myocardium to shorten sufficiently or to eject an adequate stroke volume to maintain normal perfusion of both the cardiac and the extracardiac organs. Irrespective of etiologic reasons, the depression of myocardial contractility represents one of the major mechanisms that contributes to low output in heart failure. Despite their intrinsic negative inotropic effects, beta-receptor-blocking agents have been used in numerous studies for treating the failing heart, especially in dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic heart disease. In this regard, specific therapeutic aims of the use of beta-receptor-blocking agents in chronic heart failure have been described. e.g., reduction of an increased heart rate in tachycardia, blood pressure reduction in hypertensive heart failure, improvement of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, depression of an increased sympathetic tone (e.g., in hyperthyrioidism, pheochromocytoma), increase in the amount of downregulated beta-receptors, and anti-ischemic effects in coronary artery disease. For chronic heart failure, therefore, some special indications may be established and may be individually used; for acute heart failure, only very rare indications are present (e.g., hypertensive crisis, life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias). The actual rationale for the use of beta-receptor blocking agents in heart failure is therefore analyzed with regard to pathophysiology, clinical effects, and clinical outcome of treated patients.", 
    "34": "In stable exercise-induced angina pectoris, beta-blockers exert their beneficial effects mainly through a reduction in heart rate, blood pressure. and contractility. Additional beneficial effects are an improvement in myocardial oxygen supply through a redistribution of coronary flow, a lengthening of diastole, a facilitation of aerobic metabolism, and a rightward shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. Cardioselective beta-blockers can be expected to have fewer side effects than the nonselective drugs. Apart from a reduction in anginal attack rate and an improvement in exercise capacity, a reduction in silent ischemia may be desirable when treating patients with stable effort angina, beta-blockers effectively reduce asymptomatic ischemia. Bisoprolol is a new beta1-selective beta-blocker with a clear 24-h duration of action regarding symptoms and improvement of exercise capacity in patients with stable exercise-induced angina pectoris. Bisoprolol 10 mg and atenolol 100 mg are equipotent in achieving these effects.", 
    "35": "The classical approach to the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (MI) has been one of stabilization and complication management. In an effort to optimize treatment, the initiation of the cardiac care unit and the use of antiarrhythmic therapy have succeeded in lowering the mortality rate substantially. More modern concepts are aimed at limiting infarct size and preserving myocardial function. These aims can be achieved medically using intravenous (i.v.) thrombolysis or invasively either with intracoronary (i.c.) thrombolysis, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), or bypass surgery. Although i.c. thrombolysis is more effective than the i.v. route, the necessity for acute coronary catheterization makes it incompatible and difficult for routine use, and thus is usually reserved for cases in which i.v. lysis has failed. Intravenous thrombolysis is becoming the standard approach to MI, and the remaining questions are those of which drug and dosage are optimal and how to approach the patient after thrombolysis. In this regard, we favor a symptom-guided approach, as shown by the TIMI-IIA and European cooperative studies. In patients with ongoing ischemia postlysis, heart catheterization is indicated and a decision regarding PTCA or surgery is then made, depending on anatomy. In patients remaining stable after acute lysis, a predischarge stress may help in selecting patients requiring catheterization. As an alternative invasive approach to acute MI, PTCA may be the quickest and most effective method to recanalize a vessel, but, again, logistical problems make it incompatible in the acute setting. The same is true for bypass surgery, and although extensive improvements have been made in intraoperative myocardial preservation so that a 2% mortality is achievable, it is reserved for patients with extensive ischemia and anatomy unsuitable for PTCA (extensive multivessel or left main disease).", 
    "36": "Streptokinase, APSAC, and rtPA clearly reduce mortality in acute myocardial infarction. rtPA is definitely superior at recanalization; it does it faster and more effectively in the first 1-2 h after infusion. There is no evidence that it causes less bleeding, but rather that the proneness to bleeding might be a little higher. rtPA is expensive. Therefore, on the whole, physicians in the United Kingdom mainly use streptokinase and some APSAC. rtPA is probably the best agent for second-time use within 6-12 months of the first use of streptokinase or APSAC, when antibodies may limit the effectiveness of these agents. Aspirin is clearly useful, and one should remember to use it long term in any patient who has had a vascular event. It should not be used for primary prevention except where there is a clear vascular risk. For secondary prevention, it is very effective. Intravenous beta-blockers should be considered for less ill patients, who amount to about 50% of all patients admitted. Beta-blocker treatment reduces cardiac rupture and should be used in conjunction with thrombolysis and continued long term in patients without contraindications. It also has proven antiarrhythmic benefit (sudden death). Anticoagulants are promising but yet to be proven. Nitrates may have a place in the acute therapy of myocardial infarction, but calcium blockers and lidocaine are definitely not suited for routine use. Lidocaine should generally be used only in patients who already have ventricular fibrillation or severe or symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia. Finally, before getting too enthusiastic, one should remember that this overview deals only with those people who reach the hospital alive. There is a huge number of patients at least equal to those admitted who die before reaching medical help. They have to be prevented from getting a myocardial infarction. Therefore, along with better treatment, we need to focus on prevention, with arguments against smoking, excess weight, and in favor of more exercise. These arguments are still very important.", 
    "37": "We investigated 150 unselected patients with proven coronary artery disease. All patients were off all routine antianginal treatments and there were 598 ischemic episodes, of which 75% were silent. It was found that episodes of ischemia, both silent and painful, occurred predominantly during the daytime hours from 0730 to 1930 h. This pattern is similar to that described by others. There was a significant excess of episodes of ischemia in the morning hours (0730-1330 h), with a secondary peak occurring in the evening hours. We further investigated a subgroup of 41 patients who were monitored for 1,581 h while being treated with atenolol. These patients were investigated in a double-blind fashion, and during the off treatment phase the circadian pattern of ischemic episodes was similar to that described for the group as a whole. However, on treatment with atenolol, there was a significant reduction in the frequency and total duration of ischemic episodes throughout the day. Atenolol significantly altered the circadian distribution of ischemic episodes with elimination of the morning peak; there was some preservation of the evening peak although this was smaller than that described when the patients were off therapy. The circadian distribution of ischemic episodes and the observed changes with beta-blocking treatment resemble the reported circadian variation of acute myocardial infarction and sudden death. Although these studies do not in any way prove that myocardial ischemic episodes and their alteration by treatment are related to the development of acute myocardial infarction and death, the relationship between ischemic episodes and the end points of coronary disease require further investigation.", 
    "38": "Beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs (BABs) have a firm place in the therapy of cardiovascular conditions including angina and hypertension. Although all BABs are competitive inhibitors of beta-receptors, they may differ in their additional pharmacodynamics, i.e., beta1-(cardio)selectivity, partial agonistic activity (PAA), and pharmacokinetic properties. Understanding these additional properties would allow the physician to choose the more appropriate agent for some patients or for specific situations. beta1-Selective BABs may be of potential importance in patients with obstructive airway disease, peripheral vascular disease, and hyperlipidemia and in diabetic patients receiving antidiabetic drugs. These BABs may better control the increased blood pressure in response to hypoglycemia, exercise, or cigarette smoking. Nonselective BABs may be preferably used to decrease epinephrine-induced hypokalemia or to prevent myocardial infarction, and in certain circumstances (i.e., migraine, anxiety, thyrotoxicosis or essential tremor). BABs with PAA may theoretically cause a lesser degree of cardiodepression (reduction of heart rate at rest, cardiac output, and AV conduction), bronchospasm, and peripheral vasoconstriction and minor effects on plasma lipids. Withdrawal syndrome may be absent after BABs with PAA. The pharmacokinetic properties of the BABs such as absorption, bioavailability, elimination half-life, liver metabolization, interindividual variability, as well as pharmacological interactions depend on their hydrophilic/lipophilic ratio. The development of new BABs continues. It has been possible to incorporate into a drug molecule combinations of PAA, preferred beta1-blockade, and beta2-agonist activity. Even if these new agents cause less adverse effects (e.g., vasoconstriction, bronchospasm), their clinical significance remains to be established.", 
    "39": "All clinically used beta-blockers share the common feature of being competitive antagonists at beta-adrenoceptors. They differ, however, in additional pharmacological properties, such as beta1/beta2-selectivity ratios, presence or absence of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), and/or local anesthetic activity. Furthermore, beta-blockers differ widely in their pharmacokinetic properties. The mammalian beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors are the products of different genes but the receptor proteins show a certain degree of homology. Both span the cell membrane seven times. The cytoplasmic part of the receptor protein is the site of phosphorylations and hence involved in the process of receptor internalization. Upon exposure of tissues or organs to beta-blockers, characteristic changes emerge at the cellular level. There is an increase in the density of beta-adrenoceptors in the surface membrane, termed upregulation. This upregulation is subtype-specific, i.e., nonselective beta-blockers increase the density of both beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors whereas beta1-selective antagonists upregulate only the former subtype. In contrast, beta-blockers with pronounced ISA downregulate beta-adrenoceptors. Beta-adrenoceptor density also changes in pathological situations. There is a downregulation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors in dilated cardiomyopathy, probably as a consequence of increased sympathetic tone. A rapid upregulation of beta-adrenoceptors is characteristic of myocardial ischemia. This upregulation occurs in spite of a massive release of norepinephrine from cardiac adrenergic nerves during ischemia. Both norepinephrine release and upregulation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors lead to an adrenergic overstimulation of ischemic myocardium. Blockade of beta-adrenoceptors inhibits the catecholamine component of this vicious circle and may explain part of the beneficial effects of beta-blockers in coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction.", 
    "40": "Controlled studies of the electrophysiological effects of beta-blockade in acute myocardial infarction have not previously been published. In this controlled, double-blind study 20 patients were randomized to treatment with placebo or sotalol administered as a continuous infusion for 12 h. Programmed electrical stimulation was performed from the right atrium. After 60 min of infusion in the sotalol-treated patients (n = 10) there was a significant prolongation of sinus cycle length (+15%) and sinus node recovery time (+28%). The AV nodal effective refractory period was prolonged by 15% after 45 min of infusion. Variables reflecting myocardial repolarization, atrial effective refractory period and QT interval, were increased by 20% and 10%, respectively. In the placebo group, except at 12 h, there was a general pattern of slightly diminishing values for all measured variables. The electrophysiological changes in the sotalol-treated group could be explained by the combined Class II and III activities of this drug. The infusion of sotalol was well tolerated, and the anticipated electrophysiological and Class II and III antiarrhythmic effects were observed, despite the acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "41": "Once-daily administration of perindopril 4mg has been compared with captopril 25mg twice daily, atenolol 50mg once daily or a combination of hydrochlorothiazide 50mg plus amiloride 5mg once daily in double-blind studies of patients with supine diastolic blood pressures between 95 and 125mm Hg. After 3 months' treatment, the average decrease in supine systolic blood pressure with perindopril (26.5mm Hg) was significantly greater than that obtained with captopril (18.9mm Hg) and atenolol (20.6mm Hg), and non-significantly different from that achieved with the diuretic combination (30.6mm Hg). Perindopril reduced diastolic blood pressure by a greater extent than captopril (18.1 vs 11.7mm Hg), whereas the reductions were similar when compared with atenolol (17.4 vs 15.6mm Hg) and the diuretics (19.1 vs 18.4mm Hg). Target blood pressure (supine diastolic less than or equal to 90mm Hg) was achieved in 49 to 72% of patients on perindopril 4 mg/day and in an additional 15% of patients by doubling the dosage. In patients on perindopril who required an additional antihypertensive agent, a diuretic was more effective than a beta-blocker. Withdrawal rates due to adverse effects were similar in all treatment groups and ranged between 4 and 6%. Perindopril was well tolerated. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that perindopril may be considered as a suitable first-line treatment for mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "42": "In the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT), 3837 patients were randomized to propranolol (180-240 mg/day) or placebo 5-21 days after a documented myocardial infarction and were followed in a double blind manner for a mean period of 25 months. Twelve lead electrocardiograms were routinely obtained at the time of randomization (baseline electrocardiogram) and at 12 and 24 months of follow-up. There was a positive correlation between baseline QTc interval prolongation (but not QT prolongation) and mortality and sudden death that was independent of treatment group. The data for non-sudden death and non-fatal reinfarction exhibit similar trends. We conclude that: (1) QTc prolongation identifies a high risk subset of post myocardial infarction patients. (2) The relative benefit of propranolol is similar in patients with normal and prolonged QTc.", 
    "43": "Left ventricular diastolic filling was investigated in 12 black and 15 white subjects before and after double-blinded randomized treatment of mild to moderate hypertension with combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade (labetalol) and beta-blockade alone (atenolol). At baseline (off medication), both groups were similar for age (46 +/- 8 years v 48 +/- 12 years), mean blood pressure (121 +/- 8 mm Hg v 115 +/- 8 mm Hg), left ventricular dimensions, left ventricular mass index (118 +/- 24 g/m2 v 113 +/- 13 g/m2), and left ventricular filling as reflected by transmitral flow velocity ratio A/E (0.97 +/- 0.33 v 0.92 +/- 0.19, normal age-matched control A/E ratio is 0.64 +/- 14). There were 6 blacks and 6 whites in the labetalol group; 6 blacks and 9 whites in the atenolol group. At six weeks of treatment, whites in the labetalol group showed a significantly greater drop in mean blood pressure (114 +/- 7/102 +/- 11, P less than .007 v 123 +/- 9/114 +/- 11, P = NS) and correspondingly greater improvement in A/E ratio (1.04 +/- 0.14/0.74 +/- 0.23, P less than .024 v 1.02 +/- 0.23/0.89 +/- 0.16, P = NS). However, this difference was no longer significant when controlling for age and blood pressure level. In the atenolol group, whites showed a significant increase in the rapid filling phase velocity E, while late filling phase velocity A significantly dropped only in blacks, without significant improvement in A/E ratio in either subgroup. In conclusion, greater improvement in left ventricular filling is seen with combined alpha-beta-blockade than beta-blockade alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "In a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study with a single-blind placebo run-in period a new controlled-release (CR) formulation of metoprolol 200 mg once daily was compared with atenolol tablets 100 mg once daily in 22 patients (age 60.9 +/- 0.93 (SE) years) with primary hypertension and impaired or diabetic glucose tolerance. Each period lasted for three weeks. The two agents produced similar blood pressure 3 h as well as 24 h after drug intake. Three hours after drug intake, heart rate was lower on atenolol than metoprolol CR treatment, indicating a higher degree of beta-receptor blockade for atenolol at this point in time, when the plasma concentration of atenolol was most likely to be close to its peak. Concentrations of blood glucose, serum insulin, and serum C-peptide in the fasting state or after an oral glucose load did not differ between the active agents. HbA1c was marginally, but significantly, lower on atenolol than metoprolol CR treatment. No differences were found in serum levels of total, low density lipoprotein (LDL), and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or apoA-I, and apoB lipoproteins or triglycerides. In comparison to the placebo run-in period, both agents showed an unexpected improvement in glucose tolerance, a decrease in HDL cholesterol and for metoprolol CR a small, but significant decrease in LDL cholesterol. Thus, treatment with metoprolol CR tablets producing even plasma levels without high peak concentrations and conventional atenolol treatment had similar effects on metabolic control in hypertensive men and abnormal glucose tolerance.", 
    "45": "A double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, rising-dose, single-dose study was undertaken to assess the effect of low concentrations of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution (0.008%, 0.025%, 0.08%, and 0.25%) on intraocular pressure and its diurnal variation in healthy, normal volunteers. A single dose of 0.008% timolol exhibits a definite but minimal-effect on intraocular pressure in this normal volunteer model, causing a significant peak mean decrease in intraocular pressure from its value immediately predose. This decrease was 1.8 mm Hg (a peak mean percent decrease of 12.8%) at 2 hours postdose compared with an increase of 0.1 mm Hg (+2.5%) during a pre-study curve due to normal diurnal variation. One drop of 0.008% solution represents a single dose of approximately 2.5 micrograms of timolol. A slight contralateral ocular hypotensive effect appears to be present for 0.25% timolol at 2 hours postdose although it just failed to reach statistical significance.", 
    "46": "The blood flow in esophageal varices was measured by endoscopic laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) in 27 patients histologically or clinically diagnosed as having liver cirrhosis. The effect of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS), and of intravenous oral administration of propranolol, on the output signal of LDV was evaluated. EIS was performed intravariceally after the measurement, with a 50% glucose solution, human thrombin (1000 U), and Aethoxysclerol as sclerosants.", 
    "47": "Four men with paruresis received trials of atenolol or phenelzine or both. Atenolol was effective in one patient. Three patients had a poor response to phenelzine, and they all experienced troublesome side effects.", 
    "48": "A double-blind controlled study of long-acting propranolol in the secondary prevention of variceal hemorrhage was conducted in 81 cirrhotic patients. After the index hemorrhage, all patients were treated with injection sclerotherapy on one occasion to secure hemostasis and then randomized within 72 h to propranolol or placebo therapy which was continued for 2 yr. Study endpoints were severe recurrence of variceal hemorrhage or death. Forty-two patients did not fulfill the entry criteria for the study. Thirty-eight patients received propranolol of whom 18 (47%) had further hemorrhage, 14 died, eight had side-effects (2 withdrawals), and 3 did not complete follow-up. Forty-three patients received placebo of whom 33 (77%) had further hemorrhage, 19 died, 5 had side-effects (2 withdrawals), and 5 failed to complete follow-up. The median time from onset of hemorrhage to starting drug therapy was 6 days for both groups. Life table analysis showed an equivalent incidence of further hemorrhage in both groups over the first 60 days, following which the propranolol group did consistently better than the placebo group. There was a significantly lower incidence of rebleeding in modified Child's C patients receiving propranolol (39%) than those on placebo (90%). No statistically significant effect on mortality was seen. In this study, propranolol reduced the incidence of late recurrence of variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis.", 
    "49": "Monotherapy of hypertension with acebutolol in diabetics in daily dose of 200-400 mg for 6 weeks induced only non-significant and practically not acceptable hypotensive effect in groups of patients with hypertension and diabetes type I or type II without nephropathy. No therapeutical effect was observed in hypertension in diabetics type I with nephropathy. Administration of acebutolol to hypertensive diabetic patients with nephropathy resulted in tendency to increase in albuminuria. Values of creatinine clearance did not change at the same time. Also no effect of acebutolol on glycemic or lipid indices was observed. The lack of clear hypotensive effect under studied conditions of acebutolol in diabetic patients contrasted with its significant action in comparative group of hypertensive non-diabetic subjects.", 
    "50": "This study in sixty healthy volunteers investigated the effect of a single drop of either 0.5% timolol ophthalmic solution, 0.5% betaxolol ophthalmic solution, or placebo on corneal sensitivity as measured by the Cochet-Bonnet anesthesiometer. Corneal sensitivity was measured immediately prior to the drop and then 1, 3, 6, 10, 15 and 30 minutes after drop instillation. The timolol treated eyes showed a significant decrease at one minute after instillation. An increase in sensitivity occurred in the placebo group at 15 and 30 minutes. In the eyes treated with betaxolol, a significant reduction in corneal sensitivity was seen at every time point through the 10-minute measurement.", 
    "51": "In a double-masked, short-term study on 12 healthy elderly volunteers, angioscotomas and contrast sensitivities were measured 2 h after treatment with placebo, pindolol 1% and timolol 0.5%. In perimetry, angioscotomas did neither change in deepness nor in diameter significantly. However, the mean differential light sensitivity was highest with timolol (15.5 dB) and lower with pindolol (15.2 dB p less than 0.018) and placebo (15.0 dB; p less than 0.004). In contrast sensitivity testings, the mean contrast sensitivity was lowest with timolol (15.0 dB) and higher with pindolol (15.3 dB p less than 0.001) and placebo (15.7 dB; p less than 0.001). The differences between pindolol and placebo were not significant in both tests. The contrasting results may be explained by the locations where retinal sensitivity was tested, near or far from retinal vessels i.e. foveally or near the blind spot. Pharmacologically, the main difference between the two medications is the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of pindolol.", 
    "52": "An effective and well-tolerated transdermal beta-adrenergic blocker that could be applied once weekly would facilitate compliance. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a once-weekly formulation of transdermal timolol, a beta-blocker, were evaluated in healthy males. One (n = 6), two (n = 5), and three (n = 5) patches (97.5 mg base/12.58 cm2 patch) were applied at weekly intervals to the subjects' inner arm for 48 hours (part A) and two patches were applied for 7 days (part B). In part A, mean exercise (bicycle ergometry) heart rate (beats/min, bpm) was suppressed from baseline at 48 hours after the patch (p less than 0.05) in each case (1 patch 167 vs 131 bpm; 2 patches 165 vs 120 bpm; 3 patches 159 vs 120 bpm). Mean plasma timolol concentrations at 48 hours after the patch for one, two, and three patches were 5, 11, and 14 ng/ml, respectively. For part B, mean exercise heart rate at baseline, 24, and 168 hours was 161, 113, and 130 bpm (p less than 0.05), and mean plasma timolol concentrations at these times were 0, 23, and 4 ng/ml. The relationship between suppression of exercise heart rate and plasma timolol concentrations within subjects was well described by an inhibitory EMAX model, where EMAX ranged from a suppression of 42-65 bpm associated with a 50% inhibitory (IC50) concentration that ranged from 2-4 ng/ml. Transdermal timolol was associated with significant beta blockade for up to 7 days, and caused only minimal skin irritation.", 
    "53": "Nine hundred and thirty-nine patients with moderate to severe hypertension, observed for up to 10 years, were found to benefit from treatment with the beta1-selective agent atenolol (Tenormin), usually coprescribed with diuretics with or without vasodilators or other agents. Therapy was well tolerated, particularly when the dose of atenolol was not increased to above 100 mg/day. Left ventricular hypertrophy was reversed. Stroke mortality was reduced by about 50% from that predicted had the high blood pressure (BP) not been treated. Good control of systolic blood pressure (SBP) resulted in a reduction of total mortality and death from myocardial infarction (MI) of 40-45%, to achieve a rate similar to that on a local tolerance population (age- and sex-matched). Although treated SBP was positively correlated with significantly fewer deaths from MI and stroke, a treated SBP of less than 140 mmHg in the elderly may be associated with an increase in mortality rate from stroke. A J-curve relationship between treated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and death from MI in hypertensive patients with accompanying overt ischaemic heart disease indicates that a treated DBP of less that about 85 mmHg is associated with an increased death rate from MI in such patients. It is therefore concluded that good control of moderate/severe hypertension significantly decreases death rate from stroke and MI. However, it is recommended that for hypertensives with co-existent overt ischaemic heart disease DBP should not be lowered to less than about 85 mmHg and, in the elderly, SBP probably should not be lowered to less than about 140 mmHg.", 
    "54": "Based on data from neurophysiological studies, the author checked the action of a beta-blocking agent facilitating spontaneous stone passage from the ureter. Experience has shown that, compared with the control group, the beta-receptor-blocking agents proved to be useful in the facilitation of a spontaneous discharge of stones located in the lower part of the ureter.", 
    "55": "The pharmacokinetics of oral and i.v. propafenone and its major metabolites have been investigated in 8 healthy subjects. The total body clearance of propafenone was 963 ml/min, the terminal half-life 198 min and its absolute bioavailability was 15.5%. The two active metabolites (5-hydroxypropafenone and N-depropylpropafenone) showed non-linear kinetics in that both the dose-corrected area under the serum concentration-time curve and the amount excreted in the urine were larger after oral dosing. This resulted in considerably higher serum concentrations of the metabolites despite comparable serum concentrations of the parent compound. Thus, the concentration-effect relationship in the same patient may differ after oral and intravenous doses if concentrations of the active metabolite(s) are not taken into consideration. Although the mechanism of the nonlinearity is not clear, the data indicate that it may be due to saturable biliary excretion of the metabolites.", 
    "56": "Betaxolol levels in blood were monitored in the perinatal period in 28 pregnant hypertensive women and in their babies. In the mothers betaxolol concentrations at delivery ranged from less than 1 to 115 ng.ml-1 after doses of 10 to 40 mg.day-1. The apparent blood half-life was 15.6 to 22.1 h mean (19 h). Umbilical cord levels indicated a rapid equilibrium between fetal and maternal units (ratio 0.93) within few hours after dosing. Milk betaxolol concentrations, measured in few cases, exceeded those in blood by a factor of 3. Amniotic fluid concentrations were similar to those observed in maternal venous blood and umbilical cord blood. In neonates, the blood betaxolol half-life ranged from 14.8 to 38.5 h, with a definite trend towards a negative correlation with gestational age. A 11-61% rise in the betaxolol concentration was observed in 64% of the neonates during the first 12 h of extrauterine life. The data indicate that betaxolol kinetics is not altered in pregnant women and they stress the need for careful and prolonged (72-96 h) intensive monitoring of neonates born to hypertensive mothers treated with beta-blocking agents.", 
    "57": "Mechanisms and variations in the food-induced increase in the bioavailability of propranolol were assessed by single-dose (80 mg) studies in healthy volunteers who took the drug on an empty stomach, immediately after a protein-rich breakfast, and together with a carbohydrate-rich, protein-poor breakfast. Concomitant intake of the protein-rich, but not the carbohydrate-rich, protein-poor breakfast, increased the bioavailability of propranolol in most, but not all, subjects. The food (protein) effect displayed much inter-individual variation, from a decrease to a 250% increase, which could be explained, at least in part, by a correlation between the oral clearance of propranolol and the food-induced increase in its bioavailability. The food effect was not associated with decreased total availability, but with delayed appearance, of the oxidative metabolites 4-OHP, NLA and PG. Hence the food (protein) effect does not seem to be caused by enzyme inhibition, but rather it is due to reduced hepatic extraction of propranolol, probably consequent to an increase hepatic entry rate. When taken together with the protein-rich breakfast, propranolol usually appeared in systemic blood at least as early as when taken on an empty stomach, implying that gastric absorption of propranolol may be possible in the presence of protein-rich food. Within the individual the food effect was reproducible, but its magnitude showed an intraindividual variation that may reflect its dependence upon the rates of gastrointestinal absorption and splanchnic-hepatic blood flow, and hence upon the rate of hepatic drug entry.", 
    "58": "The pharmacokinetics of d-sotalol has been studied in six healthy volunteers given single doses of 0.25, 0.50, 1, 2 mg.kg-1 i.v. and one 100 mg oral dose in comparison with the kinetics of 1 mg.kg-1 i.v. of dl-sotalol. There was no significant difference in the disposition of the d-enantiomer and the racemate. The terminal half-life averaged 7.2 h, and the kinetics was linear, with a mean total clearance of 0.13 l.h-1.kg-1. Renal clearance of d-sotalol represented 56 to 77% of total clearance. The absolute systemic availability of oral d-sotalol was close to 100% and the elimination half-life of the oral-d-enantiomer was similar to that of the i.v. form (7.5 h).", 
    "59": "In a double-blind, randomised, cross-over study, the pharmacokinetic/dynamic effects and subjective symptoms of a new controlled-release (CR) formulation of metoprolol (50 and 100 mg) have been compared with atenolol (50 mg) and placebo in 20 elderly healthy subjects. The metoprolol CR formulation displayed an even plasma concentration-time profile over the dosage interval while atenolol produced a peak at 2-4 h. All three active treatments produced significant beta 1-blockade at 24 h compared to placebo. Four hours after dose intake, the degree of beta 1-blockade was significantly greater with conventional atenolol 50 mg than with either dose of metoprolol CR. Subjective well-being was examined with a self-administered questionnaire (MSE-profile), including three dimensions: Contentment, Vitality and Sleep. No significant differences were detected between placebo and either dose of metoprolol CR. At 2 h, following atenolol, a deterioration in Vitality was observed compared to placebo and metoprolol CR 100 mg. At the end of the dosage interval there was no longer any significant difference between the treatments. Perceived leg fatigue during exercise, evaluated 4 h after dosing, was more pronounced during treatment with atenolol than metoprolol CR 50 mg. The results suggest that the metoprolol CR formulation was not associated with significant effects on subjective well-being, whereas atenolol caused a deterioration at the time of the peak plasma concentration of the drug.", 
    "60": "Many drugs are known to affect salivary secretion. The purpose of this study was to explore the chronic effects of a commonly used beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol. Adult rats were desalivated or treated for 28 days with propranolol HCl (10 or 20 mg/kg, daily) or sterile buffer (sham-operated control) using osmotic pumps for delivery. The parotid and submandibular glands of each rat were cannulated and secretion elicited by pilocarpine (10 mg/kg, intravenous). There were no statistical differences in salivary protein content (Lowry) or output among the groups (ANOVA, p greater than 0.05). Analysis of salivary proteins by SDS-PAGE revealed a constant profile for submandibular secretions, but peak A and SP-3 proline-rich proteins were not detectable in parotid saliva of animals treated with propranolol for the entire experiment. Significantly increased smooth-surface (p = 0.0003) and sulcal (p = 0.0011) caries scores were found within these propranolol groups (ANOVA). The findings provide further evidence that chronic administration of propranolol alters salivary composition by decreasing proline-rich proteins and concurrently enhances susceptibility to caries.", 
    "61": "This article introduces child and adolescent psychiatric nurses to the use of propranolol for aggression in children and adolescents. The use of propranolol is relatively new in the area of psychiatry. A retrospective chart review of patients who had received propranolol was conducted in an intermediate care hospital. Case illustrations are presented.", 
    "62": "We have studied the influence of left atrial receptor stimulation on arterial baroreflex control of heart rate with a view to determine the role of cardiac efferent sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways in any interaction observed. Experiments were performed on anaesthetized, artificially ventilated, and thoracotomised cats and dogs. The sensitivity of baroreflex heart rate response was found to be higher in dogs as compared to cats. Both the sympathetic and parasympathetic effects contributed to the reflex chronotropic effects observed during changes in mean arterial blood pressure. The reflex tachycardia response during left atrial receptor stimulation was more pronounced in dogs than in cats. Stimulation of left atrial receptors caused slight inhibition of the baroreflex tachycardia response and potentiation of the bradycardia response.", 
    "63": "The effects of electrical stimulation of cervical sympathetic trunks for 1-min duration at supramaximal intensity with various stimulus frequencies on local cortical cerebral blood flow were investigated in urethane-anesthetized rats. Electrical stimulation with low frequency (1-2 Hz) produced a significant increase in local cortical cerebral blood flow during the stimulation. The local cortical CBF reached 111% of the resting value during the stimulation at 10 Hz, and slightly decreased for about 30s after the end of stimulation. High-frequency stimulation (20-30 Hz) produced the short-term increase during the stimulation, which was followed by the dominant and long-lasting decrease, and the local cortical CBF reached 87% (at 30 Hz) of the resting value after the end of stimulation. The response of increase in flow was abolished by intravenous administration of beta adrenergic blocking agent (propranolol, 1.3 mg/kg i.v.), while the response of decrease in flow was abolished by alpha adrenergic blocking agent (phenoxybenzamine, 0.5 mg/kg i.v.).", 
    "64": "The effect of chlorhexidine acetate on the corneal penetration of sorbitol was evaluated in vitro using the enucleated pigmented rabbit cornea mounted in a modified Ussing chamber. Sorbitol penetrated the cornea poorly when compared with arnolol, a beta blocker. Sorbitol penetration was improved 85% by 0.01% chlorhexidine acetate, 2.9 times by 0.1% EDTA, and 9.6 times by stripping the corneal epithelium prior to the start of the experiment. By comparison, 0.01% chlorhexidine acetate and stripping the corneal epithelium improved the corneal penetration of arnolol only 30% and 74%, respectively, whereas stripping the corneal epithelium did not affect the corneal penetration of chlorhexidine acetate. Collectively, the above findings indicate that changes in corneal integrity may dramatically affect the corneal penetration of some inert excipients in ophthalmic formulations. Such a possibility must be considered carefully in the selection of excipients.", 
    "65": "Effects of D-timolol and L-timolol on IOP were compared with two rabbit models. When the drug solution was injected into vortex vein, 1% D-timolol produced ocular hypotension just like 0.5% L-timolol except D-timolol was less potent than L-timolol to lower the IOP. On the other hand, when 0.5% of D-timolol and L-timolol were instilled into the rabbit eye on IOP recovery model both agents showed equipotency to delayed the IOP recovery. Effects of D-timolol and L-timolol on ocular blood flow were also studied with two rabbit models. D-Timolol at 0.5% did not affect the ocular pulsatile blood flow measured with Langham's pneumatonometer whereas 0.5% L-timolol significantly suppressed it. D-Timolol (0.5%) was found to increase retinal and choroidal blood flows measured with laser Doppler method whereas L-timolol suppressed it. These results indicate that D-timolol though less potent than L-timolol to lower IOP, is superior over L-timolol to improve the blood flow in retina and choroid.", 
    "66": "The effect of pretreatment with clonidine, methyldopa and propranolol, and of atropine was studied in mice on acute toxicity of fenitrothion, the active ingredient of TIK-20. Atropine significantly decreased and propranolol somewhat decreased the fenitrothion induced death in mice. Clonidine and methyldopa somewhat increased the percentage mortality due to fenitrothion.", 
    "67": "A 74 year-old man, a known asthmatic since 1972, was treated by timolol eye-drop for acute glaucoma. Several hours later the patient developed a severe attack of asthma, and died subsequently. The autopsy findings were consistent with those of typical status asthmaticus. Our patient is, to our knowledge, the first case of fatal asthma induced by timolol eye-drop in Japan.", 
    "68": "Selective Beta Blocker Tenolol (IPCA) 50 mg. (A50) and 100 mg. (A100) single dose drug therapy was tried in 25 cases of angina pectoris. Hypertensives were excluded from trial. There were 4 diabetics. Drug trial over a period of 4 weeks revealed subjective and objective improvement with A50 and A100 assessed at the end of 2 and 4 weeks. The average angina attacks/2 wks. was 13.12 +/- 11.26 in basal state whereas the reduction in angina attacks was 6.285 +/- 8.80 with Tenolol 50 mg. and 3.72 +/- 2.86 with 100 mg which was statistically significant. Objective assessment of each patient done by Computerised Stress Test (CST) at the end of 2 and 4 weeks of Tenolol 50 mg and 100 mg revealed statistically significant improvement in their ST depression i.e. 3.645 +/- 1.463 mm basal ST depression, 1.692 +/- 1.680 after Tenolol 50 mg and 2.318 +/- 1.270 after Tenolol 100 mg. There was statistically significant fall in systolic BP (SBP) and double product (DP) both with A50 and 100 mg. Only one patient had slow ventricular tachycardia and mild hypotension during CST.", 
    "69": "The purpose of this study was to see if physostigmine, a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor, affects the secretion and composition of saliva of the major salivary glands of the rat. Low doses of physostigmine did not elicit secretion. At higher doses there was significant flow from the parotid and submandibular glands within 5 min; however, no sublingual secretion was observed. The submandibular flow rate was highest for the first 5 min, then declined rapidly. The parotid flow rate initially was one-fifth of the maximum submandibular rate and then gradually decreased. The concentrations of Ca, Na and K of physostigmine-induced parotid saliva, and the Na of submandibular saliva, were similar to those with carbachol stimulation. The Ca and K concentrations of submandibular saliva were significantly higher than with carbachol or parasympathetic stimulation, and resembled those of alpha-adrenergic stimulation. The protein concentrations of physostigmine-evoked saliva from both glands were similar. The amylase activity of physostigmine-evoked parotid saliva was much higher than that of carbachol or parasympathetic stimulation. Physostigmine-evoked secretion was completely blocked by atropine, a cholinergic antagonist, and by reserpine, partially blocked by phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist and not affected by surgical sympathectomy. Morphologically, physostigmine resulted in a moderate decrease in the number of acinar, but not ductal, secretory granules of both the parotid and submandibular glands, while the sublingual gland was unaffected. Numerous patches of parotid acini also developed vacuoles or vesicles. These results suggest that physostigmine-induced salivary secretion is mediated primarily by direct effects on cholinergic and alpha-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "70": "Arterial hypoxemia, decrease in non-organic phosphorus, 2,3-DPG, ATP erythrocyte levels and associated deterioration of O2 tissue supply have been observed in 106 patients with peritonitis. Intravenous administration of propranolol, potassium dihydrophosphate and inosine prevented a decrease in erythrocyte phosphate level, improved oxygen and energy tissue supply and reduced the duration of the patient stay in hospital.", 
    "71": "A case of acute renal failure in association with a deliberate labetalol overdose is described. The possible pathogenetic mechanisms behind the deterioration in renal function are discussed. Treatment of beta-blockade overdose, with special emphasis on the place of glucagon in such poisoning, is reviewed.", 
    "72": "Several physiologic changes accompany the aging process and may alter the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs given to elderly patients. The primary purpose of the present investigation was to compare the pharmacokinetics of labetalol in young and elderly hypertensive patients. Limited data regarding the pharmacodynamics of labetalol in each of these age groups were also evaluated. Ten young (age 32-48 yrs) and nine elderly (age 60-68 yrs) patients with essential hypertension were evaluated after the first and last doses of a 15-day regimen of labetalol. The young group received 200 mg orally at 9:00 P.M. and 9:00 A.M.; the elderly group received 200 mg once daily at 9:00 P.M. No significant differences in the mean (SD) apparent oral clearance of the drug existed between groups after the first [4.8 (1.9) and 4.3 (1.2) L/hr/kg] and final [4.4 (2.2) and 3.4 (1.0) L/hr/kg] doses of labetalol. No changes in any pharmacokinetic values for labetalol were detected as a function of age. Changes in standing blood pressure and heart rate after the first and last doses were generally similar between the young and elderly hypertensives. Labetalol was effective and well tolerated in both groups.", 
    "73": "We studied the effect of phenylpropanolamine on blood pressures in seven patients whose hypertension was controlled with beta blockers. Rapid-release phenylpropanolamine 25 mg and placebo were given on separate days according to a double-blind, randomized, two-period crossover design. The crossover analyses detected significant drug effects without carryover or period effects for both systolic and diastolic pressures. The peak systolic blood pressures after phenylpropanolamine averaged 8 mm Hg higher than those measured after placebo. Similarly, the peak diastolic pressures after phenylpropanolamine averaged 4.9 mm Hg higher than those with placebo. Baseline weights, blood pressures, and pulses did not significantly differ between patient groups or change significantly across study periods. Usual single and therapeutic doses of phenylpropanolamine caused small but statistically significant increases in blood pressure. If such changes are not considered when antihypertensive therapy is altered or initiated, patients may receive excessive or unnecessary drugs.", 
    "74": "We compared the efficacy of diltiazem and propranolol in a randomized, prospective, double-blind, crossover study in six patients with untreated thyrotoxicosis (mean age 31 yrs). The patients received either diltiazem 60 mg orally four times a day or propranolol 40 mg orally four times a day, each for 1 week, separated by a 3-day drug-free period. Blood pressure, heart rate, thyroid hormone levels (free T4, T3), electrocardiogram, two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiograms, and Doppler studies were performed. In addition, 8 clinical signs and 18 symptoms of thyrotoxicosis were graded. All subjects felt better with drug therapy, with three preferring diltiazem to propranolol. No significant difference in clinical response or in hemodynamic effects was noted between the agents. These data suggest that diltiazem may serve as an alternative therapy for beta blockers in controlling thyrotoxic symptoms in patients in whom beta blockade may be contraindicated.", 
    "75": "In a prospective study the effect of Betaloc therapy on pregnancy-associated mild and moderately severe hypertension has been examined. Besides the effects on the mother the changes of foetal heart rate were also observed. The antihypertensive therapy was performed with daily 3 x 100 mg (3 x 1 tab) oral doses of Betaloc in 30 pregnant women with 140-170 mmHg systolic and 90-110 mmHg diastolic blood pressure values at admittance. In the course of the examinations definite and statistically significant fall of systolic flood pressure could be observed following the onset of Betaloc therapy as early as on the first day of drug administration which could be maintained during therapy. Somewhat less definite but the same change was observed in the diastolic blood pressure. Maternal pulse rate was significantly higher before therapy than after finishing Betaloc therapy. Notable foetal bradycardia was not observed, in the course of Betaloc administration the decrease of foetal heart rate did not surpass the normal limit values. During the therapy no side-effect attributable to the drug was observed.", 
    "76": "Restriction of lipolysis as well as a decrease in the rate of lipid peroxidation due to prevention of inhibition of antioxidant enzymes and to maintaining of bioantioxidants in heart and brain tissues were observed during the postresuscitation period in rats preadministered with inderal and reanimated after acute lethal hemorrhage. Inderal, which maintained homeostasis of phospholipid fractions in cardiomyocyte membranes, decreased the electric unstability of heart and prevented the ventricles fibrillation within the early period after resuscitation. The drug decreased distinctly catabolism of adenylic nucleotides in heart and brain tissues.", 
    "77": "Metoprolol pretreatment has been shown to reduce the cardiovascular malformation rate produced by topical doses of dopamine in the stage 24 chick embryo. We report on the tissue and plasma levels and teratogenic effect of dopamine hydrochloride following topical application of a teratogenic dose in stage 24 chick embryos pretreated with either metoprolol tartrate or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Pretreatment with either metoprolol or PBS resulted in similar patterns of dopamine distribution in the head, body, and heart, with peak levels occurring at 12 hours after dopamine treatment. Plasma concentrations of dopamine were similar for both PBS and metoprolol pretreated embryos, with plasma levels exceeding tissue concentrations, but also peaking at 12 hours after dopamine treatment. Pretreatment with PBS followed by a teratogenic dose of dopamine resulted in a decrease in the teratogenic effect of dopamine similar to that found in previous work in our lab with pretreatment with metoprolol. The developing chick cardiovascular system experiences peak susceptibility to the teratogenic effects of dopamine at stage 24 during development, which represents a time frame of about 12 hours. A delay in the peak levels of dopamine to 12 hours after dopamine treatment as compared to previous work in our lab reporting peak levels of dopamine at 1 hour, suggests that the previously reported antiteratogenic effects of metoprolol may be due, at least in part, to a delayed absorption of dopamine past the time of peak susceptibility of the embryo to the teratogen.", 
    "78": "In 40 patients with essential hypertension, the authors studied the haemodynamic resistance in forearm vessels before and after 15-min arterial occlusion, and changes in this parameter during a three-year combined antihypertensive treatment. The study revealed that the 15-min occlusion did not entirely suppress the contractile activity of vascular smooth muscles. Under these conditions, the minimum vascular resistance reflects the sum of structural and functional alterations. The character of change in minimal haemodynamic vascular resistance depends on the mechanism of action of the antihypertensive drugs. Administration of the post-synaptic alpha-adrenergic blocker Pratsiol produces a decrease in the minimal haemodynamic vascular resistance.", 
    "79": "A single oral dose of atenolol 100 mg was given to 7 hypothyroid patients (4 F, 3 M), before and after correction of hypothyroidism, mean delay 3.5 months (2 to 6.5 months). There was no change in the elimination parameters of atenolol, but the maximal plasma atenolol concentration was increased (1.66 to 7.37 mg.l-1) as was the AUC (14.9 to 52.1 mg.l-1.h) when the hypothyroidism had been treated. Only one patient differed: he had had a supra-selective vagotomy, and had similar curves before and after treatment of the hypothyroidism, both being similar to the plasma concentration curves found in the other patients after correction of the hypothyroidism. The results suggest an increase in the bioavailability of atenolol when hypothyroidism is corrected. The findings in the patient with vagotomy suggest that the decreased bioavailability during hypothyroidism might be related to changes in intestinal pH. Further studies are needed of the impact of hypothyroidism on gastric and pancreatic or biliary function and its consequences for drug absorption, and drug pharmacokinetics.", 
    "80": "Following a cross-over design propranolol 20 mg p.o. was given to 7 healthy subjects at 09.00 h and 21.00 h at an interval of 1 week. Heart rate (HR) during submaximal ergometer exercise was measured at four intervals during 10 h after treatment. Plasma propranolol concentrations were also determined. The suppressive effect (%R) of propranolol on the rise in HR during exercise after the morning dosage was significantly greater at 1.5 h and tended to be greater 3 h after administration than at comparable times in the evening trial. Mean plasma propranolol concentrations during the early phase were higher after the morning than the evening dose. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 10 h (AUC (0-10] and absorption rate constant (ka) were significantly greater after the morning dose. The time to maximum concentration (tmax) and elimination half-life (t 1/2) of the morning and evening dosages did not differ. A significant correlation was observed between plasma propranolol concentration and %R in HR during exercise in the morning (r = 0.74) and evening (r = 0.63) trials, and the regression lines of the morning and evening treatments did not differ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "81": "A 72-year-old man suddenly developed severe muscle weakness following the treatment with pindolol (Calvisken) for three days. Neurological examination on admission disclosed marked proximal muscle weakness with absent deep tendon reflexes. Laboratory data showed significant increase of serum CK, aldolase and myoglobin. Electromyography revealed both neurogenic and myogenic changes in all muscle tested. Skeletal muscle CT showed patchy low density areas in muscles of thigh and leg, especially in the hamstrings. Femoral muscle biopsy demonstrated a granulomatous nodule with multinucleated giant cells in the degenerated muscle fibers showing small-grouped atrophy. By Mb-PAP staining, Mb-negative fibers were randomly distributed among normally stained ones. Leu 1, 3a, 4, HLA-DR positive cells were found adjacent to the granuloma by immunoperoxidase staining. After immediate withdrawal of pindolol and treatment with steroid, he recovered muscle strength and enzyme activities were normalized in a week. Beta blockers have been known to induce muscle cramps or pain and moderate elevation of serum muscle enzymes. However, severe muscle weakness with highly elevated enzyme activities leading to rhabdomyolysis as noticed in the present case was rarely reported in the literature. Underlying sarcoid myopathy might be suspected to exaggerate this unusual case of pindolol-induced rhabdomyolysis. A careful use of pindolol is emphasized.", 
    "82": "1. The frequency-dependent electrophysiological effects of lignocaine, sotalol, and their combination were studied in dog isolated cardiac Purkinje fibres, both at various constant rates of stimulation and following abrupt changes in pacing cycle length. 2. The combined effect of 18 microM lignocaine and 30 microM sotalol selectively lengthened duration of premature action potentials evoked at a diastolic interval of 40 ms (from 172.2 +/- 5.4 to 201.7 +/- 4.9 ms, n = 6, P less than 0.01) without significantly changing the durations of action potentials evoked at the basic cycle length of 500 ms (259.1 +/- 7.7 vs 251.9 +/- 3.9 ms, n = 11). 3. The combination of lignocaine with sotalol, like lignocaine alone, displayed a use-dependent depression of Vmax and revealed a slow component for a recovery of Vmax (tau = 173.5 +/- 16.0 ms, n = 5). 4. The kinetics for restitution of action potential duration were also slowed by the combination of the two dwo drugs (tau f = 173.6 +/- 16.7, before, vs 268.5 +/- 8.5 ms, after; n = 5, P less than 0.01), while the maximum action potential duration attained in this relation was not increased as it was by sotalol alone. 5. Lignocaine, therefore, appeared to inhibit the sotalol-induced lengthening of action potential duration at slow pacing rates and at long diastolic intervals. The combination of lignocaine with sotalol also completely abolished the occurrence of sotalol-induced early after depolarizations. 6. Finally, sotalol alone moderately increased the range of premature action potential durations, while the combination of the two drugs significantly decreased this parameter. 7. These findings indicate that the combination of lignocaine with sotalol may provide important, and unique, beneficial electrophysiological alterations that might be expected to provide enhanced antiarrhythmic efficacy in patients.", 
    "83": "A study of 38 patients with hypertensive disease revealed that anaprilin is an effective hypotensive agent. Administration of anaprilin (120-160 mg daily) produced a redistribution of the peripheral blood supply in the abdominal cavity, crus, finger and head. In regions with normal blood supply level it decreased while in regions with a reduced supply it increased. This redistribution is an important compensatory mechanism of limitation of ischemia in the regions but is worsening the blood supply in all regions in most patients. Pathogenetic treatment of patients with hypertensive disease (grade II) requires individual control of its effect on the central and peripheral hemodynamics and their early correction by adding vasodilating and diuretic agents as well as those improving blood supply of the brain.", 
    "84": "The mechanisms of hydrocortisone and adrenalin action on the structure and function of the lysosomal-vacuolar cell apparatus were studied in experiments on liver sections of Wistar rats. The sections were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4 (95% O2 and 5% CO2) at 37 degrees C for 2 h. Hydrocortisone (10(-5) M) and adrenalin (10(-4) M), added to an incubation medium, were shown to produce a labilizing effect on lysosomal membranes, increasing free activity of acid phosphatase and cathepsin D and osmotic sensitivity of lysosomes. alpha-adrenergic blocker dihydroergotamine (3.4 x 10(-5) M) blocked an increase in free activity of acid phosphatase as a result of adrenalin action but did not eliminate hydrocortisone labilizing action. beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol (3 x 10(-4) M) lowered free activity indices and osmotic sensitivity of lysosomes to control values both in the presence of adrenalin and hydrocortisone. The labilization of lysosomal membranes in liver sections was also observed after adding dibutyril-cAMP (10(-8) M) or monobutyril-cGMP (10(-13)-10(-9) M) into the incubation medium.", 
    "85": "The results of experimental pharmacological studies may help obstetricians to make a choice of a schedule of using the uterotropic drugs and their doses. In vivo and in vitro experiments on pregnant rats showed that administration of the Soviet-made prostaglandin E2--prostenon--in combination with oxytocin and obsidan in half doses increased its stimulating effect on the myometrium. The use of prostenon and oxytocin against the background of partusisten treatment was not followed by a significant change of their stimulating uterotropic action.", 
    "86": "Lonomycin A, an ionophorous antibiotic, exhibits a high transport rate for monovalent cations, especially potassium. The cardiovascular actions of lonomycin A were studied in anesthetized dogs. Lonomycin A administered intravenously at 30 micrograms/kg increased coronary blood flow slightly with relatively small alterations in other hemodynamic parameters. After 100 micrograms/kg, a slight and transient fall followed by an increase in blood pressure was observed. Coronary blood flow, cardiac output, left ventricular pressure, max dP/dt, and isometric ventricular segmental tension increased. Arterial venous O2 difference and total peripheral vescular resistance decreased. Above 300 micrograms/kg, dramatic alterations were produced in almost all hemodynamic parameters, and total peripheral vascular resistance was increased. Lonomycin A-induced positive inotropic action was partly inhibited by pretreatment with pindolol, however gradual shortening of the ventricular wall length was still observed. A positive chronotropic action induced by lonomycin A was inhibited by pindolol pretreatment in vivo. On the other hand, lonomycin A elicited a negative chronotropic effects in the isolated guinea-pig right atrium, concomitantly increasing resting tension. These results suggest that lonomycin A alone produces peripheral vascular dilation and effects cardiac functions, which are in turn modified by lonomycin A-induced cathecholamine release from nerve terminals.", 
    "87": "Fourteen patients operated for pheochromocytoma from 1978 to 1988 are reviewed. The preoperative treatment with adrenergic blockers is analyzed: phenoxybenzamine with final doses of 10-140 mg/day (mean 55.4 mg/day) and propranolol with doses of 40-80 mg/day (mean 50 mg/day). The premedications and anesthetic techniques are compared, the use of droperidol being discouraged because of the development of hypertensive paroxysms both preoperatively and postoperatively. The new benzodiazepines are offered as an alternative. The treatment of hypertensive paroxysms with phentolamine with total doses of 2.5-35 mg and that of peroperative arrhythmias with propranolol with total doses of 1-6 mg are reported. The recently described therapeutic approaches are also discussed.", 
    "88": "It has been well known for a long time that beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking substances may cause Raynaud's phenomenon in hands and feet if applied orally or parenterally. Nevertheless, vasospastic phenomenons of the \"Raynaud\"-type have never before been described following local administration. Now a Raynaud's syndrome found in a 58-year old patient, who had been treated for glaucoma with timolol (Chibro-Timoptol-eyedrops), leaves no doubt that there is a risk of systemic vasospasm in ocular application, too. An exposition test was carried out to prove the connection between the application of timolol eyedrops and Raynaud's syndrome. It did reveal that an initially already marginally prolonged warm-up time after exposition to cold water, as measured in the thermographic test, did relevantly get worse after timolol application. At the same time, no change in arterial systolic finger blood pressure could be demonstrated using Doppler sonography. The induction of Raynaud's syndrome by beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking eyedrops may depend on an individual disposition.", 
    "89": "A physiological model of propranolol disposition was designed to help explain the large increase in AUC seen when the drug is administered with food. The mass balance equation for the liver compartment used Michaelis-Menten terms to describe hepatic metabolism. Previously published pharmacokinetic and physiological parameters were used throughout. The three parameters, Qh, Kmt, and Vmax, were varied for different durations and by a factor of two to increase AUC. The parameter variations were patterned after the changes in splanchnic blood flow following a high protein meal. The model exhibits saturation kinetics for most of the absorption phase after a simulated single oral dose of 1 mg kg-1, during which hepatic extraction is decreased. As the dose is decreased, the degree of saturation lessens. Using an input rate representative of regular release, changes to Qh caused little change in AUC. While the model was moderately sensitive to Kmt changes, large increases in AUC were seen after Vmax was altered. The sensitivity of the system to Kmt and Vmax changes became greater as the duration of the changes was increased. The AUC was most sensitive to Vmax variation, leading to the conclusion that mechanisms involving this parameter should be explored further. Reducing the input rate to mimic sustained release decreased the AUC for a given dose as well as the sensitivity of AUC to changes in Kmt and Vmax.", 
    "90": "Doses of 80, 160 and 320 mg of Inderal LA (slow-release propranolol) were compared in 12 patients with stable angina pectoris. There was an unpredictable and variable individual response to treatment and hence no differences were detected between the effects of the three doses on mean treadmill exercise duration, time to angina, frequency of angina or glyceryl/trinitrate consumption. There was a marked deterioration in two patients whilst on 320 mg Inderal LA. In these patients, the time to angina fell by 2 minutes 50 seconds and 4 minutes 20 seconds on 320 mg daily and 160 mg daily respectively. Given the inter-patient variability in response to Inderal LA, the dose for each patient should be individually titrated according to response. Two patients reported here suggest that some subjects may benefit from lower doses, although further work is required to clarify this point. Possible explanations for this finding are discussed.", 
    "91": "A double-blind study of 98 patients who underwent elective hysterectomy or orthopaedic surgery was conducted to evaluate the effect of metoprolol or placebo combined with diazepam given 1-3 hours before surgery. Evaluation was by anaesthetists and by visual analogue scoring by the patients. The anaesthetists found that patients who received metoprolol were significantly less anxious (p less than 0.005) and better sedated (p less than 0.001) before induction of anaesthesia. The patients who received metoprolol found themselves more calm compared with placebo patients. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were reduced by metoprolol compared to placebo. Metoprolol may be a valuable drug for premedication.", 
    "92": "Rats were rewarded by food for running in a straight runway with short (15 sec) intertrial intervals. On the final day, animals were subjected to either 14 extinction trials or 14 rewarded trials. During acquisition, half of each group had been injected once daily for 15 days with propranolol (5 mg/kg IP), the remainder with saline vehicle. All animals were killed immediately after the final trial and the cerebral cortex taken for noradrenaline assay and radioligand binding to beta- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Propranolol increased running times early in extinction; this effect was replicated in a second experiment. Neither the drug injections nor the extinction procedure affected neurochemical measures. However, the rate of extinction correlated positively with both beta- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor number. Although consistent with the theory that beta-adrenoceptors are involved in adaptation to stress, these results differ from our previous findings. The relationship between beta-adrenoceptor number and the response to stress may depend on the severity of the stress.", 
    "93": "Previous studies have demonstrated that in male rats hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth (HSI), which is induced by medial septal lesions (MS), is detrimental to recovery of spatial learning. The present study was performed in an attempt to determine if this effect was mediated through adrenergic receptor activity. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent training on a modified version (i.e., 4 arms baited) of a radial-8-arm maze task. Following attainment of learning criterion animals underwent one of three surgical procedures: CON (sham surgeries); MSGx (MS + superior cervical ganglionectomy--to prevent HSI); MS (MS + sham ganglionectomy). Reacquisition trials were performed in the same manner as initial acquisition except animals were treated with vehicle, propranolol (20 mg/kg), or phentolamine (20 mg/kg) 30 minutes prior to testing. As expected, vehicle-treated MS animals took longer to reacquire the task than MSGx animals, who were in turn more impaired than CON animals. Propranolol (beta-adrenergic antagonist) treatment impaired performance of both the MS and MSGx group, but did not alter the CON group. Phentolamine (alpha-adrenergic antagonist) increased the number of trials to reattain criterion in the CON group, had no effect in the MSGx group, and markedly improved performance in the MS group. The results suggest that HSI mediates its detrimental effects through alpha-receptors, while beta-blockade, in the setting of brain injury, is detrimental to performance regardless of the presence or absence of HSI.", 
    "94": "Reductions in flicker sensitivity in ocular hypertension are thought to precede manifest glaucomatous damage, but the proportion of patients with ocular hypertension reported to have losses in flicker sensitivity (50-90%) is far out of step with the proportion of ocular hypertensive patients in whom clinically defined glaucoma will develop (5-30%). The authors examined the possibility that the flicker losses in some of these patients represent not early glaucomatous damage, but instead a transient influence of raised intraocular pressure (IOP) on an otherwise normal eye. Temporal contrast sensitivity was measured in 26 patients with ocular hypertension and in 22 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) before and after hypotensive treatment (timolol). Compared with normotensive controls, all POAG patients exhibited sensitivity losses before treatment which remained unchanged after treatment. The ocular hypertensive patients were divided into three groups, which may reflect differing risks of glaucoma conversion. Group I patients (8/26) had normal flicker sensitivity, and thus appear to be resistant to high IOP. Group II patients (9/26) showed initial losses which disappeared with lowered IOP. They probably have not yet suffered damage but appear to be sensitive to high IOP. Group III patients (9/26) had losses that persisted despite lowered IOPs. The similarity of their response to that of the POAGs suggests that group III patients have already suffered early glaucomatous damage.", 
    "95": "Vasorelaxant action of platelet activating factor (PAF) was examined in perfused mesenteric vascular beds and mesenteric artery strips isolated from rats. PAF caused a dose-dependent vasodilation of norepinephrine-contracted mesenteric vascular bed, which was sensitive to CV-3988, a PAF antagonist, but insensitive to tetrodotoxin, atropine, propranolol and indomethacin. PAF also caused a relaxation of phenylephrine-contracted mesenteric artery strips at above 3 X 10(-12) M. Much higher concentrations of PAF were required to relax the aorta, carotid and pulmonary arteries. The PAF- and acetylcholine (ACh)-induced relaxations of mesenteric artery were dependent on the presence of endothelium and were inhibited by either hydroquinone and methylene blue, which inhibit the action of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), or L-canavanine, which inhibits the formation of nitric oxide from L-arginine. Phospholipase A2 inhibitors such as quinacrine and ONO-RS-082 abolished the relaxation induced by ACh but did not affect that by PAF. Thus, PAF induces a vasorelaxation by releasing EDRF from endothelial cells as ACh does, although the pathway to produce the substances by PAF may be different from that by ACh.", 
    "96": "Ischemic induces a nonexocytotic noradrenaline release in the heart, which leads to high and potentially harmful interstitial noradrenaline concentrations. The effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on noradrenaline release in ischemia has been investigated in the present study. DL-Propranolol (1-100 mumol/l) concentration-dependently reduced noradrenaline release during 20 min of global and total ischemia in the perfused rat heart. Other beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents such as atenolol, metoprolol, and timolol (10 mumol/l each), however, did not share this effect. Moreover, both stereoisomers of propranolol were equipotent in suppression of ischemia-induced noradrenaline release, indicating a property of propranolol independent from interaction with beta-adrenoceptors. The well known local anesthetic action of propranolol was not likely to cause its inhibitory effect on ischemia-induced noradrenaline release, as lidocaine (10 mumol/l) did not affect noradrenaline overflow in ischemia. The effect of propranolol was further examined in cyanide intoxication, an experimental model of energy depletion. In this experimental setting the release of dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol--the major neuronal metabolite of noradrenaline--served as indicator of increased axoplasmic noradrenaline levels which are present during nonexocytotic noradrenaline release. In cyanide intoxication DL-propranolol also reduced noradrenaline overflow but did not affect release of dihydroxyphenylethylene glycol. The latter finding suggests an interaction of propranolol with the neuronal membrane transport of noradrenaline. In ischemia and cyanide intoxication, transport of noradrenaline across the plasma membrane is known to be driven by the noradrenaline carrier (uptake1) working in reverse of its normal direction--from inside to outside. Consequently, inhibitors of the noradrenaline carrier like desipramine were shown to suppress nonexocytotic noradrenaline release in ischemia and cyanide intoxication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
