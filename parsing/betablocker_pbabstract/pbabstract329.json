    "0": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the incidence of adverse effects and the prognostic value of various risk factors in a large population of unselected hypertensive patients treated with the ACE inhibitor trandolapril. Among the 30 072 patients investigated in this post marketing retrospective study, 1813 patients (6.0 per cent) reported an adverse effect. The five most frequent side effects were coughing (3.1 per cent), dizziness (0.7 per cent), headache (0.6 per cent) asthenia (0.5 per cent) and nausea (0.3 per cent). Intolerance risk factors for trandolapril were researched using both univariate and multivariate analysis. In the univariate analysis, a prior intolerance of an ACE inhibitor and female gender were strongly correlated with either overall intolerance or coughing. The most relevant variables for the occurrence of adverse effects, listed according to their entry order in the multivariate analysis, were: prior intolerance of ACE inhibitors (OR: 4.19, 95 per cent CI: 3.66-4.78), female gender (OR: 1.46, 95 per cent CI: 1.31-1.63), prior intolerance of other antihpertensive agents (OR: 1.27, 95 per cent CI: 1.14-1.41), smoking (OR: 0.76, 95 per cent CI: 0.66-0.87) and combination with a beta blocker (OR: 1.31, 95 per cent CI: 1.08-1.58). A prior intolerance of an ACE inhibitor appears to be a very strong predictor of coughing (OR: 6.14, 95 per cent CI: 5.24-7.19). The following variables, namely female gender (OR: 1.61, 95 per cent CI: 1.40-1.85), age 60-80 (OR: 1.25, 95 per cent CI: 1.09-1.44) and prior intolerance of other antihypertensive agents (OR: 1.20, 95 per cent CI: 1.03-2.39) appear less significant.", 
    "1": "The effects of the organic calcium channel blocker verapamil and the beta-receptor blocker propranolol on dipole (phi(d)) and surface (phi(s)) potentials of bilayer lipid membranes were studied. The boundary potentials (phi(b)= phi(d) + phi(s)) of black lipid membranes, monitored by conductance measurements in the presence of nonactin and by capacitive current measurements were compared with phi(s) calculated from the electrophoretic mobility of lipid vesicles. It was shown that the increase of boundary potential, induced by the adsorption of the positively charged propranolol, was caused solely by an increase in surface potential. Although phi(s) also increases due to the adsorption of verapamil, phi(b) diminishes. A sharp decrease of the dipole potential was shown to be responsible for this effect. From Langmuir adsorption isotherm the dissociation constant Kd of verapamil was estimated. The uncharged form of verapamil (Kd=(0.061+/-0.01) mM at pH 10.5) has a tenfold higher affinity to a neutral bilayer membrane than the positively charged form. The alteration of membrane dipole potential due to verapamil adsorption may have important implications for both membrane translocation and partitioning of small or hydrophobic ions and charged groups of membrane proteins.", 
    "2": "The effects of carvedilol, a multiple-action neurohormonal antagonist, and metoprolol, a highly selective beta1 antagonist, were compared on postischemic contractile recovery and contracture. Isolated rabbit hearts were aerobically perfused for 45 min and subjected to zero-flow normothermic ischemia for 30 or 60 min followed by reperfusion for 30 min. Carvedilol and metoprolol were added to the perfusion solution 10 min before inducing ischemia and were maintained in the perfusate throughout reperfusion. Left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) were assessed with an intraventricular balloon. Because the volume of the balloon was held constant, an increase in LVEDP reflected an increase in diastolic chamber stiffness or \"contracture.\" After 30 min of ischemia, the carvedilol-treated hearts exhibited a significantly better cardiac function than did control or metoprolol-treated hearts. At the end of reperfusion, the control group LVDP recovered to 21.4+/-9.9% of the preischemic value. With 0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 microM metoprolol, LVDP recovered to 33.2+/-13.6%, 41.7+/-13.0%, and 48.8+/-13.3% of initial developed pressure, respectively. In the carvedilol group, a greater recovery of LVDP was obtained at 0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 microM: 64.0+/-2.5%, 60.4+/-6.3%, and 68.0+/-2.0% of preischemic values, respectively (p < 0.05 vs. controls). Within the first 5 min of reperfusion, LVEDP increased to 70.3+/-2.7 mm Hg in control hearts, indicating a pronounced contracture, whereas metoprolol reduced LVEDP when given at high concentration, 0.3 microM (41.9+/-10.7 mm Hg). Carvedilol, even at the lowest concentration, 0.03 microM, almost completely inhibited the postischemic contracture (16.5+/-4.0 mm Hg; p < 0.05 vs. control and metoprolol). The cardioprotection provided by carvedilol also is observed in hearts subjected to more severe ischemic periods. After 60 min of ischemia, control hearts failed to restore LVDP function; in the metoprolol group, ventricular function recovered to only 4.6+/-3.1%, whereas carvedilol-treated hearts exhibited 23.6+/-1.9% of preischemic values at the end of reperfusion. In addition, carvedilol induced a reduction in ischemic contracture: control, 36.7+/-3 mm Hg; metoprolol, 38.7+/-3.7 mm Hg; and carvedilol, 15.7+/-8.4 mm Hg at 50 min of ischemia. Similarly, carvedilol reduced contracture during the reperfusion compared with metoprolol and control groups (83.2+/-3.4 mm Hg, 106.9+/-3.3 mm Hg, and 107.6+/-4.1 mm Hg, respectively). These data clearly demonstrate that carvedilol was markedly more effective than metoprolol to protect systolic function after ischemia and to reduce postischemic contracture.", 
    "3": "Torsades de pointes is a potentially life-threatening form of polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia typically seen in the presence of repolarization-prolonging agents. We investigated this particular form of tachyarrhythmia in the isolated, perfused rabbit heart. The experimental model was designed to reproduce conditions that are clinically known to be associated with an increased propensity to the development of torsades de pointes. The class III agent clofilium (1 microM) and d,l-sotalol (10 microM), as well as the antibiotic erythromycin (30-150 microM) were infused in the presence of either normal (5.88 mM) or low (1.5 mM) potassium concentration in sinus-driven or atrioventricular (AV)-blocked hearts. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias spontaneously emerged in the clofilium-, d,l-sotalol-, and erythromycin-treated AV-blocked hearts. The episodes showed typical features of torsades de pointes found in humans. They developed within 4-12 min after the onset of infusion, were normally nonsustained, and only rarely degenerated into ventricular fibrillation. Electrical stimulation at cycle lengths <600 ms and perfusion with MgSO4 suppressed arrhythmic activity. In the d,l-sotalol- and erythromycin-treated hearts, torsades de pointes occurred only in the presence of hypokalemia and bradycardia, whereas, in the presence of clofilium, bradycardia alone caused torsades de pointes. Monophasic action-potential recordings demonstrated early afterdepolarizations in endocardial and epicardial recordings. Thus the isolated AV-blocked rabbit heart represents a model for studying drug-related torsades de pointes and its mechanism.", 
    "4": "Several studies indicated an abnormal endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDV) in hypertensive patients, but no study has systematically investigated the effects of different pharmacologic classes of antihypertensive drugs on EDV. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of three different antihypertensive regimens [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, calcium channel blockade, and beta-blockade] on EDV when given locally in the forearm at a constant blood pressure. The increase in forearm blood flow (FBF) during local intraarterial infusions of methacholine (MCh; inducing EDV) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP; inducing endothelium-independent vasodilation, EIDV) was measured in young, normotensive subjects by venous occlusion plethysmography, before and during concomitant local intraarterial infusion of any of the antihypertensive drugs. Without changing baseline FBF, enalaprilat (n=6, 2.4 mg/h) potentiated the increase in FBF induced by MCh [from 22.6+/-2.3 (SD) to 25.4+/-2.3 ml/min/100 ml tissue at 4 microg/min; p < 0.05], but the response to SNP was unchanged. Local intraarterial verapamil infusion (n=6), at a dose individually titrated to keep baseline FBF unchanged, did not alter the response to MCh infusion, whereas the response to SNP was potentiated. A higher dose of verapamil (n=6), which increased baseline FBF, increased both EDV and EIDV significantly in parallel (p < 0.05). The local propranolol infusion (n=6, 1.2 mg/h) attenuated the FBF response to MCh significantly (from 28.9+/-5.7 to 21.5+/-3.2 ml/min/100 ml tissue at 4 microg/min; p < 0.05), whereas both baseline FBF and the response to SNP were unchanged. In conclusion, this investigation showed that commonly used antihypertensive drugs affect endothelial vasodilator function in a different ways. ACE inhibition enhanced EDV, whereas a nonselective beta-blocker attenuated EDV. The calcium channel blocker, verapamil, improved both EDV and EIDV, probably by a direct effect on the vascular smooth-muscle cells.", 
    "5": "The relaxant action of the standard beta-blocker propranolol was compared with betaxolol, a beta-blocker with established vasorelaxant properties. Ring segments of bovine retinal microartery (n=36, theta=237 microm), which lacks adrenergic nerves and beta-adrenoceptors, were mounted in an organ bath for isometric force recording. l-, d-, dl-Propranolol and betaxolol were equally effective in relaxing tonic K+-induced contractions. The median effective dose (ED50) value was approximately 10(-5) M for both beta-blockers. The relaxation by both beta-blockers was unaffected by endothelium removal. Like verapamil, both beta-blockers induced smaller relaxation of tonic prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha)-induced force, which depended less on Ca2+ influx than did K+-induced force: K+-, but not PGF2alpha-induced contractions were abolished in Ca2+-free medium. The minor betaxolol-induced relaxation of tonic PGF2alpha-induced force was blocked in Ca2+-free medium. With repeated exposures to PGF2alpha in Ca2+-free medium, initial phasic PGF2alpha-induced force declined less with every exposure than did subsequent tonic force. When the preparations were briefly equilibrated with K+- and Ca2+-rich solution before every exposure to PGF2alpha phasic force did not decline, indicating that phasic force primarily depended on Ca2+ released from intracellular stores. Both beta-blockers failed to relax phasic PGF2alpha-induced force. Thus propranolol and betaxolol are equipotent vasorelaxant drugs in retinal microartery, both probably acting via Ca2+ channel blockade. This activity (that shows no stereospecificity) thus appears to be a more general property of beta-blockers. Microarteries might be more sensitive to this activity than are conductance arteries.", 
    "6": "High levels of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) favours decreased plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased levels of cholesterol in apolipoprotein B containing lipoproteins. Adipose tissue is one of the major sources of circulating CETP. Previous studies by our group and others demonstrated that the production of CETP from hamster adipose tissue increases after fasting, a metabolic state known to affect the sympathoadrenal axis. The present study examines the influence of beta-adrenergic agonists on the secretion of CETP from hamster adipose tissue. Fifteen minutes after an intraperitoneal injection of isoproterenol (12 microg/kg), the release of CETP mass and activity from adipose tissue fragments incubated in vitro were significantly increased. This was associated with an elevation in CETP mass and activity in plasma. The effects of isoproterenol on CETP release from adipose tissue and plasma CETP levels were suppressed by propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor inhibitor. Addition of 10(-6) M isoproterenol to adipose tissue in vitro increased the release of CETP mass and activity from adipose tissue and this was also blocked by propranolol. Isoproterenol-induced secretion of CETP activity from adipose tissue was partially inhibited by cytochalasin B, an inhibitor of actin cytoskeleton reorganization. Forskolin, a classical adenylate cyclase agonist and 8-bromo-cAMP, a functional analogue of cAMP, mimicked the effect of isoproterenol on CETP release from adipose tissue. Our results suggest that isoproterenol increases the secretion of CETP from hamster adipose tissue through a beta-adrenoceptor and a cAMP-dependent pathway. Actin cytoskeleton reorganization may be required for secretion of CETP. The findings imply that the secretion of CETP from adipose tissue is under neurosympathetic control.", 
    "7": "The concentration-effect relationship of l-propranolol and dl-metoprolol were investigated in spontaneous hypertensive rats using reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. The influence of protein binding on the effect relationship was also assessed. The rats were assigned to treatment or placebo groups, where each group received three randomly selected consecutively increasing steady-state infusions. Different pharmacodynamic effect models were fitted to the data, using nonlinear mixed effect modeling. The data were best described by a combined effect model, with a sum of an ordinary Imax and a linear model. At the lower concentration range, the ordinary Imax model dominated, although at higher concentrations, the effect was linearly related to the antagonist concentration. The Imax were 83 +/- 6 and 103 +/- 6 beats . min-1 and the IC50 were 18.1 +/- 4.3 and 50.6 +/- 15.2 ng/ml for l-propranolol and dl-metoprolol, respectively. The slope in the linear model was steeper for l-propranolol than for dl-metoprolol, 28.9 +/- 2.8 and 4.48 +/- 0.39 beats . ml . (min . microgram)-1, respectively. Plasma protein binding of l-propranolol was saturable. The unbound IC50 for l-propranolol was 1.14 +/- 0.27 ng/ml. The concentration-effect relationship of l-propranolol was altered at higher plasma concentrations, due to saturable protein binding. The Imax and the linear concentration-effect relationship may be interpreted as a specific beta-antagonist effect and a membrane-stabilizing effect, respectively. Using exercise-induced tachycardia as a pharmacodynamic endpoint, to study the effect of beta-antagonists in spontaneous hypertensive rats, seems to give reliable results and can be a useful model to extrapolate to humans.",

    "29": "A variety of pathophysiologic processes are activated in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), and some of these have been implicated in the progression of the disease. The most important processes to be activated in CHF are the neurohormonal systems, which include the renin-angiotensin system, the sympathetic nervous system, and the endothelin system. In addition to the neurohormonal systems, the formation of reactive oxygen free radicals is increased in patients with CHF. It has been postulated that stimulation of neurohormonal pathways and the formation of oxygen free radicals ultimately lead to the activation of a family of transcription factors that are involved in cardiac remodeling, which is a hallmark of CHF. In addition, the formation of oxygen free radicals has been implicated in the process of apoptosis or programmed cell death, which may be responsible for a continued loss of myocardial cells, resulting in the progressive decrease in left ventricular function that occurs over time in patients with CHF. Carvedilol is a multiple-action neurohormonal antagonist that is effective in slowing the progression of CHF. In double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, carvedilol decreased mortality by 65% (p <0.001) and significantly reduced hospitalization. Carvedilol is a nonselective beta-blocker and vasodilator, the latter activity resulting from alpha1-adrenoceptor blockade. The hemodynamic responses produced by carvedilol result primarily from the blockade of beta1-, beta2-, and alpha1-adrenoceptors. Carvedilol reduces total peripheral vascular resistance and preload without significantly compromising cardiac output or eliciting reflex tachycardia. Carvedilol is also a potent antioxidant that may protect the myocardium from damage produced by oxygen radicals and, as a consequence of its antioxidant activity, carvedilol also inhibits apoptosis in the myocardium. The ability of carvedilol to inhibit apoptosis in the heart may be responsible, in part, for the ability of the drug to reduce mortality and to inhibit the progression of CHF.",

Before initiation of therapy, migraineurs as a group had increased CO2 reactivity (p=0.07) compared to 20 age- and sex-matched volunteers. While treatment with metoprolol has been reported to affect amplitudes of increased contingent negative variation or visual evoked potentials in interictal migraineurs, it had no influence on enhanced CO2 reactivity in the present study. Moreover, the pretreatment value of CO2 reactivity did not correlate with the clinical efficacy of metoprolol after a 2-month treatment period.", 
    "31": "Three acute coronary care surveys (1986, 1990, and 1993) were conducted in the Swiss region of Vaud-Fribourg on all men aged 25 to 64 years hospitalized for a definite myocardial infarction (218, 224, and 167 cases). Nearly all patients received anticoagulants and nitrates. The proportion of patients treated increased significantly, between 1986 and 1990, for antiplatelet drugs (from 51% to 96%) and thrombolytics (from 9% to 44%) and, between 1990 and 1993, for beta-blockers (from 57% to 78%) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (from 26% to 43%). The use of calcium antagonists and antiarrhythmics dropped over time. Coronary arteriography and angioplasty were increasingly performed (53% and 18% in 1993), although progressively postponed in-hospital stay. The observed trends reflect a rapid translation of clinical trials into medical practice. However the use of thrombolytics could be raised further by shortening the hospitalization delay (median: 3 hours in 1993) and door-to-needle time (median: 47 minutes) which remained stable over time.", 
    "32": "Experience accumulated from several large trials strongly suggest that beta-blockers should be used for the management of congestive heart failure (CHF). Beta-blockade should be added to conventional therapy such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and digoxin, as this was the approach used in the major trials. It is appropriate to treat patients with mild, moderate and, when stable, severe CHF. The benefits obtained include improvements in left ventricular function, reductions in symptoms and morbidity, improvement of quality of life, and delay of clinical progression, reflected by a reduced need for hospitalization and a reduction in mortality. Beta-blockers are much better tolerated, when used appropriately in selected patients, than was previously supposed.", 
    "33": "Because ejection fraction (EF) is one of the most important predictors of survival in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and because Packer showed a large reduction in mortality figures with carvedilol, in contrast to former studies with bisoprolol and metoprolol, we investigated if this difference in survival may be related to a difference in improvement of LV function by different beta-blockers. We searched the MEDLINE database and all reference lists of articles obtained through the search for the relation between beta-blocker treatment and improvement in EF. Forty-one studies met the criteria and we added two of our own studies. Four hundred and fifty-eight patients were treated with metoprolol with a mean follow-up of 9.5 months and a mean increase in EF of 7.4 EF units. One thousand thirty patients were treated with carvedilol with a mean follow up of 7 months and a mean increase in EF of 5.7 EF units. One hundred ninety-nine patients were treated with bucindolol with a mean follow-up of 4 months and a mean increase in EF of 4.6 EF units. Several small studies with nebivolol, atenolol, and propranolol were also studied and, when combined, the mean increase in EF was 8.6 EF units. When patients with idiopathic and ischemic cardiomyopathies were compared, the average increase in EF units was 8.5 vs. 6.0, respectively. The use of beta-blocker treatment in heart failure patients, irrespective of the etiology, improved LV function in almost all studies and it appears that the differences among beta-blockers and among etiologies is small and probably insignificant. However, there is a difference in survival rate when the various beta-blockers are compared, suggesting that mechanisms other than improvement of LV function by beta-blockers are responsible for the difference in survival.", 
    "34": "The model for heart failure has changed radically over the past 20 years. No longer a simple hemodynamic paradigm of pump dysfunction, heart failure is now characterized as a complex clinical syndrome with release of many neurohormones and cytokines, which are believed to be most responsible for progression of disease. This change in our understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure has important therapeutic implications. Drugs designed to influence the myocardial contractile state have been found over the past few decades to have either a neutral or an adverse effect on long-term survival, whereas agents designed to block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and other neurohormonal systems have proved to be remarkably effective treatment. Recently, drugs designed to block excessive sympathetic nervous system activity have been demonstrated in well-controlled studies to be safe and effective forms of therapy for heart failure. Carvedilol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker with alpha1-blocking and antioxidant properties, is associated with prevention of progression of heart failure as manifested by improvement in left ventricular (LV) function, reduction in heart size, and improved survival in patients with New York Heart Association functional Class II and III symptoms. This improvement is observed equally in patients with ischemic and non-ischemic heart failure. It is tempting to speculate that beta-adrenergic blockers prevent the progression of heart failure by reducing LV mass and LV chamber size. In essence, carvedilol, and perhaps other beta-adrenergic blockers, appear to abrogate relentless LV remodeling which is typically associated with progression of heart failure. The combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blockers may be particularly effective in this regard, although more data on beta-adrenergic blockers in patients with advanced heart failure are needed. Data from experimental heart failure animal models also suggest that endothelin (ET) subtype A (ET(A)) receptor blockers have the potential to lessen the pace of progressive LV remodeling. As our understanding of the neuroendocrine response to diminished cardiac performance improves, novel and even more imaginative neurohormonal and cytokine antagonists are likely to emerge as important new treatments for both hypertension and heart failure.", 
    "35": "Left ventricular (LV) dilatation after myocardial infarction (MI) is a major predictor of prognosis and identifies which patients will develop heart failure. Left ventricular dilatation or remodeling starts immediately after MI and progresses in the chronic phase of heart failure. Factors influencing remodeling, such as infarct size and neurohumoral activation, including the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin system, are discussed. Remodeling can be affected by reduction of infarct size and inhibition of neurohumoral activation. The effect of thrombolysis, beta-blockade, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in the acute phase after MI and in the chronic phase of heart failure on remodeling are discussed. On the basis of beneficial effects of ACE inhibition and beta-blockade in acute MI and in chronic heart failure, a treatment strategy is proposed in which both ACE inhibition and beta-blockade are started early after MI. Depending on infarct size and ventricular function, continued treatment in the chronic phase of heart failure must be considered.", 
    "36": "Physical exercise increases portal pressure (hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG]) in patients with cirrhosis. It is unknown if this deleterious effect is associated with changes in gastroesophageal collateral blood flow and if these can be prevented by propranolol administration. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of propranolol on the splanchnic hemodynamic response to exercise in patients with cirrhosis. Twenty-three patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension had hemodynamic measurements in baseline conditions, and during moderate cycling exercise (40 W) under double-blind propranolol or placebo administration. In patients receiving placebo, HVPG significantly increased during exercise (from 16.7 +/- 0.9 to 19.0 +/- 1.0 mm Hg; P < .01), hepatic blood flow (HBF) decreased (-18% +/- 4%; P < .01), while azygos blood flow (AzBF) was unchanged (4% +/- 12%; ns). In patients receiving propranolol, portal pressure did not increase during exercise, but decreased from 16.3 +/- 1.0 to 12.9 +/- 1.1 mm Hg (P < .01). The lack of increase in HVPG in response to exercise in patients receiving propranolol may be related to a more pronounced decrease in HBF, as compared with patients receiving placebo, and to a blunted increase in cardiac output (CO). Moderate physical exercise adversely influences the hepatic hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis, causing a significant increase in portal pressure. This is effectively prevented by propranolol pretreatment.", 
    "37": "Case reports of neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) often indicate that the edema resolves quickly. Because plasma epinephrine concentration may be elevated in NPE, and epinephrine has been shown to increase the rate of alveolar liquid clearance (ALC), we determined if ALC was increased in a canine model of NPE produced by the intracisternal administration of veratrine. ALC was determined by instilling autologous plasma into a lower lung lobe and using the increase in instillate protein concentration after 4 h to calculate the volume of fluid cleared from the airspaces by mass balance. To prevent pulmonary hypertension and edema, which would confound the mass balance analysis, carotid arterial blood was allowed to drain into a reservoir as pulmonary arterial pressure started to rise after veratrine administration. ALC in animals administered veratrine (n = 6) was 30.4 +/- 1.6 (SE)% of the instilled volume compared with 14.1 +/- 2.1% observed in control animals. The increase in ALC could be inhibited by adrenalectomy, beta2-adrenergic blockade using ICI 118,551, or sodium channel blockade using amiloride and could be duplicated by infusing epinephrine to increase plasma epinephrine concentration to levels observed in NPE. These data indicate that the increased ALC was mediated by adrenal epinephrine and suggest that edema resolution in patients with NPE might be accelerated by endogenous epinephrine.", 
    "38": "Cytokine gene expression in T lymphocytes is a strictly regulated process, involving both stimulatory and inhibitory signals. beta-Adrenoceptor (betaAR) agonists are widely used in the treatment of asthma and are able to induce an inhibitory signal on immunological responses after binding to their specific receptors. In this study, the characterization of betaAR subtype(s) (beta1, beta2, and beta3) involved in the regulation of interleukin (IL)-3, IL-4, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) mRNA accumulation was studied by using various betaAR agonists and antagonists. Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and IL-3 mRNAs are dose-dependently inhibited by the nonselective betaAR agonist isoproterenol and by the selective beta2AR agonist fenoterol. IL-4 mRNA accumulation was not susceptible to betaAR stimulation. The observed inhibition on IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and IL-3 mRNA was blocked by the selective beta2AR antagonist ICI 118,551 (10(-6) M) and by timolol (10(-6) M), a nonselective antagonist. The selective beta1AR antagonist atenolol (0.3 x 10(-6) M) did not have any effect. Secretion of GM-CSF protein in the presence of increasing concentrations of isoproterenol followed a similar pattern as observed for GM-CSF mRNA. In addition, the betaAR-mediated inhibition of IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and IL-3 mRNA accumulation and GM-CSF protein secretion were related to the accumulation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Although beta3AR mRNA was detectable in Con A-activated T lymphocytes, we could not demonstrate a functional activity in the regulation of cytokine expression: the beta3AR agonist BRL 37344 had no effect on the accumulation of the studied cytokine mRNAs, and did not significantly affect cellular cAMP levels. These data demonstrate that beta-agonist-induced inhibition of IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and IL-3 mRNA accumulation is solely mediated by beta2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "39": "1. In a previous report, we have shown that vasodilatation induced by acetylcholine is impaired in the kidney and the heart of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) in vivo. The present investigation was performed to study the influence of oral antihypertensive treatment with carvedilol for 6 to 10 weeks on acetylcholine-induced changes in regional haemodynamics in SHR in vivo. Cardiac output, regional blood flow and vascular resistance in organs of major importance in hypertensive disease, such as the kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, brain and eye, were measured with radioactively labelled microspheres in anaesthetized rats (aged 12-16 weeks).2. Mean arterial blood pressure was significantly lower in the carvedilol-treated SHR group (156+/-3 mmHg, n=17) than in an untreated SHR group (172+/-6 mmHg, n=13). Infusion of acetylcholine (2 microgram.min-1.kg-1) caused similar significant reductions in blood pressure in the two groups (-13+/-1% and -14+/-2%). However, acetylcholine induced a significant increase in total peripheral vascular resistance in the carvedilol group (29+/-10%, P<0.01), whereas no significant change was observed in the control group (0+/-11%).3. Acetylcholine significantly increased renal vascular resistance in the carvedilol group (+62+/-15%, P<0.01), but did not change vascular resistance in the control group (-6+/-6%). In the heart, acetylcholine did not affect vascular resistance in the carvedilol group, but reduced vascular resistance significantly in the control group (-17+/-8%, P<0.05). The circulatory changes induced by acetylcholine in the skeletal muscle, brain and ophthalmic circulation did not differ between the groups.4. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that long-term oral carvedilol treatment in the SHR did not enhance acetylcholine-induced vasodilatation, but instead pronounced renal vasoconstriction was induced by acetylcholine, which could partly be due to a decreased cardiac index.", 
    "40": "The dissociating and/or residual inhibitory effects of bopindolol from beta-adrenoceptors of atria strips pretreated with this drug which was then washed out with buffers on the responses to isoprenaline were determined and compared with those of propranolol, pindolol, atenolol, and the two active metabolites of bopindolol: 18-502 and 20-785. Low concentrations of bopindolol (10(-9) to 10(-8) mol/l) and the active metabolite 18-502 (10(-9) mol/l) produced rightward shifts of the concentration-response curves. On the other hand, high concentrations of bopindolol (10(-7) mol/l) and metabolite 18-502 (10(-8) and 10(-7) mol/l) produced a reduced maximum response by isoprenaline, suggesting that these nonparallel rightward shifts have pD2 values of 7.57 (bopindolol) and 7.67 (18-502), respectively, at 0 min after washout with buffers. Pindolol (10(-7) mol/l) and propranolol (10(-7) and 10(-8) mol/l) also produced a rightward shift of isoprenaline response curves, and these concentration-response curves in guinea pig atria strips pretreated with pindolol (10(-7) mol/l) and propranolol (10(-6) mol/l) recovered to control levels. Neither of these drugs, however, reduced the maximum response by isoprenaline. A high concentration (10(-5) mol/l) of atenolol was required for a rightward shift of the isoprenaline concentration-response curve, and this drug also did not reduce the maximum response. Thus, we conclude that bopindolol and metabolite 18-502 slowly dissociate and act as noncompetitive beta-antagonists rather than easily reversible beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "41": "Pharmacological inhibition of carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPT-I), the enzyme controlling the rate of fatty acid transport into the mitochondria, prevents the contractile dysfunction, myosin isozyme shift and deterioration in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ handling that occurs in rat models of left ventricular hypertrophy. In this study we examine whether the improved cardiac function with beta blockade therapy in heart failure is associated with an alteration in CPT-I activity.", 
    "42": "We examined dogs with coronary microembolism-induced heart failure treated for 12 weeks with metoprolol (25 mg twice daily). Myocardial activities of CPT-I, medium-chain acyl co-enzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD, a beta-oxidation enzyme), citrate synthase, and triglyceride content were measured. The progressive decrease in cardiac function was prevented by treatment with metoprolol, as reflected by an improved ejection fraction over 12 weeks in the metoprolol group (from 35% to 40%) compared to the untreated heart failure dogs (decrease from 36% to 26%). Dogs treated with metoprolol had a marked decrease in CPT-I activity (0.46 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.64 +/- 0.02 micromol min(-1) g(-1) wet weight; P < .02) along with an increase in triglyceride concentration compared to untreated heart failure dogs (3.9 +/- 0.3 v 4.9 +/- 0.2 micromol/g wet weight, respectively; P < .003). By contrast, MCAD and citrate synthase activities did not change.", 
    "43": "Metoprolol induced a decrease in CPT-I activity and an increase in triglyceride content. These results suggest that the improved function observed with beta blockers in heart failure could be due, in part, to a decrease in CPT-I activity and less fatty acid oxidation by the heart.", 
    "44": "Whole body O2 uptake (VO2) during maximal and submaximal exercise has been shown to be preserved in the setting of beta-adrenergic blockade at high altitude, despite marked reductions in heart rate during exercise. An increase in stroke volume at high altitude has been suggested as the mechanism that preserves systemic O2 delivery (blood flow x arterial O2 content) and thereby maintains VO2 at sea-level values. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of nonselective beta-adrenergic blockade on submaximal exercise performance in 11 normal men (26 +/- 1 yr) at sea level and on arrival and after 21 days at 4,300 m. Six subjects received propranolol (240 mg/day), and five subjects received placebo. At sea level, during submaximal exercise, cardiac output and O2 delivery were significantly lower in propranolol- than in placebo-treated subjects. Increases in stroke volume and O2 extraction were responsible for the maintenance of VO2. At 4,300 m, beta-adrenergic blockade had no significant effect on VO2, ventilation, alveolar PO2, and arterial blood gases during submaximal exercise. Despite increases in stroke volume, cardiac output and thereby O2 delivery were still reduced in propranolol-treated subjects compared with subjects treated with placebo. Further reductions in already low levels of mixed venous O2 saturation were responsible for the maintenance of VO2 on arrival and after 21 days at 4,300 m in propranolol-treated subjects. Despite similar workloads and VO2, propranolol-treated subjects exercised at greater perceived intensity than subjects given placebo at 4,300 m. The values for mixed venous O2 saturation during submaximal exercise in propranolol-treated subjects at 4,300 m approached those reported at simulated altitudes >8,000 m. Thus beta-adrenergic blockade at 4,300 m results in significant reduction in O2 delivery during submaximal exercise due to incomplete compensation by stroke volume for the reduction in exercise heart rate. Total body VO2 is maintained at a constant level by an interaction between mixed venous O2 saturation, the arterial O2-carrying capacity, and hemodynamics during exercise with acute and chronic hypoxia.", 
    "45": "Esmolol, a short-acting beta1-receptor antagonist, decreases anesthetic requirements during propofol/N2O/morphine anesthesia. This study was designed to determine whether esmolol affects the volatile anesthetic (isoflurane) required to prevent movement to skin incision in 50% patients (minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration [MAC]) with or without an additional opioid (alfentanil). One hundred consenting adult patients were randomly divided into five treatment groups: isoflurane alone (I), I with continuous large-dose (250 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) esmolol (E), I with alfentanil (effect site target of 50 ng/mL) via a continuous computer-controlled infusion (A), A plus continuous small-dose (50 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) esmolol (A1), or A plus large-dose esmolol (A2). Anesthesia was induced via a face mask, and steady-state target end-tidal isoflurane concentrations were maintained before incision. The MAC of isoflurane alone was 1.28% +/- 0.13%. Large-dose esmolol did not significantly alter the isoflurane MAC (1.23% +/- 0.14%). Alfentanil alone significantly decreased isoflurane MAC by 25% (0.96% +/-0.09%). Adding small-dose esmolol did not further decrease MAC with alfentanil (0.96% +/- 0.13%). However, large-dose esmolol significantly decreased isoflurane MAC with alfentanil (0.74% +/- 0.09%). Esmolol and alfentanil both significantly reduced the increases in heart rate and mean arterial pressure associated with endotracheal intubation and incision. The mechanism of this effect is unknown.",

    "47": "The role of the posterior atrial ganglionated plexus (PAGP) in heart rate (HR) control was tested in unanesthetized dogs (n = 8). Resting HR was unchanged before (85 +/- 20 beats/min, mean +/- SD) versus after (87 +/- 18 beats/min) surgical ablation of these intrinsic cardiac ganglia (PAGPX). However, the peak tachycardia to a 30-s stressful stimulus was significantly increased (P < 0.05) from +53 +/- 22 beats/min before the denervation to +77 +/- 13 beats/min after PAGPX. Conversely, the peak HR increase during the stress after beta-adrenergic blockade was the same before (36 +/- 24 beats/min) versus after (38 +/- 14 beats/min) PAGPX. Moreover, the HR response to a neutral behavioral stimulus, which is mediated primarily by withdrawal of parasympathetic inhibition of the sinoatrial (SA) node, was unaltered by PAGPX. Thus the augmented tachycardia subsequent to PAGPX was attributable primarily to increased sympathetic action at the SA node. These findings indicate that a major role of PAGP parasympathetic neurons is to inhibit sympathoexcitatory effects on HR, probably either via interactions between neurons comprising the intrinsic plexus(es) or perhaps via presynaptic inhibition of sympathetic neurotransmitter release. This organization would allow parasympathetic ganglia within the PAGP to selectively modify sympathetic input to the SA node independent of direct vagal inhibition of pacemaker activity.", 
    "48": "We describe a method for evaluating the value of increased cost of pharmacological augmentation that, taken for 6 weeks, accelerates the action of an antidepressant. We test the hypothesis that, if onset of action is taken into account, any added direct costs of the augmenting agent are offset by longer term cost effectiveness. Data to illustrate the method were based on a double-blind randomized placebo controlled study, in which 80 patients originally took part. Patients received the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant paroxetine and an augmenting agent (pindolol) or placebo. After 6 weeks, patients were offered SSRI alone on an open label basis for up to 6 months. At that point they were discharged to their general practitioner or local psychiatric services and subsequently assessed by us at one year. We have used techniques of decision analysis, cost effectiveness and cost benefit and have included a sensitivity analysis. The direct costs over one year of SSRI and augmenting agent, if taking the acceleration effect into account, represented greater cost effectiveness than the SSRI antidepressant alone. The cost effectiveness analysis was positive in both cases. We conclude that the direct costs of treatment are higher than those of previous calculated with SSRIs; but the rate of onset must be taken into account. The application of the model appears valid and useful, and may be used as part of the evaluation of other augmentation regimes.", 
    "49": "The objective of our study was an assessment of outcome in a 1 year 'real world', prospective follow-up study of patients who were treated with paroxetine 20 mg plus pindolol 7.5 mg or paroxetine 20 mg plus placebo for 6 weeks. Eighty patients recruited to a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized 6 weeks study of paroxetine and pindolol were followed up for 6 months and interviewed after 1 year. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the patients who relapsed having taken paroxetine and pindolol, compared with those who relapsed having taken paroxetine and placebo, shows that the pindolol group had a better clinical outcome. After 1 year patients who had responded to medication by 2 weeks had done better than the rest and they had been more compliant with medication for 6 months. There are indications that the earlier a patient responds to medication, the better the long-term outcome.",

The monolayers were perfused with media while fluid flow, expressed as hydraulic conductivity (HC = microl/min/mm Hg/cm2), was continuously measured in preparations treated with isoproterenol, epinephrine, or control medium. Morphometric ultrastructural methods were used to measure the area occupied by the intercellular space and by each cell.", 
    "53": "SCE cells and TM cells exposed to isoproterenol or epinephrine responded with an increase in transendothelial fluid flow. Dose-response curves for both adrenergic agonists showed that HC increased linearly as a function of the log of the isoproterenol and epinephrine concentration. At 10(-4) M isoproterenol, the HC increased threefold, and threshold conditions were reached at 10(-9) M. The increase in HC was apparent after isoproterenol had been applied for 1 hour, reached a peak in 3 to 4 hours, and declined gradually to return to baseline conditions in 10 to 12 hours. Morphometric analyses showed that the area occupied by the intercellular space increased fourfold when isoproterenol was used at 10(-4) M, whereas the cell area decreased as a function of the concentration of adrenergic agonist. Epinephrine's effects on HC and cell morphology were blocked by pretreatment with equimolar concentrations of the nonselective beta-blocker, timolol.",

    "55": "The activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) as well as the activities of other antioxidative enzymes: CuZn superoxide dismutase (CuZn SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR) in erythrocytes, as well as the activity of plasma glutathione transferase (GST), and the plasma content of vitamins E and C were evaluated in 35 sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) patients. The results revealed significantly decreased activity of both GSH-Px and CuZn SOD in sALS patients compared with the control. These data showed that a disturbed oxidative/antioxidative balance in sALS patients exists not only in motoneurons but also in the blood. The effect of exogenously administered selenium (Se), antioxidants, amino acids, a Ca2+ channel blocker such as nimodipine, and their combination in Alsamin was evaluated by screening parameter levels after 9 weeks of treatment. Only the use of all components together enhanced the activity of GSH-Px and the amount of vitamin E in sALS patients. Judging by the results of clinical trials, this treatment slowed the course of the disease.", 
    "56": "The effects of 2 fixed antihypertensive combination drugs on blood pressure and aortic elastic properties were compared in 2 parallel groups. Twenty-six patients for 6 months received a calcium antagonist plus ACE inhibitor (verapamil SR 180 mg/trandolapril 1 mg (Vera/Tran)) and 25 patients a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist plus diuretic (metoprolol 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (Meto/HCTZ)). In addition to blood pressure (SBP, DBP), carotidofemoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed non-invasively. Total peripheral resistance (TPR) was determined from cardiac output derived by electrical impedance cardiography. Sitting DBP decreased for -14.4 mmHg following Vera/Tran compared with -9.2 mmHg following Meto/HCTZ (p = 0.02 for difference between treatments). Blood pressure was normalized (i.e. DBP < 90 mmHg) in 69% of patients with Vera/Tran and in 52% with Meto/HCTZ. PWV was lowered with Vera/Tran to a higher extent than with Meto/HCTZ (differences between group means -0.46 to -0.98 m/sec, statistically not significant). Vera/Tran induced a decrease in TPR of about 15% of baseline values, whereas Meto/HCTZ showed no influence. Treatment-related adverse events following Meto/HCTZ were bradycardia and associated symptoms; following Vera/Tran these were cough and edema in 1 case each. In the Meto/HCTZ group, there were more withdrawals/drop-outs (9/25) than in the Vera/Tran group (2/26). The somewhat more intense reduction in PWV with Vera/Tran is indicative of an increase in aortic elastic properties associated with the more potent decrease in BP. In the present study, the combination of calcium antagonist plus ACE inhibitor was found to be an effective and well tolerated antihypertensive regimen and in these respects appears to have some advantages compared with a combination of beta-blocker plus diuretic.", 
    "57": "The new beta3-adrenoceptor is present in the gastrointestinal tract of various species. This study aimed to show that this receptor modulates human colonic motility in vitro. We used circular muscle strips from the human colon suspended in single organ baths containing Krebs solution and subjected to an initial 1.5-2 g tension. We measured the effects of different beta3-adrenoceptor agonists, including SR 59104A (N-[(6-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-(2R)-2-yl)methyl]-(2 R)-2-hydroxy-2-(3-chlorophenyl)ethanamine hydrochloride), SR 59119A (N-[(7-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-(2R)-2-yl)methyl]-(2R) -2-hydroxy-2-(3-chlorophenyl)ethanamine hydrochloride), BRL 37344 (R,R + S,S) [4-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]-amino] propyl] phenoxy] acetic acid), and of isoprenaline and salbutamol in the absence or in the presence of propranolol alone or in combination with the beta3-adrenoceptor antagonist SR 59230A (3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1-[(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalen-1- ylamino]-(2S)-2-propanol oxalate) on amplitude of spontaneous contractions. To evaluate a possible beta2-adrenoceptor-mediated effect, we studied the action of these compounds on human isolated bronchi. On the human isolated colon, SR 59119A, SR 59104A and isoprenaline reduced the initial amplitude of spontaneous contractions by 60%. The curves obtained in the presence of antagonists suggested an action mediated by beta3-adrenoceptor stimulation, since propranolol did not antagonize the action of SR 59119A and SR 59104A, whereas the combination of propranolol and SR 59230A significantly displaced the concentration-response curve of these agonists to the right. This study provides pharmacological evidence of modulation of human colonic motility, and especially of the amplitude of spontaneous contractions, by the atypical beta-adrenoceptor, the beta3-adrenoceptor.", 
    "58": "S-1'-[18F]fluorocarazolol (S-(-)-4-(2-hydroxy-3-(1'-[18F]fluoroisopropyl)-aminopropoxy)carba zole, a non-subtype-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) has been investigated for in vivo studies of beta-adrenoceptors. Previous results indicated that uptake of this radioligand in heart and lung can be inhibited by beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists. In the present study, blocking, displacement and saturation experiments were performed in rats, in combination with metabolite analysis to investigate the suitability of this radioligand for in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and quantification of beta-adrenoceptors in the brain. The results demonstrate that, (i) the uptake of S-1'-[18F]fluorocarazolol reflects specific binding to beta-adrenoceptors, (ii) binding of S-1'-[18F]fluorocarazolol to atypical or non-beta-adrenergic sites is negligible, (iii) uptake of radioactive metabolites in the brain is less than 25% of total radioactivity, 60 min after injection, (iv) in vivo measurements of receptor densities (Bmax) in cortex, cerebellum, heart, lung and erythrocytes are within range of densities determined from in vitro assays, (v) binding of S-1'-[18F]fluorocarazolol can be displaced. In conclusion, S-1'-[18F]fluorocarazolol seems to possess the appropriate characteristics to visualize and quantify beta-adrenoceptors in vivo in the central nervous system using PET.", 
    "59": "Beta-adrenergic receptors (ARs) are expressed predominantly in adipose tissue, and beta3-selective agonists are effective anti-obesity drugs in rodents. Rodent and human beta3-ARs differ with respect to expression in white versus brown adipocytes as well as their ability to be stimulated by beta3-AR-selective agonists. Humans express beta3-AR mRNA abundantly in brown but not white adipocytes, while rodents express beta3-AR mRNA abundantly in both sites. To determine the basis for this difference, we have transgenically introduced 74 kilobases (kb) of human beta3-AR genomic sequence into gene knockout mice lacking beta3-ARs. Importantly, human beta3-AR mRNA was expressed only in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of transgenic mice, with little or no expression being detected in white adipose tissue (WAT), liver, stomach, small intestine, skeletal muscle, and heart. This pattern of expression differed from that observed in mice bearing a murine beta3-AR genomic transgene in which beta3-AR mRNA was expressed in both WAT and BAT, but not in other sites. Furthermore, we have transgenically introduced smaller human constructs containing -14.5 and -0.6 kb of upstream sequence into beta3-AR gene knockout mice. Both -14.5 and -0.6 kb constructs were expressed in BAT but not WAT. Thus, human but not murine cis-regulatory elements direct beta3-AR gene expression preferentially to brown adipocytes. Identification of responsible cis-regulatory element(s) and relevant trans-acting factor(s) should provide insight into mechanisms controlling human beta3-AR gene expression. In addition, the beta3-AR agonist, CGP-12177, stimulated oxygen consumption in mice expressing human but not murine beta3-ARs by 91% compared with only 49% in control beta3-AR gene knockout mice, demonstrating that the human beta3-AR can functionally couple with energy expenditure. These \"humanized\" mice should assist us in the development of drugs that may become effective anti-obesity agents in humans.", 
    "60": "The beta cell KATP channel is an octameric complex of four pore-forming subunits (Kir6.2) and four regulatory subunits (SUR1). A truncated isoform of Kir6.2 (Kir6.2DeltaC26), which expresses independently of SUR1, shows intrinsic ATP sensitivity, suggesting that this subunit is primarily responsible for mediating ATP inhibition. We show here that mutation of C166, which lies at the cytosolic end of the second transmembrane domain, to serine (C166S) increases the open probability of Kir6.2DeltaC26 approximately sevenfold by reducing the time the channel spends in a long closed state. Rundown of channel activity is also decreased. Kir6.2DeltaC26 containing the C166S mutation shows a markedly reduced ATP sensitivity: the Ki is reduced from 175 microM to 2.8 mM. Substitution of threonine, alanine, methionine, or phenylalanine at position C166 also reduced the channel sensitivity to ATP and simultaneously increased the open probability. Thus, ATP does not act as an open channel blocker. The inhibitory effects of tolbutamide are reduced in channels composed of SUR1 and Kir6.2 carrying the C166S mutation. Our results are consistent with the idea that C166 plays a role in the intrinsic gating of the channel, possibly by influencing a gate located at the intracellular end of the pore. Kinetic analysis suggests that the apparent decrease in ATP sensitivity, and the changes in other properties, observed when C166 is mutated is largely a consequence of the impaired transition from the open to the long closed state.",

    "62": "Polymer erosion of matrices of similarly substituted hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) polymers was examined, and drug release in terms of diffusion and erosion contributions was characterized, focusing on matrices containing either polymer alone or a drug content of 25% level with no added excipients. A novel approach was utilized to separate diffusional and erosional contributions to drug release. Diffusional drug release was determined by fitting release data versus (time)0.45, and the drug release due to erosion was quantified by subtracting the percent predicted for diffusional drug release from the total drug release at each specific time point. Drug release resulting from polymer erosion was linear versus time and was found to be a function of the number average molecular weight of the polymer. In contrast, diffusional release rates were comparable for all HPMC grades studied and, thus, were independent of number average molecular weight of the polymers studied. Under stirring conditions of 10-100 rpm as well as static condition, the detachment of individual polymer chains at the matrix surface occurred at a faster rate relative to diffusion away from the matrix surface. The erosion study indicated that polymer diffusion of the HPMC polymer chains through the aqueous diffusion layer was the rate-limiting step for polymer erosion. In general, polymer erosion was found to be inversely related to the polymer number average molecular weight. A scaling law was used to relate polymer erosion rate with the respective polymer number average molecular weight. Similar relationships were obtained for matrices with and without drug at a stirring rate of 100 rpm.", 
    "63": "The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) controls the vascular system. It may contribute to postoperative hypertension observed upon emergence from anesthesia. This structure contains adrenergic cardiovascular neurons. Therefore, one question was addressed: does a change in RVLM catechol activity occur upon emergence from anesthesia? Halothane-anesthetized, paralyzed rats had their ventilatory, circulatory, and acid-base stability controlled. All pressure points and incisions were infiltrated with local anesthetic. With in vivo electrochemistry, a catechol signal was recorded in the RVLM in the following circumstances: (1) under stable halothane anesthesia for 120 minutes (halothane group), (2) during 120 minutes after halothane discontinuation (saline-emergence group), (3) during 60 minutes after halothane discontinuation followed by 60 minutes after halothane readministration (readministration group), (4) emergence in rats treated with atenolol and nitroprusside to hold blood pressure as close as possible to baseline, (5) emergence after morphine 1 mg.kg(-1) i.v., (6) emergence after decerebration, and (7) emergence upon recording in the mid-brain dopaminergic A10 area. Stable halothane anesthesia (n = 6) led to no change in mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and catechol signal (CAOC). During emergence from anesthesia (n = 6), MAP, HR, and catechol signal increased and did not return to baseline. By contrast, a return of MAP, HR, and catechol signal to baseline was observed upon readministration of halothane (n = 6). Whereas blood pressure and heart rate were maintained as closely as possible to baseline, a large catechol activation (n = 5) was observed upon emergence from anesthesia. A catechol activation from a lowered baseline was observed upon emergence following morphine administration (n = 5). A minor circulatory activation without RVLM catechol activation was observed upon emergence following decerebration (n = 5). Recordings in the A10 area revealed no increase in the catechol signal following emergence (n = 5). Adrenergic RVLM neurons appear to be responsive upon emergence from anesthesia, possibly being activated by suprapontine afferents impinging on the RVLM.",

This hypothesis is further supported by the finding in human subjects that blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors with propranolol selectively reduced memory for emotional events. In the present study, we compared the effects of propranolol, a lipid soluble drug which crosses the blood-brain barrier easily, with those of nadolol, a water soluble drug which crosses the blood-brain barrier to a considerably lesser extent, to determine whether the effect involved peripheral or central beta-adrenergic receptors. The effects of these drugs, taken before subjects watched a slide show that was either emotionally arousing or relatively neutral in content, were tested 1 week later with a surprise memory test. Consistent with previous results, propranolol impaired memory (recall and recognition) in the subjects who saw the emotional version of the slide show. In contrast, nadolol did not impair memory of the emotional slide show. These results indicate that the blockade of central beta-adrenergic receptors is responsible for the reduction in storage of emotional events. The results support the view that memory of a mild emotional event involves activation of central, but not necessarily peripheral beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "65": "The bioequivalence of oral dosage forms of oxprenolol was assessed in a triple crossover study on two groups of 12 volunteers each. Single 160 mg doses of oxprenolol hydrochloride were given after an overnight fast of either oxprenolol sustained-release tablets in a megaloporous system, a hydrophil matrix and Slow-Trasicor (Ciba-Geigy) in the first group, or floating slow-release tablets administered with food or in absence of food, and rapid release Oxprenolol (Terapia, Cluj-Napoca) tablets, in the second group. Serum oxprenolol concentrations were measured by a gas chromatographic method. Pharmacokinetic parameters which describe bioavailability and general kinetic behavior of the drug were calculated from individual serum profiles. They were subjected to statistical analysis (paired Student's t test, p < 0.05). The customary bioequivalence criterion was used: 0.8 < parameter ratio(tested/standard) < 1.2. Megaloporous tablets showed bioequivalence with the reference sustained release product Slow-Trasicor. Hydrophil tablets showed moderate sustained-release characteristics. Floating tablets showed significantly greater oxprenolol absorption when taken with food and were non-bioequivalent with floating tablets without food, as well as with the reference rapid release tablets, of oxprenolol. However, fasting tablets were bioequivalent to the Slow-Trasicor product, when taken with food.", 
    "66": "We report a case of pulmonary fibrosis in an infant receiving amiodarone for treatment of intractable atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia secondary to Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. At 9 months, a screening chest radiograph showed a diffuse interstitial infiltrate in an asymptomatic, thriving infant. Amiodarone was discontinued and the pulmonary fibrosis resolved gradually over 6 months. This case documents the first report of amiodarone induced pulmonary fibrosis in the pediatric age group. We speculate that as amiodarone is used more frequently to manage pediatric arrhythmias, pulmonary fibrosis, a known complication of this antiarrhythmia in adults may be seen with increasing frequency in children.", 
    "67": "The electrophysiological responses to (-)-CGP 12177 ((-)-4-(3-tertiarybutylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy) benzimidazol-2-one), an agonist for the putative beta4-adrenoceptor, were investigated on isolated perfused ferret hearts paced at 100 min(-1) and compared to those of (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline, mediated through beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors respectively. The three agonists decreased ventricular monophasic action potential duration but prolonged the action potential plateau; beta3-adrenoceptor-selective agonists had no effect. (-)-CGP 12177 was the most potent, but (-)-noradrenaline the most efficacious; both agonists caused ventricular extra-systoles. Because only (-)-noradrenaline but not (-)-CGP 12177 elicited shortening of the refractory period, the mechanism of arrhythmias mediated through beta1- and putative beta4-adrenoceptors may be different.", 
    "68": "Although diagnosis of neurally mediated syncope (NMS) using the head-up tilt (HUT) test has been established, the precise etiologic mechanism of NMS is still obscure. Previously, we reported the contribution of impaired alpha-adrenergic vascular response to syncope in patients with various arrhythmias. This study evaluates alpha-adrenergic vascular response in 21 NMS patients with syncope and a positive HUT test (80 degrees, 30 minutes, and low-dose isoproterenol, NMS group, mean age 31 +/- 14 years) and 21 control subjects (C group, 33 +/- 14 years) who had no evidence of syncope and no structural heart disease. After 30 minutes in a recumbent position, pharmacologic total autonomic blockade was attained using atropine and propranolol. Thereafter, increased systolic blood pressure with 0.4 microg/kg/min phenylephrine (designated as deltaBPphenyl) and decreased systolic blood pressure with 0.5 microg/kg/30 seconds of phentolamine (designated as deltaBPphent) were measured as indexes of alpha-adrenergic vascular sensitivity and activity, respectively. DeltaBPphenyl in the NMS group (70.0 +/- 37) was significantly less than that in C group (107 +/- 38, p <0.005). DeltaBPphent was significantly greater in the NMS group than in the C group (33.5 +/- 10 vs 21.0 +/- 14, p <0.005). Thus, decreased alpha-adrenergic vascular sensitivity and elevated alpha-adrenergic vascular tone were observed in patients with NMS. Although it is not known whether the mechanism causing NMS can be attributed to this abnormal alpha-adrenergic vascular response, the abnormality could at least contribute to augmenting the symptoms of NMS.", 
    "69": "The pharmacological modulation of the uptake of porphyrin derivatives in cultured C6 glioma cells was investigated by means of spectrofluorometric analysis both in single cells and in cell homogenates. The influence of drugs acting as beta-receptor agonists or antagonists was studied in cells grown to semiconfluency. Isoproterenol (ISO), a beta-receptor agonist, enhanced the intracellular fluorescence intensity of both Photofrin and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). A treatment with a beta-receptor antagonist I-propranolol (PRO), simultaneous with ISO, resulted in an intracellular Photofrin fluorescence signal comparable to that of the control cells, indicating the specificity of the pharmacological action. The pharmacological treatment seemed particularly effective with the aggregated species. This is suggested by the relative increase of the band at 670 nm, being greater than that in the 630 nm band in the emission spectra of Photofrin and PpIX, and by the comparison of the fluorescence intensity on cell homogenates measured both in the absence and in the presence of cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide as a detergent.",

    "74": "Carvedilol, a selective alpha1 and non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist and antioxidant, has been shown to provide significant cardiac protection in animal models of myocardial ischemia. To further explore the mechanisms contributing to carvedilol cardioprotection efficacy, the effects of carvedilol on hemodynamic variables, infarct size and myeloperoxidase activity (an index of neutrophil accumulation) were compared with a beta1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist, metoprolol. Carvedilol (1 mg/kg) or metoprolol (1 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg + 0.5 mg/kg 90 min later) was given intravenously 5 min before reperfusion. In vehicle-treated rabbits, ischemia (60 min) and reperfusion (180 min) resulted in significant increments in left ventricular end diastolic pressure, large infarcts (59+/-2.6% of area-at-risk) and marked increase in myeloperoxidase activity (0.59+/-0.09 U/100 mg tissue). Carvedilol treatment resulted in sustained reduction of pressure-rate-index and significantly smaller infarcts (22.0+/-2.5%, P < 0.01 vs. vehicle) as well as decreased myeloperoxidase activity (0.186+/-0.056 U/100 mg tissue, P < 0.01 vs. vehicle). The highest dose of metoprolol, 1 mg/kg + 0.5 mg/kg, that resulted in pressure-rate-index comparable to that of 1.0 mg/kg carvedilol, failed to reduce myeloperoxidase activity in the ischemic myocardial tissue, and the infarct size (35+/-3.1%) was significantly larger than in carvedilol-treated animals. Taken together, this study suggests that the superior cardioprotection of carvedilol over metoprolol is not a consequence of hemodynamic variances but possibly the result of the additional pharmacological properties of carvedilol such as the antioxidant and anti-neutrophil effects.", 
    "75": "The present study investigated the effects of acutely administered dihydroetorphine on mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation and lymphokine production in mice. These immune functions were significantly suppressed by dihydroetorphine at 24 microg/kg and 128 microg/kg in a dose-dependent fashion. This study further examined the involvement of micro-opioid receptors and alpha-adrenoceptors in the immunomodulatory effects of dihydroetorphine. The micro-opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (4 mg/kg), and alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine (10 mg/kg), but not the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (10 mg/kg), effectively blocked dihydroetorphine-induced suppression of splenic lymphocyte proliferation and lymphokine production. These results demonstrate that dihydroetorphine has significant immunosuppressive effects in mice and the mechanisms of these effects may lie in its interactions with opioid receptors and adrenergic pathways.", 
    "76": "High doses of propranolol inhibit phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAP) activity in intact cells, thus blocking metabolism of phosphatidic acid (PA), product of the phospholipase D (PLD) reaction. Vasopressin and phorbol ester activate PLD and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase) mitogen-activated protein kinases in A7r5, a rat vascular smooth muscle cell line. Propranolol increased PA levels in intact A7r5 cells and inhibited cytosolic PAP and membrane calcium-independent phospholipase A2 but did not activate PLD or enhance agonist-induced PA accumulation. Incubation of cells with 200 microM propranolol for 10-45 min markedly elevated PA but caused only partial activation of ERKs. Propranolol and other lipophilic amines caused a time- and dose-dependent detachment of cells from their substrate. These results confirm that elevation of PA is not a strong signal for ERK activation and emphasize that caution should be exercised in using propranolol as a PAP inhibitor in intact cells.",

    "78": "Four separate protocols were performed in 47 subjects. SAAQ waveforms were used to assess alterations in LV function induced by dobutamine (15 microg/kg per minute) and esmolol (200 microg/kg per minute) in eight normal subjects. Subsequently, we analyzed SAAQ waveforms obtained in 12 patients with LV dysfunction secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy and 12 age-matched normal subjects. Finally, we developed computer software for monitoring of LV function on the basis of continuous acquisition and repeated analysis of SAAQ waveforms. We compared the interbeat variability in indexes of LV function obtained from raw AQ and SAAQ during 10 minutes of steady-state monitoring in eight patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography. The feasibility of long-term monitoring in the intensive care setting was then studied in seven patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Our analysis tracked variations in LV function induced by dobutamine and esmolol. Significant differences in all measured indexes were found between normal subjects and patients with dilated cadiomyopathy. Signal averaging during steady-state monitoring significantly reduced the interbeat variability of all indexes (21% to 42%). In the operating room, the SAAQ monitoring system tracked hemodynamic changes in close agreement with invasive measurements.",

    "80": "Chronic treatment of rats with a variety of antidepressants results in the down-regulation of beta-1-adrenoceptors in the amygdaloid nuclei. The present study sought to determine if this specific neurochemical effect caused an alteration in inhibitory avoidance conditioning, a behavior considered to be mediated by beta-adrenoceptors in the amygdala. Rats treated chronically with either desipramine (DMI) or phenelzine (PHEN), which down-regulate beta-1-adrenoceptors in the amygdala, or fluoxetine (FLUOX), which does not do this, did not exhibit a deficit in the retention of the inhibitory avoidance task. However, when scopolamine was given prior to acquisition of the task in a dose that, by itself, did not affect retention, DMI- and PHEN-treated rats showed a marked deficit in retention. This effect was also observed after acute administration of these drugs, although they did not down-regulate amygdaloid beta-1-adrenoceptors at this time. It seems that the ability of these antidepressants to potentiate the amnesic effect of scopolamine is unrelated to their effect on beta-1-adrenoceptor number in the amygdala and that the extent of the antidepressant-induced amygdaloid beta-1-adrenoceptor down-regulation is not sufficient, by itself, to cause a deficit in an inhibitory avoidance task.", 
    "81": "Beta-blockers and vasodilators, such as nitrates and calcium channel blockers, are all established antianginal therapies. These therapies have different antianginal mechanisms that dictate both their mode of action and their side-effect profile. An agent with both cardiac beta- and vascular alpha-receptor activity offers advantages over these conventional drugs. Carvedilol, a multiple-action neurohormonal antagonist, has potent antihypertensive and antianginal activity. Through its combination of pharmacological mechanisms, it reduces myocardial oxygen demand, increases myocardial blood supply and scavenges oxygen free radicals, which are capable of ischaemic damage. Studies have shown that carvedilol is at least as effective as other antianginal therapies in the management of chronic stable angina. Carvedilol is well tolerated--in several cases, the overall incidence of adverse events being lower than with other antianginal agents. These properties, combined with the documented antianginal effects, suggest that carvedilol may prove useful for the treatment of patients with chronic stable angina.",

There was significant variation by state, ranging from 30.3% to 77.1 %. Of the 36795 patients who were not receiving beta-blocker therapy on admission, 16006 (43.5%) had therapy initiated on or before discharge. Demographic and clinical variables explained relatively little of the variation in the initiation of beta-blocker therapy. The prescribed use of calcium channel blockers at discharge had a strong negative association with the use of beta-blockers (odds ratio [OR] of beta-blocker use, 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.26). The New England region had significantly higher use of beta-blocker therapy than the rest of the country. Compared with cardiologists, internists had similar rates (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-1.00) and general and family practice physicians had lower rates (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.73-0.83). After adjusting for potential confounders, beta-blockers were associated with a 14% lower risk of mortality at 1 year after discharge. The association with lower mortality was present in subgroups stratified by age, sex, and left ventricular ejection fraction.", 
    "89": "Many ideal patients for beta-blocker therapy are not prescribed these drugs at discharge following AMI. The clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients do not explain much of the variation in the treatment pattern. Geographic factors and physician specialty are independently associated with the decision to use beta-blockers. Elderly patients who are prescribed beta-blockers at discharge have a better survival rate, consistent with the findings of randomized controlled trials of younger and lower-risk populations.", 
    "90": "Experimental evidence suggests that, by stimulating energy expenditure in brown fat, selective beta3-adrenoceptor agonists can reduce body weight in obese rodents. In order to investigate further the physiological role of beta3-adrenoceptors in brown adipocytes, we analysed the effects of selective beta3-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on uncoupling protein-1 and leptin gene expression in culture-differentiated brown fat cells. Our main findings were that: (i) the leptin gene is expressed in brown adipocytes; (ii) the selective beta3-adrenoceptor agonist, N[(2S)-7-carbethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphth-2-yl]-(2R)-2-hydroxy- 2-(3-chlorophenil)ethanamine hydrochloride (SR58611A), inhibits leptin gene while inducing uncoupling protein-1 gene expression; (iii) these opposite effects of SR58611A are antagonized by the selective beta3-adrenoceptor antagonist, SS-enantiomer 3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1-(1S),2,3,4-tetrahydronaphth-1-ylamin ol]-(2S)-2-propanol oxalate (SR59230A), but not by the selective beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist (+/-)-[2-(3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxyphenoxy)-ethylamino]-3-[4(1-methyl- 4-trifluoromethyl-2-imidazolyl)-phenoxy]-2 propanol (CGP20712A); and (iv) these effects are due to increased cyclic AMP levels. These results confirm by means of a different experimental approach that beta3-adrenoceptors play a central role in controlling the expression of genes that are important for brown fat function.", 
    "91": "The realisation that pindolol may accelerate the effects of some antidepressant drugs in clinical trials has added extra impetus to the search for faster acting antidepressants. Currently, no animal model of depression can identify potential faster acting antidepressant drugs or drug combinations. In this study, we investigate the effects of combining pindolol (2 mg/kg, s.c., bid) with the antidepressant paroxetine (2.5 mg/kg, i.p., bid) in the olfactory bulbectomised rat, an animal model of chronic (but not acute) antidepressant activity. Ambulation scores were measured in separate groups of rats, following 3, 7 and 14 days of treatment. Further, we simultaneously study adaptive changes in 5-HT1A receptor function, utilising alterations in the hypothermic response to the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). Pindolol in combination with paroxetine attenuated the hypothermic effects of 8-OH-DPAT as early as 3 days with a full reversal evident following 7 days, whereas paroxetine alone did so after 14 days only. Likewise, paroxetine alone reversed the olfactory bulbectomy-induced hyperactivity in the open field following 14 days of treatment only, this being the normal time of an 'antidepressant' response in this model. However, the group treated with both paroxetine and pindolol failed to reverse the hyperactive response. This suggests that a factor intrinsic to pindolol antagonises the behavioural effects of paroxetine in the olfactory bulbectomised rat. It also demonstrates that the reversal of this aspect of the olfactory bulbectomy-induced behavioural syndrome is insensitive to the potential faster onset of antidepressant action induced by pindolol. The ability of the combination group to attenuate the hypothermic effects of 8-OH-DPAT much faster further emphasises the role of the 5-HT1A receptor in the mechanism of action of antidepressants and as a target for the development of faster acting antidepressants. However, an animal model sensitive to the effects of any such compound and the actions of pindolol remains elusive.", 
    "92": "To examine whether and how local somatothermal stimulation inhibits the function of the sphincter of Oddi (SO) in humans and in animals with different types of SO, we measured the activity of SO in anesthetized cats and rabbits by using continuously perfused open-tip manometric methods. Local somatothermal stimulation was achieved by applying an electroheating rod 0.5 cm away from the skin area near the right subcostal region. A heating pad was applied to the corresponding area in patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and biliary manometry. The motility of the biliary tract in cats, in terms of gall bladder pressure, tonic and phasic contraction pressure and frequency of SO before and during local heat were significantly different, respectively. The local heat-induced SO relaxation was not inhibited by pretreatment with atropine, propranolol, phentolamine or anti-cholecystokinin-octapeptide, but was almost completely blocked by infiltration of local anesthetics. Pretreatment with a nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor also blocked the relaxation, which was reversed by pretreatment with L-arginine, but not by D-arginine. The inhibition of SO motility by local heat in rabbits was also blocked by pretreatment with L-NAME, and this blockade was reversed by L-arginine. Application of local heat on patients demonstrated obvious inhibitory SO responses. We conclude that local somatothermal stimulation inhibits the SO motility in animals with different types of SO through the activation of heat-sensitive neural release of nitric oxide. This procedure may represent a simplified approach for the treatment of diseases with hypofunction of the L-arginine/NO pathway.",

We performed a retrospective cohort study among 105,824 enrollees of the Tennessee Medicaid program 65 years of age or older between 1984 and 1986. Exposure to calcium channel blockers and other medications was determined from pharmacy files. Hospitalization for bleeding peptic ulcers was identified by hospital claims and verified by a review of the medical record. Univariate estimates of relative risk for current users of calcium channel blockers and beta-blocker users were 1.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-2.7) and 1.1 (95% CI 0.7-1.6) (reference group was nonuse of either). After adjustment for potential confounders, the relative risks for bleeding peptic ulcer among current users of calcium channel blockers and beta blockers were 1.1 (95% CI 0.7-1.7) and 1.0 (95% CI 0.7-1.6), respectively, when compared with those who used neither drug.

The European Myocardial Infarct Amiodarone Trial (EMIAT) did not show a mortality benefit, but amiodarone was associated with fewer antiarrhythmic deaths. The Canadian Amiodarone Myocardial Infarction Trial (CAMIAT) showed no significant impact on mortality, but arrhythmia deaths and resuscitated cardiac deaths were reduced.

Beta-blockers are the treatment of choice. (2) In the long QT syndromes (LQTS), malfunction of ion channels leads to prolonged ventricular repolarization, early afterdepolarizations, and triggered ventricular arrhythmias. Therapeutic options include: beta-blockers, genotype-specific therapy, cardiac sympathetic denervation, and implantation of pacemakers or defibrillators. (3) The \"short-coupled variant of torsade de pointes\" is a malignant disease that shares several characteristics with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. Although verapamil is frequently recommended, mortality rates remain high. (4) Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) with normal electrocardiogram (ECG) strikes young adults of both genders. In contrast to other polymorphic tachyarrhythmias, idiopathic VF is not generally related to stress. Also, familial involvement is rare. Therapeutic options include implantation of defibrillators and therapy with class 1A drugs. (5) The \"Brugada syndrome\" and the \"syndrome of nocturnal sudden death\" strike males almost exclusively. Right bundle branch block (RBBB) with ST elevation in the right precordial leads-the \"Brugada sign\"--is seen in the ECG of both patient populations.

    "113": "Patients with Mahaim fibres form a distinct subgroup of the pre-excitation syndromes (less than 3%). They have episodes of a pre-excitation during sinus rhythm. Originally, Mahaim fibres have been classified into two main groups, nodoventricular and fasciculoventricular fibres. Recent evidence from both surgery and catheter ablation has shown that the substrate for tachycardia arises due to a slowly conducting fright atrioventricular (AV) accessory pathway (AP) with decremental properties. The pre-excited tachycardia (antidromic re-entrant tachycardia) is distinctive with a left bundle branch block (LBBB) pattern, long AV interval (due to the long conduction time over the AP) and short VA interval (over the AV node). The majority of these patients do not have episodes of narrow QRS complex, due to the absence of retrograde conduction of the AP. There are several ECG features that suggest Mahaim tachycardia as a cause of LBBB pattern tachycardia: QRS axis superior or between 0 degrees and 75 degrees, QRS duration of 0.15 s or less and precordial transition in lead V4 or after. Clinically, Ebstein's anomaly is relatively common and multiple APs are also observed with an increased frequency. Small studies and cases reports have demonstrated sensitivity to various classes of AA drugs. Class IA, IC and beta-blocker may be effective in preventing tachycardias. Small surgical series have reported excellent results in patients with accessory AV connections and Mahaim fibres tachycardia. However catheter ablation offers a definitive therapy in such patients with a high success rate and minimal morbidity.",

    "115": "In a retrospective analysis of a prospective randomized trial, a model for risk prediction was determined based on clinical data of the control group (A; n = 107) and tested in a test group (B; n = 107, treated with low dose sotalol). Using this algorithm, the effect of a 'selective' antiarrhythmic approach in high-risk patients was compared to a 'non-selective' approach, where all patients were treated. In total, 75 (35%) patients developed atrial fibrillation and 14 (7%) side-effects led to discontinuation of study medication. Based on the risk prediction algorithm, 36% of group A patients were classified as high-risk patients with an incidence of atrial fibrillation of 76% compared to 26% in low-risk patients (P < 0.0001). The selective approach, i.e. treatment of high-risk patients only reduced the incidence of atrial fibrillation from 76% to 50% (P = 0.0295) compared to a reduction from 44% to 26% (P = 0.0065) when all patients were treated. More importantly, with the non-selective approach 100% of patients were exposed to the possible side-effects of sotalol and costs compared to 24% only with the selective approach (P < 0.0001).",

    "117": "We have previously investigated, in studies of rat distal colonic mucosa, the effect of ATP added to the basolateral side on ion transport and [Ca2+]i. It was demonstrated that ATP acts via a P2Y1 receptor to increase [Ca2+]i and NaCl secretion. In the present study we investigated the effect of luminally added nucleotides (ATP, UTP) on transepithelial voltage (Vte) and resistance (Rte) in Ussing chamber experiments on rat distal colonic mucosa. Both nucleotides induced a rapid and transient (within 30 s) change of Vte to lumen-positive values (resting Vte: -2+/-1 mV; peak Vte after 100 micromol/l ATP: +2.4+/-1.1 mV) and a decrease of Rte from 89. 9+/-10.3 to 83.8+/-9.1 Omegacm2 (n=10). Similar values were obtained with luminal UTP (n=15). The estimated EC50 values for both nucleotides were approximately 6 micromol/l. The ATP-induced Vte effect was nearly completely sensitive to Ba2+. Addition of the K+ channel blocker Ba2+ (1 mmol/l) to the luminal solution reversibly inhibited 77+/-4% (n=5) of the ATP-induced Vte effect. Experiments to identify the respective P2 receptor subtype revealed the following rank order of potency at 500 micromol/l agonist: UTP>/=ATP>2-methylthio-ATP=ADP>adenosine> AMP>beta, gamma-methylene-ATP (n=5). This closely resembles the published rank order for the P2Y2 receptor. Using the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique P2Y2 receptor-specific mRNA was detected in total RNA extracted from isolated crypts. In summary these data indicate that luminal ATP and UTP act via a P2Y2 receptor in the luminal membrane of colonic mucosa to elicit a transient K+ secretion.", 
    "118": "In most studies, coupling of the beta2-adrenoceptor (beta2AR) to the stimulatory, heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein of adenylyl cyclase the (Gs) is studied indirectly by measuring adenylyl cyclase activation. The aim of this study was to establish a model system in which beta2AR-Gs interactions can be studied directly at the level of the G-protein. We expressed the beta2AR alone, in combination with the alpha-subunit of Gs (G(s alpha)), and as fusion protein with G(s alpha) (beta2AR-G(s alpha)) in Sf9 insect cells. The beta2AR expressed alone couples poorly to the endogenous G(s alpha)-like G-protein of Sf9 cells since no high-affinity agonist binding could be detected, and the effects of agonist and inverse agonist on adenylyl cyclase, high-affinity GTPase and guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP[S]) binding were small. Beta2AR-G(s alpha) reconstituted high-affinity agonist binding and regulated adenylyl cyclase more effectively than the beta2AR co-expressed with a large excess of G(s alpha). In membranes expressing beta2AR-G(s alpha), highly effective agonist- and inverse agonist regulation of high-affinity GTP hydrolysis and GTP[S] binding was observed. In contrast, agonist and inverse agonist regulation of GTP hydrolysis and GTP[S] binding in membranes expressing beta2AR and G(s alpha) as separate proteins was difficult to detect. Our data show that the beta2AR interacts with G(s alpha) more efficiently when expressed as a fusion protein than when expressed with an excess of non-fused G(s alpha). The beta2AR-G(s alpha) fusion protein provides a very sensitive model system to study the regulation of Gs function by beta2AR agonists and inverse agonists directly at the level of the G-protein.", 
    "119": "A great deal of uncertainty persists regarding the exact nature of the interaction between autonomic nervous system activity and thyroid hormones in the control of heart rate and blood pressure. We now report on thyrotoxicosis produced by daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of L-thyroxine (0.5 mg/kg body wt. in 1 ml of 5 mM NaOH for 5 days). Control rats received i.p. daily injections of the thyroxine solvent. In order to estimate the degree of autonomic activation in hyperthyroidism, specific blockers were administered intravenously: atropine (0.5 mg/kg), prazosin (1 mg/kg), atenolol (1 mg/kg) or the combination of atenolol and atropine. A jet of air was administered in other animals to induce sympathoactivation. Eight animals were studied in each group. The dose and duration of L-thyroxine treatment was sufficient to induce a significant degree of hyperthyroidism with accompanying tachycardia, systolic blood pressure elevation, increased pulse pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, weight loss, tachypnea and hyperthermia. In addition, the intrinsic heart period observed after double blockade (atenolol + atropine) was markedly decreased after treatment with L-thyroxine (121.5+/-3.6 ms vs. 141.2+/-3.7 ms, P < 0.01). Of the autonomic indices, vagal tone (difference between heart period obtained after atenolol and intrinsic heart period) was negatively linearly related to intrinsic heart period (r = 0.71, P < 0.05). Atenolol modified neither the heart period nor blood pressure variability in rats with hyperthyroidism and in these rats the jet of air did not significantly affect the heart period level. The thyrotoxicosis was associated with a reduction of the 0.4 Hz component of blood pressure variability (analyses on 102.4 s segments, modulus 1.10+/-0.07 vs. 1.41+/-0.06 mm Hg, P < 0.01) and prazosin was without effect on this 0.4 Hz component in these animals. These data show a functional diminution of the vascular and cardiac sympathetic tone in early experimental hyperthyroidism. The marked rise in the intrinsic heart rate could be the main determinant of tachycardia. The blood pressure elevation may reflexly induce vagal activation and sympathetic (vascular and cardiac) inhibition.", 
    "120": "The present study was carried out to clarify the role of nonselective cation channels as a Ca2+ entry pathway in the contraction and the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by endothelin- in endothelium-denuded rat thoracic aorta rings, and their suppression by nitric oxide (NO). In Ca2+-free medium, the endothelin-1-induced contraction was suppressed to about 20% of control values, although the increase in [Ca2+]i became negligible. The contraction and the increase in [Ca2+]i monitored by fura 2 fluorescence were unaffected by a blocker of L-type voltage-operated Ca2+ channels nifedipine. A blocker of nonselective cation channels 1-[beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxyl]-4-methoxyphenethyl]-1H-imida zole . HCl(SK&F 96365) suppressed the endothelin-1-induced contraction and increase in [Ca2+]i to the level similar to that after removal of extracellular Ca2+. SK&F 96365 had no further effect on the endothelin-1-induced contraction in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The endothelin-1-induced contraction and increase in [Ca2+]i were abolished by a donor of NO sodium nitroprusside. The effects of another NO donor 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) were also tested and yielded essentially similar results to those for sodium nitroprusside on the endothelin-1-induced contraction. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of sodium nitroprusside could be blocked with a guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3,-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) at 30 microM. These findings suggest that Ca2+ entry through nonselective cation channels but not voltage-operated Ca2+ channels plays a critical role in the endothelin-1-induced increase in [Ca2+]i and the resulting contraction and that inhibition by NO of the endothelin-1-induced contraction is mainly the result of blockade of Ca2+ entry through these channels.", 
    "121": "The risk of heart failure increases with age. Prognosis is poor, with 82% of patients dying within 6 years of diagnosis. As the population ages, heart failure is becoming an increasing problem. Heart failure is a complex disease that may be managed in a variety of ways depending on its severity and cause. A wide range of pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapeutic measures are available to relieve symptoms and prolong life. These have changed considerably in the last decade. Cardiology experts in the United States and Europe have developed guidelines for the diagnosis and management of heart failure. These are intended to help physicians to keep up with therapeutic developments and to encourage more appropriate and cost-effective management of patients with heart failure. The European guidelines were updated more recently than their US counterparts and consequently contain certain new developments, such as the inclusion of the latest data on beta-blockers, including carvedilol, that have shown morbidity and mortality rate benefits in patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure. As the management of heart failure is changing rapidly, regular schemes for updating of guidelines are being considered.", 
    "122": "In controlled trials, long-term treatment of patients with chronic heart failure with beta-blockers improves symptoms, slows progression of disease, and reduces morbidity and mortality rates. However, in some patients the introduction of therapy can be associated with a period of clinical instability, including risks of fluid retention, hypotension, and bradycardia. Appropriate patient selection and optimization of background therapy can minimize the risk during the introduction of therapy. With vigilance for early signs of clinical deterioration and appropriate adjustment of background medications, the care of most patients exhibiting clinical instability can be successfully managed so the patient is able to continue with the long-term therapy, a prerequisite to realizing beneficial effects. With the initiation of carvedilol, any evidence of fluid retention warrants a prompt increase in the diuretic dosage, and in more pronounced cases the carvedilol dose may need to be reduced or interrupted. In contrast, symptoms of hypotension (most commonly dizziness) generally resolve without intervention, although persistent problems may necessitate adjusting the timing of dose administration or perhaps temporarily reducing the dose of vasodilators or diuretics (the latter with care to avoid fluid retention). Bradycardia should be managed as standard practice would indicate. During long-term treatment, adjustments in beta-blocker dosage may be required in the event of an exacerbation of heart failure. Dosages should be adjusted as would be the case with other heart-failure medications, based on the severity of the clinical decompensation, but with care to minimize abrupt changes unless mandated by the patient's condition and to avoid precipitating ischemia or further deterioration. The occurrence of effects such as these does not necessarily indicate that a patient cannot respond favorably to long-term beta-blockade, but all require understanding, vigilance, and the availability of medical personnel, especially during the introduction of this therapy.", 
    "123": "Prolonged activation of the sympathetic nervous system in patients with impaired ventricular function exerts adverse effects on the heart and circulation by a variety of mechanisms that are triggered by the interaction of norepinephrine and epinephrine with alpha1-, beta1-, and beta2-adrenergic receptors. Drugs that interfere with the actions of the sympathetic nervous system on alpha- and beta-receptors might be expected to antagonize these deleterious effects. beta1-receptor blockers have been shown to prevent and reverse many of the structural and functional changes that occur during the progression of heart failure, and beta2- and alpha1-receptor blockade seems to enhance the ability of beta1-blockers to prevent the toxic effects of catecholamines. In a large number of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, long-term treatment of patients with chronic heart failure with beta-adrenergic blockers improves cardiac function, ameliorates symptoms, and reduces the risk of death and hospitalization. The nature and consistency of these benefits have led an increasing number of physicians to conclude that most patients with heart failure should be considered candidates for long-term treatment with these drugs. Analysis of these clinical trials has also raised the possibility that beta-blockers might differ from each other. Specifically, might agents that block alpha1-, betal-, and beta2-receptors be more effective and better tolerated that agents that act selectively on the beta1-receptor? This hypothesis is now being evaluated in a large-scale, long-term, international trial.", 
    "124": "The use of beta-blocker therapy in heart failure was contraindicated for many years because it was considered to block necessary sympathetic compensatory responses to reduced cardiac function. However, early studies provided promising results in terms of improved symptoms and work capacity and reduced heart size. Small-scale studies have been completed over the past 20 years but until large-scale, long-term, randomized trials were conducted, the potential of beta-blockers in heart failure was not confirmed. The results of randomized trials published to date have included over 3,000 patients and the results show improvements in left ventricular function and heart rate. Significant improvements in New York Heart Association classification were also shown. Although no conclusive effect on mortality was shown, the first Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS) indicated a trend toward improved survival during long-term treatment with bisoprolol. Ongoing studies have been specifically designed to investigate the effects of beta-blockers on survival. One of these trials, CIBIS II, which was terminated early in 1998 because of a positive effect on survival, is expected to report in late summer 1998. Such trials will also examine the different mechanisms of action of beta-blockers in heart failure and the influence of causes on the effects of beta-blockade.", 
    "125": "Carvedilol is a novel cardiovascular drug of proven efficacy in the treatment of hypertension, angina, and heart failure. Several mechanisms may account for the beneficial effects of carvedilol in patients with heart failure. As with other beta-blockers, blockade of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors (both beta1 and beta2), and hence reduction of cardiac work load and oxygen consumption, plays an important role in the actions of this agent. Additional benefit is provided by vasodilation (alphal-adrenergic blockage) at peripheral resistance vessels, which decreases preload and after-load, thereby further reducing cardiac work and wall tensions. In addition, potential advantages of carvedilol resulting from alpha1-adrenergic blockade are likely because alpha1-adrenergic receptors mediate cardiac remodeling by inducing hypertrophy. Finally, carvedilol is a potent antioxidant and is unique among beta-blockers in this respect. In recent years, evidence has accumulated in support of the role played by reactive oxygen radicals in chronic pathological states of the myocardium. In this article, the role of oxygen radicals in heart failure is discussed with special reference to apoptosis, a phenomenon believed to be involved in progressive cardiac myocyte loss in ischemic or myopathic heart diseases. The potential role of the antioxidant actions of carvedilol, especially in prevention of apoptotic cell death, is highlighted as a novel mechanism of action in heart failure.", 
    "126": "The sympathetic nervous system plays a pivotal role in the natural history of chronic heart failure (CHF). There is early activation of cardiac adrenergic drive, which is followed by an increasing magnitude of generalized sympathetic activation, with worsening heart failure. The adverse consequences predominate over the short-term compensatory effects and are mediated through downregulation of beta-receptor function and harmful biological effects on the cardiomyocyte. beta-blockers exert a beneficial effect on the natural history of CHF by attenuating the negative biological effects, restoring homogeneity of contractile/relaxant mechanisms, and reducing the risk of myocardial ischemia and arrhythmias. After pioneering work conducted over 20 years ago, numerous studies have shown the beneficial effects of beta-blockade on left ventricular function, and survival, morbidity, and mortality rates in CHF. Large-scale trials are underway to determine the overall benefits of beta-blockade in heart failure.", 
    "127": "Hypothermia increases preglomerular vasoconstriction leading to decreases in renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Since plasma catecholamine concentrations are increased during hypothermia, the present study was performed to determine the role of the renal sympathetic nervous system in the cold-induced renal vasoconstriction. In Inactin anaesthetized rats, hypothermia at 28 degrees C decreased GFR by 50% but failed to alter efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity (ERSNA). Since hypothermia causes shivering which could have influenced the ERSNA recording, Inactin anaesthetized rats were treated with pethidine or rats were anaesthetized with pentobarbital sodium or Saffan to eliminate cold-induced shivering. In these non-shivering rats, hypothermia produced a reversible decrease in ERSNA in association with a fall in GFR that was of a similar magnitude as in shivering rats. Further studies in Inactin anaesthetized rats showed that the fall in GFR was unaltered by renal denervation, bilateral adrenalectomy or intrarenal administration of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. We conclude that cold-induced renal vasoconstriction is not due to an increase in ERSNA or adrenaline/noradrenaline-mediated activation of renal alpha 1-adrenoceptors.",

Twenty New Zealand white rabbits trabeculectomized with subconjunctival retention of 0.3 mL C3F8 gas in the right eyes were used as animal models. One week and three weeks after the operation, the left eyes of the rabbits were given three drops of 0.5% timolol, and IOP dynamics were compared between the two fellow eyes after intravenous infusion of 0.9% NaCl sterile solution. There were four parameters available in comparing IOP dynamics: Time Needed to Reach Peak IOP (TNRPI); Ascending Slope (AS); Peak IOP (PI); and Time Needed to Return to the Original IOP (TNROI). By this method, it was noted that, at the 7th day after the operation, the eyes trabeculectomized with subconjunctival retention of C3F8 gas had lower IOPs than the eyes that received topical instillation of timolol (baseline IOP: 14.7 +/- 4.2 vs. 19.5 +/- 2.5, p < 0.001, PI: 16.4 +/- 5.2 vs. 26.2 +/- 9.3, p < 0.001).

    "148": "A stable HL60 subline having the potential for monocytic differentiation was established by use of GM-CSF. HL60, a human promyelocytic cell line, has frequently been employed for research in the fields of monocytic differentiation and atherosclerosis because of its potential to differentiate into either granulocytes or monocytes. However, HL60 are frequently seen to change their phenotype during long-term culture. To date, many sublines or variants of HL60 cells have been established. However, most of them display diminished or complete loss of activities that characterize parental cells. The present study was conducted to establish a stable HL60 subline with the potential for monocytic differentiation. Firstly, a single HL60 cell was isolated by limiting dilution, and was successfully proliferated by incubation with GM-CSF. Secondly, from this population, cells were selected that had the ability to generate superoxide after VD-induced monocytic differentiation. Cells obtained in this manner (designated HL60/DU-1) exhibited expression of CD14 and CD11b and suppression of CD3 expression after monocytic differentiation. NBT positivity showed a consistent level of over 971% after a 6-day challenge with VD throughout the experimental period of 12 months. HL60/DU-1 cells, which were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for 6 months, thawed and re-cultured, exhibited over 97% NBT positivity. Carvedilol and probucol, which exhibit antioxidative activity, inhibited superoxide release from the differentiated HL60/DU-1 cells. HL60/DU-1 cell line is a promising model for the study of monocytic differentiation and the effects of oxygen radicals.", 
    "149": "(1) In vagotomized, anaesthetized rats, effects of stimulation of cardiac N. vagus (2-25 Hz) on cardiac and circulatory functions were studied: we recorded transient reductions in heart rate (HR), in left-ventricular systolic pressure (LV Ps), in maximal change in left-ventricular pressure development (dp/dt)max and in mean arterial pressure (MAP, A. femoralis). (2) Bolus injection of angiotensin II (AII, 2.5-100 microg/kg body weight) caused (a) transient increases in HR, LV Ps and MAP (pressor effects, maximal changes occurred within 3 min after injection), and (b) dose-dependently reduced effects of vagus stimulation (non-pressor effects, recorded 10 min after injection). Due to fast breakdown of All in the circulatory system, all observed vagus stimulation effects were completely recovered within 1 h after injection. (3) Plasma concentration of AII was recorded with a highly specific radioimmunoassay: 10 min after AII injection (non-pressor range), plasma concentration was clearly higher than physiological levels in all experiments with 10 microg AII/kg at least. (4) Treatment with propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor blocker, 1 mg/kg body weight) did not reduce the vagus effects alone, but decreased the modulatory AII effects. This result hints at the activation of sympathetic beta-adrenergic receptors by AII counteracting the parasympathetic cardiac control.", 
    "150": "A 61-year-old man developed thyrotoxicosis after excision of a thymoma. His laboratory examination showed an increased level of thyroid hormone and a low thyroidal iodine uptake. No thyroidal autoantibody was detected. With the diagnosis of silent thyroiditis, he was treated with propranolol. He became euthyroid after 2 months. Thymoma often accompanies an autoimmune disease as a paraneoplastic syndrome, and an immunological mechanism is thought to be involved in the onset of silent thyroiditis. This case suggests the involvement of an immunological mechanism in the pathogenesis of silent thyroiditis.", 
    "151": "Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is often quantified by computing the spectra of heart period (HP) or of its reciprocal heart rate (HR) at the respiratory frequency. This study was undertaken to describe the effect of an acute beta-blockade achieved with bisoprolol on RSA, obtained during a calibrated breathing (breathing frequency 0.25 Hz, tidal volume VT 500 or 700 mL) in 15 normal volunteers, using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over method. The two heart signals were computed and the RSA values were compared to the individual estimates of vagal tone obtained using an additional atropine injection. The difference between the HP (or HR) value obtained after beta-blockade and the HP (or HR) value observed following the double blockade (bisoprolol plus atropine) was taken as an index of cardiac vagal tone. Bisoprolol administration resulted in a significant reduction in HR reaching 60.3 +/- 1.4 bpm at VT of 500 mL (compared to 70.5 +/- 1.8 bpm with placebo, P < 0.001). Changes in HP were also significant with an increase in HP reaching 1004.5 +/- 22.2 msec at this controlled VT (compared to 860.3 +/- 21.5 msec with placebo, P < 0.001). Similar changes were observed at a VT of 700 mL. The relationship between RSA in bpm and vagal tone was not significant for HR while a significant positive relationship was observed between RSA in msec and vagal tone for the two respiratory patterns (r = 0.65 for a tidal volume of 500 mL, P < 0.01, and r = 0.62 for 700 mL, P < 0.05). This demonstrates that the detection of the variability effect highly depends upon the unit. The parallelism between vagal tone and RSA supports the view that the HF component of HRV in msec quantifies the vagal tone. The increased RSA during beta-blockade could well reflect this vagotonic effect of this class of drugs.", 
    "152": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in myocardial beta-adrenergic reactivity in animals undergoing a 4 week cardiac volume overload. Aortocaval shunt (ACS) or sham operation (sham) were performed in male Wistar rats, and 4 weeks later, isoproterenol dose-effects (chronotropic, inotropic and lusitropic properties) were studied after pithing. Noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) concentrations and NA turn-over index were evaluated in plasma and heart ventricles, while beta-adrenoceptor characteristics in ventricle homogenates and slices with [125I]iodocyanopindolol, and the beta(1)/beta(2)-adrenoceptor ratio were estimated. Four weeks of cardiac volume overload resulted in a 55% increase in ventricle weight/body weight ratio (from 2.5 +/- 0.1 to 3.9 +/- 0.1 mg/g in sham and ACS rats, respectively) and a 20% increase in protein contents (from 11.3 +/- 0.7 to 13.8 +/- 1.1 mg/100 mg ventricles in sham and ACS rats, respectively). Furthermore, NA and A concentrations and NA turn-over index were increased in ACS rats (14, 40 and 80% versus sham, respectively). A shift to the right of the responses in heart rate, left ventricular systolic pressure, +dP/dtmax and -dP/dtmax responses following increasing doses of isoproterenol was observed, without change in the dose inducing maximum effect. Total beta-adrenoceptor characteristics and beta(1)/beta(2) ratio were unchanged. However, beta(1)-adrenoceptor density increased in epicardium while decreasing in endocardium of left ventricle from ACS rats. Rightward shift at lower doses of isoproterenol-induced cardiac responses in volume-overloaded rats are not likely due to overall beta-adrenoceptor density changes."
