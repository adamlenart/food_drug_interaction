A group of 5 guinea pigs were pretreated with U-60,257 (5 mg/kg IV), and studied before and 30 min after a 15 min exposure to 3.0 ppm ozone. These animals were compared to a similarly exposed group that was untreated (n = 10). Reactivity was determined by measuring specific airway resistance (SRaw) upon intravenous acetylcholine infusion in unanesthetized, spontaneously breathing animals. Prior to ozone exposure, we found that U-60,257 treatment did not affect either SRaw or muscarinic reactivity. After exposure to 3.0 ppm, all untreated guinea pigs showed substantial muscarinic hyperreactivity. In contrast, no significant change in SRaw or muscarinic reactivity occurred after ozone in any animal pretreated with U-60,257. We conclude that ozone-induced bronchial hyperreactivity in the guinea pig rapidly develops after a brief, high level exposure. This effect may be mediated, in part, by leukotrienes generated upon ozone exposure.", 
    "1": "The influence of long-term timolol treatment on plasma lipids was analysed in cohorts of the Norwegian timolol multicentre study. The prognostic importance of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration after myocardial infarction was also examined. One year timolol treatment was related to a significant reduction in HDL cholesterol levels, from 1.32 mmol l-1 to 1.26 mmol l-1 (P less than 0.05). After one year the HDL cholesterol levels were significantly lower in the timolol treated patients (1.26 mmol l-1) than in the placebo treated patients (1.32 mmol l-1, P less than 0.01). However, the HDL cholesterol values after myocardial infarction had no prognostic importance, and in the placebo group total mortality was the same in patients with low HDL cholesterol (less than 1.25 mmol l-1) and high HDL cholesterol (greater than or equal to 1.25 mmol l-1), respectively 15.0% and 14.8%. Timolol treatment was related to a reduction in mortality both in patients with low (24%, NS) and with high (43%, P less than 0.05) HDL cholesterol levels. Thus, any deleterious effects of timolol on serum lipids did not attenuate its protective effect on the damaged myocardium.", 
    "2": "We have compared oxyfedrine 24 mg four times daily with atenolol 100 mg once daily in the relief of angina pectoris in a double-blind cross-over study; assessments were by diary cards and treadmill testing. Both oxyfedrine and atenolol reduced the frequency of angina by similar amounts and both produced similar improvements in treadmill performance. Side effects were infrequent and minor with both drugs. The model of action of oxyfedrine appears to be different from atenolol. Oxyfedrine allows the double product of systolic blood pressure X heart rate at peak exercise to be maintained at levels similar to those with placebo; the double product at peak exercise is significantly less with atenolol.", 
    "3": "Effects of oral administration of equipotent antihypertensive doses of propranolol and nadolol on renal function were examined in 20 hypertensive patients with moderately impaired renal function. Creatinine clearance increased, and serum beta 2-microglobulin concentrations decreased, when patients were switched from propranolol to nadolol therapy (creatinine clearance = 46.7 +/- 4.9 ml min-1 on propranolol and 52.7 +/- 5.9 on nadolol; beta 2-microglobulin = 6.14 +/- 0.66 mg l-1 on propranolol and 5.62 +/- 0.62 on nadolol). When patients were put back on propranolol, their creatinine clearances (45.9 +/- 5.0 ml min-1) and serum beta 2-microglobulin concentrations (6.51 +/- 0.67 mg l-1) returned to values comparable to those obtained before the change to nadolol was made. Serum beta 2-microglobulin concentrations correlated significantly with creatinine clearance (r = -0.819, P less than 0.001).", 
    "4": "The clinical efficacy of timolol given once and twice daily was compared in the management of angina pectoris. Following a 2-week entry period, 16 normotensive male subjects with stable angina and proven myocardial ischaemia received timolol 10 mg twice daily, or 20 mg every morning for 1 month followed by 1 month on crossover therapy. All were exercised on separate days in random order 1 hr after administration of 10 mg, 1 hr after administration of 20 mg, 13 hr after administration of 10 mg and 25 hr after administration of 20 mg. In spite of significant differences in the maximum heart rates, rate pressure products and maximum lateral ST segment depression between the once and twice daily regimes, the maximal walking times were not significantly different (P greater than 0.10) and attack rates for angina and trinitrin consumption were similar (P greater than 0.45; P greater than 0.05). This evidence suggests that timolol is as effective in dosage of 20 mg taken once daily as half the dose taken twice daily in the symptom management of angina pectoris.", 
    "5": "Fat (FL) or lean (LL) chickens have been obtained by divergent selection. In previous studies, FL chickens were consistently hypoglycemic (slightly) and had high plasma levels of insulin in response to glucose or refeeding from 5 to 8 wk of age. In these, at 12-13 days of age before any difference in fattening can be demonstrated, FL chickens exhibit a better glucose tolerance pattern and enhanced glucose-induced insulin levels but normal insulin levels during refeeding. Plasma levels of alpha-NH2 nonprotein nitrogen, uric acid, free fatty acids, and potassium were neither consistent nor significantly different between lines. Atropine, at high dose, blocked the absorption of glucose and at low dose had no major effect on glucose-induced insulin release in either line. At 8 wk, sensitivity to and disappearance of exogenous insulin were normal in FL birds. Propranolol slightly decreased plasma glucose and inhibited the hypokalemic effect of exogenous insulin to the same extent in both lines. Cerebrospinal fluid glucose level and liver glycogen content were similar in both lines in the fasting or the fed state, but liver glycogen was restored faster after refeeding in the FL, at least in older birds.", 
    "6": "Pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure (Ppao) may not accurately reflect left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) during ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) because increases in pleural pressure (Ppl) increase measured intrathoracic vascular and cardiac chamber pressures relative to atmospheric while decreasing LVFP by decreasing venous return. Steady-state values of Ppao off PEEP are not useful in understanding the hemodynamics on PEEP because of changes in blood volume distribution and ventricular afterload associated with the removal of PEEP. We hypothesized that changes in Ppao immediately after abrupt airway disconnection from PEEP selectively reflect removal of PEEP-associated Ppl changes prior to other physiological changes. In pentobarbital-anesthetized closed-chest dogs, we compared absolute left atrial pressure and left atrial pressure relative to Ppl (Platm) prior to abrupt disconnection from 15 cmH2O PEEP (on-PEEP), with Ppao at its nadir (nadir Ppao) following airway disconnection in three sequential conditions: control (normal), after propranolol-induced acute ventricular failure, and after oleic acid-induced lung injury. For all conditions at low LVFP (less than 9 Torr), nadir Ppao reflects Platm better than on-PEEP Ppao, while at higher LVFP (greater than 9 Torr), on-PEEP Ppao better reflects Platm than nadir Ppao (P less than 0.05). Accurate predictions of on-PEEP Platm can be made using both on-PEEP and nadir Ppao values in a multiple regression equation.", 
    "7": "Exercise capacity is frequently impaired in patients with mitral stenosis (MS) and sinus rhythm (SR). The resulting increased heart rate, which shortens the diastolic filling period, and the increased cardiac output lead to further elevations of left atrial pressure and subsequent pulmonary congestion. The effect of the beta-receptor blocking agent atenolol, 100 mg/day, was assessed in 13 patients with MS and SR. Exercise performance was assessed using a modified multistage Bruce protocol after 2 weeks of placebo and after 2 weeks therapy with atenolol in a single-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Atenolol resulted in significant decreases in mean heart rates at rest and during exercise (p = 0.0015) and a significant increase in total exercise time (p = 0.0015). Maximal exercise capacity was also significantly improved (p = 0.0015). All patients were both objectively and subjectively improved by atenolol. Thus, beta-blockade with atenolol improves exercise capacity in patients with MS and SR and may be of benefit to most such patients. The improved effort tolerance is attributed to reduction of the exercise-associated sinus tachycardia by beta-blockade, allowing a longer diastolic filling period and better left atrial decompression.", 
    "8": "The interaction of inhibition of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis by indomethacin (75 mg/day) with the antihypertensive effect of atenolol (50 mg b.i.d.) was studied in 11 untreated otherwise healthy men 35 to 45 years old with essential hypertension. Atenolol for 3 weeks decreased supine blood pressure (BP) from 157/109 mm Hg during placebo to 148/97 mm Hg. Indomethacin alone for 1 week slightly increased BP and antagonized the antihypertensive action of atenolol. Atenolol reduced plasma renin activity (PRA) to 40% but did not modify either the urinary excretion of vasodilatory PGs (PGE2 and prostacyclin measured as 6-keto-PGF1 alpha) or plasma kininogen and urine kallikrein. Indomethacin suppressed PRA to 27% and PG excretion to approximately 70% but did not markedly change plasma kininogen and urine kallikrein excretion. The decreased excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, the metabolite of the main vasodilatory prostanoid prostacyclin, correlated with the increased BP measured in standing subjects. The effects of indomethacin were practically the same when given with atenolol as when given alone. We conclude that the slight increase in BP by indomethacin in essential hypertension is associated with the reduced production of vasodilatory PGs but not with alterations in activities of the renin-angiotensin or kallikrein-kinin systems.", 
    "9": "An 80-year-old man who had had plaque-type psoriasis for 40 years experienced a rapid onset of generalized pustular psoriasis three days after initiation of propranolol hydrochloride therapy. Trial therapy with propranolol on two occasions resulted in similar episodes. The skin lesions and systemic symptoms resolved after the discontinuation of propranolol therapy and administration of methotrexate sodium. This case study documents propranolol--a beta-blocker--as another causal factor for pustular psoriasis.", 
    "10": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate how many cirrhotics may receive propranolol after upper gastrointestinal bleeding. One hundred and twelve patients were consecutively admitted in a digestive intensive care unit during a two-year study, for bleeding of esophageal (63 p. 100) or gastric (4 p. 100) varices, or acute gastric erosions (33 p. 100). Twenty-one per cent of patients were initially class A (Child's classification). 26 p. 100 were B, and 53 p. 100 were C. Eighteen patients (16 p. 100) died within the first 10 days. Eighty patients (71 p. 100) did not receive propranolol because of: a) contraindication for this drug (asthma, heart failure, diabetes, n = 25); b) carcinoma, mainly of the liver (n = 11); c) foreseeable lack of compliance with the treatment (n = 8); d) criteria for which the efficacy of propranolol has not been demonstrated (small esophageal varices, jaundice, or ascites, n = 36). Only 14 patients (13 p. 100) received propranolol therapy: 5 stopped their treatment, 3 because of gastrointestinal rebleeding. Our experience suggests that propranolol can be used only in a few cirrhotics for prevention of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.", 
    "11": "Triglyceride (TG) concentrations in uterine strips isolated from diestrous normal rats, from diestrous streptozotocin (single iv. injection of 65 mg X Kg body weight-1)-diabetic rats and from diestrous diabetic animals, treated in vivo with insulin (protamine zinc insulin 4U X day-1, 6 days, sc.), were measured. Determinations were made immediately following killing (0 min, or postisolation) as well as after an incubation period in glucose-free medium (60 min, or postincubation), with or without additions. The basal or postisolation levels of TGs (0 min) in the uterus from control normal rats (TGs: 17.0 +/- 0.5 mumol X g-1, d.w.; blood glucose: 100.4 +/- 4.8 mg X dl-1) were lower (P less than 0.001) than in streptozotocin-diabetics (TGs: 28.5 +/- 0.6 mumol X g-1, d.w.; blood glucose: 302.0 +/- 10.1 mg X dl-1) and the treatment with insulin (blood glucose: 165.0 +/- 14.7 mg X dl-1), restored TGs towards normal (19.3 +/- 1.3 mumol X g-1, d.w.). The postisolation levels of TGs (0 min) in the uterus from normal controls did not differ in comparison with postincubation values (60 min), either without additions or in presence of indomethacin (5 X 10(-6)M) or of prostaglandins (PGs) E2 or F2 alpha, at 10(-9)M. On the contrary, in uteri from diabetic animals, the higher initial TG levels diminished spontaneously in comparison to controls (P less than 0.001) following 60 min of incubation without additions; this decrement being antagonized by indomethacin or by propranolol (10(-6)M). Moreover, exogenous PGE2 failed to alter the effect of indomethacin, whereas PGF2 alpha evoked its abolition. In addition, propranolol, which effectively blocked the spontaneous decrement of TGs as did indomethacin, prevented also the influence of PGF2 alpha on the action of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor. In the case of uteri from diabetic rats treated in vivo with insulin, TG levels remained unaltered at the end of an incubating period of 60 min without additions and so they did following the administration of indomethacin or PGF2 alpha. The results document that the regulation of TGs in the diestrous rat uteri, suspended in glucose-free solution, is affected differently by PGE2 and F2 alpha, depending on the existence or not of an untreated diabetic condition. They also suggest that the action of PGF2 alpha may involve the activation of tissue beta-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "12": "The authors examined the influence of intravenously administered sodium ortho-vanadate upon the intraocular pressure (IOP) of the albino rabbit. Vanadate was administered by intravenous injection and the IOP was measured by applanation tonometry. Vanadate (2 mg/kg) caused a marked reduction of IOP which lasted for several hours. Pretreatment with systemic reserpine 24 hr prior to vanadate administration markedly diminished ocular hypotensive response to vanadate. Similarly, systemic treatment with propranolol prevented the IOP-lowering effect of vanadate. In addition, propranolol administered during the course of the vanadate-induced hypotensive response caused the IOP to return to a level close to the control value. The IOP-lowering effect of vanadate appeared to be unrelated to cardiovascular changes; vanadate was observed to have no significant influence upon the blood pressure of anesthetized animals even though the IOP was markedly reduced. On the basis of these experiments, the authors suggest that adrenergic mechanisms contribute to the IOP-lowering effect of vanadate.", 
    "13": "In 12 ulcer patients in attack and in 6 healthy subjects the secretory test to insulin (Hollender test) was used and repeated after 48 hrs in association with propranolol (Propins test). While in controls the stimulated acid secretion was not influenced in ulcer patients a significant reduction of the secretory parameters was obtained in 60% of the cases thus confirming the existence of a beta-adrenergic component of the hydrochloric secretion. In 40% of the ulcer patients this effect was not observed. It therefore results that by using our \"Propins\" test it is possible to estimate the prevalence of the vagal-cholinergic or the beta-adrenergic (gastrinic) mechanism in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer.", 
    "14": "The submaximal test of triangular type was used for studying the adaptability to exercise, on an ergometric bicycle. It was performed, starting from O W, with progressive increasing load of 10 W/min until the maximum optimum heart rate (fho) was reached. The heart rate, arterial blood pressure, electrocardiogram, CO2 output and O2 consumption. Computed O2 consumption (VO2 max, ml/kg/min, Astrand) were determined, also taking into account the subjective sensation linked to exercise, measured on a modified Borg scale. The adaptability capacity to exercise was expressed by the adaptability coefficient (AC), according to the formula: AC = W'/2 + (W'-f'). 20 hyperthyroid patients, without cardiothyreosis were examined, both before the uptake of propranolol and after, at a certain interval of time. A decrease of the exercise capacity before the treatment and its increase after it, was noticed in the hyperthyroid patients.", 
    "15": "An appraisal of the affinity of (-)-propranolol was made for beta-adrenoceptors of isolated heart preparations and myocardial membrane particles from patients undergoing open heart surgery. In order to eliminate possible distorting influences of neuronal and extraneuronal uptakes of catecholamines on the affinity estimates for (-)-propranolol, isolated tissues were pretreated once with 5 or 10 mumol/l phenoxybenzamine for 2 h. Phenoxybenzamine caused potentiation of the positive inotropic effects of (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline but not of (-)-isoprenaline; potentiation was more pronounced in atrial than in ventricular preparations. Potentiation was greater for (-)-noradrenaline than for (-)-adrenaline. It is concluded that the concentration of physiological catecholamines at the human heart beta-adrenoceptors is limited by neuronal capture but not by extraneuronal uptake. The antagonism of the positive inotropic effects of (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline by (-)-propranolol was simple competitive in left ventricular myocardium of patients with mitral lesion. The effects of (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline were antagonized to similar extent by (-)-propranolol. An equilibrium dissociation constant KB (-log mol/l) of 8.6 was estimated for (-)-propranolol. In atrial preparations the inotropic effects of (-)-adrenaline were antagonized significantly more by (-)-propranolol than those of (-)-noradrenaline. KB-Values (-log mol/l) of 8.9 [against (-)-adrenaline] and 8.5 [against (-)-noradrenaline] were estimated for (-)-propranolol. Concentration-effect curves for the stimulation of adenylate cyclase of both atrium and ventricle were biphasic for (-)-noradrenaline and monophasic for (-)-adrenaline. The high-sensitivity and low-sensitivity components of (-)-noradrenaline comprised 1/3 and 2/3, respectively, of maximum cyclase stimulation. As expected from beta 1-adrenoceptors, the high-sensitivity component of the curve for (-)-noradrenaline was selectively antagonized by (-)-bisoprolol; as expected from beta 2-adrenoceptors, the low-sensitivity component was selectively antagonized by ICI 118,551. (-)-Propranolol antagonized the effects of (-)-noradrenaline mediated by beta 2-adrenoceptors 2 to 3 times more potently than the effects mediated by beta 1-adrenoceptors. (-)-Propranolol competed with 3H-(-)-bupranolol for binding to left ventricular beta-adrenoceptors. An equilibrium dissociation constant (-log mol/l) of 8.6 was estimated for (-)-propranolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "16": "We have found that several types of cultured mammalian cells, including both normal and transformed human, rat, and mouse cell lines, have an active transport system for a diverse group of structurally related compounds possessing an amine group and various types of aromatic ring structures. Ligands such as the beta-adrenergic antagonists (-)-[3H] dihydroalprenolol (DHA), (-)-[3H]propranolol, and (-)-[125I] iodocyanopindolol, and the tricyclic antidepressant [3H]imipramine, which are used to assess cell surface receptors for catecholamines and serotonin, appear to be actively transported into cells rather than simply bound to cell surface sites or accumulated by passive diffusion. DHA transport was competed by many structurally related amines including imipramine and certain alpha-and beta-adrenergic ligands, but not by catecholamines or serotonin. Ligand transport in HeLa cells was saturable at micromolar levels, selective, nonstereospecific, temperature- and pH-dependent, and sensitive to the ionophore monensin and the amine transport inhibitor reserpine, thus indicating dependence on a carrier system driven by a transmembrane proton gradient. In C6 glioma cells, amine transport was clearly distinguishable from beta-adrenergic receptor binding which could be measured with the recently developed hydrophilic beta-blocker (+/-)-[3H] 4-(3-tertiarybutylamino-2-hydroxy-propoxy)-benzimidazole-2-on hydrochloride (CGP-12177); binding of this ligand met rigorous pharmacological criteria, was not influenced by monensin or reserpine, and, therefore, did not appear to be transported. Membrane vesicles from HeLa and C6 cells transported DHA but not CGP-12177 via a MgATP-dependent mechanism which was inhibited by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, monensin, and reserpine, indicating a carrier system driven by a proton gradient maintained by a proton-pumping ATPase.", 
    "17": "Metabolic effects of low and high doses of insulin during beta-receptor blockade were studied in eight dogs. Beta-receptor blockade was induced by 0.5 mg/kg propranolol which caused depression of heart performance. This was accompanied by a significant reduction in myocardial blood-flow and oxygen consumption. There was also a significant reduction in arterial concentrations and myocardial uptake of free fatty acids, while arterial concentrations and myocardial uptake of glucose and lactate were not significantly changed. Fifteen minutes after beta receptor blockade, an intravenous (i.v.) bolus injection of 0.5 IU/kg, of insulin, free of glucagon and calcium, was given followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 IU/kg/h. Glucose and potassium were given to maintain constant levels of these factors. After 30 min another bolus dose of 300 IU insulin was injected. Thirty minutes after a low dose of insulin, a significant increase in heart performance was recorded at unaltered myocardial oxygen consumption. Arterial concentrations of free fatty acids were significantly reduced while levels of glucose and lactate were unchanged. Myocardial uptake of glucose increased significantly while uptake of lactate and free fatty acids was unchanged. After a high dose of insulin there was a considerable improvement in heart performance. Myocardial blood-flow and oxygen consumption were not changed, nor were there alterations in arterial concentrations and myocardial uptake of glucose, lactate and free fatty acids. It is concluded that, during beta-receptor blockade high doses of insulin improve the mechanical performance of the heart through mechanisms that are independent of insulin's effects on substrate metabolism.", 
    "18": "Haemodynamic effects of small and high doses of insulin during beta receptor blockade were studied in nine dogs. Beta receptor blockade was induced by 0.5 mg/kg propranolol and caused depression of cardiac performance with a significant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and a significant decrease in heart rate; maximum rate of left ventricular (LV) pressure rise (LVdP/dtmax), stroke volume and cardiac output. At 15 min, after beta receptor blockade, a bolus injection of 0.5 IU/kg of insulin, free of glucagon and calcium, was given followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 IU/kg/h. After 30 min another bolus dose of 300 IU insulin was injected. Glucose and potassium were given to maintain physiological levels of these factors. Five minutes after a low dose of insulin there was a significant decrease in LVEDP (P less than 0.01), and a significant increase in LVdP/dtmax (P less than 0.01), in stroke volume (P less than 0.01) and in cardiac output (P less than 0.01). The other haemodynamic variables were not significantly changed. Administration of a high dose of insulin further, significantly, improved performance of the beta receptor blocked heart and caused a significant reduction in total peripheral resistance. In conclusion, insulin exerts inotropic and vasodilator effects which are dose-dependent and not related to adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "19": "Binding assays of [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA), [3H]prazosin and [3H]clonidine have been performed on whole brain (minus cerebellum) homogenates of the convulsive mutant mice quaking (qk) and the controls of the same strain (C57BL/6J:B6). In 70-day-old mutants (which fully exhibit the qk convulsive phenotype), the binding of [3H]DHA to beta-adrenoceptor binding sites was not different from the controls, whereas the binding capacities of [3H]prazosin and [3H]clonidine to alpha 1-and alpha 2-adrenoceptor sites, respectively, were greatly enhanced. The biphasic ontogenic pattern of alpha 2-adrenoceptors had a greater amplitude in the brain of 30- to 90-day-old mutants than in the corresponding B6 controls. In mutants younger than 30 days or older than 90 days, the number of alpha 2-adrenoceptor sites was not modified. The number of alpha 1-adrenoceptor binding sites was increased in the brain of the mutants, only in animals older than 70 days. In younger mice, the postnatal modulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptor sites was identical to the controls. Regional studies were performed in 70-day-old mice. [3H]clonidine binding was increased in the brainstem of the mutants, and to a lesser extent in the cerebral cortex, while it was slightly diminished in the hypothalamic area. [3H]prazosin binding was also increased in the brainstem of the mutants, and decreased in the olfactory bulbs. Our results suggest that the convulsions of the qk mutants are selectively associated with modifications of alpha- and not beta-adrenoceptor binding sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "We have previously suggested that the effects of alpha 1-adrenergic agents on hepatocyte metabolism involve two mechanisms: (i) a calcium-independent insulin-sensitive process that is modulated by glucocorticoids and (ii) a calcium-dependent insulin-insensitive process that is modulated by thyroid hormones. We have studied the effect of epinephrine (plus propranolol) on gluconeogenesis from lactate and dihydroxyacetone. It was observed that the adrenergic stimulation of gluconeogenesis from lactate seemed to occur through both mechanisms, whereas when the substrate was dihydroxyacetone the action took place exclusively through the calcium-independent insulin-sensitive process. This effect was absent in hepatocytes from adrenalectomized rats, suggesting that it is modulated by glucocorticoids.", 
    "21": "In the present study, we have used 125I-cyanopindolol (125ICYP) to identify, characterize, and localize beta-adrenergic receptors in bovine, rat, and human pituitary gland by in vitro labeling light microscopic autoradiography. The binding of 125ICYP to slide-mounted bovine pituitary sections was saturable and of high affinity with an apparent Kd of 0.2 nM. The pharmacological profile of 125ICYP binding obtained from competition studies demonstrates that the beta-adrenergic receptors in the pituitary gland are predominantly of the beta 2 subtype. Rat pituitary autoradiograms show specific binding sites for 125ICYP in anterior, intermediate, and posterior lobes with highest concentrations found in the intermediate lobe and progressively lower concentrations in posterior and anterior lobes, respectively. Autoradiograms of 125ICYP binding in human pituitary show a significantly higher concentration of beta 2-adrenergic receptors in posterior than in anterior lobe of the pituitary. There is a homogeneous distribution of beta 2-adrenergic receptors within each lobe of both rat and human pituitary glands. The results of the present study provide the first visualization of beta 2-adrenergic receptors in rat and human pituitary and demonstrate the presence of significant concentrations of beta 2-adrenergic receptors in the posterior lobe. The data support a role for epinephrine and norepinephrine in modulating pituitary function.", 
    "22": "Effects of prolonged in vivo infusion of either saline (control) or isoproterenol (beta adrenoceptor desensitization) on acute cardiovascular responses to (+) (beta agonist)-, (-) (alpha agonist)- and (+/-)-dobutamine were studied in pithed rats. Each form of dobutamine resulted in comparable dose-dependent increases in maximum left ventricular dP/dt (LVdP/dtmax) in control animals. Effects of (+)-dobutamine were blocked by propranolol whereas those of l-dobutamine were sensitive to prazosin; both alpha and beta antagonists were required to block the inotropic effects of the racemic mixture. Contractile responses to (+)- and (+/-)-dobutamine were accompanied by tachycardia (characteristic of beta adrenoceptor stimulation) whereas (-)-dobutamine enhanced LVdP/dtmax without altering heart rate (characteristic of alpha adrenoceptor stimulation). Isoproterenol infusion resulted in a pronounced desensitization to the inotropic effects (LVdP/dtmax) of (+/-)- and (+)-dobutamine. Ed30 values for (+/-)- and (+)-dobutamine were increased by approximately 15- and 50-fold, respectively, and maximal responses to both drugs were severely attenuated. Prazosin further blunted remaining inotropic responses to (+/-)-dobutamine and propranolol resulted in a complete block. Responses to (+)-dobutamine were only sensitive to propranolol. Attenuation of heart rate responses paralleled those observed for LVdP/dtmax. By contrast, the inotropic effects of (-)-dobutamine in either control or desensitized rats were both qualitatively and quantitatively comparable; responses were blocked by the alpha-1 antagonist, prazosin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "Postsynaptic alpha adrenergic mechanisms were compared in cerebral and mesenteric arteries isolated from the baboon. The contractile response to norepinephrine (NE) of the cerebral artery was potent and similar to that of the mesenteric artery. The EC50 was 3.1 (2.0-5.0) X 10(-7) M for the cerebral artery and 2.6 (1.5-4.8) X 10(-7) M for the mesenteric artery. The maximum contraction expressed as a force developed/cross-sectional area did not differ between the two arteries, whereas that expressed as percentage of 30 mM KCl-induced contraction in the cerebral artery (118 +/- 9%) was less than in the mesenteric artery (145 +/- 6%). Phenylephrine produced a contraction in a manner similar to NE, although the EC50 values in both arteries were 2 to 3 times as large as those for NE. Clonidine produced a moderate contraction in the mesenteric artery (35 +/- 8% of the KCl-induced contraction) but no contraction in the cerebral artery. NE-induced contraction in the cerebral artery was inhibited more prominently by prazosin, a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, than that in the mesenteric artery; the pA2 value for prazosin in the cerebral artery was higher (9.70) than that in the mesenteric artery (8.95). In contrast, there was no difference in pA2 values for either phentolamine or yohimbine between the two arteries. Clonidine-induced contraction in the mesenteric artery was attenuated by prazosin rather than yohimbine at the same concentration used. Thus, it may be concluded that contractile processes related to postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenoceptor stimulation are predominantly operative in baboon cerebral and mesenteric arteries, the cerebral artery being more susceptible to the inhibitory effect of prazosin.", 
    "24": "The amount of radioactivity in vivo in the central nervous system (CNS) of the rat has been studied after tail-vein injections of (-)- [125I] iodopindolol (IPIN). The content of radioactivity in cortex and cerebellum 1 to 4 hr after IPIN administration was significantly reduced in rats pretreated with I-propranolol (1 mg/kg) given i.v. 5 min before IPIN; only a small effect of I-propranolol was seen in brainstem and spinal cord. The maximum reduction in radioactivity caused by I-propranolol was approximately the same in cortex and cerebellum (about 60-65%) and occurred 2 hr after IPIN administration. I-Propranolol was approximately 1500-fold more potent than d-propranolol in reducing radioactivity. Pretreatment of rats with other lipophilic drugs that act at beta receptors was able to reduce the binding of IPIN in vivo; in contrast, pretreatment of rats with drugs which do not have direct agonist or antagonist activity at beta adrenergic receptors (desmethylimipramine, metergoline, diazepam, fluoxetine, phentolamine and haloperidol) had no effect. Experiments using ICI 118, 551, a beta-2 antagonist and betaxolol, a beta-1 antagonist, indicated that the majority of radioactivity in the cortex in vivo was bound specifically to the beta-1 subtype of the receptor whereas in the cerebellum the majority of specific binding was to the beta-2-subtype. When the specific binding of IPIN to beta adrenergic receptors was measured in vitro in seven regions of the CNS, at a ligand concentration of 30 pM, a high correlation was found with the I-propranolol displaceable radioactivity measured in vivo (r = 0.97, P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "These experiments examined the effects of a high NaCl diet on (Na+,K+)-ATPase in kidney, heart and cerebral cortex, on the level of circulating inhibitor of (Na+,K+)-ATPase in plasma, and on stimulation of (Na+,K+)-ATPase by treatment with dextro (d)-amphetamine. High salt diet increased indices of (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity (K+-activated p-nitrophenyl-phosphatase activity and ouabain binding) in kidney medulla, prevented stimulation by amphetamine in cerebral cortex and reduced amphetamine stimulation in heart. High NaCl feeding increased the plasma level of circulating inhibitor of (Na+,K+)-ATPase. Amphetamine alone had no effect on inhibitor level but amphetamine administration reduced the increase in inhibitor with high NaCl feeding.", 
    "26": "Previous studies have reported that the numbers of beta- and alpha-adrenergic receptors increase in ischemic myocardium. In vivo studies have raised questions regarding the mechanisms involved in the adrenergic receptor alterations and the consequences of these alterations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential relationships among beta-adrenergic receptor changes, high energy phosphate reduction, and severity of cell injury in cultured neonatal rat myocytes treated with metabolic inhibitors. The potential for reversal of the receptor changes also was addressed. Binding parameters were measured using [125I]iodocyanopindolol. After 4 hours incubation in potassium cyanide and 2-deoxyglucose, there was a 43% increase in beta-adrenergic receptor number, 41% decrease in adenosine triphosphate, and minimal morphological change in myocytes. Twenty-four hours after removal of the inhibitors, myocytes exhibited a return to normal of the receptor number and adenosine triphosphate level. Iodoacetate treatment for up to 3 hours resulted in marked reduction in adenosine triphosphate and increasing severity of cell injury. The number of beta-adrenergic receptors was unchanged at 1.2 hours, increased at 1.5-2 hours, and decreased at 3 hours. Thus: beta-adrenergic receptor density increases during relatively early stages of injury in metabolically impaired myocytes with reduced adenosine triphosphate levels and decreases subsequently, after the myocytes become irreversibly injured; the increased beta-adrenergic receptor density in moderately injured myocytes can be reversed upon removal of the injurious agent and restoration of the cellular adenosine triphosphate level; and changes in catecholamines mediated by an intact nervous system are not required for an increase in beta-adrenergic receptor density in the setting of impaired energy metabolism.", 
    "27": "Body reactions during chain saw work were studied in 14 subjects. The subjects divided into three groups (control, sulpiride, and propranolol) successively cut down logs with a chain saw for seven minutes. The start of the sawing led to a pronounced increase in heart rate which persisted during the sawing. The groups taking sulpiride and propranolol showed a smaller increase in heart rate compared with the controls. Hormonal values (adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, adrenaline (Ad), noradrenaline (NA), and dopamine) were increased by the operation. A comparison of these values before and after the operation showed that the increase of cortisol, Ad, and NA values was highest in the controls, intermediate in the propranolol group, and lowest in the sulpiride group. The increase in ACTH, however, was greatest in the sulpiride group, intermediate in the controls and correct in the propranolol group. These findings provide some evidence that chain saw work may have an influence on the whole body, including the hypothalamus and the limbic lobe of the brain.", 
    "28": "Nutritional iron deficiency induced in rats causes a selective reduction of [3H]spiperone binding in caudate nucleus. This effect can be reversed by iron supplementation in vivo. The possibility that iron may be involved in the dopamine D2 receptor was investigated by examining the effect of various iron and noniron chelators on the binding of [3H]spiperone in rat caudate nucleus. Iron chelators 1,10-phenanthroline, 2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine, alpha, alpha'-dipyridyl, and desferrioxamine mesylate inhibited the binding of [3H]spiperone. The inhibition by 1,10-phenanthroline was noncompetitive and reversible. In the presence of FeCl2 or FeCl3, the inhibitory effect of 1,10-phenanthroline was potentiated. Iron salts or chelators were without effect on the binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to beta-adrenoreceptors in caudate nucleus; thus the action of iron chelators on the dopamine D2 receptor tends to be selective. Incubation of caudate nucleus membrane prepared from iron-deficient rats with FeCl2 or FeCl3 did not reverse the diminished binding of [3H]spiperone. The present study indicates that if iron is involved in the physiological regulation of dopamine D2 agonist-antagonist binding sites, it is more complex than hitherto considered.", 
    "29": "Antibodies to receptor ligands have been valuable in understanding the nature of receptor-ligand interactions. We have developed four monoclonal antibodies to the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist alprenolol by immunizing A/J mice with (-)-alprenolol coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The antisera from these mice displayed specific [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) binding that was inhibited by alprenolol, propranolol, and isoproterenol. Somatic cell fusion of spleen cells from the immunized mice to SP2/0 myeloma cells, followed by limited dilution subcloning, resulted in the isolation of four hybridomas (1B7, 5B7, 5D9, and 2G9) demonstrating three different classes of ligand binding characteristics. 1B7 had the highest binding affinity for antagonists based on Scatchard analysis (Kd [125I]- CYP = 1.4 X 10(-10) M; Kd [3H]DHA = 6.5 X 10(-9) M), and was the only antibody to demonstrate agonist-inhibition of [3H]DHA binding. Ki values computed from competitive inhibition curves of [3H]DHA binding to 1B7 resulted in a rank order of potency similar to that of beta-2-adrenergic receptors: (-)-propranolol greater than acebutolol amine greater than isoproterenol greater than (+)-propranolol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine. 5B7 and 5D9 exemplified a second class of antibody. This pair had lower antagonist binding affinities (Kd [3H]DHA = 2 X 10(-8) M and 2.5 X 10(-7) M, respectively) and was stereoselective in binding receptor antagonists: (-)-propranolol greater than (+)-propranolol greater than acebutolol amine. Agonist inhibition of [3H]DHA binding to these antibodies could only be observed at very high concentrations (greater than 10(-4) M agonist), and was not dose-dependent. Finally, the class of anti-alprenolol monoclonal antibodies represented by 2G9 had the lowest antagonist binding affinity of all (IC50 alprenolol = 1 X 10(-5) M), did not demonstrate ligand stereoselectivity, and did not recognize agonists. We propose that antibodies raised against beta-adrenergic receptor ligands demonstrating stereoselective agonist binding will also demonstrate high affinity antagonist binding, and that they will closely parallel the binding characteristics of the receptor. According to this \"agonist best-fit hypothesis,\" anti-idiotypic antibodies raised against the binding site of these idiotypes might contain true mirror images of the beta-adrenergic receptor binding site.", 
    "30": "The relaxation produced by several H2-receptor agonists and forskolin was investigated on strips of guinea-pig lung parenchyma. Dimparit, 1 microM to 10 mM, 4-methyl histamine, 0.5 microM to 100 microM and impromidine, 10 nM to 1 microM, had no effect on the tone of the unstimulated strips of lung parenchyma but caused a dose-dependent relaxation of strips that were contracted by 2-pyridylethylamine (2-PEA), 15 microM. Forskolin, 10 nM to 4 microM, produced a dose-dependent relaxation of both the stimulated and unstimulated lung strips. The muscarinic antagonist atropine, 1 microM, and the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, 10 microM, had no effect on the dose-response curve for dimaprit-induced relaxation of the lung strip. The dose-response curve for dimaprit was shifted to the right in a dose-dependent manner by increasing concentrations of a variety of H2-antagonists. Schild plots produced a straight line for all the H2-antagonists with slopes not significantly different from unity. The equilibrium dissociation constants for the H2-antagonists on the lung strip preparation were similar to those previously reported for inhibition of the chronotropic activity of histamine on guinea-pig right atria and inhibition of [3H]-tiotidine binding to homogenates of guinea-pig lung parenchyma.", 
    "31": "Beta adrenoceptor blockade has become one of the major therapeutic interventions in the medical management of ischaemic heart disease over the last 15 years. A number of beta adrenoceptor blockers have been developed with differing pharmacological properties including cardioselectivity and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). The relevance of this latter property has been in some doubt. A number of reports suggest that ISA confers haemodynamic benefits although there does not appear to be any clear therapeutic advantage. In addition it would appear that patients with severe or rest angina might benefit more from a pure beta antagonist rather than one with ISA when the beta blocker is used as monotherapy, but this situation rarely arises. This paper reviews and assesses the value of treatment of ischaemic heart disease with beta blockers possessing intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.",

Compound 8 showed less potent beta-adrenergic blocking activity than betaxolol in an in vitro test with guinea pig tracheal muscle and left atrium but retained high beta 1-selectivity. Irreversible beta-adrenoceptor antagonism of 8 was assessed by the blockade of the isoproterenol response of the guinea pig atria and by ligand binding studies with rat cerebral cortex.", 
    "34": "Treatment of human serum with DEAE-cellulose in acid conditions almost completely removed alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AG) with little change in the concentration of albumin and beta-lipoprotein, while treatment with sulphosalicylic acid removed almost all the proteins except alpha 1-AG. The binding of various drugs to serum treated as above was measured by equilibrium dialysis and the contribution of alpha 1-AG to drug binding by human serum was assessed. Sulphosalicylic acid-treated serum exhibited a saturable binding for propranolol, which was considered to be due to the binding to alpha 1-AG while DEAE-cellulose-treated serum mostly exhibited non-saturable binding, for which albumin and beta-lipoprotein may be responsible. With this treated serum, alpha 1-AG was estimated to contribute approximately 40% to the binding of therapeutic concentrations of propranolol, 15% to that of imipramine and 15-20% to that of desipramine, respectively, in serum samples pooled from healthy adults. However, no contribution of alpha 1-AG was observed in the binding of salicylic acid to the serum. Dissociation constants of the propranolol binding to the high affinity site in control serum, sulphosalicylic acid-treated serum and purified alpha 1-AG showed similar values (3.7-6.7 microM). These results suggest that treatment of serum with sulphosalicylic acid and DEAE cellulose is useful in assessing the contribution of alpha 1-AG to the serum binding of basic drugs.", 
    "35": "Bisoprolol is a new cardioselective beta-blocker with a long half-life. The efficacy of once daily bisoprolol (10 mg) and atenolol (100 mg) was assessed in 20 patients with stable angina using a placebo controlled double-blind randomized crossover protocol. Efficacy was assessed by computer assisted treadmill exercise testing with monitoring of leads CM5 and CC5, carried out 22-24 h after the last dose. The mean +/- SEM exercise time on placebo was 6.5 +/- 0.4 min increasing to 7.8 +/- 0.5 min on bisoprolol (P less than 0.001) and 8.6 +/- 0.6 mins on atenolol (P less than 0.001). The time to 1 mm ST depression in CM5 and CC5 was also prolonged significantly with both drugs. The mean basal resting heart rate of 84 +/- 4 bpm decreased to 63 +/- 2 bpm on bisoprolol (P less than 0.001) and 64 +/- 3 bpm on atenolol (P less than 0.001), with a significant decrease in the peak exercise heart rate seen with both drugs (P less than 0.001). The peak rate-pressure product was 175 +/- 8 after placebo, 146 +/- 7 (P less than 0.001) with bisoprolol and 149 +/- 5 (P less than 0.001) after atenolol. One patient was withdrawn because he suffered a myocardial infarction. Eighteen patients were prescribed bisoprolol 10 mg once a day for 6 weeks and an exercise test was performed at the end of this period. Bisoprolol retained its efficacy at the end of this period and was well tolerated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "Single doses of bucindolol 50, 100 and 200 mg were compared to placebo and single doses of oxprenolol 40, 80 and 160 mg in seven patients with mild hypertension, in a double-blind randomized study. Both bucindolol and oxprenolol inhibited exercise induced tachycardia. The mean maximum inhibition of exercise heart rate was similar after each dose of both drugs (20%, P less than 0.001). Bucindolol produced a significantly greater reduction in blood pressure than either oxprenolol or placebo. This was most apparent in standing systolic and diastolic and post-exercise systolic blood pressures between 1 and 2 h after dosing and was dose-related. All seven patients experienced adverse effects related to hypotension within the first 2 h after ingestion of bucindolol 200 mg. Plasma concentrations of oxprenolol, bucindolol or 5-hydroxy-bucindolol, sampled 2 h after dosing, could not be related to either the changes in blood pressure or to the occurrence of symptoms. The results emphasise the need for careful dose-finding of new drugs prior to their more widespread evaluation in phase 3 studies.", 
    "37": "The effects of intravenous propranolol 100 micrograms kg-1, sotalol 500 micrograms kg-1, timolol 7.8 micrograms kg-1, atenolol 125 micrograms kg-1 and placebo on essential, physiological and isoprenaline-induced tremor were studied. These beta-adrenoceptor blocker doses produced equal reduction of standing-induced tachycardia in essential tremor patients. Atenolol produced significantly less reduction of essential and isoprenaline-induced tremor than the non-selective drugs, confirming the importance of beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade in these effects. Propranolol and sotalol produced equal maximal inhibition of isoprenaline-induced tremor but propranolol was significantly more effective in reducing essential tremor. The rate of development of the tremorolytic effect was similar in essential, physiological and isoprenaline-induced tremors but all tremor responses developed significantly more slowly than the heart rate responses. It is proposed that these results indicate that the tremorolytic activity of beta-adrenoceptor blockers in essential, physiological and isoprenaline-induced tremor is exerted via the same beta 2-adrenoceptors located in a deep peripheral compartment which is thought to be in the muscle spindles.",

The area under the blood concentration-time curve was increased in the elderly group for each drug, but the difference was statistically significant only for atenolol. The lower serum albumin concentrations in the elderly group did not result in a decrease in the percentage of propranolol or oxprenolol bound to serum proteins.",

    "40": "As part of our studies in normotensive (WKY) and hypertensive (SHR) rats concerning the cardiovascular effects of 240-fold variations in sodium (Na) intake, the present experiments explore how vascular design, smooth-muscle sensitivity to noradrenaline and adrenergic vasoconstrictor fibre function are affected. In vitro comparisons were performed on pair-perfused hindquarter vascular beds and on paired small mesenteric arteries (diameter 150-200 micron), using a two-vessel Mulvany-Halpern myograph. Preparations were taken from WKY and SHR which between 5 and 12-13 weeks of age were on 'low' (LNa, 0.5), 'control' (CNa, 5), 'high' (HNa, 50) or 'very high' (vHNa, 120 mmol Na 100 g-1 food) sodium diets. Structural vascular adaptation occurred only when arterial pressure was altered (only in LNa SHR). In both preparations smooth-muscle sensitivity and dose-response curves to noradrenaline remained unaffected by the Na diets. However, in both LNa groups the frequency-response curves to vasoconstrictor fibre stimulation in the small arteries were displaced to the right of the CNa one, with generally attenuated responses, while the curves of particularly the vHNa arteries were displaced to the left, with enhanced responses. Inhibition of NaKATPase by ouabain particularly enhanced the neurogenic responses, but to similar extents in all Na groups. Thus, low sodium intake apparently reduces the transmitter release/impulse in adrenergic neurons, while it increases the transmitter stores. High sodium intake has the opposite effects. These adaptations of adrenergic neuronal function may be one of the most important long-term consequences of altered sodium intake.", 
    "41": "The sympathetic nervous system is known to innervate the pancreatic islets and to have the capability to influence islet hormone release. The effects are, however, complex since the islet nerves contain catecholaminergic as well as peptidergic fibres, and the catecholamines stimulate alpha- as well as beta-adrenoceptors. The present study was undertaken to establish the possible influence of the alpha-adrenoceptors on basal and stimulated insulin secretion under in vivo conditions. The alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phentolamine was injected at various dose levels i.p. to mice and a dose-dependent increase in plasma concentrations of insulin was seen. The maximal plasma insulin levels were observed 10 min after injection and were accompanied by decreased plasma glucose concentrations. Additionally, plasma glucose levels fell in response to phentolamine by an apparent insulin-independent manner, since at the low dose of 2.6 mumol kg-1, plasma glucose levels did decrease without any apparent increase in plasma insulin levels. After injection of a low dose of phentolamine 10 min prior to a rapid i.v. injection of one of four different insulin secretagogues, the following effects on insulin release were observed. Glucose (+55%) and the cholinergic agonist carbachol (+140%) displayed a potentiated insulin secretory response after phentolamine pretreatment, whereas the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline (-45%) had a blunted, though not abolished, insulin response. The absolute insulin secretory response to CCK-8 was unaffected by phentolamine despite the fact that plasma glucose levels were lowered by phentolamine. In conclusion, phentolamine enhanced insulin secretion and depressed plasma glucose levels in mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "42": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a putative co-transmitter in noradrenergic sympathetic nerves of the cardiovascular system, inhibits the negative chronotropic action of the cardiac vagus. In the present study, peptides related to NPY were tested for potency in producing this effect. In bilaterally vagotomized, anaesthetised dogs, the increase in pulse interval caused by electrical stimulation of the peripheral stump of the right vagus was measured before and after intravenous administration of peptide. The effects of doses of NPY were compared with those of equimolar doses of peptide YY (PYY), and of avian and human pancreatic polypeptides (APP and HPP). PYY inhibited the vagal action more effectively than did NPY. APP and HPP, however, caused no change in strength of vagal action at the doses used. The response to a second injection of NPY, given soon after the injection of APP or HPP, was not significantly different from the original. Thus no evidence was obtained for a competitive inhibition of the action of NPY by either pancreatic polypeptide. A C-terminal hexapeptide fragment of human pancreatic polypeptide was also tested. Like APP and HPP, it neither inhibited the cardiac vagus nor blocked the action of NPY. The order of potency obtained here (PYY greater than NPY much greater than APP, HPP, CFPP) can be expected to be of use in efforts to distinguish the active site(s) of the NPY molecule, and to characterise the receptors involved in these modulatory effects.", 
    "43": "To assess the role of different neuroeffector systems in penile erection, pharmacological agents were tested in vitro using strips of corpus cavernosum tissue from the dog. Alpha-adrenoceptor agonists, K+ or histamine caused concentration-dependent contraction. Tyramine caused a poorly sustained contraction, as did nicotine in some cases. In precontracted preparations, relaxation was caused by beta2-adrenoceptor or muscarinic cholinoceptor agonists, or by vasoactive intestinal peptide. The results suggest that a noradrenergic alpha-adrenoceptor system maintains penile flaccidity in the dog. Penile erection may result from the activation of inhibitory beta2-adrenergic, muscarinic and/or peptidergic systems.", 
    "44": "In order to evaluate accurately affinity characteristics and relative size of populations of receptor-subtypes in one system we analysed three relevant problems encountered in binding assays. Binding to receptors caused a decrease in the free ligand concentration (i.e. \"depletion\"). The neglect of depletion may lead to significant distortions of the estimates of affinity and size of receptor-subtype population when the concentrations of both receptor and ligand are of similar magnitude. The distortion is particularly marked when the affinity of a competing ligand is higher than the affinity of the radioligand. We present a formula that describes binding inhibition in a system with receptor-subtypes under conditions of depletion. Binding data usually exhibit heteroscedasticity (i.e. heterogeneous variance), which can not be neglected especially in a system with receptor heterogeneity. Assuming a log normal distribution of experimental errors and a Poisson distribution for errors due to radioactivity counting we derived a function for the transformation of binding data. Transformed data show homoscedasticity, as illustrated with experiments on membranes of guinea-pig lung using ICI 118,551 as inhibitor of 3H-(-)-bupranolol binding to beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. The hypothesis that affinity characteristics of receptor subtypes are independent of the tissue class can not be tested accurately by the use of standard methods because of interferences of errors between experiments. We propose a method to account for differences between experiments. Assuming invariance of affinity characteristics one is able to perform common fits of data from different tissue classes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "A radioligand that selectively labels beta 2-adrenoceptors, 3H-ICI 118,551 (3H-ICI), is introduced. Experiments were performed on guinea-pig tissues. The binding characteristics of 3H-ICI on lung membrane particles are compared with the blocking characteristics of ICI 118,551 against the tracheo-relaxant effects of (-)-noradrenaline, (-)-adrenaline and (+/-)-fenoterol. Binding to both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors were also performed with 3H-(-)-bupranolol on lung and ventricular myocardium. The binding inhibition characteristics of unlabelled ICI 118,551 on ventricle were compared with its characteristics as antagonist of the positive chronotropic effects of (-)-noradrenaline, (-)-adrenaline and (+/-)-fenoterol in spontaneously beating right atria. 1. ICI 118,551 blocked more the relaxant effects of (+/-)-fenoterol and (-)-adrenaline than those of (-)-noradrenaline on trachea. The positive chronotropic effects of (+/-)-fenoterol on sinoatrial node were blocked more than those of both (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline. A non-linear regression analysis of blocking data with ICI 118,551 according to the model of Lemoine and Kaumann (1983) revelas that both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors contribute to the tracheo-relaxant and positive chronotropic effects of agonists. The estimated equilibrium dissociation constants pKB (-log KB = pKB; mol/l) were 7.1 and 9.6 for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, respectively.

The binding properties of 3H-BIS to membrane particles of kitten heart are compared with the blocking properties of (-)-bisoprolol against stimulant effects of (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline in heart preparations of kitten and guinea pig. 1. On kitten heart tissues (-)-bisoprolol antagonized the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of catecholamines competitively. The effects of (-)-adrenaline were antagonized considerably less by (-)-bisoprolol than the corresponding effects of (-)-noradrenaline on sinoatrial pacemakers. The antagonism was nearly the same against both (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline in left atria and papillary muscles. The data were analyzed with a model for 2-receptor subtypes by non-linear regression. Equilibrium dissociation constants KB (mol/l; -log KB = pKB) for a high-affinity beta 1-adrenoceptor of 8.8 and for a low-affinity beta 2-adrenoceptor of 7.0 were estimated in the three classes of tissues. In kitten sinoatrial pacemaker beta 1-adrenoceptors contribute 76% to the stimulus induced by (-)-adrenaline and 97% to the stimulus induced by (-)-noradrenaline. In ventricle and left atrium beta 1-adrenoceptors contribute 97-99% and 100% to the stimulus caused by (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline, respectively. 2. Both 3H-BIS and unlabelled (-)-bisoprolol caused competitive blockade of the positive chronotropic effects of (-)-noradrenaline in guinea-pig right atria. pKB-values of 8.7 were estimated for both unlabelled and tritiated (-)-bisoprolol. The positive chronotropic effects of (-)-adrenaline were antagonized considerably less by (-)-bisoprolol than those of (-)-noradrenaline in guinea-pig atria. In the presence of low concentrations of beta 2-selective ICI 118,551, which did not antagonize beta 1-adrenoceptor mediated effects, (-)-bisoprolol antagonized positive chronotropic effects of (-)-adrenaline to the same extent as those of (-)-noradrenaline.

    "47": "Present data show that a dose-related increase in calcium concentration [Ca] of submandibular glands of rat occurred after 6 days of twice daily administration of 25, 50 or 75 mg/kg b. wt. doses of the beta 1-adrenergic agonist, dobutamine, or the beta 2-adrenergic agonist, terbutaline. The beta 1-adrenergic receptor was responsible for mediation of these changes with both agonists since the effects of either agonist were prevented when a 10 mg/kg dose of the beta 1-antagonist, atenolol, was injected 20 min prior to the agonist, and the increase induced by either agonist was not prevented when the beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, butoxamine, was given prior to each agonist. Dobutamine caused more marked increases in [Ca] than did terbutaline. The parotid gland, however, showed a decrease with both agonists, and that caused by dobutamine was greater than that caused by terbutaline. Neither antagonist had any effect on the agonist-induced changes in the parotid gland. Reasons for the differences in response of the two glands are suggested. It does not appear, however, that, as suggested previously, the increase in the [Ca] of the submandibular gland is dependent on depletion of glandular levels of norepinephrine (NE). Of the agonists, only dobutamine caused a decrease in glandular concentration of NE, as well as total NE of the gland. With isoproterenol (ISO), NE concentration of parotid and submandibular was reduced, but with terbutaline only that of parotid was reduced. changes in total glandular NE were not found in either gland with either ISO or terbutaline. Thus, the decrease in concentration was a consequence of the increased mass of gland. With cyclocytidine (CC), both NE concentration and total NE were reduced, even though gland size increased. With reserpine (RES), NE concentration as well as total NE were markedly reduced (87-90%), and no change in gland size occurred. It is suggested, on the basis of present data, that prolonged activation of beta 1-adrenoceptors is the cause of the calcium accumulation, and that reduction in NE is not the cause of the calcium increase, but may only be a coincident event. Even with sympathectomy (here induced by reserpine), activation of beta-receptors over a long period of time is suggested as the cause of the calcium change, not the depletion of NE. The present data also provide the first evidence that CC causes NE depletion.", 
    "48": "Gastric responses to electrical stimulation of the vagus and splanchnic nerves and to esophageal distension were observed in studies of the reflex control of the gastric motility in anesthetized guinea pigs in vivo. The gastric motility was inhibited by both vago-vagal and splanchno-vagal reflexes through the activation of non-adrenergic inhibitory nerve fibers and by splanchno-splanchnic reflex through the inactivation of the intramural cholinergic excitatory neurons. Distension of the lower esophagus caused a relaxation of the stomach which was mediated by an intrinsic reflex via intramural non-adrenergic inhibitory neurons. Furthermore, stimulation of the splanchnic nerve innervating the stomach seems to activate adrenergic inhibitory, cholinergic excitatory and probably some non-adrenergic inhibitory fibers.", 
    "49": "Studies of digitalis have revealed an appreciable role of the autonomic nervous system in the modulation of the cardiovascular toxicity of digitalis. Neuraxis transection experiments and studies using digitalis compounds that fail to enter the central nervous system suggest that centers located in the floor of the fourth cerebral ventricle play a substantial part in the neural arrhythmogenic effects of the digitalis glycosides. Electrical stimulation of the area postrema in partially digitalized animals, not otherwise manifesting ventricular arrhythmias, elicits ventricular tachycardia. Neuraxis transection experiments and studies with a charged digitalis derivative also suggest localization of the coronary vasoconstrictive properties of digitalis to the area postrema. The results suggest that this region of the brainstem is sensitive to a neurally active substance, digitalis, causing peripheral sympathetic effects of considerable consequence.", 
    "50": "This review presents the wide spectrum of cutaneous and extracutaneous side effects of beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking agents. In addition, personal clinical observations are described. An induction period before the occurrence of clinical manifestations is characteristic, which is usually of approximately 1 year duration. The clinical picture is extremely polymorphous and may imitate many classical dermatoses. Psoriasiform, lichen planus-like, and eczematous \"chronic\" rashes are mainly observed. When these are associated with serious, sometimes life-threatening damage to other organs, they result in syndromelike symptom complexes. This is exemplified by the oculomucocutaneous syndrome and the pseudolupus erythematosus syndrome. Fibrinous peritonitis, in particular, may be lethal. In most cases, the histology of the cutaneous side effects corresponds to a lichenoid drug eruption. The pathogenetic mechanisms which appear to operate are the pharmacological effect on the epidermal beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase-cyclic AMP system, on the one hand, and heterogeneous immunological reactions on the other. It may be concluded that caution should be observed in long-term therapy with beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking drugs.", 
    "51": "In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study, 108 hypertensive patients were treated with either chlorthalidone 25 mg or slow-release metoprolol 200 mg both given once daily over 4 weeks. Blood pressure and heart rate at rest and at the peak of an isometric exercise test (30% of maximal voluntary contraction for 3 min) were recorded at random and at the end of the study. Both treatments induced a significant (p less than 0.01) blood pressure reduction at rest and at the peak exercise, 50.0% of patients on chlorthalidone and 59.2% on metoprolol, respectively, having a lying diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mmHg. A weak but significant (p less than 0.001) positive correlation was found between age and change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure after chlorthalidone. Such a relationship was absent in the metoprolol group, where a significant (p less than 0.01) positive correlation was found between diastolic pressure rise from rest to the peak exercise at randomization, and the reduction in resting diastolic pressure at the end of the study. Treatments were well tolerated, only a decrease (p less than 0.05) in serum potassium (from 4.4 to 4.0 mEq/l) in the chlorthalidone group was observed. Results suggest that age may influence the antihypertensive response to chlorthalidone, while diastolic pressure rise in isometric exercise may predict the degree of pressure response to sustained beta-adrenergic blockade with metoprolol.", 
    "52": "Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy can present in a number of different ways, with the majority of patients having heart failure. Natural history studies show a poor prognosis for most patients with this disease. However, a substantial number may stabilize or even improve, and have a survival curve similar to patients without the disease. Patients can be stratified for relative risk of mortality by age, cardiomegaly on chest roentgenograph, ventricular function, and quantitative assessment of ventricular arrhythmias. Therapy can be divided into three categories: alteration of factors associated or contributors to ventricular dysfunction, supportive therapy, and investigational therapy. The efficacy of therapy should be judged by its effect on functional capacity and survivorship. The first category includes controlling hypertension and abstaining from alcohol. This often leads to improved functional status, and may improve survival. The second category includes anticoagulant therapy and, most importantly, medications for heart failure (digoxin, diuretics, vasodilators, nonglycoside inotropes, etc.). These agents may improve functional status, but in general have had little impact on survival. Investigational medical therapy for future use depends upon identification of factors involved in the genesis of the disease and the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for morbidity and mortality. The inflammatory component in the genesis and/or maintenance of cardiomyopathy, the importance of frequent ventricular arrhythmias in prognosis and the influence of endogenous vasoconstrictors on heart failure and arrhythmias, have been mentioned as such areas of interest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Early recognition and vigorous medical therapy decrease the mortality rate in a significant way. We present twelve giant duodenal ulcers in which the radiological findings are discussed. Medical therapy with H2 blockers is stressed. There was no mortality in our series of patients.", 
    "54": "To examine the beta-adrenergic effects of the catecholamines in poorly controlled diabetes, we have studied insulin-deprived alloxan-diabetic (A-D) dogs during 90 min of moderate exercise (100 m/min, 10-12 degrees) alone (C) or with propranolol (5 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1) (P) or combined P and somatostatin infusion (0.5 microgram . kg-1 . min-1) (P + St). In P, in contrast to C, immunoreactive glucagon (IRG) rose only after 50 min of exercise. However, hepatic glucose production (Ra) rose normally. In P + St, IRG fell 50% below basal, and the Ra response to exercise was abolished. Interestingly, in P and P + St, glucose metabolic clearance rate (MCR) rose by 400% above the inadequate MCR response to exercise in C, despite 30% lower insulin levels. Compared with C, free fatty acids (FFA) and lactate were sharply reduced during P and P + St. Plasma glucose (G) did not change in C, but due to elevated glucose uptake, G fell over 120 mg/dl in P, and due to diminished Ra, G fell 170 mg/dl in P + St. Norepinephrine was similar in all groups. Epinephrine and cortisol were higher in P + St by 90 min of exercise, perhaps as a result of hypoglycemia. In summary, during exercise in poorly controlled A-D dogs, beta-blockade does not appear to affect Ra; beta-blockade leads to diminished mobilization of extrahepatic substrate as evidenced by reduced FFA and lactate levels; beta-blockade increases MCR to levels seen in normal dogs during exercise alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "55": "The long term effects on blood pressure, body fluid volumes, glomerular filtration rate and plasma renin concentration were studied in 11 patients with essential hypertension during treatment with prizidilol, which is an antihypertensive compound with combined vasodilatator and beta-adrenoceptor blocking actions. After the patients had been treated for four weeks with placebo, the active treatment was given for 12 weeks. Prizidilol reduced both supine and erect blood pressure by 26/14 mmHg (p less than 0.01) and 24/16 mmHg (p less than 0.01) respectively, without inducing significant changes in heart rate. Plasma volume increased significantly by eight percent (p less than 0.02), whereas the increase in extracellular fluid volume was insignificant. Glomerular filtration rate decreased by 4 ml/min./1.73 m2 (p less than 0.02). Plasma renin concentration was unchanged. Prizidilol was tolerated well, but six patients developed oedema and gained weight, which necessitated addition of diuretics in three patients.", 
    "56": "The maternal cardiovascular system undergoes extensive changes during pregnancy. These changes become especially important in women with underlying cardiac disease. In order to provide a basis for understanding cardiac disease in pregnancy, the authors provide a discussion of the normal cardiovascular physiology of pregnancy, followed by a review of the types of heart disease in women of childbearing age.", 
    "57": "When mean arterial pressure exceeds 140 mmHg (equivalent to 180/120), there is a significant risk of maternal cerebral vascular damage. Therefore it is recommended that blood pressures greater than 170/110 should be treated with urgency, aiming to maintain the blood pressure at all times at less than 170/110 but not lower than 130/90. Parenteral hydralazine is effective and safe therapy. Labetalol (intravenously or orally) appears to be as effective and as safe, and causes fewer troublesome side effects; however, clinical experience of its use is more limited, particularly in relation to its safety for the fetus and neonate. Delivery of the fetus is usually the definitive management of severe hypertension in pregnancy. However, this action may not reduce the blood pressure immediately. After initial treatment with rapid-acting agents, it is often advantageous to maintain control of arterial pressure with ongoing oral therapy (methyldopa, labetalol). In addition to the protective effect on the mother, such therapy may allow delivery of the fetus to be deferred; this should be considered only if the fetus is significantly premature (e.g., less than 34 weeks), there is no other evidence of maternal or fetal distress, and there can be meticulous monitoring of the maternal and fetal state proceeding to prompt delivery if deterioration occurs. The indications for treatment of mild or moderate hypertension in pregnancy are less clear. Severe hypertensive episodes can be reduced by several drugs (methyldopa, labetalol, beta-blockers). Methyldopa appears to reduce the small risk of mid-trimester abortions seen in association with early hypertension. Other benefits may be possible with other individual drugs; however, none of these have been found consistently in controlled studies to date. There seems, therefore, to be no definite indication for treatment of mild hypertension in pregnancy; treatment of moderate hypertension may be reasonable but its value is unproved at present. Antihypertensive drugs are valuable in pregnancy to reduce the risks directly due to elevated blood pressure. These drugs are not expected to affect the evolution of preeclampsia nor to treat the other complications of this condition.",

A thorough understanding of the factors influencing a given response, as well as the biochemical and physiologic changes that occur, ultimately will be translated into improved modalities of therapy.", 
    "59": "Propranolol, sotalol and nadolol have been infused into conscious dogs, and doses at which the three drugs are equipotent as beta-adrenoceptor antagonists determined. In euthyroid dogs, sotalol was more effective at lowering heart-rate than an equivalent dose of propranolol, while an equivalent dose of nadolol was without effect. Hyperthyroidism potentiated the lowering of heart-rate by sotalol, but inhibited that by propranolol. The effect of sotalol on heart-rate was correlated with its prolongation of the Q-T interval of the ECG. That of propranolol was correlated with its prolongation of the P-R interval. Nadolol did not affect P-R interval or Q-T interval except at relatively high dosage. We conclude that the tachycardia of hyperthyroidism is not affected by blockade of beta-adrenoceptors and therefore that it is not mediated by adrenergic mechanisms. The effectiveness of propranolol and sotalol in lowering heart-rate must be due to actions peculiar to those drugs, and not to beta-adrenoceptor antagonism.", 
    "60": "Electromagnetic flow metering was used in acute experiments on cats to study the cardiac output (CO) and venous return (VR) changes under pressor reactions in response to noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) infusion. The CO increased in 2/3 and decreased in 1/3 of all observations in response to NA infusion. In half of observations, the VR had the same line of changes as the CO. Similar changes in the CO and VR were obtained after A infusion. The blockade of beta- and M-cholinoreceptors did not affect the magnitude of CO changes in response to NA infusion but played a certain role in response to A infusion. The level of the arterial blood pressure under which the increase of the CO in response to NA infusion was mostly recorded has been established.", 
    "61": "In nonasthmatic subjects with normal airway responsiveness to methacholine, maximal airway narrowing is limited to a mild or moderate degree. We investigated whether the maximal response plateau or the position of the dose-response curve is due to functional inhibition by neurogenic mechanisms or to prostaglandin release. Four nonasthmatics inhaled doubling concentrations of methacholine up to 256 mg/ml (67 mg delivered during tidal breathing), followed by 4-fold-increasing doses of salbutamol up to 80 mg/ml (24 mg during tidal breathing) on 5 separate days. On each day 30 min before the test, the subjects inhaled (using a dosimeter) saline, propranolol (11 mg), or hexamethonium (910 mg) or, 2 h before the test, ingested indomethacin (75 mg) or placebo. The response to methacholine was measured from volume history standardized partial and complete maximal expiratory flow-volume curves, as FEV1 and the flows at 40% of the control FVC (V40p and V40c). Compared with saline, on average, baseline V40p was 18% lower after propranolol and 18% higher after hexamethonium. Indomethacin did not affect baseline values. There was no systematic difference between the 5 days in the dose of methacholine to cause a 10% fall in FEV1 or a 40% fall in V40p, or in the maximal response with FEV1, V40p, and V40c, or in V40p/V40c at 256 mg/ml methacholine. We conclude that limited maximal airway narrowing to methacholine in nonasthmatics is not due to a change in adrenergic, cholinergic, or ganglion-transmitted-nonadrenergic inhibitory activity nor to the release of prostaglandins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "62": "The subtypes of postjunctional alpha-adrenoceptors in the feline pulmonary vascular bed were studied using selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists. Under conditions of controlled pulmonary blood flow and constant left atrial pressure, intralobar injections of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists, phenylephrine and methoxamine, and the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists, UK 14,304 and BHT 933, increased lobar arterial pressure in a dose-related manner. Prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, reduced responses to phenylephrine and methoxamine to a greater extent than responses to UK 14,304 and BHT 933. Yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocker, decreased responses to UK 14,304 and BHT 933 without altering responses to phenylephrine or methoxamine. The same pattern of blockade was observed in animals pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine, an agent that destroys the integrity of adrenergic nerve terminals. However, in propranolol-treated animals, prazosin antagonized responses to phenylephrine and methoxamine without altering responses to UK 14,304 or BHT 933, and the selectivity of the blocking effects of yohimbine were preserved. Responses to intralobar injections of norepinephrine were markedly decreased by prazosin, whereas yohimbine had only a small effect. These data suggest the presence of both postjunctional alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors mediating vasoconstriction in the pulmonary vascular bed. These results also indicate that the vasoconstrictor responses to injected norepinephrine in the cat pulmonary vascular bed are due mainly to activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "63": "The activity of the angiotensin I converting enzyme was measured in 55 patients with untreated essential hypertension, 11 patients with untreated renovascular hypertension, five patients with untreated primary aldosteronism, and 23 normotensive subjects. Converting enzyme activity was significantly higher (p less than 0.025 or less) in essential hypertension (28 +/- 1 units/ml) and renovascular hypertension (28.5 +/- 3 units/ml) when compared with the activity in the normotensive subjects (21 +/- 1.5 units/ml). Seventeen (31 percent) of the patients with essential hypertension and three (27 percent) patients with renovascular hypertension had an elevated converting enzyme activity above the mean +2 standard deviations value of the normotensive subjects (32.8 units/ml), ranging from 33 to 55.8 units/ml. Converting enzyme activity was similar in black and white patients and in male and female patients, but it tended to decrease with increasing age in both the hypertensive and the normotensive subjects. In the untreated patients with essential hypertension (n = 55), converting enzyme activity was inversely related to mean arterial pressure and age (r = -0.34, p less than 0.01) and positively related to plasma renin activity (r = 0.31, p less than 0.05). Converting enzyme activity was always decreased during captopril therapy, and it was not affected by beta blockers, but it was increased by diuretics. These findings indicate that converting enzyme activity is elevated in patients with essential and renovascular hypertension.", 
    "64": "Balloon distention of the left pulmonary artery (PA) was produced in 14 lambs (aged 1 to 3 days) to assess whether an increase in systemic vascular resistance results from such distention. The lambs were anesthetized with chloralose and instrumented to enable measurement of systemic blood flow, PA pressure, aortic pressure, heart rate and right atrial pressure. PA distention resulted in an increase in systemic vascular resistance and aortic pressure (p less than 0.05). This result was probably due to a systemic vasoconstrictor response, since systemic blood flow and right atrial pressure did not change significantly. Limited trials using autonomic blocking agents suggested that the response is either a reflex under autonomic control or a response to humoral release of alpha-adrenergic substances. In conclusion, some interdependence appears to exist between the systemic and pulmonary vascular beds. It is postulated that such changes may be important in fetal life when they may affect redistribution of cardiac output during adaptation to hypoxemia.", 
    "65": "Major developments in the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure have occurred since the discovery of captopril in June 1975. Early in the past decade, this oral ACE inhibitor was restricted to refractory and severe cases of hypertension. By July 1985, the Food and Drug Administration approved its use not only for all degrees of hypertension but also for the initial treatment of hypertensive patients with uncomplicated disease. New information has confirmed the effectiveness of twice-daily administration (which favorably influences compliance) and the lack of a need to monitor blood or urine levels to assure safety. The renin-mediated and non-renin-mediated mechanisms of action of captopril-induced ACE inhibition have been fully delineated, as has its side effect profile, which does not include various CNS, sympathetic reflex, and metabolic side effects seen with other antihypertensive agents. As the first vasodilator to prove its efficacy in the acute and chronic treatment of congestive heart failure to the FDA, captopril is now widely used throughout the United States. ACE inhibition reduces symptoms, enhances exercise capacity, and favorably affects sodium, water, and potassium homeostasis in patients with heart failure. Also, recent but as yet unconfirmed evidence suggests that ACE inhibition may prolong survival in these patients. The success of captopril, the first oral agent of this class, promises to hold true for other ACE inhibitors (such as enalapril), which have similar activities but differing pharmacokinetic properties and will soon be available for clinical use. Further information on these newer agents is anxiously awaited. In the near future, the clinician will undoubtedly be able to choose from a large selection of ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Therefore, it is important to learn about any meaningful differences among ACE inhibitors and to contrast this class of agents with older, standard therapies. This learning process is crucial as we assess whether newer agents offer clinical advantages over the old.", 
    "66": "Protein catabolism following injury is associated with elevated levels of the stress hormones cortisol, glucagon, and the catecholamines. To study the effect of hormonal blockade on catabolic responses to surgery, 16 dogs underwent general anesthesia, a standard abdominal operation, and implantation of aortic and caval catheters. Five received phentolamine and propranolol continuously, at doses which block catecholamine effects. To prevent the rise in both catecholamines and cortisol, 6 received a high epidural anesthetic (T4-S3), started preoperatively and continued for 24 hr. Five dogs served as controls. Hindquarter amino acid flux was measured at 6 and 24 hr post-op. Pre- and post-op skeletal muscle biopsies were analyzed for amino acids. Urinary nitrogen was measured over 24 hr. Urinary nitrogen excretion was unaffected by treatment, but urinary creatinine fell from 0.039 +/- 0.002 g/24 hr X kg for controls to 0.03 +/- 0.002 for the epidural group and 0.031 +/- 0.001 for alpha and beta blockade (P less than 0.05). Hindquarter amino acid nitrogen efflux was decreased from -19.05 +/- 4.06 mumole/min X kg in controls to -8.98 +/- 0.86 in the epidural and -6.89 +/- 1.21 in the alpha- and beta-blockade groups (P less than 0.05). The urinary nitrogen loss, glutamine efflux, and fall in muscle glutamine produced by the operation were not prevented by either form of hormonal blockade, but hindquarter nitrogen efflux was diminished. Hormonal blockade inhibits net skeletal muscle protein catabolism without altering whole-body nitrogen loss. Hormones and other factors must be responsible for the increased ureagenesis that occurs following injury.", 
    "67": "A series of 4,5-dihydro-6-[4-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)phenyl]-3(2H)-pyridazinones and related compounds were synthesized and evaluated for positive inotropic activity. Most members of this series produced dose-related increases in myocardial contractility that were associated with relatively minor increases in heart rate and decreases in systemic arterial blood pressure. Introduction of a methyl substituent at the 5-position of 1 (CI-914) produced the most potent compound in this series (11, CI-930). Compound 1 is more potent than amrinone whereas compound 11 is more potent than milrinone. The inotropic effects of 1 and 11 are not mediated via stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors. Selective inhibition of cardiac phosphodiesterase fraction III represents the principal component of the positive inotropic action of 1 and 11.", 
    "68": "High-K+ (30 mM)-evoked release of endogenous epinephrine in hypothalamic slices from three rats in the presence of tetrodotoxin, 3 X 10(-7) M, was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with an electrochemical detector. Spontaneous and evoked release of epinephrine was markedly reduced, when rats were pretreated with 2,3-dichloro-alpha-methylbenzylamine, an inhibitor of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, the enzyme catalyzing the formation of epinephrine from norepinephrine, 80 mg/kg i.p., before decapitation. The amount of epinephrine released during the resting state was lower by a factor of approximately 2 orders than that of norepinephrine and dopamine but was consistently higher than the limit of the sensitivity of this assay system, 0.1 to 0.3 pmol. The evoked release of epinephrine was Ca++ dependent. Isoproterenol, 10(-8) M to 10(-7) M, dose dependently increased this parameter. I-Propranolol, 3 X 10(-8) M, shifted the dose-effect curve of isoproterenol to the right. Atenolol, 10(-6) M, and butoxamine, 3 X 10(-8) M, beta-1 and beta-2 antagonists, respectively, antagonized the action of isoproterenol, 3 X 10(-8) M. Tazolol, 3 X 10(-7) and 10(-6) M, a beta-1 agonist, and salbutamol, 10(-8) and 3 X 10(-8) M, a beta-2 agonist, dose dependently increased the evoked release of epinephrine. I-Propranolol, 3 X 10(-7) M and 3 X 10(-6) M alone, dose dependently decreased this parameter, but the d-isomer produced no effect. Clonidine, 10(-8) and 10(-7) M, an alpha-2 agonist, dose dependently decreased the parameter, and this decrease was antagonized by yohimbine, 10(-6) M, an alpha-2 antagonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "The membrane potential of cultured porcine thyroid follicular cells depolarized by up to 20 mV from the resting value of about -73 mV on exposure to beta-adrenoceptor agonists. A similar response was induced by TSH or dibutyryl cyclic AMP. alpha-Adrenoceptor agonists were without effect. The receptor subtype was shown to be (at least predominantly) beta 2 by the order of potency for beta-agonists (isoprenaline approximately equal to fenoterol much greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline) and by the relative potency of selective beta-antagonists (ICI 118,551 much greater than atenolol). The alpha-agonist phenylephrine had no effect on the TSH response but weakly inhibited the beta-agonist response. Rather than a physiological antagonism between alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses, this effect was shown to be due to the weak beta-antagonist effect of phenylephrine since the alpha-antagonist phentolamine failed to potentiate the depolarizing response to the mixed agonist noradrenaline, and also failed to block the inhibitory action of phenylephrine on the beta-agonist effect. Sensitivity to beta-agonist was enhanced by omission of serum from the culture medium and reduced by exposure to beta-agonists or a high concentration of TSH or dibutyryl cyclic AMP.", 
    "70": "The effects of nadolol (or placebo) and carbimazole on thyrotoxic tremor were investigated in 18 thyrotoxic patients. Both nadolol and carbimazole produced significant reductions in tremor power although nadolol did not cause any change in serum free tri-iodothyronine and free thyroxine concentrations. The results are discussed in terms of the pathogenesis of thyrotoxic tremor and the potential usefulness of tremor in the investigation of adrenergic mechanisms in thyrotoxicosis.", 
    "71": "We studied the pharmacokinetics and beta-blocking effects of a single, oral 20 mg dose of timolol in six poor metabolizers (PMs) and six extensive metabolizers (EMs) of debrisoquin. The plasma timolol concentration was significantly higher in PMs than in EMs. There was a fourfold difference in mean AUC (1590 +/- 1133 vs. 394 +/- 239 ng X hr/ml; P less than 0.01) and a twofold difference in mean t1/2 (7.5 +/- 3 vs. 3.7 +/- 1.7 hours; P less than 0.01), reflecting differences in oral clearance (13.1 +/- 7.8 vs. 48.5 +/- 23.2 L/hr; P less than 0.01). The degree of beta-blockade was greater in PMs than in EMs at 12 hours (30.9% vs. 18.2%; P less than 0.05) and at 24 hours (28.3% vs. 13.1%; P less than 0.05). In the group as a whole the metabolic ratio correlated positively with both kinetic data and beta-blockade, but some overlap was observed. Hence timolol metabolism appears to be subject to debrisoquin-type polymorphism, which results in interphenotypic variation in plasma concentration and beta-blocking effect.", 
    "72": "The effect of the oncogenic beta-blocker DL-1-(2-nitro-3-methyl-phenoxy)-3-tert-butyl-amino-propan-2-ol (DL-ZAMI 1305) on intercellular communication between cultured cells was studied. Intercellular communication of Chinese hamster V79 cells was measured by the dye-transfer method in which the spread of intracellularly microinjected fluorescent probe, Lucifer Yellow CH, through gap-junctions was used as an index of intercellular communication. When V79 cells are cultured with non-toxic doses (1-60 micrograms/ml) of DL-ZAMI 1305, a significant inhibition of dye-transfer is observed after 4 h. The inhibition is dose-related and greater than 90% inhibition is seen at the dose of 50 micrograms/ml. When DL-ZAMI 1305 is added at 0 and 24 h of experiment, its inhibitory effect is maintained for at least 48 h at high doses (50-60 micrograms/ml), whereas for lower doses of DL-ZAMI 1305, some recovery is seen after 24 h incubation. These results are suggestive of a possible tumor-promoting activity of DL-ZAMI 1305; in vivo studies on this carcinogen are in progress.", 
    "73": "To clarify physiological roles of catecholaminergic systems in the control of rabbit prolactin (PRL) release, the effect of various catecholamine receptor antagonists on plasma PRL levels was examined in conscious, freely moving male rabbits. An intravenous (iv) injection of yohimbin (2.5 mg/kg body wt), an alpha 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist, but not prazosin (2 mg/kg body wt), an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, resulted in a significant elevation of plasma PRL. Conversely, propranolol (2.5 mg/kg body wt, iv), a nonselective beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist, and metoprolol (2.6 mg/kg body wt, iv), a beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, slightly but significantly suppressed basal levels of plasma PRL. On the other hand, haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg body wt, iv), pimozide (0.3 mg/kg body wt, iv), sulpiride (5 mg/kg body wt, iv), chlorpromazine (3 mg/kg body wt, iv), and YM-09151-2 (0.2 mg/kg body wt, iv), all dopamine receptor antagonists caused a significant increase in plasma PRL. These results suggest that dopaminergic and alpha 2-adrenergic mechanisms exert a tonic inhibitory role and beta-adrenergic mechanisms, probably beta 1, a tonic stimulatory role in the regulation of PRL release in the rabbit.", 
    "74": "Esmolol is a new ultra short-acting (half-life [t1/2] beta 9 min) beta 1-adrenergic-receptor antagonist reported to have no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. The safety and efficacy of esmolol in lowering the ventricular rate and rate-pressure product in patients with acute myocardial infarction (n = 5), postmyocardial infarction angina (n = 10), or acute unstable angina (n = 4), and without cardiogenic shock were studied. After a 30 min observation period, esmolol was titrated to a maximum dose of 300 micrograms/kg/min and infused for up to 420 min. The ventricular rate fell from 92 +/- 11 (mean +/- SD) to 77 +/- 13 beats/min (p less than .01) and the systolic arterial pressure decreased from 120 +/- 13 to 97 +/- 11 mm Hg (p less than .01) during the initial 30 min titration period. There was no significant change during the maintenance phase, and both the ventricular rate and arterial pressure returned rapidly toward baseline values within 30 min of termination of the infusion. The cardiac index fell from 2.8 +/- 0.6 to 2.2 +/- 0.6 liters/min/m2 (p less than .01) during the same period, and also returned to the baseline level 30 min after termination of the infusion. There was no significant change in the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, respiratory rate, or PR interval. Five patients required termination of infusion because of hypotension and all recovered uneventfully within 30 min of stopping the esmolol. One patient required a brief infusion of dopamine to restore hemodynamic stability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
