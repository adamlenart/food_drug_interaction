    "0": "1. In recent years evidence has accumulated which indicates that although various beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are equally effective in lowering blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension the mechanisms of action of the different drugs are heterogeneous. 2. Pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with pronounced intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) appears, to some extent, to act via peripheral vascular mechanisms. 3. Following prolonged treatment with pindolol in essential hypertension peripheral vascular resistance at maximal vasodilatation has been found to be decreased compared with the pretreatment values suggesting that the structural vascular changes characteristic of established hypertension may be reversible.", 
    "1": "1. Haemodynamic changes during the onset of the antihypertensive action of pindolol, 10 mg twice daily, and propranolol, 80 mg three times daily, were studied for 24 h in two groups of 10 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. 2. Baseline haemodynamics were not different between the two groups. 3. Pindolol, with considerable intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) exerted its maximal antihypertensive efficacy within 3-4 after dosing (-15 +/- 3%, mean +/- s.e. mean, P less than 0.001). This effect was maintained for 24 h. 4. After propranolol, which is devoid of ISA, arterial pressure fell more gradually, but after 24 h the two drugs shared an equal antihypertensive effect. 5. Cardiac output rose after pindolol by 16 +/- 5% (P less than 0.01). It decreased transiently by 16 +/- 6% (P less than 0.01) 1-4 h after propranolol. At that time vascular resistance had risen by 18 +/- 5% (P less than 0.001). 6. The onset of the antihypertensive action of the two drugs was associated with reductions in vascular resistance. Since reflex vasoconstriction did not occur after pindolol, vascular resistance was always lower on this drug than on propranolol (-29 +/- 4%, P less than 0.001 vs -15 +/- 5%, P less than 0.01). 7. Cardiac filling pressures, pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance did not change after pindolol but they rose after propranolol. 8. During the onset of the vasodilator and antihypertensive effects of the two beta-adrenoceptor blockers heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output rose, despite cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade, suggesting a reduction of parasympathetic tone and an increase in venous return.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "1. Elucidation of some of the mechanisms responsible for blood pressure elevation in pregnancy has permitted therapy to be based on more rational principles. The decreased arterial reactivity encountered in normotensive pregnancy is most likely mediated by prostaglandins; preventive therapy using low dose aspirin is an option to prevent development of proteinuria in pre-existing hypertension and provide prophylaxis against pregnancy-induced hypertension. 2. Antihypertensive therapy utilizing sympathetic inhibition with either methyldopa or alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade yields the most promising results. Vasodilation with hydralazine, calcium entry blockers (nifedipine), intravenous labetalol or diazoxide is primarily used in severely hypertensive patients. The use of orally administered nifedipine in severely hypertensive women is associated with encouraging results. 3. It is clear that women with blood pressure levels greater than 170/110 mm Hg need antihypertensive therapy for maternal safety; it remains to be proven to what extent foetal growth and welfare can be improved in women with diastolic pressure levels 85-110 mm Hg when adrenoceptor blocking agents are used for blood pressure control. Initial studies are suggestive of improved foetal growth, prevention of proteinuria and the respiratory distress syndrome but more long-term controlled studies are required. 4. In a recent study, at our institution, of foetal growth during long term antihypertensive therapy, treatment with pindolol yielded better foetal growth than therapy with atenolol. It is as yet unclear whether the ISA or beta 2-mediated vasodilation associated with pindolol was responsible for the improved foetal growth. Further controlled studies are indicated in hypertension in pregnancy to confirm the suggested benefits of beta-adrenoceptor blocker therapy.", 
    "3": "Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, has been proposed previously as potentially useful in the treatment of certain otherwise treatment-unresponsive psychotic patients. This article reviews the published clinical trials of the efficacy of propranolol in schizophrenia to characterize those patients in whom it might be helpful and for whom future clinical trials should be designed. Despite a large number of inconsistent reports, the evidence to date favors its potential value as an adjunct to neuroleptic therapy in neuroleptic-resistant chronic schizophrenic patients. Several recommendations are made to improve the methodology of future clinical trials with this agent for the treatment of schizophrenia.", 
    "4": "Plasma volume, total peripheral resistance, and cardiac output are the predominant factors for maintaining adequate blood pressure. However, mineralocorticoid excess, as in certain types of adrenogenital syndrome, an increased plasma volume may lead to hypertension. Renal diseases with activation of the renin-angiotensin-system induce hypertension by augmentation of the total peripheral resistance. Finally, increased cardiac output in the juvenile hyperkinetic syndrome is the primary factor for arterial hypertension. This simplified concept of the pathogenesis of hypertension appears to be helpful for the first choice of three categories of antihypertensive agents, which are diuretics, vasodilators and beta-adrenergic blockers. However, it has to be considered that changing one of the three blood pressure determining parameters may have an effect on the two others counteracting the pharmacotherapeutic intervention. So vasodilatation leads to increased fluid retention and raised plasma volume and/or induces reflex tachycardia with increased cardiac output. Thus, a combined treatment with two or three drugs with different antihypertensive effects are frequently needed. A standard combination may include all three antihypertensive principles, such as hydrochlorothiazide--as a diuretic and a mild vasodilator--and propranolol. When blood pressure level does not return to normal under these antihypertensive regimen despite adequate dosage, a specialist ought to be consulted who may consider additional pharmacointerventions with e.g. a potent direct vasodilator, such as minoxidil, the alpha-adrenergic blocker prazosin, the calcium-antagonist nifedipine or the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. In case of malignant hypertension transfer of the patient to a specialized center is mandatory.", 
    "5": "The effects of a 2-year treatment with high-dose propranolol (mean, 340 +/- 135 mg/day) and verapamil (mean, 493 +/- 136 mg/day) were compared in two groups of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Both groups were broadly identical at the beginning of the trial and were formed of matched pairs. Out of 137 patients entering the study, 37 pairs completed the 2 year follow-up. The mean group symptomatology (NYHA-classification) improved significantly only following verapamil treatment. Individual improvement was seen more often following verapamil (V), but deterioration was almost exclusively seen during propranolol (P) treatment. Reduction of the Sokolow-index was significant in the V group only. Reduction in the resting heart rate and maximum gradient was more pronounced following P. No correlation could be found between the change in clinical symptoms and electrocardiographic, echocardiographic or hemodynamic data, nor to the dosage of V or P administered. From clinical and echocardiographic findings and in respect of side effects, V is advantageous over P in the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, although a considerable number of patients improve after P. Objective data do not allow one to anticipate responders or non-responders to either treatment.", 
    "6": "The aim of the study was to prove the correlations between systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and plasma renin activity (PRA) under mental arithmetic stress without and with beta-blockade. 22 male hypertensive patients (aged 19-39 years) were examined, divided into a group treated with d, 1-propranolol (Obsidan) and a control group receiving placebo. Under arithmetic stress the kinetics of systolic BP showed no differences even after beta-blockade. In contrast, the increases of HR and PRA before, during and after mental arithmetic were either significantly reduced (HR) or completely blocked (PRA) under beta-blockade. However, these suppressions of HR and PRA did not prevent the stress-induced elevations of systolic and diastolic BP under beta-blockade.", 
    "7": "1. 36 acute schizophrenic patients were randomly assigned to dextro-propranolol or placebo in a double blind trial lasting four weeks. 2. Detailed assessments were made using the Present State Examination, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Manchester Scale before, during and at the end of the trial. 3. The authors report on the change in depressive symptomatology during the period of the trial. 4. One patient in each group became suicidal and was withdrawn at week 2 1/2. 5. With regard to ratings of depression, there was an overall reduction in mean depression scores at the end of the trial in both groups. 6. Emergence of depressive symptoms and increase in the severity of existing symptoms was seen in a small number of patients in both groups, but more so in the placebo group. 7. A depressogenic effect for d-propranolol was not observed in the population studied.", 
    "8": "Indirect automatic 24-hour blood pressure monitoring has been found to be reliable and valid and thus has been introduced for the evaluation of dosage and efficacy of antihypertensive drugs. The present double-blind placebo-controlled randomized long-term study reports the therapeutic results of the oral administration of a new beta-adrenergic blocking agent, carvedilol, with direct vasodilator activity in patients with primary hypertension. The antihypertensive effect was acute at onset and comparable in the supine and standing position judged by casual blood pressure readings. Indirect automatic blood pressure monitoring demonstrated a good antihypertensive effect throughout daily activities after single oral dosage. Despite some technical problems with the apparatus (Pressurometer III, Del Mar Avionics), a circadian pattern could be documented in both untreated and treated patients. Blood pressure and heart rate were normally distributed but less variable during treatment. The long-lasting antihypertensive effect was comparable to the commonly used beta-blocker metoprolol. A significantly reduced awakening blood pressure in the morning may indicate a beneficial effect on a possible prognostic factor in arterial hypertension.", 
    "9": "Exercise performance was examined in 30 hypertensive subjects (mean age 43.2 +/- 5.4 years) in WHO group I-II, allocated to placebo, atenolol and labetalol treatment during a 3 X 12 weeks' exercise training period. Total work did not show any differences between the placebo and the two treatment periods. Compared to placebo, total cholesterol was reduced by 4.6% (p less than 0.04) in the labetalol and 3.1% (NS) in the atenolol period. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced both at rest (p less than 0.01) and during exercise (p less than 0.01) in the two drug treatment periods compared to placebo.", 
    "10": "The influences of verapamil, propranolol and their combination on blood pressure and heart rate during cold pressor testing and isometric exercise were examined in 13 patients with essential hypertension. Verapamil modified the peak pressor responses to each stimulus while the major action of propranolol was on heart rate. Together the drugs attenuated both haemodynamic responses. Combined calcium antagonism and beta-blockade may modify favourably surges in blood pressure and heart rate in ambulant hypertensives.", 
    "11": "17,354 mildly hypertensive adults with diastolic (v) pressures of 90-109 mm Hg took part in a 5 1/2 year trial in which each was randomized to treatment with either bendrofluazide, propranolol, or placebo. The main results of the trial have been published; they showed stroke benefit but no overall reduction in the incidence of coronary events and no effect on all-cause mortality. Further analyses of the data have shown interesting differences between subgroups of the population, with regard to the effects of the two types of treatment on stroke, on coronary events and on ECG changes. These results, and the effects of interaction between cigarette smoking and the efficacy of these drugs, if confirmed in other studies, should influence the choice of drug therapy for mild hypertension.", 
    "12": "During 1972-1973, 785 symptom-free men, aged 40-49, with mild hypertension, were randomly assigned to a 5-year controlled drug treatment study, 406 in the treatment group and 379 in the control group. The basic drug was hydrochlorothiazide, in addition methyldopa or propranolol if necessary. The mean observation time was 66 months (range 60-78). At 5 years' follow-up there was no difference in total mortality between treated and controls, nor in cardiovascular mortality. There was a good prevention of cerebrovascular disease (0 vs. 7). Regarding coronary heart disease, however, there was an opposite trend (20 vs. 13, p greater than 0.10). During the trial, different drug-induced changes were observed in serum lipids, glucose and uric acid. The importance of these changes are still uncertain.", 
    "13": "In a double-blind controlled trial 22 patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension were treated with nicardipine 30 mg t.d.s. and 19 patients with propranolol 80 mg t.d.s. as monotherapy for 24 weeks. Blood pressure in both groups at the end of trial was equally and significantly reduced; systolic pressure 22.2 mmHg and diastolic pressure 15.5 mmHg in the supine position, and 24.4 mmHg and 18.4 mmHg, respectively, in the standing position in those on nicardipine, and by 23.7 and 16.2 mmHg and 28.0 and 19.2 mmHg, respectively, in the propranolol group. There was an initial increase in heart rate in the nicardipine group, but the rise was only moderate (3 beats/min supine p = 0.3219, and 7 beats/min standing, p = 0.0203) at the end of the 24 weeks. In the propranolol group heart rate was reduced markedly. Adverse effects occurred in 77% of patients on nicardipine and in 63% of those on propranolol, and there were no unexpected findings. The effects were mild in both groups and did not lead any patient to stop medication. One patient on propranolol was withdrawn from the trial because of poor blood pressure control and suspected angina pectoris after 5 weeks on active medication. There were no significant changes in blood chemistry, including lipoprotein classes. Overall, in comparison with propranolol, nicardipine was effective, well-tolerated and safe to use in the monotherapy of mild or moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "14": "Thirty patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension entered a randomised double-blind parallel group study for 6 months to compare the effects of the new calcium channel blocker nicardipine 90 mg/day and propranolol 240 mg/day. Both drugs reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures significantly in the supine and in standing positions. After 6 months of treatment, nicardipine had reduced the supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 16 and 17 mm Hg, respectively, and propranolol by 15 and 12 mm Hg. While propranolol treatment led to a marked decline in heart rate, nicardipine caused a small but statistically significant increase in heart rate throughout the study. Both drugs reduced blood pressure during maximal exercise, but propranolol had a greater effect. During exercise nicardipine did not affect the heart rate, whereas propranolol dramatically reduced it. Nicardipine did not produce any ECG changes at rest or during exercise. The side-effects for nicardipine were mild and were related to the vasodilatation induced by the drug. No abnormalities in routine blood chemical tests were found for either of the drugs. Nicardipine appears to be an effective single drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "15": "Hangover following consumption of alcohol includes many disagreeable signs and symptoms that are suggestive of sympathetic overactivity. We performed a randomized, double-blind, crossover controlled study to assess the effect of beta blockade in preventing the symptoms of hangover. Ten subjects were randomized to receive 160 mg of a long-acting preparation of propranolol or a placebo and then participated in a controlled drinking situation. Patients were then evaluated for symptoms and signs of hangover. The results showed that although beta blockade was achieved, there was no clinically important reduction in symptoms of hangover. We conclude that propranolol does not prevent the symptoms of hangover.", 
    "16": "The in vitro and clinical behavior of new controlled-release formulations of propranolol and verapamil are reviewed. In vitro dissolution studies have proved to be of little value in determining the clinical activity of these new dosage forms. There is a difference between the blood levels found with the new formulations and those of the reference products. The once-daily verapamil product was evaluated in black hypertensive patients with promising results and suggests that this dosage form of verapamil may be successful as monotherapy for treating this patient population.", 
    "17": "A sample of 500 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, who had been successfully controlled on once daily timolol/bendrofluazide at the end of a 3-month general practice study, was followed up after approximately 1 year of treatment. Physicians who had participated in the trial were questioned on the current status of these patients. Out of 479 reports received, data showed that 358 (75%) patients were still normotensive 47 weeks after starting treatment with timolol/bendrofluazide and in a further 8 patients other antihypertensive agents had been added to this therapy. Of the 113 patients no longer receiving timolol/bendrofluazide, only 38 (7.9%) had stopped therapy due to adverse effects. It is concluded that the results are a further indication that timolol/bendrofluazide offers an acceptable and balanced long-term form of therapy in hypertension for both the patient and the physician.", 
    "18": "A double-blind prospective randomized trial of atenolol (100 mg once daily) was carried out on 88 patients (78 men) awaiting coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Standardized ratings of both psychiatric morbidity and functional capacity were made before, 3 months (n = 82) and 12 months (n = 81) after surgery. One year after surgery men in the atenolol group had a significantly shorter treadmill exercise time than those on placebo (7.21 +/- 0.28 min vs 8.32 +/- 0.40 min; p less than 0.05), but the frequency of reported anginal attacks during the year was similar in both drug groups. Improvement in functional capacity (measured in exercise time) in the 71 men following surgery was related to both physical and psychological variables assessed before the operation. Men with more severe occlusive disease, lower neuroticism and higher extraversion scores pre-operatively showed greater percentage improvement in exercise time after surgery. Women had significantly levels of psychiatric morbidity and shorter treadmill exercise time than men both before and after surgery. Of the psychiatric and psychological variables, only ratings of Type A behaviour fell significantly in the atenolol group (170.9 +/- 5.3 vs 163.0 +/- 5.2; p less than 0.05). This change, which is probably not clinically important, occurred independently of any reduction in either overall psychiatric morbidity score or ratings of somatic symptoms mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors. The atenolol group reported more side-effects of both psychological and physical symptoms than the placebo group. We do not recommend the routine use of atenolol after bypass graft surgery. Our findings failed to support the suggestion that Type A characteristics may reflect an underlying sympathetic nervous system reactivity.", 
    "19": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether timolol maleate (Timoptic) is cytotoxic to the cornea. The drug was applied as topical drops for 1 month to control rabbit eyes and rabbit eyes from which the epithelium had been removed or to de-epithelialized full-thickness autografts. Clinically all corneas and grafts remained clear. Scanning and transmission electronmicroscopy however revealed is drug induced epithelial damage, defective epithelial wound healing, and endothelial changes. The endothelial changes were most prominent in the group of rabbits that underwent de-epithelialization before corneal grafting.", 
    "20": "Cardioprotective drugs are agents that prevent or moderate harmful consequences of impaired cardiac energetics, such as sudden coronary death (SCD) due to early post-occlusion ventricular fibrillation (EPVF), development of incapacitating myocardial necrosis. Cardioprotection may be due to anti-ischaemic action, correcting the imbalance between vascular supply and myocardial demand for blood, but also to cytoprotective effect, preserving cellular integrity in the presence of factors damaging structure and function of the cardiac cell membrane such as ischaemia, ionic imbalance and that of pH, etc. Neither anti-ischaemic nor cytoprotective effect alone, or in combination, are sufficient to warrant full cardioprotection, i.e. both prevention of SCD and limitation of infarct size. Thus the beta-blocker pindolol which is anti-ischaemic in its effect reducing myocardial O2 demand and protects from SCD and EVFP, failed to limit infarct size. Even interventions of a mainly cytoprotective type of action protecting from SCD and EPVF, such as the linoleic acid-rich diet, or lidocaine, were unable to limit infarct size, 7-oxoPGI2 (anti-ischaemic and cytoprotective) failed to protect from SCD, VF and did not limit infarct size. On the other hand the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which, like salicylates or sulfinpyrazon, reduce myocardial O2 demand and protect from post-occlusion SCD and EPVF, effectively limiting infarct size.", 
    "21": "The effect of metoprolol on the counter-regulation of prolonged hypoglycemia was studied in eight insulin-dependent diabetics. Insulin was given as an i.v. infusion of 2.4 U/h over 180 min alone, or together with metoprolol (3.0 mg i.v. bolus followed by an i.v. infusion of 4.8 mg/h) in random order. Blood glucose, counter-regulatory hormones, hypoglycemic symptoms and the cardiovascular responses were assayed over 240 min. Metoprolol did not significantly modify the blood glucose levels. The plasma levels of free insulin, however, were elevated by approximately 20% (p less than 0.01) by metoprolol during hypoglycemia and the plasma concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine, growth hormone and cortisol were enhanced by the drug. Sweating was increased by metoprolol, while other symptoms were unaltered. We conclude that metoprolol administered acutely does not aggravate prolonged hypoglycemia in diabetics with blunted response of glucagon. Moreover, exaggerated responses of counter-regulatory hormones, provoked by metoprolol, may compensate for the inhibitory effect of this drug on insulin clearance.", 
    "22": "We determined the plasma level of levobunolol in normal volunteers after a single topical instillation of 0.5 or 1% levobunolol in both eyes, and after twice-daily instillations for 1 week. Levobunolol levels were detected within 1 h following acute instillation. During the study, mean plasma levels ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 ng/ml for the 0.5% group and 0.3 to 0.6 ng/ml for the 1% group. The highest individual plasma level was 1.2 ng/ml, which occurred in 1 patient receiving 1% levobunolol. After 1 week of twice-daily instillation mean plasma levels were similar to those observed after acute instillation. Minimal cardiovascular changes were observed in the 0.5% group while decreases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure were observed in the 1% treatment group.", 
    "23": "Nadolol, a nonselective beta-blocker, has been shown to decrease portal pressure in patients with cirrhosis at the same degree as propranolol. No data are available, however, about its effect on rebleeding rate and mortality in patients undergoing prevention of rebleeding from esophageal varices. A prospective randomized clinical trial was performed in patients with cirrhosis who survived a documented episode of variceal hemorrhage. 12 patients received nadolol, 12 placebo. Patients with child's C grade, tense ascites, renal failure, contraindications to beta-blocker, or age greater than 70 were not included. After a follow-up of up to 145 weeks, 9 patients in the nadolol group and 4 in the placebo group survived free from rebleeding (log-rank test: chi 2 = 4.35, p less than 0.05). Survival was not statistically different in the two groups (1 death in the nadolol group, 3 in the placebo group). In conclusion, nadolol appears to represent an effective therapy in the prevention of variceal rebleeding in cirrhotic patients.", 
    "24": "The contribution of the renin-angiotensin system (RA) and of prostaglandins (PG) to the acute depressor effect of captopril (Capt) was studied in 13 hypertensive patients suppressing either RA by propranolol (Prop) or PG by indomethacin (Indo). Four patients showed abolition of the depressor effect of Capt by pretreatment with both Prop and Indo (Group 1). Indo, but not Prop, cancelled the depressor effect in another 4 patients (Group 2). In the remaining 5 patients, either Prop or Indo did not alter the depressor response to Capt (Group 3). Patients in Group 3 were older than patients in Group 1 and 2 and showed lower plasma volume value. Several mechanisms might contribute to the acute depressor effect of Cap, including not only the suppression of RA and the enhancement of PG, but perhaps other undetermined factor(s), especially in older patients.", 
    "25": "L-Timolol (0.4 mg/kg) reduced significantly retinal blood flow (17%), systemic blood pressure (18-20%) and heart rate (28%) in the rabbit. D-Timolol (4.0 mg/kg) increased retinal blood flow slightly (9%) and did not significantly affect systemic blood pressure or heart rate. Since D-timolol is effective in reducing intraocular pressure, these results indicate that D-timolol is superior to L-timolol for glaucoma treatment. Haloperidol and domperidone are dopamine antagonists, but, while haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg) suppressed retinal blood flow (16%), domperidone (0.2 mg/kg) increased it (12%). Neither of them affected blood pressure or heart rate significantly. While either of these given topically decreases intraocular pressure significantly, domperidone's ability to increase retinal blood flow makes it more useful than either haloperidol or L-timolol for treating glaucoma.", 
    "26": "The purpose of this study was to identify the frequency of cardiac dysrhythmias in two similar groups of hypertensive middle-aged males (age 45-66). They had previously been randomized either to a diuretic treatment (n = 42), or a beta-blocking agent (n = 41). A 24-hour ambulatory Holter monitoring, and serum potassium, was obtained in all patients, serum magnesium was measured in 35 patients. The mean number of ventricular premature beats (VPBs) and the frequency of complex arrhythmias (19 vs. 5) was significantly higher in the diuretic group (p less than 0.01). The serum potassium was significantly lower (p less than 0.001) in the diuretic group, and there was a significant (p less than 0.005) inverse correlation between the number of VPBs and the serum potassium in all treated patients. The patients with complex arrhythmias were older (p less than 0.01) than the remainder of the patients. No correlation between serum magnesium and VPBs or complex arrhythmias was found. This study demonstrates increased frequency of VPBs in older hypertensive males, treated with diuretics, and that hypokalaemia predisposes to increased cardiac arrhythmias. We conclude that in older mildly hypertensive men hypokalaemia should be avoided.", 
    "27": "The authors studied the life quality in a group of 74 patients--31 males and 43 females--affected with essential hypertension of World Health Organization I or II degree. All patients began treatment with frusemide at a dose of 25 mg once a day. The 35 non-responsive patients to frusemide were then treated, by random selection, with captopril at a dose of 25 mg twice a day, or nadolol at a dose of 80 mg once a day, for three months. The results show no significant differences on the hypotensive effect with either drug; in view of the incidence of side-effects of the two drugs, treatment with captopril is clearly better tolerated by the patients.", 
    "28": "The effect of d- and d,l-propranolol (10(-5)M) on myocardial relaxation was studied in the isolated cat heart beating at constant rate and perfused at constant coronary flow. Infusion of d,l-propranolol 10(-5)M produced a significant decrease in maximal velocity of contraction (+T) of 48 +/- 1.5%, P less than 0.05, and a proportionally greater decrease in maximal velocity of relaxation (-T) of 58 +/- 2%, with a significant increase in the ratio between both maximal velocities (+T/-T) of 28.4 +/- 6.2% (from 1.35 +/- 0.03 to 1.74 0.09). The time constant of tension decline computed from the time of -T (Tau) was significantly prolonged by 64 +/- 17.5% (from 38 +/- 1.4 to 61 +/- 6 msec) (P less than 0.05). Similar results were obtained with d-propranolol (10(-5)M). A decrease in +T of 52.2 +/- 4.1% elicited by perfusion with low calcium (0.05 mM) also produced a slight increase in +T/-T and Tau by 11 +/- 4.5% and 27 +/- 6% respectively, P less than 0.05). These increases were, however, lower than those produced by both d,l- and d-propranolol (P less than 0.05). The effect of low calcium on +T, +T/-T and Tau were fully reversible, whereas the complete reversal by calcium of the negative inotropic effect of d- and d,l-propranolol did not reverse the significant decrease in -T and increase in +T/-T, and Tau elicited by the drug. Similar results were obtained in catecholamine depleted hearts. d-propranolol (10(-5)M) did not affect the calcium sensitivity of the chemically skinned cat right ventricular trabeculae. The calcium uptake of cat cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum was significantly inhibited by d-propranolol from a concentration of 3 X 10(-4) M. The results suggest that propranolol 10(-5)M has an antirelaxant effect, not mediated by its negative inotropic action and independent of its beta blocking action. This antirelaxant effect might be mediated by the SR calcium uptake inhibition produced by the drug and might be a possible mechanism by which high concentrations of these agents negatively affect myocardial contractility.", 
    "29": "Male Wistar rats were decerebrated at precollicular level, by aspiration, under ether anaesthesia. The experiments employed rats instrumented for chronic electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings or mean blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR) determination. Immediately after surgery, decerebrate (D) and sham operated (SO) animals presented a small and similar increase in their HR. Three and a half hours after surgery, SO group presented a normal HR, whilst D animals continued to show an increase in their HR up to 4.5 h, when it stabilized. Twenty four hours after surgery both groups presented similar MBP (D:110 +/- 6; SO:108 +/- 1 mmHg) but displayed marked differences on their HR (D:550 +/- 11; SO:335 +/- 5 beats/min). The blockade of parasympathetic tonus induced significant increases in the HR of both groups, without major changes in their MBP. Beta-adrenergic blockade reduced HR of both groups, bringing HR of D almost to control level. Simultaneously there was a reduction in MBP of D but not of SO animals. When parasympathetic blockade was superimposed to beta-adrenergic blockade, there was a significant increase in HR of SO, but not of D or in MBP of both groups. Thus we conclude that the decerebrate rat presents normal MBP with simultaneous tachycardia mainly caused by increased sympathetic outflow to the heart.", 
    "30": "The prevalence of hypertension in children is of the order of 1%-3%. Of these children, 10% will have severe hypertension and in the majority the increased blood pressure will be secondary to renal disease. Nephrologically orientated investigation is therefore important. The most helpful investigations are: peripheral plasma-renin activity, 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, main and segmental renal vein renin measurements and renal angiography plus 123I metaiodobenzyl guanidine (MIBG) scan in suspected phaeochromocytoma. Drug treatment of accelerated hypertension is most successfully undertaken by intravenous labetalol or sodium nitroprusside; sustained moderate-to-severe hypertension by a beta-blocker plus a vasodilator or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with or without a diuretic; mild hypertension by diet, diuretic and if necessary by more powerful hypotensives. Surgical treatment by revascularization or nephrectomy and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty can be successful. Utilizing the current range of investigational and therapeutic tools the aetiology and appropriate management of hypertension can be effectively and safely undertaken in the majority of hypertensive children.", 
    "31": "Three 5-HT agonists produced a dose-related fall in open/total arm entry ratio in the elevated X-maze model of anxiety at doses which did not affect total entries. The relative potency, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetra lin (8-OH-DPAT) much greater than 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeODMT) greater than or equal to 5-methoxy-3(tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)1H-indole (RU 24969), was unrelated to the occurrence of wet dog shakes and suggests that 5-HT1 rather than 5-HT2 receptors may be involved. However, the 5-HT2 receptor antagonists ritanserin, ketanserin and seganserin caused an anxiolytic-like increase in entry ratio, although only ritanserin produced this effect across the dose range tested. +/- Pindolol, an antagonist at 5-HT1 receptors, showed a biphasic dose-response curve with a fall in entry ratio at one high dose. The effect of a submaximal dose of 8-OH-DPAT was prevented by pindolol but not by a similarly anxiolytic dose of ritanserin or diazepam. A higher dose of diazepam caused intense muscle hypotonia in combination with 8-OH-DPAT. Since open/total entry ratio appears to represent choice, rather than suppression or delay, of a response, the effects seen may indicate involvement of 5-HT receptors in anxiety separately from any change in the ability to withhold a response. The precise role of each receptor subtype, however, remains to be determined.", 
    "32": "Two groups of rats were exposed to hypoxia (10% O2) for 1 and 3 weeks with or without daily injections of DL-propranolol (0.66 mg.kg-1 ip). The structure of the carotid body was analyzed by light microscopical morphometry and the catecholamine content was assayed by high performance liquid chromatography. Exposure to hypoxia induced enlargement of the carotid body due to enhanced vascularity and hypertrophy of glomic and interstitial tissues. The dopamine and norepinephrine content were increased at both 1 and 3 weeks of hypoxia and reached levels 40-50 times those of the controls. The DL-propranolol treatment abolished the vasodilatory effect of hypoxia within the first week but did not prevent the other structural changes or the rise in catecholamine content. The data suggest that 1. the vasodilation elicited by long-term hypoxia may be controlled by beta-adrenoceptors and 2. the structural and biochemical events occurring in rat carotid body during long-term hypoxia do not influence each other and thus seem to be controlled by different mechanisms.", 
    "33": "A comparative study between prazosin and propranolol with twenty male patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension was used to study the effects of these antihypertensive agents on plasma lipoproteins, and more specifically high density lipoproteins-2 and Apo A-I. After 4 weeks on placebo, the patients were randomly assigned to prazosin therapy (Group A) and other ten patients to propranolol therapy (Group B) for 8 weeks. Doses required for normalization of blood pressure ranged between 1 to 8 mg/day for prazosin and 20 to 240 mg/day for propranolol. The mean blood pressure was lowered to normal by both drugs. The results indicate that prazosin has no adverse effects on plasma lipids and lipoproteins separated by density gradient centrifugation. In contrast, propranolol increased total plasma triglycerides and decreased high density lipoprotein-2 apoprotein A-I and cholesterol levels by 50% in the group of ten patients. Since low levels of high density lipoproteins have been found to be associated with an increased incidence of coronary artery disease, the data obtained suggest that propranolol may induce significant, potentially atherogenic changes on lipid metabolism in hypertensive patients.", 
    "34": "It remains difficult to make a reasoned choice between betablockers and calcium antagonists in the medical treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In order to help in making this choice, we compared the effects of 320 mg of propranolol and 480 mg of verapamil, prescribed in a random order for an average period of 2.5 months in 24 patients. In 15 patients the two therapeutic sequences were preceded and followed by a clinical examination and an exercise stress test after withdrawal of all treatment. The overall functional status correlated to oxygen consumption was unchanged by the two drugs, but patients felt better more often with verapamil. These was no significant change in maximal power developed during exercise testing although verapamil increased it by 9 p. 100 throughout with a corresponding increase in oxygen consumption. Two parameters were significantly changed by both drugs: the maximal heart rate fell from 161 +/- 22 to 122 +/- 18 with propranolol, and to 145 +/- 28 with verapamil; the oxygen pulse (equivalent to the systolic index) increased from 10.9 +/- 2.2 to 14.8 +/- 3.9 with propranolol, and to 13.7 +/- 2.4 with verapamil. There were no changes in the blood pressure profiles during exercise. Side effects were observed with both drugs; muscular weakness was the biggest problem with propranolol and sinus node dysfunction with verapamil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "L-threo-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylserine (L-DOPS), a norepinephrine (NE) precursor, 3 mg/kg, i.v., increased the cerebral blood flow (CBF) in both the striatum and hippocampus as well as the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) in urethane-anesthetized rats, as NE infusion did. The L-DOPS induced increase in CBF was inhibited by benserazide (3 mg/kg/hour), a peripheral aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, and propranolol (3 mg/kg, i.p.), a beta-adrenoceptor blocker as well. These results suggest that the effects of L-DOPS may be attributed to the action of NE formed from L-DOPS, and the action may be mediated by stimulation of beta-adrenoceptor.", 
    "36": "The effect of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2-D3) on the TRH induced TSH release was investigated. Wistar rats were injected with 1,25-(OH)2-D3 (0.05 microgram/kg/day) for three days, and TRH was injected iv on the third day. Blood was drawn every 10 min during the following 40 min, and TSH was determined. The TSH release was significantly higher in rats treated with 1,25-(OH)2-D3 than in controls. The rats treated with 1,25-(OH)2-D3 were hypercalcaemic and thus, in order to find out if the effect was mediated through hypercalcaemia rats treated as above, were infused with EDTA (30 mg/kg/100 min) starting 60 min before the TRH test. This treatment made the rats normocalcaemic, and the significant increase in the TSH release was still seen in the 1,25-(OH)2-D3 treated rats as compared to controls. The results thus indicate that 1,25-(OH)2-D3 enhances the TRH induced TSH release and that the effect is not mediated through an increase in the serum calcium concentration at the time of the TRH test. In order to find out if the effect could be mediated by changes in intracellular calcium the rats were treated with the calcium antagonist verapamil (25 mg/kg/day) and the adrenergic blocker propranolol (5 mg/kg/day) alone or together with 1,25-(OH)2-D3. In rats treated with verapamil or propranolol alone or 1,25-(OH)2-D3 + propranolol, no effect was observed on the TRH induced TSH release. Verapamil + 1,25-(OH)2-D3 significantly increased the TSH release as compared to both controls and rats treated with 1,25-(OH)2-D3 alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "The pulmonary alveolar type II cell synthesizes and secretes phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major component of surfactant, above basal level in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation. The investigation of the specific receptor which mediates these events was the topic of this study. Freshly isolated type II cells from adult rats were disrupted in a French pressure cell, and crude particulate fractions were recovered and used in assays for binding of the radioligand (-)-3-[125I]-iodocyanopindolol. The receptor had high affinity for beta-adrenergic agents, and specific binding to the receptor was saturable and reversible. The KD value obtained by kinetic means (19.6 pM) was in close agreement with that obtained by Scatchard (21.5 pM) and Hill (21.3 pM) analyses of steady-state binding data. The Scatchard correlation coefficients and Hill plot coefficients were close to 1, indicative of a single class of binding sites which displays no cooperativity. The specificity for catecholamine agonists and stereoselectivity observed were appropriate for a beta-adrenergic receptor. Use of selective drugs identified the presence of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes (1:3, respectively) on this cell type.", 
    "38": "The alpha 1 and beta-adrenergic receptor metabolism was studied at cell confluency in BC3H1 and C6 glioma cells. After their irreversible blockade with phenoxybenzamine and a bromoacetyl derivative of pindolol (Br-AAM-pindolol) respectively the receptor reappearance allows to determine a half life of 23 hours for the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor in BC3H1 and a quasi absence of beta-adrenergic receptor metabolism in C6 glioma cells at confluency. In contrast, beta-adrenergic receptor is rapidly synthesized during cell division. This metabolic stability of beta-adrenergic receptor at confluency was also observed in BC3H1 cells using the heavy isotope labeling of the beta-adrenergic receptor (half life of 8 days). This stability was also confirmed by the observation that at confluency in C6 glioma cells, beta adrenergic receptors reappeared at the cell surface after a complete down-regulation. In parallel with the study of the half life of adrenergic receptors, we determined in BC3H1 the half life of the forskolin stimulated catalytic unit of the adenylate cyclase using heavy isotope labeling method. In heavy amino-acid medium the apparent sedimentation coefficients of the adenylate cyclase increased from 7.4 +/- 0.04S (n = 36) to 8.4 +/- 0.03S (n = 13). This increase was due to the synthesis of new heavy molecule since it was blocked by cycloheximide. The analysis of the kinetic of synthesis of heavy molecules allowed to calculate a half life of 36 hours. The comparison between the half life of several regulatory membrane proteins in BC3H1 indicate that each of them has a specific metabolism.", 
    "39": "We have studied the molecular properties of avian beta 1-adrenergic receptor and human beta 2-adrenergic receptor. The turkey erythrocytes beta 1-receptor has been solubilized in active form by digitonin and has been purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography followed by electroelution from polyacrylamide gel. The photoactivable ligand, iodocyanopindololdiazirine, labels specifically a major 45 kDa and minor 55 kDa polypeptide in turkey erythrocytes, whereas in A431, it labels two polypeptides of molecular weights 65 kDa and 55 kDa. Both types of receptors are N- and possibly O-glycosylated but the turkey beta 1 receptor has only complex carbohydrates whereas the human beta 2 receptor has in addition oligo mannosidic polysaccharidic moiety. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were raised against the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Polyclonal antibodies were found to mimic beta-adrenergic agonists by stimulating adenylate cyclase upon binding to the receptors. The monoclonal antibodies precipitated both intact and affinity labeled receptors which they also revealed on immunoblots.", 
    "40": "The beta-adrenergic receptors present in inner and outer layers of human myometrium near term were characterized using the radioiodinated antagonist iodocyanopindolol (ICYP). In both layers ICYP binding is saturable, rapidly reversible, stereoselective, and appears to occur in a single class of sites with a KD of 30 pmol/l. Adrenergic agonists compete for ICYP binding sites with an order of potency consistent with beta 2-adrenergic potencies: isoproterenol greater than epinephrine much greater than norepinephrine. Studies in which CGP 20712 A, a beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, competes for ICYP binding sites in human myometrium reveal that at least 65% of the beta-receptors present are beta 2-subtype, whatever the layer considered. At the 35th week of pregnancy, the density of beta-adrenergic receptors in the inner layer (15.2 fmol/mg of protein) is about 50% higher than in the outer layer. At term, the densities of beta-adrenergic receptors are reduced and exhibit the same values for both layers (5 fmol/mg of protein). These results indicate that the beta-adrenergic receptors in the two layers diminish during pregnancy and reach, at term, an equal and low level of density.", 
    "41": "We investigated whether stimulation of baboon erythrocyte beta-adrenoreceptors affects oxygen transport by haemoglobin. To assess oxygen transport we measured the PO2 at which the haemoglobin was 50% saturated (P50) and the Hill parameter 'n'. Blood at PO2s ranging from 10 to 90 mm Hg was exposed to a 10(-3) M concentration of the agonists l-isoproterenol, l-epinephrine and l-norepinephrine in the presence and absence of 10(-5) M dl-propranolol. None of the adrenergic agents which were used in these experiments produced significant changes in either 'n' or P50 and the concentrations of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and lactate were not altered by the agonists. We conclude from these results that short-term adrenergic stimulation of the baboon erythrocyte beta-adrenoreceptor does not affect factors known to influence oxygen transport, oxygen delivery or haemoglobin itself.", 
    "42": "Active K+ secretion in guinea pig distal colon was studied in vitro in Ussing chambers. Changes in short-circuit current (Isc), transepithelial conductance (Gt), and the unidirectional flux of 42K from serosa to mucosa (JKsm) were determined under a variety of physiological and pharmacological conditions. Mucosal tetraethylammonium (TEA) (10 or 30 mM) increased Isc, while it decreased Gt and JKsm. Seroal bumetanide (10(-4) M) also caused an increase in Isc and decreases in Gt and JKsm. The effects produced by TEA were abolished in the presence of bumetanide. The increase in Isc caused by bumetanide was greatly reduced by mucosal high-K+ conditions. Isoproterenol (10(-6) M), a beta-adrenergic agonist, elicited a decrease in Isc and an increase in Gt. Responses to isoproterenol (10(-6) M) were reduced or abolished by mucosal TEA, serosal bumetanide, serosal ouabain (10(-4) M), and serosal Na+- or Cl(-)-free conditions. Mucosal high K+ also reduced the isoproterenol-induced decrease in Isc. These results suggest that K+ secretion is electrogenic and dependent on the bumetanide-sensitive cotransport in the basolateral membrane. K+ exit across the apical membrane might be conductive and sensitive to TEA. In addition, beta-adrenergic agonists might stimulate K+ secretion.", 
    "43": "New expression vectors were constructed for use in strains of Escherichia coli. Their most important feature is a polylinker system that facilitates the insertion of a gene in an optimal relationship to the highly efficient E. coli atpE translational initiation region (from nucleotide -50 to the start codon). Three ATG-containing restriction endonuclease sites can be used for the insertion of the 5' end of a gene at, or near to, its translational initiation codon. These sites may alternatively be used for the creation of a suitable translational start codon. Transcription is started by the bacteriophage lambda major promoters pR and pL in tandem and terminated by the bacteriophage fd terminator. Transcriptional initiation is very effectively repressed at 28-30 degrees C by the product of the bacteriophage lambda cIts857 gene, which is also present on the vectors. Full induction is achieved by shifting the incubation temperature to 42 degrees C. The combination of highly efficient transcriptional and translational signals on these vectors allowed high-level expression of sequences encoding human interferon beta and interleukin 2 and of the E. coli atpA, sucC and sucD genes.", 
    "44": "The metabolic effects of Enalapril (EN) were compared in a cross over study with those of Propranolol (PPL). Long term treatment with the ACEI did not modify the lipid and glucose profile and increased urate excretion, while PPL increased triglycerides and decreased urate clearance.", 
    "45": "Captopril Research Group of Japan made an evaluation of clinical usefulness of captopril in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension. A relatively low frequency of side effects manifested as clinical symptoms was observed when the daily dose of captopril used was 37.5-112.5 mg. Antihypertensive effect was well maintained in this dose range. Follow-up surveillance of captopril also confirmed this. Abnormalities in blood chemistry were also found to be very less frequent. Untoward metabolic effects of ACE inhibitors such as alteration of serum electrolytes, lipid profiles or glucose metabolism were reported to be minimal or not actually observed. Side effects and untoward metabolic effects may appear more frequently when the same dose was given in patients with renal impairment. ACE inhibitors can be used as the first choice of drugs in the treatment of essential hypertension with no renal function impairment.", 
    "46": "Receptor-binding assays were performed to evaluate the changes of beta- and alpha 1-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors in the nasal mucosa of subjects with nasal allergy and in guinea pigs sensitized with ovalbumin using radioligands 3H-DHA, 3H-prazosin and 3H-QNB, respectively. In subjects with nasal allergy, a decrease in density of beta- and alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and an increase in density of muscarinic cholinergic receptors were observed. An increase in density of muscarinic cholinergic receptors could be reproduced in the nasal mucosa of guinea pigs which were sensitized with ovalbumin and had typical hyperreactive nasal symptoms. These results indicate that the increase in the density of muscarinic receptors observed in the nasal mucosa of subjects with nasal allergy has been induced secondarily by an allergic reaction in the nasal mucosa with hyperreactive nasal symptoms, which in turn acts as an aggravating factor in the vicious circle promoting hyperreactivity of the nasal mucosa.", 
    "47": "Purified cardiac sarcolemma (SL) vesicles are highly suitable to study various Ca2+-transport systems present in the SL. We describe in this paper the separation of the Inside-Out (IO) and Right side-Out (RO) oriented vesicle subpopulations from a purified rat heart SL preparation. The isolated subfractions were characterized with respect to the number of beta-adrenergic binding sites and the Ca2+-uptake and (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase activities. It was found that the Ca2+-uptake and the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase activities reside in the IO fraction and are virtually absent in the RO fraction, confirming that the active Ca2+-uptake represents the outward directed sarcolemmal Ca2+-flux.", 
    "48": "Acute beta-adrenoceptor blockade in rats is known to produce a natriuresis of hitherto uncertain cause. To investigate this phenomenon plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations were measured in groups of conscious metoprolol-treated and control rats. In the active treatment group the blood pressure decreased slowly, as expected, settling at a lower level after 2 hours, and the mean sodium excretion doubled 1 hour after metoprolol administration. This natriuretic effect was maximal after 40-60 minutes and thereafter slowly declined towards basal values. The period of enhanced sodium excretion was associated with a significant rise (68%) of the mean ANP plasma concentration. It suggested that this increase in plasma ANP concentration can mediate the acute natriuretic effect beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "49": "Modulation of forced swimming-induced immobility by beta-adrenoceptor activation was investigated in mice. Isoprenaline prolonged the immobility duration of mice in a dose-related manner when the animals were forced to swim for 6 min periods. On the other hand, salbutamol (a beta 2-agonist) reduced the immobility duration of mice. Pretreatment with propranolol (1,2,4,8 and 16 mg/kg, ip), atenolol (10 mg/kg, ip) and metoprolol (10 mg/kg, ip) antagonized the immobility-enhancing effect of isoprenaline. Chronic administration (10 mg/kg/day) for 8 days of propranolol and imipramine protected the animals from isoprenaline-evoked prolongation of immobility. These findings suggest that central beta 1- and beta 2-subtypes of adrenoceptors may be acting in opposite directions to modify the immobility duration of mice. Activation of central beta 1-adrenoceptors may lead to enhanced behavioural despair, whereas a reverse effect may be observed on beta 2-adrenoceptor activation.", 
    "50": "Microinjections of catecholamines were performed into the lateral ventricle of anesthetized and unanesthetized rats and the blood pressure effects recorded prior to or after the administration of pharmacological antagonists. Injections of 20-100 micrograms normetanephrine (alpha-agonist) produced only pressor responses in both groups of animals. Injections of 10-20 micrograms of norepinephrine (preferentially an alpha-agonist) produced mainly pressor in awake and only depressor responses in anesthetized animals, whereas injections of 10-20 micrograms of epinephrine (preferentially a beta-agonist) produced only depressor responses in both groups of animals. Intracerebroventricular pretreatment with the beta-blocker propranolol (40-100 micrograms) blocked the depressor responses to the catecholamines or even reverted them into clear pressor response. Pretreatment with the alpha-blocker phentolamine (100 micrograms) reduced the pressor effects induced by the intraventricular injection of catecholamines. The existence of central alpha-pressor and beta-depressor mechanisms mediating the blood pressure responses to the intracerebroventricular administration of catecholamines is proposed.", 
    "51": "A 20 h hyperadrenalinemia in rats was produced by subcutaneously implanted A-retard tablets with an output rate of 1.8 micrograms/min/250 g. This caused a moderate (6 h, 20 h) to expressed (12 h) rise in Corticosterone. Concomitant beta-blockade leads to equal (12 h, 20 h) or even more expressed (6 h) enhancement of plasma corticosterone, while A + alpha-blockade lowers those levels significantly against A or A + Prop treated animals. At 6 and 20 h they are even significantly lower than control values. We therefore conclude that enhanced alpha-adrenergic influence increases and beta-adrenergic influence decreases plasma Corticosterone levels in rats.", 
    "52": "Purified sarcolemmal and light vesicle (intracellular) fractions of beta-adrenergic receptors were used to examine the effects of propranolol on receptor translocation in guinea pig heart. Guinea pigs were given propranolol (0.15 mg/kg/hr) via minipumps for 7 days and either killed or made ischemic for 1 hour via a coronary ligature. Propranolol treatment led to an externalization of beta-receptors from light vesicle to sarcolemmal fractions. This externalization increased the number of surface beta-adrenergic receptors that were functional, as assessed by isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. After chronic propranolol treatment, ischemia did not further alter receptor distribution. These results suggest that externalization of beta-adrenergic receptors from a light vesicle fraction to the sarcolemma contributes to up-regulation of beta-receptors that occur in response to both propranolol treatment and ischemia. Because propranolol-treated animals show blunting in externalization after myocardial ischemia, propranolol treatment and myocardial ischemia appear to access the same pool of intracellular beta-adrenergic receptors. Depletion of this pool of receptors along with receptor blockade may thus contribute to the mechanism by which the drug is efficacious in preventing some adverse effects of ischemia.", 
    "53": "Rat C6 glioma cells were cultured for 3-4 days in MEM supplemented with bovine serum. After 10 min incubation of cells with 0.075, 1.0 or 7.5 micrograms ml-1 cis-DDP the basal cAMP levels (7.87 +/- 0.4 pmoles mg-1 protein) were not affected. In the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX, an increase of cAMP occurred; the later was more pronounced in cis-DDP treated cells than in the controls. This suggests that both adenylate cyclase and cAMP-phosphodiesterase were proportionally influenced at this period and that the stimulatory effect of cis-DDP on AC could be demonstrated only when increased activity of PDE had been blocked by IBMX. At later time intervals (10 h-40 h), a 5- to 17-fold elevation of cAMP levels was observed even in the absence of IBMX. Pretreatment of the cells with cis-DDP significantly potentiated cAMP accumulation in response to NE alone and to cis-DDP plus NE could be prevented to a large extent by propranolol; in cis-DDP treated cells the propranolol protection was more effective, both in the absence and the presence of IBMX. The pretreatment of cells with an alpha-blocker, Regitin, did not significantly influence cAMP accumulation. The results indicate that the cis-DDP stimulated cAMP response to NE is mediated via an interaction with beta-adrenergic receptors. The late increase in cAMP content may be a mediator of the morphological changes in these cells following exposure to cis-DDP.", 
    "54": "Two patients with classical signs and symptoms of pheochromocytoma, are described. In these two patients the 24-hr urinary excretion of dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine and their metabolites were normal or low, both in basal states or after attacks (spontaneous or provoked). However, the 24-hr urinary excretion of cyclic AMP was exceedingly high in one patient (13000 nmol/gm creatinine), and elevated in the second (5920 nmol/gm creatinine). Both patients were benefited by treatment with a combination of alpha and beta adrenergic blocking drugs. The first patient, after stopping treatment, developed hypertensive crisis and died. Post-mortem examination did not detect a pheochromocytoma or any other abnormality which could explain the excessively elevated cyclic AMP. In the second patient, extensive X-ray and CT examinations were negative for pheochromocytoma. A hypothesis is developed linking the symptoms and biochemical findings of both patients to an abnormality of the adrenergic receptor.", 
    "55": "Recent studies have shown that beta-adrenergic agents stimulate steroidogenesis and cyclic AMP formation in mouse Leydig cells in culture. To obtain information about the possible presence and the characteristics of a beta-adrenergic receptor in rat testicular interstitial cells, the potent beta-adrenergic antagonist [125I]cyanopindolol (CYP) was used as ligand. Interstitial cells prepared by collagenase dispersion from rat testis were incubated with the ligand for 2 h at room temperature. [125I]cyanopindolol binds to a single class of high affinity sites at an apparent KD value of 15 pM. A number of sites of 6,600 sites/cell is measured when 0.1 microM (-) propranolol is used to determine non-specific binding. The order of potency of a series of agonists competing for [125I]cyanopindolol binding is consistent with the interaction of a beta 2-subtype receptor: zinterol greater than (-) isoproterenol greater than (-) epinephrine = salbutamol much greater than (-) norepinephrine. In addition, it was observed that the potency of a large series of specific beta 1 and beta 2 synthetic compounds for displacing [125I]cyanopindolol in rat interstitial cells is similar to the potency observed for these compounds in a typical beta 2-adrenergic tissue, the rat lung. For example, the potency of zinterol, a specific beta 2-adrenergic agonist, is 10 times higher in interstitial cells and lung than in rat heart, a typical beta 1-adrenergic tissue. Inversely, practolol, a typical beta 1-antagonist, is about 50 times more potent in rat heart than in interstitial cells and lung.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "The application of 6-hydroxydopamine to the cornea by iontophoresis, followed by topical epinephrine, effectively induces herpes simplex virus (HSV) shedding from the external eye of latently infected rabbits. In this study the beta adrenergic blocker, Timolol, reduced virus shedding when applied immediately before the epinephrine, but continued administration resulted in increased viral shedding. While indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor decreased HSV replication in cell culture, it failed to decrease virus shedding when applied topically to the eye in adrenergically stimulated animals. Timolol may act then by its effect on the peripheral cells of the eye rather than by stimulation of virus production in ganglionic neurons. These same animals were subsequently tested for latent infection of the trigeminal and superior cervical ganglia and corneas 14 months after primary infection. Only 2 of 14 animals had virus in the trigeminal ganglia, a finding which suggests that latent virus may be depleted by repeated reactivations. Virus was recovered from corneas of five rabbits by co-cultivation so it is possible that corneal latency occurs in this rabbit model as it does in humans.", 
    "57": "The examination of 27 patients with coronary heart disease and experiments on 42 rabbits showed that intravenous administration of beta-adrenostimulant isoprenaline enhanced the blood level of parathormone and depressed that of calcitonin whereas administration of any beta-adrenoblocker showed contrary results. The patterns of adrenergic system effects on function of the calcium-regulating glands were discussed.", 
    "58": "Peripheral nerve pathways responsible for adrenergic inhibition of mechanical and electrical activities in the chicken rectum and receptors mediating the adrenergic inhibition were investigated in isolated extrinsically-innervated rectum of the chicken. Electrical stimulation of the anal end (Ra) or the ileal cut end (Ri) of Remak's nerve, or perivascular nerves (P) elicited relaxation of the rectum pretreated with atropine (0.5 microM) and hexamethonium (0.3 mM) to block the cholinergic and non-cholinergic, non-adrenergic excitatory innervations. Ri stimulation was much less effective than Ra and P stimulations. The relaxation was shown to be related to cessation of spontaneous spike discharge of the longitudinal muscle which was accompanied by membrane hyperpolarization. The inhibitory effects elicited by Ra and P stimulations, which were prolonged beyond the period of the stimulation, were converted to transient ones by propranolol (3.4 microM). Phentolamine (2.6 microM) reduced effectively the residual effects. In contrast, the effects of Ri stimulation were little affected by these drugs. The present results provide evidence for the existence of two nerve pathways responsible for direct adrenergic inhibitory innervation to the chicken rectum, one running orally in Remak's nerve trunk, leaving it and descending in the branches to the rectum, and the other running as the perivascular nerves along the arterial supplies of the rectum. The direct innervation is mediated predominantly by beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "59": "We have evaluated the relative contributions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems to the increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) elicited by the selective mu-agonist D-Ala2, MePhe4, Gly-ol5 enkephalin (DAGO) following microinjection (100 nl) into the nucleus of tractus solitarius (NTS) of anesthetized, artificially ventilated Sprague-Dawley rats. The effects of anesthesia and central opioid-receptor activation on baroreflex function were also examined. All cardiovascular responses elicited by DAGO were eliminated by complete C1 spinal transection. Pretreatment with the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine attenuated the increase in MAP, but not the tachycardia; the beta-blocker propranolol abolished the tachycardia but not the pressor response to DAGO. Adrenalectomy, vagotomy, or pretreatment with atropine methyl nitrate were all without effect. Baroreflexes were attenuated in animals anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, but were present in urethan-anesthetized rats. DAGO attenuated the increases in MAP and HR elicited following carotid occlusion, but not the bradycardia elicited by a phenylephrine-induced pressor response. These data indicate that mu-receptors in the NTS elicit cardiovascular responses that are mediated by increased sympathetic nerve activity, and accompanied by selective attenuation of baroreflex function.", 
    "60": "We compared the effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists on vascular resistance, gluconeogenesis (GNG), and electrolyte excretion in pyruvate-perfused rat kidneys. Norepinephrine (NE) (15-60 nM) increased vascular resistance (2-19%) and GNG (42-49%) and decreased fractional excretion of Na (18-34%), Cl (38-48%), and K (13-27%). Prazosin and yohimbine blocked the vasoconstrictor but not the antinatriuretic response. Prazosin revealed an antiphosphaturic and inhibited the gluconeogenic response. Propranolol blocked the effect on Na and Cl (66%) and K excretion (100%). Methoxamine (0.6-1 microM) maximally increased GNG (40-52%) with little effect on vascular resistance (+0-9%) and NaCl excretion (-0-11%). Adding glucose to the perfusate increased methoxamine's effects on electrolyte excretion and vascular resistance. Mercaptopicolinate did not alter methoxamine's effects during pyruvate perfusion. Clonidine (0.1 microM) decreased phosphate excretion without vasoconstriction or antinatriuresis; 0.5-1 microM vasoconstricted and decreased NaCl excretion. Isoproterenol (0.1 microM) vasodilated and decreased Na (25%), Cl (40%), and K excretion (20%). Thus alpha 1- and beta-receptors could account for the effect of NE on GNG and K reabsorption, respectively. Synergism of alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta were required for full antinatriuresis. Glucose increased alpha 1-stimulated vasoconstriction and antinatriuresis. Blocking alpha 1-receptors revealed an alpha 2-like antiphosphaturic response.", 
    "61": "To examine the coupling of cardiac cell-surface beta-adrenergic receptors to adenylate cyclase activation and contractile response, we studied this receptor-effector response system in monolayers of spontaneously contracting chick embryo ventricular cells under physiological conditions. The hydrophilic ligand 3H-CGP12177 identified uniformly high-agonist affinity beta-adrenergic receptors (isoproterenol KD = 15 +/- 9 nM). Isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation with 50% effective concentration at (EC50) = 12.1 nM and augmented contractile response with EC50 = 6 nM under identical conditions. One micromolar isoproterenol induced receptor loss from the cell surface with t1/2 = 13.2 min; under identical conditions cAMP content declined with t1/2 = 13.5 min and contractile response with t1/2 = 20.7 min. After agonist removal cAMP response recovered with t1/2 = 15.7 min and receptors with t1/2 = 24.7 min. Sixty minutes after agonist removal there was recovery of 52% of maximal cAMP responsiveness and 82% of the initial number of receptors; receptor occupancy was associated with 78% of initial contractile response. Agonist affinity for cell-surface receptors was changed only modestly by agonist exposure. We conclude that for this system there is relatively close coupling between high-affinity receptors, adenylate cyclase stimulation, and contractile response.", 
    "62": "In vitro incubation of mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) with catecholamines desensitizes beta adrenergic receptors, meaning isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation decreases. This desensitization is accompanied by two patterns of receptor changes: first, reduction of surface receptors (defined as binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol inhibited by 1 microM CGP 12177 [4-3-tertiarybutylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-benzimidazole- 2-on-hydrochloride]) without any change in the total number of [3H] dihydroalprenolol binding sites inhibited by 1 microM propranolol (receptor redistribution); then reduction of the total number of receptors (receptor down-regulation). In the present study we investigated receptor redistribution and down-regulation under physiological conditions by raising endogenous catecholamines in the rat by stress. In young rats a single immobilization stress induced MNL beta adrenergic receptor redistribution: the number of surface receptors was reduced by about 50% but the total number remained the same. Receptor redistribution was prevented completely in rats pretreated with beta-blocking nadolol. Repeated stress down-regulated the MNL beta adrenergic receptors as shown by a reduction in the total number of sites. We also investigated the regulation of beta adrenergic receptors in three age-groups. After 60 min of immobilization stress the number of MNL surface receptors was reduced in young (4-month-old) rats but not in mature (12-month-old) or aged (26-month-old) rats. Using an alternative stress procedure, after single or repeated open-field sessions, we found receptor redistribution and down-regulation, respectively, in young rats. None of these adaptive receptor response was observed in 26-month-old rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Beta-adrenergic receptor number and receptor affinity for isoproterenol were assessed at various in vitro ages of the human diploid fibroblast cell line IMR-90. From population doubling level (PDL) 33 to 44, there was a positive correlation between beta-adrenergic receptor density and PDL (r = 0.709). Beta-adrenergic receptors, assessed by Scatchard analysis of [125I]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding, increased from 15 fmol/mg protein at PDL 33 to 36 fmol/mg protein at PDL 44. In contrast, from PDL 44 to 59, there was a negative correlation between beta-adrenergic receptor density and PDL (r = 0.768). Receptor density declined to 12 fmol/mg protein at PDL 59. When the density of beta-adrenergic receptors was expressed as receptor per cell, the findings were similar. Receptor agonist affinity for isoproterenol was determined from Hill plots of [125I]-ICYP competition with isoproterenol. There was no change in the dissociation constant for isoproterenol with in vitro age. In humans, serum norepinephrine concentrations increase with age. This increase in serum norepinephrine may be partially responsible for the decreased beta-adrenergic receptor-agonist affinity observed with age in human lymphocytes and rat heart and lung. Similar changes in receptor-agonist affinity are observed in rat heart and human lymphocytes following exposure to beta-agonists and are part of the desensitization process. The present findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the decreases in receptor agonist affinity in rat and man with age are secondary to increases in catecholamine concentrations.", 
    "64": "The effects of chlorpromazine (CPZ), desmethylimipramine (DMI) and propranolol (PRO) on phospholipid metabolism in C6 glioma cells were studied by following the incorporation of 32Pi, [U-14C]glycerol, [2-3H]glycerol and [1-14C]oleate into lipids. The drugs produced a dose-dependent increase in the incorporation of 32Pi and [U-14C]glycerol, but not of [1-14C] oleate, into total phospholipids, that reached a plateau at 200 microM CPZ and 500 microM DMI and PRO. The three drugs shifted the incorporation of precursors from neutral [phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)] to acidic phospholipids [phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PIP) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)] in a dose-dependent, qualitatively similar manner. The incorporation of [2-3H]glycerol into diacylglycerol was also depressed markedly by CPZ. Addition of 1 mM 1,2-dioleoylglycerol, 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol or oleate only partially reversed the decrease in PC labeling caused by CPZ. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate counteracted this effect of CPZ completely but greatly increased PC labeling even in the absence of the drug. Polyphosphoinositides rapidly incorporated 32Pi at early times reaching a plateau in about 40 min. The labeling rate of PI was not parallel to that of PIP or PIP2 and continued to increase even after the polyphosphoinositides had reached a plateau. CPZ increased PI labeling much more than that of PIP and PIP2. These data suggest that cationic amphiphilic drugs may act by inhibiting CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, thus decreasing incorporation of precursors into PC and PE; inhibiting PA phosphohydrolase with increased formation of phosphatidyl-CMP, the intermediate for the synthesis of acidic phospholipids; and stimulating the inositol exchange reaction, forming a pool of PI that is not available for PIP and PIP2 synthesis.", 
    "65": "We determined, in monkeys, whether halothane-induced cerebrovascular dilation is mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors and whether cerebrovascular tone progressively returns to baseline values during prolonged halothane anesthesia. Total cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral perfusion pressure, plasma halothane concentration, and arterial blood gas tensions and pH were measured in 14 rhesus monkeys mechanically ventilated with 0.5% (inspired) halothane, 33% O2 and balance N2O. Halothane was increased to 2.0% and the measurements repeated 30 and 60 min later. Then either 0.9% NaCl (controls n = 6) or propranolol (n = 8), 1.0 mg/kg was infused intravenously over 10 min, and the measurements repeated at 70, 90, 120, and 150 min. After 30 min at 2.0% halothane, CBF increased in the controls by 50% (P less than 0.05) from 92 +/- 8 (mean +/- SD) to 137 +/- 39 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1 and in the propranolol group by 30% (P less than 0.05) from 106 +/- 33 to 137 +/- 28 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1. After 2.5 hr of 2.0% halothane anesthesia, CBF remained elevated above baseline levels, but by only 28 and 23% in the control and propranolol groups, respectively. Cerebrovascular resistance was identical in both groups (0.55 +/- 0.33 vs 0.53 +/- 0.13 mm Hg X ml-1 X 100 g 1 X min 1). The results show that there is only a 10-20% return of CBF toward baseline levels after up to 2.5 hr of 2% halothane anesthesia. The results also indicate that halothane-induced cerebrovascular dilation is not mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "66": "After 3 days of symptoms suggesting a viral illness, a 35-year-old man experienced three episodes of aphasia, right-sided sensory symptoms, and bifrontal headache. Each lasted several hours. CSF examination revealed a moderate lymphocytosis consisting of 80% OKT-8+ cells. Serum anti-cytomegalovirus (anti-CMV) antibody titer was elevated at 1:1,024 and subsequently fell to 1:64. Episodic symptoms recurred 5 months later, at which time the anti-CMV titer peaked at 1:8,192. A trial of inhaled oxygen aborted two episodes after several minutes each.", 
    "67": "To determine the role of dietary sodium intake in the reduction in beta-adrenergic sensitivity in hypertension, lymphocyte beta-receptors from 8 borderline hypertensive and 16 normotensive subjects were studied after 5 d on a high sodium diet (400 meq/d) and also following a low sodium diet (10 meq/d). During the high sodium diet, lymphocyte beta-receptor-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, expressed as the relative increase over basal levels stimulated by the beta-agonist isoproterenol, was significantly (P less than 0.025) decreased in hypertensive (24 +/- 5%, mean +/- SE) compared with normotensive (42 +/- 4%) subjects. Neither beta-receptor density nor the proportion of nonsequestered beta-receptors differed between groups. A low sodium diet significantly increased beta-receptor-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in hypertensives (low sodium, 51 +/- 7%; high sodium, 24 +/- 5%, P less than 0.025) to a level not different than that of normotensives (46 +/- 5%). Thus, reduced lymphocyte beta-receptor responsiveness in hypertensive subjects is not due to beta-receptor sequestration and is corrected on a low sodium diet. Dietary sodium may be an important factor in the beta-receptor defect in early hypertension.", 
    "68": "Twenty-eight-day-old (juvenile) rats were kindled with hourly stimulations to partial or fully kindled status. Adult rats were stimulated with hourly or daily stimulations. Alterations in [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding were determined 3 weeks after the last stimulation. We found that partially kindled, hourly stimulated juvenile rats showed a significant increase in the dissociation constant (Kd), with no change in maximal binding values. Fully kindled juvenile rats showed no change in Kd or Bmax. Partially kindled, hourly stimulated adult rats showed a significant decrease in Kd, with no change in Bmax. There was no change in Kd or Bmax values in fully kindled, hourly stimulated adult rats. Fully kindled, daily stimulated adult rats showed a decrease in maximal binding, with no change in Kd values. These findings indicate that kindling-induced beta-adrenergic receptor alterations were influenced by the age of the animal and the kindling parameters used, as well as the extent to which the animals were kindled.", 
    "69": "The dynamic patterns of pituitary-adrenocortical and sympatho-adrenal hormone responses to insulin hypoglycemia as well as the relative importance of central vs. peripheral control of hypoglycemia-induced ACTH secretion were evaluated. In conscious rats bearing indwelling cannulae, the changes in hormone concentrations after insulin injection were dependent on the changes in blood glucose levels with respect to both time course and magnitude. ACTH, corticosterone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine levels were found to be maximal at 60 min after 2.5 IU kg-1 insulin injected ip, whereas earlier (20 min) but smaller increases were obtained in response to 0.5 IU kg-1 insulin injected iv. In rats 6-7 days after lesions of the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH), the rise of ACTH during insulin hypoglycemia was markedly inhibited and corticosterone levels were significantly reduced. Simultaneously, the hypoglycemia-induced increase in plasma epinephrine was unchanged and that in plasma norepinephrine was significantly enhanced in rats with the MBH destroyed. The beta-adrenoreceptor blocker propranolol did not inhibit ACTH and corticosterone responses to hypoglycemia in either sham-operated or MBH-lesioned animals. We conclude that the main factors triggering ACTH release during insulin-induced hypoglycemia are of central rather than peripheral origin. The high concentrations of circulating catecholamines occurring during insulin hypoglycemia are not responsible for pituitary-adrenocortical activation by direct, beta-adrenoreceptor mediated action at the pituitary level.", 
    "70": "Left ventricular biopsies from 38 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HOCM 28, HNCM 10) were investigated to evaluate possible correlations between morphological and clinical parameters. No correlation was found between the degree of myocardial hypertrophy (muscle cell diameter), nuclear size of the myocytes, fibrous tissue content and various clinical data such as pressure gradient, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, Sokolow index and heart volume. In 11 patients with HOCM, a second biopsy was performed after medical therapy (verapamil, n = 9; propranolol, n = 2) over 33 +/- 12 months. Increasing myocardial hypertrophy (cell diameter 16.2 +/- 4.4 mu vs. 20.3 +/- 4.2 mu) was observed in all 11 patients. The interstitial fibrous tissue content increased from 5.7 +/- 6.3 to 12.7 +/- 6.8%. The volume fraction of myofibrils decreased (48.8 +/- 2.7 vs. 43.6 +/- 5.3%). The morphological changes were observed regardless of the clinical outcome which was improved in four, unchanged in five and worsened in two cases. The underlying hypertrophic process in HCM seems to be slowly progressive in most patients and cannot be influenced by medical treatment.", 
    "71": "Weight reduction was compared with metoprolol (200 mg daily) in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of first-line treatment of mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 90-109 mm Hg) in 56 overweight patients aged under 55 years. After 21 weeks of follow-up the weight-reduction group had lost an average of 7.4 kg. The fall in their systolic pressure of 13 mm Hg was significantly greater than that in the placebo group (7 mm Hg) but not different from that in the metoprolol group (10 mm Hg). Their fall in diastolic pressure (10 mm Hg) was greater than that in both the metoprolol (6 mm Hg) and placebo (3 mm Hg) groups. At the end of the follow-up period, 50% of patients in the weight-reduction group had a diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. In the weight-reduction group, left ventricular mass decreased by 18% in comparison with placebo; in the metoprolol group left ventricular mass was unchanged. In the weight-reduction group there was a decrease both in total cholesterol and in the ratio of total to HDL-cholesterol; in the metoprolol group there was a decrease in high density lipoprotein(HDL)-cholesterol and an increase in the ratio of total to HDL-cholesterol. In this study, weight reduction produced significant falls in both blood pressure and left ventricular mass but not the adverse effects on plasma lipids commonly associated with antihypertensive drug therapy.", 
    "72": "The interaction between the receptor antagonist thymoxamine (THYM), propranolol (PPL) and metergoline (MTG) with dexamphetamine (d-Amp)-induced anorexia was examined in a series of studies in normal female volunteers. Visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings of hunger were made and food intake was measured using an automated solid food dispenser (AFD). d-Amp (10 mg) significantly depressed hunger ratings compared to placebo in two of the three studies and its effect was countered by the addition of MTG (4 mg). d-Amp significantly reduced food intake compared to placebo in two studies. In all trials the reduction in food intake following d-Amp was significantly greater than would have been predicted from its effect on hunger. THYM (160 mg) and PPL (40 mg) were associated with no changes in food intake when given alone or with d-Amp, MTG increased food intake (but not significantly) and the combined effects of MTG and d-Amp was the algebraic sum of the effect of each; but there appeared to be no true pharmacological interaction between blocker and anorectic. The results indicated that there may be some dissociation between the effect of d-Amp on hunger and food intake but have failed to produce evidence that noradrenergic pathways are involved. The results are consistent with the theories that d-Amp anorexia does not involve the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) but that 5-HT pathways are involved in the feeding process.", 
    "73": "The sedative or excitatory effects of drugs are difficult to evaluate in patients with depression, where sleep disturbances and tiredness in the daytime belong to the clinical manifestations of the psychiatric disorder. A refined method of vigilance measurement, based on the EEG spectra, together with proper statistical analysis of the data, is helpful for correct interpretation of the data. In two groups of patients with depression, the intensity of sleep disturbances was considered as a background variable in partial correlations, reflecting the relationships between vigilance and drug concentration in a more specific way. It was shown that the sedative effect of maprotiline interferes with the increased vigilance in the patients, with improved night sleep after treatment. As a result, the patients do not experience decreased vigilance although maprotiline has a sedative action. The results obtained in the patients treated with beta-blockers suggest that the drug itself has no sedative effect but the patients suffer from decreased vigilance in the daytime, caused by the sleep disturbances and depression.", 
    "74": "We have used a sensitive direct radioimmunoassay to study the effects of exercise on plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations in man. Plasma ANP concentration increased three-fold in sixteen patients undergoing bicycle ergometer electrocardiographic tests for the investigation of chest pain. Resting ANP concentrations were higher in those patients in whom there was more evidence of heart disease, such as a positive exercise test, treatment with a beta blocker or history of myocardial infarction, although exercise resulted in increased ANP in both groups. We also confirm the increased plasma ANP concentration observed in patients with congestive cardiac failure and renal failure. In nine patients with renal failure routine haemodialysis was accompanied by a 30 per cent reduction in plasma ANP concentration. Plasma ANP concentrations were similar in treated hypertensive patients, untreated borderline hypertensive patients and normotensive subjects.", 
    "75": "The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of propranolol upon the activity of proteases in rat myocardium subjected to aortic stenosis. In acute heart hypertrophy induced by aortic stenosis, the activity of all three proteases in the myocardium does not change significantly. Propranolol in the concentration of 10(-6) to 2 X 10(-4) M inhibited proteolytic activity dependent on neutral proteases. The degree of inhibition increased simultaneously with increasing concentrations of propranolol. Propranolol in a low concentration (10(-6)-10(-5) M) also inhibited proteolytic activity dependent on alkaline and acidic proteases, but in higher concentration (10(-4)-2 X 10(-4) M) stimulated proteolytic activity of these enzymes 2-3 times.", 
    "76": "The hypothermic and motor behavioural responses to 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) have been investigated in the rat. The dose-effect relationship showed that hypothermia appeared at a lower dose than a definite motor syndrome. The hypothermic response to 8-OH-DPAT was attenuated following depletion of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) by repeated intraperitoneal (IP) administration of parachlorophenylalanine (200 mg/kg) or by injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT, 100 micrograms) into the region of the third ventricle; the motor behavioural response produced simultaneously was not. Indeed, after 5,7-DHT, it was increased. Quipazine (1 mg/kg, IP) antagonised the hypothermic response and facilitated the motor behaviour. Clenbuterol (2.5 mg/kg, IP) increased both hypothermic and motor responses. (+/-)-propranolol was without effect on the simple hypermotility produced by 8-OH-DPAT, although it is known to antagonise the hypothermic and stereotyped motor responses. It is concluded that 8-OH-DPAT probably produces its hypothermic effects by actions at 5-HT receptors located presynaptically on 5-HT neurones, while the stereotyped components of the serotonin syndrome appear to be mediated by post-synaptic receptors.", 
    "77": "In a therapy with Hexoprenalin 0.3 microgram/min an additional administration of Celiprolol (3 X 100 micrograms oral) or Placebo did not change significantly the Placenta perfusion. It remains a question, if an additional therapy with beta 1-mimetic agents is necessary, since Hexoprenalin alone did not change the cardiovascular parameters significantly. This results are not transferable to altered dose or to different betamimetic- and beta blocking agents.", 
    "78": "The efficacy of nicorandil, a new anti-anginal agent, was evaluated in 11 patients with rest and effort angina not inhibited by combination therapy with a calcium antagonist and an oral nitrate. Electrocardiographic findings during an attack demonstrated ST depression in seven patients, ST elevation in three, and either elevation or depression in two. Coronary angiography in nine patients revealed significant stenosis (greater than or equal to 75%) in eight. Angina persisted in all 11 patients in spite of treatment with 120 to 360 mg/day of diltiazem or 80 mg/day of nifedipine plus 20 to 160 mg/day of isosorbide dinitrate. Three patients were receiving beta-blocker as well; seven were receiving antiplatelet therapy. During combination therapy, patients had between 3.7 and 25 anginal attacks per week (mean +/- SD, 12.2 +/- 6.9). When nicorandil in a dosage of 20 to 40 mg/day was added to the regimen, the mean number of attacks dropped significantly (P less than 0.01) to 1.4 +/- 1.8 times/week. Two patients did not respond to nicorandil. When placebo was substituted for nicorandil in eight of nine responders, the frequency of attacks increased significantly (P less than 0.05) from 0.6 +/- 0.7 to 6.7 +/- 4.8 times/week. Nicorandil did not affect heart rate or blood pressure. These results suggest that nicorandil inhibits rest and effort angina unresponsive to usual doses of calcium antagonist and oral nitrate.", 
    "79": "The analgesic effect of acute or chronic nortriptyline, amitriptyline and their effects on morphine induced analgesia were evaluated in the rat. Clomipramine and amitriptyline, but not Nortriptyline, induce analgesia, while all potentiate the effect of morphine when administered acutely. The analgesic effect of clomipramine is blunted by both the serotonin antagonist metergoline and the opiate receptor blocker naloxone, thus indicating an involvement of both the serotoninergic and endogenous opioid system. The involvement of the serotoninergic system is confirmed by the similar results obtained with the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan administered alone or together with morphine. A relation between the serotoninergic and the endogenous opioid systems is also shown by the increase in hypothalamic beta-endorphin concentrations elicited by all the drugs used after acute or chronic treatment, with the only exception of nortriptyline, that has been shown to exert its effects mainly through the noradrenergic system. In conclusion, the analgesic effect of clomipramine and amitriptyline and their potentiation of morphine induced analgesia seems to be related to an activation of the endogenous opioid system mediated by serotonin.", 
    "80": "The pharmacodynamics of doxazosin and atenolol were compared on single study days in 39 patients with mild to moderate hypertension receiving long-term double-blind treatment. The pharmacokinetics of doxazosin were investigated in the 20 patients receiving doxazosin. Individually titrated once daily doses of doxazosin were 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 mg and of atenolol 50 or 100 mg. Patients were first investigated after at least one month on constant dose and then again after at least a further three months. Mean plasma concentrations of doxazosin were proportional to dose and the plasma half-life was 11.5 h and independent of dose. There was low variability of doxazosin plasma concentrations between patients receiving the same dose. Concentrations and half-life were unchanged during the period between investigations. Mean reductions of AUC (0-12 h) blood pressure during the 12-h period post-dose and of blood pressure at 24 h post-dose were not statistically different between doxazosin and atenolol. There was effective control of blood pressure by both drugs at all time points of the day. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results obtained in this study are compatible with the use of doxazosin in a once daily dose regimen for the treatment of essential hypertension."
