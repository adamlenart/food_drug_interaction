Histamine was measured by a radioimmunoassay technique. Leukotoxic culture supernatant of P. haemolytica significantly released histamine in a time and concentration-related manner. This effect was lost when culture supernatant was heat-inactivated or preincubated with leukotoxin neutralizing rabbit serum. Preincubation of the mast cells with propranolol or p-bromophenacyl bromide reduced the histamine-releasing effect of leukotoxin, while verapamil enhanced release. Experimental infection of calves with P. haemolytica A1 reduced the total histamine content of pulmonary mast cells recovered at postmortem. Histamine release induced by P. haemolytica leukotoxin is likely an important factor in the pathogenesis of bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis.", 
    "1": "In a prospective randomized study, the effects of the calcium entry blocker nifedipine on shock-wave-induced tubular impairment were studied. 24 patients with renal pelvic or calyceal stones undergoing anesthesia-free extra-corporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) without ancillary measures were randomly assigned to the nifedipine group (n = 12) or the control group (n = 12). Four doses of nifedipine (10 mg t.i.d.) were given orally, starting the night before ESWL. Controls received no medication. To assess renal tubular function, the urinary excretion of alpha 1-microglobulin (A1M), N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG) and Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) were measured before, immediately, 12 and 24 h after ESWL. After lithotripsy, there was a rise in urinary A1M and NAG which was significantly higher in the control than in the nifedipine group. THP, a glycoprotein synthesized by distal tubular cells, fell significantly less in the nifedipine group compared to the controls. Our results indicate that nifedipine exhibits a protective effect on shock-wave-induced tubular damage similar to verapamil. The underlying mechanisms are not clarified yet, direct actions on tubular cells and interference with renal hemodynamics have to be discussed.", 
    "2": "The beta 2-adrenergic agonist formoterol has been shown to inhibit plasma extravasation in the respiratory mucosa associated with neurogenic inflammation as well as that caused by histamine or bradykinin. It is unknown whether these effects of formoterol are mediated through an action of sensory nerves or through a direct effect on the leaky blood vessels. In the present study we sought to determine whether capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves are essential for the anti-edema effect of formoterol in the rat trachea. Substance P (5 micrograms/kg), PAF (hexadecyl-PAF, 5 micrograms/kg), or bradykinin (10 mg/kg) was injected intravenously to increase vascular permeability. The amount of plasma extravasation was measured with two tracers, Evans blue dye and Monastral blue pigment. The effectiveness of formoterol's anti-edema action was assessed in two groups of rats. One was pretreated with capsaicin to eliminate tachykinin-containing sensory nerves and another, the control group, was not pretreated. We found that in control rats formoterol inhibited to a similar extent the extravasation of Evans blue and Monastral blue caused by all three mediators. The highest intravenous dose of formoterol (10 micrograms/kg) reduced substance P-induced extravasation of Monastral blue by 59%, reduced PAF-induced extravasation by 74%, and reduced bradykinin-induced extravasation by 58%. Pretreatment of rats with a dose of capsaicin that eliminated at least 94% of the substance P-immunoreactive nerve fibers did not significantly reduce the effectiveness of formoterol against any of the mediators.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "The effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) pretreatment with the noradrenergic neurotoxin DSP-4 and beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists on the expression of morphine withdrawal signs were investigated in mice. Mice were chronically treated with morphine (8-45 mg/kg, s.c.). Several withdrawal signs were observed following naloxone challenge in morphine-dependent mice which had been pretreated with vehicle. Treatment with DSP-4 before the naloxone challenge suppressed the expression of morphine withdrawal signs, including jumping and \"wet dog\" shakes. Similarly, pretreatment with the beta 1-antagonist atenolol significantly reduced the incidence of naloxone-precipitated jumping and \"wet dog\" shakes. However, pretreatment with the beta 2-antagonist ICI118,551 suppressed the expression of \"wet dog\" shakes, but not that of jumping. These findings suggest that the central noradrenergic system may mediate the expression of withdrawal signs. The blocking effects of beta-antagonists indicate that naloxone-precipitated jumping may be mediated predominantly by beta 1-adrenoceptors, while naloxone-precipitated \"wet dog\" shakes may be mediated by both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "4": "Antiarrhythmic therapy of ventricular tachycardia is associated with decreased efficacy and increased proarrhythmia in patients with congestive heart failure, but the explanation for these observations is not known. This study examined the interaction of ventricular dilatation and d-sotalol in a model of reentry ventricular tachycardia.", 
    "5": "Thin epicardial layers of anisotropic myocardium were created in Langendorff-perfused rabbit left ventricles by a cryo procedure. A fluid-filled, latex balloon was secured within the left ventricle to change ventricular volume. Sustained reentrant ventricular tachycardia, around a central cryolesion, was induced by rapid pacing in all preparations (n = 7). Epicardial mapping was performed through 248 electrodes. Single premature beats introduced within the reentry circuit were used to define the excitable gap. Dilatation did not influence ventricular tachycardia cycle length or conduction velocity. A 1.25-mL increase in left ventricular volume widened the excitable gap by 12% (range, 5% to 29%) (P < .001) because of a decrease in myocardial refractoriness. d-Sotalol (final concentration, 10 mg/L) narrowed the excitable gap 18% (range, 7% to 29%) (P = .002) in the undilated left ventricle. d-Sotalol was less effective in the dilated left ventricle, narrowing the excitable gap only 9%, a difference that was not statistically significant. During pacing to induce or terminate tachycardia, tachycardia acceleration was observed significantly more frequently in the dilated than in the undilated ventricle. Ventricular tachycardia acceleration was due to the development of double-wave reentry (two successive waves traveling in the same circuit in the same direction). d-Sotalol, which narrowed the excitable gap, prevented tachycardia acceleration and double-wave reentry.", 
    "6": "Antiarrhythmic efficacy may be decreased by dilatation because of widening of the initial excitable gap and a decrease in the gap-narrowing effect of these agents. Double-wave reentry, more likely with a widening of excitable gap, may partially explain tachycardia acceleration in the dilated ventricle.", 
    "7": "The developmental pattern and laminar distribution of beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor subtypes were studied in cat visual cortex with autoradiography using [125I]iodocyanopindolol as a ligand and also with immunocytochemistry using a monoclonal antibody directed against beta adrenergic receptors. In the primary visual cortex of adult cats, the laminar distributions of both beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptors revealed by autoradiography were very similar, with concentrations in layers I, II, III and VI. In young kittens (postnatal days 1 and 10), fewer beta adrenergic receptors were present, and they were concentrated in the deep cortical layers (V-VI) and subcortical white matter. Between postnatal days 15 and 40, beta adrenergic receptors increased in density more quickly in the superficial layers than they did in the deep and middle cortical layers. By postnatal day 40, the adult pattern was achieved, with two bands of intense binding in the superficial and deep cortical layers and a lower density in layer IV. Immunocytochemical techniques applied to adult cat cortex showed that beta adrenergic receptor-like immunoreactivity was found in different populations of neurons and glial cells. The immunoreactive neural cells were most dense in layers II, III and VI. About 50% of these immunoreactive neural cells were glial cells, primarily astrocytes. Immunoreactive pyramidal cells were mostly located in layers III and V. In layer IV, many stellate cells were stained. Immunoreactive astrocytes in the subplate and white matter progressively increased in number during development until adulthood. The pattern of laminar distribution and the developmental process was not affected by interrupting noradrenergic innervation from locus coeruleus either before or after the critical period. However, when visual input was interrupted by lesions of the lateral geniculate nucleus in young kittens (postnatal day 10), the density of both beta adrenergic receptor subtypes decreased significantly in the deep cortical layers. Lateral geniculate nucleus lesions in adult cats resulted in a pronounced decrease in beta adrenergic receptor density in layer IV.", 
    "8": "In January 1993 the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure published its fifth report (JNC V). The report highlighted the importance of systolic hypertension and recommended that hypertension should be diagnosed--regardless of age--when systolic blood pressure readings are consistently > or = 140 mm Hg. JNC V reflected the opinion in JNC IV that several drug classes--including diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and alpha blockers--are suitable for initiating antihypertensive therapy. However, JNC V gave preference to diuretics and beta blockers because these drug classes have been shown to reduce the incidence of stroke and cardiovascular events in clinical trials; similar studies with the newer drug classes have not yet been completed. This recommendation is highly controversial because the benefits of diuretic and beta-blocker use are most evident in the elderly, and the beneficial effects of these drugs on the incidence of coronary events are relatively modest. Further, growing experience with ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists shows that these agents lack the metabolic disadvantages of older agents and can exhibit antiatherosclerotic and antihypertrophic vasoactivity. Although to date the clinical benefits of the newer agents have been documented in conditions other than hypertension, the data are persuasive and indicate a probability that these drugs will improve prognosis in hypertensive patients. JNC V also emphasized lifestyle modifications; however, even when they decrease blood pressure, dietary and other nonpharmacologic strategies have not been shown to lower the incidence of clinical events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "The highest prevalence of hypertension is now recognized to exist in the elderly segment of the population. With the completion of several large-scale studies, several of our assumptions regarding elderly hypertensive patients have changed. It is now clear that the elderly have shown the greatest benefit from antihypertensive therapy. This favorable risk-benefit ratio extends to even the very elderly; treatment for hypertension is appropriate for healthy elderly individuals, regardless of age. It also extends to elderly individuals who have already experienced the consequences of elevated blood pressure. Attitudes toward antihypertensive agents have also evolved. Diuretics are appropriate monotherapy in many patients, when the dose is kept low. The usefulness of calcium antagonists has been confirmed, whereas beta blocker use appears to be indicated only in certain subgroups. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have also been shown to be effective in elderly patients, despite earlier studies whose results describe low plasma renin activity in the elderly.", 
    "10": "We have previously demonstrated PLD activation via c-kit receptor activation in rat peritoneal mast cells (Koike et al. 1993, J. Immunol. 151,359-366). In this study, the mechanism of arachidonic acid (AA) release in stem cell factor (SCF) stimulation was investigated. Genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was found to inhibit the AA release in SCF-stimulated cells, whereas pretreatment with vanadate, a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, enhanced the AA release. Propranolol, an inhibitor of phosphatidate (PA) phosphohydrolase, repressed both AA liberation and 1,2-diacylglycerol (1,2-DG) formation. Short pretreatment with phorbol myristate acetate blunted the SCF-induced AA liberation. These results indicate that 1,2-DG generated via the phospholipase D pathway activated by tyrosine phosphorylation is a principle source for AA released in response to SCF in mast cells.", 
    "11": "A bipolar DDD pacemaker system was implanted in a 51-year-old woman with a 2 degrees (Mobitz type) atrioventricular block. The first postimplantation control was unremarkable, but she collapsed 9 weeks later with dyspnoea, tachycardia and profound perspiration. Ventricular flutter occurred twice during routine ambulatory pacemaker function tests one week later. The first episode was terminated by a precordial blow with a fist, but the second required electrical defibrillation. During the subsequent hospitalization abnormal electrolyte balance and digitalis intoxication were excluded. Left-heart catheterization with coronary angiography showed normal left-ventricular function at rest and normal coronary arteries. There was no evidence for an arrhythmogenic right ventricle. Electrophysiological testing with programmed ventricular stimulation provoked ventricular tachycardia with torsade de pointes and transition to ventricular fibrillation. Antiarrhythmic treatment with sotalol, 160 mg twice daily by mouth, failed to suppress the episodes of torsade de pointes. But further programmed ventricular stimulation was uneventful after the sotalol dosage had been increased to 160 mg three times daily.", 
    "12": "A simple and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method using chiral derivatization was developed to screen and determine the enantiomers of moprolol and their metabolites in human urine. The recovery of (+)- and (-)-moprolol from urine was 70.8-81.1% at different concentrations. The coefficients of variation (C.V.) were less than 3.2 and 6.5% for intra- and inter-assays, respectively. Moprolol could be detected in urine up to 24 h after oral administration of a 50-mg dose of moprolol. Unconjugated and conjugated enantiomers of moprolol and their metabolites were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). A gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) confirmatory method was established to identify the metabolites of moprolol. The double derivation procedure for moprolol and their metabolites with S-(-)-methyl chloroformate [(-)-MCF] and N-methyl(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) gave very good GC-MS properties of the derivatized compounds and provided reliable structural information for their confirmation analysis. This is the first published report on the use of a GC-MS method for the detection of the enantiomers of moprolol and their metabolites in human urine.", 
    "13": "[3H] gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) release was studied in rat brain slices in the absence or presence of cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8). [3H]GABA release under the conditions used was Ca(2+)-dependent and insensitive to the presence of the glial uptake blocker beta-alanine. While the basal release of [3H]GABA was not affected by CCK-8, the K(+)-stimulated release of [3H]GABA was significantly enhanced by 300 nM of CCK-8 in the caudate putamen, the substantia nigra, the hippocampal formation and the parietofrontal cortex. In the cerebral cortex the CCK-8 enhancement of [3H]GABA release was concentration-dependent and abolished by the CCKB receptor antagonists PD135,158 (1.0 nM) and L-365,260 (100 nM). A significant counteraction of the CCK-8 action was also found with the CCKA receptor antagonist L-364,718 (100 nM) but only in concentrations at which both CCKA and CCKB receptors are blocked. No CCK-8 effects on [3H]GABA release were observed when tetrodotoxin was superfused 5 min before the K(+)-induced [3H]GABA release. It is suggested that the enhancing actions of CCK-8 on K(+)-stimulated [3H]GABA release is mainly related to an activation of CCKB receptors.", 
    "14": "The relevance of the GABAergic system for the antihypertensive action of metoprolol in spontaneously hypertensive rats was studied by comparing the effect of metoprolol with the effect of dihydralazine. Chronic oral treatment with metoprolol produced the maximum effect after 49 days (-delta 34 mm Hg). This effect persisted on the same level for up to 55 days. The measurements of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis and specific [3H]GABA binding were performed in the hypothalamus, the pons-medulla, the hippocampus and the striatum. Significant stimulation of GABA synthesis and turnover appeared in the hypothalamus and the pons medulla. In contrast, chronic administration of dihydralazine had no influence on GABA synthesis rate. It was also shown that metoprolol elevated significantly (P < 0.01) specific [3H]GABA binding in the hypothalamus and the pons-medulla. In the striatum this effect of metoprolol was less pronounced. Binding constant analysis revealed changes in both the receptor density and affinity. Our results suggest that the hypotensive response to chronic treatment with metoprolol might be attributed to an enhancement of GABAergic system activity.", 
    "15": "This article discusses therapy with beta blockade and thrombolytic agents in acute myocardial infarction. In large and well-controlled studies both treatment strategies have been shown to increase survival. Both therapies have also been demonstrated to be safe in acute myocardial infarction. Historically, the 2 different treatment strategies have been tested during different time periods, resulting in few studies with the main objective to study the combined effects of the 2 agents. From the data that are presently available, however, there is a clear suggestion of additive beneficial effect and the 2 treatments given in combination are well tolerated.", 
    "16": "Indirect serotonergic agonists, whether promoters of 5-HT release such as fenfluramine (5 mg kg-1) or inhibitors of 5-HT uptake such as fluoxetine (10 mg kg-1), elicited in rats penile erections at a modest but significant level. Their effects were markedly potentiated by the beta-blocker tertatolol, (0.6-5 mg kg-1) which displays 5-HT1A receptor blocking activity, but not by the beta-blocker labetalol (6.25 and 25 mg kg-1), which lacks such activity. In addition, tertatolol, but not labetalol, potentiated penile erections induced by meta-chloro-phenylpiperazine (1 mg kg-1). Thus, it appears that increasing serotonergic transmission increases only moderately penile erections because of the functional opposition exerted by 5-HT1A (inhibition) and 5-HT1C (activation) serotonin receptors on this response.", 
    "17": "Several small studies have suggested beneficial effects of long-term beta-blocker treatment in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Our large multicentre study aimed to find out whether metoprolol improves overall survival and morbidity in this disorder. 383 subjects with heart failure from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction < 0.40) were randomly assigned placebo or metoprolol. 94% were in New York Heart Association functional classes II and III, and 80% were receiving background treatment. A test dose of metoprolol (5 mg twice daily) was given for 2-7 days; those tolerating this dose (96%) entered randomisation. Study medication was increased slowly from 10 mg to 100-150 mg daily. There were 34% (95% CI -6 to 62%, p = 0.058) fewer primary endpoints in the metoprolol than the placebo group; 2 and 19 patients, respectively, deteriorated to the point of needing transplantation and 23 and 19 died. The change in ejection fraction from baseline to 12 months was significantly greater with metoprolol than with placebo (0.13 vs 0.06, p < 0.0001). Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased more from baseline to 12 months with metoprolol than with placebo (5 vs 2 mm Hg, p = 0.06). Exercise time at 12 months was significantly greater (p = 0.046) in metoprolol-treated than in placebo-treated patients. In patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, treatment with metoprolol prevented clinical deterioration, improved symptoms and cardiac function, and was well tolerated.", 
    "18": "The effects of clonidine on Na+ pumping in motoneurons of the isolated frog spinal cord was investigated using sucrose gap recordings from ventral roots. Na+ pump activity, induced in motoneurons either by tetanizing the dorsal root or by rapidly exposing the cord to normal medium following 30 min in K(+)-free Ringer's solution (K(+)-activated hyperpolarizations), was increased by application of clonidine (100 microM). These actions of clonidine were blocked by the preferential alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine, but not by alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin or the beta-blocker propranolol. Clonidine's effects on Na+ pumping appeared to be indirect (presumably via interneurons) because its effects on K(+)-activated hyperpolarizations were reduced by tetrodotoxin (TTX) or high concentrations of Mg2+. This indirect mechanism involved activation of non-NMDA excitatory amino acid receptors. Thus, in the presence of clonidine, CNQX, but not APH, limited the ability of clonidine to enhance K(+)-activated hyperpolarizations. The AMPA receptor may play a role in the process, K(+)-activated hyperpolarizations were augmented by the presence of AMPA; NMDA had no effect. The present results are consistent with the idea that activation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors produces the following: the release of excitatory amino acids from interneurons; the activation of non-NMDA receptors on motoneurons; increased Na+ influx and loading and increased Na+ pump activity.", 
    "19": "The solution structure of a peptide toxin isolated from funnel web spider venom, omega-Aga-IVB, was determined by 2D NMR methods. omega-Aga-IVB is a high-affinity specific blocker of P-type voltage-dependent calcium channels. Nearly all of the proton resonances of this 48-residue protein were assigned using conventional 2D homonuclear NMR experiments. The three-dimensional structure of the molecule was determined by simulated annealing. The distance and dihedral restraints used in the structure calculations were derived from NOESY and COSY-type experiments, respectively. Mass spectrometric analysis of omega-Aga-IVB suggests that the protein contains four disulfide bonds. In the absence of chemical data to identify the pattern of cysteine pairing, the disulfide bonds of the toxin are proposed from the NMR data and subsequent structural calculations. The structure of the toxin can be described as a three-stranded anti-parallel beta sheet connected by flexible loops. A striking feature of the structure is that the C-terminal 10 residues of this protein adopt random coil conformations. Several positively charged amino acid side chains are found localized on one face of the molecule, in close proximity to the C-terminal tail. This observation has led us to propose a speculative model of the toxins blockade mechanism.", 
    "20": "Cigarette smoke passed through the nasal cavity of atenolol pre-treated anesthetized spontaneously breathing rabbits caused a bradycardia which was significantly modified by intracisternal application of the 5-HT1A receptor ligands 8-OH-DPAT (50 micrograms.kg-1) and buspirone (200 micrograms.kg-1). 8-OH-DPAT attenuated while buspirone potentiated the bradycardia. These results support the view that 5-HT1A receptors play an important role in modulating the excitability of cardiac vagal motoneurones.", 
    "21": "A study was made of the effect of organic modifiers (acetone, acetonitrile, ethanol, ethylene glycol, methanol and 2-propanol) in phosphate buffer (0.08 M) containing 15 mM cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as surfactant on the elution and separation of eleven common beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The amount of the modifier was varied from 0.1 to 10.0% (v/v). At maximum addition, the organic solvents increased the viscosity of the buffer solution as follows: acetone 16%, acetonitrile 9%, ethanol 26%, ethylene glycol 27%, methanol 20% and 2-propanol 29%. In contrast to the migration time of the other beta-blockers, that of labetalol was not increased by the addition of organic solvent to the buffer solution. Rather, labetalol eluted more quickly with increase in the amount of modifier, and thereby effected changes in the elution order of the beta-blockers. The addition of modifiers also affected the resolution, and the best resolution values were achieved with the following amounts of organic solvent in MEKC buffer: acetone 0.1%, acetonitrile 0.1-0.5%, ethanol 5.0-7.5%, ethylene glycol 1.0-2.5%, methanol 5.0% and 2-propanol 1.0-2.5% (v/v). No significant relationship was found between the elution order and separation and the structure of the beta-blockers in micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography with an organic modifier in buffer solutions.", 
    "22": "1 We have utilised a non-imaging echo-Doppler cardiac output device, using the principle of attenuated compensation volume flow (ACVF), to assess the cardiovascular effects of amlodipine and atenolol over 3 months in 24 patients with essential hypertension. 2 Both amlodipine and atenolol, at 4 and 12 weeks, similarly reduced mean arterial pressure (12 weeks amlodipine -12.6 mmHg, atenolol -14.9 mmHg; P < 0.01 for each vs baseline). 3 The heart rate fell on atenolol, both at 4 weeks (amlodipine -3 vs atenolol -12 beats min(-1); P < 0.05) and 12 weeks (-1 vs -11 beats min(-1); P < 0.05), without change on amlodipine. 4 Stroke volume initially rose on atenolol without change on amlodipine (4 weeks amlodipine -1.3 ml vs atenolol +10.1 ml; P = 0.05) but between drug effects were not different at 12 weeks. 5 The systemic vascular resistance was reduced on amlodipine (12 weeks: amlodipine -176 dyn s cm(-5): P < 0.05) without change on atenolol (atenolol -48 dyn s cm(-5): NS). 6 The cardiac stroke work was lowered on amlodipine both at 4 weeks (P < 0.01) and 12 weeks (P < 0.05) and statistically different from the unaltered atenolol values at both time points. 7 Skin nutrient flow or fingertip temperature was not altered by either treatment. 8 These results are consistent with contrasting mechanisms of action--vasodilator for amlodipine and decreased cardiac pumping for atenolol. The greater reduction in cardiac stroke work on amlodipine compared with atenolol warrants further investigation during longer-term studies.", 
    "23": "1 The metabolism of metoprolol depends in part on the genetically determined activity of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme. In vitro studies have shown that nicardipine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. Since the combination of metoprolol and nicardipine is likely to be used for the treatment of hypertension, we examined the interaction between these two drugs at steady-state. 2 Fourteen healthy volunteers, seven extensive and seven poor metabolisers of dextromethorphan were studied in a double-blind, randomised cross-over four-period protocol. Subjects received nicardipine 50 mg every 12 h, metoprolol 100 mg every 12 h, a combination of both drugs and placebo during 5.5 days. Steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine and metoprolol were analyzed. Beta-adrenoceptor blockade was assessed as the reduction of exercise-induced tachycardia. 3 During treatment with metoprolol, alone or in combination with nicardipine, its steady-state plasma concentrations were higher in subjects of the poor metaboliser phenotype than in extensive metabolisers. Beta-adrenoceptor blockade was also more pronounced in poor metabolisers than in extensive metabolisers of dextromethorphan during treatment with metoprolol alone or in combination with nicardipine (24.0 +/- 2.4% vs 17.1 +/- 3.5% and 24.1 +/- 2.5% vs 15.4 +/- 2.7% reduction in exercise trachycardia, respectively, P < 0.01 in each case). 4 Nicardipine produced a small increase in plasma metoprolol concentration in extensive metabolisers from 35.9 +/- 16.6 to 45.8 +/- 15.4 ng ml(-1) (P < 0.02), but had no significant effect in poor metabolisers. However, nicardipine did not alter the R/S metoprolol ratio in plasma 3 h after dosing, the plasma concentration of S-(-)-metoprolol 3 h after dosing or the beta-adrenoceptor blockade produced by metoprolol in subjects of both phenotypes. The partial metabolic clearance of metoprolol to alpha-hydroxy-metoprolol was not altered significantly in extensive metabolisers. Plasma nicardipine concentration and beta-adrenoceptor blocking effects did not differ between the phenotypes and were not influenced by metoprolol. We conclude that beta-adrenoceptor blockade during repeated dosing with metoprolol is more pronounced in poor than in extensive metaboliser subjects, that nicardipine decreases a CYP2D6-independent route of metoprolol elimination but does not increase beta-adrenoceptor blockade during repeated dosing with metoprolol.", 
    "24": "Separate groups of rats were trained to discriminate either 0.1mg/kg (low dose; L) or 2.5mg/kg (high dose; H) of 8-OH-DPAT from saline, in a standard operant task. Both cues were found to be dose, time and route dependent and generalized completely to the 5-HT(1A) agonists ipsapirone and flesinoxan. Buspirone substituted completely for 8-OH-DPAT in L and partially in H, whereas the 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor agonist eltoprazine substituted completely for 8-OH-DPAT in H but only partially in L. The 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor agonist RU24969, the 5-HT(1B/2C/1A) receptor agonist TFMPP and the 5-HT reuptake blocker fluvoxamine did not completely mimic the effect of 8-OH-DPAT in either L or H and the 5-HT(1A) mixed agonists/antagonists BMY 7378 and NAN-190 produced partial generalization in L, but no generalization in H. In antagonism tests, NAN-190 and BMY 7378 only partially blocked the 8-OH-DPAT cue in both groups. The non-selective 5-HT receptor antagonist methysergide did not completely block the 8-OH-DPAT cue in in L or H. However, in generalization studies, it completely mimicked the 8-OH-DPAT cue in L and produced partial generalization in H. The beta-adrenergic/5-HT(1A/1B) receptor antagonist pindolol completely blocked the 8-OH-DPAT cue in L and H and did not mimic the 8-OH-DPAT cue in either condition. The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor blocker yohimbine substituted fully for the 8-OH-DPAT cue in L and partially in H. Idazoxan did not substitute for the cue of 8-OH-DPAT in H, but produced nearly 80% generalization in L. The dopamine receptor antagonist pimozide neither blocked nor mimicked the cue of 8-OH-DPAT in either group. A number of other drugs (i.e. m-CPP, S(-)-propranolol, DOI, ketanserin, clonidine and apomorphine) were only tested in H. S(-)-Propranolol blocked the 8-OH-DPAT cue but the other compounds produced neither stimulus generalization nor antagonism. The present study demonstrates that the cues produced by the low and the high training dose of 8-OH-DPAT are quantitatively different and mediated by the agonistic activity of 8-OH-DPAT at 5-HT(1A) receptors. Although the results suggest that the 8-OH-DPAT cue (both L and H) is mediated via postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors, the involvement of presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors cannot yet be ruled out.", 
    "25": "We studied 16 mild to moderate essential hypertensive patients (14 male, 2 female; mean age 45 years, range 34-55 years) in order to investigate the effects of an ACE inhibitor, cilazapril (5 mg o.d.) and a selective beta-blocker, atenolol (100 mg o.d.) on the hemodynamics of the brachial and carotid arteries after an isometric stress test with a handgrip. Both drugs caused a statistically significant decrease in blood pressure after three months' treatment, but only cilazapril reduced it after the first dose. Heart rate was reduced only by atenolol (61 +/- 3 vs 71 +/- 3 bpm; p < 0.01). Changes in forearm compliance and characteristic impedance showed a difference statistically significant both for acute test and after three months of treatment. The increase in blood pressure during handgrip did not differ appreciably between the two treatment groups. On the contrary, after handgrip only cilazapril caused a significant increase of the reactive hyperemia.", 
    "26": "The effect of a beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent on defensive aggression in mice was evaluated. Acute doses of d,l-propranolol (0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4, and 12.8 mg/kg) were administered to male Rockland-Swiss mice prior to testing in a target-biting paradigm. Baseline conditions established a high target-biting rate low biting rate during a 15-s tone stimulus preceding the next shock. Every dose of propranolol increased target-biting rates above baseline during each interval with one exception: 0.4 mg/kg decreased the biting rate immediately after delivery of the tail shock. The overall increase in aggression observed following dosing with propranolol was not expected from a review of the clinical literature. These results are discussed in reference to propranolol's known effects on the brain serotoninergic systems and the use of an animal model of defensive aggression.", 
    "27": "In view of conflicting results reported for 5-HT1A receptor involvement in murine social conflict, this study examined the effect of two compounds, SDZ 216-525 and (-)-pindolol, on agonistic and social behavior in male mice. In a resident-intruder paradigm, (-)-pindolol (1.0-20.0 mg/kg), a beta-adrenergic 5-HT1A/1B antagonist, significantly attenuated all agonistic behaviors across the dose range employed. Social behaviors showed significant decreases, while nonsocial cage exploration showed significant increases at all doses. Defensive evade was significantly attenuated at 20.0 mg/kg. SDZ 216-525 (0.025-1.0 mg/kg), a selective 5-HT1A antagonist, significantly attenuated offensive posturing and bite-attacks at 1.0 mg/kg, and all offensive behaviors nonsignificantly at the smaller doses tested. Rearing was significantly attenuated at 1.0 mg/kg, while cage exploration increased at this dose. Defensive and social behaviors remained largely unchanged. These results show that both compounds tested produced significant reductions in offensive behavior, with concomitant changes in defensive, social, and nonsocial behaviors. Results are discussed in relation to SDZ 216-525 and (-)-pindolol potential for the control of anxiety and agonistic behavior.", 
    "28": "The nonlinear percutaneous permeation kinetics of timolol were studied in vitro with human cadaver skin. In the sorption isotherm (equilibrium) study, the plots of the amount of timolol per unit area of epidermis versus aqueous timolol concentration in equilibrium were curvilinear as the dual sorption model predicts. In the penetration study, several aqueous timolol concentrations were maintained in the donor cell for 25 h. The lag-time was prolonged as the timolol concentration in the donor cell was decreased. The change in the lag time was analyzed by a newly proposed method with the lag-time prolongation factor that is calculated from the parameter values obtained in the sorption isotherm study. The ratio of the lag-time to lag-time prolongation factor was of the same magnitude, indicating that the dual sorption model explains the nonlinear percutaneous permeation kinetics of timolol. Finally, the diffusion parameter for the mobile solute was estimated by fitting the data of the cumulative amount excreted into receptor cell versus time to the numerical solution of the dual sorption model. The observed data were roughly compatible with the values predicted by the dual sorption model.", 
    "29": "1. The effects of the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor selective antagonists, CGP 20712A and ICI 118551 respectively, on responses to isoprenaline-induced relaxation of rat distal colon were investigated in order to determine the contributions of these subtypes to relaxation. In addition, the properties of ICI D7114, a novel putative stimulant of atypical beta-adrenoceptors, were investigated. Our preliminary experiments with ICI D7114 showed that this compound lacked agonist activity in rat distal colon and in fact antagonized responses to isoprenaline. We therefore studied the antagonism of isoprenaline by ICI D7114 in more detail. 2. Longitudinal segments of rat distal colon were suspended in Krebs solution at 37 degrees C for isometric recording. The Krebs solution contained EDTA (23 microM) and prazosin (0.1 microM) and was gassed with 95/5% O2/CO2. After an initial equilibration period, reproducible contractions to a submaximal concentration of methacholine (1 microM) were obtained before carrying out a concentration-response curve (CRC) to isoprenaline in a non-cumulative manner. Four consecutive CRCs to isoprenaline were carried out in each tissue with a 1 h interval between each curve. Antagonists were present in increasing concentrations during the intervals between CRCs. Control tissues received no antagonists to allow estimation of the magnitude of time-dependent changes. 3. Isoprenaline produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of methacholine-induced contractions. CRCs to isoprenaline were reproducible with no significant time-dependent changes. Propranolol produced no shift of the isoprenaline CRC at 0.01 microM and a 5 fold shift at 0.1 microM. No further shift was observed with 1 microM. CGP 20712A had no effect on the CRC to isoprenaline at 0.1, 1 and 3 microM. ICI118551 produced little or no shift at 0.1 microM and a six fold shift with 1 microM. No further shift was observed with 3 microM. ICI D7114 produced a concentration-dependent parallel rightward shift of the CRC to isoprenaline. Schild analysis gave a slope close to unity and a mean pA2 value of 7.29 for ICI D7114.4. The results with propranolol and ,l- and 132-adrenoceptor antagonists confirm the mainly atypical nature of beta-adrenoceptors in rat distal colon. There may also be a small contribution from beta2-adrenoceptors in the response to isoprenaline but beta1-adrenoceptors are absent. ICI D7114 has no agonist activity and behaves as a relatively high affinity reversible competitive antagonist of atypical beta-adrenoceptors in this preparation.", 
    "30": "1. The field stimulation-induced release of endogenous ATP and noradrenaline (NA) and contractile response in rat isolated tail artery were examined. The release of ATP was studied by extracellular electrophysiological recording and that of NA by a novel voltammetrical technique. The effects of the P2-purinceptor antagonist, suramin, on these parameters were compared with those of alpha,beta-methylene ATP, a P2X-purinoceptor desensitizing agent. 2. Neither alpha,beta-methylene ATP (10 microM) nor suramin (100-500 microM) had significant effects on the extracellularly recorded nerve terminal action potential but both abolished the ATP-induced excitatory junction current caused by stimulation at 0.1 Hz. Neither agent affected significantly the voltammetrically measured release of NA induced by 10 or 100 pulses at 20 Hz. 3. Combined blockade of both postjunctional alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors by prazosin and yohimbine (both 0.1 microM) profoundly depressed the contractile response to 10 pulses at 20 Hz. The small and fast residual contraction in the presence of these agents was abolished by alpha,beta-methylene ATP (10 microM) and inhibited by suramin in a concentration-dependent manner (10-500 microM; IC50 75 microM) and was hence probably caused by ATP or a related nucleotide. 4. When added first, alpha,beta-methylene ATP (10 microM) or suramin (100-500 microM) delayed the onset and enhanced the amplitude of the neurogenic contraction. This enhanced response was abolished by further addition of prazosin and yohimbine (both 0.1 microM). 5. The K+ channel blocker, tetraethylammonium (10 mM), dramatically enhanced the contractile response to 100 pulses at 1 Hz and caused it to become diphasic. Addition of alpha,beta-methylene ATP (10 microM)or suramin (100-500 microM) abolished the large initial twitch component of this contraction and depressed the tonic phase.6. Like alpha,beta-methylene ATP, suramin (500 microM) had no effect on the contraction caused by exogenous NA (1O nM-l10 microM) or KCI (60 mM); both agents almost abolished the contraction caused by ATP(100 microM).7. In conclusion, (i) the contractile response of rat tail artery to electrical field stimulation is mediated by both ATP and NA, and is thus an expression of ATP-NA co-transmission, (ii) the released ATP exerts two opposite effects via 'P2x-like' purinoceptors, triggering the initial rapid phase of the neurogenic contraction and restricting the NA-mediated component of the contraction; and (iii) the source and possible physiological role of the ATP which causes the inhibitory effect are unknown at present.", 
    "31": "1. The contractile effects of the novel cardiotonic agent HN-10200 (2-[3-methoxy-5-methylsulphinyl-2-thienyl]-1H-imidazo-[4,5-c]-p yri dine hydrochloride), were examined and comparisons made with the responses obtained to a structurally similar compound, sulmazole, and to a number of other compounds which are known to inhibit phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes with differing selectivities; namely, enoximone (PDE III inhibitor), Ro 20-1724 (PDE IV inhibitor) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (non-selective PDE inhibitor). 2. Contractile function, as measured by mechanical shortening, and biochemical systems involving cyclic AMP were investigated in ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g). 3. HN-10200 exerted a concentration-dependent (10(-8) M-10(-4) M) positive contractile effect, which was independent of alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor, or histamine receptor stimulation. 4. The efficacies of the contractile responses to the PDE inhibitors were of the order: HN-10200 > IBMX > sulmazole > enoximone and maximum stimulations, which were obtained at concentrations of 10(-4) M, were 54 +/- 4%, 41 +/- 7%, 38 +/- 7% and 26 +/- 5% (mean +/- s.e.) greater than basal levels, respectively (n = 6); the basal value of contractile amplitude (dL), in the absence of PDE inhibitors was 7.39 +/- 0.18% (mean +/- s.e.). Ro 20-1724 did not have any effect on contractile activity. 5. Due to low basal levels of cyclic nucleotides in isolated cells, accumulation of cyclic AMP due to the presence of the PDE inhibitors was detected only when the levels of cyclic nucleotide were enhanced with forskolin (10 microM). 6. The PDE inhibitors increased levels of cyclic AMP only at concentrations> 10-4 M. HN-10200 and sulmazole had similar concentration-dependent profiles for the accumulation of cyclic AMP; their potencies were lower than that of IBMX (concentrations of forskolin required to increase cyclic AMP by 4 pmol mg-1 protein, in the presence of maximum concentrations of the PDE inhibitors, were 13 +/- 311M, 14 +/- 3 JAM and 3 +/- 0.6 JAM [mean +/- s.e.], respectively).7. These results indicate that a similar mechanism, probably through a weak inhibition of the cyclic AMP-specific PDE isoenzymes, is responsible for the increase in levels of cyclic AMP by HN-10200 and sulmazole. However, cyclic AMP is only partially responsible for the positive contractile effect of HN-10200 and, similarly, sulmazole and IBMX. The lack of apparent increase in levels of cyclic AMP by enoximone, highlights its degree of selectivity for the PDE III isoenzyme, such that the PDE IV isoform is still present in sufficient quantity to degrade cyclic AMP within the cell. On the other hand,the potent action of Ro 20-1724 on accumulation of cyclic AMP, in addition to the lack of effect on contractile function, is in agreement with the selectivity of this compound for the PDE IV isoenzyme and compartmentalization of cyclic AMP in rat isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes.", 
    "32": "1. Increases in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) were measured in chinese hamster cultured ovary cells (clone, CHO-K1), by use of the fluorescent, calcium-sensitive dye, fura-2. 2. Addition of both ATP and UTP elicited rapid increases in [Ca2+]i due to mobilization from intracellular stores and calcium entry across the plasma membrane. 3. Omission of calcium from the extracellular medium and pre-incubation with the inorganic calcium channel blocker, nickel (Ni2+) prevented the calcium entry components of the responses. 4. Investigation of the concentration-response relationships of various analogues of ATP suggests the presence of a purinoceptor which cannot be characterized as P2X or P2Y. In addition, there appears to be a sub-population of P2Y-purinoceptors which do not cross-react with the 'nucleotide' receptor population. 5. Cross-desensitization and additivity experiments suggest that both ATP and UTP activate the same receptor. 6. Pre-incubation with the tumour-promoting agent, beta-phorbol-12,13 dibutyrate (PDBu), caused a reduction in the increases in [Ca2+]i, suggesting a role for protein kinase C in feedback inhibition of purinoceptor responses in this cell line. 7. In summary, we present evidence for the existence of an endogenous P2U-purinoceptor (or 'nucleotide receptor') which is linked to increases in [Ca2+]i in CHO-K1 cells.", 
    "33": "As high dose intravenous labetalol was always used in performing deliberate hypotensive anesthesia and it was reported that small dose of intravenous labetalol would decrease the hyperglycemic response under surgical stress, high dose intravenous labetalol may theoretically causes more pronounced reduction in plasma glucose. 14 female cervical cancer patients (ASA physical status I-II) undergoing radical total hysterectomy were selected and randomly assigned into two groups (group A and group B). The anesthesia was induced with 2.5% sodium thiopental 4 mg/kg, atropine 0.3 mg, succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg and fentanyl 3 micrograms/kg intravenously. The anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane, nitrous oxide, oxygen and vecuronium under artificial controlled ventilation. Radial artery was cannulated for continuous blood pressure monitoring and blood sampling. The first sample was taken after intubation and before skin incision and the second sample was taken 5 minutes after skin incision in group A and after giving total dose of labetalol in group B, other blood samples were taken every 30 minutes thereafter. No labetalol was given in group A patients. In group B, labetalol (1.0-1.5 mg/Kg) was administrated intravenously in repeated bolus (10 mg/bolus) to achieve a mean blood pressure around 60 torr after skin incision. All the fluid administered intraoperatively was free of glucose. Any patients with blood loss greater than 1000 ml or having blood transfusion before the 5th samples (S5) were excluded because stored blood was rich of glucose. The result revealed that plasma glucose rose significantly in both groups but the rise occurred later in group B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "Seven patients scheduled for resection of pheochromocytoma with loose preoperative control of their blood pressure were selected in our study. All the cases are impressed of pheochromocytoma that predominantly excrete norepinephrine. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl, 2.5% sodium thiopental, valium and atracurium. Labetalol was used as antihypertensive agent and was given in repeated bolus (up to total dose of 2 mg/kg) intravenously before skin incision and no supplemental dosage was given later on. The anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide, oxygen, isoflurane and atracurium. Blood pressure, heart rate and arterial blood gas analysis were recorded. After giving intravenous labetalol, mean systolic blood pressure and heart rate declined by 26.2% and 29.76% respectively when compared to preanesthetic values. Although bradycardia was noted after administration of labetalol, it seemed acceptable except for one patient who needed atropine right after receiving labetalol and another patient who needed levophed infusion after tumor removal. During tumor removal, the blood pressure of all patients was stable except one patient who needed sodium nitroprusside infusion together with labetalol to help control the elevated blood pressure. All the patients in our study had no sequela postoperatively. We concluded that total dose of labetalol (2 mg/kg) administered intravenously at the beginning of anesthesia was possible to control blood pressure during the resection of pheochromocytoma under general anesthesia even in the case of poor preoperative blood pressure control.", 
    "35": "To study the changes in myocardial digitalis binding sites in heart failure, we measured myocardial ouabain binding sites, Na-K-adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) activity, and ventricular muscle mechanical responses to acetylstrophanthidin in dogs with right-heart failure (RHF) produced by tricuspid avulsion and pulmonary artery constriction. Sham-operated dogs were studied as the control. RHF produced a significant decrease in ouabain binding sites in the right and left ventricular myocardium, which was accompanied by a proportional decrease in Na-K-ATPase activity. However, RHF and sham-operated dogs did not differ in systemic hemodynamic or right ventricular trabeculate muscle isometric contractile responses to acetylstrophanthidin. To determine whether chronic beta-adrenergic stimulation contributed to the development of Na-K-ATPase downregulation, we administered nadolol (40 mg/day) to a separate group of dogs during an early stage of RHF development. Nadolol effectively prevented the reduction of myocardial ouabain binding sites that occurred in RHF. Thus we conclude that myocardial ouabain binding sites and Na-K-ATPase activity are reduced in dogs with experimental heart failure and that these changes probably occur as a result of the attendant heightened sympathetic activity.",

    "37": "We evaluated exercise performance in 14 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension 1 h after the administration of a single dose of placebo, nifedipine (20 mg), captopril (50 mg), and propranolol (80 mg). Drugs were administered at the same time of day following a randomized, double-blind protocol. Mean resting blood pressure (+/- SE) was 135 +/- 3 mm Hg with placebo administration, 118 +/- 4 with captopril, 110 +/- 4 with nifedipine, and 115 +/- 5 with propranolol and increased with exercise to 163 +/- 4, 146 +/- 3, 136 +/- 4, 136 +/- 4, respectively. Oxygen consumption at peak exercise and at ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) was 25.2 +/- 1.1 and 18.1 +/- 1.0 ml/min/kg with placebo. Only propranolol (-2.3 ml/min/kg) decreased peak exercise oxygen consumption. Oxygen consumption at VAT was reduced by nifedipine and propranolol but unaffected by captopril. The effects on exercise capacity of blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients are dependent on the drug utilized and are not related to the amount of blood pressure reduction. The lowered oxygen consumption at VAT observed with nifedipine and propranolol, and not with captopril, might be due to an excessive downward shift of the muscle perfusion pressure--oxygen consumption relationship which might take place during exercise.", 
    "38": "The cardiac calcium channel is known to be modulated by catecholamines via beta-adrenoceptors acting through intermediary GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins). In biochemical studies on isolated membranes and reconstituted systems, it has been demonstrated that various G protein-coupled receptors, including beta-adrenoceptors, can activate G proteins and also intracellular second messengers like cyclic AMP (cAMP) even in the absence of an agonist and that antagonists can block this empty receptor action. We examined electrophysiologically whether agonist-free beta-adrenoceptors can modulate L-type calcium currents (ICa) in intact cardiac myocytes.", 
    "39": "Cardiomyocytes were isolated from ventricles of guinea pig and human hearts and from human right atrial appendage. The patch-clamp technique was applied in the single electrode mode to measure whole-cell ICa. Modulation of calcium currents by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, without addition of an agonist, was studied in the absence and presence of the direct adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin and the cAMP analog adenosine cyclic 3',5'-monophosphorothioate (Sp-cAMPS). In the presence of forskolin (0.5 mumol/L), an agent known to sensitize the adenylyl cyclase signal transduction system for receptor regulation, addition of the beta 1-selective antagonist atenolol and the nonselective antagonist propranolol (but not of the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551) caused a marked reduction of ICa in a concentration-dependent and stereoselective manner. The inhibitory effect of atenolol was reversible after washing out and was found to be half maximal and maximal (50% reduction) at about 50 and 300 nmol/L, respectively. In the absence of forskolin, inhibition of ICa by atenolol was markedly less (18% at 10 mumol/L atenolol). Finally, in contrast to forskolin-stimulated currents, atenolol (1 mumol/L) did not reduce calcium currents activated by the protein kinase A activator Sp-cAMPS (0.1 mmol/L), causing by itself a similar increase in calcium currents as forskolin.",

The results show that in preparations driven at 1 Hz, 5 and 10 mg/liter cocaine had a significant negative effect only on PTD, while 20 mg/liter (58 microM) significantly depressed all three measured parameters. Similar results were obtained in preparations driven at 0.5 Hz, which developed a greater control active tension than those driven at 1 Hz. In preparations driven at 0.5 Hz, propranolol (1 microM) had no significant effect on the active tension developed nor did it modify the negative inotropic action of cocaine. Both nifedipine (1 microM) and caffeine (1.5 mM), on the other hand, significantly reduced PTD, Vmax T, and TPT. The depressant inotropic action of cocaine was accentuated by nifedipine, but was blocked by caffeine. These observations suggest that the primary site of action of cocaine was at the level of the sarcoplasmic reticulum rather than at the sarcolemma.", 
    "42": "ucb 11056 [2-(4-morpholino-6-propyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)aminoethanol] induced a significant (approximately 25%) increase in cyclic AMP levels in different brain areas following its intraperitoneal injection. This effect started as early as 2 min postinjection and lasted for 30 min, after which cyclic AMP levels returned to normal. In hippocampal slice preparations in vitro, ucb 11056 exerted a strong potentiation of cyclic AMP levels when it was combined with agents such as norepinephrine, forskolin, and isoproterenol. Only a slight effect on cyclic AMP levels was measured when ucb 11056 was incubated alone with hippocampal slices. The potentiating effect of ucb 11056 on norepinephrine-stimulated cyclic AMP formation was partially reduced when slices were pretreated with yohimbine and totally abolished when slices were treated with propranolol. These combined data indicate that (a) ucb 11056 rapidly increases cyclic AMP levels in the rat brain in vivo and (b) ucb 11056 potentiates stimulated cyclic AMP formation in vitro. The data also suggest that the central effect of ucb 11056 might be via the modulation of cyclic AMP generation, most probably mediated through adenylate cyclase activation mechanisms combined with a weak inhibitory activity on the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity.",

Awareness of hypoglycemia and 19 symptoms were quantitated in 10 normal, young adults, each studied on four occasions in random sequence, during 1) clamped euglycemia (approximately 5 mM), 2) clamped hypoglycemia (approximately 2.5 mM), 3) clamped hypoglycemia with combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine and propranolol), and 4) clamped hypoglycemia with pan-autonomic blockade (phentolamine, propranolol and atropine). Significant (ANOVA, P < 0.001) treatment effects on the awareness of hypoglycemia (\"blood sugar low\") were noted. No change occurred in the score for this during euglycemia, but the mean +/- SE increase was 2.1 +/- 0.4 during hypoglycemia. This increase was not reduced significantly by adrenergic blockade (1.6 +/- 0.5), but was reduced significantly and substantially (approximately 70%) by pan-autonomic blockade (0.6 +/- 0.3). Significant neurogenic symptoms included shaky/tremulous (P < 0.001), heart pounding (P < 0.001), and nervous/anxious (P = 0.002), all adrenergic; and sweaty (P < 0.001), hungry (P < 0.001), and tingling (P = 0.009), all cholinergic.

    "49": "Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine produced by the cells of immune and nonimmune origin. Increased production of IL-6 is associated with disturbances of homeostasis, such as trauma, sepsis, or inflammatory diseases. Endotoxemia, tissue injury, or immune inflammatory reactions as well as physical or psychological stress are known to cause increased production of IL-6. We have confirmed this by showing that rats exposed to electric footshock, physical restraint, or a conditioned aversive stimulus have increased levels of plasma IL-6. Interestingly, the kinetics of the increase in plasma IL-6 resembled that of increase in plasma corticosterone. As no detectable endotoxin was found in the plasma samples from stressed and nonstressed rats and there is no evidence of tissue damage and inflammation in situations of restraint or conditioned aversive stimulus, a nonimmune origin of IL-6 is possible. Thus, the releasing of IL-6 into plasma may be under the regulation of neural and endocrine responses to stress. This hypothesis is supported by the decreased production of IL-6 in cultures of splenic cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from stressed animals. Furthermore, substantial attenuation of increased plasma IL-6 was achieved by adrenalectomy but not by pretreatment with the beta-receptor antagonist propranolol. The important role of the adrenal gland in the IL-6 response to stress suggests that increased plasma IL-6 may be part of the hormonal responses to stress. As IL-6 induces acute-phase proteins along with glucocorticoids from the adrenal, and regulates the secretion of various hormones from neuroendocrine and endocrine tissues, it is possible that stress-induced increase in plasma IL-6 contributes to the maintenance of homeostasis.",

The overall 10-year mortality rate, including initial in-hospital mortality, was 51%. In a multivariate analysis considering age, sex, history of cardiovascular diseases, estimated infarct size, and the occurrence of various complications during initial hospitalization (i.e. congestive heart failure, severe ventricular arrhythmias, tachycardia, hypotension, high-degree atrioventricular block and severity of pain) the following appeared as independent predictors of death: a history of diabetes mellitus (P < 0.001), congestive heart failure during hospitalization (P < 0.001), age (P < 0.001), and a history of previous myocardial infarction (P < 0.001).",

    "60": "To determine whether topical carteolol affects ocular blood flow, we studied effects of carteolol 2% on the ocular pulse waves in 9 normal volunteers, and analyzed the results as variations in pulsatile volume changes (PVC) for one minute (PVCm) using the Friedenwald's pressure-volume relationship. PVC means a volume for the pressure amplitude in each pulse. The pulse waves were recorded with a pneumatonometer and analyzed by a computer. The PVCm change 15 min after the carteolol instillation was evaluated with the control performed with biological salt solution in the same manner. The data showed a net increase in the PVCm of the carteolol-instilled eyes (21.3 +/- 6.4 microliters/min: mean +/- standard error, p < 0.05, paired t-test). Considering a finding that PVCm takes 50% of the total ocular blood flow, the results suggest a possible alteration in the total flow by a carteolol instillation.", 
    "61": "Fifty-four eyes of 45 patients with ocular hypertension developed early glaucomatous optic disc or visual field changes after a mean follow-up of 5.1 years without therapy. These changes initiated antiglaucomatous treatment, and the eyes have been followed further on therapy for 2-14 years (mean 8.0 years) in a retrospective study. The mean intraocular pressure (IOP) was lowered from 28.9 to 19.3 mmHg. Half of the eyes were still without field defects at the end of the study, whereas 7 eyes developed extensive field damage noticeable to the patients. The eyes with deteriorating visual fields could not be differentiated from the stable ones by means of the pre-therapy IOP, nor the mean or peak IOP on treatment. There was an accumulation of topical and general risk factors in the progressive eyes. The results support the importance of taking other risk factors than the IOP into consideration in the management of our glaucoma patients.", 
    "62": "The role of serotonin (5-HT) in the acquisition of the conditioned avoidance response was investigated. The effects of different serotonin agonists and antagonists, administered prior to learning sessions, were studied in groups of naive rats using the two-way shuttle box. Quipazine, an agonist at 5-HT1B/1C/2 receptors, significantly increased avoidance responding in a dose-dependent manner (1.25-10 mg/kg, s.c.). The putative 5-HT1B/1C receptor agonist TFMPP (1-[m-trifluoromethylphenyl] piperazine) at doses of 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg (s.c.), increased acquisition of conditioned avoidance but showed no significant difference from control at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg. The 5-HT1A agonist, buspirone, significantly decreased acquisition of conditioned avoidance. Increased acquisition of conditioned avoidance induced by either quipazine or TFMPP was effectively antagonized by the mixed 5-HT 1C/2 receptor antagonists, ketanserin (0.2 and 2 mg/kg, s.c.) and mianserin (1 mg/kg, s.c.). In contrast, spiperone (5-HT1A/2 receptors antagonist: 0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) only inhibited the increased acquisition induced by TFMPP. On the other hand, the 5-HT1A/1B receptors antagonist, pindolol, failed to antagonize the increase in acquisition of conditioned avoidance caused by quipazine or TFMPP. These results suggest that quipazine increases the conditioned avoidance behaviour by an action that might be mediated through stimulation of 5-HT1C receptors. The acquisition of conditioned avoidance induced by TFMPP, which was blocked by ketanserin, mianserin and spiperone but not by pindolol, suggests the involvement of 5-HT1C/2 receptors in the action of TFMPP.", 
    "63": "With the Goldblatt two-kidney two-clip method, persistent hypertension was reproduced in 7 goats. After hypertension was established and stabilized, a beta-receptor inhibitor Propranolol was given to the goats in the usual form of drug administration (20 mg, q 8 h) or in the form of chronotherapy (30 mg, QN). The mean value of BP was computed. The result suggested that, compared with the usual form of therapy, chronotherapy could reduce the hypertension to the same degree, but with less time and less amount of drug.", 
    "64": "A clinico-biochemical study indicated that the beta-blocker DL-propranolol may affect human lens epithelial hexokinase (HK) activity. In that study five key enzymes were analysed in 192 freshly excised human lens epithelia obtained during cataract surgery. In a large number of patients the epithelial HK was found to be inactive. Medical records of these patients showed widespread use of the drug DL-propranolol. In vitro experiments demonstrated a direct inhibitory effect of the drug on human lens HK activity. Lens refractive function was monitored during long term bovine lens culture experiments in which the potential cataractogenic agent was added to the culture media. DL-propranolol in a concentration of 0.1 mM reduced HK activity in bovine lens epithelium after 72 hr in organ culture and disrupted lens light focusing ability after 250 hr of incubation. Kinetic studies of HK inhibition suggested a competitive inhibitory effect of the drug on the enzyme.", 
    "65": "The inhibition of antigen aerosol-induced bronchoconstriction by heparin aerosol pretreatment has been demonstrated in conscious sheep. Therefore, we investigated the effect of heparin aerosol pretreatment on antigen aerosol-induced bronchoconstriction in anaesthetized and ventilated guinea-pigs. In one study all animals were pretreated with propranolol and indomethacin in order to produce a large bronchoconstriction, whereas in a second study this pretreatment was omitted in order to produce a smaller bronchoconstriction. In both studies aerosolized heparin failed to inhibit antigen aerosol-induced bronchoconstriction, whether delivered at 1, 10 and 100 mg/ml 10 min prior to antigen challenge or delivered at 50 mg/ml 60 min prior to antigen challenge. In contrast, salbutamol aerosol pretreatment (1 mg/ml, delivered 10 min prior to antigen challenge) produced a near-maximum inhibition of antigen aerosol-induced bronchoconstriction. These results suggest that the pulmonary antiallergic effects of aerosolized heparin are potentially species dependent.", 
    "66": "The protective effect of improving the microcirculation on the retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and the ultrastructure of the optic nerve after intravenous (i.v.) use of Salviae miltiorrhiza (SMR) was studied in a chronic intraocular hypertension model in 36 rabbits. These rabbits were treated with topical 0.5% timolol, or i.v. SMR or i.v. 0.9% saline for 1, 3, 5 or 8 weeks. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was 19.6 +/- 2 mmHg and the RGC density was 1140 +/- 121.2/mm2 in control rabbits. After one week of intraocular hypertension (IOP between 30 and 40 mmHg), the RGC densities decreased to between 650 and 820/mm2. Following the use of timolol for 1 to 8 weeks, IOP returned to control level and the RGC density increased to 1015 +/- 7/mm2. After treatment with i.v. saline for 8 weeks, the RGC density decreased progressively from 651 +/- 1/mm2 at the beginning of treatment to 83 +/- 3/mm2. The RGC density of those rabbits treated with i.v. SMR for 8 weeks remained virtually unchanged (658 +/- 5/mm2) compared to the RGC density at the beginning of the treatment. Severe ultrastructural damage of optic nerve and collapsed capillaries were found in rabbits treated with saline while these findings were mild in rabbits treated with SMR. During these periods of treatment, the intraocular hypertension did not decrease in rabbits treated with either saline or SMR. From these findings and the fact that SMR improves local microcirculation, it is considered that the compromised microcirculation is one of the mechanisms in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage in chronic glaucoma.", 
    "67": "Chinese are more sensitive to the beta-blocking and hypotensive effects of propranolol than Caucasians. To determine the contribution of ethnic differences in the plasma binding of propranolol to the differences in sensitivity, 8 Caucasians (22.8 +/- 1.5 yr) and 8 Chinese (31.8 +/- 2.1 yr) were studied following single doses of 0, 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg propranolol orally. The binding of propranolol in plasma was determined by equilibrium dialysis after addition of 300 mg racemic propranolol to the plasma. The concentrations of free and bound (+) and (-)-propranolol were determined by stereospecific high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Dosage had no influence on the plasma binding of either enantiomer. The unbound fractions of both (-)-propranolol (16.06 +/- 0.79% vs 12.41 +/- 0.93%, P < 0.05) and (+)-propranolol (17.73 +/- 0.81% vs 14.33 +/- 0.89%, P < 0.01) were greater in Chinese than Caucasians, respectively. In both groups, the ratio of unbound (-) to (+)-propranolol was less than 1 (P < 0.01) and was greater in Chinese (0.91 +/- 0.01 vs 0.88 +/- 0.01) (P < 0.01), implying that in Chinese less isomers of both types were bound and there was a greater unbound proportion of the pharmacologically active (-)-propranolol which may contribute to their increased sensitivity to propranolol. It is demonstrated that ethnic differences in stereoselective protein binding may be an important variable in interindividual determinants of drug response.", 
    "68": "One of the functions of the sympathetic nervous system is to produce a short-term increase in blood pressure. It might be thought, therefore, that antihypertensive drugs which interfere with the functioning of the sympathetic nervous system (e.g. betablockers) would reduce blood pressure variability over 24 h whereas those that act independently of it (e.g. ACE inhibitors) would not. Two groups of 10 hypertensives underwent noninvasive 24-h blood pressure monitoring before and after antihypertensive treatment with a betablocker (atenolol) and an ACE inhibitor (benazepril) respectively. Blood pressure variability was measured by the variability coefficient (standard deviation/mean). Atenolol induced a non-statistically significant decrease in blood pressure variability, whereas benazepril caused a statistically significant increase in systolic blood pressure variability. Therefore, we conclude that the evaluation of ACE-inhibitor therapeutic effect on blood pressure by the \"casual\" measurement can be misleading in judging the efficacy of such drugs.", 
    "69": "The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage of sotalol hydrochloride are reviewed. The chemical name of sotalol hydrochloride is 4'-[1-hydroxy-2-(isopropylamino)ethyl]methanesulfonanilide monohydrochloride. Sotalol is a class III antiarrhythmic that prolongs the action potential and refractoriness of cardiac tissue and has potent nonselective beta-blocking activity. Sotalol is well absorbed after oral administration. The pharmacokinetics of sotalol can be described by an open, linear, two-compartment model. The drug is eliminated primarily by the kidneys; mean elimination half-life is 12 hours. Sotalol has been found to be effective in controlling life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, including sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and premature ventricular complexes. Although sotalol has FDA-approved labeling for use in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias only, it is also effective against a variety of supraventricular arrhythmias. Noncardiac adverse effects include fatigue, impotence, depression, headache, nausea, diarrhea, and increased triglyceride levels. Cardiovascular adverse effects include atrioventricular block, bradycardia, hypotension, exacerbation of heart failure, and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Overall, 11-21% of patients experience adverse effects; 6-18% of these patients have reactions serious enough to warrant the discontinuation of sotalol therapy. The initial dosage of oral sotalol hydrochloride in adults is 80 mg twice daily or 160 mg once daily; the dosage can be increased every three to four days in increments of 40-160 mg/day to a maximum of 480 mg/day. Sotalol is useful in the control of intractable, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, as well as a variety of supraventricular arrhythmias, in patients who do not respond to or are intolerant of more conventional antiarrhythmics.", 
    "70": "Isolated perfused spontaneously beating rabbit hearts were treated with increasing concentrations of norepinephrine (0.01, 0.1, 0.5 mumol/l) either alone or in presence of propranolol (0.1 mumol/l). For analysis of the epicardial activation and repolarization process and epicardial mapping (256 unipolar leads) was performed. For each electrode the activation and repolarization time was determined. From these data the \"breakthrough-points\" (BTP) of epicardial activation were determined. At each electrode an activation vector (VEC) was calculated giving direction and velocity of the local excitation wave. The beat similarity of various heart beats (under NE) compared to control was evaluated by determination of the percentage of identical BTP and of similar VEC (deviation < or = 5 degrees). Moreover at each electrode the local activation recovery interval (ARI) and its standard deviation (of 256 leads, dispersion, DISP) were determined. Norepinephrine alone (0.01, 0.1, 0.5 mumol/l) led to an increase in left ventricular pressure, heart rate and DISP with concomitant frequency dependent reduction in ARI, and to changes in the epicardial activation pattern (reduction in BTP, VEC). We found that in the presence of propranolol (0.1 mumol/l) norepinephrine prolonged ARI and reduced ARI-dispersion. This effect was not due to changes in heart rate. The disturbing effects on the activation pattern were diminished. These effects could be prevented by pretreatment with 1 mumol/l prazosin. From these results we conclude, that norepinephrine prolongs the relative action potential duration via stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptor and enhances cellular coupling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "Thirty-three moderate hypertensives were converted to a 2-drug regimen of metoprolol and diuretic and BPs stabilized at a well-controlled level. They then completed one of three conditions over an 8-week interval: (I) 16 sessions of TBF (hand and foot warming); (II) 16 sessions of frontal EMG-BF; (III) regular home monitoring of BP. Attempts were then made to withdraw the patients from the sympatholytic medication. Those successfully withdrawn were followed up for one year. There were no significant advantages for TBF over the other two conditions in the short term or with long-term follow-up. Only 27% of treated patients (including Condition III failures who were remedicated and treated with TBF) were successfully off of the sympatholytic at a one-year follow-up. The generally poor results on clinical outcome were confirmed by clinic BPs, home BPs by patients, and 24-hour ambulatory BPs.", 
    "72": "Class III (Vaughan-Williams classification) antiarrhythmic drugs prolong the cardiac action potential without affecting depolarisation. The 3 class III drugs currently in general use are amiodarone, sotalol and bretylium. The presenting features of acute toxicity are different for each agent and are, therefore, discussed separately. Several new class III antiarrhythmic agents are under development, including dofetilide and d-sotalol, but specific data on overdoses of these potent class III drugs are not yet available. Amiodarone toxicity following acute overdose is rare because poor bioavailability and a large volume of distribution limit the peak serum concentration. Toxicity is low even if high serum concentrations are reached. The major risks from acute overdose are hypotension (intravenous administration only) and arrhythmia if other factors, such as hypokalaemia or additional antiarrhythmic agents are present. Management is chiefly directed at reducing absorption with activated charcoal or cholestyramine, and monitoring for arrhythmia. Sotalol is a beta-blocker with additional class III activity. Oral bioavailability is high, and overdosed patients can present with bradycardia, hypotension and major haemodynamic collapse. The combination of bradycardia and prolongation of the QT interval is associated with malignant arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes. Management principles include observation and correction of bradycardia with endocardial pacing, intravenous adrenergic drugs and glucagon. The risk of arrhythmia can be substantially reduced by intravenous potassium and magnesium supplements. d-Sotalol is a potent class III drug devoid of beta-blocking activity and may be expected to share the proarrhythmic affects of the racemic mixture in overdose, without pronounced hypotension and bradycardia. Intravenous bretylium in overdose causes an initial hypertensive effect, followed by profound hypotension from systemic vasodilation. Management is directed at controlling hypotension with volume expansion and norepinephrine (noradrenaline).", 
    "73": "Oculo-pression tonometry (OPT) was introduced in 1984 as a clinical method of examining ocular hydrodynamics. The method involves measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) by applanation tonometry performed before, during and after application of a pressure load that disturbs the dynamic balance between aqueous production and aqueous outflow. From the IOP before (P0) and immediately after (Pr0) the 8-min pressure load period, the outflow facility C(u) can be calculated: [formula: see text] The examinations performed so far have shown that (1) reduced outflow facility can be detected by OPT with a high degree of reliability, and (2) reduced outflow facility is always preceded by the development of glaucoma damage to the optic nerve head. A prospective study has shown that in the group of patients with reduced outflow facility but without glaucoma damage, 73% developed glaucoma damage with typical changes of the papilla and visual field within 3-7 years after the first examination.", 
    "74": "The effects of pentagastrin on gastroduodenal myoelectric activity were investigated in chronic experiments on rabbits before and after beta adrenoceptor blocking by propranolol. Ulcerogenic dose of pentagastrin (0.2 mg/kg) leads to bilateral duodenogastric dyskinesia, during which duodenal activity increased, and gastric one decreased. Propranolol (2 mg/kg) provoked a more significant pentagastrin-induced disfunction, retrograde duodenogastric dyskinesia. The results indicate a protective effect of the adrenergic mechanisms during pentagastrin ulcerogenesis.", 
    "75": "Adrenergic regulation of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-3 (IL-3) activities production by adhesive and nonadhesive bone marrow cells under immobilization stress has been studied in experiments on F1 (CBA x C57Bl/6) mice. 10-hour immobilization had been established to lead to rise of IL-1 and IL-3 activities in supernatants on days 2, 5 and 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 after stress, respectively. The use of Wilcoxon rank T-test demonstrated that alpha-adrenergic antagonist (dihydroergotaminum, 3.9 mg/kg) injection to stressed mice suppressed exclusively IL-1 activities production. At the same time, beta-adrenoblocker (propranolol, 5 mg/kg) inhibited IL-3 production. Thus, adrenergic structures take an active part in regulation of IL-1 and IL-3 production by haemopoiesis inducing microenvironment bone marrow cells under immobilization stress.", 
    "76": "A potent beta-agonist (clenbuterol) was administered perorally to young calves for 50 days. After this period the animals were slaughtered and beta-adrenoceptor density, ligand affinity, and basal and stimulated adenylate cyclase activities were studied in smooth muscle and epithelium of the trachea. Although the density of lung beta-adrenoceptors was down regulated by clenbuterol, cAMP production remained constant (epithelium) or even increased (smooth muscle). Therefore desensitization of beta-adrenoceptors in the trachea was not observed. This might be a reason for the effectiveness of long-term treatment with beta-agonists.", 
    "77": "The efficacy of antihypertensive agents was compared when given at different time points in the circadian rhythm. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were kept on a 12/12-h cycle with lights on/off at 07:00/19:00 h. A computerized system was used to measure intraarterial blood pressure and heart rate continuously. Agents or vehicle were intravenously injected at two time points. One at the beginning of the sleeping period, at which low efficacy was expected (T = 10), and one at T = 16, which is 3 h before the circadian peaks in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), aimed at reducing the rise in BP and HR at awakening. The hypotensive effect of propranolol, metoprolol, labetalol, prazosin, clonidine, and rilmenidine was greater when injected at T = 16 than at T = 10 (p < 0.05 for propranolol, metoprolol, and rilmenidine). In contrast, the renal vasodilators captopril and tertatolol were more potent after injection at T = 10. Felodipine was equally effective at both time points. Thus, the effects of antihypertensive agents are related to the phase of the circadian rhythm. The data on the sympatholytic agents in general and beta-blockers and centrally acting agents in particular support antihypertensive regimens with timed administrations.", 
    "78": "Clinical and experimental data have suggested a role of enhanced sympathetic nervous activity in the pathogenesis and evolution of coronary heart disease. A significant relationship was observed between the circadian pattern of plasma catecholamine levels and the onset of coronary events, which occur most frequently in the early morning, concomitance with sympathetic activation. An enhanced sympathetic tone is frequently observed in both the acute phase of myocardial infarction and in the postinfarction period, potentiating myocardial damage and increasing the risk of arrhythmias. An indirect demonstration of the importance of sympathetic activation arises from the results of several trials on the effects of beta-blocker treatment during and after myocardial infarction, showing a significant reduction in total mortality, sudden deaths and reinfarction. There is accumulating evidence that repeated activation of sympathetic nervous system may contribute to atheroma development and progression. Enhanced sympathetic activity seems to be involved in the pathogenesis and maintenance of essential hypertension as well as in its natural history, contributing to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy and vascular hypertrophy. The problems in measuring and defining the various levels of autonomic activity in human beings and the complexity of the relationship between nervous and non nervous factors in cardiovascular diseases make difficult to establish whether sympathetic hyperactivity represents an independent cardiovascular risk factor.", 
    "79": "There is still uncertainty of whether combined therapy with a beta-blocker and calcium-channel antagonist provides additive or synergistic clinical benefits in most patients with stable angina pectoris. The comparative antianginal effect of atenolol 50 mg and atenolol 50 mg and slow release nifedipine (20 mg) twice a day was assessed in 27 patients with chronic stable angina in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. After a 4 week run-in period on atenolol, patients were randomly allocated to receive either atenolol alone or its combination with nifedipine and then crossed over to the alternative treatment for a further 4 weeks. Symptom-limited exercise treadmill tests were performed according to the Naughton protocol. The major endpoints in this study were (a) exercise time to pain; (b) exercise time to > or = 1 mm ST depression; (c) total exercise time; (d) maximal ST-segment depression; (e) number of anginal attacks; and (f) nitrate consumption. The preexercise systolic blood pressure was lower on the combination treatment than on atenolol alone, but heart rate was lower on atenolol compared with the combination treatment. There was no difference in the systolic blood pressure at the onset of pain or at 1 mm ST depression, while heart rate was lower on both occasions with atenolol compared to the combination treatment. There was no difference between the two treatments in terms of the rate-pressure product at the onset of pain or at 1 mm ST depression. Twice as many patients experienced pain later with the combination treatment than with atenolol alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "80": "During coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, patients pretreated with the combination of beta-blocking drugs and Ca2+ antagonists for control of myocardial ischemia often respond inadequately to adrenergic stimulants administered after cardioplegic arrest. In this study, the effects of the combination of a beta-blocker (propranolol) and a Ca2+ antagonist (nifedipine) on the spontaneous recovery, as well as the adrenergic response of the isolated, perfused, working rat heart after a period of cardioplegic arrest were evaluated. After pretreatment of the animals with propranolol and/or nifedipine, hearts were removed, perfused in the presence of pretreatment drugs, subjected to 45 minutes of normothermic cardioplegic arrest, reperfused, and finally stimulated with exponentially increasing concentrations of a sympathomimetic drug. Propranolol, and to a lesser extent nifedipine, protected the hearts during cardioplegic arrest, as indicated by the improved recovery and maximum response to adrenergic stimulation after cardioplegia. Isoprenaline, a beta-stimulant, (at a 100 x higher than conventional concentration), elicited an adequate inotropic and chronotropic response. Stimulation by the alpha, beta-stimulant adrenaline or dobutamine improved only the inotropic response of propranolol and combination treated hearts. Cautious extrapolation of the results to human may suggest continuation of drug therapy of patients before CABG surgery.", 
    "81": "Nine patients (16 eyes) with narrow angle type of chronic simple glaucoma were evaluated. Besides the general definition, narrow angle type of chronic simple glaucoma is a special type of primary open angle glaucoma which has a narrow and open angle on goniogscopy, no obvious difference on angle configuration at low or high IOP. Laser peripheral iridectomy may be a method of differential diagnosis in this type of glaucoma and may be relatively effective in preventing further attacks of acute angle closure glaucoma which is due to the lens continues to enlarge with age and causes pupillary block. The medical treatment is the first choice to deal with this type of glaucoma, while it can not be controlled, the filtering operations should be used in time.", 
    "82": "The human heart contains both beta 1 and beta 2-adrenoceptors; both mediate positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. In chronic heart failure, beta-adrenoceptor number is reduced, presumably, by down-regulation by endogenous noradrenaline which is elevated due to increased sympathetic activity. Since the human heart contains only a few spare receptors for beta-adrenoceptor-mediated positive inotropic effects and the amount of spare receptors declines in chronic heart failure, it is not surprising that the reduced beta-adrenoceptor number is accompanied by decreased contractile responses to beta-adrenoceptor agonists (including endogenous catecholamines), and the extent of decrease in maximal inotropic response is more pronounced as the disease becomes more advanced. Moreover, in chronic heart failure myocardial G(i)-protein, which inhibits cAMP formation, is increased, which might further contribute to the reduction in beta-adrenoceptor-mediated effects. It appears that, at present, the best therapy for severe heart failure is a successful heart transplant, since in the transplanted heart beta-adrenoceptor number and function seems to be normalized. Moreover, the data currently available do not suggest any development of super- or subsensitivity of postsynaptic cardiac beta-adrenoceptors in the transplanted human heart.", 
    "83": "Secondary cardioprotection of patients with angina pectoris can be accomplished by selecting appropriate drugs for the specific clinical setting. Calcium-antagonists are the first choice drugs in patients with vasospastic angina or in those clinical situations in which vasoconstriction plays a significant pathogenetic role. On the contrary beta-blockers reduce mortality and the probability of myocardial infarction in patients with unstable angina. The beneficial effects of aspirin on survival of patients with unstable angina is also well known, whereas ACE-inhibitors reduce mortality as well as the incidence of unstable angina in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Also nonpharmacologic treatments (physical exercise, preconditioning) may have beneficial effects although their role is not well established yet.", 
    "84": "The Authors review several pharmacological interventions aimed at protecting the ischemic myocardium. Drugs which have been widely used in the treatment of ischemic heart diseases, such as beta-blockers, nitrates and calcium-antagonists, are able to delay the development of ischemic injury if administered before the beginning of ischemia, but their clinical effectiveness is limited. The new drugs which are presently investigated are designed to counteract the molecular mechanisms which mediate irreversible tissue injury, namely cytosolic calcium overload, cellular hyperosmolarity, and free radical production. In particular, interventions able to interfere with the release of calcium from its intracellular stores would be of major importance. In this regards, it is interesting to point out that derivatives of phenylalkylamine calcium-antagonists have been reported to modulate the opening probability of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium channels.", 
    "85": "Although prevention of heart failure recently has become a realistic issue, management of heart failure once the syndrome has developed, is mainly supportive, based on the various cardiac and peripheral changes which occur in the course of heart failure. Of these, abnormal neurohormonal activation is of major pathophysiologic and prognostic significance. Consequently, modulation of neuroendocrine activation is now recognized a prime target in the treatment of heart failure, besides diuretic therapy. In this respect, the value of converting enzyme inhibition is well established. Future developments in this area include dopaminergic agents, vasopressin antagonists, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, renin inhibitors, spironolactone and, possibly, ANF peptidase inhibitors. Besides diuretics, necessary when signs of fluid retention are present, the approach to heart failure management involves other pharmacologic issues. In view of abnormal vascular control with vasoconstriction prevailing during progressive heart failure, it clearly makes sense to vasodilate. However, of available vasodilators, only the combination of relatively high dose nitrates and hydralazine has proven to be of clinical significance, in terms of hemodynamics, exercise capacity and survival. It is possible, though, that novel generation dihydropyridine derivatives may prove beneficial as well. Thus far, there has been much debate concerning the usefulness and particularly the safety of positive inotrope therapy and inodilator treatment. Taken together, this concern relates to presence and predominance of cAMP-dependent mechanisms to induce these effects. Thus, sympathomimetic agents and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as milrinone or enoximone, are without beneficial effects, but instead shorten survival during long-term therapy. This may be different where compounds which act through cAMP-independent mechanisms, i.e., calcium sensitization or sodium channel stimulation, are concerned, but needs to be confirmed yet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "86": "There is strong circumstantial evidence supporting the hypothesis that essential arterial hypertension is associated at least initially, with an augmented sympathetic activity. The link between the sympathetic nervous system and the hypertensive state is further supported by the clinical evidence furnished by the efficacy of drugs interfering with sympathetic control. In this lecture we address the role of behavioral and mental factors, globally indicated with the word \"stress\", that may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of the hypertensive condition. At the core of this approach, there is the view that, operationally, mental stress could be conveniently substituted by some quantification of the sympathetic activity (in its continuous balance with vagal modulation). In our laboratory we employ the normalized power of the low frequency (LF, 0.1 Hz) component of the autospectra of RR interval variability as an index of sympathetic drive. In hypertensives at rest there is a prevalence of LF (as compared to the HF, high frequency, component, which is a marker of vagal activity). Additionally the responsiveness to both physical and mental stimuli is diminished. After chronic beta-adrenergic blockade, the spectral profile, and its responsiveness, returns toward normal. Furthermore the gain of baroreflex mechanisms (obtained with cross spectral analysis of RR interval and systolic arterial pressure variability) is also increased by atenolol treatment. We conclude that this approach may permit a better quantification of the role played by behavioral and mental factors in essential hypertension, and help to define individualized treatments.", 
    "87": "The treatment of microvascular angina (anginal pain resulting from myocardial ischemia due to dysfunction of small coronary arteries) is empiric and often ineffective at present. The poor knowledge of the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the microvascular dysfunction and the possible heterogeneous nature of the disease limit the possibility of a rational therapeutic approach to these patients. The failure of traditional antiischemic therapy is confirmed by the frequent unresponsiveness of angina and by the reduced exercise tolerance with administration of sublingual nitrates. Despite that, beta-blockers and calcium-antagonists, when given either alone or in combination, are beneficial in the control of symptoms in some patients. Alternative forms of treatment, based on some pathophysiological hypotheses and clinical observations, include xanthine derivatives, ACE-inhibitors, alpha-blocking agents, imipramine and, in women, oestrogens. The actual clinical usefulness of these drugs, however, is questionable at present, as their efficacy should be evaluated with more adequate studies in the future.", 
    "88": "Three main types of damage induced by ischemia and reperfusion have been identified: lethal reperfusion injury, microvascular and macrovascular reperfusion injury, and myocardial stunning. Pathophysiological and therapeutic aspects of these ischemia/reperfusion sequelae are reviewed and discussed on the light of recent experimental and clinical results.", 
    "89": "We estimated antagonist activity of metoprolol, pindolol, and propranolol in elderly cardiovascular patients by determining the extent to which the drugs occupied rabbit lung beta 1- and rat reticulocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors in plasma samples during drug treatment. The randomized, double-blind, crossover study was carried out by administering twice daily 100 mg metoprolol, 5 mg pindolol, and 80 mg propranolol for 7 days to 20 hypertensive subjects with a mean age of about 70 years. A 2-week interval was kept between administration of the different regimens. Receptor occupancy was measured at 1 hour before and 2 hours after administration of the last dose of each regimen by adding rabbit lung beta 1- and rat reticulocyte beta 2-receptors to plasma samples and by labeling the receptors with a radiolabeled beta-antagonist, (-)-[3H]CGP-12177. The results and conclusions were the following: (a) The extent to which metoprolol, pindolol, and propranolol occupied rabbit lung beta 1- and rat reticulocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors in plasma samples estimated accurately the intensity of beta-receptor antagonism in the patients who did not tolerate physiological and pharmacological tests measuring the degree of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade. (b) The mean beta 1- and beta 2-receptor occupancy of pindolol and propranolol varied between 76% and 99% during the treatments. The mean beta 1-receptor occupancy of the metoprolol regimen varied between 54% and 92%, and its beta 2-receptor occupancy varied between 6% and 38%. Thus the antagonist activity of the metoprolol regimen differed significantly from that of the other regimens (ANOVA for repeated measures, p < 0.05 and 0.001, for the beta 1- and beta 2-occupancy, respectively). (c) The extent of beta 1- and beta 2-receptor occupancy in plasma samples was in conformity with the literature on the intensity, selectivity, and duration of beta-blockade after similar drug doses. (d) The data on the receptor occupancy of beta-blocking drugs in plasma samples appear to be valuable in analyzing their effects, and it may be a method for optimizing drug therapy for aged cardiovascular patients.", 
    "90": "In recent years diastolic cardiac function has attracted increasing attention since parameters of diastolic function were found to be altered earlier or more specifically than parameters of systolic function. Diastolic cardiac function is determined by both active (muscular relaxation, redistribution of calcium, synchronization, etc.) and passive (myocardial structure, fibrosis, etc.) factors. As a consequence, a comprehensive assessment of diastolic cardiac function cannot be based on one single parameter. For a complete analysis of diastolic function it is necessary to perform invasive diagnostic procedures involving the measurement of atrial and ventricular pressures, as well as the registration of volume changes with a high time resolution. In addition, it is necessary to measure wall thickness and ventricular configuration, so that apart from filling parameters the stress-strain relationship can be obtained. Noninvasive techniques (Doppler echocardiography, radionuclear ventriculography, apexcardiography) may suggest alterations in diastolic function as well. They ought to be complemented by additional diagnostic procedures (pulmonary pressure, stress testing, etc.). Therapy must consider potentially harmful effects on diastolic function parameters, particularly if changes in myocardial oxygen consumption may result (heart rate, parietal wall stress). Calcium antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine), phosphodiesterase inhibitors (milrinone), beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists with vasodilating effects (e.g., celiprolol) all have beneficial effects on diastolic myocardial function. A range of diastolic function parameters is being reviewed in the following paper. Their role in the estimation of cardiac function and their responsiveness to therapy in hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, and coronary heart disease is being discussed.", 
    "91": "The changes in conductivity of skeletal muscle vessels of the hind leg and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity in outflowing blood after electrostimulation (5 V, 0.5 ms, 20 Hz, 30 s) at the L4-L5 level of the peripheral end of the transected isolated sympathetic chain were studied in experiments on anaesthetized cats. Stimulation of the sympathetic chain induced vasoconstriction and release of t-PA from the vascular wall into the blood. Pretreatment with the beta-adrenoblocker propranolol neither changed the character of vascular reactions nor blocked t-PA secretion. Efferent stimulation of the sympathetic chain against a background of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade by dihydroergotoxin increased blood flow and was accompanied by a rise in t-PA activity. The M-cholinergic blocker atropine suppressed both vascular relaxation and release of t-PA into the blood. Vasodilatation accompanied by t-PA secretion could be induced by intraarterial infusion of acetylcholine and blocked by atropine. The existence of a neurogenic mechanism controlling t-PA release from the vascular wall involving a sympathetic cholinergic pathway and connected with excitation of vascular M-cholinoceptors by acetylcholine is suggested.", 
    "92": "Publications on the subject of conjunctiva in 1991 have been reviewed. Clinical relevant topics have been stressed. In the field of conjunctival affections caused by microorganisms a spectrum of bilateral squamous conjunctival tumors associated with human papillomavirus type 16 were first documented. Chlamydial antibodies cause proliferation of lymphocytes. The peripheral lymphocyte proliferative response to whole chlamydial elementary bodies seems to have a strong correlation between the responses to the Chlamydia trachomatis serotypes B and L1. In the field of impression cytology of the conjunctiva the topographical distribution of ocular surface cells was described. In patients with glaucoma using long-term topical medication, there seem to be significant degrees of conjunctival metaplasia associated with the number of glaucoma medications. These changes in the conjunctival surface may be related to the preservatives in the preparations (benzalkonium compounds). An ultrastructural defect in conjunctiva in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa may increase the susceptibility of the conjunctiva to minor mechanical trauma. Thus resulting in the bullous and cicatrical changes seen clinically.", 
    "93": "There are five major therapeutic groups for possible evaluation in the ISIS 5 trial. They include intravenous beta-blocking agents, glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) therapy, newer anticoagulant and antithrombotic agents (hirudin and Hirulog), newer thrombolytic drugs such as recombinant plasminogen activator (r-PA) and surfactant and emulsifying agents such as Rheothrx. Many pilot studies are underway. Selection of agents will depend on the scientific interest of collaborating hospitals as well as the agent's safety and efficacy.", 
    "94": "The present study evaluated the contribution of the presynaptic beta 2-adrenergic facilitation in the increase of plasma norepinephrine levels observed in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension. Epinephrine is thought to be the major endogenous activator of this presynaptic mechanism and although basal epinephrine levels were similar in normotensive and DOCA-salt hypertensive rats, the sensitivity of the presynaptic beta 2-adrenergic facilitatory mechanism was found to be increased in hypertensive animals. This was shown in vivo by the enhanced plasma norepinephrine increases induced by a direct presynaptic stimulation with a selective beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonist. Furthermore, the adrenal medulla was hyperreactive in response to a hemorrhagic hypotension of 50 mm Hg, as shown by a greater plasma epinephrine increase in DOCA-salt-treated rats, and tissue concentrations of epinephrine were found to be greatly increased in the aorta of hypertensive animals. The possible contribution of epinephrine activation of the presynaptic beta 2-adrenergic mechanism on the development and maintenance of DOCA-salt hypertension was assessed by evaluating the effects of chronic or acute adrenalectomy, respectively. Acute adrenalectomy decreased significantly the blood pressure only in hypertensive animals, whereas chronic adrenalectomy abolished the plasma norepinephrine and blood pressure differences between normotensive and DOCA-salt-treated rats. The present results therefore suggest that the presynaptic beta 2-adrenergic facilitation is exaggerated in DOCA-salt hypertension, mainly due to an increased sensitivity of this mechanism and to a hyperreactivity of the adrenal medulla.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "95": "The usual therapeutic doses for the treatment of both angina pectoris and cardiac arrhythmia vary widely among beta-blocking agents, with a maximum of about a 200-fold difference, despite subjects' same clinical improvement at the varying doses. In order to clarify the mechanism of this difference, we analyzed retrospectively the cardiac pharmacological activities of beta-blocking agents based on the receptor occupancy theory by using both their unbound concentrations in plasma at steady state (Cssf), as well as dissociation constants (KB and KI, which were determined by in vitro binding experiments and by in vitro pharmacological experiments, respectively) for a beta 1 receptor. A significant log-linear relationship between Cssf and the KB values was obtained with a slope of regression line of 0.91 (r = 0.83, p < 0.01). On the other hand, the correlation coefficient of the relationship between Cssf and the KI values was low, with a slope of about 0.5 (r = 0.80, p < 0.01). The beta 1 receptor occupancies calculated from KB values at the steady state condition after the oral administration of usual doses were almost constant (80.5 +/- 16.8%), regardless of the wide variation of usual doses of the drugs. This result indicated that the receptor occupancy may be an appropriate indicator for the pharmacological activity of the drug. Furthermore, there were significant relationships between the primary pharmacokinetic parameters: Cb/Cf, CLtot/F, and Vdssf, and the octanol/water partition coefficient (PC), with correlation coefficients of 0.80, 0.50 and 0.85, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "96": "Evaluation of the influence of the autonomic nervous system on the ventricular repolarization duration was carried out using beat-to-beat analysis of the time intervals between the peaks of the R and T waves (RTm). After pre-processing of digitized Holter ECG's, auto and cross spectrum analyses were applied to heart rate and repolarization duration variability signals. Coherence analysis was used to assess the existence of common spectral contributions. The heart rate variability signal was used as reference of the sympatho-vagal balance at the sinus node. It was found that, in normal individuals, the autonomic nervous system directly influences the ventricular repolarization duration and that this influence is qualitatively very similar to the one that modulates the heart rate. Pathological alteration of these parallel autonomic activities to the heart (on the sinus node and on the ventricle) might cause uncoupling between depolarization and repolarization.", 
    "97": "Chronic application of beta-blockers often induces tachyphylaxia of unknown origin. After long-term topical pretreatment of pindolol and timolol in rabbit eyes (up to 12 weeks, twice a day) beta 2-adrenergic receptors were localized and quantified with autoradiographic methods. Frozen sections of albino rabbit eyes were labelled with [125I] cyanopindolol. Quantification revealed a significant increase in the density of beta 2-receptors after premedication with pindolol in the ciliary body and the corneal epithelium. This increase was detectable after 2 weeks of premedication and reached its maximum after 4 weeks. After premedication with timolol a significant increase of beta 2-receptors in the epithelium of the ciliary body and the corneal epithelium was visible. Following pindolol over an equivalent time-course, to that of timolol administrations, an increasing number of beta 2-receptor sites was also observed. No significant changes were visible for either kind of premedication investigated (pindolol/timolol) in the corneal endothelium, the lens or the choroid. Chronic application of topically instilled beta-blocking agents leads to a significant increase in receptor density in ocular structures that are involved in aqueous humor production. This up-regulation of beta 2-adrenergic receptors might explain the intraocular events at receptor level in relation to the phenomenon of tachyphylaxis.", 
    "98": "In a retrospective study the effects of goniotrephination following antiglaucoma medication and argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) were examined. The study addressed the first treated eye in each of 61 patients. In all patients tropial antiglaucoma medication was continued after ALT. In the period between ALT and goniotrepanation the cup-disc ratio (CDR) progressed significantly (P < 0.01), with worsening of visual field defects. The long-term antiglaucoma medication and the ALT had no effect on the wound healing following the filtering procedure. ALT is contraindicated in preexisting pathologic CDR and visual field defects. In such cases intraocular pressure must be reduced to below 20 mmHg: filtration surgery is effective in lowering the intraocular pressure sufficiently.", 
    "99": "The nonselective beta adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, the beta-2 selective agonist clenbuterol and, to a lesser extent, the beta-1 selective agonists dobutamine and prenalterol reduced locomotor activity of rats in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were antagonized by the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol, suggesting mediation by beta adrenergic receptors. The hydrophilic beta adrenergic antagonist CGP-12177, which crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, also blocked the effect of clenbuterol on locomotor activity with a potency similar to propranolol, suggesting that stimulation of peripheral beta adrenergic receptors is sufficient for reducing locomotor activity.", 
    "100": "Sudden cardiac death is a major health problem in the industrially developed countries. The risk of sudden cardiac death may be reduced by early detection of coronary heart disease, elimination of the risk factors, treatment of the ischaemia in patients known to have coronary heart disease and suppression of ventricular arrhythmias. Of all the therapeutic measures currently available to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death, beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs (beta blockers) appear to be the most effective. In this paper their actions are reviewed and evidence for their efficacy is presented."
