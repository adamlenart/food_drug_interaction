    "0": "Injection of atropine sulphate induces tachycardia in conscious unrestrained cats. Injection of the same dose of atropine sulphate after a beta-blocking agent is accompanied by less severe tachycardia. We suggest that atropine sulphate-induced tachycardia in conscious cats, and in anaesthetized animals, is linked to changes in sympathetic-vagal balance, to activation of sympathetic centres and obviously to muscarinic antagonistic effects of atropine in sympathetic nerves.", 
    "1": "beta-Adrenoreceptor antagonists containing several pharmacophores, so called alprenolol-Jeffamines, were studied. These compounds are derived from Jeffamine NH2-CH-(CH3)-CH2-[-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-]n-NH2, n = 2.6 ave. by substitution of nitrogen with 3-(2-allylphenoxy)-2-hydroxypropyl groups, which are part of the Alprenolol pharmacophore. Alprenolol-Jeffamines inhibited (-)isoprenaline stimulated adenylate cyclase activity; the derivative with one pharmacophore was about 4-fold and the derivative with two pharmacophores was about 17-fold less potent than (+/-)alprenolol; the trisubstituted derivative which has one complete and two partial pharmacophores was ineffective. The ratio of Ki's for inhibition of (-)3H-DHA binding and for inhibition of adenylate cyclase were approximately one for each derivative. When (+/-)alprenolol and alprenolol-Jeffamine derivatives were injected intraperitoneally into rats and heart membranes or homogenates were prepared 18-20 h afterwards, the mono, di, and trisubstituted derivatives, but not (+/-)alprenolol, inhibited binding of (-)3H-DHA. This persistency pattern is different from that observed in vitro, where only di and trisubstituted derivatives are persistent. Slow metabolism/slow excretion of the monosubstituted derivative may be a source of the increased persistency in vivo. In similarly prepared animals, the dose-response curve for (-)isoprenaline stimulated adenylate cyclase was shifted to the right 3-to-4 fold for mono and disubstituted derivatives but was unaffected by (+/-)alprenolol and the trisubstituted derivative. The results suggest that these derivatives interact with physiologically important beta-adrenoreceptors in vitro, and that, in vivo, they persistently block beta-adrenoreceptors and inhibit isoprenaline stimulated adenylate cyclase.", 
    "2": "Three propranolol analogues, bearing the oxygen of the --OH group enclosed in a 1,4-dioxanic rigid system, were synthetized. The lack of beta-blocking activity found for these compounds demonstrates the important role played by a free--OH group in the drug-receptor interaction.", 
    "3": "Occasionally, undesired side effects of drugs occur in different ocular structures. The author reports on respecting lesions of lacrimal apparatus, conjunctive and cornea, lens, retina, and optic nerve; finally, the influence of different drugs on the intraocular pressure is discussed.", 
    "4": "Fluoroprostacyclin (10,10-difluoro-13,14-dehydroprostacyclin) a stable analogue of PGI2, induced an increase of contractile tension and a positive chronotropic effect on spontaneously beating guinea-pig atria. The increase in contractile tension was proportional to the dose (10(-8) to 2.5 X 10(-7) M) and never exceeded 40% of absolute initial controls. The chronotropic positive effect was low (12 +/- 4%) and not dose-dependent. The positive inotropic effect was also evident on electrically driven atria and was greater at the slower rates of stimulation. Atria from guinea pigs pretreated with reserpine were still sensitive to fluoroprostacyclin, although to a lower degree. The use of appropriate agonists and antagonists excluded the possibility that beta and alpha receptors are involved in the positive inotropic effect of fluoroprostacyclin. PGI2 showed the same behavior as fluoro-PGI2. Prostacyclins were able to reverse the decrease of contractility induced by verapamil, nifedipine, tetrodotoxin and xylocaine. But the reversal by PGI2 was no longer evident when the atrial contractility was completely abolished by the presence of these drugs in high concentrations. The inotropic effect of prostacyclins was more evident when Ca2+ was reduced in the medium. These results demonstrate that the cardiostimulant effect of prostacyclins is not simply adrenergic in origin. A direct effect on ion movements, mainly dependent on Ca2+ transmembranes fluxes, may be largely responsible for their positive inotropic effect.", 
    "5": "The effects of bufetolol (27.8-138.9 mumol/l), bunitrolol (70.2-351.1 mumol/l), bupranolol (16.2-100 mumol/l), carteolol (60.7-607 mumol/l), D32 (17.3-100 mumol/l), penbutolol (1.5-29.4 mumol/l) and timolol (115.5 and 231.2 mumol/l) on action potentials were investigated in isolated guinea-pig papillary muscles. All these beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents of teritary butyl aminopropranol derivatives produced a concentration-dependent reduction of Vmax at driving rates of 1 Hz, 0.027 Hz and 4 Hz. The reduction was frequency-dependent but at all the rates penbutolol was highest in potency, as estimated by ED30 (0.027 Hz) and ED 50 values (1 and 4 Hz), followed by bupranolol, D-32, bufetolol and bunitrolol. These were followed in turn by timolol and carteolol in ED30 at 0.027 Hz and ED50 at 1 Hz, but by carteolol and timolol in ED50 at 4 Hz. Each log (1/ED) value is a linear function of log n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log P). The slope and intercept (the value at log P = 0) of the line of log (1/ED50) at 4 Hz are steeper and higher, respectively, than those of the lines at the other frequencies. The time course of recovery of Vmax during diastole was studied by assessing Vmax in premature responses at 0.027 Hz, being approximated by a single exponential function. The time constants of recovery (tau) and intercepts (Ao: the value extrapolated to the time of APD90 of the conditioning responses) at the level of ED50 and at 100 mumol/l of the drugs were thus estimated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "The relevance of the steric configuration to the effects of two non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (+)- and (--)-bupranolol (10 and 50 micrograms/kg i.v.) and (4)- and (--)-propranolol (100 and 500 micrograms/kg i.v.) on the i.v. glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) were investigated in conscious, normoglycemic dogs. The effects of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on plasma glucose, and insulin levels and insulin-glucagon ratio following IVGTT were evaluated by calculating the respective areas under the curve (AUC). The AUC values for plasma glucose were significantly increased by the (--)-configuration of both beta-adrenoceptor increased by the (--)-configuration of both beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. In the (+)-configuration only propranolol (500 micrograms/kg i.v.) increased the AUC value for plasma glucose significantly. The AUC values for plasma insulin and also for the plasma insulin-glucagon ratio were significantly increased by (--)-propranolol (500 micrograms/kg i.v.) and by (--)-bupranolol (10 and 50 micrograms/kg i.v.). Thus the impairment of glucose tolerance, due to suppression of the plasma insulin level, depends mainly on the beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity of the (--)-configuration.", 
    "7": "Whole-body (WB) and hindlimb [(HL), paw excluded] O2 uptake (VO2) were measured in 26 anesthetized paralyzed dogs while they were ventilated with 9% O2-91% N2 for 15- and 30-min periods and with room air during recovery periods. Ten of the dogs were pretreated with 1 mg/kg propranolol (beta-Blockade). O2 deficit during hypoxia and the excess O2 used during recovery were obtained by assuming that VO2 would have followed the time course described by a line connecting prehypoxic and postrecovery VO2. Amounts of O2 deficit and excess were corrected for changes in O2 stores. O2 excess was seldom as great as O2 deficit in either WB or HL and the two quantities were not obviously related. The rate of HL O2 deficit accumulation decreased with time in hypoxia, whereas WB O2 deficit remained constant. All of HL VO2 was attributed to skeletal muscle so that WB O2 deficit and excess could be partitioned into muscle and nonmuscle portions. The rate of nonmuscle O2 deficit accumulation increased with time, but the nonmuscle portion of O2 excess decreased after the longer hypoxic period. beta-Blockade accentuated but did not change these qualitative relationships. We concluded that neither WB nor HL O2 deficits were fully matched by O2 excess and that regional patterns of O2 deficit accumulation and \"repayment\" did not necessarily parallel those for WB.", 
    "8": "The patient's age has great impact on the development of hypertension, its duration, and severity. In patients with essential hypertension, sympathetic cardiovascular control changes from an early phase with increased beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses, e.g., cardiac output and renin, into a later phase where these responses are blunted and alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction prevails, associated with higher intracellular free sodium and calcium concentration. This pathophysiological view of essential hypertension has its corollary in the pharmacotherapeutic approach. Younger patients, who often have high renin levels, respond better to monotherapy with a beta-blocker or with a converting-enzyme inhibitor. Older patients, who often have low renin levels, respond less well to beta-blockers but particularly well to calcium entry blockers as an alternative to diuretics. Therefore, beta-blockers and calcium entry blockers form new cornerstones for antihypertensive treatment and strategy, with the potential of cardioprotection.", 
    "9": "This overview is concerned with the causes of nonresponsiveness to the hypotensive action of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. The overall hemodynamic response, i.e., a secondary decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, is unrelated to the primary decrease in cardiac output. The reduction in vascular resistance may be triggered by mechanisms residing in the central nervous system, the arterial baroreceptor area, or the prejunctional beta-receptor. None of these mechanisms seem to be entirely responsible. Studies in responders vs nonresponders tend to equate nonresponsiveness with alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction. Although circulating catecholamines are relatively poor indices of sympathetic activity, studies focusing on the renal-neural area appear to show clearly differential profiles between responders and nonresponders. Such findings, in relation to experimental data on the renal nerves as selective neural amplifiers, may provide a renewed interpretation of the centrally mediated hypotensive mechanism of beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "10": "Several drugs used for standard antihypertensive therapy may also interact with the lipoprotein metabolism. The following has been observed after 1 to 12 months of treatment. Various thiazide-type diuretics may significantly increase the potentially atherogenic serum low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and/or very-LDL-C-fractions, while the antiatherogenic high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is largely unchanged. Certain loop-diuretics also increase the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio and both types of diuretics elevated serum triglycerides (Tg) in some but not all studies. LDL-C was increased in diuretic-treated men and in chlorthalidone-treated postmenopausal women, but not in chlorthalidone-treated premenopausal women. The latter may be protected from this effect. Only two diuretics evaluated, namely indapamide and spironolactone, had no apparent influence on lipoproteins. Beta-blocker monotherapy may often increase Tg and slightly decrease HDL-C. The magnitude of these changes did not distinctly differ between highly cardioselective and nonselective beta-blockers, but it was less pronounced on beta-blockers than on those without intrinsic sympatholytic activity. Other sympatholytics such as reserpine, methyldopa, clonidine, debrisoquine, the alpha-beta-blocker labetalol, or the postsynaptic alpha-blocker, prazosin, did not affect or even slightly decrease Tg or total C, LDL-C, and very-LDL-C values. With combinations, a tendency for increased Tg and lower HDL-C was also apparent during thiazide-type diuretic-beta-blocker therapy. However, diuretic-induced increases in LDL-C were prevented or reversed by concomitant beta-blockade, but not by reserpine, methyldopa, or clonidine. Monotherapy with the potent direct vasodilator, carprazidil, improved blood pressure and significantly increased HDL-C. Prospective long-term studies are needed to clarify the course and the pathogenic and prognostic relevance of lipoprotein changes induced by certain diuretics or beta-blockers.", 
    "11": "It has been shown in experiments on 81 guinea-pigs that variation of the functional status of alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors produces a substantial effect on marked serotonin bronchospasm. The blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors with obsidan (1--2 mg/kg) increases the spasm of bronchial smooth muscles in response to serotonin (10 micrograms/kg). The alpha-adrenolytic phentolamine (2 mg/kg) and the myotropic spasmolytic euphylline (8 mg/kg) remove the hypersensitivity of the bronchi to serotonin 20 min after adrenaline administration and potentiate its protective effect in serotonin bronchospasm after administering the beta-adrenoblocker obsidan.", 
    "12": "The influence of catinon on visual differentiation was studied in cat experiments by the methods of conditioned avoidance. It turned out that catinon (1 mg/kg) worsened the differentiation of both short and prolonged visual stimuli. These effects of catinon were potentiated when the serotoninergic system was activated and were weakened when the dopaminergic system was activated.", 
    "13": "The effect of vasodilation (with nifedipine) or beta-adrenergic receptor blockade (with propranolol, alprenolol or metoprolol) on the rate of rise of oxygen uptake and heart rate were studied in 14 healthy subjects after a step-wise increase of workload from a light to a moderate exercise intensity. Under beta-adrenergic receptor blockade steady state oxygen uptake at both workload levels was equal to control values; heart rate went up to 111 min-1 (s.d.:15) vs 150 min-1 (s.d.:24) for the control experiments. The half-times of the oxygen uptake transient were unchanged. After vasodilation with nifedipine heart rates were higher (20% for the lower and 12% for the higher exercise level) but steady state oxygen uptake levels and rate of rise were also unchanged. It is concluded that the rate of rise of oxygen supply to working skeletal muscles after a stepwise increase of load is not reduced either by a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drug nor by a vasodilating agent. Discomfort during exercise appears to be a subjective phenomenon related to reduced skin circulation and sweating under beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, or to headache and congestion after vasodilatory drug administration. These side-effects are not caused by a reduced oxygen supply of muscle, neither under steady state situations nor under rapid changing workload conditions.", 
    "14": "In order to investigate the presence of alpha-adrenergic receptors in human thyroid, we have studied the effect of alpha-adrenergic agonists and antagonists on cGMP cellular content of human thyroid cells in primary culture. Epinephrine as well as TSH were not able to modify the cGMP cellular levels, while norepinephrine significantly increased cGMP accumulation already at 10 nM, a dose inactive on cAMP accumulation. A non selective alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, significantly inhibited cGMP accumulation induced by norepinephrine. Norepinephrine-induced cGMP accumulation was unaffected by prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, but was abolished by yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist. Phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, produced an increase of cellular cGMP levels without modifying cAMP content. In the presence of TSH, the cGMP response to norepinephrine was not modified; however, the increase of cAMP levels was inhibited by norepinephrine at doses inactive on cAMP accumulation, but active on cGMP levels. The present results demonstrate the existence in human thyroid cells of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, regulating the guanylate cyclase system. It may be postulated that the counter-regulation exerted by alpha-adrenergic agonists on the response to TSH operates on the TSH-dependent adenylate cyclase.", 
    "15": "The effects of two different beta-receptor blocking agents, beta 1-selective metoprolol (150 mg/day) and non-selective propranolol (120 mg/day), on hormonal responses to physical exercise (30 min bicycle ergometer test) were compared with placebo within a double-blind, cross-over design in 7 healthy male volunteers. Plasma prolactin levels decreased from the initial values during and after exercise during treatments with placebo and beta-receptor blocking agents, but they were constantly higher with the two beta-blocking agents than with placebo. Exercise did not affect plasma testosterone levels, but during propranolol they remained higher than during placebo and metoprolol. The plasma LH and FSH levels were not affected by exercise, nor were they significantly modified by beta-blockade. The results of this study as well as those of previous studies indicate that beta-receptor blocking agents interfere with physiological endocrine functions and that the non-selective agents may have more distinct effects in this respect.", 
    "16": "The binding of chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine, perphenazine, desipramine, propranolol and salicylic acid to human plasma and isolated plasma proteins was studied using equilibrium dialysis. Unlike salicylic acid, an acidic compound only bound to human serum albumin, the basic drugs were bound to all plasma protein fractions studied (albumin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, lipoproteins, gamma-globulins) with alpha 1-acid glycoprotein an important binding protein for each of them. The interaction of chloropromazine, perphenazine and trifluoperazine with alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was studied using Scatchard analysis. The primary class of binding sites revealed a low capacity (n = 0.5-1) and a high affinity (K = 10(5)-10(6) M-1) for the phenothiazines. The interaction of chlorpromazine, perphenazine and trifluoperazine with albumin was of the high capacity-low affinity type. In binding studies using plasma obtained from healthy volunteers, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was found to be a very important binding protein for the basic drug studied with the exception of desipramine. This shows that results derived from binding studies using isolated protein fractions should be interpreted with caution.", 
    "17": "The beta-adrenergic stimulation of adenylate cyclase in membranes from human auricles, ventricles, and fetal heart was compared with the binding properties of beta-adrenergic receptors in human auricles. In terms of adenylate cyclase activation, three full agonists (isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine), four partial agonists (procaterol, salbutamol, fenoterol, and zinterol), and four antagonists (propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol, and practolol) were tested. The beta-adrenergic activation of adenylate cyclase in membranes from rat heart (with a majority of beta 1-adrenergic receptors), rat erythrocytes, and rat reticulocytes (with a homogeneous population of beta 2-adrenergic receptors) served as reference. The reactivity of human heart adenylate cyclase, estimated by the Kact or Ki values of 11 beta-adrenergic agents, indicated that the activation of this enzyme occurred through receptors of the beta 2-subtype only. Receptors of the beta 1-subtype (50% of the total population) were not coupled to the enzyme.", 
    "18": "Beta-adrenergic receptors were characterized in a particulate fraction of human auricles obtained from patients operated upon for coronary insufficiency or valvular disease. [125I] Hydroxybenzylpindolol binding was evaluated in terms of kinetics; KD and Bmax values; and inhibition of binding in the presence of 10 microM GTP and of increasing concentrations of four nonselective agonists giving a Hill coefficient of 1 (isoproterenol, salbutamol, fenoterol, and epinephrine), of two nonselective antagonists giving a Hill coefficient of 1 (pindolol and propranolol), and of a series of selective drugs giving a Hill coefficient of 0.60-0.72 that included three beta 1-selective antagonists (practolol, metoprolol, and atenolol) and two beta 2- selective agonists (procaterol and zinterol). KD values for all drugs were compatible with the coexistence in membranes from human auricles of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors, the relative proportions of receptors of each subclass being approximately the same.", 
    "19": "The role of beta-adrenergically mediated sympathetic nervous activity in the regulation of glucose-induced thermogenesis was examined in healthy male subjects. Respiratory gas exchange was measured continuously, using the ventilated hood technique, under conditions of hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia (glucose clamp technique, insulin infusion 1 mU/kg per min, glucose levels 125 mg/dl above basal) before and after beta-adrenergic blockade (i.v. propranolol, 3-mg bolus plus 0.1 mg/min for 2 h). After 2 h of insulin and glucose infusion in series 1, glucose uptake had increased to 23.5 +/- 2.3 mg/kg per min and insulin concentration to 199 +/- 21 microU/ml. Simultaneously, the energy expenditure had risen by 0.39 +/- 0.05 kcal/min above basal. After propranolol administration, glucose uptake did not change, while energy expenditure fell significantly, to a level 0.28 +/- 0.04 kcal/min above basal. The glucose-induced thermogenesis (GIT) was 6.5 +/- 0.3% before and 4.6 +/- 0.5% (P less than 0.02) after propranolol. In series 2, insulin and glucose infusion was continued for 4 h without propranolol administration. Glucose uptake rose (+12%) and insulin levels increased (+40%) between the 2nd and 4th h but energy expenditure and GIT remained unchanged. Subjects in series 3 received saline infusion alone for 3 h, at which time propranolol administration as in series 1 was added during a further 2-h period. No changes in energy expenditure were seen during saline or propranolol infusion. These data demonstrate the presence of a beta-adrenergically mediated sympathetic nervous component in glucose-induced thermogenesis in healthy human subjects. This factor may be of importance in the regulation of normal body weight in man.", 
    "20": "Reperfusion of ischemic myocardium is associated with increases in total myocardial calcium (Ca+2), which may influence the ultimate extent of ischemic damage as well as the development of arrhythmias. Since reperfusion is also associated with enhanced alpha-adrenergic responsivity, this study was performed to determine the potential interactions between alpha-adrenergic receptors and myocardial calcium during reperfusion. Cats were subjected to 35 min of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and 10 min of reperfusion. Total myocardial calcium was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. Intracellular calcium was calculated from measurements of extracellular space [( 3H]inulin). In control animals with reperfusion, total calcium increased from 0.32 +/- 0.03 to 0.65 +/- 0.05 mmol/100 g dry tissue (P less than 0.0001), while intracellular calcium increased from 0.15 +/- 0.03 to 0.40 +/- 0.05 mmol/100 g dry tissue (P less than 0.001). Pretreatment with the alpha-adrenergic blocking agents phentolamine or prazosin prevented the increase in total and intracellular calcium. Phentolamine and the aqueous soluble alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist BE-2254 administered as late as 2 min before reperfusion similarly attenuated the increase in tissue calcium. Although administration of BE-2254 2 min before reperfusion failed to block the reperfusion-induced increase in extracellular space, the increase in calculated intracellular calcium was prevented. beta-Adrenergic blockade with propranolol partially attenuated but did not prevent an increase in total tissue calcium. Labetalol, a combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agent completely blocked the increase in tissue calcium during reperfusion. Additional experiments performed after 70 min of ischemia with reperfusion demonstrated a 49% attenuation of the increase in tissue calcium with alpha-adrenergic blockade. Electron microscopy with pyroantimonate and x-ray microprobe analysis demonstrated a large increase in calcium precipitate in mitochondria after reperfusion in untreated animals. Though alpha-adrenergic blockade prevented the calcium deposition in mitochondria, other criteria of ischemia persisted. Thus, alpha-adrenergic blockade specifically prevents the increase in intracellular calcium during reperfusion in reversibly injured tissue, independent of alterations in extracellular space and tissue water.", 
    "21": "Because it has been shown that high doses of propranolol (40 to 80 mg orally, four times daily) markedly attenuate cardiovascular response to exercise training in healthy subjects, the effects of lower doses of this nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist on the conditioning response were investigated. Twelve normal men underwent maximal treadmill testing before and after a 6 week intensive exercise program. After an initial test, six men were randomized in a paired fashion to receive low dose propranolol and the others received no drug. The average propranolol dose +/- standard error was 22 +/- 4 mg four times daily, and the average decrease in maximal heart rate due to propranolol was 32 +/- 4 beats/min. Both groups trained at comparable intensities. At the end of the training period, propranolol was stopped and testing was repeated so that the effect of beta-receptor blockade was no longer present but the training effects still persisted. Maximal oxygen consumption increased in control subjects from 47.5 +/- 1.1 to 51.4 +/- 0.4 ml/kg per min (p less than 0.05) but was unchanged in those receiving propranolol (47.2 +/- 1.9 versus 47.4 +/- 1.5). Exercise duration increased in both groups but the increment was greater in the control group (+2.4 versus +1.1 min, p less than 0.05). It is concluded that low level beta-receptor blockade attenuates cardiovascular conditioning in normal subjects in exercise training programs. High levels of sympathetic stimulation during training appear to be important, if not essential, to the conditioning process.", 
    "22": "The effects of the calcium-entry blocking agent nifedipine on the activation of human platelets by various agonists has been studied and compared with verapamil. Like verapamil, nifedipine inhibited platelet aggregation and secretion caused by collagen, the second phase of ADP-induced aggregation, and aggregation caused by the ionophore A23187. Both agents inhibited the formation of TXB2 from endogenous arachidonate, whereas only nifedipine inhibited platelet aggregation and decreased TXB2 formation caused by exogenous arachidonate without inhibiting uptake. These results indicate that both calcium-blocking agents may be inhibiting the release of arachidonate in platelets by phospholipases, and that nifedipine also inhibits the formation and action of thromboxane A2 in platelets. Epinephrine-induced aggregation was inhibited by low concentrations of verapamil while nifedipine only inhibited aggregation by epinephrine at much higher concentrations. It is suggested that low concentrations of verapamil inhibit epinephrine-induced aggregation by interacting with platelet alpha-adrenergic receptors, and that higher concentrations of both calcium-blocking agents inhibit platelet responses to other aggregating agents by preventing intracellular calcium mobilization.", 
    "23": "The growth hormone (GH) reserve of 75 short probands (age 1.9 to 23.8 years) was evaluated on the basis of oral L-dopa (300 mg/m2) and propranolol (0.75 mg/kg) administration. The GH response was normal in 21 probands (20.9 +/- 1.24 ng/ml; means +/- SEM) and was found to be higher than the response to the insulin or arginine test. 39 patients failed to respond (less than 6 ng/ml) and were diagnosed as GH deficient. In 15 cases an \"intermediate\" response (greater than 6 less than 12 ng/ml) was found and in these patients partial GH deficiency was assumed. There was not a single false positive result with this test, which cannot be said for any of the other commonly-used stimulation tests. In two children hypoglycaemic blood glucose levels were observed during the test, whilst in one case loss of consciousness and convulsions were seen. In four patients the test had to be interrupted because of side effects. These children had the following findings in common: GH deficiency was confirmed and the patients were still very young and basal blood glucose levels were relatively low at the beginning of the test. The L-dopa-propranolol test is an effective and reliable GH stimulation test, but severe side effects may occur.", 
    "24": "The release of Ca2+ from the terminal cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle fiber triggers muscle contraction. The signal for Ca2+ release is mediated via the triad junction, i.e. the junctional association of terminal cisternae and transverse tubule. Recently, highly purified morphologically intact triads were isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle (Mitchell, R. D., Palade, P., and Fleischer, S. (1983) J. Cell Biol. 96, 1008-1016). In this study, biochemical characterization of two variants of purified triad preparations (Pyrophosphate and Standard) is provided. Terminal cisternae of triads sequester Ca2+ at rates comparable to those of purified heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum which is referable to terminal cisternae (Meissner, G. (1975) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 389, 51-68). The permeability for calcium ions, as reflected by a 2-3-fold stimulation of (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase activity in the presence of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, and by the Ca2+ leak rate, is comparable in triads and heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum. Several transverse tubule characteristics are present in triads. Four of them, i.e. cholesterol content, ouabain binding, dihydroalprenolol binding (beta-adrenergic receptor), and ouabain-sensitive (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity, are comparably enriched in the Pyrophosphate triads and therefore appear to be quantitative indices of the amount of transverse tubule. Adenylate cyclase and basal ATPase are unreliable in this regard. Methodology for analyzing membrane integrity and sidedness was applied (adenylate cyclase activity) and modified (ouabain-sensitive (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity) to characterize the transverse tubule of the triad. In addition, a new method was developed making use of ouabain binding to study sidedness. These studies show that the transverse tubule is largely sealed and inside out in orientation, i.e. with the cytoplasmic face exposed. This report indicates that the t-tubule and sarcoplasmic reticulum components of the triads possess transport capability and retain permeability barriers for ions. Therefore, the isolated triads appear to be suitable for studying the physiological Ca2+ release process in vitro.", 
    "25": "When a rat is shocked via a prod in a chamber with sawdust on the floor it will typically push the flooring material with snout and forepaws towards and over the prod. We administered diazepam (.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) and oxprenolol (10 and 20 mg/kg) the day following shock exposure, and observed the complete suppression of burying by diazepam, and some suppression with oxprenolol. These effects are independent of interference with initial association of shock and prod, and of changes in general activity.", 
    "26": "In this paper, (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) binding, cyclic AMP (cAMP) and free fatty acid (FFA) accumulations of fat cells from both the genetically obese Zucker fatty rats and Wistar rats were studied for the purpose of recognizing the characteristics of lipolytic activities in the obese animals. In the experiments of [3H]DHA binding on intact fat cells, it was revealed that some of [3H]DHA bindings had properties of a beta-adrenergic receptor, while the others had those of a non-beta-receptor, the latter showing the lack of stereospecificity and the failure to compete in a potent manner against beta-adrenergic agonist. This concentration of phentolamine displayed no apparent effect on the ability of isoproterenol to stimulate cAMP accumulation in the fat cells. However, even in the presence of 10(-4)M phentolamine, non-beta-receptor binding was observed by increasing the concentration of [3H]DHA to higher than 10(-9)M. Accordingly, the experimental conditions of [3H]DHA binding were as follows: 3 approximately 15 x 10(4) fat cells preincubated with 10(-4)M phentolamine for 5 min were incubated for 12 min in modified Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (KRP, pH 7.4, 37 degrees C), at a final volume of 1 ml containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 3 x 10(-10)M [3H]DHA and competitors. The content of the tube were then rapidly filtered under vacuum through a single Whatman GF/C filter (pore size 1.2 micrometers). Computer-analysis of the resulting inhibition curve provided total binding, slope factor, half-maximally inhibitory concentration and non-specific binding. In this condition, [3H]DHA binding on intact fat cells showed the stereospecificity and the equilibrium dissociation constant of (-)- and (+)-propranolol, (-)-alprenolol and (-)-isoproterenol approximate to those expected from the biological activities, displaying properties consistent with those of a beta-adrenergic receptor. cAMP and FFA were determined in cell plus medium after incubation for 5 and 30 min, respectively. The data obtained from the [3H]DHA binding studies and cAMP measurements indicate that the equilibrium dissociation constant, maximal binding and isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulations per 10(6) cells did not differ significantly between the Zucker fatty rats and Wistar rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "27": "The converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) is known to inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. In order to analyse the regulatory mechanisms involved in aldosterone secretion independent of renin-angiotensin system, one of the CEIs, SQ 14,225 was infused to the dogs in association with several pharmacological agents. To the mongrel dogs under pentobarbital anesthesia, SQ 14,225 was administered intravenously as a bolus injection (0.5 mg/kg), followed by two hour infusion (0.5 mg/kg/hr). The effects of several pharmacological agents on plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone concentration (PA) were examined in the condition in which endogenous angiotensin II production was blocked by CEI. PRA was increased significantly from the basal level (6.4 +/- 1.2; mean +/- SEM) to 14.1 +/- 2.6 ng/ml/hr 60 min after the administration of SQ 14,225. PA, on the other hand, was decreased from 12.2 +/- 3.6 to 7.6 +/- 2.2 ng/dl. The CEI-induced increase in PRA was completely blocked by infusion of angiotensin II (40 ng/kg/min), physiological saline (0.25 approximately 0.44 ml/kg/min), pretreatment of propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) or norepinephrine (200 ng/kg/min). Both pindolol and indomethacin had no significant effect on the CEI-induced increase in PRA. Increase in PRA was also observed by the infusion of furosemide, prostaglandin 1 or E1. PA was increased by KCl infusion (1.0 mEq/kg/hr), but was not affected significantly by the administration of furosemide, pindolol, prostaglandin A1 or E1, during the SQ 14,225 infusion. An elevation of PRA observed under the converting enzyme inhibition, was considered to be due to decreased feedback inhibition as a result of reduction of angiotensin II formation. It was suggested from the present results, that the CEI-induced increase in PRA might be mediated by beta-receptor and baroreceptor in addition to the direct negative feedback by angiotensin II. The present data also suggested that both furosemide and prostaglandins stimulated aldosterone secretion via the renin-angiotensin system, rather than by acting directly on the adrenal cortex.", 
    "28": "The purpose of the present study was to determine if propranolol withdrawal supersensitivity could be demonstrated under in vitro conditions. Rats pretreated for 14 days with propranolol were studied 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after propranolol withdrawal. Right atria, right ventricle strips and thoracic aortic strips were isolated for study under in vitro conditions. Dose-response curves and geometric mean ED50 values revealed the presence of supersensitivity to the chronotropic and inotropic effects of isoproterenol in vitro at 72 and 96 h after withdrawal. No change in sensitivity was found 24 or 48 h after propranolol cessation. In like manner, supersensitivity to the vasorelaxant action of isoproterenol was demonstrated in aortic strips precontracted with angiotensin II at 72 and 96 h after propranolol withdrawal. In contrast, subsensitivity to the contractile actions of methoxamine was observed 48 h after withdrawal. These data indicate that chronic propranolol pretreatment and withdrawal results in the unmasking of supersensitivity to both beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptor stimulation. There would also appear to be a compensatory change in alpha-adrenoceptor-induced responses in rat aorta following propranolol withdrawal.", 
    "29": "We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of aspirin treatment (324 mg in buffered solution daily) for 12 weeks in 1266 men with unstable angina (625 taking aspirin and 641 placebo). The principal end points were death and acute myocardial infarction diagnosed by the presence of creatine kinase MB or pathologic Q-wave changes on electrocardiograms. The incidence of death or acute myocardial infarction was 51 per cent lower in the aspirin group than in the placebo group: 31 patients (5.0 per cent) as compared with 65 (10.1 per cent); P = 0.0005. Nonfatal acute myocardial infarction was 51 per cent lower in the aspirin group: 21 patients (3.4 per cent) as compared with 44 (6.9 per cent); P = 0.005. The reduction in mortality in the aspirin group was also 51 per cent--10 patients (1.6 per cent) as compared with 21 (3.3 per cent)--although it was not statistically significant; P = 0.054. There was no difference in gastrointestinal symptoms or evidence of blood loss between the treatment and control groups. Our data show that aspirin has a protective effect against acute myocardial infarction in men with unstable angina, and they suggest a similar effect on mortality.", 
    "30": "It is reported on the behaviour of blood pressure and heart rate at rest as well as on the peripheral microcirculation of the working musculature after physical conditioning in older patients with essential arterial hypertension (stage I and II). The patients with hypertension conditioned in 4 groups (twice a week swimming or once a week swimming and run each with and without propranolol) showed systolic and diastolic decrease of blood pressure with the exception of some patients. The heart rate at rest was significantly reduced only in the groups with swimming twice a week with and without beta-blockers. By means of the xenon-133-half-life period with the exception of the run-swimming group in all groups could be proved significant improvements of the peripheral microcirculation after the therapy, in contrast to the time before therapy. Value and limits of the training treatment described for the influence on the factor of risk arterial hypertension at old age are discussed.", 
    "31": "Adrenergic mechanisms may be important in the symptomatic manifestations of hyperthyroidism. The chronic administration of thyroid hormone also results in cardiac hypertrophy and increased numbers of beta-adrenergic receptors in cardiac membranes. The roles of adrenergic mechanisms in the initiation and perpetuation of this hypertrophy has been open to speculation. Rats treated chronically with L-thyroxin were sacrificed after 7 days of treatment and 1-4 days after cessation of treatment. Hearts were removed and weighed and norepinephrine measured. In other groups of identically treated rats, membranes were prepared from the left ventricle for in vitro measurements of beta-adrenergic receptor characteristics and adenyl cyclase activity. Regression of cardiac hypertrophy with a decrease in receptor number to control values was seen as early as 2 days after stopping thyroxine. Cardiac norepinephrine concentrations had also returned to control values at this time. Displacement of bound [H3] dihydroalprenolol by isoproterenol was not changed from control. Basal and isoproterenol stimulated adenyl cyclase activity was not changed by thyroxine administration or its cessation. The rapid reversal of the increased beta-adrenergic receptor number and cardiac hypertrophy raises the possibility that thyroid hormone may play a regulatory role in cardiac function. Although the enhancement of myocardial contractility by thyroid hormone may be mediated through cardiac hypertrophy this effect of thyroid hormone is independent of the catecholamine sensitive adenyl cyclase system.", 
    "32": "Prazosin (Minipress; Pfizer), the first purely alpha-blocking antihypertensive agent, was used to treat 22 pregnant patients with moderately severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressure persistently above 95 mmHg at gestational ages ranging from 18 to 33 weeks). Prazosin was used because it is a postsynaptic alpha-blocking agent producing no direct tachycardia or renin stimulation and because its action in producing visceral vasodilation might improve uteroplacental perfusion. Oxprenolol (Trasicor; Ciba), a beta-blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, was added to the prazosin regimen in 12 cases. In this group pregnancy was prolonged for an average of 32 days and 10 infants survived the neonatal period. Fetal loss, mainly due to abortion, was high in the patients who had significant proteinuria, and it was not possible to prolong the pregnancy in these cases. There were no significant maternal, fetal or neonatal side-effects attributable to this combined alpha- and beta-blocking therapy, which may have both theoretical and practical advantages over other current therapies.", 
    "33": "The beta-adrenergic agonist 1-isoproterenol evokes an acute (less than 5 min) stimulation of endocytosis, hexose transport and amino acid transport, measured by the temperature-sensitive uptake of HRP, 3H-DG and 14C-AIB, in mouse kidney cortex slices. This stimulation is concentration dependent and is maximal at 10(-8)-10(-7) M isoproterenol. Peroxidase cytochemistry showed that the hormonal increase in HRP uptake is confined to proximal tubules. The rapid membrane response is abolished in a calcium-free medium and by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, indicating Ca2+- and beta-adrenoreceptor-dependence. Isoproterenol (1 microM) rapidly (less than 30 sec) stimulates the influx and efflux of 45Ca in cortex slices. Isoproterenol also decreased mitochondrial 45Ca and increased soluble 45Ca. These results indicate that beta-adrenergic stimulation of membrane transport functions involves an increased influx of extracellular calcium and a mobilization of intracellular (mitochondrial) calcium. An increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration appears to be the regulatory signal for these membrane transport processes.", 
    "34": "The contractile response of the isolated guinea-pig ileum to cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) that remained in the presence of atropine was greatly inhibited by the substance P antagonist D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9-substance P. This indicates that the atropine-resistant contraction to CCK-8 is mediated by the release of substance P from enteric neurones. Activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by noradrenaline, clonidine or mesenteric sympathetic nerve stimulation inhibited the atropine-resistant contraction to CCK-8 but did not affect the contractile effect of substance P. It is concluded that alpha-adrenergic receptors exert an inhibitory influence on the release of substance P from enteric neurones.", 
    "35": "In order to measure the effect of a decrease in afterload on systolic time intervals, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, and left ventricular wall stress, eight healthy young persons underwent a randomised placebo controlled trial of terbutaline before and during atenolol treatment. Pre-ejection period index, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, and wall stress all decreased after terbutaline, the decrease being clearly dose dependent. This was identical before and during atenolol administration. Consequently the observed changes were induced by beta-2 elicited vasodilatation, possibly combined with some decrease of parasympathetic tone. A close correlation between changes in pre-ejection period index (PEPI) and changes in left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD) and wall stress was shown both before and during atenolol treatment. When using non-invasive methods in the evaluation of changes in contractility, it is important to correct for changes in preload and afterload. For normal subjects it is suggested that the relation between delta PEPI and delta LVESD as a percentage of the mean values should be used for evaluation of afterload changes. A method is suggested for estimating changes in pre-ejection period index induced by changes in left ventricular end-systolic diameter or wall stress.", 
    "36": "The aim of the study was to determine the effects of chronic volume overload on the inotropic response of the left ventricle to a change in frequency of stimulation. Ten normal dogs (normal) and eight dogs with a chronic left ventricular (LV) volume overload (aortocaval fistula) were studied by cardiac catheterization after sedation with morphine (1 mg/kg). In normal dogs, increasing heart rate from 122 to 172 beats/min produced insignificant changes in peak +dP/dt (+2%; NS) or (dP/dt)/DP40 (+6%; NS). In volume overload, these indexes increased by 16% (P less than 0.01) and 31% (P less than 0.01), respectively, when heart rate increased from 135 to 173 beats/min. Conversely, the poststimulation potentiation appeared greater in normal than in volume overload; (dP/dt)/DP40 increased by 40% in normal vs. 1% in volume overload (P less than 0.01). These differences between normal and volume overload persisted after propranolol (1 mg/kg) and atropine (0.25 mg) administration. In both groups, AR-L115 BS, a nonsympathomimetic positive inotrope with caffeinelike properties, reduced the inotropic response to tachycardia, thereby normalizing the peak +dP/dt changes in volume overload. We conclude that the positive inotropic effects of tachycardia are enhanced in LV volume overload. Changes in LV compliance or alterations in the cellular mechanisms responsible for the force-frequency phenomenon might explain these findings.", 
    "37": "Hypertensive patients have an unfavorable pressor response to exogenous epinephrine during nonselective beta-blockade. We studied hemodynamics during epinephrine release induced by handgrip exercise and mental arithmetic to examine the clinical relevance of this phenomenon. Twenty-two hypertensive patients were examined in a double-blind crossover experiment with placebo, propranolol (240 mg daily), placebo-washout, and metoprolol (300 mg daily). Changes induced by stress tests for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and forearm blood flow (FBF) were of the same order on both beta-blockers. Rises in HR and FBF were equally reduced by both drugs. Neither handgrip exercise nor mental arithmetic induced significant differences in reaction during selective and nonselective beta-blockade.", 
    "38": "A diabetic patient experienced a dangerous alteration in hypoglycemic symptoms during treatment with ophthalmic timolol maleate. Before and after timolol therapy, hypoglycemic reactions were characterized by sweating, uneasiness, and prompt resolution with glucose treatment. During timolol therapy, reactions were characterized by a changed mental status (including seizures on occasion) and a relative resistance to glucose treatment. Caution must be exercised in the use of even topically applied beta-adrenergic blockers in diabetic patients who are prone to hypoglycemia.", 
    "39": "We reviewed the exercise thallium-201 (TI-201) scans and clinical data of 41 patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries to identify clinical factors associated with \"false-positive\" studies. Exercise TI-201 studies were performed before angiography and often precipitated referral. Sex, beta-blocker therapy, anginal pattern, and results of exercise electrocardiography were evaluated and compared with TI-201 imaging. A negative TI-201 study was the most common finding (p less than 0.005). Of the 41 patients, 11 (27%) had abnormal exercise TI-201 scans. No clinical factor was significantly associated with a false-positive TI-201 scans. Of the 11 patients with abnormal scans, 9 had greater than or equal to 1 cardiac abnormality: right bundle branch block in 2, mitral valve prolapse in 3, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in 2, abnormal left ventricular diastolic pressure in 3, and left bundle branch block in 1. Thus, (1) when results of exercise TI-201 imaging are used to refer patients for angiography, \"false-positive\" TI-201 studies are common; (2) sex, beta blockade, anginal pattern, and results of exercise electrocardiogram are not useful predictors of a false-positive TI-201 study; and (3) patients with chest pain, normal coronary arteries, and abnormal TI-201 scans frequently have other cardiac abnormalities.", 
    "40": "Whether the results of some drug studies could be used to predict the results of other drug studies was examined during serial electrophysiologic drug testing in patients with sustained atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. The drugs studied were intravenous propranolol, 0.1 mg/kg; intravenous ouabain, 0.01 mg/kg; the combination of propranolol plus ouabain; intravenous procainamide, 0.75 to 1.5 g; oral quinidine, 1.2 to 2.4 g/day; and oral disopyramide, 0.8 to 1.6 g/day. Response was inability to induce sustained tachycardia after administration of a drug. Responses due to increased anterograde limb refractoriness. Six of 10 patients with response to propranolol plus ouabain versus 0 of 9 patients without response to this combination had response to propranolol alone (p less than 0.01). Seven of 14 patients with response to the combination versus 0 of 9 patients without response to the combination had response to ouabain alone (p less than 0.05). Responses due to increased retrograde limb refractoriness. Eight of 9 patients with response to procainamide versus 2 of 17 patients without response to this drug had response to quinidine (p less than 0.01). There was not a significant relation between response to procainamide and response to disopyramide, or between response to quinidine and response to disopyramide. Anterograde limb versus retrograde limb. There was not a significant relation between response to propranolol plus ouabain and response to any class I drug. In conclusion, there are relations between drug responses during electrophysiologic studies in patients with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. Thus, it should be possible to simplify these studies.", 
    "41": "An electrocardiographic-triggered radiographic technique for obtaining a single image of the heart at both end-systole and end-diastole was used in conjunction with upright bicycle exercise to detect stress-induced changes in 1) systolic and diastolic cardiac transverse diameter, and 2) regional motion of the free left ventricular wall. Twenty-one patients were studied; 10 had normal coronary arteries and 11 had significant coronary artery disease. Twenty patients (10 with normal coronary arteries and 10 with coronary artery disease) also had multigated radionuclide blood pool scans at rest and with exercise. All patients without coronary disease showed a decrease in systolic cardiac transverse diameter with exercise and a slight increase in amplitude of motion of the left ventricular free wall. Eight (73%) of the 11 patients with coronary artery disease showed an increase in systolic transverse cardiac diameter with exercise (p less than 0.001), and 5 developed either new regional left ventricular asynergy or deterioration of segments with rest asynergy. Eight of the 10 patients with coronary artery disease who had rest and exercise radionuclide scans had an abnormal ejection fraction response to exercise. However, only 4 of the 10 control patients who had multigated scans had a normal ejection fraction response, although all showed normal regional wall motion with exercise. This new approach is inexpensive and easily performed. These preliminary data suggest that it may be a useful adjunct to cardiac stress testing and is worthy of further study.", 
    "42": "The effect of epinephrine was tested on the proliferation of rat arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC) in secondary cultures. Epinephrine added daily to the culture medium caused a striking stimulation of growth. The effect increased with time and was dose-dependent. Maximal stimulation was observed at a concentration of 10(-5) M and after 72 hours. At higher concentrations (10(-3) M) epinephrine exhibited toxic effects on SMC. When SMC were maintained quiescent by deprivation of serum, the subsequent addition of epinephrine required serum to significantly enhance growth. This growth stimulation increased with serum concentration (from 0.1% to 10%). All the adrenergic agonists tested were found to stimulate SMC growth, with an activity classified by decreasing order as follows: norepinephrine greater than epinephrine greater than isoproterenol. Finally, this mitogenic response of SMC to catecholamines was specific since it could be blocked by adrenergic blocking agents, phentolamine being more efficient than propranolol in that connection. The results suggest that epinephrine and other catecholamines may act as growth factors for aortic SMC, at least in rat, mostly through adrenoreceptors.", 
    "43": "Adrenaline was infused intravenously in nine normal volunteers to plasma concentrations similar to those found after myocardial infarction. This study was undertaken on three occasions after 5 days' treatment with placebo or the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, atenolol or timolol. Adrenaline increased the systolic pressure by 11 mmHg, decreased the diastolic pressure by 14 mmHg, and increased the heart rate by 7 beats/min. These changes were prevented by atenolol. However, after timolol the diastolic pressure rose (+19 mmHg) and heart rate fell (-8 beats/min). Adrenaline caused the corrected QT interval (QTc) to lengthen (0.36 +/- 0.02 s to 0.41 +/- 0.06 s). No significant changes were found in the QTc when subjects were pretreated with atenolol or timolol. The serum potassium fell from 4.06 to 3.22 mmol/l after adrenaline. Serum potassium fell to a lesser extent to 3.67 mmol/l after atenolol and actually increased to 4.25 mmol/l after timolol. Adrenaline-mediated hypokalaemia appears to result from the stimulation of a beta 2-adrenoceptor linked to membrane Na+/K+-ATPase causing potassium influx.", 
    "44": "The effects of dl-propranolol, D-(-)-(4-nitrophenyl)-2-isopropylaminoethanol (INPEA) and L-(+)-INPEA on the hemodynamic and metabolic responses to isoproterenol were investigated in dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital. Isoproterenol (200 micrograms/kg i.p.) was injected 15 min after an i.v. injection of propranolol or INPEA, or their dextro-isomers. Isoproterenol increased heart rate, myocardial contractile force (determined by a strain gauge arch), blood glucose, blood lactate and plasma free fatty acids, and decreased diastolic blood pressure. dl-Propranolol (1 or 3 mg/kg) or D-(-)-INPEA (5 or 15 mg/kg) inhibited all the responses to isoproterenol. d-Propranolol (1 or 3 mg/kg) did not inhibit the isoproterenol-induced responses of heart rate, myocardial contractile force and plasma free fatty acids, but it inhibited the isoproterenol-induced responses of diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose and blood lactate, although the inhibition was small. Similar results were obtained by L-(+)-INPEA; L-(+)-INPEA (5 or 15 mg/kg) did not inhibit the isoproterenol-induced responses of heart rate, myocardial contractile force and plasma free fatty acids, but it inhibited the isoproterenol-induced responses of diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose and blood lactate, although the degree of inhibition was small. These results indicate that dextro-isomers of propranolol and INPEA may have a weak beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonistic action.", 
    "45": "We report the case of a 46-year-old man, in whom A-V node electrophysiologic properties was worsened after therapeutic conjunctival instillation of timolol. We suggest that periodic, careful controls of the AV conduction are warranted in patients taking ocular hypertensive chronic timolol therapy.", 
    "46": "The effect of cathinone on the visual differentiation of cats was investigated by the method of defense conditioned reflexes. It was found that cathinone decreases the differentiation of both the short-term and prolonged visual stimuli. These effects of cathinone increase when the serotoninergic system is activated and decrease under dopaminergic system activation.", 
    "47": "Dipivalyl epinephrine was as effective as adrenaline as an eyedrop for glaucoma. It was responsible for fewer side effects, through side effects did occur. It had an additive effect when used with timolol maleate and, in 12 of 14 patients on long-term medication with both drugs, a rise of pressure of 3 mmHg or more occurred when dipivalyl epinephrine was stopped. As sole therapy dipivalyl epinephrine was effective in chronic simple open-angle glaucoma, ocular hypertension and pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, and may be useful on its own in the latter two conditions. In low-tension glaucoma it seemed the best therapy when combined with timolol. Headache and ocular pain were uncommon but prominent side effects.", 
    "48": "A group of 130 patients with chronic glaucoma has been followed from one to more than three years on timolol maleate drops; this confirms that these drops remain effective in long-term therapy through added therapy is usually needed. Of 54 patients originally controlled by timolol alone or in combination, only four were not controlled more than three years later, though some needed further additional therapy. Of 35 patients followed for two to three years, only six could not be controlled by timolol alone or in combination; and of 41 followed for one to two years, 18 were controlled on timolol alone while 23 needed additional therapy. Attention is drawn to side effects including a mild keratopathy and in particular the occurrence of bronchospasm or other severe respiratory disease in 10 patients, not all of whom had a previous history of respiratory disease. Great care should be exercised with timolol in the presence of present or past respiratory disease as the complication is not generally recognised and it falls to the ophthalmologist to act to stop the drop.", 
    "49": "We have considered the effectiveness of miotics (pilocarpine 2% and ecothiopate iodide (Phospholine Iodide) 0.125 or 0.25%), adrenaline (Eppy/N 1%) or adrenaline precursors (dipivalyl epinephrine or dipivefrin hydrochloride (Propine) 0.1%) and neuronal blockers (timolol maleate (Timoptol) 0.5%) in 165 patients in the clinical situation. All drops were effective in lowering intraocular pressure with an average fall of 6.6 mmHg for timolol (160 eyes), 8.21 mmHg for pilocarpine (79 eyes), 5.77 mmHg for dipivalyl epinephrine (57 eyes), 7.23 mmHg for adrenaline (17 eyes) and 10.5 mmHg for ecothiopate iodide (16 eyes). In chronic simple open-angle glaucoma, ocular hypertension and pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, pilocarpine and timolol were almost equally effective while dipivalyl epinephrine and adrenaline were also effective, but more as additive therapy, though dipivalyl epinephrine may be useful on its own in ocular hypertension. In low-tension glaucoma timolol and dipivalyl epinephrine together seemed best, while in secondary glaucomas all were effective at times, but ecothiopate iodide was best in aphakic glaucoma and fluorometholone (FML Liquifilm) 0.1% was important in inflammatory glaucoma. Side effects were frequent with dipivalyl epinephrine and timolol, with respiratory disease a strong contraindication to timolol.", 
    "50": "The efficacy and safety of an intravenous dose of 40 to 100 mg sotalol was evaluated in fourteen symptomatic patients with ventricular arrhythmias occurring during maximal exercise stress testing. A statistically significant reduction in premature ventricular complexes (PVC's) occurring as singles, doublets and triplets was observed during both exercise (p less than 0.05) and recovery (p less than 0.01). Sotalol plasma levels after administration of 100 mg i.v. ranged from 3.7 to 4.75 micrograms/ml (average 4.2 micrograms/ml). The injected dose was well tolerated in all patients. Neither arrhythmogenic nor adverse effects were observed.", 
    "51": "The release of noradrenaline accompanying positive inotropic and chronotropic actions of isoprenaline and histamine was investigated in rabbit atria in which the transmitter stores were labelled with (2H)-noradrenaline. Propranolol (3 microM) significantly reduced the isoprenaline (1 microM)-induced release of radioactivity and positive inotropic and chronotropic actions. Cimetidine (30 microM) significantly reduced the histamine (25 microM)-induced release of radioactivity and positive inotropic and chronotropic actions. Tetrotoxin (0.9 microM) significantly reduced the release of radioactivity by both isoprenaline and histamine but did not affect the positive inotropic and chronotropic actions of these drugs. The results suggest that conducted action potentials are associated with isoprenaline- and histamine-induced release of noradrenaline and it is possible that the sympathetic nerves are ephaptically stimulated by increased myocardial activity.", 
    "52": "A new instrument, the trabeculectome, and an new surgical method for treating open angle glaucoma is described. The double-edged instrument makes 2 cuts through the trabecular meshwork while being pulled through Schlemm's canal, thus cutting free a strip of the trabecular meshwork and the inner wall of Schlemm's canal. The results of the 21 first operations are presented. The observation time is 9-19 months. The characteristic post-operative pressure pattern is an immediate fall to 10-20 mmHg followed by a period of higher pressures which then converge to the range of 8-16 mmHg with most eyes in the 10-14 mmHg range. Four patients need timolol treatment to obtain this, the remaining 17 have no medication. The therapeutic results and additional observations are discussed with special interest to possible physiological mechanisms.", 
    "53": "It has been documented that activation of the beta 1-adrenergic receptor mechanism is directly related to cardiovascular malformations associated with the heart and great vessels of the embryonic chick. These adrenergic receptors are believed to be present and functional in the innervated and noninnervated embryonic heart at early stages of development. The present study examined the effects of four sympathomimetic cardioactive amines on chick cardiovascular morphogenesis at Hamburger and Hamilton stage 24. Special attention was directed toward understanding dopamine teratogenicity. In order of decreasing potency at the maximum teratogenic dose (dopamine greater than isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine) each drug was found capable of producing aortic arch anomalies of the third, fourth, and sixth aortic arches and ventricular septal defects (VSD). A new specific beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, metoprolol tartrate, was employed in an attempt to lower the incidence of these cardiovascular malformations. Pretreatment with this selective beta 1-blocker profoundly reduced the incidence of malformations within any amine-treated group. These experiments demonstrate that dopamine, as well as the other sympathomimetic amines, is a potent teratogen and most likely produces these cardiovascular malformations by primarily stimulating the beta 1-adrenoreceptor in the embryonic chick.", 
    "54": "Three methods, equilibrium dialysis, ultrafiltration through dialysis bags, and ultrafiltration through ultrafree filters were compared for the determination of propranolol binding in serum. The method of choice was equilibrium dialysis, which gave values for the free fraction which were not significantly different from those obtained by ultrafiltration through the filters. Of the three methods, equilibrium dialysis also had the best precision and required the least sample volume (1 ml). Similar values for the free fraction were also obtained using either 14C- or 3H-radiolabeled propranolol by this method. Investigation of the effect of temperature and pH of serum indicated that small changes in either parameter could result in up to twofold alterations in the free fraction, but changes in propranolol concentrations over the range 10-500 ng/ml had little effect on the free fraction. Using a standardized equilibrium dialysis method (i.e., 4 hr dialysis against isotonic phosphate buffer, at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4), a mean free fraction of 14.7% (range 8.4-23.3) was observed in 34 samples from 21 healthy subjects. This was significantly greater (p less than 0.001) than that (6.8%, range 3.1-12.3) found in nine elderly hospitalized patients with acute disease. The patients also had significantly raised levels of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), which is a major binding protein for propranolol in serum. A significant linear correlation (r = 0.884, p less than 0.02) was found between the binding ratio for propranolol and serum AAG concentrations in these subjects.", 
    "55": "The present study was undertaken to examine whether the suppressing effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of isoproterenol (ISO) on the immobility-reducing action of desipramine (DMI) in the forced swimming test was mediated through the presynaptic noradrenaline (NA) neurons and presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors in rat brain. As in the case of DMI, phenylephrine (i.c.v.) and yohimbine (i.p.) reduced the duration of immobility. The actions of DMI and yohimbine but not that of phenylephrine were diminished and potentiated by i.c.v. administration of ISO and atenolol, respectively. The suppressing effects of ISO were almost completely blocked by the pretreatment with atenolol. On the other hand, clonidine (s.c.) diminished the action of DMI as did ISO, although clonidine had no effect on the duration of immobility when given alone. The suppressing effect of clonidine was antagonized by the pretreatment with yohimbine at a dose which did not affect the duration of immobility, when given alone, nor influenced the action of DMI, whereas the effect of ISO was not affected by the same dose of yohimbine. These results suggest that the suppressing effect of ISO on the immobility-reducing action of DMI in the forced swimming test is mediated through the presynaptic NA neurons, and ISO acts through the presynaptic beta 1- but not alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "56": "The origin of the hypoxia-induced rise in fetal blood glucose concentration in fetal sheep of 124-135 days was investigated. Hypoxia was induced in pregnant sheep and fetuses with chronically implanted vascular catheters by causing the ewes to breathe 9% O2 and 3% CO2 in N2 for 60 min. The rise in fetal plasma glucose caused by a 60% reduction in maternal PaO2 was associated with a 50% fall in plasma insulin concentration. The fall in insulin and rise in glucose was prevented by the alpha-adrenergic blocking agent phentolamine but not by the beta-antagonist propranolol. Turnover of glucose in the fetus under these conditions was measured with [6-3H] and [U-14C] glucose. Hypoxia reduced fetal glucose consumption despite the hyperglycaemia. After 30 min of hypoxia there was no evidence of fetal production of glucose but by 60 min substantial production was evident. The reduced fetal consumption and increased production of glucose was inhibited by phentolamine but not by propranolol. It is concluded that in the fetal sheep hypoxia induced hyperglycaemia is first caused by reduced consumption of glucose and thus fetal glycogen stores are not depleted. If the hypoxia persists fetal blood glucose is elevated further by fetal production of glucose.", 
    "57": "To determine the efficacy of a cardioselective beta blocker in the treatment of atrial ectopy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we administered intravenous metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg) to six patients with atrial ectopic depolarizations (AEDs) and chronic partially reversible airflow limitation (FEV1 = 1.24 +/- 0.21 liter, mean +/- S.E.). Metoprolol reduced the mean frequency of AEDs from 713 +/- 237 per hour to 218 +/- 127 per hour. Furthermore, three of six patients experienced an 85 per cent or greater decrease in AEDs. No changes were observed in FEV1, FVC, or FEF25-75 over the course of the study. These data suggest that intravenous metoprolol is effective in reducing the frequency of AEDs and that it can be administered to patients with COPD without causing an increase in airflow limitation.", 
    "58": "Hypothermic action of neurotropic drugs (Oxotremorine, Nicotine, Isoprenaline, Seduxene) is evaluated by means of suppression of shivering thermogenesis. The action is accounted for by their influence of the brain stem level of the postural muscular tension regulation rather than by selective action of these drugs on the hypothalamic thermoregulatory centre.", 
    "59": "Norepinephrine (NE) contained in liposomes increased myocardial contractility and raised the blood pressure with no bradycardia or arrhythmia. NE exerted this cardiostimulating effect in condition of complete adrenoreceptor blockade. Separate infusion of NE and liposomes restored the sensitivity of the adrenergic structures in adrenergic blockade. Modified effect of liposome-entrapped NE depends on liposome effect upon the cell membrane and on concentration of NE in the blood.", 
    "60": "The effects of localized distension of the pulmonary vein - left atrial junctions on plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) have been examined in chloralose anaesthetized dogs. Pulmonary vein distension caused an increase in heart rate and a decrease in plasma AVP concentration. Cooling the vagosympathetic nerves to 10 degrees C caused an increase in arterial pressure and plasma AVP concentration and prevented the changes in heart rate and plasma AVP concentration caused by pulmonary vein distension. Cooling the vagus nerves to 16 degrees C did not change heart rate, arterial pressure, or plasma AVP concentration but significantly reduced the changes in heart rate and plasma AVP concentration caused by pulmonary vein distension. Propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) decreased heart rate and prevented the increase in heart rate associated with pulmonary vein distension but did not abolish the decrease in plasma AVP concentration. It is concluded that distension of the pulmonary vein - left atrial junctions causes a decrease in plasma AVP concentration by stimulating atrial receptors with myelinated afferent fibres. The decrease in plasma AVP concentration is not secondary to the reflex changes in heart rate caused by pulmonary vein distension.", 
    "61": "This paper reports five movement disorders cases to serve as a basis for discussion of the problems encountered in the clinical management of these cases, and the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in these disorders as presented. Case 1 is a description of the subjective experience of a patient with acute orofacial dystonia from promethazine. Case 2 is the use of clonazepam is post-head injury tics. Case 3 is the complication from discontinuation of haloperidol and benztropine mesylate treatment. Case 4 is myoclonus in subacute sclerosing Panencephalitis, and Case 5 is rebound tremor from withdrawal of a beta-adrenergic blocker.", 
    "62": "Possible arrhythmogenic side-effects of the positive inotropic agent prenalterol were studied in conscious dogs, three to four days after coronary artery ligation. Prenalterol showed a propensity to cause arrhythmias in one out of eight dogs, thereby confirming published data from clinical studies.", 
    "63": "The effect of beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation on sinus node function in patients with sick-sinus syndrome was investigated. Electrophysiological studies were performed in 14 patients (5 males and 9 females) aged 18-81 years before and after intravenous administration of 50 micrograms Prenalterol per kilogram body wt. Prenalterol decreased spontaneous cycle length by 26% (p less than 0.01), which corresponded to an increase in heart rate of 21 beats/min. The corrected sinus node recovery time was shortened by 23% (n.s.) in 10 patients, and was abnormal in 12 patients before and in 10 patients after Prenalterol. Secondary pauses occurred in 8 patients at control and in 9 patients after drug administration, in 2 of them for the first time after Prenalterol. In the sick-sinus syndrome the pronounced chronotropic response to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation with Prenalterol doses not indicate improvement of impaired sinus node function.", 
    "64": "Hemodynamic effects of the beta-receptor-blocking agent metoprolol (100 mg orally) and the calcium antagonist verapamil (160 mg orally) were analyzed in 24 patients with atrial fibrillation of different etiology (idiopathic atrial fibrillation, 6 cases; congestive cardiomyopathy, 6 cases; mitral stenosis, 5 cases; mitral regurgitation, 6 cases). 2 h after the administration of either metoprolol or verapamil heart rate was reduced significantly both at rest and during exercise. Cardiac output during exercise was significantly diminished under metoprolol in all groups of patients, whereas no effects were noted under verapamil. Peripheral vascular resistance was significantly decreased by verapamil both at rest and during exercise. No change in total peripheral resistance was noted after metoprolol at rest, but an increase occurred during exercise. Different effects on peripheral circulation may explain the different patterns of cardiac performance observed after heart rate reduction in atrial fibrillation by a calcium antagonist and a beta-blocking agent.", 
    "65": "A total of 149 subjects with borderline arterial hypertension and patients with essential hypertension, stages I-III, were studied. Prolonged (up to 1 year) active hypotensive treatment produced considerable improvement of general wellbeing, blood pressure reduction and an obvious tendency to balancing mentality disorders. Hemiton and reserpine were the most effective drugs in this respect, and obsidan was only slightly less effective. During prolonged treatment, subjects with borderline arterial hypertension can show transitory worsening of their mental status which requires psychotherapeutic correction. Medical rehabilitation for subjects with borderline arterial hypertension should be well-founded.", 
    "66": "The therapeutic effect of the non-cardioselective beta-blocker corgard (nadolol) was examined in 40 patients with stage II essential hypertension. In 22 of those, central, intracardiac and regional hemodynamics were measured echocardiographically and rheographically after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. Blood pressure dropped significantly by days 8-13 of treatment, as a result of cardiac index reduction mainly due to decreased heart rate. At the same time, a moderate yet significant rise in total peripheral vascular resistance was noted. Intramyocardial tension decreased, as did the thickness of the left-ventricular posterior wall and interventricular septum, which caused a significant (6.74%) reduction in myocardial weight.", 
    "67": "Electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic studies were performed in 21 patients with atrioventricular (A-V) nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). Patients were classified into three types according to the patterns during the tachycardia, i.e., (1) type I; an atrial echo (Ae) occurred simultaneously with a ventricular electrogram (VE) (14 patients), (2) type II; an Ae occurred in front of the next VE (four patients) and (3) type III; an Ae followed immediately after the preceding VE (three patients). All patients with type I AVNRT showed discontinuous A-V and continuous ventriculoatrial (V-A) conduction curves. \"Enhanced V-A conduction\" (1:1 V-A conduction at the ventricular paced rate of 200 beats/min) was demonstrated in five of the 14 and after verapamil in two of the five patients. In type II AVNRT the tachycardia was initiated with a minimal amount of A-V nodal conduction delay and second degree A-V or V-A block was observed in all four patients. V-A conduction was poor in these patients. In type III AVNRT A-V conduction curves were discontinuous and retrograde study revealed the presence of retrograde dual A-V nodal pathways. In conclusion, A-V and V-A conduction in patients with AVNRT were variable and this variability seemed to be responsible for different patterns of AVNRT.", 
    "68": "1,1-Diethoxy-3-(1-naphthoxy)-2-propanol (V), the diethyl acetal of an important aldehyde intermediate in the metabolic N-deal-kylation of propranolol, was prepared from compound X, the product of the reaction of the lithium salt of methyl methylsulfinylmethyl sulfide with 2-(1-naphthoxy)-acetaldehyde. Compound X, as a mixture of three diastereomeric alpha-hydroxydithioacetal derivatives, when treated with ethyl orthoformate afforded the desired acetal V as well as two ring-closure products, the dihydronaphtho[1,2-b]pyrans VI and VII. Compounds VI and VII were characterized on the basis of mass spectral and 1H- and 13C-NMR data. The stereochemistry of these compounds was assigned on the basis of the 300-MHz 1H-NMR spectra of their acetate esters (XI and XII).", 
    "69": "Microtubules have been demonstrated in intact heart muscle as well as in cultured myocytes. To better understand what role these filaments may be playing in the regulation of cardiac function we have used the microtubule disrupting agent colchicine and examined its effect upon the rate of beating of rat heart cells. Colchicine, but not the inactive stereoisomer lumicolchicine, increased the myocyte rate of spontaneous contraction in a dose dependent manner. This effect was clearly distinguishable from the positive chronotropic effect of isoprenaline and unlike isoprenaline was not blocked by propranolol. Colchicine was without effect on the in vitro activity of adenylate cyclase assayed in a myocyte homogenate. The binding of 3H-colchicine to cultured heart cells increased with a time course consistent with the increase in heart rate. Subcellular distribution and sephadex gel chromatography demonstrated that approximately 30% of the cell associated colchicine comigrated with tubulin. Measurements of total myocyte tubulin by 3H-colchicine binding indicated that tubulin represents about 0.04% of the total heart cell protein.", 
    "70": "EEG potentials evoked by tactile stimulation of the forearm (tactile-evoked potentials or TEPs) were recorded simultaneously from both cerebral hemispheres in a group of schizophrenics and a group of healthy control subjects. Differences between the groups were found for the early waves of the TEPs: in the control subjects the first two positive waves (P25 and P50) and the first negative wave (N35) recorded from the hemisphere on the same side as the stimulation were slower (i.e. had longer latency) than those recorded from the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulation. This 'lateralization effect' was not seen in the schizophrenic subjects. It was concluded that the TEPs recorded from the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulus were not being transmitted from the other hemisphere via the corpus callosum and must therefore have been transmitted via direct ipsilateral pathways from the periphery. In a second experiment the drug pindolol was administered to schizophrenic subjects but differences in P50 latency between ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were found equally in both drug and placebo groups. We also found slight evidence to suggest that the more severely ill the patient the more similar the TEP latencies recorded from the contralateral and the ipsilateral hemispheres.", 
    "71": "The claim for polymorphism in the metabolism of metoprolol is based on a logical fallacy. A frequency distribution of metoprolol AUC data is presented and, although highly skewed, no evidence of more than a single population is apparent. Plasma and urine metoprolol and metabolite data are also presented to support this.", 
    "72": "It has been demonstrated that, in most arteriopathic patients, vasodilators induce the vascular steal phenomenon, i.e. the shunting of blood from the ischemic to the normally perfused areas. It is conceivable, therefore, that vasoconstrictors may improve in the opposite way, reducing the blood flow to the normal zones and increasing it to the ischemic. A \"reverse vascular steal\" caused by the simultaneous IV injection of a vasodilator and a beta-blocker has been previously shown; however, the chronic treatment of arteriopathic patients with beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs often results in increased evidence of peripheral arterial insufficiency; therefore, the combination of a vasodilating drug with a beta-blocker is limited in the clinical practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the combination of the vasodilator papaverine hydrochloride with a drug having vasoconstrictive action without the undesirable side effects of beta-blockers. Accordingly, raubasine (40 mg) was given p.o. associated with papaverine (300 mg) in 10 arteriopathic patients, who presented a significant reduction of blood flow in the affected limb after the administration of 300 mg p.o. of papaverine alone. The measurements of blood flow were performed by impedance plethysmographic recordings to evaluate papaverine plasma concentrations. Data obtained by this study indicate that papaverine alone induces a significant reduction of blood flow starting from the time of its maximal plasma concentration. Raubasine alone does not induce any change in blood flow, while the combination of the 2 drugs significantly increases the blood supply to the affected limb. These favorable results, probably related to the ability of raubasine to induce a reverse vascular steal, suggest that the combination of this drug with a vasodilator such as papaverine may represent a new approach in the treatment of peripheral arterial insufficiency.", 
    "73": "We determined the clearance of antipyrine before, and during, the administration of propranolol in eight male patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and a recent episode of gastrointestinal bleeding. The clearance of antipyrine in these patients was markedly reduced as compared with that in eight male, age-matched control subjects but was not further decreased after 1 month of propranolol administration. Antipyrine is the prototype of a drug with a low hepatic clearance. We suggest that the hepatic metabolism of some low clearance drugs may not be further decreased when patients with alcoholic cirrhosis are placed on propranolol therapy for the prevention of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.", 
    "74": "The effects of various cardiovascular drugs (prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), propranolol and nitroglycerine) and anaesthetic regimens (halothane, pethidine and pentobarbitone), upon the outcome of coronary artery ligation in acutely prepared rats were determined. Effects upon arrhythmias, blood pressure, heart rate, mortality, ECG and the size of the occluded zone were determined for each drug in the presence of each anaesthetic. PGE2 and nitroglycerine had no statistically significant effects on the outcome of ligation whatever the anaesthetic. Propranolol had limited antiarrhythmic actions. The anaesthetic used had major effects upon the outcome of ligation, regardless of the cardiovascular drugs administered. Pentobarbitone anaesthesia resulted in the highest mortality, and most arrhythmias. Pethidine-N2O anaesthesia was associated with fewer arrhythmias. Halothane-N2O anaesthesia markedly decreased the incidence and severity of arrhythmias, independent of the cardiovascular drug. It was concluded that the anaesthetic used can have a major influence on ligation-induced arrhythmias in acutely prepared anaesthetized rats.", 
    "75": "In dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital, the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was occluded so that the blood flow could be reduced to about 1/3 (partial occlusion). Before partial occlusion, myocardial pH and pO2 were 7.63 (n = 35) and 17.1 mm Hg (n = 30), respectively. Partial occlusion of the LAD decreased the pH and pO2 by 0.68 pH units and 7.4 mm Hg, respectively. In the nonischemic heart, nitroglycerin (20 micrograms/kg, i.v.) did not affect myocardial pH, although it increased the LAD flow. In the ischemic heart, however, nitroglycerin increased the myocardial pH that had been reduced by partial occlusion, without an increase in myocardial pO2. Dipyridamole (250 micrograms/kg, i.v.) did not increase pH and pO2 in both nonischemic and ischemic hearts. Propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.) increased both pH and pO2 of the ischemic myocardium that had been reduced by partial occlusion with a decrease in heart rate. It is concluded that propranolol and nitroglycerin restore (though incompletely) the myocardial pH that has been reduced by partial occlusion of the coronary artery, while dipyridamole does not, and that only propranolol increases the ischemic myocardial pO2.", 
    "76": "Perfusion of 50 microM norepinephrine (NE) produced a marked, reversible decrease (range 20-28%) of the extracellular population spike and excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) responses of the CA1 region evoked by stratum radiatum stimulation in the rat hippocampal slice preparation. The effects of NE were dramatically altered in slices obtained from animals which were previously treated with intracerebral or intraventricular injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to destroy forebrain catecholamine systems. In the latter preparations NE produced a reduction in the inhibition of the EPSP (50%), enhancement of the population spike amplitude, and multiple spike discharges characteristic of ongoing epileptiform activity. The reversal of NE-induced inhibition and the generation of seizurelike activity in 6-OHDA-treated animals suggests that NE may, in part, act upon interneurons to produce a disinhibition of CA1 pyramidal cells.", 
    "77": "In a patient with an uncomplicated pheochromocytoma, we observed high basal value of plasma renin activity (PRA), 16.2 ng/ml/h, and a remarkable elevation in PRA from 18.2 to 90.4 ng/ml/h and concomitant blood pressure reduction following a single oral administration of 25 mg of captopril. The response was same as that observed in renovascular hypertensives, and disappeared during the period of alpha-, beta-blocker administration or after the surgery. Basal PRA also returned to low normal level. The renin-angiotensin (R-A) system probably had a role in the maintenance of high blood pressure. The mechanism of the activation of the R-A system was thought to be renal vasoconstriction due to excessive circulating catecholamines."
