    "0": "A double-blind crossover trial was completed in 15 patients with moderate hypertension and the effects of propranolol (Inderal) 80 mg twice a day and atenolol (Tenormin) 100 mg twice a day were assessed on blood pressure, pulse rate and plasma renin activity (PRA), while patients were maintained on 1 cyclopenthiazide tablet (Navidrex K) per day. Both agents caused a significant reduction in blood pressure and pulse rate with patients at rest and during exercise. Plasma renin activity was significantly reduced by both agents in subjects with normal and high renin levels (with PRA 2-8 ng/ml/h and greater than 8 ng/ml/h respectively). Blood pressure responses could not be correlated with renin status or reduction in pulse rate. No adverse effects were attributable to either of the two beta-adrenergic blocking agents and we concluded that a beta1-selective agent, which has the advantage of not aggravating bronchospasm, can replace the non-selective propranolol.", 
    "1": "Pretreatment with propranolol does not modify the estrogen-induced uterine eosinophilia, the water imbibition effect, nor the increase in uterine RNA and protein content. This confirms the independence of these parameters from the estrogen-induced early increase in uterine cAMP, since, when observed, the latter is suppressed by propranolol pretreatment.", 
    "2": "This study attempts to determine whether a direct coronary vasoconstriction follows beta blockade with propranolol. Coronary blood flow was varied with the aid of a pump. When myocardial contractile force was plotted as a function of coronary blood flow a characteristic biphasic curve resulted. Autoperfusion without the pump resulted in a flow rate which fell on the knee of that curve. Any direct vasomotion therefore should shift that autoperfused flow rate off of that knee. When propranolol was given intravenously at 0.5 mg/kg a new contractile force--flow curve resulted but the autoperfused coronary blood flow remained at the knee of the curve. Since these data indicate that coronary flow fell precisely in proportion to myocardial metabolism it is concluded that all coronary vasoconstriction following propranolol is secondary to changes in metabolism.", 
    "3": "The pharmacokinetics of atenolol, a new cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, were determined following both acute and chronic dosing in 33 hypertensive patients with widely differing levels of renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function the atenolol half-life was calculated to be about six hours following single 100 mg oral doses. This value increased markedly in patients with renal insufficiency and the blood clearance of atenolol was found to have a significant correlation with the glomerular filtration rate. This demonstrated the importance of the kidneys in the elimination of the drug. After 8 weeks oral treatment with atenolol (100 mg twice daily) a significant decrease in blood pressure, heart rate and plasma renin activity was observed, but no correlation was established between the blood levels of atenolol and any of its pharmacodynamic effects. A positive correlation was found however between the anti-hypertensive action of atenolol and the pretreatment value of the plasma renin activity.", 
    "4": "Adverse reactions to practolol were studied in 198 prospectively monitored hospitalized medical patients. The mean age of the practolol recipients was 57 years; angina and cardiac arrhythmias were the most common indications for therapy. Adverse reactions were attributed to practolol in 20 patients (10%). Fifteen of these twenty reactions involved impairment of cardiac function (bradyarrhythmias, heart block, congestive heart failure, hypotension), and in three instances the reaction was considered life-threatening. Three additional patients had cutaneous reactions attributed to the drug. Adverse reactions to practolol were not dose-related, but toxicity appeared to be more frequent among patients concurrently receiving quinidine. The frequency of cardiovascular complications of propranolol in a similar series of patients was nearly identical. However, no skin reactions were attributed to propranolol. The findings suggest that practolol and propranolol produce unwanted cardiovascular effects with nearly equal frequency among hospitalized patients. Cutaneous reactions to practolol are evident even during short-term use.", 
    "5": "The present study was carried out in an homogenous group of 49 untreated hypertensive patients, all aged 45 years. Diastolic blood pressure was equal to or greater than 110 mmHg in successive measurements; eleven patients were classified as WHO group II, and the others as WHO group I. An initial placebo period of 3 weeks was followed by cyclothiazide medication with a good response in 6 patients. The remaining patients were given either clonidine or practolol, and by adjustment of the dose a good response was obtained in 31 patients. In these cases the treatment was exchanged after 6 weeks. The antihypertensive effect of relatively small doses of clonidine was equal to that of practolol. Since completion of the study practolol has been withdrawn because of the emergence of long term toxic effects. In 12 cases, hydralazine had to be added to obtain a satisfactory response. Mild side-effects were common, especially at the beginning of clonidine treatment, but they did not necessitate discontinuation of treatment. Further comparative studies of clonidine and beta-blockers should be carried out and more experience with the combination of clonidine and vasodilators in the treatment of hypertension is necessary.", 
    "6": "In a double-blind crossover study the symptomatic and metabolic effects of propranolol, acebutolol, and atenolol were studied during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in diabetics treated with diet or hypoglycaemic tablets. All the drugs prevented tachycardia, but did not affect the other symptoms of hypoglycaemia. Propranolol delayed the recovery of the blood glucose concentration and impaired the secondary rise in the concentrations of blood lactate and non-esterified fatty acids in diet-treated diabetics. Acebutolol potentiated the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin in tablet-treated diabetics (mean difference of blood glucose concentration 0.7 mmol/l (12.6 mg/100 ml)) and this difference was maintained during the recovery phase4 the blood lactate response was also impaired. Atenolol did not differ perceptibly from placebo in its effect on the metabolic responses to acute hypoglycaemia. The results may be explained by differences in the known pharmacological actions of these drugs. They support the hypothesis that beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs that are highly beta1 specific and without membrane-stabilising activity should be safer than the non-selective drugs when used in diabetic patients at risk from hypoglycaemia.", 
    "7": "The effect of indomethacin-induced inhibition of endogenous prostaglandin synthesis on the antihypertensive activity of pindolol (15 mg daily) and propranolol (80--160 mg daily) was studied in 7 hypertensive patients. In four test phases of 10 days each, patients received beta-blocker alone, placebo, beta-blocker plus indomethacin (100 mg daily), and beta-blocker alone. Mean supine diastolic blood-pressure rose from 82 +/- 2 mm Hg in the first beta-blocker phase to 98 +/- 3 mm Hg in the placebo phase, remained elevated (96 +/- 3 mm Hg) in the beta-blocker-plus-indomethacin phase, and fell to 83 +/- 3 mm Hg in the last beta-blocker phase. Diastolic blood-pressure values obtained in the beta-blocker-plus-indomethacin phase were not significantly different from those obtained in the placebo phase but were significantly different from the values measured in both beta-blocker phases (P less than 0-01). The changes in systolic blood-pressure and pulse-rate were not significant. These preliminary results suggest that the antihypertensive effect of these two beta-blockers in some hypertensive patients may be related to the endogenous prostaglandin system.", 
    "8": "The C6 glioma cell line contains nerve growth factor (NGF) which can be released into the medium. Treatment of the cells with beta-adrenoceptor agonists resulted in increased content of NGF in both the cells and the medium within a few hours, whereas alpha-adrenoceptor agonists were ineffective. The response was blocked by beta- but not alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists. The increase of the NGF content of glioma cells appeared to be mediated by an elevation of cyclic AMP or GMP. The addition to the cell cultures of other putative neurotransmitters failed to change the content of either NGF or cyclic AMP. These results are discussed with respect to a model for adrenergic neuron-glial interactions.", 
    "9": "In a comparative study the effect of pindolol (Visken, Sandoz) on experimental infarct size and left ventricular function in the pig has been investigated. Pindolol was given 30 min prior to the ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and on the following 5 days twice daily in a dosage of 0.05 mg/kg body weight. For morphometric assessment of infarct size the ventricular myocardium was cut into slices and stained with nitro-benztoluene. There is a significant reduction of infarct size (by one third) in the pindolol-treated group as compared to the controls. In addition, deterioration of left ventricular function is less marked in the pindolol-treated group.", 
    "10": "In the patient suffering from angina, the protective effect of oxprenolol in the isoprenaline test is demonstrated by the reduction of disappearance of ischemic-type electrocardiographic alterations and of angina and rhythm disturbances. In our study, these results were obtained in spite of neutralization of the negative chronotropic effect of the beta-blocker through the use of an endo-auricular pacemaker. This points indirectly to the role played by the contractile state of the myocard in catecholamine-induced modifications of the oxygen intake of cardiac muscle.", 
    "11": "The effect of 40 mg oxprenolol on stage-fright was assessed in 24 musicians in a double-blind crossover trial. Musical performance judged by two professional assessors was found to improve. Greatest improvement was seen on the first performance and in those most affected by nervousness.", 
    "12": "The effect of (+)-sotalol and deoxysotalol on prostaglandin (PGF2a and 15-methyl PGF2alpha)-evoked contractions was studied using the isolated rat uterus. After control responses to prostaglandins had been obtained the uterus was exposed to the nutrient fluid containing 10 microgram/ml of (+)-sotalol, deoxysotalol or (--) sotalol. 30 min later the responses to prostaglandins were again recorded. Both (+)-sotalol and deoxysotalol potentiated PGF2alpha as well as 15-methyl PGF2alpha-induced contractions. (--)-Sotalol did not potentiate the PGF2alpha-evoked contractions of the isolated rat uterus. The possible clinical significance of the results is discussed.", 
    "13": "Strength-interval curves, relating an index of the contractile vigor of premature beats to their coupling intervals, were elicited in anesthetized, open-chest dogs prepared for atrial or ventricular pacing and the high-fidelity measurement of left ventricular pressure. During inotropic interventions, changes of the curves were evaluated in terms of the parameters (slopes and intercepts) of their straight lines of best fit. These parameters were altered by isoproterenol, propranolol, and heart rate, and were correlated closely with paired values of isovolumic Vmax (of driven beats). The strength-interval curves were reproducible and were not affected by large changes of venous return or arterial blood pressure. These results provide a basis for the use of strength-interval curves for the evaluation of ventricular contractile state, using fluid-filled catheters for the measurement of left ventricular pressure.", 
    "14": "A case of pheochromocytoma of the urinary bladder is reported, and 35 perviously reported cases are analyzed. This interesting entity can present with symptoms of catecholamine excess and severe hypertensive spells (often micturition-induced) or as asymptomatic hematuria without hypertension. The present case represents the severest end of the clinical spectrum, with advancing acute retinopathy and visual loss, very high blood pressure and greatly increased catecholamine excretion. Several special precautions were utilized during diagnostic studies and surgery. On the whole, prognosis is excellent in nonmalignant cases properly handled, and the location of the tumor provides opportunity for early case finding and complete cure.", 
    "15": "The effect of isoproterenol on pancreatic secretion stimulated by the octapeptide of cholecystokinin (OP-CCK) was studied in dogs with gastric and pancreatic fistulas. Special precautions were taken to prevent entry of gastric acid into the duodenum and reflux of duodenal content into the stomach. OP-CCK increased volume and the outputs of bicarbonate and protein from the pancreas. Isoproterenol inhibited these pancreatic responses to OP-CCK, and the degree of inhibition was dose related. Propranolol blocked the inhibitory action of isoproterenol completely. Analysis of data by Michaelis-Menten kinetics revealed that there was competitive inhibition of protein output with noncompetitive inhibition of bicarbonate output. The experiments show that isoproterenol inhibits OP-CCK--stimulated pancreatic secretion by a beta-adrenergic mechanism. The kinetic analysis suggests that the intimate mechanisms involved in inhibition of protein and bicarbonate output by isoproterenol are different.", 
    "16": "The disposition of acebutolol has been studied following intravenous doses of 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg in 9 healthy subjects using a specific chromatographic assay to determine concentrations of drug in blood. The mean blood clearance was 6.55 ml/min/kg and the mean renal clearance, 2.68 ml/min/kg. Blood clearance was found to have a coefficient of variation of 14% for the group, to be independent of dose, and to remain essentially constant over approximately 3 wk. The fraction of the dose excreted in the urine unchanged was 0.405. Data were fitted to an equation for a two-compartment model. The mean fast and slow half-lives were 6.08 and 156.8 min, respectively. The volume of the central compartment was 0.223 L/kg, and the volume of distribution at steady-state was 1.165 L/kg. The fraction of acebutolol unbound to plasma proteins was 0.743 and was independent of drug concentration in the range examined. Data obtained from 15-min infusions were used to predict plateau blood concentrations with good accuracy during an 8-hr dosage regimen.", 
    "17": "The protein binding of two basic drugs, alprenolol and imipramine, and the acidic drug, naproxen, was determined in plasma obtained from 23 healthy subjects. A 2-fold variation was found between individuals in the free fraction of the two bases, while the range was even greater with naproxen. The free fraction correlated with the plasma concentration of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein for alprenolol (r = -0.75, p less than 0.001) and imipramine (r = -0.78, p less than 0.001), while there was no correlation for naproxen (r - 0.24, p greater than 0.1). This confirms recent experiments which showed that isolated alpha 1-acid glycoprotein avidly bound both alprenolol and imipramine. Drug binding, however, did not correlate with albumin concentration, although experiments with isolated albumin demonstrated its unusually high affinity for naproxen.", 
    "18": "The protein binding of a number of basic drugs has been shown to be inhibited when blood is collected in Vacutainer tubes. We found that the plasticizer tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP), present in plasma collected in Vacutainers, was a potent inhibitor of alprenolol and imipramine protein binding. Its concentration in the plasma could quantitatively explain the displacement phenomenon. Alprenolol binding to a solution of a physiologic concentration (0.67 gm/L, 0.015 mM) of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid) was decreased from 75% to 16% by addition of 10 microgram/ml (0.026 mM) of TBEP, while imipramine binding was decreased from 69% to 13%. Alprenolol and imipramine binding to albumin and lipoproteins was virtually unchanged by TBEP. Due to its selective effect on binding to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, TBEP may be a useful tool for studying plasma protein binding of basic drugs.", 
    "19": "Intravenous and oral pharmacokinetics of pinlolol were studied in 18 hypertensive patients-9 with normal renal function and 9 with impaired renal function. Analysis of data showed that a linear two-compartment model was suitable to describe the pindolol kinetics. Compared with patients with normal renal function, patients with chronic renal failure exhibited: (1) unchanged transfer rate constants and distribution volumes and (2) decreased total body clearance with decreased renal clearance and unchanged nonrenal clearance. Analysis of oral data by the Loo-Riegelman method showed that the pindolol absorption kinetic was not first order. Compared with patients with normal renal function, patients with chronic renal failure exhibited decreased fraction of dose effectively absorbed and increased initial rate of absorption. The initial rate of absorption was inversely correlated with the creatinine clearance. The study disclosed evidence that absorption was modified in chronic renal failure.", 
    "20": "Coronary occlusion in the dog results in irreversible myocardial cell injury which develops first in subendocardial areas of severe ischemica and subsequently spreads into mid and subepicardial areas of moderate ischemia. The effect of propranolol on this progression of ischemic injury was evaluated. Three groups of dogs were studied: 1) untreated, 2) treated with propranolol before and throughout coronary ligation, and 3) treated with propranolol beginning three hours after ligation. Dogs were sacrificed 24 hours after coronary ligation and necrosis was quantitated from histologic sections of transmural slices through the posterior papillary muscle. Propranolol reduced infarct size by preventing necrosis in peripheral (subepicardial) areas of moderately ischemic myocardium. Pretreatment with propranolol reduced necrosis from 85 +/- 3% (untreated) to 52 +/- 4% (P less than 0.05). Delayed propranolol therapy was about half as effective as pre-treatment and reduced necrosis to 71 +/- 3% (P less than 0.05). Propranolol also limited microvascular injury so that perfusion defects, detected with the dye thioflavin S, were smaller in treated dogs.", 
    "21": "The assessment of the possible role played by the renin-angiotensin system in maintaining arterial hypertension requires an understanding of the mechanisms regulating renin release from the kidney. In addition to intrarenal mechanisms of control, recent investigation stresses the importance of sympathetic influences on the juxtaglomerular cells both in experimental animals and in man. Studies with beta-adrenergic blocking agents, interfering with sympathetic release of renin, and with peptides interfering with sympathetic release of renin, and with peptides interfering with the generation or action of angiotensin II, suggest that renin may play some pressor role in a number of cases of hypertension: a major one in the small group of patients with high plasma renin, and possibly a minor one in the large population of patients whose renin is stimulated by treatment with diuretics and vasodilators. On the whole, available evidence suggests that renin disturbances in essential hypertension are rarely primary. It is unlikely, therefore, that renin levels alone can suffice as guideline for treatment of hypertension. A more comprehensive approach should be based on a multifaceted profile, including but not limited to renin.", 
    "22": "The administration of 160 mg of propranolol during pregnancy, labor, and delivery was associated with profound hypoglycemia and respiratory depression in a newborn infant. The neonate's plasma propranolol level rose from 40 ng/ml at the time of birth to 90 ng/ml four hours later. This increase in plasma propranolol concentration might be due to redistribution of the drug in the neonate as well as to different elimination mechanisms than in adults. The elevated propranolol level four hours after delivery was not associated with any signs or symptoms of drug toxicity, but drug effect was apparent on the electrocardiogram. The administration of propranolol during pregnancy in doses capable of producing therapeutic maternal blood levels may be dangerous to the neonate.", 
    "23": "The role of adenergic receptors in the motility of duodenum and choledochoduodenal junction in the pig. Acta Physiol. Pol., 1977, 28 (6): 521-528. The choldeochoduodenal junction in the Vietnamese pig is functionally and anatomically a part of duodenal wall. In view of this, investigations were carried out for establishing the role of adrenergic receptors in the development of motor function of this part of the intestinal tract. The experiments were performed on domestic Vietnamese pigs (Sus scrofa domestica) and they showed that after stimulation of alpha and beta adrenergic receptors the motor activity of the duodenal muscular coat and the choledochoduodenal junction is inhibited. The obtained results suggest similar reactions of the adrenergic receptors in both examined parts of the intestinal tract in the pig.", 
    "24": "The haemodynamic shifts during head up and head down tilt were investigated in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and matched normotensive control rats (NCR) under nembutal anaesthesia and autonomic blockage. During head up tilt a greater fall in blood pressure and stroke volume was observed in SHR than in NCR, while the reverse was true when tilted in the opposite direction. This altered cardiac response to venous filling, also observed in patients with essential hypertension, is suggested to be caused by an altered Frank-Starling relationship of the hypertrophied heart in hypertensive individuals.", 
    "25": "Acute coronary and systemic hemodynamic effects of acetaldehyde before and subsequent to beta adrenergic blockade by propranolol were studied in intact anesthetized dogs. Acetaldehyde produces a sympathomimetic effect compatible with catecholamine release as seen by an increase in heart rate, cardiac output, pulmonary and systemic pressures and body oxygen consumption. The marked decrease in coronary vascular resistance and increase in coronary blood flow is blocked to only a minor degree by propranolol, indicating that a major part of its action on the coronary circulation is not due to catecholamine release. Acetaldehyde dilates large coronary vessels and appears to increase collateral blood flow to obstructed arteries, as determined by angiographic study.", 
    "26": "A case of atrial fibrillation, with a fast ventricular response, which developed under enflurane anaesthesia is described in a patient previously treated with digitalis and propranolol. The intravenous administration of propranolol was ineffective whereas that of neostigmine and atropine, 2 hours later, was successful and reduced the ventricular rate to normal values.", 
    "27": "Either atropine, isoprenaline, neostigmine or practolol was given intravenously in therapeutic doses to dogs anesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium. Cardiac arrhythmias were induced by potassium chloride intravenously as a bolus injection in a dose of 0.3 mmol/kg. The standard electrocardiographic lead II was recorded continuously. pH, Po2 and Pco2 were checked from arterial blood samples before and after the injection. The isoprenaline treated dogs showed the smallest amount of arrhythmias and all the dogs survived. More severe arrhythmias were seen in the neostigmine and practolol treated dogs and the most severe occurrences were encountered in the atropine treated dogs.", 
    "28": "Propranolol alone was more effective than either chlordiazepoxide or a combination of chlordiazepoxide and propranolol in alleviating the symptoms of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "29": "1. Sodium movement across the porcine aortic arch in vitro is greater from the intimal to the medial surface than in the reverse direction. 2. A short-circuit current can be measured across the aortic arch and the calculated energy is greater than the energy required to support the net outward sodium movement, suggesting the possibility of active transport of other ions. 3. Net sodium movement is not significantly altered by an adverse gradient on the outside (medial side) but is reduced by a gradient in the opposite direction. 4. Sodium retention within the tissue is increased by a gradient on the medial side. 5. The movement of [14C]inulin is greater from the medial to the intimal surface, suggesting greater porosity on the medial side. A slight rise in both total tissue fluid and extracellular fluid occurred when the sodium concentration on the medial side of the preparation was increased. This did not occur with the sodium concentration increased on the intimal side. The changes were only significant statistically for total tissue fluid. 6. The short-circuit current can be enhanced by adrenaline and reduced by a variety of beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking agents. 7. It appears that aortic tissue can actively transport sodium and it is suggested that this mechanism could play a part in blood pressure control.", 
    "30": "Glucose tolerance tests were performed on six hyperthyroid patients in the morning and afternoon before, and at the end of treatment with propranolol for 2 weeks. All six subjects showed normal glucose tolerance with a normal diurnal rhythm before treatment and this remained normal in five during treatment with propranolol, while one patient developed abnormal glucose tolerance and the diurnal variation was abolished. No change in insulin levels was noted in any of the patients either before or during treatment. Propranolol may cause deterioration in glucose tolerance in some subjects with hyperthyroidism and this possibility should not be overlooked.", 
    "31": "The quantitative analysis of propranolol and its metabolite N-desisopropylpropranolol in plasma and urine is described. The drugs are extracted into 2-pentanol-heptane, and the solvent is concentrated. The whole residue is chromatographed on silica gel plates. The compounds are determined directly on the thin-layer plates without derivatization. The recovery of propranolol from plasma is 70%, with a standard deviation of +/- 4%.", 
    "32": "In a series of 200 cases of unstable angina who have had coronary arteriography carried out, a stenosis of more than 60% of the trunk of the left coronary artery was noted in 40 cases (20%). This sinister site of arteriosclerosis may be suspected in patients presenting with long-standing angina (mean for the group 44 months), an angina which has recently become worse, one which is not responding rapidly to rest and beta-blockers, and in particular one where there has been a previous infarction (50% of cases). Coronary arteriography shows that the lesions were more diffuse and more severe in the group with stenosis of the main trunk. Surgical prognosis becomes worse (31% mortality) because of the risk of vascular complications. Treatment by large doses of Propranolol improves the classically gloomy prognosis of these patients when treated medically.", 
    "33": "Nitroglycerin and long-acting nitrates are the pharmacologic mainstays of antianginal therapy, both for acute attacks and for prophylaxis. Propranolol is often effective for prophylaxis in patients incompletely helped by nitrates. A holistic approach is stressed. Appropriate drug use will effect marked improvement in most pateints.", 
    "34": "The hypertensive action of atenolol has been studied in a randomized double-blind crossover comparison. Twelve patients showed a highly significant reduction in average supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures from pre-treatment values of 196.3/115.9 to 159.1/89.2 mmHg (26.1/15.4 kPa to 22.2/11.9 kPa) after 2 weeks on once daily atenolol. No dose-related reduction in blood pressure was seen and the single 100 mg daily dose was as effective as 100 mg twice daily or 50 mg twice daily. Blood pressures recorded after 2 weeks' atenolol were lower than those obtained at 7 days irrespective of dose.", 
    "35": "Renin-aldosterone profiling was used to classify patients with hypertension: 243 patients with essential hypertension were classified by renin-urinary sodium indexing; 107 were reclassified by response to administration of furosemide and intravenous saline; 45 were further classified by response to a low-sodium diet. Arbitrary \"normal ranges\" were determined in 89, 32, and 38 volunteers, respectively. Patients with low-renin apparently do not have \"high-volume\" hypertension. Rather, they show a primary renal abnormality in renin secretion and become relatively deficient in angiotensin II and aldosterone when they are subjected to diuresis. They can maintain aldosterone secretion under normal conditions because their adrenal aldosterone receptor is supersensitive to angiotensin II. No evidence of abnormal sympathetic neural activity was found among the renin subgroups. Renin-aldosterone profiling in current clinical practice seems useful mainly in the detection of patients with curable forms of secondary hypertension. Aldosterone/renin ratios may be particularly helpful in diagnosis when obtained after a patient has undergone expansion or contraction of his extracellular fluid volume.", 
    "36": "Female beagles dosed once with encapsulated 14C-bunolol (10 mg/kg) excreted 61% of the isotope in urine in 24 hr. The pooled urine contained a minimum of 18 labeled compounds. Two previously unknown metabolites were purified and were identified by UV and mass spectral data; they were hydroxybunolol (10.1% of urinary radioactivity) and hydroxydihydrobunolol (9.8%). The urine also contained bunolol (0.7% of urinary carbon-14), dihydrobunolol (0.5%), conjugated dihydrobunolol (2.8%), beta-(5-oxytetralonyl)lactic acid (16.3%), and (5-oxytetralonyl) acetic acid (7.1%).", 
    "37": "The effects of two beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs, the non-selective propranolol and the beta1selective metoprolol, were studied on hemodynamics and plasma renin activity (PRA) of healthy volunteers in an ergometric exercise test. Oral doses of 160 mg of propranolol and 200 mg of metoprolol were tested against placebo. The drug plasma concentrations were determined. Heart rate and systolic blood pressure were equal and significantly lower during treatment with both active drugs when compared to placebo. The effect of drugs on exercise heart rate was correlated with the logarithm of drug plasma concentration with both propranolol and metoprolol. Propranolol, but not metoprolol, decreased the basal level of PRA. The ergometric exercise induced a significant rise in PRA after placebo but this increase was partially inhibited by the both active drugs. On the basis of these findings it is suggested that in man the basal level of PRA could be decreased mainly by blocking the beta2-adrenoceptors. Instead the exercise induced increase of PRA could be inhibited by blocking the beta1-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "38": "Metoprolol is a beta1-selective adrenoceptor blocking drug. In hypertension, its duration of effect is longer than expected from its half-life and it is suitable for twice daily administration. There is some evidence that once daily administration may be possible in treating hypertension. It is similar in efficacy to other beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs in angina pectoris and essential hypertension, when given in equiactive beta-blocking dosages. Metoprolol is well tolerated and side-effects have not proved a problem. It has some pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences from other beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs and may prove useful in cases where these differences are shown to be clinically important.", 
    "39": "Tolazoline (2-benzyl-2-imidazoline) activated adenylate cyclase in pig epidermal slices resulting in the accumulation of cyclic AMP. This effect was highly potentiated by the addition of the cyclic AMP-phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline. Specific histamine (H2) receptor inhibitors (metiamide and cimetidine) completely blocked the tolazoline activation of adenylate cylase. At low concentrations (10-100 micrometer), a histamine (H1) receptor inhibitor (diphenhydramine) and a beta-adrenergic blocker (propranolol) did not inhibit this effect. The stimulation of cyclic AMP formation by the combination of tolazoline and histamine was about the same as the stimulation by histamine alone (nonadditive), whereas the stimulatory effects by tolazoline and epinephrine were additive. These data suggest that tolazoline, an alpha-adrenergic blocker, also activates adenylate cyclase at the histamine (H2) receptor site which is distinct from the beta-adrenergic receptor site. Another alpha-adrenergic blocker, phentolamine, did not have this effect.", 
    "40": "Practolol ('Eraldin') is a beta-blocking agent whose prolonged use may result in the appearance of untoward side-effects, notably ocular symptoms, skin rashes and deafness. We report ten cases of deafness due, or thought to be due, to practolol; and in all except three of the cases (8,9 and 10), the deafness became manifest many months after the appearance of lesions in the skin and eyes. Progression of any hearing loss caused by this drug seems to be arrested by its withdrawal. Otologists are urged to report any suspicious cases to the Committee on Safety of Medicines, Finsbury Square House, 33/37A Finsbury Square, London EC2A IPP.", 
    "41": "The relatively rare complications developing under local anaesthesia may be due to various causes. The possibilities of the development of accidents under local anaesthesia are outlined; and prophylactic and therapeutic measures are deduced. A schematic premedication cannot prevent the development of complications with a sufficient degree of certainty; for instance, in certain cases the administration of atropine alone will still worsen the course of a complication. On the contrary, an individual premedication should be aimed at, especially in risk patients; the dosage must take into consideration all important factors. Consequently, atropine is of less importance than, for example, psychopharmaca and beta-receptor blockers.", 
    "42": "In recent years a number of new preparations from the group of antiserotonin agents (including cyproheptadine and carbazochrome) as well as beta-adrenergic blocking agents (propranolol) and clonidine have been introduced for prevention of migraine and similar headaches. The efficiency of these drugs was studied in a group of 9 selected cases--adolescents with severe migraine refractory to other methods of treatment. In 7 cases the improvement was noted. The results were compared with own observations on larger groups of adults and data from literature. Too small number of observed patients made impossible definite conclusions. It seems, however that in selected cases the use of these drugs in headaches of adolescents is useful.", 
    "43": "The changes occurring in hemodynamics due to the effect of alpha-adreno-blocking agent pyrroxan and beta-blocking agent obzidan were studied in 20 patients with neurocirculatory dystonia and in 20 patients with stage IIB hypertensive disease. Forty healthy persons formed the control group. The results of the investigation allow for the assumption that a pharmacological test with a record of the transthoracic rheogram and the derivatives of the central pulse tracings help in the proper choice of the drug and its dosage with the state of hemodynamics and the inotropic myocardial reaction taken into account."
